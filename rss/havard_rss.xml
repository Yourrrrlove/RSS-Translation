p>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;朱莉·德沃尔&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;欢迎观看 HBR 视频快速观看。我是 Julie Devoll，哈佛商业评论特别项目和网络研讨会的编辑。今天我们采访了 SAP Cloud Enterprise Resource Planning 首席营销和解决方案官 Eric van Rossum。我们在这里讨论中型公司财务领导者需要什么才能取得成功。埃里克，非常感谢您今天加入我们。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;埃里克·范罗苏姆&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;感谢您招待我；我很高兴能谈论这一切对中型公司意味着什么。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Julie Devoll&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div id=&quot;DFP_IC_pos3&quot;>; &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;>;if (isAdobeSync()) googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(&quot;DFP_IC_pos3&quot;); });&lt;/script>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/ div>; &lt;p>;首先，让 CFO 彻夜难眠的问题是什么？&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Eric van Rossum&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;好问题。归根结底，是什么让首席财务官彻夜难眠，全天都在讨论各种话题，最重要的是什么？首席财务官处境艰难。我们正处于低增长、通货膨胀的经济环境中。但利益相关者和股东仍然期望收入增长。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;首席财务官们在思考：“在这个动荡和不确定的经济中，如何制定正确的战略和路线图以实现增长？”从这个角度来看，他们面临着一些挑战。首先，当事情难以预测时，他们需要创建可靠的财务预测和模型。其次，需要确保有足够的资本来支持增长战略以及日常运营，随着利率的上升，这意味着对不同的金融工具、机会成本进行更有针对性的审查和时间范围。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;朱莉·德沃尔&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;中型企业的财务领导者如何利用云 ERP 等技术来管理当今的需求？而且，推动未来的增长？&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Eric van Rossum&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我认为有三件事：第一，云 ERP 不仅限于这一刻。二、云ERP让企业走上持续创新之旅。最后，第三点，Cloud ERP 提供标准化。&lt;/p>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div id=&quot;DFP_IC_pos4&quot;>; &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;>;if (isAdobeSync()) googletag.cmd.push( function() { googletag.display(&quot;DFP_IC_pos4&quot;); });&lt;/script>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;让我们从第一点开始，Cloud ERP 不受限制到某个时刻。 S/4HANA Cloud 公共版等解决方案将与您一起成长。它们允许公司在发展过程中采用所需的能力。特别是对于中型公司来说，他们可以从今天运营所需的基本要素开始，然后从那里开始构建。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;速度就是游戏的名称。这是关于在两到三个月内上线并从那里迭代。这就引出了第二点——云 ERP 让公司踏上了持续创新的旅程。公司可以利用季度创新周期来部署新功能。这就是我们今天定期交付软件的方式。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;最后，还有标准化。中型企业将通过云 ERP 获得与大型竞争对手相同的经过时间考验的流程，无需昂贵的定制。 SAP 因定义 ERP 行业最佳实践而闻名，我们也致力于定义下一代 ERP 最佳实践。正如我所提到的，客户可以开箱即用，根据这些行业最佳实践快速实现价值。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;朱莉·德沃尔&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;您已经提到组织的财务和会计团队如何在确保今天和明天的增长和弹性方面发挥带头作用。但是，财务部门可以做些什么来获得最有力的社会和环境成果呢？&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Eric van Rossum&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;对于财务领导者来说，他们可以做三件事。首先，也是最重要的一点，了解他们的角色。财务领导者在推动社会和环境成果方面发挥着关键作用。他们将成为管家和决策者，帮助制定业务目标和 KPI，无论是碳核算还是围绕社会承诺、多样性、包容性或环境影响的关键指标。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;其次，他们可以以身作则，将可持续发展纳入围绕财务规划的讨论中，带来他们在财务和会计方面众所周知的严谨性，并将其应用于 ESG 要求和全公司控制。第三，他们可以合作和协作。随着 ESG 要求在全球范围内从自愿演变为强制性，标准化和透明度是必要的。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当公司与自身标准内外志同道合的组织进行协作和合作时，这将发挥最佳作用。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;朱莉·德沃尔&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;埃里克，今天您想对我们的观众说些什么吗？&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;埃里克范罗森&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当然。在 SAP，我们在支持为可持续发展带来更多标准化的努力方面发挥着非常积极的作用。我们最近宣布计划引入所谓的绿色账本，这是基于账本的碳核算。公司可以管理进入和离开其系统的碳排放，并平衡其对社会和环境的责任，即“碳账簿”，就像我们处理财务账簿一样。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;ERP 一直是企业的记录系统。金融，并通过这个绿色分类账，我们正在努力使其成为可持续发展的记录系统。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;朱莉·德沃尔&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;埃里克，这个这是一次很棒的谈话。非常感谢您今天加入我们。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Eric van Rossum&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;同样。我非常喜欢它，希望很快能再次与您交谈。&lt;/p>; &lt;hr>; &lt;p>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ad.doubleclick.net/ddm/trackclk/N69702.124507HBRHARVARDBUSINESSR/B29173838.375511754 ;dc_trk_aid=566807122;dc_trk_cid=189409904;dc_lat=;dc_rdid=;tag_for_child_directed_treatment=;tfua=;ltd=;dc_tdv=1&quot;>;&lt;strong>;&lt;em>;了解更多。&lt;/em>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/a>; &lt;/p>; &lt;hr>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;&lt;em>;Eric van Rossum 是 SAP 云 ERP 首席营销和解决方案官。&lt;/em>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;/body>; &lt;/html >; &lt;!-- 引用 -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 20 Sep 2023 01:25:01 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Crucial Role of ID Verification in the Digital Economy]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/09/the-crucial-role-of-id-verification-in-the-digital-economy]]><description> &lt;div>;

&lt;span>;&lt;p>;身份验证工具的核心是证明您的信息“”姓名、地址、年龄、电话号码&amp;#8211;有效并与您相关联。可以使用许多不同的技术来实现这一目标。作者是万事达卡的首席执行官，探讨了该技术的工作原理、使用地点以及数字 ID 的潜在陷阱。&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/p>; div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/the-crucial-role-of-id-verification-in-the-digital-economy?language=es&quot;>;阅读西班牙语&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/the-crucial-role-of-id-verification-in-the-digital-economy?language=pt&quot;>;葡萄牙语&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;作为数以百万计的小企业在大流行期间开设了新的在线店面，一组在幕后辛勤工作的技术使所有这些网站以及销售和交付成为可能。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这些技术中最重要的一个，也许也是最重要的技术之一默默无闻的是身份验证。该软件已经存在了几十年，可以证明您就是您所说的那样。每次您在线购物时（这种情况每天在世界各地发生数十亿次），身份验证系统都会对您进行身份验证。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;如果没有这个简单的概念，数字经济就无法运行。所有这些新的数字化企业，从时装设计师到面包店，都无法区分他们的客户和诈骗者。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当然，有很多种身份验证系统，这些技术将成为随着数字经济的发展，这一点变得更加重要。需要身份识别工具来继续应对网络攻击和在线诈骗的增加。它们将使人们能够更快、更轻松地在线访问所需的内容。在电子商务网站上购物、访问政府服务、管理资金——在许多国家/地区，所有这些活动都需要进行身份验证。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但随着身份验证工具变得越来越重要，它也将变得同样重要让任何需要它们的人都可以使用它们。数百万人无法使用数字工具。如果他们无法在线验证自己的身份，他们就会被排除在外。寻找更多方法为小型企业提供身份验证并为消费者提供数字身份，将为数百万人提供更多机会，并使数字经济更具活力、更具包容性和更安全。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这就是我们的愿景 - 使用这项技术使数字经济像当地农贸市场或咖啡店一样充满活力和热情。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;什么是身份验证？&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;其核心，身份验证工具可证明您的信息（姓名、地址、年龄、电话号码）有效且与您相关联。 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/361924724_What_is_a_Digital_Identity_Wallet_A_Systematic_Literature_Review&quot;>;许多不同的技术&lt;/a>;可用于实现这一目标。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;最常见的技术之一是身份验证验证软件，正如我之前提到的。例如，它可用于验证电子商务网站上的购买情况。该软件可证明您的 ID 正在使用您的登录名、密码和设备 IP 地址等数据，而无需您输入任何新信息。例如，Mastercard Identity 与旅游网站 FlightHub 合作，实时评估数百万笔在线预订，并与 Greenwood Bank 合作，确保吸引真正的客户。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;该技术的其他形式包括智能 ID 卡，内置芯片的物理卡可以存储您的身份证或医疗信息。您的手机上还可以保存驾驶执照或护照的数字版本。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;最后，Apple ID 和 Google Identity 等 ID 管理系统提供了一组您可以使用的登录凭据许多网站和服务。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;许多国家政府都大力依赖这项技术来实现服务现代化和数字化。最先进的国家之一是&lt;a href=&quot;https://e-estonia.com/solutions/e-identity/smart-id/&quot;>;爱沙尼亚&lt;/a>;，它为每个公民提供国家发行的电子身份证他们可以使用物理智能卡、移动应用程序或网站访问身份。这些电子身份证可用于购物、支付账单、签署合同、访问医疗记录，甚至在线投票。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;新加坡的 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.smartnation.gov.sg/initiatives /strategic-national-projects/national-digital-identity/&quot;>;Singpass&lt;/a>; 国民身份证应用程序可让人们连接到政府服务和许多企业。它使用生物识别指纹或面部验证，使人们能够在银行、食品配送和保险等各种数字活动中验证自己的身份。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;该领域的另一个主要参与者是印度，该国运营着全球最大的数字身份平台，称为 &lt;a href=&quot;https://uidai.gov.in/en/&quot;>;Aadhaar&lt;/a>;。公民可以使用二维码分享他们的身份信息，二维码保存在移动应用程序中，或者保存在实体纸质卡或塑料卡的背面。数以百万计的印度人已经使用 Aadhaar 在银行和移动电话提供商处开设新账户，访问他们以前无法获得的数字服务。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;万事达卡与印度和新加坡合作，确保这些 ID 系统的安全，确保人们的数据受到保护。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;数字包容之路&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;正如我们在印度所看到的，身份验证已迅速成为一种强大的工具传播数字和金融包容性。一旦有人可以在数字空间中分享他们安全且经过身份验证的身份，就会为他们带来更多机会。仍然需要做更多的事情，&lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.worldbank.org/digital-development/850-million-people-globally-dont-have-id-why-matters-and- What-we-can-do-about&quot;>;全球有 8.5 亿人&lt;/a>;没有任何正式的身份证件（数字或其他形式）。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一项旨在增加对身份证件工具的使用的小规模但有希望的努力正在发生德克萨斯州奥斯汀。在那里，&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statesman.com/story/news/healthcare/2021/05/10/austin-ut-dell-medical-school-help-homeless-health-care- services/4933352001/&quot;>;戴尔医学院&lt;/a>;正在开发一个新平台，帮助无家可归的人找回自己的身份。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在许多情况下，这些人的身份证件被盗，这使得找回身份变得困难让他们获得基本服务，例如政府援助和药物。这还导致他们在去医院时反复被误诊，因为提供者没有他们的病史，并且每次就诊时往往必须从头开始。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;戴尔医疗团队为人们创造了一种方法使用手机的生物识别技术（如指纹）验证他们的 ID。 (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/315541163_No_Digital_Divide_Technology_Use_among_Homeless_Adults#:~:text=%5D.%20...-,...,过去%203%20months%20%5B29%5D %20.&quot;>;研究人员注意到&lt;/a>;美国大多数无家可归者都拥有智能手机，将其用作获取所需资源并与朋友和家人保持联系的重要工具。）他们的 ID 可以在线或在他们的手机，数据使用分散的区块链分类账存储，因此不会丢失或被黑客攻击。至关重要的是，用户控制着自己的数据，并且必须明确同意共享数据。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;该项目仍在开发中，但表明身份验证有望带来更广泛的社会效益。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>; &lt;strong>;潜在陷阱&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;当然，技术只是故事的一部分。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;虽然 ID 工具在世界许多地方被广泛采用，&lt; a href=&quot;https://www.aclu.org/news/privacy-technology/digital-ids-might-sound-like-a-good-idea-but-they-could-be-a-privacy-nightmare&quot; >;有些人担心某些形式&lt;/a>;的数字身份证，例如驾驶执照的虚拟版本，可能会导致您的所有互动和交易在未经您同意的情况下被记录和监控。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;情况总是如此由于拥有宝贵的个人信息，许多人还对创建一个可以存储所有身份和健康数据的集中位置表示担忧，这为黑客创造了一个诱人的目标。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;必须使用身份验证来增强人们的能力建立对数字经济的信任——而不是削弱它。做到这一点的最佳方法是确保安全性、透明度和消费者隐私是这些技术的核心。我们需要确保人们可以控制他们的数据并批准对其的访问。以正确的方式引导 ID 工具，我们可以确保消费者和小型企业对数字交互的双方都具有信任。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;揭开 ID 验证的含义及其使用方式也很重要。爱沙尼亚和新加坡的身份证系统已经存在 20 年，而印度则在 14 年前开始实施。用于信用卡和借记卡交易的 3D 安全身份验证标准更为古老，于 1999 年推出。该技术几十年来已经证明了其价值。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;ID 验证可用于增强隐私，而不是剥夺隐私。例如，如果有人需要确认自己的年龄才能购买酒精饮料，他们不需要分享典型驾驶执照上的所有信息——姓名、年龄、地址、照片。使用身份验证技术，确认将作为一个简单的是或否的问题而存在——这个人是否超过 21 岁？这是人们需要分享的唯一信息。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;展望未来&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;我们都看到了 ID 软件在大流行期间的好处- 即使商家无法再面对面见到客户，也能让商业继续进行。继续磨练这项技术将有助于企业发展，并最终为人们和社区建立抵御能力，帮助他们抵御下一次危机。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;构建这项技术的工作仍在继续，因为我们很多人都看到了这一前景。更多的可能性，更多的事情已经发生。&lt;/p>;

&lt;span>;&lt;p>;Covid-19 为传统的分层指挥控制运营管理敲响了丧钟。取而代之的是一种新的模式，它能够更好地应对当今破坏性、不稳定和不可预测的环境。在这个模型中，决策责任广泛分散到最有意义的地方，从而可以根据不断变化的条件做出更快、更准确的决策。该模型建立在四个支柱之上——信任、人才、透明度和技术。瑞士跨国食品和饮料加工集团雀巢公司是一家公司在其工厂中采用这一理念的例子，并因此建立了弹性运营模式，帮助公司有效应对不利事件和挑战。&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div >; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/its-time-for-a-new-model-for-operations-management?language=es&quot;>;阅读西班牙语&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/its-time-for-a-new-model-for-operations-management?language=pt&quot;>;葡萄牙语&lt;/a>; &lt;/div >; &lt;p>;在相对稳定和可预测的时代统治了数十年的传统指挥与控制运营管理模式是否最终消亡了？我们看到的所有迹象都表明确实如此。在供需难以预测的后疫情时代，企业无法再整合高层决策。这样做与他们在快速而长期的破坏和波动的世界中所需的敏捷性、灵活性和速度背道而驰。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;虽然多年来它一直在慢慢侵蚀，但我们看到了命令和控制模型在新冠疫情期间的最终解体。在大流行造成的混乱和波动中，企业被迫放松决策控制。如果他们想生存，他们就必须这么做。当基本商品在没有任何警告的情况下突然被抢购一空，而关键原材料和零部件的供应迅速枯竭时，运营经理根本没有时间收集数据、分析数据，然后告诉运营团队如何应对。公司只需利用他们所掌握的最佳信息采取行动，而做出这些决策的合适人选就是那些最接近行动的人。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这些转变预示着一种新的运营管理模式的出现，在这种模式中，目标是通过将决策分散到组织中最有意义的点来优化运营对威胁和机遇做出响应的准确和快速程度。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;例如，战略决策跨职能或跨企业的影响和长期影响——例如分配资本、搬迁工厂、重新设计产品或进入新市场——最好由那些能够关注大局和更广阔视野的人来实现。更多战术决策的责任（在采购、物流、制造和分销方面）被转移到组织的其他地方，直到最合乎逻辑的点，即“橡胶与道路相遇的地方。”&lt;/p>; &lt;article-promo>; &lt;hbr -component type=&quot;promo&quot; is-insight=&quot;insight-center&quot; title=&quot;运营新时代&quot; dek=&quot;提高效率并增强弹性。&quot; cta-text=&quot;&quot; href=&quot;/insight-center/the-new-age-of-operations&quot;>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/insight-center/the-new-age-of-operations&quot; style= &quot;color:black;text-decoration:none&quot;>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; 洞察中心集合 &lt;/div>; &lt;h3>;运营新时代&lt;/h3>; &lt;div>; 提高效率并增强弹性。 &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hbr-component>; &lt;/article-promo>; &lt;p>;社会和政府组织称之为&lt;em>;辅助性&lt;/em>;，这就是原则社会和政治问题应在符合其解决方案的最直接或地方层面上得到处理。在运营中，这意味着，例如，最接近原材料分配作为投入的地方、产品制造的地方以及成品从工厂运往配送中心的地方——做出最佳决策所需的最准确和相关信息所在的地方。以这种方式分散运营决策是公司快速、适当地应对业务环境中的干扰和变化的能力的关键。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;对于大多数公司（无论大小）来说，这是一个深刻的转变。习惯于控制的运营领导者必须停止尝试微观管理和交火。他们需要放松控制，并授权其他人在情况发生变化时偏离现有计划或目标。过去向老板寻求指示和指导的经营者必须习惯于对公司发生的事情承担更大的责任和责任。由于中断来得如此之快，我们没有时间升级问题来获取如何应对这些问题的指导。与此同时，运营商需要明确自己可以做出哪些决策，以及应该何时何地寻求支持。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;推动转变的关键推动因素&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2 >; &lt;p>;要使这个模型发挥作用，需要四个重要的推动因素。所有这些都必须到位，以便领导者和运营商都能接受他们的新角色并以最高水平执行。缺少其中任何一个都将导致无法成功过渡。&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;1.信任&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;信任是该模型的基石。领导者必须相信他们所委托的决策者有能力并且将会为公司做出最好的决策。同时，运营商必须了解哪些问题需要升级以及如何升级。他们还必须相信，当遇到麻烦时，当信号告诉他们这是正确的事情时，他们不会因为做出改变计划的大胆决定而陷入困境。&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;2 。人才&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;仅仅给予人们做出决策和行动的自由是不够的。为了让人们能够轻松地做出决策，他们需要以前可能不需要（或不具备）的技能和能力。其中包括分析思维、当代市场情报、数字和数据专业知识、逻辑和推理、人际沟通等软技能，以及令人信服地捍卫自己决策的能力。因此，强有力的教育和学习努力必须伴随着决策授权。&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;3.透明度&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;领导者需要获取信息来了解其组织及其员工正在发生的事情，而运营商则需要所有相关数据来了解其决策和行动的影响。在这两种情况下，明确与公司期望的具体结果相关的正确指标至关重要。&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;4。技术&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;技术提供透明度——它使公司能够收集和传播领导者和操作员做好工作所需的信息。此外，强大的人工智能工具可以为各级决策者提供见解，充当教练或副驾驶，在某些情况下，在人类的监督下自行做出某些决策。而且，在学习环境中，技术对于帮助人们培养成功履行新职责所需的新技能和能力至关重要。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;雀巢&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;é&lt;/ strong>;&lt;strong>;以操作员为中心的组织的经验&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;信任、人才、透明度和技术是雀巢所谓的“以操作员为中心的组织”的核心，重点关注三件事：&lt;em>;授权&lt;/em>;（给予人们做出决定和行动的自由）； &lt;em>;参与&lt;/em>;（提供做出正确决策和查看结果所需的工具、数据和信息）；和&lt;em>;赋能&lt;/em>;（提供技能和能力建设，以便人们能够适当地利用他们获得的信息做出正确的决策）。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在 60 家雀巢工厂中，操作员拥有 iPad，通过 iPad他们可以扫描设备上的代码并查看与其相关的所有数据，包括安全功能和性能。他们还可以通过 iPad 控制设备的某些元件。这让操作员真正拥有自己设备的感觉，就像汽车上的仪表板让驾驶员有一种掌控车辆的感觉一样。雀巢还使用相同的设备来提供技能培养，使操作员能够获得持续增强能力所需的培训和信息。雀巢计划在其全球 350 家工厂中部署这种方法。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;通过以操作员为中心的组织模式，雀巢有效地创建了“&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdi-ama.biz/about” /&quot;>;任务导向的工作团队&lt;/a>;，这是国际竞争动力公司提出的概念。这些并不是真正独立的团队，而是了解决策边界的团队。例如，操作员意识到他们自己可以做出的决定以及何时需要将某些内容提交给直线经理或团队领导的限制。工厂经理知道何时何地需要联系特定地区所有工厂负责人的技术经理。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;为了让雀巢以操作员为中心的模式发挥作用，每个人都必须接受相同的文化和工厂内的价值观。当然，每个工厂所在国家或地区的社会和情感文化可能有所不同，因为雀巢在世界各地都有工厂。但对于公司员工来说，重要的是要了解，当他们进入工厂时，每个工厂都存在相同的商业文化和价值观——无论是在南非、马来西亚还是瑞士。通过这种方式，该工厂仍然受益于雀巢透明和诚实的价值观，而不强迫员工做与他们日常生活中正常行为不一致的事情。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Building Next -新世界的一代运营管理&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;公司运营的环境已经发生了明显的变化，这为命令与控制运营管理的棺材敲下了最后的钉子。由于公司不仅需要更快地做出反应，而且需要更快地进行预测，因此是时候建立一种基于信任、人才、透明度和技术的新运营模式了，该模式可以使他们能够加快决策速度，更有效地应对干扰和影响。不可预见的事件，并随着周围世界的发展，通过有机调整和重塑自身来继续再生。&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400; &quot;>;与上级建立联系的最有效方法之一是通过越级会议。简而言之，越级会议是您和老板的老板之间的一对一会议。这是一个与您可能没有经常接触或互动的上级直接沟通的机会。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;

&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot; aria-level=&quot;1&quot;>;&lt;b>;Enhance advocacy. &lt;/b>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;These meetings provide a platform to showcase accomplishments, &lt;/span>;&lt;a href=&quot;/2023/08/making-the-case-for-the-resources-your-team-needs&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;request the resources your team&#39;s needs&lt;/span>;&lt;/a>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;, and position yourself for further growth.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;Here&#39;s how to set up, hold, and leverage upward skip-level conversations for your own benefit — and the organization&#39;s as a whole.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;b>;Consider your culture.&lt;/b>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;For many of the professionals I coach, the mere thought of interacting directly with their skip-level manager can be downright intimidating. &lt;/span>;&lt;a href=&quot;/2021/05/stop-being-so-hard-on-yourself&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;Self-doubt creeps in&lt;/span>;&lt;/a>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>; and they worry about wasting a senior leader&#39;s time or coming off as “trying too hard.” These are valid concerns. Navigating a relationship with your manager&#39;s manager requires a delicate balance. Overstep, and you might be seen as bypassing your immediate supervisor.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;So tread carefully. Before you jump to schedule a skip-level, consider your workplace culture and how such a request would be perceived. Would it be welcomed — or seen as a threat? Some companies encourage open communication, while others may have more hierarchical structures. Reflect on past interactions and &lt;/span>;&lt;a href=&quot;/2023/07/overcoming-your-fear-of-giving-tough-feedback&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;feedback&lt;/span>;&lt;/a>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>; from your supervisor. Have they previously encouraged you to take initiative, or have they advised a more cautious approach? This can offer insight into how they might perceive your request.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;b>;Bring your boss in the loop.&lt;/b>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;If you do proceed, transparency is key. Choose a private time when you and your immediate supervisor can have a candid conversation. Explain why you believe a skip-level meeting would be beneficial for you and the team as a whole. Perhaps share how it will help you make informed decisions, lessen back-and-forth, or avoid last-minute surprises that use up valuable time and resources. Emphasize that your intention is not to undermine or bypass your manager, but rather to enhance your own understanding and alignment with the organization. Your boss will appreciate understanding the motivation behind your request.&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;Asking your boss questions like “How would you suggest I maximize the time?” or “Are there specific topics you think would be good for me to cover?” demonstrate you respect their expertise and position the request as a collaborative effort. If your boss expresses reservations or suggests waiting for a more opportune moment, listen. They may have insights about workplace politics that you aren&#39;t privy to.&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;b>;Define your goals.&lt;/b>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;Executives are busy and the last thing you want to do is disrespect your skip level&#39;s time by coming unprepared. So define your objectives in advance. Clarifying expectations? List out your current understanding and ask for affirmation or correction. Seeking guidance? Outline specific challenges or opportunities you&#39;re facing, the solution you&#39;re leaning towards, and ask how they&#39;ve dealt with similar situations in the past. Presenting information? Share a clear, concise summary and tailor the data to what would interest an executive, focusing on impact and results.&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;b>;Prepare powerful questions.&lt;/b>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;Regardless of what you want to get out of the conversation, your primary job is to listen. Follow the 70/30 rule: you should aim to speak 30% of the time, while allowing your boss&#39;s boss) to speak for 70% of the time. By listening more, you avail yourself of their experiences and insights and can more easily pick up on non-obvious nuances.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;Plus, you&#39;re forced to be concise and purposeful in your communication. Your speaking time becomes more about asking the right questions — ones that showcase your strategic thinking and derive clarity. For example:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot; aria-level=&quot;1&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;From your perspective, what do you believe are the most significant challenges our team should be addressing?&lt;/span>;&lt;/li>; &lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot; aria-level=&quot;1&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;How do you envision our team&#39;s role evolving given the company&#39;s long-term strategy?&lt;/span>;&lt;/li>; &lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot; aria-level=&quot;1&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;Based on your observations, how can I grow in my role to better support both our immediate team and the larger organization?&lt;/span>;&lt;/li>; &lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot; aria-level=&quot;1&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;What trends or changes in the market should we should be paying attention to or learning from?&lt;/span>;&lt;/li>; &lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot; aria-level=&quot;1&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;When you envision our company five or 10 years down the road, what are the key milestones you hope we&#39;ve achieved?&lt;/span>;&lt;/li>; &lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot; aria-level=&quot;1&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;Given the challenges our industry faces, what keeps you optimistic?&lt;/span>;&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;h2>;&lt;b>;Build the relationship.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;Building a genuine, meaningful relationship with anyone — especially your manager&#39;s manager — is about consistently demonstrating respect, integrity, and initiative. A little appreciation goes a long way, so always send a follow-up email after the meeting to thank your skip-level boss for their time. You might also summarize key takeaways or share how you plan to act on their guidance.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;Accountability matters. If you said you would circle back about a certain point or question, make good on your promise and show you&#39;re reliable. Also consider asking for a quarterly meeting and get it on the calendar as soon as possible.&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;Taking the time and effort to invest in upward relationships, such as those with skip-level managers, requires strategy, humility, and diligence. After all, leadership is not only about managing those below you, but also navigating the complexities above.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 19 Sep 2023 20:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[6 Actions CEOs Must Take During a Cyberattack]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/09/6-actions-ceos-must-take-during-a-cyberattack]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/09/Sep23_18_151541461.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;svengine/Getty Images&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;Many have warned over the years of the growing cyber threats and some have offered thoughtful advice for how to strengthen an organization&amp;#8217;s protection and resilience. Three questions can help determine whether enough has been done: First, have you participated in a cyber tabletop exercise recently? Second, do you have the contact information of your chief information security officer saved somewhere other than your work phone or computer? (Remember, if your company&amp;#8217;s networks suffer a ransomware attack, your work devices may be inaccessible.) Third, do you know your point of contact in government in case of a cybersecurity incident?&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/6-actions-ceos-must-take-during-a-cyberattack?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/6-actions-ceos-must-take-during-a-cyberattack?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;On May 7, 2021, a fateful Friday morning, Colonial Pipeline, the company running a critical fuel supply conduit for the eastern United States, experienced a ransomware attack. Unknown to the government, the company decided to shut down pipeline operations as they tried to determine what had happened and how bad the damage was. This move had severe consequences, transforming a cyber incident into a broader crisis within a few short days. Several thousand gas stations &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/05/12/gas-shortage-colonial-pipeline-live-updates/&quot;>;ran out&lt;/a>; of fuel and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/05/12/gas-shortage-colonial-pipeline-live-updates/&quot;>;gas prices&lt;/a>; increased to their highest levels in nearly a decade.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The halt of operations disrupted fuel supply chains, leading to panic buying and subsequent shortages at gas stations across multiple states. Reports of long lines and soaring prices at gas pumps illustrated the real-world implications of cyber threats, underscoring the interdependence of our physical and digital infrastructures. It also reinforced the public&#39;s run on gas stations.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In response to the escalating situation, the US government &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/05/11/fact-sheet-the-biden-harris-administration-has-launched-an-all-of-government-effort-to-address-colonial-pipeline-incident/&quot;>;took a series of decisive actions&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To calm the public&#39;s reaction, the Secretary of Homeland Security, Alejandro N. Mayorkas, and the Secretary of Energy, Jennifer Granholm, addressed the American public from the White House podium on May 11, 2021. The press briefing room is a small room in the West Wing brimming with about 50 reporters, television cameras running in the rear. This is where media outlets gather to hold the US government accountable for the American public by asking piercing questions of the most important issues that day — forming a formidable stage where essentially the entire world tunes in. The two secretaries outlined what the government was doing to mitigate the impact of the ransomware attack. They also &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/press-briefings/2021/05/11/press-briefing-by-press-secretary-jen-psaki-secretary-of-energy-jennifer-granholm-and-secretary-of-homeland-security-alejandro-mayorkas-may-11-2021/&quot;>;appealed&lt;/a>; to the American public that “there should be no cause for hoarding gasoline, especially in light of the fact that the pipeline should be substantially operational by the end of this week and over the weekend.”&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Lasting Implications&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;The geopolitical implications of the Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack were profound. In its aftermath, President Biden &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/07/09/readout-of-president-joseph-r-biden-jr-call-with-president-vladimir-putin-of-russia-2/&quot;>;engaged&lt;/a>; directly with Russian President Vladimir Putin, underscoring the severity of the incident. This crisis also underscored the urgent need for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dhs.gov/news/2021/07/20/dhs-announces-new-cybersecurity-requirements-critical-pipeline-owners-and-operators&quot;>;more robust&lt;/a>; cybersecurity measures, particularly for critical infrastructure like Colonial Pipeline. It served as a stark reminder that cyber threats are not confined to the digital world; they can quickly spill over, causing widespread disruption and societal impact. Ultimately, the Colonial Pipeline incident was a watershed moment.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This single incident is still having ripple effects today, redefining the roles that CEOs and industry leaders play, and will shape how we think about cybersecurity for years to come. It also points to some important questions business leaders need to ask themselves and highlights how a cyber incident can escalate quickly to a national security crisis requiring the attention of the US president. Just imagine what could have happened if another, similarly impactful ransomware attack would have occurred in the US in late February or early March 2022, only days after Russian troops further invaded Ukraine.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One ripple effect is how CEOs are thinking about their roles and responsibilities. The CEO of Colonial Pipeline, Joseph Blount, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cbsnews.com/news/colonial-pipeline-ceo-ransomware-hackers-senate-hearing/&quot;>;told&lt;/a>; members of Congress that paying the roughly $4.3 million in Bitcoin as ransom was “the hardest decision made in my 39 years in the energy industry.” Whether to pay the hackers and further fuel the criminal cycle of ransom demands or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.securitymagazine.com/articles/93062-ransomware-vicitim-travelex-forced-into-bankruptcy&quot;>;risk&lt;/a>; significant disruption or even bankruptcy is an impossible choice.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;CEOs have clearly taken notice. Few would enjoy the Road to Canossa to Washington and being in the Congressional and media spotlight. What have we learned from this and other key incidents over the past two years? Here are six recommendations for CEOs:&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;1. Be careful how you communicate with the public. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;A run on banks is the classic example how the public&#39;s reaction and group psychology can make a crisis worse. The run on toilet paper during the Covid-19 pandemic and the run on gas stations following the ransomware attack highlight that this problem is not limited to financial institutions.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Being careful how and what you communicate to the public does not mean avoiding communications with the public; on the contrary, it is a necessity. However, companies need to take a thoughtful approach. As the Colonial Pipeline incident illustrates, this includes companies that rarely have to engage with the public as part of their day-to-day operations but may need to unexpectedly from one day to the next.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;2. Coordinate with the government.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Colonial Pipeline&#39;s decision to shut off its pipeline system needed to happen fast, but there was arguably enough time to consult with US government experts. Taking the pipeline system offline meant that, regardless of whether it was infected, it would take days to restart, disrupting the actual fuel supply with all of its consequences that required government action. Coordination with the government is key to avoid a crisis becoming worse unintentionally.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;3. Know whom to contact.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;To make informed decisions quickly and coordinate with the right people, CEOs need to know who in the government is the right contact. Contacting NATO or the military, as some anecdotes over the years suggest, is not the right answer.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;With that said, sometimes the government doesn&#39;t make it easy for external parties to identify the appropriate person or agency, so the government has a responsibility to provide clarity.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;4. Have a plan in place and exercise it.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;This is perhaps the most crucial point as it provides a vehicle for accomplishing the others. In addition to developing and having a plan — ideally overseen by the CEO — the plan should be practiced at least once a year. Regular tabletop exercises will help company leadership and staff to build the “muscle memory” needed to respond effectively in a real crisis.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;5. Know your networks.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;A CEO should ideally have a high-level understanding of how a company&#39;s business IT networks and operational technology (OT) networks interact. If systems are air-gapped, there is no need to shut down the OT network if the compromise is limited to the IT network.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;With that said, the ransomware attack against Colonial Pipeline has demonstrated that even the paralysis of business IT networks can have significant impacts. If a company can no longer issue invoices, does not know who its customers are, or how to contact them, the actual impact can be as disruptive as actually bringing production to a halt. For any reader who has been stranded at an airport because an airline&#39;s IT system was suffering &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-airports-systems-idUSKBN18Q10R&quot;>;an outage&lt;/a>;, you have experienced the disruptive impact first-hand.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;6. Be humble and seek expert assistance.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Cybersecurity is a broad term covering a highly complex problem set. While there are commonalities and some software is used across sectors, the cybersecurity of pipelines is vastly different from cybersecurity in the context of the financial sector, hospitals, schools, or railways. One key insight after years of cyber incidents spanning sectors is to acknowledge the limits of everyone&#39;s knowledge, including cybersecurity experts&#39; knowledge. CEOs should therefore not hesitate to seek help from outside a company to help develop, test, or refine a plan or review existing processes and policies.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Beyond these high-level recommendations, there are plenty of other resources, including &lt;a href=&quot;https://carnegieendowment.org/specialprojects/fincyber/guides&quot;>;guides and checklists&lt;/a>; for CEOs, board members, and CISOs that are more detailed. The US government, namely its Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), also provides &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cisa.gov/stopransomware&quot;>;Stopransomware.gov&lt;/a>; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cisa.gov/shields-up&quot;>;Shields Up&lt;/a>; as resources designed for companies to use depending on their level of cybersecurity maturity.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Business Leaders as Guardians of Trust&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Beyond strengthening a company&#39;s cybersecurity out of self-interest and to avoid a national security crisis, business leaders also play a bigger role and can be considered guardians of trust in technology overall. Fundamentally, cybersecurity revolves around trust. Ransomware and numerous other cyberattacks exploit this trust. They leverage instances where someone clicks on an untrustworthy link, downloads an attachment from an unknown email address, or receives a malicious software update.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This principle extends to a company&#39;s trust in the technology underlying its systems, drawing geopolitics back into the discussion. The role of Chinese companies with respect to the 5G network has been a central topic for several years now. It marked the beginning of a broader debate about how to consider risk when investing in, purchasing, and using technologies. The US government&#39;s concerns over some technologies emanating from the People&#39;s Republic of China are &lt;a href=&quot;https://2017-2021.state.gov/5g-security/index.html&quot;>;well known&lt;/a>;. Simultaneously, in Brussels and other European capitals, an active &lt;a href=&quot;https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/speech_23_2063&quot;>;debate&lt;/a>; is underway about “de-risking,” influenced by the lessons learned from Russia&#39;s invasion of Ukraine and Europe&#39;s dependence.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Business leaders are at the center of this debate because they are the most important guardians of trust in technology.

That&#39;s about to change. Our research suggests we&#39;re on the brink of a major shift in consumption patterns, where truly sustainable brands — those that make good on their promises to people and the planet — will seize the advantage from brands that make flimsy claims or that have not invested sufficiently in sustainability. We&#39;re fast approaching this tipping point where sustainability will be considered a baseline requirement for purchase, and companies should prepare now.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To understand why, you need to know three things:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;Trust drives behavior and, ultimately, business outcomes.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Sustainability promotes trust, particularly among younger generations.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Younger generations will soon have most of the purchasing power in the US&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;1. Trust drives behavior and, ultimately, business outcomes.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;We study trust, and through our research involving hundreds of thousands of consumers and employees across more than 500 brands in 30 sectors, we&#39;ve measured the power of trust to drive a range of positive behaviors.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Trusting employees are more motivated to work, have lower rates of absenteeism, and are less likely to look for another job. Trusting customers are more likely to choose a brand over competitors, buy it again, and promote it.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;And highly trusted companies outperform others by up to 400% in terms of market value. These astonishing returns are realized because the marginal effect of trust on companies&#39; stocks grows as those companies earn trust. Our TrustID platform, &lt;a href=&quot;/2022/11/4-questions-to-measure-and-boost-customer-trust&quot;>;which measures company trust&lt;/a>;, shows that when a company&#39;s score moves from 30 to 31, it sees a roughly 3% increase in expected stock returns. When scores climb from 60 to 61, the increase is 6%.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;2. Sustainability promotes trust, particularly among younger generations.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;With such a high payoff for trust, the obvious question for organizations is: What creates trust in a brand? Our research shows that sustainability is a powerful driver. To understand why, you first must understand where trust comes from.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At its core trust is built when a brand or organization makes good promises and then delivers on them. They do this by conveying a positive&amp;nbsp;&lt;em>;intent&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em>;and demonstrating&amp;nbsp;&lt;em>;competence&lt;/em>;, respectively.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We surveyed more than 350,000 US customers aged 18 to 98 to gauge their perception of brands&#39; intent and competence. We measured intent using a combined score of two of the four factors we use to gauge trust: brands&#39; perceived humanity (empathy, kindness, fairness) and transparency (openness to sharing motives and relevant information in plain language). We measured perceptions of brands&#39; competence using a combination of the remaining two trust factors: capability (the quality of offerings) and reliability (consistent delivery).&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We found not only that sustainability stood out as a critical driver of intent, but that there was an important generational effect. While both younger and older consumers care about brands&#39; competence (their quality and consistency), younger consumers&#39; trust in brands — and their resulting purchasing behavior — is much more strongly influenced by the brands&#39; positive intent.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Consider these findings: When Gen Z and Millennial customers believe a brand cares about its impact on people and the planet, they are 27% more likely to purchase it than older generations are — a clear measure of sustainability&#39;s power to drive buying decisions in this group.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To zoom in a bit further, we can look specifically at the impact of humanity and transparency, the trust factors that comprise good intent.&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;When Gen Z and Millennial customers rate a brand highly on humanity, they are 15% more likely than older generations to spend more money with the brand and choose it over its competitors.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;When they rate a brand highly on transparency, they are 30% more likely than older generations to spend more money with it and 20% more likely to choose it over its competitors.&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;3. Younger generations will soon have most of the purchasing power in the US.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Forecasting experts calculate that the purchasing power of Millennials and Gen Z will surpass that of Boomers around the year 2030, with up to $68 trillion in wealth &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/21/what-the-68-trillion-great-wealth-transfer-means-for-advisors.html&quot;>;transferring&lt;/a>; from Boomers to these younger generations by the end of this decade.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To earn these younger consumers&#39; trust, it&#39;s clear that your brand&#39;s sustainability efforts must deliver on humanity and transparency:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;To highlight &lt;em>;humanity&lt;/em>;, demonstrate that your organization values and respects everyone, regardless of identity, background, or beliefs; respects and takes care of its employees; and puts the good of society and the environment above pure profit-making.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;To underscore &lt;em>;transparency, &lt;/em>;make sure it&#39;s easy for consumers to find straightforward information about your brand&#39;s impact on communities and the environment.&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;Organizations that do this well will reap the rewards. Take our findings among grocery stores as an example. &lt;a href=&quot;https://corporate.publix.com/about-publix/company-overview/mission-statement-guarantee&quot;>;Publix&lt;/a>;, one of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://corporate.publix.com/about-publix/company-overview/facts-figures&quot;>;largest-volume supermarket chains&lt;/a>; in the US, ranks #1 in customer trust of 11 peer grocery brands in our TrustID dataset, with humanity and transparency scores that are 75% and 47% higher than the number-two player, respectively. This difference is even more pronounced with Gen Z and Millennial customers, who score Publix as 83% and 95% higher than the number-two player, respectively. As a result, trusting customers are 54% more likely to purchase from Publix than from competitors. And this is even more pronounced with Gen Z and Millennial customers, who are 162% more likely to purchase from Publix than from competitors.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This trust, and the resulting customer loyalty, flows from Publix&#39;s visible investments in people and the planet. For example, Publix employees automatically receive quarterly stock benefits with the option to purchase additional shares. This makes Publix one of the largest employee-owned companies in the world, with over 200,000 employees who together own roughly 80% of the company. Publix also offers medical and tuition benefits as well as company-matched retirement plans, even for part-time employees. And employees receive regular reviews and raises for performance. These benefits help explain why voluntary turnover is only 5% — compared to the industry standard of 65%. It&#39;s no wonder that Publix is one of only four companies that has consistently landed on Fortune&#39;s “100 Best Companies to Work For” list for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://corporate.publix.com/newsroom/news-stories/04042023---publix-named-on-fortunes-100-best-companies-to-work-for-list#:~:text=LAKELAND%2C%20Fla.%2C%20April%204,the%20list&#39;s%20inception%20in%201998.&quot;>;26th consecutive year&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the planet side, Publix has actively invested in reducing food waste and promoting conservation. For example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://sustainability.publix.com/bakery/reducing-food-waste/&quot;>;in 2022&lt;/a>; the company sent more than 54 million pounds of food waste–manufacturing byproducts to farmers to turn into animal feed. That same year, its seafood department switched from polystyrene containers to returnable plastic totes, eliminating the use of 190,000 containers, while the deli department opted for lighter plastic bags and replaced plastic-wrapped cutlery sets with cutlery stations. Together, these moves eliminate over 360,000 pounds of plastic waste per year. Publix has also created its own line of sustainable food products under the “GreenWise” label, demonstrating its commitment to quality ingredients and strict animal welfare standards.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Let Publix&#39;s experience be a lesson: While the tipping point may not come until 2030, companies of all types should expand their sustainability efforts and communications &lt;em>;today&lt;/em>; to win trust — and customers — in the future.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 18 Sep 2023 21:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[How to Address the Supply-Chain Staffing Crisis]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/09/how-to-address-the-supply-chain-staffing-crisis]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/09/Sep23_18_1405943251.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;SasinT Gallery/Getty Images&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;Businesses are being impacted by a global skills shortage that is hampering manufacturing output and service delivery. In addition, the costs of producing materials, manufacturing goods, and providing services is rising due to labor costs. For small to medium enterprises, this means margins may be squeezed to the point to where they can no longer compete in today&amp;#8217;s hyper-competitive global marketplace. AI, robotics, digital transactions, and related automation provide the means for SMEs to enhance and build capabilities cost-effectively.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/how-to-address-the-supply-chain-staffing-crisis?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/how-to-address-the-supply-chain-staffing-crisis?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;Our global supply chains are stressed and under pressure, not only because of material shortfalls and shipping delays, but also due to labor shortages in key sectors. Skills shortages are now seen across all points of the supply-chain continuum, from sourcing to production, logistics, and delivery of goods and services. These gaps range from more manual tasks, such as warehouse order picking, to building and maintaining supply-chain systems. Technology is now advanced enough to fill in many of the gaps resulting from skills shortages but cannot do it alone. Rebuilding distressed supply chains will require a combination of technology and human skills development strategies.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Recruiting and keeping qualified workers is cited as the leading challenge for the 2,000 supply chain executives responding to a recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mhi.org/publications/report&quot;>;survey&lt;/a>; by MHI, a supply-chain industry trade association. A majority, 57%, state that hiring and retaining qualified workers is this year&#39;s greatest challenge, along with 56% struggling with ongoing specific talent shortages.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A range of industries sensitive to supply-chain vulnerabilities face labor shortages, led by durable goods manufacturing, wholesale and retail trade, and health services, according to an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.uschamber.com/workforce/understanding-americas-labor-shortage-the-most-impacted-industries&quot;>;analysis&lt;/a>; by of the US Chamber of Commerce. “Even if every unemployed person with experience in the durable goods manufacturing industry were employed, the industry would fill only around 75% of the vacant jobs,” the report states.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Sensitive Industries&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Executives and experts across affected industries agree it&#39;s urgent to solve skills shortfalls. Economic headwinds could soften employment demand, but acute staffing challenges are here to stay. Long-term factors such as an aging population and rapidly evolving technology skills gaps have become the new norm in staffing.&lt;/p>; &lt;article-promo>; &lt;hbr-component type=&quot;promo&quot; is-insight=&quot;insight-center&quot; title=&quot;The New Age of Operations&quot; dek=&quot;Improving efficiency and increasing resilience.&quot; cta-text=&quot;&quot; href=&quot;/insight-center/the-new-age-of-operations&quot;>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/insight-center/the-new-age-of-operations&quot; style=&quot;color:black;text-decoration:none&quot;>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; Insight Center Collection &lt;/div>; &lt;h3>;The New Age of Operations&lt;/h3>; &lt;div>; Improving efficiency and increasing resilience. &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hbr-component>; &lt;/article-promo>; &lt;p>;Manufacturing, in particular, represents “the point of the spear for the supply chain,” says Joe Walden, supply chain professor at the University of Kansas. “The labor shortages are hitting these folks the hardest. Regardless of the labor situation at other links in the supply chain, the shortage at this level impacts the availability of products for the consumer.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Within the logistics and distribution sector, “labor shortages are affecting the movement of goods,” says Yikun Shao, B2B North American supply chain leader for Alibaba.com. “Understaffing in logistics areas could lead to delayed shipping, delayed port loading and unloading, shortages of truck drivers and inventory stock-outs, difficulties in fulfilling customer orders on time, and a variety of other challenges.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This, in turn, adversely affects retailers and distributors downstream. “The high cost of labor mixed with ongoing demand for talent has become a detriment to merchants and their fulfillment processes,” says Kelton Kosik, head of supply chain at Ware2Go, a division of UPS. “Even as the strain on global supply chains has somewhat leveled out, a lack of talent during peak shipping seasons — like Cyber Monday and holiday sales events — and abilities to manufacture, move and deliver products can deflate or slow the economy.”&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Technology to the Rescue?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;To address these issues and automate many skills requirements, companies are ramping up their technology investments, the MHI survey shows. Close to three in four of supply chain executives, 74%, are increasing their investments in technology. A majority, 58%, cite artificial intelligence as their current leading area of investment, along with 54% looking to intelligent partner networks through the industrial Internet of Things.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, there is a catch-22 to deploying technology to resolve skills gaps — finding the skills up front to build and maintain AI and IoT systems. Supply-chain executives in the survey cite “lack of adequate talent” as a major hinderance to implementing technologies such as AI or IoT. “Ironically, talent is both a barrier and beneficiary when it comes to implementing innovative technologies,” the report&#39;s authors state. “Although deploying technology to automate routine tasks requires talent and manpower, once the technology is up and running it can free up workers to focus on higher-value tasks that require human involvement.” &amp;nbsp;Higher-value tasks may include working more closely with customers or clients, or coordinating and monitoring the flow of goods or services.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Time to Act&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;A combination of technology and proactive skills development efforts are needed for companies to attract and maintain the skills essential to supporting supply chains, as well as managing the technology to move things forward. Businesses can “increase the productivity of their workers by shifting them from repetitive tasks into roles that current technology is ill equipped to handle,” says Ricardo Ungo, professor and director of the Maritime, Ports and Logistics Institute at Old Dominion University. “This is a necessary step toward the digitalization of the whole chain, providing much needed visibility.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The following actions can help address skills shortages within supply chains:&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;&lt;strong>;Target technology investments.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;“Small to medium enterprises may have a more limited capital investment capability,” says, says Keith Fisher, the president of Honeywell Intelligrated. “They need to prioritize solutions with a clear return on investment. For example, by incorporating automation into parts of their business with high turnover rates, small businesses might see a greater impact on improved productivity for a more immediate ROI.”&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;&lt;strong>;Position technologies to pick up the slack for manual or repetitive tasks.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;All-encompassing automation approaches have been particularly helpful within organizations that require scaling up manual or repetitive work, such as distribution operations. Robots, for example, can be employed for scanning, assembling, and moving parts and products across distribution centers or warehouses. Robots, along with automatic storage and retrieval systems, and automation systems, can pick up the slack for many physically demanding jobs,” says Walden.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Such applications “help increase the productivity of distribution center workers by reducing significantly the time spent traveling from one location to pick products to another,” Walden adds. “Many of the automation concepts from automated picking to robotic pallet building to automated packaging are finally finding their way into distribution centers to offset the shortage of workers.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, comprehensive automation is “providing opportunities to integrate automation and robotics capabilities to fill labor gaps and manage mundane tasks like automated taping, label applications and scanning,” says Kosik. “Remaining talent can focus on more pressing tasks as well. Companies can use AI for better demand forecasting to ensure labor is being most efficiently allocated.”&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;&lt;strong>;Leverage technology to enhance the work of employees.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;At their core, supply chains will always be more than automated systems or algorithms exchanging information and purchase orders. “Supply chains are social networks,” writes Yossi Sheffi, professor of engineering systems at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in his book, &lt;em>;The Magic Conveyor Belt: Supply Chains, AI, and the Future of Work.&lt;/em>; “When it comes to making decisions in a supply chain, such as managing exceptions or escalating problems, the personal relationships between the people in the companies and both their customers and suppliers matter. Customer-supplier relationships can be complex “with a web of personal relationships.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Technology solutions should be purposed to enhance these relationships, as well as increase the productivity of workers at all levels.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, “the use of AI-augmented reality allows the employment of people with limited or no experience, because they are instructed by the software to do certain tasks,” Sheffi illustrates.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another emerging use case for AI filling in for skills shortages is autonomous trucking. For example, a “truck platoon,” led by a human driver in a lead truck, consists of electronically linked trucks that follow the movements of the lead truck. “Many companies are investing in developing Level 4 automated driving technologies to haul freight in long-haul routes, allowing them to overcome a lack of drivers caused by the aversion to the long hours away from home,” Lungo says.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;&lt;strong>;Train and develop employees&#39; skills to manage modern supply chains&lt;/strong>;.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Organizations should think of talent as also having its own supply chain, Sheffi advocates. This serves “to deliver the skills that people need to enable them to get and retain good jobs,” and from an employer perspective, “to ensure that companies have the skilled talent they need to produce affordable and valuable products and services for customers.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For small to medium-size businesses, training is essential. “Properly training teams to comprehend the technology&#39;s functionality and operate it effectively is vital,” says Fisher. “This not only helps them get the new technology operational more quickly but improves the adoption and, ultimately, the value of the investment.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In recent years, there has been a 15% increase in the number of organizations investing in upskilling and reskilling programs, with 41% focusing on working to prepare their workers for new tech-forward supply chain jobs, the MHI survey finds, Upskilling is essential to provide the education and training needed to boost skills across front-line supply-chain jobs. “For example, an operations manager who currently uses Microsoft Excel could be trained on a more sophisticated process to integrate supply chain information using new software for shipping and logistics management,” according to the report.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Today&#39;s supply chains have fragile links — companies are struggling to find and retain the workers they need to keep goods and information flowing. This is an opportunity to step up technology investments to automate as much of the work in production, logistics, and delivery of goods and services as possible. At the same time, technology alone cannot shoulder the scope of work needed. Employers also need to step up their skills acquisition and development, helping workers learn and work with technology to deliver results.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Technology can be employed to “support human workers in countless ways: fostering new capabilities and behaviors; improving operational performance; increasing safety; and supporting a more optimal work-life balance,” the MHI report advocates. “New workplace technologies are emerging that don&#39;t just augment human workers and perform mundane work. Rather, when used strategically, they have the ability to help individuals and teams upskill and reskill their capabilities.”&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 18 Sep 2023 21:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[How the Geeks Rewrote the Rules of Management]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/09/how-the-geeks-rewrote-the-rules-of-management]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;div js-target=&quot;video-player-page&quot; data-props=&quot;{&amp;quot;name&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;6337217510112&amp;quot;}&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>;&lt;/div>; &lt;div>;&lt;/div>; &lt;div>;&lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;span>;Loading... &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;script src=&quot;//players.brightcove.net/2071817190001/default_default/index.min.js&quot;>;&lt;/script>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;Andrew McAfee is a principal research scientist at the MIT Sloan School of Management. Throughout his career, he has done ground-breaking research on how digital technologies are changing the world. He is a prolific writer, a frequent contributor to HBR and other outlets, and a sought-after commentator on technological change &amp;#8211; especially, these days, on the potential of generative AI. He is the author of the forthcoming book &amp;#8220;The Geek Way: The Radical Mindset that Drives Extraordinary Results,&amp;#8221; the subject of much of this &amp;#8220;New World of Work&amp;#8221; interview. His big idea is that &amp;#8220;geeks&amp;#8221; have created not only the technology that&amp;#8217;s driving our future but also a management approach that defines contemporary corporate excellence. It&amp;#8217;sa somewhat contrarian view; after all, many of us have criticized Silicon Valley-run businesses as being male-dominated and lacking in empathy (even, of course, as we continue to use their products). What does McAfee mean by geek? He defines them as &amp;#8220;obsessive mavericks,&amp;#8221; people who become obsessed with hard problems and are willing to pursue unconventional solutions &amp;#8211; to avoid the dysfunctions that have traditionally plagued companies as they expand.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/how-the-geeks-rewrote-the-rules-of-management?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/how-the-geeks-rewrote-the-rules-of-management?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;The secret to success for many Silicon Valley tech companies isn&#39;t necessarily that they&#39;re ultra-nimble start-ups, or that they&#39;re led by tech-savvy geniuses. In fact, their success often has more to do with a specific type of corporate culture—and it&#39;s a culture that even companies not based on the US West Coast or focused on technology can adopt.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Andrew McAfee, a principal research scientist at the MIT Sloan School of Management, business leaders need to think more like geeks, but not the computer-based stereotype you may be familiar with. In his forthcoming book, &lt;em>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Geek-Way-Radical-Transforming-Business/dp/0316436704&quot;>;The Geek Way: The Radical Mindset that Drives Extraordinary Results&lt;/a>;&lt;/em>;, McAfee says geeks are nothing more or less than “obsessive mavericks” who are absolutely fixated on finding unconventional solutions to their business&#39; hard problems. You need them throughout the organization, not just at the top, and you need to entrust them with the power to make real changes.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For this episode of our video series “The New World of Work”, HBR editor in chief Adi Ignatius sat down with McAfee to discuss:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;Evolving a company&#39;s culture not by focusing on organizational structure, but on company norms&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Building organizations that can get things right, even when the person at the top of the org chart is wrong&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;The delicate balance of human judgment and evidence, data-driven insights.&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;“&lt;a href=&quot;/insight-center/the-new-world-of-work&quot;>;The New World of Work&lt;/a>;” explores how top-tier executives see the future and how their companies are trying to set themselves up for success. Each week, Ignatius talks to a top leader on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/company/harvard-business-review/&quot;>;LinkedIn Live&lt;/a>; — previous interviews included &lt;a href=&quot;/2021/10/microsofts-satya-nadella-on-flexible-work-the-metaverse-and-the-power-of-empathy&quot;>;Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella&lt;/a>; and &lt;a href=&quot;/2021/11/indra-nooyi-former-ceo-of-pepsico-on-nurturing-talent-in-turbulent-times&quot;>;former PepsiCo CEO Indra Nooyi&lt;/a>;.

My definition has two parts. For me a geek is somebody who gets obsessed with a hard problem and is willing to embrace unconventional solutions.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The patron saint of geeks is probably &lt;a href=&quot;https://amshq.org/About-Montessori/History-of-Montessori/Who-Was-Maria-Montessori&quot;>;Maria Montessori&lt;/a>;, who about 100 years ago got obsessed with the problem of how you educate young children best, and came up with the Montessori educational method, which is this radical departure from the industrial scale model of schools that was dominant then, and sadly still dominant now. Think about Maria Montessori when you think about a geek.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;How do you define the “geek way” that you&#39;re talking about in the book?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ANDREW MCAFEE:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The particular geeks I got excited about that led me to write the book were not educational geeks like Maria Montessori, they were business geeks. They were a group of people concentrated on—but not exclusive to—the West Coast of the US who got obsessed with this problem of, “How do we run a company in an age of really fast technological change and lots of uncertainty? And in particular, how do we avoid some of the classic dysfunctions of the internet era?”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The geek way is what they&#39;ve come up with. It&#39;s the business model, or the culture, or the set of norms that they&#39;ve settled on to try to accomplish that really hard goal.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It&#39;s sort of people who nerd out on, in this case, management, right? Processes of management.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ANDREW MCAFEE:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Obsessive maverick” is my preferred phrase for a geek. And the obsessive mavericks that I got really interested in were the ones who dove in, again, on this problem of, “How do we run a company and keep doing well in our markets and avoid the dysfunctions that seem to plague so many successful companies as they get older and bigger? How do we avoid those dysfunctions? How do we do something that&#39;s higher performing, more sustainable, and a better place to work?”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As I read the book, some of those attributes you talked about, they had to do with speed, they had to do with experimentation. Is this just another term for being digital, or for applying design thinking of the business? Are we talking the same thing here?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ANDREW MCAFEE:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;No, I don&#39;t think so. Adi, you remember &lt;a href=&quot;https://variety.com/2023/digital/news/jeffrey-katzenberg-quibi-proud-to-own-failure-1235623036/&quot;>;Quibi&lt;/a>;, right, the Jeffrey Katzenberg-led video startup? It was going to do short-form videos and it was going to change the way we consume entertainment.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Quibi was entirely digital. It was a completely digital enterprise. It was a miserable failure. They raised $1.75 billion. They shut down within 200 days of their launch. It was just a catastrophe. It was a completely digital enterprise.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Netflix is a geek company. They follow all four of my great geek norms of science, ownership, speed and openness. And I think their results speak for themselves.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Geek for me is entirely separate from digital. You can be a non-digital geek, and you can certainly be very digital and not geeky at all.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Quibi thing is an interesting example. I guess what was missing from your framework was the openness. You had a powerful guy who had been successful, who wasn&#39;t listening.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ANDREW MCAFEE:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Not listening to his peers, to his colleagues, to his advisor. He didn&#39;t appear to be a great listener, which is this kind of stereotypical trap that a lot of industrial-era companies fall into. Tech leaders also fall into this trap quite often. You become enamored of your own success and you really stop listening. It&#39;s incredibly common.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One of the things that is powerful, and that I respect about people like Reed Hastings at Netflix is that he was able to build a business that got important decisions right when he himself was wrong about them. In the book I talk about a couple of them.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He was dead-flat wrong about the utility of downloading to the Netflix app. He thought it wouldn&#39;t be very useful at all; it&#39;s incredibly useful.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He was wrong about the importance of kids&#39; programming for Netflix. And he admits this in the book, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/No-Rules-Netflix-Culture-Reinvention/dp/1984877860&quot;>;&lt;em>;No Rules Rules&lt;/em>;&lt;/a>; that he wrote with Erin Meyer.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He successfully worked hard on building a company that would correct him, the boss, the high status prestigious person at the top of the organization. It&#39;s part of this great geek norm of openness that I talk about. How do you build a company that will get it right when the person at the top of the org chart is wrong? Man, that&#39;s a hard problem.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It&#39;s a hard problem. And I&#39;m sure some people are going to read your book and think, “Hang on, a lot of these companies we&#39;re talking about are Silicon Valley startups or somewhere in that realm.” The popular perception is these are not cultures that you necessarily want to emulate. They&#39;re often male-dominated bro-cultures. The boss frequently is an overly demanding bully. How do you square all this?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ANDREW MCAFEE:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There clearly is some of that going on in the Valley. There are toxic cultures. You mentioned the bro-culture. I would say that &lt;a href=&quot;/2022/11/why-startups-should-embrace-radical-transparency&quot;>;Theranos&lt;/a>; is one of the most toxic cultures I&#39;ve ever heard about, and it was headquartered in Silicon Valley.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I don&#39;t think those are geek companies at all. They might be in the right geographic location, but they&#39;re not following the geek way, which is about these norms and about creating a culture that is fast-moving, free-flowing, argumentative, autonomous, evidence-driven, and pretty egalitarian. That&#39;s the goal of the geek way.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Now you point out some of these companies that I do think follow the geek way that are still too pale, stale, and male. That&#39;s absolutely true. The evidence is pretty clear on this. I hope that gets better over time.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But Adi, you said something that I disagree with, that a lot of these cultures that are not good places to work. That&#39;s true in some cases. Remember when LinkedIn did its top attractors survey, I believe in 2016, they said, look, we&#39;re just going to look at objective criteria. We&#39;re going to look at which company pages get viewed the most often by LinkedIn members. Which companies get the most interest from LinkedIn members, the most applications, and where do people stick around when they take their first job?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The top 11 attractors in the LinkedIn list were all companies headquartered on the West Coast in the industry that we loosely call tech. The geek culture is an extremely attractive culture to work in.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some of these founders, entrepreneurs who got into whatever they got into because they wanted to make the world a better place, Serge and Larry in their garage trying to systematize our access to all the world&#39;s information, these great ideals: when they are actually running companies, they not only are trying to run a company, but they become killers, wanting to wipe out the competition, to foster monopolistic practices, to just grab as much market share as possible.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ANDREW MCAFEE:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Is any of this new? Within the businesses? No, I&#39;m serious. Were the businesses of previous eras cuddly? Did they want their competitors to succeed? Were they trying to rise all boats?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Capitalism is an inherently competitive process. These companies are very, very good performers. If you want to use the adjective “killer” for them, I think that&#39;s by design. You&#39;re not in business not to succeed. You want to grow your market share. You want to grow your profits, you want grow. That is often at the expense of somebody else.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I think it&#39;s for the courts to decide whether they meet the definition of monopolist. It&#39;s a word we toss around a lot. The courts so far have tossed out a lot of the recent lawsuits against some of these giant tech companies. I don&#39;t think they meet the definition of monopolist. In general, for a lot of these companies, the competition is one click away.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;And is Tesla a monopolist in the auto industry? You simply can&#39;t make that case. SpaceX has become pretty close to a monopolist in the rockets and satellites industry, but they didn&#39;t start that way, and they&#39;ve become so large and influential because they do the job better.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Let&#39;s talk about companies that are doing it right. This is not universally for digital companies. Some follow the geek way, as you&#39;ve laid it out, some don&#39;t.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;How many companies, large, small, digital, otherwise live into these principles, do you think?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ANDREW MCAFEE:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I think that&#39;s a really interesting question, and I don&#39;t have a great way to answer it yet. Because the only way that I can think to answer it is to administer a survey to everybody and get them to fill it out. That&#39;s just not going to work.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But you can look at what we know about the cultures at these companies. You can also look at the fantastic &lt;a href=&quot;https://sloanreview.mit.edu/projects/culture-500-introducing-the-2020-culture-champions/&quot;>;Culture 500 research that Don and Charlie Sull&lt;/a>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sloanreview.mit.edu/projects/culture-500-introducing-the-2020-culture-champions/&quot;>; did&lt;/a>;, published in a competitor magazine of yours, &lt;em>;Sloan Management Review&lt;/em>;. They grabbed all the LinkedIn reviews and put them through a machine-learning analysis to see what companies&#39; own employees said about them.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Three areas I was most interested in were execution, agility, and innovation. And wow, the scores for companies clustered on the West Coast, clustered in Silicon Valley, clustered in industries that we call high-tech, those scores are off the charts. There&#39;s not any real competition for them.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There&#39;s something brewing on the West Coast in industries that we label (for reasons that I don&#39;t like very much) high-tech. There&#39;s something brewing that&#39;s new, that is different than what&#39;s going on elsewhere in the economy, and it&#39;s pretty demonstrably powerful. The label that I hang on that is the geek way.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Was Steve Jobs a geek, and did his Apple follow the geek way or was that a different model?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ANDREW MCAFEE:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Jobs has some really classic non-geek characteristics. He believed that he knew best. He had a very, very large ego. He also screamed at his subordinates all the time, which I think is absolutely not what an open leader does.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, I interviewed Eric Schmidt for the book, and I brought this up to him and he said, “Look, I was on Apple&#39;s board for a while. I knew Steve pretty well.” He said Steve was a tough person in all those ways, but he learned that if you want to stay on top, you have to listen to the people around you. You have to stop thinking that you have all the answers.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We see a really clear example of that with the App Store. Jobs did not want to open up his beautiful, perfect walled garden iPhone to outside developers. He had to be talked into it. He eventually realized that he was wrong about that. There is a little bit of that openness going on.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One thing that Apple is pretty fanatic about, as I understand it, is they make decisions based on evidence. And whether or not that&#39;s a huge AB testing infrastructure is one thing. Apple loves to demo features, and gets everybody in the room to look at this and say, for example, is it better to have blurry portrait photos where you can adjust the blur before you take the picture? The instant they did a demo, they had the answer to that question. They did not sit around and argue from their different points of view. They said, OK, let&#39;s run an experiment. Let&#39;s do a demo here. That&#39;s an extremely geeky approach.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One of the interesting things about Jobs, and certainly something he would&#39;ve said about himself, he did say about himself, was that he didn&#39;t, and that one shouldn&#39;t, slavishly follow the focus groups. People don&#39;t know what they want.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It&#39;s a combination of let&#39;s get input, but there is a lot of personal touch, personal feel. It&#39;s like &lt;em>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Moneyball-Art-Winning-Unfair-Game/dp/0393324818&quot;>;Moneyball&lt;/a>;&lt;/em>; versus the old school. Maybe the answer is a combination of skills.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ANDREW MCAFEE:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Absolutely. And Ted Sarandos, who&#39;s the co-CEO of Netflix, says their decision-making is pretty algorithmic. It&#39;s 70-30 algorithmic versus human judgment. But he said, if anything, the human judgment is on top, if that makes any sense.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I think that makes a ton of sense. This norm of science that the geeks are pretty passionate about, it&#39;s not just dry analysis and do whatever the data says. That&#39;s an inaccurate caricature.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Science is about settling arguments with evidence. It&#39;s a ground rule for how you&#39;re going to come to a decision. You&#39;re going to do a test, you&#39;re going to do an experiment. You&#39;re going to sit around in a group and argue about it. And if you can&#39;t agree, evidence is going to settle this issue.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Science is this inherently, deeply social, deeply argumentative process with a ground rule. Evidence is the queen here. That&#39;s what we&#39;re going to follow. And a lot of the geek companies that I respect do that as naturally as breathing.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One of the examples in your book of geek culture triumphing is Microsoft, and specifically when &lt;a href=&quot;/2021/10/microsofts-satya-nadella-on-flexible-work-the-metaverse-and-the-power-of-empathy&quot;>;Satya Nadella&lt;/a>; came in and rekindled that early success and more. Talk a bit about what he got right, particularly in the framework that you&#39;ve created.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ANDREW MCAFEE:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Can you think of a more impressive corporate turnaround story in living memory?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;No. Microsoft went from the tech company we liked least to maybe the one we like best.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ANDREW MCAFEE:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;And if you were an investor, you really didn&#39;t like it for about a decade. The stock price was flat as a corpse&#39;s EKG. And then Nadella took over, and it&#39;s become one of the most valuable companies in the world. It&#39;s an astonishing comeback story.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I got to interview Nadella for the book. He&#39;d made brilliant strategic moves, a bunch of them. You have Microsoft embracing open source, wow.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But I was interested in the cultural changes that he made. And he did a couple things that I think are straight out of the geek playbook. Some of them are obvious. He embraced agile development methods as widely and quickly as possible inside Microsoft. He did a couple things to reduce the sclerotic bureaucracy that was in place at Microsoft, which was just hamstringing their ability to do anything important out there in the world.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One of the brilliant things he did was say, “Look, you cannot own a digital resource inside Microsoft. You cannot own the data. You cannot own the code.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;And what he meant by that was you can&#39;t be the gatekeeper. You can&#39;t say yes or no to other groups who might want to use it. With that one simple move, he said to the company, “Look, if the AI group wants to go grab all of the GitHub code to train up a model to help provide assistance to programmers, you don&#39;t have to ask permission. Just go do that, subject to all the right constraints and safeties on it.” Man, that is an astonishingly good bureaucracy-reduction mechanism.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Maybe the deepest thing that Nadella did was that he pulled off this amazing feat of helping Microsoft become a less defensive organization. What I mean by that was, he said in his interview with me, “We had a culture where it was not OK to be wrong, to show any weakness, to not hit your numbers, to not be the smartest person in the room.” He said, “We just had that culture and it had to change.” He did a number of really brilliant things to move from a culture of defensiveness to a culture of openness.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When I used to hear this word, “vulnerability”, in connection with leadership or business, I thought it was just a buzz phrase, hand wavy, nonsense business. The company is not a therapy group. It&#39;s not there so you can sit around feeling vulnerable all the time. I was just wrong.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Now, the company is not your therapy group. However, a successful company needs to be a place where it&#39;s okay to be wrong, to fail, to not have the answer, to show that you&#39;re uncertain. Nadella helped get Microsoft down that path, and it was an absolutely fundamental thing to do.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I also interviewed Yamini Rangan, who&#39;s the CEO of HubSpot here in Cambridge, who took over a culture and has strengthened it through a really difficult time through the pandemic.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She discussed one of the things she learned and that she was good at was saying in this unbelievably uncertain time of the pandemic where tech companies were shrinking. It was all weird. She said to a lot of her constituencies, “Look, I don&#39;t know. I don&#39;t know what the future holds here. I&#39;m going to be honest with you.” She also shared her board performance review with her direct reports, not just the good parts, but the stuff that she needs to work on too. These are all just great moves to start to show the rest of the organization it is okay not to be perfect, not to put on the brave front, not to be winning all of the time.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Jack Welch&#39;s autobiography was called &lt;em>;Winning&lt;/em>;, and it epitomized this industrial era view of what you have to do all day every day. I love the geek view, which is, “Hey, man, we&#39;re going to launch some rockets and they are going to blow up. Now, we&#39;re not going to kill anybody, but we&#39;re absolutely going to launch some rockets that are going to blow up on the launchpad.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Bezos said a few years back in the shareholder&#39;s letter, “We are incubating multi-billion dollar failures inside Amazon right now. That&#39;s appropriate for a company of our scale.” And you look at Alexa and I think maybe he was right about that.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But the point is that this obsession with winning and being on top and being right and being dominant, that has to go away.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I want to get to audience questions. One came from Shabana in Pakistan. What kinds of organizational design, organizational structures, do you need to foster this sort of geek culture?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ANDREW MCAFEE:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I don&#39;t think org structure is the key because the companies that I surveyed have very, very different org charts. They also have very different formal practices.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Netflix is fairly famous for having the no-vacation-days policy. Amazon has extremely strict vacation policies for different levels of employee.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I think it&#39;s not a matter of the org chart or the org structure that you have. It&#39;s not so much a matter of how formal a lot of your policies are. It&#39;s a matter of your norms. I love that word and I use it in the book all the time.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A norm is a behavior that the people around you expect. Maybe it&#39;s written down in the employee manual. Very often it&#39;s not. It&#39;s community policing. It&#39;s what the people around you expect. If you go out of line and violate a norm in a community, you will know that fairly quickly and you will either come back into line or you&#39;re just not going to stick around very long.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you can work on these norms of science, argue about evidence, of ownership, push authority and decision-making down to an uncomfortable degree, speed, iterate, don&#39;t plan, don&#39;t analyze, build stuff, get feedback, learn from reality and then openness. Don&#39;t be defensive. Be willing to pivot. Be willing to admit that you&#39;re wrong. They show a little vulnerability. Those are the norms that are critical for the geek way.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So Bob from our audience is asking, “Is the stack of books on your right your reading list for the week?”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ANDREW MCAFEE:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These are from all over the place. But there was a stack of books that I kept referring to when I was writing &lt;em>;The Geek Way&lt;/em>;, and they were not business books. I am sorry to admit this as a business book writer.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;They were books from this relatively new field called cultural evolution, which gets at this fundamental question, “Why are we the only species on the planet that builds spaceships?” Nothing else is even close. We&#39;re really the only ones out there. The octopuses are not going to do it. The ants, the bees, the chimpanzees are not going to do it. Why are we humans the only spaceship-building species on the planet? This field of cultural evolution to me has come up with the best answer to that question, which is we are the only species that cooperates intensely with large numbers of people that we&#39;re not related to. We are the species that learns the quickest, that improves its toolkit, its technologies, its cultures most rapidly over time.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;You can take that and put that to work in a company. A company is a large group of mostly unrelated people. And the goal of a company is to improve its culture, its artifacts, its technologies, its practices over time. The goal of a company is to practice very rapid cultural evolution. Now that we know a bit about how cultural evolution happens, we can put those insights to work.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There&#39;s this massive unexplored opportunity to take the insights from this field and put them to work inside the company. I think it&#39;s so massive because I haven&#39;t heard anybody talk using cultural evolution&#39;s terms inside even very geeky companies. This is very, very new stuff. And I think &lt;em>;The Geek Way&lt;/em>; is the first applied business book of cultural evolution.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I think I just figured something out. You&#39;re a total geek.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ANDREW MCAFEE:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We&#39;ve been working together for years. It took you this long to realize this?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But the thing that I got obsessed with was that in my career, I&#39;ve spent a lot of time in the (I hate these labels) old economy and the new economy, lots of industrial-era incumbents, and then a lot of companies clustered in the tech space, clustered on the West Coast.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For my whole career, I have been trying to pattern match and figure out what the deep differences are between the two. Is it the foosball tables? Is it the hoodies? Is it bringing your dog to work? No, obviously not.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Where the action is in the economy, where the excitement is in the economy, what are they doing differently? And &lt;em>;The Geek Way&lt;/em>; contains my answers to that kind of career long, geeky, head scratching question.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Let&#39;s get practical for our viewers who aren&#39;t in classically geeky cultures. How can they apply the approaches you&#39;re championing, at their own companies?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ANDREW MCAFEE:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Here are a few things you can start doing tomorrow that are extremely geeky practices that will get some traction. When you&#39;re in charge of your group or you&#39;re a team member or you&#39;re leading a team, if you say things like, “Oh, that&#39;s a good point. I hadn&#39;t thought of that. Let&#39;s go that way,” or, “Oh, I was wrong about that. That&#39;s really good to know,” you have just demonstrated openness and vulnerability instead of classic defensiveness.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;That&#39;s hard to do. Human beings are inherently defensive people, we don&#39;t like being shown to be wrong in public. It&#39;s deeply uncomfortable. But if you model that behavior, it will start to spread. And I&#39;ve seen geek leaders do that over and over.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;You can start to push decisions and responsibility down to a place that makes you uncomfortable, and to get out of saying, “Just run that by me first,” or, “Make sure I&#39;m included on that,” and try to get rid of the hard and soft bureaucracy that gets in the way.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I was talking to &lt;a href=&quot;http://robots.stanford.edu/&quot;>;Sebastian Thrun&lt;/a>;, who&#39;s an alpha geek in all kinds of things, and he said, “One of the things I try to get my teams to do is stop so much communicating.” He had this great image. He said, “A team works on something, and then they run it up the flagpole.” He said the really natural tendency is for the people at every layer of the org chart to add something to that because they want to be part of the solution, they want to be part of this winning idea. By the time that idea gets back down to the originating team, it&#39;s unrecognizable. Get out of that business.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Again, this is uncomfortable stuff to do, but it&#39;s a big step toward the geek way. And then finally, you can start to say, “How are we going to make this decision? Can we agree on what evidence we&#39;re going to look at to make this decision?”, as opposed to saying, “Well, I&#39;m the boss,” or, “I got it right last time, so you should listen to me this time,” all these other ways we have to make decisions, credentials, hierarchy, charisma, excellent PowerPoint, all these things: get out of that business and start asking for the consensus on, “How are we going to settle this argument? What evidence are we going to look at?” These are all super geeky practices you can start doing tomorrow.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Here&#39;s another audience question. This is Lori from North Carolina, and it&#39;s another very practical question: how can organizations get leaders to unlearn the idea that failure is bad?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ANDREW MCAFEE:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is a super hard question, and I fall back on something that I learned from &lt;a href=&quot;/2020/01/the-essential-clayton-christensen-articles&quot;>;Clay Christensen&lt;/a>;: one of the things Clay taught me is that managers are voracious consumers of theory. He said, “Don&#39;t be afraid to tell them why this needs to change, what the principle, what the framework is.” And he said, “If you want to get people to change, there&#39;s a kind of a tripod. There are three things you have to do over and over again more until you&#39;re absolutely exhausted.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First of all, tell them a vivid story. We humans respond to narratives. Second, give them some evidence, give them some numbers to show that it works. And third, give them a theory. Explain why it works. You&#39;ve just got to go through all three of those legs.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Why can&#39;t we make decisions this way? I&#39;m a pretty smart person. I reached this place on the org chart because of my excellent judgment. What do you mean we should be relying a lot less on my judgment?” Again, three part answer to that question, keep iterating on it. It is not an easy process.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I think a lot of companies who get interested in what Silicon Valley does differently or might want to embrace the geek way are going to find it hard going because a lot of it is unnatural and uncomfortable. Challenging your boss in a meeting in most circumstances is uncomfortable, until it becomes a norm, until it becomes what people around you expect.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I can&#39;t let you go without talking a little bit about generative AI. You have an article in the next issue of HBR on how businesses can most effectively capitalize on the technology. What is your thinking, your quick overview, on the utility of GenAI, and its likely impact on, let&#39;s say, the white-collar workforce?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ANDREW MCAFEE:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The more I think about GenAI, the more I think we&#39;re underestimating its impact. It is so general, it is so powerful, it is improving so quickly, it&#39;s leading to so many complementary innovations. I have never seen the computer science geeks, the economic geeks, and the business geeks all get so excited about anything in my career, which is actually a quarter-century long by this point.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Generative AI is going to change the business world. It&#39;s probably going to do it quicker than a lot of us are thinking, and waiting around on the sidelines and not being part of that transformation is a deeply lousy strategy: get a plan together and then just go do stuff.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;All right, Andy, we&#39;ve run a little bit long, so we&#39;re going to cut you off here. I could talk all day with you about all these topics, and our audience is clearly into it and engaged. Thank you very much for being on the show.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ANDREW MCAFEE:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Adi, always a pleasure. Thank you for having me.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 16 Sep 2023 01:25:02 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[A More Impactful Strategy for Sustainable Investing]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/09/a-more-impactful-strategy-for-sustainable-investing]]><description>&lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/09/Sept23_15_1589828250.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;Hiroshi Watanabe/Getty Images&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;The effectiveness of sustainable investing has been challenged, with critics like Tariq Fancy describing it as a mere placebo. Amidst rising skepticism and stricter disclosure requirements, a deeper dive reveals that traditional methods of influencing companies, namely &amp;#8220;voice&amp;#8221; (shareholder engagement) and &amp;#8220;exit&amp;#8221; (portfolio screening), are not exhaustive. Through a comprehensive review of over 3,500 research papers, a new approach &amp;#8212; &amp;#8220;field building&amp;#8221; &amp;#8212; emerges. This tactic acknowledges the interconnected web of stakeholders around companies, termed &amp;#8220;fields&amp;#8221;, that profoundly influence corporate behavior. By reshaping these fields, investors can indirectly drive sustainable change in firms. Five tactics are highlighted: (1) Shifting other investors&amp;#8217; evaluation of issues, (2) Sharing expertise, (3) Delegitimizing certain business activities, (4) Establishing voluntary standards, and (5) Supporting regulatory changes. While promising, field-building presents challenges like profitability and political exposure. Yet, by embracing this expanded toolkit, investors can magnify their positive impact and appeal to an increasingly conscious investment clientele.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/a-more-impactful-strategy-for-sustainable-investing?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/a-more-impactful-strategy-for-sustainable-investing?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;Whether sustainable investors can have a positive impact on business and society has been the center of debate in recent years. One major obstacle holding sustainable investing back from maximizing its impact is that most investors operate with too narrow of an understanding of how impact can come about. Most investors believe they have two primary ways to influence companies. First, there&#39;s portfolio screening, often termed “exit.” In this approach, investors shift capital from non-sustainable to sustainable companies. The second strategy is shareholder engagement, frequently called “voice.” Here, investors directly urge companies to adopt more sustainable practices through means like meetings, shareholder proposals, or voting.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But in our research, we have found that some unconventional investors go beyond the “exit” versus “voice” dichotomy. We have mapped their activities through a &lt;a href=&quot;https://eur03.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fonlinelibrary.wiley.com%2Fdoi%2Fepdf%2F10.1111%2Fjoms.12957&amp;amp;data=05%7C01%7Cmarti%40rsm.nl%7C5617faa4f4e6474822f608dbae59fdb1%7C715902d6f63e4b8d929b4bb170bad492%7C0%7C0%7C638295474207071901%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=qcr%2FaLPS2qF%2FkUPnG%2FDtSQEMQjLx0nl%2BrNN2UuL8oD8%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0&quot;>;systematic review of research&lt;/a>; for which we screened more than 3,500 research papers on sustainable investing. Based on this review and conversations we&#39;ve had with practitioners, we put forth a case for a third, potentially more impactful sustainable investing strategy: &lt;em>;field building.&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Field building works because companies are always embedded in fields. The term “fields” is closely related to industries, but broader. Fields encompass both companies (eg, oil and gas companies) and the stakeholders with which companies interact most frequently (eg, investors, regulators, or media). Through these interactions, actors within fields develop assumptions, norms, and rules that shape the behavior of companies within a field. In short, a field captures those parts of the external environment of a company that have the most direct influence on a company. Field building means that investors influence companies by changing the (1) stakeholders and (2) assumptions, norms, and rules that surround companies, thereby exerting their influence on companies indirectly.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We have found five tactics for field building that sustainable investors can use to increase their impact.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Shifting other investors&#39; evaluation of issues&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;As a first tactic for field building, investors can shift other investors&#39; evaluation of environmental and social issues. By publicly and continuously highlighting these environmental and social issues, an investor can raise attention to environmental and social issues among other investors and thereby motivate these other investors to influence companies.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This tactic is particularly relevant for investors that do not have enough assets under management or status to directly influence companies. By influencing larger investors with more direct influence on companies, investors can change the fields in which companies operate in ways that expose companies to more pressure for corporate sustainability.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Dutch shareholder “FollowThis” has used this first tactic very successfully since 2014 to influence oil and gas companies. FollowThis submits shareholder proposals on behalf of over 10,000 individuals who have bought shares of oil and gas companies. While FollowThis has neither the assets under management nor the elite status to be taken very seriously by oil and gas companies themselves, their approach has been very successful in influencing big Dutch pension funds. Some pension funds followed suit after their initial refusal to support FollowThis led to protests from beneficiaries and negative media attention — including ABP, the largest Dutch pension fund with over 500 billion Euro assets under management.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Sharing expertise with other investors&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;A second tactic for field building is to share expertise with other investors. Investors that are new to sustainable investing often struggle with the inherent complexity of environmental and social issues, and know neither what demands are realistic nor how to raise their demand in ways that make business sense for companies. By making private information publicly available, investors can empower other investors to influence companies. When other investors know more about sustainability, this creates additional pressure for corporate sustainability within the fields in which companies operate.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The international asset manager Robeco has used this tactic since August 2022, when it made its SDG framework openly accessible. This framework assesses the degree to which over 2,900 companies advance or undermine the 17 sustainable development goals (SDGs). Having used the framework internally since 2018, Robeco&#39;s decision to make their SDG framework open access not only establishes Robeco as a leader in that space. Access to this framework can help less experienced investors incorporate sustainability into their investment decisions.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Delegitimizing certain business activities&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;A third tactic for field building is to delegitimize business activities that are particularly harmful for the environment and society. Companies can only operate in fields in which key stakeholders — such as policymakers, consumers, suppliers, or the media — see their activities as legitimate. If these stakeholders start to see certain business activities as illegitimate, it can create existential problems for companies. Given these dynamics, investors that publicly problematize certain business activities can play a key role in changing widely shared assumptions about whether these business activities are legitimate or not.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Investors within the fossil fuel divestment movement have used this tactic very successfully. Since 2012, over 1,500 investors have publicly announced they would divest from fossil fuel companies, including the city of Chicago in 2022 and the Church of England in 2023. Proponents of the divestment movement make clear that, “&lt;a href=&quot;https://eur03.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgofossilfree.org%2Fusa%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2015%2F03%2FFossilFreeFrequentlyAskedQuestions.pdf&amp;amp;data=05%7C01%7Cmarti%40rsm.nl%7C5617faa4f4e6474822f608dbae59fdb1%7C715902d6f63e4b8d929b4bb170bad492%7C0%7C0%7C638295474207071901%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=AQBOvhTOgqMHpVyU1VprefUIR%2Foa%2BwCWQxS8Ns1s31g%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0&quot;>;Divestment isn&#39;t primarily an economic strategy, but a moral and political one&lt;/a>;.” They realize that their main influence does not come from increasing the cost of capital of fossil fuel companies in the short term, but by gradually changing public opinion about fossil fuel companies. Research shows that the divestment movement has influenced the views and actions of important stakeholders, including banks that have withheld credit from fossil fuel companies and students who have committed to not work for fossil fuel companies.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Establishing voluntary standards&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;A fourth tactic for field building is to establish voluntary sustainability standards. Voluntary standards have become a central instrument to advance corporate sustainability. They include codes of conduct, certification standards, and reporting standards, and may focus on single fields (eg, Equator Principles for project financing) or multiple fields (eg, the GRI reporting standard). Investors have played a major role in establishing voluntary standards, and have thereby reshaped the rules of the fields in which companies operate.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Investors that are active in the “Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures” have employed this tactic. Biodiversity loss and other nature-related risks are complex challenges, and many companies have little expertise on how to address them. Since 2020, investors have used the Taskforce to develop voluntary standards for corporate reporting on how companies harm nature and how nature creates risks for companies. After extensive stakeholder dialogue, pilot testing, and industry feedback, the Taskforce will release its final version in September 2023, which we expect will transform the nature-related parts of sustainability reporting.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Supporting regulatory changes&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;The fifth and final tactic for field building is to support regulatory changes that set mandatory standards for corporate sustainability. Once multiple companies within a field voluntarily engage in a sustainability-related activity, and thereby prove that such activities are technically and financially viable, regulatory interventions may be necessary to force laggard companies to follow suit. Following this logic, the number of laws related to corporate sustainability has &lt;a href=&quot;https://eur03.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.unpri.org%2Fpolicy%2Fregulation-database&amp;amp;data=05%7C01%7Cmarti%40rsm.nl%7C5617faa4f4e6474822f608dbae59fdb1%7C715902d6f63e4b8d929b4bb170bad492%7C0%7C0%7C638295474207071901%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=ZU3kycbEnn1GGmNwOIEHqUZNY11kMLAbEez1q7CfgcM%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0&quot;>;almost tripled between 2013 and 2023&lt;/a>;, from around 300 to almost 900. Given their investments in different types of companies, investors can provide valuable insights to policymakers and regulators about regulatory changes that seek to advance corporate sustainability.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some investors have used this tactic to shape the upcoming European Sustainability Reporting Standards, which will be mandatory for all companies operating in the European Union from 2028 onwards. While the April 2022 draft of this law contained strict disclosure requirements, the number of disclosure requirements were weakened in a subsequent draft due to pushback from companies. In February 2023, eleven investors and several sustainable investing industry associations wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;https://eur03.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdp.net%2Fen%2Farticles%2Fcompanies%2F60-companies-and-investors-worth-651bn-tell-eu-to-agree-ambitious-sustainability-reporting-standards&amp;amp;data=05%7C01%7Cmarti%40rsm.nl%7C5617faa4f4e6474822f608dbae59fdb1%7C715902d6f63e4b8d929b4bb170bad492%7C0%7C0%7C638295474207071901%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=dR4a7ipqlhcBhrCvxZCvnS4Td9USAyRarHM%2FEP%2FZJq8%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0&quot;>;public letter&lt;/a>; to policymakers of the European Union in which they urged policymakers to go back to strict disclosure requirement to “ensure a level playing field… for companies that already contribute to a nature-positive economy.”&lt;/p>; &lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;. 。 .&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Each of the five tactics can change the fields in which companies operate, thereby creating additional pressure for companies to become more sustainable. Despite these opportunities for increasing their impact, two reasons may deter investors from venturing into field building.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One reason is profitability. It can be difficult to make a business case for field building over the short term. Field building mostly generates costs for an investor, while benefits will be captured by other investors, including those in the future. Yet, given that many individuals are willing to accept lower returns if their investments create greater impact, they may seek out asset managers that engage in field building even if higher management fees slightly lower their returns.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another reason is political exposure. Field building requires that asset managers publicly take a stance on sustainability issues, which could lead to backlash by people with different views — a risk that is higher among asset managers that cater to a wide range of customers. These asset managers can limit this risk by doing field building on sustainability issues for which a broad consensus exists among their customers and that are backed by a strong business case.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;By broadening their toolbox of tactics, and mastering field building, investors can better position themselves to have a more positive impact on the environment and society — and, in doing so, attract more individual investors that care about impact.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 15 Sep 2023 23:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[How to Get Honest and Substantive Feedback from Your Customers]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/09/how-to-get-honest-and-substantive-feedback-from-your-customers]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/09/Sept23_15_1433543803-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;SvetaZi/Getty Images&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;Businesses can&amp;#8217;t improve operations without honest and substantive feedback. Customers can be reluctant to provide it, for several reasons. Companies can try to overcome this by focusing feedback requests on improvement (not employee assessment), focusing on customer actions instead of words, and approaching the gathering of feedback as a habit rather than an occasional effort.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/how-to-get-honest-and-substantive-feedback-from-your-customers?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/how-to-get-honest-and-substantive-feedback-from-your-customers?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;“How&#39;s everything so far?”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Fine, thank you.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In restaurants around the world, the “check-in dance” between servers and customers is pervasive. Servers ask how things are after customers receive their meal, and nearly all patrons reflexively respond with an automatic “fine, thanks.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the surface, it seems like the start of a feedback loop, but real feedback rarely materializes. Chances are the server isn&#39;t seeking a detailed critique, like whether the fish skin was crispy enough or the vegetables were over-seasoned. They&#39;re ensuring the meal is acceptable so that the dining process moves forward. Similarly, the diner often sidesteps genuine, constructive feedback, opting to maintain social etiquette and avoid a long interaction.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Both sides lose in this dance of niceties. The restaurant loses the opportunity to identify operational shortcomings, improve its product, and grow its reputation and customer base. The diner loses the opportunity to feel thrilled with the experience they receive and even — potentially — to be emotionally invested in the business.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Recently, one of us (Steve) and his wife, Michelle, were met with a different version of the dance at an upscale Brooklyn pop-up. The chef personally introduced a dish with the intention of combining several “luxury” ingredients. The dish just didn&#39;t work — at all. Michelle and Steve picked at it politely. But the dance departed from the typical choreography when instead of a server stopping by, the chef came out and asked a more pointed question, making it clear that he wasn&#39;t looking for politeness. “I&#39;ve been tinkering with that dish for a while and know it has a lot of elements, but does it &lt;em>;come together&lt;/em>; for you? I can&#39;t get better if I don&#39;t hear honest feedback.” The sincerity and sense of safety that the chef brought to the conversation allowed the diners to share that the dish just didn&#39;t work for them. It also made Steve and Michelle more engaged and interested in the restaurant&#39;s success, and they returned several weeks later to see that the dish had been adjusted and improved.&lt;/p>; &lt;article-promo>; &lt;hbr-component type=&quot;promo&quot; is-insight=&quot;insight-center&quot; title=&quot;The New Age of Operations&quot; dek=&quot;Improving efficiency and increasing resilience.&quot; cta-text=&quot;&quot; href=&quot;/insight-center/the-new-age-of-operations&quot;>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/insight-center/the-new-age-of-operations&quot; style=&quot;color:black;text-decoration:none&quot;>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; Insight Center Collection &lt;/div>; &lt;h3>;The New Age of Operations&lt;/h3>; &lt;div>; Improving efficiency and increasing resilience. &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hbr-component>; &lt;/article-promo>; &lt;p>;Many businesses have lost sight of this foundational operating principle and treat their customer feedback machine as a necessary evil to be fulfilled in the least-costly and least-awkward way possible. Smaller companies, which tend to be pressed for resources, may put little effort into trying to get customer feedback. Managers at small and medium-sized companies may feel like a robust customer feedback mechanism is a luxury that must wait until the company is larger.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;That&#39;s short-sighted, because true operational effectiveness comes from tweaking things that need to be changed &lt;em>;from a customer&#39;s vantage point&lt;/em>;. While obtaining feedback is crucial, it is only valuable if it&#39;s authentic. The challenge is that customers often shy away from such conversations, and businesses, unfortunately, tend to reinforce this reluctance in their approach to seeking feedback. The whole system has become so encumbered and obfuscated from its original purpose that in most circumstances it has become a useless ritual — one that may even destroy value.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Fixing the Problem&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;The fault with this dysfunctional feedback loop lies with both companies and customers. Companies have designed feedback systems aimed primarily for ease of customer input and quantification, leading to the innumerable requests we get to “please stay on the line to take a short survey after this call.” The last thing most customers want to do after phoning in to customer service is spend &lt;em>;more&lt;/em>; time on the phone. On the rare occasions when customers try to provide honest feedback in person, they are often met with defensive postures from staff members who are trained to “defuse” the situation instead of digging deeper for actionable feedback. In fact, often the best way to defuse the situation is to show a legitimate interest in hearing about the feedback!&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Customers also contribute to this problem. Humans are risk and conflict averse, so we generally try to avoid “high-stakes” interactions. The first step to fixing feedback systems is to understand why customers perceive them this way:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Honest feedback feels like a cognitive burden&lt;em>;.&lt;/em>;&lt;/strong>; Most of us avoid difficult and emotional conversations because they are, well, difficult. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gse.harvard.edu/ideas/news/13/11/remembering-professor-chris-argyris&quot;>;Chris Argyris&lt;/a>;, the late founder of the body of work called &lt;a href=&quot;https://thesystemsthinker.com/overcoming-defensive-routines-in-the-workplace/&quot;>;&lt;em>;productive interactions&lt;/em>;&lt;/a>;&lt;em>;, &lt;/em>;noted that there are three strategies people can use in situations of conflict: (1) &lt;em>;Bypass&lt;/em>; &lt;em>;— &lt;/em>;avoid discussing the issue and move on; (2) &lt;em>;Name&lt;/em>; — note the problem, but don&#39;t discuss it; and (3) &lt;em>;Engage&lt;/em>; — actually discuss the problem. The risk to the relationship is higher as you move up that scale, so people tend to employ &lt;em>;bypass &lt;/em>;in most situations. In the case of customer feedback, bypassing is saying things are fine, even if they are not.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;The consequences of feedback feel unnecessarily high. &lt;/strong>;This is especially true when the forum is one of many online public review sites. One of us (Elizabeth) recently found herself debating whether she wanted to write an honest review of a small business — one she was rooting for to succeed. It had a great product, but sub-par service. But an honest review would have the unintended effect of publicizing the service problems, so she just passed.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Fear of retaliation. &lt;/strong>;Some customers refrain from feedback for fear of retaliation. To continue the restaurant analogy, this might entail the dreaded image of kitchen staff tainting food in some way. Indeed, we often hear stories from customers who are repeatedly disappointed in some small way by a business, but don&#39;t want to give feedback for fear that it would impact the relationship. In effect, the customer seems to value the relationship with the business more than the service or product it provides.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Feedback requests have become like white noise.&lt;/strong>; Every business asks for feedback in every interaction, creating a situation similar to an inversion of the tragedy of the commons. Instead of an individual consuming a resource at the expense of the collective, the collective is ignoring a request at the expense of the business.&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;Some might ask whether this is a problem worth solving. Don&#39;t we get enough hints at issues from today&#39;s feedback system? We would argue no. The issue is that unhappy customers often just quit. They don&#39;t give warning — they just don&#39;t come back. So the real problem to be solved is that your “formal” feedback mechanisms might be saying that everything&#39;s fine, but you might have a service issue brewing. This can result in fast downward spirals and reputation issues that are hard to recover from. Like most health issues, prevention and/or early detection are far preferable to stronger interventions once the situation has become worse.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We offer several thoughts on how to improve:&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Make improvement your goal, not assessment.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Because companies use customer feedback to assess employee performance, many of us have experienced the plea from a customer service rep to rate them a “5 out of 5,” possibly taking a positive experience and ending it in an awkward (if not downright negative) way. It&#39;s not the employee&#39;s fault — it&#39;s the system that&#39;s in use.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We suggest reframing feedback questions to make it clear that the organization is seeking to improve — not to be told it&#39;s doing well. Instead of asking “how did I do?” ask “what&#39;s one thing could I do to have served you better today?” Invite the customer to join you in a journey for a better experience. You might need to teach your people to ask good second and third questions to solicit better feedback, because a broad-based initial question may not be sufficient for some customers to generate ideas. Training them to do this will be worth the effort.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Disproportionally focus on what customers do, not what they say.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;As noted above, customers are not inclined to share their thoughts or feelings unless things are either really bad or if the interaction is framed in the right way. So instead of tracking “sentiment,” which can be misleading, track and observe customer behavior. How often are customers repeating purchases? How frequently do they come to your store or site? What do they do when they&#39;re there? In the case of a restaurant, which entrees come back half-eaten and which inspire clean plates?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Systematically capturing this behavioral feedback requires a combination of data analysis to track large groups of customers to see patterns, but also, non-statistically significant observations by your frontline employees. Is there something they&#39;re noticing customers doing that indicates dissatisfaction? For instance, employees of a coffee stand might observe customers wrapping their cups in napkins; perhaps it means that the cup is too hot to hold? By combining data on customer behavior with the power of observation, businesses can generate hypotheses on how they can continually improve the quality of their operations.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Make this a habit, not a periodic intervention.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;As noted above, service issues can fester over time, causing customers to quit without warning. Prevention in this case is curative. So switch up that bi-annual or quarterly survey instrument in favor of mechanisms that are continual and part of your culture.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Finally, if you want to take it to the next level, consider pairing experimentation with your feedback efforts. Make a small change and ask for feedback. Or make a more significant change in a small area of your business and see how customers respond. Pairing experimentation with an eye to observing customers and seeking honest input is a mechanism to continually improve your operations — as is seeing feedback as both a gift and an imperative.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;By welcoming feedback as both a precious insight and a mandate, organizations can foster a vibrant and adaptive business environment that is responsive to customer needs and preferences. Establishing a genuine and meaningful feedback loop has the potential to elevate a business&#39;s operational standards considerably. Creating a culture that encourages feedback and sees customers not as sources of approval or disapproval, but as partners who can contribute to the betterment of a company&#39;s offering, is an important way to rethink the typical, unhelpful feedback dance that exists today.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 15 Sep 2023 22:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Sustainability Is About Your Workforce, Too]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/09/sustainability-is-about-your-workforce-too]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/09/Sept23_15_1219011427.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;Javier Zayas Photography/Getty Images&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;In recent years, many companies hired chief sustainability officers and established a set of high-priority programs to reduce carbon emissions and the risk of global climate change. As the EU moves forward with a number of regulations designed to protect the workforce, it&amp;#8217;s time to extend the concept of sustainability. People sustainability takes a holistic approach to corporate human capital practices, including diversity and inclusion, well-being, employee safety, and fair pay.

The enactment of these new regulations signals a new era in which it&#39;s time to extend the concept of sustainability to include similarly critical issues with the workforce — an idea I call people sustainability.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;People sustainability takes a holistic approach to corporate human capital practices, including diversity and inclusion, well-being, employee safety, and fair pay. It raises these human capital issues to the C-suite and obliges chief human resource officers to work with chief sustainability officers on these programs. It means that your employee well-being efforts are no longer delivered piecemeal, which was ineffective no matter how well-intentioned or resourced they might be.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The EU is essentially saying that all these “HR programs” are much bigger than HR: They now fall into the category of global citizenship mandates, and companies must treat and report them as such.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;How to Integrate People Sustainability into Your Company&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;I&#39;m talking to European and US firms about how they are gearing up for the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive and developing people sustainability metrics.&amp;nbsp;Here are examples of how a few companies are approaching this:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;Heineken has developed standard measurements of human rights, fair pay, and even living conditions for all its contract workers helping it deliver beverage sales around the world.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Enterprise software leader SAP has &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.sap.com/2022/10/people-sustainability-investment-sap-research/&quot;>;coupled its industry-leading diversity program to new pay equity and sustainability initiatives&lt;/a>;. For example, the company now openly publishes all pay bands so employees can see where they are and the pay scales for all new jobs posted. In parallel, it provides hiring and workplace support for neurodivergent employees. After undertaking a progressive gender pay equity analysis, it inaugurated a very aggressive program of promotions of women into senior leadership — all long-term “people sustainability” strategies.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Financial services firm Liberty Mutual sees people sustainability as a factor in limiting the global risks of its customers, partners, and employees in the face of accelerating climate change. Chief sustainability officer Francis Hyatt, who previously served as executive vice president of enterprise talent practices, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.libertymutualgroup.com/about-lm/corporate-information/sustainability/corporate-sustainability&quot;>;oversees the integration of global climate issues&lt;/a>; in the firm&#39;s risk management approach and promotes sustainability solutions for employees, resellers, and customers. The company promotes thought-through generational and gender equality programs, and Hyatt ensures that every employee understands how their long-term safety and success is part of the company&#39;s overall sustainability strategy. In other words, this new job function unifies all the brand&#39;s existing HR work into the context of sustainability and helping the planet.&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;What links all three of these major corporations is the way each separately discovered that when you frame human capital investment in the context of sustainability, it assumes even more importance than it did before.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you see value in this approach, where should you start at your organization? Building on the European Union&#39;s new detailed CSRD reporting requirements, leaders will need to address issues ranging from greenhouse gas emissions to gender pay across their own operations, as well as that of their suppliers and business partners. You should try to ensure sustainability becomes a pillar of operations as early as possible, as the compliance clock is ticking.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The real action is to get your HR team to start working as soon as possible with their ESG colleagues to get people sustainability metrics and strategies into your business goals. To drive this, bring together a team including your heads of HR, DEI, and ESG, as well as representatives from your corporate finance and legal teams, to design your people sustainability program. You&#39;ll ultimately want to see these goals reflected in your annual report and other stakeholder communications, so that these programs are seen as a core part of company strategy.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A recent survey by PwC reveals that many CEOs anticipate &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/news-room/press-releases/2023/pwc-26th-ceo-survey.html&quot;>;climate risk will affect their cost profiles&lt;/a>; and supply chains in the next year. However, despite these challenges, 60% of the surveyed CEOs do not plan to reduce headcount, and 80% do not plan to decrease compensation, as they recognize the importance of retaining talented employees.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Data like this underlines how people sustainability has become an integral strategy for corporate growth. Investors will soon begin to measure the effectiveness of a company&#39;s well-being initiatives as a key metric of overall performance as much as its P&amp;amp;L.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;You don&#39;t have to be directly affected by Europe&#39;s new sustainability laws to see that bringing together previously disconnected efforts such as DEI, purpose, or L&amp;amp;D under the umbrella of “long-term organizational sustainability” makes a lot of sense. You might even see it as meeting the needs of the present without compromising your future: a measure of sustainability that certainly gets my support.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 15 Sep 2023 21:25:02 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
