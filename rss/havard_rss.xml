Mayorkas) 和能源部长詹妮弗·格兰霍姆 (Jennifer Granholm) 于 5 月 11 日在白宫讲台上向美国公众发表讲话，2021 年。新闻发布室是西翼的一个小房间，里面挤满了大约 50 名记者，电视摄像机在后面运行。媒体聚集在这里，通过提出当天最重要问题的尖锐问题，让美国政府对美国公众负责——形成了一个强大的舞台，基本上全世界都在关注。两位国务卿概述了政府正在采取的行动减轻勒索软件攻击的影响。他们还&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/press-briefings/2021/05/11/press-briefing-by-press-secretary-jen-psaki-secretary-of-energy -jennifer-granholm-and-secretary-of-homeland-security-alejandro-mayorkas-may-11-2021/&quot;>;呼吁美国公众“没有理由囤积汽油，特别是在考虑到这一点的情况下”事实上，该管道应在本周末和周末之前基本投入运行。”&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;持久影响&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;殖民地管道勒索软件攻击的地缘政治影响是深远的。在此之后，拜登总统&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/07/09/readout-of-president-joseph-r-biden-jr-call -with-president-vladimir-putin-of- Russia-2/&quot;>;与俄罗斯总统弗拉基米尔·普京直接接触&lt;/a>;，强调了事件的严重性。这场危机还强调了迫切需要&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dhs.gov/news/2021/07/20/dhs-announces-new-cybersecurity-requirements-ritic-pipeline-owners-and-operators ”更强大的&lt;/a>;网络安全措施，特别是对于像殖民地管道这样的关键基础设施。它清楚地提醒我们，网络威胁并不局限于数字世界；网络威胁也不仅仅存在于数字世界。它们会迅速蔓延，造成广泛的破坏和社会影响。最终，殖民管道事件是一个分水岭。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这一事件至今仍在产生连锁反应，重新定义了首席执行官和行业领导者所扮演的角色，并将塑造我们对未来几年网络安全的看法。它还指出了企业领导人需要问自己的一些重要问题，并强调网络事件如何迅速升级为需要美国总统关注的国家安全危机。试想一下，如果 2022 年 2 月下旬或 3 月初，即俄罗斯军队进一步入侵乌克兰几天后，美国再次发生同样具有影响力的勒索软件攻击，会发生什么。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;其中一个连锁反应是首席执行官们的态度思考他们的角色和责任。殖民地管道公司首席执行官约瑟夫·布朗特&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cbsnews.com/news/colonial-pipeline-ceo-ransomware-hackers-senate-hearing/&quot;>;告诉&lt;/a>;国会议员支付大约 430 万美元的比特币作为赎金是“我在能源行业 39 年来做出的最艰难的决定”。是否向黑客支付费用并进一步加剧赎金要求的犯罪循环或&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.securitymagazine.com/articles/93062-ransomware-vicitim-travelex-forced-into-bankruptcy&quot;>;风险&lt;/ a>; 严重破坏甚至破产是不可能的选择。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;首席执行官们显然已经注意到了。很少有人会喜欢从卡诺莎到华盛顿的道路，并成为国会和媒体的焦点。我们从这起事件以及过去两年的其他重大事件中学到了什么？以下是给首席执行官的六项建议：&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;1.小心与公众沟通的方式。 &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;银行挤兑是公众反应和群体心理导致危机恶化的典型例子。 Covid-19 大流行期间的厕纸抢购事件和勒索软件攻击后的加油站抢购事件凸显出这个问题不仅限于金融机构。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;小心与公众沟通的方式和内容。并不意味着避免与公众沟通；相反，这是一种必然。然而，公司需要采取深思熟虑的方法。正如殖民地管道事件所表明的那样，这包括那些很少需要在日常运营中与公众接触的公司，但可能需要日复一日地与公众接触。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>; 2.与政府协调。&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;殖民地管道公司关闭其管道系统的决定需要尽快做出，但可以说有足够的时间咨询美国政府专家。关闭管道系统意味着，无论是否受到感染，都需要数天时间才能重新启动，从而扰乱实际的燃料供应，其所有后果都需要政府采取行动。与政府的协调是避免危机无意中恶化的关键。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;3.知道该联系谁。&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;为了快速做出明智的决策并与合适的人协调，首席执行官需要知道政府中谁是正确的联系人。正如多年来的一些轶事所表明的那样，联系北约或军方并不是正确的答案。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;话虽如此，有时政府并不能让外部各方轻松识别适当的个人或机构，因此政府有责任提供清晰度。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;4.制定一个计划并执行它。&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;这可能是最关键的一点，因为它提供了实现其他目标的工具。除了制定和制定计划（最好由首席执行官监督）之外，该计划还应该每年至少实施一次。定期的桌面练习将帮助公司领导层和员工建立在真正的危机中有效应对所需的“肌肉记忆”。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;5.了解您的网络。&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;理想情况下，首席执行官应该对公司的业务 IT 网络和运营技术 (OT) 网络如何交互有深入的了解。如果系统是气隙的，如果危害仅限于 IT 网络，则无需关闭 OT 网络。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;话虽如此，针对 Colonial Pipeline 的勒索软件攻击已经证明，即使瘫痪业务 IT 网络的变化可能会产生重大影响。如果一家公司无法再开具发票，不知道其客户是谁，也不知道如何联系他们，那么实际影响可能与实际停止生产一样具有破坏性。对于因航空公司 IT 系统&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-airports-systems-idUSKBN18Q10R&quot;>;停机&lt;/a而滞留在机场的读者>;，您亲身经历了破坏性影响。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;6.保持谦虚并寻求专家帮助。&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;网络安全是一个广泛的术语，涵盖高度复杂的问题集。虽然存在共性，并且一些软件跨部门使用，但管道的网络安全与金融部门、医院、学校或铁路的网络安全有很大不同。经过多年跨行业的网络事件，一个重要的见解是承认每个人的知识的局限性，包括网络安全专家的知识。因此，首席执行官应该毫不犹豫地向公司外部寻求帮助，以帮助制定、测试或完善计划或审查现有流程和政策。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;除了这些高级建议之外，还有大量其他资源，包括针对 CEO、董事会成员和 CISO 的更详细的&lt;a href=&quot;https://carnegieendowment.org/specialprojects/fincyber/guides&quot;>;指南和清单&lt;/a>;。美国政府，即网络安全和基础设施安全局 (CISA)，还提供 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cisa.gov/stopransomware&quot;>;Stopransomware.gov&lt;/a>; 和 &lt;a href=&quot;https: //www.cisa.gov/shields-up&quot;>;Shields Up&lt;/a>; 是专为公司设计的资源，可根据其网络安全成熟度水平使用。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;商业领袖作为信任的守护者&lt;/h2 >; &lt;p>;除了出于自身利益和避免国家安全危机而加强公司的网络安全之外，企业领导人还发挥着更大的作用，可以被视为整体技术信任的守护者。从根本上来说，网络安全围绕着信任。勒索软件和许多其他网络攻击都利用了这种信任。他们利用某人点击不可信链接、从未知电子邮件地址下载附件或接收恶意软件更新的情况。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这一原则延伸到公司对其系统底层技术的信任，从而引发地缘政治回到讨论中。中国企业在 5G 网络中的作用多年来一直是一个中心话题。它标志着关于在投资、购买和使用技术时如何考虑风险的更广泛辩论的开始。美国政府对来自中华人民共和国的某些技术的担忧&lt;a href=&quot;https://2017-2021.state.gov/5g-security/index.html&quot;>;众所周知&lt;/a>;。与此同时，在布鲁塞尔和其他欧洲国家首都，一场关于“去风险、 ” 受到俄罗斯入侵乌克兰和欧洲依赖的教训的影响。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;商界领袖处于这场辩论的中心，因为他们是技术信任最重要的守护者。科技公司决定投资什么，以及如何权衡成本与其他收益（例如更高的安全性和信任度）将决定整个社会的整体弹性。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;首席执行官的自我检查&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;多年来，许多人&lt;a href=&quot;/2018/08/corporate-cybersecurity-is-becoming-geopolitical-are-us-tech-companies-ready&quot;>;警告&lt;/a>;网络威胁日益严重，有些人&lt; a href=&quot;/2023/04/cyber-risk-is-forming-heres-how-companies-can-keep-up&quot;>;就如何加强组织的保护和复原力提供了&lt;/a>;深思熟虑的建议。三个问题可以帮助确定是否已采取足够的措施来补充上述建议：&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;您最近参加过网络桌面演习吗？&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;您是否有您的联系信息？首席信息安全官是否保存在工作电话或计算机以外的其他地方？ （请记住，如果您公司的网络遭受勒索软件攻击，您的工作设备可能无法访问。）&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;您知道在发生网络安全事件时您在政府中的联系人吗？&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul >; &lt;p>;如果以上任何一个问题的答案都是“否”，那么阅读本文有望激发一些后续行动 - 它将有助于更好地保护您的组织，并可能防止未来的国家安全危机。&lt;/p>; &lt; !-- 引文 -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 18 Sep 2023 22:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Research: Consumers&rsquo;

close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt; span>;摘要。&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;三个因素正在推动我们的消费模式发生重大转变，消费者将把可持续性视为购买的基本要求：1) 信任驱动行为，最终，业务成果； 2) 可持续性促进信任，尤其是年轻一代之间的信任； 3）年轻一代很快将在了解这些趋势的美国公司中拥有大部分购买力——创建真正可持续的品牌，兑现对人类和地球的承诺——将从那些声称不可靠或在可持续发展方面投资不足的品牌中获得优势。&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/ 09/research-consumers-sustainability-demands-are-rising?language=es&quot;>;阅读西班牙语&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/research-consumers-sustainability-demands-are-rising ?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;对于大多数消费者来说，可持续发展被认为是他们购买的品牌中的“必备品”，但是 &lt;a href=&quot;https: //www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/retail-distribution/consumer-behavior-trends-state-of-the-consumer-tracker/sustainable-products-and-practices-for-green-living。 html&quot;>;它很少成为赌注&lt;/a>;。这种情况即将改变。我们的研究表明，我们正处于消费模式重大转变的边缘，真正可持续的品牌——那些兑现对人类和地球的承诺的品牌——将从那些声称不可靠或没有投资的品牌中获得优势足够的可持续性。我们正在快速接近这个临界点，可持续性将被视为采购的基准要求，公司应该立即做好准备。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;要了解原因，您需要了解三件事：&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;信任推动行为，并最终推动业务成果。&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;可持续发展促进信任，尤其是年轻一代的信任。&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;年轻一代很快将拥有美国的大部分购买力&lt; /li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;1.信任驱动行为，并最终驱动业务成果。&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;我们研究信任，通过涉及 30 个行业 500 多个品牌的数十万消费者和员工的研究，我们测量了信任信任的力量可以推动一系列积极的行为。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;信任的员工会更有动力工作，缺勤率较低，并且不太可能寻找另一份工作。信任的客户更有可能选择某个品牌（而不是竞争对手）、再次购买并进行推广。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;高度信任的公司在市场价值方面比其他公司高出 400%。这些惊人的回报之所以能实现，是因为随着公司赢得信任，公司股票的信任边际效应就会增加。我们的 TrustID 平台&lt;a href=&quot;/2022/11/4-questions-to-measure-and-boost-customer-trust&quot;>;用于衡量公司信任度&lt;/a>;，显示当公司的得分从 30 移动到9 月 31 日，预期股票回报率增加约 3%。当分数从 60 攀升至 61 时，增幅为 6%。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;2.可持续发展可以促进信任，尤其是年轻一代的信任。&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;由于信任的回报如此之高，组织面临的一个明显问题是：是什么创造了对品牌的信任？我们的研究表明，可持续性是一个强大的驱动力。要理解其中的原因，您首先必须了解信任从何而来。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;其核心信任是在品牌或组织做出良好承诺并兑现承诺时建立的。他们分别通过传达积极的意图和展示能力来做到这一点。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我们对超过 350,000 名 18 岁至 98 岁的美国客户进行了调查，衡量他们对品牌意图和能力的看法。我们使用衡量信任的四个因素中的两个因素的综合得分来衡量意图：品牌感知的人性（同理心、善良、公平）和透明度（以简单语言分享动机和相关信息的开放性）。我们结合剩下的两个信任因素来衡量对品牌能力的看法：能力（产品质量）和可靠性（一致的交付）。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我们发现，可持续性不仅是一个关键驱动因素意图，但存在重要的代际效应。虽然年轻和年长的消费者都关心品牌的能力（质量和一致性），但年轻消费者对品牌的信任以及由此产生的购买行为更容易受到品牌积极意图的影响。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;考虑以下发现：当 Z 世代和千禧一代客户相信某个品牌关心其对人类和地球的影响时，他们购买该品牌的可能性比老一代高出 27%，这清楚地衡量了可持续发展推动该群体购买决策的力量.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;为了进一步放大，我们可以具体研究人性和透明度的影响，以及构成良好意图的信任因素。&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;当 Z 世代和千禧一代客户对一个品牌的人性评价很高，他们比老一代人更有可能在该品牌上花更多的钱并选择该品牌，而不是竞争对手。&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;当他们对透明度评价很高时，他们会比老一代人高出 30%比老一代人花更多钱的可能性高 %，选择它的可能性比竞争对手高 20%。&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;3.年轻一代很快将拥有美国大部分的购买力。&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;预测专家计算，到2030年左右，千禧一代和Z世代的购买力将超过婴儿潮一代，最多可达68万亿美元财富&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/21/what-the-68-trillion-great-wealth-transfer-means-for-advisors.html&quot;>;转移&lt; /a>; 到本十年末，从婴儿潮一代到年轻一代。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;要赢得这些年轻消费者的信任，很明显，您的品牌的可持续发展努力必须体现人性化和透明度：&lt;/p>; &lt; ul>; &lt;li>;为了突出&lt;em>;人性&lt;/em>;，表明您的组织重视并尊重每个人，无论身份、背景或信仰如何；尊重并照顾员工；并将社会和环境的利益置于纯粹的盈利之上。&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;为了强调透明度，&lt;/em>;确保消费者能够轻松找到有关您的品牌对社区和影响的直接信息。环境。&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;在这方面做得好的组织将会获得回报。以我们在杂货店的调查结果为例。 &lt;a href=&quot;https://corporate.publix.com/about-publix/company-overview/mission-statement-guarantee&quot;>;Publix&lt;/a>;，&lt;a href=&quot;https://corporate. publix.com/about-publix/company-overview/facts-figures&quot;>;美国销量最大的连锁超市&lt;/a>;，在我们的 TrustID 数据集中的 11 个同行杂货品牌的客户信任度中排名第一，具有人性化和透明度得分分别比第二名高出 75% 和 47%。这种差异对于 Z 世代和千禧一代客户来说更为明显，他们在 Publix 上的得分分别比排名第二的玩家高 83% 和 95%。因此，信任的客户从 Publix 购买的可能性比从竞争对手购买的可能性高出 54%。对于 Z 世代和千禧一代客户来说这一点更为明显，他们从 Publix 购买商品的可能性比从竞争对手购买的可能性高出 162%。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这种信任以及由此产生的客户忠诚度源自 Publix 对人员的可见投资和这个星球。例如，Publix 员工自动获得季度股票福利，并可以选择购买额外股票。这使得 Publix 成为全球最大的员工持股公司之一，拥有超过 20 万名员工，他们总共拥有公司约 80% 的股份。 Publix 还提供医疗和学费福利以及与公司匹配的退休计划，即使是兼职员工也是如此。员工会定期接受绩效评估和加薪。这些好处有助于解释为什么自愿离职率仅为 5%，而行业标准为 65%。难怪 Publix 是仅有的四家连续登上《财富》杂志“100 家最适宜工作公司”名单的公司之一 &lt;a href=&quot;https://corporate.publix.com/newsroom/news-stories/04042023 ---publix-named-on-fortunes-100-best-companies-to-work-for-list#:~:text=LAKELAND%2C%20Fla.%2C%20April%204,%20list 的%20inception%20in %201998.&quot;>;连续第 26 年&lt;/a>;。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在地球方面，Publix 积极投资减少食物浪费和促进保护。例如，&lt;a href=&quot;https://sustainability.publix.com/bakery/reducing-food-waste/&quot;>;2022 年&lt;/a>;该公司向农民发送了超过 5400 万磅的食物垃圾——制造副产品变成动物饲料。同年，其海鲜部门从聚苯乙烯容器改为可回收塑料手提袋，从而减少了 190,000 个容器的使用，而熟食部门则选择了更轻的塑料袋，并用餐具台取代了塑料包装的餐具套装。这些举措每年总共消除了超过 360,000 磅的塑料垃圾。 Publix 还以“GreenWise”标签创建了自己的可持续食品系列，展示了其对优质原料和严格动物福利标准的承诺。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;让 Publix 的经验成为一个教训：虽然转折点可能不会到来到 2030 年，各种类型的公司都应该在今天扩大其可持续发展工作和沟通，以在未来赢得信任和客户。&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- 引用 -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot;

&lt;span>;&lt;p>;全球技能短缺影响了企业的生产产出和服务交付。此外，由于劳动力成本的原因，生产材料、制造商品和提供服务的成本正在上升。对于中小型企业来说，这意味着利润可能会被挤压到无法在当今竞争异常激烈的全球市场中竞争的程度。人工智能、机器人技术、数字交易和相关自动化为中小企业提供了经济高效地增强和构建能力的手段。&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>;

&lt;/div>; &lt;p>;我们的全球供应链面临压力，不仅仅是因为材料短缺和运输延误，也是由于关键部门劳动力短缺造成的。现在，从采购到生产、物流以及商品和服务的交付，供应链连续体的各个环节都出现了技能短缺的情况。这些差距包括更多的手动任务（例如仓库订单拣选）到构建和维护供应链系统。现在的技术已经足够先进，可以填补由于技能短缺而造成的许多空白，但仅靠技术是无法做到这一点的。重建陷入困境的供应链需要将技术和人员技能发展战略相结合。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;招聘和留住合格的工人被认为是 2,000 名供应链高管在回应最近的&lt;a href=&quot;https ://www.mhi.org/publications/report&quot;>;供应链行业贸易协会 MHI 的调查&lt;/a>;。大多数人（57%）表示，雇用和留住合格工人是今年最大的挑战，56% 的人则面临持续的特定人才短缺问题。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一系列对供应链脆弱性敏感的行业都面临劳动力短缺问题根据 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.uschamber.com/workforce/understanding-americas-labor-shortage-the-most-impacted- Industries&quot;>;美国商会的分析&lt;/a>;。报告指出：“即使所有有耐用品制造业经验的失业人员都被雇用，该行业也只能填补约 75% 的空缺职位。”&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;敏感行业&lt;/strong >;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;受影响行业的高管和专家一致认为，解决技能短缺问题刻不容缓。经济逆风可能会削弱就业需求，但严峻的人员配置挑战仍将持续存在。人口老龄化和快速发展的技术技能差距等长期因素已成为人员配置的新常态。&lt;/p>; &lt;article-promo>; &lt;hbr-component type=&quot;promo&quot;

&lt;p>;制造业尤其代表了“供应链的矛尖”。 Joe Walden，堪萨斯大学供应链教授。 “劳动力短缺对这些人的打击最为严重。无论供应链其他环节的劳动力状况如何，这一层面的短缺都会影响消费者的产品供应。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在物流和配送领域，“劳动力短缺正在影响劳动力的流动”。阿里巴巴北美 B2B 供应链负责人 Yikun Shao 表示。 “物流领域人手不足可能会导致发货延误、港口装卸延误、卡车司机短缺和库存缺货、难以按时履行客户订单等各种挑战。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这反过来又对下游零售商和分销商产生不利影响。 UPS 旗下 Ware2Go 供应链主管凯尔顿·科西克 (Kelton Kosik) 表示：“高昂的劳动力成本加上对人才的持续需求，已经对商家及其履行流程造成了损害。” “尽管全球供应链的压力有所缓解，但在运输旺季（例如网络星期一和假日销售活动）期间缺乏人才以及制造、运输和交付产品的能力可能会导致经济通货紧缩或放缓。”&lt;/ p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;技术来拯救？&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;为了解决这些问题并实现许多技能要求的自动化，三菱重工的调查显示，公司正在加大技术投资。近四分之三的供应链高管（74%）正在增加对技术的投资。大多数人 (58%) 认为人工智能是他们当前的主要投资领域，另外 54% 的人希望通过工业物联网建立智能合作伙伴网络。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但是，部署人工智能有一个第 22 条军规：解决技能差距的技术——预先寻找构建和维护人工智能和物联网系统的技能。调查中的供应链高管将“缺乏足够的人才”视为实施人工智能或物联网等技术的主要障碍。 “具有讽刺意味的是，在实施创新技术方面，人才既是障碍，又是受益者，”该报告的作者指出。 “虽然部署技术来自动化日常任务需要人才和人力，但一旦技术启动并运行，它就可以让员工专注于需要人类参与的更高价值的任务。”更高价值的任务可能包括与顾客或客户更密切地合作，或协调和监控商品或服务的流动。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;采取行动的时间&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p >;公司需要将技术与积极的技能开发工作相结合，以吸引和维持支持供应链所需的技能，以及管理技术以推动事物向前发展。奥多米尼恩大学海事、港口和物流研究所教授兼所长里卡多·翁戈表示，企业可以“通过将员工从重复性任务转移到当前技术无法胜任的角色来提高员工的生产力”。 “This is a necessary step toward the digitalization of the whole chain, providing much needed visibility.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The following actions can help address skills shortages within supply chains:&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;&lt;strong>;Target technology investments.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;“Small to medium enterprises may have a more limited capital investment capability,” says, says Keith Fisher, the president of Honeywell Intelligrated. “They need to prioritize solutions with a clear return on investment. For example, by incorporating automation into parts of their business with high turnover rates, small businesses might see a greater impact on improved productivity for a more immediate ROI.”&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;&lt;strong>;Position technologies to pick up the slack for manual or repetitive tasks.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;All-encompassing automation approaches have been particularly helpful within organizations that require scaling up manual or repetitive work, such as distribution operations. Robots, for example, can be employed for scanning, assembling, and moving parts and products across distribution centers or warehouses. Robots, along with automatic storage and retrieval systems, and automation systems, can pick up the slack for many physically demanding jobs,” says Walden.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Such applications “help increase the productivity of distribution center workers by reducing significantly the time spent traveling from one location to pick products to another,” Walden adds. “Many of the automation concepts from automated picking to robotic pallet building to automated packaging are finally finding their way into distribution centers to offset the shortage of workers.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, comprehensive automation is “providing opportunities to integrate automation and robotics capabilities to fill labor gaps and manage mundane tasks like automated taping, label applications and scanning,” says Kosik. “Remaining talent can focus on more pressing tasks as well. Companies can use AI for better demand forecasting to ensure labor is being most efficiently allocated.”&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;&lt;strong>;Leverage technology to enhance the work of employees.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;At their core, supply chains will always be more than automated systems or algorithms exchanging information and purchase orders. “Supply chains are social networks,” writes Yossi Sheffi, professor of engineering systems at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in his book, &lt;em>;The Magic Conveyor Belt: Supply Chains, AI, and the Future of Work.&lt;/em>; “When it comes to making decisions in a supply chain, such as managing exceptions or escalating problems, the personal relationships between the people in the companies and both their customers and suppliers matter. Customer-supplier relationships can be complex “with a web of personal relationships.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Technology solutions should be purposed to enhance these relationships, as well as increase the productivity of workers at all levels.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, “the use of AI-augmented reality allows the employment of people with limited or no experience, because they are instructed by the software to do certain tasks,” Sheffi illustrates.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another emerging use case for AI filling in for skills shortages is autonomous trucking. For example, a “truck platoon,” led by a human driver in a lead truck, consists of electronically linked trucks that follow the movements of the lead truck. “Many companies are investing in developing Level 4 automated driving technologies to haul freight in long-haul routes, allowing them to overcome a lack of drivers caused by the aversion to the long hours away from home,” Lungo says.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;&lt;strong>;Train and develop employees&#39; skills to manage modern supply chains&lt;/strong>;.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Organizations should think of talent as also having its own supply chain, Sheffi advocates. This serves “to deliver the skills that people need to enable them to get and retain good jobs,” and from an employer perspective, “to ensure that companies have the skilled talent they need to produce affordable and valuable products and services for customers.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For small to medium-size businesses, training is essential. “Properly training teams to comprehend the technology&#39;s functionality and operate it effectively is vital,” says Fisher. “This not only helps them get the new technology operational more quickly but improves the adoption and, ultimately, the value of the investment.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In recent years, there has been a 15% increase in the number of organizations investing in upskilling and reskilling programs, with 41% focusing on working to prepare their workers for new tech-forward supply chain jobs, the MHI survey finds, Upskilling is essential to provide the education and training needed to boost skills across front-line supply-chain jobs. “For example, an operations manager who currently uses Microsoft Excel could be trained on a more sophisticated process to integrate supply chain information using new software for shipping and logistics management,” according to the report.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Today&#39;s supply chains have fragile links — companies are struggling to find and retain the workers they need to keep goods and information flowing. This is an opportunity to step up technology investments to automate as much of the work in production, logistics, and delivery of goods and services as possible. At the same time, technology alone cannot shoulder the scope of work needed. Employers also need to step up their skills acquisition and development, helping workers learn and work with technology to deliver results.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Technology can be employed to “support human workers in countless ways: fostering new capabilities and behaviors; improving operational performance; increasing safety; and supporting a more optimal work-life balance,” the MHI report advocates. “New workplace technologies are emerging that don&#39;t just augment human workers and perform mundane work. Rather, when used strategically, they have the ability to help individuals and teams upskill and reskill their capabilities.”&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 18 Sep 2023 21:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[How the Geeks Rewrote the Rules of Management]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/09/how-the-geeks-rewrote-the-rules-of-management]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;div js-target=&quot;video-player-page&quot; data-props=&quot;{&amp;quot;name&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;6337217510112&amp;quot;}&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>;&lt;/div>; &lt;div>;&lt;/div>; &lt;div>;&lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;span>;Loading... &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;script src=&quot;//players.brightcove.net/2071817190001/default_default/index.min.js&quot;>;&lt;/script>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;Andrew McAfee is a principal research scientist at the MIT Sloan School of Management. Throughout his career, he has done ground-breaking research on how digital technologies are changing the world. He is a prolific writer, a frequent contributor to HBR and other outlets, and a sought-after commentator on technological change &amp;#8211; especially, these days, on the potential of generative AI. He is the author of the forthcoming book &amp;#8220;The Geek Way: The Radical Mindset that Drives Extraordinary Results,&amp;#8221; the subject of much of this &amp;#8220;New World of Work&amp;#8221; interview. His big idea is that &amp;#8220;geeks&amp;#8221; have created not only the technology that&amp;#8217;s driving our future but also a management approach that defines contemporary corporate excellence. It&amp;#8217;sa somewhat contrarian view; after all, many of us have criticized Silicon Valley-run businesses as being male-dominated and lacking in empathy (even, of course, as we continue to use their products). What does McAfee mean by geek? He defines them as &amp;#8220;obsessive mavericks,&amp;#8221; people who become obsessed with hard problems and are willing to pursue unconventional solutions &amp;#8211; to avoid the dysfunctions that have traditionally plagued companies as they expand.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/how-the-geeks-rewrote-the-rules-of-management?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/how-the-geeks-rewrote-the-rules-of-management?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;The secret to success for many Silicon Valley tech companies isn&#39;t necessarily that they&#39;re ultra-nimble start-ups, or that they&#39;re led by tech-savvy geniuses. In fact, their success often has more to do with a specific type of corporate culture—and it&#39;s a culture that even companies not based on the US West Coast or focused on technology can adopt.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Andrew McAfee, a principal research scientist at the MIT Sloan School of Management, business leaders need to think more like geeks, but not the computer-based stereotype you may be familiar with. In his forthcoming book, &lt;em>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Geek-Way-Radical-Transforming-Business/dp/0316436704&quot;>;The Geek Way: The Radical Mindset that Drives Extraordinary Results&lt;/a>;&lt;/em>;, McAfee says geeks are nothing more or less than “obsessive mavericks” who are absolutely fixated on finding unconventional solutions to their business&#39; hard problems. You need them throughout the organization, not just at the top, and you need to entrust them with the power to make real changes.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For this episode of our video series “The New World of Work”, HBR editor in chief Adi Ignatius sat down with McAfee to discuss:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;Evolving a company&#39;s culture not by focusing on organizational structure, but on company norms&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Building organizations that can get things right, even when the person at the top of the org chart is wrong&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;The delicate balance of human judgment and evidence, data-driven insights.&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;“&lt;a href=&quot;/insight-center/the-new-world-of-work&quot;>;The New World of Work&lt;/a>;” explores how top-tier executives see the future and how their companies are trying to set themselves up for success. Each week, Ignatius talks to a top leader on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/company/harvard-business-review/&quot;>;LinkedIn Live&lt;/a>; — previous interviews included &lt;a href=&quot;/2021/10/microsofts-satya-nadella-on-flexible-work-the-metaverse-and-the-power-of-empathy&quot;>;Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella&lt;/a>; and &lt;a href=&quot;/2021/11/indra-nooyi-former-ceo-of-pepsico-on-nurturing-talent-in-turbulent-times&quot;>;former PepsiCo CEO Indra Nooyi&lt;/a>;.

My definition has two parts. For me a geek is somebody who gets obsessed with a hard problem and is willing to embrace unconventional solutions.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The patron saint of geeks is probably &lt;a href=&quot;https://amshq.org/About-Montessori/History-of-Montessori/Who-Was-Maria-Montessori&quot;>;Maria Montessori&lt;/a>;, who about 100 years ago got obsessed with the problem of how you educate young children best, and came up with the Montessori educational method, which is this radical departure from the industrial scale model of schools that was dominant then, and sadly still dominant now. Think about Maria Montessori when you think about a geek.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;How do you define the “geek way” that you&#39;re talking about in the book?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ANDREW MCAFEE:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The particular geeks I got excited about that led me to write the book were not educational geeks like Maria Montessori, they were business geeks. They were a group of people concentrated on—but not exclusive to—the West Coast of the US who got obsessed with this problem of, “How do we run a company in an age of really fast technological change and lots of uncertainty? And in particular, how do we avoid some of the classic dysfunctions of the internet era?”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The geek way is what they&#39;ve come up with. It&#39;s the business model, or the culture, or the set of norms that they&#39;ve settled on to try to accomplish that really hard goal.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It&#39;s sort of people who nerd out on, in this case, management, right? Processes of management.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ANDREW MCAFEE:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Obsessive maverick” is my preferred phrase for a geek. And the obsessive mavericks that I got really interested in were the ones who dove in, again, on this problem of, “How do we run a company and keep doing well in our markets and avoid the dysfunctions that seem to plague so many successful companies as they get older and bigger? How do we avoid those dysfunctions? How do we do something that&#39;s higher performing, more sustainable, and a better place to work?”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As I read the book, some of those attributes you talked about, they had to do with speed, they had to do with experimentation. Is this just another term for being digital, or for applying design thinking of the business? Are we talking the same thing here?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ANDREW MCAFEE:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;No, I don&#39;t think so. Adi, you remember &lt;a href=&quot;https://variety.com/2023/digital/news/jeffrey-katzenberg-quibi-proud-to-own-failure-1235623036/&quot;>;Quibi&lt;/a>;, right, the Jeffrey Katzenberg-led video startup? It was going to do short-form videos and it was going to change the way we consume entertainment.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Quibi was entirely digital. It was a completely digital enterprise. It was a miserable failure. They raised $1.75 billion. They shut down within 200 days of their launch. It was just a catastrophe. It was a completely digital enterprise.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Netflix is a geek company. They follow all four of my great geek norms of science, ownership, speed and openness. And I think their results speak for themselves.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Geek for me is entirely separate from digital. You can be a non-digital geek, and you can certainly be very digital and not geeky at all.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Quibi thing is an interesting example. I guess what was missing from your framework was the openness. You had a powerful guy who had been successful, who wasn&#39;t listening.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ANDREW MCAFEE:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Not listening to his peers, to his colleagues, to his advisor. He didn&#39;t appear to be a great listener, which is this kind of stereotypical trap that a lot of industrial-era companies fall into. Tech leaders also fall into this trap quite often. You become enamored of your own success and you really stop listening. It&#39;s incredibly common.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One of the things that is powerful, and that I respect about people like Reed Hastings at Netflix is that he was able to build a business that got important decisions right when he himself was wrong about them. In the book I talk about a couple of them.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He was dead-flat wrong about the utility of downloading to the Netflix app. He thought it wouldn&#39;t be very useful at all; it&#39;s incredibly useful.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He was wrong about the importance of kids&#39; programming for Netflix. And he admits this in the book, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/No-Rules-Netflix-Culture-Reinvention/dp/1984877860&quot;>;&lt;em>;No Rules Rules&lt;/em>;&lt;/a>; that he wrote with Erin Meyer.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He successfully worked hard on building a company that would correct him, the boss, the high status prestigious person at the top of the organization. It&#39;s part of this great geek norm of openness that I talk about. How do you build a company that will get it right when the person at the top of the org chart is wrong? Man, that&#39;s a hard problem.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It&#39;s a hard problem. And I&#39;m sure some people are going to read your book and think, “Hang on, a lot of these companies we&#39;re talking about are Silicon Valley startups or somewhere in that realm.” The popular perception is these are not cultures that you necessarily want to emulate. They&#39;re often male-dominated bro-cultures. The boss frequently is an overly demanding bully. How do you square all this?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ANDREW MCAFEE:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There clearly is some of that going on in the Valley. There are toxic cultures. You mentioned the bro-culture. I would say that &lt;a href=&quot;/2022/11/why-startups-should-embrace-radical-transparency&quot;>;Theranos&lt;/a>; is one of the most toxic cultures I&#39;ve ever heard about, and it was headquartered in Silicon Valley.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I don&#39;t think those are geek companies at all. They might be in the right geographic location, but they&#39;re not following the geek way, which is about these norms and about creating a culture that is fast-moving, free-flowing, argumentative, autonomous, evidence-driven, and pretty egalitarian. That&#39;s the goal of the geek way.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Now you point out some of these companies that I do think follow the geek way that are still too pale, stale, and male. That&#39;s absolutely true. The evidence is pretty clear on this. I hope that gets better over time.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But Adi, you said something that I disagree with, that a lot of these cultures that are not good places to work. That&#39;s true in some cases. Remember when LinkedIn did its top attractors survey, I believe in 2016, they said, look, we&#39;re just going to look at objective criteria. We&#39;re going to look at which company pages get viewed the most often by LinkedIn members. Which companies get the most interest from LinkedIn members, the most applications, and where do people stick around when they take their first job?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The top 11 attractors in the LinkedIn list were all companies headquartered on the West Coast in the industry that we loosely call tech. The geek culture is an extremely attractive culture to work in.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some of these founders, entrepreneurs who got into whatever they got into because they wanted to make the world a better place, Serge and Larry in their garage trying to systematize our access to all the world&#39;s information, these great ideals: when they are actually running companies, they not only are trying to run a company, but they become killers, wanting to wipe out the competition, to foster monopolistic practices, to just grab as much market share as possible.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ANDREW MCAFEE:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Is any of this new? Within the businesses? No, I&#39;m serious. Were the businesses of previous eras cuddly? Did they want their competitors to succeed? Were they trying to rise all boats?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Capitalism is an inherently competitive process. These companies are very, very good performers. If you want to use the adjective “killer” for them, I think that&#39;s by design. You&#39;re not in business not to succeed. You want to grow your market share. You want to grow your profits, you want grow. That is often at the expense of somebody else.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I think it&#39;s for the courts to decide whether they meet the definition of monopolist. It&#39;s a word we toss around a lot. The courts so far have tossed out a lot of the recent lawsuits against some of these giant tech companies. I don&#39;t think they meet the definition of monopolist. In general, for a lot of these companies, the competition is one click away.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;And is Tesla a monopolist in the auto industry? You simply can&#39;t make that case. SpaceX has become pretty close to a monopolist in the rockets and satellites industry, but they didn&#39;t start that way, and they&#39;ve become so large and influential because they do the job better.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Let&#39;s talk about companies that are doing it right. This is not universally for digital companies. Some follow the geek way, as you&#39;ve laid it out, some don&#39;t.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;How many companies, large, small, digital, otherwise live into these principles, do you think?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ANDREW MCAFEE:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I think that&#39;s a really interesting question, and I don&#39;t have a great way to answer it yet. Because the only way that I can think to answer it is to administer a survey to everybody and get them to fill it out. That&#39;s just not going to work.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But you can look at what we know about the cultures at these companies. You can also look at the fantastic &lt;a href=&quot;https://sloanreview.mit.edu/projects/culture-500-introducing-the-2020-culture-champions/&quot;>;Culture 500 research that Don and Charlie Sull&lt;/a>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sloanreview.mit.edu/projects/culture-500-introducing-the-2020-culture-champions/&quot;>; did&lt;/a>;, published in a competitor magazine of yours, &lt;em>;Sloan Management Review&lt;/em>;. They grabbed all the LinkedIn reviews and put them through a machine-learning analysis to see what companies&#39; own employees said about them.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Three areas I was most interested in were execution, agility, and innovation. And wow, the scores for companies clustered on the West Coast, clustered in Silicon Valley, clustered in industries that we call high-tech, those scores are off the charts. There&#39;s not any real competition for them.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There&#39;s something brewing on the West Coast in industries that we label (for reasons that I don&#39;t like very much) high-tech. There&#39;s something brewing that&#39;s new, that is different than what&#39;s going on elsewhere in the economy, and it&#39;s pretty demonstrably powerful. The label that I hang on that is the geek way.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Was Steve Jobs a geek, and did his Apple follow the geek way or was that a different model?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ANDREW MCAFEE:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Jobs has some really classic non-geek characteristics. He believed that he knew best. He had a very, very large ego. He also screamed at his subordinates all the time, which I think is absolutely not what an open leader does.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, I interviewed Eric Schmidt for the book, and I brought this up to him and he said, “Look, I was on Apple&#39;s board for a while. I knew Steve pretty well.” He said Steve was a tough person in all those ways, but he learned that if you want to stay on top, you have to listen to the people around you. You have to stop thinking that you have all the answers.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We see a really clear example of that with the App Store. Jobs did not want to open up his beautiful, perfect walled garden iPhone to outside developers. He had to be talked into it. He eventually realized that he was wrong about that. There is a little bit of that openness going on.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One thing that Apple is pretty fanatic about, as I understand it, is they make decisions based on evidence. And whether or not that&#39;s a huge AB testing infrastructure is one thing. Apple loves to demo features, and gets everybody in the room to look at this and say, for example, is it better to have blurry portrait photos where you can adjust the blur before you take the picture? The instant they did a demo, they had the answer to that question. They did not sit around and argue from their different points of view. They said, OK, let&#39;s run an experiment. Let&#39;s do a demo here. That&#39;s an extremely geeky approach.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One of the interesting things about Jobs, and certainly something he would&#39;ve said about himself, he did say about himself, was that he didn&#39;t, and that one shouldn&#39;t, slavishly follow the focus groups. People don&#39;t know what they want.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It&#39;s a combination of let&#39;s get input, but there is a lot of personal touch, personal feel. It&#39;s like &lt;em>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Moneyball-Art-Winning-Unfair-Game/dp/0393324818&quot;>;Moneyball&lt;/a>;&lt;/em>; versus the old school. Maybe the answer is a combination of skills.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ANDREW MCAFEE:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Absolutely. And Ted Sarandos, who&#39;s the co-CEO of Netflix, says their decision-making is pretty algorithmic. It&#39;s 70-30 algorithmic versus human judgment. But he said, if anything, the human judgment is on top, if that makes any sense.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I think that makes a ton of sense. This norm of science that the geeks are pretty passionate about, it&#39;s not just dry analysis and do whatever the data says. That&#39;s an inaccurate caricature.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Science is about settling arguments with evidence. It&#39;s a ground rule for how you&#39;re going to come to a decision. You&#39;re going to do a test, you&#39;re going to do an experiment. You&#39;re going to sit around in a group and argue about it. And if you can&#39;t agree, evidence is going to settle this issue.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Science is this inherently, deeply social, deeply argumentative process with a ground rule. Evidence is the queen here. That&#39;s what we&#39;re going to follow. And a lot of the geek companies that I respect do that as naturally as breathing.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One of the examples in your book of geek culture triumphing is Microsoft, and specifically when &lt;a href=&quot;/2021/10/microsofts-satya-nadella-on-flexible-work-the-metaverse-and-the-power-of-empathy&quot;>;Satya Nadella&lt;/a>; came in and rekindled that early success and more. Talk a bit about what he got right, particularly in the framework that you&#39;ve created.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ANDREW MCAFEE:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Can you think of a more impressive corporate turnaround story in living memory?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;No. Microsoft went from the tech company we liked least to maybe the one we like best.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ANDREW MCAFEE:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;And if you were an investor, you really didn&#39;t like it for about a decade. The stock price was flat as a corpse&#39;s EKG. And then Nadella took over, and it&#39;s become one of the most valuable companies in the world. It&#39;s an astonishing comeback story.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I got to interview Nadella for the book. He&#39;d made brilliant strategic moves, a bunch of them. You have Microsoft embracing open source, wow.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But I was interested in the cultural changes that he made. And he did a couple things that I think are straight out of the geek playbook. Some of them are obvious. He embraced agile development methods as widely and quickly as possible inside Microsoft. He did a couple things to reduce the sclerotic bureaucracy that was in place at Microsoft, which was just hamstringing their ability to do anything important out there in the world.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One of the brilliant things he did was say, “Look, you cannot own a digital resource inside Microsoft. You cannot own the data. You cannot own the code.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;And what he meant by that was you can&#39;t be the gatekeeper. You can&#39;t say yes or no to other groups who might want to use it. With that one simple move, he said to the company, “Look, if the AI group wants to go grab all of the GitHub code to train up a model to help provide assistance to programmers, you don&#39;t have to ask permission. Just go do that, subject to all the right constraints and safeties on it.” Man, that is an astonishingly good bureaucracy-reduction mechanism.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Maybe the deepest thing that Nadella did was that he pulled off this amazing feat of helping Microsoft become a less defensive organization. What I mean by that was, he said in his interview with me, “We had a culture where it was not OK to be wrong, to show any weakness, to not hit your numbers, to not be the smartest person in the room.” He said, “We just had that culture and it had to change.” He did a number of really brilliant things to move from a culture of defensiveness to a culture of openness.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When I used to hear this word, “vulnerability”, in connection with leadership or business, I thought it was just a buzz phrase, hand wavy, nonsense business. The company is not a therapy group. It&#39;s not there so you can sit around feeling vulnerable all the time. I was just wrong.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Now, the company is not your therapy group. However, a successful company needs to be a place where it&#39;s okay to be wrong, to fail, to not have the answer, to show that you&#39;re uncertain. Nadella helped get Microsoft down that path, and it was an absolutely fundamental thing to do.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I also interviewed Yamini Rangan, who&#39;s the CEO of HubSpot here in Cambridge, who took over a culture and has strengthened it through a really difficult time through the pandemic.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She discussed one of the things she learned and that she was good at was saying in this unbelievably uncertain time of the pandemic where tech companies were shrinking. It was all weird. She said to a lot of her constituencies, “Look, I don&#39;t know. I don&#39;t know what the future holds here. I&#39;m going to be honest with you.” She also shared her board performance review with her direct reports, not just the good parts, but the stuff that she needs to work on too. These are all just great moves to start to show the rest of the organization it is okay not to be perfect, not to put on the brave front, not to be winning all of the time.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Jack Welch&#39;s autobiography was called &lt;em>;Winning&lt;/em>;, and it epitomized this industrial era view of what you have to do all day every day. I love the geek view, which is, “Hey, man, we&#39;re going to launch some rockets and they are going to blow up. Now, we&#39;re not going to kill anybody, but we&#39;re absolutely going to launch some rockets that are going to blow up on the launchpad.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Bezos said a few years back in the shareholder&#39;s letter, “We are incubating multi-billion dollar failures inside Amazon right now. That&#39;s appropriate for a company of our scale.” And you look at Alexa and I think maybe he was right about that.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But the point is that this obsession with winning and being on top and being right and being dominant, that has to go away.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I want to get to audience questions. One came from Shabana in Pakistan. What kinds of organizational design, organizational structures, do you need to foster this sort of geek culture?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ANDREW MCAFEE:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I don&#39;t think org structure is the key because the companies that I surveyed have very, very different org charts. They also have very different formal practices.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Netflix is fairly famous for having the no-vacation-days policy. Amazon has extremely strict vacation policies for different levels of employee.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I think it&#39;s not a matter of the org chart or the org structure that you have. It&#39;s not so much a matter of how formal a lot of your policies are. It&#39;s a matter of your norms. I love that word and I use it in the book all the time.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A norm is a behavior that the people around you expect. Maybe it&#39;s written down in the employee manual. Very often it&#39;s not. It&#39;s community policing. It&#39;s what the people around you expect. If you go out of line and violate a norm in a community, you will know that fairly quickly and you will either come back into line or you&#39;re just not going to stick around very long.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you can work on these norms of science, argue about evidence, of ownership, push authority and decision-making down to an uncomfortable degree, speed, iterate, don&#39;t plan, don&#39;t analyze, build stuff, get feedback, learn from reality and then openness. Don&#39;t be defensive. Be willing to pivot. Be willing to admit that you&#39;re wrong. They show a little vulnerability. Those are the norms that are critical for the geek way.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So Bob from our audience is asking, “Is the stack of books on your right your reading list for the week?”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ANDREW MCAFEE:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These are from all over the place. But there was a stack of books that I kept referring to when I was writing &lt;em>;The Geek Way&lt;/em>;, and they were not business books. I am sorry to admit this as a business book writer.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;They were books from this relatively new field called cultural evolution, which gets at this fundamental question, “Why are we the only species on the planet that builds spaceships?” Nothing else is even close. We&#39;re really the only ones out there. The octopuses are not going to do it. The ants, the bees, the chimpanzees are not going to do it. Why are we humans the only spaceship-building species on the planet? This field of cultural evolution to me has come up with the best answer to that question, which is we are the only species that cooperates intensely with large numbers of people that we&#39;re not related to. We are the species that learns the quickest, that improves its toolkit, its technologies, its cultures most rapidly over time.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;You can take that and put that to work in a company. A company is a large group of mostly unrelated people. And the goal of a company is to improve its culture, its artifacts, its technologies, its practices over time. The goal of a company is to practice very rapid cultural evolution. Now that we know a bit about how cultural evolution happens, we can put those insights to work.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There&#39;s this massive unexplored opportunity to take the insights from this field and put them to work inside the company. I think it&#39;s so massive because I haven&#39;t heard anybody talk using cultural evolution&#39;s terms inside even very geeky companies. This is very, very new stuff. And I think &lt;em>;The Geek Way&lt;/em>; is the first applied business book of cultural evolution.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I think I just figured something out. You&#39;re a total geek.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ANDREW MCAFEE:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We&#39;ve been working together for years. It took you this long to realize this?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But the thing that I got obsessed with was that in my career, I&#39;ve spent a lot of time in the (I hate these labels) old economy and the new economy, lots of industrial-era incumbents, and then a lot of companies clustered in the tech space, clustered on the West Coast.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For my whole career, I have been trying to pattern match and figure out what the deep differences are between the two. Is it the foosball tables? Is it the hoodies? Is it bringing your dog to work? No, obviously not.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Where the action is in the economy, where the excitement is in the economy, what are they doing differently? And &lt;em>;The Geek Way&lt;/em>; contains my answers to that kind of career long, geeky, head scratching question.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Let&#39;s get practical for our viewers who aren&#39;t in classically geeky cultures. How can they apply the approaches you&#39;re championing, at their own companies?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ANDREW MCAFEE:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Here are a few things you can start doing tomorrow that are extremely geeky practices that will get some traction. When you&#39;re in charge of your group or you&#39;re a team member or you&#39;re leading a team, if you say things like, “Oh, that&#39;s a good point. I hadn&#39;t thought of that. Let&#39;s go that way,” or, “Oh, I was wrong about that. That&#39;s really good to know,” you have just demonstrated openness and vulnerability instead of classic defensiveness.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;That&#39;s hard to do. Human beings are inherently defensive people, we don&#39;t like being shown to be wrong in public. It&#39;s deeply uncomfortable. But if you model that behavior, it will start to spread. And I&#39;ve seen geek leaders do that over and over.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;You can start to push decisions and responsibility down to a place that makes you uncomfortable, and to get out of saying, “Just run that by me first,” or, “Make sure I&#39;m included on that,” and try to get rid of the hard and soft bureaucracy that gets in the way.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I was talking to &lt;a href=&quot;http://robots.stanford.edu/&quot;>;Sebastian Thrun&lt;/a>;, who&#39;s an alpha geek in all kinds of things, and he said, “One of the things I try to get my teams to do is stop so much communicating.” He had this great image. He said, “A team works on something, and then they run it up the flagpole.” He said the really natural tendency is for the people at every layer of the org chart to add something to that because they want to be part of the solution, they want to be part of this winning idea. By the time that idea gets back down to the originating team, it&#39;s unrecognizable. Get out of that business.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Again, this is uncomfortable stuff to do, but it&#39;s a big step toward the geek way. And then finally, you can start to say, “How are we going to make this decision? Can we agree on what evidence we&#39;re going to look at to make this decision?”, as opposed to saying, “Well, I&#39;m the boss,” or, “I got it right last time, so you should listen to me this time,” all these other ways we have to make decisions, credentials, hierarchy, charisma, excellent PowerPoint, all these things: get out of that business and start asking for the consensus on, “How are we going to settle this argument? What evidence are we going to look at?” These are all super geeky practices you can start doing tomorrow.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Here&#39;s another audience question. This is Lori from North Carolina, and it&#39;s another very practical question: how can organizations get leaders to unlearn the idea that failure is bad?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ANDREW MCAFEE:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is a super hard question, and I fall back on something that I learned from &lt;a href=&quot;/2020/01/the-essential-clayton-christensen-articles&quot;>;Clay Christensen&lt;/a>;: one of the things Clay taught me is that managers are voracious consumers of theory. He said, “Don&#39;t be afraid to tell them why this needs to change, what the principle, what the framework is.” And he said, “If you want to get people to change, there&#39;s a kind of a tripod. There are three things you have to do over and over again more until you&#39;re absolutely exhausted.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First of all, tell them a vivid story. We humans respond to narratives. Second, give them some evidence, give them some numbers to show that it works. And third, give them a theory. Explain why it works. You&#39;ve just got to go through all three of those legs.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Why can&#39;t we make decisions this way? I&#39;m a pretty smart person. I reached this place on the org chart because of my excellent judgment. What do you mean we should be relying a lot less on my judgment?” Again, three part answer to that question, keep iterating on it. It is not an easy process.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I think a lot of companies who get interested in what Silicon Valley does differently or might want to embrace the geek way are going to find it hard going because a lot of it is unnatural and uncomfortable. Challenging your boss in a meeting in most circumstances is uncomfortable, until it becomes a norm, until it becomes what people around you expect.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I can&#39;t let you go without talking a little bit about generative AI. You have an article in the next issue of HBR on how businesses can most effectively capitalize on the technology. What is your thinking, your quick overview, on the utility of GenAI, and its likely impact on, let&#39;s say, the white-collar workforce?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ANDREW MCAFEE:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The more I think about GenAI, the more I think we&#39;re underestimating its impact. It is so general, it is so powerful, it is improving so quickly, it&#39;s leading to so many complementary innovations. I have never seen the computer science geeks, the economic geeks, and the business geeks all get so excited about anything in my career, which is actually a quarter-century long by this point.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Generative AI is going to change the business world. It&#39;s probably going to do it quicker than a lot of us are thinking, and waiting around on the sidelines and not being part of that transformation is a deeply lousy strategy: get a plan together and then just go do stuff.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;All right, Andy, we&#39;ve run a little bit long, so we&#39;re going to cut you off here. I could talk all day with you about all these topics, and our audience is clearly into it and engaged. Thank you very much for being on the show.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ANDREW MCAFEE:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Adi, always a pleasure. Thank you for having me.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 16 Sep 2023 01:25:02 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[A More Impactful Strategy for Sustainable Investing]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/09/a-more-impactful-strategy-for-sustainable-investing]]><description>&lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/09/Sept23_15_1589828250.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;Hiroshi Watanabe/Getty Images&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;The effectiveness of sustainable investing has been challenged, with critics like Tariq Fancy describing it as a mere placebo. Amidst rising skepticism and stricter disclosure requirements, a deeper dive reveals that traditional methods of influencing companies, namely &amp;#8220;voice&amp;#8221; (shareholder engagement) and &amp;#8220;exit&amp;#8221; (portfolio screening), are not exhaustive. Through a comprehensive review of over 3,500 research papers, a new approach &amp;#8212; &amp;#8220;field building&amp;#8221; &amp;#8212;出现。 This tactic acknowledges the interconnected web of stakeholders around companies, termed &amp;#8220;fields&amp;#8221;, that profoundly influence corporate behavior. By reshaping these fields, investors can indirectly drive sustainable change in firms. Five tactics are highlighted: (1) Shifting other investors&amp;#8217; evaluation of issues, (2) Sharing expertise, (3) Delegitimizing certain business activities, (4) Establishing voluntary standards, and (5) Supporting regulatory changes. While promising, field-building presents challenges like profitability and political exposure. Yet, by embracing this expanded toolkit, investors can magnify their positive impact and appeal to an increasingly conscious investment clientele.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/a-more-impactful-strategy-for-sustainable-investing?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/a-more-impactful-strategy-for-sustainable-investing?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;Whether sustainable investors can have a positive impact on business and society has been the center of debate in recent years. One major obstacle holding sustainable investing back from maximizing its impact is that most investors operate with too narrow of an understanding of how impact can come about. Most investors believe they have two primary ways to influence companies. First, there&#39;s portfolio screening, often termed “exit.” In this approach, investors shift capital from non-sustainable to sustainable companies. The second strategy is shareholder engagement, frequently called “voice.” Here, investors directly urge companies to adopt more sustainable practices through means like meetings, shareholder proposals, or voting.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But in our research, we have found that some unconventional investors go beyond the “exit” versus “voice” dichotomy. We have mapped their activities through a &lt;a href=&quot;https://eur03.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fonlinelibrary.wiley.com%2Fdoi%2Fepdf%2F10.1111%2Fjoms.12957&amp;amp;data=05%7C01%7Cmarti%40rsm.nl%7C5617faa4f4e6474822f608dbae59fdb1%7C715902d6f63e4b8d929b4bb170bad492%7C0%7C0%7C638295474207071901%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=qcr%2FaLPS2qF%2FkUPnG%2FDtSQEMQjLx0nl%2BrNN2UuL8oD8%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0&quot;>;systematic review of research&lt;/a>; for which we screened more than 3,500 research papers on sustainable investing. Based on this review and conversations we&#39;ve had with practitioners, we put forth a case for a third, potentially more impactful sustainable investing strategy: &lt;em>;field building.&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Field building works because companies are always embedded in fields. The term “fields” is closely related to industries, but broader. Fields encompass both companies (eg, oil and gas companies) and the stakeholders with which companies interact most frequently (eg, investors, regulators, or media). Through these interactions, actors within fields develop assumptions, norms, and rules that shape the behavior of companies within a field. In short, a field captures those parts of the external environment of a company that have the most direct influence on a company. Field building means that investors influence companies by changing the (1) stakeholders and (2) assumptions, norms, and rules that surround companies, thereby exerting their influence on companies indirectly.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We have found five tactics for field building that sustainable investors can use to increase their impact.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Shifting other investors&#39; evaluation of issues&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;As a first tactic for field building, investors can shift other investors&#39; evaluation of environmental and social issues. By publicly and continuously highlighting these environmental and social issues, an investor can raise attention to environmental and social issues among other investors and thereby motivate these other investors to influence companies.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This tactic is particularly relevant for investors that do not have enough assets under management or status to directly influence companies. By influencing larger investors with more direct influence on companies, investors can change the fields in which companies operate in ways that expose companies to more pressure for corporate sustainability.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Dutch shareholder “FollowThis” has used this first tactic very successfully since 2014 to influence oil and gas companies. FollowThis submits shareholder proposals on behalf of over 10,000 individuals who have bought shares of oil and gas companies. While FollowThis has neither the assets under management nor the elite status to be taken very seriously by oil and gas companies themselves, their approach has been very successful in influencing big Dutch pension funds. Some pension funds followed suit after their initial refusal to support FollowThis led to protests from beneficiaries and negative media attention — including ABP, the largest Dutch pension fund with over 500 billion Euro assets under management.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Sharing expertise with other investors&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;A second tactic for field building is to share expertise with other investors. Investors that are new to sustainable investing often struggle with the inherent complexity of environmental and social issues, and know neither what demands are realistic nor how to raise their demand in ways that make business sense for companies. By making private information publicly available, investors can empower other investors to influence companies. When other investors know more about sustainability, this creates additional pressure for corporate sustainability within the fields in which companies operate.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The international asset manager Robeco has used this tactic since August 2022, when it made its SDG framework openly accessible. This framework assesses the degree to which over 2,900 companies advance or undermine the 17 sustainable development goals (SDGs). Having used the framework internally since 2018, Robeco&#39;s decision to make their SDG framework open access not only establishes Robeco as a leader in that space. Access to this framework can help less experienced investors incorporate sustainability into their investment decisions.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Delegitimizing certain business activities&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;A third tactic for field building is to delegitimize business activities that are particularly harmful for the environment and society. Companies can only operate in fields in which key stakeholders — such as policymakers, consumers, suppliers, or the media — see their activities as legitimate. If these stakeholders start to see certain business activities as illegitimate, it can create existential problems for companies. Given these dynamics, investors that publicly problematize certain business activities can play a key role in changing widely shared assumptions about whether these business activities are legitimate or not.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Investors within the fossil fuel divestment movement have used this tactic very successfully. Since 2012, over 1,500 investors have publicly announced they would divest from fossil fuel companies, including the city of Chicago in 2022 and the Church of England in 2023. Proponents of the divestment movement make clear that, “&lt;a href=&quot;https://eur03.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgofossilfree.org%2Fusa%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2015%2F03%2FFossilFreeFrequentlyAskedQuestions.pdf&amp;amp;data=05%7C01%7Cmarti%40rsm.nl%7C5617faa4f4e6474822f608dbae59fdb1%7C715902d6f63e4b8d929b4bb170bad492%7C0%7C0%7C638295474207071901%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=AQBOvhTOgqMHpVyU1VprefUIR%2Foa%2BwCWQxS8Ns1s31g%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0&quot;>;Divestment isn&#39;t primarily an economic strategy, but a moral and political one&lt;/a>;.” They realize that their main influence does not come from increasing the cost of capital of fossil fuel companies in the short term, but by gradually changing public opinion about fossil fuel companies. Research shows that the divestment movement has influenced the views and actions of important stakeholders, including banks that have withheld credit from fossil fuel companies and students who have committed to not work for fossil fuel companies.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Establishing voluntary standards&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;A fourth tactic for field building is to establish voluntary sustainability standards. Voluntary standards have become a central instrument to advance corporate sustainability. They include codes of conduct, certification standards, and reporting standards, and may focus on single fields (eg, Equator Principles for project financing) or multiple fields (eg, the GRI reporting standard). Investors have played a major role in establishing voluntary standards, and have thereby reshaped the rules of the fields in which companies operate.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Investors that are active in the “Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures” have employed this tactic. Biodiversity loss and other nature-related risks are complex challenges, and many companies have little expertise on how to address them. Since 2020, investors have used the Taskforce to develop voluntary standards for corporate reporting on how companies harm nature and how nature creates risks for companies. After extensive stakeholder dialogue, pilot testing, and industry feedback, the Taskforce will release its final version in September 2023, which we expect will transform the nature-related parts of sustainability reporting.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Supporting regulatory changes&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;The fifth and final tactic for field building is to support regulatory changes that set mandatory standards for corporate sustainability. Once multiple companies within a field voluntarily engage in a sustainability-related activity, and thereby prove that such activities are technically and financially viable, regulatory interventions may be necessary to force laggard companies to follow suit. Following this logic, the number of laws related to corporate sustainability has &lt;a href=&quot;https://eur03.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.unpri.org%2Fpolicy%2Fregulation-database&amp;amp;data=05%7C01%7Cmarti%40rsm.nl%7C5617faa4f4e6474822f608dbae59fdb1%7C715902d6f63e4b8d929b4bb170bad492%7C0%7C0%7C638295474207071901%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=ZU3kycbEnn1GGmNwOIEHqUZNY11kMLAbEez1q7CfgcM%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0&quot;>;almost tripled between 2013 and 2023&lt;/a>;, from around 300 to almost 900. Given their investments in different types of companies, investors can provide valuable insights to policymakers and regulators about regulatory changes that seek to advance corporate sustainability.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some investors have used this tactic to shape the upcoming European Sustainability Reporting Standards, which will be mandatory for all companies operating in the European Union from 2028 onwards. While the April 2022 draft of this law contained strict disclosure requirements, the number of disclosure requirements were weakened in a subsequent draft due to pushback from companies. In February 2023, eleven investors and several sustainable investing industry associations wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;https://eur03.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdp.net%2Fen%2Farticles%2Fcompanies%2F60-companies-and-investors-worth-651bn-tell-eu-to-agree-ambitious-sustainability-reporting-standards&amp;amp;data=05%7C01%7Cmarti%40rsm.nl%7C5617faa4f4e6474822f608dbae59fdb1%7C715902d6f63e4b8d929b4bb170bad492%7C0%7C0%7C638295474207071901%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=dR4a7ipqlhcBhrCvxZCvnS4Td9USAyRarHM%2FEP%2FZJq8%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0&quot;>;public letter&lt;/a>; to policymakers of the European Union in which they urged policymakers to go back to strict disclosure requirement to “ensure a level playing field… for companies that already contribute to a nature-positive economy.”&lt;/p>; &lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;. 。 .&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Each of the five tactics can change the fields in which companies operate, thereby creating additional pressure for companies to become more sustainable. Despite these opportunities for increasing their impact, two reasons may deter investors from venturing into field building.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One reason is profitability. It can be difficult to make a business case for field building over the short term. Field building mostly generates costs for an investor, while benefits will be captured by other investors, including those in the future. Yet, given that many individuals are willing to accept lower returns if their investments create greater impact, they may seek out asset managers that engage in field building even if higher management fees slightly lower their returns.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another reason is political exposure. Field building requires that asset managers publicly take a stance on sustainability issues, which could lead to backlash by people with different views — a risk that is higher among asset managers that cater to a wide range of customers. These asset managers can limit this risk by doing field building on sustainability issues for which a broad consensus exists among their customers and that are backed by a strong business case.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;By broadening their toolbox of tactics, and mastering field building, investors can better position themselves to have a more positive impact on the environment and society — and, in doing so, attract more individual investors that care about impact.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 15 Sep 2023 23:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[How to Get Honest and Substantive Feedback from Your Customers]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/09/how-to-get-honest-and-substantive-feedback-from-your-customers]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/09/Sept23_15_1433543803-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;SvetaZi/Getty Images&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;Businesses can&amp;#8217;t improve operations without honest and substantive feedback. Customers can be reluctant to provide it, for several reasons. Companies can try to overcome this by focusing feedback requests on improvement (not employee assessment), focusing on customer actions instead of words, and approaching the gathering of feedback as a habit rather than an occasional effort.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/how-to-get-honest-and-substantive-feedback-from-your-customers?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/how-to-get-honest-and-substantive-feedback-from-your-customers?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;“How&#39;s everything so far?”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Fine, thank you.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In restaurants around the world, the “check-in dance” between servers and customers is pervasive. Servers ask how things are after customers receive their meal, and nearly all patrons reflexively respond with an automatic “fine, thanks.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the surface, it seems like the start of a feedback loop, but real feedback rarely materializes. Chances are the server isn&#39;t seeking a detailed critique, like whether the fish skin was crispy enough or the vegetables were over-seasoned. They&#39;re ensuring the meal is acceptable so that the dining process moves forward. Similarly, the diner often sidesteps genuine, constructive feedback, opting to maintain social etiquette and avoid a long interaction.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Both sides lose in this dance of niceties. The restaurant loses the opportunity to identify operational shortcomings, improve its product, and grow its reputation and customer base. The diner loses the opportunity to feel thrilled with the experience they receive and even — potentially — to be emotionally invested in the business.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Recently, one of us (Steve) and his wife, Michelle, were met with a different version of the dance at an upscale Brooklyn pop-up. The chef personally introduced a dish with the intention of combining several “luxury” ingredients. The dish just didn&#39;t work — at all. Michelle and Steve picked at it politely. But the dance departed from the typical choreography when instead of a server stopping by, the chef came out and asked a more pointed question, making it clear that he wasn&#39;t looking for politeness. “I&#39;ve been tinkering with that dish for a while and know it has a lot of elements, but does it &lt;em>;come together&lt;/em>; for you? I can&#39;t get better if I don&#39;t hear honest feedback.” The sincerity and sense of safety that the chef brought to the conversation allowed the diners to share that the dish just didn&#39;t work for them. It also made Steve and Michelle more engaged and interested in the restaurant&#39;s success, and they returned several weeks later to see that the dish had been adjusted and improved.&lt;/p>; &lt;article-promo>; &lt;hbr-component type=&quot;promo&quot; is-insight=&quot;insight-center&quot; title=&quot;The New Age of Operations&quot; dek=&quot;Improving efficiency and increasing resilience.&quot; cta-text=&quot;&quot; href=&quot;/insight-center/the-new-age-of-operations&quot;>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/insight-center/the-new-age-of-operations&quot; style=&quot;color:black;text-decoration:none&quot;>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; Insight Center Collection &lt;/div>; &lt;h3>;The New Age of Operations&lt;/h3>; &lt;div>; Improving efficiency and increasing resilience. &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hbr-component>; &lt;/article-promo>; &lt;p>;Many businesses have lost sight of this foundational operating principle and treat their customer feedback machine as a necessary evil to be fulfilled in the least-costly and least-awkward way possible. Smaller companies, which tend to be pressed for resources, may put little effort into trying to get customer feedback. Managers at small and medium-sized companies may feel like a robust customer feedback mechanism is a luxury that must wait until the company is larger.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;That&#39;s short-sighted, because true operational effectiveness comes from tweaking things that need to be changed &lt;em>;from a customer&#39;s vantage point&lt;/em>;. While obtaining feedback is crucial, it is only valuable if it&#39;s authentic. The challenge is that customers often shy away from such conversations, and businesses, unfortunately, tend to reinforce this reluctance in their approach to seeking feedback. The whole system has become so encumbered and obfuscated from its original purpose that in most circumstances it has become a useless ritual — one that may even destroy value.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Fixing the Problem&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;The fault with this dysfunctional feedback loop lies with both companies and customers. Companies have designed feedback systems aimed primarily for ease of customer input and quantification, leading to the innumerable requests we get to “please stay on the line to take a short survey after this call.” The last thing most customers want to do after phoning in to customer service is spend &lt;em>;more&lt;/em>; time on the phone. On the rare occasions when customers try to provide honest feedback in person, they are often met with defensive postures from staff members who are trained to “defuse” the situation instead of digging deeper for actionable feedback. In fact, often the best way to defuse the situation is to show a legitimate interest in hearing about the feedback!&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Customers also contribute to this problem. Humans are risk and conflict averse, so we generally try to avoid “high-stakes” interactions. The first step to fixing feedback systems is to understand why customers perceive them this way:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Honest feedback feels like a cognitive burden&lt;em>;.&lt;/em>;&lt;/strong>; Most of us avoid difficult and emotional conversations because they are, well, difficult. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gse.harvard.edu/ideas/news/13/11/remembering-professor-chris-argyris&quot;>;Chris Argyris&lt;/a>;, the late founder of the body of work called &lt;a href=&quot;https://thesystemsthinker.com/overcoming-defensive-routines-in-the-workplace/&quot;>;&lt;em>;productive interactions&lt;/em>;&lt;/a>;&lt;em>;, &lt;/em>;noted that there are three strategies people can use in situations of conflict: (1) &lt;em>;Bypass&lt;/em>; &lt;em>;— &lt;/em>;avoid discussing the issue and move on; (2) &lt;em>;Name&lt;/em>; — note the problem, but don&#39;t discuss it; and (3) &lt;em>;Engage&lt;/em>; — actually discuss the problem. The risk to the relationship is higher as you move up that scale, so people tend to employ &lt;em>;bypass &lt;/em>;in most situations. In the case of customer feedback, bypassing is saying things are fine, even if they are not.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;The consequences of feedback feel unnecessarily high. &lt;/strong>;This is especially true when the forum is one of many online public review sites. One of us (Elizabeth) recently found herself debating whether she wanted to write an honest review of a small business — one she was rooting for to succeed. It had a great product, but sub-par service. But an honest review would have the unintended effect of publicizing the service problems, so she just passed.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Fear of retaliation. &lt;/strong>;Some customers refrain from feedback for fear of retaliation. To continue the restaurant analogy, this might entail the dreaded image of kitchen staff tainting food in some way. Indeed, we often hear stories from customers who are repeatedly disappointed in some small way by a business, but don&#39;t want to give feedback for fear that it would impact the relationship. In effect, the customer seems to value the relationship with the business more than the service or product it provides.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Feedback requests have become like white noise.&lt;/strong>; Every business asks for feedback in every interaction, creating a situation similar to an inversion of the tragedy of the commons. Instead of an individual consuming a resource at the expense of the collective, the collective is ignoring a request at the expense of the business.&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;Some might ask whether this is a problem worth solving. Don&#39;t we get enough hints at issues from today&#39;s feedback system? We would argue no. The issue is that unhappy customers often just quit. They don&#39;t give warning — they just don&#39;t come back. So the real problem to be solved is that your “formal” feedback mechanisms might be saying that everything&#39;s fine, but you might have a service issue brewing. This can result in fast downward spirals and reputation issues that are hard to recover from. Like most health issues, prevention and/or early detection are far preferable to stronger interventions once the situation has become worse.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We offer several thoughts on how to improve:&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Make improvement your goal, not assessment.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Because companies use customer feedback to assess employee performance, many of us have experienced the plea from a customer service rep to rate them a “5 out of 5,” possibly taking a positive experience and ending it in an awkward (if not downright negative) way. It&#39;s not the employee&#39;s fault — it&#39;s the system that&#39;s in use.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We suggest reframing feedback questions to make it clear that the organization is seeking to improve — not to be told it&#39;s doing well. Instead of asking “how did I do?” ask “what&#39;s one thing could I do to have served you better today?” Invite the customer to join you in a journey for a better experience. You might need to teach your people to ask good second and third questions to solicit better feedback, because a broad-based initial question may not be sufficient for some customers to generate ideas. Training them to do this will be worth the effort.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Disproportionally focus on what customers do, not what they say.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;As noted above, customers are not inclined to share their thoughts or feelings unless things are either really bad or if the interaction is framed in the right way. So instead of tracking “sentiment,” which can be misleading, track and observe customer behavior. How often are customers repeating purchases? How frequently do they come to your store or site? What do they do when they&#39;re there? In the case of a restaurant, which entrees come back half-eaten and which inspire clean plates?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Systematically capturing this behavioral feedback requires a combination of data analysis to track large groups of customers to see patterns, but also, non-statistically significant observations by your frontline employees. Is there something they&#39;re noticing customers doing that indicates dissatisfaction? For instance, employees of a coffee stand might observe customers wrapping their cups in napkins; perhaps it means that the cup is too hot to hold? By combining data on customer behavior with the power of observation, businesses can generate hypotheses on how they can continually improve the quality of their operations.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Make this a habit, not a periodic intervention.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;As noted above, service issues can fester over time, causing customers to quit without warning. Prevention in this case is curative. So switch up that bi-annual or quarterly survey instrument in favor of mechanisms that are continual and part of your culture.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Finally, if you want to take it to the next level, consider pairing experimentation with your feedback efforts. Make a small change and ask for feedback. Or make a more significant change in a small area of your business and see how customers respond. Pairing experimentation with an eye to observing customers and seeking honest input is a mechanism to continually improve your operations — as is seeing feedback as both a gift and an imperative.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;By welcoming feedback as both a precious insight and a mandate, organizations can foster a vibrant and adaptive business environment that is responsive to customer needs and preferences. Establishing a genuine and meaningful feedback loop has the potential to elevate a business&#39;s operational standards considerably. Creating a culture that encourages feedback and sees customers not as sources of approval or disapproval, but as partners who can contribute to the betterment of a company&#39;s offering, is an important way to rethink the typical, unhelpful feedback dance that exists today.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 15 Sep 2023 22:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Sustainability Is About Your Workforce, Too]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/09/sustainability-is-about-your-workforce-too]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/09/Sept23_15_1219011427.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;Javier Zayas Photography/Getty Images&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;In recent years, many companies hired chief sustainability officers and established a set of high-priority programs to reduce carbon emissions and the risk of global climate change.

The enactment of these new regulations signals a new era in which it&#39;s time to extend the concept of sustainability to include similarly critical issues with the workforce — an idea I call people sustainability.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;People sustainability takes a holistic approach to corporate human capital practices, including diversity and inclusion, well-being, employee safety, and fair pay. It raises these human capital issues to the C-suite and obliges chief human resource officers to work with chief sustainability officers on these programs. It means that your employee well-being efforts are no longer delivered piecemeal, which was ineffective no matter how well-intentioned or resourced they might be.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The EU is essentially saying that all these “HR programs” are much bigger than HR: They now fall into the category of global citizenship mandates, and companies must treat and report them as such.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;How to Integrate People Sustainability into Your Company&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;I&#39;m talking to European and US firms about how they are gearing up for the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive and developing people sustainability metrics.&amp;nbsp;Here are examples of how a few companies are approaching this:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;Heineken has developed standard measurements of human rights, fair pay, and even living conditions for all its contract workers helping it deliver beverage sales around the world.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Enterprise software leader SAP has &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.sap.com/2022/10/people-sustainability-investment-sap-research/&quot;>;coupled its industry-leading diversity program to new pay equity and sustainability initiatives&lt;/a>;. For example, the company now openly publishes all pay bands so employees can see where they are and the pay scales for all new jobs posted. In parallel, it provides hiring and workplace support for neurodivergent employees. After undertaking a progressive gender pay equity analysis, it inaugurated a very aggressive program of promotions of women into senior leadership — all long-term “people sustainability” strategies.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Financial services firm Liberty Mutual sees people sustainability as a factor in limiting the global risks of its customers, partners, and employees in the face of accelerating climate change. Chief sustainability officer Francis Hyatt, who previously served as executive vice president of enterprise talent practices, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.libertymutualgroup.com/about-lm/corporate-information/sustainability/corporate-sustainability&quot;>;oversees the integration of global climate issues&lt;/a>; in the firm&#39;s risk management approach and promotes sustainability solutions for employees, resellers, and customers. The company promotes thought-through generational and gender equality programs, and Hyatt ensures that every employee understands how their long-term safety and success is part of the company&#39;s overall sustainability strategy. In other words, this new job function unifies all the brand&#39;s existing HR work into the context of sustainability and helping the planet.&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;What links all three of these major corporations is the way each separately discovered that when you frame human capital investment in the context of sustainability, it assumes even more importance than it did before.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you see value in this approach, where should you start at your organization? Building on the European Union&#39;s new detailed CSRD reporting requirements, leaders will need to address issues ranging from greenhouse gas emissions to gender pay across their own operations, as well as that of their suppliers and business partners. You should try to ensure sustainability becomes a pillar of operations as early as possible, as the compliance clock is ticking.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The real action is to get your HR team to start working as soon as possible with their ESG colleagues to get people sustainability metrics and strategies into your business goals. To drive this, bring together a team including your heads of HR, DEI, and ESG, as well as representatives from your corporate finance and legal teams, to design your people sustainability program. You&#39;ll ultimately want to see these goals reflected in your annual report and other stakeholder communications, so that these programs are seen as a core part of company strategy.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A recent survey by PwC reveals that many CEOs anticipate &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/news-room/press-releases/2023/pwc-26th-ceo-survey.html&quot;>;climate risk will affect their cost profiles&lt;/a>; and supply chains in the next year. However, despite these challenges, 60% of the surveyed CEOs do not plan to reduce headcount, and 80% do not plan to decrease compensation, as they recognize the importance of retaining talented employees.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Data like this underlines how people sustainability has become an integral strategy for corporate growth. Investors will soon begin to measure the effectiveness of a company&#39;s well-being initiatives as a key metric of overall performance as much as its P&amp;amp;L.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;You don&#39;t have to be directly affected by Europe&#39;s new sustainability laws to see that bringing together previously disconnected efforts such as DEI, purpose, or L&amp;amp;D under the umbrella of “long-term organizational sustainability” makes a lot of sense.

The UAW and many other trade unions should be equally concerned about the impact of AI and automation on jobs and how to prepare their members for this new world.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/the-uaw-and-other-unions-must-focus-more-on-ai-and-automation-in-their-negotiations?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/the-uaw-and-other-unions-must-focus-more-on-ai-and-automation-in-their-negotiations?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;The advance of AI and automation technologies in the workplace requires new approaches to labor relations. Yet efforts by such trade unions as the United Auto Workers, Teamsters, and International Warehouse and Longshore Union efforts to negotiate a better future for their members appear to be stuck in the past.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This short-sightedness is especially worrying for young workers, who need effective representation at a time when the AI-driven workplace is taking shape. Employers should also be concerned because a lack of worker engagement in the change process today stores up problems for the future.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Both sides should take to heart the protracted strike involving Hollywood actors and writers. The actors union SAG-AFTRA recently joined the Writers Guild of America on the picket lines for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/story/2023-06-29/what-to-know-sag-aftra-strike-actors-hollywood&quot;>;first time in 63 years&lt;/a>;. The use of AI by movie and TV producers is one of the key issues that divides the sides. For example, there are concerns that computerized simulations of actors could replace the actors themselves, and writers will be relegated to refining AI-generated scripts. Resolving these issues will take time, but at least in this case, the parties have started the process before AI has become an industry mainstay.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;A Familiar Pattern&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;But other unions don&#39;t seem to be facing up to the ways technological advances will change jobs. Consider the recent deal struck by UPS and the Teamsters to increase the average annual pay for a full-time driver to about $170,000, &lt;a href=&quot;https://teamster.org/2023/07/weve-changed-the-game-teamsters-win-historic-ups-contract/&quot;>;touted&lt;/a>; as historic and a game changer by the trade union.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The agreement has achieved significant pay gains for workers but fails to adequately address issues such as how to prepare employees for automation. The future may involve fewer drivers operating not behind the wheel of a truck or van but behind a console as they manage fleets of autonomous vehicles.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A recent labor deal in the ports industry indicates a similar lack of attention to tech-related challenges. In August 2023, the International Warehouse and Longshore Union &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/dockworkers-ratify-labor-deal-at-west-coast-ports-f0dc23e?mod=djemlogistics_h&quot;>;confirmed&lt;/a>; it ratified a new, six-year contract with port employers that includes a 32% pay rise and a one-time (and well-deserved) “hero bonus” for dockworkers who worked through the pandemic. Meanwhile, the automation gap between North American ports like Los Angeles and facilities in Asia and Europe, such as Singapore, Dubai, Rotterdam, and Hamburg, has become disturbingly wide. Addressing this disparity and preparing workers for an automated future should be high on the labor-relations agenda.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Auto workers also face transformative change. Their industry is turning away from fossil fuel-burning cars in favor of electric vehicles and self-driving technology. The shift requires new, modern manufacturing platforms that fully utilize automation and different skill sets. Meanwhile, United Auto Workers union members &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/business/autos/uaw-members-vote-to-authorize-potential-strike-db4dbd7a&quot;>;recently authorized&lt;/a>; strike action against Detroit automakers should an agreement on a 46% pay increase and a 32-hour work week fail to be reached this year. But other issues, notably how to prepare workers for a changing workplace, should also be central to the negotiations.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Emerging Issues&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Of particular concern across most industries is the anticipated disappearance of many entry-level jobs, as algorithms take over much of the work of young recruits in areas such as computer programming, legal research, and product assembly lines. But without these jobs, how will junior workers gain the on-the-job experience they need to climb the career ladder and become future leaders in their chosen disciplines? Where will tomorrow&#39;s senior programmers or experienced lawyers come from?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another question that needs to be addressed is how to train people to work alongside AI in the workplace.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are various models for such coworker relationships. For example, AI-generated information is passed on to human managers to make decisions. Chipmaker Intel uses this approach to improve buying decisions. Procurement managers use information such as supplier-performance assessments produced by AI systems in their decision-making. Another framework employs AI systems to perform routine work but requires humans to intervene when there is an abnormal change in the operating environment. The onset of a pandemic or a system&#39;s unexpected behavior are examples of uncommon situations that require uniquely human attributes, such as understanding the context to recognize a problem and flexibility and adaptability to solve it.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Worker representatives and employers must develop ways to embed these frameworks and others in work practices to ensure that workers can fulfill such roles and pivot as necessary as new roles emerge.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;The Case for Urgency&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Now is the time to start thinking about these issues because the transition to an AI-driven workplace will not happen overnight. We have seen this in past waves of tech-infused change. For instance, in 2003, Walmart told its top 100 suppliers that it was about to mandate the installation of RFID tags on some one billion cases per year. The technology would deliver multiple benefits such as improved inventory accuracy and fewer out-of-stock instances. Industry pundits predicted that RFID would quickly become ubiquitous in supply chains. In reality, technical glitches and the high cost of tags stalled the technology&#39;s adoption. It took another 16 years for item-level RFID to come back into fashion.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;AI&#39;s adoption rate may be more rapid, but employers and employees have time to prepare for the workplace changes it will inevitably bring. Moreover, even if many workers stay in the same jobs with the same titles in the short to medium term, their jobs will change. They will likely see more repetitive tasks delegated to automated systems and have to perform more monitoring functions.&amp;nbsp; The demand for new skills — such as the ability to use a growing array of data and to spot aberrations that might disrupt automated processes — will increase.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Today&#39;s workers need ongoing, incremental re-skilling or upskilling to maintain a stable or improving career path. Displaced workers need substantive retraining to get their next job or career. Young people entering the workforce need a foundation of skills aligned with their aptitudes and the prevailing demand for human labor.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A range of educational programs, from bite-sized, on-demand learning to mid-length skill-certification programs, is required in response to these shifting demands. Updated high school, college, and post-graduate degree programs will also be needed. Unions should demand that companies invest in their members&#39; futures.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Short-Lived Advantages&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Negotiating pay and benefits concessions will always be a high priority for trade unions and their members. Today, in the current post-pandemic period, labor shortages strengthen unions&#39; bargaining positions. However, this environment will shift as AI and automation accelerate.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The pace of change is a cause for concern. AI is advancing rapidly, so the longer labor and employer representatives take to confront worker-related issues, the more difficult it will be to address them.&amp;nbsp;Now is the time for labor unions to use their leverage — which may not last long as AI tools become better — to ensure the future of their members.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 15 Sep 2023 20:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[How Off-the-Shelf Tech Can Make Factories More Profitable]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/09/how-off-the-shelf-tech-can-make-factories-more-profitableespecially-for-smaller-companies]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/08/Sep23_09_BLeOMjOFl1Y_343457_459728.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;HBR Staff/Unsplash/Pexels&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;Too often, smaller companies are intimidated by the high costs, complexity, and long installation times that high-end smart factory systems can require. This is short-sighted. Companies can see big financial benefits by utilizing existing data and simpler technologies to reduce waste, labor costs, overhead, and utility expenses.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/how-off-the-shelf-tech-can-make-factories-more-profitableespecially-for-smaller-companies?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/how-off-the-shelf-tech-can-make-factories-more-profitableespecially-for-smaller-companies?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;It&#39;s possible to turn a factory into a smart factory much faster and cheaper than most executives think.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When many people imagine a smart factory, they envision something complicated and expensive — the kind of massive “manufacturing execution system,” or MES, that can take more than a year and millions of dollars to implement. If you&#39;re Elon Musk, you can pour money into advanced automation and robotics — and keep pouring. But you don&#39;t need to be Elon Musk. Many of the greatest benefits of intelligent manufacturing require much less time and money.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many smart factory proponents, bedazzled by technology, overlook the biggest potential sources of value creation. We&#39;ve seen this in visits to hundreds of manufacturing sites over the last five years: that most manufacturers make far too little use of readily available data. Labor hours, for instance; those numbers are collected for payroll, but rarely extracted from clock-in/out systems and analyzed to discover ways to operate more efficiently. Similarly, off-the-shelf RFID technology can trace scrap origins, and simple Internet of Things (IoT) sensors can deliver real-time insights into utility usage. The ability to see, analyze, and act on information immediately can have as much impact on factory profitability as advanced robotics, at much lower cost.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The low-tech, low-cost path to a smart factory works for companies of any size and is especially well suited to the appetites and abilities of midsized companies. Middle market executives report being &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/05/how-midsize-companies-can-make-the-most-of-disruption&quot;>;daunted by disruption, especially in technolog&lt;/a>;y. In an unpublished survey conducted by AlixPartners this summer, 55% of companies with revenues under $500 million a year said technological change is happening too fast for them to keep up; just 24% of larger companies said the same. They don&#39;t need to be scared. Instead, the middle market can be the prime beneficiary of the revolutionary democratization of the digital realm. In recent years, cloud computing platforms have brought sophisticated capabilities within reach of almost every company, and sensors and cameras that once needed to be custom-built can now be acquired and adapted inexpensively. These changes empower enterprises of all sizes with state-of-the-art tools for smart factories.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When properly designed and deployed, a smart-factory strategy can accelerate efforts to solve the worker shortage, bridge the skills gap, decarbonize operations, shorten lead times, or nearshore. The key is knowing where to begin.&lt;/p>; &lt;article-promo>; &lt;hbr-component type=&quot;promo&quot; is-insight=&quot;insight-center&quot; title=&quot;The New Age of Operations&quot; dek=&quot;Improving efficiency and increasing resilience.&quot; cta-text=&quot;&quot; href=&quot;/insight-center/the-new-age-of-operations&quot;>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/insight-center/the-new-age-of-operations&quot; style=&quot;color:black;text-decoration:none&quot;>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; Insight Center Collection &lt;/div>; &lt;h3>;The New Age of Operations&lt;/h3>; &lt;div>; Improving efficiency and increasing resilience. &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hbr-component>; &lt;/article-promo>; &lt;p>;Start by identifying the business issue you are trying to solve. Companies should focus on the factory P&amp;amp;L and identify KPIs and metrics that directly impact on it. The next step is to figure out how to apply smart-factory concepts and tools to improve performance on those specific benchmarks, which typically include overall equipment effectiveness, machine/asset utilization, productivity, and throughput.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Take, for example, a commercial bakery in the northeast United States with annual revenues of about $200 million.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The company realized $1.5 million in annual savings, which increased EBITDA by 4.8%, through targeted smart factory solutions centered on three business issues: reducing scrap and other waste, improving labor costs, and cutting energy use. The company was able to address all three issues with relatively simple technology.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A major cause of waste, for example, was baked goods that came off the line underweight (which had to be discarded) or overweight (which used more dough than necessary). By installing digital scales and sensors on the existing manufacturing line, the company caught that waste before it was (literally) baked in — reducing scrap by 25%. A homemade labor visibility and utilization dashboard provided a similar real-time view of labor presence on the factory floor, revealing that a significant number of workers were staying on after their shifts; without a real-time way to track the behavior, managers had been unable to enforce shift times; with the tool, overtime dropped 50%.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Finally, by installing IoT sensors and connecting data feed with existing systems to monitor utilities consumption, annual utilities spend was cut by 5% because, among other things, it revealed when equipment was being run unnecessarily.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What made these gains — which took less than six months — possible? In our work with manufacturers, we have identified four best practices that help make smart factory projects affordable and successful.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Make the plant&#39;s P&amp;amp;L your focus.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Most practitioners define “smart factory” in terms of software technologies (such as AI, machine learning, and warehouse management systems) or intelligent hardware (like connected devices and computer vision). Any or all of these can be part of a smart factory — but a focus on tools or technologies runs the risk of not seeing the opportunity. In our experience, an approach that defines a smart factory with the lens of plant P&amp;amp;L brings pragmatism that is required for success on the plant floor.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Identify all the cost drivers.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Most smart factory initiatives look only at the operations inside a factory&#39;s four walls — and especially at production lines themselves. A program that looks only at overall equipment effectiveness (OEE) addresses less than a quarter of the factory&#39;s full costs, which are spread out across company departments. In a typical consumer goods operation, ingredients are about 45% of cost and packaging 20%; direct labor, indirect labor, and overhead are about 10% each (each managed by different teams); and utilities account for about 5%. All of those can be sources of digitally-driven value creation.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Leverage existing plant assets.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;You don&#39;t need to replace existing equipment with a monolithic digital platform. Adding digital capabilities to existing equipment will get most of the benefits of a rebuild for less money, in less time, and with less need to fix the problems new platforms always have.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Put manufacturing leaders in charge.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;The best leaders for smart factory projects are experienced executives who combine manufacturing pragmatism with digital savvy. Too many balance sheets show write-offs for factory modernizations that didn&#39;t deliver the goods — sometimes literally. In this respect, many middle market companies have an advantage over larger rivals, in that their senior leaders are closer to operations both experientially and physically.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We have seen this combination of capabilities work time and again. A couple of years ago, we worked with a east coast metal products manufacturer in the US with roughly $100 million in revenue that was overwhelmed by orders when Covid disrupted its overseas competitors&#39; supply chains. With no time for a major factory overhaul — and no way of knowing how long the surge would continue — the company installed IoT counters and displays costing about $100 apiece on cutting machines, which allowed plant supervisors to monitor and assist operators in real time. At the same time, data from the counters was integrated with the ordering system, so that orders could be instantly fed into production scheduling, tracked, and matched with shipping, which significantly streamlined the order-taking and fulfilment process.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This example of a practical digital solution drove a doubling of production and revenue within one year without any capital investment or physical factory expansion. Two years later, though global supply chains were back to normal, the company&#39;s sales had grown another 15% because its increased efficiency made them better able to meet global prices and benefit from “buy American” policy changes.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When a company&#39;s smart factory approach is laid out according to business priorities and leaders look for the simplest solution, inexpensive, quick-strike tactics can improve yield and quality, boost productivity of both labor and machinery, deliver savings in energy and materials used, reduce receive-store-pick-pack-ship lead times, and more.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Moves like these are a better fit for the &lt;a href=&quot;/2021/03/bridging-the-gap-between-capital-providers-and-midsize-companies&quot;>;capital constraints&lt;/a>; midsized and smaller manufacturers face. They deliver results faster and fit with the ability of midsized companies to move quickly, unencumbered by corporate bureaucracy.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;And they provide something else. Big multinationals — with many divisions and factories in many locations — are better able to set up pilot projects, experiments, or Skunk Works. They can try, fail, learn, and adapt with less danger than a company that has just one or two plants and P&amp;amp;Ls.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A low-tech, low-cost approach to smart factories provides middle market companies with low-risk gains while at the same time providing valuable learning and experience — for executives, managers, and production workers — that can pave the way to bigger, more technologically-advanced investments later.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 14 Sep 2023 22:25:02 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[AI Adoption in U.S. Health Care Won&rsquo;t Be Easy]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/09/ai-adoption-in-u-s-health-care-wont-be-easy]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/09/Sep23_14_1473680688_488500297.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;HBR Staff/lcs813/Aleksandra Konoplia/Getty Images&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;The US health sector has struggled to put innovations into practice.

But history suggests that the US health sector struggles to put innovations like AI into practice, due in part to what economists call “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/mic.4.3.1&quot;>;switchover disruptions&lt;/a>;,” the costly phase-in period for new technologies that can upend profitable operations. To reduce switchover disruptions for AI and accelerate adoption, health care innovators must build trust in AI with three critical constituencies: providers, patients, and the public.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are three things that innovators can do to build the requisite trust:&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;1. Change the narrative about the purpose of AI.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Instead of designing the new technologies to substitute for human decision-making, innovators should aim towards new tools that complement and augment the expertise of providers. For example, AI applications have the potential to support the patient-provider relationship by relieving providers of &lt;a href=&quot;/2019/11/how-ai-in-the-exam-room-could-reduce-physician-burnout&quot;>;rote tasks&lt;/a>; — such as typing information into an electronic health record (EHR) — and enabling them to spend more of their limited time and attention on their patients and on higher-order tasks such as problem-solving and communication.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some providers are even experimenting with AI as a tool to help them communicate more &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/12/health/doctors-chatgpt-artificial-intelligence.html&quot;>;compassionately&lt;/a>; with patients. The purpose of these tools should be to enable providers to do more for more patients in more places than would be possible without them.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;2. Pay careful attention to how AI applications are implemented.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Prior to implementation, AI applications — like all new diagnostic and therapeutic innovations — should demonstrably improve outcomes and provide better experiences for patients and providers. Payers, health systems, and providers need to come to a common understanding about when it is appropriate to use an AI application, how it should be used, and how potential side effects will be identified and mitigated.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, AI-driven online &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/ai-chatbots-can-diagnose-medical-conditions-at-home-how-good-are-they/&quot;>;symptom checkers, predictive models, and diagnostic&lt;/a>; programs must be carefully curated by physicians to reduce the risks of hallucinations (invented facts) or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aax2342&quot;>;diagnostic bias based on race&lt;/a>; or other characteristics. Payers and health systems should also rely on input from clinicians to adapt AI applications to clinical and administrative workflows.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;3. Assure patients and the public that AI applications serve their needs without threatening their rights.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;To address these concerns innovators should look to emerging frameworks such as the European Commission&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40804-021-00224-0&quot;>;&lt;em>;Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI&lt;/em>;&lt;/a>; or the Biden Administration&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/ai-bill-of-rights/&quot;>;&lt;em>;Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights&lt;/em>;&lt;/a>;. These frameworks offer design principles for trustworthy AI such as: AI systems should be safe and effective. AI algorithms should be unbiased and promote equitable healthcare outcomes. Data privacy should be maintained. Patients should be informed when an automated system is being used, and they should be able to opt out of automated systems where appropriate.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The contrasting examples of two earlier transformative technologies — EHRs and minimally invasive gallbladder surgery — illustrate why it is necessary, and urgent, to reduce switchover disruptions for AI in health care.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1991, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/5306/the-computer-based-patient-record-an-essential-technology-for-health&quot;>;report&lt;/a>; by the Institute of Medicine (IOM) of the National Academy of Sciences identified EHRs (then known as computer-based patient records) as an essential technology for health care. But by 2007 only 4% of physicians and less than 2% of hospitals reported having a fully functional EHR. This was true at a time when most other sectors of the economy were rapidly digitizing and despite studies showing that EHRs were associated with lower costs and improved quality of care.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It wasn&#39;t until the Obama administration included billions of dollars of subsidies for EHRs in its &lt;a href=&quot;https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R40161/9&quot;>;stimulus program&lt;/a>; during the great recession of 2009 — nearly two decades after the IOM report — that EHRs began to take off.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In contrast, minimally invasive surgical removal of the gallbladder — a method that transformed one of the most common surgical procedures — took just &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3016026/&quot;>;a few years&lt;/a>; from its first use in the United States in 1988 to nearly complete adoption.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Switchover disruptions were high for EHRs and low for the new surgical procedure. Why?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The introduction of EHRs required large initial expenditures on software and the purchase of computers for every clinical setting. Even more costly was training employees on the new system and the drop in productivity as they climbed the learning curve. Additional cost and disruption came from the redesign of clinical and administrative workflows needed to capture information for the EHR and to put that information to meaningful use.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The switchover to EHRs also involved hidden costs stemming from challenges to existing power relationships and professional identities. Many physicians saw EHRs as evidence of their increasing subordination to the demands of administrators and payers, particularly as the portion of their time devoted to feeding information into the system increased. Apart from the system modules that expedited billing and receiving, most physicians were not clamoring for EHRs and did not see them as solving a pressing problem. Many liked and trusted their paper records, and EHRs seem to have worsened the problem of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.healthaffairs.org/content/forefront/physician-burnout-public-health-crisis-message-our-fellow-health-care-ceos&quot;>;physician burnout&lt;/a>; and early retirement.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Minimally invasive gallbladder surgery was also a big change from previous technology and required significant investment in costly new tools, training, and processes. But surgeons and hospitals were already in the business of removing gallbladders, and the changes were primarily limited to the surgical suite.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Changing to a new and better surgical technique did not challenge existing power relationships and professional identities. Many surgeons &lt;em>;wanted&lt;/em>; to learn the new methods. In addition, the idea of minimally invasive surgery was attractive to payers, patients, and the public at large, which can greatly ease the transition to a new technology.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some AI applications come with relatively low switchover disruptions. For example, AI can be used to analyze medical records to predict which patients are at elevated risk for falls in the hospital. High-risk patients can then be flagged in the EHR. Anyone encountering the patient can then take steps to reduce the risk of a fall. This application is easily incorporated into existing workflows and can even eliminate steps such as, for example, a daily huddle for care teams to evaluate fall risks.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, much of the current excitement about AI comes from large language models (LLMs), like &lt;a href=&quot;https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt&quot;>;ChatGPT&lt;/a>;, that have the potential to automate decision-making about diagnoses and treatments.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These AI applications are likely to come with large switchover disruptions, threatening to devalue the hard-won human expertise — and even eliminate the jobs — of doctors, nurses, and other providers. Fear of this kind of automation creates resistance to change. The resistance is amplified by the tendency of LLMs to “hallucinate” (ie, invent facts). Checking for hallucinations adds another complication to the already overly full workload of providers.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2023/02/22/60-of-americans-would-be-uncomfortable-with-provider-relying-on-ai-in-their-own-health-care/&quot;>;recent surveys&lt;/a>; reveal that most Americans are uncomfortable with the prospect of AI being used in their own health care. Most doubt that AI will improve health outcomes and worry that it may worsen the patient-provider relationship. These concerns of patients and the public are another potential source of resistance.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fortunately, AI is a new technology and attitudes are not yet written in stone. There is time to act. However, high switchover disruptions reduce the incentives for firms to adopt innovations, particularly in markets — like those for physician and hospital services and health insurance — that are highly concentrated and protected from external competition by regulatory and other barriers. Without action, the health sector may delay or forego valuable AI applications much as it did with EHRs.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The United States is a world leader in the development of AI. But technology isn&#39;t destiny. People choose how and when to put technology to use. It would be sadly ironic if the US health sector lagged in reaping the benefits of this transformative new technology. The key is to design and implement AI applications so that they are worthy of our trust.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 14 Sep 2023 21:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[How to Support New Workers&rsquo; Mental Health]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/09/how-to-support-new-workers-mental-health]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/09/Sep23_14_1284269493_1056349510.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;HBR Staff/artisteer/ Jose A.

Each iteration of the &amp;#8220;next-gen&amp;#8221; workforce is the complex byproduct of an evolving society and environmental factors. Once you contextualize new entrants and understand the unique forces that drive them, you can more effectively and meaningfully support their mental health at work. The authors present three actions to guide your strategy.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/how-to-support-new-workers-mental-health?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/how-to-support-new-workers-mental-health?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;For new entrants to the workforce, mental health is not only a priority — it&#39;s a necessity. &lt;a href=&quot;https://learnmore.monster.com/2023-state-of-the-graduate-report&quot;>;Ninety-two percent&lt;/a>; of new and upcoming graduates say it&#39;s important that they feel comfortable discussing mental health at work. Sixty-one percent would leave a current role for better mental health benefits, and 54% would turn down a job offer if it didn&#39;t come with work-life balance.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Navigating mental health and the benefits landscape as a new employee can be confusing, to say the least, on top of the everyday demands of the work itself. On the employer side, the marketplace for mental health support is increasingly inundated with benefits, products, perks, and offerings that can be tough to piece together, not to mention tailor to a progressively diverse workforce. The resulting ambiguity and gaps can leave new workers feeling lost, disengaged, and inclined to pursue other opportunities.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So how do we meaningfully support new workforce entrants when it comes to mental health? What actually works? In our work with diverse global employers, we&#39;ve found it&#39;s critical for leaders to create well-informed and innovative strategies tailored to new entrants&#39; values, challenges, and motivators. Here&#39;s how.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Understanding the Evolving Landscape of New Workers&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;We usually think of new entrants to the workforce as young people and recent graduates, but the cohort can also include existing workers entering new types of employment, such as frontline workers transitioning to office work, gig workers moving to salaried roles, or people moving from unpaid caregiving to formal employment. A better understanding of how these populations differ can help leaders develop more effective strategies to support them.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many new entrants share common challenges by virtue of their career stage, regardless of age. These can include needing to adjust to new organizational work cultures (eg, from school to work, or new types of employment), loss or change of social support networks (eg, when moving for a job), and pressure to succeed and accelerate career growth. Collectively, these challenges reflect an adjustment to the work structure that can be solved by providing clarity and effective onboarding, resourcing, and connection-building.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are also unique challenges tied to generational grouping. For the latest cohort of Gen Z workers, their wants and needs are influenced by broader societal shifts such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2020/05/14/on-the-cusp-of-adulthood-and-facing-an-uncertain-future-what-we-know-about-gen-z-so-far-2/&quot;>;growing diversity&lt;/a>;, higher costs of living, lower &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2022/03/23/key-facts-about-housing-affordability-in-the-us/&quot;>;housing affordability&lt;/a>;, the integration of technology in work and everyday life, and greater consciousness around social issues like gun violence, reproductive justice, climate change, LGBTQ+ rights, and more. Gen Z workers also face previously unseen workforce challenges, including the loss of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-03172-y&quot;>;social development opportunities&lt;/a>; related to the pandemic and new work norms such as hybrid working. Newer and younger workers further have greater &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mindsharepartners.org/mentalhealthatworkreport-2021&quot;>;awareness&lt;/a>;, literacy, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://health.clevelandclinic.org/generation-z-most-likely-to-have-poor-mental-health/&quot;>;comfort&lt;/a>; around mental health, as well as higher expectations of employers to support mental health at work. Together, these factors reflect the changing state of our world.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Strategies to Support New Workers&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Each iteration of the “next-gen” workforce is the complex byproduct of an evolving society and environmental factors. Once you contextualize new entrants and understand the unique forces that drive them, you can more effectively and meaningfully support their mental health.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Consider these three actions to guide your strategy:&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;1. Integrate mental health into your end-to-end new employee experience.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;New workforce entrants are navigating the landscape of work for the first time. Simultaneously, they are increasingly valuing psychological safety and proactive normalization of mental health. To meet this growing need, consider the following areas of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mindsharepartners.org/post/prioritizing-mental-health-throughout-employee-journey-mapping&quot;>;new employee experience&lt;/a>;:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Talent attraction. &lt;/strong>;Create a mental health or employee well-being statement that clearly defines what mental health means to your organization. You can also include examples of how your company supports mental health in job postings, add employee testimonials around work-life balance to your careers page, and share information about mental health benefits with job candidates.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Demonstrate a culture of safety and support for mental health for new hires&lt;/strong>;. For example, tech company Buffer shares with new employees the story of their CEO, Joel Gasciogne, who &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/mindsharepartners/2019/08/26/how-one-ceo-used-his-experience-with-burnout-to-better-support-his-employees-mental-health/?sh=1298088957a4&quot;>;took a sabbatical&lt;/a>; to recover from burnout. This helps establish the company&#39;s values around mental health and approach to sustainable work up front. Mental health can be further highlighted in employee handbooks, in-depth guides for navigating benefits, and learning opportunities (especially for managers).&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Ongoing engagement. &lt;/strong>;Build continuous connection and community around mental health. Try an onboarding buddy system to maintain consistent points of connection. Socialize and promote &lt;a href=&quot;/2020/05/how-to-form-a-mental-health-employee-resource-group&quot;>;employee resource groups&lt;/a>; (ERGs) to foster belonging and create safe spaces for discussions, learning, and innovation. Employ &lt;a href=&quot;/2019/10/why-reverse-mentoring-works-and-how-to-do-it-right&quot;>;reverse mentoring&lt;/a>; to capitalize on new workers&#39; knowledge, awareness, and comfort around mental health to benefit the broader organization.&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;h3>;2. Co-create sustainable, mentally healthy work cultures.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Studies on stress and burnout cite the impact of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mckinsey.com/mhi/our-insights/addressing-employee-burnout-are-you-solving-the-right-problem&quot;>;toxic workplace cultures&lt;/a>; and relationships on individual well-being. At the same time, a &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/01/helping-gen-z-employees-find-their-place-at-work&quot;>;growing number&lt;/a>; of new workers are actively prioritizing autonomy, &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/08/the-radical-promise-of-truly-flexible-work&quot;>;flexibility&lt;/a>;, growth, and purpose in their careers. Several strategies can help create a healthier, more inclusive, and more sustainable culture of work:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Be clear, consistent, and caring in teaching norms around work. &lt;/strong>;This includes “hard norms” like roles, timelines, and deadlines; “soft norms” around urgency, responsiveness, and how people communicate; and regular encouragement to engage in self-care and healthy work practices.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Collaborate around working needs, styles, and preferences. &lt;/strong>;Invite employees to share their individual needs around work and ideas to foster team well-being, connection, and productivity. These can be things like clear boundaries around start and end times or focus time, restricting meetings to certain hours of the day, or providing support around commutes or childcare.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Explore opportunities for learning and growth. &lt;/strong>;Consider both formal learning like trainings and informal learning like shadowing that build skills and model company values. Be transparent about expectations and pathways for career progression. Ensure performance recognition and promotion are anchored to the behaviors and values that support company and team health.&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;h3>;3. Adopt a user experience lens for mental health support.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;When it comes to formal mental health supports, learning how to navigate employer resources for the first time is no easy task. (What&#39;s a copay again?) This is especially true for new workers who may require a robust portfolio of professional and self-care resources. Extra guidance for new workers around convoluted rules related to eligibility, coverage, privacy, and confidentiality policies is critical. The following strategies can help:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Be extra communicative around the “how” of benefits. &lt;/strong>;Share information continuously using multiple channels. Hold learning sessions and Q&amp;amp;As with your benefits team and publish simple how-to guides on your intranet detailing how to navigate and weigh different benefit options. Do this during onboarding, and repeat at regular intervals including open enrollment, stressful work periods, and in response to &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/06/is-your-company-prepared-for-the-effects-of-wildfires&quot;>;local and global&lt;/a>;&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Upskill leaders and managers. &lt;/strong>;This often happens through training, but can also include newsletters, resource guides, and more. Effective approaches go beyond crisis response and emphasize creating cultures of safety and sustainable ways of working. These programs should be embedded throughout onboarding, promotion, and annual training.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Subsidize healthy lifestyles and behavior perks&lt;/strong>;. There are endless ways for individuals to engage in self-care. Subsidizing them — particularly for newer workers with lower disposable incomes — incentivizes and empowers them to pursue these positive behaviors, whether they&#39;re &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ft.com/content/d1d58aae-437c-11ea-abea-0c7a29cd66fe&quot;>;meditation apps&lt;/a>;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://healthcareexecutive.org/archives/may-june-2022/cleveland-clinics-coaching-approach-is-improving-retention&quot;>;coaching solutions&lt;/a>;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/02/14/sleep-wellness-employer-oura/&quot;>;sleep tools&lt;/a>;, gym memberships, and more.&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;. 。 .&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;More robust and inclusive mental health strategies will not only help new workforce entrants, but all employees, to drive better health, productivity, and engagement outcomes. While this requires a comprehensive approach, it can start with &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/05/leaders-sharing-your-own-mental-health-story-can-help-you-become-a-better-ally&quot;>;leader allyship&lt;/a>;, &lt;a href=&quot;/2020/08/8-ways-managers-can-support-employees-mental-health&quot;>;manager-led supports&lt;/a>;, and making real investments in an organization&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;/2019/12/burnout-is-about-your-workplace-not-your-people&quot;>;culture of work&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Inevitably, your new workers become seasoned ones. &lt;a href=&quot;/2022/04/onboarding-can-make-or-break-a-new-hires-experience&quot;>;Investing in new workers&lt;/a>; today is truly an investment in your workforce long-term.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 14 Sep 2023 20:25:02 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
