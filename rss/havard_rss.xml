&lt;p>;2019 年，Mind Share Partners 与 Qualtrics 合作开始了两年一次的工作中心理健康报告，以探索员工经验和观点不断变化的格局围绕心理健康、耻辱和工作。每份报告都收集了 1,500 名全职美国工人的全国代表性样本。每一项还包括来自历史上边缘化人群的统计显着样本：女性、有色人种、LGBTQ+ 工人等。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;今年，我们的 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mindsharepartners.org/mentalhealthatworkreport -2023&quot;>;第三项研究&lt;/a>;揭示了有关大流行之前、期间和之后工作场所心理健康如何变化的新见解。以下是我们发现的关于员工在工作中心理健康方面的愿望和需求的信息，以及雇主如何提供这些信息。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;工作场所心理健康的变化格局&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;In Mind Share Partners 的&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mindsharepartners.org/mentalhealthatworkreport-2019&quot;>;2019 年首份报告&lt;/a>;中，我们将心理健康描述为工作场所幸福感、敬业度、和生产力，以及多样性、公平和包容性。尽管心理健康挑战的比例不断增加，但大多数雇主在有效的心理健康支持方面仅仅触及表面。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在我们的&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mindsharepartners.org/mentalhealthatworkreport -2021&quot;>;2021 年报告&lt;/a>;，我们将工作场所心理健康描述为&lt;a href=&quot;/2021/10/its-a-new-era-for-mental-health-at-work&quot;>;催化时间点&lt;/a>;。在大流行期间，心理健康挑战的普遍性激增，工作本身对心理健康造成了更大的压力。与此同时，我们对心理健康的集体意识也增强了。我们更多地谈论这个问题，雇主正在投资更多的心理健康支持，例如福利、冥想应用程序和心理健康日。&lt;/p>; &lt;article-promo>; &lt;hbr-component type=&quot;promo&quot; is-insight=&quot;insight -center&quot; title=&quot;工作的未来&quot; dek=&quot;您的公司会适应还是被抛在后面？&quot; cta-text=&quot;&quot; href=&quot;/insight-center/the-future-of-work&quot;>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/insight-center/the-future-of-work&quot; style=&quot;color:black ;text-decoration:none&quot;>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; 洞察中心集合 &lt;/div>; &lt;h3>;工作的未来&lt;/h3>; &lt;div>; 您的公司会适应还是被抛在后面？ &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hbr-component>; &lt;/article-promo>; &lt;p>;2023 年，工作精神本身正在经历转变。随着世界摆脱大流行，工人们&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2022/09/13/1122059402/the-economics-behind-quiet-quitting-and-what -我们应该称之为“重新评估”什么对他们来说真正重要，从而导致更广泛的趋势，例如安静退出、“伟大的辞职”等等。与此同时，雇主投资继续发生变化。一些公司继续创新和改善工作场所体验，例如提高基本工资、试行四天工作周以及给予员工更大的工作地点和工作方式自主权。其他人则缩减了规模，希望实现“大流行前的正常状态”。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Mind Share Partners 2023 年工作心理健康报告的主要发现&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;今年的研究表明，心理健康美国的情况并没有改善，但也出现了一些新的亮点。工人们对工作中的心理健康表现出越来越高的认识，并超越传统福利和最新技术。他们越来越想要的是研究一直显示有效的东西：心理更健康的文化。我们的发现如下：&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;员工正在从危机转向萎靡不振。&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;从 2019 年到 2021 年，心理健康症状激增，员工对心理健康的总体看法下降。 2023 年，我们发现报告任何症状的人数下降了 20%，这是一个充满希望的趋势。但当被要求对过去一年的整体心理健康状况进行评分（满分 10 分）时，工人的评分持续下降。 2019 年，78% 的人给出了 7 到 10 的评分。2021 年，67% 的人给出了评分。 2023 年，61% 的评分在 7 到 10 之间，&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/hr-topics/organizational-and-employee-development/pages/financial-strain-impacts-workers -mental-health.aspx&quot;>;据报道，财务&lt;/a>;和工作本身对心理健康的负面影响最大。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;心理健康状况如何看似同时改善和恶化？心理健康包括各种各样的经历，从可诊断的状况和症状到悲伤、倦怠和压力等挑战。摆脱大流行的许多危机缓解了当时许多心理健康挑战的严重性。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但工人们进入了一个充满挑战的新世界：通货膨胀、增长&lt;a href=&quot;https:// time.com/5888024/50-trillion-venue-inequality-america/&quot;>;收入不平等&lt;/a>;和&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2023/venue- Poor-health-insurance-coverage.html&quot;>;贫困率&lt;/a>;、裁员、&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/companies-making-workers-employees-return-to-office-rto -wfh-hybrid-2023-1&quot;>;强制返回办公室&lt;/a>;，雇主加倍努力&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/31/google-ceo-to- Employees-productivity-and-focus-must-improve.html&quot;>;生产力&lt;/a>;和&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vox.com/recode/22841490/work-remote-wages-labor-force -participation-great-resignation-unions-quits&quot;>;在&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/09/03/business”浪潮中，雇主和工人之间的紧张关系日益加剧&lt;/a>; /economy/strikes-union-sag-uaw.html&quot;>;工会化&lt;/a>;。这些问题本质上是社会、政治和经济问题。虽然治疗和冥想肯定可以帮助个体工人应对，但从根本上解决这些问题需要系统干预。许多人，比如年轻人，仍在&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/07/science/pandemic-adolescents-depression-anxiety.html&quot;>;危机&lt;/a>;中挣扎。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;因此，许多人陷入了一种压倒性的感觉，嗯，“废话”，或者正如著名组织心理学家 Adam Grant 在 2021 年创造的那样，他们“&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes” .com/2021/04/19/well/mind/covid-mental-health-languishing.html&quot;>;陷入困境&lt;/a>;。”&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;投资组织文化胜过治疗和自我保健。&lt; /h3>; &lt;p>;从历史上看，雇主提供的心理健康支持主要集中在产品化、个性化的方法上——治疗、应用程序、休假。这为员工提供了在工作之外的业余时间自我管理心理健康的资源。同时，这也意味着应该私下处理此事。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;然而，在过去几年中，&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.entrepreneur.com/business- news/poor-working-conditions-can-impact-your-mental-health/450455&quot;>;围绕心理健康与工作本身之间相互依赖性的研究继续变得更加有力。 &lt;a href=&quot;/2019/12/burnout-is-about-your-workplace-not-your-people&quot;>;职业倦怠&lt;/a>;尤其是&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/ news/item/28-05-2019-职业倦怠现象-国际-分类-疾病&quot;>;世界卫生组织将其定义为&lt;/a>;，其根本原因是工作场所压力管理不善。同样，顶尖的倦怠研究专家克里斯蒂娜·马斯拉赫 (Christina Maslach) 指出了&lt;a href=&quot;/2021/02/beyond-burned-out&quot;>;导致倦怠的六大主要原因&lt;/a>;：不可持续的工作量、感知到的缺乏控制力、努力奖励不足、缺乏支持性社区、缺乏公平以及价值观和技能不匹配——所有这些都是工作场所因素。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;为了更好地了解工人的需求，我们要求今年的受访者评价以下因素对他们心理健康的帮助程度：&lt; /p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;心理健康治疗&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;心理健康的自我保健资源&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;有利于心理健康的安全和支持性文化&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;健康的文化和可持续的工作文化&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;在所有受访者中，健康和可持续的文化成为明显的赢家，78％的人认为它有中等、非常或极其有帮助。当按照性别、代际、LGBTQ+ 身份、种族和族裔、照顾者状况和资历水平对结果进行细分时，这一点仍然成立。其次是有利于心理健康的安全和支持性文化（67%），其次是心理健康治疗（64%）和自我保健资源（60%）。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;员工对心理健康的认识也不断提高。更好地了解什么样的支持才是真正有帮助的——不仅仅是应付工作。员工们将心理健康视为工作场所的集体责任，而不是个人的责任。支持工作中的心理健康越来越意味着从根本上重新调整组织文化与人类福祉。&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;心理安全感有所下降。&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;从我们 2019 年至 2021 年的研究中，员工变得更加愿意交谈了解心理健康，并对心理健康和患有心理健康问题的人形成更健康的信念。两者都表明心理健康耻辱感有所减少。随着雇主增加对心理健康资源的投资，更多的工人也表示感受到了支持。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;然而，进入 2023 年，一个悖论出现了。工人的个人信仰继续反映了对心理健康的更大认识和理解。然而，他们也觉得在工作中谈论心理健康不太安全，不太可能这样做，而且今年在心理健康方面得到雇主的支持较少——而且这些下降接近大流行前的水平。事实上，员工对向高层领导谈论心理健康的满意度几乎下降了一半，从 2021 年的 37% 降至 2023 年的 19%。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;不幸的是，这并不奇怪。尽管许多雇主在心理健康方面进行了投资，但许多雇主也“重返业务”&lt;a href=&quot;https://about.fb.com/news/2023/03/mark-zuckerberg-meta-year-of-效率/&quot;>;生产力&lt;/a>;、&lt;a href=&quot;https://fortune.com/2023/06/01/marc-benioff-salesforce-performance-culture-earnings-call/&quot;>;绩效&lt;/a>; , &lt;a href=&quot;https://tech.co/news/heres-what-google-meta-and-co-have-cut-to-save-costs&quot;>;底线成本&lt;/a>;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://fortune.com/2023/01/10/resistance-attrition-quiet-quitting-drop-diversity-forced-return-to-office-gleb-tsipursky/&quot;>;返回办公室计划&lt;/a >; 和&lt;a href=&quot;https://abcnews.go.com/US/corporate-america-slashing-dei-workers-amid-backlash-diversity/story?id=100477952&quot;>;对 DEI 的投资&lt;/a>; - 同时仍然鼓励灵活性和工作与生活的平衡，尽管工作的现实使其更加难以实现。在复杂的信号中，尽管个人层面的意识有所提高，信念更加健康，但员工在组织内的心理安全感却恶化了。&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;对 DEI 的投资正在改善心理健康和参与度。&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>; Mind Share Partners 自 2019 年以来与 Qualtrics 合作进行的所有三项研究都表明，来自边缘化身份群体的人在心理健康和工作方面面临着不成比例的挑战。今年，女性、Z 世代、黑人、拉丁裔和 LGBTQ+ 受访者的心理健康状况往往比同龄人更差；当他们谈论工作中的心理健康时，不太可能得到支持性回应；总体而言，他们对工作满意度、信任、自豪感和留在雇主的意愿的参与程度较低。这些结果代表了文化和制度的持续存在，这些文化和制度不仅导致了公然的歧视行为，而且还导致了招聘、发展和支持流程中嵌入的偏见。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;好的一面是什么？雇主的努力得到了回报，并为工人的经历带来了有意义的改变。感觉雇主支持其身份的受访者在心理健康以及工作对心理健康的影响方面表现出更好的结果，并且总体上与那些感觉不支持的受访者相比，他们对雇主更加投入和忠诚。&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;返回办公室问题的答案是自主权。&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;关于混合工作的争论持续升温&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2023/07/远程工作返回办公室政策/674736/&quot;>;有争议&lt;/a>;。在今年的研究中，我们询问参与者是否亲自工作、混合工作或完全远程工作。此外，我们还询问他们这样做是出于选择还是雇主强制要求的。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在比较不同工作情况的关键结果时，没有出现一致的主题。然而，可以自由决定工作地点的混合型员工的心理健康症状持续时间较短，工作对心理健康的积极影响更大，在工作中谈论心理健康更舒适，因心理健康原因离职的可能性更低，以及更大的自豪感和在当前雇主工作两年或更长时间的意愿。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;没有、也永远不会有一种明确“更好”或“更差”的单一、普遍的工作方式” 比另一个。 （还记得&lt;a href=&quot;/2019/11/the-truth-about-open-offices&quot;>;开放式办公室&lt;/a>;吗？）好处总是会因公司、职能、行业、地区、文化而异，&lt; a href=&quot;https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/worklab/in-the-office-it-is-all-about-moments-that-matter&quot;>;员工生命周期的阶段&lt;/a >;、团队成员个人的需求和偏好等等。然而，对工作地点的关注分散了工作的许多其他方面，例如我们的工作时间或沟通方式。更重要的是，它掩盖了一个更基本的问题：个人的能力选择&lt;/a>;适合他们的方式。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;雇主可以做什么&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;自 2017 年成立以来，Mind Share Partners 一直与跨行业、跨规模和跨地区的全球组织合作。随着我们继续加强雇主内部的培训、战略咨询和实施工作以及更广泛的运动建设和宣传举措，我们根据今年的调查结果为组织提供了五项关键战略：&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;共同重新设想一个心理健康的工作场所。&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;对于心理健康的工作场所，永远不会有一个一刀切的愿景。要实现这一目标，需要根据组织的规模、阶段、行业、地区、个人角色等，集体重新设想工作场所心理健康对组织中的每个人（领导者和员工）意味着什么。首先要了解您的组织、组织内部的心理健康状况，以及最终您的员工的需求。这意味着&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mindsharepartners.org/post/5-workplace-mental-health-questions-to-include-in-employee-pulse-and-employee-engagement-surveys&quot;>;测量&lt; /a>; 心理健康和工作场所因素，定期询问员工的观点，并根据员工的需求制定真正、有意义的变革。将这些努力进一步融入组织的文化、系统、&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mindsharepartners.org/post/prioritizing-mental-health-throughout-employee-journey-mapping&quot;>;员工生命周期&lt;/a>; ，而业务战略确保将福祉融入企业本身，而不是简单地归入人力资源&lt;a href=&quot;/2019/08/what-wellness-programs-dont-do-for-workers&quot;>;福祉计划&lt; /a>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;实现自上而下和自下而上的文化变革。&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;今年的研究表明，员工希望有更安全、更有利于心理健康的支持性文化，以及更健康、更可持续的工作文化一般来说。不可避免地，这种文化变革需要自上而下和自下而上的方法。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;从上层开始，领导者可以告诉自己&lt;a href=&quot;/2023/05/leaders-sharing-your- own-mental-health-story-can-help-you-become-a-better-ally&quot;>;组织内的心理健康故事&lt;/a>;，或者像 Mind Share Partners 那样向外公开分享&lt;a href=&quot; https://www.mindsharepartners.org/leadersgofirst&quot;>;领导者先行&lt;/a>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mindsharepartners.org/leadersgofirst&quot;>;活动&lt;/a>;。这可以使心理健康正常化，并帮助其他人在工作中轻松地谈论它（如果他们愿意的话）。他们还可以塑造健康的工作实践，特别是作为领导者、资源团队和个人，以保持健康和可持续的工作方式。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;自下而上，雇主和个体工人都可以探索对话论坛，例如&lt;a href=&quot;/2020/05/how-to-form-a-mental-health-employee-resource-group&quot;>;员工资源组&lt;/a>;、&lt;a href=&quot;https://www. mindsharepartners.org/peerlisteningprograms&quot;>;同伴倾听计划&lt;/a>;、跨职能心理健康工作组或&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mindsharepartners.org/casestudy-pgim&quot;>;心理健康冠军网络&lt; /a>;.这些对话可以是关于心理健康的，但也可以在团队内部进行，以建立工作规范，探索&lt;a href=&quot;/2023/08/the-radical-promise-of-truly-flexible-work&quot;>;包容性灵活性&lt; /a>;，并授权个人决定如何最好地工作。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;自然而然的一步是让您的员工能够领导这一变革。这通常是通过跨级别的培训来实现的，从管理和公平的角度采取积极主动的预防性方法，而不仅仅是“注意到警告信号”。工人和领导者都需要制定策略来创造心理安全和可持续的工作文化。提升员工技能还可以包括&lt;a href=&quot;/2020/08/8-ways-managers-can-support-employees-mental-health&quot;>;经理计划&lt;/a>;、领导力辅导、指导等。&lt;/ p>; &lt;h3>;探索根本原因解决方案以及健康福利。&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;在管理任何策略或预算时，很容易陷入投资“快速修复”计划和产品的陷阱，而没有批判性地评估其目的。例如，&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/mindsharepartners/2019/10/10/the-futility-of-mental-health-days/&quot;>;心理健康日&lt;/a>;声称休息和恢复活力的好处，并且经常伴随着乐观的意识口号，例如“不好也没关系！”这可以实现值得称赞的意图：休息、提高认识并引发更广泛的对话。但之后会发生什么呢？嗯，在很多情况下，它又回到了同样的流失和烧毁状态。更糟糕的是，它使雇主能够在个人韧性的幌子下继续“不好”（即不可持续）的商业行为。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;领导者需要提供应对和解决问题的方法。根本原因。该领域的参与者数量不断增加 - &lt;a href=&quot;https://time.com/6308096/therapy-mental-health-worse-us/&quot;>;医疗保健提供者&lt;/a>;，&lt;a href =&quot;/2019/08/what-wellness-programs-dont-do-for-workers&quot;>;健康计划&lt;/a>;，&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/the-unbearable- Irony-of-meditation-apps/&quot;>;冥想应用程序&lt;/a>;——每个应用程序都有自己的理念、方法、产品和业务目标。所有这些方法都有其独特的好处，这些好处通常在科学文献中都有体现，但是当员工要求建立健康且可持续的工作文化时，这些方法&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eidCHlP8_bQ&quot;>;可能会没有解决正确的问题&lt;/a>;。&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;重新致力于工作本身的基础。&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;虽然每个组织都不同，但仍然有每个工作场所必须有意义地解决的核心基础培养心理健康的劳动力：&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;安全：&lt;/strong>;这包括身心安全、财务稳定以及长期的平衡和可持续性。&lt;/li >; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;自主性：&lt;/strong>;这包括完成工作所需的时间、带宽和资源；对工作的控制力、灵活性和可预测性；并拥有发言权。&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;归属感：&lt;/strong>;这包括能够真实地工作、建立有意义的联系并获得支持，并感受到与他人的整体社区意识。&lt; /li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;不幸的是，这些是人类的核心需求，但由于雇主在不解决基本问题的情况下追求健康福利，这些需求往往被忽视。如需更深入地了解，请探索美国卫生局局长&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hhs.gov/surgeongeneral/priorities/workplace-well-being/index.html&quot;>;最近推出的工作场所心理框架&lt;/a>;健康和福祉，Mind Share Partners 合作。&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;坚持 DEI。&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;雇主在解决世界不平等问题上的地位一直受到激烈争论。至少。但让我们更简单地看看他们控制范围内的东西：工作场所。组织不仅有避免不平等现象长期存在的道德责任，而且有机会帮助员工从人类多样性、友情和共同目标中蓬勃发展。今年的数据显示，当社会身份得到支持时，员工的心理健康和参与度会更好。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;心理健康和 DEI &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mindsharepartners.org/diversityinclusion&quot;>;本质上是联系在一起的。历史上被边缘化的群体在工作和寻求帮助时都面临着更多的文化和结构障碍心理健康支持。鉴于应对心理健康挑战的人们普遍存在&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.psychiatry.org/ Patients-families/stigma-and-discrimination&quot;>;耻辱和边缘化&lt;/a>;，心理健康也是 DEI 中的一个类别或有条件地生活。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;最终，DEI 是为了让工作为每个人服务。当然，就像任何有远见的目标一样，这需要人力、预算、战略规划和跨职能投资。不幸的是，一些雇主&lt;a href=&quot;https://qz.com/it-shouldn-t-be-this-easy-for-companies-to-walk-back-th-1850686363&quot;>;回避&lt;/a >; 来自 DEI 的平权行动&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/30/business/economy/hiring-affirmative-action.html&quot;>;回滚&lt;/a>;。其他人则保持坚定和承诺，部分是出于商业需要。 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mindsharepartners.org/post/mind-share-partners-to-corporate-america-stay-the-course-on-dei&quot;>;我们的消息&lt;/a>;？坚持到底。&lt;/​​p>; &lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;。 。 .&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;通常需要几十年的社会运动，工作场所心理健康运动只需几年就能实现。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当我们展望未来时，工作场所心理健康运动将最终需要“回到基础”。工人们不再希望琐碎的福利分散他们的工作注意力。他们希望有稳定的就业来减轻财务焦虑，希望得到认可以知道自己很重要，希望有可持续的工作量来防止倦怠，希望有一个支持性的社区来找到归属感，希望能够灵活地决定工作如何适合他们，希望有自主权和发言权来感受到尊重、代理和支持。对工作和生活的所有权。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;工作中心理健康的未来不会是新兴的技术复兴或混合工作的转变。未来将是对人类核心需求的重新承诺。这将是安全、社区和健康的组织文化。这将是植根于公平和工人声音的可持续工作。工作场所心理健康的未来将从工作本身开始。&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- 引用 -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt; br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot;

&lt;/div>; &lt;p>;美国多个州最近的透明度政策，例如阻止雇主要求的薪资历史禁令候选人报告自己的薪酬甚至薪资期望，更加关注工作场所的公平薪资实践。因此，对确定适当薪酬的策略的需求不断增加。一个关键的解决方案在于薪资基准：使用汇总的市场数据来建立有竞争力的薪资水平。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;设定薪资是一种平衡行为：你不想提供相对于市场而言过高的薪资，因为那样会影响你的薪资水平。会很浪费；但提供低于市场水平的薪资可能会导致难以吸引、留住和激励员工。雇主如何找到他们的最佳位置？&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nber.org/papers/w30570&quot;>;最近的研究&lt;/a>;中，我们开发了一个理论模型阐明了薪资基准的需求。在我们的模型中，公司确切地知道求职者会带来多少价值。该公司希望向候选人提供低于该价值的报价，以保留部分价值作为利润。但是，报价应该低多少呢？报价越低，节省的费用就越高。另一方面，如果报价太低，公司可能会面临将求职者流失到另一家公司的风险 - 他们可能会拒绝报价，或者接受报价并很快离开。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;因此，无论是公司想要提供或多或少激进的报价，很大程度上取决于公司认为求职者的市场价值：即，其他公司愿意为该求职者支付多少费用。这就是薪资基准的用武之地：公司可以使用类似员工（例如，具有相同职位头衔和行业）接受的报价数据来确保他们的报价相对于市场基准不会太低或太高。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我们的研究还提供了经验证据，表明获得薪资基准对公司设定的薪资有重大影响。我们与美国最大的薪资处理公司 ADP 合作开展这项工作，为 650,000 家公司提供服务，并为 2000 万美国人处理薪资。除了薪资服务外，公司还以薪资基准的形式汇总薪资记录中的薪资数据。然后，客户可以以用户友好的方式&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.adp.com/what-we-offer/products/adp-datacloud.aspx&quot;>;搜索&lt;/a>;他们想要的任何职位。它是最先进的基准工具之一，被许多知名公司所使用。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我们的数据涵盖了该工具从 2015 年底首次引入市场时一直到 2015 年年初的整个过程。我们的样本包括 584 家获得该工具使用权的“治疗”公司和 1,431 家未获得该工具但因与治疗公司具有相似特征而被选中的“控制”公司。我们研究了处理公司在使用基准测试工具之前和之后不久的薪资变化，并将其与对照公司相应的薪资变化进行了比较。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这是我们的发现：让我们可以说，当一家公司选择的薪资处于同一职位、行业和州的中位数薪资的狭窄范围（5%）内时，他们就设定了“正确”的薪资。在使用基准测试工具之前，公司设定“正确”薪资的可能性为 11.6%。使用基准测试工具后，设定“正确”薪资的可能性增加了两倍，达到 22.1%。这是令人信服的证据，表明这些薪资基准真正影响了薪资设定，并导致各公司的职位级别薪资趋同。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我们还发现，薪资基准的影响相当对称。在查看基准之后，企业不太可能支付远高于市场的价格，大概是因为这会造成浪费； but firms are also less likely to pay significantly below-market, presumably because it would be costly in terms of attracting, retaining and motivating employees.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For standardized positions, such as bank teller and receptionist, we found some evidence of a modest increase in the average salary. If employers are choosing to raise salaries for this group, it must be because they expect to get something in return, right? For instance, bumping salaries up to market may allow employers to retain their employees and save those pesky turnover costs. Our research shows that, indeed, benchmarking improves retention. Among employees in these roles, the gain of about 6% in average salary was followed by an increase of about 16% in the retention rate over the following 12 months.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;How can I use salary benchmarking?&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;The payroll data show that high quality salary benchmarks sway employers to set pay closer to the marketplace median pay, and that benchmark users benefit from a boost in employee retention. But how exactly does one go about sourcing and using a salary benchmark?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Salary benchmarks are wide ranging; some are created by the government and others exclusive to the clients of consulting firms. Still others are crowdsourced data from anonymous employees. For example, the US government reports average earnings at the six-digit occupation code, within industry and state, each year using surveys of businesses and households. These data are highly representative, but are released infrequently and at a higher level of aggregation than the sought after position level information. Meanwhile, several large consulting firms offer exclusive access to the aggregated earnings of their clients, often using proprietary standardized corporate titles. Most recently, firms that collect salary information as part of their core businesses, like ADP, have added user interfaces that make these data accessible as benchmarks. And platforms like Glassdoor have encouraged millions of users to volunteer their salary information anonymously in exchange for seeing the average inputs of others at the position level.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To better understand how firms use salary benchmarking, we also conducted a survey with the members of the Society for Human Resource Management Research Institute (SHRM). We collected responses from a large sample of 2,085 HR managers in charge of pay-setting. This sample spans organizations of every size, state and industry, including both public and private sectors. To complement this data, we conducted an additional survey with a sample of clients from ADP, in which we obtained responses from 720 HR managers in charge of pay-setting.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Employers use salary benchmarking for a wide range of purposes. For instance, 54% of respondents use benchmarking when setting the pay of new hires. Other popular uses include salary negotiations (53%), setting ranges for specific job titles (90%), and setting the salary for a job advertisement (41%). Employers also vary in terms of how frequently they consult salary benchmarks. For instance, while some employers do benchmarking for every single new hire (37% of respondents), the rest prefer to do it for some specific new hires or for some specific positions.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Our survey data indicates that employers differ in which data sources they use. The most popular option is to use industry surveys, chosen by 68% of respondents, but hiring a consulting firm to conduct these surveys can be quite expensive, and there is no guarantee that the survey data will live up to the expectations. If you do not have a big budget, you may also want to try the second most popular option: free online data sources (58% of respondents) such as Glassdoor.com. More recently, payroll service companies have gained popularity (used by 23% of respondents and the fastest growing source), which may give the best bang for your buck in terms of data quality. Most employers, however, use a combination of data sources. While the majority look at free online sources, on a scale of 1-5, HR professionals report that other sources are twice as trustworthy as free online sources.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Labor market trends can sometimes change rapidly, especially in the post-pandemic world. You do not need to check the benchmarks on a daily basis, but try to at least do it from time to time — remember that information, too, has an expiration date. Likewise, you may not have time to sit down to study market trends for every position in which you hire. However, make sure to at least do due diligence for the positions that are most critical for your business.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When using a benchmarking tool, you may feel information overload. Some tools provide not only the median pay, but also the mean, 10th percentile, 25th percentile, and so on and so forth. And some tools allow you to filter by industry, state, and other criteria. There are trade-offs. For instance, filters can allow you to focus on peer employers, but at the cost of smaller sample sizes and thus statistically imprecise benchmarks. While the right approach depends on the context at hand, according to our survey, there are some clear favorites: most firms (89%) prefer to look at the median market pay or the average market pay, and the most popular filters are by industry (87%) and state (84%).&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We also gave the survey respondents an opportunity to share their own tips and advice for salary benchmarking. Some recommended not relying on job title information alone, but rather to pay attention to the job description to ensure it&#39;s a good match. Another manager suggested that, to the extent possible, you should review the benchmarks regularly to stay in sync with the latest trends in the job market. In the same spirit, one manager recommends being proactive — do not wait until employees are unhappy about low pay and reach out to you, or you risk higher turnover.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In sum, the pay transparency revolution extends to firms knowing much more about what their competitors are offering. New high-quality sources have changed pay-setting practices. According to our latest study, keeping up with pay in the marketplace, and knowing how to use those sources, can affect your bottom-line retention and payroll costs. And from a societal perspective, this is closing the gap between pay across firms.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 10 Oct 2023 22:25:01 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[10 Reasons Why Inclusion Is a Competitive Advantage]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/10/10-reasons-why-inclusion-is-a-competitive-advantage]]><description>&lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/10/Oct23_10_457893079.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;Michael H/Getty Images&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;In their new book, &lt;em>;Move Fast and Fix Things&lt;/em>;, Frances Frei and Anne Morriss outline five strategies to help leaders tackle their hardest problems and quickly make change.

Today&#39;s excerpt is about inclusion, which Frei and Morriss define as the act of creating conditions that allow other people to thrive — not in spite of their differences as complex, multidimensional humans, but precisely because of those differences.&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;. 。 .&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Although it can be hard to measure a complex outcome like inclusion, researchers are getting better at it. Serious people are working to identify and quantify the many effects of inclusion on firm performance, and the insights they&#39;re generating are persuasive. Below is a list of some of our favorite findings, many of which remain generally underappreciated.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;1. Inclusion helps you recruit good people. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Inclusion is now a tell for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.glassdoor.com/employers/blog/diversity/&quot;>;all kinds of talented people&lt;/a>; — not only the underrepresented — that you&#39;ve built a healthy workplace and understand what it takes to collectively excel. Expect candidates to look for evidence of inclusiveness in everything from where you recruit to the fine print of your benefits package. For example, they may not need those same-sex fertility benefits or veteran mentorship services, but they&#39;ll still see them as a sign that you appreciate difference.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;2. Inclusion helps you retain good people.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;It turns out that those same candidates &lt;a href=&quot;/2018/12/to-retain-employees-focus-on-inclusion-not-just-diversity&quot;>;will stick around as employees&lt;/a>; if you truly walk the talk on inclusion. Inclusion drives &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jstor.org/stable/25067557&quot;>;higher rates of retention&lt;/a>; at all levels of the organization, and some employee segments (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.shrm.org/foundation/ourwork/initiatives/engaging-and-integrating-military-veterans/Documents/13056-G-01_SHRMF_WhyHireVet.pdf&quot;>;military veterans top the list&lt;/a>;) will reward your ability to value their unique contribution with industry-leading loyalty.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;3. Inclusion increases the engagement of your people. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Engagement scores are consistently higher for companies labeled “inclusive,” and we now have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/joshbersin/2015/12/06/why-diversity-and-inclusion-will-be-a-top-priority-for-2016/?sh=fc0a6632ed5b&quot;>;some interesting data&lt;/a>; that helps to explain these numbers. Inclusive companies are &lt;em>;also &lt;/em>;almost three times better at coaching people for improved performance and four times better at identifying and building leaders. Making people better is the key to their engagement, and inclusion seems to give you an advantage.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;4. &lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Inclusion makes you more resilient.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;When different types of people are thriving in your organization, &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/11/why-diverse-teams-are-smarter&quot;>;you&#39;re better at navigating crises&lt;/a>; and (our favorite business euphemism) “turbulent times” in general. You&#39;re more adaptable, more comfortable with change, and better at dealing with personnel problems. One fun fact: while the S&amp;amp;P saw a 35% decline in stock performance between 2007 and 2009 (remember that ride?), the shares of inclusive companies went in the other direction, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/mursalhedayat/2020/06/24/diversity-in-the-workplace-is-now-more-critical-than-ever/?sh=5172eb6e60aa&quot;>;gaining over 14% in value&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;5. &lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Inclusion grows your marketplace.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Inclusive teams are &lt;a href=&quot;/2013/12/how-diversity-can-drive-innovation&quot;>;better at identifying and cultivating new markets&lt;/a>; because they expand a firm&#39;s peripheral vision and help eliminate its blind spots. &lt;a href=&quot;/2004/09/diversity-as-strategy&quot;>;More women in decision-making roles&lt;/a>;, for example, improves a company&#39;s ability to solve problems for female clients. And this is before we even get to the macro implications of &lt;em>;economic &lt;/em>;inclusion. For example, the US GDP could get &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.accenture.com/_acnmedia/pdf-89/accenture-disability-inclusion-research-report.pdf&quot;>;a boost of up to $25 billion&lt;/a>; if just 1% more of persons with disabilities joined the labor force. What percentage of that boost would represent new customers for your business?&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;6. &lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Inclusion makes you more innovative.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Inclusion creates a healthier meritocracy for new ideas &lt;a href=&quot;/2021/04/research-adding-women-to-the-c-suite-changes-how-companies-think&quot;>;where out-of-the-box thinking is more likely to break through&lt;/a>;. This happens in part because people in inclusive organizations are more likely to surface and hear the &lt;em>;what &lt;/em>;of a good idea rather than allow that idea to be diluted or buried by an unexpected &lt;em>;who&lt;/em>;. How much of an innovation bump does true inclusion buy you? Depending on your starting place, estimates range from &lt;a href=&quot;/2018/01/how-and-where-diversity-drives-financial-performance&quot;>;roughly 20%&lt;/a>; all the way &lt;a href=&quot;/2013/12/how-diversity-can-drive-innovation&quot;>;up to 70%&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;7. Inclusion turns you into better decision-makers. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Decision quality goes up when a range of voices are &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/11/why-diverse-teams-are-smarter&quot;>;not only present but also integrated&lt;/a>;. In &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/eriklarson/2017/09/21/new-research-diversity-inclusion-better-decision-making-at-work/?sh=627907124cbf&quot;>;one delightful study&lt;/a>;, all-male teams beat individuals nearly 60% of the time, but gender-diverse teams outperformed individuals almost 75% of the time. Teams that were gender diverse, geographically diverse, and had at least one age gap of more than 20 years made better decisions than that lone individual &lt;em>;87% of the time&lt;/em>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;8. Inclusion helps you manage risk.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;In the wreckage of the 2008 financial crisis, a serious “Lehman Sisters” argument emerged positing that the story would have played out differently if more women had been in the room for the most consequential decisions. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0148296315002143&quot;>;Subsequent&lt;/a>; &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.aom.org/doi/abs/10.5465/amj.2018.1039?journalCode=amj&quot;>;studies&lt;/a>; have since explored this argument, concluding that gender inclusion in the C-suite and boardroom is associated with a healthier firm relationship to risk—neither overly risk-averse nor risk-seeking—and better overall performance.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;9. Inclusion improves your stock price. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Estimated bumps to shareholder returns range &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.catalyst.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/The_Bottom_Line_Connecting_Corporate_Performance_and_Gender_Diversity.pdf&quot;>;from 10% to over 30%&lt;/a>; (seriously) when you get inclusion right. This may be why Goldman Sachs &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/article/bc-finreg-unlocking-diversity-inclusion/unlocking-diversitys-promise-psychological-safety-trust-and-inclusion-idUSKBN2C01N2&quot;>;recently announced&lt;/a>; that it would no longer take any company public where the board is made up exclusively of straight, white men. Whatever your organization&#39;s own return on inclusion may end up being, the question we often ask companies is, “What else are you doing to chase those kinds of returns?”&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;10. Inclusion makes you more money. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;For all the reasons we&#39;ve covered in entries one through nine, inclusion ends up &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/diversity-and-inclusion/diversity-wins-how-inclusion-matters&quot;>;boosting both your top line and bottom line&lt;/a>;. Your talented, engaged teams will drive higher revenues through better innovation and smarter market development, while allowing you to spend capital more efficiently through better decision-making, higher retention, and higher productivity. And when you hit some turbulence along the way, you&#39;re more likely to land the plane safely. We hope to live in a world where inclusion is an organizational given. Until we get there, we know of no other distinction that can deliver these kinds of advantages.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;em>;This excerpt has been lightly edited.&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 10 Oct 2023 21:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[It&rsquo;s Time to End the Battle Between Waterfall and Agile]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/10/its-time-to-end-the-battle-between-waterfall-and-agile]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/10/Oct23_10_501194249.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;MirageC/Getty Images&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;Too many project leaders think rigidly about Waterfall and Agile project management methodologies and believe that they need to choose between the two. But many projects &amp;#8212; especially those with diverse stakeholder needs and complex structures &amp;#8212; benefit from a hybrid approach that combines aspects of Waterfall and Agile. The rise of hybrid methods isn&amp;#8217;t tied to a particular time or event; instead, they have evolved organically as a response to the needs of modern, complex projects. A review of the key components of Waterfall and Agile allows project leaders to select among them to build a hybrid approach based on the unique demands of each project.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/10/its-time-to-end-the-battle-between-waterfall-and-agile?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/10/its-time-to-end-the-battle-between-waterfall-and-agile?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;When you are leading a high-stakes project, choosing between the rigor of Waterfall and the flexibility of Agile can make or break your initiative. For the last two decades, too many academics, leaders, project managers, and organizations have thought they have to choose one or the other. Worse, the emergence of Agile methods led to tribalism in the project community, stifling innovation and limiting the potential for truly effective solutions.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Bring a bunch of project managers together and inevitably they&#39;ll share their thoughts about their least-preferred methodologies. I&#39;ve heard it all: “Waterfall is a process designed for a world that no longer exists.” “Agile is a way of delivering failure faster.” “Waterfall is a dinosaur.” “Agile makes eagles team up with turkeys.” Entire organizations choose to “go agile,” setting aside the fundamentals of traditional methodologies that some projects need. This rigid and divisive thinking leads to real losses.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The key to navigating this landscape lies in &lt;em>;hybrid project management methodologies&lt;/em>; that combine the planning rigor of Waterfall with the flexibility of Agile. Indeed, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pmi.org/learning/library/forging-future-focused-culture-11908#:~:text=The%20survey%20results%20for%20this,of%20their%20projects%20failing%20outright.&quot;>;Project Management Institute&#39;s 2020 report&lt;/a>; indicated that 11.4% of investment is wasted due to poor project performance. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.standishgroup.com/news/45&quot;>;Standish Group&#39;s CHAOS report&lt;/a>; showed only a 31% project success rate, with 19% of projects failing outright. This indicates an estimated annual global financial loss of an astounding $3 trillion, not to mention wasted resources, missed opportunities, and negative societal impacts.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Embracing hybrid methods can help organizations begin to remedy some of these outcomes. In this article we look at how, with this blended approach, organizations can achieve an optimal balance, allowing them to nimbly adapt to unforeseen challenges without losing sight of their ultimate objectives. First, let&#39;s briefly review the core components of Waterfall and Agile, which both contain the building blocks of hybrid methodologies.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Waterfall: The Structured Approach&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;The traditional Waterfall methodology is structured and sequential, where progress “flows” downward through distinct phases: conception, analysis, design, planning, construction, testing, implementation, handover, and maintenance.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Key characteristics of the Waterfall method are highlighted through various examples:&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Sequential phases&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://learninglegacy.crossrail.co.uk/learning-legacy-themes/project-and-programme-management/initiation-and-development/&quot;>;London&#39;s Crossrail project&lt;/a>;, a significant infrastructural undertaking budgeted at £14.8 billion, illustrates the effectiveness of the Waterfall model&#39;s distinct and sequential phases. Each phase had to be meticulously completed before the subsequent one began, ensuring a structured progression that left no room for oversights. Despite the challenges involved, the Crossrail project, upon its completion, was hailed as an engineering marvel, connecting 41 stations over 118 km and forecasted to serve about 200 million people annually.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Detailed documentation&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://everything-everywhere.com/the-large-hadron-collider/&quot;>;Large Hadron Collider&lt;/a>; (LHC) project by CERN, with an estimated cost of €7.5 billion, showcases the importance of the Waterfall model&#39;s emphasis on thorough documentation. Given the LHC&#39;s complexity, including a 17-mile-long circular tunnel and thousands of custom parts, detailed documentation was essential to ensuring everyone involved in the project comprehensively understood each phase.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Predictability&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.arabianbusiness.com/industries/real-estate/burj-dubai-cost-1-5bn-build-27430&quot;>;Burj Khalifa project&lt;/a>; in Dubai, valued at $1.5 billion, stands as a testament to the predictability in cost and timeline offered by the Waterfall method. The meticulous upfront planning facilitated the construction of the world&#39;s tallest building (828 meters), completed within six years as per the original timeline, despite the project&#39;s immense scale and complexity.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, numerous high-profile project failures have exposed the limitations of the Waterfall approach:&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Rigidity&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.audit.vic.gov.au/report/operational-effectiveness-myki-ticketing-system?section=&quot;>;Myki ticketing system&lt;/a>; project in Melbourne, Australia, starkly underscores the Waterfall method&#39;s rigidity. With a budget exceeding AUD 1.5 billion, the project took four times more than the expected two years. Yet, the system was riddled with issues due to its inability to adapt to evolving user requirements and technological advancements.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Late discovery of issues&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;The US government&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessofgovernment.org/sites/default/files/Viewpoints%20Dr%20Gwanhoo%20Lee.pdf&quot;>;HealthCare.gov project&lt;/a>;, which cost over $2 billion, illustrates the repercussions of late-stage testing, a characteristic of the Waterfall model. System defects identified during the late testing phase resulted in a flawed launch and considerable public and political uproar, leading to expensive and time-consuming repairs and improvements.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Incompatibility with change&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-08-31/nbn-cost-revised-up-to-51-billion-dollars/10187108&quot;>;National Broadband Network&lt;/a>; (NBN) project in Australia, an AUD 51 billion endeavor, experienced frequent shifts in strategy and technology, resulting in delays and budget overruns. This highlighted the Waterfall method&#39;s inadequacy in managing projects where requirements are dynamic and continually evolving.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Unsuitability for undefined projects&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;In 2015, Cerner, a health care technology company that provides electronic health records software, began a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.va.gov/oig/pubs/VAOIG-19-08980-95.pdf&quot;>;project&lt;/a>; to develop a new system for the US Department of Veterans Affairs. The project, which was using the Waterfall model and was estimated to cost $16 billion and take 10 years to complete, quickly ran into problems. The VA&#39;s requirements for the new EHR system were not well defined in advance, and the Waterfall model made it difficult for Cerner to change course. By 2018, the project&#39;s cost had &lt;a href=&quot;https://federalnewsnetwork.com/veterans-affairs/2022/07/house-lawmakers-pan-va-ehr-as-bad-investment-with-upcoming-39b-cost-estimate/&quot;>;increased to over $20 billion&lt;/a>; and was still years behind schedule forcing the VA to terminate the project. The Cerner VA EHR project is considered to be one of the most expensive and disastrous IT projects in US government history.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The digital era, characterized by rapid changes and unpredictable environments, has tested the Waterfall method&#39;s limits, recognizing a need for more adaptable project management methodologies.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Agile: The Adaptive Approach&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Agile methods focus on enabling teams to deliver work in small increments, thus delivering value to their customers faster. Because the team continuously evaluates project requirements, plans, and results, it can make changes rapidly.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Key characteristics of Agile, exemplified in various projects, include:&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Iterative development&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;The development of Google&#39;s search engine is a fitting example of iterative development. It started as a research project in 1996 and evolved into the most widely used search engine today, servicing over &lt;a href=&quot;https://fitsmallbusiness.com/google-search-statistics/&quot;>;8.5 billion&lt;/a>; daily searches. The continuous enhancements, adjustments, and improvements made over the years underline the concept of iterative development intrinsic to Agile.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Customer collaboration&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Amazon, a pioneer in customer centricity, epitomizes the Agile principle of customer collaboration. Its constant solicitation and incorporation of customer feedback into its products and services have propelled it to its&amp;nbsp;stratospheric market value.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Response to change&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Spotify, the world-leader in streaming music, is a classic case of Agile&#39;s adaptability. It has consistently evolved its business model and product offerings in response to market changes and user demands, moving from a simple music streaming platform to offering podcasts, videos, and personalized playlists.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the Agile methodology has its share of limitations:&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Inadequate documentation&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;The Agile method&#39;s focus on rapid delivery often leads to insufficient documentation. In 2015, the German supermarket chain Lidl launched a project to implement a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.henricodolfing.com/2020/05/case-study-lidl-sap-debacle.html&quot;>;new SAP system&lt;/a>;. The project failed to accurately map out Lidl&#39;s unique business processes onto the new system. The lack of sufficient documentation led to misunderstandings between the development team and the stakeholders, causing discrepancies in the system&#39;s design and functionality and leading to the project&#39;s cancellation in 2018, incurring a loss of around €500 million.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Unpredictable delivery time and costs&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;The UK&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.computerweekly.com/news/2240185166/Universal-Credit-will-cost-taxpayers-128bn&quot;>;Universal Credit welfare reform project&lt;/a>;, budgeted initially at £2.2 billion, illustrates Agile&#39;s difficulty in estimating delivery times and costs. The project&#39;s costs escalated to over £12 billion, and it&#39;s still not fully implemented nearly a decade later due to its complex nature and continuous changes in requirements.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Dependence on client involvement&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Projects where the client cannot commit significant time or does not provide timely feedback can face significant hurdles. A notable example is the $60 million &lt;a href=&quot;https://federalnewsnetwork.com/tom-temin-commentary/2018/02/the-coast-guards-epic-fail/&quot;>;US Coast Guard payroll system project&lt;/a>;, which was terminated in 2017, partly due to insufficient stakeholder engagement.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Inadequacy for certain types of projects&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Agile&#39;s flexibility and adaptability do not translate well to projects with fixed requirements or requiring high predictability. For instance, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://interestingengineering.com/innovation/engineering-nycs-iconic-structure-one-world-trade-center&quot;>;One World Trade Center construction&lt;/a>;, a project with a budget of approximately $3.9 billion, required strict regulatory compliance and precise planning, which wouldn&#39;t have been feasible with Agile.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As Agile continues to evolve, these limitations underline the need for project management methodologies that can blend the strengths of both Waterfall and Agile, effectively mitigating the weaknesses inherent in each. Thus, the case for a hybrid approach becomes increasingly compelling.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Embracing the Hybrid Approach&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;The emergence of hybrid methodologies represents a new era in project management that draws on the strengths of both Agile and Waterfall while mitigating their limitations. The rise of hybrid methods isn&#39;t tied to a particular time or event; instead, they have evolved organically as a response to the needs of modern, complex projects.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Key characteristics of Hybrid Project Management and their real-world implications include:&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Flexibility and structure&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Hybrid methodologies, such as the one implemented by Philips for their digital transformation initiatives, offer a mix of Agile&#39;s flexibility and Waterfall&#39;s structure. Philips adopted a hybrid approach for its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usa.philips.com/healthcare/innovation/about-health-suite&quot;>;HealthSuite digital platform&lt;/a>;, delivering rapid, iterative releases for software development while still adhering to strict documentation and safety guidelines. By combining these two approaches, Philips was able to create a hybrid approach that was both flexible and structured. This &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.philips.com/c-dam/b2bhc/master/hts/healthsuite/brochure-philips-ealthsuite.pdf&quot;>;resulted&lt;/a>; in better product quality, reduced time to market, predictable costs and savings.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Phased and iterative&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Hybrid methods&amp;nbsp;employ a phased approach for well-defined components and an iterative approach for uncertain ones. On its way to becoming the world&#39;s best digital bank, DBS Bank executed well-planned phases for infrastructure overhaul while implementing iterative development for its customer-facing digital services. This approach enabled them to revamp their legacy systems and simultaneously bring innovative services to market, boosting their revenues from S$9.6 billion in 2014, the year it launched its digital transformation, to S$14.6 billion in 2020.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Customer involvement and predictability&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Hybrid methodologies strike a balance between customer involvement and predictability. British Telecom (BT) uses agile methods for digital services, such as its new &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.globalservices.bt.com/en/solutions/products/5g-private-networks&quot;>;5G network&lt;/a>;, to ensure customer involvement by getting feedback early and often. This helps to ensure that the final product meets the needs of customers.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.globalservices.bt.com/en/aboutus/unlocking-the-future-of-infrastructure?cid=ppc_(sc)google(cam)infrastructure(md)ppcad(id)infrastructure&amp;amp;gad=1&amp;amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwl8anBhCFARIsAKbbpyQVcAlVAgU3VYlwMUe8G6mZK1tx6wYwFKM4fOpPHtwxVSEYN9tReLEaAoBeEALw_wcB&amp;amp;gclsrc=aw.ds&quot;>;infrastructure projects&lt;/a>;, such as its new data centers, BT uses Waterfall methods to plan and execute projects more predictably. This helps to ensure that projects are completed on time and within budget. The hybrid approach ensures customer involvement and offers predictable delivery timelines, helping BT achieve an annual revenue of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statista.com/statistics/290320/bt-group-adjusted-revenues/&quot;>;£21.37 billion in 2021&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Benefits of Hybrid Project Management and its related examples include:&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Balanced approach&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Hybrid methodologies offer the best of both worlds, as shown by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/company/how-we-make-games/technology&quot;>;Ubisoft&lt;/a>;. The video game developer used Waterfall to plan and develop assets like characters and initial coding to ensure that the base game would be robust and well-constructed. They switched to Agile when it came to gameplay mechanics, debugging, and post-launch updates. By applying a hybrid approach, Ubisoft successfully launched &lt;em>;Assassin&#39;s Creed Valhalla&lt;/em>; to commercial acclaim in November 2020.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Risk mitigation&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;A hybrid approach allows for risk mitigation by blending Agile&#39;s adaptability with Waterfall&#39;s structured planning, as demonstrated by Tesla&#39;s hybrid approach to the development of their Model 3. To build the Gigafactory, where the vehicle&#39;s batteries are produced, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tesla.com/sites/default/files/blog_attachments/gigafactory.pdf&quot;>;Tesla utilized rigorous planning and risk assessment methods&lt;/a>;. At the same time, Tesla&#39;s capability to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-software-updates-allow-quick-fixes-taking-risks-2022-02-18/&quot;>;update vehicle software over the air&lt;/a>; allows for rapid issue resolution and feature addition post-production. This dual strategy enables Tesla to mitigate risks effectively while maintaining flexibility in a high-stakes manufacturing landscape.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Efficient use of resources&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Hybrid approaches offer the stability of resource-intensive, long-term planning while providing the flexibility to adapt rapidly to market demands. For example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://quickbooks.intuit.com/r/supply-chain/zara-supply-chain-its-secret-to-retail-success/&quot;>;​Zara&#39;s&lt;/a>; detailed planning and staggered development phases ensure that there is minimal resource idling.​ On the other hand,​ cross-functional teams consisting of designers, marketers, and store managers engage in iterative cycles and sprints. These quick feedback loops allow ​Zara to allocate or reallocate resources immediately based on real-time sales data and new fashion trends.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;When Hybrid Methods Work Best&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Recognizing when to use a hybrid method is pivotal to a project&#39;s success. The approach offers adaptability without sacrificing the vision and detailed planning that many projects require, making it an invaluable approach that every organization should develop. So, how can you determine whether your project would benefit from a hybrid approach? Here are some indicators:&lt;/p>; &lt;ol>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Diverse stakeholder needs:&lt;/strong>; When you&#39;re dealing with a broad range of stakeholders, each with their own requirements and expectations, a hybrid approach can cater to all. It can allow for iterative feedback, like in Agile, while maintaining a structured roadmap, as in Waterfall.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Varied project phases:&lt;/strong>; A hybrid method can offer the best of both worlds if different stages of your project require different approaches — such as an initial research phase requiring strict structure, followed by a development phase needing more flexibility.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Uncertain requirements:&lt;/strong>; For projects where requirements may change or need to be fully clear at the outset, but there&#39;s a need for a definite structure or end goal, a hybrid approach can accommodate evolving needs without losing sight of the final objective.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Risk management:&lt;/strong>; If your project encounters high levels of uncertainty or risk that require iterative testing and review but also require thorough documentation and planning, a hybrid method can strike the right balance between adaptability and meticulousness.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Complex project structures:&lt;/strong>; For projects characterized by intricate interdependencies, multifaceted components, or multifunctional teams, a hybrid method can cater to the nuanced demands, balancing rigorous planning with nimble execution.&lt;/li>; &lt;/ol>; &lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;. 。 .&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;It&#39;s time to end the destructive battle between Waterfall and Agile. The key to unlocking the true potential of projects lies in bringing a diverse set of tools to every initiative — an assortment of approaches, methods, and techniques that can be adapted and applied per each project&#39;s unique demands.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hybrid project management methodologies present a promising step in this direction, embracing the strengths of both Waterfall and Agile while offsetting their weaknesses. By having hybrid methods as a tool in our toolbox, we equip ourselves to increase the success rate of projects, deliver more value for our organizations, and navigate the complexities of the &lt;a href=&quot;/2021/11/the-project-economy-has-arrived&quot;>;project economy&lt;/a>; more effectively.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 10 Oct 2023 20:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Transform Business Operations with Process Mining]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/10/transform-business-operations-with-process-mining]]><description> &lt;div>;

&lt;span>;&lt;p>;我们采访的最高效的公司使用流程挖掘来大规模生成运营洞察、识别流程效率低下、定义有针对性的行动并衡量流程改进 &amp;# 8212；所有这些都会导致价值实现。完全接受这种级别的流程管理通常是一项重大的文化变革。领导者描述了从以英雄为中心的公司到以流程为中心的公司的文化历程。我们的目标是建立高效的流程，执行一致、顺利，而不是依靠本地英雄来拯救世界。&lt;/p>;

&lt;/div>; &lt;p>;流程挖掘是从一个学术概念演变而来的（首先&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vdaalst.com /publications/p128.pdf&quot;>;于 2001 年发布&lt;/a>;）是一种用于分析、监控和改进过程性能的流行软件工具。正如我们在&lt;a href=&quot;/2019/04/what-process-mining-is-and-why-companies-should-do-it&quot;>;上一篇文章&lt;/a>;和&lt;a href=&quot; https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-40172-6&quot;>;书&lt;/a>;，流程挖掘分析企业事务系统事件的日志以创建流程的详细图片，从而提供实际流程的数字孪生。它正在迅速取代以前理解业务流程的观察性和主观方法。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;流程挖掘最初是一种用于临时调查流程性能问题的工具，但现已发展成为一个用于监控和改进运营的平台大规模流程执行，以提高流程效率并帮助实现业务价值。作为无可争议的、基于事实的实际流程可视化，它为规模化运营转型提供了独特的事实来源。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我们的研究重点是业务背景和成功背后的关键成功因素。大型组织中的流程挖掘。我们采访了 11 家公司的流程挖掘领导者。我们中的一位（Lars）在担任客户顾问期间观察到许多其他使用 Celonis（该技术的领先提供商）来扩展流程挖掘的努力。现在有很多流程挖掘软件供应商，包括 Microsoft 和 SAP 等老牌公司，我们在这项研究中还采访了其他供应商的客户。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;使用流程挖掘的背景&lt;/strong >;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;我们发现了两种替代环境，公司将流程挖掘应用于其业务并随着时间的推移进行扩展。其中之一涉及在其业务中广泛采用流程导向的公司；另一种情况是那些试图更加注重流程但尚未完全做到这一点的公司内部。在过去的几十年中，流程导向在流程改进和再造工作中变得有些流行，但许多公司尚未将其业务的流程视图完全制度化。以流程为导向的公司拥有明确定义的端到端流程（例如订单到现金和采购到付款）、这些流程的所有者以及明确的目标和绩效指标。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这些公司我们采访了一些既定流程导向的公司（主要是中欧的公司），他们正在使用流程挖掘来超越传统的业务流程建模，进行挖掘并改进基于流程的操作的实际执行。他们用它来大规模生成运营见解、识别流程效率低下、定义有针对性的行动并衡量流程改进——所有这些最终都会导致价值实现。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;没有强大流程导向的公司正在使用流程挖掘来进一步灌输端到端流程的理念，激发更好的流程执行，并减少整个企业流程的变化和复杂性。两个小组都发现该技术很有用，尽管没有强大流程导向的公司的流程挖掘领导者必须花费更多时间宣传该技术并招募业务赞助。完全接受流程管理通常是一种重大的文化变革，我们采访的一家大型全球航运和物流公司就证明了这一点。其流程领导者描述了从一家以英雄为中心的公司到一家流程公司的文化之旅。目标是建立高效的流程，并实现一致、平稳的流程执行，而不是依靠本地英雄来拯救世界。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;扩展的关键成功因素&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;有多种可能的因素可能会推动流程挖掘计划的成功扩展。我们已经确定的一些包括：&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;高管对流程挖掘和持续支持理念的认可&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;企业所有权来推动其领域内的项目&lt;/li>; &lt; li>;创建卓越中心（CoE）——一个专门的团队来加速流程挖掘&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;变革管理、培训和用户社区发展&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;将流程挖掘与战略目标和内部联系起来程序&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;强调流程挖掘中的业务价值实现（价值优先）&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;实时集成和数据访问，并连接到馈送系统&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;运营流程执行工作嵌入到持续管理中。&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;当我们与采访的流程挖掘领导者讨论这些因素时，我们询问哪些因素在他们自己的组织中最重要。最常见的反应是高管的支持——首先招募高管发起人，确保他们的持续支持，并推动整个组织对新项目的采用。在消费产品公司 Reckitt，流程挖掘计划从一开始就得到了首席执行官、首席财务官和 CIDO 的支持。他们不仅赞助该计划，还将其与战略优先事项联系起来，并通过可衡量的 KPI 管理转型。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;企业所有权是高管支持的较低版本，几位流程挖掘领导者也提到过这一点。业务利益相关者或流程所有者需要理解并支持挖掘、分析流程绩效数据并采取行动的想法，否则它根本不会发生或成为日常实践。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在百事公司，业务利益相关者将流程挖掘视为创建一家完全不同的公司使命的关键推动者，作为其数字化转型战略的一部分。默克拥有明确的流程来参与新业务领域，以建立所有权。其中包括介绍现有的默克示例，作为该业务领域的痛点、重要资源和改进潜力的参考和讨论。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;几位流程领导者还提到了高度重视价值的重要性。流程挖掘是有成本的——例如软件和组织支持——对于大多数公司来说，确保计算、验证和实现从中产生的价值非常重要。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;关注业务价值意味着最有价值的项目优先考虑，从而产生积极的商业案例。例如，在医疗保健公司 Cardinal Health，每年都有明确的流程挖掘价值目标。流程挖掘团队每月报告每个项目的真实实际值，并且财务组织和业务利益相关者必须同意它们。进入第二年，康德乐的流程挖掘工作就超额实现了 2.5 倍的价值目标。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一些流程挖掘领导者（通常领导该技术的 CoE）承认，此类中心对于加速发展至关重要采用。然而，如果没有一定程度的高管支持和有能力的团队，它们一开始就不会成立。糖果和宠物食品巨头玛氏提到，其成功的主要因素是找到适合流程挖掘的人才——能够将技术和业务领域连接起来的人。个人需要能够编码、构建数据模型、咨询、理解需求、部署和支持流程改进。毫不奇怪，他们很难找到。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;为了使流程挖掘成为运营转型的强大驱动力，它总是回到人身上。变革管理是欧洲一家制药巨头的关键因素。它有专门的流程挖掘社区计划，包括每两周一次的全体会议、个人发展内部培训课程、展示最佳实践成功案例以及持续的社区活动。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;从见解到行动&lt;/强>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;我们采访的流程挖掘领导者一致认为，重要的是超越对流程如何执行的洞察（流程挖掘的初衷），转向可持续改进的行动。从软件的角度来看，从洞察到行动涉及特定类型流程的目标应用程序和问题领域，例如保留应付账款中的现金或改善应收账款中的现金流（两者在衰退经济体中都很流行）、提高采购中的供应商可靠性以及构建供应链；弹性，或优化库存水平。许多公司还专注于识别并加快订单管理流程中缓慢或低质量的交付。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;从管理角度来看，我们采访的公司采取了各种措施，以便将见解转化为行动。在北欧和波罗的海电信公司 Telia 公司，多种因素共同推动了行动。其 CoE 专注于寻找对流程挖掘感兴趣并愿意尝试的合适业务部门。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在许多情况下，Telia 首席运营官为他们敞开了大门。中心工作人员还努力确定该业务领域的合适人员与他们合作，并让他们参与数据驱动的流程改进。他们咨询了内部客户，以确定他们想要解决的流程问题。最终目标是在运营中使用流程挖掘的见解并每天推动价值。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;流程挖掘的未来&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;此外在询问流程挖掘领导者是什么让他们的组织取得成功（以及什么在这方面没有什么帮助）时，我们还询问了他们未来的流程挖掘和运营转型计划。一些公司专注于利用技术创新；另一些则专注于技术创新。其他人致力于充实流程挖掘的组织基础设施。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在技术方面，Mars 专注于确定自动化分析的进步如何使流程挖掘在整个组织中更易于使用和扩展。目标是无缝生成定制的见解和建议，从而推动业务价值。同样，多方希望人工智能能够帮助用户识别重大改进杠杆并支持更好的流程执行。 BMW 致力于让组织中的几乎每个人都可以使用流程挖掘，目前正在对 80,000 名员工进行数字技能培训，以支持流程挖掘和其他用户发起的活动。 Cardinal Health 希望在其基本流程挖掘软件中添加对任务挖掘和执行管理技术的关注。默克正在致力于以对象为中心的流程挖掘，以实现流程的 3D 视角，并通过数字流程孪生促进跨孤岛改进。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在流程挖掘的组织开发方面，包括过滤器在内的多个组织制造商曼胡默尔希望扩大流程挖掘的用户社区以及有助于改进流程的流程管理组织。 Ingka（宜家零售商）同样希望建立一个由流程挖掘从业者和拥护者组成的社区。其流程挖掘领导者预计，这家全球家具零售商最终将使每个国家都能拥有自己的流程挖掘沙箱进行试验，以及全球范围内的一组联合流程挖掘 CoE。 Mars 希望建立一个超级用户联合网络，而 Telia 则旨在帮助公民开发人员实现流程自动化。 Cardinal Health 与制药和医疗器械公司网络合作，希望扩展流程挖掘以跨组织优化流程。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;这些公司提供的证据表明流程挖掘是一项将持续存在的技术。现在有多家供应商提供它，大公司正在构建技术和组织基础设施来支持它，并且许多公司正在从中获得可观的价值。见解正在转化为行动，最终为组织的高层、底层和绿线提供价值。&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- 引用 -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 09 Oct 2023 21:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[5 Ways to Develop Talent for an Unpredictable Future]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/10/5-ways-to-develop-talent-for-an-unpredictable-future]]><description> &lt;div>;

&lt;/div>; &lt;p>;尽管围绕人工智能和工作自动化有许多标题党的标题和末日般的恐慌，但数据相当清晰：正如我在我的最新书中强调的那样，&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Human-Automation-Quest-Reclaim-Unique-ebook/dp/B099KQV3ZJ&quot;>;&lt;em>;我，人类：人工智能，自动化，以及重新找回使我们与众不同的追求&lt;/em>;&lt;/a>;&lt;em>;，&lt;/em>;您因人工智能而失业的可能性比&lt;a href=&quot;/2023/05/3- human-super-talents-ai-will-not-replace&quot;>;另一个人&lt;/a>;使用人工智能，特别是如果你自己不使用人工智能的话。从这个意义上说，人工智能时代并不是什么新鲜事。就像以前的颠覆性技术一样，人工智能正在消除一些工作岗位，但反过来又创造了更多新的工作岗位，这迫切需要人类。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;正如我们最近的万宝盛华报告所述，&lt;a href=&quot;https://www .manpowergroup.com/en/news-releases/news/58-of-employers- believe-artificial-intelligence-and-virtual-reality-will-be-job-creators&quot;>;58％的雇主&lt;/a>;看到人工智能作为新就业岗位的净创造者。问题在于，因工作自动化而失业的人（例如，实体店经理）不会自动获得由技术创造的所有新工作（例如，网络安全分析师、数字营销人员或人工智能伦理学家）。据&lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10796-022-10308-y&quot;>;世界经济论坛&lt;/a>;称，到 2025 年，一半员工将需要重新培训才能跟上随着新技术的发展，这个数字早于当前的生成式人工智能热潮。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;正如斯坦福大学的 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNX_6gzLIvI&quot;>;Erik Brynjolfsson&lt;/a >; 据估计，组织在技术上每花费一美元，就需要在人才和相关流程上额外投资九美元，例如识别具有合适技能和潜力的人员；培养正确的技能；启用适当的变更管理流程；并为人们&lt;a href=&quot;/2023/07/when-your-employee-isnt-reaching-their-full-potial&quot;>;发挥潜力&lt;/a>;创造条件。事实上，正如我和我的同事 Becky Frankiewicz 和我&lt;a href=&quot;/2020/05/digital-transformation-is-about-talent-not-technology&quot;>;指出的&lt;/a>;，数字化转型的成败并不是真正的数字化转型。技术，但人的因素：人才。&lt;/p>; &lt;article-promo>; &lt;hbr-component type=&quot;promo&quot; is-insight=&quot;insight-center&quot; title=&quot;工作的未来&quot; dek=&quot;您的公司会吗适应还是被抛在后面？” cta-text=&quot;&quot; href=&quot;/insight-center/the-future-of-work&quot;>;

&lt;/div>; &lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hbr-component>; &lt;/article-promo>; &lt;p>;所以，我们需要的不仅仅是重新技能或提升技能，而是&lt;em >;预技能——也就是说，在我们知道明天的工作和需求技能是什么之前，能够培养面向未来的人才并重塑人们的职业生涯。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;预技能-为未知的未来培养员工技能&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;如何做到这一点？尽管没有人知道确切的秘诀，尤其是因为没有关于未来的数据，但我们可以从宏观历史趋势进行推断，并从最近的经济和人力资本模式中吸取教训，提出五项广泛的建议：&lt;/p>; &lt;h3 >;1) 关注潜力&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;随着当前技能、专业知识和绩效的生命周期缩短，建议聘用和提拔人员以实现&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.myhrfuture.com /digital-hr-leaders-podcast/how-ai-can-unlock- human-pottial-and-make-work-more-meaningful&quot;>;他们&lt;em>;可以&lt;/em>;做什么&lt;/a>;，而不是做什么他们过去做过。&lt;/em>;。这意味着优先考虑软技能 - 例如&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.learnabilityquotient.com/&quot;>;学习能力&lt;/a>;、&lt;a href=&quot;/2015/12/assessment-whats-your-curiosity- profile&quot;>;好奇心&lt;/a>;、复原力和适应能力 - 高于硬技能 - 例如编程或数据挖掘 - 专注于基础&lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ iops.12001&quot;>;就业能力的要素&lt;/a>;，而不是当前的技术专长或过去的就业经历，这两者仍然主导着现代招聘方法。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;简单地说，我们可能不知道明天的工作会是什么样子但我们可以有把握地假设，当人们更具好奇心、情商更高、适应力更强、更有动力、更聪明时，他们通常会更有能力学习完成这些工作所需的知识，并提供技术无法替代的任何人类价值。潜力的一个优势是我们拥有可靠且经过验证的方法来衡量它，特别是&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Talent-Delusion-Intuition-Unlocking-Potential/dp/0349412480&quot;>;心理评估工具&lt;/a>;，它也可以用来&lt;em>;开发&lt;/em>;人们的潜力，特别是通过规范和&lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2019-21619-003&quot;>;数据驱动的反馈&lt;/a>;，帮助他们识别他们的现状和他们需要达到的目标之间的差距（见下一点）。&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;2）提供关键反馈&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;甚至在之前人工智能到来后，人们对于将人们的才能和潜力与最佳职业选择结合起来已经存在很多困惑和误解。现在事情变得更加复杂，大多数员工（和经理）都想知道他们将来会做什么，他们的经验和专业知识 - 以及他们在职业生涯中投入的所有时间和金钱 - 是否仍然相关，如果所以，在哪里。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;共享数据驱动的反馈（来自评估、内部数据和同行评级）并帮助人们了解他们的兴趣和技能如何成为组织的未来资产是关键。这意味着将&lt;a href=&quot;/2019/11/the-leader-as-coach&quot;>;领导者视为教练或人才经纪人&lt;/a>;，他们的主要工作是主动培养人们的才能，并利用他们的才能充分的潜力。请记住：大多数人&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Fair-Talk-Three-Powerful-Feedback/dp/1912555093&quot;>;反馈被剥夺&lt;/a>;，并且令人震惊的&lt;a href= “https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1996-02773-003&quot;>;三分之二的反馈干预措施&lt;/a>;未能产生理想的结果。关键是告诉人们他们&lt;em>;需要&lt;/em>;听什么，即使他们&lt;em>;不想&lt;/em>;听，最重要的是，你告诉他们一些他们不知道的事情这可以激励他们变得更好。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;至关重要的是，仅仅向人们提供有关他们技能差距的反馈是不够的；还需要更多的反馈。组织还需要激励他们发展相关技能，同时提供最高效、最具吸引力和影响力的计划来发展这些技能。&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;3) 关注人才扩展&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;而不是押注于人才扩张专家或强迫人们进入特定的领域，专注于拓宽或扩展人们的才能。这意味着&lt;em>;不&lt;/em>;发挥&lt;a href=&quot;/2016/01/strengths-based-coaching-can-actually-weaken-you&quot;>;人们的优势&lt;/a>;，而是帮助他们发展&lt;em>;新的&lt;/em>;优势，因此它们变得更加多才多艺。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我们都有一种自然的倾向，让世界适应我们当前的技能，这样我们就可以“用更少的钱做更多的事” ”并针对懒惰效率进行优化，而不是延伸目标或获取新技能。事实上，除非你的员工在任何专业领域都处于前 1%（根据定义，这只能适用于极少数人），否则他们将更容易成为万事通，尤其是因为随着您学习的每一项新任务或技能，都会有许多与其他任务、工作和职业相关的新的基础技能。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这也将增加多样性和包容性。正如哈佛大学的 Joseph Fuller 和 Christina Langer 以及 Burning Glass Institute 的 Matt Sigelman &lt;a href=&quot;/2022/02/skills-based-hiring-is-on-the-rise&quot;>;指出&lt;/a>;：“向技能的转变基于招聘的招聘将为大量潜在员工提供机会，近年来，这些潜在员工经常因学位膨胀而被排除在考虑之外。”如果组织抱怨无法找到多元化和创造性的人才，他们应该停止在相同的地方和方式中寻找人才。&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;4) 投资于中层管理人员&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;作为&lt;a href=&quot;/2023/07/3-ways-to-reenergize-your-team-when-morale-is-low&quot;>;艾米·埃德蒙森和我&lt;/a>;最近指出，管理者掌握着释放人类潜力的钥匙在工作中，尤其是当面临的挑战是振兴、重新激发和重新构想人才时。即使在人工智能时代之前，中层管理人员的作用就至关重要，占团队的 30% 到 40% &lt;/a>;，但该角色的复杂性大大增加。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;从历史上看，经理是具有经过验证的技术专长和作为个人贡献者的过去出色表现的人。如今，他们不仅需要了解“经典”管理任务（雇用合适的人员，给他们正确的任务和方向，利用反馈来激励他们，并提高团队绩效），还需要了解一些非常复杂的具体新挑战，例如作为&lt;a href=&quot;/2020/10/how-to-manage-a-hybrid-team&quot;>;管理混合&lt;/a>;和虚拟团队，&lt;a href=&quot;/2022/12/a-guide-to- Building-psychological-safety-on-your-team&quot;>;创造心理安全&lt;/a>;、&lt;a href=&quot;/2021/05/5-strategies-to-infuse-di-into-your-organization&quot;>;提升 DEIB &lt;/a>;（包括雇用和激励与自己不同的人），以及帮助人们&lt;a href=&quot;/2023/06/what-will-working-with-ai-really-require&quot;>;管理人员-人工智能时代&lt;/a>;，包括引发的所有不确定性和压力。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;简而言之，从未有过更好的&lt;a href=&quot;https://qz.com/the-case-for -investing-a-lot-more-in-middle-managers-in-1850548862&quot;>;有时间投资&lt;/a>;中层管理人员，特别是利用关键的软技能，这些技能可能使他们能够适应未来跟上技术进步并推动组织期望从新创新中实现价值。&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;5) 投资于领导技能&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;如果您担心人工智能推动的未来，但仍然认为人类将成为图片的一部分，那么你应该担心对你的领导者进行预先培训，因为他们（仍然）将负责制定和销售公司的战略，并在明天的不确定时期推动其文化的演变。在某种程度上，这仍然是关于提拔具有正确软技能（根据步骤 1）的个人并发展这些技能。这也是关于&lt;a href=&quot;/2019/08/hire-leaders-for-what-they-can-do-not-what-they-have-done&quot;>;继续前进&lt;/a>;并了解当今的顶级领导者可能不适合未来，尤其是因为他们的成功是建立在复制过去行之有效的基础上的，这往往是改变或学习新事物的障碍。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;重要的是，投资于领导力意味着利用使人们能够有效协作并成为高绩效团队的技能。这不是为了将个人提升到高级职位或荣耀地位，更不是为了通常支持的人气竞赛&lt;a href=&quot;/2017/10/what-science-says-about-identifying-high-pottial-employees&quot;>;“高潜力”提名&lt;/a>;——更确切地说，它是关于人们必须具备的品质，以激励、激励和带领他人进入一个肯定会包括人工智能的未来，但理想情况下也应该被定义为人类人工智能时代。这是当今领导力面临的严峻挑战。如果组织能够升级其领导力选拔系统，从复制过去的成功经验转向选择和培养未来的技能，那么所有其他挑战都会变得更容易。特别是，这意味着不再强调“文化契合度”、过去的表现和技术专长等因素，而是更多地关注学习能力、好奇心、正直和人际交往能力。更重要的是，如果组织真正对利用多样性感兴趣，他们必须优先考虑&lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/what-makes-an-inclusive-leader&quot;>;包容性&lt;/a>;&lt;a href=&quot;https:// www.businessinsider.com/key-attributes-inclusive-leader-professor-business-psychology?r=US&amp;IR=T&quot;>;领导力&lt;/a>; 和认知多样性，打破领导力概况的同质性。&lt;/p >; &lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;。 。 .&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;技术总是在变化，但为了确保这些变化实际上是一种进化（即促进进步），我们必须尽一切努力使人类能够开发和部署相关人才来收获技术的潜在好处。尽管这绝不是理所当然的，但我们应该对我们的物种继续适应自身技术发明的能力充满信心。&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;即使没有破产，许多原本可行的公司也可能面临因成本上升、大流行导致的客户行为变化、挥之不去的供应链问题、不稳定的商业环境下销售的不确定性，以及寻找短期资金几乎肯定的困难。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;流动性通常被视为财务问题，但事实上，运营发挥着重要作用。在预防或解决现金问题方面发挥主导作用。改进运营、销售和财务协同运作方式的公司可以产生现金和息税折旧摊销前利润 (EBITDA)，而且数量通常相当多且速度非常快。加强销售和运营规划使公司能够在不受外部干扰的情况下掌握自己的命运——这在目前是一种特别有用的能力。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;中型市场公司通过进行这种转型可以获得很多好处。 We&#39;ve seen companies improve working capital by 20–30% and increase EBITDA substantially in just a few months. One private-equity-owned manufacturer of vitamins and nutritional supplements, for example, saw a 10% gain in EBITDA largely by making its overseas sales and distribution (where most of its growth potential lay) more connected with manufacturing operations in the United States. That helped drive down production and shipping costs.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;By the same token, the impact of poor sales and operations planning hits the middle market hard. That&#39;s partly because these companies are disadvantaged if they need outside capital. In an AlixPartners&#39; &lt;a href=&quot;https://features.alixpartners.com/turnaround-transformation-survey-2023/&quot;>;2023 survey&lt;/a>;, 96% of turnaround and restructuring experts said the middle market is most at risk from today&#39;s capital constraints. Midsized companies are also threatened because they often sell to large multinationals, which increasingly &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/some-companies-are-taking-longer-to-pay-suppliers-despite-recovery-11623058200&quot;>;use their muscle to pay suppliers later, &lt;/a>;in some cases trying to lock in easy terms they won during the pandemic. Because middle market companies tend to be less diversified, they are more vulnerable to shocks. And, because of their size, their “liquidity runway” — the time they have before a cash shortage becomes a crisis — is shorter than for big companies.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Every company has some kind of process for aligning supply and demand. In smaller companies, it&#39;s often very informal: Sales comes in with a forecast, the CFO discounts it, production adds some back as a cushion, and every quarter people adjust things. Many have a more sophisticated process, but it tends to be rigid and unresponsive to weak signals from the market, which leads to fire drills in production, if business is unexpectedly good, and fire sales, if things fall short. In both cases, the emphasis in the process is on managing production smoothly, not on generating cash and margin.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What&#39;s needed — especially by the middle market — is a transformed sales and operations planning process that threads the needle between informality and bureaucracy and gives executives the ability to adjust operations to increase cash generation and profitability.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This transformation has four elements:&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;An aligned team among operations, sales, and finance.&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;When these teams are aligned, they are &lt;strong>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong>;empowered with knowledge of how the company uses and generates cash. “Aligned” is the key word. Operations and sales planning should be managed in a cross-functional “war room,” but it won&#39;t work unless all participants are explicitly motivated by items that affect cash generation and margin, which aren&#39;t usually among the KPIs ops and sales track. In most companies, the operations team is measured on cost of goods, defect rates, machine utilization, and the like; sales teams tend to track and reward volume, with special incentives for promotions and so on. Those incentives should be changed to include cash and working capital measurements (eg, days of inventory, average discounts, average days outstanding for receivables).&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Forecasts need to be recast, too, so they model how predicted levels of production and sales will affect all three views of the enterprise: income statement, cash flow, and balance sheet. The team also needs an enterprise-wide view of liquidity needs, biggest threats to liquidity, and biggest sources of cash — that is, which products or lines of business consume or churn out the most cash. Those reveal what levers you can pull.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;More rigorous and flexible forecasts.&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;It&#39;s not uncommon for CFOs to cut the sales team&#39;s forecasts by &lt;a href=&quot;/2021/03/to-maximize-growth-get-sales-and-finance-in-sync&quot;>;as much as 25%&lt;/a>;, partly because sales teams tend to be too optimistic and their predictions sometimes aren&#39;t defensible enough. Another problem is their time horizon. In our experience, it&#39;s best to build rolling mid-to-long-term (3–14 month) views of demand, use them to produce three-month forecasts that are solid enough so you can make purchasing and marketing decisions, and tweak them weekly or monthly. Too far out, plans won&#39;t be reliable; too close in, you can&#39;t act strategically.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Don&#39;t forget — as many companies do — to use data on customer churn and loyalty to test, validate, and adjust forecasts. You&#39;ll want to tune that view of demand in four ways: First, to get a clear picture of where cash and EBITDA are (and are not) coming from, build out a picture of profits as well as volume; you want to know which products and customers provide the most — and least — profit, and &lt;a href=&quot;/1987/09/manage-customers-for-profits-not-just-sales&quot;>;pay close attention&lt;/a>; to their orders and behavior. Second, &lt;a href=&quot;/2022/09/setting-your-annual-budget-amid-economic-uncertainty&quot;>;as you should with your overall budget,&lt;/a>; create scenarios for the long-term view — for example, what high, medium, or low demand would be, or what would happen if sales suddenly skewed to the lowest-price or least profitable items you sell. Third, predetermine the indicators that would tell you whether a scenario is coming to pass; this will make it harder to ignore warnings. Finally, use monthly and quarterly reviews not just to track the forecast to plan, but to revalidate its premises.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;A similarly rigorous map of supply.&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;The should include material, component, and labor availability. Among other things, you will want to identify components or supplies that have the longest lead times or where your knowledge of conditions upstream tells you to beware of price or supply shocks. Many providers help companies build supply chain “control towers” to track availability and pricing in near-real time, often with help from AI. These used to be the nearly exclusive province of multinationals, but they are now within the reach of most middle-market budgets.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Operations that optimize profitability, not predictability.&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;An operations plan that guarantees uninterrupted production of your least profitable products isn&#39;t good. With the knowledge you now have about the profitability of products and customers, a better flow of information from the field, and an empowered cross-functional team, you can now exploit whatever flexibility your operations have to shift production from one location or product to another or prioritize orders from profitable customers. You can make analogous changes to inventory management. Viewed strategically, inventory can be a liquidity drain or a new customer-acquisition tool — “bad” or “good” inventory — and managed accordingly. Thinking long-term, you can reorient capital spending to increase operational flexibility in the areas that have the most direct impact on cash and margin.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A program like this released $17 million in working capital — a reduction of about 180 days — for a $2 billion-in-sales consumer goods company based in the Mississippi Valley. The company&#39;s operations were knocked off balance after Covid wreaked havoc on its supply chain and caused demand to whipsaw, as big online retailers suddenly scooped up business from local shops. Its forecasting model was shot; unable to know where sales were coming from, one business unit was forking over nearly a million dollars in late-delivery penalties and air freight. Working from guesstimates, factories produced the wrong mix of products and procurement purchased too little of some components and too much of others, so that fill rates (the percentage of orders completed in full and on time) plunged from 95% to about 75%. To try to cover orders, the operations team stocked up $12 million more in finished-goods inventory than the company needed. Previous attempts to address the problem had looked at it piecemeal — at supplies and components, at production planning, at forecasting — rather than systematically. We worked with them to build a rough-cut capacity model that allowed revealed potential supply-demand imbalances months earlier than before; improve analytics skills on the forecasting team; and institute a monthly cadence of sales-and-operations-planning meetings that brought data and decision-makers into the same room.&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;• • •&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Without a systematic view, the incentives and good intentions of each player in this game — procurement, production, and sales — will almost always pull it out of balance. The operations team is uniquely placed to bring the system together, because the pain is felt there first, in the form of stockrooms that aren&#39;t being emptied or orders that can&#39;t be filled. By the time the pain appears in cash and EBITDA, it&#39;s late — sometimes too late.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 06 Oct 2023 23:25:01 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Help Your Employees Develop the Skills They Really Need]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/10/help-your-employees-develop-the-skills-they-really-need]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/10/Oct23_06_532771834.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;Steve Chenn/Getty Images&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;The future of work will not be determined by technology, but by creating the right mix of education, exposure, and experience needed to develop skills and put them to work, creating a vastly more productive workplace and economy. In this article, the authors recommend a &amp;#8220;70/20/10&amp;#8221; learning model, in which only 10% of learning comes from formal instruction (education), 20% from social learning or mentorship (exposure), and 70% from hands-on, experiential practice with feedback (experience). By adopting this model, organizations can ensure that employees not only understand new skills, but that they can apply them effectively in different contexts.

A generation ago, the half-life of the value of a skill was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20190127-humanics-a-way-to-robot-proof-your-career&quot;>;approximately 26 years&lt;/a>;. Now the half-life is often &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/reskilling-in-the-age-of-ai&quot;>;less than five years&lt;/a>;. So, it is perhaps not surprising that, globally, corporations are expected to invest more than&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/2022-corporate-training-landscape-training-industry-inc-&quot;>; $380 billion&lt;/a>; in learning and development programs this year.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yet we need to do better. We know that, after decades of trying, skills related to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.industryweek.com/operations/continuous-improvement/article/21267990/widespread-lean-adoption-would-make-the-us-more-competitive&quot;>;lean manufacturing&lt;/a>;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://pmessentials.us/agile-better-adoption-low/&quot;>;agile development&lt;/a>; and &lt;a href=&quot;/2022/12/the-failure-of-the-dei-industrial-complex&quot;>;overcoming unconscious bias,&lt;/a>; just to name a few, are woefully under-adopted in most organizations. In fact, a recent report by McKinsey &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/McKinsey/Business%20Functions/Organization/Our%20Insights/Beyond%20hiring%20How%20companies%20are%20reskilling%20to%20address%20talent%20gaps/Beyond-hiring-How-companies-are-reskilling.pdf&quot;>;found&lt;/a>; that 87% of firms surveyed expect to have a skills gap in the next five years.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;More training is not the answer. We can&#39;t simply send employees to workshops focused on whatever proficiency is fashionable at the moment and expect to get results. What is essential is to build coherent skills-based strategies. We must think seriously about which specific skills are to be targeted, who has to learn them, and what mix of education, experience, and exposure will be effective to create the skills-based organizations we need to meet the challenges of the future.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, at the software company PKWARE, where Todd was executive vice president, the company invested more than 1% of revenues on sales training focused on aligning the team around a particular process. While the staff was educated, it failed to yield the expected impact because the employees weren&#39;t consistently getting the mentoring and real-time coaching they needed to sustain the initial improvements.&lt;/p>; &lt;article-promo>; &lt;hbr-component type=&quot;promo&quot; is-insight=&quot;insight-center&quot; title=&quot;The Future of Work&quot; dek=&quot;Will your company adapt or be left behind?&quot; cta-text=&quot;&quot; href=&quot;/insight-center/the-future-of-work&quot;>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/insight-center/the-future-of-work&quot; style=&quot;color:black ;text-decoration:none&quot;>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; 洞察中心集合 &lt;/div>; &lt;h3>;工作的未来&lt;/h3>; &lt;div>; 您的公司会适应还是被抛在后面？ &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hbr-component>; &lt;/article-promo>; &lt;p>;Compare that with Wipro, where Abhijit was previously chief learning officer. Business leaders from the insurance unit were trained in a specific skill: storytelling. Executives went to a literary festival in which they were &lt;a href=&quot;https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/company/corporate-trends/wipro-senior-executives-at-jaipur-literature-festival-to-polish-narration-skills/articleshow/11573005.cms&quot;>;exposed to professional storytellers&lt;/a>; over three days. Each night they also attended a structured workshop that helped them process what they observed. After returning to the office, they received continued peer mentoring for an extended period and were encouraged, in turn, to train their own teams on storytelling. This not only helped spread the skills, but gave the leaders the opportunity to further deepen their own proficiency as they taught others. The result: a dramatic improvement in winning deals and a significant boost in revenue growth.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Anders Ericsson, who has spent decades researching expertise, points to the importance of &lt;a href=&quot;/2007/07/the-making-of-an-expert&quot;>;deliberate practice&lt;/a>; in developing world-class performers. Mere instruction is not enough, you also need to practice skills, identify areas for improvement, and receive coaching. It is this combination of education, experience, and exposure that improve performance.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;The 70/20/10 Learning Model&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;If our organizations are to learn the skills needed to win the future, we recommend a “70/20/10” learning model incorporating education, exposure, and experience. Here&#39;s how it works:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;10% Formal Instruction (Education):&lt;/strong>;&amp;nbsp;This portion of the learning strategy involves structured educational experiences, such as the storytelling workshops the Wipro executives attended at night. Other examples include webinars or in-person courses that focus on specific skills.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;20% Social Learning (Exposure):&lt;/strong>;&amp;nbsp;Social learning involves learning from others. This is the role the professional storytellers played in the Wipro example. Other options include mentoring, coaching, or peer-to-peer interactions. For example, setting up a mentorship program within an organization can help employees learn from more experienced colleagues. Regular team-building activities can also foster a culture of continuous learning and help improve skills.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;70% Learning in the Flow of Work (Experience):&lt;/strong>;&amp;nbsp;This is the most significant part of the learning strategy. It involves learning on the job through real-life experiences and tasks. For example, employees can improve their problem-solving skills by working on complex projects. Regular feedback sessions can help employees reflect on their performance and identify areas for improvement. When the participants of the storytelling workshop continued to teach their own colleagues and apply it in their business pitches and reviews, they got precious hands-on experience that deepened their storytelling skills.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is very different from more traditional corporate learning approaches that focus primarily on MBA-style classroom instruction, like the one General Electric made famous at the Management Development Institute at Crotonville during the Jack Welch era. To be successful in the 70/20/10 learning model, managers need to take an active role as &lt;a href=&quot;/2019/11/the-leader-as-coach&quot;>;coaches&lt;/a>;, rather than as taskmasters, working to mentor their staff to improve performance. At the same time, Learning and Development (L&amp;amp;D) departments are going to have to do more than merely source curricula; they need to collaborate intensively with leaders to design personalized learning environments. Learning needs to be inclusive, continuous, and collaborative.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, as part of a regional initiative to reinvigorate the Texas Panhandle region, BOC Bank sought to help its managers make the transition from seeing their roles as performance evaluators to upskilling coaches. The L&amp;amp;D team didn&#39;t start with a preexisting learning plan, but first spent time with leaders to identify tasks for performance improvement. Those tasks were then broken down into skills that individual employees needed to learn, and the L&amp;amp;D team mentored managers as they took the lead coaching their staff through personalized learning plans, using the 70/20/10 model. Within nine months, they started seeing measurable results in terms of the company&#39;s standard business metrics. “Our adoption of the 70/20/10 model is directly fueling our ability to innovate, enabling us to build distinctive core software that sets us apart in the banking sector,” said Alex O&#39;Brien, CEO of the bank.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If we are to compete for the future, we need to shift from a “war for talent” mindset to a skills-based mindset. Talent isn&#39;t an innate property that firms can attract and bid for, but a capacity that needs to be built — and in any case, the most vital skills of the future don&#39;t exist yet. In the same way that venture capitalists invest in and manage portfolios of companies, corporate leaders need to pursue portfolios of skills, divesting in some that become obsolete while doubling down on others that begin to pay off.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The future of work will not be determined by technology, but by creating the right mix of education, exposure, and experience needed to develop skills and put them to work, creating a vastly more productive workplace and economy.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 06 Oct 2023 22:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[How to Avoid the Unexpected Consequences of Your DEI Policy]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/10/how-to-avoid-the-unexpected-consequences-of-your-dei-policy]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/10/Oct23_06_1257013702.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;MirageC/Getty Images&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;Will the DEI policy you&amp;#8217;re about to implement actually hurt some of the people you&amp;#8217;re trying to help? New research on this question shows that, yes, this can happen if you fail to take a systems-level view &amp;#8212; but the good news is there are three key ways to avoid unintended consequences. First, consider subgroups. Think about variation within the group of people the policy is aimed at helping; for example, whether the experiences of most women employees might differ from women managers. Second, think big. Recognize that the interactions between people at your organization are diverse and complex. When policies reverberate, they can harm groups or subgroups in unanticipated ways. Third, track closely. Monitor the policy as it is being rolled out for any negative effects on employees.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/10/how-to-avoid-the-unexpected-consequences-of-your-dei-policy?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/10/how-to-avoid-the-unexpected-consequences-of-your-dei-policy?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;While many managers are attempting to improve inequalities facing employees by implementing diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) policies, &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/07/why-diversity-programs-fail&quot;>;these policies often have unexpected, negative consequences for the employees&lt;/a>; — including those the policies are trying to help. How can managers avoid this?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/epub/10.1177/00018392231174235&quot;>;My research&lt;/a>; shows that there is a need to take a systems-level view of inequality when implementing DEI policies. That is, when designing and implementing a policy, managers must consider how it will reverberate throughout the organization — and how it might ultimately backfire.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;The Policy&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;At the midsize American professional services organization I studied, leaders had the well-intentioned aim of implementing a flexible work policy that allowed employees more control over where and when they worked. The company was already considered life- and family-friendly by employees, and leaders wanted to cement this, both because it would help current employees&#39; well-being and also because it could provide the company with a competitive edge in hiring. Leaders also recognized that these policies could help women in particular, because at this professional organization — &lt;a href=&quot;/2022/09/the-surprising-benefits-of-work-life-support&quot;>;as in many others&lt;/a>; — women performed more family care than men.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Once the policy was rolled out, it did in fact help many employees. And as anticipated, I found that the policy helped women in particular integrate and balance work and life demands. For instance, it helped them break up their schedule and spend more time with their kids, and lessen the time they spent commuting so they could spend time with family.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;The Problem&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;However, what the organization&#39;s leaders — and I — did not anticipate was how the flexible work policy harmed a specific group of women: women managers. This was despite the fact that these managers were almost all very vocal supporters of improving gender equality, and had advocated for and supported a wide variety of other women- and family-friendly initiatives, including backup childcare, onsite daycare, and a women speaker series.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;How did this happen? My research found that many women managers had developed a managerial style focused on close, day-to-day interactions with subordinates. For instance, many would regularly stop by the offices of each of their subordinates daily, asking them how they were doing and if they could offer any help or guidance with their work. Others would work with their doors open so that subordinates could stop by their office whenever they needed help. Employees appreciated these managers&#39; efforts, not only because they provided more immediate task-based assistance but also because, over time, these managers came to know their employees very well and could offer custom-tailored advice on project staffing, career training, and so on.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Importantly, the women managers did not develop this managerial style in a vacuum. Rather, it seemed to reflect stereotypes they faced on the job: They experienced pressure to be helpful and communal, rather than direct and assertive like their male manager counterparts.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The problem from the women managers&#39; perspective was that the flexible work policy would make the style they had developed difficult to maintain. While video calls were an option, managers did not view them as an easy or natural way to spark interaction. Others pointed out that with their subordinates working different schedules with varied hours, this meant that they needed to be available at a broader range of hours as well if they were to remain available and helpful to their workers. Not only would this be difficult for anyone to do, it also threatened to make women managers&#39; own work-life conflict much worse because it made it hard for them to have time with their own families.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;While my research was specifically on gender, what I found was consistent with &lt;a href=&quot;/2020/07/update-your-dei-playbook&quot;>;other&lt;/a>; &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/00018392231183649&quot;>;research&lt;/a>; that emphasizes the need to consider &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.aom.org/doi/abs/10.5465/amr.2017.0087&quot;>;the whole organization to effectively implement a DEI effort&lt;/a>;, as well as research that highlights the importance of considering &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.aom.org/doi/abs/10.5465/amr.2017.0062&quot;>;how individuals engage and interact with one another within the organizational system&lt;/a>;. This is in addition, of course, to considering other important causes of DEI policy failure, such as &lt;a href=&quot;/2022/10/is-your-dei-progress-undermined-by-attention-inequality&quot;>;various&lt;/a>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/03/to-overcome-resistance-to-dei-understand-whats-driving-it&quot;>;individual-level biases&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Avoiding Unexpected Consequences from Your DEI Policy&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Given that DEI policies can reverberate in organizations in unexpected ways — and potentially undermine hard-won progress on equity- and equality-related outcomes — it is important for managers to anticipate such issues. My research, and complementary research by other scholars (some of which I detail below) presents three key suggestions for how managers can limit the chance of their policies backfiring. These suggestions are all rooted in taking a systems-level view of inequality when designing and implementing DEI policies.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;1. Consider subgroups.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;When designing a DEI policy, think about variation within the group of people the policy is aimed at helping. In my research, there was an important difference between the experiences of most women employees (who benefited from the policy) and women managers (who were harmed).&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As another example, imagine if managers attempted to help Black employees through creating a peer mentorship program. This program might provide vital help, advice, and connection at work for enrolled Black employees, who researchers finds are &lt;a href=&quot;/2022/02/20-of-white-employees-have-sponsors-only-5-of-black-employees-do&quot;>;much less likely to have internal sponsors when compared to white workers&lt;/a>;, despite the fact that such aid is &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/06/a-better-approach-to-mentorship#:~:text=The%20evidence%20is%20clear%3A%2075,mentor%20are%20happy%20at%20work.&quot;>;vital for career success&lt;/a>;. However, if there are &lt;a href=&quot;/2021/11/what-do-black-executives-really-want&quot;>;relatively few senior Black employees in a company&lt;/a>; — a common occurrence given historical patterns of systemic racism — then these few employees may each have many mentees. The unexpected, unanticipated result may be that senior Black employees end up spending a lot of time coaching junior Black employees instead of focusing on pushing their own careers forward.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The lesson here is not that DEI policies should not be introduced, of course. It is that with better planning, such negative results can be anticipated and curbed. And once noticed — whether this is before or even after rollout — solutions can be found. For instance, in our example, could senior Black employees be relieved of other “helping” duties so common in organizations to free up more of their time? Or could these employees be given more &lt;a href=&quot;/2020/07/update-your-dei-playbook&quot;>;“glamor work”&lt;/a>; to help them shine? In general, the point here is to not think about a given group — women, LGBTQ+ people, Black people, and so on — monolithically, but rather to recognize the varying organizational ranks, roles, and tasks of employees as well as their &lt;a href=&quot;/2022/06/an-intersectional-approach-to-inclusion-at-work&quot;>;intersectional identities&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;2. Think big.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;A systems-level perspective draws attention to the fact that &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/01/todays-most-critical-workplace-challenges-are-about-systems&quot;>;the interactions and connections between people in organizations are diverse and complex&lt;/a>;. As my research demonstrates, when policies reverberate, they can harm groups or subgroups in ways that are entirely unanticipated by organizational leaders and policy designers.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For instance, well-intentioned “ban the box” initiatives aimed at preventing discrimination against people with criminal records — and adopted by many companies and mandated in over a hundred states, cities, and counties in the United States — have also been found to in some cases &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/21/upshot/ban-the-box-an-effort-to-stop-discrimination-may-actually-increase-it.html&quot;>;increase racial discrimination against Black applicants&lt;/a>;, because when these policies are in place, it seems employers are more likely to incorrectly presume Black applicants have a criminal past.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Again, the solution here is not to disavow DEI policies. Rather, it is important to think big when considering how policies could potentially result in unexpected negative consequences for workers, because you never know where or when such consequences will arise. To do this, gather &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/11/why-diverse-teams-are-smarter&quot;>;a diverse group of employees to brainstorm&lt;/a>; what potential challenges could come about from the introduction of a new DEI policy. Also read about and research the experiences of other companies that have implemented similar policies, to see what (if any) unintended consequences may have arisen through their policy adoption.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;3. Track closely.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Monitor the policy as it is being rolled out for any negative effects on employees. There are different layers to monitoring. One is to get immediate, qualitative feedback on employees&#39; experiences through focus groups or anonymous suggestion boxes that let employees provide comments without fear of backlash. Longer term, it is important to analyze internal administrative data to check that there are no concerning or unexpected patterns. This includes looking to see if there is variation between groups or subgroups (eg, women versus men, or black women versus white women) on important markers of individual career success such as performance evaluations, salary, bonuses, and promotions.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some organizations have even started piloting their DEI initiatives before rolling them out organization-wide, and such efforts can improve policy quality by identifying issues before the policy has even been officially implemented. Ericsson, a global telecommunications company, &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/04/why-you-should-start-ab-testing-your-dei-initiatives&quot;>;tested a policy intervention aimed at improving women&#39;s interest in internal job openings&lt;/a>;. This testing helped Ericsson identify the message that seemed most likely to decrease the gender gap. And before rolling out a flexible work policy more broadly, &lt;a href=&quot;/2009/10/making-time-off-predictable-and-required&quot;>;Boston Consulting Group tested it with smaller groups of consultants&lt;/a>;. Here, it is important to collect data on employees&#39; experiences at baseline (before rollout) to compare with their experiences after policy implementation&lt;/p>; &lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;. 。 .&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;DEI policies remain important ways to achieve positive improvements in equality within organizations. These three steps — which take a systems-level view of inequality — are purposeful, meaningful changes that managers can enact to design effective and impactful DEI policies. Of course, the research I present here is just a starting point. More is needed — particularly that accounts for different actors&#39; perspectives and the connections between them — to understand how DEI policies can be designed to best help employees.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 06 Oct 2023 21:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[A New Approach to Writing Job Descriptions]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/10/a-new-approach-to-writing-job-descriptions]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/10/Oct23_06_4600878.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;Juan Moyano/Stocksy&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;Traditional job descriptions can&amp;#8217;t keep up with the rate of change in real roles in today&amp;#8217;s organizations. As new technologies disrupt processes and require new skills, and as companies are moving toward more and more project-based work, we are beginning to see the evolution of job descriptions away from static, holistic prescriptions that follow an employee for years to dynamic guidance that changes based on needs.

As new technologies disrupt processes and require new skills, and as companies are moving toward more and more project-based work, we are beginning to see the evolution of job descriptions away from static, holistic prescriptions that follow an employee for years to dynamic guidance that changes based on needs.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, a company that hired an employee for a certain set of tasks might find that four months later, a different set of tasks takes strategic priority. Even though that employee has the right skills for the new tasks, the employee can point to their job description to decline to do the new task by saying that it wasn&#39;t what they were hired to do — or, if they take on the new tasks, their job description becomes quickly out of date.&lt;/p>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;p>;This article is one in a series on “Creative Resilience: Leading in an Age of Discontinuity,” the theme of the 15th annual &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.druckerforum.org/&quot;>;Global Peter Drucker Forum.&lt;/a>; See the conference program &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.druckerforum.org/2023/program/&quot;>;here&lt;/a>;. &lt;/p>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;Because most job descriptions are firmly embedded in the employee&#39;s core area of work, they also tend to encourage silos in the organization by discouraging cross-functional collaboration. Rigid job descriptions also discourage experimentation with new technologies that may have been unimaginable at the time the description was written. And finally, narrow job descriptions can mean that an employee isn&#39;t able to fulfill the full range of their talents at work, leaving them dissatisfied.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In response, companies are starting to approach job descriptions in new, more flexible ways based on outcomes, skills, and teams. I&#39;ll describe each of these in turn, but first let&#39;s look at how job descriptions came to be what we know them as today, and what they do.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Why Job Descriptions?&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Modern job descriptions can be traced back to the industrial revolution. As factories and other large organizations became more common, there was a need to define roles and responsibilities more clearly to improve efficiency and productivity. This led to the creation of standardized job titles and descriptions, which outlined each position&#39;s tasks, duties, and requirements .&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;By the mid-20th century they became even more formalized and detailed.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Today, job descriptions are used for several purposes:&lt;/p>; &lt;ol>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Recruitment&lt;/strong>;: They help prospective applicants understand whether they would be a good fit for the position by providing a clear outline of what a role involves and what skills and qualifications are required.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Role clarification&lt;/strong>;: They help clarify the responsibilities, tasks, and expectations of a role, helping to avoid role ambiguity and conflict.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Performance management&lt;/strong>;: They serve as a benchmark for assessing employee performance.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;HR management&lt;/strong>;: They help plan employee development, set compensation, and serve as legal documentation.&lt;/li>; &lt;/ol>; &lt;p>;So how can job descriptions be made more flexible but still address these needs?&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;The More-Flexible Approaches&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;We&#39;re seeing three new approaches taking hold as companies grapple with rapidly-changing, project-based roles.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;&lt;strong>;Outcome-focused role descriptions&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Some companies are beginning to articulate the outcomes expected from a role rather than the specific tasks or duties the employee is required to perform. This approach provides flexibility for the employee to determine the best way to achieve those results, fostering innovation and initiative and, importantly, allowing them to change their approach as conditions shift.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For instance, instead of a sales manager&#39;s job description listing tasks such as “meet key clients once per quarter ” or “prepare sales reports on a monthly basis,” it would describe outcomes such as “increase regional sales by 15%” and “improve customer retention by 10%.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Google uses results-oriented job descriptions to keep their top talent motivated. Laszlo Bock, the former senior vice president of people operations, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Work-Rules-Insights-Inside-Transform/dp/1455554790&quot;>;explains&lt;/a>;:&amp;nbsp;“At Google, we believe that results-oriented job descriptions are essential for attracting and retaining top talent. When employees know what is expected of them and how they will be measured, they are more likely to be motivated and engaged in their work.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, traditionally, a design ethicist job description might have listed analyzing Google&#39;s search algorithm for bias once per month, or keeping a privacy risk log up to date. But in an outcomes-based job description, a design ethicist is instead given the broader mandate of identifying ethical risks in Google&#39;s products or developing guidelines for the ethical design of products. That gives both the employee and Google leeway for the specific tasks of the design ethicist to change as technologies develop — as generative AI is introduced into Google&#39;s offerings, for instance.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Skills-focused role descriptions&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Other companies create dynamic documents that outline the skills and capabilities an employee brings to a position or should aim to develop. With this approach, the emphasis shifts from the tasks a person is supposed to complete to their talents and how those can be applied within company projects.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For a company to execute on this approach means identifying the skills and qualifications needed for each role and developing training programs and career paths that help employees build those skills. The aim is to fully utilize and develop an individual&#39;s abilities and strengths, which can lead to increased job satisfaction as well as performance. It also means that companies can quickly assemble teams of people with the skills and experience needed to tackle specific projects or initiatives.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, a data analyst with superior visualization skills could seamlessly shift from creating complex data models to crafting visual reports, depending on project needs. The analyst would follow a specialized training regimen tailored to enhance specific skills, such as advanced visualization techniques and data storytelling. By focusing on the analyst&#39;s unique strengths and broader skill set, the organization not only hones their existing expertise but also creates a more well-rounded, versatile professional.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Team-based role descriptions&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Lastly, instead of giving each team member a job description, some companies assign individuals to teams that are given a collective set of objectives, outcomes, and deliverables. It is then up to the team to collectively decide how each member will contribute.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A well known example is Spotify, where employees are part of small, cross-functional teams called “squads,” each of which has a specific mission. Each squad autonomously decides how to meet its objectives best, relying on collective decision-making and their deep knowledge of each member&#39;s strengths and preferences. The teams meet frequently to discuss challenges, assess progress, realign goals, and resolve any conflicts or bottlenecks that result from the task distribution.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Overcoming Challenges&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Beyond simple resistance to change, there are a number of challenges that companies moving away from traditional job descriptions need to address.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The most basic is unclear job and performance expectations. Without a traditional job description, how does an employee know what is expected of them? How can a manager evaluate their performance objectively and follow fair compensation and promotion practices without clear guidelines in hand?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are other ways that managers can work with their teams to define roles and responsibilities and create a shared understanding of what each person is responsible for. For example, let&#39;s say you manage a team of software developers, and your company is shifting to team-based job descriptions. You might work with your team to create a skills matrix that identifies the skills and capabilities of each team member and then use tools like Agile methodology or Kanban boards to help manage workloads and prioritize tasks.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For recruitment, a competency-based interview process is a more effective way to assess a candidate&#39;s suitability for a flexible, dynamic role than a traditional interview, which often focuses on the candidate&#39;s experience and qualifications.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For performance evaluations, tools such as 360-degree feedback can help a manager to assess the employee&#39;s performance in various areas, including their skills, capabilities, and contributions to the team.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;More thorny issues can include legal compliance —such as Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) position status in the US — which can be challenging without a formal job description. Creating a “role compliance document” for each employee that provides a broad outline of the job and details such as job classification (exempt or non-exempt) can help here. Also, monitor employee tasks, responsibilities, and actual working hours to ensure that they align with&amp;nbsp;labor&amp;nbsp;guidelines; depending on your circumstances, this could be a periodic review or meticulous record-keeping enabled by modern HR software.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As organizations become more agile and responsive and technology enables new forms of work in the coming years, the trend towards project-based work and the need for more flexible job descriptions will continue. This radical disruption requires a shift in mindset and culture and asks individuals, managers, leaders, and organizations to experiment, learn, and adapt to new working methods. But with the right mindset and approach can lead to a more agile, responsive, and innovative organization better equipped to meet future challenges.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 06 Oct 2023 20:25:02 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Research: Can You Tell How You Come Across on Zoom?]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/10/research-can-you-tell-how-you-come-across-on-zoom]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/10/Oct23_04_-5082558_-6953835.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;HBR Staff/Pexels&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;If you want to make a good impression and gauge what a colleague actually thinks of you, should you meet in-person or over videoconference? This is the question the authors explored in their research. The answer largely depends on whether you&amp;#8217;re feeling anxious about the social interaction. Most of us &amp;#8212; even the most socially confident &amp;#8212; have moments when we feel a bit more socially anxious than usual. In those cases, setting a meeting on Zoom might level out the playing field, allowing you to be as aware of your impression as someone who is feeling more secure. In brief, Zoom might give everyone an equal opportunity to adequately manage the impression they want to convey, which has important implications for both team leaders and their employees.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/10/research-can-you-tell-how-you-come-across-on-zoom?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/10/research-can-you-tell-how-you-come-across-on-zoom?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;You just started a new job. You might be especially curious about your reputation around the office, and the impression you are making on your colleagues. Do people think you&#39;re intelligent and friendly? Inevitably, we all care about the way we come across to others.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One reason we care so much about what people think of us is that it sets the basis for impression management. For example, if you realize that your new colleague thinks you are incompetent during your first project meeting, this gives you the opportunity to correct that misperception, which could be done by highlighting how your unique skillset is relevant to the project you&#39;re working on together. Alternatively, if you miss that cue, you might not be able to manage their impression of you, and before you know it, your reputation in the workplace might crystallize.&amp;nbsp;In short, knowing the impressions we make on others is a key step in smoothly navigating our professional and social interactions.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Now that we&#39;re in a hybrid world, these interactions might be just as likely to take place over videoconference as they are in-person, and you might have the leeway to choose whether to meet virtually or face-to-face with a colleague. So, here are the questions we set out to answer with our research: If you want to gauge what a new colleague really thinks of you, which should you choose? Are you a better impression manager in-person or on Zoom?&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;The Research&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;In our &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fpspp0000457&quot;>;research&lt;/a>;, we tested which of these two assumptions prevailed. To do so, we had 305 people come into our lab before the Covid-19 pandemic (in groups of four to eight) and 555 people join a Zoom session during the pandemic (again, in small groups of three to nine). People would meet one on one with new people for a couple of minutes, just like at a speed-networking event. This resulted in a total of 1,683 unique in-person interactions and 3,068 unique Zoom interactions.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After each meeting, they reported on how they perceived each other&#39;s personalities. For example, they would be asked: “To what extent do you see this person as intelligent?” Importantly, we also asked them to rate how they think their interaction partner perceived them: “Does this person think I&#39;m intelligent?”&lt;/p>; &lt;article-promo>; &lt;hbr-component type=&quot;promo&quot; is-insight=&quot;insight-center&quot; title=&quot;The Future of Work&quot; dek=&quot;Will your company adapt or be left behind?&quot; cta-text=&quot;&quot; href=&quot;/insight-center/the-future-of-work&quot;>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/insight-center/the-future-of-work&quot; style=&quot;color:black ;text-decoration:none&quot;>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; 洞察中心集合 &lt;/div>; &lt;h3>;工作的未来&lt;/h3>; &lt;div>; 您的公司会适应还是被抛在后面？ &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hbr-component>; &lt;/article-promo>; &lt;p>;It turns out that people are good at knowing how they come across to others after just a two-minute interaction. Importantly, they are equally accurate about the first impression they make on Zoom as in-person. In both contexts, people could tell if their peer saw them as very intelligent and not so friendly. Put differently, our research suggests that people are able to know how they come across to a peer or a new acquaintance on Zoom to the same extent as in-person. In other words, interacting on Zoom does not seem to interfere with people&#39;s ability to know their reputations.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What&#39;s more, knowing the impression you make on Zoom related to being liked more by others, as it does in-person. In other words, knowing how you&#39;re coming across to someone else was equally socially beneficial in Zoom interactions as it was in-person. So, knowing others&#39; impressions of us on Zoom seems to operate in the same way and carry the same benefits as it does in-person.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;All in all, what does this mean for your next interaction with your new colleagues? Should you think twice before deciding to meet them on Zoom? Contrary to some of our lay beliefs, at least when it comes to impression management, the decision to videoconference (vs. meet in-person) might not bear dramatic consequences for most people. But is this true for everyone?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3260965/&quot;>;Research shows&lt;/a>; that people who feel more socially anxious feel more comfortable online than in person. By being more comfortable, they might be less worried and better able to gauge how they are coming across over Zoom. In fact, in our in-person&amp;nbsp;events, more socially anxious people were less aware of the impression they made (compared to more secure people). But on Zoom, this disadvantage disappeared: Both the more and less anxious people were equally aware of the impressions they made on others.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But does this mean that Zoom helps the socially anxious and hurts the secure? It seems that it&#39;s a mix of both. Zoom appeared to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ilr.cornell.edu/news/research/zooming-socially-anxious-research-offers-insights&quot;>;give a little boost to the socially anxious&lt;/a>;, allowing them to know how they were coming across, perhaps because they were more comfortable on Zoom or because they could monitor themselves with the self-view feature. But at the same time, Zoom hindered more secure people&#39;s ability to detect how they came across. Perhaps having the self-view feature made them feel self-conscious, which could have been distracting.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Coming back to our main question: Should you plan your next meeting on Zoom or in-person if you want to gauge what a colleague actually thinks of you? The answer to this question largely comes down to how you&#39;re feeling about the interaction and whether you&#39;re feeling anxious about it. Most of us — even the most socially confident — have moments when we feel a bit more socially anxious than usual. In those cases, setting a meeting on Zoom might level out the playing field, allowing you to be as aware of your impression as someone who is feeling more secure. In brief, Zoom might give everyone an equal opportunity to adequately manage the impression they want to convey. This has important implications for both team leaders and their employees.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;The Implications&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;If team leaders are aware that some team members might be feeling more socially anxious, maybe due to a specific context or personality style, it might be helpful to schedule a videoconference call instead of an in-person meeting.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is not to say that the long-term solution is to avoid in-person interactions. However, while working up the social confidence to more smoothly navigate face-to-face meetings, more socially anxious people might benefit from using Zoom once in a while — especially for first impressions.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Employees can now feel more at ease knowing that videoconferencing does not hurt their impression management abilities. This means that instead of spending energy worrying about whether people “get them” on Zoom, they can focus more on the content of the meeting and actively engage with the team&#39;s ideas — and in that way, ultimately make a better impression.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Overall then, especially if you are feeling more socially anxious, Zooming once in a while might just be the nudge you need to get back some control over your reputation around the office.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 05 Oct 2023 23:25:02 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
