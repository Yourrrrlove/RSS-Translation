&lt;span>;理查德·德鲁里/盖蒂图片社&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt; span>;总结。&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;行为改变很难，但想要在近乎持续的组织变革中取得成功的技能领导者需要培养。通过提高自我意识、致力于变革、克服限制性思维以及刻意实践新行为，领导者可以提高他们负责领导的变革举措取得成功的可能性。&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt; /div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/leading-change-may-need-to-begin-with-changing-yourself?language=es&quot;>;阅读en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/leading-change-may-need-to-begin-with-changing-yourself?language=pt&quot;>;葡萄牙语&lt;/a>; &lt; /div>; &lt;p>;组织变革要求领导者转向新的优先事项，委派旧的优先事项，并改变他们与团队互动的方式。然而，在过去 30 年的咨询、教学和指导过程中，我发现领导者常常很少关注他们将如何发展领导组织变革所需的具体行为，从而可能会破坏新计划。&lt;/p>; &lt;领导者首先会依赖那些让他们达到目前位置的行为，这是有道理的。但要成功领导变革，他们必须学会在需要发展自己的行为时认识到并采取行动。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Peter 失去了首席执行官的职位，因为他领导的转型项目没有取得成果。由于内奥米尝试改变新公司文化的时间比预期的要长，所以她没有得到晋升。由于他认为价值观不一致，优素福几乎离开了他整个职业生涯所效力的公司。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;每个人都以不同的方式解释了自己的次优经历。彼得说，他的国家糟糕的市场状况使公司的收入预测变得不可行。内奥米认为，她所在国家的热门就业市场导致她的团队人员流动率高于预期，从而减缓了文化变革。优素福将自己无法融入其中的原因归咎于与他共事的年轻一代领导者的交易价值观。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;然而，这三个人都没有意识到他们是如何造成自己的问题的。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; >; &lt;p>;为了取得成功，Peter 需要专注于减少组织效率低下，将收入留在他的销售主管手中。这种新的分工一直有效，直到他们失去了一笔重大交易。这促使彼得再次涉足销售，减少了他对效率低下的关注，该组织在销售和效率目标上都落后了。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;内奥米被聘请来改变她的新团队的文化，从官僚主义、订单填写心态转变为敏捷、响应客户的心态。她知道她只能通过倾听并缓解团队对这些变化的担忧来做到这一点。然而，面对高流动率，她的耐心消失了，她恢复了更具指导性的领导地位，导致了更多的流动率。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;优素福在公司担任了区域经理的职位，以更接近他的大家庭。此前，他曾在该公司担任过更高级的全球职位。他并不介意较低的薪酬，并感谢公司给予他灵活性。然而，他并没有停下来思考他需要如何与比他更年轻、经验更少的新上司相处。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;改变行为是一个过程&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Peter、Naomi 、优素福都没有注意到他们需要如何改变自己的行为。彼得和内奥米需要做出改变才能成功执行转型项目。优素福需要适应新角色。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;改变行为可能很困难，任何尝试过的人都可以证明这一点。本文概述了一个四步流程，可帮助您在需要时改变自己的行为。我在我的私人实践和多个执行计划中成功地与领导者和团队一起使用了这一点。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;第 1 步：提高自我意识&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;领导者只能在以下情况下改变自己的行为：他们知道其他人如何看待这一点，以及他们在尝试改变时所经历的想法和感受。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;彼得没有意识到他的董事会建议他关注成本效率，因为他们认为他是销售过程中的瓶颈。如果他知道的话，他可能会重新考虑重返销售岗位。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;失业让彼得感到震惊。 “我不想再发生这种事，”他在考虑未来的工作机会时对我说。 “当情况好的时候，我常常要求我的团队对我的行为提供反馈。当事情变得艰难时，我停了下来。我告诉自己我太忙了。也许我不想听到我潜意识里知道他们会对我说的话。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;彼得对自我意识做出了两个重要的观察。首先，领导者需要定期寻求人们对他们的看法的反馈，而不是将其交给外部环境。其次，他们需要警惕那些表明反馈是不必要或不适当的想法和感受。注意到这些想法是克服它们的第一步。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;第二步：做出承诺&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;虽然意识到他人如何看待我们本身就可以成为改变的催化剂（因此有句话“最重要的”）变革的强大驱动力是一面镜子”），向他人做出承诺会增加成功的可能性。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当娜奥米得知自己不会升职时，她面​​临着一个选择。她可以寻找另一份工作，也可以留下来，更好地推动文化变革，并希望在未来得到晋升。她选择了后者。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;内奥米觉得自己因为过度害怕“浪费时间”而没有仔细聆听就匆匆提出解决方案。她需要帮助才能更多地倾听。因此，她向她的直接下属做出了公开承诺。 “我保证会更多地倾听，”她说。 “我认为这将帮助我们更有效地做出改变。但我需要你的帮助。”她要求她的团队在她不听话时叫她出来。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在接下来的几周里，当她感到有转向解决问题的冲动时，对她的承诺的记忆经常会抑制她。当她无意中提出解决方案时，她的团队成员微笑着回应说：“你说过你会听的！”&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;第 3 步：克服干扰​​&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;尽管有可信的改变意图，当领导者遇到偏离其意图的想法时，他们可能会陷入困境。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Youssef 的新国家经理职位比他之前的全球营销职位低了两级。在接受这份工作之前，他会见了新老板并讨论了他们如何合作。但他没有预料到他对新同事批评他之前制定的政策的反应。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;他的老板批评了公司要求所有地区销售新产品的政策，称这不符合要求。反映他们所在地区的现实。优素福的反应是防御性的，因为他之前曾推动过这项政策。 “总部了解地区之间的差异，”他回答道，“但他们仍然需要激励新产品的销售。否则，各地区可能无法充分推广这些具有潜在价值的产品。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;他的老板和同事觉得优素福居高临下地对他们说话。他们正在努力在价格高度敏感的地区销售昂贵的新产品，并认为优素福可以提供更多支持。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但优素福的反应受到了他几乎没有注意到的想法的影响。 “我曾在总部工作过，比你更了解公司战略，”其中之一。 “你怎么敢说我们的政策是轻率的，”另一个人说道。这些想法就隐藏在他的意识表面之下，干扰了他提供支持的愿望，并引发了无效的防御性反应。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我向 Youssef 介绍了 ACT，一种基于正念的认知疗法，并向他展示了如何可以“化解”他的想法。一个简单的方法是闭上眼睛，想象你正在看着一个想法，就好像它出现在你面前的屏幕上一样。最能触动优素福的想法似乎是“我比你更了解这家公司的价值观。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;通过消除这种想法和相关的想法，优素福能够在激怒他的评论和他的反应之间建立差距。 ，使对话更加富有成效。优素福发现自己从差点想要辞职，转而变成了年轻同事的导师，这些年轻同事希望从他在总部的经历中学习——这一切都要归功于减轻他以前几乎没有注意到的想法的影响。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;第 4 步：实践&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;领导者很少发现他们可以毫无困难地设定个人变革目标、选择路径并执行。成功的变革通常来自于反复试验，而这需要刻意的练习。当领导者有意识地进行小的、需要的改变，从经验中学习，而不是着眼于所有需要的改变的大爆炸时，他们会做得更好。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;内奥米知道，倾听她的团队的意见只是几种新行为之一她需要收养。她还需要停止微观管理，更多地授权，并为她的团队提供更大的代理权。她知道她会发现这些行为很困难，因此她会定期练习一些小改变。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;她可能会在团队会议开始时快速讨论团队成员希望提出的问题，或者询问团队成员代替她主持会议。这些小小的变化不仅让她有机会了解团队如何运作，还让她了解她会如何反应。随着时间的推移，Naomi 和她的团队逐渐形成了一种更有利于公司希望看到的文化变革的工作模式。&lt;/p>; &lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;。 。 .&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;行为改变很难，但领导者想要在近乎持续的组织变革中取得成功，需要培养一种技能。通过提高自我意识、致力于变革、克服限制性思维以及刻意实践新行为，领导者可以提高他们负责领导的变革举措取得成功的可能性。&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- 引用 -- >; &lt;/div>;

&lt;span>;&lt;p>;当今的领导者知道他们需要敏捷&amp;#8212;面对变化或不确定的情况迅速改变方向。但敏捷性的副产品是流失：许多此类枢轴所带来的混乱和消极情绪。这可能会导致效率低下，从而阻碍创新项目和战略。作者建议领导者应该设定并传达一个不变的总体目标，同时允许他们实现该目标的方式可以并且将会随着时间的推移而改变。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&amp;#160;&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&amp;#160;&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/how-to-avoid-the-churn-that-c​​omes-with-agility?language=es&quot;>;阅读 zh西班牙语&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/how-to-avoid-the-churn-that-c​​omes-with-agility?language=pt&quot;>;葡萄牙语&lt;/a>; &lt;/ div>; &lt;p>;当今最受赞誉的领导特质之一是转变能力——当计划的道路受阻或发现不利时迅速改变方向。这种快速适应，通常被称为&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbescoachescouncil/2018/06/29/what-does-it-mean-to-be-an-agile -leader/?sh=3e2ad9214db4&quot;>;敏捷性&lt;/a>;，在快速变化的环境中或在旧行为和管理实践不再有效的未知领域进行创新时至关重要。有些人认为这是一种领导力&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/tonygambill/2022/02/16/agility-is-a-superpower-how-great-leaders-assess-challenges -and-adapt-for-success/?sh=1338e8673759&quot;>;超级权力&lt;/a>;。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;然而，任何领导力超级权力都可能成为弱点。当领导者频繁改变项目方向时，他们的员工可能会对他们应该做什么感到困惑（或者至少需要花时间重新规划和解决变革），从而导致效率低下和流失并阻碍进展。这也会让人失去动力：这就像告诉某人向北跑，然后向南跑，然后向北，然后再向南跑。在多次改变方向后，员工的明智之举是保持原地不动，直到领导者弄清楚。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这个问题的解决方案不能简单地“降低敏捷性”。在这些情况下，面对快速变化的环境和高度的不确定性，领导者基本上都在做正确的事情。他们不会坚持走一条可能导致死胡同或浪费公司时间和资源的道路，而是将团队转向他们认为更有生产力的方向，然后在必要时一次又一次地这样做。&lt; /p>; &lt;p>;根据我多年为企业提供创新和效率咨询的经验，我相信，为了应对这些变化的负面影响，领导者通过转型引导团队应该更好地区分&lt;em>;手段&lt;/em>;和&lt; em>;结束&lt;/em>;：他们应该能够阐明一个最终目标，即使实现目标的手段发生变化，该目标也保持不变。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;让我们看两个例子。在我建议的一家科技企业中，创始人通过大量实验和即兴创作创造了他的核心产品，尝试了一项又一项，直到弄清楚什么是有效的。然而，随着公司发展到拥有 100 多名工程师和多个项目团队，所有项目团队均以原始产品设计为基础，创始人不断即兴创作和改变方向的愿望更多地成为一种负担，而不是一种优势。一位经理将这种效果描述为一种瘫痪，每个人都只是等待下一条指令。 “没有人愿意采取任何主动行动，”她说，“因为无论我们做什么都可能会改变。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这种过度敏捷的动态对于小型初创公司和大公司来说都是一个问题。几年前，我与一家价值数十亿美元的个人护理公司合作，该公司进行了三项中型收购，以实现产品组合多元化。由于这些收购中的每一项都包含知名品牌，首席执行官计划让它们作为全资但独立的实体运营。但几个月后，在董事会要求从收购中获取更多协同价值的压力下，他改变了方针，要求公司职能部门（人力资源、财务等）将被收购实体的流程和系统与被收购实体的流程和系统保持一致。核心公司。但事实证明，让公司所有职能部门的人员涌入被收购的公司会造成破坏，因此他后来退缩了，并告诉公司职能部门只选择一两个系统进行标准化。此时，被收购实体的管理者完全不知道其所有者真正想要什么，并告诉员工在事情变得清晰之前不要采取任何行动。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在此处引用的两个案例中，以及在许多其他过度敏捷的情况下，领导者过于关注实现目标的手段，以至于他们（及其团队）失去了对最终结果的关注。在这家科技初创公司中，创始人希望通过实验揭示新产品的机会，但没有明确说明他对下一代产品的愿景。在缺乏清晰的产品愿景的情况下，所有可能性都是有效的。同样，在个人护理公司，首席执行官从未阐明整合新收购公司的总体目标。事实上，他似乎是一边做一边弥补，并根据投资者、团队和被收购公司经理的反应改变目标。难怪这会在需要执行的人员中产生混乱。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这里的好消息是，一旦领导者意识到，过度关注“手段”而忽视“目的”的情况是可以纠正的这就是正在发生的事情。这是目标设定和沟通的问题。在这家科技公司，创始人最终从他的团队收到了强烈的反馈，即不断的工程变化意味着团队不确定他们应该做什么。作为回应，他与团队合作，为下一个产品的外观创建参数，然后给团队留出更多空间来弄清楚如何实现这一目标。如今，团队的工作效率更高，并且对他们正在开发具有商业可行性的新产品充满信心。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在个人护理公司，首席执行官意识到公司没有达到预期目标考虑到收购的投资回报率，要求业务发展负责人对公司应该如何整合新公司做了一个简短的研究。一个关键结论是，收购后的每个实体都应该有一个更具体的目标和愿景，然后整合团队将有权找到实现该目标的正确途径。此方法随后应用于这三起收购中。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;例如，其中一家被收购公司在特定产品类别中拥有强大的市场份额和品牌知名度，因此团队制定的目标是加速该类别的发展生长。然而，在整合过程的早期，团队意识到，如果他们继续强迫每个人都遵循新所有者的流程和方法，他们将面临失去收购带来的大部分人才的危险。这将使增长目标陷入危险，因为该团队的经验对于该类别的成功是必要的。于是他们改变了方向：他们没有将收购并入母公司，而是采取了“反向收购”的方式，即母公司的一些人员向被收购公司的管理团队汇报。但最终目标——在核心类别中取得更大成功——保持不变。经理们不再感到困惑或士气低落，最终这个新部门超出了早期设想的增长预期。&lt;/p>; &lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;。 。 .&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;如果你正在参与一个项目，或者正在领导一个项目，而这个项目似乎经常因为改变路线而被打乱，那么请退后一步，问以下问题：我们是否清楚我们的最终目标——我们需要实现的结果——我们是否觉得我们的改变让我们更接近这个目标？如果答案不是明确的“是”，那么您可能需要更好地定义和传达您的目标，以便您的敏捷性不会妨碍您的效率。&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;埃里克·范罗苏姆&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;感谢您招待我；我很高兴能谈论这一切对中型公司意味着什么。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Julie Devoll&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div id=&quot;DFP_IC_pos3&quot;>; &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;>;if (isAdobeSync()) googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(&quot;DFP_IC_pos3&quot;); });&lt;/script>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/ div>; &lt;p>;首先，让 CFO 彻夜难眠的问题是什么？&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Eric van Rossum&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;好问题。归根结底，是什么让首席财务官彻夜难眠，全天都在讨论各种话题，最重要的是什么？首席财务官处境艰难。我们正处于低增长、通货膨胀的经济环境中。但利益相关者和股东仍然期望收入增长。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;首席财务官们在思考：“在这个动荡和不确定的经济中，如何制定正确的战略和路线图以实现增长？”从这个角度来看，他们面临着一些挑战。首先，当事情难以预测时，他们需要创建可靠的财务预测和模型。其次，需要确保有足够的资本来支持增长战略以及日常运营，随着利率的上升，这意味着对不同的金融工具、机会成本进行更有针对性的审查和时间范围。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;朱莉·德沃尔&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;中型企业的财务领导者如何利用云 ERP 等技术来管理当今的需求？而且，推动未来的增长？&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Eric van Rossum&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我认为有三件事：第一，云 ERP 不仅限于这一刻。二、云ERP让企业走上持续创新之路。最后，第三点，Cloud ERP 提供标准化。&lt;/p>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div id=&quot;DFP_IC_pos4&quot;>; &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;>;if (isAdobeSync()) googletag.cmd.push( function() { googletag.display(&quot;DFP_IC_pos4&quot;); });&lt;/script>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;让我们从第一点开始，Cloud ERP 不受限制到某个时刻。 S/4HANA Cloud 公共版等解决方案将与您一起成长。它们允许公司在发展过程中采用所需的能力。特别是对于中型公司来说，他们可以从今天运营所需的基本要素开始，然后从那里开始构建。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;速度就是游戏的名称。这是关于在两到三个月内上线并从那里迭代。这就引出了第二点——云 ERP 让公司踏上了持续创新的旅程。公司可以利用季度创新周期来部署新功能。这就是我们今天定期交付软件的方式。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;最后，还有标准化。中型企业将通过云 ERP 获得与大型竞争对手相同的经过时间考验的流程，无需昂贵的定制。 SAP 因定义 ERP 行业最佳实践而闻名，我们也致力于定义下一代 ERP 最佳实践。正如我所提到的，客户可以开箱即用，根据这些行业最佳实践快速实现价值。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;朱莉·德沃尔&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;您已经提到组织的财务和会计团队如何在确保今天和明天的增长和弹性方面发挥带头作用。但是，财务部门可以做些什么来获得最有力的社会和环境成果呢？&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Eric van Rossum&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;对于财务领导者来说，他们可以做三件事。首先，也是最重要的一点，了解他们的角色。财务领导者在推动社会和环境成果方面发挥着关键作用。他们将成为管家和决策者，帮助制定业务目标和 KPI，无论是碳核算还是围绕社会承诺、多样性、包容性或环境影响的关键指标。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;其次，他们可以以身作则，将可持续发展纳入围绕财务规划的讨论中，带来他们在财务和会计方面众所周知的严谨性，并将其应用于 ESG 要求和全公司控制。第三，他们可以合作和协作。随着 ESG 要求在全球范围内从自愿演变为强制性，标准化和透明度是必要的。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当公司与自身标准内外志同道合的组织进行协作和合作时，这将发挥最佳作用。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;朱莉·德沃尔&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;埃里克，今天您想对我们的观众说些什么吗？&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;埃里克范罗森&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当然。在 SAP，我们在支持为可持续发展带来更多标准化的努力方面发挥着非常积极的作用。我们最近宣布计划引入所谓的绿色账本，这是基于账本的碳核算。公司可以管理进入和离开其系统的碳排放，并平衡其对社会和环境的责任，即“碳账簿”，就像我们处理财务账簿一样。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;ERP 一直是企业的记录系统。金融，并通过这个绿色分类账，我们正在努力使其成为可持续发展的记录系统。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;朱莉·德沃尔&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;埃里克，这个这是一次很棒的谈话。非常感谢您今天加入我们。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Eric van Rossum&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;同样。我非常喜欢它，希望很快能再次与您交谈。&lt;/p>; &lt;hr>; &lt;p>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ad.doubleclick.net/ddm/trackclk/N69702.124507HBRHARVARDBUSINESSR/B29173838.375511754 ;dc_trk_aid=566807122;dc_trk_cid=189409904;dc_lat=;dc_rdid=;tag_for_child_directed_treatment=;tfua=;ltd=;dc_tdv=1&quot;>;&lt;strong>;&lt;em>;了解更多。&lt;/em>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/a>;

&lt;p>;但随着身份验证工具变得越来越重要，它也将变得同样重要让任何需要它们的人都可以使用它们。数百万人无法使用数字工具。如果他们无法在线验证自己的身份，他们就会被排除在外。寻找更多方法为小型企业提供身份验证并为消费者提供数字身份，将为数百万人提供更多机会，并使数字经济更具活力、更具包容性和更安全。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这就是我们的愿景 - 使用这项技术使数字经济像当地农贸市场或咖啡店一样充满活力和热情。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;什么是身份验证？&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;其核心，身份验证工具可证明您的信息（姓名、地址、年龄、电话号码）有效且与您相关联。 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/361924724_What_is_a_Digital_Identity_Wallet_A_Systematic_Literature_Review&quot;>;许多不同的技术&lt;/a>;可用于实现这一目标。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;最常见的技术之一是身份验证验证软件，正如我之前提到的。例如，它可用于验证电子商务网站上的购买情况。该软件可证明您的 ID 正在使用您的登录名、密码和设备 IP 地址等数据，而无需您输入任何新信息。例如，Mastercard Identity 与旅游网站 FlightHub 合作，实时评估数百万笔在线预订，并与 Greenwood Bank 合作，确保吸引真正的客户。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;该技术的其他形式包括智能 ID 卡，内置芯片的物理卡可以存储您的身份证或医疗信息。您的手机上还可以保存驾驶执照或护照的数字版本。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;最后，Apple ID 和 Google Identity 等 ID 管理系统提供了一组您可以使用的登录凭据许多网站和服务。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;许多国家政府都大力依赖这项技术来实现服务现代化和数字化。最先进的国家之一是&lt;a href=&quot;https://e-estonia.com/solutions/e-identity/smart-id/&quot;>;爱沙尼亚&lt;/a>;，它为每个公民提供国家发行的电子身份证他们可以使用物理智能卡、移动应用程序或网站访问身份。这些电子身份证可用于购物、支付账单、签署合同、访问医疗记录，甚至在线投票。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;新加坡的 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.smartnation.gov.sg/initiatives /strategic-national-projects/national-digital-identity/&quot;>;Singpass&lt;/a>; 国民身份证应用程序可让人们连接到政府服务和许多企业。 It uses a biometric thumbprint or face verification, enabling people to verify their identities across all kinds of digital activities, including banking, food delivery and insurance.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another major player in this space is India, which runs the world&#39;s largest digital ID platform, called &lt;a href=&quot;https://uidai.gov.in/en/&quot;>;Aadhaar&lt;/a>;. Citizens can share their ID information using a QR code, which is kept in a mobile app, or on the back of a physical paper or plastic card. Millions of people in India have used Aadhaar to open new accounts with banks and mobile phone providers, accessing digital services that before were out of reach for them.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Mastercard works with both India and Singapore to secure these ID systems, making sure people&#39;s data is protected.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;A Path Toward Digital Inclusion&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;As we&#39;re seeing in India, ID verification has quickly become a powerful tool to spread digital and financial inclusion. Once someone can share their secure and authenticated identity in a digital space, many more opportunities can open for them. There is still a huge need to do more, with &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.worldbank.org/digital-development/850-million-people-globally-dont-have-id-why-matters-and-what-we-can-do-about&quot;>;850 million people globall&lt;/a>;y without any formal IDs — digital or otherwise.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One small but promising effort to increase access to ID tools is happening in Austin, Texas. There, researchers at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statesman.com/story/news/healthcare/2021/05/10/austin-ut-dell-medical-school-help-homeless-health-care-services/4933352001/&quot;>;Dell Medical School&lt;/a>; are developing a new platform to help people experiencing homelessness get their identities back.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In many cases, these people have their physical IDs stolen, making it difficult for them to access basic services, like government aid and medication. It also results in them getting misdiagnosed repeatedly when going to hospitals, since providers don&#39;t have their medical histories and often have to start from scratch during each visit.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Dell Medical team created a way for people to verify their IDs using their phones&#39; biometrics — like a thumbprint. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/315541163_No_Digital_Divide_Technology_Use_among_Homeless_Adults#:~:text=%5D.%20...-,...,past%203%20months%20%5B29%5D%20.&quot;>;Researchers have noted&lt;/a>; that most homeless people in the US have smartphones, using them as critical tools to access the resources they need and stay connected to friends and family.) Their IDs can be accessed online or on their phones, with the data stored using a decentralized blockchain ledger so it can&#39;t be lost or hacked. Critically, it&#39;s the users who control their data and must explicitly consent to sharing it.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This project is still in development but points to the promise of identity verification for broader social benefit.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Potential Pitfalls&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;The technology is, of course, only part of the story.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;While ID tools are widely adopted in many parts of the world, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aclu.org/news/privacy-technology/digital-ids-might-sound-like-a-good-idea-but-they-could-be-a-privacy-nightmare&quot;>;some worry certain forms&lt;/a>; of digital ID, like a virtual version of your driver&#39;s license, could result in all your interactions and transactions being logged and monitored without your consent.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As is always the case with valuable personal information, many have also raised concerns about creating one centralized place where all your ID and health data can be stored, creating an enticing target for hackers.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It&#39;s imperative that ID verification is used to empower people and build trust in the digital economy — not erode it. The best way to do that is by making sure security, transparency, and consumer privacy are at the heart of these technologies. We need to ensure people can control their data and approve access to it. Directing ID tools in the right way, we can make sure consumers and small businesses have trust in both sides of a digital interaction.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It&#39;s also important to demystify what ID verification is and how it&#39;s used. Estonia and Singapore&#39;s ID system have been around for 20 years, and India&#39;s started 14 years ago. The 3D secure authentication standard for credit and debit card transactions is even older, coming out in 1999. This technology has proven its value over decades.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;ID verification can be used to increase privacy, not take it away. For instance, if someone needed to confirm their age to buy alcohol, they wouldn&#39;t need to share all the information on a typical driver&#39;s license — name, age, address, photo. Using ID verification technology, confirmation would exist as a simple yes or no question — is this person older than 21 or not? And that&#39;s the only information someone would need to share.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;A Look to the Future&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;We&#39;ve all seen the benefits of ID software during the pandemic — enabling commerce to continue even when merchants couldn&#39;t see their customers face-to-face anymore. Continuing to hone this technology will help businesses grow, and ultimately build resilience for people and communities, helping them withstand the next crisis.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The work to build this technology continues because so many of us see that promise. Much more is possible and much more is already happening.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 19 Sep 2023 22:25:01 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[It&rsquo;s Time for a New Model for Operations Management]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/09/its-time-for-a-new-model-for-operations-management]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/09/Sep23_19_1501201096.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;MirageC/Getty Images&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;Covid-19 was the death knell for traditional hierarchical command-and-control operations management. In its place a new model has emerged that&amp;#8217;s far better equipped to deal with today&amp;#8217;s disruptive, volatile, and unpredictable environment. In this model, decision-making responsibility is broadly dispersed to where it makes the most sense, resulting in faster, more accurate decisions in response to changing conditions. This model is built on four pillars &amp;#8212; trust, talent, transparency, and technology. Swiss multinational food and drink processing conglomerate Nestl&amp;#233; is an example of a company that has embraced this concept in its factories and, as a result, has built a resilient operational model that has helped the company effectively respond to adverse events and challenges.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/its-time-for-a-new-model-for-operations-management?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/its-time-for-a-new-model-for-operations-management?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;Is the traditional command-and-control operations management model — which reigned supreme for decades in an era of relative stability and predictability — finally dead? All the signs we see say it is. In a post-pandemic world characterized by unpredictable supply and demand, companies can no longer consolidate decision-making at the top. Doing so is counter to the kind of agility, flexibility, and speed they need in a world of rapid and chronic disruption and volatility.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;While it&#39;s been slowly eroding for years, we saw the command-and-control model&#39;s final unravelling during Covid. Amidst the chaos and volatility of the pandemic disruptions, companies were forced to loosen the decision-making reins. They had to, if they wanted to survive. When basic goods were suddenly flying off the shelves without warning, and supplies of critical raw materials and components were quickly drying up, there simply was no time for operations managers to gather data, analyze it, and then tell the operations teams how to respond. Companies just had to act, with the best information they had, and the right people to make those decisions were those closest to the action.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These shifts presaged the emergence of a new operations management model, in which the goal is to optimize how accurately and quickly operations responds to threats and opportunities by dispersing decision-making to the points in the organization where it makes the most sense for them to be made.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, strategic decisions with cross-functional or cross-enterprise implications and long-term impacts — such as allocating capital, relocating a factory, redesigning a product, or entering a new market — are best made by those who can focus on the big picture and broader horizon. Responsibility for more tactical decisions — in sourcing, logistics, manufacturing, and distribution — is driven elsewhere into the organization to the most logical point — ie, “where the rubber meets the road.”&lt;/p>; &lt;article-promo>; &lt;hbr-component type=&quot;promo&quot; is-insight=&quot;insight-center&quot; title=&quot;The New Age of Operations&quot; dek=&quot;Improving efficiency and increasing resilience.&quot; cta-text=&quot;&quot; href=&quot;/insight-center/the-new-age-of-operations&quot;>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/insight-center/the-new-age-of-operations&quot; style=&quot;color:black;text-decoration:none&quot;>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; Insight Center Collection &lt;/div>; &lt;h3>;The New Age of Operations&lt;/h3>; &lt;div>; Improving efficiency and increasing resilience. &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hbr-component>; &lt;/article-promo>; &lt;p>;Social and government organizations call this &lt;em>;subsidiarity&lt;/em>;, which is the principle that social and political issues should be dealt with at the most immediate or local level that is consistent with their resolution.&amp;nbsp;In operations, this means, for example, closest to where raw materials are allocated as inputs, where products are made, and where finished goods are shipped from the factory to the distribution center — points where the most accurate and relevant information needed to make the best decisions resides. Dispersing operations decision-making in this way is key to a company&#39;s ability to respond rapidly and appropriately to disruptions and changes in the business environment.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is a profound shift for most companies, large or small. Operations leaders who are used to having control must stop trying to micromanage and firefight. They need to loosen the reins and empower others to deviate from the existing plan or targets if conditions have changed. Operators who used to look to their bosses for instructions and direction must get comfortable assuming much greater responsibility and accountability for what happens in the company. With disruptions coming so fast, there&#39;s no time to escalate issues to get guidance on how to react to them. At the same time, operators need to be clear on what decisions they can make for themselves and when and where they should seek support.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Key Enablers to Fuel the Shift&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Making this model work requires four vital enablers. Each of these must be in place for leaders and operators to both embrace their new roles and execute at the highest level. The absence of any one of them will make a successful transition impossible.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;1. Trust&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Trust is the bedrock of this model. Leaders must trust that the people to whom they&#39;re delegating decision-making are capable of making, and will make, the best decisions for the company. At the same time, operators must understand which issues to escalate and how. They must also trust that when they run into trouble, they won&#39;t be on the chopping block for making a bold decision to change plans when the signals told them that it was the right thing to do.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;2. Talent&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Giving people the freedom to make decisions and act isn&#39;t enough. For people to feel comfortable taking on decision-making, they need skills and capabilities they may not have needed (or had) before. These include analytical thinking, contemporary market intelligence, digital and data expertise, logic and reasoning, and soft skills such as interpersonal communications, and the ability to convincingly defend one&#39;s decisions. Therefore, a robust education and learning effort must accompany decision-making empowerment.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;3. Transparency&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Leaders need access to information to understand what&#39;s happening in their organization and with their people, while operators need all the relevant data to understand the impact of their decisions and actions. In both cases, clarity on the right metrics, linked to specific outcomes the company desires, is critical.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;4. Technology&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Technology provides transparency — it enables a company to gather and disseminate the information leaders and operators need to do their jobs well. Additionally, powerful AI tools can provide insights to decision-makers at all levels, acting as a coach or co-pilot and, in some cases, making certain decisions on their own with oversight from humans. And, in a learning setting, technology is critical to helping people build the new skills and capabilities they need to be successful with their new responsibilities.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Nestl&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;é&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;&#39;s Experience with Its Operator-Centric Organization&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Trust, talent, transparency, and technology are at the heart of what Nestlé calls the “operator-centric organization,” which focuses on three things: &lt;em>;empowerment&lt;/em>; (giving people the freedom to make decisions and act); &lt;em>;engagement&lt;/em>; (providing the tools, data, and information needed to make good decisions and see the results); and &lt;em>;enablement&lt;/em>; (providing skill- and capability-building so people can appropriately use the information they get to make the right decisions).&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 60 Nestlé factories, operators have iPads through which they can scan a code on a piece of equipment and see all data relating to it, including safety features and performance. They can also control some elements of the equipment from the iPad. This gives operators a true sense of ownership of their equipment, just as a dashboard on a car gives drivers a feeling of being in control of the vehicle. Nestlé also uses the same device to provide skill building, giving operators access to the training and information they need to continually enhance their capabilities. Nestlé plans to deploy this approach throughout its 350 factories globally.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;With the operator-centric organization model, Nestlé has effectively created “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdi-ama.biz/about/&quot;>;mission-directed work teams&lt;/a>;,” a concept introduced by Competitive Dynamics International. These are not truly independent teams, but rather teams that understand the boundaries in which they can make decisions. Operators, for example, are aware of the limits to what they can decide on their own and when they need to refer something to the line manager or team leader. Factory managers know when and where they need to contact the technical manager who is head of all the factories in a specific geography.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For the operator-centric model at Nestlé to work, everyone also must embrace the same culture and values within the factory. Of course, the social and emotional culture of each factory&#39;s country or region may differ because Nestlé has factories around the world. But it&#39;s important for the company&#39;s people to understand that when they enter the factory, the same business culture and values are present in every facility — whether it&#39;s in South Africa, Malaysia, or Switzerland. In this way, that factory still benefits from Nestlé&#39;s values of transparency and honesty without forcing employees to do things that are inconsistent with how they behave normally in their day-to-day lives.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Building Next-Generation Operations Management for a New World&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;The environment in which companies operate has clearly changed — and that has put the final nail in the coffin of command-and-control operations management. With companies needing to be quicker not only to react, but to anticipate, it&#39;s time for a new operational model—built on trust, talent, transparency, and technology — that can enable them to accelerate decision-making, respond more effectively to disruptions and unforeseen events, and continue to be regenerative by organically adjusting and reinventing themselves as the world around them evolves.&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400; &quot;>;与上级建立联系的最有效方法之一是通过越级会议。简而言之，越级会议是您和老板的老板之间的一对一会议。这是一个与您可能没有经常接触或互动的上级直接沟通的机会。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;

/a>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>; 他们担心浪费高级领导的时间或被认为“太努力了”。这些担忧都是有道理的。处理与经理的经理的关系需要微妙的平衡。越界，你可能会被视为绕过了你的直接主管。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;所以请小心行事。在您安排越级之前，请考虑您的工作场所文化以及人们如何看待此类请求。它会受到欢迎——还是被视为威胁？一些公司鼓励开放式沟通，而另一些公司可能有更多的等级结构。反思过去的互动和&lt;/span>;&lt;a href=&quot;/2023/07/overcoming-your-fear-of-giving-tough-feedback&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;反馈&lt;/ span>;&lt;/a>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>; 来自您的主管。他们之前是否鼓励您采取主动，或者是否建议您采取更加谨慎的做法？这可以深入了解他们如何看待您的请求。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;b>;让您的老板参与进来。&lt;/b>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400; &quot;>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;如果您确实继续，透明度是关键。选择一个您和您的直接主管可以进行坦诚对话的私人时间。解释为什么您认为越级会议对您和整个团队都有好处。也许可以分享它将如何帮助您做出明智的决策，减少来回的次数，或避免最后一刻出现意外而占用宝贵的时间和资源。强调你的目的不是要削弱或绕过你的经理，而是要增强你自己的理解以及与组织的一致性。您的老板会很高兴了解您请求背后的动机。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;向您的老板提出诸如“您建议我如何最大限度地利用时间？”之类的问题。 ”或“您认为有哪些具体主题适合我介绍？”表明您尊重他们的专业知识，并将该请求视为一项协作努力。如果你的老板表示保留或建议等待更合适的时机，请倾听。他们可能对职场政治有你不知道的见解。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;b>;定义你的目标。&lt;/b>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;高管们很忙，你最不想做的就是毫无准备地不尊重越级的时间。因此，请提前定义您的目标。澄清期望？列出你目前的理解并请求肯定或更正。寻求指导？概述您面临的具体挑战或机遇、您倾向于的解决方案，并询问他们过去如何处理类似情况。呈现信息？分享清晰、简洁的摘要，并根据高管的兴趣定制数据，重点关注影响和结果。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;b>;准备有力的问题。&lt;/b>;&lt;span style=&quot; font-weight: 400;&quot;>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;无论您想从对话中得到什么，您的主要工作是听。遵循 70/30 规则：你的目标是在 30% 的时间里发言，同时允许你老板的老板在 70% 的时间里发言。通过更多地倾听，您可以利用他们的经验和见解，并且可以更轻松地发现不明显的细微差别。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;另外，您的沟通必须简洁且有目的。你的演讲时间更多地是关于提出正确的问题——展示你的战略思维并获得清晰度的问题。例如：&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot; aria-level=&quot;1&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;从您的角度来看，您认为我们团队应该解决的最重大挑战是什么？&lt;/span>;&lt;/li>;

&lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;花时间和精力投资向上的关系，例如与越级经理的关系，需要策略、谦逊和勤奋。 After all, leadership is not only about managing those below you, but also navigating the complexities above.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;

&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/6-actions-ceos-must-take-during-a-cyberattack?language=es&quot;>;阅读 zh西班牙语&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/6-actions-ceos-must-take-during-a-cyberattack?language=pt&quot;>;葡萄牙语&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;2021 年 5 月 7 日，一个致命的星期五早晨，为美国东部运营重要燃料供应管道的 Colonial Pipeline 公司遭遇了勒索软件攻击。政府不知道的是，该公司决定关闭管道运营，因为他们试图确定发生了什么以及损失有多严重。此举产生了严重后果，在短短几天内将网络事件转变为更广泛的危机。数千个加油站&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/05/12/gas-shortage-colonial-pipeline-live-updates/&quot;>;燃料耗尽&lt;/a>; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/05/12/gas-shortage-colonial-pipeline-live-updates/&quot;>;天然气价格&lt;/a>;升至近来最高水平十年。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;运营的停止扰乱了燃料供应链，导致多个州的加油站出现恐慌性购买和随后的短缺。有关加油站排长队和价格飞涨的报道说明了网络威胁对现实世界的影响，强调了我们的物理和数字基础设施的相互依赖。这也加剧了公众对加油站的挤兑。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;针对不断升级的局势，美国政府&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/ 2021/05/11/情况说明书-拜登哈里斯政府已启动全政府努力解决殖民管道事件/&quot;>;采取了一系列果断行动&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;为了平息公众的反应，国土安全部部长亚历杭德罗·N·马约卡斯 (Alejandro N. Mayorkas) 和能源部长詹妮弗·格兰霍姆 (Jennifer Granholm) 于 5 月 11 日在白宫讲台上向美国公众发表讲话，2021 年。新闻发布室是西翼的一个小房间，里面挤满了大约 50 名记者，电视摄像机在后面运行。媒体聚集在这里，通过提出当天最重要问题的尖锐问题，让美国政府对美国公众负责——形成了一个强大的舞台，基本上全世界都在关注。两位国务卿概述了政府正在采取的行动减轻勒索软件攻击的影响。他们还&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/press-briefings/2021/05/11/press-briefing-by-press-secretary-jen-psaki-secretary-of-energy -jennifer-granholm-and-secretary-of-homeland-security-alejandro-mayorkas-may-11-2021/&quot;>;呼吁美国公众“没有理由囤积汽油，特别是在考虑到这一点的情况下”事实上，该管道应在本周末和周末之前基本投入运行。”&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;持久影响&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;殖民地管道勒索软件攻击的地缘政治影响是深远的。在此之后，拜登总统&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/07/09/readout-of-president-joseph-r-biden-jr-call -with-president-vladimir-putin-of- Russia-2/&quot;>;与俄罗斯总统弗拉基米尔·普京直接接触&lt;/a>;，强调了事件的严重性。这场危机还强调了迫切需要&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dhs.gov/news/2021/07/20/dhs-announces-new-cybersecurity-requirements-ritic-pipeline-owners-and-operators ”更强大的&lt;/a>;网络安全措施，特别是对于像殖民地管道这样的关键基础设施。它清楚地提醒我们，网络威胁并不局限于数字世界；网络威胁也不仅仅存在于数字世界。它们会迅速蔓延，造成广泛的破坏和社会影响。最终，殖民管道事件是一个分水岭。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这一事件至今仍在产生连锁反应，重新定义了首席执行官和行业领导者所扮演的角色，并将塑造我们对未来几年网络安全的看法。它还指出了企业领导人需要问自己的一些重要问题，并强调网络事件如何迅速升级为需要美国总统关注的国家安全危机。试想一下，如果 2022 年 2 月下旬或 3 月初，即俄罗斯军队进一步入侵乌克兰几天后，美国再次发生同样具有影响力的勒索软件攻击，会发生什么。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;其中一个连锁反应是首席执行官们的态度思考他们的角色和责任。殖民地管道公司首席执行官约瑟夫·布朗特&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cbsnews.com/news/colonial-pipeline-ceo-ransomware-hackers-senate-hearing/&quot;>;告诉&lt;/a>;国会议员支付大约 430 万美元的比特币作为赎金是“我在能源行业 39 年来做出的最艰难的决定”。是否向黑客支付费用并进一步加剧赎金要求的犯罪循环或&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.securitymagazine.com/articles/93062-ransomware-vicitim-travelex-forced-into-bankruptcy&quot;>;风险&lt;/ a>; 严重破坏甚至破产是不可能的选择。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;首席执行官们显然已经注意到了。很少有人会喜欢从卡诺莎到华盛顿的道路，并成为国会和媒体的焦点。我们从这起事件以及过去两年的其他重大事件中学到了什么？以下是给首席执行官的六项建议：&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;1.小心与公众沟通的方式。 &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;银行挤兑是公众反应和群体心理导致危机恶化的典型例子。 Covid-19 大流行期间的厕纸抢购事件和勒索软件攻击后的加油站抢购事件凸显出这个问题不仅限于金融机构。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;小心与公众沟通的方式和内容。并不意味着避免与公众沟通；相反，这是一种必然。然而，公司需要采取深思熟虑的方法。正如殖民地管道事件所表明的那样，这包括那些很少需要在日常运营中与公众接触的公司，但可能需要日复一日地与公众接触。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>; 2.与政府协调。&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;殖民地管道公司关闭其管道系统的决定需要尽快做出，但可以说有足够的时间咨询美国政府专家。关闭管道系统意味着，无论是否受到感染，都需要数天时间才能重新启动，从而扰乱实际的燃料供应，其所有后果都需要政府采取行动。与政府的协调是避免危机无意中恶化的关键。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;3.知道该联系谁。&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;为了快速做出明智的决策并与合适的人协调，首席执行官需要知道政府中谁是正确的联系人。正如多年来的一些轶事所表明的那样，联系北约或军方并不是正确的答案。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;话虽如此，有时政府并不能让外部各方轻松识别适当的个人或机构，因此政府有责任提供清晰度。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;4.制定一个计划并执行它。&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;这可能是最关键的一点，因为它提供了实现其他目标的工具。除了制定和制定计划（最好由首席执行官监督）之外，该计划还应该每年至少实施一次。定期的桌面练习将帮助公司领导层和员工建立在真正的危机中有效应对所需的“肌肉记忆”。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;5.了解您的网络。&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;理想情况下，首席执行官应该对公司的业务 IT 网络和运营技术 (OT) 网络如何交互有深入的了解。如果系统是气隙的，如果危害仅限于 IT 网络，则无需关闭 OT 网络。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;话虽如此，针对 Colonial Pipeline 的勒索软件攻击已经证明，即使瘫痪业务 IT 网络的变化可能会产生重大影响。如果一家公司无法再开具发票，不知道其客户是谁，也不知道如何联系他们，那么实际影响可能与实际停止生产一样具有破坏性。对于因航空公司 IT 系统&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-airports-systems-idUSKBN18Q10R&quot;>;停机&lt;/a而滞留在机场的读者>;，您亲身经历了破坏性影响。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;6.保持谦虚并寻求专家帮助。&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;网络安全是一个广泛的术语，涵盖高度复杂的问题集。虽然存在共性，并且一些软件跨部门使用，但管道的网络安全与金融部门、医院、学校或铁路的网络安全有很大不同。经过多年跨行业的网络事件，一个重要的见解是承认每个人的知识的局限性，包括网络安全专家的知识。因此，首席执行官应该毫不犹豫地向公司外部寻求帮助，以帮助制定、测试或完善计划或审查现有流程和政策。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;除了这些高级建议之外，还有大量其他资源，包括针对 CEO、董事会成员和 CISO 的更详细的&lt;a href=&quot;https://carnegieendowment.org/specialprojects/fincyber/guides&quot;>;指南和清单&lt;/a>;。美国政府，即网络安全和基础设施安全局 (CISA)，还提供 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cisa.gov/stopransomware&quot;>;Stopransomware.gov&lt;/a>; 和 &lt;a href=&quot;https: //www.cisa.gov/shields-up&quot;>;Shields Up&lt;/a>; 是专为公司设计的资源，可根据其网络安全成熟度水平使用。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;商业领袖作为信任的守护者&lt;/h2 >; &lt;p>;除了出于自身利益和避免国家安全危机而加强公司的网络安全之外，企业领导人还发挥着更大的作用，可以被视为整体技术信任的守护者。从根本上来说，网络安全围绕着信任。勒索软件和许多其他网络攻击都利用了这种信任。他们利用某人点击不可信链接、从未知电子邮件地址下载附件或接收恶意软件更新的情况。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这一原则延伸到公司对其系统底层技术的信任，从而引发地缘政治回到讨论中。中国企业在 5G 网络中的作用多年来一直是一个中心话题。它标志着关于在投资、购买和使用技术时如何考虑风险的更广泛辩论的开始。美国政府对来自中华人民共和国的某些技术的担忧&lt;a href=&quot;https://2017-2021.state.gov/5g-security/index.html&quot;>;众所周知&lt;/a>;。与此同时，在布鲁塞尔和其他欧洲国家首都，一场关于“去风险、 ” 受到俄罗斯入侵乌克兰和欧洲依赖的教训的影响。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;商界领袖处于这场辩论的中心，因为他们是技术信任最重要的守护者。科技公司决定投资什么，以及如何权衡成本与其他收益（例如更高的安全性和信任度）将决定整个社会的整体弹性。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;首席执行官的自我检查&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;多年来，许多人&lt;a href=&quot;/2018/08/corporate-cybersecurity-is-becoming-geopolitical-are-us-tech-companies-ready&quot;>;警告&lt;/a>;网络威胁日益严重，有些人&lt; a href=&quot;/2023/04/cyber-risk-is-forming-heres-how-companies-can-keep-up&quot;>;就如何加强组织的保护和复原力提供了&lt;/a>;深思熟虑的建议。三个问题可以帮助确定是否已采取足够的措施来补充上述建议：&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;您最近参加过网络桌面演习吗？&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;您是否有您的联系信息？首席信息安全官是否保存在工作电话或计算机以外的其他地方？ （请记住，如果您公司的网络遭受勒索软件攻击，您的工作设备可能无法访问。）&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;您知道在发生网络安全事件时您在政府中的联系人吗？&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul >; &lt;p>;如果以上任何一个问题的答案都是“否”，那么阅读本文有望激发一些后续行动 - 它将有助于更好地保护您的组织，并可能防止未来的国家安全危机。&lt;/p>; &lt; !-- 引文 -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 18 Sep 2023 22:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Research: Consumers&rsquo;

close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;Three factors are driving us toward a major shift in consumption patterns where consumers will consider sustainability as a baseline requirement for purchase: 1) Trust drives behavior and, ultimately, business outcomes; 2) Sustainability promotes trust, particularly among younger generations; and 3) Younger generations will soon have most of the purchasing power in the US Companies that understand these trends &amp;#8212; and create truly sustainable brands that make good on their promises to people and the planet &amp;#8212; will seize advantage from brands that make flimsy claims or have not invested sufficiently in sustainability.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/research-consumers-sustainability-demands-are-rising?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/research-consumers-sustainability-demands-are-rising?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;For most consumers, sustainability has been considered a “nice-to-have” in the brands they buy, but &lt;a href=&quot;https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/retail-distribution/consumer-behavior-trends-state-of-the-consumer-tracker/sustainable-products-and-practices-for-green-living.html&quot;>;it&#39;s rarely been table stakes&lt;/a>;. That&#39;s about to change. Our research suggests we&#39;re on the brink of a major shift in consumption patterns, where truly sustainable brands — those that make good on their promises to people and the planet — will seize the advantage from brands that make flimsy claims or that have not invested sufficiently in sustainability. We&#39;re fast approaching this tipping point where sustainability will be considered a baseline requirement for purchase, and companies should prepare now.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To understand why, you need to know three things:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;Trust drives behavior and, ultimately, business outcomes.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Sustainability promotes trust, particularly among younger generations.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Younger generations will soon have most of the purchasing power in the US&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;1. Trust drives behavior and, ultimately, business outcomes.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;We study trust, and through our research involving hundreds of thousands of consumers and employees across more than 500 brands in 30 sectors, we&#39;ve measured the power of trust to drive a range of positive behaviors.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Trusting employees are more motivated to work, have lower rates of absenteeism, and are less likely to look for another job. Trusting customers are more likely to choose a brand over competitors, buy it again, and promote it.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;And highly trusted companies outperform others by up to 400% in terms of market value. These astonishing returns are realized because the marginal effect of trust on companies&#39; stocks grows as those companies earn trust. Our TrustID platform, &lt;a href=&quot;/2022/11/4-questions-to-measure-and-boost-customer-trust&quot;>;which measures company trust&lt;/a>;, shows that when a company&#39;s score moves from 30 to 31, it sees a roughly 3% increase in expected stock returns. When scores climb from 60 to 61, the increase is 6%.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;2. Sustainability promotes trust, particularly among younger generations.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;With such a high payoff for trust, the obvious question for organizations is: What creates trust in a brand? Our research shows that sustainability is a powerful driver. To understand why, you first must understand where trust comes from.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At its core trust is built when a brand or organization makes good promises and then delivers on them. They do this by conveying a positive&amp;nbsp;&lt;em>;intent&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em>;and demonstrating&amp;nbsp;&lt;em>;competence&lt;/em>;, respectively.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We surveyed more than 350,000 US customers aged 18 to 98 to gauge their perception of brands&#39; intent and competence. We measured intent using a combined score of two of the four factors we use to gauge trust: brands&#39; perceived humanity (empathy, kindness, fairness) and transparency (openness to sharing motives and relevant information in plain language). We measured perceptions of brands&#39; competence using a combination of the remaining two trust factors: capability (the quality of offerings) and reliability (consistent delivery).&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We found not only that sustainability stood out as a critical driver of intent, but that there was an important generational effect. While both younger and older consumers care about brands&#39; competence (their quality and consistency), younger consumers&#39; trust in brands — and their resulting purchasing behavior — is much more strongly influenced by the brands&#39; positive intent.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Consider these findings: When Gen Z and Millennial customers believe a brand cares about its impact on people and the planet, they are 27% more likely to purchase it than older generations are — a clear measure of sustainability&#39;s power to drive buying decisions in this group.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To zoom in a bit further, we can look specifically at the impact of humanity and transparency, the trust factors that comprise good intent.&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;When Gen Z and Millennial customers rate a brand highly on humanity, they are 15% more likely than older generations to spend more money with the brand and choose it over its competitors.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;When they rate a brand highly on transparency, they are 30% more likely than older generations to spend more money with it and 20% more likely to choose it over its competitors.&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;3. Younger generations will soon have most of the purchasing power in the US.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Forecasting experts calculate that the purchasing power of Millennials and Gen Z will surpass that of Boomers around the year 2030, with up to $68 trillion in wealth &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/21/what-the-68-trillion-great-wealth-transfer-means-for-advisors.html&quot;>;transferring&lt;/a>; from Boomers to these younger generations by the end of this decade.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To earn these younger consumers&#39; trust, it&#39;s clear that your brand&#39;s sustainability efforts must deliver on humanity and transparency:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;To highlight &lt;em>;humanity&lt;/em>;, demonstrate that your organization values and respects everyone, regardless of identity, background, or beliefs; respects and takes care of its employees; and puts the good of society and the environment above pure profit-making.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;To underscore &lt;em>;transparency, &lt;/em>;make sure it&#39;s easy for consumers to find straightforward information about your brand&#39;s impact on communities and the environment.&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;Organizations that do this well will reap the rewards. Take our findings among grocery stores as an example. &lt;a href=&quot;https://corporate.publix.com/about-publix/company-overview/mission-statement-guarantee&quot;>;Publix&lt;/a>;, one of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://corporate.publix.com/about-publix/company-overview/facts-figures&quot;>;largest-volume supermarket chains&lt;/a>; in the US, ranks #1 in customer trust of 11 peer grocery brands in our TrustID dataset, with humanity and transparency scores that are 75% and 47% higher than the number-two player, respectively. This difference is even more pronounced with Gen Z and Millennial customers, who score Publix as 83% and 95% higher than the number-two player, respectively. As a result, trusting customers are 54% more likely to purchase from Publix than from competitors. And this is even more pronounced with Gen Z and Millennial customers, who are 162% more likely to purchase from Publix than from competitors.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This trust, and the resulting customer loyalty, flows from Publix&#39;s visible investments in people and the planet. For example, Publix employees automatically receive quarterly stock benefits with the option to purchase additional shares. This makes Publix one of the largest employee-owned companies in the world, with over 200,000 employees who together own roughly 80% of the company. Publix also offers medical and tuition benefits as well as company-matched retirement plans, even for part-time employees. And employees receive regular reviews and raises for performance. These benefits help explain why voluntary turnover is only 5% — compared to the industry standard of 65%. It&#39;s no wonder that Publix is one of only four companies that has consistently landed on Fortune&#39;s “100 Best Companies to Work For” list for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://corporate.publix.com/newsroom/news-stories/04042023---publix-named-on-fortunes-100-best-companies-to-work-for-list#:~:text=LAKELAND%2C%20Fla.%2C%20April%204,the%20list&#39;s%20inception%20in%201998.&quot;>;26th consecutive year&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the planet side, Publix has actively invested in reducing food waste and promoting conservation. For example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://sustainability.publix.com/bakery/reducing-food-waste/&quot;>;in 2022&lt;/a>; the company sent more than 54 million pounds of food waste–manufacturing byproducts to farmers to turn into animal feed. That same year, its seafood department switched from polystyrene containers to returnable plastic totes, eliminating the use of 190,000 containers, while the deli department opted for lighter plastic bags and replaced plastic-wrapped cutlery sets with cutlery stations. Together, these moves eliminate over 360,000 pounds of plastic waste per year. Publix has also created its own line of sustainable food products under the “GreenWise” label, demonstrating its commitment to quality ingredients and strict animal welfare standards.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Let Publix&#39;s experience be a lesson: While the tipping point may not come until 2030, companies of all types should expand their sustainability efforts and communications &lt;em>;today&lt;/em>; to win trust — and customers — in the future.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 18 Sep 2023 21:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[How to Address the Supply-Chain Staffing Crisis]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/09/how-to-address-the-supply-chain-staffing-crisis]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/09/Sep23_18_1405943251.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;SasinT Gallery/Getty Images&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;Businesses are being impacted by a global skills shortage that is hampering manufacturing output and service delivery. In addition, the costs of producing materials, manufacturing goods, and providing services is rising due to labor costs. For small to medium enterprises, this means margins may be squeezed to the point to where they can no longer compete in today&amp;#8217;s hyper-competitive global marketplace. AI, robotics, digital transactions, and related automation provide the means for SMEs to enhance and build capabilities cost-effectively.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/how-to-address-the-supply-chain-staffing-crisis?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/how-to-address-the-supply-chain-staffing-crisis?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;Our global supply chains are stressed and under pressure, not only because of material shortfalls and shipping delays, but also due to labor shortages in key sectors. Skills shortages are now seen across all points of the supply-chain continuum, from sourcing to production, logistics, and delivery of goods and services. These gaps range from more manual tasks, such as warehouse order picking, to building and maintaining supply-chain systems. Technology is now advanced enough to fill in many of the gaps resulting from skills shortages but cannot do it alone. Rebuilding distressed supply chains will require a combination of technology and human skills development strategies.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Recruiting and keeping qualified workers is cited as the leading challenge for the 2,000 supply chain executives responding to a recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mhi.org/publications/report&quot;>;survey&lt;/a>; by MHI, a supply-chain industry trade association. A majority, 57%, state that hiring and retaining qualified workers is this year&#39;s greatest challenge, along with 56% struggling with ongoing specific talent shortages.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A range of industries sensitive to supply-chain vulnerabilities face labor shortages, led by durable goods manufacturing, wholesale and retail trade, and health services, according to an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.uschamber.com/workforce/understanding-americas-labor-shortage-the-most-impacted-industries&quot;>;analysis&lt;/a>; by of the US Chamber of Commerce. “Even if every unemployed person with experience in the durable goods manufacturing industry were employed, the industry would fill only around 75% of the vacant jobs,” the report states.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Sensitive Industries&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Executives and experts across affected industries agree it&#39;s urgent to solve skills shortfalls. Economic headwinds could soften employment demand, but acute staffing challenges are here to stay. Long-term factors such as an aging population and rapidly evolving technology skills gaps have become the new norm in staffing.&lt;/p>; &lt;article-promo>; &lt;hbr-component type=&quot;promo&quot; is-insight=&quot;insight-center&quot; title=&quot;The New Age of Operations&quot; dek=&quot;Improving efficiency and increasing resilience.&quot; cta-text=&quot;&quot; href=&quot;/insight-center/the-new-age-of-operations&quot;>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/insight-center/the-new-age-of-operations&quot; style=&quot;color:black;text-decoration:none&quot;>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; Insight Center Collection &lt;/div>; &lt;h3>;The New Age of Operations&lt;/h3>; &lt;div>; Improving efficiency and increasing resilience. &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hbr-component>; &lt;/article-promo>; &lt;p>;Manufacturing, in particular, represents “the point of the spear for the supply chain,” says Joe Walden, supply chain professor at the University of Kansas. “The labor shortages are hitting these folks the hardest. Regardless of the labor situation at other links in the supply chain, the shortage at this level impacts the availability of products for the consumer.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Within the logistics and distribution sector, “labor shortages are affecting the movement of goods,” says Yikun Shao, B2B North American supply chain leader for Alibaba.com. “Understaffing in logistics areas could lead to delayed shipping, delayed port loading and unloading, shortages of truck drivers and inventory stock-outs, difficulties in fulfilling customer orders on time, and a variety of other challenges.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This, in turn, adversely affects retailers and distributors downstream. “The high cost of labor mixed with ongoing demand for talent has become a detriment to merchants and their fulfillment processes,” says Kelton Kosik, head of supply chain at Ware2Go, a division of UPS. “Even as the strain on global supply chains has somewhat leveled out, a lack of talent during peak shipping seasons — like Cyber Monday and holiday sales events — and abilities to manufacture, move and deliver products can deflate or slow the economy.”&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Technology to the Rescue?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;To address these issues and automate many skills requirements, companies are ramping up their technology investments, the MHI survey shows. Close to three in four of supply chain executives, 74%, are increasing their investments in technology. A majority, 58%, cite artificial intelligence as their current leading area of investment, along with 54% looking to intelligent partner networks through the industrial Internet of Things.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, there is a catch-22 to deploying technology to resolve skills gaps — finding the skills up front to build and maintain AI and IoT systems. Supply-chain executives in the survey cite “lack of adequate talent” as a major hinderance to implementing technologies such as AI or IoT. “Ironically, talent is both a barrier and beneficiary when it comes to implementing innovative technologies,” the report&#39;s authors state. “Although deploying technology to automate routine tasks requires talent and manpower, once the technology is up and running it can free up workers to focus on higher-value tasks that require human involvement.” &amp;nbsp;Higher-value tasks may include working more closely with customers or clients, or coordinating and monitoring the flow of goods or services.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Time to Act&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;A combination of technology and proactive skills development efforts are needed for companies to attract and maintain the skills essential to supporting supply chains, as well as managing the technology to move things forward. Businesses can “increase the productivity of their workers by shifting them from repetitive tasks into roles that current technology is ill equipped to handle,” says Ricardo Ungo, professor and director of the Maritime, Ports and Logistics Institute at Old Dominion University. “This is a necessary step toward the digitalization of the whole chain, providing much needed visibility.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The following actions can help address skills shortages within supply chains:&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;&lt;strong>;Target technology investments.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;“Small to medium enterprises may have a more limited capital investment capability,” says, says Keith Fisher, the president of Honeywell Intelligrated. “They need to prioritize solutions with a clear return on investment. For example, by incorporating automation into parts of their business with high turnover rates, small businesses might see a greater impact on improved productivity for a more immediate ROI.”&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;&lt;strong>;Position technologies to pick up the slack for manual or repetitive tasks.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;All-encompassing automation approaches have been particularly helpful within organizations that require scaling up manual or repetitive work, such as distribution operations. Robots, for example, can be employed for scanning, assembling, and moving parts and products across distribution centers or warehouses. Robots, along with automatic storage and retrieval systems, and automation systems, can pick up the slack for many physically demanding jobs,” says Walden.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Such applications “help increase the productivity of distribution center workers by reducing significantly the time spent traveling from one location to pick products to another,” Walden adds. “Many of the automation concepts from automated picking to robotic pallet building to automated packaging are finally finding their way into distribution centers to offset the shortage of workers.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, comprehensive automation is “providing opportunities to integrate automation and robotics capabilities to fill labor gaps and manage mundane tasks like automated taping, label applications and scanning,” says Kosik. “Remaining talent can focus on more pressing tasks as well. Companies can use AI for better demand forecasting to ensure labor is being most efficiently allocated.”&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;&lt;strong>;Leverage technology to enhance the work of employees.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;At their core, supply chains will always be more than automated systems or algorithms exchanging information and purchase orders. “Supply chains are social networks,” writes Yossi Sheffi, professor of engineering systems at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in his book, &lt;em>;The Magic Conveyor Belt: Supply Chains, AI, and the Future of Work.&lt;/em>; “When it comes to making decisions in a supply chain, such as managing exceptions or escalating problems, the personal relationships between the people in the companies and both their customers and suppliers matter. Customer-supplier relationships can be complex “with a web of personal relationships.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Technology solutions should be purposed to enhance these relationships, as well as increase the productivity of workers at all levels.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, “the use of AI-augmented reality allows the employment of people with limited or no experience, because they are instructed by the software to do certain tasks,” Sheffi illustrates.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another emerging use case for AI filling in for skills shortages is autonomous trucking. For example, a “truck platoon,” led by a human driver in a lead truck, consists of electronically linked trucks that follow the movements of the lead truck. “Many companies are investing in developing Level 4 automated driving technologies to haul freight in long-haul routes, allowing them to overcome a lack of drivers caused by the aversion to the long hours away from home,” Lungo says.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;&lt;strong>;Train and develop employees&#39; skills to manage modern supply chains&lt;/strong>;.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Organizations should think of talent as also having its own supply chain, Sheffi advocates. This serves “to deliver the skills that people need to enable them to get and retain good jobs,” and from an employer perspective, “to ensure that companies have the skilled talent they need to produce affordable and valuable products and services for customers.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For small to medium-size businesses, training is essential. “Properly training teams to comprehend the technology&#39;s functionality and operate it effectively is vital,” says Fisher. “This not only helps them get the new technology operational more quickly but improves the adoption and, ultimately, the value of the investment.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In recent years, there has been a 15% increase in the number of organizations investing in upskilling and reskilling programs, with 41% focusing on working to prepare their workers for new tech-forward supply chain jobs, the MHI survey finds, Upskilling is essential to provide the education and training needed to boost skills across front-line supply-chain jobs. “For example, an operations manager who currently uses Microsoft Excel could be trained on a more sophisticated process to integrate supply chain information using new software for shipping and logistics management,” according to the report.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Today&#39;s supply chains have fragile links — companies are struggling to find and retain the workers they need to keep goods and information flowing. This is an opportunity to step up technology investments to automate as much of the work in production, logistics, and delivery of goods and services as possible. At the same time, technology alone cannot shoulder the scope of work needed. Employers also need to step up their skills acquisition and development, helping workers learn and work with technology to deliver results.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Technology can be employed to “support human workers in countless ways: fostering new capabilities and behaviors; improving operational performance; increasing safety; and supporting a more optimal work-life balance,” the MHI report advocates. “New workplace technologies are emerging that don&#39;t just augment human workers and perform mundane work.相反，当有策略地使用时，它们有能力帮助个人和团队提高技能和重新技能他们的能力。”&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- 引用 -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 18 Sep 2023 21:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[How the Geeks Rewrote the Rules of Management]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/09/how-the-geeks-rewrote-the-rules-of-management]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;div js-target=&quot;video-player-page&quot; data-props=&quot;{&amp;quot;name&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;6337217510112&amp;quot;}&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>;&lt;/div>; &lt;div>;&lt;/div>; &lt;div>;&lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;span>;Loading... &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;script src=&quot;//players.brightcove.net/2071817190001/default_default/index.min.js&quot;>;&lt;/script>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;Andrew McAfee is a principal research scientist at the MIT Sloan School of Management. Throughout his career, he has done ground-breaking research on how digital technologies are changing the world. He is a prolific writer, a frequent contributor to HBR and other outlets, and a sought-after commentator on technological change &amp;#8211; especially, these days, on the potential of generative AI. He is the author of the forthcoming book &amp;#8220;The Geek Way: The Radical Mindset that Drives Extraordinary Results,&amp;#8221; the subject of much of this &amp;#8220;New World of Work&amp;#8221; interview. His big idea is that &amp;#8220;geeks&amp;#8221; have created not only the technology that&amp;#8217;s driving our future but also a management approach that defines contemporary corporate excellence. It&amp;#8217;sa somewhat contrarian view; after all, many of us have criticized Silicon Valley-run businesses as being male-dominated and lacking in empathy (even, of course, as we continue to use their products). What does McAfee mean by geek? He defines them as &amp;#8220;obsessive mavericks,&amp;#8221; people who become obsessed with hard problems and are willing to pursue unconventional solutions &amp;#8211; to avoid the dysfunctions that have traditionally plagued companies as they expand.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/how-the-geeks-rewrote-the-rules-of-management?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/how-the-geeks-rewrote-the-rules-of-management?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;The secret to success for many Silicon Valley tech companies isn&#39;t necessarily that they&#39;re ultra-nimble start-ups, or that they&#39;re led by tech-savvy geniuses. In fact, their success often has more to do with a specific type of corporate culture—and it&#39;s a culture that even companies not based on the US West Coast or focused on technology can adopt.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Andrew McAfee, a principal research scientist at the MIT Sloan School of Management, business leaders need to think more like geeks, but not the computer-based stereotype you may be familiar with. In his forthcoming book, &lt;em>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Geek-Way-Radical-Transforming-Business/dp/0316436704&quot;>;The Geek Way: The Radical Mindset that Drives Extraordinary Results&lt;/a>;&lt;/em>;, McAfee says geeks are nothing more or less than “obsessive mavericks” who are absolutely fixated on finding unconventional solutions to their business&#39; hard problems. You need them throughout the organization, not just at the top, and you need to entrust them with the power to make real changes.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For this episode of our video series “The New World of Work”, HBR editor in chief Adi Ignatius sat down with McAfee to discuss:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;Evolving a company&#39;s culture not by focusing on organizational structure, but on company norms&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Building organizations that can get things right, even when the person at the top of the org chart is wrong&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;The delicate balance of human judgment and evidence, data-driven insights.&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;“&lt;a href=&quot;/insight-center/the-new-world-of-work&quot;>;The New World of Work&lt;/a>;” explores how top-tier executives see the future and how their companies are trying to set themselves up for success. Each week, Ignatius talks to a top leader on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/company/harvard-business-review/&quot;>;LinkedIn Live&lt;/a>; — previous interviews included &lt;a href=&quot;/2021/10/microsofts-satya-nadella-on-flexible-work-the-metaverse-and-the-power-of-empathy&quot;>;Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella&lt;/a>; and &lt;a href=&quot;/2021/11/indra-nooyi-former-ceo-of-pepsico-on-nurturing-talent-in-turbulent-times&quot;>;former PepsiCo CEO Indra Nooyi&lt;/a>;.

My definition has two parts. For me a geek is somebody who gets obsessed with a hard problem and is willing to embrace unconventional solutions.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The patron saint of geeks is probably &lt;a href=&quot;https://amshq.org/About-Montessori/History-of-Montessori/Who-Was-Maria-Montessori&quot;>;Maria Montessori&lt;/a>;, who about 100 years ago got obsessed with the problem of how you educate young children best, and came up with the Montessori educational method, which is this radical departure from the industrial scale model of schools that was dominant then, and sadly still dominant now. Think about Maria Montessori when you think about a geek.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;How do you define the “geek way” that you&#39;re talking about in the book?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ANDREW MCAFEE:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The particular geeks I got excited about that led me to write the book were not educational geeks like Maria Montessori, they were business geeks.他们是一群专注于（但不限于）美国西海岸的人，他们痴迷于这样的问题：“在一个技术变革非常快、充满不确定性的时代，我们如何经营一家公司？特别是，我们如何避免互联网时代的一些经典功能障碍？”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;他们想出了极客的方式。这是他们为了实现这个真正艰巨的目标而确定的商业模式、文化或一套规范。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS：&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这是一种对管理层感到厌烦的人，对吧？管理流程。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ANDREW MCAFEE：&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“痴迷特立独行”是我对极客的首选短语。我真正感兴趣的是那些痴迷的特立独行者，他们再次热衷于解决以下问题：“我们如何经营一家公司，并在我们的市场上保持良好的表现，并避免似乎困扰许多成功公司的功能障碍。”当他们变老变大时？我们如何避免这些功能障碍？我们如何做一些更高绩效、更可持续和更好的工作场所的事情？”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS：&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当我读这本书时，你谈到的一些属性，它们与速度有关，与实验有关。这只是数字化或应用业务设计思维的另一个术语吗？我们在这里谈论的是同一件事吗？&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ANDREW MCAFEE：&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;不，我不这么认为。阿迪，你还记得&lt;a href=&quot;https://variety.com/2023/digital/news/jeffrey-katzenberg-quibi-proud-to-own-failure-1235623036/&quot;>;Quib​​i&lt;/a>;，对吧，杰弗里·卡森伯格 (Jeffrey Katzenberg) 领导的视频初创公司？它将制作短片，并将改变我们消费娱乐的方式。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Quib​​i 完全是数字化的。这是一家完全数字化的企业。这是一次悲惨的失败。他们筹集了 17.5 亿美元。他们在推出后 200 天内就关闭了。这简直就是一场灾难。这是一家完全数字化的企业。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Netflix 是一家极客公司。他们遵循我的所有四个伟大的极客规范：科学、所有权、速度和开放性。我认为他们的结果不言自明。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;对我来说，极客与数字完全分开。你可以是一个非数字极客，而且你当然可以非常数字化但一点也不极客。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS：&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Quib​​i 的事情是一个有趣的例子。我想你的框架缺少的是开放性。你有一个成功的强大人物，但他没有倾听。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ANDREW MCAFEE：&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;没有倾听他的同行、同事的意见，给他的顾问。他似乎不是一个很好的倾听者，这是许多工业时代公司都会陷入的这种刻板陷阱。科技领导者也经常陷入这个陷阱。你变得迷恋自己的成功，而你真的不再倾听。这种情况非常普遍。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我对 Netflix 的里德·黑斯廷斯 (Reed Hastings) 这样的人充满力量且令我尊敬的事情之一是，他能够建立一家在他自己错误的情况下做出正确重要决策的企业。他们。在书中我谈到了其中的几个。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;他对于下载到 Netflix 应用程序的实用性的看法是完全错误的。他认为这根本没有什么用处。它非常有用。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;关于儿童节目对 Netflix 的重要性，他的看法是错误的。他在书中承认了这一点，&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/No-Rules-Netflix-Culture-Reinvention/dp/1984877860&quot;>;&lt;em>;没有规则&lt;/em>;&lt;/ a>; 他与 Erin Meyer 一起写的。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;他成功地努力建立了一家公司，这将纠正他，老板，组织高层的高地位和有声望的人。这是我所说的开放性极客规范的一部分。当组织结构图最高层的人犯错时，你如何建立一家能够正确行事的公司？伙计，这是一个难题。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS：&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这是一个难题。我确信有些人读了你的书后会想：“等等，我们谈论的很多公司都是硅谷初创公司或该领域的某个地方。”人们普遍认为这些文化不一定是你想要效仿的。他们通常是男性主导的兄弟文化。老板常常是一个要求过高的恶霸。您如何看待这一切？&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ANDREW MCAFEE：&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;硅谷显然正在发生一些事情。存在有毒文化。你提到了兄弟文化。我想说 &lt;a href=&quot;/2022/11/why-startups-should-embrace-radical-transparency&quot;>;Theranos&lt;/a>; 是我听过的最有毒的文化之一，它的总部就在在硅谷。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我认为那些根本不是极客公司。他们可能处于正确的地理位置，但他们没有遵循极客方式，即关于这些规范以及创建一种快速移动、自由流动、争论、自主、证据驱动和相当平等的文化。这就是极客方式的目标。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;现在你指出了一些我认为遵循极客方式的公司，但它们仍然过于苍白、陈旧和男性化。这绝对是真的。关于这一点，证据非常清楚。我希望随着时间的推移，情况会变得更好。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但是阿迪，你说了一些我不同意的话，即很多文化都不是工作的好地方。在某些情况下确实如此。还记得 LinkedIn 在 2016 年进行顶级吸引者调查时，他们说，看，我们只会考虑客观标准。我们将了解 LinkedIn 会员最常查看哪些公司页面。哪些公司最受 LinkedIn 会员的兴趣、最多的申请以及人们在找到第一份工作时会留在哪里？&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;LinkedIn 列表中排名前 11 的公司都是总部位于西海岸的公司在我们笼统称为科技的行业中。极客文化是一种极具吸引力的工作文化。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS：&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;其中一些创始人、企业家从事他们所从事的任何事情，因为他们想让世界变得更美好，Serge 和 Larry 在他们的车库里试图系统化我们对世界上所有信息的访问，这些伟大的理想：当他们真正经营公司时，他们不仅试图经营一家公司，而且他们成为杀手，想要消灭竞争，培育垄断行为，尽可能多地攫取市场份额。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ANDREW MCAFEE：&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;是有这个新的吗？企业内部？不，我认真的。以前时代的生意可爱吗？他们希望竞争对手成功吗？ Were they trying to rise all boats?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Capitalism is an inherently competitive process. These companies are very, very good performers. If you want to use the adjective “killer” for them, I think that&#39;s by design. You&#39;re not in business not to succeed. You want to grow your market share. You want to grow your profits, you want grow. That is often at the expense of somebody else.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I think it&#39;s for the courts to decide whether they meet the definition of monopolist. It&#39;s a word we toss around a lot. The courts so far have tossed out a lot of the recent lawsuits against some of these giant tech companies. I don&#39;t think they meet the definition of monopolist. In general, for a lot of these companies, the competition is one click away.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;And is Tesla a monopolist in the auto industry? You simply can&#39;t make that case. SpaceX has become pretty close to a monopolist in the rockets and satellites industry, but they didn&#39;t start that way, and they&#39;ve become so large and influential because they do the job better.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Let&#39;s talk about companies that are doing it right. This is not universally for digital companies. Some follow the geek way, as you&#39;ve laid it out, some don&#39;t.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;How many companies, large, small, digital, otherwise live into these principles, do you think?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ANDREW MCAFEE:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I think that&#39;s a really interesting question, and I don&#39;t have a great way to answer it yet. Because the only way that I can think to answer it is to administer a survey to everybody and get them to fill it out. That&#39;s just not going to work.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But you can look at what we know about the cultures at these companies. You can also look at the fantastic &lt;a href=&quot;https://sloanreview.mit.edu/projects/culture-500-introducing-the-2020-culture-champions/&quot;>;Culture 500 research that Don and Charlie Sull&lt;/a>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sloanreview.mit.edu/projects/culture-500-introducing-the-2020-culture-champions/&quot;>; did&lt;/a>;, published in a competitor magazine of yours, &lt;em>;Sloan Management Review&lt;/em>;. They grabbed all the LinkedIn reviews and put them through a machine-learning analysis to see what companies&#39; own employees said about them.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Three areas I was most interested in were execution, agility, and innovation. And wow, the scores for companies clustered on the West Coast, clustered in Silicon Valley, clustered in industries that we call high-tech, those scores are off the charts. There&#39;s not any real competition for them.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There&#39;s something brewing on the West Coast in industries that we label (for reasons that I don&#39;t like very much) high-tech. There&#39;s something brewing that&#39;s new, that is different than what&#39;s going on elsewhere in the economy, and it&#39;s pretty demonstrably powerful. The label that I hang on that is the geek way.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Was Steve Jobs a geek, and did his Apple follow the geek way or was that a different model?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ANDREW MCAFEE:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Jobs has some really classic non-geek characteristics. He believed that he knew best. He had a very, very large ego. He also screamed at his subordinates all the time, which I think is absolutely not what an open leader does.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, I interviewed Eric Schmidt for the book, and I brought this up to him and he said, “Look, I was on Apple&#39;s board for a while. I knew Steve pretty well.” He said Steve was a tough person in all those ways, but he learned that if you want to stay on top, you have to listen to the people around you. You have to stop thinking that you have all the answers.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We see a really clear example of that with the App Store. Jobs did not want to open up his beautiful, perfect walled garden iPhone to outside developers. He had to be talked into it. He eventually realized that he was wrong about that. There is a little bit of that openness going on.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One thing that Apple is pretty fanatic about, as I understand it, is they make decisions based on evidence. And whether or not that&#39;s a huge AB testing infrastructure is one thing. Apple loves to demo features, and gets everybody in the room to look at this and say, for example, is it better to have blurry portrait photos where you can adjust the blur before you take the picture? The instant they did a demo, they had the answer to that question. They did not sit around and argue from their different points of view. They said, OK, let&#39;s run an experiment. Let&#39;s do a demo here. That&#39;s an extremely geeky approach.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One of the interesting things about Jobs, and certainly something he would&#39;ve said about himself, he did say about himself, was that he didn&#39;t, and that one shouldn&#39;t, slavishly follow the focus groups. People don&#39;t know what they want.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It&#39;s a combination of let&#39;s get input, but there is a lot of personal touch, personal feel. It&#39;s like &lt;em>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Moneyball-Art-Winning-Unfair-Game/dp/0393324818&quot;>;Moneyball&lt;/a>;&lt;/em>; versus the old school. Maybe the answer is a combination of skills.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ANDREW MCAFEE:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Absolutely. And Ted Sarandos, who&#39;s the co-CEO of Netflix, says their decision-making is pretty algorithmic. It&#39;s 70-30 algorithmic versus human judgment. But he said, if anything, the human judgment is on top, if that makes any sense.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I think that makes a ton of sense. This norm of science that the geeks are pretty passionate about, it&#39;s not just dry analysis and do whatever the data says. That&#39;s an inaccurate caricature.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Science is about settling arguments with evidence. It&#39;s a ground rule for how you&#39;re going to come to a decision. You&#39;re going to do a test, you&#39;re going to do an experiment. You&#39;re going to sit around in a group and argue about it. And if you can&#39;t agree, evidence is going to settle this issue.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Science is this inherently, deeply social, deeply argumentative process with a ground rule. Evidence is the queen here. That&#39;s what we&#39;re going to follow. And a lot of the geek companies that I respect do that as naturally as breathing.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One of the examples in your book of geek culture triumphing is Microsoft, and specifically when &lt;a href=&quot;/2021/10/microsofts-satya-nadella-on-flexible-work-the-metaverse-and-the-power-of-empathy&quot;>;Satya Nadella&lt;/a>; came in and rekindled that early success and more. Talk a bit about what he got right, particularly in the framework that you&#39;ve created.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ANDREW MCAFEE:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Can you think of a more impressive corporate turnaround story in living memory?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;No. Microsoft went from the tech company we liked least to maybe the one we like best.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ANDREW MCAFEE:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;And if you were an investor, you really didn&#39;t like it for about a decade. The stock price was flat as a corpse&#39;s EKG. And then Nadella took over, and it&#39;s become one of the most valuable companies in the world. It&#39;s an astonishing comeback story.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I got to interview Nadella for the book. He&#39;d made brilliant strategic moves, a bunch of them. You have Microsoft embracing open source, wow.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But I was interested in the cultural changes that he made. And he did a couple things that I think are straight out of the geek playbook. Some of them are obvious. He embraced agile development methods as widely and quickly as possible inside Microsoft. He did a couple things to reduce the sclerotic bureaucracy that was in place at Microsoft, which was just hamstringing their ability to do anything important out there in the world.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One of the brilliant things he did was say, “Look, you cannot own a digital resource inside Microsoft. You cannot own the data. You cannot own the code.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;And what he meant by that was you can&#39;t be the gatekeeper. You can&#39;t say yes or no to other groups who might want to use it. With that one simple move, he said to the company, “Look, if the AI group wants to go grab all of the GitHub code to train up a model to help provide assistance to programmers, you don&#39;t have to ask permission. Just go do that, subject to all the right constraints and safeties on it.” Man, that is an astonishingly good bureaucracy-reduction mechanism.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Maybe the deepest thing that Nadella did was that he pulled off this amazing feat of helping Microsoft become a less defensive organization. What I mean by that was, he said in his interview with me, “We had a culture where it was not OK to be wrong, to show any weakness, to not hit your numbers, to not be the smartest person in the room.” He said, “We just had that culture and it had to change.” He did a number of really brilliant things to move from a culture of defensiveness to a culture of openness.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When I used to hear this word, “vulnerability”, in connection with leadership or business, I thought it was just a buzz phrase, hand wavy, nonsense business. The company is not a therapy group. It&#39;s not there so you can sit around feeling vulnerable all the time. I was just wrong.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Now, the company is not your therapy group. However, a successful company needs to be a place where it&#39;s okay to be wrong, to fail, to not have the answer, to show that you&#39;re uncertain. Nadella helped get Microsoft down that path, and it was an absolutely fundamental thing to do.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I also interviewed Yamini Rangan, who&#39;s the CEO of HubSpot here in Cambridge, who took over a culture and has strengthened it through a really difficult time through the pandemic.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She discussed one of the things she learned and that she was good at was saying in this unbelievably uncertain time of the pandemic where tech companies were shrinking. It was all weird. She said to a lot of her constituencies, “Look, I don&#39;t know. I don&#39;t know what the future holds here. I&#39;m going to be honest with you.” She also shared her board performance review with her direct reports, not just the good parts, but the stuff that she needs to work on too. These are all just great moves to start to show the rest of the organization it is okay not to be perfect, not to put on the brave front, not to be winning all of the time.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Jack Welch&#39;s autobiography was called &lt;em>;Winning&lt;/em>;, and it epitomized this industrial era view of what you have to do all day every day. I love the geek view, which is, “Hey, man, we&#39;re going to launch some rockets and they are going to blow up. Now, we&#39;re not going to kill anybody, but we&#39;re absolutely going to launch some rockets that are going to blow up on the launchpad.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Bezos said a few years back in the shareholder&#39;s letter, “We are incubating multi-billion dollar failures inside Amazon right now. That&#39;s appropriate for a company of our scale.” And you look at Alexa and I think maybe he was right about that.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But the point is that this obsession with winning and being on top and being right and being dominant, that has to go away.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I want to get to audience questions. One came from Shabana in Pakistan. What kinds of organizational design, organizational structures, do you need to foster this sort of geek culture?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ANDREW MCAFEE:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I don&#39;t think org structure is the key because the companies that I surveyed have very, very different org charts. They also have very different formal practices.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Netflix is fairly famous for having the no-vacation-days policy. Amazon has extremely strict vacation policies for different levels of employee.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I think it&#39;s not a matter of the org chart or the org structure that you have. It&#39;s not so much a matter of how formal a lot of your policies are. It&#39;s a matter of your norms. I love that word and I use it in the book all the time.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A norm is a behavior that the people around you expect. Maybe it&#39;s written down in the employee manual. Very often it&#39;s not. It&#39;s community policing. It&#39;s what the people around you expect. If you go out of line and violate a norm in a community, you will know that fairly quickly and you will either come back into line or you&#39;re just not going to stick around very long.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you can work on these norms of science, argue about evidence, of ownership, push authority and decision-making down to an uncomfortable degree, speed, iterate, don&#39;t plan, don&#39;t analyze, build stuff, get feedback, learn from reality and then openness. Don&#39;t be defensive. Be willing to pivot. Be willing to admit that you&#39;re wrong. They show a little vulnerability. Those are the norms that are critical for the geek way.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So Bob from our audience is asking, “Is the stack of books on your right your reading list for the week?”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ANDREW MCAFEE:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These are from all over the place. But there was a stack of books that I kept referring to when I was writing &lt;em>;The Geek Way&lt;/em>;, and they were not business books. I am sorry to admit this as a business book writer.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;They were books from this relatively new field called cultural evolution, which gets at this fundamental question, “Why are we the only species on the planet that builds spaceships?” Nothing else is even close. We&#39;re really the only ones out there. The octopuses are not going to do it. The ants, the bees, the chimpanzees are not going to do it. Why are we humans the only spaceship-building species on the planet? This field of cultural evolution to me has come up with the best answer to that question, which is we are the only species that cooperates intensely with large numbers of people that we&#39;re not related to. We are the species that learns the quickest, that improves its toolkit, its technologies, its cultures most rapidly over time.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;You can take that and put that to work in a company. A company is a large group of mostly unrelated people. And the goal of a company is to improve its culture, its artifacts, its technologies, its practices over time. The goal of a company is to practice very rapid cultural evolution. Now that we know a bit about how cultural evolution happens, we can put those insights to work.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There&#39;s this massive unexplored opportunity to take the insights from this field and put them to work inside the company. I think it&#39;s so massive because I haven&#39;t heard anybody talk using cultural evolution&#39;s terms inside even very geeky companies. This is very, very new stuff. And I think &lt;em>;The Geek Way&lt;/em>; is the first applied business book of cultural evolution.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I think I just figured something out. You&#39;re a total geek.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ANDREW MCAFEE:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We&#39;ve been working together for years. It took you this long to realize this?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But the thing that I got obsessed with was that in my career, I&#39;ve spent a lot of time in the (I hate these labels) old economy and the new economy, lots of industrial-era incumbents, and then a lot of companies clustered in the tech space, clustered on the West Coast.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For my whole career, I have been trying to pattern match and figure out what the deep differences are between the two. Is it the foosball tables? Is it the hoodies? Is it bringing your dog to work? No, obviously not.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Where the action is in the economy, where the excitement is in the economy, what are they doing differently? And &lt;em>;The Geek Way&lt;/em>; contains my answers to that kind of career long, geeky, head scratching question.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Let&#39;s get practical for our viewers who aren&#39;t in classically geeky cultures. How can they apply the approaches you&#39;re championing, at their own companies?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ANDREW MCAFEE:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Here are a few things you can start doing tomorrow that are extremely geeky practices that will get some traction. When you&#39;re in charge of your group or you&#39;re a team member or you&#39;re leading a team, if you say things like, “Oh, that&#39;s a good point. I hadn&#39;t thought of that. Let&#39;s go that way,” or, “Oh, I was wrong about that. That&#39;s really good to know,” you have just demonstrated openness and vulnerability instead of classic defensiveness.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;That&#39;s hard to do. Human beings are inherently defensive people, we don&#39;t like being shown to be wrong in public. It&#39;s deeply uncomfortable. But if you model that behavior, it will start to spread. And I&#39;ve seen geek leaders do that over and over.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;You can start to push decisions and responsibility down to a place that makes you uncomfortable, and to get out of saying, “Just run that by me first,” or, “Make sure I&#39;m included on that,” and try to get rid of the hard and soft bureaucracy that gets in the way.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I was talking to &lt;a href=&quot;http://robots.stanford.edu/&quot;>;Sebastian Thrun&lt;/a>;, who&#39;s an alpha geek in all kinds of things, and he said, “One of the things I try to get my teams to do is stop so much communicating.” He had this great image. He said, “A team works on something, and then they run it up the flagpole.” He said the really natural tendency is for the people at every layer of the org chart to add something to that because they want to be part of the solution, they want to be part of this winning idea. By the time that idea gets back down to the originating team, it&#39;s unrecognizable. Get out of that business.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Again, this is uncomfortable stuff to do, but it&#39;s a big step toward the geek way. And then finally, you can start to say, “How are we going to make this decision? Can we agree on what evidence we&#39;re going to look at to make this decision?”, as opposed to saying, “Well, I&#39;m the boss,” or, “I got it right last time, so you should listen to me this time,” all these other ways we have to make decisions, credentials, hierarchy, charisma, excellent PowerPoint, all these things: get out of that business and start asking for the consensus on, “How are we going to settle this argument? What evidence are we going to look at?” These are all super geeky practices you can start doing tomorrow.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Here&#39;s another audience question. This is Lori from North Carolina, and it&#39;s another very practical question: how can organizations get leaders to unlearn the idea that failure is bad?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ANDREW MCAFEE:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is a super hard question, and I fall back on something that I learned from &lt;a href=&quot;/2020/01/the-essential-clayton-christensen-articles&quot;>;Clay Christensen&lt;/a>;: one of the things Clay taught me is that managers are voracious consumers of theory. He said, “Don&#39;t be afraid to tell them why this needs to change, what the principle, what the framework is.” And he said, “If you want to get people to change, there&#39;s a kind of a tripod. There are three things you have to do over and over again more until you&#39;re absolutely exhausted.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First of all, tell them a vivid story. We humans respond to narratives. Second, give them some evidence, give them some numbers to show that it works. And third, give them a theory. Explain why it works. You&#39;ve just got to go through all three of those legs.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Why can&#39;t we make decisions this way? I&#39;m a pretty smart person. I reached this place on the org chart because of my excellent judgment. What do you mean we should be relying a lot less on my judgment?” Again, three part answer to that question, keep iterating on it. It is not an easy process.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I think a lot of companies who get interested in what Silicon Valley does differently or might want to embrace the geek way are going to find it hard going because a lot of it is unnatural and uncomfortable. Challenging your boss in a meeting in most circumstances is uncomfortable, until it becomes a norm, until it becomes what people around you expect.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I can&#39;t let you go without talking a little bit about generative AI. You have an article in the next issue of HBR on how businesses can most effectively capitalize on the technology. What is your thinking, your quick overview, on the utility of GenAI, and its likely impact on, let&#39;s say, the white-collar workforce?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ANDREW MCAFEE:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The more I think about GenAI, the more I think we&#39;re underestimating its impact. It is so general, it is so powerful, it is improving so quickly, it&#39;s leading to so many complementary innovations. I have never seen the computer science geeks, the economic geeks, and the business geeks all get so excited about anything in my career, which is actually a quarter-century long by this point.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Generative AI is going to change the business world. It&#39;s probably going to do it quicker than a lot of us are thinking, and waiting around on the sidelines and not being part of that transformation is a deeply lousy strategy: get a plan together and then just go do stuff.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;All right, Andy, we&#39;ve run a little bit long, so we&#39;re going to cut you off here. I could talk all day with you about all these topics, and our audience is clearly into it and engaged. Thank you very much for being on the show.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ANDREW MCAFEE:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Adi, always a pleasure. Thank you for having me.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 16 Sep 2023 01:25:02 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[A More Impactful Strategy for Sustainable Investing]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/09/a-more-impactful-strategy-for-sustainable-investing]]><description>&lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/09/Sept23_15_1589828250.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;Hiroshi Watanabe/Getty Images&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;The effectiveness of sustainable investing has been challenged, with critics like Tariq Fancy describing it as a mere placebo. Amidst rising skepticism and stricter disclosure requirements, a deeper dive reveals that traditional methods of influencing companies, namely &amp;#8220;voice&amp;#8221; (shareholder engagement) and &amp;#8220;exit&amp;#8221; (portfolio screening), are not exhaustive. Through a comprehensive review of over 3,500 research papers, a new approach &amp;#8212; &amp;#8220;field building&amp;#8221; &amp;#8212; emerges. This tactic acknowledges the interconnected web of stakeholders around companies, termed &amp;#8220;fields&amp;#8221;, that profoundly influence corporate behavior. By reshaping these fields, investors can indirectly drive sustainable change in firms. Five tactics are highlighted: (1) Shifting other investors&amp;#8217; evaluation of issues, (2) Sharing expertise, (3) Delegitimizing certain business activities, (4) Establishing voluntary standards, and (5) Supporting regulatory changes. While promising, field-building presents challenges like profitability and political exposure. Yet, by embracing this expanded toolkit, investors can magnify their positive impact and appeal to an increasingly conscious investment clientele.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/a-more-impactful-strategy-for-sustainable-investing?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/a-more-impactful-strategy-for-sustainable-investing?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;Whether sustainable investors can have a positive impact on business and society has been the center of debate in recent years. One major obstacle holding sustainable investing back from maximizing its impact is that most investors operate with too narrow of an understanding of how impact can come about. Most investors believe they have two primary ways to influence companies. First, there&#39;s portfolio screening, often termed “exit.” In this approach, investors shift capital from non-sustainable to sustainable companies. The second strategy is shareholder engagement, frequently called “voice.” Here, investors directly urge companies to adopt more sustainable practices through means like meetings, shareholder proposals, or voting.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But in our research, we have found that some unconventional investors go beyond the “exit” versus “voice” dichotomy. We have mapped their activities through a &lt;a href=&quot;https://eur03.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fonlinelibrary.wiley.com%2Fdoi%2Fepdf%2F10.1111%2Fjoms.12957&amp;amp;data=05%7C01%7Cmarti%40rsm.nl%7C5617faa4f4e6474822f608dbae59fdb1%7C715902d6f63e4b8d929b4bb170bad492%7C0%7C0%7C638295474207071901%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=qcr%2FaLPS2qF%2FkUPnG%2FDtSQEMQjLx0nl%2BrNN2UuL8oD8%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0&quot;>;systematic review of research&lt;/a>; for which we screened more than 3,500 research papers on sustainable investing. Based on this review and conversations we&#39;ve had with practitioners, we put forth a case for a third, potentially more impactful sustainable investing strategy: &lt;em>;field building.&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Field building works because companies are always embedded in fields. The term “fields” is closely related to industries, but broader. Fields encompass both companies (eg, oil and gas companies) and the stakeholders with which companies interact most frequently (eg, investors, regulators, or media). Through these interactions, actors within fields develop assumptions, norms, and rules that shape the behavior of companies within a field. In short, a field captures those parts of the external environment of a company that have the most direct influence on a company. Field building means that investors influence companies by changing the (1) stakeholders and (2) assumptions, norms, and rules that surround companies, thereby exerting their influence on companies indirectly.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We have found five tactics for field building that sustainable investors can use to increase their impact.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Shifting other investors&#39; evaluation of issues&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;As a first tactic for field building, investors can shift other investors&#39; evaluation of environmental and social issues. By publicly and continuously highlighting these environmental and social issues, an investor can raise attention to environmental and social issues among other investors and thereby motivate these other investors to influence companies.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This tactic is particularly relevant for investors that do not have enough assets under management or status to directly influence companies. By influencing larger investors with more direct influence on companies, investors can change the fields in which companies operate in ways that expose companies to more pressure for corporate sustainability.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Dutch shareholder “FollowThis” has used this first tactic very successfully since 2014 to influence oil and gas companies. FollowThis submits shareholder proposals on behalf of over 10,000 individuals who have bought shares of oil and gas companies. While FollowThis has neither the assets under management nor the elite status to be taken very seriously by oil and gas companies themselves, their approach has been very successful in influencing big Dutch pension funds. Some pension funds followed suit after their initial refusal to support FollowThis led to protests from beneficiaries and negative media attention — including ABP, the largest Dutch pension fund with over 500 billion Euro assets under management.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Sharing expertise with other investors&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;A second tactic for field building is to share expertise with other investors. Investors that are new to sustainable investing often struggle with the inherent complexity of environmental and social issues, and know neither what demands are realistic nor how to raise their demand in ways that make business sense for companies. By making private information publicly available, investors can empower other investors to influence companies. When other investors know more about sustainability, this creates additional pressure for corporate sustainability within the fields in which companies operate.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The international asset manager Robeco has used this tactic since August 2022, when it made its SDG framework openly accessible. This framework assesses the degree to which over 2,900 companies advance or undermine the 17 sustainable development goals (SDGs). Having used the framework internally since 2018, Robeco&#39;s decision to make their SDG framework open access not only establishes Robeco as a leader in that space. Access to this framework can help less experienced investors incorporate sustainability into their investment decisions.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Delegitimizing certain business activities&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;A third tactic for field building is to delegitimize business activities that are particularly harmful for the environment and society. Companies can only operate in fields in which key stakeholders — such as policymakers, consumers, suppliers, or the media — see their activities as legitimate. If these stakeholders start to see certain business activities as illegitimate, it can create existential problems for companies. Given these dynamics, investors that publicly problematize certain business activities can play a key role in changing widely shared assumptions about whether these business activities are legitimate or not.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Investors within the fossil fuel divestment movement have used this tactic very successfully. Since 2012, over 1,500 investors have publicly announced they would divest from fossil fuel companies, including the city of Chicago in 2022 and the Church of England in 2023. Proponents of the divestment movement make clear that, “&lt;a href=&quot;https://eur03.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgofossilfree.org%2Fusa%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2015%2F03%2FFossilFreeFrequentlyAskedQuestions.pdf&amp;amp;data=05%7C01%7Cmarti%40rsm.nl%7C5617faa4f4e6474822f608dbae59fdb1%7C715902d6f63e4b8d929b4bb170bad492%7C0%7C0%7C638295474207071901%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=AQBOvhTOgqMHpVyU1VprefUIR%2Foa%2BwCWQxS8Ns1s31g%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0&quot;>;Divestment isn&#39;t primarily an economic strategy, but a moral and political one&lt;/a>;.” They realize that their main influence does not come from increasing the cost of capital of fossil fuel companies in the short term, but by gradually changing public opinion about fossil fuel companies. Research shows that the divestment movement has influenced the views and actions of important stakeholders, including banks that have withheld credit from fossil fuel companies and students who have committed to not work for fossil fuel companies.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Establishing voluntary standards&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;A fourth tactic for field building is to establish voluntary sustainability standards. Voluntary standards have become a central instrument to advance corporate sustainability. They include codes of conduct, certification standards, and reporting standards, and may focus on single fields (eg, Equator Principles for project financing) or multiple fields (eg, the GRI reporting standard). Investors have played a major role in establishing voluntary standards, and have thereby reshaped the rules of the fields in which companies operate.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Investors that are active in the “Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures” have employed this tactic. Biodiversity loss and other nature-related risks are complex challenges, and many companies have little expertise on how to address them. Since 2020, investors have used the Taskforce to develop voluntary standards for corporate reporting on how companies harm nature and how nature creates risks for companies. After extensive stakeholder dialogue, pilot testing, and industry feedback, the Taskforce will release its final version in September 2023, which we expect will transform the nature-related parts of sustainability reporting.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Supporting regulatory changes&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;The fifth and final tactic for field building is to support regulatory changes that set mandatory standards for corporate sustainability. Once multiple companies within a field voluntarily engage in a sustainability-related activity, and thereby prove that such activities are technically and financially viable, regulatory interventions may be necessary to force laggard companies to follow suit. Following this logic, the number of laws related to corporate sustainability has &lt;a href=&quot;https://eur03.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.unpri.org%2Fpolicy%2Fregulation-database&amp;amp;data=05%7C01%7Cmarti%40rsm.nl%7C5617faa4f4e6474822f608dbae59fdb1%7C715902d6f63e4b8d929b4bb170bad492%7C0%7C0%7C638295474207071901%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=ZU3kycbEnn1GGmNwOIEHqUZNY11kMLAbEez1q7CfgcM%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0&quot;>;almost tripled between 2013 and 2023&lt;/a>;, from around 300 to almost 900. Given their investments in different types of companies, investors can provide valuable insights to policymakers and regulators about regulatory changes that seek to advance corporate sustainability.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some investors have used this tactic to shape the upcoming European Sustainability Reporting Standards, which will be mandatory for all companies operating in the European Union from 2028 onwards. While the April 2022 draft of this law contained strict disclosure requirements, the number of disclosure requirements were weakened in a subsequent draft due to pushback from companies. In February 2023, eleven investors and several sustainable investing industry associations wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;https://eur03.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdp.net%2Fen%2Farticles%2Fcompanies%2F60-companies-and-investors-worth-651bn-tell-eu-to-agree-ambitious-sustainability-reporting-standards&amp;amp;data=05%7C01%7Cmarti%40rsm.nl%7C5617faa4f4e6474822f608dbae59fdb1%7C715902d6f63e4b8d929b4bb170bad492%7C0%7C0%7C638295474207071901%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=dR4a7ipqlhcBhrCvxZCvnS4Td9USAyRarHM%2FEP%2FZJq8%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0&quot;>;public letter&lt;/a>; to policymakers of the European Union in which they urged policymakers to go back to strict disclosure requirement to “ensure a level playing field… for companies that already contribute to a nature-positive economy.”&lt;/p>; &lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;. 。 .&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Each of the five tactics can change the fields in which companies operate, thereby creating additional pressure for companies to become more sustainable. Despite these opportunities for increasing their impact, two reasons may deter investors from venturing into field building.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One reason is profitability. It can be difficult to make a business case for field building over the short term. Field building mostly generates costs for an investor, while benefits will be captured by other investors, including those in the future. Yet, given that many individuals are willing to accept lower returns if their investments create greater impact, they may seek out asset managers that engage in field building even if higher management fees slightly lower their returns.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another reason is political exposure. Field building requires that asset managers publicly take a stance on sustainability issues, which could lead to backlash by people with different views — a risk that is higher among asset managers that cater to a wide range of customers. These asset managers can limit this risk by doing field building on sustainability issues for which a broad consensus exists among their customers and that are backed by a strong business case.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;By broadening their toolbox of tactics, and mastering field building, investors can better position themselves to have a more positive impact on the environment and society — and, in doing so, attract more individual investors that care about impact.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 15 Sep 2023 23:25:02 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
