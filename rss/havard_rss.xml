&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/10/a-new-approach-to-writing-job-descriptions?language=es&quot;>;阅读西班牙语&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/ 10/a-new-approach-to-writing-job-descriptions?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;今天的工作是&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.weforum .org/reports/the-future-of-jobs-report-2023/&quot;>;变化很快&lt;/a>;，传统的职位描述已经跟不上。随着新技术扰乱流程并需要新技能，并且随着公司越来越多地转向基于项目的工作，我们开始看到工作描述从跟随员工多年的静态、整体规定演变为动态指导，根据需求进行更改。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;例如，一家雇用员工执行一组特定任务的公司可能会发现四个月后，另一组不同的任务占据了战略优先级。即使该员工拥有完成新任务的正确技能，该员工也可以根据自己的工作描述拒绝执行新任务，说这不是他们受雇要做的事情，或者如果他们接受了新任务任务，他们的工作描述很快就会过时。&lt;/p>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;p>;本文是第 15 届年度报告主题“创意韧性：在不连续时代的领导”系列文章中的一篇&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.druckerforum.org/&quot;>;全球彼得德鲁克论坛。&lt;/a>;查看会议日程&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.druckerforum.org/2023/program/&quot; >;这里&lt;/a>;。 &lt;/p>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;由于大多数职位描述都牢牢地嵌入员工的核心工作领域，因此它们也往往会阻碍跨职能协作，从而鼓励组织中出现孤岛。僵化的职位描述也会阻碍对新技术的尝试，而这些技术在撰写描述时可能是不可想象的。最后，狭隘的职位描述可能意味着员工无法在工作中充分发挥自己的才能，从而使他们不满意。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;作为回应，公司开始以新的、基于结果、技能和团队的更灵活的方式。我将依次描述其中每一个，但首先让我们看看职位描述是如何成为我们今天所知道的，以及它们的作用。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;为什么要职位描述？&lt;/h2>; &lt;p >;现代职位描述可以追溯到工业革命。随着工厂和其他大型组织变得越来越普遍，需要更清晰地定义角色和职责，以提高效率和生产力。这导致了标准化职位名称和描述的创建，其中概述了每个职位的任务、职责和要求。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;到了 20 世纪中叶，它们变得更加正式和详细。&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;如今，职位描述有多种用途：&lt;/p>; &lt;ol>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;招聘&lt;/strong>;：通过提供清晰的大纲，帮助潜在申请人了解他们是否适合该职位角色涉及的内容以及需要哪些技能和资格。&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;角色澄清&lt;/strong>;：它们有助于澄清角色的职责、任务和期望，有助于避免角色模糊和冲突。&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;绩效管理&lt;/strong>;：作为评估员工绩效的基准。&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;人力资源管理&lt;/strong>;：帮助规划员工开发、设定薪酬并作为法律文件。&lt;/li>; &lt;/ol>; &lt;p>;那么如何使职位描述更加灵活，同时仍然满足这些需求？&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;更多-灵活的方法&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;随着公司努力应对快速变化的、基于项目的角色，我们看到三种新方法正在流行。&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;&lt;strong>;以结果为中心的角色描述&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;一些公司开始阐明角色的预期成果，而不是员工需要履行的具体任务或职责。这种方法为员工提供了灵活性，让他们可以确定实现这些结果的最佳方式，从而促进创新和主动性，重要的是，允许他们随着情况的变化而改变自己的方法。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;例如，而不是销售经理的方法职位描述列出了诸如“每季度与主要客户会面一次”或“每月准备销售报告”等任务，它会描述诸如“将区域销售额提高 15%”和“将客户保留率提高 10%”等结果。&lt; /p>; &lt;p>;Google 使用以结果为导向的职位描述来激励顶尖人才。前人力运营高级副总裁 Laszlo Bock &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Work-Rules-Insights-Inside-Transform/dp/1455554790&quot;>;解释&lt;/a>;： “在谷歌，我们相信以结果为导向的职位描述对于吸引和留住顶尖人才至关重要。当员工知道对他们的期望以及如何衡量他们时，他们更有可能受到激励并投入到工作中。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;例如，传统上，设计伦理学家的职位描述可能会列出分析谷歌的搜索算法每月一次进行偏见，或保持最新的隐私风险日志。但在基于结果的职位描述中，设计伦理学家被赋予了更广泛的任务，即识别谷歌产品中的道德风险或制定产品道德设计指南。这为员工和 Google 提供了余地，让设计伦理学家的具体任务能够随着技术的发展而改变——例如，生成式人工智能被引入到 Google 的产品中。&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;以技能为中心的角色描述&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;其他公司会创建动态文档，概述员工为某个职位带来的技能和能力或应该发展的技能和能力。通过这种方法，重点从一个人应该完成的任务转移到他们的才能以及如何在公司项目中应用这些才能。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;对于公司来说，执行这种方法意味着确定技能和资格每个角色所需的技能，并制定帮助员工培养这些技能的培训计划和职业道路。目的是充分利用和发展个人的能力和优势，从而提高工作满意度和绩效。这还意味着公司可以快速组建具有处理特定项目或计划所需技能和经验的人员团队。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;例如，具有卓越可视化技能的数据分析师可以从创建复杂的数据模型无缝转变为根据项目需求制作可视化报告。分析师将遵循专门的培训方案，以增强特定技能，例如高级可视化技术和数据故事讲述。通过关注分析师的独特优势和更广泛的技能，组织不仅可以磨练他们现有的专业知识，还可以培养出更加全面、多才多艺的专业人员。&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;基于团队的角色描述&lt;/h3>; &lt;p >;最后，一些公司不是为每个团队成员提供工作描述，而是将个人分配到具有一组集体目标、成果和可交付成果的团队。然后由团队集体决定每个成员将如何做出贡献。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一个众所周知的例子是 Spotify，其中员工是小型跨职能团队的一部分，称为“小队”，每个团队都有特定的使命。每个小队依靠集体决策以及对每个成员的优势和偏好的深入了解，自主决定如何最好地实现其目标。团队经常开会讨论挑战，评估进度，重新调整目标，并解决任务分配导致的任何冲突或瓶颈。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;克服挑战&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;除了简单地抵制变革之外，还有摆脱传统职位描述的公司需要解决许多挑战。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;最基本的是工作和绩效期望不明确。如果没有传统的职位描述，员工如何知道对他们的期望是什么？在没有明确指导方针的情况下，经理如何客观地评估他们的绩效并遵循公平的薪酬和晋升实践？每个人负责什么。例如，假设您管理着一个软件开发人员团队，并且您的公司正在转向基于团队的职位描述。您可以与您的团队合作创建一个技能矩阵，以确定每个团队成员的技能和能力，然后使用敏捷方法或看板等工具来帮助管理工作负载并确定任务的优先级。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;对于招聘，与传统面试相比，基于能力的面试流程是评估候选人是否适合灵活、动态角色的更有效方法，传统面试通常侧重于候选人的经验和资格。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;对于绩效评估，可以使用诸如360 度反馈可以帮助经理评估员工在各个领域的表现，包括他们的技能、能力和对团队的贡献。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;更棘手的问题可能包括法律合规性，例如《公平劳动标准法》 (FLSA) 在美国的职位状况——如果没有正式的职位描述，这可能会具有挑战性。为每位员工创建一份“角色合规性文件”，提供工作的大致轮廓和工作分类（豁免或非豁免）等详细信息，可以在这方面有所帮助。此外，监控员工的任务、职责和实际工作时间，以确保它们符合劳工准则；根据您的具体情况，这可能是由现代人力资源软件支持的定期审查或细致的记录保存。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;随着组织变得更加敏捷和响应能力更强，并且技术在未来几年支持新的工作形式，这一趋势基于项目的工作以及对更灵活的职位描述的需求将继续存在。这种彻底的颠覆需要思维方式和文化的转变，并要求个人、管理者、领导者和组织尝试、学习和适应新的工作方法。但是，有了正确的思维方式和方法，就可以打造一个更加敏捷、反应灵敏和创新的组织，更好地应对未来的挑战。&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- 引用 -->;

&lt;span>;&lt;p>;如果您想给同事留下好印象并了解同事对您的真实看法，你们应该当面见面还是通过视频会议？这是作者在研究中探讨的问题。答案很大程度上取决于您是否对社交互动感到焦虑。我们大多数人都知道即使是最有社交自信的人有时我们会比平时感到更加社交焦虑。在这些情况下，在 Zoom 上召开会议可能会创造公平的竞争环境，让您像感觉更安全的人一样了解自己的印象。简而言之，Zoom 可能会给每个人一个平等的机会来充分管理他们想要传达的印象，这对团队领导者及其员工都有重要影响。&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/10/research-can-you-tell-how-you-come-across-on-zoom?language=es&quot;>;阅读西班牙语&lt;/a>; &lt; br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/10/research-can-you-tell-how-you-come-across-on-zoom?language=pt&quot;>;葡萄牙语&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p >;您刚刚开始一份新工作。您可能特别好奇您在办公室的声誉以及您给同事留下的印象。人们认为你聪明又友善吗？不可避免的是，我们都关心自己给别人的印象。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我们如此关心人们对我们的看法的一个原因是，它为印象管理奠定了基础。例如，如果您在第一次项目会议期间意识到您的新同事认为您无能，那么您就有机会纠正这种误解，这可以通过强调您独特的技能与您正在从事的项目的相关性来实现一起。或者，如果你错过了这个提示，你可能无法管理他们对你的印象，在你意识到之前，你在工作场所的声誉可能会具体化。简而言之，了解我们给他人的印象是关键的一步顺利地进行我们的专业和社交互动。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;现在我们处于一个混合世界，这些互动可能会像面对面一样通过视频会议进行，并且您可能会可以自由选择是通过虚拟方式还是面对面与同事见面。因此，以下是我们通过研究来回答的问题：如果您想了解新同事对您的真实看法，您应该选择哪一个？您是现场还是 Zoom 上的更好的印象经理？&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;研究&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;在我们的 &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi= 10.1037%2Fpspp0000457&quot;>;研究&lt;/a>;，我们测试了这两个假设中哪一个占上风。为此，我们在 Covid-19 大流行之前有 305 人进入我们的实验室（以 4 到 8 人为一组），在大流行期间有 555 人参加 Zoom 会议（同样以 3 到 9 人为一组）。人们会与新朋友一对一地会面几分钟，就像在快速社交活动中一样。这总共产生了 1,683 次独特的面对面互动和 3,068 次独特的 Zoom 互动。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;每次会议结束后，他们都会报告如何看待彼此的个性。例如，他们会被问到：“你认为这个人聪明到什么程度？”重要的是，我们还要求他们评价他们的互动伙伴如何看待他们：“这个人认为我聪明吗？”&lt;/p>; &lt;article-promo>; &lt;hbr-component type=&quot;promo&quot; is-insight= &quot;insight-center&quot; title=&quot;工作的未来&quot; dek=&quot;您的公司会适应还是被抛在后面？&quot; cta-text=&quot;&quot; href=&quot;/insight-center/the-future-of-work&quot;>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/insight-center/the-future-of-work&quot; style=&quot;color:black ;text-decoration:none&quot;>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; 洞察中心集合 &lt;/div>; &lt;h3>;工作的未来&lt;/h3>; &lt;div>; 您的公司会适应还是被抛在后面？ &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hbr-component>; &lt;/article-promo>; &lt;p>;事实证明，人们很擅长在仅仅两岁之后就知道自己给别人留下怎样的印象。分钟互动。重要的是，他们对 Zoom 的第一印象与面对面的第一印象同样准确。在这两种情况下，人们都可以判断出他们的同伴是否认为他们非常聪明而不那么友好。换句话说，我们的研究表明，人们能够像面对面一样了解自己在 Zoom 上给同事或新认识的人留下的印象。换句话说，在 Zoom 上互动似乎不会干扰人们了解自己声誉的能力。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;此外，了解您在 Zoom 上留下的印象与更受他人喜欢有关，因为它在-人。换句话说，了解自己给别人的印象如何，在 Zoom 互动中与面对面互动同样具有社交益处。因此，在 Zoom 上了解他人对我们的印象似乎与面对面的操作方式相同，并具有相同的好处。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;总而言之，这对于您与您的下一次互动意味着什么？新同事？在决定通过 Zoom 与他们见面之前，您是否应该三思而后行？与我们的一些外行观念相反，至少在印象管理方面，视频会议（相对于面对面会议）的决定可能不会对大多数人产生巨大的后果。但这对每个人来说都是如此吗？&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3260965/&quot;>;研究表明&lt;/a>;感到更加社交焦虑 在网上感觉比面对面更舒服。通过更加舒适，他们可能会更少担心，并且能够更好地评估他们在 Zoom 上的印象。事实上，在我们的面对面活动中，更多社交焦虑的人不太意识到自己给人留下的印象（与更有安全感的人相比）。但在 Zoom 上，这个缺点消失了：焦虑程度较高的人和不那么焦虑的人都同样意识到自己给他人留下的印象。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但这是否意味着 Zoom 帮助了社交焦虑者并伤害了安全感？看起来它是两者的混合体。 Zoom 似乎&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ilr.cornell.edu/news/research/zooming-socially-anxious-research-offers-insights&quot;>;给社交焦虑者带来了一点推动&lt;/a>;，让他们知道自己的感受如何，也许是因为他们在 Zoom 上更舒服，或者因为他们可以通过自检功能监控自己。但与此同时，Zoom 阻碍了更安全的人检测他们的遭遇的能力。也许拥有自我查看功能会让他们感到不自在，这可能会分散注意力。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;回到我们的主要问题：如果您愿意，您应该在 Zoom 上还是亲自计划下一次会议衡量同事对你的真实看法？这个问题的答案很大程度上取决于您对互动的感受以及您是否对此感到焦虑。我们大多数人——即使是最有社交自信的人——也会有比平常更焦虑的时刻。在这些情况下，在 Zoom 上召开会议可能会创造公平的竞争环境，让您像感觉更安全的人一样了解自己的印象。简而言之，Zoom 可能会给每个人一个平等的机会来充分管理他们想要传达的印象。这对团队领导者及其员工都有重要影响。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;影响&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;如果团队领导者意识到某些团队成员可能会因为特定的背景而感到更加社交焦虑或个性风格，安排视频电话会议而不是面对面的会议可能会有所帮助。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这并不是说长期解决方案是避免面对面的互动。然而，在增强社交信心以更顺利地进行面对面会议的同时，更多社交焦虑的人可能会从偶尔使用 Zoom 中受益——尤其是第一印象。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;员工现在可以感受到更多放心地知道视频会议不会损害他们的印象管理能力。这意味着，他们不必花精力担心人们是否能在 Zoom 上“理解”他们，而是可以更多地关注会议内容并积极参与团队的想法，从而最终给人留下更好的印象。&lt;/p >; &lt;p>;总的来说，尤其是如果您感到更加社交焦虑时，偶尔缩放一下可能只是您需要的一种推动，以重新控制您在办公室的声誉。&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- 引用 - ->;

&lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;摘要。&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;在美国，过去 15 年的大部分时间里短期利率都接近于零。由于资本成本如此之低，许多管理者很少关注资金的时间价值——资金的时间价值。进行财务分析的一个基本概念。现在，随着短期利率超过 5%，年长的管理者需要抛开他们对资本成本如何影响投资前景的本能感觉——年轻一代的管理者需要第一次学习这些技能。&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/10 /managers-need-to-relearn-how-interest-rates-work?language=es&quot;>;阅读西班牙语&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/10/managers-need-to-relearn- how-interest-rates-work?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;想象一个星球，有人关闭重力 15 年。在这段时间里，人们习惯了轻松地四处飞行。但随后重力突然恢复。那些习惯于到处飞翔的人现在需要在地面上过着沉重的生活，并重新学习行走等基本技能。步行似乎是一项基本活动，但如果人们 15 年不这样做，肌肉记忆就会消失。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这种情况类似于利率接近于零大约 15 年的影响，那么突然增加到5%的范围。十五年对于商业生涯来说是一段很长的时间。适应这种新的利率环境将需要管理者和投资者的行为和心态发生重大转变。年长的管理者需要重建他们曾经对诸如&lt;a href=&quot;https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/valuation/hurdle-rate-definition/&quot;>;门槛率&lt;/a>;和&lt; a href=&quot;https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dcf.asp&quot;>;贴现现金流&lt;/a>;——而年轻一代，即2008年之后进入劳动力市场的人，需要培养一种本能从头开始感受这些概念。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;后一组人可能会对一个简单的事实感到惊讶：短期利率通常不会接近于零。但在 2008 年，为了应对&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007%E2%80%932008_financial_crisis&quot;>;全球金融危机&lt;/a>;，美联储大幅降低了联邦储备金基金利率来提振经济，实施所谓的“零利率政策”（ZIRP）。即使经济从 2008 年的衰退中复苏，美联储仍长期保持低利率，并在 Covid-19 大流行期间恢复了这一政策。因此，从 2008 年到 2015 年，美国的短期利率&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.macrotrends.net/2015/fed-funds-rate-historical-chart&quot;>;接近于零&lt;/a>; 2016 年，然后是 2020 年和 2021 年的大部分时间。在过去 15 年里，他们只在 2018 年和 2019 年的短暂时间内超过 2%。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但现在已经是 2023 年了，ZIRP 已经结束了。基准联邦基金利率目前&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/fed-funds-rate-history/&quot;>;高于 5.25%&lt;/a>;。五年期、十年期和三十年期美国国债现已全部&lt;a href=&quot;https://home.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/interest-rates/TextView?type=daily_treasury_yield_curve&amp;amp;field_tdr_date_value =2023&quot;>;收益率接近 5%&lt;/a>;，这是很长一段时间以来的最高水平。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;接近于零的利率水平、维持在这一水平的年数以及从那时起，它们的上升速度——所有这一切本质上都是前所未有的。但“前所未有”这个词最近被过度使用，因此管理者可能会陷入呆滞状态，没有意识到这与平常的业务有多么大的偏差。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;那将是一个错误。这种利率变化是一个地震事件，影响任何涉及多年现金流的业务决策。 &lt;a href=&quot;https://buffett.cnbc.com/video/2013/05/04/morning-session---2013-berkshire -hathaway-annual-meeting.html?&amp;amp;start=4028&amp;amp;end=4343&quot;>;沃伦·巴菲特的话&lt;/a>;。 “它们为经济领域的一切提供动力。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;对于不习惯自然考虑时间价值的管理者来说在决定进行哪些项目或投资时，缺乏资金&lt;/a>;或&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/costofcapital.asp&quot;>;资本成本&lt;/a>;意识到这些概念的重要性可能会导致危险的错误结论。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;证明这一点的一个简单方法是使用我在战略咨询公司工作时第一次遇到的思想实验。这是咨询公司有时在工作面试中使用的问题类型，旨在了解候选人的想法。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;假设一个场景：&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;您将乘坐火车前往未来五年内每个工作日下班。&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;每次乘坐火车往返都需要一个代币。&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;目前每次往返（往返）代币的费用为 1 美元。 ）。&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;明天，价格将上涨至 1.20 美元——未来五年内都会保持在这个水平。&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;在价格上涨之前，您可以购买尽可能多的代币您想要以今天 1 美元的价格购买代币。&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;只有您可以使用您购买的代币，不得转售。&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;问题是：您以今天的价格购买多少代币在价格永久上涨到 1.20 美元之前，价格为 1 美元？&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;许多人都从一种看起来足够直观的方法开始：我应该购买我能买得起的尽可能多的代币，最多可达五年的价值。事实上，这似乎是一件理所当然的事情，是一项有保证、无风险回报的交易。如果您知道您将需要 1,250 个代币（假设五年内每年 250 次通勤），并且您知道如果您现在不购买代币，其成本将增加 20%，那么为什么不今天购买 1,250 个代币 — 并享受 250 美元的节省呢？ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;有些人试图更准确：如何考虑假期和病假？我应该适应新冠疫情后的“周五在家工作”政策吗？每年 250 次通勤是正确的数字还是可能更低？等等。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;那些走这条路的人可能会得到正确的数学结果。但他们没有进行正确的计算。事实上，正确的第一个问题是：我还能用我的钱做什么？&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在咨询式面试中，提出这个问题的人被告知：a) 他们可以将钱投入年利率为 10% 的银行储蓄账户； b) 这是他们唯一的投资选择；最后c) 无需担心税收、交易成本、银行倒闭、通货膨胀等。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;现在怎么办？让我们看看银行里的 1 美元会怎样。一年后，它增长到 1.10 美元。两年后，它增长到 1.21 美元——略高于新的代币价格。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这种认识到金钱具有时间价值这一事实的思维方式会导致不同的答案：你应该购买两个多年的代币价值。今天花的钱买的东西比这个多的话存入银行复利会更好。然后您可以在将来需要购买代币时提取它。随着时间的推移，这会让你比预先购买所有代币更好 - 这一切都是因为货币的时间价值。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这个非常简单的想法 - 货币的时间价值 - 是常见金融概念的基础，例如&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/npv.asp&quot;>;净现值&lt;/a>; (NPV) 或&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.investopedia.com/ terms/d/dcf.asp&quot;>;贴现现金流&lt;/a>; (DCF)。然而，即使是擅长构建复杂电子表格来精确计算 NPV 和 DCF 数据（例如，用于项目融资或资产评估模型）的人也经常被地铁代币问题所困扰。他们知道如何将折扣率代入公式，但他们本能地不知道如何将其应用到日常情况中。对于 2008 年之后 ZIRP 时代进入职业界的人来说尤其如此。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我不责怪他们。当银行账户支付有意义的利息之类的事情还没有成为一个人生活经历的一部分时，很难对货币的时间价值形成实际的直觉。事实上，如果利率为零，货币就没有时间价值。在这样的世界中，可以说，购买所有可以购买的代币是有意义的——以此类推，为所有项目提供资金、收购所有初创公司、雇用所有候选人、购买所有房地产等等也是有意义的。&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;但利率不再为零。并且，再次借用 &lt;a href=&quot;https://buffett.cnbc.com/video/1994/04/25/when-interest-rates-matter--and-when-they-dont.html&quot;>;沃伦·巴菲特的一句话&lt;/a>;：“每个企业的价值……任何经济资产的价值都对利率 100% 敏感。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;考虑到这一点，任何涉及多个方面的战略或财务决策必须根据新的、现实的资本成本假设重新审查年度现金流量。由于与长期以来相比，目前的资本成本已大幅上升，更新的数学结果可能表明，立即采取措施提高盈利能力、现金流和资本效率将&lt;a href=&quot;/2023/03/资本现在再次昂贵“比旨在实现未来几年增长的投资增加更多价值”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;修正上述数学是一个必要的开始。修复过去 15 年形成的制度化管理思维可能同样重要。尤其是在近零利率的推动下，&lt;a href=&quot;/2023/01/allocing-capital-when-interest-rates-are-high&quot;>;“登月”思维风靡一时&lt;/ a>;

&lt;span>;&lt;p>;Onboarding new suppliers has long been a time-consuming and expensive process. But a new blockchain-based platform that is open to everyone can streamline this crucial activity. The early results are promising.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/10/a-remedy-for-the-supplier-onboarding-problem?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/10/a-remedy-for-the-supplier-onboarding-problem?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;Supplier onboarding — the process of collecting the information and data required to set up an organization as an approved supplier — is essential to do, but no one likes to do it. It is not uncommon for it to take a month to onboard a new supplier and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ismworld.org/supply-management-news-and-reports/news-publications/inside-supply-management-magazine/blog/2021/2021-03/the-monthly-metric-time-to-on-board-a-new-supplier/&quot;>;can take up to six months&lt;/a>; at many large organizations.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Whether 30 days or six months, the pain and delay stem from manual processes that buying organizations use to vet supplier data and documentation such as ISO certifications, bank account information, tax documents, and certificates of insurance. While frustrating, the work is foundational to ensuring new suppliers comply with relevant laws, regulations, and corporate standards.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Several digital solutions such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hicx.com/&quot;>;HICX&lt;/a>; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.suppliergateway.com/buyers/supplier-risk-management/?utm_term=vendor%20onboarding&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Supplier+Onboarding-+Search&amp;amp;utm_source=adwords&amp;amp;utm_medium=ppc&amp;amp;hsa_acc=7955359281&amp;amp;hsa_cam=19906339380&amp;amp;hsa_grp=148406702315&amp;amp;hsa_ad=653033066318&amp;amp;hsa_src=g&amp;amp;hsa_tgt=kwd-299767053962&amp;amp;hsa_kw=vendor%20onboarding&amp;amp;hsa_mt=b&amp;amp;hsa_net=adwords&amp;amp;hsa_ver=3&amp;amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMIjfby3Je1gQMVJiCtBh2Kmw6iEAAYAyAAEgJ3zPD_BwE&quot;>;Supplier Gateway&lt;/a>; have emerged to help buying organizations solve the supplier onboarding problem. However, while they automate and make the supplier onboarding experience easier, suppliers still have to go through an onboarding process with each customer. For suppliers with hundreds (or even thousands) of customers, the digital process is better but still far from ideal.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We&#39;ve examined a potentially better solution: A more holistic supply chain platform approach that helps streamline work across a supply chain ecosystem of trading partners. It&#39;s called &lt;a href=&quot;https://chainyard.com/solutions/trust-your-supplier/&quot;>;Trust Your Supplier&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;A Promising Remedy&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;The concept of supply chain platforms is not new. One example is Chinese appliance manufacturer &lt;a href=&quot;/2022/07/how-to-turn-a-supply-chain-platform-into-an-innovation-engine&quot;>;Haier&#39;s COSMOPlat&lt;/a>; (which stands for Cloud of Smart Manufacturing Operation Platform). It has been used to increase collaboration and streamline operations ranging from innovation and design to supplying materials and components to solving technical problems and providing new services. While Haier could have just developed the solution to meet the needs of working with its own suppliers, it chose to take a platform approach and open the solution.&lt;/p>; &lt;article-promo>; &lt;hbr-component type=&quot;promo&quot; is-insight=&quot;insight-center&quot; title=&quot;The New Age of Operations&quot; dek=&quot;Improving efficiency and increasing resilience.&quot; cta-text=&quot;&quot; href=&quot;/insight-center/the-new-age-of-operations&quot;>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/insight-center/the-new-age-of-operations&quot; style=&quot;color:black;text-decoration:none&quot;>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; Insight Center Collection &lt;/div>; &lt;h3>;The New Age of Operations&lt;/h3>; &lt;div>; Improving efficiency and increasing resilience. &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hbr-component>; &lt;/article-promo>; &lt;p>;Other examples are systems developed by Walmart to &lt;a href=&quot;/2022/11/how-walmart-automated-supplier-negotiations&quot;>;automate negotiations with smaller suppliers&lt;/a>; and to &lt;a href=&quot;/2022/01/how-walmart-canada-uses-blockchain-to-solve-supply-chain-challenges&quot;>;manage invoices from and payments to third-party freight carriers&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As part of our research at the University of Tennessee on highly collaborative business partnerships, we had the opportunity to study a creative strategic alliance between IBM and &lt;a href=&quot;https://chainyard.com/&quot;>;Chainyard&lt;/a>;, a digital transformation company that focuses on blockchain solutions. The strategic partnership caught our eye because the parties were teaming up to develop an industry- and company-agnostic platform solution to address supplier onboarding, compliance, and risk-management issues plaguing virtually all companies.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The result of the partnership: A &lt;a href=&quot;https://image-ppubs.uspto.gov/dirsearch-public/print/downloadPdf/11488271&quot;>;patent&lt;/a>; jointly held by both Chainyard and IBM and the formal launch of Trust Your Supplier (TYS), a blockchain network solution.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;An essential part of the vision was to create a true blockchain network that would allow a worldwide network of buyers and suppliers — not just IBM and its suppliers — to share trusted, standardized data. Today the TYS blockchain network includes 11 large purchasers (eg, American Express, BT, Lenovo, Nokia, Pearson, and Thermo Fisher) and over 100,000 fully vetted suppliers. In addition, more than 400 million other suppliers have some or a significant part of their data available on TYS through partnerships with third-party compliance organizations on the platform such as Moody&#39;s.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The TYS platform enables buyers and their suppliers to opt into the network. Suppliers create a single digital identity (ie, a “corporate wallet” or “digital passport”) to share with their customers that they can use over and over again without having to enter the data every time for a new customer or when an existing client is doing compliance checks.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The TYS platform is showing significant promise for both purchasers and suppliers:&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Purchasers&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;By eliminating redundant efforts and streamlining the process, some of the early-adopter purchasing organizations that have used TYS have reported cost savings of nearly $500 per supplier. For an enterprise with tens of thousands of suppliers, this can result in savings of eight figures in the overall management of their supplier base.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Suppliers&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;TYS has reduced the average supplier onboarding time to under a business week, an impressive average reduction of 67%. Once on the network, suppliers can be onboarded with additional companies almost instantly. Quicker supplier onboarding means not having to wait to start work after a deal is sold. And because suppliers manage and control their data only on the network, it eliminates the administrative burden of having to manage the same or similar data across multiple customers.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;A New Era&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;We believe a paradigm shift is occurring. Organizations will increasingly adopt platform solutions like COSMOPlat and TYS that will solve systemic supply chain issues for a vast number of players. Supply chain management will be transformed.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 05 Oct 2023 21:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Are We Seeing a Revival of Union Power?]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/10/are-we-seeing-a-revival-of-union-power]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/10/Oct23_05_1713785580.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;Mario Tama/Getty Images&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;After decades of decline, American unions are once again challenging employers and using strikes to fight for better contracts. For the first time in recent memory, unions are taking strong, militant stances &amp;#8212; and seem to be making major gains as a result. But how should this moment be understood, and what does it signal about the future of organized labor in the United States? In an interview with HBR, former National Labor Relations Board member Sharon Block explains the significance of new leadership, the legal landscape, and what lessons companies should take from what&amp;#8217;s happening right now.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/10/are-we-seeing-a-revival-of-union-power?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/10/are-we-seeing-a-revival-of-union-power?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;Over the past few months, the United States has seemingly entered a new era for American unions. After decades of decline, major American unions — including the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/22/business/economy/ups-contract-vote-teamsters.html&quot;>;Teamsters&lt;/a>;, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/article/uaw-strike-explained-ford-stellantis-gm.html&quot;>;United Automobile Workers&lt;/a>;, and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/story/2023-05-01/writers-strike-what-to-know-wga-guild-hollywood-productions&quot;>;Writers Guild of America&lt;/a>;, and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/article/actors-strike-why.html&quot;>;Screen Actors Guild&lt;/a>; — have taken militant stances in contract negotiations. Thus far, two have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thenation.com/article/society/teamsters-uaw-strike-votes/&quot;>;chalked up&lt;/a>; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/business/media/hollywoods-writers-emerge-from-strike-as-winnersfor-now-b6b002d3&quot;>;considerable victories&lt;/a>;. This week, workers at Kaiser Permanente walked off the job in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/health/healthcare/healthcare-worker-strike-kaiser-permanente-b404e9d5?st=tllvmqmhktor0jj&amp;amp;reflink=article_copyURL_share&quot;>;largest strike of health care workers in US history&lt;/a>;. All at once, it seems union power is on the rise again.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Where did this come from, and what does it mean? To answer this, HBR spoke with Sharon Block, a former member of the National Labor Relations Board, who is currently a Professor of Practice and Executive Director of the Center for Labor and a Just Economy at Harvard Law School. The following interview was conducted via Google docs.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;HBR: Right now, we&#39;re seeing a level of union action that feels unprecedented in recent memory: the Teamsters leveraged a very credible strike threat to win a new contract for UPS workers, Hollywood writers and actors have spent months on strike, and the United Auto Workers are striking against the Big Three automakers. Quickly, how did we get to this point?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Block: I think that there are a couple of trends driving this increased strike activity. First, the public&#39;s sympathies seem to be with workers. Unions are enjoying higher support among the public than they have in decades. That gives confidence to workers considering going out on strike. Also, I believe that unions are considering the leverage that the tight labor market gives them. They are highly motivated to negotiate advantageous contracts now, so they can lock in their enhanced power. Finally, many of the unions that have been engaged in these high profile labor actions are in sectors where big, transformational change is either just on the horizon or already here. For example, the Hollywood strikes have focused on what the impact of AI is going to be in their work and the UAW strike is in part about how the auto industry is going to transition to an EV future. Workers want to have a voice in how these transformations impact them – active unions give them a meaningful seat at the table as decisions are made that will define the future. That suggests to me that these strikes may go on for a while — workers may be celebrating “union victory autumn” for a while.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;When was the last time we saw organized labor flex this kind of muscle?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It has been generations since we have seen this kind of robust labor activity. I haven&#39;t seen this level of action in my career.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Why has it been so long?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The labor movement has been forced to play defense for a long time by trends in our economy, like the move from a manufacturing economy to a service economy, the increasing brazenness of employer opposition to unions and the weakness in our labor laws that often fail to protect workers engaged in collective action. The pandemic — and the huge profits that many corporations made during the pandemic — seems to have awoken a new commitment among workers — both in unions and not — to stand up to employers and demand what they believe they deserve. For workers in unions, that spirit seems to be driving increasing strike activity.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;One of the really striking things about this moment is the return of big strikes. The Teamsters didn&#39;t strike, but they seemingly came very close and claimed to win a good contract. Writers and actors, of course, did strike and the writers are claiming to have secured a lot of their demands. And the UAW is using a limited strike tactic — standup strikes — that&#39;s disruptive but also gives them the option to escalate. What&#39;s behind the return of the strike, and what are the implications of seeing these big strikes happening? Or, am I overstating this shift?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I don&#39;t think you are overstating this shift. The data shows that there has been more strike activity this year than we&#39;ve seen in a while. Again, I think some of this activity is being driven by a collective response to the pandemic in which workers are saying, “enough.” Many workers, including UPS drivers and factory workers like auto workers, put their lives on the line to continue to work during the pandemic. As a result, they generated big profits for their employers. They are now demanding their fair share of that success. In addition, I believe that success is contagious. Workers are inspiring each other.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;There&#39;s new leadership at both the Teamsters and the UAW, and both of them have promised more hard-knuckle tactics than their predecessors. What&#39;s the significance of this return to a more militant approach, and do you think we can expect to see more of this in the near future?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;My perspective is that the new leadership at the Teamsters and the UAW are very attuned to their members — I think in this moment their members want leaders who reflect their desire to stand up for their interests and demand what they believe they deserve. We can see this dynamic even among workers who aren&#39;t in unions — they have come out of the pandemic and into a tight labor market, amidst skyrocketing CEO pay and stock buybacks, demanding higher wages. The new leadership at the Teamsters and UAW are doing what good union leaders do — translating their members&#39; mood and interests into effective strategy to succeed at the bargaining table. Because success is contagious, I do believe that we will continue to see members and their leaders demanding their fair share loudly and proudly.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Earlier this year, the Biden administration passed legislation that stopped railroad workers from striking and forced a contract on them. This time, however, the president has promised to show up and walk the picket line with striking UAW workers. How do you understand the politics around organized labor right now? Is there any reason to think that the legal and political environment organized labor is working within might change?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;President Biden&#39;s decision to show up at the UAW Willow Ridge picket line was both unprecedented and unsurprising. President Biden has been saying repeatedly that he wants to be the most pro-union president in history. By visiting striking auto workers, he put his feet where his mouth has always been. In addition, it is important to remember that Biden was in the White House when the Obama-Biden Administration was part of asking the UAW to make incredible sacrifices to save the auto industry. So, it makes sense that now that he is in the White House again, he wants to stand with UAW workers as they ask to share in the companies&#39; success.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, Biden&#39;s visit gives him an opportunity to further define his vision for a clean energy future. This visit shows that in his vision, workers have to have a say in how this transformation to an EV future comes about.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I wish I could be more optimistic about the prospect for a change in the legal environment for labor. Before we will see significant labor law reform pass the US Congress, we will need a shift in our political environment. If President Biden and others who are supporting these strikes are rewarded by voters for their commitment to the labor movement, maybe we will see the political change we need to improve the prospect of the kind of labor law reform we need — like the kind of reforms that my colleague Ben Sachs and I proposed in our &lt;a href=&quot;https://clje.law.harvard.edu/clean-slate/&quot;>;Clean Slate for Worker Power project&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Despite hitting record lows in membership, there&#39;s been a big uptick in support for unions in recent years. But when I think of union actions, I mostly think about union drives at places like Amazon and Starbucks. How should we understand the significance of the recent actions by the Teamsters, UAW, etc.? And do they mean anything for other union / unionization efforts?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I believe that success breeds more success. Lots of workers are worrying about the future — is AI going to eliminate their jobs or is their boss using technology to spy on them at work, is climate change going to put them in danger on the job and are their companies going to prioritize stock buybacks over wage increases, leaving them unable to keep up with inflation. With the successful outcomes in so many of these strikes, workers are going to understand in a way maybe they haven&#39;t in a long time that unions are relevant to their lives — that they are a way to have a say in the future. I think all workers want the future to happen with them, not to them.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;So, as all of this unfolds, what are you watching for? What do you think the significant longer term effects of this moment might be?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, I&#39;m watching to see how the UAW strike resolves. If the companies and the union can find a way to successfully chart a path to an EV future that protects workers&#39; middle class wages, I hope that will quiet a lot of critics of this strike. I&#39;m also watching a number of campaigns at the state and local level to support innovative legislation that empowers workers. For example, here in Massachusetts SEIU is supporting legislation to create a collective bargaining system for rideshare drivers. In New York, organizations are supporting wage boards for nail salon workers. And California has created a new council, which includes representatives of workers, to set higher labor standards for fast food workers.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Are there lessons for companies that are watching this unfold? What should leaders be thinking about right now?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I hope that corporate leaders are rethinking the reflex to try to minimize labor costs at the expense of their relationship with their workforce. This summer&#39;s strikes are demonstrating that workers are willing and able to say “enough.” Companies can avoid a lot of public ill will and strife if they think about whether their workers are getting a fair share of the companies&#39; success before increasing CEO pay or embarking on yet another round of stock buybacks.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 05 Oct 2023 20:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[How Fintech Is Making Smaller Suppliers More Resilient]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/10/how-fintech-is-making-smaller-suppliers-more-resilient]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/10/Oct23_04_1193669057.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;tdub303/Getty Images&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;Historically, smaller, lower-tier suppliers have had trouble obtaining financing. New fintech platforms are changing that. They are making it easier for them to use assets such as approved invoices, inventories, and purchase orders to access financing from outside investors or focal companies.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/10/how-fintech-is-making-smaller-suppliers-more-resilient?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/10/how-fintech-is-making-smaller-suppliers-more-resilient?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) deeper in the supply chain often find themselves with many financial challenges. They are several layers away from giant &lt;a href=&quot;https://app.myeducator.com/reader/web/1713d/chapter01/mg6i2/#:~:text=Consider%20the%20following%20as%20you,away%20from%20the%20focal%20firm.&quot;>;focal companies&lt;/a>; like Unilever, Siemens, and Dell that can provide supply chain financing. Until now, all support programs that focal companies have provided, such as reverse factoring and dynamic discounting, were only available to their first-tier suppliers.&lt;strong>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Enter the next-generation financial technology companies such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://provenance.io/&quot;>;Provenance&lt;/a>;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sumup.com/en-us/&quot;>;SumUp&lt;/a>;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zeconomy.com/solutions&quot;>;Zeconomy&lt;/a>;. (One of us, Sam, is the founder and CEO of Zeconomy.) These “fintechs” have created game-changing platforms that help SMEs navigate these challenges and tap into previously inaccessible resources. By leveraging these platforms, SMEs can better manage their cash flows and enhance their business operations. Here&#39;s how.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;1. SME assets can now be digitized.&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;SMEs have three core assets that can be used to obtain financing: approved invoices, inventories, and purchase orders. Of these, organizations providing financing prefer approved invoices from larger companies; they are considered low risk because they mean the work has been completed and the shipment has been sent to the buying company. However, when these invoices come from fellow SMEs, financial institutions might consider them much riskier and cast a wary eye. The same is true of purchase orders from other SMEs and SMEs&#39; inventory.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Through the fintech platforms, these SME assets can now be digitized. Once they are, they can be traded in a digital marketplace to match specific asset types to the risk and return profiles of various investors. Similar to the way people playing fantasy football choose players from various teams, investors can assemble portfolios of SME assets. Previously unbankable SME assets can be bundled into diversified investment portfolios.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;2. Connectivity and efficiency are enhanced.&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;The underlying technology behind the fintech software platform is blockchain. It affords a way for SME assets to get digitally connected with large focal companies. This provides a number of benefits:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;Makes it possible for the focal companies to provide financing to these SMEs&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Reduces outside investors&#39; risks in lending to SMEs based on their assets&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Makes it easier for focal companies and first-tier suppliers to provide early payments to SMEs in return for discounts on their purchases from SMEs&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Allows SMEs to obtain better financing terms&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;What is more, the blockchain technology underpinning these transactions provides an added layer of security and transparency for the financial transaction while keeping the confidential and competitive data of suppliers private.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;3. AI provides cash-flow predictions.&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;The way fintech platforms can help SMEs manage their cash flows is nothing short of revolutionary. These platforms can automatically compile transactional data and use artificial intelligence (AI) to analyze SMEs&#39; transaction histories and make accurate forecasts of SMEs&#39; future cash flows. This data-driven approach empowers SMEs to optimize their working capital and make more informed decisions, mitigating their risk of insolvency.&lt;/p>; &lt;article-promo>; &lt;hbr-component type=&quot;promo&quot; is-insight=&quot;insight-center&quot; title=&quot;The New Age of Operations&quot; dek=&quot;Improving efficiency and increasing resilience.&quot; cta-text=&quot;&quot; href=&quot;/insight-center/the-new-age-of-operations&quot;>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/insight-center/the-new-age-of-operations&quot; style=&quot;color:black;text-decoration:none&quot;>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; Insight Center Collection &lt;/div>; &lt;h3>;The New Age of Operations&lt;/h3>; &lt;div>; Improving efficiency and increasing resilience. &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hbr-component>; &lt;/article-promo>; &lt;p>;Moreover, these cash flow predictions can give investors more confidence when deciding whether to provide SMEs with financing. For instance, suppose an SME supplier applied for a short-term loan. The fintech platform analyzes the loan application, sets appropriate loan limits, and suggests optimal repayment schedules — all backed by AI-generated cash flow predictions. The end result: The platforms allow SMEs to obtain better offers from more investors than has traditionally been the case.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fintech platforms offer new pathways for SME suppliers to access funds. By digitizing assets and leveraging technology, the platforms can increase SME suppliers&#39; liquidity and lower their cost of financing.

To reduce this collaboration overload, ask these four questions: Can we reduce structural complexity? Does our workflow make sense? Hasthe profusion of teams spiked employees&amp;#8217; microstress? And have we built a sense of purpose in our employees&amp;#8217; everyday interactions?&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/10/whats-fueling-burnout-in-your-organization?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/10/whats-fueling-burnout-in-your-organization?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;Organizations around the world are experiencing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gallup.com/workplace/349484/state-of-the-global-workplace.aspx#ite-506900&quot;>;unprecedented levels of burnout&lt;/a>;, which is creating a significant — and under-recognized — cost to organizations in the form of quiet quitting, reduced innovation, and even spiraling healthcare costs. Many people are quick to point to an increase in overall workload as the culprit. But our research shows that the work itself has not increased so much as the &lt;a href=&quot;/2021/09/collaboration-overload-is-sinking-productivity&quot;>;&lt;em>;collaborative demands&lt;/em>;&lt;/a>; of the work.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;By that, we mean the volume and frequency of the collaborations that people have to engage in to complete the work — what we call the collaborative footprint — have risen over the past decade and a half, bringing exponential opportunities for stress. This comes through the increased potential for misunderstanding, misalignment, and imbalances of workload and capacity, among other things. All of this combines to create a battering of everyday stresses.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One form of this stress is the one we call “microstress” — small moments of stress from interactions with colleagues that feel routine but whose cumulative toll is enormous. &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/02/the-hidden-toll-of-microstress&quot;>;Our research&lt;/a>; into high performers has made clear the destructive impact of unchecked microstress, both on individuals and on teams. At the team level, this form of stress propagates through networks and relationships.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It may seem challenging to find ways to reduce stress on teams that are overloaded with deliverables, but leaders have more tools at their disposal than they may realize. Instead of relying only on coaching on individual coping strategies, leaders can look for systemic improvement in the collective working environment. We have identified four overlooked collective strategies that leaders can implement for reducing microstress. Here are the four key questions you need to ask.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Can we reduce structural complexity? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;For decades organizations have been building organizational complexity — not only in expanding spans and layers in traditional hierarchical structures (expanding the number of direct reports to reduce layers between the front line and the C-suite), but also in moving to matrixed, networked, or other more agile ways of working. While new these structures can be effective at increasing flexibility, they have also unintentionally introduced complexity by multiplying the required number of interactions per employee. We routinely see organizations adopting advice to move to structures with consistent spans of control (the number of people one is responsible for managing) of eight people. But such efforts to improve efficiency don&#39;t consider the collaborations required to do the work. The collaborative footprint of work — which has risen 50% or more in the past 15 years, according to Rob Cross&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/01/collaborative-overload&quot;>;research&lt;/a>; — is creating exponential opportunities for small stresses to run rampant in any organization. Unchecked, such complexity, can easily accumulate, triggering a proliferation of microstresses.&lt;/p>; &lt;article-promo>; &lt;hbr-component type=&quot;promo&quot; is-insight=&quot;insight-center&quot; title=&quot;The Future of Work&quot; dek=&quot;Will your company adapt or be left behind?&quot; cta-text=&quot;&quot; href=&quot;/insight-center/the-future-of-work&quot;>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/insight-center/the-future-of-work&quot; style=&quot;color:black;text-decoration:none&quot;>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; Insight Center Collection &lt;/div>; &lt;h3>;The Future of Work&lt;/h3>; &lt;div>; Will your company adapt or be left behind? &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hbr-component>; &lt;/article-promo>; &lt;p>;De-layering might seem to be a solution, but in embracing it many organizations have moved to spans of control that really are not feasible given the collaborative intensity of the work. (We&#39;ve even seen some organizations scaling up to spans of control of 12 or more.) Such flat hierarchy can create stress for employees balancing competing objectives of multiple leaders to whom an employee might report, formally or informally.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Removing layers, while appealing on cost analyses and decision-making flows, also often introduces other less visible inefficiencies around work. Many teams are underperforming today due to priority overload where too many uncoordinated asks are coming into the teams from disconnected &lt;a href=&quot;https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/when-collaboration-fails-and-how-to-fix-it/&quot;>;stakeholders&lt;/a>; and failures of coordination and prioritization at high levels in the organization.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One way to fix that is to have explicit processes to remove excessive complexity. It may not be possible to rewind all of these efforts at de-layering organizations, but there are a few &lt;a href=&quot;/2020/01/taming-complexity&quot;>;simple practices&lt;/a>; you can employ to root out the potential for unnecessary stress from structural complexity. Most companies have many ways of introducing new complexity, but no systematic continuous effort to remove it. Netflix is one of a handful of firms known for prioritizing &lt;a href=&quot;https://jobs.netflix.com/culture&quot;>;identifying and removing unnecessary complexity&lt;/a>;. As their company policy states, “We work hard to … keep our business as simple as possible … you don&#39;t need policies for everything.” If you must introduce new teams or procedures, consider making them temporary. Create them with an explicit sunset clause, such that it is dissolved when no longer useful, avoiding the gradual ratcheting of complexity over time.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Companies can also control complexity by continually simplifying the product portfolio, which is often a key driver of complexity. Trader Joe&#39;s has a such a policy for &lt;a href=&quot;https://d3.harvard.edu/platform-rctom/submission/trader-joes-food-for-thought/&quot;>;controlling the number of SKUs&lt;/a>; to maintain the number at less than 10% of the industry average. Similarly, LEGO controls the number of colors and brick types in its products, to control manufacturing and logistical complexity.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong>;Above all, don&#39;t just think about on paper efficiency, think about the collaborative asks being placed on human beings who execute these tasks day in, day out. When we have asked top teams in offsites who in the room wants another email, meeting, or phone call in their lives, we have yet to see a single hand shoot up. The more complex, the more matrixed, the more required communication and connection between employees, the more ad hoc the more microstresses are going to be impeding the effectiveness of work.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Does our workflow make sense? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Organizations have had an unrelenting push into agile, network-centric structures executing through teams that are formed and disbanded at increasingly rapid pace. These efforts are providing speed, but taken to an extreme, they are starting to sacrifice the benefits of scale and efficiency that came from the process revolution. Forming and reforming project teams requires increasing coordination, often relying on the heroics of individual employees to get work done. But that is not a sustainable strategy — and triggers endless opportunities for burnout. “It&#39;s better to rely on a process than just people,” Don Allan, CEO of Stanley Black &amp;amp; Decker &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/03/has-your-organization-acted-on-what-its-learned-in-the-pandemic&quot;>;observed&lt;/a>; of one of the key HR lessons of the pandemic, “so you do not create unnecessary stress and even burnout for your organization.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The proliferation of technologies in the workplace promises to streamline work and communication, but instead can often became a source of additional complexity, required work and stress. Often, we find organizations using between six and nine means of collaborating to get work done — meetings (virtual and face-to-face), email, instant messaging (such as Slack), team collaborative spaces, phone calls, texting, etc. Inefficiencies invariably creep in as people use these modalities differently — for example, who doesn&#39;t have a colleague who loves to write elaborate emails, hiding what they want in the 10&lt;sup>;th&lt;/sup>; paragraph! Or at the other extreme, some people use one modality (eg, IM) to solve problems quickly, but lack of transparency into the interaction creates misalignment with other teammates who have no idea a decision was made over IM.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One way to limit this stress is to agree on collaborative norms. For example, a team might agree to only use bullets on email. And if a longer explanation is required or a disagreement seems to be brewing, the team agrees to meet face to face. We find a simple exercise of asking teams to agree to three positive norms across all modes of collaboration that they want to sustain and three negatives they want to stop (eg, emailing at night, hitting reply to all on mundane responses, etc.) can generate 8–12% time savings across teams, allowing them more time to focus on the actual work. Technology itself is not necessarily a bad thing, but the culture that springs up around using that technology is where microstress creeps in.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Teams can also limit the set of tools they&#39;re using and bake them into the work in a way which reduces human transaction costs. Focus on maximizing technology that helps eliminate or reduce the costs of mundane tasks, eg setting up workflows on Slack or recurring meetings to ensure appropriate check ins don&#39;t slip through the cracks because they&#39;re relying on a team member to set up and coordinate. Encourage the team to invest time in learning the tools and share their productivity tips and tricks. And avoid new tools or multiple tools that inadvertently becoming new sources of work or complexity eg through cumbersome sign on procedures or lack of mutual compatibility. Too often teams aren&#39;t consulted about which tools will actually help their productivity.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Has the profusion of teams spiked employees&#39; microstress? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;One of the unintended consequences of organizations relying on teams that are assembled for projects is that teams have less time to build the kind of trust that is essential for efficient collaboration. And that happens repeatedly because many organizations require employees to contribute to five or six team efforts (in addition to their primary team) and have often let these &lt;a href=&quot;/2013/11/the-new-rules-of-breakthrough-collaboration&quot;>;groups grow too large&lt;/a>;, with the average team size hovering around 15.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To avoid team growth from causing trouble, don&#39;t let “flexible” turn into inefficient. Some organizations trying to attract and retain top talent during the great resignation (and quiet quitting) have implemented &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/05/how-to-design-an-internal-talent-marketplace&quot;>;talent marketplaces&lt;/a>; which allow employees to locate projects they would like to work on or roles they want to fill as they chart their own career progression. Though well-intended as a talent retention tool, these shifts create inefficiencies in the network that most organizations do not account for. These programs are well-received by the employees but induce microstresses on both the team the employee is leaving and the one they are ported into, as they suddenly have to redirect and shape key working relationships with new people. One life sciences organization we worked with modeled the relational cost (the “switching costs” on work relationships and productivity of continually rotating teams) and determined that it didn&#39;t make sense for anyone to switch roles or teams in less than fifteen months because both the team and the rotating employee would fail to optimize the opportunity.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Companies must also ensure that their return-to-office plan doesn&#39;t create hidden stress. About 80% of companies are opting to require employees to be in the office three days a week, according to research from i4cp (the Institute for Corporate Productivity). To soften the blow and ensure flexibility, about half of those companies are allowing employees to pick the days they want to return.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Unfortunately, this well-intentioned effort has also created a new set of microstresses when the people who an organization needs to work together pick different days. Leaving this up to chance will not only hurt employee morale, but innovation and productivity. To prevent this, some organizations are using a technique called &lt;a href=&quot;https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/optimizing-return-to-office-strategies-with-organizational-network-analysis/&quot;>;organizational network analysis&lt;/a>; (a methodology that maps employees&#39; working relationships) to specify specific groups of employees that need to be in the office at a given interval. Such an analysis can help leaders answer three critical questions in a return-to-office strategy:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;&lt;em>;Who&lt;/em>; should be brought back together and in what cadence of in-person and virtual interactions?&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;em>;What&lt;/em>; work should be prioritized in the now scarcer in-person time?&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;em>;How&lt;/em>; do leaders manage the transition to a hybrid model with the least resistance?&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;This method also helps motivate employees to resume some in-person interactions by showing them how hybrid work can improve their own effectiveness.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Have we built a sense of purpose in our employees&#39; everyday interactions? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Organizations have become adept at working efficiently with the help of technologies — what can&#39;t be swiftly taken care of on a Zoom call these days? But when work revolves around technology use, it can become transactional, missing the opportunity to make sure that employees understand how their work contributes to that purpose.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To avoid that problem, smart companies create opportunities to discuss purpose and how each group contributes to it. It is your role as a leader to shape and communicate the goal that you&#39;re all working towards. Don&#39;t let that get lost in the sea of microstress. With a clear understanding of how they are contributing to purpose, employees can more easily prioritize their work. Discuss what work is essential (and what is not) in contributing to purpose and use this to help your team prioritize and redesign work accordingly.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;While many organizations focus on rallying employees around a collective corporate purpose, our research also suggests that purpose can be found in positive &lt;a href=&quot;https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/a-noble-purpose-alone-wont-transform-your-company/&quot;>;everyday interactions with colleagues&lt;/a>;, too. For example, employees can find meaningful purpose in “co-creating” (involving the aha moments that emerge as people build on each other&#39;s ideas) which helps builds a sense of &lt;em>;We are in this together. &lt;/em>;Small moments of working on something together create an authentic connection, a kind of antidote to the flood of microstresses that otherwise fill employees&#39; days.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Finally, as leaders, don&#39;t underestimate the impact of your own microstress, both on you and your team. Look for interactions in which you are unintentionally creating microstress for your team — for example being slightly unpredictable in your expectations, failing to communicate deliverables clearly, or continually micromanaging their work. The microstress we create for others inevitably boomerangs back on us. If you recognize where you are the source of unnecessary microstress and try to course-correct, you will not only help reduce stress on your team, but you&#39;ll be also reducing stress on yourself, as well.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 04 Oct 2023 22:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[A Tool to Help Boards Measure Cyber Resilience]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/10/a-tool-to-help-boards-measure-cyber-resilience]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/10/Oct23_04_1086719936.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;Busà Photography/Getty Images&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;During our research, we asked cybersecurity leaders, board directors and other subject matter experts about board cybersecurity discussions and the reporting given to boards in preparation for these discussions. All respondents had strong opinions about cybersecurity boardroom discussions. Generally, participants agreed that boards had a difficult time discussing cybersecurity at a meaningful level, the board needed different information, and a new approach was necessary.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/10/a-tool-to-help-boards-measure-cyber-resilience?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/10/a-tool-to-help-boards-measure-cyber-resilience?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;By now most boards know that cybersecurity is a business risk that they must oversee and ensure proper mitigations are in place. In an earlier article, we described the &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/05/boards-are-having-the-wrong-conversations-about-cybersecurity&quot;>;conversations the boards must have to perform this role.&lt;/a>; We made a case for discussing cyber resilience instead of cyber protection. Organizations cannot protect themselves enough to simply rely on additional investments in protection. Certainly, protecting assets, systems, and data is critically important, but as continued headlines have shown, focusing on protection is just not enough. Companies, and the boards that oversee them, have failed to find the right way to be protected enough (as evidenced by the constant headlines sharing the latest innovative breach on the under protected organization). Instead, we advocate that boards must have conversations about resilience, not just about protection.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To properly mitigate cyber risk, company leaders must have rock-solid plans in place to respond and recover quickly so even in the face of a cyber attack, the company continues to operate. Those are the right conversations for board directors to have with their cybersecurity leaders. In this article, we share research on the kind of information directors need for these conversations, and it is not the information they are getting today.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Research into Board Oversight&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;The board provides oversight to operational and strategic decisions and has a fiduciary responsibility to manage cyber risk. We began our research by trying to understand the kind of information CISOs and cyber executives were reporting to their boards, and comparing it to the information boards need to do their job. We set up a survey with many different kinds of performance indicators, ranging from technical to organizational. But the results of that survey made it clear that we were on the wrong path.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;While it&#39;s easiest for cyber executives to report on technology metrics or organizational metrics, such as phishing exercise results, this information does not help the Board with their job of ensuring cyber resilience. It&#39;s just the wrong level of information. It&#39;s important for operational cyber leaders to understand how their security controls are set up, how they are functioning, and where they are failing. That&#39;s the operational leader&#39;s job. But it&#39;s the wrong information — at least initially — for conversations with the board.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We changed direction and applied the concept of a &lt;a href=&quot;/1992/01/the-balanced-scorecard-measures-that-drive-performance-2&quot;>;balanced scorecard (created by Harvard professors Bob Kaplan and David Norton)&lt;/a>; to cybersecurity. We asked questions of cyber leaders who report to boards, board members, and other subject matter experts about the information most useful to boards from a business perspective, rather than a technical perspective. This approach yielded a framework and set of recommendations that hold promise to assist boards in understanding the real risks they face, give cyber executives a language to communicate these risks, and create opportunity for useful dialogue between the two groups.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;The Need For Better Board Cybersecurity Reporting&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;During our research, we asked cybersecurity leaders, board directors and other subject matter experts about board cybersecurity discussions and the reporting given to boards in preparation for these discussions. All respondents had strong opinions about cybersecurity boardroom discussions. Generally, participants agreed that boards had a difficult time discussing cybersecurity at a meaningful level, the board needed different information, and a new approach was necessary. For example, one director responded said, “I think a discussion about cybersecurity metrics is worthwhile. It&#39;s hard to measure and communicate security &#39;value.&#39; So, some thoughts in that regard would be interesting to me.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But cybersecurity was not even a board level topic for some respondents. One of the respondents commented, “None of the Boards on which I&#39;m serving have a specific focus on cybersecurity. For one board, it&#39;s included in the IT topics we discuss. In another, it&#39;s part of the audit committee.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One respondent who identified as a C-level technical leader observed that boards want comparisons, especially for making assessments about cyber resilience. He said, “My board is interested in resilience, but also curious about what others are doing. They value peer insights and comparisons.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Participants wanted key information about system assets, proactive capabilities and how quickly they could recover when asked what information would help them to assess operational risk. One of them was a board member of a technology services identified the information he would like to know, “What date types we have, where we have them, likelihood of compromise to their confidentiality, integrity, availability, and impact of their security&#39;s compromise to our business operations.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;More than half of the participants wanted to know the financial dollar value involved with breaches or cyber-attacks on their organization.&lt;i>; &lt;/i>;Almost half of the participants mentioned the use of third-party technical risk assessments, which they reported to the board and updated every quarter. For the supply-chain, respondents thought it was important to know about capabilities and protection of suppliers and redundant options. However, most of the respondents were not sure if technical and supply-chain details should be part of the oversight for the board.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There were mixed responses when asked about what they thought would help access organizational risk due to cybersecurity vulnerabilities. Some respondents were not sure what would be needed for them to assess organizational risk. Some mentioned reviewing training details, others commented that an assessment of employees&#39; skills to handle potential organizational vulnerabilities.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Interviews revealed that boards frequently delegate responsibility of cybersecurity to audit and risk committees. Respondents commented that feedback from these committees was welcome when the board receives cybersecurity reports.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Resilience assessment was also explored. Half of the respondents did not have a method for assessing overall organizational resilience to cybersecurity risks. Respondents commented that financial, supply-chain, technological and organizational risk assessment might lead them draw inferences to overall organizational resilience, but it was the role of operational leaders to present these risks to the board and to have a plan in place to address these risks.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Follow up discussions with respondents made it clear that board members were interested in making sure their organizations were resilient to cyber risks, and that there was a lack of tools to help boards perform appropriate cybersecurity oversight for these concerns.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;The Balanced Scorecard for Cyber Resilience (BSCR)&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Building on the original Kaplan and Norton work, a balanced scorecard incorporates important performance indicators from different perspectives of the company that provide leaders with complex information that is easily understood. The main purpose of their scorecard was to provide insight into financial and operational performance by combining information about core activities that might otherwise be isolated from each other. By looking at these indicators together in a single framework, the leaders are able to draw conclusions that might otherwise be missed. Our work extended these ideas into the cybersecurity realm to provide insight to boards about cyber resilience.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The board level balanced scorecard for cyber resilience is shown in Figure 1. It combines financial, technological, organizational, and supply-chain indicators, and an aggregated indicator of resilience. Each of the four quadrants has three components: 1) the biggest risk, 2) the action plan for managing that risk, and 3) an overall indicator (green, yellow, red, or GYR) for quick assessment of risk to that area. These four quadrants are based on findings from current research but leave open the possibility of additional areas that might be relevant to assessing cyber resilience in the future.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Figure 1&lt;/strong>;: Sample of a board level Balanced Scorecard for Cyber Resilience (BSCR) for an organization&lt;/p>; &lt;div>; &lt;figure>; &lt;img aria-describedby=&quot;caption-attachment-365052&quot; src=&quot;/resources/images/article_assets/2023/09/W230905_PEARLSON_BSCR_360.png&quot; >; &lt;p>;Key area: supply chain.

This is compiled from operational data cyber leaders use to manage cyber activities. These indicators might come from frameworks such as the CISA Cybersecurity Performance Goals (CPG) or home-developed metrics used by the cybersecurity team to monitor activity.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;The Biggest Risk window is a qualitative assessment made by knowledgeable cybersecurity leaders, such as the CISO or CIO, of the most problematic issue in that area. It&#39;s a brief answer to the questions, “what is the biggest risk the organization faces right now?” and “how big is this risk?”&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;The Action Plan is the leader&#39;s high-level plan to manage the biggest risk. It is the answer to the questions “What are we doing about this risk right now?” and “How urgent is this risk?”&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;The Resilient indicator in the center of the balanced scorecard (BSCR) is an overall assessment of the organization&#39;s cyber resilience based on the four quadrants.&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;This board level BSCR provides directors with quickly understandable information based on both qualitative, managerial insights and quantitative cumulative data to spark deeper conversations with operational managers.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Providing The Right Information to Boards&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Directors understand their organization faces risk from many sources, including cybersecurity risk. The big elephant in the room, however, is how to appropriately discuss and manage this risk. Cybersecurity executives know that their organization cannot be 100% secure, since new threat vectors emerge regularly, and new vulnerabilities are uncovered at a similar rate. Managing the risk means making decisions on the best way to spend resources protecting our organization and at the same time, preparing for a possible incident and insuring resilience to operations. For this, boards need a balanced view of cyber vulnerabilities and threats and an understanding of how operational leaders are managing them.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;While it is seductive for directors and operational leaders to focus on the technical details and metrics, it&#39;s not the right place to start. For example, when cybersecurity leaders only report the latest phishing exercise results, boards engage at that level. Quantitate measures are easy to obtain, share, and compare. But they don&#39;t tell the story that help boards oversee cybersecurity risk. Further, directors use the information they are given, and the ensuing discussion focuses on tactical plans operational leaders put in place to reduce the chance of a successful phishing email. But that is not the best use of the directors&#39; attention. It focuses the directors&#39; attention on one aspect of organizational cybersecurity and may miss other vulnerabilities that threaten the business. Instead, the board should be discussing the business-level risks the leaders see, and what the operational leaders are doing to insure resiliency. This broader question leaves open the opportunity for any organizational vulnerability, not just a phishing email vulnerability.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;What Are the Next Steps?&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;From our work, we see that a change in mindset from protection to resilience is needed and to drive that change, operational leaders must change how they report to the board.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Managers focus on measures taken for cyber protection, but boards need to know about cyber resilience. Managers think their boards want to know about operational metrics, but directors really want to know the business risks the managers anticipate and what action plan is in place to mitigate the risk.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Managers report on metrics they can calculate, but boards need a broader assessment of where the next cyber issue might occur and those might not be quantifiable. Directors need information about the business impact of the cyber risks, both from a risk-identification and a risk-likelihood perspective. Qualitatively reporting the general business risks from cyber threats and vulnerabilities in the context of how it might disrupt the organization, and discussing the importance of the risk with the board enables directors to assess if attention is placed on the right risks and mitigation strategies.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The value of discussing a balanced view of cybersecurity risks at the board level does not come from comparing today&#39;s posture with yesterday&#39;s posture, but from making sure that the business is prepared today and tomorrow for potential disruption from a cyber incident. Cyber risk is dynamic. What is a risk today may not be a risk tomorrow, or it might be the biggest risk tomorrow. To make that assessment, boards want to have the right conversations with those who know both the cyber risk and the business impact of that risk.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It&#39;s not really about how protected we are, but how resilient we are. A Balanced Scorecard for Cyber Resilience is the starting place for the discussions about how the business will continue operations when an event occurs. It is not enough to invest only in protection today. We need to focus on business resilience to cyber vulnerabilities and threats. To do that, we need a balanced, qualitative assessment from the operational leaders who know.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 04 Oct 2023 21:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Do You Understand Why You Catastrophize?]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/10/do-you-understand-why-you-catastrophize]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/10/Oct23_04_571978003.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;Andrew Brookes/Getty Images&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;Leaders who create doomsday scenarios out of everyday setbacks &amp;#8212; what behavioral scientists call &amp;#8220;catastrophizing&amp;#8221; &amp;#8212; risk spreading their anxiety to their teams. In this article, the author digs in to the psychological and physiological reasons behind this tendency to draw disastrous conclusions and presents several ways to address it: 1) Reflect on how you learned to expect the worst; 2) Create ways to interrogate faulty data; 3) Learn to regulate amid your catastrophizing; 4) Separate fears rooted in reality from those you fabricate; and 5) Acknowledge the consequences your catastrophizing has for others.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/10/do-you-understand-why-you-catastrophize?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/10/do-you-understand-why-you-catastrophize?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;As I was walking through the office of my client, Derek,* to review feedback I&#39;d collected from interviews with his organization, I sensed an obvious dread in the air. People were quiet, heads down, and pre-occupied — a stark contrast from when I visited a few weeks prior. When I got to Derek&#39;s assistant&#39;s desk, I asked him, “Is everything okay? Everyone seems so gloomy.” He said: “Derek&#39;s in one of his moods, and they&#39;re afraid of what&#39;s going to happen after you leave. A little while ago, he came out and asked, &#39;Can you please see if there are any empty boxes in the storage room? I may need them later.&#39;” I responded, “Why do you think he wants boxes?” He said, “He thinks he&#39;s getting fired because of the feedback.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ironically, Derek&#39;s feedback was more positive than developmental. His bosses, peers, and direct reports thought highly of him, noting many strengths and great potential. There were a few areas where they called for improvement, most notably Derek&#39;s tendency to “go to the dark side,” as one interviewee put it. Comments like, “If there&#39;s a worst-case scenario, Derek goes there first,” and “I&#39;ve never seen anyone react to the simplest of problems as if it were the end of the world,” were pointing to his tendency to see threatening consequences in situations whether they were there or not. This is what behavioral scientists call &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.healthline.com/health/anxiety/catastrophizing#associated-conditions&quot;>;catastrophizing&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Clearly, Derek was anxious about our meeting, and let everyone know it. Derek&#39;s tendency to catastrophize isn&#39;t that unusual. Some &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/blog/sapient-nature/201310/how-negative-is-your-mental-chatter&quot;>;research&lt;/a>; shows that up to 70% of our thoughts are negative, so it stands to reason that, for some people, those negative thoughts can urge us to draw particularly disastrous conclusions, even if unfounded.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;The Origins of Catastrophizing&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;If you tend to create doomsday scenarios out of everyday setbacks, it&#39;s useful to know that your brain is helping you do so. Jay Stringer, acclaimed author and licensed mental health professional specializing in specific forms of trauma, told me:&lt;/p>; &lt;blockquote>; &lt;p>;The thalamus is an area inside our brain&#39;s limbic system that integrates all our perceptions into conclusions about what&#39;s happening around us. From there, sensations are passed on in two directions: to the amygdala and up to the frontal lobes, where they reach our conscious awareness. Think of the amygdala as a smoke detector. It is on 24/7 and its job is to constantly detect whether incoming input is relevant to our survival and well-being. The amygdala operates quickly and automatically, always checking for potential catastrophe. If the amygdala senses a threat — a boss who looks menacing or a potential collision with another vehicle — it sends a message down our brain stem to recruit stress hormones to prepare for a whole-body response. Before we can even have a rational thought about an event, our body is preparing to mitigate any potential catastrophe.&lt;/p>; &lt;/blockquote>; &lt;p>;Stringer explains that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.verywellhealth.com/how-to-let-go-of-past-trauma-5212227&quot;>;past traumatic events&lt;/a>; can distort our ability to accurately assess impending threats. The parts of our brain designed to detect danger and organize our body to respond are inherently good systems devised to protect us. “But when trauma or adverse experiences occur in our past, the hippocampus has been known to shrink 8 to 12%, which will negatively impact a person&#39;s ability to differentiate between past and present experiences,” says Stringer. “Therefore, rather than fighting to stop catastrophizing, work to understand the unresolved stories that may be influencing you to live in a frequent state of threat.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If your catastrophizing is getting in the way of leading others effectively, or experiencing joy and contentment in life, here are some ways to begin addressing it.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Reflect on how you learned to expect the worst.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Your choice to catastrophize isn&#39;t random. It&#39;s learned behavior. Be curious about how and when you may have learned it. Think about the &lt;a href=&quot;/2019/12/getting-to-the-bottom-of-destructive-behaviors&quot;>;origin stories&lt;/a>; in formative seasons of your life where you developed your capacity to foresee impending disaster. These stories may be painful to recall. But if you can recognize what need you&#39;re meeting by expecting unlikely disasters, you can then work to interrupt the pattern.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sharon Melnick, PhD, best-selling author, business psychologist, and seasoned executive coach, told me, “It&#39;s common for people with high control needs, often with perfectionistic tendencies, to catastrophize. They put a lot of pressure on themselves to achieve an outcome that will reflect favorably on them while unconsciously terrified that if the outcome isn&#39;t perfect, they will be found blameworthy, and ultimately, unworthy.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As it turns out, Derek was raised by exceedingly demanding parents with little tolerance for less-than-perfect performance. Whether his household chores, school grades, or athletic performance, when he fell short, he was demeaned and punished. A few months into our work together, he told me, “I knew my parents loved me. I always saw their pressure as driving me to be my best. It never occurred to me that my need to be perfect, my fear of falling short, and my &lt;a href=&quot;/2019/01/are-your-high-expectations-hurting-your-team&quot;>;unrealistic expectations&lt;/a>; of others stemmed from a desperate need to earn the love and admiration of those around me.” Derek&#39;s catastrophizing drove him to peak performance while keeping the familiar narrative intact that told him, “You&#39;re only valuable when you&#39;re perfect.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One of the stories Derek recalled was in high school when he was studying for midterm exams while also being a starting football player. Exhausted, he ended up getting a B on one exam and missing the pass that would have won the game that sent his team to the playoffs, both in the same week. His parents shunned him, and that Christmas he got no gifts. Understandably, any negative feedback Derek received triggered his flight response, just as the feedback I delivered took him right to an expectation of being shunned again, this time by his boss.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Create ways to interrogate faulty data.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;One of the ways to slow down catastrophizing is by interrogating the data you&#39;re collecting to prove your prediction of doom. What cues are you focused on that are telling you the worst will happen? Are there circumstances, people, or challenges that regularly instigate your expectation of calamity? For me, when someone took longer than usual to respond to an email or message, I was certain the relationship was in ruins.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Investigate what you may be really avoiding rather than your manufactured disaster. For example, some leaders will imagine every possible tragedy, a form of “analysis paralysis,” just to &lt;a href=&quot;/2018/04/leaders-stop-avoiding-hard-decisions&quot;>;avoid making a hard decision&lt;/a>; or prevent revealing that they don&#39;t know something. Force yourself to create if/then scenarios — “if this happens, then I can…”— to broaden your optionality for response.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Try to catch the catastrophizing thought early in the downward spiral, when you first notice it, before it activates a whole set of associations that convince you of its reality,” says Melnick. “Require yourself to write out a full universe of outcomes, beyond the one you are over-focusing on.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This becomes especially important at the back end of situations. Most catastrophizers feel a modicum of relief once the expected disaster doesn&#39;t materialize, but in the same moment will believe “the other shoe hasn&#39;t fallen yet.” Still, it&#39;s important to contrast the &lt;em>;actual &lt;/em>;outcome with the &lt;em>;expected &lt;/em>;outcome. What cues were present the whole time signaling what was likely to happen that you couldn&#39;t see? What signs of positive outcomes do you tend to ignore? Doing these post-event analyses will help you build a wider pattern library through which to screen future situations where you&#39;re tempted to fear the worst.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Learn to regulate amid your catastrophizing.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Many catastrophizers try and cover their feelings with fake positivity. But this alternative extreme only deepens the fear they&#39;re trying to evade. Once we&#39;re in a state of catastrophizing, we still have control over how long we let it go on. Says Stringer:&lt;/p>; &lt;blockquote>; &lt;p>;Eighty percent or more of the sensations we process pass from our body up to our brain, not our brain down to our body. Therefore, if we want to mitigate catastrophizing, we should first orient our treatment plan around the body. Too often we only try to change our minds without changing our body&#39;s self-state. &lt;a href=&quot;/2020/09/research-why-breathing-is-so-effective-at-reducing-stress&quot;>;Breathing exercises&lt;/a>;, &lt;a href=&quot;/2021/02/dont-underestimate-the-power-of-a-walk&quot;>;spending time outdoors&lt;/a>;, and honestly labeling our true feelings have all been shown to bring more balanced perspective, allowing our parasympathetic nervous system to calm us, causing quick drops in the levels of the stress hormone cortisol. When our brain names our emotional life accurately, it secretes soothing neurotransmitters to calm down our amygdala.&lt;/p>; &lt;/blockquote>; &lt;h3>;Separate fears rooted in reality from those you fabricate.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;For some people, one of the challenges of catastrophizing is that their fear is enshrined in real experience. Past encounters of trauma or difficulty had real consequences, so the dreaded outcomes don&#39;t appear entirely unfounded, even if extreme. “People from underrepresented groups, like women or racial minorities, have experienced being passed over for hiring or promotions, or getting less funding from investors. Or professionals may have struggled for more than a year to land a job,” says Melnick. “Memories of these real experiences can lead to generalizing the feared negative consequences, fueling more anxiety and prolonging the cognitive distortion of a catastrophe. It intensifies the conclusion that you don&#39;t have the power to change the situation, effectively cope with it or create an outcome unique to your situation.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In these moments, it&#39;s vital to distinguish the kernels of truth from past challenges from the doom scenario you&#39;ve formed about what&#39;s coming. Remind yourself of times you&#39;ve demonstrated &lt;a href=&quot;/2021/01/the-secret-to-building-resilience&quot;>;resilience&lt;/a>; and come through challenges effectively. Interrogate limiting beliefs about how much control you do or don&#39;t have over the situation. Melnick suggests that you “find ways to activate your agency and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Your-Power-Regain-Control-Others/dp/1119898862&quot;>;take back your power&lt;/a>; rather than forfeiting it to the fear of disastrous outcomes.”&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Acknowledge the consequences your catastrophizing has for others.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;As a leader, your mood sets the tone of your team, division, or organization. Derek&#39;s worry about his feedback infected the entire team with anxiety. To maintain a healthy environment, you must acknowledge how your predisposition toward worst-case scenarios may affect them. If necessary, apologize and talk about what steps you&#39;re taking to curb this tendency. Otherwise, catastrophizing can become an &lt;a href=&quot;/2022/11/the-emotional-labor-of-being-a-leader&quot;>;emotional contagion&lt;/a>; that toxifies the organization.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, “The middle-manager who is deeply fearful of being berated by their boss creates a noxious culture for those under them. They catastrophize in part because they are trying to avoid being shamed by their superiors,” says Stringer. “This creates a petri dish of anxiety and apathy in others. Employees end up trying to avoid mistakes and foreclose their creative and collaborative energy. They know their boss is not giving them their best and so they return the favor by underperforming.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Take inventory of ways your catastrophizing may have inhibited creativity, team cohesion, joy, or courage in your organization. How has it narrowed your perspective of team performance? Do people walk on eggshells around you, only telling you positive news? Says Melnick, “It&#39;s common for catastrophizing leaders to become more self-absorbed, focusing on themselves at the expense of the team or organization. Worse, it can lead to missing critical cues or opportunities in the market or organization.” Whatever the consequences have been, resist the temptation to minimize or ignore them.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;. 。 .&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Rather than resorting to shame, guilt, or contempt, see your tendency to catastrophize as a messenger bidding you to be curious about the role it has played in your story. &lt;a href=&quot;/2020/11/self-compassion-will-make-you-a-better-leader&quot;>;Show yourself kindness&lt;/a>; as you contemplate whether this habit is serving you well. To build hope that change is possible, replace stigmatized language like “I&#39;m overreacting” or “I&#39;m just so negative” with questions like, “How might I be misinterpreting the threat I&#39;m seeing?”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ultimately, accept that this habit is offering you an invitation to heal, grow, and learn. As Stringer suggests, “We need to learn to befriend our alarmed nervous systems. When we bravely and compassionately notice difficult feelings as they emerge, we learn how to respond &lt;em>;to them &lt;/em>;rather than react &lt;em>;with them.&lt;/em>;”&lt;/p>; &lt;div>; &lt;em>;* Name has been changed; story used with permission.&lt;/em>; &lt;/div>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 04 Oct 2023 20:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[How Digital Technologies Could Boost Tiny Retailers in Developing Countries]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/10/how-digital-technologies-could-boost-tiny-retailers-in-developing-countries]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/10/Oct23_03_1479691508.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;master1305/Getty Images&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;Micro-retailers are vitally important to the economies of developing countries and to consumer packaged goods companies. But their full potential is not being realized. The adoption of digital technologies could help change that. But for that to happen, obstacles must be overcome. Three strategies can address them.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/10/how-digital-technologies-could-boost-tiny-retailers-in-developing-countries?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/10/how-digital-technologies-could-boost-tiny-retailers-in-developing-countries?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;Independently operated micro-retailers that typically serve fewer than 100 households in local communities account for most retail business in developing countries. In Latin America, for example, these “nanostores” account for an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Reaching-Million-Nanostores-Distribution-Megacities/dp/1975742001&quot;>;estimated 40% to 70%&lt;/a>; of consumer-packaged goods (CPG) companies&#39; sales, making it the largest channel in terms of sales volume.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Much of this vast market&#39;s potential is unrealized, however, because these small retailers have failed to embrace digital technology that could boost their performance and profitability. In this article, we offer three practical strategies that would help them harness the benefits of digital technology.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;1. Make tech solutions user-friendly.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Digital technologies that could raise the micro-retailer performance bar include mobile apps that deliver more efficient inventory management and payment transactions and enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems that enhance record-keeping and order management.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, a hurdle to adopting solutions like these is that they are not sufficiently user-friendly for nanostore owners. Studies show that shopkeepers in developing countries lack an understanding of the dashboards and data used by off-the-shelf management systems. One conducted by &lt;a href=&quot;https://liftlab.mit.edu/&quot;>;MIT&#39;s Low Income Firms Transformation (LIFT) Lab&lt;/a>; (which one of us, Josué, heads) that looked at 4,000 nanostores in Mexico in the fall of 2022 discovered that among the 25% or so shopkeepers who owned point-of-sale (POS) management systems, about 55% preferred to use paper or spreadsheets to track and manage inventory rather than the POS technology. In a &lt;a href=&quot;https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/152063&quot;>;study of workshops in Latin America&lt;/a>;, we found that a possible reason for spurning POS is an inadequate understanding of these systems and their functionality.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The problem can be addressed by making management solutions more accessible.&lt;/p>; &lt;article-promo>; &lt;hbr-component type=&quot;promo&quot; is-insight=&quot;insight-center&quot; title=&quot;The New Age of Operations&quot; dek=&quot;Improving efficiency and increasing resilience.&quot; cta-text=&quot;&quot; href=&quot;/insight-center/the-new-age-of-operations&quot;>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/insight-center/the-new-age-of-operations&quot; style=&quot;color:black;text-decoration:none&quot;>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; Insight Center Collection &lt;/div>; &lt;h3>;The New Age of Operations&lt;/h3>; &lt;div>; Improving efficiency and increasing resilience. &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hbr-component>; &lt;/article-promo>; &lt;p>;To help achieve this goal, the LIFT Lab is developing two experiments to analyze how micro-retailer shopkeepers make replenishment decisions and their behavior when using any POS/ERP system for micro firms. Our research is looking at the systems&#39; interfaces and displays. One experiment, to be conducted online, is targeting 400 participants. A second will validate the results of the first one and be carried out in the field with approximately 500 nanostores in Mexico.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The intention is to use the research results to identify how to improve the accessibility of tech solutions. In addition, we are looking at how chatbots embedded in applications could be used to provide clear and concise explanations of the technology, thereby addressing the knowledge gaps that prevent micro-retailers from using the POS/ERP systems mentioned above.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;2. Remove financial barriers.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;E-commerce has revolutionized retailing across the globe — but not micro-retail markets. One of the main reasons for missing this wave of digital transformation is that nanostores face punishing financial barriers to adopting e-commerce platforms.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Nanostores already face such barriers in their traditional brick-and-mortar businesses. When big-box stores like Walmart place orders, the goods are first delivered, and the payment is made much later — &amp;nbsp;sometimes between 60 and 120 days later. This extended payment period profoundly affects the cash conversion cycle (ie, the number of days a business takes to sell its product and recover the money it invested in inventory). Large retailers use beneficial payment terms to move cash or invest it to earn interest and increase sales in their stores before paying back their suppliers. The benefits of this model cannot be underestimated.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In sharp contrast, nanostores are not given the minimum 60 days that big retailers enjoy, according to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/130977?show=full&quot;>;study&lt;/a>; we conducted in Brazil, Colombia, and Mexico. They must pay their suppliers in advance, usually two days before receiving the goods.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In e-commerce markets, these penalties are compounded by the payment demands of platforms such as Uber Eats and Rappi. Accessing such platforms lengthens the cash conversion cycle (ie, the number of days a business takes to sell its product and recover the money it invested in inventory), even though the profits might be higher in the long term. Most platforms demand that nanostores pay additional commission fees and accept digital payments that increase the time it takes to receive customer payments by up to 30 days.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Large consumer packaged goods (CPG) suppliers and e-commerce platforms can take the first step to remove these barriers by reviewing nanostore payment terms and finding ways to make them less punishing. For example, they could extend payment terms to, say, two weeks instead of insisting on advance payments. We believe such a change would compel nanostores to use the increase in cash availability to explore digital markets, improve tech adoption, and place more product orders, which would benefit suppliers.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;3. Capitalize on their pervasiveness.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;A critically important component of any e-commerce business model is efficient and timely last-mile delivery. Micro-retailers enjoy an advantage in this area: the ubiquity of their outlets. The challenge is how to harness this advantage and help micro-retailers develop viable e-commerce businesses.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are an estimated 50 million nanstores in the world. These outlets are dispersed throughout local communities across developing countries, providing a ready-made order-fulfillment network for online purchases.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;LIFT Lab is exploring business models that exploit the reachability of nanostore networks in the grocery retail business. For example, the e-commerce fulfillment by local stores concept is inspired by the crowdsourcing Uber model. The idea is to create a mobile app that connects consumers with nanostores. When a consumer orders through the app, the system allocates the order to the nearest nanostore and sets a price and delivery time. Given the number of nanostores available, it is likely that an outlet near the customer can be found. If the selected nanostore accepts the order, it is responsible for delivering the item, often on foot or by bicycle.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Following early development work, including gaining feedback on the concept in workshops with nanostores, we are building a mockup of an app that provides the required functionality and user interface.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Benefits For All&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;These three strategies do not represent a panacea for overcoming the problems that prevent micro-retailers in emerging economies from capturing the benefits of digital transformation. However, they show that these obstacles can be overcome, and the increased profitability and market growth paybacks of digitalization are available to the entire micro-retailer ecosystem, including large CPG suppliers.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 04 Oct 2023 00:55:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[10 Pitfalls That Destroy Organizational Trust]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/10/10-pitfalls-that-destroy-organizational-trust]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/10/Oct23_03_147917751.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;broken3/Getty Images&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;In their new book, &lt;em>;Move Fast and Fix Things&lt;/em>;, Frances Frei and Anne Morriss outline five strategies to help leaders tackle their hardest problems and quickly make change.

(See &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/10-signs-your-company-is-resistant-to-change&quot;>;10 Signs Your Company Is Resistant to Change&lt;/a>;)&lt;/em>;&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;em>;Build — or rebuild — trust with your stakeholders. &lt;/em>;&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;em>;Create inclusive conditions that allow your whole team to thrive. &lt;/em>;&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;em>;Tell a compelling story about the change you need to make. &lt;/em>;&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;em>;Execute your plan with a sense of urgency.&lt;/em>;&lt;/li>; &lt;/ol>; &lt;p>;&lt;em>;This month, we&#39;ll be publishing a series of excerpts that correspond to each strategy. In this excerpt, Frei and Morriss explain that, just as with personal trust, organizational trust relies on the presence of authenticity, empathy, and logic. But most organizations are shaky on at least one of these trust pillars&lt;/em>;&lt;em>;.&amp;nbsp; Which ones are getting in the way of your organization&#39;s progress?&amp;nbsp; &lt;/em>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;. 。 .&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;In order to trust you as an organization, your stakeholders need to believe three things: that you care about them (empathy), that you&#39;re capable of meeting their needs (logic), and that you can be expected to do what you say you&#39;ll do (authenticity). Just like when people lose trust, organizations that are losing trust — or failing to build as much trust as they could — tend to get shaky or wobble on one of these three dimensions. Below is a list of some of the trust problems we see most frequently in our work, along with what they reveal about &lt;a href=&quot;/2020/05/begin-with-trust&quot;>;what&#39;s getting wobbly&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;&amp;nbsp;1. &lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Aversion to making choices&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;This one can present in all kinds of ways, from managing for consensus to trying to be great at everything you do as an organization. A gentle reminder: although it may feel safer to hedge your bets, catering to a constituent that can be best described as “everyone” is often a much riskier path for the company. Your refusal to choose is increasing the likelihood of exhausted mediocrity. &lt;em>;Trust wobble: logic.&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;2. Reliance on heroic employees&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Many business models are designed for employees we wish we had, not for the employees we actually have — the ones with imperfections and lives outside of work. If your operations depend on people continuously going above and beyond, then be prepared to work much harder to find these magical creatures and reward them with outsize compensation. Few organizations are truly up for the task. &lt;em>;Trust wobble: logic.&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;3. Shiny object syndrome&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;The human brain is wired to focus on the new, new thing, even when the old, old thing matters more. A lack of intention (also known, less cheerily, as lack of &lt;em>;discipline&lt;/em>;) in the pursuit of new opportunities puts your business model at risk. Excellent adventures in new products and markets are often justified by hazy ROI equations that inflate the upside and downplay the risk, including the cost of distraction from more urgent priorities. May be accompanied by other types of magical thinking. &lt;em>;Trust wobble: logic.&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;4. Disengaged middle management&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Managers in what we call the “murky middle” of an organization are often the only people who know the true distance between a company&#39;s reality and its ambition. They know how much effort it&#39;s going to take to win, understand the true hazards of the journey, and typically have the most to lose (and least to gain) along the way. And yet, instead of being unleashed in moments of big change, middle managers are often overlooked by a leadership team that&#39;s focused on inspiring the front lines and gaining buy-in at the top. &lt;em>;Trust wobble: empathy&lt;/em>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;5. &lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Casual relationship with other people&#39;s time&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Do you treat your people&#39;s time as if it&#39;s your most strategic asset? It&#39;s one of our favorite leadership reflection prompts, and you&#39;ll hear us repeat it again and again. Far too many organizations are far too comfortable wasting their employees&#39; time on everything from clunky HR software to forcing everyone to come into the office to indulge a nostalgic view of what work used to feel like. The opportunity cost is immeasurable. &lt;em>;Trust wobble: empathy&lt;/em>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;6. &lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Comfort with collateral damage&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;This is the “break things” part of “Move fast and break things,” which can get embedded into an organization&#39;s culture. It often presents as desensitization to unintentional harms and justified by a “We tried our best” storyline. Organizations that would never tolerate this attitude when it comes to some parts of the business (“We tried our best to protect our financial data!”) often want participation trophies for &lt;em>;trying &lt;/em>;not to harm their users and employees. &lt;em>;Trust wobble: empathy.&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;7. &lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;High incidence of the “Sunday scaries”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;If a significant percentage of your colleagues feel an impending sense of dread at the thought of coming to work, then something is strained, if not broken, in the company&#39;s relationship with its employees. Sometimes there&#39;s an unskilled (or worse) manager to blame, but when people are experiencing this kind of anticipatory anxiety at scale, then there&#39;s an org-level problem that needs to be fixed. (&lt;em>;Spoiler: &lt;/em>;You&#39;re getting a small fraction of what your people are capable of contributing.) &lt;em>;Trust wobble: empathy.&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;8. &lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;People-pleasing in the boardroom&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;This pattern is rooted in our human impulse to tell people what we think they want to hear, particularly when said people can materially impact our organizational and/or professional futures. We&#39;re not talking about fraud or misrepresentation here but rather a habit of gently withholding, massaging, and constructing reality. The trust hit for this one is often higher than we think, since boards tend are sensitive to being managed and typically composed of excellent detectors of partial truths. Know that what they really want from you is the information they need to help the company solve problems. &lt;em>;Trust wobble: authenticity.&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;9. &lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Tolerance for misalignment&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Is your marketing team writing checks that your product team can&#39;t cash? Lack of alignment anywhere in the business is a problem but pay closest attention to org-level disconnects. One we see frequently is a gap between strategy and culture — for example, a strategy of innovation layered onto a culture defined by coloring within the lines. &lt;em>;Trust wobble: authenticity.&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;10. &lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Delusions of meritocracy&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;OK, here&#39;s what this looks like: you&#39;ve told yourselves you&#39;re a meritocracy, but you keep hiring, promoting, and retaining the same types of people. If the humans at the top of your organization bear little resemblance to the rest of your employees, the customers you serve, or the demographic distribution of the communities in which you operate, then we promise you, you&#39;re not a meritocracy. &lt;em>;Trust wobble: authenticity.&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;em>;This excerpt has been lightly edited.&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 03 Oct 2023 22:25:01 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
