&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023 /09/10-signs-your-company-is-resist-to-change?language=es&quot;>;阅读西班牙语&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/10-signs-your- company-is-resist-to-change?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;&lt;em>;Facebook 将“快速行动，打破常规”作为非正式的公司座右铭。但领导力专家弗朗西斯·弗雷和安妮·莫里斯认为，这种信念存在严重缺陷，它阻碍了领导者打造一家伟大的公司。 &lt;/em>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;em>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em>;&lt;em>;最好的领导者能够快速行动并解决问题——他们解决难题，同时使组织变得更强大。在他们的新书中&lt;/em>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://store.hbr.org/product/move-fast-and-fix-things-the-trusted-leader-s-guide-to-solving-hard -problems/10546&quot;>;快速行动并解决问题&lt;/a>;（&lt;em>;哈佛商业评论出版社），Frei 和 Morriss 概述了帮助领导者解决最棘手问题并快速做出改变的五项策略：&lt;/em>;&lt;/p >; &lt;ol>; &lt;li>;&lt;em>;确定您真正的问题。 &lt;/em>;&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;em>;与利益相关者建立或重建信任。 &lt;/em>;&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;em>;创造包容性的条件，让您的整个团队蓬勃发展。 &lt;/em>;&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;em>;讲述一个关于您需要做出的改变的引人入胜的故事。 &lt;/em>;&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;em>;带着紧迫感执行您的计划。&lt;/em>;&lt;/li>; &lt;/ol>; &lt;p>;&lt;em>;在接下来的五周内，我们将发布与每个策略相对应的一系列摘录。第一段摘录解释了为什么每个人都不清楚需要解决的真正问题 - 因为人们已经开发出许多有效的方法来容忍问题而不是解决它。 &lt;/em>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;。 。 .&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;并非每个组织都渴望解决其问题。在没有明显的绩效危机的情况下，领导者往往会紧抓现状而低估其风险。这种对变革的抵制可以以多种形式出现，其中一些难以解读。这里有 10 个迹象，表明你的公司可能试图让你放慢脚步，无论你在层级结构中处于何种位置。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;1.一个特别工作组正在被指派来解决这个问题。&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;一个由改革者组成的小而勇敢的团队是一回事，但另一个是。事实上，我们经常建议加快行动。事实证明，大多数特遣部队并不符合这一特点。你怎么知道？如果您被要求依赖缺乏地位、合法性或决策权的结构或流程，或者拥有上述任何一项的人的赞助，那么它不太可能帮助您有所作为。&lt;/p>; &lt; h2>;&lt;强>;2。我们感谢您付出的时间和努力。 &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;如果您怀疑自己被纵容或被解雇，那么您可能就是这样。顺便说一句，这与不同意不同，无论诊断结果如何，这都是完全可以接受的反应。作为变革者，你的义务是为你的想法提供有说服力的案例。您同事的义务是真诚地与他们交往，而不是不加批判地同意您的观点。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;3. &lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;人们怀疑组织是否（真的）有问题。&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;做好准备，你的一些同事会反驳你认为公司有问题的前提。顾名思义，残酷的事实是难以面对的。对于表明缺乏充分包容等文化问题的数据尤其如此。坚强点。流畅地讲述您今天收集到的证明问题确实存在的证据，以及有关组织为此付出的代价的共鸣故事。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;4. &lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;你被要求回应身份不明的批评者的严重关切。&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;这些交流通常以一些变化开始，“作为你的朋友，我认为你应该知道人们在说什么。”这通常是一种让你受到控制的策略，而不是向你提供有用的信息。不要上当并对谣言和道听途说做出反应。鼓励你的批评者说出自己的想法，这样你就可以直接解决他们的担忧，这很可能是有道理的。协作发生在白天。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;5. &lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;“法律问题”的幽灵正在被唤起。&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;解决这一问题的方法是直接与法律团队合作，该团队通常由人组成他们比那些使用他们名字的批评者更有创造力、更灵活、更注重解决方案。律师很少像非律师所说的那样无法容忍风险、令人扫兴，所以尽早与他们合作。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;6. &lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;您的同事指出了所有需要解决的&lt;em>;其他&lt;/em>;问题。&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;此回复假设存在某种可测量的限制公司吸收积极变革的能力——而你正危险地接近这条线。人们往往会低估公司适应更好现实的能力（以及持续无所作为的真正成本）。您提出的问题需要快速响应，这反映了挫败感、平庸，以及某些组织中现状的真正痛苦。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;7. &lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;你不断听说未来的状态，变革的条件将会好得多。&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;这可能是我们看到的最常见的抵制表达：幻想在未来的某个时刻改变事情会更容易。根据我们的经验，这种情况几乎从来不会发生，而且通常情况恰恰相反。你现在拥有的清晰度和动力是巨大的资产，但它们也是易逝的。在大多数情况下，“现在的紧迫性”会赢得胜利，尤其是当你周围的人的成功和福祉处于危险之中时。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;8.行动的时间表越来越长。&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;这是另一种常见的拖延策略，是针对第 6 项和第 7 项中表达的担忧提出的解药。您的诊断在概念层面上得到了接受，但提议的变革的时间表漫长而模糊。将这种发展视为一种生存威胁。当谈到解决关键任务问题时，现在就是采取行动的最佳时机。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;9. &lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;你的同事认为他们可以等你。&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;管理思想领袖 Earl Sasser 称之为“肾结石管理”——假设这也会过去。明确表示你不会去任何地方，最好是面带微笑。如果你不是老板，那就每天早上带着一杯咖啡出现在她的办公室，就像她喜欢的那样，直到你让她参与进来。顺便说一句，这一举动从未让我们失望过。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;10。您不断听到，“我们已经尝试过了。”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;公司可能已经在努力解决您所提出的问题的某些版本，除了遗留问题之外，没有什么可以展示的的挫败感和愤世嫉俗。如果是这样，请做好功课，并从出现的问题中吸取教训。无论如何，背景会发生变化，包括你愿意在这些问题上发挥领导作用的非常重要的背景。 &lt;em>;您之前&lt;/em>;没有尝试过，这将会带来很大的不同。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;em>;此摘录经过了轻微编辑。这是最初在 Frei 和 Morris 的上一本书中共享的列表的更新版本&lt;/em>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://store.hbr.org/product/unleashed-the-unapologetic-leader-s-guide- to-empowering-everyone-around-you/10245&quot;>;&lt;em>;释放：无悔领导者为周围的每个人赋权的指南&lt;/em>;&lt;/a>;&lt;em>;（哈佛商业评论出版社，2020）。&lt;/em>;

&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div >; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/how-one-health-system-got-rid-of-bureaucratic-busywork?language=es&quot;>;阅读西班牙语&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href =&quot;/2023/09/how-one-health-system-got-rid-of-bureaucratic-busywork?language=pt&quot;>;葡萄牙语&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;数字技术遍及各个行业已被证明是简化流程和自动化工作流程的强大工具。在医疗保健领域，电子健康记录 (EHR) 的引入被誉为解决纸质系统效率低下的突破性方法。但正如许多医疗保健提供者现在了解到的那样，将毫无意义或设计不当的流程数字化可能会让员工更难完成工作。这些数字是显而易见的：《内科年鉴》中的一项研究显示，门诊医生仅花费 27他们每天 % 的时间用于面对面的患者护理，而一半的时间花在电子病历和案头工作上。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这种不平衡是三重威胁。它欺骗了患者，剥夺了他们与医疗保健提供者在一起的宝贵时间。它加剧了护士和医生的倦怠，他们认为过度的官僚主义是&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.medscape.com/slideshow/2023-lifestyle-burnout-6016058?faf=1#6&quot;>;主要原因&lt;/a>;。而且成本高昂——美国医疗保健系统每年在管理上的支出高达 1 万亿美元，占总支出的四分之一。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;尽管有些人对此抱有希望 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastcompany .com/90890543/how-ai-can-be-used-to-cut-a-1-trillion-healthcare-problem&quot;>;生成式人工智能将有助于简化文书工作，&lt;/a>;这些预测仍然是推测性的。与此同时，有一种行之有效的补救措施可以减轻行政负担。该解决方案并不依赖于花哨的算法，而是致力于消除官僚主义的低效率和简化工作流程。以夏威夷太平洋健康中心 (HPH) 为例，这是一个非盈利系统，在阿罗哈州的四家医院拥有 7,000 名员工。&lt;/p>; &lt;article-promo>; &lt;hbr-component type=&quot;promo&quot; is-insight=&quot; sight-center&quot; title=&quot;运营新时代&quot; dek=&quot;提高效率并增强弹性。&quot; cta-text=&quot;&quot; href=&quot;/insight-center/the-new-age-of-operations&quot;>;

提高效率并增强弹性。 &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hbr-component>; &lt;/article-promo>; &lt;p>;故事始于 2017 年儿科医生 Melinda Ashton 博士担任 HPH 首席质量官。在她的角色中，阿什顿越来越担心大量的行政任务正在侵蚀医务人员直接照顾病人的时间。在 HPH 内部，人们对不必要的忙碌工作和繁琐的系统的抱怨越来越多。医生和护士尤其沮丧的是，他们每天花费大量时间机械地点击屏幕上迷宫般的提示，每当他们需要更新患者的护理记录时，屏幕上就会弹出提示。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当一组护士决定计算他们和他们的同伴记录他们完成每小时查房这一简单事实所花费的时间。研究小组估计，这项敷衍的任务每月要耗费 1,700 个护理时间。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这一发现是困扰临床医生的不必要摩擦的完美象征，将阿什顿推向了崩溃的边缘。她大胆而务实，向高管同事提出了一个激进的想法：召集 HPH 的所有医务人员开展一场“摆脱愚蠢的东西”运动。这个直率的名字引起了高管们的不满，一些人建议使用“行政简化”等更温和的术语，但阿什顿坚持自己的立场。诚实地承认问题并明确解决问题的意图至关重要。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;“摆脱愚蠢的东西”建议&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;摆脱Stupid Stuff (GROSS) 于 2017 年 10 月推出。鼓励临床医生识别 EHR 中设计不当、不必要或完全无意义的任何内容。提交表格非常简单，可以在 HPH 的互联网上轻松访问。&lt;/p>; &lt;div>; &lt;figure>; &lt;img aria-scribedby=&quot;caption-attachment-364148&quot;

&lt;p>;其他提名针对流程这是必要的，但需要大幅提升效率。例如，从急诊室出院的患者必须对就诊后的总结进行数字签名，然后打印、扫描并上传回系统。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;从想法到行动&lt;/ strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;该倡议实施的第一年，HPH 员工提交了近 200 条建议。这些内容由 Ashton 部门的两位护理领导进行了审核，他们在 IT 和质量改进方面都拥有丰富的经验。 GROSS 核心团队开发了一种简单但有效的分类机制。&lt;/p>; &lt;div>; &lt;figure>; &lt;img aria-scribedby=&quot;caption-attachment-364149&quot; src=&quot;/resources/images/article_assets/2023/09/W230905_HAMEL_GROSS_DECISION_TREE_360 .png&quot; >; &quot; title=&quot;摆脱“愚蠢的东西”（GROSS）决策树。&quot;

&lt;/div>; &lt;p>;简单的修复，例如删除非新生儿患者的“绳索”提示，由 GROSS 团队直接处理。需要进一步审查和详细说明的想法由现有质量和 EHR 工作处理这些团队代表不同的医院领域，对提名进行审查和优先排序。当一个“愚蠢的东西”想法获得批准时，工作组将邀请原始提名背后的个人帮助重新设计。&lt;/p>; &lt;在某些情况下，找到解决方案还意味着与对特定实践的优点有不同观点的临床小组进行联络。例如，急诊科的医生更喜欢填写简单的一次性抗生素处方，而住院医生则热衷于防止给药延迟，通常会选择重复处方，这需要更多时间才能输入。由工作组来确定这些冲突并设计最佳解决方案。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一小部分提交的内容（大约八分之一）遇到了重大监管或技术障碍，并被判定为“不合格”。这个时候有可能。”当这种情况发生时，GROSS 团队会写一份回复，解释为什么修复不可行。我们的目标始终是承认每一项提名，并在重新设计的障碍似乎无法克服时保持透明。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;更广泛的影响&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;GROSS 的第二年将产生另外 300 项提名。在所有可行的想法中，大约 10% 涉及明显愚蠢的活动，可以立即终止； 15% 的人指出临床沟通和对必要工作流程的支持方面存在差距；其余 75% 确定了重新设计机会以提高效率和效果。除了在 HPH 中节省了数千个小时之外，GROSS 计划还对组织的文化产生了影响，主要是通过授权一线团队成员挑战那些使他们的工作变得不必要的困难和低效的系统和流程。正如阿什顿在《新英格兰医学杂志》的一篇文章中所说：&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp1809698&quot;>;新英格兰医学杂志&lt;/a>;：&lt;/em>; “……我们周围有很多愚蠢的事情，尽管我们收到的许多提名并不是为了做出重大改变，但来自认可和改进我们日常工作的小胜利确实很重要。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;其他医院包括克利夫兰诊所和&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8294464/&quot;>;西奈山卫生系统&lt;/a>;在内的系统已注意到 Dr.阿什顿的工作实施了他们自己版本的“摆脱愚蠢的东西”。看到在整个医疗保健系统中推广这种方法的潜力，美国医学会 (AMA) 推出了&lt;a href=&quot;https://edhub.ama-assn.org/steps-forward/module/2757858&quot;>;GROSS 模块&lt; /a>; 作为其标志性实践改进计划“STEPS Forward”的一部分。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;前线主动性和情报&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;博士。阿什顿的个人领导力和主动性是夏威夷太平洋航空​​公司成功的关键。她毫不拐弯抹角——她直言不讳地指出这些“愚蠢的东西”的本质。但这一努力的真正魔力在于利用该组织集体智慧的力量。总部的人，无论意图多么善意，都不是在第一线，因此无法衡量官僚愚蠢行为的真正成本。护士、医生和其他在第一线工作的人看到了系统的不足之处。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;然而，仅有想法是不够的。阿什顿博士和他的团队之所以成功，是因为他们在后续工作中遵守纪律、深思熟虑。 GROSS 不仅仅是一个电子意见箱，它是一个跨部门和学科过滤、优先考虑和执行有前途的想法的系统。该计划产生了有意义的成果——以多种方式改善临床医生和患者的生活。其重要性足以证明根除多余官僚主义的艰苦努力是值得的。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;面对根深蒂固的规范和流程，人们很容易屈服于无助感，接受现状作为不可改变的现实；人们也很容易相信技术会解决所有问题。然而，夏威夷太平洋医疗保健公司 (Hawaii Pacific Healthcare) 的 GROSS 计划的故事却提供了令人信服的反面叙述。这个故事提醒我们，通过简单、智能的流程改进，我们确实可以挑战和重塑束缚我们的操作系统。&lt;/p>;

&lt;span>;&lt;p>;在高度模糊和具有挑战性的环境中，随机决策方法具有许多优势。自二战以来，运营经理一直在使用随机决策（随机搜索用于在公海定位敌方潜艇），但尚未认真应用于战略决策，战略决策仍然侧重于假设的制定和检验。 &amp;#160;在这篇文章中，作者解释了随机决策的战略优势 &amp;#8212;早期优势、更快的学习速度、更少的可预测性以及更少的偏见——并就如何将随机性纳入策略制定过程提供建议。&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/ the-strategic-benefits-of-randomized-decision-making?language=es&quot;>;阅读西班牙语&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/the-strategic-benefits-of-randomized-decision -making?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;纳斯卡皮人是魁北克省和拉布拉多省的土著游牧民族，他们的大部分食物都是靠狩猎获得的。那么，你可能会想到，在哪里狩猎的关键决定中需要进行大量的分析和战略制定：纳斯卡皮人可能记录了他们猎杀了多少驼鹿或驯鹿，以确保他们不会过度开发他们的狩猎场；他们可能制定了系统计划，定期探索新地区以发现新的牛群；或者他们可能试图预测在不同景观（如山谷、丘陵或河流沿岸）找到特定兽群的可能性。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;相反，该部落与许多其他古代民族一样，依赖于&lt;a href =&quot;https://anthrosource.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1525/aa.1957.59.1.02a00060&quot;>;占卜&lt;/a>;。就纳斯卡皮人而言，这包括将死去动物的肩胛骨加热至破裂的程度。他们沿着裂缝所指向的方向开始狩猎。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这种仪式会让大多数人觉得迷信和武断，实际上使他们的战略决策变得随机。但这正是重点。这个过程的随机性使纳斯卡皮人能够解决快速选择狩猎地点的复杂问题，没有偏见，也不会被猎物预测。因此，他们避免花费过多的时间和精力来寻找理想的狩猎场，并在充满敌意的亚北极生存了数百年。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;纳斯卡皮人的占卜实践之间看似难以置信的联系他们在恶劣环境中茁壮成长的能力可以扩展到商业环境中。我们将了解人们目前如何利用随机化来制定运营决策，并讨论将这种方法应用于战略如何使企业像纳斯卡皮那样蓬勃发展。最后，我们将提供有关公司如何将随机性引入其战略决策过程的提示。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;当今的随机化&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;随机决策已被证明是成功的在现代也是如此——尤其是在运营管理方面。第二次世界大战期间，盟军面临着严峻的挑战，例如根据最后一次目击的位置来确定在广阔的开放水域中哪里可以找到敌方潜艇。这个问题很严重，因为船只可能采取的路径非常多，而且自己的舰队中没有足够的船只或飞机来在敌方潜艇再次袭击之前进行系统、彻底的搜索。在这些情况下，&lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/b100809&quot;>;研究&lt;/a>;表明，快速随机选择几个位置进行搜索，然后使用方向的随机变化胜过每一步都提前预先计划的系统搜索。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;大约在同一时间，研究人员致力于 &lt;a href=&quot;https://permalink.lanl.gov/object /tr?what=info:lanl-repo/lareport/LA-UR-86-2600-05&quot;>;曼哈顿项目&lt;/a>;发明了蒙特卡罗模拟，这是一种依靠随机抽样来估计复杂系统结果的方法或过程，其中环境条件本身表现出随机性。科学家们使用这种方法来预测不同炸弹设计和屏蔽材料的性能。蒙特卡罗模拟继续广泛用于不确定条件下的决策，特别是在金融和物流领域。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;如今，随机化通常用于提高机器学习技术的效率和准确性。例如，神经网络的初始参数通常是随机选择的，以避免网络陷入特定配置。扩大搜索空间增加了找到高级配置的机会。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;更平常地说，包裹递送公司已经利用随机优化技术来确定跨一系列不同场景的稳健路线（例如，考虑到运输量等因素） 、时间窗口、车辆可用性和道路封闭情况每天都在变化）。还有一些证据表明，大型产品和社交系统的设计者对&lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/smj.757&quot;>;何时进行随机选择和何时进行选择具有直觉。何时优化&lt;/a>;，基于对问题复杂性的估计。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;战略怎么样？&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;与运营管理相比，战略-制作仍然是一种顽固的&lt;a href=&quot;/2012/09/your-strategy-needs-a-strategy&quot;>;确定性实践&lt;/a>;，通常首先尝试完全理解问题，然后部署分析来创建解决这个问题的计划。大数据革命鼓励了这种方法，让我们相信一切都可以被了解和分析，以制定可靠的策略。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但这种信念忽视了这样一个事实：同一份数据可以用来争论不同的，甚至相反的行动方针。例如，柯达在观察到数码摄影需求不断增长后，做出的反应是加倍投资传统胶片业务，以确保不会蚕食其销售。与此同时，索尼和佳能等竞争对手也对同样的信息做出了反应，大力投资研发以改进数码相机技术。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;对大数据解决方案的信心也让人们对计算挑战视而不见。组织活动往往紧密耦合并密集互动——相互之间以及与超出公司边界的力量相互作用。因此，大量的因果路径、因素和网络共同决定了任何结果。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;即使是战略发挥作用的基础上看似“简单”的问题，例如您选择谁事实上，带头解决问题的过程是&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hbs.edu/ris/Publication%20Files/19-072_1da6ef3d-ac69-47d7-aec3-3f7616c0e3f9.pdf&quot;>;大&lt; /a>;.部分原因是不同的人可以拥有多种不同的权力，例如发起决策、奖励或共享信息，因此分配不同级别权力的方式也有多种。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;最后，考虑到当今世界的变化速度和波动性，实时收集和分析确定性方法解决问题所需的所有信息已变得不可行，而且消费者和竞争对手的行为模式也会不断变化，以应对问题。做出的任何举动。您总能找到能够可靠地预测现实复杂的商业或政治世界中战略决策结果的算法，这一想法将属于&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation_series&quot;>;在可预见的未来，科幻小说的领域&lt;/a>;。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在这种背景下，战略不再是确定单一的最佳行动方案。相反，战略的目标必须从制定计划转变为构建&lt;a href=&quot;/2023/05/why-conflicting-ideas-can-make-your-strategy-stronger&quot;>;选项组合&lt;/a>;其中可以构成未来成功的基础。然而，在传统的战略制定方法中，建立这种选择性是低效的，因为寻找多种可能的解决方案可能成本高昂且耗时。 &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/05/radical-optionity&quot;>;考虑到这些因素&lt;/a>;，也许战略家们是时候借鉴 Naskapi 的做法，在面对大规模的复杂问题时采用他们的智能随机化方法了。 ，未知的，不断变化的风景。让我们看看可能带来哪些好处。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;早期优势&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;考虑一下公司&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider. com/how-twitter-was-founded-2011-4&quot;>;Odeo&lt;/a>;，该公司建立了一个在线播客平台，2005 年，当苹果宣布将推出自己的竞争平台作为其一部分时，该平台发现自己面临着难以克服的困难每一台 iPod 上都有 iTunes。 Odeo 的公司领导认识到需要进行彻底的转变，并开始举行为期一天的“头脑风暴”会议，集体随机搜索新方向。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;源自这些会议的一个想法是建立一个用于分享状态的在线平台与朋友和追随者一起，在最近更名之前，它被称为 Twitter。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;考虑到 Odeo 所处的情况，制定战略路线图的时间有限，更不用说进行任何有意义的活动了。在已经很拥挤的领域进行市场研究或竞争对手分析，使用 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2014/feb/04/facebook-in-numbers-statistics&quot;>;Facebook&lt; /a>; 和 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statista.com/chart/26176/estimated-number-of-myspace-users-at-key-milestones/&quot;>;MySpace&lt;/a>; 各吸引了数十名当时每月有数百万活跃用户。相反，Twitter 是作为最小可行产品 (MVP) 推出的，为 Odeo 提供了生存的选择，并通过在平台上不断迭代实现蓬勃发展。 （具有讽刺意味的是，Odeo 的投资者并没有意识到 Twitter 的潜力，并允许该公司管理层以约 500 万美元的价格回购其股票，约为埃隆·马斯克 2022 年购买该平台费用的 0.01%。）&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一个重要的教训Twitter 例子的一个特点是，对于许多问题，解决方案只有在足够快的实施速度下才有意义——这与纳斯卡派仪式所带来的好处相同。 &amp;nbsp;如果 Naskapi 全面分析了他们的解决方案，他们所寻找的群体可能会继续前进。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;像 Twitter 一样，许多最著名的创业企业都从先行者中受益随机决策和快速行动带来的优势。第一个 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/pictures/54f4e70eda47a54de8244f8b/the-original-35mm-hero/&quot;>;GoPro&lt;/a>; 由一个腕带和塑料外壳组成，外壳是廉价的现成的-架子数码相机。建立客户关系并迭代第一个设计，使该公司能够在索尼、尼康和 Garmin 等几家重量级公司后来进入运动相机市场时站稳脚跟。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;随机化对于现有企业也同样适用- 可以说&lt;span>;更容易&lt;/span>;，因为他们有更多的资源可以利用。随着在线购物市场开始同时沿着不同的路径发展（走向像谷歌购物这样的基于搜索的模式，像天猫这样的多商店模式，以及像亚马逊这样的综合商店模式），阿里巴巴 &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/06 /the-self-tuning-enterprise&quot;>;没有等到&lt;/a>;能够可靠地预测获胜模型。相反，它拆分了业务，并为所有三种未来场景开发了解决方案，变得比以往任何时候都更加强大，因为事实证明所有新的细分市场都将继续存在。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;更快的学习&lt;/ strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;越早开始也意味着你学得更快。例如，尽早启动 MVP 会通过激发竞争对手和客户的反应来生成信息，从而为您的下一步行动提供信息。对于纳斯卡皮人来说，在狩猎中遵循神圣的方向意味着他们会经常有新的发现，例如水源、临时定居点或潜在的狩猎场。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;了解更多以当代的例子为例，考虑像 ChatGPT 这样的大型语言模型，它的工作原理是根据之前的单词预测可能的下一个单词。程序员可以通过称为“温度”的设置来控制此过程的准确度 - 温度越高，算法就越不可能选择预测与之前的单词最匹配的单词。提高温度会降低准确性，但会增加创造性的惊喜，这可能是用户所期望的，并且还具有创造更多输出变化的好处，进而增加用户反应，从而使模型随着时间的推移而改进。&lt;/p>; &lt;当然，企业知道实验的价值。几十年来，实体零售店一直在尝试货架布局。在数字环境中，公司定期进行 A/B 测试来优化网站设计、产品推荐或定价模型。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但测试和实验的规模和速度通常被低估，部分原因是测试通常是旨在证明或反驳一个精确的假设，该假设本身是基于一个基本稳定的环境。结果，如果战略家调高温度并进行不太精确、更多样化和更频繁的测试，他们学到的东西就会比他们能学到的东西少。例如，&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/random-testing-in-software-testing/&quot;>;随机测试&lt;/a>;通常用于补充软件开发中的假设驱动测试。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;可预测性较低&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;采用随机策略 - 在所有可用的移动中以相同的概率进行选择 - 是（重复）游戏中唯一的最佳策略 &lt; a href=&quot;https://blogs.cornell.edu/info2040/2014/09/12/applying-nash-equilibrium-to-rock-paper-and-scissors/&quot;>;石头、剪刀、布&lt;/a>;，因为这是唯一不允许出现某种占主导地位的反策略的策略。在更复杂的环境中，例如在国际象棋中，有几个著名的 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/29/crosswords/chess/a-knight-sacrifice-by-topalov- Sends-anand-into-a-tailspin.html&quot;>;示例&lt;/a>;：玩家做出的看似随机（或至少违反直觉）的举动，为他们面对更强大的对手的游戏带来了复杂性和压力&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这一好处早已被一些金融机构认识到，它们利用随机性来混淆其交易策略。通过利用“无味算法”，机构可以避免发出随机延迟以及订单时间和规模变化的信号，而其他市场参与者可能会利用这些信号在更有能力的交易者分析的支持下登记收益。一个更简单的例子是“&lt;a href=&quot;https://uxknowledgebase.com/fake-door-testing-48af0616185a&quot;>;假门测试&lt;/a>;”，其中随机产品或促销配置在线呈现给消费者以供学习引起反应，同时给竞争对手提供很少的线索。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;减少&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;偏见&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;经理通常倾向于&lt; a href=&quot;/2015/11/dont-let-your-company-get-trapped-by-success&quot;>;复制过去的成功方法&lt;/a>;，同时不太容易接受新想法或外部信号。随着周围环境的变化，这可能会导致其衰退。众所周知的例子比比皆是：当需求和竞争条件发生根本性变化时，百视达和诺基亚遵循“经过考验的真实方法”，从而带来了灾难性的后果。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;拥抱随机性可以为这个问题提供解决方案。在自然界中，进化——随机突变与自然选择压力相结合——确保物种不断适应不断变化的环境。进化算法的设计者从生物现象中学习，快速生成大问题解决方案的随机片段，然后将其组装成试验解决方案，并根据目标或适应度函数进行评估。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在政治领域在背景下，人类几千年来一直在利用随机化。例如，在古代雅典，采用抽签制度来选举地方法官，以确保富人和有权势的人不会通过收买获得权力。在商业环境中，组织可以轻松地采用随机行为来突破政治操纵和谈判的迷宫，这些政治操纵和谈判伴随着预算分配给一个或多个竞争性替代方案，每个方案都有自己的支持者并利用私人数据。由于随机选择可能的选项是公正的，因此没有人会感到受到不公平的排斥。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;并非所有反对变革的偏见都是先前成功的产物。在高度消极的环境中，人类会陷入习得性无助，在这种情况下，重复的经历会让一个人相信自己没有能力改变自己的环境，因此，他们甚至不会尝试做出决定。在这种情况下采用随机过程进行决策可能会抵消这种不作为的偏见。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;如何将随机性引入战略制定&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;我们的标准心理随机性的形象是抛硬币或掷骰子。但对于现实生活中的问题，使用这些技术需要首先了解、枚举和评估所有选项——这几乎与分析最佳策略的方法相同。尽管如此，战略家仍然可以利用各种策略将随机性纳入他们的工具箱，并及时确定一个可能足够好的解决方案，使其发挥作用。&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;&lt;strong>;改变起点。&lt;/strong>; &lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;与机器学习算法一样，使用随机提示来改变搜索的起点。例如，为了帮助音乐家释放他们的创造力，布莱恩·伊诺和彼得·施密特制作了一副卡片，上面附有鼓励横向思维的说明，例如“改变乐器角色”、“强调缺陷”或“戴上耳塞”。在创作过程中引入机会元素有助于克服创意障碍，并确保艺术家不会陷入熟悉的习惯和模式。&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;&lt;strong>;改变节奏。&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p >;改变搜索的速度或节奏（反馈循环的长度）。很多时候，团队和团体都被季度报告、月度审查和每周会议的“节拍器”所困。但是，要智能地随机化，您可能必须在天甚至小时的时间尺度上进行操作。&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;&lt;strong>;改变轨迹。&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;您是否在搜索解决方案靠近你现在所在的地方还是很远？随机跳转可以将您带到之前未考虑过的搜索空间部分，从而帮助您解冻您的战略决策。例如，研究表明，在猎物稀缺的公海中，鱼类使用的搜索模式包括搜索区域之间偶尔但极长的“步长”长度，遵循称为莱维飞行的数学模式。&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;&lt;strong>;改变启发式。&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;您是自上而下还是自下而上搜索？深度优先还是广度优先？并非所有大问题都会产生相同的搜索策略。有些工作比其他工作更好，并且不存在解决任何问题的“最佳方法”。&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;&lt;strong>;改变搜索者。&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;让不同的人负责用于搜索或搜索的不同方面。由于不同的人有不同的内在偏见、成见和首选方法，因此在不同的问题解决者之间进行随机化也将帮助您在可能的解决方案中进行随机化。&lt;/p>; &lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;。 。 .&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;过去，公司渴望成为“无所不知”的组织，能够理解和控制其环境，从而能够清楚地规划出一条最佳路径。一些公司在认识到“无所不知”已不再可能后，转而采用“学习一切”的心态，不断&lt;a href=&quot;/2015/06/the-self-tuning-enterprise&quot;>;微调&lt; /a>; 他们在新信息出现时采取的方法。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;虽然这种方法仍然很强大，但我们相信它可以进一步扩展，以创建一种“搜索全部”方法，其中重点放在积极探索环境以生成有价值的信息，从而能够快速有效地开发可选性。快速、随机的选择可以帮助您实现这一目标。这让我们回到了纳斯卡皮人，他们的迷信仪式看起来越来越像是面对复杂、模糊的挑战时做出的明智决策。&lt;/p>;

&lt;/div>; &lt;p>;事实并非如此很久以前，人工智能被认为是精英专家或数据科学家的领域。公司热情洋溢地谈论它改变业务的潜力，但只有一小部分员工能够使用它。借助生成式人工智能，游戏规则发生了变化——突然间，借助 OpenAI 的 ChatGPT、Google 的 Bard 或 Anthropic 的 Claude 2 等工具，每个人都成为了潜在的程序员。但是，当我们实现这些技术飞跃时，每个组织仍然需要一项基本的、长期的能力实现人工智能的真正潜力：判断。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HRqRUWWj58&quot;>;人工智能时代的判断&lt;/a>;的想法这是我们已故同事和富有远见的朋友亚历山德罗·迪·菲奥雷 (Alessandro Di Fiore) 工作的核心原则。亚历山德罗坚信以人为本，并认为技术是帮助人们增强创造力、自主性和批判性思维的一种方式。作为&lt;a href=&quot;/search?term=alessandro%20di%20fiore&quot;>;《哈佛商业评论》的频繁撰稿人&lt;/a>;（以及&lt;em>;哈佛商业评论意大利版&lt;/em>;前主席），他经常反思如何创新、领导力和人工智能齐头并进。在&lt;a href=&quot;/2018/08/why-ai-will-shift-decision-making-from-the-c-suite-to-the-frontline&quot;>;这篇 2018 年文章&lt;/a>;中，他认为随着人工智能越来越容易为所有员工所接受，判断力将变得与任何技术技能一样重要。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Alessandro 认为，随着人工智能系统上升到新的通用操作标准，判断力将成为组织真正的竞争优势。但仅靠强化技能并不能培养更好的判断力。公司将需要从根本上重新思考如何看待和部署判断，以适应变化的步伐。值得注意的是，亚历山德罗认为判断的三个关键方面对于此时至关重要：&lt;strong>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;访问&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;这说明了谁有权或允许做出判断。作为&lt;a href=&quot;https://store.hbr.org/product/the-democratization-of-judgment/ROT357&quot;>;判断民主化&lt;/a>;的早期倡导者，亚历山德罗知道做出正确的决策并不是一件容易的事仅限于最高管理层。随着知识、数据和技术的分布更加广泛，判断力也必须更加广泛地分布。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;公司需要了解如何&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.capgemini.com/insights/research -library/generative-ai-in-organizations/&quot;>;利用和扩展生成式人工智能，并试图禁止这种访问最终将是徒劳的。确保您的员工能够使用所有方式来释放这些工具的价值是转型的一部分，当然是以安全和受控的方式进行的。这需要信任和沟通。但领导者应该考虑到，越来越多的新用例和实践必然会自下而上地出现，而不是自上而下地搅动。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;练习&lt;/strong>; &lt;strong>;判断力&lt;/strong>; &lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;这指的是决定或形成意见的行为或过程。亚历山德罗认为判断是一个连续的过程，而不是一个单一的时刻：&lt;/p>; &lt;blockquote>; &lt;p>;&lt;em>;判断不仅仅在评估数据和信息做出决策的时刻进行。判断比这更广泛，它始于提出正确的问题，构建正确的问题，评估更广泛的背景。判断是共同创造的，它是一个旅程。&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>; &lt;/blockquote>; &lt;p>;这种判断的概念在今天更加正确。生成式人工智能的兴起将判断力扩展到了离散决策之外——现在它是一个人机协作过程。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;借助人工智能聊天机器人，上下文交互的重要性显而易见。判断是通过人类与人工智能的综合对话而不是分离的领域产生的。我们最近关于 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hbritalia.it/userUpload/ebook_Generative_AI_inglese.pdf&quot;>;生成式 AI 如何增强 10 种流行管理实践&lt;/a>;的 ChatGPT 实验就是一个很好的例子。在与ChatGPT进行有意义的对话时，我们必须在提示之前、期间和之后锻炼我们的判断能力，输入正确的上下文，精心设计最佳的提示链，并仔细解释建议。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;实验证实亚历山德罗的直觉：理想的结果出现在人类和机器智能的交叉点上。正确判断的未来就是这种共生的共同创造过程。这种转变要求全面的人员转型和再培训，为工人提供人工智能时代必不可少的判断能力。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;控制&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;这与系统有关或监督或检查决策的流程。传统的控制方法很快就会过时。严格的自上而下的监督可能会扼杀这种新范式的敏捷性。然而，如果道德人工智能开发和部署原则没有在组织中根深蒂固，那么完全不受约束的自治也会带来风险。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;该解决方案由两部分组成：首先，在系统中建立信任和责任 &lt;a href= “https://www.capgemini.com/about-us/who-we-are/our-values/our-ethical-culture/our-code-of-ethics-for-ai/&quot;>;道德准则&lt;/ a>; 为了公平、安全和可持续的使用，并防止人工智能模型产生不准确的信息或产生与公司价值观相矛盾的响应；其次，为用户提供有关如何为人类人工智能决策设置正确背景的培训。第二部分涉及解释提示的适当界限并负责任地构建查询。领导层不应只关注微观批准的选择，而应重点关注为各个级别的员工提供这些技能。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在这一愿景中，&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.imd.org/ibyimd/team-建立/控制系统-让员工自由的七种方法/&quot;>;控制从官僚把关转变为培养集体责任。正如亚历山德罗所写，“领导者有责任设定正确的背景和条件，使员工能够在数据和技术的帮助下做出更自主的决策。给予自由是好的。但帮助他们行使自由更为重要。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Alessandro 的愿景强调了在人工智能重塑社会时做出正确判断的必要性。在我们努力实现人类与技术无缝协作、促进创新和进步的未来时，他的遗产仍然是源源不断的灵感源泉。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;未来仍然由我们通过愿景、道德和负责任的创新来塑造。&lt; /p>; &lt;!-- 引文 -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 25 Sep 2023 22:25:02 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Using Technology to Improve Supply-Chain Resilience]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/09/using-technology-to-improve-supply-chain-resilience]]><description>&lt;div>;

&lt;span>;&lt;p>;Covid-19 大流行导致许多全球供应链陷入停顿。当我们摆脱疫情影响时，许多公司采取了“以防万一库存管理”的做法，结果矫枉过正。更重要的是，当消费者信心每月差异很大且需求持续波动时，企业很难制定计划。例如，在服装行业，买家必须提前六个月下旺季订单。由于波动性较大，6 月份的需求预测可能与 12 月份的实际需求完全不同。这增加了要么因供应不足而错过季节的总体风险，要么在一月份面临大幅降价的风险。为了向前发展，供应链管理者需要在贸易伙伴之间建立更灵活、动态的连接，以取代目前无法适应突然、意外的供应链中断的点对点、静态连接。他们需要的是一个更现代化、反应更灵敏的供应链平台。本文讨论当今的供应链技术如何帮助企业增强其供应链的弹性。&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/using-technology-to-improve-supply-chain-resilience?language=es&quot;>;阅读西班牙语&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/using -technology-to-improve-supply-chain-resilience?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;Covid-19 大流行从根本上动摇了全球供应链，但它们尚未完全恢复。更重要的是，许多以前遵循“精益”原则（包括“及时库存管理”）的管理者已经通过采用“以防万一库存管理”而矫枉过正了。这种通过临时且不明确的“以防万一”库存策略进行过度纠正（和库存过剩）的倾向，导致零售、批发和制造业的全球库存飙升，而此时商业信心指数却处于低位。和消费者信心指数&lt;a href=&quot;https://data.oecd.org/leadind/consumer-confidence-index-cci.htm#indicator-chart&quot;>;均显示出异常波动&lt;/a>;。当消费者信心每月差异很大时，企业就很难制定计划。例如，在服装行业，买家必须提前六个月下旺季订单。由于波动性较大，6 月份的需求预测可能与 12 月份的实际需求完全不同。这增加了要么因为没有足够的东西而错过这个季节的总体风险，要么在一月份面临巨大的降价。&lt;/p>;

&lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;利用现代技术平台构建供应链弹性&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;供应链管理技术平台可以通过允许企业在多个层面上建立弹性：&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;&lt;strong>;通过提高供应链可见性建立统一的商务。&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;面临的最重大挑战之一如今的零售商正在跨多种渠道（例如在线、实体店以及将两者结合起来的混合模式）精心策划无缝的消费者体验。许多杂货店开发了创新技术，允许客户在线下订单，在订单准备好时通知客户，然后检测客户何时在附近，从而创造无缝的客户体验。网络范围内的库存可见性对于实现统一商务至关重要。通过网络范围内的库存可视性，公司可以避免缺货和库存过剩的情况，从而降低持有成本并提高客户满意度。通过利用 RFID、物联网传感器和数据分析等先进跟踪技术，企业可以实时了解库存水平、位置和移动情况，从而做出更好的数据驱动决策。&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;进行销售和合作运营规划。&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;成功的销售和运营规划 (S&amp;OP) 需要来自广泛职能部门的领导参与，包括财务、销售、营销、生产和履行。幸运的是，随着现代协作平台取代过时的工具以提供单一的真实数据源、直观的建模和性能仪表板，这变得更加容易。如果执行得当，S&amp;OP 使公司能够预测未来需求并主动响应市场变化。这种方法还有助于风险管理和应急计划，使企业能够减轻供应链中断或经济波动的影响。&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;实施 SaaS 系统。&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;软件即服务 (SaaS) ）彻底改变了全球企业和个人的软件交付、访问和使用方式，对全球技术实施产生了深远影响。对于供应链管理人员来说，SaaS 通过允许每个阶段（例如原材料、生产、加工、仓储和分销）共享信息、操作和见解来扩展覆盖范围和可见性。&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;创建灵活且开放的云&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;日益增加的复杂性和不断的重组要求供应链技术能够轻松集成并快速调整，这意味着可组合架构特别适合现代供应链。与乐高™套装一样，可组合架构允许通过组合更小的模块化组件来构建复杂的系统，这些组件可以轻松组装、互连和重复使用。管理员可以向池中添加新的硬件资源，而可组合基础架构可以自动将这些资源合并到可用池中。 New Balance 就是实践中的一个很好的例子。这家运动服装公司创建了一个单一的内容库，为其所有系统提供支持——可穿戴设备、移动设备、信息亭等。与从头开始为每个系统重建 New Balance 商务体验不同，使用适合各种情况的通用可组合架构要有效得多。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;技术是卓越供应链背后的驱动力&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;虽然遵循这种方法对于构建能够承受不可预见的干扰的弹性供应链至关重要，但也可以利用最新技术来构建更强大的供应链系统，从而使整个组织取得成功。有远见的高管不会仅仅依靠技术来生存，而是会利用技术来帮助他们的企业蓬勃发展。这里采用的策略会因组织而异，但以下是可以创建更强大供应链的几种广泛方法：&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;利用人工智能/机器学习来支持供应链管理。&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;人工智能 (AI) 和机器学习 (ML) 引发了供应链管理的变革时代。 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mckinsey.com/capability/operations/our-insights/ai-driven-operations-forecasting-in-data-light-environments&quot;>;根据麦肯锡的说法&lt;/a>;，有效使用AI在库存控制中的应用，可实现库存持有成本降低20%，缺货率降低50%。通过利用先进的算法和数据分析，人工智能/机器学习技术提高了需求预测的准确性，使企业能够以前所未有的精度预测市场趋势、波动和客户偏好。这种预测能力有助于高效的库存管理、减少过剩库存并最大限度地减少缺货，从而优化营运资金。此外，人工智能/机器学习驱动的算法可优化物流、简化运输网络并降低成本。&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;&lt;strong>;进一步加强协作。 &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;疫情最明显、最持久的影响之一是它迫使企业各个层面的员工学习新的协作技能。 Zoom 每日会议参与者&lt;a href=&quot;https://investors.zoom.us/static-files/a17fd391-13ae-429b-8cb3-bfd95b61b007&quot;>;短短四个月内从 1000 万增加到 3 亿&lt;/a>; 。现实情况是，虽然组织内部的协作常常被证明具有挑战性，但供应链经理更需要在组织外部与客户、供应商和合作伙伴进行协作。这些管理者尤其需要依赖适当工具的实施，例如基于许可的专用网络，以提供安全、简单且可信的环境来共享供应链数据。&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;&lt;strong>;投资&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;自 2019 年以来，针对供应链的网络攻击&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statista.com/statistics/1367208/us-annual-number-of-受影响的供应链实体攻击数量增加了一倍&lt;/a>;。就在去年，攻击&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statista.com/statistics/1367208/us-annual-number-of-entities-impacted-supply-chain-attacks/&quot;>;增加了 200% 以上&lt;/a>;。在许多此类案例中，供应链中的安全漏洞是由供应商和承包商等第三方运营商暴露的。幸运的是，现代平台正在成为对抗网络攻击的最有效防御手段。虽然管理人员可能无法预测和防范每一种风险，但现代技术平台对于让组织领先威胁一步至关重要。&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;&lt;strong>;建立更高的供应链可见性。&lt;/strong>; &lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;传统上，整个供应链的可见性仅限于“向上”和“向下”，这意味着管理人员通常只能“看到”其一级供应商和直接客户在做什么。然而，在多级供应链中，运营商不会感受到三级或四级供应链中断的影响，直到调整时为时已晚。 Today, modern IT platforms enable trading partners to gather in a safe, permission-based exchange where they can share information, improving visibility and building resilience across the entire supply chain.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The pandemic illustrated that we need to do more than simply invest in building effective supply chains — we need to place an equal priority on maintaining them. Regardless of how much expertise went into the creation of an efficient and resilient supply chain — we must recognize that in our ever-changing world the supply chain is never a finished product. By keeping our supply chains in a constant beta state and investing in the technology and insights needed to continually elevate them, a global supply crunch can be avoided. The task of building a supply chain that responds to real-time inputs and evolves to meet shifting demands will never be truly finished, but that&#39;s no reason not to start.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 25 Sep 2023 21:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[How to Evaluate a Job Candidate&rsquo;s Critical Thinking Skills in an Interview]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/09/how-to-evaluate-a-job-candidates-critical-thinking-skills-in-an-interview]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/09/Sep23_23_152401239.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;Blend Images - Peathegee Inc/Getty Images&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;The oldest and still the most powerful tactic for fostering critical thinking is the Socratic method, developed over 2,400 years ago by Socrates, one of the founders of Western philosophy. The Socratic method uses thought-provoking question-and-answer probing to promote learning. It focuses on generating more questions than answers, where the answers are not a stopping point but the beginning of further analysis. Hiring managers can apply this model to create a different dialogue with candidates in a modern-day organization.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/how-to-evaluate-a-job-candidates-critical-thinking-skills-in-an-interview?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/how-to-evaluate-a-job-candidates-critical-thinking-skills-in-an-interview?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;Hiring is one of the most challenging competencies to master, yet it is one of the most strategic and impactful managerial functions. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/operations/our-insights/operations-blog/winning-the-war-for-talent-in-product-development&quot;>;A McKinsey study&lt;/a>; quantified that superior talent is up to eight times more productive, showing that the relationship between talent quality and business performance is dramatic. Organizations seeking growth or simply survival during difficult times must successfully recruit A-list talent, thought leaders, and subject matter experts. This is often done under time constraints as you must quickly fill a key position. Essentially you are committing to a long-term relationship after a few very short dates.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Now let&#39;s consider the typical process of hiring talent. The primary tool we use to assess talent is a set of job interviews. The typical interview process is a Q&amp;amp;A format where some version of the common questions are asked of the candidate: &lt;em>;Tell us about your background. Why do you want to work for us? Share a challenge you faced at work and how you dealt with it. What are you most proud of? What impact have you had? Why are you the best person for the job? What is your greatest achievement? What are your weaknesses?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;While much has been said in favor and against the value of interviews themselves, the typical Q&amp;amp;A job interview process fails to assess one of the most important, if not &lt;em>;the&lt;/em>; most important, skills you should be looking for from people you hire — critical thinking. Critical thinking is seeking information from various sources, assessing its credibility, and determining its relevance and veracity. Often classified as a higher-order skill, critical thinking is not a single skill but a collection of skills involving reasoning, constructing sound arguments, and identifying a situation&#39;s flaws, biases, logic, or inconsistencies. Critical thinking is different from creative thinking. Creative thinking is the ability to generate new, innovative ideas. Critical thinking requires the candidate to carefully and logically analyze facts and form a judgment.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Critical Thinking Is Fundamentally a Process of Questioning&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;A key insight &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Decisions-Over-Decimals-Intuition-Information/dp/111989848X&quot;>;from our research&lt;/a>;, based on surveying and teaching thousands of executives, is that the smartest person in the room is not the one with the answer but the person asking the question. They are curious, engaged, unafraid,&amp;nbsp; inquisitive, and ready to explore a new domain that may not have answers yet. By the nature of their questions, they demonstrate observation, analysis, inference, interrogation, interpretation, and explanation. Critical thinkers are curious. Innate curiosity has been shown to be associated with the following eight traits — avid learners, problem solvers, active listeners, self-driven, high productivity, growth mindset, overachievers, and strong at stakeholder management. The eight traits read like a wish list of qualifications for people you want to be part of your team.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Consulting firms and technology companies have pushed the standard battery of interview questions by using scenario-based or behavioral questions&lt;em>;: How much should you charge to mow a lawn in Atlanta? Why are utility holes round? How would you design a wine rack for people who are blind? If you received $5 million to solve a global problem, what issue would you address and how?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These are a good step forward in assessing candidates&#39; ability to ask questions, but while answers to these questions will analyze a candidate&#39;s problem-solving skills, ability to deal with ambiguity and creative thinking, it will not indicate if they are curious, self-starters, or passionate about your company, products, culture, or any of the eight traits referenced earlier.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But how do you identify individuals with this versatile and compelling mix of critical thinking and curiosity? Boldly &lt;em>;flip the interview process.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The oldest and still the most powerful tactic for fostering critical thinking is the Socratic method, developed over 2,400 years ago by Socrates, one of the founders of Western philosophy. The Socratic method uses thought-provoking question-and-answer probing to promote learning. It focuses on generating more questions than answers, where the answers are not a stopping point but the beginning of further analysis. Hiring managers can apply this model to create a different dialogue with candidates in a modern-day organization.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;The Flip Interview&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Let the candidate interview you. The flip interview is an alternate method to uncover a candidate&#39;s intrinsic strengths, preferred ways of working, and how they think. The interview will showcase the candidate&#39;s thinking and decision-making process and indicate if the candidate exhibits leadership traits.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The flip interview goes beyond letting the candidate ask you open-ended questions like, &lt;em>;What is the company culture?&lt;/em>; or &lt;em>;What is it like to work for the company?&lt;/em>; The interviewer comes to the discussion with a business scenario, an understanding of relevant information, and an invitation to the interviewee to guide discovery through a series of questions.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The interviewee may use four types of questions, which are increasing in their level of complexity and involvement.&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Factual questions: &lt;/strong>;Questions that have straightforward answers based on facts or awareness.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Convergent questions:&lt;/strong>; Close-ended questions with finite answers. Typically, these questions have one correct answer.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Divergent questions:&lt;/strong>; Open-ended questions that encourage many answers. These questions are a means for analyzing a situation, problem, or complexity in greater detail and stimulate creative thought.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Evaluative questions:&lt;/strong>; Questions that require deeper levels of thinking. The questions can be open or closed. Evaluative questions elicit analysis at multiple levels and from different perspectives to arrive at newly synthesized information or conclusions.&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;h2>;Conducting the Flip Interview: A Four-Step Process&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Use the following framework to maximize the value of your conversations with recruits:&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;1. Framing&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Briefly describe a scenario. State upfront you are the source of information for the scenario and ask the interviewee to drive the next 8-12 minutes with a straightforward “How would you start this discovery?” When they inevitably get stuck, prompt them with a branch of the decision tree that opens the discovery further. Invite them to ask questions.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Interviewer evaluation&lt;/strong>;: In the framing step, you evaluate how they frame the problem. Do they take the situation at face value or probe to get at the essence of the situation? The quality of the questions they ask should lead to determining the information they need, the effort required, and uncover the essential decision to be made. This first step is all about problem-finding more than problem-solving.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;2. Linking&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Once they define the problem, invite them to ask questions about context. “Given how they framed the scenario, what other information would they like to know to work towards a recommendation?”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Interviewer evaluation:&lt;/strong>; You are looking to see if their questions lead them to put the scenario in context. Context is king. To truly put a situation in context, their questions should enable them to triangulate it by looking at it in 1) absolute terms, 2) over time, and 3) relative to what&#39;s going on across the market, with customers or actions from competitors.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;3. Interpretation&lt;u>;&lt;/u>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Based on the original scenario, combined with what they learned, ask, “What is the essential decision that is needed?” or “How has their understanding of the situation shifted?”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Interviewer evaluation:&lt;/strong>; Are they able to start to formulate the narrative? You are assessing if their narrative is a summary or a synthesis: Summary = statement of the data; Synthesis is data + judgment. The critical thinker will demonstrate how they can consume and synthesize different pieces of information in parallel to arrive at a deeper understanding of the scenario or decision needed.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;4. Proceed&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;In this final step, ask, “What are the immediate next steps you would take?”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Interviewer evaluation:&lt;/strong>; If they start to ask questions about key stakeholders, shadow influencers, advocates, or swing voters who need to be convinced, the candidate is thinking critically. Do they seek to learn about headwinds and tailwinds to enable them to move forward? Note, this is not about solving the problem or assessing if they develop a recommendation, but simply how they approach problem-solving and decisions.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Using a flip interview, you can evaluate the candidate&#39;s logic and passion for the role based on their questions. Are the questions superfluous or consequential? Are the questions generic or specific? Do they ask not only factual or convergent but also divergent and evaluative questions? Does the candidate pivot, dive deep, and revisit a topic from different angles?&amp;nbsp;Are the questions grounded in the context of the problem and its environment? As they ask you questions, it will enable you to determine if they are actively listening by adjusting their questions in real-time, pivoting, and probing.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A skilled questioner creates a cooperative dialogue to elicit new learning through a series of questions. They engage the other person. Their questions should lead to inferences and connections and open up viewpoints that are not apparent. This exploration mindset encourages trial and iteration; unexpected learning may originate from the discussion.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Microsoft Changes the Interview Process&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;While not labeled as a flip interview, a candidate applied for a job at Microsoft in 1998 and found himself in one. During the interview, the recruiter asked him to “Sell me a toaster.” The candidate paused. Without missing a beat, the candidate asked several questions: “How many people are in the family?” “Are there young children in the house?” “What is the age range of toaster users in the family?” “Do they live in a small space, such as an apartment or a large house?” “Are they big breakfast eaters, or is their main meal dinner?” “How often do they eat out?” For three minutes, it was a stream of questions about demographics, psychographics, and physical space. The recruiter asked the candidate to stop and asked what this had to do with selling her a toaster. The candidate replied, “Everything.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is important to discover and understand the context of the “toaster environment” to ensure I sell you what you need. If I match the toaster features and functions to your needs, the success of the sales increases, and you will be a satisfied customer. Do you need a toaster oven, a pop-up 2-slide toaster, a 4-slice, a wide-slice toaster, a conveyor toaster, a commercial toaster, or a convection oven? Maybe a panini press would serve your needs best. The exercise was not about the toaster, the recruiter was looking to see how the candidate handled ambiguity. Was he a critical thinker? Did he dive right in with a sales pitch or pause, pivot, and learn? In case you are wondering, the candidate got the job.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Building a Curious Culture&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Great leaders build great cultures. Great cultures are built on curiosity.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Building a team with balanced curiosity is the path to winning. A team with varied backgrounds further amplifies the impact of the curiosity culture by bringing diverse knowledge sets into the problem solving, which can build upon each other. Embedding this critical competency at the outset, starting with the interview process, will quickly enable you to build a culture of creative thinkers. Individuals who thrive in the flip interview are continuous learners. They will seize this opportunity — as individuals and as a dynamic team — and run with it. They will demonstrate an innate curiosity and constantly ask “why?” or “so what?” and, importantly, “now what?”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Asking questions is how we are naturally wired. Eighteen months. That is the age, according to psychologists, at which children start to seek information. At about 36 months old, this fledgling curiosity translates into verbal questions. The questions can seem countless and random, darting from one topic to the next seemingly indiscriminately. Why does it rain? What is the moon made of? How do birds fly? Where did the dog go? When can we go to the park?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But this insatiable curiosity to learn by questioning often takes a pivot when a child starts grade school. Slowly, the focus of education shifts from asking questions to having answers. A new habit takes root as children are asked to raise their hands if they know the answer. This mindset — the expectation to deliver an answer rather than ask more questions — only deepens as young people continue their education journey.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;By the time we start working, it is instilled in us that we need to have answers. In the work environment, the value of questioning is frequently, largely, and wrongly overlooked. Answers are championed; solutions are expected; more questions are implicitly discouraged. Yes, results matter, but could those results have been more significant and achieved with less risk through a more intelligent allocation of resources or with a more creative strategy? Too often, we neglect the fact that top performers are the ones who ask questions and activate critical thinking that can expose weaknesses in a strategy or reveal an alternate path.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The path back to our young, inquisitive self is short. In fact, it depends on asking ourselves one question that links our professional and personal lives: How do we grow? This question underpins every project, every request, every meeting, and even where we choose to work and live. It is rarely asked as directly as this, but the answer to this underlying question is what shapes our careers and lives. We grow through questioning. Understanding this point creates the scaffolding that helps determine how to increase personal satisfaction or the company&#39;s market share, grow our customer base, help increase product usage, or drive renewals. If you seek growth, you need to stimulate critical thinking. For that, you need powerful questions. This is the basis for the flip interview model. While we are wired from a young age to ask questions, we are rarely taught to effectively develop the skill of questioning. Too often in business, we overlook the importance of questioning. We fail to appreciate questioning as an integral skill for doing our jobs. We don&#39;t invest enough time and energy in training ourselves and others to be effective inquisitors.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Successful candidates in the flip interview will demonstrate a critical thinking mindset. This is different from knowing analytic tools and methods. A critical thinking philosophy is a skill that almost every leader seeks, and many teams have in short supply. Thinking analytically includes being clear about the purpose of the essential question rather than wandering in the forest of data, being inquisitive not from a statistical perspective but questioning the initial face value, being able to connect the dots via synthesis, and eventually being able to tell an informed story that is based on deeper truths, judgment, and context, not just restating the initial facts.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;. 。 .&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Reactivity, insight, and ingenuity are needed for companies to thrive. You seek agile thinkers who can be growth champions, truth-tellers, customer stewards, and insight creators. The candidate who can conceptualize the problem, frame the situation, and ask more thoughtful questions will outperform those relying on textbook answers. Hiring talent capable of asking thoughtful questions is the key to building successful teams.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Finally, once you successfully recruit amazing people, you must create an environment where employees are motivated to work collectively yet feel valued and recognized for being curious and inquisitive. An entire organization with a growth mindset that embraces questions and curiosity can reframe challenges as opportunities and move more freely to adjust to business conditions.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 25 Sep 2023 20:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[What It Means to Be a Moral Leader]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/09/what-it-means-to-be-a-moral-leader]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;div js-target=&quot;video-player-page&quot; data-props=&quot;{&amp;quot;name&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;6337577423112&amp;quot;}&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>;&lt;/div>; &lt;div>;&lt;/div>; &lt;div>;&lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;span>;Loading... &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;script src=&quot;//players.brightcove.net/2071817190001/default_default/index.min.js&quot;>;&lt;/script>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;Dov Seidman makes people think, hard, not just about what they do but about how they do it. He&amp;#8217;s so focused on the &amp;#8220;how&amp;#8221; that he created the HOW Institute for Society, which encourages leaders to pursue a path of moral leadership. He even wrote a book called &lt;em>;How: Why How We Do Anything Means Everything&lt;/em>;. In this episode of our weekly live series &amp;#8220;The New World of Work,&amp;#8221; Seidman provides insights and inspiration about what good, moral leadership looks like these days &amp;#8212; in an era of perpetual disruption. His central message is that the old leadership approach no longer works. He challenged viewers to come up with even one command-and-control-style mayor or big-company CEO or professional coach who has enjoyed success in recent years. He has a point. Our expectations for what we require from our leaders &amp;#8211; with the glaring example, perhaps, of national political figures &amp;#8211; now include empathy, vulnerability, integrity, and morality. &lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/what-it-means-to-be-a-moral-leader?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/what-it-means-to-be-a-moral-leader?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;Remember when leaders could sidestep taking a stand on sensitive political or social issues by saying, “The business of business is business”? That aloof neutrality no longer cuts it, says Dov Seidman, founder and chairman of The HOW Institute for Society. “I think the business of business is society,” he says. “It&#39;s community, and how we relate to whatever comes our way and how thoughtfully and principled we are.” A leader standing up for what&#39;s right is the new expectation of employees, customers, and other stakeholders. Not to mention relatives at the Thanksgiving dinner table.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As AI ramps up and challenges humans&#39; monopoly on intelligence, purely human skills like moral judgment and empathy become even more crucial for leaders. While machines can be taught to do things right, Seidman says, only people can lead others to do the right things.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For this episode of our video series “The New World of Work”, HBR editor in chief Adi Ignatius sat down with Seidman, who&#39;s also the author of &lt;em>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/How-Why-Anything-Means-Everything/dp/1118106377&quot;>;How: Why How We Do Anything Means Everything&lt;/a>;&lt;/em>;, to discuss:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;How to let your principles guide you as a leader&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;The importance of taking a pause in order to reflect on, reconnect with, rethink, and reimagine your mission&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Which human traits and abilities will grow in value as AI grows in raw intelligence&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;“&lt;a href=&quot;/insight-center/the-new-world-of-work&quot;>;The New World of Work&lt;/a>;” explores how top-tier executives see the future and how their companies are trying to set themselves up for success.

Leadership is not about headlines. We can all read those, tweet to tweet, post to post.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It&#39;s about trendlines, where&#39;s the world going? What are the forces, familiar and unfamiliar, that are reshaping it? What framework are we going to use to pass judgment on the future? And what playbook are we going to use to enlist people on a journey to that future?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I&#39;m also fond of saying that smooth seas have never created a great mariner, and the seas out there are not smooth. So if you&#39;re going to be a great leader, sailing the rough seas is part of it.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Leadership has always mattered, it&#39;s always been consequential. We&#39;re going to get into some examples of how leadership perhaps is more consequential than before, because it reverberates. But we&#39;re leading at a time where everything has been disrupted, including leadership and authority itself. What it means to be in charge of an organization, or a team, or of somebody else, is not what it used to be.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I&#39;d like to frame what I think is the greatest 21st century leadership challenge, and then we can talk about what kind of leadership responds to it. I think you and your viewers would agree that you cannot run a company, a team, a country without formal authority. People need to be in charge. I can&#39;t imagine a football team without a head coach, a school without a principal, a company without a CEO, or a country without a president or a prime minister.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But we all know that organizations of human beings really work, and societies, when individuals with moral authority occupy these positions of formal authority. And in the less transparent, more opaque world, we often conflated the two: “He must be a great man, or how did he get that high?” Or, “The board wouldn&#39;t put him there unless he was a great leader.” But now we&#39;re seeing that formal authority could be seized, you could win it in an election, somebody else could bestow it upon you, “I hereby appoint you vice president.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But moral authority is really a function of who you are, the values you embody, how you lead, how you make decisions, and how you relate to others. The challenge before us now in this era of disruption, we&#39;re seeing that formal authority has been disrupted.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Silicon Valley entrepreneurs, even with 20 to one super majority shares, are not hanging on to their jobs if they&#39;re not leading in an enlightened way, or even worse, there&#39;s some misconduct. We&#39;re seeing formal authority get toppled and disrupted in every sector of society.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The challenge is how do we nurture and develop a culture of moral leaders, who lead with moral authority? That&#39;s step one. And how do we ensure that they&#39;re the ones calling the shots, in charge in positions of formal authority?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I would add that the legacy of the pandemic, when it comes to leadership, is that it has revealed and illuminated all the ways that moral leadership matters. Not just at the very top, a school principal, a barista at a Starbucks, a store manager at every level of organizations and sector and dimension of society: leadership matters. Because especially in times of crisis, when people are naturally uncertain and scared, they turn to anybody who has some authority over them. What they expect from them is truth, some wisdom, some selflessness, and really putting the other first. They expect moral leadership, Adi.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;That&#39;s a great framing. You use the term “moral.” Often people who write for HBR, who are in our world, they tend to use terms like, “Good leadership.” Good leaders are empathetic, they&#39;re vulnerable, in addition to having the business savvy that you need, but you use the term “moral.” What do you mean by that and why that is your central framing?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;DOV SEIDMAN:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What I don&#39;t mean by it is moralizing, becoming moralistic, or becoming an expert on how to wrestle with moral dilemmas, or how to take a stand on a social, political, environmental, religious issue, even though it might include that.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Moral leadership is really about the how. How you lead, how you make decisions, is it cost-benefit analysis? Or is it guided by principles? Are you willing to do inconvenient, courageous, and difficult things because that&#39;s what principle or values require of you?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It&#39;s really about how you relate to others and have conversations. Is it one-way or two-way? It&#39;s how you end a meeting. Do you say, “We&#39;ve had a great conversation? Whose call is it? Oh, it&#39;s a marketing decision. Who&#39;s got the marketing budget?” That&#39;s framing it in terms of power, “Whose call is it?” What about asking, “What&#39;s the right call? What do we think is the fair call? What&#39;s the call that honors and is in fidelity to our values?”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There&#39;s a whole playbook that I&#39;d like to get into, but for now, let me just say, it&#39;s not about moralizing. It&#39;s really about the how. How you wield power, how you make decisions, how you behave, and really what you embody in terms of your own values.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;And maybe we can bring this into what HBR viewers are all struggling with. Adi, you&#39;ve written a lot in HBR about the behaviors and qualities that we need more of in order to succeed in the workplace. Why don&#39;t you name some, if I could put you on the spot? In order to win today, what are some of the behaviors that we want from our colleagues and teammates?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Well, trust.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;DOV SEIDMAN:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Trust. Okay, I&#39;m going to write these down. Trust.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I talked about before about things like empathy, vulnerability, commitment. We&#39;re not talking about individual contributors, we&#39;re talking about teams and companies, so a shared commitment, a sense of team. Feel free to add to those, those are a few.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;DOV SEIDMAN:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;And these are not nice-to-have, this is what you figured out is essential today?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yes.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;DOV SEIDMAN:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some things you didn&#39;t just say were efficiency and productivity and speed. You&#39;re calling for human qualities.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I think moral leaders are very much attuned to the distinction between shifting behavior and elevating behavior. Because leadership is about the how. How we get people to do things, how we generate energy in them, how we enlist them in journeys and missions worthy of their dedication and loyalty.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If I were to put a product on sale, I could get you to buy now and not later, or more not less. If we create a great political attack ad I could get you to vote left not right, or right not left. We know how to use carrots and sticks to shift or nudge behavior. If you give me enough carrots and sticks, I could get you to work faster, maybe have fewer sick days, work 10 hours and not eight.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But the behaviors that you asked for, Adi, no amount of carrots and sticks can get you because this is human beings acting and behaving in their most elevated way. Can you imagine saying to somebody, go in a room and don&#39;t come out or you&#39;ll be fired if you can&#39;t come out with empathy and the ability to engender trust in the other, or you find more courage in being vulnerable. There are no amount of carrots that can coerce people into these behaviors.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Let&#39;s try bonuses, and no amount of sticks. Let&#39;s try carrots. If you tripled everybody&#39;s salaries, Adi, would you get more empathy? Would you get more trust?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;You would not. Probably not.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;DOV SEIDMAN:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We might get the opposite. We find ourselves in a discontinuous moment in leadership where what we want in and out of people, no amount of carrots and sticks can get us.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I&#39;m not against sticks. There should be fireable offenses. But should the fear of being fired animate 2% or 98% of how things happen around this place? I&#39;m really for carrots too. I think we should pay our colleagues as much as possible and hopefully more than our competitors.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But what moral leaders understand is that certain behaviors cannot be coerced. They cannot be motivated, they can only be inspired. Moral leaders are inspirational leaders because trust, empathy, vulnerability, collaborating, honesty, courage, all these human elevated qualities that we aspire to see in those around us must and can only be inspired.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;More leaders understand the difference. We&#39;re seeing this play out in return to the office. More leaders know that if you were my subordinate, Adi, I could insist never lie to me, always tell me the truth, but I could never insist, always be loyal to me. Moral leaders know that certain things they can insist on and other things they have to inspire. And we&#39;re actually seeing this play out with who&#39;s insisting that people come back to the office and who&#39;s trying to inspire it.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Leadership paradigms do shift. And in the past it was command control, “I am the boss.” “I say, you do.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We&#39;re in an era now where we want the empathetic leader and the vulnerable leader. It&#39;s possible there&#39;ll be another turn of the wheel before long and there&#39;s another leadership paradigm.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Is there science, or are there metrics to show that this approach to leadership not only is right in some 30,000-foot moralistic definition, but also in terms of outcome and performance for an institution?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;DOV SEIDMAN:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Let&#39;s get into the science and metrics, but before we do that, here&#39;s what&#39;s not going to change. There&#39;s only two types of behaviors. There&#39;s what you can and can&#39;t do, and what you should and should not do. I believe that Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart said there&#39;s a difference between doing that which you have a right to do and that which is right to do.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We used to specify to people, here&#39;s what you can and can&#39;t do. And then we asked them to pursue goals and strategies mindful of what they can and can&#39;t do as fast and as ambitiously, and they had to outcompete on that basis. In that world, the few, a military general would say, take that hill. A CEO would say, “This is our strategy, these are our goals.” And in that world, everybody&#39;s job is to do the next thing right.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I think the way the world is working today, we want more and more people to not just do the next thing right, but to do the next right thing. I don&#39;t think that shift is ever going back from asking people to do the next thing right, to inspiring them to do the next right thing.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Computers could be programmed to do the next thing right. Only a human being can do the next right thing.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I think we are now in a normative environment, normative as in norms, what you should and should not do. And moral leaders get out of bed to foster normative cultures where people are “should-minded” and that is here to stay.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The reason there&#39;s such an obsession with culture is corporate culture was invented, all culture was invented, to transmit norms from one generation to another. Norms as in what we ought to do and should do. You don&#39;t need culture if you&#39;re just going to specify the rules and the policies and the procedures, but you need to be deliberate and intentional about scaling values, values-based cultures, if you&#39;re going to be normative.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I don&#39;t think this is a fad. I think the world has been reshaped in ways to put us in a normative environment. We&#39;re seeing that in society, in community, and in companies.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I think that&#39;s true. I think there&#39;s also a counterargument though, and maybe this is just high level political counter, but I feel like historians will look back at this era and define it perhaps as one of renewed autocracy, a move away from some of the ideals that you&#39;re talking about. Does that strike you as accurate?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;DOV SEIDMAN:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I said that leadership is about trendlines. Let&#39;s step back. Can you name an autocratic mayor succeeding in terms of how his or her city is being led? Can you think of an autocratic CEO running a Fortune 500 company? Can you think of a championship won in basketball, baseball, soccer, world cup soccer, name the sport in the last 10 years, run by command and control screaming, that top-down coach?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Autocracy is asserting itself or reasserting itself in national politics where a dictator still has his hands on the levers of the military and ability to engage in propaganda, etc. There&#39;s an epic battle between Putin&#39;s autocracy and Zelenskyy&#39;s moral leadership. But if you step back, I&#39;m seeing some wonderful trends towards moral leadership in so many other more local sectors and dimensions of our lives.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The reason I brought up sports is sports is about winning. It&#39;s about becoming a champion and it&#39;s incredible who&#39;s winning in sports. I mean, Steve Kerr with the Golden State Warriors had great talent, but so did his competitors. He had such a bad back one year that he missed 43 games. He wasn&#39;t even there to do the coaching and they did it through a trust-based culture.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Jill Ellis, when she was winning champions as coach of the American women in soccer, she knew the names of the dogs and cats of every one of her players. That&#39;s just a symbol of how personal her coaching began.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;You had &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/01/us-soccers-gregg-berhalter-on-rebuilding-trust-in-the-wake-of-controversy&quot;>;Gregg Berhalter on your show&lt;/a>;, and the US men&#39;s team has been incredibly successful in the last World Cup, and aiming to eclipse that in the next one. But if you listen to how the players talked about what they built there, it was an identity forged in unity. Even though they were a very young team, they tried to outcompete by out-behaving the competition through qualities of boldness and resilience, etc. I have more examples, but I am pretty positive about some large trends here.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When I asked if this is the era of autocracy, part of it is it seems that leadership, at a certain level, political leadership at least, no longer feels shame. I&#39;m old enough that I remembered Richard Nixon and Nixon was accused, was impeached, and clearly he felt shame, and at that point he decided to step down.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I&#39;m not sure today&#39;s political leaders feel shame. And if they don&#39;t feel that, then you open the door for untruths, rival truths, just no sense of responsibility, of morality. I worry about that. I worry that that has been a successful model for some political leaders and that it could inspire others to try to follow that.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;DOV SEIDMAN:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I think that&#39;s a very serious worry. When you mentioned President Nixon, when he said, “I&#39;m not a crook,” he didn&#39;t want us to think that he&#39;s a crook, and whether he was a crook or not, he was celebrating the norm, “Let&#39;s not be crooks.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I believe we are now living in an era of impunity where some people in power are not just misbehaving, they&#39;re doing it with impunity. And impunity takes out and erodes the norm. Not only are we getting the harm that people in high places are causing through their conduct or nefarious conduct, but you do it with impunity, say, “My words are perfect, I&#39;d do it again.” Or they make the rest of us feel that we are somehow losers for wanting to live up to high standards and norms of conduct. You erode the norms.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But that&#39;s an argument for why we need moral leaders, because moral leaders safeguard norms and they help create organizations and communities that are really there to be in fidelity to high norms.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Kanye West, right before his divorce with Adidas, said horrific things and hateful things online. Whether he meant it or not, we could debate, but he said them. But then he said one more thing: There&#39;s nothing Adidas can do to me. That&#39;s a statement of impunity. Adidas took a several billion [dollar] hit at the end of the day by fighting against that, by severing that relationship.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We&#39;re seeing this battle of not just misconduct, but misconduct with impunity and those standing up to it.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When I think of the moral leader, in some ways I think about somebody who leads by example, who just sort of does the right thing and you realize this person is trustworthy, is upright, is inspiring.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It&#39;s a new world now for leadership. We&#39;ve talked about this in previous shows where there is this inescapable imperative for leaders, for CEOs to respond to social and even political issues that lap up against their company, or sometimes are separate from it but employees and customers demand to know where the leader stands.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;By the way, if there isn&#39;t an overt statement, employees and customers will assume and fill the sentence for you. You might as well take a stand. This is tricky territory.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Is there a framework for how a leader manages this new world of perpetual social issues that they&#39;re asked to somehow declare on?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;DOV SEIDMAN:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I&#39;m going to date maybe you. In the movie &lt;em>;The Graduate&lt;/em>;, [a character says to] the Dustin Hoffman character, “The future is plastics.” You just used the word Adi, which is the future is frameworks. All human judgment is framework-dependent. The prevailing framework in business is cost-benefit analysis. Now we need to create and scale new frameworks that are normative.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The world is so interdependent where the hopes, dreams, plight of one person are showing up viscerally and visually on tiny screens in our hands. I mentioned Kanye West. After his divorce with Adidas, he showed up in the lobby of Sketchers, and before Sketchers knew it, they were involved in a social maelstrom of how to respond to his appearance there.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One thing I know for sure that the world has been reshaped in ways to fuse it. Social, environmental, political, human issues, what just happened with the Supreme Court with abortion or how to respond to the invasion of Ukraine: these issues that were once deemed tangential to the business agenda are now inescapably part of it.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Neutrality is over. There is an expectation to have a point of view, especially from employees and consumers and other stakeholders. We need a framework for that.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Pfizer has a great framework. Sally Susman has spoken about it publicly. Does it align with our purpose, given our values, what should our point of view be? How does it impact our constituents? What would be the price of our silence?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tom Wilson has done a great job at Allstate with his framework. There&#39;s a threshold question: “Is what&#39;s going on legal? But even if so, given our values, what should our point of view be? Then if not, let&#39;s continue to challenge these ideas.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I think taking a stand is now something where you don&#39;t just get to say, “Hey, I just run a business. The business of business is business.” I think the business of business is society, it&#39;s community, and how we relate to whatever comes our way, and how thoughtfully and principled we are is now the new expectation.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Thanksgiving dinner is coming in a few months and employees are going to sit there and run into their cousins that they haven&#39;t seen in a long time. At the end of the day, a CEO has to ask herself this question, “Are my colleagues going to be proud of Thanksgiving dinner to brag to their cousins about how their company handled this issue and that issue and this issue and that issue that is now part of their business agenda?” We have to pass that Thanksgiving dinner test.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I love that. I also love the future is in frameworks. I want to go to an audience question now, and this is from Srinivas in India. In an era now where artificial intelligence may be better at making decisions based on data than humans are, can we say that the time has come for conscience-based management or leadership?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;DOV SEIDMAN:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Five hundred years ago we had the scientific revolution, and that was a true revolution. Uber putting yellow taxi cabs in or out of business, LinkedIn maybe making it harder for recruiters, those are disruptions. True revolutions happen about every 500 years.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I think the technological revolution and the revolution that&#39;s being accelerated through AI is an every-500-year revolution. 500 years ago, we looked around and we wanted to be in charge of our surroundings and we said, “We&#39;re the smartest.” Descartes said, “I think, therefore I am.” It was 500 years of revenge of the nerds, and we called it the era of enlightenment and reason. We pretty much organized our affairs by being the smartest. It&#39;s incredible what we achieved: modern capitalism, we proliferated individual rights, biodiversity. It&#39;s incredible what was achieved in the last 500 years.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What&#39;s interesting about AI is it is challenging our monopoly on intelligence. We&#39;re no longer the smartest.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What&#39;s the one thing a machine will never have? A heart. I actually think the technological revolution is putting into stark relief and focus the imperative to scale that which comes from the heart. There&#39;s an adage of moral leadership that only that which comes from the heart enters the heart.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From an economic standpoint in the industrial age, we hired hands and we hired strong hands. Then we went into the knowledge or information economy and we hired heads and we favored knowledge and expertise and specialization. I think we&#39;re going into a more human age where the qualities that emanate from the heart, like the ones you mentioned, empathy and the ability to do the right thing in our capacity for ethics and morality and conscience is now something we&#39;re going to have to scale.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What worries me, Adi, is that when social networks were first launched, we had some utopian thinking, anything that connects the world is going to be great. We will have richer human experiences. Individuals will be empowered. In the first innings we saw pictures of dogs and cats and our acquaintances became close friends again.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But then we started to see that technology is a force for good and bad. Good things can happen and harmful things can happen, including democratic elections being hacked. We saw that we are not just organically divided, but the profit motive has been &amp;nbsp;behind division and people are now pitted against each other and we&#39;re being actively divided through technology.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Those in charge back then often said, “We&#39;re just technology. We&#39;re just a platform.” They proclaimed their moral neutrality. I think, Adi, more important than anything now, we cannot afford with ChatGPT and generative AI to say, “It&#39;s just technology.” We know that good and harmful things are going to happen.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some people are talking about the possible end of humanity. The need for Spider-Man ethics, that with great power comes responsibility, has never been more important. I think those who are purveying these new technologies have unprecedented power, and they&#39;re going to need to scale conscience and Spider-Man ethics.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We&#39;ve been talking mostly about morality and leadership at the highest level, that good leaders have it and people who are selecting good leaders should look for that. This is a question from Shabana from Islamabad in Pakistan. What role do you think leadership development can play in ensuring that individuals throughout an organization embody the same moral values?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;DOV SEIDMAN:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;That&#39;s a great question. Moral leadership, there&#39;s an opportunity to build capacities, not skills, but qualities and capacities. And I think organizations can do that. There are some practices we need to scale of moral leadership and I&#39;m happy to mention a few.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I want to start with the most counterintuitive practice and piece of advice. I think everybody on this gathering would agree that the world&#39;s accelerating, it&#39;s always on. We&#39;re being digitally assaulted. We all experience FOMO, fear of missing out. Fair enough, Adi?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So far so good.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;DOV SEIDMAN:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The faster the world gets, and the more that comes at us, the more we need to pause. The hallmark of moral leadership is the pause. [Ralph Waldo] Emerson said that, “In each pause, I hear the call,” because only when we pause can we even ask ourselves important questions that a moral leader would ask. “How would I feel like if I were treated this way?” “What&#39;s the consequences of doing it this way or that way?”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I like to talk about the four Rs, because in the pause, we can reflect on the challenge, the situation of the world in which we&#39;re operating. We can reconnect with our deeper sense of purpose and our values and conscience. We can rethink some of our assumptions of how we&#39;re operating, how we&#39;re making money, how we&#39;re making decisions. And only then can we reimagine a better solution, or a better path, or a better future. The hallmark of moral leadership is the pause.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Moral leaders also eschew philosophical mistakes. People think, “Oh, moral leaders must be about empowerment.” Well, that&#39;s true spiritually, but often empowerment, you know what happens? This is how a nonmoral leader might sound, “I push decisions to the front lines. I delegate authority.” And they think they&#39;re leading, and then five years later, everybody has all these rights, “I can spend $1,000 without asking my boss for permission.” “I can get on an airplane to a trade association meeting and spend money without asking for permission.” And you&#39;ve built a culture where everybody knows what rights they have. They&#39;re empowered in that way. But you haven&#39;t built a gym where they know the ethos. “What is the way here?”, where they know what is right.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;[Airbnb CEO] Brian Chesky recently came out against this form of empowerment, and said that he wants to be an orchestrator. Moral leaders don&#39;t just get out of the way and delegate. They show up, and they sit at the back of the room sometimes. They don&#39;t provide the answer. They ask the right questions. So there really are opportunities to be incisive and rigorous about what it is and what it&#39;s not.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;You&#39;ve identified the hallmarks of moral leadership. I&#39;m curious, as you look out at US companies, global companies, are many of them or most of them run by people you would consider moral leaders?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;DOV SEIDMAN:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Two things: I think what matters is not to look for beacons. I&#39;ve never seen a unicorn, but I&#39;ve seen a horse. I&#39;ve seen a horn. I&#39;ve seen white. I look for who&#39;s engendering trust by extending it. Who&#39;s creating such a high-trust environment where people feel that they can lean and take risks in order to innovate?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Most innovation programs fail because trust is so low that people won&#39;t take the risk in order to innovate. I look not for perfection, and I think what matters most, Adi, is not who&#39;s a beacon and an icon of moral leadership, but who is authentically and deliberately on the journey. Who&#39;s taking risk in that regard? Who&#39;s being courageous in that regard? It&#39;s not about perfection in that way.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;And maybe I should end with the following: linearity is over in this world. We&#39;re in an up-and-down world, and the leaders who frame the future as a journey really elevate others, because nothing elevates a human beings more than being on a journey of progress, where we go up and down, but we stick together.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Increasingly, I&#39;m seeing people have the confidence and the courage to frame that path ahead as a journey, develop an ethos for being on a journey together. I really think that nothing elevates somebody else more than framing the path ahead as a journey and creating an ethos where together, we can journey together, because to journey is to do something human.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;That&#39;s fantastic. Your words are inspiring.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;DOV SEIDMAN:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Can I say one last thing? Did you ever hear in business, “Hope is not a strategy?”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yeah.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;DOV SEIDMAN:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Through budgeting, planning, and control, we&#39;re going to superimpose the future, and that&#39;s kind of, “Hope is not a strategy.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yeah.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;DOV SEIDMAN:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Well, I&#39;m also here to say that without hope, there is no strategy. Moral leaders purvey hope, and they inspire hope in others by really helping them see possibility, helping them embrace the commonality in the other, so that we can do things together.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Moral leaders really fight against the non-adage that hope is not a strategy, because they know that without hope, there is no strategy, and they&#39;re prepared to paint a picture of a distant future, but with rigor to go that way.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I want to apologize for not answering your question before about metrics. I&#39;m just going to say the following. Metrics are moral choices. When we measure something, we&#39;re saying it matters. When we don&#39;t measure something, we say it doesn&#39;t matter. Moral leaders pause, and they pick the right metrics that move them on the journey, because they know that metrics don&#39;t come from on high. In and of themselves, they reflect our values.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Dov Seidman, thank you for being on “The New World of Work”.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;DOV SEIDMAN:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Adi, great to be with you.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 22 Sep 2023 23:55:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Web3 Could Change the Business Model of Creative Work]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/09/web3-could-change-the-business-model-of-creative-work]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/09/Sep23_22_skizzomat.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;Illustration by Skizzomat&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;Web3 &amp;#8212; the read-write-own web &amp;#8212; could offer a new model for creative work. By offering new tools to earn and own assets, build wealth, and wrestle back control from powerful platforms and intermediaries, it has the potential to simplify how creators fund their ventures and new ways to earn a living, not just on the first sale of a work of art but in &lt;a href=&quot;https://defillama.com/nfts/earnings&quot;>;perpetuity&lt;/a>; thanks to programmatic royalty streams paid via smart contracts, self-executing code that can move and store money. If Web1 and Web2 democratized access to information and made it easier to collaborate online, Web3 equips creators with a new toolkit to build real wealth from their work, on a globally level playing field.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/web3-could-change-the-business-model-of-creative-work?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/web3-could-change-the-business-model-of-creative-work?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;For most of the industrial age, technology has acted as a tailwind for creators, powering an age of mass culture that supported a professional class of working artists. However, more recently, the rise of &lt;em>;digital &lt;/em>;technology — specifically, the internet and AI — has become a source of economic dislocation.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Web1, the so-called “read web,” was a digital printing press that democratized access to information, but it also commoditized art and music and undermined creators&#39; rights as their IP got laundered in the web&#39;s swirling washing machine of content.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Web2, the “read-write web,” made it easier to publish content, share ideas and access a broader audience (ie, “write” to the internet) but it also confined creators to tightly run platforms they did not trust or control and where they lacked transparency into the economic impact of their work. Either that or risk the wilderness of the web where their creations could be copied without recourse. Digital artists had no easy way to monetize their creations and could not benefit when works were resold.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The platforms that control content distribution have grown richer and more powerful, with precious little of that windfall trickling down to creators. Consider the strikes of the Writers Guild of America (WGA) and the Screen Actors Guild–American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG–AFTRA). Streaming has already shortened television seasons, shrunk writers&#39; rooms, and eroded artists&#39; traditional residual revenues; and generative AI and 3D modeling give companies more tools for further minimizing their use of writers and actors.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;By contrast, &lt;a href=&quot;/2022/05/what-is-web3&quot;>;Web3&lt;/a>; — the read-write-own web — offers new tools to earn and own assets, build wealth, and wrestle back control from powerful platforms and intermediaries. Web3 could simplify how creators fund their ventures by crowdsourcing new titles directly from their fans. It could offer new ways to earn a living, not just on the first sale of a work of art but in &lt;a href=&quot;https://defillama.com/nfts/earnings&quot;>;perpetuity&lt;/a>; thanks to programmatic royalty streams paid via smart contracts, self-executing code that can move and store money. In other words, it might offer a new model for creative work.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;AI: Risk or Opportunity?&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Now, new technologies — namely, generative AI — pose new challenges for composers, screenwriters, visual artists, and other creative workers. It is too early to say whether AI will be all bad for all of them; it may expanding the ranks of professional artists or grow the market for culture and creating opportunities for humans to co-create or collaborate with AI on an equal footing. But it could also starkly devalue the work of copywriters, composers, and artists, and relegate these workers to supporting roles, such as polishing scripts or adding some depth of feeling to digitally rendered art. Cezanne said, “A work of art which did not begin in emotion is not art,” but plenty of studio executives &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/technology/disney-creates-task-force-explore-ai-cut-costs-sources-2023-08-08/&quot;>;see AI as a way to cut costs&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;By analyzing hundreds of thousands of scripts against their viewership patterns over time, AI will get better at mimicking the stickiest and most bingeworthy of screenwriters&#39; styles, characters, and plots, not just to extend the arcs of existing stories but to synthesize all-new series and recommend the optimal cast or mix of character types. Ditto on the virtual replication of actors, with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/indiana-jones-and-the-dial-of-destiny-de-aging-tech/&quot;>;tools like FaceSwap already in use&lt;/a>; to de-age stars like Harrison Ford for his latest portrayal of Indiana Jones. But such big names likely consent to such innovations on their own terms. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vox.com/money/2023/8/22/23840473/writers-strike-actors-wga-sag-workers-economy-impact&quot;>;As &lt;em>;Vox&lt;/em>; put it&lt;/a>;, “If people don&#39;t lock down control of their digital twins, then nothing else matters.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Oscar winning director Stephen Soderbergh &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/steven-soderbergh-streaming-data-transparency-1235551409/&quot;>;told the &lt;em>;Hollywood Reporter&lt;/em>;&lt;/a>; that, more than AI or visual effects, what keeps him up at night is the opacity of streaming data: He speculates that the studios are doing really well and don&#39;t want to share the wealth, or else really poorly and don&#39;t want their stocks to tank.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Artists hoped that the internet would help to disintermediate gatekeepers and middlemen, and change power dynamics in creative industries, but instead it added new intermediaries like streamers and platforms that distanced artists from their fans and obfuscated their economic impact. We need something different.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Culture Needs a New Business Model&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;If technology is upending the longstanding business model of creative industries, it&#39;s also offering opportunities to establish a new one that can work better for creative workers.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Web3 technologies can simplify how creators track the usage of their IP and to monetize it, ensuring they get paid promptly and fairly for their work. For instance, Web3 technologies could allow artists to grow and perhaps even thrive along with AI, rather than suffer at its expense. For example, smart contracts can create avenues for artists to be compensated when their work is used to train AI like a large language model.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Web3 adds an &lt;em>;economic layer&lt;/em>; and a &lt;em>;rights layer&lt;/em>; to the Internet stack, where users can not only track the provenance of information and intellectual property but also protect, manage, and monetize these digital assets themselves with transparency peer to peer. These innovations can also change how creative ventures are funded, removing industry gatekeepers and amplifying underrepresented voices. In the Philippines, independent game studios are selling NFTs of in-game assets to gamers directly to fund new titles, disintermediating big studios and traditional financial backers.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For Jules Urbach, CEO of cloud graphics company OTOY, Web3 is fit for this purpose. OTOY&#39;s flagship product, OctaneRender, is what&#39;s known as an “unbiased, spatially correct graphics processing unit (GPU) render engine,” which is the industry&#39;s way of describing powerful software that can render more lifelike images and video than what came before. Marvel Studios used OctaneRender in the opening of &lt;em>;Ant-Man and the Wasp&lt;/em>;, according to Urbach.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Using the cloud, OTOY is able to harness dozens — and sometimes hundreds — of GPUs at a time in its network to break down projects into smaller parts.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;By breaking up tasks, OTOY helps democratize the compute-intensive process of rendering, allowing artists to render in a couple of minutes what used to take hours on expensive hardware setups. Most important, anything created in the render network creates a hash on a blockchain, for the verifiable provenance essential to managing artists&#39; IP rights and moving digital goods from platform to platform. With such capabilities, artist guilds could create a set of smart contract templates for their members to use in managing such life-like renderings of themselves — their digital twins — and collect privatized data on industry usage that would give them bargaining power in future negotiations. The contracts could represent the artist guilds&#39; negotiated terms, plus whatever the individual artists or their agents have negotiated.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;From Hollywood to Everywhere&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;This technology also offers artists ways to flip the traditional top-down model where studios and streamers try to control everything from IP to distribution. Hollywood screenwriter Jessie Nickson-Lopez has brought some of modern TV&#39;s most indelible characters to life. As a founding member of the writing team on &lt;em>;Stranger Things&lt;/em>;, she developed the story line for the character Eleven. Recently, as cofounder of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mv3.io/&quot;>;Web3 startup MV3&lt;/a>;, she launched a collection of 6,500 non-fungible tokens (NFTs) of different characters, the building blocks for what will be a richly rendered narrative “universe,” originally created by Nickson-Lopez and her team. Set in the “dystopian cyberpunk society” of 2081, after the “climate has gone to hell,” MV3 focuses on “a ragtag group of idealistic” rebels struggling to “take power from the corporation that owns the city.” NFT owners will participate in the IP, have a say in their character&#39;s arc, and even co-create the story with the MV3 team. These different character assets could ultimately appear in film, TV, and other storytelling media. They could be playable characters in videogames or avatars in the metaverse.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Knowing that fans will support a project is key for firing up the Hollywood machine to spend $100 million or more on a film or TV show. Nickson-Lopez said, “So we reverse-engineered it, and I created the world of Eluna City and the characters that reside in it.” Though Nickson-Lopez architected this world and crafted story lines for main characters, MV3 will not decide the direction of the story. “For me, what&#39;s been most exciting is seeing how much creativity we&#39;re inspiring in people who have never created before but are consumers of dystopian worlds and of fiction. There&#39;s this hunger to play. Our fans are our community and our co-creators. Because they&#39;re invested in the world and in the characters, they&#39;re really excited to build it up with us.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;MV3 inverts the Hollywood model. “As my lawyers say, &#39;It&#39;s like you&#39;re ripping off pieces of value and just giving it to people.&#39; And we&#39;re like, &#39;Exactly! That&#39;s exactly what we&#39;re doing.&#39;” Recently, the founders handed control day-to-day control of the MV3 universe to the community.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;. 。 .&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Ultimately, projects like OctaneRender and MV3 will work because they engage their communities not only in the economic upside but also in the governance. Handing over control and economics to fans is antithetical to the Hollywood model, and Nickson-Lopez recognizes that. Engaging people in the creative process, for love of the experience and not just for money, is what clearly drives these creators and gives their projects purpose and meaning.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Technology tools and human capital are more distributed than ever. If Web1 and Web2 democratized access to information and made it easier to collaborate online, Web3 equips creators with a new toolkit to build real wealth from their work, on a globally level playing field. As the saying goes, the future is not to be predicted; it is to be achieved. For cultural industries and much else, Web3 can help us do it.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 22 Sep 2023 23:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[How Software Companies Can Avoid the Trap of Product-Led Growth]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/09/how-software-companies-can-avoid-the-trap-of-product-led-growth]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/09/Sep23_22_1603508378.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;designer491/Getty Images&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;Companies like Slack and Dropbox have pioneered the use of Product-Led Growth (PLG). They start by building a product that&amp;#8217;s indispensable for small teams, then count on low friction and customer advocates to expand throughout the organization. PLG works, at least at first. But it can create challenges for growing companies. The answer isn&amp;#8217;t to reject PLG. It&amp;#8217;s to embrace it &amp;#8212; but to plan ahead. Eventually, even the best PLG company will need an enterprise sales strategy which takes years to develop. Don&amp;#8217;t wait until product-led growth stalls to plan for a multi-pronged sales strategy.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/how-software-companies-can-avoid-the-trap-of-product-led-growth?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/how-software-companies-can-avoid-the-trap-of-product-led-growth?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;Enterprise tech companies usually grow by investing in a costly sales and marketing operation, suffering through long, expensive sales cycles. Eventually, if it works, their software is adopted “top down” throughout an enterprise. That approach is tried-and-true, but it&#39;s not the one that Dropbox or Slack followed. Over the last decade, those companies and many others have pioneered a disruptive new business model that is taking over the $250 billion software-as-a-service market. It&#39;s called Product-Led Growth (PLG).&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The PLG playbook is elegant in its simplicity: First, build a compelling product that is indispensable to end-users. Then, encourage widespread internal usage with zero friction and increasingly add value for those individual end-users. Finally, leverage internal champions and their case studies to approach corporate buyers in IT to purchase the product for company-wide use. One of us, Oliver, executed this strategy successfully as a sales leader at both Dropbox and Asana.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When it comes to building initial traction, the merits of the PLG model are clear. A recent Bain &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bain.com/insights/what-it-really-takes-to-develop-product-led-growth/&quot;>;study&lt;/a>; showed that PLG companies in the past few years had generally experienced higher revenue and market share growth compared to non-PLG companies.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, there is a catch. Companies that follow the PLG playbook risk getting stuck in what we call the PLG trap. Although the PLG approach yields rapid initial adoption and growth, scaling a PLG company is a different story. &lt;a href=&quot;https://tomtunguz.com/plg-less-profitable/&quot;>;A recent analysis&lt;/a>; showed that public companies that initially pursued a PLG model are actually 5–10% less profitable compared to their sales-led counterparts — implying that many PLG companies, despite initially benefiting from superior unit economics, actually lose efficiency as they scale.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For ambitious managers of software companies, the lesson is not to avoid taking a PLG approach. Instead, embrace PLG as an initial strategy, but commit to winning the enterprise over the long term. Plan ahead and you can avoid the PLG Trap.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Understanding the PLG Trap&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Eventually, scaling an enterprise tech company will require classic enterprise sales. But adding enterprise sales as part of a multi-pronged approach to growth isn&#39;t like flipping a switch. It takes years to craft and execute an enterprise product roadmap and go-to-market strategy. PLG companies that neglect this approach early on will, unfortunately, find themselves stuck once they&#39;ve tapped the pool of initial bottoms-up users. Very few companies have demonstrated an ability to escape the PLG Trap once they become stuck.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The PLG Trap creates a common and natural dilemma for SaaS executives and boards, for several reasons:&lt;/p>; &lt;ol>; &lt;li>;In building a great product that is appealing to end-users, companies optimize their product and support organizations for small teams.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;When expansion opportunities emerge, companies add the bare minimum feature set (such as additional security, reporting, and administrative features) to drive initial adoption from classic early adopter customers.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Success with these early adopters inspires the company to quickly scale up an outbound enterprise sales and marketing team to execute this top-down, sales-led motion.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;The company then realizes they&#39;re trapped in a chasm: the early adopters found the minimum feature set adequate, but the majority of the market does not. Meanwhile, the customer support team is not accustomed to servicing large enterprises and the marketing team has been targeting small end users, not senior IT executives. The PLG company is not truly “enterprise ready” on a product or organizational level. Sales stall.&lt;/li>; &lt;/ol>; &lt;p>;A PLG company makes each decision logically along the way — but each decision may be a step deeper into the PLG Trap. Many companies find themselves trapped around the Series C stage — about 200-400 employees — but the principles apply to larger, public companies as well. For example, Dropbox has seen steadily declining year-over-year revenue growth from 25% in 2018 to only 8% in 2023 due to a failure to make this transition. Seamlessly transitioning from a PLG to an enterprise company, by avoiding the PLG Trap, requires deliberate planning from an early stage.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Avoiding the PLG trap&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;To become fully enterprise-ready, a PLG company must simultaneously provide bottom-up value and be prepared to eventually deliver value at enterprise-scale. Here are three activities a PLG company must do to seamlessly evolve from a PLG-only to a PLG + enterprise company that can avoid the trap:&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Create communities of champions across multiple levels in the customer organization.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;The most successful PLG companies take inspiration from successful open-sourced companies and nurture community-building as a long-term, must-win, competitive advantage. Building an advocacy program becomes a core competency from an early stage, even before investing in monetization. It&#39;s important to note that PLG companies need to build multi-tiered community programs to appeal to multiple stakeholders, unlike sales-led companies that can primarily focus on developing executive champions. PLG companies must develop champions on the end-user, IT, and executive levels, with each level likely requiring a different approach to community building.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Build a go-to-market plan (GTM) that incorporates multiple sales motions.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Successful PLG companies may start with one GTM motion, but eventually they build multiple GTM motions to capture different types of customer opportunities. Unlike sales-led organizations, which are often segmented by customer size (ie, SMB vs. Enterprise), PLG companies are often segmented by selling motions.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The most popular motions PLG companies build include:&lt;/p>; &lt;ol>; &lt;li>;&lt;em>;self-service&lt;/em>;: an e-commerce experience that generates demand and captures end-users to land in organizations&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;em>;high-velocity sales&lt;/em>;: a data-driven sales motion that uses modern customer relationship management (CRM) tools, automated workflows, and analytical segmentation to identify and convert organizations with higher willingness to pay,&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;em>;expansion sales: &lt;/em>;a capability focusing on transitioning organizations with strong product usage to adopt the product company-wide, and&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;em>;outbound sales: &lt;/em>;an outbound motion targeting senior executives at prospects that may not have as much organic product adoption.&lt;/li>; &lt;/ol>; &lt;h3>;Deliver product value across multiple levels, including at enterprise scale.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;PLG companies often begin by providing value to end-users or small teams. The bottoms-up adoption fuels viral adoption of the product in organizations. As PLG companies scale, they must also deliver product value to centralized buying personas like IT and executives. To address IT, many PLG companies develop an enterprise version with greater administration and security capabilities. To appeal to executives, some PLG companies, like the database software company MongoDB, naturally deliver enterprise-scale value due to the nature of the product. Other PLG companies, especially those on the application layer, may need to build, acquire or package adjacent products that deliver value on an enterprise scale. HubSpot has done this very effectively, graduating from a lightweight and narrow blogging tool to a fulsome CRM useful for larger enterprises.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Case Study: MongoDB&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;The database software company, MongoDB is an example of a company that successfully avoided the PLG Trap, despite starting with a bottoms-up sales motion. (One of us, Jeff, is a partner at a venture capital firm that invested in MongoDB.) With over $1 billion in sales, the company has nearly 2,000 customers spending over $100,000 per year on its software. Yet the company&#39;s origins are as an open-source tool that end users could download for free.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Released in 2009, the company&#39;s initial product — an open source, document-based database tuned for the rise of Internet applications and the era of big data — attracted millions of downloads. As the company grew in popularity among large enterprise customers such as Goldman Sachs and Thermo, it built advanced security features and invested in dramatic scalability in order to earn its way into the enterprise. In parallel, MongoDB created an enterprise-ready sales force, marketing team, and customer success function.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Whereas in early 2015, the company had just over 100 customers with over $100,000 per year, by late 2023 that figure had grown 20x. At the same time as it re-engineered the organization to be enterprise-ready, with multiple sales motions, a flexible product configuration, and a large investment in fostering its end-user community. By building both an enterprise-ready organization and a community-driven organization, MongoDB has scaled smoothly beyond the PLG trap to become one of the largest software companies in the world. As of this writing, the product has been downloaded more than 265 million times.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;By planning ahead, PLG companies can make the necessary strategic decisions to build a team and product platform that is truly enterprise-ready. The PLG model is seductively simple. Winning software companies need to be willing to embrace complexity — expanding beyond the typical managerial advice to “do one thing and do it well” and instead succeed in chewing gum and walking at the same time.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 22 Sep 2023 22:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[5 Types of Stories Leaders Need to Tell]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/09/5-types-of-stories-leaders-need-to-tell]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/09/Sep23_22_1417699431.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;horstgerlach/Getty Images&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;Storytelling is an important leadership skill, and executives who want to succeed should master five types of narrative: Vision stories, which inspire a shared one; values stories that model the way; action stories that spark progress and change; teaching stories that transmit knowledge and skills to others; and trust stories that help people understand, connect with, and believe in you.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/5-types-of-stories-leaders-need-to-tell?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/5-types-of-stories-leaders-need-to-tell?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;The historian Doris Kearns Goodwin was once asked what questions she would put to Abraham Lincoln if given the chance. “I feel like a bad historian,” she answered, “but I&#39;d probably ask him to tell me a story.” As she herself has documented, the 16&lt;sup>;th&lt;/sup>; US president was not just a great political leader but also a masterful raconteur, who used stories to entertain, educate, and inspire.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Storytelling is an important leadership skill. As psychologists Gordon H. Bower and Michal C. Clark of Stanford first observed in 1969, we&#39;re 7 times more likely to remember a fact when it&#39;s wrapped in story. Telling stories can also help with all five of the effective leadership practices that Santa Clara University professors James M. Kouzes and Barry Z. Posner lay out in their book &lt;em>;The Leadership Challenge&lt;/em>;: 1) model the way, 2) inspire a shared vision, 3) challenge the process, 4) enable others to act, and 5) encourage the heart&lt;em>;.&lt;/em>; But it&#39;s important to learn which types of stories lead to which outcomes. Here&#39;s a primer.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Trust Story&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;As noted in The Moth book, &lt;em>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://themoth.org/how-to-tell-a-story&quot;>;How to Tell a Story&lt;/a>;, &lt;/em>;“When you choose to share your story, you share a piece of yourself.”&amp;nbsp;In so doing, you start to build trust and connect in new ways with your listeners. Trust stories humanize you as a leader and allow you to &lt;em>;encourage the heart&lt;/em>; of your team.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Thasunda Brown Duckett, president and CEO of TIAA, &lt;a href=&quot;https://luvvie.org/podcast/thasunda-brown-duckett/&quot;>;connects her memories&lt;/a>; of being the only Black girl on the soccer team not invited to a teammate&#39;s birthday party to often being the only woman and person of color in a meeting. When you demonstrate vulnerability by sharing a personal story, others will be inspired to reciprocate, creating a virtuous circle of trust.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Teaching Story&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Brené Brown defines a leader as “anyone who sees potential in people and has the courage to develop that potential.” Great leaders need to be great teachers. Stories allow you to simplify complex topics by providing easy-to-follow models for behavior and skills.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As chairman, president, and CEO of Lowe&#39;s, Marvin Ellison uses &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/2022/03/08/1085285796/lowes-marvin-ellison&quot;>;stories from his life to teach&lt;/a>; his team. Early in his career, when he worked at Target, a senior leader from corporate visited his store and asked employees for feedback. When no one spoke up, Ellison volunteered that a new system wasn&#39;t working as intended. In the end, the system was fixed and Ellison was recognized for speaking up. Now, he tells this story when visiting Lowe&#39;s locations as a way of &lt;em>;enabling others to act &lt;/em>;with candor and promoting a feedback-driven culture.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;While a trust story is built around you, a teaching story and the other three types can also be an indirect narrative — using someone else&#39;s story, a fictional one, or a parable to deliver your message. Just make sure your audience can identify and empathize with the protagonist so they want the same thing for themselves.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Action Story&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;A big part of a leader&#39;s job is to inspire action — and one of the best ways to do that is through an story that leaves the audience thinking, “If we do this (insert your desired action here), then we will get that (the desired result).”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Entrepreneurs can use action stories to launch new business ideas. Canva founder and CEO Melanie Perkins dreamed of making graphic design accessible. To do this, she needed to create a new story for investors. “People are scared of designing,” says &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/2021/02/26/971813519/canva-melanie-perkins-2019&quot;>;Perkins&lt;/a>;. “They&#39;re conditioned their whole lives to think that they&#39;re not creative.” Early success stories included people completing simple design challenges and creating resumes that helped them land jobs.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Action stories can also be used to inspire organizational change. Former CEO Indra Nooyi used story to &lt;em>;challenge the process &lt;/em>;at PepsiCo, shifting a product portfolio that was primarily sugar-based to something more health conscious. She wanted to maintain the sense of fun but ensure that it was also good for you. “Words that speak to people&#39;s hearts are more important than speaking to their minds,” &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ted.com/podcasts/worklife/taken-for-granted-indra-nooyi-says-its-time-for-leaders-to-care-part-2-transcript&quot;>;Nooyi shares&lt;/a>;. She developed an indirect narrative to get buy-in from her board, using story to illustrate emerging trends of evolving consumer tastes.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Values Story&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;If you want your team to buy into your organizational values, tell a story that shows someone living into them as a means of &lt;em>;modeling the way&lt;/em>; for them to do so as well.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, to model the family-first mindset at Zoom, founder and CEO Eric Yuan often &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/insights/eric-yuan-keeping-customers-employees-happy&quot;>;tells a story&lt;/a>; about being late to the company Christmas party because he was traveling with his son&#39;s basketball team. Chobani&#39;s CEO and founder Hamdi Ulukaya frequently &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ted.com/podcasts/rethinking-with-adam-grant/anti-ceo-playbook-with-chobani-founder-hamdi-ulukaya-transcript&quot;>;shares tales&lt;/a>; of growing up amid corruption in Turkey and explains how it made him want to become a more ethical business leader. These stories communicate personal and organizational values and encourage values-driven behavior in others.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Vision Story&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;History is full of examples of leaders using vision stories. Following the evacuation at Dunkirk, Winston Churchill vividly described a Britain that would “fight on the seas and oceans” and “never surrender.” In his iconic “I Have a Dream” speech, Martin Luther King, Jr. used story to paint a picture of a world in which “man would not be judged by the color of his skin but the content of his character.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In business, GM CEO Mary Barra &lt;a href=&quot;/podcast/2021/05/ceo-series-mary-barra-of-general-motors-on-committing-to-an-eco-friendly-future&quot;>;uses story&lt;/a>; to illustrate a future with “zero crashes, zero emissions, and zero congestion.” In taking the reins as the first non-founder CEO at Microsoft, Satya Nadella needed to shift the culture internally from being “know-it-alls” to “learn-it-alls.” To promote the “learn-it-all” mindset, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ted.com/podcasts/satya-nadella-is-building-the-future-transcript&quot;>;Nadella shared a story about his dad&lt;/a>;. “He had this diary he would write in every day — people met, ideas generated to act on. It&#39;s a continuous system.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Stories make the unseen future feel vivid and real, &lt;em>;inspiring a shared vision&lt;/em>; that listeners will commit to and make progress toward.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As Kouzes and Posner&#39;s title implies, leadership is a challenge. But story can help with all five practices of effective leadership. Vision stories inspire a shared one. Values stories model the way. Action stories can spark change and, in turn, challenge the process. Teaching stories transmit knowledge and skills to others, enabling them to act. And when you share your own story you build trust and encourage the heart.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 22 Sep 2023 21:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[How the Food Industry Is Using Cross-Training to Boost Service]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/09/how-the-food-industry-is-using-cross-training-to-boost-service]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/09/Sep23_22_1137557948.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;HBR Staff; Mesut Ugurlu/Getty Images; Unsplash&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;Cross-training employees on a variety of tasks can be a powerful tool for improving operations, as well as for attracting and retaining workers. When employees are cross-trained to perform a variety of both customer-facing and non-customer-facing tasks, they can adjust their work depending on demand and business needs. Of course, that&amp;#8217;s good for the business, but it also makes the job better for workers. For one thing, when employees are more productive and contribute more, companies can pay them more. Cross-training helps employees build capabilities that they can leverage in their career growth. It also enables more stable schedules. This article shows how several small food companies were able to use cross-training to improve service and job quality. Any industry can learn from these approaches to improve operations, customer experience, and employee experience.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/how-the-food-industry-is-using-cross-training-to-boost-service?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/how-the-food-industry-is-using-cross-training-to-boost-service?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;People are dining out again, but restaurants aren&#39;t always &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/30/dining/restaurant-prices-service.html?utm_source=Sailthru&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Issue:%202023-05-30%20Restaurant%20Dive%20%5Bissue:50879%5D&amp;amp;utm_term=Restaurant%20Dive&quot;>;able to serve them well&lt;/a>;. Like many other service businesses, they face two operational challenges: attracting and retaining enough workers, and coping with highly &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/chain-restaurant-local-restaurant-closing-11673616374&quot;>;variable demand&lt;/a>;. One lever for improving on both counts is cross-training — that is, training employees for a variety of tasks.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Cross-training is a powerful tool, but it is far from a new idea: One of us (Zeynep) first observed cross-training as part of a &lt;a href=&quot;/2017/11/the-case-for-good-jobs&quot;>;“good jobs system”&lt;/a>; that enabled low-cost retailers like Costco and Trader Joe&#39;s to pay more than their competitors while driving better value for customers. Beyond the service industry, manufacturers like Toyota have &lt;a href=&quot;/1999/09/decoding-the-dna-of-the-toyota-production-system&quot;>;long practiced&lt;/a>; cross-training to improve motivation and involve the frontlines in continuous improvement. And in their landmark &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0030507376900167&quot;>;1976 study&lt;/a>;, J. Richard Hackman and Greg R. Oldham identified task variety as a driver of employee motivation across a variety of industries.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When employees are cross-trained to perform a variety of both customer-facing and non-customer-facing tasks, they can adjust their work depending on demand and business needs. Of course, that&#39;s good for the business, but it also makes the job a &lt;em>;better&lt;/em>; job for workers. For one thing, when employees are more productive and contribute more, companies can pay them more; higher productivity is what enables a typical Costco worker to earn &lt;a href=&quot;https://s201.q4cdn.com/287523651/files/doc_events/2023/Jan/19/costco-annual-shareholders&#39;-meeting-slide-deck-jan2023.pdf&quot;>;almost $10 an hour&lt;/a>; more than a typical retail worker. Cross-training helps employees build capabilities that they can leverage in their career growth and career paths. Cross-training also enables more stable schedules; instead of changing the number of workers throughout the day or week, companies can keep more consistent teams and just change &lt;em>;what&lt;/em>; they do, instead of changing &lt;em>;who&lt;/em>; is scheduled to work.&lt;/p>; &lt;article-promo>; &lt;hbr-component type=&quot;promo&quot; is-insight=&quot;insight-center&quot; title=&quot;The New Age of Operations&quot; dek=&quot;Improving efficiency and increasing resilience.&quot; cta-text=&quot;&quot; href=&quot;/insight-center/the-new-age-of-operations&quot;>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/insight-center/the-new-age-of-operations&quot; style=&quot;color:black;text-decoration:none&quot;>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; Insight Center Collection &lt;/div>; &lt;h3>;The New Age of Operations&lt;/h3>; &lt;div>; Improving efficiency and increasing resilience. &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hbr-component>; &lt;/article-promo>; &lt;p>;But these benefits should be balanced with a possible downside: a lack of specialization and ownership. At the Good Jobs Institute, our work with a variety of small food businesses has shown us how they can make the best use of cross-training to improve service and job quality. Any industry can learn from these approaches to design flexibility into their job design and operations.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Approaches to Cross-Training at Three Small Food Businesses&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Employees don&#39;t have to be cross-trained to do everything, but a little bit of cross-training can go a long way. Three small food businesses we&#39;ve worked with have each found their own way to balance flexibility with specialization and ownership:&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Counter service&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;At two franchised locations of the Moe&#39;s Original BBQ chain, there was a strict boundary between front-of-house and kitchen teams, making it difficult to adjust to demand peaks. Owner Dewey Hasbrouck introduced cross-training between the two specialized teams so that they could cover each other on typical bottleneck tasks. For instance, when there were long lines at the counter, kitchen staff could now step in to answer the phones, bring food out to tables, and bag to-go orders. If it was the kitchen that was backlogged, the front-of-house team could fill sauce cups, restock the line, and prepare basic sides.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Bakery&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;At She Wolf Bakery, the production team baked bread in the bakery and the sales team sold it at New York City Greenmarkets, seldom interacting. The teams were often busy at different times: the production team would be overwhelmed preparing bread on Fridays, while the sales team was busiest on Saturdays.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Head of operations Kim Vallejo realized there was an opportunity to better integrate the two teams. While bakers were already being trained on some of the packing duties, She Wolf also started offering a four-hour paid bakery orientation for new sales team members, during which they could take part in the bread-making process. They learned basic bakery side work like running the dish pit and oiling pans, which were very helpful to bakers during a rush, and the two teams also got to know each other better, which made them more motivated to help each other out.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Full service&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Tacombi, a Mexican restaurant chain with locations in New York City, introduced cross-training while navigating the city&#39;s strict tipping regulations, which don&#39;t allow employees in non-tipped roles to perform customer-facing tasks. The staff in their full-service concepts included many highly specialized roles, such as hosts, runners, bussers, and servers in the front, and dishwashers, prep cooks, quality control leaders (who manage the kitchen flow and check quality), and chefs in the back.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Operations leader Jose De La Campa noticed that scheduling these specialists was very complex and created service issues when someone called out sick. The work wasn&#39;t evenly distributed over time; at any given moment, the prep cooks might have nothing to do while the dish washers were swamped. But they were neither trained nor expected to help each other. De La Campa decided to reduce the number of specialist job codes; for example, in most restaurants, he combined the responsibilities of prep cooks and dishwashers, combined the roles of head chef and quality control leader, and removed the host role, redistributing that work to the other front-of-house positions, such as servers.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;The Impact of Cross-Training on Performance and Jobs&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;When employees can contribute to different parts of the business, it can improve service, increase production capacity, and make jobs better for the people doing them.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Better service&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;At She Wolf, cross-training helped teams take more ownership to keep production running when faced with the unexpected variability of call outs, so they could always be there for their customers with quality bread. According to Vallejo, “If we are in the weeds and down three people and it&#39;s a Friday and all hands on deck, my delivery driver knows how to run the dish pit and they can jump back there and help us get ahead.” Training market team members on basic prep tasks also freed up bakers&#39; time to focus on higher-value tasks, ensuring bread quality didn&#39;t suffer due to unexpected variability.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When Tacombi relied on highly specialized roles, an absent dishwasher could paralyze operations. With fewer specialist roles and appropriate cross-training, an unexpected sick day could more easily be absorbed by the rest of the team. De La Campa also said that it improved the food and service: The head chef now had more ownership over quality control, motivating them to identify issues and provide proper feedback to the rest of the team.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Higher production capacity&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;At Moe&#39;s Original BBQ, because team members could flex into different customer-facing and non-customer-facing tasks, they had enough slack to deal with demand peaks. This translated to higher-quality food and service. More significantly, the cross-trained team had the expertise to take on more catering orders. Catering sales increased by 60% in the first year, without Moe&#39;s having to significantly change its staffing levels.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Better jobs&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;All three businesses ended up raising pay. Their cross-trained employees were more productive and could contribute to more areas of the operation, making higher pay a good investment. Cross-training created a new talent pipeline for She Wolf: By allowing the market staff to get production experience, management could identify potential new bakers and help them make the transition onto the bakery team when they needed to hire. For those employees, this meant career growth and higher wages. Cross-training also helped these businesses give their people better — that is, more regular — schedules, since staffing didn&#39;t necessarily have to lurch up and down with the number of customers.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Cross-training helped make the work more meaningful. At Moe&#39;s Original BBQ, cross-training contributed to better communication and a sense of belonging: The staff started insisting that they be referred to as “one team,” not “front-of-house” and “back-of-house.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The combination of higher pay, better schedules, and better work helped Moe&#39;s Original BBQ reduce employee turnover by 30%, which then helped them improve their performance even more.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Why Cross-Training Isn&#39;t More Common&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Many company leaders like the idea of cross-training, but aren&#39;t convinced it will work for them. Some think their employees can&#39;t handle — or aren&#39;t motivated to learn — a variety of roles.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One genuine risk is that introducing cross-training &lt;em>;in isolation&lt;/em>; could create operational problems; if employees are already overloaded or have low tenure, or if the company can&#39;t set and enforce high expectations, introducing cross-training might lead to more errors and frustration. The key is creating &lt;em>;a system that enables cross-training. &lt;/em>;At the small food businesses, this involved some complementary choices:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;Simplifying operations to remove non-value-add work so that employees only spend their time learning tasks that improve the customer experience.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Simplifying operations to reduce &lt;a href=&quot;/2022/03/give-service-workers-stable-schedules&quot;>;self-inflicted variability&lt;/a>;&amp;nbsp;— that is, to smooth the workload and make the peaks more manageable.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Setting clear standards to ensure that employees can be consistent in different roles.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Empowering employees to use their judgment to decide which tasks to do when.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Staffing with slack so that people have enough time to learn new tasks.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Investing in people to attract and retain great staff and hold teams accountable to high expectations.&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;Moe&#39;s Original BBQ had been trying to introduce cross-training for several years, but because of high turnover, it was a struggle just to get employees through basic training. So, in addition to cross-training, owner Hasbrouck made other operational changes to set his team up for success, such as simplifying the menu and smoothing the workload by moving specials from weekends to weekdays. He also made significant investments in his people, increasing full-time pay from $15 an hour to $20 an hour in Maine, plus tips. Higher pay came, however, with higher expectations: Hasbrouck changed the job description to state, “We want employees capable of doing it all.” Adding cross-training made the job worth more to the business and the higher pay made the additional responsibility and higher expectations worth it for employees.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;. 。 .&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Changes like these don&#39;t happen overnight, but a better system can drive operational excellence and let teams live up to their potential. Food businesses and other service industries are facing headwinds, but cross-training can ensure that they are up for the challenge, providing better service while also improving the lives of their employees and preserving vibrant businesses in their communities.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 22 Sep 2023 20:25:03 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
