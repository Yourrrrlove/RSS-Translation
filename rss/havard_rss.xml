&lt;span>;MirageC/Getty Images&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span >;摘要。&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;Covid-19 为传统的分层指挥控制运营管理敲响了丧钟。取而代之的是一种新的模式，它能够更好地应对当今破坏性、不稳定和不可预测的环境。在这个模型中，决策责任广泛分散到最有意义的地方，从而可以根据不断变化的条件做出更快、更准确的决策。该模型建立在四个支柱之上——信任、人才、透明度和技术。瑞士跨国食品和饮料加工集团雀巢公司是一家公司在其工厂中采用这一理念的例子，并因此建立了弹性运营模式，帮助公司有效应对不利事件和挑战。&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div >; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/its-time-for-a-new-model-for-operations-management?language=es&quot;>;阅读西班牙语&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/its-time-for-a-new-model-for-operations-management?language=pt&quot;>;葡萄牙语&lt;/a>; &lt;/div >; &lt;p>;在相对稳定和可预测的时代统治了数十年的传统指挥与控制运营管理模式是否最终消亡了？我们看到的所有迹象都表明确实如此。在供需难以预测的后疫情时代，企业无法再整合高层决策。这样做与他们在快速而长期的破坏和波动的世界中所需的敏捷性、灵活性和速度背道而驰。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;虽然多年来它一直在慢慢侵蚀，但我们看到了命令和控制模型在新冠疫情期间的最终解体。在大流行造成的混乱和波动中，企业被迫放松决策控制。如果他们想生存，他们就必须这么做。当基本商品在没有任何警告的情况下突然被抢购一空，而关键原材料和零部件的供应迅速枯竭时，运营经理根本没有时间收集数据、分析数据，然后告诉运营团队如何应对。公司只需利用他们所掌握的最佳信息采取行动，而做出这些决策的合适人选就是那些最接近行动的人。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这些转变预示着一种新的运营管理模式的出现，在这种模式中，目标是通过将决策分散到组织中最有意义的点来优化运营对威胁和机遇做出响应的准确和快速程度。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;例如，战略决策跨职能或跨企业的影响和长期影响——例如分配资本、搬迁工厂、重新设计产品或进入新市场——最好由那些能够关注大局和更广阔视野的人来实现。更多战术决策的责任——在采购、物流、制造和分销方面——被转移到组织的其他地方，直到最符合逻辑的点——即“橡胶与道路相遇的地方。”&lt;/p>; &lt;article-promo>; &lt;hbr -component type=&quot;promo&quot; is-insight=&quot;insight-center&quot; title=&quot;运营新时代&quot; dek=&quot;提高效率并增强弹性。&quot; cta-text=&quot;&quot; href=&quot;/insight-center/the-new-age-of-operations&quot;>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/insight-center/the-new-age-of-operations&quot; style= &quot;color:black;text-decoration:none&quot;>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; 洞察中心集合 &lt;/div>; &lt;h3>;运营新时代&lt;/h3>; &lt;div>; 提高效率并增强弹性。 &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hbr-component>; &lt;/article-promo>; &lt;p>;社会和政府组织称之为&lt;em>;辅助性&lt;/em>;，这就是原则社会和政治问题应在符合其解决方案的最直接或地方层面上得到处理。在运营中，这意味着，例如，最接近原材料分配作为投入的地方、产品制造的地方以及成品从工厂运往配送中心的地方——做出最佳决策所需的最准确和相关信息所在的地方。以这种方式分散运营决策是公司快速、适当地应对业务环境中的干扰和变化的能力的关键。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;对于大多数公司（无论大小）来说，这是一个深刻的转变。习惯于控制的运营领导者必须停止尝试微观管理和交火。他们需要放松控制，并授权其他人在情况发生变化时偏离现有计划或目标。过去向老板寻求指示和指导的经营者必须习惯于对公司发生的事情承担更大的责任和责任。由于中断来得如此之快，我们没有时间升级问题来获取如何应对这些问题的指导。与此同时，运营商需要明确自己可以做出哪些决策，以及应该何时何地寻求支持。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;推动转变的关键推动因素&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2 >; &lt;p>;要使这个模型发挥作用，需要四个重要的推动因素。所有这些都必须到位，以便领导者和运营商都能接受他们的新角色并以最高水平执行。缺少其中任何一个都将导致无法成功过渡。&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;1.信任&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;信任是该模型的基石。领导者必须相信他们所委托的决策者有能力并且将会为公司做出最好的决策。同时，运营商必须了解哪些问题需要升级以及如何升级。他们还必须相信，当遇到麻烦时，当信号告诉他们这是正确的事情时，他们不会因为做出改变计划的大胆决定而陷入困境。&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;2 。人才&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;仅仅给予人们做出决策和行动的自由是不够的。为了让人们能够轻松地做出决策，他们需要以前可能不需要（或不具备）的技能和能力。其中包括分析思维、当代市场情报、数字和数据专业知识、逻辑和推理、人际沟通等软技能，以及令人信服地捍卫自己决策的能力。因此，强有力的教育和学习努力必须伴随着决策授权。&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;3.透明度&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;领导者需要获取信息来了解其组织及其员工正在发生的事情，而运营商则需要所有相关数据来了解其决策和行动的影响。在这两种情况下，明确与公司期望的具体结果相关的正确指标至关重要。&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;4。技术&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;技术提供透明度——它使公司能够收集和传播领导者和操作员做好工作所需的信息。此外，强大的人工智能工具可以为各级决策者提供见解，充当教练或副驾驶，并且在某些情况下，在人类的监督下自行做出某些决策。而且，在学习环境中，技术对于帮助人们培养成功履行新职责所需的新技能和能力至关重要。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;雀巢&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;é&lt;/ strong>;&lt;strong>;以操作员为中心的组织的经验&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;信任、人才、透明度和技术是雀巢所谓的“以操作员为中心的组织”的核心，重点关注三件事：&lt;em>;授权&lt;/em>;（给予人们做出决定和行动的自由）； &lt;em>;参与&lt;/em>;（提供做出正确决策和查看结果所需的工具、数据和信息）；和&lt;em>;赋能&lt;/em>;（提供技能和能力建设，以便人们能够适当地利用他们获得的信息做出正确的决策）。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在 60 家雀巢工厂中，操作员拥有 iPad，通过 iPad他们可以扫描设备上的代码并查看与其相关的所有数据，包括安全功能和性能。他们还可以通过 iPad 控制设备的某些元件。这让操作员真正拥有自己设备的感觉，就像汽车上的仪表板让驾驶员有一种掌控车辆的感觉一样。雀巢还使用相同的设备来提供技能培养，使操作员能够获得持续增强能力所需的培训和信息。雀巢计划在其全球 350 家工厂中部署这种方法。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;通过以操作员为中心的组织模式，雀巢有效地创建了“&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdi-ama.biz/about” /&quot;>;任务导向的工作团队&lt;/a>;，这是国际竞争动力公司提出的概念。这些并不是真正独立的团队，而是了解决策边界的团队。例如，操作员意识到他们自己可以做出的决定以及何时需要将某些内容提交给直线经理或团队领导的限制。工厂经理知道何时何地需要联系特定地区所有工厂负责人的技术经理。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;为了让雀巢以操作员为中心的模式发挥作用，每个人都必须接受相同的文化和工厂内的价值观。当然，每个工厂所在国家或地区的社会和情感文化可能有所不同，因为雀巢在世界各地都有工厂。但对于公司员工来说，重要的是要了解，当他们进入工厂时，每个工厂都存在相同的商业文化和价值观——无论是在南非、马来西亚还是瑞士。通过这种方式，该工厂仍然受益于雀巢透明和诚实的价值观，而不强迫员工做与他们日常生活中正常行为不一致的事情。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Building Next -新世界的一代运营管理&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;公司运营的环境已经发生了明显的变化，这为命令与控制运营管理的棺材敲下了最后的钉子。由于公司不仅需要更快地做出反应，而且需要更快地进行预测，因此是时候建立一种基于信任、人才、透明度和技术的新运营模式了，该模式可以使他们能够加快决策速度，更有效地应对干扰和影响。不可预见的事件，并随着周围世界的发展，通过有机调整和重塑自身来继续再生。&lt;/p>;

&lt;/div>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot; font-weight: 400;&quot;>;您对经理的经理有多了解？在没有老板在场的情况下，你和他们一起度过了多少时间？如果您像我共事的大多数专业人士一样，那么这两个问题的答案可能都是“很少”。然而，向上管理并不仅仅限于影响你的顶头上司。它还要求您与指挥链上层的领导者建立关系，包括与您的“大经理”或“大老板”。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400; &quot;>;与上级建立联系的最有效方法之一是通过越级会议。简而言之，越级会议是您和老板的老板之间的一对一会议。这是一个与您可能没有经常接触或互动的上级直接沟通的机会。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;

”>;。随着职责范围和行动的影响变得更加广泛，跨级不仅可以确保您有效地履行自己的职责，而且可以保持一致、知情且日益引人注目。那是因为它们允许您：&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot; aria-level=&quot;1&quot;>;&lt;b>;获得更广阔的视角。&lt;/b>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;直接与经理的经理互动有助于您与公司更广泛的战略方向和宣传保持一致与高层重视的项目和举措产生共鸣。&lt;/span>;&lt;/li>; &lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot; aria-level=&quot;1&quot;>;&lt;b>;建立社会资本。 &lt;/b>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;与老板的老板建立融洽的关系奠定了信任的基础，在变化、过渡和不确定的时期，信任的价值是无价的。&lt;/span>; &lt;/li>; &lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot; aria-level=&quot;1&quot;>;&lt;b>;加强宣传。 &lt;/b>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;这些会议提供了一个展示成就的平台，&lt;/span>;&lt;a href=&quot;/2023/08/making-the-case-for-the- resources-your-team-needs&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;请求您团队所需的资源&lt;/span>;&lt;/a>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;,并为自己的进一步成长做好准备。&lt;/span>;&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;以下是如何设置、持有和利用向上跳跃-为了您自己以及整个组织的利益进行级别对话。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;b>;考虑您的文化。&lt;/b>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot; >;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;对于我指导的许多专业人士来说，仅仅想到与他们的越级经理直接互动就可能是彻头彻尾的想法令人生畏的。 &lt;/span>;&lt;a href=&quot;/2021/05/stop-being-so-hard-on-yourself&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;自我怀疑蔓延&lt;/span>;&lt; /a>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>; 他们担心浪费高级领导的时间或被认为“太努力了”。这些担忧都是有道理的。处理与经理的经理的关系需要微妙的平衡。越界，你可能会被视为绕过了你的直接主管。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;所以请小心行事。在您安排越级之前，请考虑您的工作场所文化以及人们如何看待此类请求。它会受到欢迎——还是被视为威胁？一些公司鼓励开放式沟通，而另一些公司可能有更多的等级结构。反思过去的互动和&lt;/span>;&lt;a href=&quot;/2023/07/overcoming-your-fear-of-giving-tough-feedback&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;反馈&lt;/ span>;&lt;/a>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>; 来自您的主管。他们之前是否鼓励您采取主动，或者是否建议您采取更加谨慎的做法？这可以深入了解他们如何看待您的请求。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;b>;让您的老板参与进来。&lt;/b>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400; &quot;>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;如果您确实继续，透明度是关键。选择一个您和您的直接主管可以进行坦诚对话的私人时间。解释为什么您认为越级会议对您和整个团队都有好处。也许可以分享它将如何帮助您做出明智的决策，减少来回的次数，或避免最后一刻出现意外而占用宝贵的时间和资源。强调你的目的不是要削弱或绕过你的经理，而是要增强你自己的理解以及与组织的一致性。您的老板会很高兴了解您请求背后的动机。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;向您的老板提出诸如“您建议我如何最大限度地利用时间？”之类的问题。 ”或“您认为有哪些具体主题适合我介绍？”表明您尊重他们的专业知识，并将该请求视为一项协作努力。如果你的老板表示保留或建议等待更合适的时机，请倾听。他们可能对职场政治有你不知道的见解。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;b>;定义你的目标。&lt;/b>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;高管们很忙，你最不想做的就是毫无准备地不尊重越级的时间。因此，请提前定义您的目标。澄清期望？列出你目前的理解并请求肯定或更正。寻求指导？概述您面临的具体挑战或机遇、您倾向于的解决方案，并询问他们过去如何处理类似情况。呈现信息？分享清晰、简洁的摘要，并根据高管的兴趣定制数据，重点关注影响和结果。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;b>;准备有力的问题。&lt;/b>;&lt;span style=&quot; font-weight: 400;&quot;>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;无论您想从对话中得到什么，您的主要工作是听。遵循 70/30 规则：你的目标是在 30% 的时间里发言，同时允许你老板的老板在 70% 的时间里发言。通过更多地倾听，您可以利用他们的经验和见解，并且可以更轻松地发现不明显的细微差别。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;另外，您的沟通必须简洁且有目的。你的演讲时间更多地是关于提出正确的问题——展示你的战略思维并获得清晰度的问题。例如：&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot; aria-level=&quot;1&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;从您的角度来看，您认为我们团队应该解决的最重大挑战是什么？&lt;/span>;&lt;/li>; &lt;li样式=“字体粗细：400；” aria-level=&quot;1&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;根据公司的长期战略，您认为我们团队的角色将如何演变？&lt;/span>;&lt;/li>; &lt;li style=&quot;字体粗细：400；” aria-level=&quot;1&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;根据您的观察，我如何在自己的角色中成长，以更好地支持我们的直属团队和更大的组织？&lt;/span>;&lt; /li>; &lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot; aria-level=&quot;1&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;市场有哪些趋势或变化值得我们关注或学习？&lt;/span>;&lt;/li>; &lt;li style =&quot;字体粗细：400；&quot; aria-level=&quot;1&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;当您展望我们公司未来五年或十年时，您希望我们实现哪些关键里程碑？&lt;/span>; &lt;/li>; &lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot; aria-level=&quot;1&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;鉴于我们行业面临的挑战，是什么让您保持乐观？&lt;/span>;&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;h2>;&lt;b >;建立关系。&lt;/b>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;与任何人（尤其是您经理的经理）建立真诚、有意义的关系就是始终如一地表现出尊重、诚信、主动。一点点的感谢会有很大的帮助，所以在会议结束后一定要发送一封后续电子邮件，感谢你的越级老板抽出时间。您还可以总结关键要点或分享您计划如何根据他们的指导采取行动。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;问责制很重要。如果你说过你会回过头来讨论某个观点或问题，那就兑现你的承诺并表明你是可靠的。还可以考虑要求召开季度会议并尽快将其列入日历。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;花时间和精力投资向上的关系，例如与越级经理的关系，需要策略、谦逊和勤奋。毕竟，领导力不仅在于管理下面的人，还在于应对上面的复杂性。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- 引用 -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 19 Sep 2023 20:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[6 Actions CEOs Must Take During a Cyberattack]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/09/6-actions-ceos-must-take-during-a-cyberattack]]><description> &lt;div>;

Mayorkas) 和能源部长詹妮弗·格兰霍姆 (Jennifer Granholm) 于 5 月 11 日在白宫讲台上向美国公众发表讲话，2021 年。新闻发布室是西翼的一个小房间，里面挤满了大约 50 名记者，电视摄像机在后面运行。媒体聚集在这里，通过提出当天最重要问题的尖锐问题，让美国政府对美国公众负责——形成了一个强大的舞台，基本上全世界都在关注。两位国务卿概述了政府正在采取的行动减轻勒索软件攻击的影响。他们还&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/press-briefings/2021/05/11/press-briefing-by-press-secretary-jen-psaki-secretary-of-energy -jennifer-granholm-and-secretary-of-homeland-security-alejandro-mayorkas-may-11-2021/&quot;>;呼吁美国公众“没有理由囤积汽油，特别是在考虑到这一点的情况下”事实上，该管道应在本周末和周末之前基本投入运行。”&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;持久影响&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;殖民地管道勒索软件攻击的地缘政治影响是深远的。在此之后，拜登总统&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/07/09/readout-of-president-joseph-r-biden-jr-call -with-president-vladimir-putin-of- Russia-2/&quot;>;与俄罗斯总统弗拉基米尔·普京直接接触&lt;/a>;，强调了事件的严重性。这场危机还强调了迫切需要&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dhs.gov/news/2021/07/20/dhs-announces-new-cybersecurity-requirements-ritic-pipeline-owners-and-operators ”更强大的&lt;/a>;网络安全措施，特别是对于像殖民地管道这样的关键基础设施。它清楚地提醒我们，网络威胁并不局限于数字世界；网络威胁也不仅仅存在于数字世界。它们会迅速蔓延，造成广泛的破坏和社会影响。最终，殖民管道事件是一个分水岭。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这一事件至今仍在产生连锁反应，重新定义了首席执行官和行业领导者所扮演的角色，并将塑造我们对未来几年网络安全的看法。它还指出了企业领导人需要问自己的一些重要问题，并强调网络事件如何迅速升级为需要美国总统关注的国家安全危机。试想一下，如果 2022 年 2 月下旬或 3 月初，即俄罗斯军队进一步入侵乌克兰几天后，美国再次发生同样具有影响力的勒索软件攻击，会发生什么。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;其中一个连锁反应是首席执行官们的态度思考他们的角色和责任。殖民地管道公司首席执行官约瑟夫·布朗特&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cbsnews.com/news/colonial-pipeline-ceo-ransomware-hackers-senate-hearing/&quot;>;告诉&lt;/a>;国会议员支付大约 430 万美元的比特币作为赎金是“我在能源行业 39 年来做出的最艰难的决定”。是否向黑客支付费用并进一步加剧赎金要求的犯罪循环或&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.securitymagazine.com/articles/93062-ransomware-vicitim-travelex-forced-into-bankruptcy&quot;>;风险&lt;/ a>; 严重破坏甚至破产是不可能的选择。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;首席执行官们显然已经注意到了。很少有人会喜欢从卡诺莎到华盛顿的道路，并成为国会和媒体的焦点。我们从这起事件以及过去两年的其他重大事件中学到了什么？以下是给首席执行官的六项建议：&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;1.小心与公众沟通的方式。 &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;银行挤兑是公众反应和群体心理导致危机恶化的典型例子。 Covid-19 大流行期间的厕纸抢购事件和勒索软件攻击后的加油站抢购事件凸显出这个问题不仅限于金融机构。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;小心与公众沟通的方式和内容。并不意味着避免与公众沟通；相反，这是一种必然。然而，公司需要采取深思熟虑的方法。正如殖民地管道事件所表明的那样，这包括那些很少需要在日常运营中与公众接触的公司，但可能需要日复一日地与公众接触。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>; 2.与政府协调。&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;殖民地管道公司关闭其管道系统的决定需要尽快做出，但可以说有足够的时间咨询美国政府专家。关闭管道系统意味着，无论是否受到感染，都需要数天时间才能重新启动，从而扰乱实际的燃料供应，其所有后果都需要政府采取行动。与政府的协调是避免危机无意中恶化的关键。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;3.知道该联系谁。&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;为了快速做出明智的决策并与合适的人协调，首席执行官需要知道政府中谁是正确的联系人。正如多年来的一些轶事所表明的那样，联系北约或军方并不是正确的答案。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;话虽如此，有时政府并不能让外部各方轻松识别适当的个人或机构，因此政府有责任提供清晰度。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;4.制定一个计划并执行它。&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;这可能是最关键的一点，因为它提供了实现其他目标的工具。除了制定和制定计划（最好由首席执行官监督）之外，该计划还应该每年至少实施一次。定期的桌面练习将帮助公司领导层和员工建立在真正的危机中有效应对所需的“肌肉记忆”。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;5.了解您的网络。&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;理想情况下，首席执行官应该对公司的业务 IT 网络和运营技术 (OT) 网络如何交互有深入的了解。如果系统是气隙的，如果危害仅限于 IT 网络，则无需关闭 OT 网络。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;话虽如此，针对 Colonial Pipeline 的勒索软件攻击已经证明，即使瘫痪业务 IT 网络的变化可能会产生重大影响。如果一家公司无法再开具发票，不知道其客户是谁，也不知道如何联系他们，那么实际影响可能与实际停止生产一样具有破坏性。对于因航空公司 IT 系统&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-airports-systems-idUSKBN18Q10R&quot;>;停机&lt;/a而滞留在机场的读者>;，您亲身经历了破坏性影响。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;6.保持谦虚并寻求专家帮助。&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;网络安全是一个广泛的术语，涵盖高度复杂的问题集。 While there are commonalities and some software is used across sectors, the cybersecurity of pipelines is vastly different from cybersecurity in the context of the financial sector, hospitals, schools, or railways. One key insight after years of cyber incidents spanning sectors is to acknowledge the limits of everyone&#39;s knowledge, including cybersecurity experts&#39; knowledge. CEOs should therefore not hesitate to seek help from outside a company to help develop, test, or refine a plan or review existing processes and policies.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Beyond these high-level recommendations, there are plenty of other resources, including &lt;a href=&quot;https://carnegieendowment.org/specialprojects/fincyber/guides&quot;>;guides and checklists&lt;/a>; for CEOs, board members, and CISOs that are more detailed. The US government, namely its Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), also provides &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cisa.gov/stopransomware&quot;>;Stopransomware.gov&lt;/a>; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cisa.gov/shields-up&quot;>;Shields Up&lt;/a>; as resources designed for companies to use depending on their level of cybersecurity maturity.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Business Leaders as Guardians of Trust&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Beyond strengthening a company&#39;s cybersecurity out of self-interest and to avoid a national security crisis, business leaders also play a bigger role and can be considered guardians of trust in technology overall. Fundamentally, cybersecurity revolves around trust. Ransomware and numerous other cyberattacks exploit this trust. They leverage instances where someone clicks on an untrustworthy link, downloads an attachment from an unknown email address, or receives a malicious software update.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This principle extends to a company&#39;s trust in the technology underlying its systems, drawing geopolitics back into the discussion. The role of Chinese companies with respect to the 5G network has been a central topic for several years now. It marked the beginning of a broader debate about how to consider risk when investing in, purchasing, and using technologies. The US government&#39;s concerns over some technologies emanating from the People&#39;s Republic of China are &lt;a href=&quot;https://2017-2021.state.gov/5g-security/index.html&quot;>;well known&lt;/a>;. Simultaneously, in Brussels and other European capitals, an active &lt;a href=&quot;https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/speech_23_2063&quot;>;debate&lt;/a>; is underway about “de-risking,” influenced by the lessons learned from Russia&#39;s invasion of Ukraine and Europe&#39;s dependence.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Business leaders are at the center of this debate because they are the most important guardians of trust in technology. What technology companies decide to invest in and how they weigh cost against other benefits such as greater security and trust will determine a society&#39;s overall resilience at large.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;A Self-Check for CEOs&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Many have &lt;a href=&quot;/2018/08/corporate-cybersecurity-is-becoming-geopolitical-are-us-tech-companies-ready&quot;>;warned&lt;/a>; over the years of the growing cyber threats and some have &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/04/cyber-risk-is-growing-heres-how-companies-can-keep-up&quot;>;offered&lt;/a>; thoughtful advice for how to strengthen an organization&#39;s protection and resilience. Three questions can help determine whether enough has been done complementing the aforementioned recommendations:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;Have you participated in a cyber tabletop exercise recently?&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Do you have the contact information of your chief information security officer saved somewhere other than your work phone or computer? (Remember, if your company&#39;s networks suffer a ransomware attack, your work devices may be inaccessible.)&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Do you know your point of contact in government in case of a cybersecurity incident?&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;If the answer is “no” to any of these, then reading this article will hopefully inspire some follow-up action — it will help better protect your organization and may prevent a future national security crisis.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 18 Sep 2023 22:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Research: Consumers&rsquo; Sustainability Demands Are Rising]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/09/research-consumers-sustainability-demands-are-rising]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/09/Sep23_18_1272506577.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;Kseniya Ovchinnikova/Getty Images&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;Three factors are driving us toward a major shift in consumption patterns where consumers will consider sustainability as a baseline requirement for purchase: 1) Trust drives behavior and, ultimately, business outcomes; 2) Sustainability promotes trust, particularly among younger generations; and 3) Younger generations will soon have most of the purchasing power in the US Companies that understand these trends &amp;#8212; and create truly sustainable brands that make good on their promises to people and the planet &amp;#8212; will seize advantage from brands that make flimsy claims or have not invested sufficiently in sustainability.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/research-consumers-sustainability-demands-are-rising?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/research-consumers-sustainability-demands-are-rising?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;For most consumers, sustainability has been considered a “nice-to-have” in the brands they buy, but &lt;a href=&quot;https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/retail-distribution/consumer-behavior-trends-state-of-the-consumer-tracker/sustainable-products-and-practices-for-green-living.html&quot;>;it&#39;s rarely been table stakes&lt;/a>;. That&#39;s about to change. Our research suggests we&#39;re on the brink of a major shift in consumption patterns, where truly sustainable brands — those that make good on their promises to people and the planet — will seize the advantage from brands that make flimsy claims or that have not invested sufficiently in sustainability. We&#39;re fast approaching this tipping point where sustainability will be considered a baseline requirement for purchase, and companies should prepare now.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To understand why, you need to know three things:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;Trust drives behavior and, ultimately, business outcomes.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Sustainability promotes trust, particularly among younger generations.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Younger generations will soon have most of the purchasing power in the US&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;1. Trust drives behavior and, ultimately, business outcomes.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;We study trust, and through our research involving hundreds of thousands of consumers and employees across more than 500 brands in 30 sectors, we&#39;ve measured the power of trust to drive a range of positive behaviors.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Trusting employees are more motivated to work, have lower rates of absenteeism, and are less likely to look for another job. Trusting customers are more likely to choose a brand over competitors, buy it again, and promote it.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;And highly trusted companies outperform others by up to 400% in terms of market value. These astonishing returns are realized because the marginal effect of trust on companies&#39; stocks grows as those companies earn trust. Our TrustID platform, &lt;a href=&quot;/2022/11/4-questions-to-measure-and-boost-customer-trust&quot;>;which measures company trust&lt;/a>;, shows that when a company&#39;s score moves from 30 to 31, it sees a roughly 3% increase in expected stock returns. When scores climb from 60 to 61, the increase is 6%.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;2. Sustainability promotes trust, particularly among younger generations.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;With such a high payoff for trust, the obvious question for organizations is: What creates trust in a brand? Our research shows that sustainability is a powerful driver. To understand why, you first must understand where trust comes from.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At its core trust is built when a brand or organization makes good promises and then delivers on them. They do this by conveying a positive&amp;nbsp;&lt;em>;intent&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em>;and demonstrating&amp;nbsp;&lt;em>;competence&lt;/em>;, respectively.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We surveyed more than 350,000 US customers aged 18 to 98 to gauge their perception of brands&#39; intent and competence. We measured intent using a combined score of two of the four factors we use to gauge trust: brands&#39; perceived humanity (empathy, kindness, fairness) and transparency (openness to sharing motives and relevant information in plain language). We measured perceptions of brands&#39; competence using a combination of the remaining two trust factors: capability (the quality of offerings) and reliability (consistent delivery).&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We found not only that sustainability stood out as a critical driver of intent, but that there was an important generational effect. While both younger and older consumers care about brands&#39; competence (their quality and consistency), younger consumers&#39; trust in brands — and their resulting purchasing behavior — is much more strongly influenced by the brands&#39; positive intent.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Consider these findings: When Gen Z and Millennial customers believe a brand cares about its impact on people and the planet, they are 27% more likely to purchase it than older generations are — a clear measure of sustainability&#39;s power to drive buying decisions in this group.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To zoom in a bit further, we can look specifically at the impact of humanity and transparency, the trust factors that comprise good intent.&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;When Gen Z and Millennial customers rate a brand highly on humanity, they are 15% more likely than older generations to spend more money with the brand and choose it over its competitors.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;When they rate a brand highly on transparency, they are 30% more likely than older generations to spend more money with it and 20% more likely to choose it over its competitors.&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;3. Younger generations will soon have most of the purchasing power in the US.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Forecasting experts calculate that the purchasing power of Millennials and Gen Z will surpass that of Boomers around the year 2030, with up to $68 trillion in wealth &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/21/what-the-68-trillion-great-wealth-transfer-means-for-advisors.html&quot;>;transferring&lt;/a>; from Boomers to these younger generations by the end of this decade.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To earn these younger consumers&#39; trust, it&#39;s clear that your brand&#39;s sustainability efforts must deliver on humanity and transparency:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;To highlight &lt;em>;humanity&lt;/em>;, demonstrate that your organization values and respects everyone, regardless of identity, background, or beliefs; respects and takes care of its employees; and puts the good of society and the environment above pure profit-making.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;To underscore &lt;em>;transparency, &lt;/em>;make sure it&#39;s easy for consumers to find straightforward information about your brand&#39;s impact on communities and the environment.&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;Organizations that do this well will reap the rewards. Take our findings among grocery stores as an example. &lt;a href=&quot;https://corporate.publix.com/about-publix/company-overview/mission-statement-guarantee&quot;>;Publix&lt;/a>;, one of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://corporate.publix.com/about-publix/company-overview/facts-figures&quot;>;largest-volume supermarket chains&lt;/a>; in the US, ranks #1 in customer trust of 11 peer grocery brands in our TrustID dataset, with humanity and transparency scores that are 75% and 47% higher than the number-two player, respectively. This difference is even more pronounced with Gen Z and Millennial customers, who score Publix as 83% and 95% higher than the number-two player, respectively. As a result, trusting customers are 54% more likely to purchase from Publix than from competitors. And this is even more pronounced with Gen Z and Millennial customers, who are 162% more likely to purchase from Publix than from competitors.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This trust, and the resulting customer loyalty, flows from Publix&#39;s visible investments in people and the planet. For example, Publix employees automatically receive quarterly stock benefits with the option to purchase additional shares. This makes Publix one of the largest employee-owned companies in the world, with over 200,000 employees who together own roughly 80% of the company. Publix also offers medical and tuition benefits as well as company-matched retirement plans, even for part-time employees. And employees receive regular reviews and raises for performance. These benefits help explain why voluntary turnover is only 5% — compared to the industry standard of 65%. It&#39;s no wonder that Publix is one of only four companies that has consistently landed on Fortune&#39;s “100 Best Companies to Work For” list for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://corporate.publix.com/newsroom/news-stories/04042023---publix-named-on-fortunes-100-best-companies-to-work-for-list#:~:text=LAKELAND%2C%20Fla.%2C%20April%204,the%20list&#39;s%20inception%20in%201998.&quot;>;26th consecutive year&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the planet side, Publix has actively invested in reducing food waste and promoting conservation. For example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://sustainability.publix.com/bakery/reducing-food-waste/&quot;>;in 2022&lt;/a>; the company sent more than 54 million pounds of food waste–manufacturing byproducts to farmers to turn into animal feed. That same year, its seafood department switched from polystyrene containers to returnable plastic totes, eliminating the use of 190,000 containers, while the deli department opted for lighter plastic bags and replaced plastic-wrapped cutlery sets with cutlery stations. Together, these moves eliminate over 360,000 pounds of plastic waste per year. Publix has also created its own line of sustainable food products under the “GreenWise” label, demonstrating its commitment to quality ingredients and strict animal welfare standards.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Let Publix&#39;s experience be a lesson: While the tipping point may not come until 2030, companies of all types should expand their sustainability efforts and communications &lt;em>;today&lt;/em>; to win trust — and customers — in the future.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 18 Sep 2023 21:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[How to Address the Supply-Chain Staffing Crisis]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/09/how-to-address-the-supply-chain-staffing-crisis]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/09/Sep23_18_1405943251.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;SasinT Gallery/Getty Images&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;Businesses are being impacted by a global skills shortage that is hampering manufacturing output and service delivery. In addition, the costs of producing materials, manufacturing goods, and providing services is rising due to labor costs. For small to medium enterprises, this means margins may be squeezed to the point to where they can no longer compete in today&amp;#8217;s hyper-competitive global marketplace. AI, robotics, digital transactions, and related automation provide the means for SMEs to enhance and build capabilities cost-effectively.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/how-to-address-the-supply-chain-staffing-crisis?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/how-to-address-the-supply-chain-staffing-crisis?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;Our global supply chains are stressed and under pressure, not only because of material shortfalls and shipping delays, but also due to labor shortages in key sectors. Skills shortages are now seen across all points of the supply-chain continuum, from sourcing to production, logistics, and delivery of goods and services. These gaps range from more manual tasks, such as warehouse order picking, to building and maintaining supply-chain systems. Technology is now advanced enough to fill in many of the gaps resulting from skills shortages but cannot do it alone. Rebuilding distressed supply chains will require a combination of technology and human skills development strategies.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Recruiting and keeping qualified workers is cited as the leading challenge for the 2,000 supply chain executives responding to a recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mhi.org/publications/report&quot;>;survey&lt;/a>; by MHI, a supply-chain industry trade association. A majority, 57%, state that hiring and retaining qualified workers is this year&#39;s greatest challenge, along with 56% struggling with ongoing specific talent shortages.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A range of industries sensitive to supply-chain vulnerabilities face labor shortages, led by durable goods manufacturing, wholesale and retail trade, and health services, according to an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.uschamber.com/workforce/understanding-americas-labor-shortage-the-most-impacted-industries&quot;>;analysis&lt;/a>; by of the US Chamber of Commerce. “Even if every unemployed person with experience in the durable goods manufacturing industry were employed, the industry would fill only around 75% of the vacant jobs,” the report states.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Sensitive Industries&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Executives and experts across affected industries agree it&#39;s urgent to solve skills shortfalls. Economic headwinds could soften employment demand, but acute staffing challenges are here to stay. Long-term factors such as an aging population and rapidly evolving technology skills gaps have become the new norm in staffing.&lt;/p>; &lt;article-promo>; &lt;hbr-component type=&quot;promo&quot; is-insight=&quot;insight-center&quot; title=&quot;The New Age of Operations&quot; dek=&quot;Improving efficiency and increasing resilience.&quot; cta-text=&quot;&quot; href=&quot;/insight-center/the-new-age-of-operations&quot;>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/insight-center/the-new-age-of-operations&quot; style=&quot;color:black;text-decoration:none&quot;>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; Insight Center Collection &lt;/div>; &lt;h3>;The New Age of Operations&lt;/h3>; &lt;div>; Improving efficiency and increasing resilience. &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hbr-component>; &lt;/article-promo>; &lt;p>;Manufacturing, in particular, represents “the point of the spear for the supply chain,” says Joe Walden, supply chain professor at the University of Kansas. “The labor shortages are hitting these folks the hardest. Regardless of the labor situation at other links in the supply chain, the shortage at this level impacts the availability of products for the consumer.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Within the logistics and distribution sector, “labor shortages are affecting the movement of goods,” says Yikun Shao, B2B North American supply chain leader for Alibaba.com. “Understaffing in logistics areas could lead to delayed shipping, delayed port loading and unloading, shortages of truck drivers and inventory stock-outs, difficulties in fulfilling customer orders on time, and a variety of other challenges.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This, in turn, adversely affects retailers and distributors downstream. “The high cost of labor mixed with ongoing demand for talent has become a detriment to merchants and their fulfillment processes,” says Kelton Kosik, head of supply chain at Ware2Go, a division of UPS. “Even as the strain on global supply chains has somewhat leveled out, a lack of talent during peak shipping seasons — like Cyber Monday and holiday sales events — and abilities to manufacture, move and deliver products can deflate or slow the economy.”&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Technology to the Rescue?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;To address these issues and automate many skills requirements, companies are ramping up their technology investments, the MHI survey shows. Close to three in four of supply chain executives, 74%, are increasing their investments in technology. A majority, 58%, cite artificial intelligence as their current leading area of investment, along with 54% looking to intelligent partner networks through the industrial Internet of Things.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, there is a catch-22 to deploying technology to resolve skills gaps — finding the skills up front to build and maintain AI and IoT systems. Supply-chain executives in the survey cite “lack of adequate talent” as a major hinderance to implementing technologies such as AI or IoT. “Ironically, talent is both a barrier and beneficiary when it comes to implementing innovative technologies,” the report&#39;s authors state. “Although deploying technology to automate routine tasks requires talent and manpower, once the technology is up and running it can free up workers to focus on higher-value tasks that require human involvement.” &amp;nbsp;Higher-value tasks may include working more closely with customers or clients, or coordinating and monitoring the flow of goods or services.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Time to Act&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;A combination of technology and proactive skills development efforts are needed for companies to attract and maintain the skills essential to supporting supply chains, as well as managing the technology to move things forward. Businesses can “increase the productivity of their workers by shifting them from repetitive tasks into roles that current technology is ill equipped to handle,” says Ricardo Ungo, professor and director of the Maritime, Ports and Logistics Institute at Old Dominion University. “This is a necessary step toward the digitalization of the whole chain, providing much needed visibility.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The following actions can help address skills shortages within supply chains:&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;&lt;strong>;Target technology investments.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;“Small to medium enterprises may have a more limited capital investment capability,” says, says Keith Fisher, the president of Honeywell Intelligrated. “They need to prioritize solutions with a clear return on investment. For example, by incorporating automation into parts of their business with high turnover rates, small businesses might see a greater impact on improved productivity for a more immediate ROI.”&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;&lt;strong>;Position technologies to pick up the slack for manual or repetitive tasks.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;All-encompassing automation approaches have been particularly helpful within organizations that require scaling up manual or repetitive work, such as distribution operations. Robots, for example, can be employed for scanning, assembling, and moving parts and products across distribution centers or warehouses. Robots, along with automatic storage and retrieval systems, and automation systems, can pick up the slack for many physically demanding jobs,” says Walden.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Such applications “help increase the productivity of distribution center workers by reducing significantly the time spent traveling from one location to pick products to another,” Walden adds. “Many of the automation concepts from automated picking to robotic pallet building to automated packaging are finally finding their way into distribution centers to offset the shortage of workers.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, comprehensive automation is “providing opportunities to integrate automation and robotics capabilities to fill labor gaps and manage mundane tasks like automated taping, label applications and scanning,” says Kosik. “Remaining talent can focus on more pressing tasks as well. Companies can use AI for better demand forecasting to ensure labor is being most efficiently allocated.”&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;&lt;strong>;Leverage technology to enhance the work of employees.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;At their core, supply chains will always be more than automated systems or algorithms exchanging information and purchase orders. “Supply chains are social networks,” writes Yossi Sheffi, professor of engineering systems at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in his book, &lt;em>;The Magic Conveyor Belt: Supply Chains, AI, and the Future of Work.&lt;/em>; “When it comes to making decisions in a supply chain, such as managing exceptions or escalating problems, the personal relationships between the people in the companies and both their customers and suppliers matter. Customer-supplier relationships can be complex “with a web of personal relationships.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Technology solutions should be purposed to enhance these relationships, as well as increase the productivity of workers at all levels.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, “the use of AI-augmented reality allows the employment of people with limited or no experience, because they are instructed by the software to do certain tasks,” Sheffi illustrates.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another emerging use case for AI filling in for skills shortages is autonomous trucking. For example, a “truck platoon,” led by a human driver in a lead truck, consists of electronically linked trucks that follow the movements of the lead truck. “Many companies are investing in developing Level 4 automated driving technologies to haul freight in long-haul routes, allowing them to overcome a lack of drivers caused by the aversion to the long hours away from home,” Lungo says.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;&lt;strong>;Train and develop employees&#39; skills to manage modern supply chains&lt;/strong>;.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Organizations should think of talent as also having its own supply chain, Sheffi advocates. This serves “to deliver the skills that people need to enable them to get and retain good jobs,” and from an employer perspective, “to ensure that companies have the skilled talent they need to produce affordable and valuable products and services for customers.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For small to medium-size businesses, training is essential. “Properly training teams to comprehend the technology&#39;s functionality and operate it effectively is vital,” says Fisher. “This not only helps them get the new technology operational more quickly but improves the adoption and, ultimately, the value of the investment.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In recent years, there has been a 15% increase in the number of organizations investing in upskilling and reskilling programs, with 41% focusing on working to prepare their workers for new tech-forward supply chain jobs, the MHI survey finds, Upskilling is essential to provide the education and training needed to boost skills across front-line supply-chain jobs. “For example, an operations manager who currently uses Microsoft Excel could be trained on a more sophisticated process to integrate supply chain information using new software for shipping and logistics management,” according to the report.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Today&#39;s supply chains have fragile links — companies are struggling to find and retain the workers they need to keep goods and information flowing. This is an opportunity to step up technology investments to automate as much of the work in production, logistics, and delivery of goods and services as possible. At the same time, technology alone cannot shoulder the scope of work needed. Employers also need to step up their skills acquisition and development, helping workers learn and work with technology to deliver results.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Technology can be employed to “support human workers in countless ways: fostering new capabilities and behaviors; improving operational performance; increasing safety; and supporting a more optimal work-life balance,” the MHI report advocates. “New workplace technologies are emerging that don&#39;t just augment human workers and perform mundane work. Rather, when used strategically, they have the ability to help individuals and teams upskill and reskill their capabilities.”&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 18 Sep 2023 21:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[How the Geeks Rewrote the Rules of Management]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/09/how-the-geeks-rewrote-the-rules-of-management]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;div js-target=&quot;video-player-page&quot; data-props=&quot;{&amp;quot;name&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;6337217510112&amp;quot;}&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>;&lt;/div>; &lt;div>;&lt;/div>; &lt;div>;&lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;span>;Loading... &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;script src=&quot;//players.brightcove.net/2071817190001/default_default/index.min.js&quot;>;&lt;/script>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;Andrew McAfee is a principal research scientist at the MIT Sloan School of Management. Throughout his career, he has done ground-breaking research on how digital technologies are changing the world. He is a prolific writer, a frequent contributor to HBR and other outlets, and a sought-after commentator on technological change &amp;#8211; especially, these days, on the potential of generative AI. He is the author of the forthcoming book &amp;#8220;The Geek Way: The Radical Mindset that Drives Extraordinary Results,&amp;#8221; the subject of much of this &amp;#8220;New World of Work&amp;#8221;面试。 His big idea is that &amp;#8220;geeks&amp;#8221; have created not only the technology that&amp;#8217;s driving our future but also a management approach that defines contemporary corporate excellence. It&amp;#8217;sa somewhat contrarian view; after all, many of us have criticized Silicon Valley-run businesses as being male-dominated and lacking in empathy (even, of course, as we continue to use their products). What does McAfee mean by geek? He defines them as &amp;#8220;obsessive mavericks,&amp;#8221; people who become obsessed with hard problems and are willing to pursue unconventional solutions &amp;#8211; to avoid the dysfunctions that have traditionally plagued companies as they expand.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/how-the-geeks-rewrote-the-rules-of-management?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/how-the-geeks-rewrote-the-rules-of-management?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;The secret to success for many Silicon Valley tech companies isn&#39;t necessarily that they&#39;re ultra-nimble start-ups, or that they&#39;re led by tech-savvy geniuses. In fact, their success often has more to do with a specific type of corporate culture—and it&#39;s a culture that even companies not based on the US West Coast or focused on technology can adopt.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Andrew McAfee, a principal research scientist at the MIT Sloan School of Management, business leaders need to think more like geeks, but not the computer-based stereotype you may be familiar with. In his forthcoming book, &lt;em>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Geek-Way-Radical-Transforming-Business/dp/0316436704&quot;>;The Geek Way: The Radical Mindset that Drives Extraordinary Results&lt;/a>;&lt;/em>;, McAfee says geeks are nothing more or less than “obsessive mavericks” who are absolutely fixated on finding unconventional solutions to their business&#39; hard problems. You need them throughout the organization, not just at the top, and you need to entrust them with the power to make real changes.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For this episode of our video series “The New World of Work”, HBR editor in chief Adi Ignatius sat down with McAfee to discuss:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;Evolving a company&#39;s culture not by focusing on organizational structure, but on company norms&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Building organizations that can get things right, even when the person at the top of the org chart is wrong&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;The delicate balance of human judgment and evidence, data-driven insights.&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;“&lt;a href=&quot;/insight-center/the-new-world-of-work&quot;>;The New World of Work&lt;/a>;” explores how top-tier executives see the future and how their companies are trying to set themselves up for success. Each week, Ignatius talks to a top leader on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/company/harvard-business-review/&quot;>;LinkedIn Live&lt;/a>; — previous interviews included &lt;a href=&quot;/2021/10/microsofts-satya-nadella-on-flexible-work-the-metaverse-and-the-power-of-empathy&quot;>;Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella&lt;/a>; and &lt;a href=&quot;/2021/11/indra-nooyi-former-ceo-of-pepsico-on-nurturing-talent-in-turbulent-times&quot;>;former PepsiCo CEO Indra Nooyi&lt;/a>;.

My definition has two parts. For me a geek is somebody who gets obsessed with a hard problem and is willing to embrace unconventional solutions.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The patron saint of geeks is probably &lt;a href=&quot;https://amshq.org/About-Montessori/History-of-Montessori/Who-Was-Maria-Montessori&quot;>;Maria Montessori&lt;/a>;, who about 100 years ago got obsessed with the problem of how you educate young children best, and came up with the Montessori educational method, which is this radical departure from the industrial scale model of schools that was dominant then, and sadly still dominant now. Think about Maria Montessori when you think about a geek.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;How do you define the “geek way” that you&#39;re talking about in the book?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ANDREW MCAFEE:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The particular geeks I got excited about that led me to write the book were not educational geeks like Maria Montessori, they were business geeks. They were a group of people concentrated on—but not exclusive to—the West Coast of the US who got obsessed with this problem of, “How do we run a company in an age of really fast technological change and lots of uncertainty? And in particular, how do we avoid some of the classic dysfunctions of the internet era?”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The geek way is what they&#39;ve come up with. It&#39;s the business model, or the culture, or the set of norms that they&#39;ve settled on to try to accomplish that really hard goal.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It&#39;s sort of people who nerd out on, in this case, management, right? Processes of management.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ANDREW MCAFEE:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Obsessive maverick” is my preferred phrase for a geek. And the obsessive mavericks that I got really interested in were the ones who dove in, again, on this problem of, “How do we run a company and keep doing well in our markets and avoid the dysfunctions that seem to plague so many successful companies as they get older and bigger? How do we avoid those dysfunctions? How do we do something that&#39;s higher performing, more sustainable, and a better place to work?”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As I read the book, some of those attributes you talked about, they had to do with speed, they had to do with experimentation. Is this just another term for being digital, or for applying design thinking of the business? Are we talking the same thing here?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ANDREW MCAFEE:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;No, I don&#39;t think so. Adi, you remember &lt;a href=&quot;https://variety.com/2023/digital/news/jeffrey-katzenberg-quibi-proud-to-own-failure-1235623036/&quot;>;Quibi&lt;/a>;, right, the Jeffrey Katzenberg-led video startup? It was going to do short-form videos and it was going to change the way we consume entertainment.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Quibi was entirely digital. It was a completely digital enterprise. It was a miserable failure. They raised $1.75 billion. They shut down within 200 days of their launch. It was just a catastrophe. It was a completely digital enterprise.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Netflix is a geek company. They follow all four of my great geek norms of science, ownership, speed and openness. And I think their results speak for themselves.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Geek for me is entirely separate from digital. You can be a non-digital geek, and you can certainly be very digital and not geeky at all.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Quibi thing is an interesting example. I guess what was missing from your framework was the openness. You had a powerful guy who had been successful, who wasn&#39;t listening.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ANDREW MCAFEE:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Not listening to his peers, to his colleagues, to his advisor. He didn&#39;t appear to be a great listener, which is this kind of stereotypical trap that a lot of industrial-era companies fall into. Tech leaders also fall into this trap quite often. You become enamored of your own success and you really stop listening. It&#39;s incredibly common.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One of the things that is powerful, and that I respect about people like Reed Hastings at Netflix is that he was able to build a business that got important decisions right when he himself was wrong about them. In the book I talk about a couple of them.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He was dead-flat wrong about the utility of downloading to the Netflix app. He thought it wouldn&#39;t be very useful at all; it&#39;s incredibly useful.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He was wrong about the importance of kids&#39; programming for Netflix. And he admits this in the book, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/No-Rules-Netflix-Culture-Reinvention/dp/1984877860&quot;>;&lt;em>;No Rules Rules&lt;/em>;&lt;/a>; that he wrote with Erin Meyer.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He successfully worked hard on building a company that would correct him, the boss, the high status prestigious person at the top of the organization. It&#39;s part of this great geek norm of openness that I talk about. How do you build a company that will get it right when the person at the top of the org chart is wrong? Man, that&#39;s a hard problem.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It&#39;s a hard problem. And I&#39;m sure some people are going to read your book and think, “Hang on, a lot of these companies we&#39;re talking about are Silicon Valley startups or somewhere in that realm.” The popular perception is these are not cultures that you necessarily want to emulate. They&#39;re often male-dominated bro-cultures. The boss frequently is an overly demanding bully. How do you square all this?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ANDREW MCAFEE:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There clearly is some of that going on in the Valley. There are toxic cultures. You mentioned the bro-culture. I would say that &lt;a href=&quot;/2022/11/why-startups-should-embrace-radical-transparency&quot;>;Theranos&lt;/a>; is one of the most toxic cultures I&#39;ve ever heard about, and it was headquartered in Silicon Valley.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I don&#39;t think those are geek companies at all. They might be in the right geographic location, but they&#39;re not following the geek way, which is about these norms and about creating a culture that is fast-moving, free-flowing, argumentative, autonomous, evidence-driven, and pretty egalitarian. That&#39;s the goal of the geek way.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Now you point out some of these companies that I do think follow the geek way that are still too pale, stale, and male. That&#39;s absolutely true. The evidence is pretty clear on this. I hope that gets better over time.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But Adi, you said something that I disagree with, that a lot of these cultures that are not good places to work. That&#39;s true in some cases. Remember when LinkedIn did its top attractors survey, I believe in 2016, they said, look, we&#39;re just going to look at objective criteria. We&#39;re going to look at which company pages get viewed the most often by LinkedIn members. Which companies get the most interest from LinkedIn members, the most applications, and where do people stick around when they take their first job?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The top 11 attractors in the LinkedIn list were all companies headquartered on the West Coast in the industry that we loosely call tech. The geek culture is an extremely attractive culture to work in.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some of these founders, entrepreneurs who got into whatever they got into because they wanted to make the world a better place, Serge and Larry in their garage trying to systematize our access to all the world&#39;s information, these great ideals: when they are actually running companies, they not only are trying to run a company, but they become killers, wanting to wipe out the competition, to foster monopolistic practices, to just grab as much market share as possible.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ANDREW MCAFEE:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Is any of this new? Within the businesses? No, I&#39;m serious. Were the businesses of previous eras cuddly? Did they want their competitors to succeed? Were they trying to rise all boats?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Capitalism is an inherently competitive process. These companies are very, very good performers. If you want to use the adjective “killer” for them, I think that&#39;s by design. You&#39;re not in business not to succeed. You want to grow your market share. You want to grow your profits, you want grow. That is often at the expense of somebody else.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I think it&#39;s for the courts to decide whether they meet the definition of monopolist. It&#39;s a word we toss around a lot. The courts so far have tossed out a lot of the recent lawsuits against some of these giant tech companies. I don&#39;t think they meet the definition of monopolist. In general, for a lot of these companies, the competition is one click away.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;And is Tesla a monopolist in the auto industry? You simply can&#39;t make that case. SpaceX has become pretty close to a monopolist in the rockets and satellites industry, but they didn&#39;t start that way, and they&#39;ve become so large and influential because they do the job better.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Let&#39;s talk about companies that are doing it right. This is not universally for digital companies. Some follow the geek way, as you&#39;ve laid it out, some don&#39;t.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;How many companies, large, small, digital, otherwise live into these principles, do you think?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ANDREW MCAFEE:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I think that&#39;s a really interesting question, and I don&#39;t have a great way to answer it yet. Because the only way that I can think to answer it is to administer a survey to everybody and get them to fill it out. That&#39;s just not going to work.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But you can look at what we know about the cultures at these companies. You can also look at the fantastic &lt;a href=&quot;https://sloanreview.mit.edu/projects/culture-500-introducing-the-2020-culture-champions/&quot;>;Culture 500 research that Don and Charlie Sull&lt;/a>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sloanreview.mit.edu/projects/culture-500-introducing-the-2020-culture-champions/&quot;>; did&lt;/a>;, published in a competitor magazine of yours, &lt;em>;Sloan Management Review&lt;/em>;. They grabbed all the LinkedIn reviews and put them through a machine-learning analysis to see what companies&#39; own employees said about them.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Three areas I was most interested in were execution, agility, and innovation. And wow, the scores for companies clustered on the West Coast, clustered in Silicon Valley, clustered in industries that we call high-tech, those scores are off the charts. There&#39;s not any real competition for them.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There&#39;s something brewing on the West Coast in industries that we label (for reasons that I don&#39;t like very much) high-tech. There&#39;s something brewing that&#39;s new, that is different than what&#39;s going on elsewhere in the economy, and it&#39;s pretty demonstrably powerful. The label that I hang on that is the geek way.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Was Steve Jobs a geek, and did his Apple follow the geek way or was that a different model?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ANDREW MCAFEE:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Jobs has some really classic non-geek characteristics. He believed that he knew best. He had a very, very large ego. He also screamed at his subordinates all the time, which I think is absolutely not what an open leader does.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, I interviewed Eric Schmidt for the book, and I brought this up to him and he said, “Look, I was on Apple&#39;s board for a while. I knew Steve pretty well.” He said Steve was a tough person in all those ways, but he learned that if you want to stay on top, you have to listen to the people around you. You have to stop thinking that you have all the answers.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We see a really clear example of that with the App Store. Jobs did not want to open up his beautiful, perfect walled garden iPhone to outside developers. He had to be talked into it. He eventually realized that he was wrong about that. There is a little bit of that openness going on.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One thing that Apple is pretty fanatic about, as I understand it, is they make decisions based on evidence. And whether or not that&#39;s a huge AB testing infrastructure is one thing. Apple loves to demo features, and gets everybody in the room to look at this and say, for example, is it better to have blurry portrait photos where you can adjust the blur before you take the picture? The instant they did a demo, they had the answer to that question. They did not sit around and argue from their different points of view. They said, OK, let&#39;s run an experiment. Let&#39;s do a demo here. That&#39;s an extremely geeky approach.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One of the interesting things about Jobs, and certainly something he would&#39;ve said about himself, he did say about himself, was that he didn&#39;t, and that one shouldn&#39;t, slavishly follow the focus groups. People don&#39;t know what they want.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It&#39;s a combination of let&#39;s get input, but there is a lot of personal touch, personal feel. It&#39;s like &lt;em>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Moneyball-Art-Winning-Unfair-Game/dp/0393324818&quot;>;Moneyball&lt;/a>;&lt;/em>; versus the old school. Maybe the answer is a combination of skills.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ANDREW MCAFEE:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Absolutely. And Ted Sarandos, who&#39;s the co-CEO of Netflix, says their decision-making is pretty algorithmic. It&#39;s 70-30 algorithmic versus human judgment. But he said, if anything, the human judgment is on top, if that makes any sense.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I think that makes a ton of sense. This norm of science that the geeks are pretty passionate about, it&#39;s not just dry analysis and do whatever the data says. That&#39;s an inaccurate caricature.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Science is about settling arguments with evidence. It&#39;s a ground rule for how you&#39;re going to come to a decision. You&#39;re going to do a test, you&#39;re going to do an experiment. You&#39;re going to sit around in a group and argue about it. And if you can&#39;t agree, evidence is going to settle this issue.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Science is this inherently, deeply social, deeply argumentative process with a ground rule. Evidence is the queen here. That&#39;s what we&#39;re going to follow. And a lot of the geek companies that I respect do that as naturally as breathing.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One of the examples in your book of geek culture triumphing is Microsoft, and specifically when &lt;a href=&quot;/2021/10/microsofts-satya-nadella-on-flexible-work-the-metaverse-and-the-power-of-empathy&quot;>;Satya Nadella&lt;/a>; came in and rekindled that early success and more. Talk a bit about what he got right, particularly in the framework that you&#39;ve created.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ANDREW MCAFEE:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Can you think of a more impressive corporate turnaround story in living memory?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;No. Microsoft went from the tech company we liked least to maybe the one we like best.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ANDREW MCAFEE:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;And if you were an investor, you really didn&#39;t like it for about a decade. The stock price was flat as a corpse&#39;s EKG. And then Nadella took over, and it&#39;s become one of the most valuable companies in the world. It&#39;s an astonishing comeback story.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I got to interview Nadella for the book. He&#39;d made brilliant strategic moves, a bunch of them. You have Microsoft embracing open source, wow.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But I was interested in the cultural changes that he made. And he did a couple things that I think are straight out of the geek playbook. Some of them are obvious. He embraced agile development methods as widely and quickly as possible inside Microsoft. He did a couple things to reduce the sclerotic bureaucracy that was in place at Microsoft, which was just hamstringing their ability to do anything important out there in the world.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One of the brilliant things he did was say, “Look, you cannot own a digital resource inside Microsoft. You cannot own the data. You cannot own the code.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;And what he meant by that was you can&#39;t be the gatekeeper. You can&#39;t say yes or no to other groups who might want to use it. With that one simple move, he said to the company, “Look, if the AI group wants to go grab all of the GitHub code to train up a model to help provide assistance to programmers, you don&#39;t have to ask permission. Just go do that, subject to all the right constraints and safeties on it.” Man, that is an astonishingly good bureaucracy-reduction mechanism.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Maybe the deepest thing that Nadella did was that he pulled off this amazing feat of helping Microsoft become a less defensive organization. What I mean by that was, he said in his interview with me, “We had a culture where it was not OK to be wrong, to show any weakness, to not hit your numbers, to not be the smartest person in the room.” He said, “We just had that culture and it had to change.” He did a number of really brilliant things to move from a culture of defensiveness to a culture of openness.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When I used to hear this word, “vulnerability”, in connection with leadership or business, I thought it was just a buzz phrase, hand wavy, nonsense business. The company is not a therapy group. It&#39;s not there so you can sit around feeling vulnerable all the time. I was just wrong.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Now, the company is not your therapy group. However, a successful company needs to be a place where it&#39;s okay to be wrong, to fail, to not have the answer, to show that you&#39;re uncertain. Nadella helped get Microsoft down that path, and it was an absolutely fundamental thing to do.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I also interviewed Yamini Rangan, who&#39;s the CEO of HubSpot here in Cambridge, who took over a culture and has strengthened it through a really difficult time through the pandemic.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She discussed one of the things she learned and that she was good at was saying in this unbelievably uncertain time of the pandemic where tech companies were shrinking. It was all weird. She said to a lot of her constituencies, “Look, I don&#39;t know. I don&#39;t know what the future holds here. I&#39;m going to be honest with you.” She also shared her board performance review with her direct reports, not just the good parts, but the stuff that she needs to work on too. These are all just great moves to start to show the rest of the organization it is okay not to be perfect, not to put on the brave front, not to be winning all of the time.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Jack Welch&#39;s autobiography was called &lt;em>;Winning&lt;/em>;, and it epitomized this industrial era view of what you have to do all day every day. I love the geek view, which is, “Hey, man, we&#39;re going to launch some rockets and they are going to blow up. Now, we&#39;re not going to kill anybody, but we&#39;re absolutely going to launch some rockets that are going to blow up on the launchpad.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Bezos said a few years back in the shareholder&#39;s letter, “We are incubating multi-billion dollar failures inside Amazon right now. That&#39;s appropriate for a company of our scale.” And you look at Alexa and I think maybe he was right about that.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But the point is that this obsession with winning and being on top and being right and being dominant, that has to go away.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I want to get to audience questions. One came from Shabana in Pakistan. What kinds of organizational design, organizational structures, do you need to foster this sort of geek culture?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ANDREW MCAFEE:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I don&#39;t think org structure is the key because the companies that I surveyed have very, very different org charts. They also have very different formal practices.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Netflix is fairly famous for having the no-vacation-days policy. Amazon has extremely strict vacation policies for different levels of employee.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I think it&#39;s not a matter of the org chart or the org structure that you have. It&#39;s not so much a matter of how formal a lot of your policies are. It&#39;s a matter of your norms. I love that word and I use it in the book all the time.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A norm is a behavior that the people around you expect. Maybe it&#39;s written down in the employee manual. Very often it&#39;s not. It&#39;s community policing. It&#39;s what the people around you expect. If you go out of line and violate a norm in a community, you will know that fairly quickly and you will either come back into line or you&#39;re just not going to stick around very long.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you can work on these norms of science, argue about evidence, of ownership, push authority and decision-making down to an uncomfortable degree, speed, iterate, don&#39;t plan, don&#39;t analyze, build stuff, get feedback, learn from reality and then openness. Don&#39;t be defensive. Be willing to pivot. Be willing to admit that you&#39;re wrong. They show a little vulnerability. Those are the norms that are critical for the geek way.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So Bob from our audience is asking, “Is the stack of books on your right your reading list for the week?”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ANDREW MCAFEE:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These are from all over the place. But there was a stack of books that I kept referring to when I was writing &lt;em>;The Geek Way&lt;/em>;, and they were not business books. I am sorry to admit this as a business book writer.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;They were books from this relatively new field called cultural evolution, which gets at this fundamental question, “Why are we the only species on the planet that builds spaceships?” Nothing else is even close. We&#39;re really the only ones out there. The octopuses are not going to do it. The ants, the bees, the chimpanzees are not going to do it. Why are we humans the only spaceship-building species on the planet? This field of cultural evolution to me has come up with the best answer to that question, which is we are the only species that cooperates intensely with large numbers of people that we&#39;re not related to. We are the species that learns the quickest, that improves its toolkit, its technologies, its cultures most rapidly over time.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;You can take that and put that to work in a company. A company is a large group of mostly unrelated people. And the goal of a company is to improve its culture, its artifacts, its technologies, its practices over time. The goal of a company is to practice very rapid cultural evolution. Now that we know a bit about how cultural evolution happens, we can put those insights to work.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There&#39;s this massive unexplored opportunity to take the insights from this field and put them to work inside the company. I think it&#39;s so massive because I haven&#39;t heard anybody talk using cultural evolution&#39;s terms inside even very geeky companies. This is very, very new stuff. And I think &lt;em>;The Geek Way&lt;/em>; is the first applied business book of cultural evolution.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I think I just figured something out. You&#39;re a total geek.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ANDREW MCAFEE:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We&#39;ve been working together for years. It took you this long to realize this?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But the thing that I got obsessed with was that in my career, I&#39;ve spent a lot of time in the (I hate these labels) old economy and the new economy, lots of industrial-era incumbents, and then a lot of companies clustered in the tech space, clustered on the West Coast.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For my whole career, I have been trying to pattern match and figure out what the deep differences are between the two. Is it the foosball tables? Is it the hoodies? Is it bringing your dog to work? No, obviously not.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Where the action is in the economy, where the excitement is in the economy, what are they doing differently? And &lt;em>;The Geek Way&lt;/em>; contains my answers to that kind of career long, geeky, head scratching question.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Let&#39;s get practical for our viewers who aren&#39;t in classically geeky cultures. How can they apply the approaches you&#39;re championing, at their own companies?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ANDREW MCAFEE:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Here are a few things you can start doing tomorrow that are extremely geeky practices that will get some traction. When you&#39;re in charge of your group or you&#39;re a team member or you&#39;re leading a team, if you say things like, “Oh, that&#39;s a good point. I hadn&#39;t thought of that. Let&#39;s go that way,” or, “Oh, I was wrong about that. That&#39;s really good to know,” you have just demonstrated openness and vulnerability instead of classic defensiveness.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;That&#39;s hard to do. Human beings are inherently defensive people, we don&#39;t like being shown to be wrong in public. It&#39;s deeply uncomfortable. But if you model that behavior, it will start to spread. And I&#39;ve seen geek leaders do that over and over.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;You can start to push decisions and responsibility down to a place that makes you uncomfortable, and to get out of saying, “Just run that by me first,” or, “Make sure I&#39;m included on that,” and try to get rid of the hard and soft bureaucracy that gets in the way.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I was talking to &lt;a href=&quot;http://robots.stanford.edu/&quot;>;Sebastian Thrun&lt;/a>;, who&#39;s an alpha geek in all kinds of things, and he said, “One of the things I try to get my teams to do is stop so much communicating.” He had this great image. He said, “A team works on something, and then they run it up the flagpole.” He said the really natural tendency is for the people at every layer of the org chart to add something to that because they want to be part of the solution, they want to be part of this winning idea. By the time that idea gets back down to the originating team, it&#39;s unrecognizable. Get out of that business.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Again, this is uncomfortable stuff to do, but it&#39;s a big step toward the geek way. And then finally, you can start to say, “How are we going to make this decision? Can we agree on what evidence we&#39;re going to look at to make this decision?”, as opposed to saying, “Well, I&#39;m the boss,” or, “I got it right last time, so you should listen to me this time,” all these other ways we have to make decisions, credentials, hierarchy, charisma, excellent PowerPoint, all these things: get out of that business and start asking for the consensus on, “How are we going to settle this argument? What evidence are we going to look at?” These are all super geeky practices you can start doing tomorrow.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Here&#39;s another audience question. This is Lori from North Carolina, and it&#39;s another very practical question: how can organizations get leaders to unlearn the idea that failure is bad?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ANDREW MCAFEE:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is a super hard question, and I fall back on something that I learned from &lt;a href=&quot;/2020/01/the-essential-clayton-christensen-articles&quot;>;Clay Christensen&lt;/a>;: one of the things Clay taught me is that managers are voracious consumers of theory. He said, “Don&#39;t be afraid to tell them why this needs to change, what the principle, what the framework is.” And he said, “If you want to get people to change, there&#39;s a kind of a tripod. There are three things you have to do over and over again more until you&#39;re absolutely exhausted.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First of all, tell them a vivid story. We humans respond to narratives. Second, give them some evidence, give them some numbers to show that it works. And third, give them a theory. Explain why it works. You&#39;ve just got to go through all three of those legs.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Why can&#39;t we make decisions this way? I&#39;m a pretty smart person. I reached this place on the org chart because of my excellent judgment. What do you mean we should be relying a lot less on my judgment?” Again, three part answer to that question, keep iterating on it. It is not an easy process.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I think a lot of companies who get interested in what Silicon Valley does differently or might want to embrace the geek way are going to find it hard going because a lot of it is unnatural and uncomfortable. Challenging your boss in a meeting in most circumstances is uncomfortable, until it becomes a norm, until it becomes what people around you expect.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I can&#39;t let you go without talking a little bit about generative AI. You have an article in the next issue of HBR on how businesses can most effectively capitalize on the technology. What is your thinking, your quick overview, on the utility of GenAI, and its likely impact on, let&#39;s say, the white-collar workforce?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ANDREW MCAFEE:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The more I think about GenAI, the more I think we&#39;re underestimating its impact. It is so general, it is so powerful, it is improving so quickly, it&#39;s leading to so many complementary innovations. I have never seen the computer science geeks, the economic geeks, and the business geeks all get so excited about anything in my career, which is actually a quarter-century long by this point.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Generative AI is going to change the business world. It&#39;s probably going to do it quicker than a lot of us are thinking, and waiting around on the sidelines and not being part of that transformation is a deeply lousy strategy: get a plan together and then just go do stuff.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;All right, Andy, we&#39;ve run a little bit long, so we&#39;re going to cut you off here. I could talk all day with you about all these topics, and our audience is clearly into it and engaged. Thank you very much for being on the show.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ANDREW MCAFEE:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Adi, always a pleasure. Thank you for having me.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 16 Sep 2023 01:25:02 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[A More Impactful Strategy for Sustainable Investing]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/09/a-more-impactful-strategy-for-sustainable-investing]]><description>&lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/09/Sept23_15_1589828250.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;Hiroshi Watanabe/Getty Images&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;The effectiveness of sustainable investing has been challenged, with critics like Tariq Fancy describing it as a mere placebo. Amidst rising skepticism and stricter disclosure requirements, a deeper dive reveals that traditional methods of influencing companies, namely &amp;#8220;voice&amp;#8221; (shareholder engagement) and &amp;#8220;exit&amp;#8221; (portfolio screening), are not exhaustive. Through a comprehensive review of over 3,500 research papers, a new approach &amp;#8212; &amp;#8220;field building&amp;#8221; &amp;#8212; emerges. This tactic acknowledges the interconnected web of stakeholders around companies, termed &amp;#8220;fields&amp;#8221;, that profoundly influence corporate behavior. By reshaping these fields, investors can indirectly drive sustainable change in firms. Five tactics are highlighted: (1) Shifting other investors&amp;#8217; evaluation of issues, (2) Sharing expertise, (3) Delegitimizing certain business activities, (4) Establishing voluntary standards, and (5) Supporting regulatory changes. While promising, field-building presents challenges like profitability and political exposure. Yet, by embracing this expanded toolkit, investors can magnify their positive impact and appeal to an increasingly conscious investment clientele.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/a-more-impactful-strategy-for-sustainable-investing?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/a-more-impactful-strategy-for-sustainable-investing?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;Whether sustainable investors can have a positive impact on business and society has been the center of debate in recent years. One major obstacle holding sustainable investing back from maximizing its impact is that most investors operate with too narrow of an understanding of how impact can come about. Most investors believe they have two primary ways to influence companies. First, there&#39;s portfolio screening, often termed “exit.” In this approach, investors shift capital from non-sustainable to sustainable companies. The second strategy is shareholder engagement, frequently called “voice.” Here, investors directly urge companies to adopt more sustainable practices through means like meetings, shareholder proposals, or voting.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But in our research, we have found that some unconventional investors go beyond the “exit” versus “voice” dichotomy. We have mapped their activities through a &lt;a href=&quot;https://eur03.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fonlinelibrary.wiley.com%2Fdoi%2Fepdf%2F10.1111%2Fjoms.12957&amp;amp;data=05%7C01%7Cmarti%40rsm.nl%7C5617faa4f4e6474822f608dbae59fdb1%7C715902d6f63e4b8d929b4bb170bad492%7C0%7C0%7C638295474207071901%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=qcr%2FaLPS2qF%2FkUPnG%2FDtSQEMQjLx0nl%2BrNN2UuL8oD8%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0&quot;>;systematic review of research&lt;/a>; for which we screened more than 3,500 research papers on sustainable investing. Based on this review and conversations we&#39;ve had with practitioners, we put forth a case for a third, potentially more impactful sustainable investing strategy: &lt;em>;field building.&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Field building works because companies are always embedded in fields. The term “fields” is closely related to industries, but broader. Fields encompass both companies (eg, oil and gas companies) and the stakeholders with which companies interact most frequently (eg, investors, regulators, or media). Through these interactions, actors within fields develop assumptions, norms, and rules that shape the behavior of companies within a field. In short, a field captures those parts of the external environment of a company that have the most direct influence on a company. Field building means that investors influence companies by changing the (1) stakeholders and (2) assumptions, norms, and rules that surround companies, thereby exerting their influence on companies indirectly.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We have found five tactics for field building that sustainable investors can use to increase their impact.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Shifting other investors&#39; evaluation of issues&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;As a first tactic for field building, investors can shift other investors&#39; evaluation of environmental and social issues. By publicly and continuously highlighting these environmental and social issues, an investor can raise attention to environmental and social issues among other investors and thereby motivate these other investors to influence companies.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This tactic is particularly relevant for investors that do not have enough assets under management or status to directly influence companies. By influencing larger investors with more direct influence on companies, investors can change the fields in which companies operate in ways that expose companies to more pressure for corporate sustainability.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Dutch shareholder “FollowThis” has used this first tactic very successfully since 2014 to influence oil and gas companies. FollowThis submits shareholder proposals on behalf of over 10,000 individuals who have bought shares of oil and gas companies. While FollowThis has neither the assets under management nor the elite status to be taken very seriously by oil and gas companies themselves, their approach has been very successful in influencing big Dutch pension funds. Some pension funds followed suit after their initial refusal to support FollowThis led to protests from beneficiaries and negative media attention — including ABP, the largest Dutch pension fund with over 500 billion Euro assets under management.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Sharing expertise with other investors&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;A second tactic for field building is to share expertise with other investors. Investors that are new to sustainable investing often struggle with the inherent complexity of environmental and social issues, and know neither what demands are realistic nor how to raise their demand in ways that make business sense for companies. By making private information publicly available, investors can empower other investors to influence companies. When other investors know more about sustainability, this creates additional pressure for corporate sustainability within the fields in which companies operate.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The international asset manager Robeco has used this tactic since August 2022, when it made its SDG framework openly accessible. This framework assesses the degree to which over 2,900 companies advance or undermine the 17 sustainable development goals (SDGs). Having used the framework internally since 2018, Robeco&#39;s decision to make their SDG framework open access not only establishes Robeco as a leader in that space. Access to this framework can help less experienced investors incorporate sustainability into their investment decisions.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Delegitimizing certain business activities&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;A third tactic for field building is to delegitimize business activities that are particularly harmful for the environment and society. Companies can only operate in fields in which key stakeholders — such as policymakers, consumers, suppliers, or the media — see their activities as legitimate. If these stakeholders start to see certain business activities as illegitimate, it can create existential problems for companies. Given these dynamics, investors that publicly problematize certain business activities can play a key role in changing widely shared assumptions about whether these business activities are legitimate or not.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Investors within the fossil fuel divestment movement have used this tactic very successfully. Since 2012, over 1,500 investors have publicly announced they would divest from fossil fuel companies, including the city of Chicago in 2022 and the Church of England in 2023. Proponents of the divestment movement make clear that, “&lt;a href=&quot;https://eur03.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgofossilfree.org%2Fusa%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2015%2F03%2FFossilFreeFrequentlyAskedQuestions.pdf&amp;amp;data=05%7C01%7Cmarti%40rsm.nl%7C5617faa4f4e6474822f608dbae59fdb1%7C715902d6f63e4b8d929b4bb170bad492%7C0%7C0%7C638295474207071901%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=AQBOvhTOgqMHpVyU1VprefUIR%2Foa%2BwCWQxS8Ns1s31g%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0&quot;>;Divestment isn&#39;t primarily an economic strategy, but a moral and political one&lt;/a>;.” They realize that their main influence does not come from increasing the cost of capital of fossil fuel companies in the short term, but by gradually changing public opinion about fossil fuel companies. Research shows that the divestment movement has influenced the views and actions of important stakeholders, including banks that have withheld credit from fossil fuel companies and students who have committed to not work for fossil fuel companies.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Establishing voluntary standards&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;A fourth tactic for field building is to establish voluntary sustainability standards. Voluntary standards have become a central instrument to advance corporate sustainability. They include codes of conduct, certification standards, and reporting standards, and may focus on single fields (eg, Equator Principles for project financing) or multiple fields (eg, the GRI reporting standard). Investors have played a major role in establishing voluntary standards, and have thereby reshaped the rules of the fields in which companies operate.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Investors that are active in the “Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures” have employed this tactic. Biodiversity loss and other nature-related risks are complex challenges, and many companies have little expertise on how to address them. Since 2020, investors have used the Taskforce to develop voluntary standards for corporate reporting on how companies harm nature and how nature creates risks for companies. After extensive stakeholder dialogue, pilot testing, and industry feedback, the Taskforce will release its final version in September 2023, which we expect will transform the nature-related parts of sustainability reporting.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Supporting regulatory changes&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;The fifth and final tactic for field building is to support regulatory changes that set mandatory standards for corporate sustainability. Once multiple companies within a field voluntarily engage in a sustainability-related activity, and thereby prove that such activities are technically and financially viable, regulatory interventions may be necessary to force laggard companies to follow suit. Following this logic, the number of laws related to corporate sustainability has &lt;a href=&quot;https://eur03.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.unpri.org%2Fpolicy%2Fregulation-database&amp;amp;data=05%7C01%7Cmarti%40rsm.nl%7C5617faa4f4e6474822f608dbae59fdb1%7C715902d6f63e4b8d929b4bb170bad492%7C0%7C0%7C638295474207071901%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=ZU3kycbEnn1GGmNwOIEHqUZNY11kMLAbEez1q7CfgcM%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0&quot;>;almost tripled between 2013 and 2023&lt;/a>;, from around 300 to almost 900. Given their investments in different types of companies, investors can provide valuable insights to policymakers and regulators about regulatory changes that seek to advance corporate sustainability.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some investors have used this tactic to shape the upcoming European Sustainability Reporting Standards, which will be mandatory for all companies operating in the European Union from 2028 onwards. While the April 2022 draft of this law contained strict disclosure requirements, the number of disclosure requirements were weakened in a subsequent draft due to pushback from companies. In February 2023, eleven investors and several sustainable investing industry associations wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;https://eur03.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdp.net%2Fen%2Farticles%2Fcompanies%2F60-companies-and-investors-worth-651bn-tell-eu-to-agree-ambitious-sustainability-reporting-standards&amp;amp;data=05%7C01%7Cmarti%40rsm.nl%7C5617faa4f4e6474822f608dbae59fdb1%7C715902d6f63e4b8d929b4bb170bad492%7C0%7C0%7C638295474207071901%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=dR4a7ipqlhcBhrCvxZCvnS4Td9USAyRarHM%2FEP%2FZJq8%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0&quot;>;public letter&lt;/a>; to policymakers of the European Union in which they urged policymakers to go back to strict disclosure requirement to “ensure a level playing field… for companies that already contribute to a nature-positive economy.”&lt;/p>; &lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;. 。 .&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Each of the five tactics can change the fields in which companies operate, thereby creating additional pressure for companies to become more sustainable. Despite these opportunities for increasing their impact, two reasons may deter investors from venturing into field building.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One reason is profitability. It can be difficult to make a business case for field building over the short term. Field building mostly generates costs for an investor, while benefits will be captured by other investors, including those in the future. Yet, given that many individuals are willing to accept lower returns if their investments create greater impact, they may seek out asset managers that engage in field building even if higher management fees slightly lower their returns.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another reason is political exposure. Field building requires that asset managers publicly take a stance on sustainability issues, which could lead to backlash by people with different views — a risk that is higher among asset managers that cater to a wide range of customers. These asset managers can limit this risk by doing field building on sustainability issues for which a broad consensus exists among their customers and that are backed by a strong business case.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;By broadening their toolbox of tactics, and mastering field building, investors can better position themselves to have a more positive impact on the environment and society — and, in doing so, attract more individual investors that care about impact.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 15 Sep 2023 23:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[How to Get Honest and Substantive Feedback from Your Customers]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/09/how-to-get-honest-and-substantive-feedback-from-your-customers]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/09/Sept23_15_1433543803-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;SvetaZi/Getty Images&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;Businesses can&amp;#8217;t improve operations without honest and substantive feedback. Customers can be reluctant to provide it, for several reasons. Companies can try to overcome this by focusing feedback requests on improvement (not employee assessment), focusing on customer actions instead of words, and approaching the gathering of feedback as a habit rather than an occasional effort.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/how-to-get-honest-and-substantive-feedback-from-your-customers?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/how-to-get-honest-and-substantive-feedback-from-your-customers?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;“How&#39;s everything so far?”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Fine, thank you.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In restaurants around the world, the “check-in dance” between servers and customers is pervasive. Servers ask how things are after customers receive their meal, and nearly all patrons reflexively respond with an automatic “fine, thanks.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the surface, it seems like the start of a feedback loop, but real feedback rarely materializes. Chances are the server isn&#39;t seeking a detailed critique, like whether the fish skin was crispy enough or the vegetables were over-seasoned. They&#39;re ensuring the meal is acceptable so that the dining process moves forward. Similarly, the diner often sidesteps genuine, constructive feedback, opting to maintain social etiquette and avoid a long interaction.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Both sides lose in this dance of niceties. The restaurant loses the opportunity to identify operational shortcomings, improve its product, and grow its reputation and customer base. The diner loses the opportunity to feel thrilled with the experience they receive and even — potentially — to be emotionally invested in the business.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Recently, one of us (Steve) and his wife, Michelle, were met with a different version of the dance at an upscale Brooklyn pop-up. The chef personally introduced a dish with the intention of combining several “luxury” ingredients. The dish just didn&#39;t work — at all. Michelle and Steve picked at it politely. But the dance departed from the typical choreography when instead of a server stopping by, the chef came out and asked a more pointed question, making it clear that he wasn&#39;t looking for politeness. “I&#39;ve been tinkering with that dish for a while and know it has a lot of elements, but does it &lt;em>;come together&lt;/em>; for you? I can&#39;t get better if I don&#39;t hear honest feedback.” The sincerity and sense of safety that the chef brought to the conversation allowed the diners to share that the dish just didn&#39;t work for them. It also made Steve and Michelle more engaged and interested in the restaurant&#39;s success, and they returned several weeks later to see that the dish had been adjusted and improved.&lt;/p>; &lt;article-promo>; &lt;hbr-component type=&quot;promo&quot; is-insight=&quot;insight-center&quot; title=&quot;The New Age of Operations&quot; dek=&quot;Improving efficiency and increasing resilience.&quot; cta-text=&quot;&quot; href=&quot;/insight-center/the-new-age-of-operations&quot;>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/insight-center/the-new-age-of-operations&quot; style=&quot;color:black;text-decoration:none&quot;>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; Insight Center Collection &lt;/div>; &lt;h3>;The New Age of Operations&lt;/h3>; &lt;div>; Improving efficiency and increasing resilience. &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hbr-component>; &lt;/article-promo>; &lt;p>;Many businesses have lost sight of this foundational operating principle and treat their customer feedback machine as a necessary evil to be fulfilled in the least-costly and least-awkward way possible. Smaller companies, which tend to be pressed for resources, may put little effort into trying to get customer feedback. Managers at small and medium-sized companies may feel like a robust customer feedback mechanism is a luxury that must wait until the company is larger.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;That&#39;s short-sighted, because true operational effectiveness comes from tweaking things that need to be changed &lt;em>;from a customer&#39;s vantage point&lt;/em>;. While obtaining feedback is crucial, it is only valuable if it&#39;s authentic. The challenge is that customers often shy away from such conversations, and businesses, unfortunately, tend to reinforce this reluctance in their approach to seeking feedback. The whole system has become so encumbered and obfuscated from its original purpose that in most circumstances it has become a useless ritual — one that may even destroy value.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Fixing the Problem&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;The fault with this dysfunctional feedback loop lies with both companies and customers. Companies have designed feedback systems aimed primarily for ease of customer input and quantification, leading to the innumerable requests we get to “please stay on the line to take a short survey after this call.” The last thing most customers want to do after phoning in to customer service is spend &lt;em>;more&lt;/em>; time on the phone. On the rare occasions when customers try to provide honest feedback in person, they are often met with defensive postures from staff members who are trained to “defuse” the situation instead of digging deeper for actionable feedback. In fact, often the best way to defuse the situation is to show a legitimate interest in hearing about the feedback!&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Customers also contribute to this problem. Humans are risk and conflict averse, so we generally try to avoid “high-stakes” interactions. The first step to fixing feedback systems is to understand why customers perceive them this way:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Honest feedback feels like a cognitive burden&lt;em>;.&lt;/em>;&lt;/strong>; Most of us avoid difficult and emotional conversations because they are, well, difficult. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gse.harvard.edu/ideas/news/13/11/remembering-professor-chris-argyris&quot;>;Chris Argyris&lt;/a>;, the late founder of the body of work called &lt;a href=&quot;https://thesystemsthinker.com/overcoming-defensive-routines-in-the-workplace/&quot;>;&lt;em>;productive interactions&lt;/em>;&lt;/a>;&lt;em>;, &lt;/em>;noted that there are three strategies people can use in situations of conflict: (1) &lt;em>;Bypass&lt;/em>; &lt;em>;— &lt;/em>;avoid discussing the issue and move on; (2) &lt;em>;Name&lt;/em>; — note the problem, but don&#39;t discuss it; and (3) &lt;em>;Engage&lt;/em>; — actually discuss the problem. The risk to the relationship is higher as you move up that scale, so people tend to employ &lt;em>;bypass &lt;/em>;in most situations. In the case of customer feedback, bypassing is saying things are fine, even if they are not.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;The consequences of feedback feel unnecessarily high. &lt;/strong>;This is especially true when the forum is one of many online public review sites. One of us (Elizabeth) recently found herself debating whether she wanted to write an honest review of a small business — one she was rooting for to succeed. It had a great product, but sub-par service. But an honest review would have the unintended effect of publicizing the service problems, so she just passed.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Fear of retaliation. &lt;/strong>;Some customers refrain from feedback for fear of retaliation. To continue the restaurant analogy, this might entail the dreaded image of kitchen staff tainting food in some way. Indeed, we often hear stories from customers who are repeatedly disappointed in some small way by a business, but don&#39;t want to give feedback for fear that it would impact the relationship. In effect, the customer seems to value the relationship with the business more than the service or product it provides.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Feedback requests have become like white noise.&lt;/strong>; Every business asks for feedback in every interaction, creating a situation similar to an inversion of the tragedy of the commons. Instead of an individual consuming a resource at the expense of the collective, the collective is ignoring a request at the expense of the business.&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;Some might ask whether this is a problem worth solving. Don&#39;t we get enough hints at issues from today&#39;s feedback system? We would argue no. The issue is that unhappy customers often just quit. They don&#39;t give warning — they just don&#39;t come back. So the real problem to be solved is that your “formal” feedback mechanisms might be saying that everything&#39;s fine, but you might have a service issue brewing. This can result in fast downward spirals and reputation issues that are hard to recover from. Like most health issues, prevention and/or early detection are far preferable to stronger interventions once the situation has become worse.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We offer several thoughts on how to improve:&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Make improvement your goal, not assessment.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Because companies use customer feedback to assess employee performance, many of us have experienced the plea from a customer service rep to rate them a “5 out of 5,” possibly taking a positive experience and ending it in an awkward (if not downright negative) way. It&#39;s not the employee&#39;s fault — it&#39;s the system that&#39;s in use.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We suggest reframing feedback questions to make it clear that the organization is seeking to improve — not to be told it&#39;s doing well. Instead of asking “how did I do?” ask “what&#39;s one thing could I do to have served you better today?” Invite the customer to join you in a journey for a better experience. You might need to teach your people to ask good second and third questions to solicit better feedback, because a broad-based initial question may not be sufficient for some customers to generate ideas. Training them to do this will be worth the effort.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Disproportionally focus on what customers do, not what they say.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;As noted above, customers are not inclined to share their thoughts or feelings unless things are either really bad or if the interaction is framed in the right way. So instead of tracking “sentiment,” which can be misleading, track and observe customer behavior. How often are customers repeating purchases? How frequently do they come to your store or site? What do they do when they&#39;re there? In the case of a restaurant, which entrees come back half-eaten and which inspire clean plates?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Systematically capturing this behavioral feedback requires a combination of data analysis to track large groups of customers to see patterns, but also, non-statistically significant observations by your frontline employees. Is there something they&#39;re noticing customers doing that indicates dissatisfaction? For instance, employees of a coffee stand might observe customers wrapping their cups in napkins; perhaps it means that the cup is too hot to hold? By combining data on customer behavior with the power of observation, businesses can generate hypotheses on how they can continually improve the quality of their operations.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Make this a habit, not a periodic intervention.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;As noted above, service issues can fester over time, causing customers to quit without warning. Prevention in this case is curative. So switch up that bi-annual or quarterly survey instrument in favor of mechanisms that are continual and part of your culture.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Finally, if you want to take it to the next level, consider pairing experimentation with your feedback efforts. Make a small change and ask for feedback. Or make a more significant change in a small area of your business and see how customers respond. Pairing experimentation with an eye to observing customers and seeking honest input is a mechanism to continually improve your operations — as is seeing feedback as both a gift and an imperative.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;By welcoming feedback as both a precious insight and a mandate, organizations can foster a vibrant and adaptive business environment that is responsive to customer needs and preferences. Establishing a genuine and meaningful feedback loop has the potential to elevate a business&#39;s operational standards considerably. Creating a culture that encourages feedback and sees customers not as sources of approval or disapproval, but as partners who can contribute to the betterment of a company&#39;s offering, is an important way to rethink the typical, unhelpful feedback dance that exists today.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 15 Sep 2023 22:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Sustainability Is About Your Workforce, Too]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/09/sustainability-is-about-your-workforce-too]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/09/Sept23_15_1219011427.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;Javier Zayas Photography/Getty Images&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;In recent years, many companies hired chief sustainability officers and established a set of high-priority programs to reduce carbon emissions and the risk of global climate change.

The enactment of these new regulations signals a new era in which it&#39;s time to extend the concept of sustainability to include similarly critical issues with the workforce — an idea I call people sustainability.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;People sustainability takes a holistic approach to corporate human capital practices, including diversity and inclusion, well-being, employee safety, and fair pay. It raises these human capital issues to the C-suite and obliges chief human resource officers to work with chief sustainability officers on these programs. It means that your employee well-being efforts are no longer delivered piecemeal, which was ineffective no matter how well-intentioned or resourced they might be.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The EU is essentially saying that all these “HR programs” are much bigger than HR: They now fall into the category of global citizenship mandates, and companies must treat and report them as such.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;How to Integrate People Sustainability into Your Company&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;I&#39;m talking to European and US firms about how they are gearing up for the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive and developing people sustainability metrics.&amp;nbsp;Here are examples of how a few companies are approaching this:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;Heineken has developed standard measurements of human rights, fair pay, and even living conditions for all its contract workers helping it deliver beverage sales around the world.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Enterprise software leader SAP has &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.sap.com/2022/10/people-sustainability-investment-sap-research/&quot;>;coupled its industry-leading diversity program to new pay equity and sustainability initiatives&lt;/a>;. For example, the company now openly publishes all pay bands so employees can see where they are and the pay scales for all new jobs posted. In parallel, it provides hiring and workplace support for neurodivergent employees. After undertaking a progressive gender pay equity analysis, it inaugurated a very aggressive program of promotions of women into senior leadership — all long-term “people sustainability” strategies.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Financial services firm Liberty Mutual sees people sustainability as a factor in limiting the global risks of its customers, partners, and employees in the face of accelerating climate change. Chief sustainability officer Francis Hyatt, who previously served as executive vice president of enterprise talent practices, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.libertymutualgroup.com/about-lm/corporate-information/sustainability/corporate-sustainability&quot;>;oversees the integration of global climate issues&lt;/a>; in the firm&#39;s risk management approach and promotes sustainability solutions for employees, resellers, and customers. The company promotes thought-through generational and gender equality programs, and Hyatt ensures that every employee understands how their long-term safety and success is part of the company&#39;s overall sustainability strategy. In other words, this new job function unifies all the brand&#39;s existing HR work into the context of sustainability and helping the planet.&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;What links all three of these major corporations is the way each separately discovered that when you frame human capital investment in the context of sustainability, it assumes even more importance than it did before.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you see value in this approach, where should you start at your organization? Building on the European Union&#39;s new detailed CSRD reporting requirements, leaders will need to address issues ranging from greenhouse gas emissions to gender pay across their own operations, as well as that of their suppliers and business partners. You should try to ensure sustainability becomes a pillar of operations as early as possible, as the compliance clock is ticking.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The real action is to get your HR team to start working as soon as possible with their ESG colleagues to get people sustainability metrics and strategies into your business goals. To drive this, bring together a team including your heads of HR, DEI, and ESG, as well as representatives from your corporate finance and legal teams, to design your people sustainability program. You&#39;ll ultimately want to see these goals reflected in your annual report and other stakeholder communications, so that these programs are seen as a core part of company strategy.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A recent survey by PwC reveals that many CEOs anticipate &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/news-room/press-releases/2023/pwc-26th-ceo-survey.html&quot;>;climate risk will affect their cost profiles&lt;/a>; and supply chains in the next year. However, despite these challenges, 60% of the surveyed CEOs do not plan to reduce headcount, and 80% do not plan to decrease compensation, as they recognize the importance of retaining talented employees.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Data like this underlines how people sustainability has become an integral strategy for corporate growth. Investors will soon begin to measure the effectiveness of a company&#39;s well-being initiatives as a key metric of overall performance as much as its P&amp;amp;L.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;You don&#39;t have to be directly affected by Europe&#39;s new sustainability laws to see that bringing together previously disconnected efforts such as DEI, purpose, or L&amp;amp;D under the umbrella of “long-term organizational sustainability” makes a lot of sense. You might even see it as meeting the needs of the present without compromising your future: a measure of sustainability that certainly gets my support.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 15 Sep 2023 21:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[The UAW and Other Unions Must Focus More on AI and Automation in Their Negotiations]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/09/the-uaw-and-other-unions-must-focus-more-on-ai-and-automation-in-their-negotiations]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/09/Sep23_15_N_FDXbXwQmc_h4elZPxUXLU_aQYgUYwnCsM_JUJzjthZnYU_1570020988.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;HBR Staff; Frazao Studio Latino/Getty Images; Umsplash&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;In its negotiations with the Big 3 car companies, the United Auto Workers&amp;#8217; priority is maximizing pay&amp;#160; increases for its members.

The use of AI by movie and TV producers is one of the key issues that divides the sides. For example, there are concerns that computerized simulations of actors could replace the actors themselves, and writers will be relegated to refining AI-generated scripts. Resolving these issues will take time, but at least in this case, the parties have started the process before AI has become an industry mainstay.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;A Familiar Pattern&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;But other unions don&#39;t seem to be facing up to the ways technological advances will change jobs. Consider the recent deal struck by UPS and the Teamsters to increase the average annual pay for a full-time driver to about $170,000, &lt;a href=&quot;https://teamster.org/2023/07/weve-changed-the-game-teamsters-win-historic-ups-contract/&quot;>;touted&lt;/a>; as historic and a game changer by the trade union.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The agreement has achieved significant pay gains for workers but fails to adequately address issues such as how to prepare employees for automation. The future may involve fewer drivers operating not behind the wheel of a truck or van but behind a console as they manage fleets of autonomous vehicles.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A recent labor deal in the ports industry indicates a similar lack of attention to tech-related challenges. In August 2023, the International Warehouse and Longshore Union &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/dockworkers-ratify-labor-deal-at-west-coast-ports-f0dc23e?mod=djemlogistics_h&quot;>;confirmed&lt;/a>; it ratified a new, six-year contract with port employers that includes a 32% pay rise and a one-time (and well-deserved) “hero bonus” for dockworkers who worked through the pandemic. Meanwhile, the automation gap between North American ports like Los Angeles and facilities in Asia and Europe, such as Singapore, Dubai, Rotterdam, and Hamburg, has become disturbingly wide. Addressing this disparity and preparing workers for an automated future should be high on the labor-relations agenda.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Auto workers also face transformative change. Their industry is turning away from fossil fuel-burning cars in favor of electric vehicles and self-driving technology. The shift requires new, modern manufacturing platforms that fully utilize automation and different skill sets. Meanwhile, United Auto Workers union members &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/business/autos/uaw-members-vote-to-authorize-potential-strike-db4dbd7a&quot;>;recently authorized&lt;/a>; strike action against Detroit automakers should an agreement on a 46% pay increase and a 32-hour work week fail to be reached this year. But other issues, notably how to prepare workers for a changing workplace, should also be central to the negotiations.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Emerging Issues&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Of particular concern across most industries is the anticipated disappearance of many entry-level jobs, as algorithms take over much of the work of young recruits in areas such as computer programming, legal research, and product assembly lines. But without these jobs, how will junior workers gain the on-the-job experience they need to climb the career ladder and become future leaders in their chosen disciplines? Where will tomorrow&#39;s senior programmers or experienced lawyers come from?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another question that needs to be addressed is how to train people to work alongside AI in the workplace.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are various models for such coworker relationships. For example, AI-generated information is passed on to human managers to make decisions. Chipmaker Intel uses this approach to improve buying decisions. Procurement managers use information such as supplier-performance assessments produced by AI systems in their decision-making. Another framework employs AI systems to perform routine work but requires humans to intervene when there is an abnormal change in the operating environment. The onset of a pandemic or a system&#39;s unexpected behavior are examples of uncommon situations that require uniquely human attributes, such as understanding the context to recognize a problem and flexibility and adaptability to solve it.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Worker representatives and employers must develop ways to embed these frameworks and others in work practices to ensure that workers can fulfill such roles and pivot as necessary as new roles emerge.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;The Case for Urgency&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Now is the time to start thinking about these issues because the transition to an AI-driven workplace will not happen overnight. We have seen this in past waves of tech-infused change. For instance, in 2003, Walmart told its top 100 suppliers that it was about to mandate the installation of RFID tags on some one billion cases per year. The technology would deliver multiple benefits such as improved inventory accuracy and fewer out-of-stock instances. Industry pundits predicted that RFID would quickly become ubiquitous in supply chains. In reality, technical glitches and the high cost of tags stalled the technology&#39;s adoption. It took another 16 years for item-level RFID to come back into fashion.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;AI&#39;s adoption rate may be more rapid, but employers and employees have time to prepare for the workplace changes it will inevitably bring. Moreover, even if many workers stay in the same jobs with the same titles in the short to medium term, their jobs will change. They will likely see more repetitive tasks delegated to automated systems and have to perform more monitoring functions.&amp;nbsp; The demand for new skills — such as the ability to use a growing array of data and to spot aberrations that might disrupt automated processes — will increase.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Today&#39;s workers need ongoing, incremental re-skilling or upskilling to maintain a stable or improving career path. Displaced workers need substantive retraining to get their next job or career. Young people entering the workforce need a foundation of skills aligned with their aptitudes and the prevailing demand for human labor.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A range of educational programs, from bite-sized, on-demand learning to mid-length skill-certification programs, is required in response to these shifting demands. Updated high school, college, and post-graduate degree programs will also be needed. Unions should demand that companies invest in their members&#39; futures.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Short-Lived Advantages&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Negotiating pay and benefits concessions will always be a high priority for trade unions and their members. Today, in the current post-pandemic period, labor shortages strengthen unions&#39; bargaining positions. However, this environment will shift as AI and automation accelerate.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The pace of change is a cause for concern. AI is advancing rapidly, so the longer labor and employer representatives take to confront worker-related issues, the more difficult it will be to address them.&amp;nbsp;Now is the time for labor unions to use their leverage — which may not last long as AI tools become better — to ensure the future of their members.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 15 Sep 2023 20:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[How Off-the-Shelf Tech Can Make Factories More Profitable]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/09/how-off-the-shelf-tech-can-make-factories-more-profitableespecially-for-smaller-companies]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/08/Sep23_09_BLeOMjOFl1Y_343457_459728.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;HBR Staff/Unsplash/Pexels&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;Too often, smaller companies are intimidated by the high costs, complexity, and long installation times that high-end smart factory systems can require. This is short-sighted. Companies can see big financial benefits by utilizing existing data and simpler technologies to reduce waste, labor costs, overhead, and utility expenses.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/how-off-the-shelf-tech-can-make-factories-more-profitableespecially-for-smaller-companies?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/how-off-the-shelf-tech-can-make-factories-more-profitableespecially-for-smaller-companies?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;It&#39;s possible to turn a factory into a smart factory much faster and cheaper than most executives think.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When many people imagine a smart factory, they envision something complicated and expensive — the kind of massive “manufacturing execution system,” or MES, that can take more than a year and millions of dollars to implement. If you&#39;re Elon Musk, you can pour money into advanced automation and robotics — and keep pouring. But you don&#39;t need to be Elon Musk. Many of the greatest benefits of intelligent manufacturing require much less time and money.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many smart factory proponents, bedazzled by technology, overlook the biggest potential sources of value creation. We&#39;ve seen this in visits to hundreds of manufacturing sites over the last five years: that most manufacturers make far too little use of readily available data. Labor hours, for instance; those numbers are collected for payroll, but rarely extracted from clock-in/out systems and analyzed to discover ways to operate more efficiently. Similarly, off-the-shelf RFID technology can trace scrap origins, and simple Internet of Things (IoT) sensors can deliver real-time insights into utility usage. The ability to see, analyze, and act on information immediately can have as much impact on factory profitability as advanced robotics, at much lower cost.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The low-tech, low-cost path to a smart factory works for companies of any size and is especially well suited to the appetites and abilities of midsized companies. Middle market executives report being &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/05/how-midsize-companies-can-make-the-most-of-disruption&quot;>;daunted by disruption, especially in technolog&lt;/a>;y. In an unpublished survey conducted by AlixPartners this summer, 55% of companies with revenues under $500 million a year said technological change is happening too fast for them to keep up; just 24% of larger companies said the same. They don&#39;t need to be scared. Instead, the middle market can be the prime beneficiary of the revolutionary democratization of the digital realm. In recent years, cloud computing platforms have brought sophisticated capabilities within reach of almost every company, and sensors and cameras that once needed to be custom-built can now be acquired and adapted inexpensively. These changes empower enterprises of all sizes with state-of-the-art tools for smart factories.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When properly designed and deployed, a smart-factory strategy can accelerate efforts to solve the worker shortage, bridge the skills gap, decarbonize operations, shorten lead times, or nearshore. The key is knowing where to begin.&lt;/p>; &lt;article-promo>; &lt;hbr-component type=&quot;promo&quot; is-insight=&quot;insight-center&quot; title=&quot;The New Age of Operations&quot; dek=&quot;Improving efficiency and increasing resilience.&quot; cta-text=&quot;&quot; href=&quot;/insight-center/the-new-age-of-operations&quot;>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/insight-center/the-new-age-of-operations&quot; style=&quot;color:black;text-decoration:none&quot;>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; Insight Center Collection &lt;/div>; &lt;h3>;The New Age of Operations&lt;/h3>; &lt;div>; Improving efficiency and increasing resilience. &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hbr-component>; &lt;/article-promo>; &lt;p>;Start by identifying the business issue you are trying to solve. Companies should focus on the factory P&amp;amp;L and identify KPIs and metrics that directly impact on it. The next step is to figure out how to apply smart-factory concepts and tools to improve performance on those specific benchmarks, which typically include overall equipment effectiveness, machine/asset utilization, productivity, and throughput.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Take, for example, a commercial bakery in the northeast United States with annual revenues of about $200 million.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The company realized $1.5 million in annual savings, which increased EBITDA by 4.8%, through targeted smart factory solutions centered on three business issues: reducing scrap and other waste, improving labor costs, and cutting energy use. The company was able to address all three issues with relatively simple technology.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A major cause of waste, for example, was baked goods that came off the line underweight (which had to be discarded) or overweight (which used more dough than necessary). By installing digital scales and sensors on the existing manufacturing line, the company caught that waste before it was (literally) baked in — reducing scrap by 25%. A homemade labor visibility and utilization dashboard provided a similar real-time view of labor presence on the factory floor, revealing that a significant number of workers were staying on after their shifts; without a real-time way to track the behavior, managers had been unable to enforce shift times; with the tool, overtime dropped 50%.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Finally, by installing IoT sensors and connecting data feed with existing systems to monitor utilities consumption, annual utilities spend was cut by 5% because, among other things, it revealed when equipment was being run unnecessarily.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What made these gains — which took less than six months — possible? In our work with manufacturers, we have identified four best practices that help make smart factory projects affordable and successful.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Make the plant&#39;s P&amp;amp;L your focus.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Most practitioners define “smart factory” in terms of software technologies (such as AI, machine learning, and warehouse management systems) or intelligent hardware (like connected devices and computer vision). Any or all of these can be part of a smart factory — but a focus on tools or technologies runs the risk of not seeing the opportunity. In our experience, an approach that defines a smart factory with the lens of plant P&amp;amp;L brings pragmatism that is required for success on the plant floor.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Identify all the cost drivers.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Most smart factory initiatives look only at the operations inside a factory&#39;s four walls — and especially at production lines themselves. A program that looks only at overall equipment effectiveness (OEE) addresses less than a quarter of the factory&#39;s full costs, which are spread out across company departments. In a typical consumer goods operation, ingredients are about 45% of cost and packaging 20%; direct labor, indirect labor, and overhead are about 10% each (each managed by different teams); and utilities account for about 5%. All of those can be sources of digitally-driven value creation.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Leverage existing plant assets.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;You don&#39;t need to replace existing equipment with a monolithic digital platform. Adding digital capabilities to existing equipment will get most of the benefits of a rebuild for less money, in less time, and with less need to fix the problems new platforms always have.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Put manufacturing leaders in charge.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;The best leaders for smart factory projects are experienced executives who combine manufacturing pragmatism with digital savvy. Too many balance sheets show write-offs for factory modernizations that didn&#39;t deliver the goods — sometimes literally. In this respect, many middle market companies have an advantage over larger rivals, in that their senior leaders are closer to operations both experientially and physically.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We have seen this combination of capabilities work time and again. A couple of years ago, we worked with a east coast metal products manufacturer in the US with roughly $100 million in revenue that was overwhelmed by orders when Covid disrupted its overseas competitors&#39; supply chains. With no time for a major factory overhaul — and no way of knowing how long the surge would continue — the company installed IoT counters and displays costing about $100 apiece on cutting machines, which allowed plant supervisors to monitor and assist operators in real time. At the same time, data from the counters was integrated with the ordering system, so that orders could be instantly fed into production scheduling, tracked, and matched with shipping, which significantly streamlined the order-taking and fulfilment process.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This example of a practical digital solution drove a doubling of production and revenue within one year without any capital investment or physical factory expansion. Two years later, though global supply chains were back to normal, the company&#39;s sales had grown another 15% because its increased efficiency made them better able to meet global prices and benefit from “buy American” policy changes.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When a company&#39;s smart factory approach is laid out according to business priorities and leaders look for the simplest solution, inexpensive, quick-strike tactics can improve yield and quality, boost productivity of both labor and machinery, deliver savings in energy and materials used, reduce receive-store-pick-pack-ship lead times, and more.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Moves like these are a better fit for the &lt;a href=&quot;/2021/03/bridging-the-gap-between-capital-providers-and-midsize-companies&quot;>;capital constraints&lt;/a>; midsized and smaller manufacturers face. They deliver results faster and fit with the ability of midsized companies to move quickly, unencumbered by corporate bureaucracy.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;And they provide something else. Big multinationals — with many divisions and factories in many locations — are better able to set up pilot projects, experiments, or Skunk Works. They can try, fail, learn, and adapt with less danger than a company that has just one or two plants and P&amp;amp;Ls.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A low-tech, low-cost approach to smart factories provides middle market companies with low-risk gains while at the same time providing valuable learning and experience — for executives, managers, and production workers — that can pave the way to bigger, more technologically-advanced investments later.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 14 Sep 2023 22:25:02 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
