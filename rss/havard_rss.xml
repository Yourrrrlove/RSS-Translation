&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/10/the -business-case-for-love?language=es&quot;>;阅读西班牙语&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/10/the-business-case-for-love?language=pt&quot;>;阅读em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;人工智能火车在铁轨上疾驰，让我们害怕，让我们兴奋，还发出一阵喧闹声。它可以写诗、检测气候变化的天气模式以及准翻译鲸鱼的歌曲。皮尤有 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2023/07/26/which-us-workers-are-more-expose-to-ai-on-their-jobs/&quot; >;预测&lt;/a>;近五分之一的美国工人从事的工作极有可能被人工智能改变。它是一个游戏规则改变者。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但人工智能并不是商业中最强大的力量——绝对不是。在快速生成模式方面，人工智能是无与伦比的。当谈到驱动客户和员工的行为时，人工智能是无用的。而且永远都是这样。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我的职业生涯一直在研究卓越，早在 1990 年就开始了盖洛普对华特迪士尼世界最优秀管家的研究。我一直在寻找世界上最优秀的经理、领导者、教师和销售人员的共同点，并且研究了是什么推动了最敬业的团队和最忠诚的客户。在数千个这样的定性焦点小组和访谈中，有一种力量最有力地驱动客户和员工的行为。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这种力量就是爱。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我们回避这个词，依赖于相反，使用更适合企业的短语，例如“员工敬业度”或“客户忠诚度”。我们很乐意谈论“关怀文化”或“热情服务”或“客户满意度”。但我们避开了爱。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;今天，企业界的大部分人都被人工智能的前景所迷惑和分心，是时候审视爱了，这是所有感情中最人性化的。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在我与数十万高绩效员工的对话中，他们都谈到了工作中他们喜欢的特定时刻或活动。他们不会说“喜欢”或“享受”。他们说“爱”。当他们说“爱”时，这意味着他们想继续回到这项活动并寻找机会做更多的事情。当他们从事自己喜欢的活动时，他们的工作会更加流畅，压力也会更小。我的&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.loveandwork.org/&quot;>;研究&lt;/a>;表明，在自己所做的事情中找到热爱的员工更有可能留在自己的工作岗位上，并宣传自己的公司一个很棒的地方。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这同样适用于客户。我认识一位电影制片厂高管，他说，当他对最新电影进行试镜时，他听到的不是“我真的很喜欢”或“我认为这很棒”。他只注意有多少次听到有人自发地说：“我喜欢它！”因为只有这样，他才能确定这个人会告诉其他人去看电影——甚至自己会回去看多次。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;对于所有产品的所有客户来说都是如此。只有当你成功地做到了如此引人注目、如此深刻、如此真诚、如此感人的事情时，客户才会说：“我喜欢这种体验！”您能够预测他们随后的行为。与此形成鲜明对比的是，“喜欢”或“真正享受”或“满意”实际上并不能告诉我们任何有关一个人未来行为的信息。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;用数字衡量爱情&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;我们可以在数据中定量地看到这一点。让顾客、员工或电影观众对他们的体验的某些方面进行评分，评分范围为 1-5，其中 5 分表示非常积极。传统观点认为，这些感受会驱动人们的行为，例如客户的忠诚度、拥护度和支出，或者员工的生产力、质量和保留率。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;传统观点还认为，体验被评为 3 驱动力4 号人的这些期望行为略少，而 4 号人的驾驶量也比 5 号人稍少。正是这种想法导致我们将 4 分和 5 分归为“前两名”评分，或“好评百分比”分数，然后让我们的团队集中精力，努力将尽可能多的人纳入这一类别 -实际上，将 2 移至 3，并将 3 移至 4/5 类别。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;不幸的是，这种想法没有得到数据支持。从 2 到 3、从 3 到 4 对期望的客户或员工行为几乎没有什么推动作用 - 从 2 到 3 到 4 的界限也可能是平坦的。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;只有当员工或客户评价他们的体验时才会这样做作为一个极端的积极因素——5——我们看到人们对某种经历的感受与其随后的行为之间的联系。从这个意义上说，4 比 5 更像 3。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;从该数据可以得出两个结论。首先，任何有效的领导者都不应该在员工或客户调查中取得“前两名”的分数。这是将苹果与橙子混为一谈，从而模糊了员工或客户的真实情况。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这也意味着 5 分（那些对自己的体验评价非常积极的人）不仅仅是向前迈出了一步从 4 开始。它们完全是另一回事。当有人自发地使用“爱”这个词来描述他们的经历时，这不仅仅是“很多很多的喜欢”，或者“关怀达到11”，或者“超级热情”。导致某人说“我&lt;em>;喜欢&lt;/em>;”的感觉完全属于不同的类别。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;因此，想要推动员工和客户高效行为的领导者必须深入审视这个“爱”范畴。只有认真对待“爱”作为一种独立且独特的体验，领导者才能定义如何让人们感受到它。一旦他们定义了它，他们将能够有意地将其设计到员工和客户体验的各个方面。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;是什么让一个人说“我喜欢那个！”&lt;/strong >;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;在过去的四分之一个世纪里，我对 5 进行了数十万次采访和调查。如果你今天问我：当人们说他们“喜欢”某样东西时，他们真正的意思是什么？我会给你这样的定义：&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;em>;爱是&lt;/em>; &lt;em>;对人类繁荣的深刻而坚定的承诺&lt;/em>;。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这这是一种深刻的感受，但你可以在人们对看似肤浅的经历的描述中找到它。当你说：“我喜欢那部电影！”你使用“爱”这个词并不是对你觉得有趣的事情的粗心夸大。我的采访显示，你选择“爱”这个词是因为电影中的某些东西让你感动，让你感觉自己更强大，与他人联系更紧密，更多的你，更多的人看到，甚至更聪明。你喜欢它，因为它触动了你。以某种可识别的方式，这部电影帮助你蓬勃发展。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当你说你“喜欢”做某项活动时，我的研究发现你致力于这个词，因为当你做这项活动时，你会觉得与自己融为一体，轻松自在，掌控一切，全神贯注于自己正在做的事情。你正在蓬勃发展。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当你说你爱这位老师，或者这位医生，或者这个团队，或者这个经理，那是因为，通过显性和隐性的信号，你已经得出这样的结论：他们深深地爱着他们。并坚定不移地致力于帮助您蓬勃发展。他们不认为你是“人数”。他们看到&lt;em>;你&lt;/em>;。当你感受到这一点时，你就会感受到爱。你可以根据自己的感受来称呼它。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这个定义揭示了为什么人工智能解决方案总是不那么可爱。无论他们处理多少数据，或者他们的大型语言模型有多大，我们都知道这个算法并不真正希望我们蓬勃发展。它甚至不知道什么是繁荣。它永远不可能，也永远不会。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;如何设计爱&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;在人工智能时代，最优秀的人才将希望为以下组织工作：承诺在所做的一切事情上充满爱心。这并不意味着这些组织会软弱或无精打采——严厉的爱仍然是爱。这意味着最优秀的人才将对组织是否充满爱心地做事非常敏感，而不仅仅是高效或具有成本效益。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;同样，最挑剔的客户只会忠诚于组织那些有意将爱融入每个接触点的公司。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;为了将爱融入其中，我们可以首先对“爱”和“不爱”做出清晰的区分。注意：在下面的示例中，我将挑选出特定的接触点来帮助您区分爱与不爱。我提到这些接触点并不一定意味着整个公司是有爱心的还是没有爱心的。充满爱心的公司一次建立一个接触点。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;充满爱心的公司告诉员工和客户它代表什么，并且不害怕采取行动来强化其道德立场。 Chick-Fil-A 拒绝周日营业是&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.chick-fil-a.com/about/who-we-are&quot;>;其价值观&lt;/a>;的明确信号 —它希望员工每周至少有一天在社区中与家人团聚，除了他们认为这是正确的事情之外，没有任何良好的商业原因。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;另一个例子是 In-n- Out Burger 致力于只为顾客提供最新鲜的食物。几年前，当我问公司高管为什么他们不提供早餐时，他们告诉我，他们知道自己无法保持食材足够新鲜，无法兑现对顾客的承诺。所以，没有早餐。对新鲜度的承诺也是 In-n-Out Burger 的得来速窗户直接通向厨房的原因。顾客可以看到货架上摆满了新鲜的土豆、西红柿和生菜，而其他快餐店却隐藏了“香肠”的制作过程。该公司以一种充满爱的方式设计了他们的客户产品和体验，这表明了其对其价值观和客户繁荣的承诺。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;相比之下，没有爱心的公司是不道德的和交易性的，总是并且只评估如何最大化利润或收入。例如，达美航空最近对其常旅客计划的改变就很不受欢迎。达美航空过去常常通过更便宜的机票和升舱来奖励最忠实的客户。根据新规定，乘客在达美航空的信誉不再取决于他们乘坐飞机的频率，而是更多地取决于他们在达美信用卡上的消费金额——它现在是一项常客计划。这种变化在纯粹的交易世界中是有意义的。但这会让乘客混淆达美航空的身份，让他们迷失方向——这对你所服务的人来说是一件没有爱心的事情。也许是意识到了这一点，达美航空首席执行官最近宣布计划&lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/article/delta-loyalty-program-frequent-flyers-24d9620b38fd6493e6b85d52b95bf7f1&quot;>;回滚其中一些更改&lt;/a>;。&lt; /p>; &lt;p>;充满爱心的公司对其语言深思熟虑。例如，家得宝将其总部称为“商店支持中心”，以强化其对每天为客户提供服务的地点的承诺。第一资本的代理人介绍自己的名字、实际位置，并承诺“今天我将成为你的顾问”。通过这样做，他们不仅向您（客户）个性化自己，而且还提醒您他们打算如何在通话中为您提供服务。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这与那些通过事务性绰号“全职当量”或 FTE。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;充满爱心的公司围绕小团队设计工作，因为只有当团队领导者和团队成员频繁关注时，人类才能蓬勃发展。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这家不友善的公司设计围绕资产负债表上有意义的事情进行。经理与直接下属比例为 1 比 70 的呼叫中心并不受欢迎。可悲且讽刺的是，医院也是如此。正如一个大型医疗保健系统的 CHRO 与我分享的那样，他们的护士主管与护士的比例也是 1 比 70。按照这些比例，我们出现如此倦怠危机和护理短缺就不足为奇了。这就好像医院对护士在工作中需要什么来获得营养视而不见。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这家充满爱心的公司拥有强大的校友计划。毕竟，如果友善地对待你的员工就是坚定不移地致力于他们的繁荣，那么即使在这个人离开后，这种承诺也会持续存在。没有爱心的公司将每个人仅仅视为达到目的的手段，因此，一旦员工离开，就好像他们从未存在过一样。他们的名字很少在会议上被提及，他们的贡献，无论他们可能是什么，很快就会被纳入更广泛的公司的努力之下。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;有爱心的公司不会使用绩效评级，因为他们看到每个员工不仅仅是一个数字。他们也没有高潜力计划，因为他们相信每个工人都有学习和成长的空间，因此机会和优势不应该保留给少数有“潜力”的人。&lt;/p>; &lt; p>;这家充满爱心的公司非常注重转变。例如，一些有远见的医院最近采取的一项爱心举措是设立住院医生角色。这是您入院时指派给您的医生，他的工作有双重：首先向您解释其他医疗专家正在为您做什么以及为什么这样做，其次向您解释您的需求、恐惧和常规。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在没有爱心的医院里，你被从一名护士移交给另一名护士、一名医生、另一名医生、一名管理人员，并且必须重新向他们解释自己。每一个。在没有爱心的医院里，你感觉自己只剩下症状——你就是 302 房间的胆囊。&lt;/p>; &lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;。 。 .&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;爱是最有力地驱动客户和员工行为的力量 - 奇怪的是，当今的企业并不重视它。他们不研究它。他们甚至没有释放它的策略。对于传统的大多数人来说，这是多么遗憾的事，而对于明智的少数商界领袖来说，这是多么巨大的机会。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;谁不想被热情地招募呢？还是深情地入住酒店？或者亲切地提供金融服务？谁不想享受一顿充满爱的外出就餐、作为乘客的一次充满爱的飞行体验、以及得到精心处理的保险索赔？我们都会的。正如数据显示的那样，如果我们获得更多充满爱的体验，我们的行为就会更加高效——员工表现出更高的绩效，客户表现出更高的忠诚度，并且两者都会成为您品牌的拥护者。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;人工智能机车几乎肯定会从我们的生活中分流爱情。人工智能可以大规模模仿，但它永远不会致力于帮助任何一个人类繁荣发展。我们希望人工智能能够被高效、无害地部署。但由于它对我们的立场是不道德的，因此它永远无法被善意地运用。&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- 引用 -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 12 Oct 2023 21:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[5 Types of Manipulators at Work]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/10/5-types-of-manipulators-at-work]]><description> &lt;div>;

&lt;p>;莎拉是一位科技会议主席，她需要为她的活动再预订一位发言人。一位营销专家要求提供这个位置。他说他曾与亚马逊、PayPal、Stripe 和其他主要品牌合作过。他还提到了一个“科技股”非营利组织的名字，称他希望为边缘群体的创始人提供帮助。莎拉印象深刻，给他预订了。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但在他讲话几分钟后，她就后悔了。这位专家没有向观众提供任何营销建议。相反，他向他们推销自己的服务。他甚至提供了“特别的一次性折扣”，一位与会者称这是“令人畏缩”的举动。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;失败后，莎拉更详细地研究了这位专家，看看她错过了他的哪些方面。她了解到，他的客户实际上是亚马逊、PayPal、Stripe 等公司的现任或前任员工，而不是他所代表的公司本身。她也找不到他参与他声称支持的事业的任何历史。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;看起来莎拉的专家不真实地将自己与他知道会给她留下深刻印象的品牌名称和事业联系在一起，选择了 &lt;他们对自己的可信度。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当某人的推销严重依赖于他们的联想时，请审查他们的真实性。询问有关这些关系的问题。这个人与这些人或品牌到底有什么联系？他们是否在这些事业上投入了时间？他们采取了哪些行动来践行他们声称持有的价值观？&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;2.他们利用共同的威胁来赢得您的信任。&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;虽然我们经常因共同利益而与人建立联系，但我们往往会立即喜欢的人是那些&lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary .wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1475-6811.2006.00109.x&quot;>;分享我们的&lt;em>;负面&lt;/em>;意见&lt;/a>;。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;与格温有同样挫败感的人与首席财务官合作更有可能说服她接受他们的建议。与本一样担心这笔交易会伤害他们的人更有可能赢得他的信任。共同的负面情绪可以使人们团结起来，但它也可以帮助操纵者使人们与他们的议程保持一致。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;仔细审查任何引发共同敌人或共同威胁以建立融洽关系的宣传。如果有人谈论你们对灾难性结果或即将发生的事件的恐惧，或者如果他们声称分享你对某个人、情况或品牌的愤怒——请注意。他们如何利用这一共同威胁很重要。他们提到它是因为这是他们想要解决的真正问题吗？或者，这种共同的威胁除了帮助他们与你建立联系之外没有其他任何目的吗？如果有人煽动你的愤怒或恐惧只是为了表明你的志同道合，他们会促使你接受他们接下来所说的一切。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;最终，没有必要怀疑每个与你有同样恐惧的人。但您正在考虑的产品或计划应该因其提供的功能而引人注目，而不是其所反对的内容。&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;3.他们伪造了市场验证。&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;在品牌合作伙伴关系未能推动销售后，营销主管乔丹重新阅读了合作伙伴品牌的案例研究，以调查出了什么问题。他注意到他之前错过的一些奇怪的事情：案例研究是假设的，没有提及实际客户的名字。该品牌还拥有大量社交媒体受众，但参与度较低，这表明可能存在“机器人”追随者。事实证明，该品牌网站上的媒体徽标代表的是付费广告，而不是文章或新闻。乔丹开始认为该品牌伪造了他们的受众规模，甚至可能还伪造了他们过去的作品。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;伪造市场验证对于操纵者来说是轻而易举的事情。他们明白，强大的观众的出现会激发我们寻求同伴认可和归属感的本能。他们指望我们从表面上看这些指标。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;用外表来代替现实是很诱人的。但请花点时间询问能够揭示受众规模和情绪的市场洞察来源。 NPS 分数、使用统计数据、网络分析和社交参与度等量化数据比关注者数量更能直接表明情绪。获取参考文献和案例研究主题的名称，并询问模糊的启发式信息，例如网站上的媒体徽标。&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;4.他们试图抹黑竞争对手。&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;迈克尔是一家营养饮料品牌的销售总监，他希望与当地经销商合作。但竞争品牌也是如此——只有其中一个能够赢得独家协议。于是迈克尔发起了战斗：他告诉经销商，选择其他品牌将是一个冒险的选择。迈克尔表示，他们的产品在营养科学界并不可信，许多人认为它“不安全”。迈克尔暗示，与他们合作会损害经销商的声誉，甚至可能带来责任。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;批评竞争产品的质量或适合度并没有什么不妥的。但试图通过将它们描绘成有污点的、非法的或禁忌的来抹黑它们是一种操纵策略，它让人们担心如果他们敢于做出错误的选择，就会受到关联的耻辱。在迈克尔的案例中，他援引了社会最大的耻辱之一来抹黑他的竞争对手：无视安全。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;如果你有一种令人不安的感觉，即一个向你推销某物的人想要抹黑或污蔑竞争对手的选择，那么你就会感到不安。首先需要从特征中解析事实。深入研究“人们的想法”或“社区相信”的说法，找出&lt;em>;谁&lt;/em>;实际上说了&lt;em>;什么&lt;/em>;。他们的具体用词是什么？他们是否使用了“不安全”这个词，或者这是一种表征？不同的利益相关者如何解释来自来源的信息，他们有什么动机？&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;如果您得出结论，这些特征毕竟有优点，请采取下一步。评估推介的好处，而不考虑其他选择。拒绝错误的二分法，即仅仅因为选项 A 不好，选项 B 就一定是好的。&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;5.他们分而治之。&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;凯德是一位雄心勃勃的物流经理，但他并没有得到同事的充分信任，因为他似乎总是渴望更多的权威。他请求副总裁允许组建并主持一个监管监督委员会。该委员会表面上会保护公司免受事故影响，但它也会让凯德访问其他经理的私人项目日志。副总裁并不相信，但告诉凯德，如果团队的其他成员都参与其中，他会考虑这一点。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;因此，凯德向部门负责人请愿。他告诉他们，他已经得到了副总统的支持。部门领导不想惹恼别人，所以就同意了。 Then, Cade told managers that their department heads were on board — and the managers, too, reluctantly signed off. People were wary of granting oversight to Cade. But they didn&#39;t want to challenge their bosses and peers, so no one spoke up. Thus Cade showed his VP what looked like “unanimous support” from the team and received permission to form the committee that, privately, no one wanted.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This tactic of dividing and conquering is known as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.simplypsychology.org/pluralistic-ignorance.html&quot;>;pluralistic ignorance&lt;/a>;. It works by inducing a fear among group members of opposing a bad idea because they&#39;ve been (wrongly) led to believe they&#39;re alone in their opposition.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you find yourself pressured to adopt a consensus view you&#39;re unsure of, investigate whether it has actual &lt;em>;support&lt;/em>; — or just compliance. Ask colleagues what they like about the idea and how they see it helping. Watch for their tone. Are they evangelizing, or just going along? Create an opening for candid feedback by sharing your own uncertainty: “I don&#39;t know how I feel about X. Are you convinced it&#39;s the right move?” Anonymous surveys can also open the door for discussion by uncovering that team members aren&#39;t sharing their actual views.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;. 。 .&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Peer pressure manipulators don&#39;t use the strongest arguments to persuade us. They just tap into our need for approval and connection, or exploit our fear of losing standing in the group.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The good news is, we don&#39;t need to stop caring what other people think of us to resist this manipulation. We just need to spot the sleights of hand, simplistic leaps, and false assumptions that prop it up. So ask questions and test claims. Manipulation topples when you challenge its foundation. And more often than not, other people will thank you for pushing back.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 12 Oct 2023 20:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[New Technologies Arrive in Clusters.

With electrification came dynamos, generators, switch gears and power distribution system. With the printing press came the technologies to make large quantities of cheap paper and ink. Looking at these past clusters can help us understand the moment we&amp;#8217;re in now, and what the future of AI &amp;#8212; especially GenAI &amp;#8212; might really look like. For now, leaders should assess the state of their data quality and work to build organizational muscle to complete data projects. They should also look for proprietary data that they own, which can give them a competitive advantage, and beef up their change management capabilities.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/10/new-technologies-arrive-in-clusters-what-does-that-mean-for-ai?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/10/new-technologies-arrive-in-clusters-what-does-that-mean-for-ai?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;The potential — and hype — surrounding machine learning, artificial intelligence, and especially generative AI is everywhere. Some are predicting a full suite of “this changes everything” advances in all industries, for all professions, and for people in their public and private lives. This technology is unmatched at recognizing patterns in data, and its proponents argue it has the potential to be an enormous research laboratory that never stops working, a paradigm-buster that unlocks human creativity, an accelerator for human ingenuity, and a window into reality that is currently beyond reach. Sundar Pichai, of Google likens it potential to fire and electricity.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I too am genuinely excited, if somewhat more reservedly. Today, AI offers opportunities to improve productivity, which has&lt;a title=&quot;https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/08/28/the-missing-pandemic-innovation-boom&quot; href=&quot;https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/08/28/the-missing-pandemic-innovation-boom&quot;>; remained flat&lt;/a>; for a long time, and to tackle &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2023/09/13/how-scientists-are-using-artificial-intelligence&quot;>;heretofore intractable problems&lt;/a>;, such as the search for antibiotic-resistant drugs, an understanding of how proteins fold, and finding materials with properties needed to build better batteries. Impressive successes ranging from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lineate.com/blog/3-ways-amazon-uses-ai-to-make-product-recommendations&quot;>;Amazon&#39;s recommendation engine&lt;/a>;, to Callaway Golf&#39;s design of its next generation drivers, to PepsiCo&#39;s efforts to manufacture &lt;a title=&quot;https://blogs.microsoft.com/ai-for-business/pepsico-perfect-cheetos/&quot; href=&quot;https://blogs.microsoft.com/ai-for-business/pepsico-perfect-cheetos/&quot;>;more consistent Cheetos&lt;/a>; help justify the excitement.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But I also think that progress will take longer and prove far tougher than most expect, especially in commercial settings. As I&#39;ll explain, success with AI demands concerted efforts that extend far beyond the technology. Thus, they demand the full commitment of a company&#39;s most senior leadership.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is important to note that AI has generated considerable excitement in the past, quelled by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_winter#:~:text=There%20were%20two%20major%20winters,single%2Dlayer%20artificial%20neural%20networks)&quot;>;AI winters&lt;/a>; in the mid 1970s and early 1990s. And just three years ago, in 2020, &lt;em>;The Economist&lt;/em>; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.com/technology-quarterly/2020/06/11/an-understanding-of-ais-limitations-is-starting-to-sink-in&quot;>;noted&lt;/a>; that “Another full-blown winter is unlikely. But an autumnal breeze is picking up.” As one example, self-driving cars benefited from considerable investment, and always seem to be &lt;a href=&quot;https://universe.byu.edu/2016/01/15/self-driving-cars-are-just-around-the-corner/&quot;>;“just around the corner,”&lt;/a>; but &lt;a href=&quot;https://umdearborn.edu/news/why-your-first-driverless-car-decades-not-years-away&quot;>;are more probably decades away.&lt;/a>; Further, during the pandemic, when insights were are a premium, none of the hundreds of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/07/30/1030329/machine-learning-ai-failed-covid-hospital-diagnosis-pandemic/&quot;>;AI tools built to catch Covid&lt;/a>; have passed muster. Indeed, the failure rate of AI projects appears to be &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2023/04/10/why-most-machine-learning-applications-fail-to-deploy/?sh=6dee0b08736d&quot;>;north of 80%&lt;/a>;. Finally, a recent study by Meta (formerly Facebook) researchers under controlled conditions suggest that large language models don&#39;t get the facts right &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.10168.pdf&quot;>;two-thirds of the time&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Still, I&#39;m less concerned about the technology per se and more concerned about the other advances that must accompany AI. For history suggests it takes wide range of related technologies, organizational innovations, and accommodations between the new technologies and society for any new technology to flower. I&#39;ll use electrification and the printing press to illustrate these points, then explore how they apply to AI.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As the Austrian political economist Joseph Schumpeter &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ebusinessforum.gr/old/content/downloads/IstheInformationRevolutionDead&quot;>;pointed out&lt;/a>;, successful technologies tend to arrive in clusters. With electrification came dynamos, generators, switch gears, and power-distribution systems. With the printing press came the technologies to make large quantities of cheap paper and ink. And, though not a technology per se, new materials other than the Bible and other classics were needed to fuel demand for printed materials.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A single missing component can impede the adoption of the new technology. Today, for example, the lack of enough fast-charging stations is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.com/leaders/2021/12/11/the-tricky-business-of-charging-electric-cars?utm_medium=cpc.adword.pd&amp;amp;utm_source=google&amp;amp;ppccampaignID=17210591673&amp;amp;ppcadID=&amp;amp;utm_campaign=a.22brand_pmax&amp;amp;utm_content=conversion.direct-response.anonymous&amp;amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwx5qoBhDyARIsAPbMagCl_gWXBuyeFVRJoNK_eIISY6YEQW5LjFFp3SrF2o1C8jTc-M6JfDAaAl26EALw_wcB&amp;amp;gclsrc=aw.ds&quot;>;slowing the advance of electric cars&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Next, new technologies require new organizational capabilities. While the benefits of electricity and electric motors were easy to see, they required that factories be redesigned. It took 40 years of learning, experimentation, and investment along multiple fronts to fully electrify the factory. Similarly, it took about that long for a publishing industry, which helped match supply, demand, and price, to emerge.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sooner or later, new technologies and societies must come to accommodate one another. In the beginning, electricity was dangerous — mistakenly touching a live wire could prove fatal! Over time, standard sockets and plugs helped ease that concern. Few people could read when the printing press was invented. But as societies became increasingly literate, the benefits of the printing press grew. Looking at these past clusters can help us understand the moment we&#39;re in now, and what the future of AI might really look like.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Barriers to the Adoption of AI&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Each of these areas presents formidable barriers for the widespread adoption of AI. (In using the term artificial intelligence, or AI, I am casting a wide net, including machine learning, deep learning, computer vision, natural language processing, robotics, expert systems, fuzzy logic, and other areas of tasks typically associated with human intelligence.)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First, consider the technologies related to AI. The two most important are massive computing power and large quantities of high-quality data. Increasingly sophisticated models require more computing power, which, as predicted by Moore&#39;s Law, appears to be growing apace. Probably not fast enough for those on the leading edge, but plenty fast for most commercial uses.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The situation is more complex when it comes to “large quantities of high-quality data.” In teaching an AI to play chess, for example, researchers provided algorithm the rules and instructed it to play games against itself, obviating real-world quality issues. In contrast, poor data quality sunk IBM&#39;s Watson&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statnews.com/2017/09/05/watson-ibm-cancer/&quot;>;initial entry into health care&lt;/a>;. To further underscore the importance of high-quality data, researchers generally acknowledge that today&#39;s AI models would not be possible without the highly-curated, trusted data &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/18/magazine/wikipedia-ai-chatgpt.html?searchResultPosition=3&quot;>;scraped from Wikipedia&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;All this stands to reason: Even a technology as remarkable as AI can produce results no better than its inputs. And in most commercial settings, &lt;a href=&quot;/2017/09/only-3-of-companies-data-meets-basic-quality-standards&quot;>;quality issues&lt;/a>; resemble Watson far more closely than the pristine circumstances of chess. The &lt;a href=&quot;/2018/04/if-your-data-is-bad-your-machine-learning-tools-are-useless&quot;>;quality requirements&lt;/a>; for training, updating, and operating AI models are broad, deep, and, in some cases, poorly understood. For example, while it appears that Microsoft&#39;s Tay chatbot was well trained in normal discourse, user-generated content &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tay_(chatbot)#:~:text=Tay%20was%20an%20artificial%20intelligence,only%2016%20hours%20after%20its&quot;>;quickly taught it to mimic hate speech&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Exacerbating this, many companies&#39; data and systems architectures are increasingly messy and chaotic. This makes getting the data in shape to apply AI tools much harder, compounding quality issues.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I find this situation paradoxical. As best I can tell, everyone involved understands the importance of high-quality data. Some practitioners privately admit data is the most important part of any AI project. But companies haven&#39;t even put someone in charge, never mind sorted out the complete program they&#39;ll need to ensure they have the high-quality data they need. Perhaps, as Google researchers &lt;a href=&quot;https://research.google/pubs/pub49953/&quot;>;note&lt;/a>;, “Everyone wants to do the model work, not the data work.” But until that data work gets done, it&#39;s hard to see good models emerging and AI succeeding.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Now consider the issues associated with organizational capabilities needed to put AI to work. These may well prove as difficult as the quality issues. I find the penetration of basic, though powerful, analytical techniques broadly instructive here because both it and AI depend so heavily on data. Such tools have been around for at least two generations.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But other than basic reporting, most organization still don&#39;t use them very much or well. And these tools are far easier to understand than AI models. The unfortunate reality is that &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/06/your-data-strategy-needs-to-include-everyone&quot;>;analytics is bolted onto, rather than built into, organizations,&lt;/a>; practically guaranteeing a perpetual fight for relevance. It is hard to see a bright future for AI until this structural issue is resolved.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The second big organizational issue is that employees resist innovations that threaten their jobs. And while AI can reduce the drudgery in work, make employees more productive, and lead to a growth in employment, most are right to be concerned. After all, a drudge job beats no job when it helps feed a family. So, how will employees and AI work together? Should employees be expected to help create an AI that will replace them? To explain and or clean up training data? In situations where AI replaces them, how should they be compensated? In situations for where AI makes people more effective and/or efficient, should people receive higher compensation? There are no easy answers.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One final point regarding staff. Even as generative AI is easy to use, developing and deploying most AI requires top talent. Yet too many data scientists feel their talents are wasted. As one veteran put it, “I find that most data scientists are incredibly frustrated that they aren&#39;t having much impact.” No surprise! Finding something novel that the business actually uses and deploying a model in practice is incredibly difficult. Even worse is dealing with bureaucracy, quality issues, and the fears of those impacted by their work. Companies hoping to attract and retain top talent must address these frustrations.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Third, and lastly, consider issues of humans/society and AI coming to accommodate one another. As noted above, some believe AI will elevate humanity while others believe the AI threatens civilization. So, these issues are already generating enormous attention, though so far little agreement, on national and international levels. Though only a few companies will have much influence at those levels, most will find they have to take a stand on some, such as:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;What are the standards against which companies should compare their AIs? There are numerous reports of deaths caused by self-driving cars. But people are far from perfect drivers and their mistakes also kill lots of people. Is “zero accidents” or “fewer accidents” the objective?&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Should companies compensate individuals for providing their data? Should they pay more for data guaranteed correct?&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;How should national security issues, such as the competition between US and China impact companies&#39; plans?&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;AI is much like a “black box” — it does not give good explanations for the ways it reached its conclusions. Thus, companies should begin to think through how they will address legitimate questions such as “Why did you deny my loan?”&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;h2>;What to do?&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;This is probably a good time to take stock. Is your company fully embracing the data, organization, and societal challenges that AI requires and is your senior leadership fully committed? If so, you&#39;ve raised your chances of success. Good luck!&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Or, does the vast majority of your work focus on the technology, perhaps led by your chief analytics officer and/or your tech group? If so, ask yourself if you&#39;re up for the full range of work on the data, organization, and society/people issues needed to earn significant business results. If not, best to keep your powder dry. If so, the really hard and important work still lies ahead. You simply must get your more senior leadership invested in the effort. There is no set script for doing so.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;You must also begin work on the data and organizational issues describe above. I recommend two steps to help you get started:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;For data quality, make some measurements so you know where you stand. Then &lt;a href=&quot;/2020/02/to-improve-data-quality-start-at-the-source&quot;>;make some improvements&lt;/a>; by finding and eliminating the root causes of error.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;To build the organizational muscle you need, &lt;a href=&quot;/2019/10/most-analytics-projects-dont-require-much-data&quot;>;complete several “small data projects,”&lt;/a>; involving teams of people focused on improving their own work processes.&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;I also recommend two further steps, anticipating a decision to plunge headlong into the effort:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;Scour the company for proprietary data, stuff you have that others cannot match. This is important because you&#39;re unlikely to create sustained advantage with data your competitors can also access.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Beef up your change management capabilities. No matter what works best, putting AI to work will require massive change. Start to build the professional help you will need.&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;h2>;AI Isn&#39;t Easy&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;The hype surrounding AI makes it seem much easier than it is. Don&#39;t get sucked in! It is easy to “play” in the AI sandbox. But actually making it pay off, at scale, across the company requires serious work, top to bottom and across the company. The technology is almost certainly the most manageable of the required efforts. You also need high-quality data and some tough organizational changes, all against a backdrop of societal acceptance. AI is only for those in it for the long haul!&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 11 Oct 2023 23:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Is Your Team Caught in the Solution Fixation Trap?]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/10/is-your-team-caught-in-the-solution-fixation-trap]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/10/Oct23_11_1501194045.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;MirageC/Getty Images&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;In the face of escalating complexities, organizations are increasingly relying on teams to tackle these intricate issues and drive pivotal organizational decisions. To extract maximum value from team dynamics, leaders must remain mindful of potential biases that may impact team dynamics and to actively steer and fine-tune team processes. Specifically, the authors urge leaders to address a decision-making bias they call the solution fixation trap, which emerges when a team rushes into discussing possible solutions before fully understanding the problem at hand. The authors discuss the study that helped them uncover this bias, explain what the solution fixation trap looks like, and discuss what leaders can do to protect their teams from it.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/10/is-your-team-caught-in-the-solution-fixation-trap?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/10/is-your-team-caught-in-the-solution-fixation-trap?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;Have you ever found your team going back and forth to find a good solution to a problem and not making progress? Or maybe you&#39;ve left a meeting feeling unsure about the chosen solution, wondering if your team overlooked important information. To help your team make better decisions more confidently, you need to address a decision-making bias we call the &lt;em>;solution fixation trap&lt;/em>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The solution fixation trap emerges when a team rushes into discussing possible solutions before fully understanding the problem at hand. For example, a marketing team tasked with addressing declining sales may hurry into suggesting modifications to the existing marketing campaign without taking enough time to fully understand the root causes of the decline. Similarly, a recruitment task force responsible for enhancing the demographic diversity of job applicants may rush into suggesting new recruitment tactics without adequately analyzing possible inhibiting factors. Not only does this make it challenging for teams to arrive at solutions they feel confident about — it puts them at risk of committing to the wrong course of action.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this article, we share the study that helped us uncover this bias, explain what the solution fixation trap looks like, and discuss what you can do to protect your team from it.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Visualizing a Team&#39;s Unfolding Decision-Making Behavior&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;To better explain what the solution fixation trap looks like, we developed a method to visualize and analyze a team&#39;s decision-making behavior. When we engage with the world around us (other team members, for example), each of our behaviors (verbal or non-verbal) serves a function. For example, sharing a piece of information or asking for information are behaviors focused on information processing. Close analysis of phase maps — illustrations that highlight time periods where teams engage with behaviors with a common function — helped us answer important questions about team dynamics and unravel phenomena such as the solution fixation trap. The phase-mapping technique focuses on identifying clusters of behaviors with a common function, which we label as a phase type.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One hundred and sixty-nine MBA students participated in this study. Forming 28 teams, participants took part in a learning simulation that involved a series of problem-solving tasks. (Disclosure: The &lt;a href=&quot;https://hbsp.harvard.edu/product/7000-HTM-ENG&quot;>;Leadership and Team Simulation: Everest V2&lt;/a>;&amp;nbsp;is a product of Harvard Business Publishing.) We recorded audio and video of each team as they engaged with the simulation. Then, we transcribed team communications verbatim and assigned a code to each statement based on its function.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Prior research by scholars such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/hcr/article-abstract/15/4/549/4584138?redirectedFrom=fulltext&quot;>;Marshall Poole, Jonelle Roth&lt;/a>;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1952-03911-001&quot;>;Robert Bales&lt;/a>; suggests that behaviors of teams tasked with solving a problem can be categorized into four phase types: 1) information processing, 2) solution exploration, 3) confirmation, and 4) executive action. The below graphic shows examples of behaviors that shape each phase. As a team works on a task over time, it flows through these phases.&lt;/p>; &lt;div>; &lt;figure>; &lt;img aria-describedby=&quot;caption-attachment-364976&quot; src=&quot;/resources/images/article_assets/2023/09/W230913_SOHRAB_DECISION_MAKING_BEHAVIOR_360.png&quot; >; Information processing, shown as orange: Sharing something that others may not know, Asking for information, and Answering questions.&lt;br />; Solution exploration, green: Proposing a solution, Evaluating a proposed solution, and Expanding a proposed solution.&lt;br />; Confirmation, yellow: Asking for confirmation, and Confirming.&lt;br />; Executive action, blue: Ensuring that everyone has access to the required documents, Completing required paperwork, and Discussing guidelines about the process.&lt;br />; Unorganized period, gray: Unorganized action that does not focus on one type of behavior.The lefthand side of the bar is labeled “beginning of the task” and the righthand side is labeled “end of the task.” The lengths of each block correspond to the amount of time spent in a phase. The first block is the longest, encompassing about a third of the task bar, and indicates the information processing phase. Then two smaller blocks show a switch to the solution exploration phase and back to information processing phase, followed by the second-longest block on the task bar, which is another phase spent in solution exploration.

The team starts by discussing the available information (the first orange block). Once members feel fairly confident that everyone has had a chance to share what they know, the team switches to considering possible solutions (the green block). Then, the team returns to discussing information to better inform its decision (the second orange block) before engaging in a long discussion of potential solutions and evaluating them (the second green block). This phase is followed by the team seeking everyone&#39;s verbal confirmation (the yellow block). The team ends the task by ensuring the decision is properly recorded and documented (the blue block).&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;While this behavior may seem aligned with what most of us would expect to happen on a team when making a decision, most teams&#39; behavior trajectory actually looks more like the graphic below, with more frequent switches between phases and some unorganized periods (illustrated as gray blocks).&lt;/p>; &lt;div>; &lt;figure>; &lt;img aria-describedby=&quot;caption-attachment-364975&quot; src=&quot;/resources/images/article_assets/2023/09/W230913_SOHRAB_DECISION_MAKING_BEHAVIOR_PHASES_360.png&quot; >; &quot; title=&quot;Phase Map of a Typical Team&#39;s Decision-Making Behavior.&quot; width=&quot;360&quot; height=&quot;369&quot;>; &lt;/figure>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hbr.org/data-visuals&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;>;See more HBR charts in Data &amp;amp; Visuals &lt;i>;&lt;/i>;&lt;/a>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;/div>; &lt;h2>;The Solution Fixation Trap&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;In our research study, we examined the phase maps of 28 teams that worked on a moderately complex problem-solving task. By analyzing their interactions during the task, we were able to uncover a behavioral pattern that was a key performance indicator, distinguishing high-performing teams that found the best solution from low-performing ones that chose the worst solution. The below graphic shows the phase maps for five high-performing and five low-performing teams.&lt;/p>; &lt;div>; &lt;figure>; &lt;img aria-describedby=&quot;caption-attachment-365163&quot; src=&quot;/resources/images/article_assets/2023/09/W230913_SOHRAB_DECISION_MAKING_BEHAVIOR_TEAMS_360_V2.png&quot; >; The second group of tasks is labeled “low-performing teams.” All five task bars contain much more occurrence of solution exploration blocks, showing that Low-performing teams&#39; discussions are dominated by solution exploration and assessment rather than by gathering and analyzing the information required to arrive at a good solution.Source: Serena G. Sohrab, Mary J. Waller, Sjir Uitdewilligen.&quot; title=&quot;Comparison of Phase Maps for Five High- and Five Low-Performing Teams.&quot; width=&quot;360&quot; height=&quot;872&quot;>; &lt;/figure>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hbr.org/data-visuals&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;>;See more HBR charts in Data &amp;amp; Visuals &lt;i>;&lt;/i>;&lt;/a>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;As evident in these maps, low-performing teams&#39; discussions are dominated by solution exploration and assessment rather than by gathering and analyzing the information required to arrive at a good solution. Interestingly, both high and low performers started the task by discussing what they knew about the problem. However, shortly thereafter, low-performing teams became fixated on pitching suggestions about what they should do and began generating various solutions. Once this happened, they failed to return to information analysis for any sustained period of time.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We also found that when these low-performing teams became fixated on their solution exploration, they were less likely to seek information to answer questions that surfaced. If a team member asked, “What do we know about X?”, low performers would typically ignore the question and continue discussing potential solutions without substantiating them. This fixation on debating solutions limited the low performers&#39; ability to reveal and fully evaluate all the information available to them, which in turn led to poor decision outcomes. Interestingly, these teams that seemed to rush into debating solutions did not finish the overall task any faster than the high-performing teams.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Protecting Your Team from the Solution Fixation Trap&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;So what can managers do to prevent their teams from falling into this solution fixation trap? Here are a few easy-to-implement strategies based on our research:&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Start the meeting by reviewing all the available information.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Go around the table and encourage people to share what they know — not their opinions — about the situation or problem at hand. Once everyone has had a chance to share what they know, ask the room if they&#39;re aware of any information that was not discussed. This is essential because more than &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1046496415599068&quot;>;three decades of research&lt;/a>; offers solid evidence that information not known by all team members is significantly less likely to be mentioned during team discussions.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Be mindful of immature solution suggestions.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Meetings are hardly anyone&#39;s favorite event, as most people find them a waste of time, &lt;a href=&quot;/2017/07/stop-the-meeting-madness&quot;>;overwhelming, and even soul-sucking and painful&lt;/a>;. As a result, when you gather people into a meeting to solve a problem or make a decision, you may come across people who, consciously or unconsciously, attempt to rush the discussion and end the meeting as soon as possible. They may do this by making explicit comments about time or in more subtle ways, such as jumping to discussing possible solutions. When you notice an immature solution suggestion, label it by saying something like, “Thanks for that suggestion — let&#39;s come back to that when we&#39;re sure we&#39;ve uncovered all the relevant information.” Then, bring the discussion back to information sharing and analysis.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Encourage evidence-based decision-making throughout the process.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;When questions arise, guide the team to answer them based on the available information, not their opinion or rough guesses. You might say something like, “Sounds like we need to go back and dig into this issue a little more.”&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Use visualization tools to organize the information and solutions discussed.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Some of our other &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/job.2301&quot;>;research&lt;/a>; suggests that teams sifting through and sharing complex information can benefit significantly from the use of a collective display, such as a dry erase board or electronic whiteboard. Writing information on a shared display can certainly help tie information to possible solutions as they are discussed.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;. 。 .&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;In the face of escalating complexities confronting organizations, the reliance on teams to tackle these intricate issues and drive pivotal organizational decisions is on the rise. To extract maximum value from team dynamics, it&#39;s paramount to remain mindful of potential biases that may impact team dynamics and to actively steer and fine-tune team processes.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 11 Oct 2023 22:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[What&rsquo;s Lost When Data Systems Don&rsquo;t Communicate]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/10/whats-lost-when-data-systems-dont-communicate]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/10/Oct23_11_6551-000359-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;Raimund Koch/Getty Images&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;In every industry, many large corporations have teams that help bridge outdated, disconnected systems, and databases.

Kelly, a dedicated employee in a large hospital network, readied herself for another day of handling upset customers. As a member of the consumer relations team, she addressed escalated calls from patients who had been redirected multiple times. Her challenge for the day involved a potential Alzheimer&#39;s patient seeking a second opinion from a different hospital network. Unfortunately, this patient was informed that Kelly&#39;s network was unable to transmit medical records electronically, and instead may have to undertake a 90-minute trip to collect the records on a CD.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Amid the stress of the call, Kelly identified a synchronization problem within their internal systems as the root cause. She took the initiative, navigating across various systems, including electronic health record systems, archives, health exchanges, and health information service provider systems. Kelly manually resolved the sync issue and ensured the records were sent over, earning the patient&#39;s gratitude. This act of service, particularly meaningful because she herself had ageing parents, brought Kelly immense joy.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Every day, several super-advocates like Kelly work in hospital networks to tackle a multitude of member issues, largely stemming from processes ripe for modernization or disparate systems needing to communicate with each other. Indeed, in every industry, many large corporations have teams like this one, who help bridge outdated, disconnected systems, and databases. Without them, there is no way companies can upgrade their technology without causing disruption to their operations. This scenario, though imagined, is ubiquitous in reality across companies and industries.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The problem is that running a company on disconnected or barely patched together systems affects employees at all levels. In another case, one that is real, a Fortune 500 CFO grappled each quarter with consolidating financial data from over 70 systems across 50 subsidiaries. The team had to meticulously extract, reconcile, integrate, and validate data from these systems, a time-consuming and risky process prone to inaccuracies.&lt;/p>; &lt;article-promo>; &lt;hbr-component type=&quot;promo&quot; is-insight=&quot;insight-center&quot; title=&quot;The Future of Work&quot; dek=&quot;Will your company adapt or be left behind?&quot; cta-text=&quot;&quot; href=&quot;/insight-center/the-future-of-work&quot;>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/insight-center/the-future-of-work&quot; style=&quot;color:black;text-decoration:none&quot;>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; Insight Center Collection &lt;/div>; &lt;h3>;The Future of Work&lt;/h3>; &lt;div>; Will your company adapt or be left behind? &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hbr-component>; &lt;/article-promo>; &lt;p>;Every quarter the finance team and the IT team debated &lt;em>;the same &lt;/em>;issues: &lt;em>;Why do we have a plethora of diverse systems? Why don&#39;t these systems talk to each other? What can we do to eliminate these data silos that create more risk, delays, and effort? &lt;/em>;&lt;em>;How can we dismantle these data silos that contribute to risks, delays, and additional effort?&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Like Kelly, the finance and IT teams, and the CFO, most workers are familiar with some version of these frustrations, no matter their job, department, or industry. They spend hours moving data from one system to another, troubleshooting incompatible applications, and often accept this dysfunction as an unavoidable friction in their work. But most companies have no idea how bad the problem is, because they haven&#39;t taken the time to quantify the impact this disconnection has on business outcomes.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To understand what disconnected systems are costing companies — what we call “disconnection debt” — we measured the impact of information silos arising from disconnected systems, on business outcomes in over 100 teams across companies. Here&#39;s what companies need to know about this problem — and how they can fix it.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Disconnection Debt: The cost of disconnected systems on business&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;In an ideal world, all systems in an organization would be integrated with each other in the backend with APIs and seamlessly talk to each other. For users — that is, employees — that would mean eschewing repetitive and manual work in copying or extracting information from multiple sources. Instead, users should ideally use their experience, judgement, and training to make decisions or recommendations based on information provided by the system, which is responsible for doing the tedious work of gathering that information from multiple sources. &amp;nbsp;But this is rarely the case.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Disconnected systems exist because each system is built to meet the organization&#39;s needs at a particular point in time. But over time, as business needs and workflows evolve, there is a gap between how these systems are designed and the evolving business needs. A cloud system, for example, does not talk to a mainframe system. And today&#39;s new system is likely to be tomorrow&#39;s disconnected legacy system. When organizations accept this as an unavoidable problem, they are implicitly accepting long-term costs: inefficiency, errors, delays that customers or end consumers experience, and risks to the business in terms of risks to revenue, impediment to scaling, customer experience, churn, or loss of market share.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To bridge these gaps, all organizations tend to “throw people at the problem”: employees manually extract data from multiple systems, make decisions, and then input data back into the relevant systems. These employees, act as human adhesive between disparate systems, taking on “swivel chair” roles. This, of course, comes with cognitive and productivity costs associated with &lt;a href=&quot;/2022/08/how-much-time-and-energy-do-we-waste-toggling-between-applications&quot;>;toggling between numerous applications&lt;/a>;. But that is only one part of the overall cost. Disconnected systems give rise to information silos that impose significant manual effort and excessive delays in execution. Ultimately, these shortcomings highlight the true cost of the disconnected debt: consistent negative impact on organizational outcomes and key performance indicators, therefore exacerbating risk. Organizations pay these costs over long periods of time.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To understand just how much the drag of disconnected systems was costing companies, we studied over 103 teams engaged in over 42 processes, in over 1,000 instances, in 13 key functions across 10 Fortune 500 companies and 8 small and medium-sized businesses. We used a work graph — a digital map of how teams work in organizations — to identify where and how these costs arose, sorting them across cost, customer experience, employee experience, revenue, and risk. The companies we looked at spanned banking, retail, telecom, life science, and consumer goods. To estimate the sole impact of disconnected systems on business outcomes, we left out the toggling tax that teams pay.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We found a high variance in the impact of disconnected systems on business outcomes. In some cases, teams spent up to 60% of their working day on activities arising from such systems — extracting information from multiple systems, entering data into other systems, etc. This inefficient use of effort contributed to “disconnection debt” — costs that organizations pay in terms of poor business outcomes and key performance indicators.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The results we found across functions and teams, and their impact on business outcomes are summarized in the table below.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;!-- table start -- Disconnection Debt -- ajrp 2023 -->;&lt;/p>;

&lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>; &lt;!-- table end -- Disconnection Debt -- ajrp 2023 -->;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Regardless of the size of the company, we found that disconnection debt was responsible for slower execution, redundant manual efforts, and more errors. The end impact on business outcomes is likely range of possibilities, including, slower revenue growth, increased costs, more risk, and poorer customer and employee experience.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, in the above table, disconnected systems caused a US-based fast-moving consumer goods retailer an additional 10% delay (amounting to a few extra days) when selling $300,000,000 of its products to distribution channels each year. Similarly, over 6,000 new employees joining a F500 life sciences company experienced additional delay of four weeks in completing their onboarding formalities. Finally, in one instance, customers signing up for a new bank account experienced several days of delay in being approved. During this process, because systems in the backend were not well integrated, the organization had repeated back and forth with customers, requesting them to fill in additional forms and details. And slow internal processes that required pulling together data from multiple systems and then stitching them together. Not only did all this result in poor customer experience but also, the management was concerned that they are likely to lose prospective customers to competition, who offered a more streamlined experience for signing up. Other areas of organizations that we have not yet studied will suffer from similar costs of disconnected systems. In the few cases where teams were not suffering from disconnection debt, we found they were either performing all their work within one system or were largely involved in making decisions, based on data from one system.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;What Leaders Can Do&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;As business needs evolve, information silos arising from disconnected systems and the risk they pose to business outcomes will continue to be a reality. This issue affects all parts of an organization and creates risk to businesses. Hence, dealing with this issue needs to be on the agenda for all leaders in organizations. CEOs and risk committees on the board must set quarterly targets and metrics to actively track and mitigate risks arising from disconnected systems.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Essentially, organizations need to take a product management lifecycle approach to managing disconnected systems and always stay on top of this problem.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A thumb rule to prioritize which areas to investigate further and improve — teams in critical parts of your business that spend more than 5% of their workday extracting information from at least 2-3 disconnected systems. Hence, to get started, the first priority of leaders ought to be in gaining visibility — finding silos that may be hurting the business and mitigating their impact.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;1. Gain visibility into the existence and impact of disconnected systems on business outcomes&lt;/h3>; &lt;h3>;Find your “Kellys”:&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Find colleagues, often on the frontlines, with firsthand insights into customer frustrations caused by disconnected systems. Foster a culture where they can openly share friction points with senior leaders, generating a heatmap of customer challenges. Supplement this with social listening and direct exposure of senior leaders to distressed calls. Some companies have embraced a “&lt;a href=&quot;https://hbsp.harvard.edu/product/115006-PDF-ENG&quot;>;zero distance&lt;/a>;” approach, striving to comprehend frontline issues and systematically address them.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Create telemetry for your systems and processes:&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;With today&#39;s tools, you can map and measure system interactions, &lt;a href=&quot;/2021/12/do-you-know-how-your-teams-get-work-done&quot;>;creating a “work-graph,” a map of how your teams get work done&lt;/a>;.

Consequently, it allows for a prioritized list of the busiest breakpoints in your processes.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A combination of finding “Kellys” and the work-graph gives you a priority list to attack with short-term and long-term fixes. Overlapping breakpoints or friction points highlighted by your “Kellys” and the work-graph measurements yield priorities that you can address with conviction. Make this a weekly discipline in your company. Create metrics and targets out of this visibility that is sent all the way to your board&#39;s risk committees.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;2. Short-term fixes to buy time.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;There are short-term fixes for these problems, which function more as band-aid solutions that are susceptible to changes in the business including acquisitions, regulatory changes, process changes, etc. But they can ameliorate the situation and buy more time for long-term changes. Solutions include:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;Building single-pane applications: their sole purpose is to gather data from multiple systems and aggregate them into a single view. Hence, users will not spend effort in manually pulling data from multiple systems and instead focus on a &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/sap-lens/best-practice-1-7.html&quot;>;single application window&lt;/a>;.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Automating tasks: that pull data from multiple systems, pre-populating fields in applications, and writing data back into systems. However, this solution is temporary since it does not fix the underlying problem and may only lead to proliferating more automation solutions on top of disconnected solutions.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Leverage latest advances in computing: LLMs, among other tools, may be useful in extracting unstructured information from multiple systems, reducing manual effort, and normalizing them into a structured format.&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;These solutions shift the mechanical manual effort in extracting information from disconnected systems, from humans to software. This approach mitigates the risk of disconnectedness and buys business leaders room to fix the root issue in the underlying problem. For example, an outdated and slow system, despite the automation built on top, still slows down the overall airline booking process and customer experience.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;3. Long-term fixes.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Sustainable long-term solutions are expensive and difficult to implement. Typically, they may involve:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;Fundamentally re-engineering systems leveraging newer technology: These initiatives take 18–36 months and usually involve a larger change management effort that requires a lot of discipline.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Mandate building more APIs and adapters that are faster, more scalable, and secure. As business needs evolve and new workflows are created, these APIs and interfaces will need to be updated.&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;But these sorts of changes are not discrete events since business needs continue to evolve and hence these newly engineering systems too will soon be out of date. Hence, organizations need a strategy of constantly iterating – gaining visibility into the current impact of disconnected systems on business goals, short-term fixes to buy some time and space, and a long-term deeper fix. And to then iterate again from the beginning.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 11 Oct 2023 21:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[3 Ways to Determine What Your Customer Really Values]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/10/3-ways-to-determine-what-your-customer-really-values]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/10/Oct23_11_1219096552.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;Klaus Vedfelt/Getty Images&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;Companies often get into trouble because they make the wrong assumptions about what is valuable to stakeholders. A good way to avoid this trap is to reflect where your company sits on these three scales, which you should do in the order presented: commoditized vs. customized; rational vs. emotional; and assessable vs. unknowable.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/10/3-ways-to-determine-what-your-customer-really-values?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/10/3-ways-to-determine-what-your-customer-really-values?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;Producing value sits at the very heart of business strategy and competitive advantage. It&#39;s the reason Singapore Airlines, for example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/Airline_Review-d8729151-Reviews-Singapore-Airlines&quot;>;consistently makes it to the top airline list&lt;/a>; and why Toyota, for instance, is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/martyswant/2021/12/16/why-toyota-is-the-top-auto-brand-in-the-halo-100/?sh=7ed923e16171&quot;>;rated so highly among its peers&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But “value” is a term that is surprisingly misused and misunderstood. There are many places to trip and fall when it comes to “creating value” due to wrong assumptions about what is valuable to stakeholders. A good way to avoid this trap is to reflect where your company sits on these three scales, which you should do in the order presented.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;1. Commoditized vs. Customized&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;A few years ago, I was conducting my strategy workshop for a group of managers from different industries. I was pointing out that value is created by many factors, and I told the group that it is usually a mistake to lower prices in the push for competitive advantage because price does not equal value. Trevor, an executive from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bhp.com/&quot;>;BHP&lt;/a>;, Australia&#39;s largest mining company, piped up with: “What if you&#39;re a price taker not a price maker?”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;BHP sells iron ore, metallurgical coal, copper, and other minerals around the globe. Trevor was referring to the fact that BHP sells “commodities.” I offered my suggestions on other areas of possible differentiation, like on-time delivery and customer service. But these aren&#39;t big drivers of choice when it comes to buyers in Chinese companies. They tend to take these things for granted. Even the quality of the products isn&#39;t a differentiator as coal, iron ore, and other minerals are graded to a specification. In other words, Trevor was right, price does equal value in the eyes of a customer when all other &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/05/dialing-up-the-volume-on-strategic-innovation&quot;>;strategic factors&lt;/a>; in the purchase decision are equal, which often occurs with commodities.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But I was right, too. Many other products and services are customized rather than commoditized, and, in these cases, price doesn&#39;t equal value. Steve, for example, is CEO of a kitchen design and installation company specializing in large and expensive homes. When his inquiries dropped, he leapt to the assumption that he was “too expensive.” So, he embarked on a round of price cutting. But was cost really the issue? To find out, we assisted by interviewing some of his clients who chose a competitor. A typical example was Jenna.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She&#39;d sought three quotes for the kitchen of her large home. “They came in at different prices, naturally,” she said. “I could have bought a new car at the prices supplied.” She explained that the kitchen contractor she chose wasn&#39;t the cheapest. More important to Jenna were four other factors: innovative design (she spent a lot of time with each contractor trying to find the best design solution), work quality (recommendations from previous customers about kitchen finishes), customer service (easy to deal with and good listening skills), and quality of inclusions (the brands of dishwasher, sink and taps recommended).&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The final factor, she said, was “trust.” It was “very important because she wasn&#39;t going to be there every day checking on the installation of plumbing and electrical fittings.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Your position on the scale of commoditized vs. customized depends on how much unique value you contribute to your products, which is why you need to start with this scale. If you&#39;re in the business of supplying raw materials, it may be that you don&#39;t add much value. This means that lowering your prices is your only option to increase competitive advantage. But this is not the case for most businesses. Your “value add” can include all sorts of factors from the experience of customers with your service to the quality of your materials. These are value factors that customers are willing to pay more for.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The next scale helps you figure out what kind of value you provide.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;2. Rational vs. Emotional&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Some years ago, I was CEO of a business that made trusses and frames for houses. These were prefabricated in our factory, loaded onto trucks, and hauled to a customer&#39;s building site. We provided everything a builder needed to erect the skeleton of a house. I was charged with turning the business around from a loss to a profit. This required us to achieve a competitive advantage. So, we needed to understand fully the criteria customers employed to judge “value.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Value for builders is determined by weighing up price against other &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/05/dialing-up-the-volume-on-strategic-innovation&quot;>;strategic factors.&lt;/a>; These include product quality (the product must meet specifications and stay together during erection), delivery (being on time is important, delays cost money), and customer service (technical advice and dealing with any issues). For builders, our customers, the purchase decision was very rational, involving carefully evaluated costs and benefits.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;a href=&quot;/2015/01/when-to-sell-with-facts-and-figures-and-when-to-appeal-to-emotions&quot;>;But not all products and services add value in such a rational way&lt;/a>;. Angeline is a Product Manager of a well-known international cosmetics company. Its products are sold mainly through large retail department stores. I asked her about “value” for her consumers, the users of the cosmetics.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She replied that “the decision isn&#39;t purely rational as image is very important. Consumers become emotionally connected to a brand.” She added, “that&#39;s why we link our products to well-known celebrities.” She also pointed out that online influencers are becoming increasingly important: “They can make or break a product.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Finding your place on the rational vs. emotional scale involves scrutinizing your customers&#39; decision-making processes. Are they influenced by any emotional factors or are they able to set emotions aside entirely and take a hard-nosed and rational approach? Many consumer decisions include an emotional component and the involved companies&#39; advertising is a dead giveaway. Think of the ads we see for products like cars, travel, or soft drinks. These ads position the products via branding and image to maximize non-rational value factors, such as celebrity endorsement and high-end imagery.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This brings us to the third scale, which helps clarify how the customer chooses you.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;3. Assessable vs Unknowable&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Picture this. Julie is driving home from work, and she realizes that she needs milk, bread, and rice. She doesn&#39;t want to line up at a supermarket, so she pops into her local convenience store. In making this decision she evaluates price (she&#39;ll pay more than at the supermarket), customer service (quick and pleasant), location (handy, on her route home), product range (they have what she wants), hours of operation (they are open) and store presentation (clean and well organized).&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;All this is very assessable by her, and she comes to the decision to steer into her local convenience store rather than the busy underground car park at the supermarket. The criteria relevant to her decision are known and can be evaluated by her.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But in other cases, this isn&#39;t the situation. Take the case of my friend Jim, who recently had a knee replacement. I asked him how he chose his surgeon. “He was recommended by my local doctor,” he said. “He appears to have a good reputation. But, boy, he&#39;s expensive.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Jim&#39;s decision wasn&#39;t based on price. In fact, I&#39;ve yet to hear anyone say that they&#39;ve just had their hip or knee replaced by “the cheapest surgeon in town.” So, what was it based on?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Jim didn&#39;t have the specialist and technical knowledge to assess value. His perception of value was based on reputation and word of mouth. He assumed these factors would be reflected in the price — so the higher the price, the better the value.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you&#39;re in the business of selling products or services to customers who don&#39;t have the background knowledge to know exactly how they work, you need to figure out your place along the assessable vs unknowable scale. Customers making purchases in these areas are forced to rely on other sources of information to make their buy decisions. You must ensure that you&#39;re presenting well across those other sources.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;That&#39;s why Jim&#39;s specialist includes reference to a great deal of recent research from reputable teaching hospitals in the literature he provides to patients in pamphlets, on his website and in person. He also includes detailed descriptions of the cutting-edge technology he uses, to demonstrate he&#39;s up to date. Finally, he includes many testimonials from former patients telling their stories in their own words.&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;• • •&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are many ways you can get confused when it comes to figuring out what your customers value. But thinking where you stand on the three value scales will help you identify what kind of unique value you deliver, whether it&#39;s tangible or intangible, and how your customer recognizes it. That&#39;s how you&#39;ll build a real, sustainable competitive advantage.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 11 Oct 2023 20:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[The Future of Mental Health at Work Is Safety, Community, and a Healthy Organizational Culture]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/10/the-future-of-mental-health-at-work-is-safety-community-and-a-healthy-organizational-culture]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/10/Oct23_10_1446656906.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;Alexandr Dubynin/Getty Images&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;A new study exploring the ever-changing landscape of workers&amp;#8217; experiences and perspectives around mental health, stigma, and work has uncovered new insights about how workplace mental health has changed from before, during, and after the pandemic.

Employers have made noteworthy gains since then by providing expanded benefits, meditation apps, mindfulness programs, mental health days, and awareness campaigns. However, these investments on their own aren&#39;t enough.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2019, Mind Share Partners began our biennial Mental Health at Work Report in partnership with Qualtrics to explore the ever-changing landscape of workers&#39; experiences and perspectives around mental health, stigma, and work. Each report collected nationally representative samples of 1,500 full-time US workers. Each also included statistically significant sampling from historically marginalized populations: women, people of color, LGBTQ+ workers, and more.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This year, our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mindsharepartners.org/mentalhealthatworkreport-2023&quot;>;third study&lt;/a>; uncovered new insights about how workplace mental health has changed from before, during, and after the pandemic. Here&#39;s what we found about what workers want and need when it comes to mental health at work —&amp;nbsp;and how employers can provide it.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;The Changing Landscape of Workplace Mental Health&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;In Mind Share Partners&#39; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mindsharepartners.org/mentalhealthatworkreport-2019&quot;>;inaugural 2019 report&lt;/a>;, we described mental health as a “crucial factor” in workplace well-being, engagement, and productivity, as well as for diversity, equity, and inclusion. Despite ever-growing rates of mental health challenges, most employers were barely scratching the surface in terms of effective mental health support.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mindsharepartners.org/mentalhealthatworkreport-2021&quot;>;2021 report&lt;/a>;, we described workplace mental health as being at a &lt;a href=&quot;/2021/10/its-a-new-era-for-mental-health-at-work&quot;>;catalytic point in time&lt;/a>;. The prevalence of mental health challenges spiked amid the pandemic, and work itself became a greater strain on mental health. Simultaneously, our collective awareness of mental health grew, too. We were talking about it more and employers were investing in more mental health supports like benefits, meditation apps, and mental health days.&lt;/p>; &lt;article-promo>; &lt;hbr-component type=&quot;promo&quot; is-insight=&quot;insight-center&quot; title=&quot;The Future of Work&quot; dek=&quot;Will your company adapt or be left behind?&quot; cta-text=&quot;&quot; href=&quot;/insight-center/the-future-of-work&quot;>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/insight-center/the-future-of-work&quot; style=&quot;color:black;text-decoration:none&quot;>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; Insight Center Collection &lt;/div>; &lt;h3>;The Future of Work&lt;/h3>; &lt;div>; Will your company adapt or be left behind? &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hbr-component>; &lt;/article-promo>; &lt;p>;In 2023, the very ethos of work has been undergoing its own transformation. As the world emerges from the pandemic, workers are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2022/09/13/1122059402/the-economics-behind-quiet-quitting-and-what-we-should-call-it-instead&quot;>;re-evaluating&lt;/a>; what truly matters to them, leading to broader trends like quiet quitting, the Great Resignation, and more. Meanwhile, employer investments continue to shift. Some have continued to innovate and improve the workplace experience — for example, by increasing base pay, piloting four-day work weeks, and giving workers greater autonomy over where and how they work. Others have scaled back in hopes of achieving a “pre-pandemic normal.”&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Key Findings From Mind Share Partners&#39; 2023 Mental Health at Work Report&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;This year&#39;s study shows that mental health isn&#39;t improving in the US, but there are some new bright spots, too. Workers are demonstrating greater awareness around mental health at work and are looking beyond traditional benefits and the latest technologies. What they increasingly want is what the research has always shown works: mentally healthier cultures. Here&#39;s what we found:&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Workers are shifting from crisis to languishing.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;From 2019 to 2021, mental health symptoms spiked and workers&#39; overall views of their mental health declined. In 2023, we saw a 20% decline in those reporting any symptoms — a hopeful trend. But when asked to rate their overall mental health out of 10 in the past year, workers&#39; ratings continued to decline. In 2019, 78% gave ratings between seven and 10. In 2021, 67% did. In 2023, 61% rated between seven and 10, with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/hr-topics/organizational-and-employee-development/pages/financial-strain-impacts-workers-mental-health.aspx&quot;>;finances&lt;/a>; and work itself reported as having the greatest negative impacts on mental health.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;How is mental health seemingly improving and worsening at the same time? Mental health comprises a diverse spectrum of experiences, from diagnosable conditions and symptoms to challenges like grief, burnout, and stress. And emerging from the pandemic&#39;s many crises alleviated the severity of many mental health challenges at the time.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But workers entered a new world rife with its own challenges: inflation, growing &lt;a href=&quot;https://time.com/5888024/50-trillion-income-inequality-america/&quot;>;income inequality&lt;/a>; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2023/income-poverty-health-insurance-coverage.html&quot;>;poverty rates&lt;/a>;, layoffs, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/companies-making-workers-employees-return-to-office-rto-wfh-hybrid-2023-1&quot;>;forced returns&lt;/a>; to offices, employers doubling down on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/31/google-ceo-to-employees-productivity-and-focus-must-improve.html&quot;>;productivity&lt;/a>;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vox.com/recode/22841490/work-remote-wages-labor-force-participation-great-resignation-unions-quits&quot;>;growing tensions&lt;/a>; between employers and workers amid growing waves of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/09/03/business/economy/strikes-union-sag-uaw.html&quot;>;unionization&lt;/a>;. These issues are social, political, and economic in nature. And while therapy and meditation may certainly help an individual worker to cope, fundamentally solving these issues requires systemic interventions. Many populations, like young people, are still navigating &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/07/science/pandemic-adolescents-depression-anxiety.html&quot;>;crisis&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Thus, many fell into an overwhelming feeling of, well, “blah,” or as renowned organizational psychologist Adam Grant coined in 2021, they&#39;re “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/19/well/mind/covid-mental-health-languishing.html&quot;>;languishing&lt;/a>;.”&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Investing in organizational culture outperforms therapy and self-care.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Historically, mental health support from employers has primarily centered around a productized, individualized approach — therapy, apps, time off. This equips workers with the resources to self-manage their mental health on their own time outside of work. At the same time, it also implies that it should be dealt with personally in private.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the last few years, however, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/poor-working-conditions-can-impact-your-mental-health/450455&quot;>;research&lt;/a>; around the interdependencies between mental health and work itself continued to grow more robust. &lt;a href=&quot;/2019/12/burnout-is-about-your-workplace-not-your-people&quot;>;Burnout&lt;/a>; in particular was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/news/item/28-05-2019-burn-out-an-occupational-phenomenon-international-classification-of-diseases&quot;>;defined&lt;/a>; by the World Health Organization as fundamentally rooted in poorly managed workplace stress. Similarly, leading burnout researcher Christina Maslach identifies &lt;a href=&quot;/2021/02/beyond-burned-out&quot;>;six main causes of burnout&lt;/a>;: unsustainable workloads, perceived lack of control, insufficient rewards for effort, lack of a supportive community, lack of fairness, and mismatched values and skills — all workplace factors.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To better understand workers&#39; needs, we asked this year&#39;s respondents to rate how helpful the following were to their mental health:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;Mental health treatment&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Self-care resources for mental health&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;A safe and supportive culture for mental health&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;A healthy and sustainable culture of work&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;Among all respondents, a healthy and sustainable culture emerged as the clear winner, with 78% rating it as moderately, very, or extremely helpful. This remained true when segmenting outcomes across gender, generation, LGBTQ+ identity, race and ethnicity, caregiver status, and seniority levels. Next highest was a safe and supportive culture for mental health at 67%, followed by mental health treatment at 64%, and self-care resources at 60%.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Growing awareness of mental health among workers also came with a better understanding of what kind of support is truly helpful — beyond simply coping through work. Workers are seeing mental health as a collective workplace responsibility rather than an individual one. Increasingly, supporting mental health at work means fundamentally realigning an organization&#39;s culture with human well-being.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Psychological safety has declined.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;From our 2019 to 2021 studies, workers grew more comfortable talking about mental health and developed healthier beliefs about it and those with mental health conditions. Both indicate a reduction in mental health stigma. More workers also reported feeling supported as employers grew their investments in mental health resources.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Entering 2023, however, a paradox emerged. Workers&#39; personal beliefs continued to reflect a greater awareness and understanding of mental health. However, they also felt less safe talking about mental health at work, were less likely to do so, and felt less supported by their employers around mental health this year — and these declines neared pre-pandemic levels. In fact, workers&#39; comfort with talking about their mental health to senior leaders nearly halved from 37% in 2021 to just 19% in 2023.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Unfortunately, this isn&#39;t surprising. Despite many employers investing in mental health, many also went “back to business” in terms of &lt;a href=&quot;https://about.fb.com/news/2023/03/mark-zuckerberg-meta-year-of-efficiency/&quot;>;productivity&lt;/a>;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://fortune.com/2023/06/01/marc-benioff-salesforce-performance-culture-earnings-call/&quot;>;performance&lt;/a>;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://tech.co/news/heres-what-google-meta-and-co-have-cut-to-save-costs&quot;>;bottom-line costs&lt;/a>;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://fortune.com/2023/01/10/resistance-attrition-quiet-quitting-drop-diversity-forced-return-to-office-gleb-tsipursky/&quot;>;return to office plans&lt;/a>;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://abcnews.go.com/US/corporate-america-slashing-dei-workers-amid-backlash-diversity/story?id=100477952&quot;>;investments in DEI&lt;/a>; — all while still encouraging flexibility and work-life balance, despite the realities of work making it much more difficult to achieve. Amid mixed signals, workers&#39; sense of psychological safety within their organizations deteriorated despite greater awareness and healthier beliefs at the individual level.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Investments in DEI are improving mental health and engagement.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;In all three studies Mind Share Partners has conducted in partnership with Qualtrics since 2019, people from marginalized identity groups faced disproportionate challenges around mental health and work. This year, women, Gen Z, Black, Latinx, and LGBTQ+ respondents all tended to have worse mental health outcomes than their counterparts; were less likely to get a supportive response when they talked about their mental health at work; and were overall less engaged around job satisfaction, trust, pride, and intent to stay at their employer. These outcomes represent the persistence of cultures and systems that drive not only outright acts of discrimination but also of biases embedded in hiring, growth, and support processes.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The bright side? Employers&#39; efforts paid off and created meaningful changes to workers&#39; experiences. Respondents who felt their employer supported their identity showed better outcomes around mental health and the impact of work on mental health and were overall more engaged and committed to their employer compared to those who didn&#39;t feel supported.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;The answer to the return-to-office question is autonomy.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;The hybrid work debate continues to grow ever &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2023/07/remote-work-return-to-office-policies/674736/&quot;>;contentious&lt;/a>;. In this year&#39;s study, we asked participants whether they were working in person, hybrid, or fully remote. Additionally, we asked if they were doing so by choice or were mandated by their employer.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When comparing key outcomes across work situations, no consistent themes emerged. However, hybrid workers who had the freedom to decide where they work reported a shorter duration of mental health symptoms, a more positive impact of work on mental health, greater comfort talking about mental health at work, lower likelihood of leaving roles for mental health reasons, and greater pride and intent to stay at their current employer for two or more years.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is not — and never will be — a single, universal way of working that is unequivocally “better” or “worse” than the other. (Remember &lt;a href=&quot;/2019/11/the-truth-about-open-offices&quot;>;open offices&lt;/a>;?) The benefits will always vary depending on the company, function, industry, region, culture, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/worklab/in-the-office-it-is-all-about-moments-that-matter&quot;>;stage in an employee&#39;s life cycle&lt;/a>;, individual team members&#39; needs and preferences, and more. Yet the focus on work location detracts from the many other dimensions of working, like when we work or how we communicate. More importantly, it overshadows an even more fundamental question: the individual&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://fortune.com/2023/07/20/hybrid-work-problems-annie-dean-meta-atlassian/&quot;>;ability to choose&lt;/a>; what works for them.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;What Employers Can Do&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Since our founding in 2017, Mind Share Partners has worked with global organizations across industries, sizes, and regions. As we&#39;ve continued to grow our training, strategic advising, and implementation work within employers alongside our broader movement building and advocacy initiatives, we offer five key strategies for organizations based on this year&#39;s findings:&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Collectively re-envision a mentally healthy workplace.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;There will never be a one-size-fits-all vision of what a mentally healthy workplace looks like. Achieving this requires a collective re-envisioning of what workplace mental health means to everyone in the organization — leaders and workers alike — tailored to its size, stage, industry, region, individual roles, and more. This starts with understanding your organization, what mental health looks like within it, and ultimately, what your people want. This means &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mindsharepartners.org/post/5-workplace-mental-health-questions-to-include-in-employee-pulse-and-employee-engagement-surveys&quot;>;measuring&lt;/a>; mental health and workplace factors, asking about workers&#39; perspectives on a regular basis, and enacting real, meaningful change tailored to the needs of your people. Further embedding these efforts into your organization&#39;s culture, systems, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mindsharepartners.org/post/prioritizing-mental-health-throughout-employee-journey-mapping&quot;>;employee life cycle&lt;/a>;, and business strategy ensures that well-being is built into the business itself, not simply relegated to an HR &lt;a href=&quot;/2019/08/what-wellness-programs-dont-do-for-workers&quot;>;wellness program&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Enable culture change from top down and bottom up.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;This year&#39;s study showed that workers want safer and more supportive cultures for mental health and healthier and more sustainable work cultures in general. Inevitably, this kind of culture change requires both top-down and bottom-up approaches.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From the top, leaders can tell their own &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/05/leaders-sharing-your-own-mental-health-story-can-help-you-become-a-better-ally&quot;>;mental health story&lt;/a>; within their organization or turn outward and share publicly like in Mind Share Partners&#39; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mindsharepartners.org/leadersgofirst&quot;>;Leaders Go First &lt;/a>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mindsharepartners.org/leadersgofirst&quot;>;campaign&lt;/a>;. This normalizes mental health and helps others feel comfortable talking about it at work if they want to. They can also model healthy work practices and, specifically as leaders, resource teams and individuals to maintain healthy and sustainable ways of working.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From the bottom-up, employers and individual workers alike can explore forums for conversation, such as &lt;a href=&quot;/2020/05/how-to-form-a-mental-health-employee-resource-group&quot;>;employee resource groups&lt;/a>;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mindsharepartners.org/peerlisteningprograms&quot;>;peer listening programs&lt;/a>;, a cross-functional mental health working group, or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mindsharepartners.org/casestudy-pgim&quot;>;mental health champion networks&lt;/a>;. These conversations can be about mental health, but they can also take place within teams to establish work norms, explore &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/08/the-radical-promise-of-truly-flexible-work&quot;>;inclusive flexibility&lt;/a>;, and empower individuals to decide how they work best.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One natural step forward is to equip your people to lead this change. This typically happens through training across levels, taking a proactive, preventive approach with a management and equity lens that goes beyond simply “noticing the warning signs.” Workers and leaders alike need the strategies to create psychological safety and sustainable work cultures. Upskilling your people can also include &lt;a href=&quot;/2020/08/8-ways-managers-can-support-employees-mental-health&quot;>;manager programs&lt;/a>;, leadership coaching, mentorship, and more.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Explore root-cause solutions alongside wellness perks.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;When managing any strategy or budget, it&#39;s easy to fall into the trap of investing in “quick fix” programs and products without critically evaluating their purpose. For instance, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/mindsharepartners/2019/10/10/the-futility-of-mental-health-days/&quot;>;mental health days&lt;/a>; allege benefits of rest and rejuvenation and are often accompanied by optimistic awareness slogans like “It&#39;s OK not to be OK!” This can accomplish commendable intentions: giving rest, raising awareness, and sparking a broader dialogue. But what comes after? Well, in many cases, it&#39;s back to the same churn and burn(out). Even worse, it enables employers to continue “not okay” (ie, unsustainable) business practices under the guise of personal resilience.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Leaders need to offer ways to cope &lt;em>;and &lt;/em>;solve for root causes. There&#39;s an ever-growing number of players in the space — &lt;a href=&quot;https://time.com/6308096/therapy-mental-health-worse-us/&quot;>;health care providers&lt;/a>;, &lt;a href=&quot;/2019/08/what-wellness-programs-dont-do-for-workers&quot;>;wellness programs&lt;/a>;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/the-unbearable-irony-of-meditation-apps/&quot;>;meditation apps&lt;/a>; — each with its own philosophy, approach, product, and business objective. All have their unique benefits often steeped in scientific literature, but when workers are asking for a healthy and sustainable culture of work, these approaches &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eidCHlP8_bQ&quot;>;may not solve the right problem&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Recommit to the foundations of work itself.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;While every organization is different, there are still core foundations every workplace must meaningfully address in order to cultivate a mentally healthy workforce:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Safety:&lt;/strong>; This includes physical and psychological safety, financial stability, as well as balance and sustainability in the long term.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Autonomy: &lt;/strong>;This includes the time, bandwidth, and resources to do one&#39;s job; control, flexibility, and predictability over one&#39;s work; and having a voice.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Belonging: &lt;/strong>;This includes the ability to show up authentically to work, make meaningful connections and be supported, and feel a holistic sense of community with others.&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;These are core human needs that, unfortunately, tend to be overlooked as employers pursue wellness perks without addressing the fundamentals. For a deeper dive, explore the US Surgeon General&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hhs.gov/surgeongeneral/priorities/workplace-well-being/index.html&quot;>;recently launched framework&lt;/a>; on workplace mental health and well-being, which Mind Share Partners collaborated on.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Stay the course on DEI.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Employers&#39; place in solving the inequities of the world has been heavily debated, to say the least. But let&#39;s look even more simply at what&#39;s well within the realm of their control: the workplace. Organizations not only have the ethical responsibility to avoid perpetuating inequity but also the opportunity to help employees flourish from human diversity, camaraderie, and shared purpose. This year&#39;s data shows that when social identities are supported, workers have better mental health and engagement outcomes.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Mental health and DEI are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mindsharepartners.org/diversityinclusion&quot;>;intrinsically tied&lt;/a>;. Historically marginalized groups face added cultural and structural barriers both at work and when &lt;a href=&quot;https://steinberginstitute.org/bipoc-mental-health-month-common-barriers-to-mental-health-services/&quot;>;seeking&lt;/a>; mental health support. Mental health is also a category within DEI given the prevailing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.psychiatry.org/patients-families/stigma-and-discrimination&quot;>;stigma and marginalization&lt;/a>; of those navigating mental health challenges or living with conditions.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ultimately, DEI is about making the work work for everyone. Of course, like any visionary goal, this requires people power, budget, strategic planning, and cross-functional investment. Unfortunately, some employers have &lt;a href=&quot;https://qz.com/it-shouldn-t-be-this-easy-for-companies-to-walk-back-th-1850686363&quot;>;shied away&lt;/a>; from DEI amid the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/30/business/economy/hiring-affirmative-action.html&quot;>;rollback&lt;/a>; of affirmative action. Others remain steadfast and committed, in part as a business imperative. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mindsharepartners.org/post/mind-share-partners-to-corporate-america-stay-the-course-on-dei&quot;>;Our message&lt;/a>;? Stay the course.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;. 。 .&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;What would typically take decades for a social movement, the workplace mental health movement achieved in a matter of years.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As we look to the future, the workplace mental health movement will ultimately need to go “back to basics.” Workers no longer want frivolous perks to distract them from work. They want stable employment to mitigate financial anxiety, recognition to know they matter, sustainable workloads to prevent burnout, a supportive community to find belonging, the flexibility to decide how work works for them, and the autonomy and voice to feel respect, agency, and ownership over their work and their lives.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The future of mental health at work won&#39;t be an emerging technological renaissance or a transformation of hybrid work. The future will be a recommitment to core human needs. It will be safety, community, and a healthy organizational culture. It will be sustainable work rooted in equity and workers&#39; voices. The future of workplace mental health will start with exactly that: work itself.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 10 Oct 2023 23:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Why Your Organization Should Use Salary Benchmarking]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/10/why-your-organization-should-use-salary-benchmarking]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/10/Oct23_09_1372212398.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;Jorg Greuel/Getty Images&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;In a growing number of states and countries, employers are not allowed to ask job candidates&amp;#8217; salary history or even their salary expectations. That means employers must find new ways to determine appropriate compensation. A key solution lies in salary benchmarking &amp;#8212; using aggregated market data to establish competitive pay rates. Recent research in collaboration with a leading US payroll processing company revealed that access to robust benchmarking tools doubled the probability of firms setting the &amp;#8220;right&amp;#8221; salary. Data sources vary from government-released data to crowdsourced information on platforms like Glassdoor. Despite the availability of various tools, ensuring that salary decisions align with market trends is crucial, not just for compliance but also for retaining talent. As pay transparency grows, leveraging high-quality benchmarking sources effectively can optimize employer&amp;#8217;s wage expenses and bolster employee retention.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/10/why-your-organization-should-use-salary-benchmarking?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/10/why-your-organization-should-use-salary-benchmarking?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;Recent transparency policies across several US states, like salary history bans that prevent employers from requiring candidates to report their compensation or even their salary expectations, have heightened the focus on fair salary practices in the workplace. As a result, there&#39;s an increased demand for strategies to determine appropriate compensation. A key solution lies in salary benchmarking: using aggregated market data to establish competitive pay rates.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Setting salaries is a balancing act: you do not want to offer salaries that are too high relative to the market, because that&#39;d be wasteful; but offering salaries that are below market may make it difficult to attract, retain and motivate your employees. How do employers find their sweet spot?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nber.org/papers/w30570&quot;>;recent study&lt;/a>;, we developed a theoretical model to shed light on the demand for salary benchmarking. In our model, firms know exactly how much value the job candidate would bring to the table. The firm would like to offer the candidate below that value to keep some of the value as profit. However, how much lower should the offer be? The lower the offer, the better the savings. On the other hand, if the offer is too low, the firm risks losing the job candidate to another firm — they may turn down the offer, or accept the offer and leave shortly thereafter.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So, whether the company wants to make a more or less aggressive offer depends critically on what the firm believes is the market value of the job candidate: ie, how much &lt;em>;other firms&lt;/em>; are willing to pay for the job candidate. That&#39;s where salary benchmarking comes in: firms can use data on the offers accepted by similar employees (eg, with the same position title and industry) to make sure that their offer is not too low, or too high, relative to the market benchmark.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Our research also provides empirical evidence that access to salary benchmarks has a significant effect on the salaries that firms set. We conducted it in collaboration with the largest US payroll processing company, ADP, serving 650,000 firms and processing paychecks for 20 million Americans. In addition to the payroll services, the company aggregates the salary data from their payroll records in the form of salary benchmarks. Clients can then &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.adp.com/what-we-offer/products/adp-datacloud.aspx&quot;>;search&lt;/a>; for any job title they want in a user-friendly way. It is one of the most advanced benchmark tools and is being used by many prominent firms.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Our data covers the roll-out of the tool when it was first introduced to the market, late 2015, through the start of the pandemic in 2020. Our sample includes 584 “treatment” firms that gained access to the tool and 1,431 “control” firms that did not gain access to the tool but were selected because they shared similar characteristics to the treatment firms. We studied the evolution of salaries in the treatment firms shortly before and after they gained access to the benchmarking tool, and we compared that to the corresponding evolution of salaries in the control firms.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Here&#39;s what we found: let&#39;s say that a firm sets the “right” salary when they choose a salary that is in a narrow (5%) band of the median salary for the same position, industry, and state. Prior to gaining access to the benchmarking tool, there was an 11.6% probability that a firm sets the “right” salary. After gaining access to the benchmarking tool, the probability of setting the “right” salary increased two-fold, to 22.1%. This is compelling evidence that these salary benchmarks are truly influencing pay-setting, and causing position-level salaries to converge across companies.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We also found that the effects of salary benchmarking are quite symmetric. After looking up the benchmark, firms are less likely to pay significantly above-market, presumably because it would be wasteful; but firms are also less likely to pay significantly below-market, presumably because it would be costly in terms of attracting, retaining and motivating employees.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For standardized positions, such as bank teller and receptionist, we found some evidence of a modest increase in the average salary. If employers are choosing to raise salaries for this group, it must be because they expect to get something in return, right? For instance, bumping salaries up to market may allow employers to retain their employees and save those pesky turnover costs. Our research shows that, indeed, benchmarking improves retention. Among employees in these roles, the gain of about 6% in average salary was followed by an increase of about 16% in the retention rate over the following 12 months.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;How can I use salary benchmarking?&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;The payroll data show that high quality salary benchmarks sway employers to set pay closer to the marketplace median pay, and that benchmark users benefit from a boost in employee retention. But how exactly does one go about sourcing and using a salary benchmark?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Salary benchmarks are wide ranging; some are created by the government and others exclusive to the clients of consulting firms. Still others are crowdsourced data from anonymous employees. For example, the US government reports average earnings at the six-digit occupation code, within industry and state, each year using surveys of businesses and households. These data are highly representative, but are released infrequently and at a higher level of aggregation than the sought after position level information. Meanwhile, several large consulting firms offer exclusive access to the aggregated earnings of their clients, often using proprietary standardized corporate titles. Most recently, firms that collect salary information as part of their core businesses, like ADP, have added user interfaces that make these data accessible as benchmarks. And platforms like Glassdoor have encouraged millions of users to volunteer their salary information anonymously in exchange for seeing the average inputs of others at the position level.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To better understand how firms use salary benchmarking, we also conducted a survey with the members of the Society for Human Resource Management Research Institute (SHRM). We collected responses from a large sample of 2,085 HR managers in charge of pay-setting. This sample spans organizations of every size, state and industry, including both public and private sectors. To complement this data, we conducted an additional survey with a sample of clients from ADP, in which we obtained responses from 720 HR managers in charge of pay-setting.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Employers use salary benchmarking for a wide range of purposes. For instance, 54% of respondents use benchmarking when setting the pay of new hires. Other popular uses include salary negotiations (53%), setting ranges for specific job titles (90%), and setting the salary for a job advertisement (41%). Employers also vary in terms of how frequently they consult salary benchmarks. For instance, while some employers do benchmarking for every single new hire (37% of respondents), the rest prefer to do it for some specific new hires or for some specific positions.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Our survey data indicates that employers differ in which data sources they use. The most popular option is to use industry surveys, chosen by 68% of respondents, but hiring a consulting firm to conduct these surveys can be quite expensive, and there is no guarantee that the survey data will live up to the expectations. If you do not have a big budget, you may also want to try the second most popular option: free online data sources (58% of respondents) such as Glassdoor.com. More recently, payroll service companies have gained popularity (used by 23% of respondents and the fastest growing source), which may give the best bang for your buck in terms of data quality. Most employers, however, use a combination of data sources. While the majority look at free online sources, on a scale of 1-5, HR professionals report that other sources are twice as trustworthy as free online sources.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Labor market trends can sometimes change rapidly, especially in the post-pandemic world. You do not need to check the benchmarks on a daily basis, but try to at least do it from time to time — remember that information, too, has an expiration date. Likewise, you may not have time to sit down to study market trends for every position in which you hire. However, make sure to at least do due diligence for the positions that are most critical for your business.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When using a benchmarking tool, you may feel information overload. Some tools provide not only the median pay, but also the mean, 10th percentile, 25th percentile, and so on and so forth. And some tools allow you to filter by industry, state, and other criteria. There are trade-offs. For instance, filters can allow you to focus on peer employers, but at the cost of smaller sample sizes and thus statistically imprecise benchmarks. While the right approach depends on the context at hand, according to our survey, there are some clear favorites: most firms (89%) prefer to look at the median market pay or the average market pay, and the most popular filters are by industry (87%) and state (84%).&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We also gave the survey respondents an opportunity to share their own tips and advice for salary benchmarking. Some recommended not relying on job title information alone, but rather to pay attention to the job description to ensure it&#39;s a good match. Another manager suggested that, to the extent possible, you should review the benchmarks regularly to stay in sync with the latest trends in the job market. In the same spirit, one manager recommends being proactive — do not wait until employees are unhappy about low pay and reach out to you, or you risk higher turnover.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In sum, the pay transparency revolution extends to firms knowing much more about what their competitors are offering. New high-quality sources have changed pay-setting practices. According to our latest study, keeping up with pay in the marketplace, and knowing how to use those sources, can affect your bottom-line retention and payroll costs. And from a societal perspective, this is closing the gap between pay across firms.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 10 Oct 2023 22:25:01 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[10 Reasons Why Inclusion Is a Competitive Advantage]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/10/10-reasons-why-inclusion-is-a-competitive-advantage]]><description>&lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/10/Oct23_10_457893079.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;Michael H/Getty Images&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;In their new book, &lt;em>;Move Fast and Fix Things&lt;/em>;, Frances Frei and Anne Morriss outline five strategies to help leaders tackle their hardest problems and quickly make change.

Serious people are working to identify and quantify the many effects of inclusion on firm performance, and the insights they&#39;re generating are persuasive.

Inclusion helps you recruit good people. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Inclusion is now a tell for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.glassdoor.com/employers/blog/diversity/&quot;>;all kinds of talented people&lt;/a>; — not only the underrepresented — that you&#39;ve built a healthy workplace and understand what it takes to collectively excel. Expect candidates to look for evidence of inclusiveness in everything from where you recruit to the fine print of your benefits package. For example, they may not need those same-sex fertility benefits or veteran mentorship services, but they&#39;ll still see them as a sign that you appreciate difference.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;2. Inclusion helps you retain good people.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;It turns out that those same candidates &lt;a href=&quot;/2018/12/to-retain-employees-focus-on-inclusion-not-just-diversity&quot;>;will stick around as employees&lt;/a>; if you truly walk the talk on inclusion. Inclusion drives &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jstor.org/stable/25067557&quot;>;higher rates of retention&lt;/a>; at all levels of the organization, and some employee segments (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.shrm.org/foundation/ourwork/initiatives/engaging-and-integrating-military-veterans/Documents/13056-G-01_SHRMF_WhyHireVet.pdf&quot;>;military veterans top the list&lt;/a>;) will reward your ability to value their unique contribution with industry-leading loyalty.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;3. Inclusion increases the engagement of your people. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Engagement scores are consistently higher for companies labeled “inclusive,” and we now have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/joshbersin/2015/12/06/why-diversity-and-inclusion-will-be-a-top-priority-for-2016/?sh=fc0a6632ed5b&quot;>;some interesting data&lt;/a>; that helps to explain these numbers. Inclusive companies are &lt;em>;also &lt;/em>;almost three times better at coaching people for improved performance and four times better at identifying and building leaders. Making people better is the key to their engagement, and inclusion seems to give you an advantage.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;4. &lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Inclusion makes you more resilient.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;When different types of people are thriving in your organization, &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/11/why-diverse-teams-are-smarter&quot;>;you&#39;re better at navigating crises&lt;/a>; and (our favorite business euphemism) “turbulent times” in general. You&#39;re more adaptable, more comfortable with change, and better at dealing with personnel problems. One fun fact: while the S&amp;amp;P saw a 35% decline in stock performance between 2007 and 2009 (remember that ride?), the shares of inclusive companies went in the other direction, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/mursalhedayat/2020/06/24/diversity-in-the-workplace-is-now-more-critical-than-ever/?sh=5172eb6e60aa&quot;>;gaining over 14% in value&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;5. &lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Inclusion grows your marketplace.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Inclusive teams are &lt;a href=&quot;/2013/12/how-diversity-can-drive-innovation&quot;>;better at identifying and cultivating new markets&lt;/a>; because they expand a firm&#39;s peripheral vision and help eliminate its blind spots. &lt;a href=&quot;/2004/09/diversity-as-strategy&quot;>;More women in decision-making roles&lt;/a>;, for example, improves a company&#39;s ability to solve problems for female clients. And this is before we even get to the macro implications of &lt;em>;economic &lt;/em>;inclusion. For example, the US GDP could get &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.accenture.com/_acnmedia/pdf-89/accenture-disability-inclusion-research-report.pdf&quot;>;a boost of up to $25 billion&lt;/a>; if just 1% more of persons with disabilities joined the labor force. What percentage of that boost would represent new customers for your business?&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;6. &lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Inclusion makes you more innovative.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Inclusion creates a healthier meritocracy for new ideas &lt;a href=&quot;/2021/04/research-adding-women-to-the-c-suite-changes-how-companies-think&quot;>;where out-of-the-box thinking is more likely to break through&lt;/a>;. This happens in part because people in inclusive organizations are more likely to surface and hear the &lt;em>;what &lt;/em>;of a good idea rather than allow that idea to be diluted or buried by an unexpected &lt;em>;who&lt;/em>;. How much of an innovation bump does true inclusion buy you? Depending on your starting place, estimates range from &lt;a href=&quot;/2018/01/how-and-where-diversity-drives-financial-performance&quot;>;roughly 20%&lt;/a>; all the way &lt;a href=&quot;/2013/12/how-diversity-can-drive-innovation&quot;>;up to 70%&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;7. Inclusion turns you into better decision-makers. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Decision quality goes up when a range of voices are &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/11/why-diverse-teams-are-smarter&quot;>;not only present but also integrated&lt;/a>;. In &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/eriklarson/2017/09/21/new-research-diversity-inclusion-better-decision-making-at-work/?sh=627907124cbf&quot;>;one delightful study&lt;/a>;, all-male teams beat individuals nearly 60% of the time, but gender-diverse teams outperformed individuals almost 75% of the time. Teams that were gender diverse, geographically diverse, and had at least one age gap of more than 20 years made better decisions than that lone individual &lt;em>;87% of the time&lt;/em>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;8. Inclusion helps you manage risk.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;In the wreckage of the 2008 financial crisis, a serious “Lehman Sisters” argument emerged positing that the story would have played out differently if more women had been in the room for the most consequential decisions. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0148296315002143&quot;>;Subsequent&lt;/a>; &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.aom.org/doi/abs/10.5465/amj.2018.1039?journalCode=amj&quot;>;studies&lt;/a>; have since explored this argument, concluding that gender inclusion in the C-suite and boardroom is associated with a healthier firm relationship to risk—neither overly risk-averse nor risk-seeking—and better overall performance.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;9. Inclusion improves your stock price. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Estimated bumps to shareholder returns range &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.catalyst.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/The_Bottom_Line_Connecting_Corporate_Performance_and_Gender_Diversity.pdf&quot;>;from 10% to over 30%&lt;/a>; (seriously) when you get inclusion right. This may be why Goldman Sachs &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/article/bc-finreg-unlocking-diversity-inclusion/unlocking-diversitys-promise-psychological-safety-trust-and-inclusion-idUSKBN2C01N2&quot;>;recently announced&lt;/a>; that it would no longer take any company public where the board is made up exclusively of straight, white men. Whatever your organization&#39;s own return on inclusion may end up being, the question we often ask companies is, “What else are you doing to chase those kinds of returns?”&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;10. Inclusion makes you more money. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;For all the reasons we&#39;ve covered in entries one through nine, inclusion ends up &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/diversity-and-inclusion/diversity-wins-how-inclusion-matters&quot;>;boosting both your top line and bottom line&lt;/a>;. Your talented, engaged teams will drive higher revenues through better innovation and smarter market development, while allowing you to spend capital more efficiently through better decision-making, higher retention, and higher productivity. And when you hit some turbulence along the way, you&#39;re more likely to land the plane safely. We hope to live in a world where inclusion is an organizational given. Until we get there, we know of no other distinction that can deliver these kinds of advantages.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;em>;This excerpt has been lightly edited.&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 10 Oct 2023 21:25:02 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
