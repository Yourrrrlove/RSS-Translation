&lt;span>;&lt;p>;公司继续努力设计和实施适合员工的疫情后重返办公室策略。为了找到最可行的替代方案，他们应该关注四个因素：工作需求、人员需求、工作完成方式以及管理混合劳动力所需的新管理力量。&lt;/p>; &lt;/span >; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/10/does-your-hybrid-strategy-need-to-change?language=es&quot;>;阅读西班牙语&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/10/does-your-hybrid-strategy-need-to-change?language=pt&quot;>;葡萄牙语&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;今年秋天，公司再次推动员工&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/zoom-other-remote-work-champions-call-employees-back-to-the-office-e5a78c2d &quot;>;返回&lt;/a>;办公室，继续争论员工应该面对面工作多少天。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这场争论仍然没有抓住重点。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一刀切只有当工作是由同质劳动力执行的普遍任务时，放之四海而皆准的任务才能成功。当然，我们知道这两者都不是真的。 CEO 不应&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/29/business/amazon-jobs-return-to-office/index.html&quot;>;威胁&lt;/a>;员工，而应授权并使他们的经理（尤其是一线经理）能够深入细致地了解团队所做的工作、团队成员的工作风格以及如何最好地完成工作。他们还必须考虑生成式人工智能的影响，这将改变所有这些因素。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我们的研究、与公司领导者合作的经验以及对世界各地员工的调查表明，考虑这些因素如何能够带来更好的结果每个人的结果。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;公司正处于十字路口&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;我们可以同情首席执行官。尽管入住率创历史新低，但领导者必须证明办公室租金的合理性，并在空荡荡的大厅中建立协作文化。他们正在努力&lt;a href=&quot;/2022/09/when-quiet-quitting-is-worse-than-the-real-thing&quot;>;安静戒烟&lt;/a>;，&lt;a href=&quot;https://www .wsj.com/lifestyle/careers/youve-heard-of-quiet-quitting-now-companies-are-quiet-cutting-ba2c326d&quot;>;安静切割&lt;/a>;，来自市政府的压力，要求恢复商业区的活力，以及生成人工智能的影响。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但是，这些压力的答案并不是返回办公室的强制要求，这些强制要求本质上使用面对面时间作为绩效管理工具 - 想想徽章刷卡监控，它有&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/13/google-rto-crackdown-gets-backlash-check-my-work-not-my-badge.html&quot;>;引起了明显的强烈反对&lt;/a >;。监控员工上网时间也不起作用。最近 &lt;a href=&quot;https://slack.com/intl/en-gb/blog/news/state-of-work-2023&quot;>;Slack 对 18,149 名办公桌员工和高管进行的调查&lt;/a>;显示， 32% 的员工时间花在表演性工作上，63% 的员工即使当时没有工作，也会尝试保持在线状态。&lt;/p>; &lt;article-promo>; &lt;hbr-component type=&quot;promo &quot; is-insight=&quot;insight-center&quot; title=&quot;工作的未来&quot; dek=&quot;您的公司会适应还是被抛在后面？&quot; cta-text=&quot;&quot; href=&quot;/insight-center/the-future-of-work&quot;>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/insight-center/the-future-of-work&quot; style=&quot;color:black ;text-decoration:none&quot;>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; 洞察中心集合 &lt;/div>; &lt;h3>;工作的未来&lt;/h3>; &lt;div>; 您的公司会适应还是被抛在后面？ &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hbr-component>; &lt;/article-promo>; &lt;p>;将实际存在或在线活跃时间与生产力联系起来的倾向是一个更广泛问题的征兆，因为当今的许多领导者都在努力接受与他们成长过程截然不同的工作方式。他们在一种文化中证明了自己，在这种文化中，朝九晚五上班是常态，任何试图灵活工作的人都会被边缘化——比如那些在“&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.themuse”上工作的人。 .com/advice/mommy-track-what-to-do&quot;>;妈妈追踪&lt;/a>;。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;最成功的组织会认识到，设置严格的、自上而下的规则太复杂了工作、团队和客户的核心管理者在获得正确的技能和工具时最有能力做出此类决策。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;首席执行官和高管专注于以下四项行动的团队可以让每个人的工作&lt;em>;更好&lt;/em>;。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;认识工作的需求&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;当我们询问&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bcg.com/publications/2023/flexible-working-models&quot;>;超过 1,500 名办公室员工&lt;/a>;何时愿意亲自参加时，我们了解到他们希望来办公室完成他们认为最好在办公室完成的任务和活动。例如，与从事需要集中精力的工作或处理管理任务（这些任务最好远程完成）相比，参与者更愿意亲自参加工作以促进联系和发展的可能性高出八倍。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但员工感觉最强烈的地方有效地完成某些类型的工作只是问题的一方面。我们还调查了他们花费多少时间来完成这些任务。我们发现，个人贡献者将 37% 的时间花在他们认为亲自完成最有效的工作上；对于经理和高管来说，这一比例跃升至 49%。但这是各个组织的平均水平。对于领导者来说，根据工作性质和组织中的人员花时间调查这些偏好非常重要。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;认识到哪些类型的工作最适合在不同的环境中完成变得更加重要在生成式人工智能时代。我们的调查数据表明，在进行焦点工作时，65% 的员工希望远程办公，但使用生成式人工智能可以大大增强其中一些工作的效果。 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bcg.com/publications/2023/how-people-create-and-destroy-value-with-gen-ai&quot;>;我们的 BCG 同事进行的现场实验&lt;/a>;在哈佛商学院、麻省理工学院、沃顿商学院和华威大学的一组学者的支持下发现，对于涉及创意构思的任务，GenAI 生成的输出应被视为最终草案（而不是人类需要接受的初稿）是时候编辑了）。这意味着对于一些员工来说，他们所做的工作组合可能会开始发生变化，因为他们会移交一些他们更喜欢远程完成的重点工作，并承担超出生成人工智能能力范围的其他任务。因此，他们的工作模式可能也需要改变，具体取决于这些新任务的内容。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;认识到人们的需求&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;在我们的调查显示，大约 90% 的女性、护理人员、LGBTQ+ 或残障员工认为灵活的工作选择是决定留任或离职的重要因素。这比不认同这些类别的员工高出 30%。换句话说：如果您关心多样性、公平和包容性，您需要建立正确的工作模式。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我们发现性别方面存在特别巨大的差距：女性员工的可能性是女性员工的 1.5 倍比男性同行更注重灵活性。这不仅仅是职场妈妈的现象。当比较照顾者和非照顾者时，我们发现女性之间只有微小的差异（3%）。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我们的生物认知差异也表明对某些工作环境的偏好。在某些情况下，从事相同工作的一群人可能具有相似的认知特征。例如，软件工程师团队更有可能“&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.01098/full&quot;>;善于分析/意志坚强&lt;/a>;”因此，当允许保持专注并更喜欢按常规进行日常工作时，可能会工作得最好。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但是认知多样性高的团队将需要更多选择来保持最佳绩效和幸福感。例如，我们在调查中发现了异常值——那些喜欢远程进行交互式工作、喜欢亲自进行行政或重点工作的人。他们的某些偏好可能与内向/外向等认知特征有关。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;领导者在如何思考如何让具有不同认知特征的员工发挥最大作用方面苦苦挣扎，最好记住这一点&lt;a href= &quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/deborahlovich/2022/03/02/its-past-time-to-treat-all-employees-like-customers/?sh=4e65e14126ff&quot;>;您的员工就像与您的客户一样多样化&lt;/a>;。正如成功的公司关注他们的客户和他们所做的决定一样，对他们来说，关注他们的员工可能更重要。通过这样做，他们可以揭示做出职业决策所涉及的情感和功能需求的根源，并创造满足这些需求的工作环境。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;重新思考如何完成工作&lt;/strong >;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;“Place”只是完成工作的另一个工具。 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bcg.com/publications/2023/stop-tracking-employee-attendance-start-trusting-people&quot;>;正如哈佛商学院教授 Tsedal Neeley 所观察到的&lt;/a>;，“我谈论使用办公室作为工具，就像我们使用各种技术作为沟通和参与的工具一样。如果您将办公室视为一种工具，您就会确定它对于需要人们实际在一起的协作有哪些具体用途。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;然而，62% 的调查受访者告诉我们，他们没有办公室在他们的工作模式政策中说。相反，它是由公司范围内的指导方针或其经理决定的。在所有参与者中，39% 的人表示他们的工作地点由公司决定。在这些公司中，24% 的员工对其工作地点政策不满意；如果经理决定，这个数字会减少到 14%，如果团队决定，这个数字会减少到 6%。政策制定得越接近工作执行者，员工就越满意。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;像 &lt;a href=&quot;https://fortune.com/2023/05/05/cisco-ceo 这样的公司-chuck-robbins-rebranding-office-collaboration-center-slashing-private-workspaces-coax-employees-back/?utm_source=email&amp;amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;amp;utm_campaign=chro-daily&amp;amp;utm_content=2023081413pm&amp;amp;tpcc=NL_Marketing&quot;>;思科&lt;/a>; 和 &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.dropbox.com/topics/work-culture/the-shifting-dimensions-of-work#:~:text=At%20Dropbox%2C%20我们已经%20决定，a%20daily%20basis%20post%2DCOVID。&quot;>;Dropbox&lt;/a>; 正在重新设计其办公空间，使其更适合协作。这些举措符合各自的工作模式政策，使员工能够远程集中工作，并鼓励员工聚集在一起参加全体会议等重要活动。正如思科首席执行官查克·罗宾斯 (Chuck Robbins) 所说，在当今世界，您必须提供令人信服的“通勤回报”，才能让您的员工愿意进入办公室。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;重新设计的工作模式还需要考虑工作方式我们沟通的内容。例如，我们&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.verizon.com/about/news/verizon-study-focus-meeting-accomplish-more&quot;>;与 Verizon 合作&lt;/a>;改进他们召开会议的方式，例如安排 25 或 50 分钟的会议，并延迟 5 或 10 分钟的开始时间，以便给人们喘息的空间。我们还确定了可以用异步工作模式（例如电子邮件、聊天、共享文档或离线审阅）取代的会议，并阐明了“必需”和“可选”的含义。在我们的实验中，90% 的参与者表示会议的整体效率有所提高，78% 的参与者认为他们在不需要现场参与的会议上浪费的时间减少了。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;领导者还需要监控会议的影响他们引入的新技术。上述生成式人工智能实验还表明，过度依赖生成式人工智能可能会导致集体思想多样性的丧失。当领导者寻求从生成式人工智能的价值创造机会中受益时，他们需要考虑人们在哪里以及如何最有效地协作，以确保他们保留创造力和创新性。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;投资于建立一个新的管理力量&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;这些因素的协调需要来自管理者——那些在第一线与团队合作的人。他们最接近工作、人员以及工作完成方式的需求。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但是，这种编排需要两种新的管理力量。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;第一个是以前的管理力量。在新冠疫情之前，默认情况下工作是在办公室完成的；在新冠疫情期间，远程工作对于许多办公室专业人员来说占主导地位时，也不需要。管理者现在需要促进与团队的讨论，并就工作的地点、时间和方式进行协调。他们需要每周进行回顾，了解哪些工作有效，哪些无效，以及下周工作方式需要改变哪些内容。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;第二块肌肉可以说是管理者在新冠疫情之前需要的，因为与分布式团队并不新鲜。管理者需要培养建立联系和文化的能力，以及在分布式和混合团队中发展、激励、指导和指导的能力。他们还必须满足员工的情感和功能需求。 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bcg.com/publications/2022/all-about-generative-leadership-and-its-benefits&quot;>;近期 BCG 调查&lt;/a>;，内容涉及员工对工作中领导力的期望在九个国家进行的研究表明，伟大领导者的四大品质是认可、人员辅导和发展、同理心倾听和关怀。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;培养这些新的管理技能需要付出努力，但回报是值得的：更好绩效、参与度和保留率等等。就像任何肌肉一样，它需要投入时间和练习来增强。然而，每个组织都可以从内部开始采取积极的步骤：确定最好的经理——那些已经在做其中一些事情的人。确定使他们与众不同的具体习惯和行为，然后遵循“最好的教导其他人”的方法来帮助其他人学习如何发展类似的能力。这超出了简单的训练；它涉及教学、指导、榜样和奖励每天的新工作方式。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;简而言之：领导者不应制定自上而下的指令并期望一线经理执行这些指令，而应专注于授权这些经理与团队共同创造最适合人员需求和工作需求的工作方式，以及他们可以使用的数字和 GenAI 工具。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;尽管可能更容易随波逐流并发布全面的重返办公室政策，基于上述四个类别实施深思熟虑的变革的潜在好处不仅是值得的，而且很快将成为想要创造和维持工作的企业的当务之急以及未来的人才优势。&lt;/p>;

- 具体来说，我们如何帮助减轻癌症患者正在经历的精神痛苦。&lt;/span>;&lt; /p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;癌症很难从任何方面讨论&lt;/span>;&lt;em>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;任何&lt;/span>; &lt;/em>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;当然，这是一种观点，但工作场所有时会模糊地区分“与工作相关”和“与工作无关”的内容，尤其是在工作场所。具有挑战性的场景。为了更好地了解这些情况，我们采访了五位女性，她们在工作中谈论了她们的乳腺癌诊断，她们经历了同事的各种反应。虽然样本量很小，但我们相信，他们的故事共同表明，通过这种经历来支持同事有更好和更坏的方法，并且他们提供了一些有用的策略来帮助面临这种诊断的人。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;不该说的话&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;乳腺癌患者常常被善意但无益的陈词滥调所困扰，尤其是与他们在工作中只是偶然认识的人。根据哈里斯民意调查，21% 的患有癌症的职业成年人遇到“关于他们的癌症诊断的不敏感或冒犯性的评论。”&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot; >;萨布丽娜·埃利松多 (Sabrina Elizondo) 是一家混合媒体制作公司的执行制片人，她在化疗期间的某个时刻，感觉好多了，并发布了一些自己在音乐节上侧手翻的照片。接下来的周一上班时，她的老板评论道：“&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;如果你有精力做侧手翻，我觉得你就有精力承担更多的工作。 ”这一观察感觉就像是一记重击，让埃利松多原本对能够享受一点乐趣的感激之情变成了非人化。 &lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;“她的冷漠让我感觉自己作为一个人很少受到关注和关心，”埃利松多解释道。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt; span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;会计师杰米·帕肯 (Jamie Parcon) 指出，即使是看似来自支持者的评论也可能会产生意想不到的痛苦反响。 “我觉得五分之一的回答是他们认识其他患有乳腺癌的人，”帕肯说。莱昂斯说，她认为这是大多数人的本能反应。 “我们希望将其与我们自己的故事联系起来，”她说。 “每个人都曾遭遇过癌症。”不过，虽然这句话似乎无伤大雅，但帕肯解释道，“知道其他人不得不受苦，这并没有让我感觉更好。”&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font- Weight: 400;&quot;>;其他下意识的反应，比如“你会渡过难关的！”很诱人，但它们也可能疏远正在经历这种危险经历的人——尤其是如果这就是 &lt;/span>;&lt;i>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;全部 &lt;/span>;&lt;/i>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;你这么说，却没有得到有意义的支持。 “我听到的是陈词滥调，然后就沉默了，”娱乐业律师阿奈斯·马西洛 (Anais Masiello) 说。 “支持的话很容易得到，但我非常清楚[我的工作能力下降]已经变得多么沉重，这让我感到孤立。”&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;诸如“你会打败这个”之类的变幻莫测的内容通常也不受欢迎。另外，当您不了解所有细节时，承诺或暗示完全康复是不合适的。 “与‘你已经拿到了！’相比，一条真诚、有用的短信意义重大，”市警察局发言人凯西·利宁 (Casey Liening) 说。这里还有一种隐含的、常常不被重视的情绪在起作用：癌症患者是“战士”，他们将战胜体内的敌人。当然，这不是癌症治疗的原理，这种情绪实际上可能会产生相反的效果，尤其是当事情感觉特别具有挑战性时：“这让我感觉自己很虚弱，不够坚强，”埃利松多说。&lt;/span >;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;要避免的另一个陷阱：避免主动提供建议。 “这不是被要求或需要的，”利宁说。 “当我第一次得知我的治疗不包括手术、化疗或放射时，我一定告诉了工作中的人。这引发了一个谣言，说我选择不接受任何类型的治疗，”她说。同事们分享他们的想法是非常不受欢迎的&lt;/span>;&lt;i>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;非常&lt;/span>;&lt;/i>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>; 。在这种可能危及生命的经历中告诉某人如何感觉、做什么或对他们的健康做出假设既是不必要的，而且毫无疑问是没有帮助的。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;虽然担心同事的工作量及其对您的影响是可以理解的，但这些想法需要退居第二位。他们的福祉和健康必须放在第一位，而不是他们完成工作的能力。 “对于感到压力的同事来说，我也有压力，&lt;/span>;&lt;i>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;加上&lt;/span>;&lt;/i>;&lt;span style =&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;化疗、化疗脑、更年期脑，以及转移性癌症带来的所有担忧和经济压力，”Elizondo 说。 “我很惊讶自己做得这么好，但有时我想提醒我的老板我正在处理&lt;/span>;&lt;i>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;这个&lt;/span>;&lt;i>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>; span>;&lt;/i>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>; 最重要的是，所以他们让我放松了一点。但我也不想要一张怜悯卡或一个“特殊”的叙述。这是一把双刃剑。”&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;支持患有乳腺癌的同事的更好方法&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;最重要的事情？ “跟随他们的领导，”莱昂斯说。有些人愿意敞开心扉，有些人则不愿意。对于一些人来说，他们的工作生活可能为他们提供了远离癌症现实生活的避风港，他们可能不想谈论癌症及其带来的一切——如果是这样，请尊重这一点。 （哈里斯民意调查发现，40% 的受访者表示，他们继续工作是为了感觉“尽可能正常”。）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;也就是说，我们要求采访的女性分享她们实际感受到的例子&lt;/span>;&lt;i>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;感受&lt;/span>;&lt;/i>;&lt;span style =&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>; 在工作中提供支持，帮助指导您的行动。帕肯讲述了一位同事寄给她的一张卡片。 “里面写着‘我很抱歉这件事发生在你身上。’”这很简单，是的，但“这些话就像一股新鲜空气，”她说。 “我最终从其他人那里得到的是同理心，而不是同情。”当这些词感觉具体而不是笼统时，马谢洛同样很欣赏。马谢洛说，真诚的关怀之词看起来像是“你的力量是鼓舞人心的，我只是希望你不必这么坚强”，或者注意到她接受治疗的那天早上说“再来一次！” “所有这些小动作都意义重大，”她说。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;远离迂腐的陈词滥调，而是对同事的关注确切的情况表明理解并传达关怀。 “一位同事对我说过的让我永远不会忘记的一件事是‘第四阶段并不是死刑，’”Liening 说。 “这意味着更多一点，因为有时确实感觉就是这样。微妙地提醒人们保持积极态度总是很有启发性的。”虽然这些情绪和更一般的反应之间的界限对于那些自己没有经历过癌症的人来说可能并不明显，但它们之间存在数量级的差异。在列宁的例子中，评论者既知道也记得有关她的诊断的具体信息，并且在支持和有毒阳性之间保持着微妙的界限：没有热情洋溢的承诺，只有在事实和个人经历中的深思熟虑。然而，值得一提的是，并不是每个人都想要&lt;/span>;&lt;i>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;想要&lt;/span>;&lt;/i>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>; ”>; 积极性。有时，只是重申“这太糟糕了”就令人振奋。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;Parcon 也喜欢同事签到，因为这让她不必自愿更新。马谢洛的同事们纷纷采取行动，这是另一种具体的帮助方式：“有同事简单地处理事情，而我不必担心，这是最有帮助的事情。他们不希望我在治疗或手术期间担心我的工作。我让同事告诉我我错过的任何电话或会议，这样我就不会感觉自己被排除在外，”她说。 “我被鼓励尽可能多地抽出时间，并且知道在我不在的时候总会有人为我提供帮助。同事们先发制人地介入，代表我处理事情，并认真检查我的表现。”Masiello 说。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-体重：400；&quot;>;莱昂斯表示，这对于创建支持性文化大有帮助——你越积极主动，癌症患者的负担就越轻。毕竟，“如果我能做点什么，请告诉我”有多少次会遭到沉默？当涉及到工作量和与工作相关的任务时，只需&lt;/span>;&lt;i>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;做&lt;/span>;&lt;/i>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400 ;&quot;>;有事，别问。图书馆主管杰西卡·赛德纳 (Jessica Sidener) 表示，她的同事们做的最出乎意料的周到的事情之一就是协助她确定任务的优先顺序。 “当我做得太多时，我的同事们会友善而明确地让我知道，并帮助我确定待办事项、义务和责任的优先顺序，尤其是当我感到不知所措而无法独自处理它们时，”她解释道。 “对于那些确实有紧迫感的任务，他们想出了如何介入。”&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;这种感觉社区也可以提供安慰。 “我的同事们的总体态度是&lt;/span>;&lt;i>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;我们&lt;/span>;&lt;/i>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;会渡过难关，而&lt;/span>;&lt;i>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;你&lt;/span>;&lt;/i>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;会渡过难关这个，”西德纳说。当她的同事为她举办筹款活动并表示“没有人孤军奋战”时，列宁也感受到了这种团结感。她说：“这最令人惊奇地提醒我，我的支持系统有多么庞大。”&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;重要的是请记住，您的同事可能面临的恐惧不一定有时间范围，因此支持也不应该有时间范围。虽然您的同事可能会结束治疗，宣布病情缓解，并看似康复，但“治疗后会出现挑战，”莱昂斯说。那些已经战胜癌症、现在从技术上讲已经“站在癌症的另一边”的人将面临复发的恐惧，面临长达数年的日常药物治疗及其副作用，以及与肿瘤科医生的后续预约，可能会与身体的全面恢复作斗争。疤痕，并可能会经历令人衰弱的疲惫。&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;乳腺癌通常并不快速或简单。它不会用弓绑起来。人们在未来的几年里都要应对后遗症。持续的检查所带来的同情心——“你感觉怎么样？”或“对你来说，生存是什么样的？” ——可能是无价的。 &lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;&lt;br>; &lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;&lt;br>; &lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font -weight: 400;&quot;>;最后，值得注意的是，遵循此建议并不能保证不会犯错或发表令您患有癌症的同事感到受伤的评论。而且您可能并不总是知道您的想法、评论或行动何时或是否以这种方式被接受。但这并不是停止出现或避开同事的理由——消失的行为可能是最痛苦的。 Humility, a willingness to be corrected, and a continued effort to make your colleague feel cared for are your greatest assets — use them. “It really does help to be able to be open, and have [that openness] met with love,” says Masiello. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;

&lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;In the final episode of the season, HBR editor Adi Ignatius interviews Jason Buechel, the CEO of Whole Foods. Buechel discusses the challenges of succeeding a larger-than-life executive, the role of Whole Foods as a subsidiary of Amazon, and how the company is addressing changes in the business environment, such as climate change and hybrid work. Buechel emphasizes the importance of understanding the voice of team members during a leadership transition and being authentic as a leader. He also highlights Whole Foods&amp;#8217; focus on growth opportunities for employees and its commitment to sustainability. Buechel believes that AI will fundamentally change the retail and grocery shopping experience in the next decade. The episode concludes with Buechel sharing his favorite products from Whole Foods.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/whole-foods-ceo-jason-buechel-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-of-following-a-visionary-leader?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/whole-foods-ceo-jason-buechel-on-the-challenges-and-opportunities-of-following-a-visionary-leader?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;Jason Buechel, the CEO of Whole Foods, faced a unique challenge when he took over from cofounder John Mackey, who had been the company&#39;s CEO for 42 years. Buechel, who became CEO in 2022, had the opportunity to work closely with Mackey for nine years and had an 11-month transition period to prepare for the role. However, stepping into the shoes of a larger-than-life executive like Mackey was not only a personal challenge but a significant adjustment for Whole Foods employees, from the C-suite to the hundreds of local stores.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Buechel recognized the importance of connecting with the team members, addressing their concerns, and assuring them that the company&#39;s culture, quality standards, and core values would remain intact under his leadership. He emphasized the need for authenticity and being true to oneself while also supporting the company&#39;s vision and direction.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For this episode of our video series “The New World of Work”, HBR editor in chief Adi Ignatius sat down with Buechel to discuss:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;How authenticity is crucial in leadership and sustainability efforts, as companies need to ensure their actions align with their core values and mission&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;How focusing on the happiness, growth, and development of employees not only leads to higher employee retention but improves customers&#39; experience&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;While CEO roles can vary depending on the company, for Buechel the focus is primarily on internal leadership and supporting the vision and growth of the organization&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;“&lt;a href=&quot;/insight-center/the-new-world-of-work&quot;>;The New World of Work&lt;/a>;” explores how top-tier executives see the future and how their companies are trying to set themselves up for success. Each week, Ignatius talks to a top leader on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/company/harvard-business-review/&quot;>;LinkedIn Live&lt;/a>; — previous interviews included &lt;a href=&quot;/2021/10/microsofts-satya-nadella-on-flexible-work-the-metaverse-and-the-power-of-empathy&quot;>;Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella&lt;/a>; and &lt;a href=&quot;/2021/11/indra-nooyi-former-ceo-of-pepsico-on-nurturing-talent-in-turbulent-times&quot;>;former PepsiCo CEO Indra Nooyi&lt;/a>;.

Let&#39;s start with your transition to CEO. It&#39;s always interesting how a founder CEO transitions to the next generation of leadership. Talk about that challenge and what you&#39;ve tried to bring to that role.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;JASON BUECHEL:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One of the fortunes I had was working with John [Mackey] over the course of nine years and had about an 11-month timeframe to do our transition. It was a great opportunity for me to be able to jump into the role. I had a lot of great support from John where he really wanted me to help take on some of those responsibilities over the course of the 11 months. I was prepared when my day was to step formally into the role.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Stepping into shoes like that is also a really difficult process for our team members. John was our CEO for 42 years, and ultimately that&#39;s what they knew. For me, it was really important to connect with our team members, make sure that we could provide a vision and that they understood the elements of Whole Foods Market, our culture, our core values, our higher purpose. They were going to remain intact, and my job was to help take those responsibilities and support us being able to keep Whole Foods and the important elements intact.&lt;/p>; &lt;hbr-component type=&quot;newsletter&quot; name=&quot;The New World of Work&quot;>; &lt;div>; &lt;follow-subscribe data-name=&quot;hbpnewworldofwork&quot; data-activity=&quot;newsletter&quot;>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div style=&quot;color: #000000&quot;>; &lt;svg>; &lt;use xlink:href=&quot;/resources/css/images/hbr-icons.svg#the-new-world-of-work&quot;>;&lt;/use>; &lt;/svg>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; Subscribe to our Weekly Newsletter &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; The New World of Work &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; Candid conversations on talent, tech, and the future of business.

You&#39;re not the first and you won&#39;t be the last to succeed an iconic CEO who&#39;s been in place for many years. What&#39;s your advice to people who are in your role and coming in? What have you learned from the process that you&#39;d like to share?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;JASON BUECHEL:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It&#39;s important to understand the voice of the team members. What are they looking for in that transition and what&#39;s important for them? For me, I took an opportunity over those 11 months to do something we call the Whole Conversations Tour, which gave me some great insights for what was on the mind of our team members.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In some cases, they had fears with John&#39;s retirement of whether there are going to be major changes to our culture or our quality standards? What are things going to look like going forward? For our stakeholders, whether it was suppliers or customers, community partners, I think it&#39;s important to understand the voice of all of those stakeholders as you&#39;re making the transition.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I think the other part I would give advice on is making sure that you&#39;re not just trying to be that leader. For me, John and I, we lead in very different ways and that&#39;s why we were so complementary in working together.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It&#39;s also about being authentic to yourself and at the same time making sure that you&#39;re supporting the company and where it needs to go.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Your path to CEO is not typical. Maybe no one&#39;s is, but yours in particular isn&#39;t. Talk about your past and your life and career and how it ended up in this role?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;JASON BUECHEL:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I&#39;ve had the opportunity to work in retail since 2000. My first set of experiences really came through consulting. I worked for Accenture and had an opportunity to work with a lot of leading retailers and grocers, both here in the US and around the world. It was that passion I had in working within the retail space.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;That career allowed me to connect with several executives at Whole Foods Market, our former Co-CEO, Walter Robb and CFO, Glenda Flanagan. As they were looking to hire a new CIO or CTO, they had reached out to me. I had provided some names of some clients that I thought would be good folks to go for the job, and they reached back out and said, “Why aren&#39;t you putting your name on? We&#39;d really love for you to consider joining Whole Foods.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I came to Austin, spent two days here, and just really had an amazing appreciation for the fact that the higher purpose and core values weren&#39;t just words on a wall. They were being lived out day-to-day. That was the awakening that this is the right place for me to go work and spend the rest of my career.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As I joined Whole Foods, I was responsible for technology as well as our digital businesses. Helping stand up both our delivery and pickup businesses, which we hadn&#39;t yet launched. During that timeframe, I also helped looked at ways for us to establish some organizations and support practices we didn&#39;t have before like our first operations support team.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As I spent more time at Whole Foods, I picked up additional responsibilities in areas like team-member services (what other companies would call HR), and eventually stepped into the chief operating officer role in January of 2019. And going through that role really helped prepare me in taking the next step up to the CEO position.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I was thinking about your past even before that. When I first got in contact with your staff, they said “He&#39;s a cheese guy. You have to understand that.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;JASON BUECHEL:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Absolutely. I&#39;ve had a long connection to food, been gardening since I was seven. My dad actually was a cheese maker. Both of my parents grew up on dairy farms. I was in rural Wisconsin and just have an interesting connection to our food systems and couldn&#39;t be happier to have the opportunity today to be in a role where I can help influence and support our food systems for future generations.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What does it mean for Whole Foods to report up to a giant, Amazon.com?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;JASON BUECHEL:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We are very privileged in a number of ways. First and foremost, one of the things we&#39;ve been really excited about over the last six years is we&#39;re really focused on the long-term of Whole Foods Market and being able to have the support of Amazon providing us with capabilities that allow us to serve our customer in the most amazing ways possible. Whether it&#39;s through technology or other services, being able to help create great customer experiences is one of the things that Amazon has been helpful with.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Also, we&#39;re helping redefine what grocery is going to look like in this space. Having a parent company that has resources and expertise that we can plug into and utilize to support Whole Foods is really important.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I also appreciate the same things where we&#39;re able to be Whole Foods and maintain our culture. I mentioned earlier we still have the same higher purpose and core values. While we&#39;re part of Amazon, it&#39;s really a complementary relationship where we bring the very best of what we can offer and we&#39;re able to plug in and leverage the very best within Amazon.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I think we have emotional connections to the brands that we like. What do you say to people who love the Whole Foods brand and its brand promise, but don&#39;t feel the same emotion toward Amazon?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;JASON BUECHEL:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In some cases it&#39;s helping those customers understand some of the benefits that they can use, that Amazon can support them as well. Whether it&#39;s providing a quicker checkout in one of our stores using Amazon One, or ultimately some of the support and work, where we&#39;re collaboratively looking at ways by which we&#39;re going to help meet our environmental and sustainability commitments.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;That&#39;s something a lot of our customers care about and something we&#39;re able to leverage as Whole Foods and supporting our core value around the environment.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What do you see as Whole Foods&#39; biggest challenges? Is it simply to grow as quickly as possible, to add new stores? Or do you think about it in some other way?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;JASON BUECHEL:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It&#39;s really figuring out how we expand our reach and impact. One of the ways we&#39;ll do that obviously is adding new stores, but it&#39;s also finding new ways that we can serve customers.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One of the things we launched earlier this year is the ability to have items directly shipped to our customer&#39;s homes through Amazon. We currently have over 800 products available within our exclusive brands, our 365 brand as an example. That&#39;s something we can serve more customers in new ways.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We&#39;re also really focused on ways we can help support our higher purpose in nourishing people on the planet. It&#39;s not just growth for growth&#39;s sake, but how do we help be the force for change?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One of the things I&#39;m really passionate about is regenerative agriculture. This is an opportunity that&#39;s ultimately going to allow us to take the products that we know and love today and make sure that we can continue to produce those for future generations.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For people who aren&#39;t familiar with the idea of regenerative products or agriculture, what does that that mean?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;JASON BUECHEL:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is an area where I think a lot of consumers don&#39;t understand that our current topsoil continues to lose the nutrients that it needs to produce the products that we know and love. Regenerative is about not only helping bring those nutrients back into the soil, but help in a sustainable way. To make sure that we can continue to support our soil and the broader biological environments not only to continue to produce the products that we know and love today, but ultimately create an ecosystem where it&#39;s not as disruptive as what we&#39;re seeing today. How do we make sure that we can partner with our suppliers so they can support these practices and be an advocate for them?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One of the things I&#39;m really proud of is that we&#39;ve already launched three regenerative products under our own exclusive brands to help take that leadership position. One of my personal favorites is our green lentils under our Whole Foods Market brand, a great product. And it&#39;s one of the very first certified regenerative products from a private label perspective on the market.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Your strategy, if I understand it, seems essentially still to be primarily a brick and mortar one. Do you feel the need to become more of an e-tailer going forward?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;JASON BUECHEL:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The reality is we are an e-tailer today. Whether you are having products delivered to your house, you&#39;re picking them up in one of our stores, you&#39;re getting some of our exclusive brand products like our 365 products shipped directly to your home: we&#39;re already playing in that space. I continue to see that we&#39;ll have opportunities both in the physical experience as well as online.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A lot of our customers like to shop through multiple different channels. In some cases they&#39;d like to have center of store picked for them and ready for them to pick it up when they shop the store, and then look at our perimeter, whether it&#39;s picking out their own meat or seafood or interacting with our team members. As an example, at our cheese case, a certified cheese professional can help choose exactly the right cheeses as you&#39;re putting together your cheeseboard and charcuterie plates.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So fast-forward, not way into the future, but a year or two or three. How do you think the in-store experience will change for Whole Foods customers?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;JASON BUECHEL:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We&#39;re going to continue to find ways to help simplify and make things easier for our customers. One of the things our customers find value in is our ability to help save them time. In some cases, as I mentioned earlier, delivery and pickup help support that. We want to be able to find ways that customers can find products in the store faster. How can we better provide the expertise across all the different areas within our stores so customers can make sure we&#39;re supporting the amazing events and dinners they&#39;re helping prepare for their family and loved ones, and ultimately, checking out faster in our stores?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There&#39;s a lot of things we&#39;re making investments on where technology will support things, and investments into our team-member experience, to make sure that our team members can best serve our customers and help save them time.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I want to go to an audience question. This is from Holly who&#39;s in Boston. Do you have any recommendations for how companies can best develop an internal leader to be the next CEO, including maybe external development programs?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;JASON BUECHEL:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One of the things I&#39;m really, really proud of is the investment we put into our team member experience and focus around internal growth and development. We had over 11,000 promotions over the last 12 months, which I&#39;m so proud of.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, when I look at my executive team, two of my direct reports actually started in our stores part-time. Our head of operations, Bill Jordan, as an example, joined through Mrs. Gooch&#39;s [Natural Food Markets], which was one of our acquisitions. He&#39;s worked across almost every part of our stores, multiple regions, and now leads operations reporting directly to me for all of Whole Foods Market.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We&#39;re making big investments into career development programs. We do this for our major leadership positions within the organization. Just yesterday, I was actually doing the keynote graduation ceremony for our store team leader career development program which is focused on a six-month period, helping make sure our team members are ready to take that next step up.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For our most senior leadership positions, we&#39;ve helped cross-pollinate and have leaders work across multiple different parts of the company. That was something I was privileged to be part of, being able to lead multiple different functions before stepping into this role.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One of the other things that&#39;s really unique for us is both for our executive team and something we call WFLN, which is the Whole Foods Market Leadership Network, built of our 19 most senior leaders. We collectively work together across all different facets. Folks are helping participate in work in parts of the company they may not lead. For us, it&#39;s really making sure we&#39;re working together as a team and helping make sure we&#39;re bringing some of those experiences and expertise across our entire leadership team.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I&#39;m also really proud of the fact that 50% of the group I just mentioned grew up in our stores, and so that expertise of knowing Whole Foods and being able to build a career in a functional area is something we&#39;re really proud of.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Let&#39;s shift gears a little bit. This is another audience question, from Punjab, Pakistan, and it&#39;s about hybrid work. How do you manage the fact that your frontline workers need to be there full-time in the stores, versus white collar workers who are able to work hybrid? How do you balance that?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;JASON BUECHEL:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We&#39;ve done a return to office where our store support team members are required to be in the office three days a week, but ultimately many of them also have to spend time in our stores or in our facilities, helping connect with team members.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One of the things that&#39;s been an important part of our vision is something I call store-centricity, in making sure that every single one of our store support team members has a connection to our stores. We ultimately have included it in something we call our job-dialogue process, which is part of our performance management process, on setting the expectation, and ultimately having team members talk about the things they&#39;ve done over the course of the last 12 months to connect with our stores, and what those experiences have taught them.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We&#39;ve also built some programs around our senior leadership and other leaders that we have within our store support group, and actually pairing them with stores and partnering up with our store team leaders, and finding ways that we can better support our stores, and ultimately making sure that we can bring those experiences where our store support team members really understand everything that&#39;s happening day-to-day in a store, what it takes to lead a store, and how do we help improve our team member and customer experiences in the work that we do.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To build on that, you used the phrase before, the theater of retail. I love that term. When you think about Whole Foods, the Whole Foods experience, what is your theater of retail?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;JASON BUECHEL:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For so many of our customers, they&#39;re coming to Whole Foods as an oasis, to get out of the hectic day-to-day life, you know? One of my favorite examples of that is our Manhattan West store, located in Hudson Yards in Manhattan, and you get off the busy street and you walk in the store, and it&#39;s just an immediate sense of Zen. For me, we want to be able to create this oasis for customers, bring the theater of retail.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We want our customers to have sensory overloads in the experiences they have, as they&#39;re walking into produce, the smells that they&#39;re having, the beautiful merchandising that they&#39;re seeing, the demos of products that we&#39;re doing in the store. We can be at our very best when we&#39;re helping bring this theater to life for our customers, because it&#39;s one of the reasons they&#39;re coming to our stores.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We have a question from Reno, Nevada in the US. How does Whole Foods think about the phenomenon of food deserts. You aren&#39;t everywhere. You&#39;re in markets that can sustain it. How do you think about the food desert issue, at least in the US, and whether there&#39;s anything you can do to alleviate that.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;JASON BUECHEL:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is one of the areas we&#39;ve actually made investments in and have tried to find ways to support those who might be underserved or don&#39;t have access to some of the highest quality products we sell at Whole Foods Market. We have an entire foundation that we call &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wholecitiesfoundation.org/about/&quot;>;Whole Cities&lt;/a>;, which has been dedicated to some of these efforts, in not only having us establish stores, but ultimately investing in communities through a lot of different programs that can help bring access to food in these underserved communities.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Here&#39;s a question from London in the UK. Having followed a very dynamic, well-profiled CEO, how do you think about the role of the CEO? Does it need to be a very public-facing role, or not necessarily?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;JASON BUECHEL:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It really depends upon the company. You know, are you public or private? In our case, we are a subsidiary, and for me, the most important role that I have is internal from that perspective. Obviously, having responsibilities external allows us to support our stakeholders as well, so when I look at the time that I spend, it&#39;s probably 80% on the internal side of things, and in the 20% I&#39;m spending external, it&#39;s really trying to help connect with and support our stakeholders.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I give a great example on this with our suppliers. How do we help bring a voice into other organizations, folks within government, around some of the work that we need to do to help support our farmers and our suppliers and ranchers?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It&#39;s figuring out that right balance, but the responsibility I personally have is serving as our internal leader, and making sure that our team members understand the vision that we have as an organization. I&#39;m spending time directly in our stores, connecting with our team members, making sure that they understand where we are going, and making sure we can get feedback. My job is to be a servant leader in serving our stores. One of the things I really have tried to do is set the tone across the entire organization of us being store-centric.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When we launched our new vision, growing with purpose, in January, one of the commitments we made is that every single one of our stores is being visited by a member of our executive team. There&#39;s eight of us, so for our 535+ stores, we&#39;re spending a lot of time on this road show this year, connecting with our team members, making sure they understand where we&#39;re going and getting their feedback of what they&#39;re seeing. It&#39;s helping us improve and elevate many of the priorities and initiatives we&#39;re doing across the organization.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I don&#39;t think we&#39;ve been through a show this year without talking about generative AI. We have a question from Tampa, Florida, which is just how do you think about AI and how it can, or maybe already is, changing the grocery shopping experience?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;JASON BUECHEL:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It&#39;s going to fundamentally change retail and grocery over the course of the next 10 years. To go into one of your earlier questions, this is one of the great things about being a subsidiary of Amazon as well, and being able to leverage capabilities on this side.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When I think about how we work, things are going to change. You know, the role of a merchant, which is very much at the center of retail in how you select product, decisions that you&#39;re going to be making around assortment, and pricing, and merchandising. We&#39;re going to have additional insights and toolsets that AI is going to really influence.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I think about all of the different, amazing things that this is going to provide for customers as well, whether it&#39;s helping build out a shopping list, to helping select products that you&#39;re going to bring together for an amazing meal or experience that you&#39;re preparing for, to helping provide discovery. I think there&#39;s going to be so many different applications in how this is going to make things easier, better, and more impactful for our customers, and at the same time, allowing us to raise the bar on how we look at things like assortment and all of the key things that we do in bringing the experiences to our customers.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;You&#39;ve talked a couple times about sustainability, and I know that&#39;s a big priority for you. How does a company go from wanting generally to do the right thing in terms of climate change, in terms of sustainability, to really making it fundamental?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;JASON BUECHEL:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First and foremost, it&#39;s important to be authentic. For us, within our core values, the environment has always played a role. The work that we&#39;ve done in supporting the organic movement is an example, which has been the leading climate-friendly agricultural practice over the last several decades. It&#39;s always been part and parcel around how we can make sure that this is authentically connected to the work we&#39;re doing. For us it&#39;s easy, because it ties to our higher purpose of nourishing people on the planet.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When it comes down to doing things just for the sake of hitting metrics and goals, when you&#39;re not thinking about how this ties to why you&#39;re doing it, I think you have to take a step back and really understand, “How does this actually connect to the company&#39;s vision, and the mission, and the goals that we&#39;re trying to do?” If it&#39;s not authentically there, understand the changes that you need to make within the organization to make sure that it is. That would be my top piece of advice.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Here&#39;s a question from Ontario, Canada, about retention: what strategies has the company implemented to retain employees?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;JASON BUECHEL:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One of the top things is providing growth opportunities for our team members. I mentioned a little bit earlier we had 11,000 promotions over the last 12 months. One of the things that&#39;s important about doing that is providing ways by which we can help support our team members&#39; growth and happiness.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One area I&#39;m excited about is an apprentice program. We currently have three live, a Butcher Apprentice program, a Certified Cheese Professional, and a Bakery Decorator Apprentice. We&#39;re going to be rolling this out so each one of our departments and teams has an apprentice program going forward. This allows team members to develop skills and trades they can use at Whole Foods Market and elsewhere in their life.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It&#39;s not only great for the team member, but it&#39;s great for our customers: our customers are actually coming to Whole Foods Market for the great expertise and experience we can provide. By having things like this in place, it makes sure that our team members are supported in taking those next steps for growth within the company.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I mentioned a little bit earlier the career development programs we do. We do this throughout our entire organization, so we&#39;ve got programs from multiple levels within our store, around store leadership as an example. Team members not only see their current next-step opportunities, but they see the growth and support they&#39;re going to have at future levels as well.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One other area that I&#39;m proud of is something called Cultivate. It&#39;s a mentoring program that we have in place, and this is very unique to Whole Foods Market. Most other retailers might offer this type of program for their store team leader or store leadership. We open up all this for our team members so they have opportunities to connect with other folks to get supporting, coaching, mentoring experiences.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I have a great example of connecting the two where we have a team member, Marie in Hawaii, who&#39;s connected with a mentor who&#39;s in Boston, and the experience that she&#39;s able to have virtually in a wonderful way to learn things that allow her not only to grow, but bring new experiences into her store. Examples like that have team members not only connected to Whole Foods, but knowing that they&#39;re supported for an entire career they can have with us.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We&#39;re almost out of time, but I want to ask the cliche question you probably get all the time. When I interviewed Howard Schultz when he was CEO of Starbucks, I had to ask, what does he order when he walks up to the barista. So when you shop Whole Foods, what&#39;s in your basket? What are some of your favorites?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;JASON BUECHEL:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Well, every shop is a little bit different depending upon what I&#39;m preparing for. When I&#39;m going through produce, I&#39;m always picking up bananas, blueberries, avocado. At our seafood counter, I&#39;m looking at whatever&#39;s coming fresh. I love our salmon. It&#39;s one of my favorite products. In meat, it&#39;s the ribeye. In cheese, I&#39;m looking to see what artisan cheeses we have in place. Current favorites right now are Uplands and Jasper Hill as far as producers. The Harbison is actually one of my personal favorites. In our prepared foods, I hit the salad bar almost daily for lunch. And in center store, I&#39;m always trying to check out whatever store I&#39;m in, what are the local products? Local is a really important part of Whole Foods Market, so I love discovering new local favorites in whatever store I&#39;m at.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I assume your certified cheese professional gets a little nervous when you walk up and ask what they&#39;ve got?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;JASON BUECHEL:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Not at all, because they know that I&#39;m excited about a great conversation we&#39;re going to have on some of their favorites. And usually it involves tasting a few samples as well, so always a great experience.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;All right, well Jason, I want to thank you for being on the show. It&#39;s really great to hear your thoughts, and thank you for being here.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;JASON BUECHEL:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Thanks for having me.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 30 Sep 2023 02:55:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[The Next Supply-Chain Challenge Isn&rsquo;t a Shortage &mdash; It&rsquo;s Inventory Glut]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/09/the-next-supply-chain-challenge-isnt-a-shortage-its-inventory-glut]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/09/Sep23_29_594832575.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;Halfdark/Getty Images&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;Inventory challenges aren&amp;#8217;t new. Electronics littered shelves in 2001 after the dot-com bubble burst. In 2009, the financial crash left manufacturers with excess inventory when consumer buying power suddenly dropped. And now, the high-tech industry is feeling the weight of a volatile market that has led to excess component inventory. Measuring inventory momentum can help leaders address the problem. It&amp;#8217;sa forward-looking metric based on the classic momentum equation: current inventory x rate of inventory change.&amp;#160;Once leaders understand their inventory momentum, they can take actions to reduce excess inventory, stem the rate of inventory change, and prevent the situation from happening in the future.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/the-next-supply-chain-challenge-isnt-a-shortage-its-inventory-glut?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/the-next-supply-chain-challenge-isnt-a-shortage-its-inventory-glut?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;It&#39;s March 2020. Store shelves sit empty, without any toilet paper or cleaning supplies in sight. Tablets and electronic devices are out of stock. Consumers are clamoring for the basics they need to suddenly work and learn from home and live under quarantine. Meanwhile, on Zoom calls and in email threads, company leaders around the world are racing to put in giant orders with their suppliers to speed up supply-chain lags and get products to customers. In the supply-and-demand equation, demand seems infinite.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Now, three-plus years later, we&#39;re seeing the stark aftereffects of that spike in demand. After the race to order key components and manufacture products, suppliers are left with mountains of excess inventory as growth has slowed to normal levels. In the tech industry, it&#39;s common for warehouses to be &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/28/how-the-world-went-from-a-semiconductor-shortage-to-a-major-glut.html&quot;>;full of now-outdated semiconductors&lt;/a>; and other technology components. When those components were ordered, they were in hot demand. Now, companies are dispositioning excess electronic components (selling them at lower prices, scrapping them, using them in alternate products, and trying to sell them back to suppliers) to get them off their balance sheets.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Beyond the obvious environmental cost, an inventory glut of high-end electronics components is an expensive problem. Excess inventory is a $250+ billion problem in the US alone, according to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kearney.com/industry/technology/article/-/insights/how-can-high-tech-companies-digest-250-billion-in-inventory&quot;>;2023 Kearney study&lt;/a>;. On a global scale, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.census.gov/mtis/www/data/pdf/mtis_current.pdf&quot;>;US census data&lt;/a>; shows excess inventory amounts to trillions of dollars. Someone pays for all that extra inventory.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;And this problem isn&#39;t a pandemic-era anomaly. New demand spikes are coming our way — you only have to consider the seemingly “infinite” demand for electric vehicle batteries or the boom of chipsets that drive AI-powered technology to see how similar cycles could play out in the near future.&lt;/p>; &lt;article-promo>; &lt;hbr-component type=&quot;promo&quot; is-insight=&quot;insight-center&quot; title=&quot;The New Age of Operations&quot; dek=&quot;Improving efficiency and increasing resilience.&quot; cta-text=&quot;&quot; href=&quot;/insight-center/the-new-age-of-operations&quot;>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/insight-center/the-new-age-of-operations&quot; style=&quot;color:black;text-decoration:none&quot;>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; Insight Center Collection &lt;/div>; &lt;h3>;The New Age of Operations&lt;/h3>; &lt;div>; Improving efficiency and increasing resilience. &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hbr-component>; &lt;/article-promo>; &lt;p>;As we look ahead at a new age of operations, leaders have the opportunity to address the current inventory problem and be stewards of a healthy, sustainable industry ecosystem. Players in every part of the value chain (from component suppliers to manufacturers) have a key role in preventing this kind of waste in the future. We see the opportunity for forward-thinking leaders to blaze a trail, modeling a more sustainable way of collaborating for shared success.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;How Inventory Gluts Occur&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Inventory challenges aren&#39;t new. Electronics littered shelves in 2001 after the dot-com bubble burst. Then, in 2009, the financial crash left manufacturers with excess inventory when consumer buying power suddenly dropped. And now, the high-tech industry is feeling the weight of a volatile market that has led to excess component inventory.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Excess inventory can happen at any part of the supply chain. Here&#39;s a hypothetical example: As cloud computing booms, a company selling servers (also known as an original equipment manufacturer or OEM) gets a giant order for server equipment. The OEM, in turn, sends an order to their contract manufacturer for this server. (“We need as many as you can make!”) The contract manufacturer starts sourcing all of the parts they need to make those servers, including two kinds of semiconductors (we&#39;ll call them “A” and “B” semiconductors). The contract manufacturer searches high and low for those semiconductors; getting the parts could take a year. Once all the parts are finally in hand, surprise! The original order has changed. The technology has advanced, and the demand has shifted. Now those same servers use “B” and “C” semiconductors. The contract manufacturer is stuck with warehouses full of the outdated semiconductors “A” and excess quantities of “B,” creating a very expensive and very wasteful problem.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The key problem is in the original order. Demand is never actually “infinite” or fully predictable given technology changes. Every manufacturer must creatively collaborate with their customers to understand realistic demand for what they will manufacture. There&#39;s also an opportunity for suppliers, manufacturers, and distributors to creatively work together to return components that do not get used and get them in the hands of someone who needs them.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;How One Manufacturer Is Turning the Tide on Excess Inventory&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Let&#39;s look at how one contract manufacturer we have worked with is managing the problem of excess inventory. The manufacturer&#39;s excess inventory was steadily inching toward unsustainable levels, while external factors like increasing interest rates created an intractable problem.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Company leaders started applying the concept of “Inventory Momentum,” a forward-looking metric based on the classic momentum equation: current inventory x rate of inventory change. In other words, having a large inventory isn&#39;t a problem. But when the inventory rate increases, the combined momentum creates a major headache. And when you&#39;re talking about billions of dollars in electronic components that have an expiration date driven by technology transitions, the headache is expensive.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Once they understood their inventory momentum, the leadership team took five key actions to reduce excess inventory, stem the rate of inventory change, and prevent the situation from happening in the future:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;They reduced incoming materials.&lt;/strong>; Instead of ordering all components in advance, the company only ordered the components needed to make finished goods in the short term. The procurement teams delayed orders for components that would not be immediately used in manufacturing.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;They set more accurate planning parameters.&lt;/strong>; Investing in real-time systems provided stakeholders with information on how much inventory they had across all factories and suppliers&#39; books. This data allowed the company to simulate changes to inventory levels when planning parameters like lead time, safety stock levels, and minimum order quantities.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;They disposed of excess and obsolete inventory. &lt;/strong>;The company collaborated with suppliers and distributors to find alternative customers for stranded components.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;They collaborated with their customers. &lt;/strong>;Leaders worked out agreements with customers that if orders changed, the company wouldn&#39;t get stuck with excess components — and arranged working capital advances to get paid in advance for critical materials. Customers could optimize their consumption of excess components by modifying product lifecycles or working with suppliers to design alternative applications.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;They prioritized revenue for customers. &lt;/strong>;By prioritizing customers with a backlog of large orders, they maximized customer revenues by building the mix of products where components were already on hand.&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;The results: The company reduced the total inventory number by more than 10% in just a few short weeks and reduced inventory momentum.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Creating a More Sustainable Inventory Ecosystem&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;This real-world example isn&#39;t an outlier — it&#39;s the canary in the coal mine. The liability of excess inventory affects every business in the value chain. To create a more sustainable environment, every business needs to start thinking differently about the burden of excess inventory.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To start, leaders must reconsider the narrative of “infinite” demand. Every demand spike will eventually end in an inventory glut. It&#39;s up to the companies placing orders to temper that demand with a dose of reality.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If suppliers maximize revenues and OEMs order more than what they can reasonably sell, contract manufactures get stuck in the middle. That dynamic isn&#39;t healthy or sustainable. Value chain partners like OEMs, contract manufacturers, and suppliers need to be aligned on optimizing inventory. Suppliers should be able to redistribute excess components that are still perfectly useful for another application. Getting products into the hands of people who need them is ultimately good for everyone.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Finally, as new industries emerge, prioritize creating healthy ecosystems from the start. The growing realm of AI represents a major opportunity for high-tech manufacturers — but it&#39;s also an opportunity to build a healthy ecosystem. To do so, we can&#39;t assume an “infinite” demand for AI-powered applications. The same is true of the electric vehicle industry. If the ecosystem over-produces parts for EVs, there&#39;s a high risk those parts will be outdated or unusable by the time demand eventually materializes.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Inventory management is a critical problem that should be on the radar of anyone in an industry with volatile demand and long lead times. And it requires a careful, collective solution. No single company stands alone. Instead, we&#39;d all be well served to consider the broader business ecosystem, making decisions that will serve our bottom lines and the health of all the companies connected to us.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;em>;Acknowledgments: The author would like to thank Ben T.

But that&amp;#8217;s not the only reason they struggle during downturns, according to new research &amp;#8212; they also have a tougher time hiring. That&amp;#8217;s because job seekers prefer safer options and so are more likely to apply for jobs at incumbent firms. This, alongside the difficulty fundraising, makes growth even tougher for startups during recessions.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/research-in-recessions-employees-avoid-jobs-with-startups?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/research-in-recessions-employees-avoid-jobs-with-startups?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;Startups are an important catalyst for innovation and economic growth. Yet these important firms are also more sensitive to economic fluctuations than their more established counterparts. While the vulnerability of startups to economic downturns has been &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w21776/w21776.pdf&quot;>;well documented&lt;/a>;, the reason for this vulnerability is not entirely understood.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Conventional wisdom suggests that startups are vulnerable to recessions&amp;nbsp;because they struggle to secure financing during such times. However, the Covid-19 downturn upended this narrative. Venture capital funding &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ey.com/en_us/growth/venture-capital-continues-to-exhibit-immunity-to-the-covid-19-pandemic#:~:text=The%20numbers%20we%20are%20seeing,over%20the%20past%20four%20years.&quot;>;surged in 2020 and 2021&lt;/a>;, contrary to expectations. That raises the possibility that funding isn&#39;t the only factor that makes recessions so hard for startups.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We sought to shed new light on how employees choose between startups and established firms, which are increasingly competing for the same talent. Understanding employee preferences and how they change with economic conditions is critical to understanding incumbent-vs.-new-entrant dynamics. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=59035&quot;>;Our research&lt;/a>; offers an alternative hypothesis rooted in the labor market: Startups find it challenging to attract talent during downturns due to job seekers&#39; inclination toward larger, more established firms.&lt;strong>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Testing this hypothesis is tricky. If startups hire less during a downturn, is that because workers are reluctant to join them, or because startups are reluctant to add workers to their payrolls?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To specifically detect changes in workers&#39; interest in startups, we partnered with AngelList Talent, the leading job-recruitment platform for entrepreneurial firms. Through this partnership, we were able to look at changes in job search and application behaviors during the most recent recession: the Covid downturn. Our findings reveal a “flight to safety” among job seekers. During the downturn, they increasingly directed their searches and applications to larger, more established organizations. Notably, higher-quality candidates, measured by experience or education, were particularly inclined to shift away from startups.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This shift had a tangible impact on firms. Less-established startups received fewer job applications, particularly from high-quality candidates, leading to a decline in the talent pool available to them. This decline happened even within the same job vacancy over time. That means it&#39;s not just that startups demand less labor during recessions — even for existing job postings, hiring got harder. While startups faced challenges in filling their job vacancies, more established firms benefited from this shift in job seeker interest, experiencing greater success in attracting talent.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What drives the flight to safety by workers? There are two possible explanations. First, workers may become more risk-averse across the board during recessions, amplifying their desire for job security. Second, workers could change their view of how risky different employers are. Our findings point more toward the former, because both growing, successful startups and less-successful ones saw a decline in applicants. That&#39;s more consistent with an across-the-board decline in risk tolerance, rather than a reassessment of how risky specific employers are. (Because if that were the case, the struggling startups would presumably take a bigger hit than the more successful ones.) Thus, our results are more consistent with the idea that increased risk-aversion drives job seekers away from all startups — regardless of their quality.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One might question whether these findings are applicable beyond the unique circumstances of the Covid downturn, which may have been more extreme than other downturns. However, we show that the magnitude of the decline in economic expectations during that time period aligns closely with declines observed in past recessions. Moreover, we conducted rigorous tests to rule out Covid-specific factors that might explain our results, such as a shift in job-seeker preferences toward employers who could offer remote work or strict health protocols.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It has long been recognized that startups grapple with financial constraints during periods of economic turbulence. The Covid recession was unusual in that most recessions lead to less venture capital funding, not more. Our research adds a new dimension to this understanding by highlighting that human capital — another vital resource for startups — also comes under significant strain during downturns, leading to a “double whammy.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Historically, policy interventions have been primarily geared toward alleviating financial pressures on startups but have ignored the talent crunch they face. This talent crunch poses a considerable risk, potentially undermining a startup&#39;s ability to survive and compete against larger, established firms. As we navigate through economic uncertainties, a more nuanced understanding of these forces is essential for both policymakers and entrepreneurs.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 29 Sep 2023 22:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Creating a Cohesive Team for Corporate Transformation Projects]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/09/creating-a-cohesive-team-for-corporate-transformation-projects]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/09/Sep23_29_2509341.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;Juan Moyano/Getty Images&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;Hollywood films have long been made by teams of independent contractors and employees of different production companies brought together for short-term projects. Companies have embraced this model for transformations, with data showing that 45% of the people on these projects are not regular employees. Managing a disparate group like this can be a challenge, but team leaders can overcome that by working to create one culture, making work personal, and empowering the team leader.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/creating-a-cohesive-team-for-corporate-transformation-projects?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/creating-a-cohesive-team-for-corporate-transformation-projects?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;The screenwriters&#39; strike that began last May, and the actors&#39; strike that followed in July, highlighted an employment model that has given Hollywood a highly flexible workforce for decades: The vast majority of people on a set are not studio employees but independent contractors or employees of other firms. Take, for example, the people who worked on this year&#39;s Oscar winner for best picture, &lt;em>;Everything Everywhere All at Once.&lt;/em>; In addition to the 42 actors; the 49 artists, set dressers, and painters; and the hundreds more who provided art, music, transportation, writing and editing, costumes, casting, sound, and stunts, the rest of the crew came from six production companies, three special-effects firms, and 28 other organizations.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This model has begun to extend far beyond Hollywood. Our research shows, for example, that in early 2020, on average, employees made up only 62% of the teams responsible for transformation initiatives at 404 global technology, financial services, health care, and life sciences companies with at least $1 billion in revenue. The rest came from staffing or consulting firms or were independent contractors. By the fall of 2022, with nearly three years of the pandemic having put companies into transformation overdrive, those numbers were 55% employees and 45% non-employees.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Judging from a study of 1,005 companies we did in the spring of 2023, we predict that the average number of employees on corporate transformation teams will fall below 50% by 2030, for four reasons:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;By using outsiders, companies can acquire key skills on demand and escape hefty severance costs down the road.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;They can tap the pool of freelance talent that grows with every mass layoff and forced retirement.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Many of these hires can work from home, which creates a global talent market.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;And companies can avoid employee burnout — a big issue today.&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;The Pandemic and Project Overload&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Over the past three years, the Covid-19 pandemic has propelled mission-critical corporate transformations, such as reorienting supply chains suffering from acute component shortages, installing new financial systems to track revenue and expenses faster and more accurately, and restructuring business processes for data cleanliness. The resulting pressure on full-time employees — and sometimes the absence of key knowledge internally — forced companies to hire outsiders with valuable and hard-to-find skills. “E-commerce, digital data security, data privacy—those are all new for us,” the comptroller for the Asia-Pacific region of a US-based luxury goods company told our researchers. “Local statutory requirements are getting more complex, as well as countries&#39; political issues. No one organization will know it all.” And large global companies that are running dozens of initiatives at once may have too few internal project leaders to go around.&lt;/p>; &lt;article-promo>; &lt;hbr-component type=&quot;promo&quot; is-insight=&quot;insight-center&quot; title=&quot;The Future of Work&quot; dek=&quot;Will your company adapt or be left behind?&quot; cta-text=&quot;&quot; href=&quot;/insight-center/the-future-of-work&quot;>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/insight-center/the-future-of-work&quot; style=&quot;color:black;text-decoration:none&quot;>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; Insight Center Collection &lt;/div>; &lt;h3>;The Future of Work&lt;/h3>; &lt;div>; Will your company adapt or be left behind? &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hbr-component>; &lt;/article-promo>; &lt;p>;Successfully staffing and running transformation initiatives with the right mix of insiders and outsiders requires what we call a “dynamic workforce model.” Unlike a static model, which assigns only employees to a critical project team or outsources the work altogether, the dynamic version puts insiders and outsiders on an equal footing. Our study found that the best executors of these initiatives, which were 15% of the 404 companies surveyed, were far more likely to use a dynamic workforce model than the worst executors (24% of the survey base). The best executors&#39; companies also substantially outperformed the worst executors financially, with an 63% average increase in market capitalization between 2017 and the fall of 2022, compared with an average 24% decline for the worst companies.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But this model also presents steep challenges, including creating a cohesive team culture, building trust among people who don&#39;t know one another, and empowering leaders to keep things on track. Project sponsors and project leaders must address those challenges to succeed.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Creating a One-Culture Team&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;When a company fields its own team to run a big transformation initiative, or brings in a consulting firm to execute it, everyone on the team is well versed in the organization&#39;s values and beliefs, the behaviors that are permissible, and who are the powerful internal “players.” But if the team includes outsiders, they are like tourists in a strange land. They can&#39;t be expected to understand the full context of the initiative the way insiders do, no matter how well they&#39;ve been briefed. A thorough onboarding — one that informs team members of both the project mechanics and the company culture as well as project steps, roles, deliverables, and tools — will convey the values, beliefs, and behaviors of the company.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The gene therapy firm Asklepios BioPharmaceutical Inc. (AskBio) gets this. Acquired by Bayer in 2020, AskBio has a number of promising therapeutics in development, including for Parkinson&#39;s disease and congestive heart failure. “It&#39;s super important to create a unified team culture,” said Guru Ramamurthy, chief financial offer at the 800-employee firm based in Research Triangle Park, NC, and CFO of Bayer&#39;s US business. Tapping contractors and consultants has been an important component of rapidly scaling up its infrastructure and capabilities. “Maintaining momentum is critical to execution,” Ramamurthy says, especially since the Bayer buyout. But during a time of rapid growth and change, hiring employees to fill key team roles can be time-intensive and may prove unsuccessful. It can take about three months to discover that a new employee isn&#39;t a good fit, and retraining a replacement can take from six to nine months. Meanwhile, demands and focus may change, altering role requirements. Supplementing with outside experts offers greater operational flexibility and agility.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since the pandemic began, anywhere from 15% to 30% of AskBio&#39;s project team members have been external, depending on the initiative. “A key area of success is how well we blend our employees with the experts we get from various vendors,” Ramamurthy says. He believes that contractors and consultants, particularly those who work remotely, must be treated as equally valued team members. AskBio provides them with access to information and company tools to enable communication across blended teams.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Once an AskBio initiative has been completed, external team members often ask about company job openings. When Ramamurthy hears this, he knows they didn&#39;t feel like outsiders on their teams. “This is the kind of project experience you want to give every contributor,” he says.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Making the Work Personal, Not Transactional&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;On a team composed of employees from one company, the members have a chance to know one another personally — their lives outside the job, their passions, their families, their ups and down at work. But outsiders on a team don&#39;t have that experience. And as more people are hired from outside a company, insiders may detach emotionally from the work, especially if they are involved in several critical initiatives. “It&#39;s easy to see people just as numbers or resources,” a chemical company&#39;s chief strategy officer explained.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Remote team members have an even harder time establishing strong personal relationships. A finance executive at a multibillion-dollar medical-products manufacturer told us how difficult it was to manage remote team members — especially when they aren&#39;t employees, but even when they come from other business units. “We find trust, understanding, and engagement are sometimes missing with them,” he said.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Building trust among transformation team members is crucial to success. Consider, for example, a project manager who must promise anonymity to a team member who points out a mistake that needs correcting. “You have to empower people to speak up,” the finance executive said. And strong commitment to the well-being of a hard-to-replace team member may be necessary to pull that person through a bad patch in the life of a transformation initiative. The executive told us that his company&#39;s project leaders are encouraged to make personal visits when relationships with team members appear strained.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;An Asia-Pacific regional comptroller watched her Shanghai team members get caught in pandemic lockdowns after 2020. Several times she arranged grocery deliveries to their homes and access to mental and physical health resources. “You can&#39;t expect the usual high performance under those conditions,” she told our researchers. Project leaders must use empathy in such cases to motivate teams. The company&#39;s projects — of which she was juggling 19 — have been long, making it hard to keep team members motivated and focused. Awarding bonuses and other recognition for good work has helped, she said.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Empowering the Project Leader&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Among the companies we studied, the best at executing critical transformations had better project leaders than the worst and were more likely to give those leaders the authority to decide what skills were needed on their team and who had them. Some 85% allowed those leaders to replace team members when necessary, whether from inside or outside, whereas only 70% of the worst gave project managers the same authority.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The medical-products company executive told us that empowering project managers increases the chances that they&#39;ll stay with the organization. “Having strong project leaders gives an organization a large competitive advantage,” he said. “There are always projects to be done. If you don&#39;t have a strong project capability, you cannot keep up with your peers.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At a time when companies must move faster to stay competitive, bringing in outsiders for key roles in transformation initiatives has become a reality. But insiders and outsiders must be managed as one effective, cohesive, motivated, and collegial team. Movie producers and directors know how to do this. Companies in industries that are a long way from Hollywood must follow suit.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 29 Sep 2023 21:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Eliminating Algorithmic Bias Is Just the Beginning of Equitable AI]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/09/eliminating-algorithmic-bias-is-just-the-beginning-of-equitable-ai]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/09/Sep23_29_n4KewLKFOZw.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;HBR Staff/Imansyah Muhamad Putera/Unsplash&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;When it comes to artificial intelligence and inequality, algorithmic bias rightly receives a lot of attention. But it&amp;#8217;s just one way that AI can lead to inequitable outcomes. To truly create equitable AI, we need to consider three forces through which it might make society more or less equal: technological forces, supply-side forces, and demand-side forces. The last of these is particularly underemphasized. The use of AI in a product can change how much customers value it &amp;#8212; for example, patients who put less stock in an algorithmic diagnosis &amp;#8212; which in turn can affect how that product is used and how those working alongside it are compensated.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/eliminating-algorithmic-bias-is-just-the-beginning-of-equitable-ai?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/eliminating-algorithmic-bias-is-just-the-beginning-of-equitable-ai?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;From automating mundane tasks to pioneering breakthroughs in healthcare, artificial intelligence is revolutionizing the way we live and work, promising immense potential for productivity gains and innovation. Yet, it has become increasingly apparent that the promises of AI aren&#39;t distributed equally — it risks exacerbating social and economic disparities, particularly across demographic characteristics such as race.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Business and government leaders are being called on to ensure the benefits of AI-driven advancements are accessible to all. Yet it seems that for each passing day there is some new way in which AI creates inequality, resulting in a reactive patchwork of solutions — or often no response at all. If we want to effectively address AI-driven inequality, we will need a proactive, holistic approach.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If policymakers and business leaders hope to make AI more equitable, they should start by recognizing three forces through which AI can increase inequality. We recommend a straightforward, macro-level framework that encompasses these three forces but centers the intricate &lt;em>;social mechanisms&lt;/em>; through which AI creates and perpetuates inequality. This framework boasts dual benefits. First, its versatility ensures applicability across diverse contexts, from manufacturing to healthcare to art. Second, it illuminates the often-overlooked, interdependent ways AI alters demand for goods and services, a significant pathway by which AI propagates inequality.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Our framework consists of three interdependent forces through which AI creates inequality: technological forces, supply-side forces, and demand-side forces.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Technological forces: Algorithmic bias&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Algorithmic bias occurs when algorithms make decisions that systematically disadvantage certain groups of people. It can have disastrous consequences when applied to key areas such as healthcare, criminal justice, and credit scoring. Scientists investigating a widely used healthcare algorithm &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aax2342&quot;>;found that it severely underestimated the needs of Black patients&lt;/a>;, leading to significantly less care. This is not just unfair, but profoundly harmful. Algorithmic bias often occurs because certain populations are underrepresented in the data used to train AI algorithms or because pre-existing societal prejudices are baked into the data itself.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;While minimizing algorithmic bias is an important piece of the puzzle, unfortunately it is not sufficient for ensuring equitable outcomes. Complex social processes and market forces lurk beneath the surface, giving rise to a landscape of winners and losers that cannot be explained by algorithmic bias alone. To fully understand this uneven landscape, we need to understand how AI shapes the supply and demand for goods and services in ways that perpetuate and even create inequality.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Supply-side forces: Automation and augmentation&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;AI often lowers the costs of supplying certain goods and services by automating and augmenting human labor. As research by economists like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/pandp.20181019&quot;>;Erik Brynjolfsson&lt;/a>; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://openai.com/research/gpts-are-gpts&quot;>;Daniel Rock&lt;/a>; reveals, some jobs are more likely to be automated or augmented by AI than others. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.brookings.edu/articles/race-and-jobs-at-risk-of-being-automated-in-the-age-of-covid-19/&quot;>;telling analysis&lt;/a>; by the Brookings Institution found that “Black and Hispanic workers … are over-represented in jobs with a high risk of being eliminated or significantly changed by automation.” This isn&#39;t because the algorithms involved are biased, but because some jobs consist of tasks that are easier (or more financially lucrative) to automate such that investment in AI is a strategic advantage. But because people of color are often concentrated in those very jobs, automation and augmentation of work through AI and digital transformations more broadly has the potential to create inequality along demographic lines.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Demand-side forces: Audience (e)valuations&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;The integration of AI in professions, products, or services can affect how people value them. In short, AI alters demand-side dynamics, too.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Suppose you discover your doctor uses AI tools for diagnosis or treatment. Would that influence your decision to see them? If so, you are not alone. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2023/02/22/60-of-americans-would-be-uncomfortable-with-provider-relying-on-ai-in-their-own-health-care/&quot;>;recent poll&lt;/a>; found that 60% of US adults would be uncomfortable with their healthcare provider relying on AI to treat and diagnose diseases. In economic terms, they may have lower demand for services that incorporate AI.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Why AI-augmentation can lower demand&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Our recent research sheds light on why AI-augmentation can lower demand for a variety of goods and services. We found that people often perceive the value and expertise of professionals to be lower when they advertise AI-augmented services. This penalty for AI-augmentation occurred for services as diverse as coding, graphic design, and copyediting.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, we also found that people are divided in their perceptions of AI-augmented labor. In the survey we conducted, 41% of respondents were what we call “AI Alarmists” — people who expressed reservations and concerns about AI&#39;s role in the workplace. Meanwhile, 31% were “AI Advocates,” who wholeheartedly champion the integration of AI in the labor force. The remaining 28% were “AI Agnostics,” those who sit on the fence, recognizing both potential benefits and pitfalls. This diversity of views underlines the absence of a clear, unified mental model on the value of AI-augmented labor. While these results are based on a relatively small online survey, and do not capture how all of society views AI, they do point to distinct differences between individuals&#39; social (e)valuations of the uses &lt;em>;and&lt;/em>; users of AI. and how this informs their demand for goods and services — which is at the heart of what we plan to explore in further studies.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;How demand-side factors perpetuate inequality&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Despite its significance, this perspective — how audiences perceive and value AI-augmented labor — is often glossed over in the broader dialogue about AI and inequality. This demand-side analysis is an important part of understanding the winners and losers of AI, and how it can perpetuate inequality.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;That&#39;s especially true in cases where peoples&#39; perceived value of AI intersects with bias against marginalized groups. For example, the expertise of professionals from dominant groups is typically assumed, while equally qualified professionals from traditionally marginalized groups often face skepticism about their expertise. In the example above, people are skeptical of doctors&#39; relying on AI — but that distrust may not play out in the same ways across professionals with varying backgrounds. Doctors from marginalized backgrounds, who already face skepticism from patients, are likely to bear the brunt of this loss of confidence caused by AI.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;While efforts are already underway to address &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ajl.org/library/research&quot;>;algorithmic bias&lt;/a>; as well as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://workofthefuture.mit.edu/research-post/artificial-intelligence-and-the-future-of-work/&quot;>;effects of automation and augmentation&lt;/a>;, it is less clear how to address audience&#39;s biased valuations of historically disadvantaged groups. But there&#39;s hope.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Aligning social and market forces for an equitable AI future&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;To truly foster an equitable AI future, we must recognize, understand, and address all three forces. These forces, while distinct, are tightly intertwined, and fluctuations in one reverberate throughout the others.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To see how this plays out, consider a scenario where a doctor refrains from using AI tools to avoid alienating patients, even if the technology improves healthcare delivery. This reluctance not only affects the doctor and their practice but deprives their patients of AI&#39;s potential advantages such as early detection during cancer screenings. And if this doctor serves diverse communities this might also result in exacerbating the underrepresentation of those communities and their health factors in AI training datasets. Consequently, the AI tools become less attuned to the specific needs of these communities, perpetuating a cycle of disparity. In this way, a detrimental feedback loop can take shape.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The metaphor of a tripod is apt: a deficiency in just one leg directly impacts the stability of the entire structure, which impacts the ability to adjust angles and perspectives, and inevitably its value to its users.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To prevent the negative feedback loop described above, we would do well to look to frameworks that enable us to develop mental models of AI-augmented labor that promote equitable gains. For example, platforms that provide AI-generated products and services need to educate buyers on AI-augmentation and the unique skills required for working effectively with AI tools. One essential component is to emphasize that AI augments, rather than supplants, human expertise.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Though rectifying algorithmic biases and mitigating the effects of automation are indispensable, they are not enough. To usher in an era where the adoption of AI acts as a lifting &lt;em>;and&lt;/em>; equalizing force, collaboration between stakeholders will be key. Industries, governments, and scholars must come together through thought partnerships and leadership to forge new strategies that prioritize human-centric and equitable gains from AI. Embracing such initiatives will ensure a smoother, more inclusive, and stable transition into our AI-augmented future.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 29 Sep 2023 20:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Video Quick Take: SAP&rsquo;s David Hamilton on Disruption, Growth, and the Role of Technology in Midsize Companies - SPONSOR CONTENT FROM SAP]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/sponsored/2023/09/video-quick-take-saps-david-hamilton-on-disruption-growth-and-the-role-of-technology-in-midsize-companies]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;html>; &lt;head>;&lt;/head>; &lt;body>; &lt;p>;&lt;b>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/b>;&lt;/p>; &lt;div>; &lt;div data-props=&quot;{&amp;quot;name&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;6337163374112&amp;quot;}&quot; js-target=&quot;video-player-page&quot;>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>;&lt;/div>; &lt;div>;&lt;/div>; &lt;div>;&lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;span>;Loading... &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;script src=&quot;//players.brightcove.net/2071817190001/default_default/index.min.js&quot;>;&lt;/script>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Todd Pruzan, HBR&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Welcome to the HBR Video Quick Take. I&#39;m Todd Pruzan, senior editor for research and special projects at Harvard Business Review. Over the last few years, midsize companies have made huge leaps in adopting technology to survive, enabling their employees to work remotely, switching to online stores, improving supply chain visibility, and offering online learning.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Today, we&#39;re talking about that with David Hamilton, senior vice president and chief marketing officer at SAP Concur and chief marketing and solutions officer at SAP Midmarket. David, thanks for being with us.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;David Hamilton, SAP&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Thank you for having me.&lt;/p>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div id=&quot;DFP_IC_pos3&quot;>; &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;>;if (isAdobeSync()) googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(&quot;DFP_IC_pos3&quot;); });&lt;/script>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Todd Pruzan, HBR&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;David, how did technology play a role for companies to survive all these recent disruptions?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;David Hamilton, SAP&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It&#39;s been really tough. These have been challenging times. IDC Research, commissioned by SAP, showed midsize companies that have completed or [are] in advanced stages of digital transformation were much more successful in continuing to drive growth in revenue and market share. And they were able to positively navigate the pandemic.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These leaders have adopted technologies that may have seemed available only to large enterprises in the past. For instance, one example is, of those leading companies, 92% of them have adopted or plan to adopt an ERP system.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Todd Pruzan, HBR&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ninety-two percent—that&#39;s pretty impressive. David, as you said, many of these technologies only seemed appropriate for the big guys in the past. So what&#39;s changed?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;David Hamilton, SAP&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div id=&quot;DFP_IC_pos4&quot;>; &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;>;if (isAdobeSync()) googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(&quot;DFP_IC_pos4&quot;); });&lt;/script>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;It is really interesting. I think what we&#39;ve seen is this democratization for these midsize companies. And it&#39;s the ability to consume technology through the cloud that&#39;s at the heart of that because the cloud allows companies of all sizes to adopt advanced tech functionality without having to invest in servers or expand their IT departments.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For instance, companies can benefit from technology with embedded AI and machine learning without having to be experts. It&#39;s a real-time value-add, since software continually gets more intelligent. Also, companies that have higher adoption of cloud technology, because it&#39;s pushed directly to employees, can immediately use it.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Todd Pruzan, HBR&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Well, that makes sense. David, how does technology support growth?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;David Hamilton, SAP&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Well, technology supports growth in many different ways. It can provide connections across the business. It can help automate repetitive tasks, which helps teams to be more efficient, freeing them to focus on projects that drive business value. Technology can provide increased visibility across the business and give you scale to align with company growth. Technology could also help with flexibility and agility. You can seize opportunities in new markets without having to worry about compliance, or respond to new customer demands and innovative products, and deal with supply chain disruptions more quickly. It is at the core of growth opportunities for companies of all sizes.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Todd Pruzan, HBR&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;OK, so what do you recommend midsize companies do to take the next step to be ready for growth?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;David Hamilton, SAP&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first thing I really recommend is companies do an internal review of their biggest pain points. Perhaps it&#39;s the ability to manage employees remotely or improve supply chain diversification—it could be many different things—and based on this, make the right technology decisions to support these pain points.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For instance, one of the first things to consider is likely a core ERP solution that can serve as the foundation for growth and help address a number of pain points. An ERP solution can give visibility across the business, reducing the data needed to make decisions, automate processes, and reduce costs.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Todd Pruzan, HBR&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;OK, well, that&#39;s a great overview.

The framework, known as VUCA, has been widely discussed and adopted since, but it turns out to be better at describing &lt;em>;what&lt;/em>; successful leaders do than teaching all leaders &lt;em>;how&lt;/em>; to succeed. The authors present an updated approach that has generated positive outcomes in military, business, and sports contexts.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/how-to-be-a-better-leader-amid-volatility-uncertainty-complexity-and-ambiguity?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/how-to-be-a-better-leader-amid-volatility-uncertainty-complexity-and-ambiguity?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;Your environment is changing fast. You lack the data to make confident decisions. Your operations sprawl with processes. You&#39;re spotting trends that could be good — or not.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These are the four challenges of volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity. They&#39;re the reality of business today. But they&#39;re &lt;a href=&quot;/1992/11/is-management-still-a-science&quot;>;not new. &lt;/a>;They&#39;re intrinsic to markets, sales, manufacturing — and life in general. So why do some organizations respond better? How do they succeed when others struggle or even surrender?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the late 1980s, after the fall of the Soviet Union triggered a spike in global instability, the US Army War College set out to find answers. They developed the concept of VUCA, an acronym for volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity. And they determined that leaders who did best in VUCA had the capacity to create and communicate a story of the future, a story broad enough to adapt to changing circumstance, yet accurate enough to &lt;a href=&quot;https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/beyond-forecasting-creating-new-strategic-narratives&quot;>;yield competitive advantage&lt;/a>;. They called this skill “vision.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the wake of the 2008 global financial crisis, &lt;em>;Harvard Business Review&lt;/em>; published &lt;a href=&quot;/2010/11/leading-in-a-vuca-environment&quot;>;a four-part series&lt;/a>; on VUCA that detailed the core characteristics of visionary leadership: flexibility, collaboration, foresight, active listening, clear communication. Since then, the War College&#39;s theory has become a standard resource for modern business in times of uncertain change.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But in the 2010s Army researchers inventoried VUCA and discovered that the War College&#39;s theory was better at describing leaders than at producing them. It explained &lt;em>;what&lt;/em>; good leaders did in VUCA, but didn&#39;t explain &lt;em>;how&lt;/em>; to cultivate those behaviors in less successful leaders.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To fill that gap, we (the authors of this article) returned to VUCA. Two of us have decades of experience training military commanders and frontline leaders; the third is an expert in the brain science of creating and communicating plans and other narratives. Working with US Army Special Operations, we developed a suite of new techniques for training the brain to initiate effective plans and strategies in murky and fast-changing environments. We tested these techniques outside the Army in professional sports (such as the NFL) and in business (from Fortune 15s such as Cardinal Health to billion-dollar tech firms such as Faire). And we synthesized our findings into a method that the US Army has formally recognized with a Commendation Medal for “groundbreaking research.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Here&#39;s that method, starting with what psychologists refer to as a mindset shift.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Decision-Making Doesn&#39;t Always Improve with More Data&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;When life is stable and transparent, more data leads to better decisions. But when life turns choppy or murky, data gets fragile and elusive. More data is not an option — and to seek it produces passivity, mission creep, and hesitation.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The key to intelligent leadership in VUCA is low-data decision making. Low-data decision making is impossible for computers, which is why volatility causes AI to become brittle and prone to catastrophic error. But low-data decision making is an inherent power of the brain, which evolved to thrive in unpredictable environments.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To activate that power, target “exceptional information.” Exceptional information is an exception to an existing rule. It&#39;s the initial sign of an emergent threat or opportunity, like when the mainframe engineer Steve Wozniak saw the Altair 8800 microcomputer at the first meeting of the Homebrew Computer Club on March 5, 1975. Other mainframe engineers dismissed the Altair as too small to be useful. But in the Altair&#39;s unusual smallness, Wozniak glimpsed a new story of the future: a world where computers were used to work and play games at home. He dashed back to his own home and engineered the Apple I.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you think you can&#39;t spot exceptional information unless you&#39;re as brilliant as Wozniak, think again. You did it as a child, when unusual cracks on the sidewalk and unique clouds in the sky prompted your brain to imagine: &lt;em>;What if?&lt;/em>; To return to that earlier mindset, exit your adult brain&#39;s bias toward abstract reasoning. Focus instead on identifying what&#39;s unique about every person you meet and every place you visit — like how a company accountant spends his evenings studying Nigerian poetry, or how a local chef blends two spices like nobody else. You&#39;ll know you&#39;re picking up on the exceptional if you find yourself experiencing that childlike power to dream new tomorrows, imagining what could happen next.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;New Leadership Techniques&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Now that you have shifted your mindset, here are three techniques for training yourself to lead better in VUCA.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;&lt;strong>;Don&#39;t&amp;nbsp;Rely on Active Listening.&amp;nbsp;Do Use the New Science of Active Questioning.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Active listening is a venerable business method, defined in the 1950s by Carl Rogers and Richard Farson, that can be effective when there is low urgency and high transparency. But in VUCA, you will increase your effectiveness by employing active questioning.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Active questioning surfaces exceptional information via a simple technique: Delay asking &lt;em>;Why&lt;/em>;. When we ask &lt;em>;Why&lt;/em>;, the brain seeks answers in existing rules and prior judgments, which dismiss or explain away the new and unexpected. Instead prioritize &lt;em>;What&lt;/em>;, &lt;em>;Who&lt;/em>;, &lt;em>;When&lt;/em>;, &lt;em>;Where, How — &lt;/em>;focusing on answers that trigger surprise. That surprise is an indicator of exceptions that press the brain to develop new rules and judgments. The more of those exceptions that can be gathered and held simultaneously in view, the more effectively a leader can imagine new futures.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We recently worked with a Fortune 50 finance company that since 2019 had been losing a growing slice of its junior talent. To understand what was happening, HR asked the leavers, “Why are you going to our competitors?,” and they responded, “Money.” So the company upped its retention offers — but continued to lose talent.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To help the company respond more effectively to this emergent challenge, we trained its HR staff to delay asking &lt;em>;Why &lt;/em>;and instead engage junior talent with questions like: &lt;em>;What&lt;/em>; do you do on your weekends? &lt;em>;Who &lt;/em>;do you do it with? &lt;em>;Where &lt;/em>;do you go on vacation? From these questions, HR determined that the company&#39;s junior talent suffered from a variety of sources of low life-satisfaction. Money wasn&#39;t the deep reason for their discontent; it was just a surrogate explanation, used to communicate their sense that something was missing and to rationalize why they wanted to explore outside career options.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;By using active questioning to identify what was actually missing from its younger employees&#39; lives, the company became substantially more effective at retaining talent. One junior exec was unhappy because they and their partner were struggling to conceive a child. The company paid for fertility treatments — then hosted a baby shower.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;&lt;strong>;Don&#39;t Optimize the Plan. Do Optimize the Planner. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;In 1957, US President Dwight Eisenhower gave a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-national-defense-executive-reserve-conference&quot;>;speech&lt;/a>; in which he recalled spending his early days at the Army Staff College planning for wars that never happened. It was a waste of time, he said — except that it wasn&#39;t, because the process trained him and his colleagues to be ready for anything. “The reason it is so important to plan,” he told his audience, is “to keep yourselves steeped in the character of the problem that you may one day be called upon to solve.” In other words, as he put it famously in that speech, “Plans are worthless, but planning is everything.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Not long ago, we worked with a $100m sales company that had an unusually high percentage of senior managers who did not successfully transition to leadership. We embedded with them and discovered that they believed a key to leadership was developing the optimum plan. Their senior managers brainstormed every likely challenge or opportunity, crunched the probabilities, and developed a grand strategy. Just in case something unexpected occurred, they also made a Plan B. Yet despite having plans for every probable contingency, they were continually caught flat-footed. Their optimum plans broke again and again, as did their Plan Bs — at which point they lost confidence in their leadership, prompting their teams to lose confidence too.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These managers set themselves up for failure by trusting in Plan B. In VUCA, Plan B isn&#39;t anything other than a variation on Plan A. Both are based upon the same underlying methods and assumptions, so if one fails, the other often follows.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To help the senior managers transition into leadership, we trained them to push beyond Plan B and generate a whole set of plans that encompassed not just the most probable contingencies but all possible contingencies, with a particular emphasis on the extreme and unprecedented. The goal of this process was not to make better plans. It was to make better planners, who reacted dynamically when their plans failed by planning again. As assessed by the company&#39;s internal metrics, this approach more than doubled the rate at which senior managers transitioned into leaders.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Don&#39;t Dissociate from Fear and Anger. Do Use Emotion Reset. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Fear and anger are popularly characterized as negative emotions. Leaders are taught to suppress or bypass them via mindfulness, meditation, pop-Stoicism, and other dissociative techniques. But although fear and anger may lead to negative behaviors, they arise, like all emotions, for positive reasons — notably, to signal the onset of a flight-or-fight response. That response is triggered when your nervous system detects environmental volatility and other indicators of VUCA.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you ignore or suppress fear and anger, you deprive yourself of a warning system, tuned through millions of years of biological evolution, for alerting you when you&#39;re under threat and need to switch on your leadership vision.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;That warning system isn&#39;t perfect. But you can improve it. The next time you feel fear or anger, recall in detail a time when you dealt successfully with a similar situation, reminding your brain, &lt;em>;You&#39;ve done this before&lt;/em>;. We call this technique “emotion reset.” It allows you to quickly evaluate whether your flight-and-fight is tuned to your environment. If your fear and anger calm when you perform emotion reset, then your flight-or-flight response is an overreaction. You&#39;re imagining more VUCA than is actually present, so the best course of action is to stick with your existing plans and keep gathering data. But if your fear and anger remain constant when you perform emotion reset, then the VUCA is real, and your circumstances are urgent. Respond energetically to match that urgency by re-planning fast and acting decisively.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We worked on this with an NFL quarterback prospect who improvised too much during games. To rein in his behavior, his coaches drilled him on sticking to the gameplan. This stopped him from improvising but negatively affected his performance, turning him into a robot who lost his feel for the game.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To help him keep improvising without overdoing it, we studied his game tape. We noticed that his improvisation rate increased after failed plays, suggesting it was often driven by overactive fight-or-flight. To allow him to better assess the reliability of his fight-or-flight response, we worked with him on emotion reset. From game tape, we highlighted examples of when he had successfully executed planned plays and we had him mentally review these occasions, over and over, seeing them in detail. This primed the memories in his brain for fast recall. Then we had him create a “trigger,” a memento he associated with those memories. He took the trigger into his next game and looked at it after every bad play, remembering &lt;em>;I&#39;ve done this before&lt;/em>;. By resetting his emotions, he kept himself from getting unnecessarily anxious or aggressive, sticking more consistently to the coaches&#39; game plan. And by not forcing himself to stick robotically to that plan, he retained his ability to improvise in VUCA, leading his team by inventing fresh plans when needed.&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;* * *&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tomorrow is full of fog and volatility. Markets, supply chains, technology, and consumer trends are hazy and transforming. But you can lead your organization to succeed. The Army&#39;s original theory of VUCA defined visionary leadership. And now, using what we&#39;ve laid out in this article, you have a Special Operations method for cultivating it in yourself — and your future teams.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 28 Sep 2023 23:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[How Deep Tech Can Drive Sustainability and Profitability in Manufacturing]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/09/how-deep-tech-can-drive-sustainability-and-profitability-in-manufacturing]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/09/Sep23_28_97971080.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;Adam Gault/Getty Images&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;Companies are facing more pressure to become more sustainable while remaining profitable &amp;#8212; and deep tech can help. Deep tech, which combines physical technologies and digital technologies, is moving out of the lab and into real-world supply chains. Younger firms, working alone or in collaboration with large companies, are doing much of the work to commercialize it.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/how-deep-tech-can-drive-sustainability-and-profitability-in-manufacturing?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/how-deep-tech-can-drive-sustainability-and-profitability-in-manufacturing?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;The days of operations that pursue speed, quality, and cost efficiency above all else have come to an end. Today, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bcg.com/publications/2022/production-as-a-service-benefits-opportunities&quot;>;objectives that manufacturers must pursue&lt;/a>; to ensure competitiveness have evolved. Sustainability, long seen as incompatible with these traditional goals, is now a strategic imperative.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This raises a question for manufacturers: How can they make products and production processes more sustainable while remaining profitable?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is a vibrant ecosystem of companies that have started to break this trade-off with deep tech: the innovative use of emerging physical technologies enabled by digital technologies to solve large-scale problems. As they try to increase profitability and sustainability, it&#39;s time for manufacturers to use deep tech more widely and at scale.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A confluence of factors is converging to make this possible. First, the urgency to deliver sustainability is on the rise, driven by net-zero commitments and stakeholder demands. Second, financial and regulatory support for developing green technologies has never been greater. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.whitehouse.gov/cleanenergy/inflation-reduction-act-guidebook/&quot;>;Inflation Reduction Act&lt;/a>; in the United States and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/priorities-2019-2024/european-green-deal_en&quot;>;European Green Deal&lt;/a>; in the EU are prime examples of this. And third, potentially transforming technologies are moving out of the lab and into the real world, with many demonstrating success at scale. These shifting dynamics present opportunities for manufacturers such as creating or moving to new markets or securing a head start in addressing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bcg.com/publications/2023/how-scarcity-will-reshape-sustainability-strategy&quot;>;supply scarcities&lt;/a>;, especially for green materials.&lt;/p>; &lt;article-promo>; &lt;hbr-component type=&quot;promo&quot; is-insight=&quot;insight-center&quot; title=&quot;The New Age of Operations&quot; dek=&quot;Improving efficiency and increasing resilience.&quot; cta-text=&quot;&quot; href=&quot;/insight-center/the-new-age-of-operations&quot;>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/insight-center/the-new-age-of-operations&quot; style=&quot;color:black;text-decoration:none&quot;>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; Insight Center Collection &lt;/div>; &lt;h3>;The New Age of Operations&lt;/h3>; &lt;div>; Improving efficiency and increasing resilience. &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hbr-component>; &lt;/article-promo>; &lt;p>;To capture these opportunities, break their trade-offs, and deliver sustainability, leaders should apply deep tech across their products as well as their processes. They will also need to consider how to collaborate with the innovation ecosystem, especially with younger deep tech firms.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Deep Tech Can Enhance the Profitability-Sustainability Profile of Products&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;With deep tech, manufacturing companies can reimagine the very essence of their products. Instead of offering incremental enhancements or partial substitutions — which often don&#39;t yield significant benefits and may even be counterproductive — it&#39;s essential for businesses to consider more fundamental product updates.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Manufacturers can develop and use new materials that are delinked from legacy materials&#39; supply chains or environmental footprints. Synthetically produced biological materials can act as sustainable building blocks or as drop-in substitutes. Market segments in which a sustainable manufactured product translates into a new relevant product claim are more likely to command a green premium, for example in the personal beauty space.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Consider &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.genomatica.com/&quot;>;Geno&lt;/a>;, a San Diego-based company that has developed plant-based alternatives for palm oil and fossil-based beauty, cleaning, and apparel ingredients based on its synthetic biology platform. The carbon footprint of Geno&#39;s synthetic biology–based palm oil is up to 50% lower than conventional palm-derived ingredients. By offering traceability and lowering the reliance on traditional palm-oil supply chains, its use also drives supply chain transparency and resiliency. Similarly, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.modernmeadow.com/&quot;>;Modern Meadow&lt;/a>; has developed a synthetic biology–derived collagen with unique bioactive effects. Specialty ingredients supplier &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.modernmeadow.com/news/evonikpartnership&quot;>;Evonik has partnered with Modern Meadow&lt;/a>; to bring this to scale across the personal care and cosmetics sector.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Deep tech can contribute to both supply and price stability of raw materials, which are key for a manufacturer. Switching to renewable or more abundant materials answers both of those needs and can even shorten supply chains, reducing the complexity and carbon footprint of their logistics network. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nironmagnetics.com/&quot;>;Niron Magnetics&lt;/a>;, for instance, has developed and is scaling up production of high-performance magnets. Their magnets are made from widely abundant nitrogen and iron, a viable alternative to alleviate the rare earth metals supply chain, which is concentrated in a few sources and processed in only a few plants worldwide. While initially targeting applications such as sensors or loudspeakers, these magnets could soon &lt;a href=&quot;https://spectrum.ieee.org/permanent-magnet-tesla&quot;>;contribute to making EV motors&lt;/a>;, such as those from Tesla, rare earth-free.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another way to enhance the profitability-sustainability profile is to change the performance profile of a product, for example by extending its life or endowing sustainable product properties that aren&#39;t possible with conventional materials.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Basilisk, for instance, has developed a bio-based drop-in treatment, made of engineered microorganisms using syn-bio techniques, that can be mixed in with mortar or applied to existing concrete structures. This repair system uses limestone-producing microorganisms to eliminate the need for crack repair and maintenance. Depending on the product, this can lower CO&lt;sub>;2&lt;/sub>; emissions by &lt;a href=&quot;https://basiliskconcrete.com/en/products/product-healing-agent/&quot;>;30–50%&lt;/a>; versus conventional concrete by extending the lifetime of the concrete and reducing the amount of steel needed for reinforcement. If applied at scale, this could mean a reduction of global CO&lt;sub>;2&lt;/sub>; emissions by more than 1.5%, since currently more than 6% of global CO&lt;sub>;2&lt;/sub>; emissions come from concrete.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Deep Tech Can Make Sustainable Process Economics More Compelling&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;It&#39;s not just the products themselves that create constraints, but also the processes used to make them.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2023/05/31/there-is-more-than-one-way-to-make-green-steel&quot;>;Boston Metal&lt;/a>; reimagined the conventional carbon-intensive steelmaking process by inventing a new electrolytic process and associated apparatus able to run on 100% renewable electricity and emitting no CO&lt;sub>;2&lt;/sub>;. The molten-oxide electrolysis technique, made possible by new electrode materials that can withstand high temperatures and are stable in the presence of oxygen, has the potential to reduce the carbon footprint of the steel industry, currently responsible for as much as 8% of global GHG emissions.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Deep tech can enable innovation on processes to deliver step-changes in energy efficiency. Combined with new production enablers — like a shift from linear assembly lines to small, cellular factories — manufacturers can increase flexibility, introduce optionality for local manufacturing, and transition to a lower carbon footprint production network.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For instance, &lt;a href=&quot;https://plasmonics.tech/&quot;>;Syzygy Plasmonics&lt;/a>;&#39; scalable photoreactor combines LED light and photocatalytic nanoparticles to conduct chemical reactions, made possible by combining advancements in architected materials and innovation in photonics. Because the reactor focuses the energy from light exactly where it is needed, conversions become much more efficient and sustainable than a conventional reaction.

With deep tech, manufacturers can engineer processes that reduce the number of energy-requiring transformations by building from the atom up.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Geno has successfully scaled their synthetic biology technology and farm-based supply chain to tackle large ingredients markets like butanediol (BDO), an industrial chemical, and nylon critical to the sustainability goals of its brand partners like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.unilever.com/news/press-and-media/press-releases/2022/unilever-and-geno-launch-120m-venture-to-scale-alternative-ingredients/&quot;>;Unilever&lt;/a>;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.loreal-finance.com/eng/news-event/loreal-invests-biotechnology-venture-scale-development-plant-based-ingredients&quot;>;L&#39;Oréal&lt;/a>;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.genomatica.com/news-content/lululemon-partners-with-genomatica-on-plant-based-nylon/&quot;>;Lululemon&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Operations executives should look for incentives, subsidies, and other opportunities created by recent &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/the-new-era-of-industrial-policy-is-here&quot;>;government policies&lt;/a>;. In the United States, the IRA alone covers &lt;a href=&quot;https://media-publications.bcg.com/BCG-Executive-Perspectives-US-IRA-Clean-Tech.pdf&quot;>;$71 billion&lt;/a>; in stimulus for advanced manufacturing, industrial facilities, and energy efficiency.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Build an Innovation Ecosystem&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Deep tech operates at the intersection of several emerging technologies, such as synthetic biology and 3D printing. It addresses complex issues that cross different scientific fields. It needs to serve real market needs, while often demanding significant funding and extended development periods.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Traditional companies may find it difficult to navigate this swiftly changing landscape. And few, if any, will have the tools and capabilities to do it alone.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To start making progress, manufacturers should seek to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bcg.com/publications/2023/fast-tracking-new-green-technologies&quot;>;collaborate with partners &lt;/a>;— through commercial alliances, incubators, or ecosystems that can even include governments and academia, for example. Counterintuitive as it might seem, younger deep tech firms and incumbent manufacturers should not compete but rather collaborate. Established manufacturers can expect to get access to novel technologies and specific know-how that enables them to apply deep tech in their products and processes. When partnering with deep tech startups, manufacturers should look for solutions that are most compatible with their domain and build on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://fortune.com/2023/02/03/synthetic-biology-startups-incumbents-cooperation/&quot;>;unique assets and capabilities&lt;/a>; they can leverage to create value for their joint efforts.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chicago-based biotech company LanzaTech, for instance, has developed a microbe-based technology that uses residual gases containing carbon monoxide and hydrogen as feedstock to produce bioethanol. In partnerships such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.basf.com/global/en/media/news-releases/2021/05/p-21-206.html&quot;>;with BASF&lt;/a>;, the world&#39;s largest chemicals manufacturer, LanzaTech is working to convert the carbon in the exhaust gases from industrial processes, such as steel making, into sustainable raw materials for various industries. By capturing and utilizing carbon in this way, the technology can help reduce the carbon emissions of many manufacturers and associated supply chains. BASF thus improves the sustainability of their customer&#39;s resource use and helps create demand for LanzaTech&#39;s technology.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This example is just one of many. When looking to collaborate with deep tech startups, manufacturers can consider &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bcg.com/publications/2023/what-is-your-synthetic-bio-strategy&quot;>;partnerships, joint ventures, or M&amp;amp;A approaches&lt;/a>;. The optimal engagement strategy and suitable partner will depend on the specific constraints a manufacturer faces in their domain, the need to complement missing in-house capabilities, and desired ambition level or scale.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To achieve commercial success activated by deep tech at scale, manufacturers should combine their product or process innovation with foundationally different value chains. Our extensive &lt;a href=&quot;https://bcghendersoninstitute.com/themes/business-ecosystems/&quot;>;research on business ecosystems&lt;/a>; shows that value chain transformations, while challenging and often requiring extensive collaboration, will unlock enormous value. Manufacturers can leverage their unique capabilities and existing relationships to influence suppliers and distributors to transition to solutions or infrastructure that will support the new processes and products or help navigate the regulatory environment.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Consider the fashion industry, which accounts for around &lt;a href=&quot;https://fashionforgood.com/our_news/fashion-for-good-launches-the-renewable-carbon-textiles-project/&quot;>;4%&lt;/a>; of greenhouse gas emissions globally. Sustainability innovation efforts, which need to be effective throughout complex global fashion value chains, are particularly &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.glossy.co/fashion/a-tough-sell-to-ceos-fashion-sustainability-is-taking-a-hit-in-the-current-economy/&quot;>;challenged in the current economic environment&lt;/a>;. Companies are pooling risk by collaborating cross-industry through a consortium like Fashion for Good. Fashion for Good has established an &lt;a href=&quot;https://fashionforgood.com/innovation-platform/&quot;>;innovation program&lt;/a>; that connects brands, retailers, manufacturers, and investors to develop and scale disruptive solutions within the textile industry.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The members of this industry-wide initiative are looking to realize collective goals of making sustainable change happen in &lt;a href=&quot;https://fashionforgood.com/innovation-platform/focus-areas/&quot;>;areas&lt;/a>; such as materials, processing, or end of use — but are unable to do it individually. The group has, for example, launched the &lt;a href=&quot;https://fashionforgood.com/our_news/fashion-for-good-launches-the-renewable-carbon-textiles-project/&quot;>;Renewable Carbon Textiles Project&lt;/a>;, focusing on producing fibers from polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) polymer fibers, which could offer a sustainable, biodegradable alternative to traditional, fossil-based fibers, with the potential to significantly cut emissions in fashion&#39;s value chain while simultaneously allowing manufacturers to fine-tune fabric properties. The project combines expertise of innovators like Danimer Scientific, Bio Craft Innovation, Paques Biomaterials, Helian Polymers, and Newlight Technologies with other players in the industry who will test the solutions, provide funding, and help scale the solution.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Conclusion&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;The examples of deep tech ventures and collaborations with manufacturing incumbents show that deep tech can already help companies deliver on the operations paradigm, advancing a common sustainability agenda without sacrificing long-term profitability. The real challenge is not the technology itself, but the inertia of long-established capital investments and time-tested manufacturing approaches — overcoming this is no small feat.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Given the pressing urgency for sustainability, manufacturers need to act swiftly and decisively. Manufacturers that leverage their unique capabilities and succeed in identifying the right engagement models can use deep tech as their critical driver of competitive advantage — and now is the time to get started.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 28 Sep 2023 21:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[3 Ways to Prepare for the Future of Work]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/09/3-ways-to-prepare-for-the-future-of-work]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/07/Jul23_20_alanahsarginson.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;Illustration by Alanah Sarginson&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;Many forces are converging today in unprecedented ways to reshape the nature of work. To understand and adapt to these forces, leaders need to start thinking seriously about three important areas of concern: the future of &lt;em>;workers&lt;/em>; (who are questioning the role that work plays in their lives and demanding more from the organizations they work for); the future of &lt;em>;working&lt;/em>; (which is evolving rapidly thanks to hybrid and flexible work arrangements, digitalization, and automation); and the future of &lt;em>;work &lt;/em>;itself (which always involves in response to macro forces and societal shifts). The authors refer to these three areas as the &lt;em>;who&lt;/em>;, the &lt;em>;what&lt;/em>;, and the &lt;em>;why &lt;/em>;of work. Each has its own particular set of challenges. Leaders need to confront and address these challenges, and the authors of this article provide suggestions for how they can best do that.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/3-ways-to-prepare-for-the-future-of-work?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/3-ways-to-prepare-for-the-future-of-work?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;The last few years have been marked by generation-defining crises — political, economic, societal, and environmental. Much that we once took for granted about the world of work has been called into question, and much that was previously unimaginable is now an everyday fact of life. But the churn is far from over. As a recent recruit at a global consulting firm told us, “We are at the beginning, not the end, of massive upheavals in our work lives.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These upheavals have prompted all sorts of questions about the future of work. Where are we headed? What does the future hold, and how can leaders prepare? What should they focus on as they move their organizations forward? Digitalization and the rapidly growing capabilities of AI? The many repercussions of the shift to hybrid work? Employee wellbeing? The changing priorities of millennials and boomers? Questions of social and environmental responsibility? The unstable geopolitical context and our unclear economic future?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Faced with these multiple competing — yet interdependent — issues, leaders are feeling understandably overwhelmed. “I have done all I can to hold this firm together through the pandemic,” the CEO of the above-mentioned consulting firm told us. “When I contemplate the scale of the challenges that lie ahead, I feel I have nothing left to give.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We&#39;re scholars of leadership, sustainability, and organizational change. In recent years we have focused our attention on how leaders and organizations can best rise to meet these challenges. And what we&#39;ve learned, in both our academic research and our professional consulting, is that if leaders hope to understand and adapt to the forces that are reshaping work, they&#39;re going to need to start thinking more specifically about three important areas of concern: 1) the future of &lt;em>;workers&lt;/em>;, 2) the future of &lt;em>;working&lt;/em>;, and 3) the future of &lt;em>;work &lt;/em>;itself.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In other words, the &lt;em>;who&lt;/em>;, the &lt;em>;what&lt;/em>;, and the &lt;em>;why &lt;/em>;of work.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Three Areas of Concern&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;The &lt;em>;who&lt;/em>;, &lt;em>;what&lt;/em>; and &lt;em>;why&lt;/em>; of work are deeply connected. Thinking about how they are related won&#39;t help us accurately predict the future, but it will help us prepare for it. So let&#39;s consider each in turn.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;The future of workers (the &lt;em>;who&lt;/em>;).&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Pandemic-induced introspection and the frame-breaking experience of lockdown have caused a lot of people to question the role of work in their lives. They&#39;re asking profound questions about what their organizations are demanding of them and questioning whether their organizations are worthy of their commitment. At the same time, they&#39;re often demanding the right to bring more of their “whole selves” to work, which has forced leaders to pay much more attention than in the past to questions concerning, among other topics, employees&#39; gender, race, religion, and sexuality.&lt;/p>; &lt;article-promo>; &lt;hbr-component type=&quot;promo&quot; is-insight=&quot;insight-center&quot; title=&quot;The Future of Work&quot; dek=&quot;Will your company adapt or be left behind?&quot; cta-text=&quot;&quot; href=&quot;/insight-center/the-future-of-work&quot;>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/insight-center/the-future-of-work&quot; style=&quot;color:black;text-decoration:none&quot;>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; Insight Center Collection &lt;/div>; &lt;h3>;The Future of Work&lt;/h3>; &lt;div>; Will your company adapt or be left behind? &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hbr-component>; &lt;/article-promo>; &lt;p>;But leaders who become too focused on addressing diverse individual needs can lose sight of the bigger picture. Employees&#39; questions and concerns about work arise from a collision between two powerful forces: today&#39;s macro socio-economic realities, on the one hand, and long-accepted understandings of what belonging to an organization and doing “good” work look like, on the other. Any reflections on the future of work must take stock of this evolving status of the &lt;em>;who&lt;/em>; and how it relates to the &lt;em>;what &lt;/em>;and &lt;em>;why&lt;/em>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;The future of working (the &lt;em>;what&lt;/em>;).&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Hybrid, remote, and flexible working are here to stay. In spite of attempts to compel staff to return to the office, levels of remote working remain four to five times higher than before the pandemic. These new practices fundamentally alter how people work, where they work, and when they work, but their consequences are not yet fully understood.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Leaders feel themselves under pressure to announce “standardized” policies, as a way of providing some reassuring certainty in the midst of uncomfortable ambiguity. But in the current unsettled macro context, a sense of certainty about how we should work can only be illusory and transient.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Meanwhile digitalization is rapidly reshaping the ways people and machines interact, affecting the tasks we do, the roles we fulfill, and the organizational arrangements that guide and support us. By the mid 2030s, up to 30% of jobs may be at risk of automation, and today&#39;s rapid developments in AI have brought the future into the present much faster than most predicted. How can leaders shape work environments and employee tasks that are in constant flux as a result of rapidly evolving technological systems?&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;The future of work (the &lt;em>;why&lt;/em>;).&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Long-term macro forces and short-term shocks are creating a host of new demands on business as we adapt to new energy infrastructures, aging populations, and a hotter, more turbulent planet. Supply-chain disruptions are becoming increasingly frequent. Political events are also galvanizing rapid shifts in public sentiment — about racial inequality, for example, or business relations with Russia and China. Alongside these macro shifts, people&#39;s desires and actions are evolving, reflecting deepening differences in values, aspirations, and life choices.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some leaders are responding with renewed statements of purpose, defining how they will serve societal needs alongside shareholders&#39; increasingly diverse expectations. But these attempts to take the long view are fraught with short-term ambiguities, as moves toward redefining the role of business in society trigger backlash. This is to be expected as we work through cultural shifts and start to develop a new understanding of “what good business looks like,” and hence what good work comprises.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;We Have More Agency Than We Realize&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;The upheavals that are reshaping the who, what and why of work feel beyond our control, and to some extent that will continue. Even if the direction of travel is clear, no one can predict with certainty when and where the next operational or human crisis will arise, nor whether it will be triggered by technology, war, climate, or social unrest. Regaining agency starts with recognizing our role in this complex system, and noting how workers, working, and work itself are intertwined. Ultimately, the future of work is not “out there.” It&#39;s within us and our organizations, and we can help shape it with our colleagues through the steps outlined below.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Lead collectively through uncertainty.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;For complex environmental and geopolitical challenges, it&#39;s generally accepted that localized action can only have a limited effect, and that the solutions lie in collective action. Just as nations acting alone are weak and ineffective at dealing with complex system-level challenges, so too are leaders in organizations. To address the challenges of the future of work, leaders need to understand that theirs is not an individual responsibility but rather a collective one that brings together a complex coalition of colleagues across the organization. &lt;a href=&quot;/2019/03/how-to-lead-your-fellow-rainmakers&quot;>;Collective leadership&lt;/a>; is a core component of the future of work.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Remember the exhausted consulting-firm CEO we mentioned at the start of this article, who feels he has “nothing left to give”? He is overburdened by his sense of responsibility for shaping the future of work in his organization. But he shouldn&#39;t have to bear that responsibility alone. The burden is collective. His job is to bring together potential leaders at all levels across the organization to work on this issue, to expand collective insight, and contain emotional uncertainty.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Expand collective insight.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;The current complexity of challenges in the world of work cut across hierarchies, generations, functions, and geographies. They can only be addressed by bringing together multiple sets of stakeholders with competing interests who collectively can generate a broad set of insights and help the organization and its leaders successfully navigate uncertainty. By definition those at the top of an organization have the most to lose in the short term and so may be resistant to asking the most challenging questions about the future. Meanwhile, the youngest employees have the most to gain in the long term, because the status quo is of little value to them. For this reason, many of the organizations we work with are exploring ways of integrating new and unfamiliar voices into their leadership discussions.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Contain emotional uncertainty.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;While leaders need to reach out across their organization to instigate and sustain leadership initiatives, they also need to create some emotional guard rails. A key role for leaders at any time is to work out how best to balance individuals&#39; need for autonomy with their organization&#39;s need for control. While younger colleagues in particular may crave autonomy and opportunities to pursue their passions at work, they still need the reassurance of believing in the collective identity of their organization and their position within it. Leaders should remind employees of the best aspects of their organization&#39;s past, to reaffirm their cultural identity and to provide a firm base from which to build a collective future.&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;* * *&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ultimately, we all want to belong to something greater than ourselves that is worth committing to. But the organizations we belong to have changed, and &lt;a href=&quot;/2021/03/how-has-the-past-year-changed-you-and-your-organization&quot;>;so have we&lt;/a>;. Faced with cumulatively overwhelming challenges, it is tempting to turn away from them and try just to carry on as “normal.” But when the old sense of normal is no longer relevant, as is the case today in the world of work, we have to learn how to think clearly about what&#39;s happening.&amp;nbsp; We have to recognize that we will ultimately make sense of this difficult and exciting transformative period only by creating a new sense of normal for ourselves, one that accommodates rather than resists ambiguity and ongoing uncertainty. That&#39;s simply not something we can do in isolation. But within our organizations, focusing on collective leadership, we can begin to do it together.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 28 Sep 2023 20:25:01 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
