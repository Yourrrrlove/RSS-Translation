&lt;span>;&lt;p>;我们可能不知道明天的工作会是什么样子，但我们可以有把握地假设，当人们更加好奇、情商更高、适应力更强时， 、有动力、聪明，他们通常会更好地了解完成这些工作所需的知识，并提供技术无法替代的任何人类价值。组织需要专注于扩展人们的才能，而不是押注于专家或强迫人们进入特定的领域。我们需要的不仅仅是重新技能或提升技能，而是预技能：也就是说，能够培养面向未来的人才并重塑人们的能力。在我们知道明天的工作和需求技能是什么之前，我们就已经开始了职业生涯。本文提出了五项广泛的建议，帮助您的员工为不确定的未来做好准备。&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/10/为不可预测的未来开发人才的 5 种方法？ language=es&quot;>;阅读西班牙语&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/10/5-ways-to-develop -talent-for-an-unpredictable-future?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;尽管围绕人工智能和工作自动化有许多标题党的标题和末日般的恐慌，但数据相当清晰：正如我在我的最新书中强调的那样，&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Human-Automation-Quest-Reclaim-Unique-ebook/dp/B099KQV3ZJ&quot;>;&lt;em>;我，人类：人工智能，自动化，以及重新找回使我们与众不同的追求&lt;/em>;&lt;/a>;&lt;em>;，&lt;/em>;您因人工智能而失业的可能性比&lt;a href=&quot;/2023/05/3- human-super-talents-ai-will-not-replace&quot;>;另一个人&lt;/a>;使用人工智能，特别是如果你自己不使用人工智能的话。从这个意义上说，人工智能时代并不是什么新鲜事。就像以前的颠覆性技术一样，人工智能正在消除一些工作岗位，但反过来又创造了更多新的工作岗位，这迫切需要人类。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;正如我们最近的万宝盛华报告所述，&lt;a href=&quot;https://www .manpowergroup.com/en/news-releases/news/58-of-employers- believe-artificial-intelligence-and-virtual-reality-will-be-job-creators&quot;>;58％的雇主&lt;/a>;看到人工智能作为新就业岗位的净创造者。问题在于，因工作自动化而失业的人（例如，实体店经理）不会自动获得由技术创造的所有新工作（例如，网络安全分析师、数字营销人员或人工智能伦理学家）。据&lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10796-022-10308-y&quot;>;世界经济论坛&lt;/a>;称，到 2025 年，一半员工将需要重新培训才能跟上随着新技术的发展，这个数字早于当前的生成式人工智能热潮。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;正如斯坦福大学的 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNX_6gzLIvI&quot;>;Erik Brynjolfsson&lt;/a >; 据估计，组织在技术上每花费一美元，就需要在人才和相关流程上额外投资九美元，例如识别具有合适技能和潜力的人员；培养正确的技能；启用适当的变更管理流程；并为人们&lt;a href=&quot;/2023/07/when-your-employee-isnt-reaching-their-full-potial&quot;>;发挥潜力&lt;/a>;创造条件。事实上，正如我和我的同事 Becky Frankiewicz 和我&lt;a href=&quot;/2020/05/digital-transformation-is-about-talent-not-technology&quot;>;指出的&lt;/a>;，数字化转型的成败并不是真正的数字化转型。技术，但人的因素：人才。&lt;/p>; &lt;article-promo>; &lt;hbr-component type=&quot;promo&quot; is-insight=&quot;insight-center&quot; title=&quot;工作的未来&quot; dek=&quot;您的公司会吗适应还是被抛在后面？” cta-text=&quot;&quot; href=&quot;/insight-center/the-future-of-work&quot;>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/insight-center/the-future-of-work&quot; style=&quot;color:black ;text-decoration:none&quot;>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; 洞察中心集合 &lt;/div>; &lt;h3>;工作的未来&lt;/h3>; &lt;div>; 您的公司会适应还是被抛在后面？ &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hbr-component>; &lt;/article-promo>; &lt;p>;所以，我们需要的不仅仅是重新技能或提升技能，而是&lt;em >;预技能——也就是说，在我们知道明天的工作和需求技能是什么之前，能够培养面向未来的人才并重塑人们的职业生涯。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;预技能-为未知的未来培养员工技能&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;如何做到这一点？尽管没有人知道确切的秘诀，尤其是因为没有关于未来的数据，但我们可以从宏观历史趋势进行推断，并从最近的经济和人力资本模式中吸取教训，提出五项广泛的建议：&lt;/p>; &lt;h3 >;1) 关注潜力&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;随着当前技能、专业知识和绩效的生命周期缩短，建议聘用和提拔人员以实现&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.myhrfuture.com /digital-hr-leaders-podcast/how-ai-can-unlock- human-pottial-and-make-work-more-meaningful&quot;>;他们&lt;em>;可以&lt;/em>;做什么&lt;/a>;，而不是做什么他们过去做过。&lt;/em>;。这意味着优先考虑软技能 - 例如&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.learnabilityquotient.com/&quot;>;学习能力&lt;/a>;、&lt;a href=&quot;/2015/12/assessment-whats-your-curiosity- profile&quot;>;好奇心&lt;/a>;、复原力和适应能力 - 高于硬技能 - 例如编程或数据挖掘 - 专注于基础&lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ iops.12001&quot;>;就业能力的要素&lt;/a>;，而不是当前的技术专长或过去的就业经历，这两者仍然主导着现代招聘方法。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;简单地说，我们可能不知道明天的工作会是什么样子但我们可以有把握地假设，当人们更具好奇心、情商更高、适应力更强、更有动力、更聪明时，他们通常会更有能力学习完成这些工作所需的知识，并提供技术无法替代的任何人类价值。潜力的一个优势是我们拥有可靠且经过验证的方法来衡量它，特别是&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Talent-Delusion-Intuition-Unlocking-Potential/dp/0349412480&quot;>;心理评估工具&lt;/a>;，它也可以用来&lt;em>;开发&lt;/em>;人们的潜力，特别是通过规范和&lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2019-21619-003&quot;>;数据驱动的反馈&lt;/a>;，帮助他们识别他们现在的位置和他们需要的位置之间的差距（见下一点）。&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;2）提供关键反馈&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;甚至在之前人工智能到来后，人们对于将人们的才能和潜力与最佳职业选择结合起来已经存在很多困惑和误解。现在事情变得更加复杂，大多数员工（和经理）都想知道他们将来会做什么，他们的经验和专业知识 - 以及他们在职业生涯中投入的所有时间和金钱 - 是否仍然相关，如果所以，在哪里。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;共享数据驱动的反馈（来自评估、内部数据和同行评级）并帮助人们了解他们的兴趣和技能如何成为组织的未来资产是关键。这意味着将&lt;a href=&quot;/2019/11/the-leader-as-coach&quot;>;领导者视为教练或人才经纪人&lt;/a>;，他们的主要工作是主动培养人们的才能，并利用他们的才能充分的潜力。请记住：大多数人&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Fair-Talk-Three-Powerful-Feedback/dp/1912555093&quot;>;反馈被剥夺&lt;/a>;，并且令人震惊的&lt;a href= “https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1996-02773-003&quot;>;三分之二的反馈干预措施&lt;/a>;未能产生理想的结果。关键是告诉人们他们&lt;em>;需要&lt;/em>;听什么，即使他们&lt;em>;不想&lt;/em>;听，最重要的是，你告诉他们一些他们不知道的事情这可以激励他们变得更好。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;至关重要的是，仅仅向人们提供有关他们技能差距的反馈是不够的；还需要更多的反馈。组织还需要激励他们发展相关技能，同时提供最高效、最具吸引力和影响力的计划来发展这些技能。&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;3) 关注人才扩展&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;而不是押注于人才扩张专家或强迫人们进入特定的领域，专注于拓宽或扩展人们的才能。这意味着&lt;em>;不&lt;/em>;发挥&lt;a href=&quot;/2016/01/strengths-based-coaching-can-actually-weaken-you&quot;>;人们的优势&lt;/a>;，而是帮助他们发展&lt;em>;新的&lt;/em>;优势，因此它们变得更加多才多艺。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我们都有一种自然的倾向，让世界适应我们当前的技能，这样我们就可以“用更少的钱做更多的事” ”并针对懒惰效率进行优化，而不是延伸目标或获取新技能。事实上，除非你的员工在任何专业领域都处于前 1%（根据定义，这只能适用于极少数人），否则他们将更容易成为万事通，尤其是因为随着您学习的每一项新任务或技能，都会有许多与其他任务、工作和职业相关的新的基础技能。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这也将增加多样性和包容性。正如哈佛大学的 Joseph Fuller 和 Christina Langer 以及 Burning Glass Institute 的 Matt Sigelman &lt;a href=&quot;/2022/02/skills-based-hiring-is-on-the-rise&quot;>;指出&lt;/a>;：“向技能的转变基于招聘的招聘将为大量潜在员工提供机会，近年来，这些潜在员工经常因学位膨胀而被排除在考虑之外。”如果组织抱怨无法找到多元化和创造性的人才，他们应该停止在相同的地方和方式中寻找人才。&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;4) 投资于中层管理人员&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;作为&lt;a href=&quot;/2023/07/3-ways-to-reenergize-your-team-when-morale-is-low&quot;>;艾米·埃德蒙森和我&lt;/a>;最近指出，管理者掌握着释放人类潜力的钥匙在工作中，尤其是当面临的挑战是振兴、重新激发和重新构想人才时。即使在人工智能时代之前，中层管理人员的作用就至关重要，占团队的 30% 到 40% &lt;/a>;，但该角色的复杂性大大增加。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;从历史上看，经理是具有经过验证的技术专长和作为个人贡献者的过去出色表现的人。如今，他们不仅需要了解“经典”管理任务（雇用合适的人员，给他们正确的任务和方向，利用反馈来激励他们，并提高团队绩效），还需要了解一些非常复杂的具体新挑战，例如作为&lt;a href=&quot;/2020/10/how-to-manage-a-hybrid-team&quot;>;管理混合&lt;/a>;和虚拟团队，&lt;a href=&quot;/2022/12/a-guide-to- Building-psychological-safety-on-your-team&quot;>;创造心理安全&lt;/a>;、&lt;a href=&quot;/2021/05/5-strategies-to-infuse-di-into-your-organization&quot;>;提升 DEIB &lt;/a>;（包括雇用和激励与自己不同的人），以及帮助人们&lt;a href=&quot;/2023/06/what-will-working-with-ai-really-require&quot;>;管理人员-人工智能时代&lt;/a>;，包括引发的所有不确定性和压力。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;简而言之，从未有过更好的&lt;a href=&quot;https://qz.com/the-case-for -investing-a-lot-more-in-middle-managers-in-1850548862&quot;>;有时间投资&lt;/a>;中层管理人员，特别是利用关键的软技能，这些技能可能使他们能够适应未来跟上技术进步并推动组织期望从新创新中实现价值。&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;5) 投资于领导技能&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;如果您担心人工智能推动的未来，但仍然认为人类将成为图片的一部分，那么你应该担心对你的领导者进行预先培训，因为他们（仍然）将负责制定和销售公司的战略，并在明天的不确定时期推动其文化的演变。在某种程度上，这仍然是关于提拔具有正确软技能（根据步骤 1）的个人并发展这些技能。这也是关于&lt;a href=&quot;/2019/08/hire-leaders-for-what-they-can-do-not-what-they-have-done&quot;>;继续前进&lt;/a>;并了解当今的顶级领导者可能不适合未来，尤其是因为他们的成功是建立在复制过去行之有效的基础上的，这往往是改变或学习新事物的障碍。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;重要的是，投资于领导力意味着利用使人们能够有效协作并成为高绩效团队的技能。这不是为了将个人提升到高级职位或荣耀地位，更不是为了通常支持的人气竞赛&lt;a href=&quot;/2017/10/what-science-says-about-identifying-high-pottial-employees&quot;>;“高潜力”提名&lt;/a>;——更确切地说，它是关于人们必须具备的品质，以激励、激励和带领他人进入一个肯定会包括人工智能的未来，但理想情况下也应该被定义为人类人工智能时代。这是当今领导力面临的严峻挑战。如果组织能够升级其领导力选拔系统，从复制过去的成功经验转向选择和培养未来的技能，那么所有其他挑战都将变得更容易。特别是，这意味着不再强调“文化契合度”、过去的表现和技术专长等因素，而是更多地关注学习能力、好奇心、正直和人际交往能力。更重要的是，如果组织真正对利用多样性感兴趣，他们必须优先考虑&lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/what-makes-an-inclusive-leader&quot;>;包容性&lt;/a>;&lt;a href=&quot;https:// www.businessinsider.com/key-attributes-inclusive-leader-professor-business-psychology?r=US&amp;IR=T&quot;>;领导力&lt;/a>; 和认知多样性，打破领导力概况的同质性。&lt;/p >; &lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;。 。 .&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;技术总是在变化，但为了确保这些变化实际上是一种进化（即促进进步），我们必须尽一切努力使人类能够开发和部署相关人才来收获技术的潜在好处。尽管这绝不是理所当然的，但我们应该对我们的物种继续适应其自身技术发明的能力充满信心。&lt;/p>;

&lt;span>;&lt;p>;经理们倾向于将流动性视为财务问题，但面对销售和运营团队的行为，管理者往往将流动性视为财务问题。以及他们如何沟通和合作——可以直接影响公司的现金状况。为了改善这种工作关系，重点是协调团队、提高预测质量、将预测映射到供应链，并优化盈利能力而不是可预测性。遵循这些步骤可以减少公司的营运资金需求并增加收入和现金流。&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>;

&lt;/div>; &lt;p>;现在不是缺钱或长期持有的时候库存，或两者兼而有之：当利率&lt;a href=&quot;https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FEDFUNDS&quot;>;是一年前的两倍&lt;/a>;并且很难找到循环信贷时，情况就不同了。当&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WEO/Issues/2023/07/10/world-economic-outlook-update-july-2023&quot;>;国际货币基金组织项目&lt; /a>; 明年世界发达经济体将仅增长 1.4%。当预测和平衡供需比以往任何时候都更加困难时，情况就不是这样了，供需受到大流行的冲击，尚未恢复平衡。当&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.uscourts.gov/news/2023/07/31/bankruptcy-filings-rise-10-percent&quot;>;企业破产数量&lt;/a>;低于与去年相比增长了 23%。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;即使没有破产，许多原本可行的公司也可能面临因成本上升、大流行导致的客户行为变化、挥之不去的供应链问题、不稳定的商业环境下销售的不确定性，以及寻找短期资金几乎肯定的困难。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;流动性通常被视为财务问题，但事实上，运营发挥着重要作用。在预防或解决现金问题方面发挥主导作用。改进运营、销售和财务协同运作方式的公司可以产生现金和息税折旧摊销前利润 (EBITDA)，而且数量通常相当多，而且速度非常快。加强销售和运营规划使公司能够在不受外部干扰的情况下掌握自己的命运——这在目前是一种特别有用的能力。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;中型市场公司通过进行这种转型可以获得很多好处。我们已经看到公司在短短几个月内将营运资本提高了 20-30%，并且 EBITDA 大幅增加。例如，一家私募股权拥有的维生素和营养补充剂制造商的 EBITDA 增长了 10%，这主要是因为其海外销售和分销（其大部分增长潜力所在）与美国的制造业务更加紧密地联系在一起。这有助于降低生产和运输成本。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;出于同样的原因，糟糕的销售和运营规划的影响严重打击了中间市场。部分原因是这些公司如果需要外部资本就会处于不利地位。在 AlixPartners 的 &lt;a href=&quot;https://features.alixpartners.com/turnaround-transformation-survey-2023/&quot;>;2023 年调查&lt;/a>;中，96% 的扭亏为盈和重组专家表示，中间市场最有潜力当今资本限制带来的风险。中型企业也受到威胁，因为它们经常向大型跨国公司销售产品，而大型跨国公司越来越多&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/some-companies-are-take-longer-to-pay-suppliers-尽管- recovery-11623058200&quot;>;稍后使用他们的实力向供应商付款，&lt;/a>;在某些情况下试图锁定他们在大流行期间赢得的轻松条款。由于中间市场公司往往多元化程度较低，因此更容易受到冲击。而且，由于它们的规模，它们的“流动性跑道”——现金短缺演变成危机之前的时间——比大公司短。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;每家公司都有某种调整供应和供应的流程。要求。在较小的公司中，这通常是非常非正式的：销售带有预测，首席财务官对其进行折扣，生产增加一些作为缓冲，每个季度人们都会进行调整。许多企业拥有更复杂的流程，但往往比较僵化，对市场的微弱信号反应迟钝，如果业务出乎意料地好，就会导致生产中的消防演习；如果情况不佳，就会出现减价销售。在这两种情况下，该流程的重点都是平稳管理生产，而不是产生现金和利润。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;所需要的（尤其是中间市场）是一个转变的销售和运营规划流程，以实现这一目标使管理人员能够调整运营以增加现金生成和盈利能力。这种转变有四个要素：运营、销售和财务之间保持一致的团队。 &lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;当这些团队协调一致时，他们&lt;strong>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong>;就能够了解公司如何使用和产生现金。 “对齐”是关键词。运营和销售计划应该在跨职能的“作战室”中进行管理，但除非所有参与者都明确受到影响现金生成和利润的项目的激励，否则它不会起作用，而这些项目通常不属于 KPI 运营和销售轨道。在大多数公司中，运营团队的衡量标准是货物成本、缺陷率、机器利用率等；销售团队倾向于跟踪和奖励销量，并针对促销等提供特殊奖励。这些激励措施应该改变，以包括现金和营运资本衡量标准（例如，库存天数、平均折扣、应收账款平均未清天数）。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;预测也需要重新预测，因此他们对预测水平进行了建模生产和销售的情况会影响企业的所有三个视图：损益表、现金流量表和资产负债表。该团队还需要了解整个企业的流动性需求、流动性的最大威胁以及最大的现金来源，即哪些产品或业务线消耗或产生最多的现金。这些揭示了您可以利用哪些杠杆。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;更严格和灵活的预测。&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;首席财务官将销售团队的预测下调&lt;a href=&quot;/2021/03/ to-maximize-growth-get-sales-and-finance-in-sync&quot;>;高达 25%&lt;/a>;，部分原因是销售团队往往过于乐观，他们的预测有时不够站得住脚。另一个问题是他们的时间范围。根据我们的经验，最好建立滚动的中长期（3-14 个月）需求视图，使用它们来生成足够可靠的三个月预测，以便您可以做出采购和营销决策，并对其进行调整每周或每月。太远了，计划就不可靠；太远了，计划就不可靠。太接近，您就无法采取战略性行动。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;不要忘记（正如许多公司所做的那样）使用客户流失和忠诚度数据来测试、验证和调整预测。您需要通过四种方式调整对需求的看法：首先，为了清楚地了解现金和 EBITDA 的来源（或不来源），建立利润和数量的图景；您想知道哪些产品和客户提供最多和最少的利润，并且&lt;a href=&quot;/1987/09/manage-customers-for-profits-not-just-sales&quot;>;密切关注&lt;/a>;遵守他们的命令和行为。其次，&lt;a href=&quot;/2022/09/setting-your-annual-budget-amid-economic-uncertainty&quot;>;正如您应该根据总体预算制定的那样，&lt;/a>;为长期观点创建情景 - 例如，需求会是高、中还是低，或者如果销售突然转向您销售的最低价格或利润最低的商品，会发生什么。第三，预先确定可以告诉你某个场景是否即将发生的指标；这将使忽略警告变得更加困难。最后，使用月度和季度审查不仅可以跟踪计划的预测，还可以重新验证其前提。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;同样严格的供应图。&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;应包括材料、组件、和劳动力的可用性。除此之外，您还需要确定交货时间最长的组件或供应品，或者您对上游条件的了解告诉您要警惕价格或供应冲击的组件或供应品。许多提供商帮助公司建立供应链“控制塔”，以近乎实时地跟踪可用性和定价，通常是在人工智能的帮助下。这些曾经几乎是跨国公司的专属领域，但现在大多数中型市场的预算都可以承受。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;优化盈利能力而非可预测性的运营。&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;运营计划保证不间断地生产利润最低的产品并不好。凭借您现在掌握的有关产品和客户盈利能力的知识、更好的现场信息流以及强大的跨职能团队，您现在可以利用您的运营所需的任何灵活性将生产从一个地点或产品转移到另一个地点或优先考虑来自盈利客户的订单。您可以对库存管理进行类似的更改。从战略角度来看，库存可以是一种流动性消耗，也可以是一种新的客户获取工具——“坏”或“好”库存——并进行相应的管理。从长远来看，您可以重新调整资本支出方向，以提高对现金和利润最直接影响的领域的运营灵活性。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;像这样的计划释放了 1700 万美元的营运资金 - 减少了约180 天——对于一家总部位于密西西比河谷、销售额达 20 亿美元的消费品公司。由于大型在线零售商突然抢走了当地商店的业务，新冠疫情对其供应链造成严重破坏，并导致需求大幅波动，该公司的业务失去了平衡。它的预测模型被拍摄；由于无法知道销售额来自何处，一个业务部门支付了近 100 万美元的逾期交货罚款和空运费用。根据猜测，工厂生产了错误的产品组合，采购部门采购的某些零部件太少，而另一些零部件采购过多，导致满足率（按时全额完成订单的百分比）从 95% 骤降至 75% 左右。为了满足订单需求，运营团队储备了比公司所需多 1200 万美元的成品库存。以前解决这个问题的尝试都是零散的——供应和零部件、生产计划、预测——而不是系统地解决。我们与他们合作建立了一个粗略的产能模型，可以比以前提前几个月揭示潜在的供需失衡；提高预测团队的分析技能；并制定每月一次的销售和运营规划会议的节奏，让数据和决策者齐聚一堂。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;•••&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;如果没有系统性的观点，这场游戏中每个参与者的激励和良好意愿——采购、生产和销售——几乎总是会导致游戏失去平衡。运营团队处于将系统整合在一起的独特位置，因为他们首先感受到痛苦，表现为仓库没有被清空或订单无法满足。当现金和 EBITDA 出现痛苦时，已经晚了——有时已经太晚了。&lt;/p>;

>; 今年学习和发展计划投入 3800 亿美元&lt;/a>;。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但我们需要做得更好。我们知道，经过数十年的尝试，与 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.industryweek.com/operations/continuous-improvement/article/21267990/widespread-lean-adoption-would-make-the-us 相关的技能-more-competitive&quot;>;精益制造&lt;/a>;、&lt;a href=&quot;https://pmessentials.us/agile-better-adoption-low/&quot;>;敏捷开发&lt;/a>;和&lt;a href=&quot;/2022 /12/the-failure-of-the-dei-industrial-complex&quot;>;克服无意识偏见&lt;/a>;（仅举几例）在大多数组织中都没有得到充分采用。事实上，麦肯锡最近的一份报告 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/McKinsey/Business%20Functions/Organization/Our%20Insights/Beyond%20hiring%20How%20companies%20are%20reskilling %20to%20address%20talent%20gaps/Beyond-hiring-How-companies-are-reskilling.pdf&quot;>;发现&lt;/a>;，87% 的受访公司预计在未来五年内会出现技能差距。&lt;/p >; &lt;p>;更多培训并不是答案。我们不能简单地将员工派往专注于当前流行的任何熟练程度的研讨会并期望取得成果。重要的是建立连贯的基于技能的战略。我们必须认真思考要针对哪些特定技能，谁必须学习这些技能，以及什么样的教育、经验和接触组合才能有效地创建我们应对未来挑战所需的基于技能的组织。&lt; /p>; &lt;p>;例如，在 Todd 担任执行副总裁的软件公司 PKWARE，该公司将超过 1% 的收入投入到销售培训上，重点是围绕特定流程调整团队。虽然员工接受了教育，但未能产生预期的影响，因为员工没有持续获得维持最初改进所需的指导和实时指导。&lt;/p>;

over three days. Each night they also attended a structured workshop that helped them process what they observed. After returning to the office, they received continued peer mentoring for an extended period and were encouraged, in turn, to train their own teams on storytelling. This not only helped spread the skills, but gave the leaders the opportunity to further deepen their own proficiency as they taught others. The result: a dramatic improvement in winning deals and a significant boost in revenue growth.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Anders Ericsson, who has spent decades researching expertise, points to the importance of &lt;a href=&quot;/2007/07/the-making-of-an-expert&quot;>;deliberate practice&lt;/a>; in developing world-class performers. Mere instruction is not enough, you also need to practice skills, identify areas for improvement, and receive coaching. It is this combination of education, experience, and exposure that improve performance.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;The 70/20/10 Learning Model&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;If our organizations are to learn the skills needed to win the future, we recommend a “70/20/10” learning model incorporating education, exposure, and experience. Here&#39;s how it works:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;10% Formal Instruction (Education):&lt;/strong>;&amp;nbsp;This portion of the learning strategy involves structured educational experiences, such as the storytelling workshops the Wipro executives attended at night. Other examples include webinars or in-person courses that focus on specific skills.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;20% Social Learning (Exposure):&lt;/strong>;&amp;nbsp;Social learning involves learning from others. This is the role the professional storytellers played in the Wipro example. Other options include mentoring, coaching, or peer-to-peer interactions. For example, setting up a mentorship program within an organization can help employees learn from more experienced colleagues. Regular team-building activities can also foster a culture of continuous learning and help improve skills.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;70% Learning in the Flow of Work (Experience):&lt;/strong>;&amp;nbsp;This is the most significant part of the learning strategy. It involves learning on the job through real-life experiences and tasks. For example, employees can improve their problem-solving skills by working on complex projects. Regular feedback sessions can help employees reflect on their performance and identify areas for improvement. When the participants of the storytelling workshop continued to teach their own colleagues and apply it in their business pitches and reviews, they got precious hands-on experience that deepened their storytelling skills.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is very different from more traditional corporate learning approaches that focus primarily on MBA-style classroom instruction, like the one General Electric made famous at the Management Development Institute at Crotonville during the Jack Welch era. To be successful in the 70/20/10 learning model, managers need to take an active role as &lt;a href=&quot;/2019/11/the-leader-as-coach&quot;>;coaches&lt;/a>;, rather than as taskmasters, working to mentor their staff to improve performance. At the same time, Learning and Development (L&amp;amp;D) departments are going to have to do more than merely source curricula; they need to collaborate intensively with leaders to design personalized learning environments. Learning needs to be inclusive, continuous, and collaborative.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, as part of a regional initiative to reinvigorate the Texas Panhandle region, BOC Bank sought to help its managers make the transition from seeing their roles as performance evaluators to upskilling coaches. The L&amp;amp;D team didn&#39;t start with a preexisting learning plan, but first spent time with leaders to identify tasks for performance improvement. Those tasks were then broken down into skills that individual employees needed to learn, and the L&amp;amp;D team mentored managers as they took the lead coaching their staff through personalized learning plans, using the 70/20/10 model. Within nine months, they started seeing measurable results in terms of the company&#39;s standard business metrics. “Our adoption of the 70/20/10 model is directly fueling our ability to innovate, enabling us to build distinctive core software that sets us apart in the banking sector,” said Alex O&#39;Brien, CEO of the bank.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If we are to compete for the future, we need to shift from a “war for talent” mindset to a skills-based mindset. Talent isn&#39;t an innate property that firms can attract and bid for, but a capacity that needs to be built — and in any case, the most vital skills of the future don&#39;t exist yet. In the same way that venture capitalists invest in and manage portfolios of companies, corporate leaders need to pursue portfolios of skills, divesting in some that become obsolete while doubling down on others that begin to pay off.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The future of work will not be determined by technology, but by creating the right mix of education, exposure, and experience needed to develop skills and put them to work, creating a vastly more productive workplace and economy.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 06 Oct 2023 22:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[How to Avoid the Unexpected Consequences of Your DEI Policy]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/10/how-to-avoid-the-unexpected-consequences-of-your-dei-policy]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/10/Oct23_06_1257013702.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;MirageC/Getty Images&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;Will the DEI policy you&amp;#8217;re about to implement actually hurt some of the people you&amp;#8217;re trying to help? New research on this question shows that, yes, this can happen if you fail to take a systems-level view &amp;#8212; but the good news is there are three key ways to avoid unintended consequences. First, consider subgroups. Think about variation within the group of people the policy is aimed at helping; for example, whether the experiences of most women employees might differ from women managers. Second, think big. Recognize that the interactions between people at your organization are diverse and complex. When policies reverberate, they can harm groups or subgroups in unanticipated ways. Third, track closely. Monitor the policy as it is being rolled out for any negative effects on employees.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/10/how-to-avoid-the-unexpected-consequences-of-your-dei-policy?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/10/how-to-avoid-the-unexpected-consequences-of-your-dei-policy?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;While many managers are attempting to improve inequalities facing employees by implementing diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) policies, &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/07/why-diversity-programs-fail&quot;>;these policies often have unexpected, negative consequences for the employees&lt;/a>; — including those the policies are trying to help. How can managers avoid this?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/epub/10.1177/00018392231174235&quot;>;My research&lt;/a>; shows that there is a need to take a systems-level view of inequality when implementing DEI policies. That is, when designing and implementing a policy, managers must consider how it will reverberate throughout the organization — and how it might ultimately backfire.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;The Policy&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;At the midsize American professional services organization I studied, leaders had the well-intentioned aim of implementing a flexible work policy that allowed employees more control over where and when they worked. The company was already considered life- and family-friendly by employees, and leaders wanted to cement this, both because it would help current employees&#39; well-being and also because it could provide the company with a competitive edge in hiring. Leaders also recognized that these policies could help women in particular, because at this professional organization — &lt;a href=&quot;/2022/09/the-surprising-benefits-of-work-life-support&quot;>;as in many others&lt;/a>; — women performed more family care than men.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Once the policy was rolled out, it did in fact help many employees. And as anticipated, I found that the policy helped women in particular integrate and balance work and life demands. For instance, it helped them break up their schedule and spend more time with their kids, and lessen the time they spent commuting so they could spend time with family.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;The Problem&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;However, what the organization&#39;s leaders — and I — did not anticipate was how the flexible work policy harmed a specific group of women: women managers. This was despite the fact that these managers were almost all very vocal supporters of improving gender equality, and had advocated for and supported a wide variety of other women- and family-friendly initiatives, including backup childcare, onsite daycare, and a women speaker series.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;How did this happen? My research found that many women managers had developed a managerial style focused on close, day-to-day interactions with subordinates. For instance, many would regularly stop by the offices of each of their subordinates daily, asking them how they were doing and if they could offer any help or guidance with their work. Others would work with their doors open so that subordinates could stop by their office whenever they needed help. Employees appreciated these managers&#39; efforts, not only because they provided more immediate task-based assistance but also because, over time, these managers came to know their employees very well and could offer custom-tailored advice on project staffing, career training, and so on.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Importantly, the women managers did not develop this managerial style in a vacuum. Rather, it seemed to reflect stereotypes they faced on the job: They experienced pressure to be helpful and communal, rather than direct and assertive like their male manager counterparts.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The problem from the women managers&#39; perspective was that the flexible work policy would make the style they had developed difficult to maintain. While video calls were an option, managers did not view them as an easy or natural way to spark interaction. Others pointed out that with their subordinates working different schedules with varied hours, this meant that they needed to be available at a broader range of hours as well if they were to remain available and helpful to their workers. Not only would this be difficult for anyone to do, it also threatened to make women managers&#39; own work-life conflict much worse because it made it hard for them to have time with their own families.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;While my research was specifically on gender, what I found was consistent with &lt;a href=&quot;/2020/07/update-your-dei-playbook&quot;>;other&lt;/a>; &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/00018392231183649&quot;>;research&lt;/a>; that emphasizes the need to consider &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.aom.org/doi/abs/10.5465/amr.2017.0087&quot;>;the whole organization to effectively implement a DEI effort&lt;/a>;, as well as research that highlights the importance of considering &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.aom.org/doi/abs/10.5465/amr.2017.0062&quot;>;how individuals engage and interact with one another within the organizational system&lt;/a>;. This is in addition, of course, to considering other important causes of DEI policy failure, such as &lt;a href=&quot;/2022/10/is-your-dei-progress-undermined-by-attention-inequality&quot;>;various&lt;/a>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/03/to-overcome-resistance-to-dei-understand-whats-driving-it&quot;>;individual-level biases&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Avoiding Unexpected Consequences from Your DEI Policy&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Given that DEI policies can reverberate in organizations in unexpected ways — and potentially undermine hard-won progress on equity- and equality-related outcomes — it is important for managers to anticipate such issues. My research, and complementary research by other scholars (some of which I detail below) presents three key suggestions for how managers can limit the chance of their policies backfiring. These suggestions are all rooted in taking a systems-level view of inequality when designing and implementing DEI policies.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;1. Consider subgroups.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;When designing a DEI policy, think about variation within the group of people the policy is aimed at helping. In my research, there was an important difference between the experiences of most women employees (who benefited from the policy) and women managers (who were harmed).&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As another example, imagine if managers attempted to help Black employees through creating a peer mentorship program. This program might provide vital help, advice, and connection at work for enrolled Black employees, who researchers finds are &lt;a href=&quot;/2022/02/20-of-white-employees-have-sponsors-only-5-of-black-employees-do&quot;>;much less likely to have internal sponsors when compared to white workers&lt;/a>;, despite the fact that such aid is &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/06/a-better-approach-to-mentorship#:~:text=The%20evidence%20is%20clear%3A%2075,mentor%20are%20happy%20at%20work.&quot;>;vital for career success&lt;/a>;. However, if there are &lt;a href=&quot;/2021/11/what-do-black-executives-really-want&quot;>;relatively few senior Black employees in a company&lt;/a>; — a common occurrence given historical patterns of systemic racism — then these few employees may each have many mentees. The unexpected, unanticipated result may be that senior Black employees end up spending a lot of time coaching junior Black employees instead of focusing on pushing their own careers forward.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The lesson here is not that DEI policies should not be introduced, of course. It is that with better planning, such negative results can be anticipated and curbed. And once noticed — whether this is before or even after rollout — solutions can be found. For instance, in our example, could senior Black employees be relieved of other “helping” duties so common in organizations to free up more of their time? Or could these employees be given more &lt;a href=&quot;/2020/07/update-your-dei-playbook&quot;>;“glamor work”&lt;/a>; to help them shine? In general, the point here is to not think about a given group — women, LGBTQ+ people, Black people, and so on — monolithically, but rather to recognize the varying organizational ranks, roles, and tasks of employees as well as their &lt;a href=&quot;/2022/06/an-intersectional-approach-to-inclusion-at-work&quot;>;intersectional identities&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;2. Think big.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;A systems-level perspective draws attention to the fact that &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/01/todays-most-critical-workplace-challenges-are-about-systems&quot;>;the interactions and connections between people in organizations are diverse and complex&lt;/a>;. As my research demonstrates, when policies reverberate, they can harm groups or subgroups in ways that are entirely unanticipated by organizational leaders and policy designers.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For instance, well-intentioned “ban the box” initiatives aimed at preventing discrimination against people with criminal records — and adopted by many companies and mandated in over a hundred states, cities, and counties in the United States — have also been found to in some cases &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/21/upshot/ban-the-box-an-effort-to-stop-discrimination-may-actually-increase-it.html&quot;>;increase racial discrimination against Black applicants&lt;/a>;, because when these policies are in place, it seems employers are more likely to incorrectly presume Black applicants have a criminal past.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Again, the solution here is not to disavow DEI policies. Rather, it is important to think big when considering how policies could potentially result in unexpected negative consequences for workers, because you never know where or when such consequences will arise. To do this, gather &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/11/why-diverse-teams-are-smarter&quot;>;a diverse group of employees to brainstorm&lt;/a>; what potential challenges could come about from the introduction of a new DEI policy. Also read about and research the experiences of other companies that have implemented similar policies, to see what (if any) unintended consequences may have arisen through their policy adoption.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;3. Track closely.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Monitor the policy as it is being rolled out for any negative effects on employees. There are different layers to monitoring. One is to get immediate, qualitative feedback on employees&#39; experiences through focus groups or anonymous suggestion boxes that let employees provide comments without fear of backlash. Longer term, it is important to analyze internal administrative data to check that there are no concerning or unexpected patterns. This includes looking to see if there is variation between groups or subgroups (eg, women versus men, or black women versus white women) on important markers of individual career success such as performance evaluations, salary, bonuses, and promotions.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some organizations have even started piloting their DEI initiatives before rolling them out organization-wide, and such efforts can improve policy quality by identifying issues before the policy has even been officially implemented. Ericsson, a global telecommunications company, &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/04/why-you-should-start-ab-testing-your-dei-initiatives&quot;>;tested a policy intervention aimed at improving women&#39;s interest in internal job openings&lt;/a>;. This testing helped Ericsson identify the message that seemed most likely to decrease the gender gap. And before rolling out a flexible work policy more broadly, &lt;a href=&quot;/2009/10/making-time-off-predictable-and-required&quot;>;Boston Consulting Group tested it with smaller groups of consultants&lt;/a>;. Here, it is important to collect data on employees&#39; experiences at baseline (before rollout) to compare with their experiences after policy implementation&lt;/p>; &lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;. 。 .&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;DEI policies remain important ways to achieve positive improvements in equality within organizations. These three steps — which take a systems-level view of inequality — are purposeful, meaningful changes that managers can enact to design effective and impactful DEI policies. Of course, the research I present here is just a starting point. More is needed — particularly that accounts for different actors&#39; perspectives and the connections between them — to understand how DEI policies can be designed to best help employees.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 06 Oct 2023 21:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[A New Approach to Writing Job Descriptions]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/10/a-new-approach-to-writing-job-descriptions]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/10/Oct23_06_4600878.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;Juan Moyano/Stocksy&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;Traditional job descriptions can&amp;#8217;t keep up with the rate of change in real roles in today&amp;#8217;s organizations.

As new technologies disrupt processes and require new skills, and as companies are moving toward more and more project-based work, we are beginning to see the evolution of job descriptions away from static, holistic prescriptions that follow an employee for years to dynamic guidance that changes based on needs.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, a company that hired an employee for a certain set of tasks might find that four months later, a different set of tasks takes strategic priority. Even though that employee has the right skills for the new tasks, the employee can point to their job description to decline to do the new task by saying that it wasn&#39;t what they were hired to do — or, if they take on the new tasks, their job description becomes quickly out of date.&lt;/p>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;p>;This article is one in a series on “Creative Resilience: Leading in an Age of Discontinuity,” the theme of the 15th annual &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.druckerforum.org/&quot;>;Global Peter Drucker Forum.&lt;/a>; See the conference program &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.druckerforum.org/2023/program/&quot;>;here&lt;/a>;. &lt;/p>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;Because most job descriptions are firmly embedded in the employee&#39;s core area of work, they also tend to encourage silos in the organization by discouraging cross-functional collaboration. Rigid job descriptions also discourage experimentation with new technologies that may have been unimaginable at the time the description was written. And finally, narrow job descriptions can mean that an employee isn&#39;t able to fulfill the full range of their talents at work, leaving them dissatisfied.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In response, companies are starting to approach job descriptions in new, more flexible ways based on outcomes, skills, and teams. I&#39;ll describe each of these in turn, but first let&#39;s look at how job descriptions came to be what we know them as today, and what they do.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Why Job Descriptions?&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Modern job descriptions can be traced back to the industrial revolution. As factories and other large organizations became more common, there was a need to define roles and responsibilities more clearly to improve efficiency and productivity. This led to the creation of standardized job titles and descriptions, which outlined each position&#39;s tasks, duties, and requirements .&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;By the mid-20th century they became even more formalized and detailed.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Today, job descriptions are used for several purposes:&lt;/p>; &lt;ol>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Recruitment&lt;/strong>;: They help prospective applicants understand whether they would be a good fit for the position by providing a clear outline of what a role involves and what skills and qualifications are required.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Role clarification&lt;/strong>;: They help clarify the responsibilities, tasks, and expectations of a role, helping to avoid role ambiguity and conflict.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Performance management&lt;/strong>;: They serve as a benchmark for assessing employee performance.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;HR management&lt;/strong>;: They help plan employee development, set compensation, and serve as legal documentation.&lt;/li>; &lt;/ol>; &lt;p>;So how can job descriptions be made more flexible but still address these needs?&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;The More-Flexible Approaches&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;We&#39;re seeing three new approaches taking hold as companies grapple with rapidly-changing, project-based roles.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;&lt;strong>;Outcome-focused role descriptions&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Some companies are beginning to articulate the outcomes expected from a role rather than the specific tasks or duties the employee is required to perform. This approach provides flexibility for the employee to determine the best way to achieve those results, fostering innovation and initiative and, importantly, allowing them to change their approach as conditions shift.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For instance, instead of a sales manager&#39;s job description listing tasks such as “meet key clients once per quarter ” or “prepare sales reports on a monthly basis,” it would describe outcomes such as “increase regional sales by 15%” and “improve customer retention by 10%.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Google uses results-oriented job descriptions to keep their top talent motivated. Laszlo Bock, the former senior vice president of people operations, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Work-Rules-Insights-Inside-Transform/dp/1455554790&quot;>;explains&lt;/a>;:&amp;nbsp;“At Google, we believe that results-oriented job descriptions are essential for attracting and retaining top talent. When employees know what is expected of them and how they will be measured, they are more likely to be motivated and engaged in their work.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, traditionally, a design ethicist job description might have listed analyzing Google&#39;s search algorithm for bias once per month, or keeping a privacy risk log up to date. But in an outcomes-based job description, a design ethicist is instead given the broader mandate of identifying ethical risks in Google&#39;s products or developing guidelines for the ethical design of products. That gives both the employee and Google leeway for the specific tasks of the design ethicist to change as technologies develop — as generative AI is introduced into Google&#39;s offerings, for instance.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Skills-focused role descriptions&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Other companies create dynamic documents that outline the skills and capabilities an employee brings to a position or should aim to develop. With this approach, the emphasis shifts from the tasks a person is supposed to complete to their talents and how those can be applied within company projects.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For a company to execute on this approach means identifying the skills and qualifications needed for each role and developing training programs and career paths that help employees build those skills. The aim is to fully utilize and develop an individual&#39;s abilities and strengths, which can lead to increased job satisfaction as well as performance. It also means that companies can quickly assemble teams of people with the skills and experience needed to tackle specific projects or initiatives.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, a data analyst with superior visualization skills could seamlessly shift from creating complex data models to crafting visual reports, depending on project needs. The analyst would follow a specialized training regimen tailored to enhance specific skills, such as advanced visualization techniques and data storytelling. By focusing on the analyst&#39;s unique strengths and broader skill set, the organization not only hones their existing expertise but also creates a more well-rounded, versatile professional.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Team-based role descriptions&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Lastly, instead of giving each team member a job description, some companies assign individuals to teams that are given a collective set of objectives, outcomes, and deliverables. It is then up to the team to collectively decide how each member will contribute.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A well known example is Spotify, where employees are part of small, cross-functional teams called “squads,” each of which has a specific mission. Each squad autonomously decides how to meet its objectives best, relying on collective decision-making and their deep knowledge of each member&#39;s strengths and preferences. The teams meet frequently to discuss challenges, assess progress, realign goals, and resolve any conflicts or bottlenecks that result from the task distribution.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Overcoming Challenges&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Beyond simple resistance to change, there are a number of challenges that companies moving away from traditional job descriptions need to address.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The most basic is unclear job and performance expectations. Without a traditional job description, how does an employee know what is expected of them? How can a manager evaluate their performance objectively and follow fair compensation and promotion practices without clear guidelines in hand?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are other ways that managers can work with their teams to define roles and responsibilities and create a shared understanding of what each person is responsible for. For example, let&#39;s say you manage a team of software developers, and your company is shifting to team-based job descriptions. You might work with your team to create a skills matrix that identifies the skills and capabilities of each team member and then use tools like Agile methodology or Kanban boards to help manage workloads and prioritize tasks.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For recruitment, a competency-based interview process is a more effective way to assess a candidate&#39;s suitability for a flexible, dynamic role than a traditional interview, which often focuses on the candidate&#39;s experience and qualifications.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For performance evaluations, tools such as 360-degree feedback can help a manager to assess the employee&#39;s performance in various areas, including their skills, capabilities, and contributions to the team.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;More thorny issues can include legal compliance —such as Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) position status in the US — which can be challenging without a formal job description. Creating a “role compliance document” for each employee that provides a broad outline of the job and details such as job classification (exempt or non-exempt) can help here. Also, monitor employee tasks, responsibilities, and actual working hours to ensure that they align with&amp;nbsp;labor&amp;nbsp;guidelines; depending on your circumstances, this could be a periodic review or meticulous record-keeping enabled by modern HR software.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As organizations become more agile and responsive and technology enables new forms of work in the coming years, the trend towards project-based work and the need for more flexible job descriptions will continue. This radical disruption requires a shift in mindset and culture and asks individuals, managers, leaders, and organizations to experiment, learn, and adapt to new working methods. But with the right mindset and approach can lead to a more agile, responsive, and innovative organization better equipped to meet future challenges.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 06 Oct 2023 20:25:02 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Research: Can You Tell How You Come Across on Zoom?]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/10/research-can-you-tell-how-you-come-across-on-zoom]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/10/Oct23_04_-5082558_-6953835.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;HBR Staff/Pexels&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;If you want to make a good impression and gauge what a colleague actually thinks of you, should you meet in-person or over videoconference? This is the question the authors explored in their research. The answer largely depends on whether you&amp;#8217;re feeling anxious about the social interaction. Most of us &amp;#8212; even the most socially confident &amp;#8212; have moments when we feel a bit more socially anxious than usual. In those cases, setting a meeting on Zoom might level out the playing field, allowing you to be as aware of your impression as someone who is feeling more secure. In brief, Zoom might give everyone an equal opportunity to adequately manage the impression they want to convey, which has important implications for both team leaders and their employees.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/10/research-can-you-tell-how-you-come-across-on-zoom?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/10/research-can-you-tell-how-you-come-across-on-zoom?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;You just started a new job. You might be especially curious about your reputation around the office, and the impression you are making on your colleagues. Do people think you&#39;re intelligent and friendly? Inevitably, we all care about the way we come across to others.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One reason we care so much about what people think of us is that it sets the basis for impression management. For example, if you realize that your new colleague thinks you are incompetent during your first project meeting, this gives you the opportunity to correct that misperception, which could be done by highlighting how your unique skillset is relevant to the project you&#39;re working on together. Alternatively, if you miss that cue, you might not be able to manage their impression of you, and before you know it, your reputation in the workplace might crystallize.&amp;nbsp;In short, knowing the impressions we make on others is a key step in smoothly navigating our professional and social interactions.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Now that we&#39;re in a hybrid world, these interactions might be just as likely to take place over videoconference as they are in-person, and you might have the leeway to choose whether to meet virtually or face-to-face with a colleague. So, here are the questions we set out to answer with our research: If you want to gauge what a new colleague really thinks of you, which should you choose? Are you a better impression manager in-person or on Zoom?&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;The Research&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;In our &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fpspp0000457&quot;>;research&lt;/a>;, we tested which of these two assumptions prevailed. To do so, we had 305 people come into our lab before the Covid-19 pandemic (in groups of four to eight) and 555 people join a Zoom session during the pandemic (again, in small groups of three to nine). People would meet one on one with new people for a couple of minutes, just like at a speed-networking event. This resulted in a total of 1,683 unique in-person interactions and 3,068 unique Zoom interactions.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After each meeting, they reported on how they perceived each other&#39;s personalities. For example, they would be asked: “To what extent do you see this person as intelligent?” Importantly, we also asked them to rate how they think their interaction partner perceived them: “Does this person think I&#39;m intelligent?”&lt;/p>; &lt;article-promo>; &lt;hbr-component type=&quot;promo&quot; is-insight=&quot;insight-center&quot; title=&quot;The Future of Work&quot; dek=&quot;Will your company adapt or be left behind?&quot; cta-text=&quot;&quot; href=&quot;/insight-center/the-future-of-work&quot;>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/insight-center/the-future-of-work&quot; style=&quot;color:black;text-decoration:none&quot;>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; Insight Center Collection &lt;/div>; &lt;h3>;The Future of Work&lt;/h3>; &lt;div>; Will your company adapt or be left behind? &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hbr-component>; &lt;/article-promo>; &lt;p>;It turns out that people are good at knowing how they come across to others after just a two-minute interaction. Importantly, they are equally accurate about the first impression they make on Zoom as in-person. In both contexts, people could tell if their peer saw them as very intelligent and not so friendly. Put differently, our research suggests that people are able to know how they come across to a peer or a new acquaintance on Zoom to the same extent as in-person. In other words, interacting on Zoom does not seem to interfere with people&#39;s ability to know their reputations.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What&#39;s more, knowing the impression you make on Zoom related to being liked more by others, as it does in-person. In other words, knowing how you&#39;re coming across to someone else was equally socially beneficial in Zoom interactions as it was in-person. So, knowing others&#39; impressions of us on Zoom seems to operate in the same way and carry the same benefits as it does in-person.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;All in all, what does this mean for your next interaction with your new colleagues? Should you think twice before deciding to meet them on Zoom? Contrary to some of our lay beliefs, at least when it comes to impression management, the decision to videoconference (vs. meet in-person) might not bear dramatic consequences for most people. But is this true for everyone?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3260965/&quot;>;Research shows&lt;/a>; that people who feel more socially anxious feel more comfortable online than in person. By being more comfortable, they might be less worried and better able to gauge how they are coming across over Zoom. In fact, in our in-person&amp;nbsp;events, more socially anxious people were less aware of the impression they made (compared to more secure people). But on Zoom, this disadvantage disappeared: Both the more and less anxious people were equally aware of the impressions they made on others.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But does this mean that Zoom helps the socially anxious and hurts the secure? It seems that it&#39;s a mix of both. Zoom appeared to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ilr.cornell.edu/news/research/zooming-socially-anxious-research-offers-insights&quot;>;give a little boost to the socially anxious&lt;/a>;, allowing them to know how they were coming across, perhaps because they were more comfortable on Zoom or because they could monitor themselves with the self-view feature. But at the same time, Zoom hindered more secure people&#39;s ability to detect how they came across. Perhaps having the self-view feature made them feel self-conscious, which could have been distracting.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Coming back to our main question: Should you plan your next meeting on Zoom or in-person if you want to gauge what a colleague actually thinks of you? The answer to this question largely comes down to how you&#39;re feeling about the interaction and whether you&#39;re feeling anxious about it. Most of us — even the most socially confident — have moments when we feel a bit more socially anxious than usual. In those cases, setting a meeting on Zoom might level out the playing field, allowing you to be as aware of your impression as someone who is feeling more secure. In brief, Zoom might give everyone an equal opportunity to adequately manage the impression they want to convey. This has important implications for both team leaders and their employees.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;The Implications&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;If team leaders are aware that some team members might be feeling more socially anxious, maybe due to a specific context or personality style, it might be helpful to schedule a videoconference call instead of an in-person meeting.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is not to say that the long-term solution is to avoid in-person interactions. However, while working up the social confidence to more smoothly navigate face-to-face meetings, more socially anxious people might benefit from using Zoom once in a while — especially for first impressions.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Employees can now feel more at ease knowing that videoconferencing does not hurt their impression management abilities. This means that instead of spending energy worrying about whether people “get them” on Zoom, they can focus more on the content of the meeting and actively engage with the team&#39;s ideas — and in that way, ultimately make a better impression.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Overall then, especially if you are feeling more socially anxious, Zooming once in a while might just be the nudge you need to get back some control over your reputation around the office.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 05 Oct 2023 23:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Managers Need to Relearn How Interest Rates Work]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/10/managers-need-to-relearn-how-interest-rates-work]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/10/Oct23_05_597318631.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;Eric Raptosh Photography/Getty Images&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;In the United States, short-term interest rates have been near zero for most of the last 15 years. With cost of capital this low, many managers have paid scant attention to the time value of money &amp;#8212; an essential concept in doing financial analysis. Now, with short-term rates above 5%, older managers need to brush off their instinctive feel for how capital costs affect investment prospects &amp;#8212; and a younger generation of managers needs to learn these skills for the first time.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/10/managers-need-to-relearn-how-interest-rates-work?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/10/managers-need-to-relearn-how-interest-rates-work?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;Imagine a planet where someone turns off gravity for 15 years. During this time, people get used to effortlessly flying around. But then gravity suddenly returns. Those accustomed to flying everywhere now need to navigate a weighted existence on the ground — and relearn basic skills such as walking. Walking may seem like a rudimentary activity, but if people don&#39;t do it for 15 years, muscle memory fades.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;That scenario is analogous to the effect of interest rates being near zero for approximately 15 years, then suddenly increasing to the 5% range. Fifteen years is a very long time in a business career. And adjusting to this new interest rate environment will require significant shifts in behavior and mindset for managers and investors alike. Older managers will need to re-build the natural intuition they once had for concepts like &lt;a href=&quot;https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/valuation/hurdle-rate-definition/&quot;>;hurdle rates&lt;/a>; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dcf.asp&quot;>;discounted cash flows&lt;/a>; — and a younger generation, those who entered the workforce after 2008, will need to develop an instinctive feel for these concepts from scratch.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This latter group might be surprised by a simple fact: short-term interest rates aren&#39;t normally near zero. But in 2008, in response to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007%E2%80%932008_financial_crisis&quot;>;Global Financial Crisis&lt;/a>;, the US Federal Reserve dramatically lowered the federal funds rate to boost the economy, implementing what became known as its “zero interest rate policy,” or ZIRP. Even as the economy recovered from the 2008 recession, the Fed kept rates low for an extended period of time, and then returned to this policy during the Covid-19 pandemic. As a result, short-term interest rates in the US were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.macrotrends.net/2015/fed-funds-rate-historical-chart&quot;>;near zero&lt;/a>; from 2008 until 2016, then again for much of 2020 and 2021. Over the last 15 years, they&#39;ve only been above 2% for a brief period in 2018 and 2019.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But now it&#39;s 2023, and ZIRP is over. The benchmark Fed Funds rate is currently &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/fed-funds-rate-history/&quot;>;above 5.25%&lt;/a>;. Five-, 10-, and 30-year US Treasuries all now &lt;a href=&quot;https://home.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/interest-rates/TextView?type=daily_treasury_yield_curve&amp;amp;field_tdr_date_value=2023&quot;>;yield nearly 5%&lt;/a>;, their highest levels in a very long time.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The near-zero level of interest rates, the number of years they stayed at this level, and the pace at which they have since gone up — all of this is essentially unprecedented. But “unprecedented” has been an overused word lately, so there may be a tendency for managers to glaze over and not realize what a massive deviation this is from business as usual.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;That would be a mistake. This interest rate shift is a seismic event, affecting any business decision involving multi-year cash flows. “Interest rates are to asset prices … like gravity is to the apple,” in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://buffett.cnbc.com/video/2013/05/04/morning-session---2013-berkshire-hathaway-annual-meeting.html?&amp;amp;start=4028&amp;amp;end=4343&quot;>;words&lt;/a>; of Warren Buffett. “They power everything in the economic universe.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For managers unaccustomed to naturally considering the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/timevalueofmoney.asp&quot;>;time value of money&lt;/a>; or the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/costofcapital.asp&quot;>;cost of capital&lt;/a>; when deciding what projects or investments to pursue, a lack of awareness of how important these concepts are can lead to dangerously wrong conclusions.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One simple way to demonstrate this is to use a thought experiment I first encountered while working at a strategy consulting firm. It&#39;s the type of question consultancies sometimes use in job interviews, to try to understand how candidates think.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Assume a scenario in which:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;You will commute by train to and from work every weekday for the next five years.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;You need a token for each such round trip you take on the train.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Tokens currently cost $1 for each round trip (to and from work).&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Tomorrow, the price is going up to $1.20 — where it will stay for the next five years.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Before the price rises, you can buy as many tokens as you want at today&#39;s $1 price.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Only you can use the tokens you buy, no reselling.&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;The question is this: How many tokens do you buy at today&#39;s $1 price before the price permanently goes up to $1.20?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many people start with an approach that seems intuitive enough: I should buy as many tokens as I can afford, up to the full five years&#39; worth. Indeed, this seems like a no-brainer, a deal with a guaranteed, risk-free return. If you know you&#39;ll need 1,250 tokens (assuming 250 commutes per year for five years), and you know tokens will cost 20% more if you don&#39;t buy them now, why not buy 1,250 today — and enjoy $250 in savings?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some people try to get more exact: What about accounting for vacations and sick-days? Should I adjust for the post-Covid “work from home on Friday” policy? Is 250 commutes per year the right number, or might it be lower? And so on.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Those going down this path may get their math right. But they&#39;re not doing the &lt;em>;right&lt;/em>; math. In fact, the correct first question to ask is: What else can I do with my money?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the consulting-style interview, those who ask that question are told that: a) They can put it into a bank savings account that pays interest at an annualized rate of 10%; b) that this is their only investment option; and finally c) that there are no taxes, transaction costs, bank failures, inflation, etc. to worry about.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Now what? Let&#39;s see what happens to $1 in the bank. After a year it grows to $1.10. After two years, it grows to $1.21 — slightly higher than the new token price.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This way of thinking, one which appreciates the fact that money has time value, leads to a different answer: You should buy two years&#39; worth of tokens. Money spent today buying any more than that would be better off compounding in the bank. You can then withdraw it as and when needed to buy tokens in the future. Over time, this will leave you better off than buying all the tokens up front — all because of the time value of money.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This very simple idea — the time value of money — underlies common finance concepts such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/npv.asp&quot;>;net present value&lt;/a>; (NPV) or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dcf.asp&quot;>;discounted cash flow&lt;/a>; (DCF). Yet even people adept at building complex spreadsheets to precisely compute NPV and DCF figures (eg, for project financing or asset valuation models) often get stumped by the subway token question. They know how to plug discount rates into formulas, but they don&#39;t instinctively know to apply it in everyday situations. And this is particularly true for those who have come into the professional world after 2008, during the ZIRP era.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I don&#39;t blame them. It&#39;s hard to form a practical intuition about the time value of money when things like bank accounts paying meaningful interest haven&#39;t been part of one&#39;s lived experience. Indeed, if and when interest rates are zero, there is no time value of money. In such a world, arguably, buying all the tokens you can makes sense — and by analogy, so does funding all the projects, acquiring all the startups, hiring all the candidates, purchasing all the real-estate, and so on.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But interest rates are no longer zero. And, to once again borrow the &lt;a href=&quot;https://buffett.cnbc.com/video/1994/04/25/when-interest-rates-matter--and-when-they-dont.html&quot;>;words&lt;/a>; of Warren Buffett: “The value of every business … the value of any economic asset is 100% sensitive to interest rates.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;With this in mind, any strategic or financial decision involving multi-year cash flows must be re-examined under new, realistic assumptions for the cost of capital. Since the cost of capital has now gone up considerably compared to what it has been for a long while, updated math will likely show that immediate moves to improve profitability, cash flow, and capital efficiency will &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/03/capital-is-expensive-again-now-what&quot;>;add more value&lt;/a>; than investments targeted towards producing growth years down the line.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fixing the math above is a necessary start. It may be just as important to also fix institutionalized managerial mindsets developed over the past 15 years. In particular, thanks to the impetus provided by near zero interest rates, &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/01/allocating-capital-when-interest-rates-are-high&quot;>;“moonshot” thinking has been all the rage&lt;/a>; over this period. But a return to more old school, &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/01/allocating-capital-when-interest-rates-are-high&quot;>;value-oriented thinking&lt;/a>; is likely needed to succeed in tackling the challenges that lie ahead.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The ZIRP years are over. And as the gravity of interest rates returns, those who have become accustomed to effortless flying must now quickly adapt to life on the ground.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 05 Oct 2023 22:25:01 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[A Remedy for the Supplier Onboarding Problem]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/10/a-remedy-for-the-supplier-onboarding-problem]]><description>&lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/10/Oct23_05_1192882537.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;Maskot/Getty Images&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;Onboarding new suppliers has long been a time-consuming and expensive process.

It&#39;s called &lt;a href=&quot;https://chainyard.com/solutions/trust-your-supplier/&quot;>;Trust Your Supplier&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;A Promising Remedy&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;The concept of supply chain platforms is not new. One example is Chinese appliance manufacturer &lt;a href=&quot;/2022/07/how-to-turn-a-supply-chain-platform-into-an-innovation-engine&quot;>;Haier&#39;s COSMOPlat&lt;/a>; (which stands for Cloud of Smart Manufacturing Operation Platform). It has been used to increase collaboration and streamline operations ranging from innovation and design to supplying materials and components to solving technical problems and providing new services. While Haier could have just developed the solution to meet the needs of working with its own suppliers, it chose to take a platform approach and open the solution.&lt;/p>; &lt;article-promo>; &lt;hbr-component type=&quot;promo&quot; is-insight=&quot;insight-center&quot; title=&quot;The New Age of Operations&quot; dek=&quot;Improving efficiency and increasing resilience.&quot; cta-text=&quot;&quot; href=&quot;/insight-center/the-new-age-of-operations&quot;>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/insight-center/the-new-age-of-operations&quot; style=&quot;color:black;text-decoration:none&quot;>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; Insight Center Collection &lt;/div>; &lt;h3>;The New Age of Operations&lt;/h3>; &lt;div>; Improving efficiency and increasing resilience. &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hbr-component>; &lt;/article-promo>; &lt;p>;Other examples are systems developed by Walmart to &lt;a href=&quot;/2022/11/how-walmart-automated-supplier-negotiations&quot;>;automate negotiations with smaller suppliers&lt;/a>; and to &lt;a href=&quot;/2022/01/how-walmart-canada-uses-blockchain-to-solve-supply-chain-challenges&quot;>;manage invoices from and payments to third-party freight carriers&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As part of our research at the University of Tennessee on highly collaborative business partnerships, we had the opportunity to study a creative strategic alliance between IBM and &lt;a href=&quot;https://chainyard.com/&quot;>;Chainyard&lt;/a>;, a digital transformation company that focuses on blockchain solutions. The strategic partnership caught our eye because the parties were teaming up to develop an industry- and company-agnostic platform solution to address supplier onboarding, compliance, and risk-management issues plaguing virtually all companies.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The result of the partnership: A &lt;a href=&quot;https://image-ppubs.uspto.gov/dirsearch-public/print/downloadPdf/11488271&quot;>;patent&lt;/a>; jointly held by both Chainyard and IBM and the formal launch of Trust Your Supplier (TYS), a blockchain network solution.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;An essential part of the vision was to create a true blockchain network that would allow a worldwide network of buyers and suppliers — not just IBM and its suppliers — to share trusted, standardized data. Today the TYS blockchain network includes 11 large purchasers (eg, American Express, BT, Lenovo, Nokia, Pearson, and Thermo Fisher) and over 100,000 fully vetted suppliers. In addition, more than 400 million other suppliers have some or a significant part of their data available on TYS through partnerships with third-party compliance organizations on the platform such as Moody&#39;s.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The TYS platform enables buyers and their suppliers to opt into the network. Suppliers create a single digital identity (ie, a “corporate wallet” or “digital passport”) to share with their customers that they can use over and over again without having to enter the data every time for a new customer or when an existing client is doing compliance checks.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The TYS platform is showing significant promise for both purchasers and suppliers:&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Purchasers&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;By eliminating redundant efforts and streamlining the process, some of the early-adopter purchasing organizations that have used TYS have reported cost savings of nearly $500 per supplier. For an enterprise with tens of thousands of suppliers, this can result in savings of eight figures in the overall management of their supplier base.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Suppliers&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;TYS has reduced the average supplier onboarding time to under a business week, an impressive average reduction of 67%. Once on the network, suppliers can be onboarded with additional companies almost instantly. Quicker supplier onboarding means not having to wait to start work after a deal is sold. And because suppliers manage and control their data only on the network, it eliminates the administrative burden of having to manage the same or similar data across multiple customers.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;A New Era&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;We believe a paradigm shift is occurring. Organizations will increasingly adopt platform solutions like COSMOPlat and TYS that will solve systemic supply chain issues for a vast number of players. Supply chain management will be transformed.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 05 Oct 2023 21:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Are We Seeing a Revival of Union Power?]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/10/are-we-seeing-a-revival-of-union-power]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/10/Oct23_05_1713785580.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;Mario Tama/Getty Images&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;After decades of decline, American unions are once again challenging employers and using strikes to fight for better contracts. For the first time in recent memory, unions are taking strong, militant stances &amp;#8212; and seem to be making major gains as a result. But how should this moment be understood, and what does it signal about the future of organized labor in the United States? In an interview with HBR, former National Labor Relations Board member Sharon Block explains the significance of new leadership, the legal landscape, and what lessons companies should take from what&amp;#8217;s happening right now.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/10/are-we-seeing-a-revival-of-union-power?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/10/are-we-seeing-a-revival-of-union-power?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;Over the past few months, the United States has seemingly entered a new era for American unions. After decades of decline, major American unions — including the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/22/business/economy/ups-contract-vote-teamsters.html&quot;>;Teamsters&lt;/a>;, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/article/uaw-strike-explained-ford-stellantis-gm.html&quot;>;United Automobile Workers&lt;/a>;, and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/story/2023-05-01/writers-strike-what-to-know-wga-guild-hollywood-productions&quot;>;Writers Guild of America&lt;/a>;, and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/article/actors-strike-why.html&quot;>;Screen Actors Guild&lt;/a>; — have taken militant stances in contract negotiations. Thus far, two have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thenation.com/article/society/teamsters-uaw-strike-votes/&quot;>;chalked up&lt;/a>; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/business/media/hollywoods-writers-emerge-from-strike-as-winnersfor-now-b6b002d3&quot;>;considerable victories&lt;/a>;. This week, workers at Kaiser Permanente walked off the job in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/health/healthcare/healthcare-worker-strike-kaiser-permanente-b404e9d5?st=tllvmqmhktor0jj&amp;amp;reflink=article_copyURL_share&quot;>;largest strike of health care workers in US history&lt;/a>;. All at once, it seems union power is on the rise again.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Where did this come from, and what does it mean? To answer this, HBR spoke with Sharon Block, a former member of the National Labor Relations Board, who is currently a Professor of Practice and Executive Director of the Center for Labor and a Just Economy at Harvard Law School. The following interview was conducted via Google docs.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;HBR: Right now, we&#39;re seeing a level of union action that feels unprecedented in recent memory: the Teamsters leveraged a very credible strike threat to win a new contract for UPS workers, Hollywood writers and actors have spent months on strike, and the United Auto Workers are striking against the Big Three automakers. Quickly, how did we get to this point?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Block: I think that there are a couple of trends driving this increased strike activity. First, the public&#39;s sympathies seem to be with workers. Unions are enjoying higher support among the public than they have in decades. That gives confidence to workers considering going out on strike. Also, I believe that unions are considering the leverage that the tight labor market gives them. They are highly motivated to negotiate advantageous contracts now, so they can lock in their enhanced power. Finally, many of the unions that have been engaged in these high profile labor actions are in sectors where big, transformational change is either just on the horizon or already here. For example, the Hollywood strikes have focused on what the impact of AI is going to be in their work and the UAW strike is in part about how the auto industry is going to transition to an EV future. Workers want to have a voice in how these transformations impact them – active unions give them a meaningful seat at the table as decisions are made that will define the future. That suggests to me that these strikes may go on for a while — workers may be celebrating “union victory autumn” for a while.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;When was the last time we saw organized labor flex this kind of muscle?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It has been generations since we have seen this kind of robust labor activity. I haven&#39;t seen this level of action in my career.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Why has it been so long?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The labor movement has been forced to play defense for a long time by trends in our economy, like the move from a manufacturing economy to a service economy, the increasing brazenness of employer opposition to unions and the weakness in our labor laws that often fail to protect workers engaged in collective action. The pandemic — and the huge profits that many corporations made during the pandemic — seems to have awoken a new commitment among workers — both in unions and not — to stand up to employers and demand what they believe they deserve. For workers in unions, that spirit seems to be driving increasing strike activity.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;One of the really striking things about this moment is the return of big strikes. The Teamsters didn&#39;t strike, but they seemingly came very close and claimed to win a good contract. Writers and actors, of course, did strike and the writers are claiming to have secured a lot of their demands. And the UAW is using a limited strike tactic — standup strikes — that&#39;s disruptive but also gives them the option to escalate. What&#39;s behind the return of the strike, and what are the implications of seeing these big strikes happening? Or, am I overstating this shift?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I don&#39;t think you are overstating this shift. The data shows that there has been more strike activity this year than we&#39;ve seen in a while. Again, I think some of this activity is being driven by a collective response to the pandemic in which workers are saying, “enough.” Many workers, including UPS drivers and factory workers like auto workers, put their lives on the line to continue to work during the pandemic. As a result, they generated big profits for their employers. They are now demanding their fair share of that success. In addition, I believe that success is contagious. Workers are inspiring each other.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;There&#39;s new leadership at both the Teamsters and the UAW, and both of them have promised more hard-knuckle tactics than their predecessors. What&#39;s the significance of this return to a more militant approach, and do you think we can expect to see more of this in the near future?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;My perspective is that the new leadership at the Teamsters and the UAW are very attuned to their members — I think in this moment their members want leaders who reflect their desire to stand up for their interests and demand what they believe they deserve. We can see this dynamic even among workers who aren&#39;t in unions — they have come out of the pandemic and into a tight labor market, amidst skyrocketing CEO pay and stock buybacks, demanding higher wages. The new leadership at the Teamsters and UAW are doing what good union leaders do — translating their members&#39; mood and interests into effective strategy to succeed at the bargaining table. Because success is contagious, I do believe that we will continue to see members and their leaders demanding their fair share loudly and proudly.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Earlier this year, the Biden administration passed legislation that stopped railroad workers from striking and forced a contract on them. This time, however, the president has promised to show up and walk the picket line with striking UAW workers. How do you understand the politics around organized labor right now? Is there any reason to think that the legal and political environment organized labor is working within might change?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;President Biden&#39;s decision to show up at the UAW Willow Ridge picket line was both unprecedented and unsurprising. President Biden has been saying repeatedly that he wants to be the most pro-union president in history. By visiting striking auto workers, he put his feet where his mouth has always been. In addition, it is important to remember that Biden was in the White House when the Obama-Biden Administration was part of asking the UAW to make incredible sacrifices to save the auto industry. So, it makes sense that now that he is in the White House again, he wants to stand with UAW workers as they ask to share in the companies&#39; success.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, Biden&#39;s visit gives him an opportunity to further define his vision for a clean energy future. This visit shows that in his vision, workers have to have a say in how this transformation to an EV future comes about.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I wish I could be more optimistic about the prospect for a change in the legal environment for labor. Before we will see significant labor law reform pass the US Congress, we will need a shift in our political environment. If President Biden and others who are supporting these strikes are rewarded by voters for their commitment to the labor movement, maybe we will see the political change we need to improve the prospect of the kind of labor law reform we need — like the kind of reforms that my colleague Ben Sachs and I proposed in our &lt;a href=&quot;https://clje.law.harvard.edu/clean-slate/&quot;>;Clean Slate for Worker Power project&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Despite hitting record lows in membership, there&#39;s been a big uptick in support for unions in recent years. But when I think of union actions, I mostly think about union drives at places like Amazon and Starbucks. How should we understand the significance of the recent actions by the Teamsters, UAW, etc.? And do they mean anything for other union / unionization efforts?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I believe that success breeds more success. Lots of workers are worrying about the future — is AI going to eliminate their jobs or is their boss using technology to spy on them at work, is climate change going to put them in danger on the job and are their companies going to prioritize stock buybacks over wage increases, leaving them unable to keep up with inflation. With the successful outcomes in so many of these strikes, workers are going to understand in a way maybe they haven&#39;t in a long time that unions are relevant to their lives — that they are a way to have a say in the future. I think all workers want the future to happen with them, not to them.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;So, as all of this unfolds, what are you watching for? What do you think the significant longer term effects of this moment might be?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, I&#39;m watching to see how the UAW strike resolves. If the companies and the union can find a way to successfully chart a path to an EV future that protects workers&#39; middle class wages, I hope that will quiet a lot of critics of this strike. I&#39;m also watching a number of campaigns at the state and local level to support innovative legislation that empowers workers. For example, here in Massachusetts SEIU is supporting legislation to create a collective bargaining system for rideshare drivers. In New York, organizations are supporting wage boards for nail salon workers. And California has created a new council, which includes representatives of workers, to set higher labor standards for fast food workers.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Are there lessons for companies that are watching this unfold? What should leaders be thinking about right now?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I hope that corporate leaders are rethinking the reflex to try to minimize labor costs at the expense of their relationship with their workforce. This summer&#39;s strikes are demonstrating that workers are willing and able to say “enough.” Companies can avoid a lot of public ill will and strife if they think about whether their workers are getting a fair share of the companies&#39; success before increasing CEO pay or embarking on yet another round of stock buybacks.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 05 Oct 2023 20:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[How Fintech Is Making Smaller Suppliers More Resilient]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/10/how-fintech-is-making-smaller-suppliers-more-resilient]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/10/Oct23_04_1193669057.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;tdub303/Getty Images&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;Historically, smaller, lower-tier suppliers have had trouble obtaining financing. New fintech platforms are changing that. They are making it easier for them to use assets such as approved invoices, inventories, and purchase orders to access financing from outside investors or focal companies.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/10/how-fintech-is-making-smaller-suppliers-more-resilient?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/10/how-fintech-is-making-smaller-suppliers-more-resilient?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) deeper in the supply chain often find themselves with many financial challenges. They are several layers away from giant &lt;a href=&quot;https://app.myeducator.com/reader/web/1713d/chapter01/mg6i2/#:~:text=Consider%20the%20following%20as%20you,away%20from%20the%20focal%20firm.&quot;>;focal companies&lt;/a>; like Unilever, Siemens, and Dell that can provide supply chain financing. Until now, all support programs that focal companies have provided, such as reverse factoring and dynamic discounting, were only available to their first-tier suppliers.&lt;strong>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Enter the next-generation financial technology companies such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://provenance.io/&quot;>;Provenance&lt;/a>;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sumup.com/en-us/&quot;>;SumUp&lt;/a>;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zeconomy.com/solutions&quot;>;Zeconomy&lt;/a>;. (One of us, Sam, is the founder and CEO of Zeconomy.) These “fintechs” have created game-changing platforms that help SMEs navigate these challenges and tap into previously inaccessible resources. By leveraging these platforms, SMEs can better manage their cash flows and enhance their business operations. Here&#39;s how.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;1. SME assets can now be digitized.&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;SMEs have three core assets that can be used to obtain financing: approved invoices, inventories, and purchase orders. Of these, organizations providing financing prefer approved invoices from larger companies; they are considered low risk because they mean the work has been completed and the shipment has been sent to the buying company. However, when these invoices come from fellow SMEs, financial institutions might consider them much riskier and cast a wary eye. The same is true of purchase orders from other SMEs and SMEs&#39; inventory.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Through the fintech platforms, these SME assets can now be digitized. Once they are, they can be traded in a digital marketplace to match specific asset types to the risk and return profiles of various investors. Similar to the way people playing fantasy football choose players from various teams, investors can assemble portfolios of SME assets. Previously unbankable SME assets can be bundled into diversified investment portfolios.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;2. Connectivity and efficiency are enhanced.&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;The underlying technology behind the fintech software platform is blockchain. It affords a way for SME assets to get digitally connected with large focal companies. This provides a number of benefits:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;Makes it possible for the focal companies to provide financing to these SMEs&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Reduces outside investors&#39; risks in lending to SMEs based on their assets&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Makes it easier for focal companies and first-tier suppliers to provide early payments to SMEs in return for discounts on their purchases from SMEs&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Allows SMEs to obtain better financing terms&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;What is more, the blockchain technology underpinning these transactions provides an added layer of security and transparency for the financial transaction while keeping the confidential and competitive data of suppliers private.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;3. AI provides cash-flow predictions.&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;The way fintech platforms can help SMEs manage their cash flows is nothing short of revolutionary. These platforms can automatically compile transactional data and use artificial intelligence (AI) to analyze SMEs&#39; transaction histories and make accurate forecasts of SMEs&#39; future cash flows. This data-driven approach empowers SMEs to optimize their working capital and make more informed decisions, mitigating their risk of insolvency.&lt;/p>; &lt;article-promo>; &lt;hbr-component type=&quot;promo&quot; is-insight=&quot;insight-center&quot; title=&quot;The New Age of Operations&quot; dek=&quot;Improving efficiency and increasing resilience.&quot; cta-text=&quot;&quot; href=&quot;/insight-center/the-new-age-of-operations&quot;>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/insight-center/the-new-age-of-operations&quot; style=&quot;color:black;text-decoration:none&quot;>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; Insight Center Collection &lt;/div>; &lt;h3>;The New Age of Operations&lt;/h3>; &lt;div>; Improving efficiency and increasing resilience. &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hbr-component>; &lt;/article-promo>; &lt;p>;Moreover, these cash flow predictions can give investors more confidence when deciding whether to provide SMEs with financing. For instance, suppose an SME supplier applied for a short-term loan. The fintech platform analyzes the loan application, sets appropriate loan limits, and suggests optimal repayment schedules — all backed by AI-generated cash flow predictions. The end result: The platforms allow SMEs to obtain better offers from more investors than has traditionally been the case.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fintech platforms offer new pathways for SME suppliers to access funds. By digitizing assets and leveraging technology, the platforms can increase SME suppliers&#39; liquidity and lower their cost of financing. And by helping strengthen SMEs, these platforms can help make the entire supply chain more resilient.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 04 Oct 2023 23:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[What&rsquo;s Fueling Burnout in Your Organization?]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/10/whats-fueling-burnout-in-your-organization]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/10/Oct23_04_565879609.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;Jacobs Stock Photography Ltd/Getty Images&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;Many people believe burnout is driven by excessive work demands. In fact, it&amp;#8217;s driven by a specific type of demand&amp;#8211;work that requires too much collaboration between individuals or teams of employees. To reduce this collaboration overload, ask these four questions: Can we reduce structural complexity? Does our workflow make sense? Hasthe profusion of teams spiked employees&amp;#8217; microstress? And have we built a sense of purpose in our employees&amp;#8217; everyday interactions?&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/10/whats-fueling-burnout-in-your-organization?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/10/whats-fueling-burnout-in-your-organization?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;Organizations around the world are experiencing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gallup.com/workplace/349484/state-of-the-global-workplace.aspx#ite-506900&quot;>;unprecedented levels of burnout&lt;/a>;, which is creating a significant — and under-recognized — cost to organizations in the form of quiet quitting, reduced innovation, and even spiraling healthcare costs. Many people are quick to point to an increase in overall workload as the culprit. But our research shows that the work itself has not increased so much as the &lt;a href=&quot;/2021/09/collaboration-overload-is-sinking-productivity&quot;>;&lt;em>;collaborative demands&lt;/em>;&lt;/a>; of the work.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;By that, we mean the volume and frequency of the collaborations that people have to engage in to complete the work — what we call the collaborative footprint — have risen over the past decade and a half, bringing exponential opportunities for stress. This comes through the increased potential for misunderstanding, misalignment, and imbalances of workload and capacity, among other things. All of this combines to create a battering of everyday stresses.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One form of this stress is the one we call “microstress” — small moments of stress from interactions with colleagues that feel routine but whose cumulative toll is enormous. &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/02/the-hidden-toll-of-microstress&quot;>;Our research&lt;/a>; into high performers has made clear the destructive impact of unchecked microstress, both on individuals and on teams. At the team level, this form of stress propagates through networks and relationships.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It may seem challenging to find ways to reduce stress on teams that are overloaded with deliverables, but leaders have more tools at their disposal than they may realize. Instead of relying only on coaching on individual coping strategies, leaders can look for systemic improvement in the collective working environment. We have identified four overlooked collective strategies that leaders can implement for reducing microstress. Here are the four key questions you need to ask.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Can we reduce structural complexity? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;For decades organizations have been building organizational complexity — not only in expanding spans and layers in traditional hierarchical structures (expanding the number of direct reports to reduce layers between the front line and the C-suite), but also in moving to matrixed, networked, or other more agile ways of working. While new these structures can be effective at increasing flexibility, they have also unintentionally introduced complexity by multiplying the required number of interactions per employee. We routinely see organizations adopting advice to move to structures with consistent spans of control (the number of people one is responsible for managing) of eight people. But such efforts to improve efficiency don&#39;t consider the collaborations required to do the work. The collaborative footprint of work — which has risen 50% or more in the past 15 years, according to Rob Cross&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/01/collaborative-overload&quot;>;research&lt;/a>; — is creating exponential opportunities for small stresses to run rampant in any organization. Unchecked, such complexity, can easily accumulate, triggering a proliferation of microstresses.&lt;/p>; &lt;article-promo>; &lt;hbr-component type=&quot;promo&quot; is-insight=&quot;insight-center&quot; title=&quot;The Future of Work&quot; dek=&quot;Will your company adapt or be left behind?&quot; cta-text=&quot;&quot; href=&quot;/insight-center/the-future-of-work&quot;>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/insight-center/the-future-of-work&quot; style=&quot;color:black;text-decoration:none&quot;>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; Insight Center Collection &lt;/div>; &lt;h3>;The Future of Work&lt;/h3>; &lt;div>; Will your company adapt or be left behind? &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hbr-component>; &lt;/article-promo>; &lt;p>;De-layering might seem to be a solution, but in embracing it many organizations have moved to spans of control that really are not feasible given the collaborative intensity of the work. (We&#39;ve even seen some organizations scaling up to spans of control of 12 or more.) Such flat hierarchy can create stress for employees balancing competing objectives of multiple leaders to whom an employee might report, formally or informally.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Removing layers, while appealing on cost analyses and decision-making flows, also often introduces other less visible inefficiencies around work. Many teams are underperforming today due to priority overload where too many uncoordinated asks are coming into the teams from disconnected &lt;a href=&quot;https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/when-collaboration-fails-and-how-to-fix-it/&quot;>;stakeholders&lt;/a>; and failures of coordination and prioritization at high levels in the organization.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One way to fix that is to have explicit processes to remove excessive complexity. It may not be possible to rewind all of these efforts at de-layering organizations, but there are a few &lt;a href=&quot;/2020/01/taming-complexity&quot;>;simple practices&lt;/a>; you can employ to root out the potential for unnecessary stress from structural complexity. Most companies have many ways of introducing new complexity, but no systematic continuous effort to remove it. Netflix is one of a handful of firms known for prioritizing &lt;a href=&quot;https://jobs.netflix.com/culture&quot;>;identifying and removing unnecessary complexity&lt;/a>;. As their company policy states, “We work hard to … keep our business as simple as possible … you don&#39;t need policies for everything.” If you must introduce new teams or procedures, consider making them temporary. Create them with an explicit sunset clause, such that it is dissolved when no longer useful, avoiding the gradual ratcheting of complexity over time.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Companies can also control complexity by continually simplifying the product portfolio, which is often a key driver of complexity. Trader Joe&#39;s has a such a policy for &lt;a href=&quot;https://d3.harvard.edu/platform-rctom/submission/trader-joes-food-for-thought/&quot;>;controlling the number of SKUs&lt;/a>; to maintain the number at less than 10% of the industry average. Similarly, LEGO controls the number of colors and brick types in its products, to control manufacturing and logistical complexity.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong>;Above all, don&#39;t just think about on paper efficiency, think about the collaborative asks being placed on human beings who execute these tasks day in, day out. When we have asked top teams in offsites who in the room wants another email, meeting, or phone call in their lives, we have yet to see a single hand shoot up. The more complex, the more matrixed, the more required communication and connection between employees, the more ad hoc the more microstresses are going to be impeding the effectiveness of work.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Does our workflow make sense? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Organizations have had an unrelenting push into agile, network-centric structures executing through teams that are formed and disbanded at increasingly rapid pace. These efforts are providing speed, but taken to an extreme, they are starting to sacrifice the benefits of scale and efficiency that came from the process revolution. Forming and reforming project teams requires increasing coordination, often relying on the heroics of individual employees to get work done. But that is not a sustainable strategy — and triggers endless opportunities for burnout. “It&#39;s better to rely on a process than just people,” Don Allan, CEO of Stanley Black &amp;amp; Decker &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/03/has-your-organization-acted-on-what-its-learned-in-the-pandemic&quot;>;observed&lt;/a>; of one of the key HR lessons of the pandemic, “so you do not create unnecessary stress and even burnout for your organization.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The proliferation of technologies in the workplace promises to streamline work and communication, but instead can often became a source of additional complexity, required work and stress. Often, we find organizations using between six and nine means of collaborating to get work done — meetings (virtual and face-to-face), email, instant messaging (such as Slack), team collaborative spaces, phone calls, texting, etc. Inefficiencies invariably creep in as people use these modalities differently — for example, who doesn&#39;t have a colleague who loves to write elaborate emails, hiding what they want in the 10&lt;sup>;th&lt;/sup>; paragraph! Or at the other extreme, some people use one modality (eg, IM) to solve problems quickly, but lack of transparency into the interaction creates misalignment with other teammates who have no idea a decision was made over IM.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One way to limit this stress is to agree on collaborative norms. For example, a team might agree to only use bullets on email. And if a longer explanation is required or a disagreement seems to be brewing, the team agrees to meet face to face. We find a simple exercise of asking teams to agree to three positive norms across all modes of collaboration that they want to sustain and three negatives they want to stop (eg, emailing at night, hitting reply to all on mundane responses, etc.) can generate 8–12% time savings across teams, allowing them more time to focus on the actual work. Technology itself is not necessarily a bad thing, but the culture that springs up around using that technology is where microstress creeps in.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Teams can also limit the set of tools they&#39;re using and bake them into the work in a way which reduces human transaction costs. Focus on maximizing technology that helps eliminate or reduce the costs of mundane tasks, eg setting up workflows on Slack or recurring meetings to ensure appropriate check ins don&#39;t slip through the cracks because they&#39;re relying on a team member to set up and coordinate. Encourage the team to invest time in learning the tools and share their productivity tips and tricks. And avoid new tools or multiple tools that inadvertently becoming new sources of work or complexity eg through cumbersome sign on procedures or lack of mutual compatibility. Too often teams aren&#39;t consulted about which tools will actually help their productivity.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Has the profusion of teams spiked employees&#39; microstress? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;One of the unintended consequences of organizations relying on teams that are assembled for projects is that teams have less time to build the kind of trust that is essential for efficient collaboration. And that happens repeatedly because many organizations require employees to contribute to five or six team efforts (in addition to their primary team) and have often let these &lt;a href=&quot;/2013/11/the-new-rules-of-breakthrough-collaboration&quot;>;groups grow too large&lt;/a>;, with the average team size hovering around 15.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To avoid team growth from causing trouble, don&#39;t let “flexible” turn into inefficient. Some organizations trying to attract and retain top talent during the great resignation (and quiet quitting) have implemented &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/05/how-to-design-an-internal-talent-marketplace&quot;>;talent marketplaces&lt;/a>; which allow employees to locate projects they would like to work on or roles they want to fill as they chart their own career progression. Though well-intended as a talent retention tool, these shifts create inefficiencies in the network that most organizations do not account for. These programs are well-received by the employees but induce microstresses on both the team the employee is leaving and the one they are ported into, as they suddenly have to redirect and shape key working relationships with new people. One life sciences organization we worked with modeled the relational cost (the “switching costs” on work relationships and productivity of continually rotating teams) and determined that it didn&#39;t make sense for anyone to switch roles or teams in less than fifteen months because both the team and the rotating employee would fail to optimize the opportunity.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Companies must also ensure that their return-to-office plan doesn&#39;t create hidden stress. About 80% of companies are opting to require employees to be in the office three days a week, according to research from i4cp (the Institute for Corporate Productivity). To soften the blow and ensure flexibility, about half of those companies are allowing employees to pick the days they want to return.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Unfortunately, this well-intentioned effort has also created a new set of microstresses when the people who an organization needs to work together pick different days. Leaving this up to chance will not only hurt employee morale, but innovation and productivity. To prevent this, some organizations are using a technique called &lt;a href=&quot;https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/optimizing-return-to-office-strategies-with-organizational-network-analysis/&quot;>;organizational network analysis&lt;/a>; (a methodology that maps employees&#39; working relationships) to specify specific groups of employees that need to be in the office at a given interval. Such an analysis can help leaders answer three critical questions in a return-to-office strategy:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;&lt;em>;Who&lt;/em>; should be brought back together and in what cadence of in-person and virtual interactions?&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;em>;What&lt;/em>; work should be prioritized in the now scarcer in-person time?&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;em>;How&lt;/em>; do leaders manage the transition to a hybrid model with the least resistance?&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;This method also helps motivate employees to resume some in-person interactions by showing them how hybrid work can improve their own effectiveness.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Have we built a sense of purpose in our employees&#39; everyday interactions? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Organizations have become adept at working efficiently with the help of technologies — what can&#39;t be swiftly taken care of on a Zoom call these days? But when work revolves around technology use, it can become transactional, missing the opportunity to make sure that employees understand how their work contributes to that purpose.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To avoid that problem, smart companies create opportunities to discuss purpose and how each group contributes to it. It is your role as a leader to shape and communicate the goal that you&#39;re all working towards. Don&#39;t let that get lost in the sea of microstress. With a clear understanding of how they are contributing to purpose, employees can more easily prioritize their work. Discuss what work is essential (and what is not) in contributing to purpose and use this to help your team prioritize and redesign work accordingly.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;While many organizations focus on rallying employees around a collective corporate purpose, our research also suggests that purpose can be found in positive &lt;a href=&quot;https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/a-noble-purpose-alone-wont-transform-your-company/&quot;>;everyday interactions with colleagues&lt;/a>;, too. For example, employees can find meaningful purpose in “co-creating” (involving the aha moments that emerge as people build on each other&#39;s ideas) which helps builds a sense of &lt;em>;We are in this together. &lt;/em>;Small moments of working on something together create an authentic connection, a kind of antidote to the flood of microstresses that otherwise fill employees&#39; days.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Finally, as leaders, don&#39;t underestimate the impact of your own microstress, both on you and your team. Look for interactions in which you are unintentionally creating microstress for your team — for example being slightly unpredictable in your expectations, failing to communicate deliverables clearly, or continually micromanaging their work. The microstress we create for others inevitably boomerangs back on us. If you recognize where you are the source of unnecessary microstress and try to course-correct, you will not only help reduce stress on your team, but you&#39;ll be also reducing stress on yourself, as well.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 04 Oct 2023 22:25:02 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
