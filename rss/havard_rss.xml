量化显示，优秀人才的生产力高达八倍，这表明人才质量与业务绩效之间的关系非常显着。在困难时期寻求增长或仅仅生存的组织必须成功招募一流人才、思想领袖和主题专家。这通常是在时间有限的情况下完成的，因为您必须快速填补关键职位。本质上，您是在几次非常短暂的约会后承诺建立长期关系。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;现在让我们考虑一下招聘人才的典型流程。我们用来评估人才的主要工具是一系列工作面试。典型的面试过程是问答形式，向候选人询问一些常见问题：&lt;em>;请告诉我们您的背景。你为什么想为我们工作？分享您在工作中遇到的挑战以及您是如何应对的。你最自豪的是什么？你产生了什么影响？为什么你是这项工作的最佳人选？你最大的成就是什么？你的弱点是什么？&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;尽管人们对面试本身的价值表示赞成和反对，但典型的问答工作面试流程未能评估最重要的因素之一，如果不是最重要的技能，您应该从您雇用的人身上寻找最重要的技能——批判性思维。批判性思维是从各种来源寻找信息，评估其可信度，并确定其相关性和准确性。批判性思维通常被归类为高阶技能，它不是单一技能，而是一系列技能的集合，涉及推理、构建合理的论点以及识别情况的缺陷、偏见、逻辑或不一致之处。批判性思维与创造性思维不同。创造性思维是产生新的、创新想法的能力。批判性思维要求考生仔细、逻辑性地分析事实并形成判断。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;批判性思维从根本上来说是一个提问的过程&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;一个关键见解&lt;a href=&quot;https:// www.amazon.com/Decisions-Over-Decimals-Intuition-Information/dp/111989848X&quot;>;根据我们的研究&lt;/a>;，基于对数千名高管的调查和教学，房间里最聪明的人并不是那个人与答案，但提出问题的人。他们好奇、投入、无所畏惧，&amp;nbsp;好奇心强，准备探索一个可能还没有答案的新领域。根据问题的性质，他们展示了观察、分析、推理、询问、解释和解释。批判性思考者很好奇。与生俱来的好奇心已被证明与以下八个特征相关：热心的学习者、问题解决者、积极的倾听者、自我驱动、高生产力、成长心态、卓越的成就以及强大的利益相关者管理能力。这八个特质读起来就像是你想加入团队的人员的资格愿望清单。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;咨询公司和技术公司通过使用基于场景或行为的问题来推动标准的面试问题。 em>;：在亚特兰大修剪草坪需要多少钱？为什么公用孔是圆形的？你会如何为盲人设计一个酒架？如果您获得 500 万美元来解决一个全球性问题，您会解决什么问题以及如何解决？&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这些是评估候选人提出问题的能力的一个很好的进步，但在回答时这些问题将分析应聘者解决问题的能力、处理歧义的能力和创造性思维，但不会表明他们是否好奇、积极主动或对您的公司、产品、文化或八个特质中的任何一个充满热情前面提到过。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但是，您如何识别具有这种多才多艺且引人注目的批判性思维和好奇心组合的个人呢？大胆地&lt;em>;翻转面试过程。&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;培养批判性思维的最古老且仍然最有效的策略是苏格拉底方法，由苏格拉底在 2,400 多年前开发，苏格拉底是一位伟大的哲学家。西方哲学的奠基人。苏格拉底式方法使用发人深省的问答探究来促进学习。它的重点是产生更多的问题而不是答案，其中答案不是停止点而是进一步分析的开始。招聘经理可以应用此模型在现代组织中与候选人建立不同的对话。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;翻转面试&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;让候选人面试你。翻转面试是揭示候选人内在优势、首选工作方式以及他们的想法的另一种方法。面试将展示候选人的思维和决策过程，并表明候选人是否表现出领导特质。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;翻转面试不仅仅是让候选人问您开放式问题，例如，&lt;em>;什么是公司文化？&lt;/em>;或&lt;em>;在该公司工作感觉如何？&lt;/em>;面试官带着业务场景、对相关信息的理解进行讨论，并邀请受访者进行指导通过一系列问题进行发现。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;受访者可能会使用四种类型的问题，这些问题的复杂性和参与度不断增加。&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;事实问题： &lt;/strong>;基于事实或意识提供简单答案的问题。&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;趋同性问题：&lt;/strong>;具有有限答案的封闭式问题。通常，这些问题只有一个正确答案。&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;发散性问题：&lt;/strong>;鼓励多种答案的开放式问题。这些问题是更详细地分析情况、问题或复杂性并激发创造性思维的一种手段。&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;评估性问题：&lt;/strong>;需要更深层次思考的问题。问题可以是开放式的，也可以是封闭式的。评估性问题引发多层次、不同角度的分析，从而得出新综合的信息或结论。&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;h2>;进行翻转面试：四步流程&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;使用以下框架可以最大限度地提高与新员工对话的价值：&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;1.框架&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;简要描述一个场景。预先说明您是该场景的信息来源，并要求受访者在接下来的 8 到 12 分钟内简单地说“您将如何开始这个发现？”当他们不可避免地陷入困境时，用决策树的一个分支来提示他们，进一步打开发现。邀请他们提问。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;面试官评估&lt;/strong>;：在框架步骤中，您评估他们如何框架问题。他们是只看问题的表面还是探究问题的本质？他们提出的问题的质量应该决定他们需要的信息、所需的努力，并揭示要做出的重要决定。第一步更多的是发现问题而不是解决问题。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;2.链接&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;一旦他们定义了问题，请他们提出有关背景的问题。 “考虑到他们如何构建场景，他们还想知道哪些其他信息来做出推荐？”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;面试官评估：&lt;/strong>;您希望了解他们的问题是否会引导他们将场景置于上下文中。语境为王。为了真正将情况置于背景中，他们的问题应该使他们能够通过以下方式进行三角测量：1）绝对值，2）随着时间的推移，3）相对于整个市场正在发生的事情，客户或竞争对手的行为。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;3.解读&lt;u>;&lt;/u>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;根据原始场景，结合所学知识，询问“需要做出的基本决策是什么？”或“他们对情况的理解发生了怎样的转变？”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;采访者评价：&lt;/strong>;他们能够开始阐述叙述吗？您正在评估他们的叙述是摘要还是综合：摘要 = 数据陈述；综合就是数据+判断。批判性思考者将展示他们如何并行使用和综合不同的信息，以更深入地理解所需的场景或决策。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;4.继续&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;在最后一步中，询问“您接下来会立即采取哪些步骤？”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;面试官评估：&lt;/strong>;如果他们开始提问对于需要说服的关键利益相关者、影子影响者、倡导者或摇摆选民，候选人正在进行批判性思考。他们是否寻求了解逆风和顺风以使他们能够前进？请注意，这并不是要解决问题或评估他们是否提出建议，而只是他们如何解决问题和做出决策。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;使用翻转面试，您可以评估候选人的逻辑和对工作的热情。根据他们的问题扮演角色。这些问题是多余的还是必然的？这些问题是通用的还是具体的？他们是否不仅提出事实性或趋同性的问题，而且还提出分歧性和评价性的问题？候选人是否会从不同角度进行转向、深入研究并重新审视某个主题？这些问题是否基于问题及其环境的背景？当他们向您提问时，您可以通过实时、旋转和探究的方式调整他们的问题来确定他们是否在积极倾听。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;熟练的提问者会创建合作对话，通过以下方式引发新的学习：一系列问题。他们与对方互动。他们的问题应该引发推论和联系，并提出不明显的观点。这种探索心态鼓励尝试和迭代；意想不到的学习可能源自讨论。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;微软改变面试流程&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;虽然没有被贴上“翻转面试”的标签，但一名候选人在 1998 年申请了微软的职位，结果发现自己陷入了一场面试。 。面试时，招聘人员要求他“卖给我一个烤面包机”。候选人停了下来。候选人毫不犹豫地问了几个问题：“家里有多少人？” “家里有小孩子吗？” “家里使用烤面包机的年龄范围是多少？” “他们住在狭小的空间里，比如公寓还是大房子？” “他们早餐吃得很多，还是他们的主餐是晚餐？” “他们多久出去吃饭一次？”在三分钟的时间里，这是一系列有关人口统计、心理统计和物理空间的问题。招聘人员要求应聘者停下来，并询问这与向她推销烤面包机有什么关系。候选人回答说：“一切。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;发现并理解“烤面包机环境”的背景非常重要，以确保我向您推销您需要的东西。如果我将烤面包机的特性和功能与您的需求相匹配，销售的成功率就会提高，您将成为满意的客户。您需要烤面包机、弹出式 2 片烤面包机、4 片、宽片烤面包机、传送带烤面包机、商用烤面包机还是对流烤箱？也许帕尼尼压榨机最能满足您的需求。这项练习与烤面包机无关，招聘人员想了解候选人如何处理歧义。他是一个批判性的思想家吗？他是立即投入推销，还是暂停、转向并学习？如果您想知道，候选人得到了这份工作。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;建立好奇的文化&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;伟大的领导者建立伟大的文化。伟大的文化建立在好奇心之上。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;建立一支具有平衡好奇心的团队是致胜之路。具有不同背景的团队通过将不同的知识集引入到问题的解决中，可以进一步放大好奇心文化的影响，这些知识可以相互促进。从面试过程开始，从一开始就嵌入这种关键能力，将使您能够快速建立一种创造性思想家的文化。在翻转面试中取得成功的人都是持续学习者。他们将抓住这个机会——无论是作为个人还是作为一个充满活力的团队——并抓住这个机会。他们会表现出与生俱来的好奇心，并不断问“为什么？”或“那又怎样？”重要的是，“现在怎么办？”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;提出问题是我们的本能。十八个月。心理学家认为，这个年龄是孩子开始寻求信息的年龄。大约 36 个月大时，这种刚刚萌芽的好奇心转化为口头问题。这些问题看似无数且随机，似乎不加区别地从一个主题跳到下一个主题。为什么会下雨？月亮是由什么构成的？鸟儿是怎样飞翔的？狗去哪儿了？我们什么时候可以去公园？&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但是，当孩子开始上小学时，这种通过提问来学习的永不满足的好奇心常常会发生转变。慢慢地，教育的重点从提出问题转向寻求答案。当孩子们知道答案时，他们会被要求举手，从而形成了一种新的习惯。这种心态——期望提供答案而不是提出更多问题——只会随着年轻人继续他们的教育旅程而加深。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当我们开始工作时，我们就被灌输了这样的观念：我们需要得到答案。在工作环境中，提问的价值经常被错误地忽视。答案受到拥护；预期解决方案；隐含地不鼓励提出更多问题。是的，结果很重要，但是通过更明智的资源分配或更具创造性的策略，这些结果是否可以更显着并以更低的风险实现？我们常常忽视这样一个事实：表现最好的人是那些提出问题并激发批判性思维的人，这些问题可以暴露策略中的弱点或揭示替代路径。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;回到年轻、好奇的自我的道路是短的。事实上，这取决于问自己一个连接我们的职业和个人生活的问题：我们如何成长？这个问题是每个项目、每个请求、每次会议、甚至我们选择工作和生活的地方的基础。很少有人像这样直接问这个问题，但这个根本问题的答案是什么塑造了我们的职业和生活。我们在质疑中成长。了解这一点可以创建一个框架，帮助确定如何提高个人满意度或公司的市场份额、扩大我们的客户群、帮助提高产品使用率或推动更新。如果你寻求成长，你需要激发批判性思维。为此，你需要强有力的问题。这是翻转面试模型的基础。虽然我们从小就喜欢提问，但很少有人教导我们如何有效地培养提问技巧。在商业中，我们常常忽视提问的重要性。我们没有意识到提问是工作中不可或缺的技能。我们没有投入足够的时间和精力来培训自己和他人成为有效的调查员。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在翻转面试中成功的候选人将表现出批判性思维的心态。这与了解分析工具和方法不同。批判性思维哲学是几乎每个领导者都寻求的技能，但许多团队都缺乏。分析性思考包括明确基本问题的目的，而不是在数据森林中徘徊，不是从统计角度好奇，而是质疑最初的表面价值，能够通过综合将各个点连接起来，并最终能够分辨出来一个基于更深层次的事实、判断和背景的知情故事，而不仅仅是重申最初的事实。&lt;/p>; &lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;。 。 .&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;公司的蓬勃发展需要反应能力、洞察力和独创性。您寻求敏捷的思想家，他们可以成为增长冠军、说真话的人、客户管理者和洞察创造者。能够概念化问题、构建情境并提出更深思熟虑的问题的候选人将胜过那些依赖教科书答案的候选人。雇用能够提出深思熟虑的问题的人才是建立成功团队的关键。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;最后，一旦你成功招募了出色的人才，你必须创造一个环境，让员工有动力集体工作，同时感到自己受到重视和认可。好奇和好奇。具有拥抱问题和好奇心的成长心态的整个组织可以将挑战重新定义为机遇，并更自由地适应业务条件。&lt;/p>;

&lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption= &quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;摘要。&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;Dov Seidman 让人们认真思考，不仅思考他们做了什么，还思考他们如何做。他非常专注于“如何”做到这一点。他创建了 HOW 社会研究所，鼓励领导人走上道德领导之路。他甚至写了一本名为《如何：为什么我们做任何事意味着一切》的书。在我们每周直播系列节目“工作的新世界”的这一集中，塞德曼提供了关于当今良好的道德领导力的见解和灵感——在一个永远混乱的时代。他的中心思想是旧的领导方式不再有效。他向观众发起挑战，请他们选出一位近年来取得成功的指挥与控制型市长、大公司首席执行官或职业教练。他说得有道理。我们对领导者的要求的期望是：也许有一个明显的例子，那就是国家政治人物——现在包括同理心、脆弱性、正直和道德。 &lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/what-it-means-to-be-a-moral-leader ?language=es&quot;>;阅读西班牙语&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/what-it-means-to-be-a-moral-leader?language=pt&quot;>;阅读葡萄牙语&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;还记得领导人何时可以通过说“商业就是商业”来回避在敏感的政治或社会问题上采取立场吗？ HOW 社会研究所创始人兼主席多夫·塞德曼 (Dov Seidman) 表示，这种冷漠的中立态度已经不再有效。 “我认为商业的本质就是社会，”他说。 “这是社区，以及我们如何应对遇到的一切，以及我们的深思熟虑和原则性。”坚持正义的领导者是员工、客户和其他利益相关者的新期望。更不用说感恩节餐桌上的亲戚了。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;随着人工智能的发展并挑战人类对智力的垄断，道德判断和同理心等纯粹的人类技能对于领导者来说变得更加重要。塞德曼说，虽然机器可以被教导做正确的事情，但只有人才能带领他人做正确的事情。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;对于我们视频系列“工作新世界”的这一集，《哈佛商业评论》主编Adi Ignatius 与 Seidman 进行了座谈，Seidman 也是《How: Why How We》一书的作者做任何事情都意味着一切&lt;/a>;&lt;/em>;，讨论：&lt;/p>;

上与一位高层领导交谈 - 之前的采访包括 &lt;a href=&quot; /2021/10/microsofts-satya-nadella-on-flexible-work-the-metaverse-and-the-power-of-empathy&quot;>;微软首席执行官萨蒂亚·纳德拉&lt;/a>;和&lt;a href=&quot;/2021/11 /indra-nooyi-前百事可乐首席执行官谈动荡时期的人才培养&quot;>;前百事可乐首席执行官英德拉·努伊&lt;/a>;。他还在专门为《哈佛商业评论》订阅者提供的时事通讯中分享了对这些对话的内部看法，并为未来的讨论征求问题。如果您是订阅者，可以在&lt;a href=&quot;/my-library/preferences?movetile=newworldofwork&quot;>;此处&lt;/a>;注册。&lt;/p>;

&lt;/div>; &lt;/hbr-component>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;DOV SEIDMAN：&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;优秀领导者要做的第一件事他们会退后一步，试图理解他们所领导的世界。领导力与头条新闻无关。我们都可以阅读这些内容，推文到推文，帖子到帖子。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这是关于趋势线的，世界将走向何方？哪些熟悉和陌生的力量正在重塑它？我们用什么框架来判断未来？我们将使用什么剧本来吸引人们踏上通往未来的旅程？&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我还喜欢说，平静的大海从来不会造就伟大的水手，而外面的大海并不平静。 。因此，如果你想成为一名伟大的领导者，在波涛汹涌的大海上航行就是其中的一部分。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;领导力始终很重要，它始终具有重要意义。我们将通过一些例子来说明领导力可能比以前更重要，因为它会产生回响。但我们正处于一个一切都被扰乱的时代，包括领导力和权威本身。负责一个组织、一个团队或其他人的意义已经与过去不同了。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我想构建我认为最伟大的 21 世纪领导力挑战，然后我们可以讨论什么样的领导层应对它。我想你和你的观众都会同意，如果没有正式的授权，你就无法管理一家公司、一个团队、一个国家。人们需要负责。我无法想象一支没有主教练的足球队，一所没有校长的学校，一家没有首席执行官的公司，或者一个没有总统或总理的国家。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但我们都知道，组织当具有道德权威的个人占据这些正式权威的职位时，人类和社会才能真正发挥作用。在不太透明、更不透明的世界里，我们经常将两者混为一谈：“他一定是一个伟人，否则他是怎么达到那么高的地位的？”或者，“除非他是一位出色的领导者，否则董事会不会把他放在那里。”但现在我们看到，正式权力可以被夺取，你可以在选举中赢得它，其他人可以将其授予你，“我特此任命你为副总统。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但道德权威确实是取决于你是谁、你体现的价值观、你如何领导、你如何做出决定以及你如何与他人相处。在这个颠覆的时代，我们面临的挑战是，正式权威已被破坏。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;硅谷企业家，即使拥有 20 比 1 的超级多数股权，也无法保住自己的工作，如果他们没有以开明的方式领导，甚至更糟糕的是，存在一些不当行为。我们看到社会各个领域的正式权威被推翻和破坏。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;挑战在于我们如何培养和发展以道德权威领导的道德领袖文化？这是第一步。我们如何确保他们是发号施令、担任正式权力职位的人？&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我想补充一点，就领导力而言，这场流行病的遗产是，它已经揭示并阐明了道德领导的重要性。不仅仅是最高层，学校校长、星巴克的咖啡师、组织、部门和社会各个层面的商店经理：领导力都很重要。因为特别是在危机时期，当人们自然地感到不确定和害怕时，他们会求助于任何对他们有一定权威的人。他们对他们的期望是真理，一些智慧，一些无私，真正把对方放在第一位。他们期待道德领导力，阿迪。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS：&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这是一个很好的框架。你使用了“道德”这个词。在我们的世界里，为《哈佛商业评论》撰稿的人通常倾向于使用“良好的领导力”之类的术语。优秀的领导者除了拥有你需要的商业头脑之外，还具有同理心，他们很脆弱，但你使用“道德”这个词。你这是什么意思？为什么这是你的中心框架？&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;DOV SEIDMAN：&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我所说的并不是说教、成为道德，或者成为如何应对道德困境的专家，或者如何在社会、政治、环境、宗教问题上采取立场的专家，即使它可能包括这些。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;道德领导实际上是关于如何。你如何领导、如何决策，是成本效益分析吗？还是有原则指导？你是否愿意做不方便、勇敢和困难的事情，因为这是原则或价值观对你的要求？&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这实际上是关于你如何与他人相处和对话。是单向还是双向？这就是您结束会议的方式。你会说：“我们聊得很愉快吗？是谁的电话？哦，这是一个营销决定。谁有营销预算？”这是用权力来界定它，“这是谁的电话？”不如问：“什么是正确的选择？我们认为什么是公平的呼吁？什么是尊重并忠于我们价值观的召唤？”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我想了解一整套剧本，但现在我只想说，这不是道德说教。这实际上是关于如何做的。你如何运用权力，你如何做出决定，你如何行事，以及你在自己的价值观方面所体现的真正含义。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;也许我们可以将这些纳入《哈佛商业评论》观众都在苦苦挣扎的问题中。阿迪，你在《哈佛商业评论》上写了很多关于我们在工作场所取得成功需要更多的行为和品质的文章。如果我能让你处于困境的话，你为什么不说出一些名字呢？为了赢得今天的胜利，我们希望我们的同事和队友有哪些行为？&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS：&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;好吧，相信。&lt; /p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;多夫·赛德曼：&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;信任。好吧，我要把这些写下来。信任。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS：&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我之前谈到过诸如同理心、脆弱性、承诺之类的事情。我们不是在谈论个人贡献者，而是在谈论团队和公司，因此是共同的承诺和团队意识。请随意添加，这些只是一些。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;DOV SEIDMAN：&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这些并不是可有可无的，这就是你所拥有的弄清楚今天很重要吗？&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS：&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;是的。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;DOV SEIDMAN：&lt;/strong>;&lt; /p>; &lt;p>;您刚才没有提到的一些事情是效率、生产力和速度。你在呼唤人类品质。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我认为道德领袖非常清楚改变行为和提升行为之间的区别。因为领导力是关于如何做的。 How we get people to do things, how we generate energy in them, how we enlist them in journeys and missions worthy of their dedication and loyalty.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If I were to put a product on sale, I could get you to buy now and not later, or more not less. If we create a great political attack ad I could get you to vote left not right, or right not left. We know how to use carrots and sticks to shift or nudge behavior. If you give me enough carrots and sticks, I could get you to work faster, maybe have fewer sick days, work 10 hours and not eight.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But the behaviors that you asked for, Adi, no amount of carrots and sticks can get you because this is human beings acting and behaving in their most elevated way. Can you imagine saying to somebody, go in a room and don&#39;t come out or you&#39;ll be fired if you can&#39;t come out with empathy and the ability to engender trust in the other, or you find more courage in being vulnerable. There are no amount of carrots that can coerce people into these behaviors.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Let&#39;s try bonuses, and no amount of sticks. Let&#39;s try carrots. If you tripled everybody&#39;s salaries, Adi, would you get more empathy? Would you get more trust?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;You would not. Probably not.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;DOV SEIDMAN:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We might get the opposite. We find ourselves in a discontinuous moment in leadership where what we want in and out of people, no amount of carrots and sticks can get us.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I&#39;m not against sticks. There should be fireable offenses. But should the fear of being fired animate 2% or 98% of how things happen around this place? I&#39;m really for carrots too. I think we should pay our colleagues as much as possible and hopefully more than our competitors.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But what moral leaders understand is that certain behaviors cannot be coerced. They cannot be motivated, they can only be inspired. Moral leaders are inspirational leaders because trust, empathy, vulnerability, collaborating, honesty, courage, all these human elevated qualities that we aspire to see in those around us must and can only be inspired.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;More leaders understand the difference. We&#39;re seeing this play out in return to the office. More leaders know that if you were my subordinate, Adi, I could insist never lie to me, always tell me the truth, but I could never insist, always be loyal to me. Moral leaders know that certain things they can insist on and other things they have to inspire. And we&#39;re actually seeing this play out with who&#39;s insisting that people come back to the office and who&#39;s trying to inspire it.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Leadership paradigms do shift. And in the past it was command control, “I am the boss.” “I say, you do.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We&#39;re in an era now where we want the empathetic leader and the vulnerable leader. It&#39;s possible there&#39;ll be another turn of the wheel before long and there&#39;s another leadership paradigm.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Is there science, or are there metrics to show that this approach to leadership not only is right in some 30,000-foot moralistic definition, but also in terms of outcome and performance for an institution?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;DOV SEIDMAN:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Let&#39;s get into the science and metrics, but before we do that, here&#39;s what&#39;s not going to change. There&#39;s only two types of behaviors. There&#39;s what you can and can&#39;t do, and what you should and should not do. I believe that Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart said there&#39;s a difference between doing that which you have a right to do and that which is right to do.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We used to specify to people, here&#39;s what you can and can&#39;t do. And then we asked them to pursue goals and strategies mindful of what they can and can&#39;t do as fast and as ambitiously, and they had to outcompete on that basis. In that world, the few, a military general would say, take that hill. A CEO would say, “This is our strategy, these are our goals.” And in that world, everybody&#39;s job is to do the next thing right.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I think the way the world is working today, we want more and more people to not just do the next thing right, but to do the next right thing. I don&#39;t think that shift is ever going back from asking people to do the next thing right, to inspiring them to do the next right thing.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Computers could be programmed to do the next thing right. Only a human being can do the next right thing.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I think we are now in a normative environment, normative as in norms, what you should and should not do. And moral leaders get out of bed to foster normative cultures where people are “should-minded” and that is here to stay.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The reason there&#39;s such an obsession with culture is corporate culture was invented, all culture was invented, to transmit norms from one generation to another. Norms as in what we ought to do and should do. You don&#39;t need culture if you&#39;re just going to specify the rules and the policies and the procedures, but you need to be deliberate and intentional about scaling values, values-based cultures, if you&#39;re going to be normative.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I don&#39;t think this is a fad. I think the world has been reshaped in ways to put us in a normative environment. We&#39;re seeing that in society, in community, and in companies.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I think that&#39;s true. I think there&#39;s also a counterargument though, and maybe this is just high level political counter, but I feel like historians will look back at this era and define it perhaps as one of renewed autocracy, a move away from some of the ideals that you&#39;re talking about. Does that strike you as accurate?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;DOV SEIDMAN:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I said that leadership is about trendlines. Let&#39;s step back. Can you name an autocratic mayor succeeding in terms of how his or her city is being led? Can you think of an autocratic CEO running a Fortune 500 company? Can you think of a championship won in basketball, baseball, soccer, world cup soccer, name the sport in the last 10 years, run by command and control screaming, that top-down coach?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Autocracy is asserting itself or reasserting itself in national politics where a dictator still has his hands on the levers of the military and ability to engage in propaganda, etc. There&#39;s an epic battle between Putin&#39;s autocracy and Zelenskyy&#39;s moral leadership. But if you step back, I&#39;m seeing some wonderful trends towards moral leadership in so many other more local sectors and dimensions of our lives.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The reason I brought up sports is sports is about winning. It&#39;s about becoming a champion and it&#39;s incredible who&#39;s winning in sports. I mean, Steve Kerr with the Golden State Warriors had great talent, but so did his competitors. He had such a bad back one year that he missed 43 games. He wasn&#39;t even there to do the coaching and they did it through a trust-based culture.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Jill Ellis, when she was winning champions as coach of the American women in soccer, she knew the names of the dogs and cats of every one of her players. That&#39;s just a symbol of how personal her coaching began.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;You had &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/01/us-soccers-gregg-berhalter-on-rebuilding-trust-in-the-wake-of-controversy&quot;>;Gregg Berhalter on your show&lt;/a>;, and the US men&#39;s team has been incredibly successful in the last World Cup, and aiming to eclipse that in the next one. But if you listen to how the players talked about what they built there, it was an identity forged in unity. Even though they were a very young team, they tried to outcompete by out-behaving the competition through qualities of boldness and resilience, etc. I have more examples, but I am pretty positive about some large trends here.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When I asked if this is the era of autocracy, part of it is it seems that leadership, at a certain level, political leadership at least, no longer feels shame. I&#39;m old enough that I remembered Richard Nixon and Nixon was accused, was impeached, and clearly he felt shame, and at that point he decided to step down.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I&#39;m not sure today&#39;s political leaders feel shame. And if they don&#39;t feel that, then you open the door for untruths, rival truths, just no sense of responsibility, of morality. I worry about that. I worry that that has been a successful model for some political leaders and that it could inspire others to try to follow that.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;DOV SEIDMAN:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I think that&#39;s a very serious worry. When you mentioned President Nixon, when he said, “I&#39;m not a crook,” he didn&#39;t want us to think that he&#39;s a crook, and whether he was a crook or not, he was celebrating the norm, “Let&#39;s not be crooks.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I believe we are now living in an era of impunity where some people in power are not just misbehaving, they&#39;re doing it with impunity. And impunity takes out and erodes the norm. Not only are we getting the harm that people in high places are causing through their conduct or nefarious conduct, but you do it with impunity, say, “My words are perfect, I&#39;d do it again.” Or they make the rest of us feel that we are somehow losers for wanting to live up to high standards and norms of conduct. You erode the norms.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But that&#39;s an argument for why we need moral leaders, because moral leaders safeguard norms and they help create organizations and communities that are really there to be in fidelity to high norms.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Kanye West, right before his divorce with Adidas, said horrific things and hateful things online. Whether he meant it or not, we could debate, but he said them. But then he said one more thing: There&#39;s nothing Adidas can do to me. That&#39;s a statement of impunity. Adidas took a several billion [dollar] hit at the end of the day by fighting against that, by severing that relationship.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We&#39;re seeing this battle of not just misconduct, but misconduct with impunity and those standing up to it.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When I think of the moral leader, in some ways I think about somebody who leads by example, who just sort of does the right thing and you realize this person is trustworthy, is upright, is inspiring.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It&#39;s a new world now for leadership. We&#39;ve talked about this in previous shows where there is this inescapable imperative for leaders, for CEOs to respond to social and even political issues that lap up against their company, or sometimes are separate from it but employees and customers demand to know where the leader stands.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;By the way, if there isn&#39;t an overt statement, employees and customers will assume and fill the sentence for you. You might as well take a stand. This is tricky territory.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Is there a framework for how a leader manages this new world of perpetual social issues that they&#39;re asked to somehow declare on?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;DOV SEIDMAN:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I&#39;m going to date maybe you. In the movie &lt;em>;The Graduate&lt;/em>;, [a character says to] the Dustin Hoffman character, “The future is plastics.” You just used the word Adi, which is the future is frameworks. All human judgment is framework-dependent. The prevailing framework in business is cost-benefit analysis. Now we need to create and scale new frameworks that are normative.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The world is so interdependent where the hopes, dreams, plight of one person are showing up viscerally and visually on tiny screens in our hands. I mentioned Kanye West. After his divorce with Adidas, he showed up in the lobby of Sketchers, and before Sketchers knew it, they were involved in a social maelstrom of how to respond to his appearance there.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One thing I know for sure that the world has been reshaped in ways to fuse it. Social, environmental, political, human issues, what just happened with the Supreme Court with abortion or how to respond to the invasion of Ukraine: these issues that were once deemed tangential to the business agenda are now inescapably part of it.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Neutrality is over. There is an expectation to have a point of view, especially from employees and consumers and other stakeholders. We need a framework for that.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Pfizer has a great framework. Sally Susman has spoken about it publicly. Does it align with our purpose, given our values, what should our point of view be? How does it impact our constituents? What would be the price of our silence?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tom Wilson has done a great job at Allstate with his framework. There&#39;s a threshold question: “Is what&#39;s going on legal? But even if so, given our values, what should our point of view be? Then if not, let&#39;s continue to challenge these ideas.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I think taking a stand is now something where you don&#39;t just get to say, “Hey, I just run a business. The business of business is business.” I think the business of business is society, it&#39;s community, and how we relate to whatever comes our way, and how thoughtfully and principled we are is now the new expectation.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Thanksgiving dinner is coming in a few months and employees are going to sit there and run into their cousins that they haven&#39;t seen in a long time. At the end of the day, a CEO has to ask herself this question, “Are my colleagues going to be proud of Thanksgiving dinner to brag to their cousins about how their company handled this issue and that issue and this issue and that issue that is now part of their business agenda?” We have to pass that Thanksgiving dinner test.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I love that. I also love the future is in frameworks. I want to go to an audience question now, and this is from Srinivas in India. In an era now where artificial intelligence may be better at making decisions based on data than humans are, can we say that the time has come for conscience-based management or leadership?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;DOV SEIDMAN:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Five hundred years ago we had the scientific revolution, and that was a true revolution. Uber putting yellow taxi cabs in or out of business, LinkedIn maybe making it harder for recruiters, those are disruptions. True revolutions happen about every 500 years.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I think the technological revolution and the revolution that&#39;s being accelerated through AI is an every-500-year revolution. 500 years ago, we looked around and we wanted to be in charge of our surroundings and we said, “We&#39;re the smartest.” Descartes said, “I think, therefore I am.” It was 500 years of revenge of the nerds, and we called it the era of enlightenment and reason. We pretty much organized our affairs by being the smartest. It&#39;s incredible what we achieved: modern capitalism, we proliferated individual rights, biodiversity. It&#39;s incredible what was achieved in the last 500 years.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What&#39;s interesting about AI is it is challenging our monopoly on intelligence. We&#39;re no longer the smartest.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What&#39;s the one thing a machine will never have? A heart. I actually think the technological revolution is putting into stark relief and focus the imperative to scale that which comes from the heart. There&#39;s an adage of moral leadership that only that which comes from the heart enters the heart.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From an economic standpoint in the industrial age, we hired hands and we hired strong hands. Then we went into the knowledge or information economy and we hired heads and we favored knowledge and expertise and specialization. I think we&#39;re going into a more human age where the qualities that emanate from the heart, like the ones you mentioned, empathy and the ability to do the right thing in our capacity for ethics and morality and conscience is now something we&#39;re going to have to scale.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What worries me, Adi, is that when social networks were first launched, we had some utopian thinking, anything that connects the world is going to be great. We will have richer human experiences. Individuals will be empowered. In the first innings we saw pictures of dogs and cats and our acquaintances became close friends again.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But then we started to see that technology is a force for good and bad. Good things can happen and harmful things can happen, including democratic elections being hacked. We saw that we are not just organically divided, but the profit motive has been &amp;nbsp;behind division and people are now pitted against each other and we&#39;re being actively divided through technology.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Those in charge back then often said, “We&#39;re just technology. We&#39;re just a platform.” They proclaimed their moral neutrality. I think, Adi, more important than anything now, we cannot afford with ChatGPT and generative AI to say, “It&#39;s just technology.” We know that good and harmful things are going to happen.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some people are talking about the possible end of humanity. The need for Spider-Man ethics, that with great power comes responsibility, has never been more important. I think those who are purveying these new technologies have unprecedented power, and they&#39;re going to need to scale conscience and Spider-Man ethics.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We&#39;ve been talking mostly about morality and leadership at the highest level, that good leaders have it and people who are selecting good leaders should look for that. This is a question from Shabana from Islamabad in Pakistan. What role do you think leadership development can play in ensuring that individuals throughout an organization embody the same moral values?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;DOV SEIDMAN:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;That&#39;s a great question. Moral leadership, there&#39;s an opportunity to build capacities, not skills, but qualities and capacities. And I think organizations can do that. There are some practices we need to scale of moral leadership and I&#39;m happy to mention a few.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I want to start with the most counterintuitive practice and piece of advice. I think everybody on this gathering would agree that the world&#39;s accelerating, it&#39;s always on. We&#39;re being digitally assaulted. We all experience FOMO, fear of missing out. Fair enough, Adi?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So far so good.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;DOV SEIDMAN:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The faster the world gets, and the more that comes at us, the more we need to pause. The hallmark of moral leadership is the pause. [Ralph Waldo] Emerson said that, “In each pause, I hear the call,” because only when we pause can we even ask ourselves important questions that a moral leader would ask. “How would I feel like if I were treated this way?” “What&#39;s the consequences of doing it this way or that way?”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I like to talk about the four Rs, because in the pause, we can reflect on the challenge, the situation of the world in which we&#39;re operating. We can reconnect with our deeper sense of purpose and our values and conscience. We can rethink some of our assumptions of how we&#39;re operating, how we&#39;re making money, how we&#39;re making decisions. And only then can we reimagine a better solution, or a better path, or a better future. The hallmark of moral leadership is the pause.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Moral leaders also eschew philosophical mistakes. People think, “Oh, moral leaders must be about empowerment.” Well, that&#39;s true spiritually, but often empowerment, you know what happens? This is how a nonmoral leader might sound, “I push decisions to the front lines. I delegate authority.” And they think they&#39;re leading, and then five years later, everybody has all these rights, “I can spend $1,000 without asking my boss for permission.” “I can get on an airplane to a trade association meeting and spend money without asking for permission.” And you&#39;ve built a culture where everybody knows what rights they have. They&#39;re empowered in that way. But you haven&#39;t built a gym where they know the ethos. “What is the way here?”, where they know what is right.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;[Airbnb CEO] Brian Chesky recently came out against this form of empowerment, and said that he wants to be an orchestrator. Moral leaders don&#39;t just get out of the way and delegate. They show up, and they sit at the back of the room sometimes. They don&#39;t provide the answer. They ask the right questions. So there really are opportunities to be incisive and rigorous about what it is and what it&#39;s not.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;You&#39;ve identified the hallmarks of moral leadership. I&#39;m curious, as you look out at US companies, global companies, are many of them or most of them run by people you would consider moral leaders?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;DOV SEIDMAN:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Two things: I think what matters is not to look for beacons. I&#39;ve never seen a unicorn, but I&#39;ve seen a horse. I&#39;ve seen a horn. I&#39;ve seen white. I look for who&#39;s engendering trust by extending it. Who&#39;s creating such a high-trust environment where people feel that they can lean and take risks in order to innovate?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Most innovation programs fail because trust is so low that people won&#39;t take the risk in order to innovate. I look not for perfection, and I think what matters most, Adi, is not who&#39;s a beacon and an icon of moral leadership, but who is authentically and deliberately on the journey. Who&#39;s taking risk in that regard? Who&#39;s being courageous in that regard? It&#39;s not about perfection in that way.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;And maybe I should end with the following: linearity is over in this world. We&#39;re in an up-and-down world, and the leaders who frame the future as a journey really elevate others, because nothing elevates a human beings more than being on a journey of progress, where we go up and down, but we stick together.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Increasingly, I&#39;m seeing people have the confidence and the courage to frame that path ahead as a journey, develop an ethos for being on a journey together. I really think that nothing elevates somebody else more than framing the path ahead as a journey and creating an ethos where together, we can journey together, because to journey is to do something human.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;That&#39;s fantastic. Your words are inspiring.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;DOV SEIDMAN:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Can I say one last thing? Did you ever hear in business, “Hope is not a strategy?”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yeah.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;DOV SEIDMAN:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Through budgeting, planning, and control, we&#39;re going to superimpose the future, and that&#39;s kind of, “Hope is not a strategy.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yeah.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;DOV SEIDMAN:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Well, I&#39;m also here to say that without hope, there is no strategy. Moral leaders purvey hope, and they inspire hope in others by really helping them see possibility, helping them embrace the commonality in the other, so that we can do things together.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Moral leaders really fight against the non-adage that hope is not a strategy, because they know that without hope, there is no strategy, and they&#39;re prepared to paint a picture of a distant future, but with rigor to go that way.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I want to apologize for not answering your question before about metrics. I&#39;m just going to say the following. Metrics are moral choices. When we measure something, we&#39;re saying it matters. When we don&#39;t measure something, we say it doesn&#39;t matter. Moral leaders pause, and they pick the right metrics that move them on the journey, because they know that metrics don&#39;t come from on high. In and of themselves, they reflect our values.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Dov Seidman, thank you for being on “The New World of Work”.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;DOV SEIDMAN:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Adi, great to be with you.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 22 Sep 2023 23:55:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Web3 Could Change the Business Model of Creative Work]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/09/web3-could-change-the-business-model-of-creative-work]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/09/Sep23_22_skizzomat.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;Illustration by Skizzomat&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;Web3 &amp;#8212; the read-write-own web &amp;#8212; could offer a new model for creative work. By offering new tools to earn and own assets, build wealth, and wrestle back control from powerful platforms and intermediaries, it has the potential to simplify how creators fund their ventures and new ways to earn a living, not just on the first sale of a work of art but in &lt;a href=&quot;https://defillama.com/nfts/earnings&quot;>;perpetuity&lt;/a>; thanks to programmatic royalty streams paid via smart contracts, self-executing code that can move and store money. If Web1 and Web2 democratized access to information and made it easier to collaborate online, Web3 equips creators with a new toolkit to build real wealth from their work, on a globally level playing field.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/web3-could-change-the-business-model-of-creative-work?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/web3-could-change-the-business-model-of-creative-work?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;For most of the industrial age, technology has acted as a tailwind for creators, powering an age of mass culture that supported a professional class of working artists. However, more recently, the rise of &lt;em>;digital &lt;/em>;technology — specifically, the internet and AI — has become a source of economic dislocation.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Web1, the so-called “read web,” was a digital printing press that democratized access to information, but it also commoditized art and music and undermined creators&#39; rights as their IP got laundered in the web&#39;s swirling washing machine of content.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Web2, the “read-write web,” made it easier to publish content, share ideas and access a broader audience (ie, “write” to the internet) but it also confined creators to tightly run platforms they did not trust or control and where they lacked transparency into the economic impact of their work. Either that or risk the wilderness of the web where their creations could be copied without recourse. Digital artists had no easy way to monetize their creations and could not benefit when works were resold.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The platforms that control content distribution have grown richer and more powerful, with precious little of that windfall trickling down to creators. Consider the strikes of the Writers Guild of America (WGA) and the Screen Actors Guild–American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG–AFTRA). Streaming has already shortened television seasons, shrunk writers&#39; rooms, and eroded artists&#39; traditional residual revenues; and generative AI and 3D modeling give companies more tools for further minimizing their use of writers and actors.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;By contrast, &lt;a href=&quot;/2022/05/what-is-web3&quot;>;Web3&lt;/a>; — the read-write-own web — offers new tools to earn and own assets, build wealth, and wrestle back control from powerful platforms and intermediaries. Web3 could simplify how creators fund their ventures by crowdsourcing new titles directly from their fans. It could offer new ways to earn a living, not just on the first sale of a work of art but in &lt;a href=&quot;https://defillama.com/nfts/earnings&quot;>;perpetuity&lt;/a>; thanks to programmatic royalty streams paid via smart contracts, self-executing code that can move and store money. In other words, it might offer a new model for creative work.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;AI: Risk or Opportunity?&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Now, new technologies — namely, generative AI — pose new challenges for composers, screenwriters, visual artists, and other creative workers. It is too early to say whether AI will be all bad for all of them; it may expanding the ranks of professional artists or grow the market for culture and creating opportunities for humans to co-create or collaborate with AI on an equal footing. But it could also starkly devalue the work of copywriters, composers, and artists, and relegate these workers to supporting roles, such as polishing scripts or adding some depth of feeling to digitally rendered art. Cezanne said, “A work of art which did not begin in emotion is not art,” but plenty of studio executives &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/technology/disney-creates-task-force-explore-ai-cut-costs-sources-2023-08-08/&quot;>;see AI as a way to cut costs&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;By analyzing hundreds of thousands of scripts against their viewership patterns over time, AI will get better at mimicking the stickiest and most bingeworthy of screenwriters&#39; styles, characters, and plots, not just to extend the arcs of existing stories but to synthesize all-new series and recommend the optimal cast or mix of character types. Ditto on the virtual replication of actors, with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/indiana-jones-and-the-dial-of-destiny-de-aging-tech/&quot;>;tools like FaceSwap already in use&lt;/a>; to de-age stars like Harrison Ford for his latest portrayal of Indiana Jones. But such big names likely consent to such innovations on their own terms. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vox.com/money/2023/8/22/23840473/writers-strike-actors-wga-sag-workers-economy-impact&quot;>;As &lt;em>;Vox&lt;/em>; put it&lt;/a>;, “If people don&#39;t lock down control of their digital twins, then nothing else matters.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Oscar winning director Stephen Soderbergh &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/steven-soderbergh-streaming-data-transparency-1235551409/&quot;>;told the &lt;em>;Hollywood Reporter&lt;/em>;&lt;/a>; that, more than AI or visual effects, what keeps him up at night is the opacity of streaming data: He speculates that the studios are doing really well and don&#39;t want to share the wealth, or else really poorly and don&#39;t want their stocks to tank.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Artists hoped that the internet would help to disintermediate gatekeepers and middlemen, and change power dynamics in creative industries, but instead it added new intermediaries like streamers and platforms that distanced artists from their fans and obfuscated their economic impact. We need something different.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Culture Needs a New Business Model&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;If technology is upending the longstanding business model of creative industries, it&#39;s also offering opportunities to establish a new one that can work better for creative workers.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Web3 technologies can simplify how creators track the usage of their IP and to monetize it, ensuring they get paid promptly and fairly for their work. For instance, Web3 technologies could allow artists to grow and perhaps even thrive along with AI, rather than suffer at its expense. For example, smart contracts can create avenues for artists to be compensated when their work is used to train AI like a large language model.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Web3 adds an &lt;em>;economic layer&lt;/em>; and a &lt;em>;rights layer&lt;/em>; to the Internet stack, where users can not only track the provenance of information and intellectual property but also protect, manage, and monetize these digital assets themselves with transparency peer to peer. These innovations can also change how creative ventures are funded, removing industry gatekeepers and amplifying underrepresented voices. In the Philippines, independent game studios are selling NFTs of in-game assets to gamers directly to fund new titles, disintermediating big studios and traditional financial backers.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For Jules Urbach, CEO of cloud graphics company OTOY, Web3 is fit for this purpose. OTOY&#39;s flagship product, OctaneRender, is what&#39;s known as an “unbiased, spatially correct graphics processing unit (GPU) render engine,” which is the industry&#39;s way of describing powerful software that can render more lifelike images and video than what came before. Marvel Studios used OctaneRender in the opening of &lt;em>;Ant-Man and the Wasp&lt;/em>;, according to Urbach.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Using the cloud, OTOY is able to harness dozens — and sometimes hundreds — of GPUs at a time in its network to break down projects into smaller parts.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;By breaking up tasks, OTOY helps democratize the compute-intensive process of rendering, allowing artists to render in a couple of minutes what used to take hours on expensive hardware setups. Most important, anything created in the render network creates a hash on a blockchain, for the verifiable provenance essential to managing artists&#39; IP rights and moving digital goods from platform to platform. With such capabilities, artist guilds could create a set of smart contract templates for their members to use in managing such life-like renderings of themselves — their digital twins — and collect privatized data on industry usage that would give them bargaining power in future negotiations. The contracts could represent the artist guilds&#39; negotiated terms, plus whatever the individual artists or their agents have negotiated.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;From Hollywood to Everywhere&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;This technology also offers artists ways to flip the traditional top-down model where studios and streamers try to control everything from IP to distribution. Hollywood screenwriter Jessie Nickson-Lopez has brought some of modern TV&#39;s most indelible characters to life. As a founding member of the writing team on &lt;em>;Stranger Things&lt;/em>;, she developed the story line for the character Eleven. Recently, as cofounder of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mv3.io/&quot;>;Web3 startup MV3&lt;/a>;, she launched a collection of 6,500 non-fungible tokens (NFTs) of different characters, the building blocks for what will be a richly rendered narrative “universe,” originally created by Nickson-Lopez and her team. Set in the “dystopian cyberpunk society” of 2081, after the “climate has gone to hell,” MV3 focuses on “a ragtag group of idealistic” rebels struggling to “take power from the corporation that owns the city.” NFT owners will participate in the IP, have a say in their character&#39;s arc, and even co-create the story with the MV3 team. These different character assets could ultimately appear in film, TV, and other storytelling media. They could be playable characters in videogames or avatars in the metaverse.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Knowing that fans will support a project is key for firing up the Hollywood machine to spend $100 million or more on a film or TV show. Nickson-Lopez said, “So we reverse-engineered it, and I created the world of Eluna City and the characters that reside in it.” Though Nickson-Lopez architected this world and crafted story lines for main characters, MV3 will not decide the direction of the story. “For me, what&#39;s been most exciting is seeing how much creativity we&#39;re inspiring in people who have never created before but are consumers of dystopian worlds and of fiction. There&#39;s this hunger to play. Our fans are our community and our co-creators. Because they&#39;re invested in the world and in the characters, they&#39;re really excited to build it up with us.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;MV3 inverts the Hollywood model. “As my lawyers say, &#39;It&#39;s like you&#39;re ripping off pieces of value and just giving it to people.&#39; And we&#39;re like, &#39;Exactly! That&#39;s exactly what we&#39;re doing.&#39;” Recently, the founders handed control day-to-day control of the MV3 universe to the community.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;. . .&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Ultimately, projects like OctaneRender and MV3 will work because they engage their communities not only in the economic upside but also in the governance. Handing over control and economics to fans is antithetical to the Hollywood model, and Nickson-Lopez recognizes that. Engaging people in the creative process, for love of the experience and not just for money, is what clearly drives these creators and gives their projects purpose and meaning.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Technology tools and human capital are more distributed than ever. If Web1 and Web2 democratized access to information and made it easier to collaborate online, Web3 equips creators with a new toolkit to build real wealth from their work, on a globally level playing field. As the saying goes, the future is not to be predicted; it is to be achieved. For cultural industries and much else, Web3 can help us do it.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 22 Sep 2023 23:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[How Software Companies Can Avoid the Trap of Product-Led Growth]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/09/how-software-companies-can-avoid-the-trap-of-product-led-growth]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/09/Sep23_22_1603508378.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;designer491/Getty Images&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;Companies like Slack and Dropbox have pioneered the use of Product-Led Growth (PLG). They start by building a product that&amp;#8217;s indispensable for small teams, then count on low friction and customer advocates to expand throughout the organization. PLG works, at least at first. But it can create challenges for growing companies. The answer isn&amp;#8217;t to reject PLG. It&amp;#8217;s to embrace it &amp;#8212; but to plan ahead. Eventually, even the best PLG company will need an enterprise sales strategy which takes years to develop. Don&amp;#8217;t wait until product-led growth stalls to plan for a multi-pronged sales strategy.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/how-software-companies-can-avoid-the-trap-of-product-led-growth?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/how-software-companies-can-avoid-the-trap-of-product-led-growth?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;Enterprise tech companies usually grow by investing in a costly sales and marketing operation, suffering through long, expensive sales cycles. Eventually, if it works, their software is adopted “top down” throughout an enterprise. That approach is tried-and-true, but it&#39;s not the one that Dropbox or Slack followed. Over the last decade, those companies and many others have pioneered a disruptive new business model that is taking over the $250 billion software-as-a-service market. It&#39;s called Product-Led Growth (PLG).&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The PLG playbook is elegant in its simplicity: First, build a compelling product that is indispensable to end-users. Then, encourage widespread internal usage with zero friction and increasingly add value for those individual end-users. Finally, leverage internal champions and their case studies to approach corporate buyers in IT to purchase the product for company-wide use. One of us, Oliver, executed this strategy successfully as a sales leader at both Dropbox and Asana.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When it comes to building initial traction, the merits of the PLG model are clear. A recent Bain &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bain.com/insights/what-it-really-takes-to-develop-product-led-growth/&quot;>;study&lt;/a>; showed that PLG companies in the past few years had generally experienced higher revenue and market share growth compared to non-PLG companies.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, there is a catch. Companies that follow the PLG playbook risk getting stuck in what we call the PLG trap. Although the PLG approach yields rapid initial adoption and growth, scaling a PLG company is a different story. &lt;a href=&quot;https://tomtunguz.com/plg-less-profitable/&quot;>;A recent analysis&lt;/a>; showed that public companies that initially pursued a PLG model are actually 5–10% less profitable compared to their sales-led counterparts — implying that many PLG companies, despite initially benefiting from superior unit economics, actually lose efficiency as they scale.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For ambitious managers of software companies, the lesson is not to avoid taking a PLG approach. Instead, embrace PLG as an initial strategy, but commit to winning the enterprise over the long term. Plan ahead and you can avoid the PLG Trap.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Understanding the PLG Trap&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Eventually, scaling an enterprise tech company will require classic enterprise sales. But adding enterprise sales as part of a multi-pronged approach to growth isn&#39;t like flipping a switch. It takes years to craft and execute an enterprise product roadmap and go-to-market strategy. PLG companies that neglect this approach early on will, unfortunately, find themselves stuck once they&#39;ve tapped the pool of initial bottoms-up users. Very few companies have demonstrated an ability to escape the PLG Trap once they become stuck.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The PLG Trap creates a common and natural dilemma for SaaS executives and boards, for several reasons:&lt;/p>; &lt;ol>; &lt;li>;In building a great product that is appealing to end-users, companies optimize their product and support organizations for small teams.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;When expansion opportunities emerge, companies add the bare minimum feature set (such as additional security, reporting, and administrative features) to drive initial adoption from classic early adopter customers.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Success with these early adopters inspires the company to quickly scale up an outbound enterprise sales and marketing team to execute this top-down, sales-led motion.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;The company then realizes they&#39;re trapped in a chasm: the early adopters found the minimum feature set adequate, but the majority of the market does not. Meanwhile, the customer support team is not accustomed to servicing large enterprises and the marketing team has been targeting small end users, not senior IT executives. The PLG company is not truly “enterprise ready” on a product or organizational level. Sales stall.&lt;/li>; &lt;/ol>; &lt;p>;A PLG company makes each decision logically along the way — but each decision may be a step deeper into the PLG Trap. Many companies find themselves trapped around the Series C stage — about 200-400 employees — but the principles apply to larger, public companies as well. For example, Dropbox has seen steadily declining year-over-year revenue growth from 25% in 2018 to only 8% in 2023 due to a failure to make this transition. Seamlessly transitioning from a PLG to an enterprise company, by avoiding the PLG Trap, requires deliberate planning from an early stage.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Avoiding the PLG trap&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;To become fully enterprise-ready, a PLG company must simultaneously provide bottom-up value and be prepared to eventually deliver value at enterprise-scale. Here are three activities a PLG company must do to seamlessly evolve from a PLG-only to a PLG + enterprise company that can avoid the trap:&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Create communities of champions across multiple levels in the customer organization.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;The most successful PLG companies take inspiration from successful open-sourced companies and nurture community-building as a long-term, must-win, competitive advantage. Building an advocacy program becomes a core competency from an early stage, even before investing in monetization. It&#39;s important to note that PLG companies need to build multi-tiered community programs to appeal to multiple stakeholders, unlike sales-led companies that can primarily focus on developing executive champions. PLG companies must develop champions on the end-user, IT, and executive levels, with each level likely requiring a different approach to community building.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Build a go-to-market plan (GTM) that incorporates multiple sales motions.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Successful PLG companies may start with one GTM motion, but eventually they build multiple GTM motions to capture different types of customer opportunities. Unlike sales-led organizations, which are often segmented by customer size (ie, SMB vs. Enterprise), PLG companies are often segmented by selling motions.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The most popular motions PLG companies build include:&lt;/p>; &lt;ol>; &lt;li>;&lt;em>;self-service&lt;/em>;: an e-commerce experience that generates demand and captures end-users to land in organizations&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;em>;high-velocity sales&lt;/em>;: a data-driven sales motion that uses modern customer relationship management (CRM) tools, automated workflows, and analytical segmentation to identify and convert organizations with higher willingness to pay,&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;em>;expansion sales: &lt;/em>;a capability focusing on transitioning organizations with strong product usage to adopt the product company-wide, and&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;em>;outbound sales: &lt;/em>;an outbound motion targeting senior executives at prospects that may not have as much organic product adoption.&lt;/li>; &lt;/ol>; &lt;h3>;Deliver product value across multiple levels, including at enterprise scale.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;PLG companies often begin by providing value to end-users or small teams. The bottoms-up adoption fuels viral adoption of the product in organizations. As PLG companies scale, they must also deliver product value to centralized buying personas like IT and executives. To address IT, many PLG companies develop an enterprise version with greater administration and security capabilities. To appeal to executives, some PLG companies, like the database software company MongoDB, naturally deliver enterprise-scale value due to the nature of the product. Other PLG companies, especially those on the application layer, may need to build, acquire or package adjacent products that deliver value on an enterprise scale. HubSpot has done this very effectively, graduating from a lightweight and narrow blogging tool to a fulsome CRM useful for larger enterprises.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Case Study: MongoDB&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;The database software company, MongoDB is an example of a company that successfully avoided the PLG Trap, despite starting with a bottoms-up sales motion. (One of us, Jeff, is a partner at a venture capital firm that invested in MongoDB.) With over $1 billion in sales, the company has nearly 2,000 customers spending over $100,000 per year on its software. Yet the company&#39;s origins are as an open-source tool that end users could download for free.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Released in 2009, the company&#39;s initial product — an open source, document-based database tuned for the rise of Internet applications and the era of big data — attracted millions of downloads. As the company grew in popularity among large enterprise customers such as Goldman Sachs and Thermo, it built advanced security features and invested in dramatic scalability in order to earn its way into the enterprise. In parallel, MongoDB created an enterprise-ready sales force, marketing team, and customer success function.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Whereas in early 2015, the company had just over 100 customers with over $100,000 per year, by late 2023 that figure had grown 20x. At the same time as it re-engineered the organization to be enterprise-ready, with multiple sales motions, a flexible product configuration, and a large investment in fostering its end-user community. By building both an enterprise-ready organization and a community-driven organization, MongoDB has scaled smoothly beyond the PLG trap to become one of the largest software companies in the world. As of this writing, the product has been downloaded more than 265 million times.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;By planning ahead, PLG companies can make the necessary strategic decisions to build a team and product platform that is truly enterprise-ready. The PLG model is seductively simple. Winning software companies need to be willing to embrace complexity — expanding beyond the typical managerial advice to “do one thing and do it well” and instead succeed in chewing gum and walking at the same time.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 22 Sep 2023 22:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[5 Types of Stories Leaders Need to Tell]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/09/5-types-of-stories-leaders-need-to-tell]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/09/Sep23_22_1417699431.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;horstgerlach/Getty Images&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;Storytelling is an important leadership skill, and executives who want to succeed should master five types of narrative: Vision stories, which inspire a shared one; values stories that model the way; action stories that spark progress and change; teaching stories that transmit knowledge and skills to others; and trust stories that help people understand, connect with, and believe in you.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/5-types-of-stories-leaders-need-to-tell?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/5-types-of-stories-leaders-need-to-tell?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;The historian Doris Kearns Goodwin was once asked what questions she would put to Abraham Lincoln if given the chance. “I feel like a bad historian,” she answered, “but I&#39;d probably ask him to tell me a story.” As she herself has documented, the 16&lt;sup>;th&lt;/sup>; US president was not just a great political leader but also a masterful raconteur, who used stories to entertain, educate, and inspire.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Storytelling is an important leadership skill. As psychologists Gordon H. Bower and Michal C. Clark of Stanford first observed in 1969, we&#39;re 7 times more likely to remember a fact when it&#39;s wrapped in story. Telling stories can also help with all five of the effective leadership practices that Santa Clara University professors James M. Kouzes and Barry Z. Posner lay out in their book &lt;em>;The Leadership Challenge&lt;/em>;: 1) model the way, 2) inspire a shared vision, 3) challenge the process, 4) enable others to act, and 5) encourage the heart&lt;em>;.&lt;/em>; But it&#39;s important to learn which types of stories lead to which outcomes.

Trust stories humanize you as a leader and allow you to &lt;em>;encourage the heart&lt;/em>; of your team.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Thasunda Brown Duckett, president and CEO of TIAA, &lt;a href=&quot;https://luvvie.org/podcast/thasunda-brown-duckett/&quot;>;connects her memories&lt;/a>; of being the only Black girl on the soccer team not invited to a teammate&#39;s birthday party to often being the only woman and person of color in a meeting. When you demonstrate vulnerability by sharing a personal story, others will be inspired to reciprocate, creating a virtuous circle of trust.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Teaching Story&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Brené Brown defines a leader as “anyone who sees potential in people and has the courage to develop that potential.” Great leaders need to be great teachers. Stories allow you to simplify complex topics by providing easy-to-follow models for behavior and skills.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As chairman, president, and CEO of Lowe&#39;s, Marvin Ellison uses &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/2022/03/08/1085285796/lowes-marvin-ellison&quot;>;stories from his life to teach&lt;/a>; his team. Early in his career, when he worked at Target, a senior leader from corporate visited his store and asked employees for feedback. When no one spoke up, Ellison volunteered that a new system wasn&#39;t working as intended. In the end, the system was fixed and Ellison was recognized for speaking up. Now, he tells this story when visiting Lowe&#39;s locations as a way of &lt;em>;enabling others to act &lt;/em>;with candor and promoting a feedback-driven culture.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;While a trust story is built around you, a teaching story and the other three types can also be an indirect narrative — using someone else&#39;s story, a fictional one, or a parable to deliver your message. Just make sure your audience can identify and empathize with the protagonist so they want the same thing for themselves.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Action Story&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;A big part of a leader&#39;s job is to inspire action — and one of the best ways to do that is through an story that leaves the audience thinking, “If we do this (insert your desired action here), then we will get that (the desired result).”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Entrepreneurs can use action stories to launch new business ideas. Canva founder and CEO Melanie Perkins dreamed of making graphic design accessible. To do this, she needed to create a new story for investors. “People are scared of designing,” says &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/2021/02/26/971813519/canva-melanie-perkins-2019&quot;>;Perkins&lt;/a>;. “They&#39;re conditioned their whole lives to think that they&#39;re not creative.” Early success stories included people completing simple design challenges and creating resumes that helped them land jobs.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Action stories can also be used to inspire organizational change. Former CEO Indra Nooyi used story to &lt;em>;challenge the process &lt;/em>;at PepsiCo, shifting a product portfolio that was primarily sugar-based to something more health conscious. She wanted to maintain the sense of fun but ensure that it was also good for you. “Words that speak to people&#39;s hearts are more important than speaking to their minds,” &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ted.com/podcasts/worklife/taken-for-granted-indra-nooyi-says-its-time-for-leaders-to-care-part-2-transcript&quot;>;Nooyi shares&lt;/a>;.

Chobani&#39;s CEO and founder Hamdi Ulukaya frequently &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ted.com/podcasts/rethinking-with-adam-grant/anti-ceo-playbook-with-chobani-founder-hamdi-ulukaya-transcript&quot;>;shares tales&lt;/a>; of growing up amid corruption in Turkey and explains how it made him want to become a more ethical business leader. These stories communicate personal and organizational values and encourage values-driven behavior in others.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Vision Story&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;History is full of examples of leaders using vision stories. Following the evacuation at Dunkirk, Winston Churchill vividly described a Britain that would “fight on the seas and oceans” and “never surrender.” In his iconic “I Have a Dream” speech, Martin Luther King, Jr. used story to paint a picture of a world in which “man would not be judged by the color of his skin but the content of his character.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In business, GM CEO Mary Barra &lt;a href=&quot;/podcast/2021/05/ceo-series-mary-barra-of-general-motors-on-committing-to-an-eco-friendly-future&quot;>;uses story&lt;/a>; to illustrate a future with “zero crashes, zero emissions, and zero congestion.” In taking the reins as the first non-founder CEO at Microsoft, Satya Nadella needed to shift the culture internally from being “know-it-alls” to “learn-it-alls.” To promote the “learn-it-all” mindset, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ted.com/podcasts/satya-nadella-is-building-the-future-transcript&quot;>;Nadella shared a story about his dad&lt;/a>;. “He had this diary he would write in every day — people met, ideas generated to act on. It&#39;s a continuous system.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Stories make the unseen future feel vivid and real, &lt;em>;inspiring a shared vision&lt;/em>; that listeners will commit to and make progress toward.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As Kouzes and Posner&#39;s title implies, leadership is a challenge. But story can help with all five practices of effective leadership. Vision stories inspire a shared one. Values stories model the way. Action stories can spark change and, in turn, challenge the process. Teaching stories transmit knowledge and skills to others, enabling them to act. And when you share your own story you build trust and encourage the heart.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 22 Sep 2023 21:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[How the Food Industry Is Using Cross-Training to Boost Service]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/09/how-the-food-industry-is-using-cross-training-to-boost-service]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/09/Sep23_22_1137557948.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;HBR Staff; Mesut Ugurlu/Getty Images; Unsplash&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;Cross-training employees on a variety of tasks can be a powerful tool for improving operations, as well as for attracting and retaining workers. When employees are cross-trained to perform a variety of both customer-facing and non-customer-facing tasks, they can adjust their work depending on demand and business needs. Of course, that&amp;#8217;s good for the business, but it also makes the job better for workers. For one thing, when employees are more productive and contribute more, companies can pay them more. Cross-training helps employees build capabilities that they can leverage in their career growth. It also enables more stable schedules. This article shows how several small food companies were able to use cross-training to improve service and job quality. Any industry can learn from these approaches to improve operations, customer experience, and employee experience.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/how-the-food-industry-is-using-cross-training-to-boost-service?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/how-the-food-industry-is-using-cross-training-to-boost-service?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;People are dining out again, but restaurants aren&#39;t always &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/30/dining/restaurant-prices-service.html?utm_source=Sailthru&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Issue:%202023-05-30%20Restaurant%20Dive%20%5Bissue:50879%5D&amp;amp;utm_term=Restaurant%20Dive&quot;>;able to serve them well&lt;/a>;. Like many other service businesses, they face two operational challenges: attracting and retaining enough workers, and coping with highly &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/chain-restaurant-local-restaurant-closing-11673616374&quot;>;variable demand&lt;/a>;. One lever for improving on both counts is cross-training — that is, training employees for a variety of tasks.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Cross-training is a powerful tool, but it is far from a new idea: One of us (Zeynep) first observed cross-training as part of a &lt;a href=&quot;/2017/11/the-case-for-good-jobs&quot;>;“good jobs system”&lt;/a>; that enabled low-cost retailers like Costco and Trader Joe&#39;s to pay more than their competitors while driving better value for customers. Beyond the service industry, manufacturers like Toyota have &lt;a href=&quot;/1999/09/decoding-the-dna-of-the-toyota-production-system&quot;>;long practiced&lt;/a>; cross-training to improve motivation and involve the frontlines in continuous improvement. And in their landmark &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0030507376900167&quot;>;1976 study&lt;/a>;, J. Richard Hackman and Greg R. Oldham identified task variety as a driver of employee motivation across a variety of industries.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When employees are cross-trained to perform a variety of both customer-facing and non-customer-facing tasks, they can adjust their work depending on demand and business needs. Of course, that&#39;s good for the business, but it also makes the job a &lt;em>;better&lt;/em>; job for workers. For one thing, when employees are more productive and contribute more, companies can pay them more; higher productivity is what enables a typical Costco worker to earn &lt;a href=&quot;https://s201.q4cdn.com/287523651/files/doc_events/2023/Jan/19/costco-annual-shareholders&#39;-meeting-slide-deck-jan2023.pdf&quot;>;almost $10 an hour&lt;/a>; more than a typical retail worker. Cross-training helps employees build capabilities that they can leverage in their career growth and career paths. Cross-training also enables more stable schedules; instead of changing the number of workers throughout the day or week, companies can keep more consistent teams and just change &lt;em>;what&lt;/em>; they do, instead of changing &lt;em>;who&lt;/em>; is scheduled to work.&lt;/p>; &lt;article-promo>; &lt;hbr-component type=&quot;promo&quot; is-insight=&quot;insight-center&quot; title=&quot;The New Age of Operations&quot; dek=&quot;Improving efficiency and increasing resilience.&quot; cta-text=&quot;&quot; href=&quot;/insight-center/the-new-age-of-operations&quot;>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/insight-center/the-new-age-of-operations&quot; style=&quot;color:black;text-decoration:none&quot;>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; Insight Center Collection &lt;/div>; &lt;h3>;The New Age of Operations&lt;/h3>; &lt;div>; Improving efficiency and increasing resilience. &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hbr-component>; &lt;/article-promo>; &lt;p>;But these benefits should be balanced with a possible downside: a lack of specialization and ownership. At the Good Jobs Institute, our work with a variety of small food businesses has shown us how they can make the best use of cross-training to improve service and job quality. Any industry can learn from these approaches to design flexibility into their job design and operations.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Approaches to Cross-Training at Three Small Food Businesses&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Employees don&#39;t have to be cross-trained to do everything, but a little bit of cross-training can go a long way. Three small food businesses we&#39;ve worked with have each found their own way to balance flexibility with specialization and ownership:&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Counter service&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;At two franchised locations of the Moe&#39;s Original BBQ chain, there was a strict boundary between front-of-house and kitchen teams, making it difficult to adjust to demand peaks. Owner Dewey Hasbrouck introduced cross-training between the two specialized teams so that they could cover each other on typical bottleneck tasks. For instance, when there were long lines at the counter, kitchen staff could now step in to answer the phones, bring food out to tables, and bag to-go orders. If it was the kitchen that was backlogged, the front-of-house team could fill sauce cups, restock the line, and prepare basic sides.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Bakery&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;At She Wolf Bakery, the production team baked bread in the bakery and the sales team sold it at New York City Greenmarkets, seldom interacting. The teams were often busy at different times: the production team would be overwhelmed preparing bread on Fridays, while the sales team was busiest on Saturdays.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Head of operations Kim Vallejo realized there was an opportunity to better integrate the two teams. While bakers were already being trained on some of the packing duties, She Wolf also started offering a four-hour paid bakery orientation for new sales team members, during which they could take part in the bread-making process. They learned basic bakery side work like running the dish pit and oiling pans, which were very helpful to bakers during a rush, and the two teams also got to know each other better, which made them more motivated to help each other out.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Full service&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Tacombi, a Mexican restaurant chain with locations in New York City, introduced cross-training while navigating the city&#39;s strict tipping regulations, which don&#39;t allow employees in non-tipped roles to perform customer-facing tasks. The staff in their full-service concepts included many highly specialized roles, such as hosts, runners, bussers, and servers in the front, and dishwashers, prep cooks, quality control leaders (who manage the kitchen flow and check quality), and chefs in the back.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Operations leader Jose De La Campa noticed that scheduling these specialists was very complex and created service issues when someone called out sick. The work wasn&#39;t evenly distributed over time; at any given moment, the prep cooks might have nothing to do while the dish washers were swamped. But they were neither trained nor expected to help each other. De La Campa decided to reduce the number of specialist job codes; for example, in most restaurants, he combined the responsibilities of prep cooks and dishwashers, combined the roles of head chef and quality control leader, and removed the host role, redistributing that work to the other front-of-house positions, such as servers.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;The Impact of Cross-Training on Performance and Jobs&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;When employees can contribute to different parts of the business, it can improve service, increase production capacity, and make jobs better for the people doing them.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Better service&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;At She Wolf, cross-training helped teams take more ownership to keep production running when faced with the unexpected variability of call outs, so they could always be there for their customers with quality bread. According to Vallejo, “If we are in the weeds and down three people and it&#39;s a Friday and all hands on deck, my delivery driver knows how to run the dish pit and they can jump back there and help us get ahead.” Training market team members on basic prep tasks also freed up bakers&#39; time to focus on higher-value tasks, ensuring bread quality didn&#39;t suffer due to unexpected variability.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When Tacombi relied on highly specialized roles, an absent dishwasher could paralyze operations. With fewer specialist roles and appropriate cross-training, an unexpected sick day could more easily be absorbed by the rest of the team. De La Campa also said that it improved the food and service: The head chef now had more ownership over quality control, motivating them to identify issues and provide proper feedback to the rest of the team.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Higher production capacity&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;At Moe&#39;s Original BBQ, because team members could flex into different customer-facing and non-customer-facing tasks, they had enough slack to deal with demand peaks. This translated to higher-quality food and service. More significantly, the cross-trained team had the expertise to take on more catering orders. Catering sales increased by 60% in the first year, without Moe&#39;s having to significantly change its staffing levels.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Better jobs&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;All three businesses ended up raising pay. Their cross-trained employees were more productive and could contribute to more areas of the operation, making higher pay a good investment. Cross-training created a new talent pipeline for She Wolf: By allowing the market staff to get production experience, management could identify potential new bakers and help them make the transition onto the bakery team when they needed to hire. For those employees, this meant career growth and higher wages. Cross-training also helped these businesses give their people better — that is, more regular — schedules, since staffing didn&#39;t necessarily have to lurch up and down with the number of customers.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Cross-training helped make the work more meaningful. At Moe&#39;s Original BBQ, cross-training contributed to better communication and a sense of belonging: The staff started insisting that they be referred to as “one team,” not “front-of-house” and “back-of-house.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The combination of higher pay, better schedules, and better work helped Moe&#39;s Original BBQ reduce employee turnover by 30%, which then helped them improve their performance even more.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Why Cross-Training Isn&#39;t More Common&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Many company leaders like the idea of cross-training, but aren&#39;t convinced it will work for them. Some think their employees can&#39;t handle — or aren&#39;t motivated to learn — a variety of roles.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One genuine risk is that introducing cross-training &lt;em>;in isolation&lt;/em>; could create operational problems; if employees are already overloaded or have low tenure, or if the company can&#39;t set and enforce high expectations, introducing cross-training might lead to more errors and frustration. The key is creating &lt;em>;a system that enables cross-training. &lt;/em>;At the small food businesses, this involved some complementary choices:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;Simplifying operations to remove non-value-add work so that employees only spend their time learning tasks that improve the customer experience.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Simplifying operations to reduce &lt;a href=&quot;/2022/03/give-service-workers-stable-schedules&quot;>;self-inflicted variability&lt;/a>;&amp;nbsp;— that is, to smooth the workload and make the peaks more manageable.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Setting clear standards to ensure that employees can be consistent in different roles.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Empowering employees to use their judgment to decide which tasks to do when.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Staffing with slack so that people have enough time to learn new tasks.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Investing in people to attract and retain great staff and hold teams accountable to high expectations.&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;Moe&#39;s Original BBQ had been trying to introduce cross-training for several years, but because of high turnover, it was a struggle just to get employees through basic training. So, in addition to cross-training, owner Hasbrouck made other operational changes to set his team up for success, such as simplifying the menu and smoothing the workload by moving specials from weekends to weekdays. He also made significant investments in his people, increasing full-time pay from $15 an hour to $20 an hour in Maine, plus tips. Higher pay came, however, with higher expectations: Hasbrouck changed the job description to state, “We want employees capable of doing it all.” Adding cross-training made the job worth more to the business and the higher pay made the additional responsibility and higher expectations worth it for employees.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;. . .&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Changes like these don&#39;t happen overnight, but a better system can drive operational excellence and let teams live up to their potential. Food businesses and other service industries are facing headwinds, but cross-training can ensure that they are up for the challenge, providing better service while also improving the lives of their employees and preserving vibrant businesses in their communities.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 22 Sep 2023 20:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Video Quick Take: SAP&rsquo;s Aaron Green on Building the Brightest Talent Pools in the Tightest Labor Market - SPONSOR CONTENT FROM SAP]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/sponsored/2023/09/video-quick-take-saps-aaron-green-on-building-the-brightest-talent-pools-in-the-tightest-labor-market]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;html>; &lt;head>;&lt;/head>; &lt;body>; &lt;p>;&lt;b>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/b>;&lt;/p>; &lt;div>; &lt;div data-props=&quot;{&amp;quot;name&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;6337163366112&amp;quot;}&quot; js-target=&quot;video-player-page&quot;>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>;&lt;/div>; &lt;div>;&lt;/div>; &lt;div>;&lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;span>;Loading... &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;script src=&quot;//players.brightcove.net/2071817190001/default_default/index.min.js&quot;>;&lt;/script>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Julie Devoll&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Welcome to today&#39;s HBR Quick Take. I&#39;m Julie Devoll, editor for special projects and webinars at HBR. Today we&#39;re speaking with Aaron Green, who is the chief marketing and solutions officer at SAP SuccessFactors.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Aaron Green&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hey, Julie. Thanks for having me here.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Julie Devoll&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div id=&quot;DFP_IC_pos3&quot;>; &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;>;if (isAdobeSync()) googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(&quot;DFP_IC_pos3&quot;); });&lt;/script>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;Hi, Aaron. Thank you so much for joining us today. Let&#39;s get started.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Organizations today are facing many challenges, whether it&#39;s shifting market dynamics or labor shortages. How can they set themselves up to succeed in today&#39;s environment, with an eye toward the future? What are some of the roadblocks? And how do they move forward?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Aaron Green&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yeah, absolutely. Julie, I think probably the number one thing or challenge that&#39;s facing organizations today is really around the skills gap itself. And it&#39;s something that all our customers are really concerned about. In fact, skills are the new and future currency of work.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;And what this fundamentally means is we need to rethink the way in which we both retain and attract talent and look for the right skills at the right times in the organization. In a recent survey, more than 75% of business leaders said that hiring and retaining talent is the number one most critical factor for achieving growth. And we know that our people are the most valuable asset that any organization has. And our people are what allow us to innovate, compete, and grow.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So what this means for an organization is that we have to be able to understand the skills that we have today, but also understand the skills that are needed in the future. And build plans to upskill, cross-skill, reskill, and, in some cases, bring in those skills from the outside market. This is really the way that any company, but especially a growth or scale-up company, needs to be thinking about how they look at talent.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Julie Devoll&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So I want to switch a little bit to tools and processes. When an organization commits to using different tools to share insights and intelligence across all its practices, how do employees experience that change?&lt;/p>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div id=&quot;DFP_IC_pos4&quot;>; &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;>;if (isAdobeSync()) googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(&quot;DFP_IC_pos4&quot;); });&lt;/script>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Aaron Green&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yeah. So we know that in order to deliver an extraordinary customer experience or a customer outcome, you really have to have an extraordinary employee experience—an employer and employee value proposition—because when you do this, and when you really focus on your people, your people end up having more meaningful work experiences. And these translate into higher productivity and a better customer experience in whatever industry or geography you&#39;re in.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But this really means that you have to have real-time insights into your total workforce across all worker types, including your contingent labor, because these insights allow you to really unlock the understanding of the skills that your workforce has, their aspirations, their work preferences, and how they&#39;re performing. And it really allows an organization to match that up to the workforce of the future and ensure that your people understand the path to whatever the future growth plans are for the organization.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Julie Devoll&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So I want to look ahead to the future. How do you envision artificial intelligence and automation helping organizations boost these insights and efficiencies in ways they can&#39;t really do right now?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Aaron Green&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yeah. So there&#39;s definitely no question that AI is a super-hot topic at the moment. And we&#39;re really privileged at SAP SuccessFactors, with over 9,600 customers and working with over 250 million unique users every day. And our customers are talking to us about AI all the time. And in fact, in a recent research study that we did, we found that recruiting and learning are two of the highest-priority areas for organizations to think about how they invest in AI to really automate many of the manual tasks that are required today.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But there are emerging use cases, things like chatbots for more complex administrative tasks or HR self-service or ticketing, but also AI to drive some of that internal mobility that we&#39;ve talked about, looking at skills profiles and career paths, and using this to actually match people to opportunities inside the organization, whether they&#39;re short-term roles or gigs or longer-term roles. But fundamentally, what this means is that AI-powered talent intelligence platforms are going to become more critical than ever for all organizations, both for HR and for the broader employee base.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Julie Devoll&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Well, Aaron, this has been a great conversation.

Their unique skills, experiences, and contributions help companies innovate, compete, and grow.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Due to the pace at which technology and innovation are introduced, though, the skills organizations need are constantly changing. In fact, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development estimates that technology will disrupt &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/06/build-a-strong-learning-culture-on-your-team#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20OECD%2C%201.1,do%20new%20types%20of%20work).&quot;>;1.1 billion jobs&lt;/a>; in the next five years—making the skills gap one of the biggest hurdles growth-focused organizations face today.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Addressing those gaps starts with figuring out what skills you need now and in the future and whether you should acquire them by hiring alone or by upskilling, cross-skilling, and reskilling your current employees.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Taking a skills-based approach is how all organizations—especially growth-focused organizations—need to look at talent. But to make this possible, you need technology that&#39;s built for the job. Without it, HR and recruiting teams lack integrated, real-time data frameworks, meaning that they are making decisions based more on gut instinct than on data-driven evidence.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Considering the many challenges growth-focused organizations face today—such as rapidly changing market conditions, the need to keep employees productive and engaged, and the race to attract top talent—having the right HR technology in place to meet the evolving needs of your business and your people can be a game changer.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A connected cloud HR and enterprise resource planning (ERP) approach helps free that data from silos, so all departments can access the same people data in real time. This boosts efficiency and productivity, cuts operational costs and noncompliance risk, improves people&#39;s experiences at work, and helps organizations get people with the needed skills into the right roles.&lt;/p>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div id=&quot;DFP_IC_pos3&quot;>; &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;>;if (isAdobeSync()) googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(&quot;DFP_IC_pos3&quot;); });&lt;/script>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Putting People at the Heart of Your Business Transformation&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Investing in this technology means investing in your people—and people are what drive business transformation. Today, people expect an employee experience (EX) where every interaction is as easy, seamless, and personalized as it is when they go shopping online. By using technology to enhance EX—from automating time-consuming processes to offering personalized learning recommendations—people have more meaningful work experiences, which translates into a more engaged workforce, higher productivity, and better business outcomes.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Companies like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sap.com/uk/asset/dynamic/2022/08/ed4692e7-32d5-49e9-9240-a0a2dc2f8909.html&quot;>;MOD Pizza&lt;/a>;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sap.com/uk/documents/2021/07/cc941e1e-ee7d-0010-bca6-c68f7e60039b.html&quot;>;Growmark&lt;/a>;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sap.com/uk/documents/2021/10/54f5d640-fd7d-0010-bca6-c68f7e60039b.html&quot;>;Sun Communities&lt;/a>; are great examples of how focusing on people by strengthening the connection between HR and business operations can help drive growth.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To eliminate friction in the hiring and onboarding process and enable new hires to become productive faster, the HR team at MOD Pizza determined that it needed to replace siloed people data and manual processes with scalable, cloud-based technology.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Moving to a single cloud platform for both HR and ERP helped MOD Pizza automate the onboarding of 1,000 hires each month and 400 daily event changes related to new hires, promotions, and separations—resulting in 15 fewer hours of manual data entry each week.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The company has also integrated survey touchpoints across the hiring and onboarding experience to gather feedback during this important stage of the employee life cycle. This connected approach is helping MOD Pizza gain efficiencies across the business while improving EX.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The agribusiness cooperative &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sap.com/uk/documents/2021/07/cc941e1e-ee7d-0010-bca6-c68f7e60039b.html&quot;>;Growmark&lt;/a>; manages HR for an internal workforce of 3,600 and provides payroll support for an additional 4,200 employees at its member companies. Streamlining its HR and ERP operations by moving to a cloud-based solution helped Growmark integrate management processes, improve visibility across the business, and automate manual tasks.

This helps its HR staff streamline the management of processes and experiences across recruiting, onboarding, performance management, and payroll—without having to rely on internal IT resources.&lt;/p>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div id=&quot;DFP_IC_pos4&quot;>; &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;>;if (isAdobeSync()) googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(&quot;DFP_IC_pos4&quot;); });&lt;/script>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;Growth-focused organizations like these need to ensure their HR systems, experiences, and strategies are not operating in a disconnected state. The ideal platform brings together the talent, demographic, experience, and operational data an organization needs to inform its HR, finance, supply chain, and customer decisions. With this connectivity, organizations can also replace legacy and inefficient processes with end-to-end automated business processes and improved experiences.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;With real-time insight into your total workforce and an understanding of the resulting impacts on your business, you can unlock new opportunities for both your business and your people. You gain insights into your employees&#39; skills, aspirations, preferences, and performance. This view enables an unprecedented alignment of the needs of your business with the needs, wants, and competencies of your people.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;With the right cloud technology, today&#39;s growth-focused organizations are strengthening the connection of HR across the business and scaling personalized EX across their entire workforce.

The reasons include pressures on OEMs to build more resilient supply chains and to regionalize production and the falling cost and increasing ease of use of new technologies. This article describes six steps that SMEs can take to adopt these technologies.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/how-smaller-manufacturers-can-upgrade-their-tech?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/how-smaller-manufacturers-can-upgrade-their-tech?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;The post-pandemic push to make supply chains more regional and resilient is creating growth opportunities for many of the domestic small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that large original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) rely on. These SMEs survived the waves of offshoring in the 2000s, often because they made lower-volume or costly-to-ship parts for automotive, aerospace, or industrial equipment sectors. But it was challenging for them to invest in new equipment or facilities when there wasn&#39;t much growth. Now some of the growth is coming back, and there is an opportunity for these SMEs to adopt new software and manufacturing innovations, and rethink how to improve the efficiency and productivity of their operations.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Over the last three years we have talked to numerous SMEs, trade associations, and US government-supported &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nist.gov/mep&quot;>;manufacturing extension partnerships (MEPs)&lt;/a>; across the midwestern United States. The MEPs were set up by the National Institute of Standards to help SME manufacturers and are in all 50 states and Puerto Rico. One of us (Ali Shakouri) has also worked extensively with SMEs across the state of Indiana, which at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nam.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/MFG-GSP-FactSheet_201810.pdf&quot;>;28.6%&lt;/a>; has the highest share of gross state product devoted to manufacturing in the country. We have found that these firms are often quite conservative vis-à-vis the adoption of new technologies for several reasons:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;They are reluctant to change existing processes that work and that have served them well for years.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;They have a limited appetite to invest in the face of growing demand or constraints on their production capacity because of continuing cost pressures from their customers and foreign competition.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Or they find digital technologies daunting because of the need to learn new skills or develop new ways of working.&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;This often means they have not kept up with technologies that are altering the competitive landscape. During the offshoring boom in the 2000s, many manufacturers moved much of their high-volume production overseas, and investments in the newest tools and technologies went there as well. This was evident, for example, in the metal castings industry, as new factories, equipped with the latest tools, were set up in low-cost countries. In the investment casting sector, new Chinese and Indian factories got the latest production tools, while US factories were left with older ones. It&#39;s easy to invest in the latest technologies when you are growing; when you are not, it&#39;s easier to stay with what you have.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;That&#39;s the wrong way to look at it now — these are actually moments to invest. Here are six ways to get started.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;1. Leverage new simulation software tools.&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Computer-aided design tools have been with us for decades, and they revolutionized all branches of engineering — the design and analysis of everything from mechanical parts and chemical processes to electronic products and semiconductors. What has been striking, though, has been both the increasing sophistication of these tools as well as the investments software developers have made in making them easier to use and more affordable. Yet adoption among SMEs has been slow.&lt;/p>; &lt;article-promo>; &lt;hbr-component type=&quot;promo&quot; is-insight=&quot;insight-center&quot; title=&quot;The New Age of Operations&quot; dek=&quot;Improving efficiency and increasing resilience.&quot; cta-text=&quot;&quot; href=&quot;/insight-center/the-new-age-of-operations&quot;>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/insight-center/the-new-age-of-operations&quot; style=&quot;color:black;text-decoration:none&quot;>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; Insight Center Collection &lt;/div>; &lt;h3>;The New Age of Operations&lt;/h3>; &lt;div>; Improving efficiency and increasing resilience. &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hbr-component>; &lt;/article-promo>; &lt;p>;Simulation modeling tools can be a shortcut to improving operations. They allow firms to model and understand their process flows better, which can reveal bottlenecks and constraints, leading to new ways to operate. These tools have come a long way over last decade in terms of their ease of use, and many are cloud-based, have simple drag-and-drop interfaces, and provide building blocks that you can incorporate to make models easy to build. More sophisticated packages offer the opportunity to build a digital twin — a lifelike digital model of your operations that includes not only machines and material handling systems but even the people working there.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A great example&amp;nbsp;of a company where simulation tools have made a difference&amp;nbsp;is&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pelcoinc.com/&quot;>;Pelco Products&lt;/a>;, an Edmond, Oklahoma-based manufacturer of traffic and utility products such as streetlights, poles, and pedestrian push buttons. As it grew over the years, its production processes had sprawled and slowed production. To improve them, Steve Parduhn, son of the founder, brought in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.okalliance.com/&quot;>;Oklahoma Manufacturing Alliance&lt;/a>; (OMA), the state&#39;s MEP. Parduhn got help in building a digital simulation model of parts of the production processes using software from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sketchup.com/&quot;>;Sketchup&lt;/a>; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.simio.com/&quot;>;Simio&lt;/a>;. This allowed Pelco to test new scenarios virtually&amp;nbsp;before&amp;nbsp;it started moving equipment around. It was even able to simulate new technologies and equipment before bringing them on site. The increased capacity in the factory led to $1 million in cost savings and $5 million in new sales.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;2. Put data and new analysis technologies to work.&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;SME manufacturers often collect a lot of data from their operations, but most haven&#39;t leveraged new artificial intelligence (AI), including machine learning (ML) tools, to gain fresh insights from the data. This can be intimidating to firms with no prior experience, so the key is to start simple and learn.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Working with Purdue University&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2134667&amp;amp;HistoricalAwards=false&quot;>;AI-Commons team&lt;/a>;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tmfcenter.com/history&quot;>;TMF Center&lt;/a>;, a company in Williamsport, Indiana, installed inexpensive power-consumption sensors to determine usage patterns across its complex parts-machining operations. This helped it start classifying activities and develop real-time dashboards of shop performance. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kirbyrisk.com/mechanical-solutions/&quot;>;Kirby Risk Manufacturing&lt;/a>; in Lafayette, Indiana, is experimenting with sound sensors and ML to detect quality issues during operations, which would allow it to identify and fix problems much more quickly.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Similarly, &lt;a href=&quot;https://primient.com/about&quot;>;Primient&lt;/a>;, a food ingredient company based in Schaumburg, Illinois, was able to work with Purdue to develop a simple ML imaging application for its Lafayette corn-sweetener factory that helped its operators evaluate its production process for the size distribution of sugar crystals, a characteristic that determines how quickly the crystals dissolve in foods and therefore how sweet they taste. The new application provided measurement precision to a process that previous called for operator judgment — one that was prone to human error and wide variability. The ML application laid the groundwork for it to start using its extensive production data to improve yields and operational efficiency as well.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;3. Learn how to implement simple automation.&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;While many SMEs employ some degree of automation, it is often in the form of pre-set packages such as automated tool exchange systems or automated workpiece loaders purchased as part of expensive add-ons to machine tools. There are often many “dirty, dull, and dangerous” jobs that are still done manually, and automating them would not only improve product quality by reducing variability but also improve the jobs of workers by freeing them to do more productive and desirable work elsewhere in the process. But these are intimidating projects for SMEs who don&#39;t have prior experience. Again, the answer is to start with small projects and learn and get help from organizations such as the MEPs.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Kinnee Tilly, a vice president at&amp;nbsp;the Oklahoma Manufacturing Alliance,&amp;nbsp;described how it helped &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/company/rise-manufacturing/about/&quot;>;Rise Manufacturing&lt;/a>;, a company in Broken Arrow, Oklahoma, that provides manufacturing and assembly services to aerospace, defense, and oil and gas customers. Rise had a surge in demand for its products during the pandemic, which led to bottlenecks in its manufacturing process. “They had a manual polishing process, and human variability was creeping in,” Tilly explained. “We had people who had never touched anything like a robot in their lives, who were very wary of it because they felt they were going to be replaced.” OMA lent it a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.automate.org/a3-content/what-are-collaborative-robots&quot;>;collaborative robot&lt;/a>; (“cobot”), a lightweight robotic arm that is simple to program and can safely share a space with workers, to help Rise get the process up and running. The workers saw the benefit. “Once we were done, not only did we not replace the people, we upskilled them [and] got them into a better job,” Tilly said.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;4. Get up to date on advances in production tools and methods.&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;It is important for SMEs to get up to date on the tools and processes that are being used in their industry to speed up production cycles and improve quality. For example, digital casting technology, which encompasses simulation, printed prototypes, printed tooling, and laser metrology, can help lower costs and enable SME metal casters to compete more effectively with offshore production.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;All operations, whether dedicated to production or services, will also benefit from better application of methods taught by Toyota. Almost every MEP teaches lean methods, pull systems, visual workplace concepts, and kaizen methods for process improvement. Yet many SMEs would benefit from a deeper understanding of the underlying concepts and a more conscientious application of these techniques. Toyota&#39;s production system is not static and continues to &lt;a href=&quot;/2022/11/what-really-makes-toyotas-production-system-resilient&quot;>;improve&lt;/a>;, and SMEs would benefit from doing the same.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;5. Leverage assistance programs from universities and outside resources.&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;The MEP programs are designed to help SMEs improve their capabilities and get started on the adoption of new technologies. Purdue, which manages Indiana&#39;s MEP and the state&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://tap.purdue.edu/&quot;>;Technical Assistance Program&lt;/a>;, offers a wide range of training and services in adopting new technologies. It even connects SMEs to university faculty and students for up to 40 hours of assistance per year in a wide range of fields, including advanced process control, materials, failure analysis, sensors use and applications, and engineering analysis.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;States can also provide direct assistance. Since 2020, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iedc.in.gov/&quot;>;Indiana Economic Development Corporation&lt;/a>; (IEDC), working with nonprofit &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.conexusindiana.com/&quot;>;Conexus Indiana&lt;/a>;, has been providing matching &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.conexusindiana.com/drive-industry-success/manufacturing-readiness-grants/&quot;>;manufacturing readiness grants&lt;/a>; to companies seeking to modernize their operations or integrating smart technologies and processes in order to increase capacity and speed and improve quality. SMEs can apply for up to $200,000, which they must match on a dollar-for-dollar basis. &lt;a href=&quot;https://photonautomation.com/&quot;>;Photon Automation&lt;/a>;, a 67-employee SME in Hancock County, Indiana, leveraged a $183,000 grant to employ a new laser welding technology for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.conexusindiana.com/case-study/photon-automation/&quot;>;manufacture of battery products&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;6. Leverage peer relationships.&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Farm cooperatives played a big role in the adoption of agricultural technologies in the early and mid-20&lt;sup>;th&lt;/sup>; century through knowledge sharing. SME manufacturers can similarly benefit from informal networking and sharing of experiences.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One example of such cooperation: The Purdue AI-Commons team has been working with a cohort of SMEs to share best practices to implement &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.computersciencedegreehub.com/faq/what-is-edge-analytics/&quot;>;edge analytics devices&lt;/a>; and benefit from &lt;a href=&quot;https://business.mydatacan.org/&quot;>;privacy-preserving data sharing&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;An Opportune Time&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;This is an opportune time for SME manufacturers to invest in their own transformation. The pressures to build more resilient supply chains and to regionalize production afford domestic manufacturers a rare growth opportunity during which they can update their operations and operating strategies. They should not miss the chance.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 21 Sep 2023 22:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Research: Consumers Choose Shared Experiences Over Quality Ones]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/09/research-consumers-choose-shared-experiences-over-quality-ones]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/09/Sept23_21_1399018466.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;Tara Moore/Getty Images&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;Some consumer experiences are best when they&amp;#8217;re solo &amp;#8212; but new research shows that people will forgo a high-quality experience in order to share it with a partner or loved one. As a result, they may have a worse time, which can lead to unsatisfied consumers, lower sales, and neglected business opportunities. This article explains why people tend to stick together, even when it isn&amp;#8217;t necessarily beneficial, and outlines several ways marketers can encourage people to break apart (even briefly) in order to boost their satisfaction.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/research-consumers-choose-shared-experiences-over-quality-ones?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/research-consumers-choose-shared-experiences-over-quality-ones?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;People&#39;s lives are generally a mix of spending quality time with others and leaving space for time alone. Some experiences seem geared toward togetherness — for example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ama.org/shared-consumption-experiences-2/&quot;>;recent estimates&lt;/a>; suggest that 90% of movie theater visits occur with others — while others are more geared toward solo time, like reading or painting. And while people often make their own decisions about how to spend their time, choices made by companies affect these decisions as well. Explicitly or implicitly, businesses are designed to encourage consumers to be with others or alone — like amusement park rides that have two seats in each row, or restaurants that offer bar seating so people don&#39;t need to sit at a table with an empty chair across from them.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What impact do these decisions have on customer experiences? In particular, what happens when people face a dilemma: choosing between experiencing something next to a friend or partner, even though it may lower the quality, or obtaining a service of higher quality, but doing so apart? Examples of this include deciding whether to select two adjacent seats far from the stage at a concert or two non-adjacent seats in the front row of the venue, or waiting for a longer duration to go on an amusement park ride with the whole family rather than splitting up.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://myscp.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jcpy.1352&quot;>;Our research, recently published in the &lt;em>;Journal of Consumer Psychology&lt;/em>;&lt;/a>;, demonstrates that consumers often choose services of lower quality to be physically close to a companion during an activity. People will select these lower-quality options even in situations that offer little opportunity for interaction (like a yoga class), even when they know they&#39;ll have plenty of togetherness time later (like taking a flight on the way to a long vacation together) — and even when companies specifically tell them that services are designed to be experienced solo.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Consumers so value togetherness that they will choose less-pleasing experiences or even skip high-quality experiences just because they cannot be physically next to someone they care about. This can result in unsatisfied consumers, lower sales, and neglected business opportunities. Luckily, our research has also identified some strategies marketers can implement to encourage consumers to be apart from a companion if needed.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Tradeoffs Between Togetherness and Quality&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;To test the idea that people will choose social over solitary experiences, even when the latter may be more enjoyable, we first analyzed Tripadvisor reviews of the interactive play &lt;em>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g60763-d2631104-Reviews-Sleep_No_More-New_York_City_New_York.html&quot;>;Sleep No More&lt;/a>;&lt;/em>;. This is a unique experience in New York City: people who attend this play walk around several theatrically designed rooms reliving the classic Shakespearean tragedy &lt;em>;Macbeth&lt;/em>;. Importantly, this experience has been &lt;a href=&quot;https://lauraperuchi.nyc/sleep-no-more-the-intriguing-immersive-play-in-new-york-city/&quot;>;optimized for&lt;/a>; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.playbill.com/article/9-tips-for-attending-the-award-winning-sleep-no-more&quot;>;aloneness&lt;/a>;: the creators highlight that audience members should be silent, that people should walk at their own pace, and that staying with one&#39;s partner would create barriers between the audience and the actors.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yet, we observe that some visitors (45 out of the 312 reviews we coded) explicitly ignored these instructions and chose to stay with their companion, even though everyone was informed that they would meet their companion at the bar inside for an after-party discussion. What&#39;s more, visitors who stayed with their companion rated the experience lower on Tripadvisor, about 25% below that of those who went through the experience apart from their companion.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We then conducted a series of experiments in lab and online settings to understand &lt;em>;why&lt;/em>; consumers prioritize togetherness with a partner over the quality of experience, asking people to make choices about chocolate, seats for a show, or spots for a class. For example, in one study that we conducted at the behavioral lab of Mays Business School at Texas A&amp;amp;M University, we asked students to make a choice about how many chocolates they would like to share with another participant: they could either get two chocolates (one per person) and eat them together or they could get four chocolates (two per person) and eat them apart. We found that more people chose the option of eating fewer chocolates with another person when instructed that their companion would be a new friend as opposed to a stranger.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ultimately, and perhaps unsurprisingly, we concluded that people want to remember experiences as shared with people they know, and they believe that physical proximity facilitates the creation of special memories. Many people even recognize that getting an experience of lower quality is in fact less enjoyable even when shared with someone else — and yet they still choose less-pleasing experiences to remember the activity as shared. This can pose a problem: &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0956797614551162?casa_token=1snj7Bf_JVEAAAAA:UeUIT8XJKIkPgakpSoHGTfcdi_IQ4Ugm1F31dIy5BkZBMwM5k-uQ5wuPhSuZSqdoLHeLfO4JS74I6g&quot;>;research&lt;/a>; by Erica J. Boothby and colleagues demonstrates that sharing an experience with someone enhances the enjoyment &lt;em>;only&lt;/em>; if the experience is positive to start off. Their theory suggests that when people share a negative experience (eg, they watch a bad movie together), they will perceive it as even &lt;em>;more&lt;/em>; unpleasant when engaging in the experience with someone else as opposed to alone.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This creates a dilemma for marketers and customer experience managers: many people will explicitly ignore your attempts to activity something solo, which may be fine if they enjoy the product or service. But if they don&#39;t, their reaction will be even more negative because they shared it with someone else.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Making Solo Experiences More Enjoyable&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;If the experiences your company provides would benefit from consumers being solo (at least during a part of the activity), there are a few ways to encourage people to choose higher-quality experiences.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Given consumers&#39; reluctance to experience a perk without their partner enjoying the same perk, offering the same benefits to the companion of a recipient can be a way to increase people&#39;s uptake and satisfaction with any special treatment they are offered. This might look like offering an additional TSA Precheck pass to the spouse of a frequent traveler. However, it is not always possible for companies to treat their customers with free or discounted perks that will improve the overall experience because of monetary or space constraints. For example, an airline might not have two empty adjacent seats in first class. So, how should they communicate a free first-class upgrade to two people traveling together when the seats aren&#39;t next to each other?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In these situations, framing an activity as functional is one way to spur people to be apart during experiences where physical proximity to one&#39;s partner would not necessarily maximize enjoyment. For example, a flight is one of many activities that people will share during a family vacation; thus, framing the flight as a utilitarian activity that serves the purpose of getting people to their final destination can be a way to encourage travelers to break apart to have a better experience. So instead of just saying, “Here&#39;s an upgrade on us!” when treating a couple with two first-class non-adjacent seats, our research suggests the airline should also mention, “Use the time during this flight to rest because your adventure starts the moment you step off the plane.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Finally, businesses could provide guidance for consumers to be together for some parts of an experience but also to indulge their own interests for part of the time. Think of a couple visiting an art museum: partners might perceive it as awkward or inappropriate to suggest that they split up at some point to see different exhibits, even though this would make them happier. However, the museum could suggest paths for parties visiting with a group to “divide and conquer” the museum by exploring different aspects of the collection. When the parties meet back up, they can share photos or descriptions of what they saw — enabling visitors to create special memories together of the experience.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Our research can help marketers minimize complaints from customers whose shared experience is of lower quality by encouraging consumers to take advantage of more pleasant solo experiences — all while keeping some aspects of their social bond intact. These findings are especially relevant for activities where physical proximity does not always maximize enjoyment, like education or self-care. Recognizing that consumers often overvalue togetherness could result in better strategies for your organization and happier customers.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 21 Sep 2023 21:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Why Is It So Hard to Leave a Bad Job?]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/09/why-is-it-so-hard-to-leave-a-bad-job]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/09/Sep23_21_1434151592.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;Anton Vierietin/Getty Images&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;If you&amp;#8217;ve ever been in an unhealthy work situation, you probably know how hard it can be to leave. Leaving a bad job is never easy, and each person&amp;#8217;s breaking point is different, so beating yourself up over why you stayed so long in a traumatic situation won&amp;#8217;t help. But learning from each experience will empower you to own your career choices and leave earlier if you find yourself in a comparable situation again. The author presents five common reasons it&amp;#8217;s hard to leave a bad job and strategies for moving on.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/why-is-it-so-hard-to-leave-a-bad-job?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/why-is-it-so-hard-to-leave-a-bad-job?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;Have you ever been in a bad employment situation but couldn&#39;t bring yourself to leave? Nearly every client tells me about trauma they experienced at work, whether it&#39;s an unsupportive or deliberately cruel manager, a company implementing policies that are unfavorable to employees, continuous layoffs creating stress and anxiety, or politics that left them feeling devalued.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yet they stayed, some for years, even though they knew their work environment wasn&#39;t healthy. Here are five reasons it&#39;s hard to leave a bad job — and what to do about them.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Loyalty to your “work family”&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Working at a company for a long time can create a sense of loyalty to the organization and team members. My client, Beatrice (not her real name), worked for a law firm for more than 15 years and expected to be made a shareholder. But she learned she was rejected from partnership. “The lightbulb went off, and this was never going to be my company. I have given my life to these people, and they didn&#39;t value me that way. I had to decide, did I want to start over and try to become a shareholder somewhere else?” That was the breaking point for her, but even with an offer in hand from another firm where she would be a shareholder, she still struggled to depart. “I felt tremendous guilt leaving my old firm. I celebrated every major holiday with them. Two partners are my kids&#39; godparents. It was like my family.” In the end, Beatrice weighed her loyalty to the firm against the firm&#39;s loyalty to her, which helped her decide to accept another firm&#39;s offer.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;What to do about it&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Recognize that companies hire you to use your skills and capabilities to provide a service. If you&#39;re no longer providing the value the company expects or the company changes its goals and your skills are no longer needed, the company will let you go.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Now, reverse that logic. Look at how you&#39;re serving the company through the lens of what &lt;em>;you &lt;/em>;need to feel fulfilled and valued in your job. Determine if the company is still providing the value to your life that you need and deserve.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some questions to ask yourself include:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;Is the company providing me benefits and development opportunities that will enhance my career and life?&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Are the company&#39;s policies inclusive of my specific needs?&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Is the company recognizing the value I&#39;m bringing with more money, a promotion, partnership, or some other important recognition that matters to me?&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;Every company-employee relationship is about loyalty and commitment on both sides, not just achieving goals and collecting a paycheck.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;A cult-like atmosphere&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;When you join a company, everyone is working toward a common mission or goal. If the company has a righteous mission such as helping people be healthy, successful, happy, or helping to sustain the earth, then employees feel like they&#39;re contributing to the greater good of humanity or the world. Deciding to leave the company can feel selfish or even traitorous, like you&#39;ve “given up” on the collective mission.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Even if the company isn&#39;t making big impacts on people or the world, the inside atmosphere is about collaborating to achieve a goal together. That feeling of being a critical part of a team or feeling “strong” because you can withstand any suffering to achieve the goals becomes addictive and diminishes the damaging aspects of the job.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When I worked as a TV news reporter, when someone left the business to move into PR or another field, everyone talked about them as giving up or not being able to “cut it.” But the person who left knew they were escaping long hours, working weekends and holidays, low pay for extraordinary effort, and stressful daily deadlines. They were seeking more for their life in alignment with their values.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;What to do about it&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;If you&#39;re feeling an intense camaraderie that prevents you from leaving what you know is an unhealthy work environment, take some time to define your what&#39;s important to you and determine whether those values are being fulfilled in the job — separate from the company&#39;s needs.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Here are some questions to ask yourself to make that determination:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;What&#39;s important to me at work, and how do I define what that means?&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Which values are being consistently honored or violated?&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Is there anything I can do to ensure my values are honored?&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;For example, if being respected is a value and you define it as having your ideas heard and considered, but your manager consistently talks over you or ignores your ideas, your value is being violated. Can you discuss with your manager why this value is so important to you and influence it being honored? If not, you&#39;ll need to decide whether the company mission is more important than your values.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Nostalgia for what the company was&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;When you join a company and have a great experience for months or even years, you&#39;re fully engaged in your job. Then change happens, whether that be a new leader, new structure, or a shift in strategic direction, and you may struggle to cope with it.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These kinds of organizational changes can result in feelings of shock, denial, frustration, and depression. If you find yourself struggling to accept and adjust to the changes over time and find yourself saying, “I don&#39;t want to leave because I really love the company” instead of “I don&#39;t want to leave because I love my job,” then you may be stuck in the past, hoping the company will revert to what it once was.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;What to do about it&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Change is hard, so give yourself time to adjust and process what it means for your job. After you&#39;ve accepted the change, take an objective look at whether the present situation still fulfills your values and career goals. If you&#39;re still struggling in your job post-change, consider the following questions:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;What was the company like when I joined, and what is the company reality today?&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;What would make the environment better for me?&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Can I make any additional changes or requests to fulfill the values that are no longer being fulfilled?&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;Companies, teams, and leaders all change — often especially as companies grow. It&#39;s up to you to determine whether you want to live in the present reality or a past that no longer exists.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Equity handcuffs&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Some employees receive equity grants in a company, such as RSUs or stock options. Stock grants vest over a period of time, usually years. Therefore, after suffering a distressing work environment, you may feel even more strongly that you deserve to wait out that vest for what you&#39;ve been through. But how much trauma are you willing to endure? Waiting for equity to vest could be detrimental to your health, so it&#39;s critical to understand whether it&#39;s worth it.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;What to do about it&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Determine exactly when and how much you will receive from each vest at the current stock prices and ask your broker or accountant these questions if you can&#39;t figure out the answers:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;After taxes and option strike price payments, how much will I receive?&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;If I walk away from this money or wait until my stock vest, will this impact my retirement outlook?&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;What net amount would I need to earn in compensation at another company to make up for the unvested stock value?&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;Equity incentives are granted to keep you in the job, and many companies offer additional grants during your tenure through compensation programs. Therefore, there&#39;s never a “final” vesting date. But you can break the never-ending vest cycle if you have an exit date in mind based on how much you want vested before you depart and how much you&#39;re willing to forfeit.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Fear&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;There&#39;s no shortage of things to fear when it comes to making a job change: Fear you&#39;ll jump into another tough situation, that you&#39;ll have to prove yourself all over again, that you won&#39;t be able to make as much money. Fear that you don&#39;t even know how to look for a job. If you&#39;re feeling beaten down from a bad work situation, fear can leave you with little confidence that making a change will lead to a better work environment.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;What to do about it&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;To help you bypass your fears, instead of just dreaming about what your life could look like in a positive work environment, deliberately visualize it. Close your eyes and consider the following when trying to combat negative thoughts and fears:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;If I weren&#39;t scared to leave, what would be possible?&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;What does my new work environment look like, smell like, feel like?&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;What kind of support do I need to feel more confident in making a change?&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;Finally, think about what advice you would give a close friend about a work situation that mirrors your own.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;. . .&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Leaving a bad job is never easy, and each person&#39;s breaking point is different, so beating yourself up over why you stayed so long in a traumatic situation won&#39;t help. But learning from each experience will empower you to own your career choices and leave earlier if you find yourself in a comparable situation again.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 21 Sep 2023 20:25:03 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
