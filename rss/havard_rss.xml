&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt; div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/10/better-ways-to-support-a-colleague-with-breast-cancer?language=es&quot;>;阅读西班牙语&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;

&lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;对于经历过这种情况的职场人士改变生活的诊断结果，大多数人选择告诉他们的团队——根据&lt;/span>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cancerandcareers.org，77% 的癌症患者告诉他们的经理，63% 的人告诉他们的同事/newsfeed/research/posts/2022/10/2022-the-harris-poll-cancer-an&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;2022 年癌症与职业哈里斯民意调查。&lt;/span>;&lt;/ a>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;对于那些选择分享的人来说，浏览这些对话可能很困难。 “这是一个很难的话题，”&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;4 Point Consulting&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;4 Point Consulting 首席执行官兼负责人 Christy Lyons 说道。 &quot;>;，一家&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;按需人力资源和人才咨询公司&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;，专注于她对工作中心理健康的思考。虽然关于管理与任务相关的事情有很多话要说&lt;/span>;&lt;a href=&quot;/2018/01/what-to-do-when-your-employee-is-diagnosed-with-cancer&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;团队中有癌症患者的后勤工作&lt;/span>;&lt;/a>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;，资源不多解决&lt;/span>; &lt;a href=&quot;https://qz.com/working-with-cancer-pledge-to-provide-employee-support-1849994094&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400; &quot;>;心理负担&lt;/span>;&lt;/a>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>; - 具体来说，我们如何帮助减轻癌症患者正在经历的精神痛苦。&lt;/span>;&lt; /p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;癌症很难从任何方面讨论&lt;/span>;&lt;em>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;任何&lt;/span>; &lt;/em>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;当然，这是一种观点，但工作场所有时会模糊地区分“与工作相关”和“与工作无关”的内容，尤其是在工作场所。具有挑战性的场景。为了更好地了解这些情况，我们采访了五位女性，她们在工作中谈论了她们的乳腺癌诊断，她们经历了同事的各种反应。虽然样本量很小，但我们相信，他们的故事共同表明，通过这种经历来支持同事有更好和更坏的方法，并且他们提供了一些有用的策略来帮助面临这种诊断的人。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;不该说的话&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;乳腺癌患者常常被善意但无益的陈词滥调所困扰，尤其是与他们在工作中只是偶然认识的人。根据哈里斯民意调查，21% 的患有癌症的职业成年人遇到“关于他们的癌症诊断的不敏感或冒犯性的评论。”&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot; >;萨布丽娜·埃利松多 (Sabrina Elizondo) 是一家混合媒体制作公司的执行制片人，她在化疗期间的某个时刻，感觉好多了，并发布了一些自己在音乐节上侧手翻的照片。接下来的周一上班时，她的老板评论道：“&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;如果你有精力做侧手翻，我觉得你就有精力承担更多的工作。 ”这一观察感觉就像是一记重击，让埃利松多原本对能够享受一点乐趣的感激之情变成了非人化。 &lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;“她的冷漠让我感觉自己作为一个人很少受到关注和关心，”埃利松多解释道。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt; span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;会计师杰米·帕肯 (Jamie Parcon) 指出，即使是看似来自支持者的评论也可能会产生意想不到的痛苦反响。 “我觉得五分之一的回答是他们认识其他患有乳腺癌的人，”帕肯说。莱昂斯说，她认为这是大多数人的本能反应。 “我们希望将其与我们自己的故事联系起来，”她说。 “每个人都曾遭遇过癌症。”不过，虽然这句话似乎无伤大雅，但帕肯解释道，“知道其他人不得不受苦，这并没有让我感觉更好。”&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font- Weight: 400;&quot;>;其他下意识的反应，比如“你会渡过难关的！”很诱人，但它们也可能疏远正在经历这种危险经历的人——尤其是如果这就是 &lt;/span>;&lt;i>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;全部 &lt;/span>;&lt;/i>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;你这么说，却没有得到有意义的支持。 “我听到的是陈词滥调，然后就沉默了，”娱乐业律师阿奈斯·马西洛 (Anais Masiello) 说。 “支持的话很容易得到，但我非常清楚[我的工作能力下降]已经变得多么沉重，这让我感到孤立。”&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;诸如“你会打败这个”之类的变幻莫测的内容通常也不受欢迎。另外，当您不了解所有细节时，承诺或暗示完全康复是不合适的。 “与‘你已经拿到了！’相比，一条真诚、有用的短信意义重大，”市警察局发言人凯西·利宁 (Casey Liening) 说。这里还有一种隐含的、常常不被重视的情绪在起作用：癌症患者是“战士”，他们将战胜体内的敌人。当然，这不是癌症治疗的原理，这种情绪实际上可能会产生相反的效果，尤其是当事情感觉特别具有挑战性时：“这让我感觉自己很虚弱，不够坚强，”埃利松多说。&lt;/span >;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;要避免的另一个陷阱：避免主动提供建议。 “这不是被要求或需要的，”利宁说。 “当我第一次得知我的治疗不包括手术、化疗或放射时，我一定告诉了工作中的人。这引发了一个谣言，说我选择不接受任何类型的治疗，”她说。同事们分享他们的想法是非常不受欢迎的&lt;/span>;&lt;i>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;非常&lt;/span>;&lt;/i>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>; 。在这种可能危及生命的经历中告诉某人如何感觉、做什么或对他们的健康做出假设既是不必要的，而且毫无疑问是没有帮助的。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;虽然担心同事的工作量及其对您的影响是可以理解的，但这些想法需要退居第二位。他们的福祉和健康必须放在第一位，而不是他们完成工作的能力。 “对于感到压力的同事来说，我也有压力，&lt;/span>;&lt;i>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;加上&lt;/span>;&lt;/i>;&lt;span style =&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;化疗、化疗脑、更年期脑，以及转移性癌症带来的所有担忧和经济压力，”Elizondo 说。 “我很惊讶自己做得这么好，但有时我想提醒我的老板我正在处理&lt;/span>;&lt;i>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;这个&lt;/span>;&lt;i>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>; span>;&lt;/i>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>; 最重要的是，所以他们让我放松了一点。但我也不想要一张怜悯卡或一个“特殊”的叙述。这是一把双刃剑。”&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;支持患有乳腺癌的同事的更好方法&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;最重要的事情？ “跟随他们的领导，”莱昂斯说。有些人愿意敞开心扉，有些人则不愿意。对于一些人来说，他们的工作生活可能为他们提供了远离癌症现实生活的避风港，他们可能不想谈论癌症及其带来的一切——如果是这样，请尊重这一点。 （哈里斯民意调查发现，40% 的受访者表示，他们继续工作是为了感觉“尽可能正常”。）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;也就是说，我们要求采访的女性分享她们实际感受到的例子&lt;/span>;&lt;i>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;感受&lt;/span>;&lt;/i>;&lt;span style =&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>; 在工作中提供支持，帮助指导您的行动。帕肯讲述了一位同事寄给她的一张卡片。 “里面写着‘我很抱歉这件事发生在你身上。’”这很简单，是的，但“这些话就像一股新鲜空气，”她说。 “我最终从其他人那里得到的是同理心，而不是同情。”当这些词感觉具体而不是笼统时，马谢洛同样很欣赏。马谢洛说，真诚的关怀之词看起来像是“你的力量是鼓舞人心的，我只是希望你不必这么坚强”，或者注意到她接受治疗的那天早上说“再来一次！” “所有这些小动作都意义重大，”她说。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;远离迂腐的陈词滥调，而是对同事的关注确切的情况表明理解并传达关怀。 “一位同事对我说过的让我永远不会忘记的一件事是‘第四阶段并不是死刑，’”Liening 说。 “这意味着更多一点，因为有时确实感觉就是这样。微妙地提醒人们保持积极态度总是很有启发性的。”虽然这些情绪和更一般的反应之间的界限对于那些自己没有经历过癌症的人来说可能并不明显，但它们之间存在数量级的差异。在列宁的例子中，评论者既知道也记得有关她的诊断的具体信息，并且在支持和有毒阳性之间保持着微妙的界限：没有热情洋溢的承诺，只有在事实和个人经历中的深思熟虑。然而，值得一提的是，并不是每个人都想要&lt;/span>;&lt;i>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;想要&lt;/span>;&lt;/i>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>; ”>; 积极性。有时，只是重申“这太糟糕了”就令人振奋。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;Parcon 也喜欢同事签到，因为这让她不必自愿更新。马谢洛的同事们纷纷采取行动，这是另一种具体的帮助方式：“有同事简单地处理事情，而我不必担心，这是最有帮助的事情。他们不希望我在治疗或手术期间担心我的工作。我让同事告诉我我错过的任何电话或会议，这样我就不会感觉自己被排除在外，”她说。 “我被鼓励尽可能多地抽出时间，并且知道在我不在的时候总会有人为我提供帮助。同事们先发制人地介入，代表我处理事情，并认真检查我的表现。”Masiello 说。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-体重：400；&quot;>;莱昂斯表示，这对于创建支持性文化大有帮助——你越积极主动，癌症患者的负担就越轻。毕竟，“如果我能做点什么，请告诉我”有多少次会遭到沉默？当涉及到工作量和与工作相关的任务时，只需&lt;/span>;&lt;i>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;做&lt;/span>;&lt;/i>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400 ;&quot;>;有事，别问。图书馆主管杰西卡·赛德纳 (Jessica Sidener) 表示，她的同事们做的最出乎意料的周到的事情之一就是协助她确定任务的优先顺序。 “当我做得太多时，我的同事们会友善而明确地让我知道，并帮助我确定待办事项、义务和责任的优先顺序，尤其是当我感到不知所措而无法独自处理它们时，”她解释道。 “对于那些确实有紧迫感的任务，他们想出了如何介入。”&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;这种感觉社区也可以提供安慰。 “我的同事们的总体态度是&lt;/span>;&lt;i>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;我们&lt;/span>;&lt;/i>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;会渡过难关，而&lt;/span>;&lt;i>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;你&lt;/span>;&lt;/i>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;会渡过难关这个，”西德纳说。当她的同事为她举办筹款活动并说“没有人孤军奋战”时，列宁也感受到了这种团结感。她说：“这最令人惊奇地提醒我，我的支持系统有多么庞大。”&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;重要的是请记住，您的同事可能面临的恐惧不一定有时间范围，因此支持也不应该有时间范围。虽然您的同事可能会结束治疗，宣布病情缓解，并看似康复，但“治疗后会出现挑战，”莱昂斯说。那些已经战胜癌症、现在从技术上讲已经“站在癌症的另一边”的人将面临复发的恐惧，面临长达数年的日常药物治疗及其副作用，以及与肿瘤科医生的后续预约，可能会与身体的全面恢复作斗争。疤痕，并可能会经历令人衰弱的疲惫。&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;乳腺癌通常并不快速或简单。它不会用弓绑起来。人们在未来的几年里都要应对后遗症。持续的检查所带来的同情心——“你感觉怎么样？”或“对你来说，生存是什么样的？” ——可能是无价的。 &lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;&lt;br>; &lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;&lt;br>; &lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font -weight: 400;&quot;>;最后，值得注意的是，遵循此建议并不能保证不会犯错或发表令您患有癌症的同事感到受伤的评论。而且您可能并不总是知道您的想法、评论或行动何时或是否以这种方式被接受。但这并不是停止出现或避开同事的理由——消失的行为可能是最痛苦的。谦逊、愿意接受纠正以及不断努力让你的同事感到被关心是你最大的资产——好好利用它们。 “能够保持开放，并且[这种开放]遇到爱确实很有帮助，”马西洛说。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>; Buechel 认识到与团队成员沟通、解决他们的担忧并向他们保证公司文化、质量标准和核心价值观在他的领导下保持完好的重要性。他强调了真实性和忠于自己的必要性，同时也支持公司的愿景和方向。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;对于我们视频系列“工作新世界”的这一集，《哈佛商业评论》主编 Adi Ignatius 坐下来与 Buechel 讨论：&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;真实性对于领导力和可持续发展工作至关重要，因为公司需要确保其行为符合其核心价值观和使命&lt;/li>;

&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;JASON BUECHEL：&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我的幸运之一就是与约翰一起工作[麦基]历时九年，大约有 11 个月的时间来完成我们的过渡。这对我来说是一个很好的机会能够融入这个角色。我得到了约翰的大力支持，他真的希望我在这 11 个月的时间里帮助承担其中的一些职责。当我正式担任这个角色时，我已经做好了准备。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;对于我们的团队成员来说，担任这样的角色也是一个非常困难的过程。约翰担任我们的首席执行官 42 年，最终这就是他们所知道的。对我来说，与我们的团队成员联系非常重要，确保我们能够提供愿景，并确保他们了解全食超市的要素、我们的文化、我们的核心价值观和我们的更高目标。它们将保持完整，我的工作就是帮助承担这些责任并支持我们能够保持全食超市和重要元素的完整。&lt;/p>; &lt;hbr-component type=&quot;newsletter&quot;

&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;JASON BUECHEL：&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;了解团队成员的声音非常重要。他们在这个转变中寻找什么以及什么对他们来说是重要的？对我来说，我利用这 11 个月的机会做了一次我们称之为“整体对话之旅”的活动，这让我对团队成员的想法有了一些深刻的见解。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在某些情况下，他们您是否担心约翰退休后我们的文化或质量标准是否会发生重大变化？未来的情况会怎样？对于我们的利益相关者来说，无论是供应商还是客户、社区合作伙伴，我认为在进行过渡时了解所有这些利益相关者的声音非常重要。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我认为我要给出的另一部分建议是确保你不只是想成为那个领导者。对我来说，约翰和我，我们以非常不同的方式领导，这就是为什么我们在合作中如此互补。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这也是关于做真实的自己，同时确保你的支持公司及其需要走向何方。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS：&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;您的首席执行官之路并不典型。也许没有人是这样，但尤其是你的不是。谈谈你的过去、你的生活和职业生涯以及它是如何最终担任这个角色的？&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;JASON BUECHEL：&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我有工作机会自 2000 年以来，我一直从事零售业。我的第一套经验实际上来自于咨询。我在埃森哲工作，有机会与美国和世界各地的许多领先零售商和杂货商合作。这就是我在零售领域工作的热情。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这份职业让我与 Whole Foods Market 的几位高管建立了联系，其中包括我们的前联合首席执行官 Walter Robb 和首席财务官 Glenda Flanagan。当他们正在寻找新的首席信息官或首席技术官时，他们联系了我。我提供了一些我认为适合这份工作的客户的名字，他们回过来说：“你为什么不把你的名字写上？我们非常希望您考虑加入全食超市。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我来到奥斯汀，在这里呆了两天，并且非常欣赏这样一个事实：更高的目标和核心价值观是&#39;不仅仅是墙上的文字。他们日复一日地过着日子。这让我意识到，这是我工作并度过余下职业生涯的正确地方。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当我加入 Whole Foods 时，我负责技术以及我们的数字业务。帮助我们建立我们尚未推出的送货和取货业务。在那段时间里，我还帮助我们寻找方法来建立一些我们以前没有的组织和支持实践，就像我们的第一个运营支持团队一样。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;随着我在全食超市度过了更多的时间，我选择了在团队成员服务（其他公司称之为人力资源）等领域承担额外的职责，并最终于 2019 年 1 月担任首席运营官。经历这一角色确实帮助我为下一步迈向成功做好了准备。首席执行官职位。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS：&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在那之前我就在想你的过去。当我第一次与你们的员工联系时，他们说：“他是一个奶酪人。你必须明白这一点。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;JASON BUECHEL：&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当然。我与食物有着很长的渊源，从七岁起我就开始园艺。我父亲实际上是一名奶酪制造商。我的父母都是在奶牛场长大的。我当时在威斯康星州农村，与我们的粮食系统有着有趣的联系，很高兴今天有机会担任我可以帮助影响和支持我们子孙后代的粮食系统的角色。&lt;/p>; &lt; p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS：&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;全食超市向亚马逊巨头报告意味着什么？&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;JASON BUECHEL： &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我们在很多方面都非常荣幸。首先，也是最重要的，在过去六年中，我们真正兴奋的一件事是，我们真正关注全食超市的长期发展，并且能够得到亚马逊的支持，为我们提供能力，使我们能够我们以最令人惊奇的方式为我们的客户提供服务。无论是通过技术还是其他服务，能够帮助创造出色的客户体验是亚马逊提供帮助的事情之一。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;此外，我们正在帮助重新定义杂货店的面貌。这个空间。拥有一家拥有资源和专业知识的母公司，我们可以利用这些资源和专业知识来支持全食超市，这非常重要。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我也很欣赏同样的事情，我们能够成为全食超市并保持我们的文化。我之前提到过，我们仍然有同样的更高目标和核心价值观。虽然我们是亚马逊的一部分，但这实际上是一种互补的关系，我们提供我们所能提供的最好的产品，并且我们能够插入并利用亚马逊内部最好的产品。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>; ADI IGNATIUS：&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我认为我们与我们喜欢的品牌有情感联系。您对那些热爱 Whole Foods 品牌及其品牌承诺，但对亚马逊没有同样感情的人们有什么想说的？&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;JASON BUECHEL：&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;在某些情况下，它可以帮助这些客户了解他们可以使用的一些好处，亚马逊也可以为他们提供支持。无论是使用 Amazon One 在我们的一家商店提供更快的结账服务，还是最终的一些支持和工作，我们都在共同寻找帮助实现我们的环境和可持续发展承诺的方法。&lt;/p >; &lt;p>;这是我们很多客户关心的事情，也是我们作为 Whole Foods 能够利用的事情，并支持我们围绕环境的核心价值。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS：&lt;/strong>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;您认为全食超市面临的最大挑战是什么？仅仅是为了尽快增长、增加新店吗？或者你会以其他方式思考这个问题吗？&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;JASON BUECHEL：&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这实际上是在弄清楚我们如何扩大我们的影响力和影响力。显然，我们要做到这一点的方法之一就是增加新商店，但同时也在寻找为客户提供服务的新方法。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我们今年早些时候推出的产品之一是能够直接购买商品。通过亚马逊运送到客户家中。目前，我们的独家品牌拥有超过 800 种产品，以我们的 365 品牌为例。我们可以通过新的方式为更多客户提供服务。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我们也非常关注如何帮助支持我们滋养地球上人类的更高目标。这不仅仅是为了增长而增长，而是我们如何帮助成为变革的力量？&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我真正热衷的事情之一是再生农业。这是一个机会，最终将使我们能够利用我们今天所了解和喜爱的产品，并确保我们能够继续为子孙后代生产这些产品。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS：&lt;/strong >;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;对于不熟悉再生产品或农业概念的人来说，这意味着什么？&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;JASON BUECHEL：&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p >; &lt;p>;在这个领域，我认为很多消费者不明白我们目前的表土继续失去生产我们所了解和喜爱的产品所需的营养。再生不仅是帮助将这些养分带回土壤，而且是以可持续的方式提供帮助。确保我们能够继续支持我们的土壤和更广泛的生物环境，不仅继续生产我们今天所了解和喜爱的产品，而且最终创建一个不会像我们今天所看到的那样具有破坏性的生态系统。我们如何确保我们能够与供应商合作，以便他们能够支持这些做法并成为这些做法的倡导者？&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我真正感到自豪的一件事是我们已经推出了三项regenerative products under our own exclusive brands to help take that leadership position. One of my personal favorites is our green lentils under our Whole Foods Market brand, a great product. And it&#39;s one of the very first certified regenerative products from a private label perspective on the market.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Your strategy, if I understand it, seems essentially still to be primarily a brick and mortar one. Do you feel the need to become more of an e-tailer going forward?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;JASON BUECHEL:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The reality is we are an e-tailer today. Whether you are having products delivered to your house, you&#39;re picking them up in one of our stores, you&#39;re getting some of our exclusive brand products like our 365 products shipped directly to your home: we&#39;re already playing in that space. I continue to see that we&#39;ll have opportunities both in the physical experience as well as online.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A lot of our customers like to shop through multiple different channels. In some cases they&#39;d like to have center of store picked for them and ready for them to pick it up when they shop the store, and then look at our perimeter, whether it&#39;s picking out their own meat or seafood or interacting with our team members. As an example, at our cheese case, a certified cheese professional can help choose exactly the right cheeses as you&#39;re putting together your cheeseboard and charcuterie plates.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So fast-forward, not way into the future, but a year or two or three. How do you think the in-store experience will change for Whole Foods customers?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;JASON BUECHEL:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We&#39;re going to continue to find ways to help simplify and make things easier for our customers. One of the things our customers find value in is our ability to help save them time. In some cases, as I mentioned earlier, delivery and pickup help support that. We want to be able to find ways that customers can find products in the store faster. How can we better provide the expertise across all the different areas within our stores so customers can make sure we&#39;re supporting the amazing events and dinners they&#39;re helping prepare for their family and loved ones, and ultimately, checking out faster in our stores?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There&#39;s a lot of things we&#39;re making investments on where technology will support things, and investments into our team-member experience, to make sure that our team members can best serve our customers and help save them time.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I want to go to an audience question. This is from Holly who&#39;s in Boston. Do you have any recommendations for how companies can best develop an internal leader to be the next CEO, including maybe external development programs?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;JASON BUECHEL:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One of the things I&#39;m really, really proud of is the investment we put into our team member experience and focus around internal growth and development. We had over 11,000 promotions over the last 12 months, which I&#39;m so proud of.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, when I look at my executive team, two of my direct reports actually started in our stores part-time. Our head of operations, Bill Jordan, as an example, joined through Mrs. Gooch&#39;s [Natural Food Markets], which was one of our acquisitions. He&#39;s worked across almost every part of our stores, multiple regions, and now leads operations reporting directly to me for all of Whole Foods Market.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We&#39;re making big investments into career development programs. We do this for our major leadership positions within the organization. Just yesterday, I was actually doing the keynote graduation ceremony for our store team leader career development program which is focused on a six-month period, helping make sure our team members are ready to take that next step up.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For our most senior leadership positions, we&#39;ve helped cross-pollinate and have leaders work across multiple different parts of the company. That was something I was privileged to be part of, being able to lead multiple different functions before stepping into this role.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One of the other things that&#39;s really unique for us is both for our executive team and something we call WFLN, which is the Whole Foods Market Leadership Network, built of our 19 most senior leaders. We collectively work together across all different facets. Folks are helping participate in work in parts of the company they may not lead. For us, it&#39;s really making sure we&#39;re working together as a team and helping make sure we&#39;re bringing some of those experiences and expertise across our entire leadership team.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I&#39;m also really proud of the fact that 50% of the group I just mentioned grew up in our stores, and so that expertise of knowing Whole Foods and being able to build a career in a functional area is something we&#39;re really proud of.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Let&#39;s shift gears a little bit. This is another audience question, from Punjab, Pakistan, and it&#39;s about hybrid work. How do you manage the fact that your frontline workers need to be there full-time in the stores, versus white collar workers who are able to work hybrid? How do you balance that?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;JASON BUECHEL:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We&#39;ve done a return to office where our store support team members are required to be in the office three days a week, but ultimately many of them also have to spend time in our stores or in our facilities, helping connect with team members.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One of the things that&#39;s been an important part of our vision is something I call store-centricity, in making sure that every single one of our store support team members has a connection to our stores. We ultimately have included it in something we call our job-dialogue process, which is part of our performance management process, on setting the expectation, and ultimately having team members talk about the things they&#39;ve done over the course of the last 12 months to connect with our stores, and what those experiences have taught them.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We&#39;ve also built some programs around our senior leadership and other leaders that we have within our store support group, and actually pairing them with stores and partnering up with our store team leaders, and finding ways that we can better support our stores, and ultimately making sure that we can bring those experiences where our store support team members really understand everything that&#39;s happening day-to-day in a store, what it takes to lead a store, and how do we help improve our team member and customer experiences in the work that we do.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To build on that, you used the phrase before, the theater of retail. I love that term. When you think about Whole Foods, the Whole Foods experience, what is your theater of retail?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;JASON BUECHEL:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For so many of our customers, they&#39;re coming to Whole Foods as an oasis, to get out of the hectic day-to-day life, you know? One of my favorite examples of that is our Manhattan West store, located in Hudson Yards in Manhattan, and you get off the busy street and you walk in the store, and it&#39;s just an immediate sense of Zen. For me, we want to be able to create this oasis for customers, bring the theater of retail.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We want our customers to have sensory overloads in the experiences they have, as they&#39;re walking into produce, the smells that they&#39;re having, the beautiful merchandising that they&#39;re seeing, the demos of products that we&#39;re doing in the store. We can be at our very best when we&#39;re helping bring this theater to life for our customers, because it&#39;s one of the reasons they&#39;re coming to our stores.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We have a question from Reno, Nevada in the US. How does Whole Foods think about the phenomenon of food deserts. You aren&#39;t everywhere. You&#39;re in markets that can sustain it. How do you think about the food desert issue, at least in the US, and whether there&#39;s anything you can do to alleviate that.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;JASON BUECHEL:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is one of the areas we&#39;ve actually made investments in and have tried to find ways to support those who might be underserved or don&#39;t have access to some of the highest quality products we sell at Whole Foods Market. We have an entire foundation that we call &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wholecitiesfoundation.org/about/&quot;>;Whole Cities&lt;/a>;, which has been dedicated to some of these efforts, in not only having us establish stores, but ultimately investing in communities through a lot of different programs that can help bring access to food in these underserved communities.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Here&#39;s a question from London in the UK. Having followed a very dynamic, well-profiled CEO, how do you think about the role of the CEO? Does it need to be a very public-facing role, or not necessarily?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;JASON BUECHEL:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It really depends upon the company. You know, are you public or private? In our case, we are a subsidiary, and for me, the most important role that I have is internal from that perspective. Obviously, having responsibilities external allows us to support our stakeholders as well, so when I look at the time that I spend, it&#39;s probably 80% on the internal side of things, and in the 20% I&#39;m spending external, it&#39;s really trying to help connect with and support our stakeholders.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I give a great example on this with our suppliers. How do we help bring a voice into other organizations, folks within government, around some of the work that we need to do to help support our farmers and our suppliers and ranchers?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It&#39;s figuring out that right balance, but the responsibility I personally have is serving as our internal leader, and making sure that our team members understand the vision that we have as an organization. I&#39;m spending time directly in our stores, connecting with our team members, making sure that they understand where we are going, and making sure we can get feedback. My job is to be a servant leader in serving our stores. One of the things I really have tried to do is set the tone across the entire organization of us being store-centric.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When we launched our new vision, growing with purpose, in January, one of the commitments we made is that every single one of our stores is being visited by a member of our executive team. There&#39;s eight of us, so for our 535+ stores, we&#39;re spending a lot of time on this road show this year, connecting with our team members, making sure they understand where we&#39;re going and getting their feedback of what they&#39;re seeing. It&#39;s helping us improve and elevate many of the priorities and initiatives we&#39;re doing across the organization.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I don&#39;t think we&#39;ve been through a show this year without talking about generative AI. We have a question from Tampa, Florida, which is just how do you think about AI and how it can, or maybe already is, changing the grocery shopping experience?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;JASON BUECHEL:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It&#39;s going to fundamentally change retail and grocery over the course of the next 10 years. To go into one of your earlier questions, this is one of the great things about being a subsidiary of Amazon as well, and being able to leverage capabilities on this side.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When I think about how we work, things are going to change. You know, the role of a merchant, which is very much at the center of retail in how you select product, decisions that you&#39;re going to be making around assortment, and pricing, and merchandising. We&#39;re going to have additional insights and toolsets that AI is going to really influence.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I think about all of the different, amazing things that this is going to provide for customers as well, whether it&#39;s helping build out a shopping list, to helping select products that you&#39;re going to bring together for an amazing meal or experience that you&#39;re preparing for, to helping provide discovery. I think there&#39;s going to be so many different applications in how this is going to make things easier, better, and more impactful for our customers, and at the same time, allowing us to raise the bar on how we look at things like assortment and all of the key things that we do in bringing the experiences to our customers.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;You&#39;ve talked a couple times about sustainability, and I know that&#39;s a big priority for you. How does a company go from wanting generally to do the right thing in terms of climate change, in terms of sustainability, to really making it fundamental?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;JASON BUECHEL:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First and foremost, it&#39;s important to be authentic. For us, within our core values, the environment has always played a role. The work that we&#39;ve done in supporting the organic movement is an example, which has been the leading climate-friendly agricultural practice over the last several decades. It&#39;s always been part and parcel around how we can make sure that this is authentically connected to the work we&#39;re doing. For us it&#39;s easy, because it ties to our higher purpose of nourishing people on the planet.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When it comes down to doing things just for the sake of hitting metrics and goals, when you&#39;re not thinking about how this ties to why you&#39;re doing it, I think you have to take a step back and really understand, “How does this actually connect to the company&#39;s vision, and the mission, and the goals that we&#39;re trying to do?” If it&#39;s not authentically there, understand the changes that you need to make within the organization to make sure that it is. That would be my top piece of advice.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Here&#39;s a question from Ontario, Canada, about retention: what strategies has the company implemented to retain employees?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;JASON BUECHEL:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One of the top things is providing growth opportunities for our team members. I mentioned a little bit earlier we had 11,000 promotions over the last 12 months. One of the things that&#39;s important about doing that is providing ways by which we can help support our team members&#39; growth and happiness.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One area I&#39;m excited about is an apprentice program. We currently have three live, a Butcher Apprentice program, a Certified Cheese Professional, and a Bakery Decorator Apprentice. We&#39;re going to be rolling this out so each one of our departments and teams has an apprentice program going forward. This allows team members to develop skills and trades they can use at Whole Foods Market and elsewhere in their life.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It&#39;s not only great for the team member, but it&#39;s great for our customers: our customers are actually coming to Whole Foods Market for the great expertise and experience we can provide. By having things like this in place, it makes sure that our team members are supported in taking those next steps for growth within the company.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I mentioned a little bit earlier the career development programs we do. We do this throughout our entire organization, so we&#39;ve got programs from multiple levels within our store, around store leadership as an example. Team members not only see their current next-step opportunities, but they see the growth and support they&#39;re going to have at future levels as well.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One other area that I&#39;m proud of is something called Cultivate. It&#39;s a mentoring program that we have in place, and this is very unique to Whole Foods Market. Most other retailers might offer this type of program for their store team leader or store leadership. We open up all this for our team members so they have opportunities to connect with other folks to get supporting, coaching, mentoring experiences.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I have a great example of connecting the two where we have a team member, Marie in Hawaii, who&#39;s connected with a mentor who&#39;s in Boston, and the experience that she&#39;s able to have virtually in a wonderful way to learn things that allow her not only to grow, but bring new experiences into her store. Examples like that have team members not only connected to Whole Foods, but knowing that they&#39;re supported for an entire career they can have with us.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We&#39;re almost out of time, but I want to ask the cliche question you probably get all the time. When I interviewed Howard Schultz when he was CEO of Starbucks, I had to ask, what does he order when he walks up to the barista. So when you shop Whole Foods, what&#39;s in your basket? What are some of your favorites?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;JASON BUECHEL:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Well, every shop is a little bit different depending upon what I&#39;m preparing for. When I&#39;m going through produce, I&#39;m always picking up bananas, blueberries, avocado. At our seafood counter, I&#39;m looking at whatever&#39;s coming fresh. I love our salmon. It&#39;s one of my favorite products. In meat, it&#39;s the ribeye. In cheese, I&#39;m looking to see what artisan cheeses we have in place. Current favorites right now are Uplands and Jasper Hill as far as producers. The Harbison is actually one of my personal favorites. In our prepared foods, I hit the salad bar almost daily for lunch. And in center store, I&#39;m always trying to check out whatever store I&#39;m in, what are the local products? Local is a really important part of Whole Foods Market, so I love discovering new local favorites in whatever store I&#39;m at.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I assume your certified cheese professional gets a little nervous when you walk up and ask what they&#39;ve got?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;JASON BUECHEL:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Not at all, because they know that I&#39;m excited about a great conversation we&#39;re going to have on some of their favorites. And usually it involves tasting a few samples as well, so always a great experience.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;All right, well Jason, I want to thank you for being on the show. It&#39;s really great to hear your thoughts, and thank you for being here.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;JASON BUECHEL:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Thanks for having me.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 30 Sep 2023 02:55:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[The Next Supply-Chain Challenge Isn&rsquo;t a Shortage &mdash; It&rsquo;s Inventory Glut]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/09/the-next-supply-chain-challenge-isnt-a-shortage-its-inventory-glut]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/09/Sep23_29_594832575.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;Halfdark/Getty Images&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;Inventory challenges aren&amp;#8217;t new. Electronics littered shelves in 2001 after the dot-com bubble burst. In 2009, the financial crash left manufacturers with excess inventory when consumer buying power suddenly dropped. And now, the high-tech industry is feeling the weight of a volatile market that has led to excess component inventory. Measuring inventory momentum can help leaders address the problem. It&amp;#8217;sa forward-looking metric based on the classic momentum equation: current inventory x rate of inventory change.&amp;#160;Once leaders understand their inventory momentum, they can take actions to reduce excess inventory, stem the rate of inventory change, and prevent the situation from happening in the future.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/the-next-supply-chain-challenge-isnt-a-shortage-its-inventory-glut?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/the-next-supply-chain-challenge-isnt-a-shortage-its-inventory-glut?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;It&#39;s March 2020. Store shelves sit empty, without any toilet paper or cleaning supplies in sight. Tablets and electronic devices are out of stock. Consumers are clamoring for the basics they need to suddenly work and learn from home and live under quarantine. Meanwhile, on Zoom calls and in email threads, company leaders around the world are racing to put in giant orders with their suppliers to speed up supply-chain lags and get products to customers. In the supply-and-demand equation, demand seems infinite.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Now, three-plus years later, we&#39;re seeing the stark aftereffects of that spike in demand. After the race to order key components and manufacture products, suppliers are left with mountains of excess inventory as growth has slowed to normal levels. In the tech industry, it&#39;s common for warehouses to be &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/28/how-the-world-went-from-a-semiconductor-shortage-to-a-major-glut.html&quot;>;full of now-outdated semiconductors&lt;/a>; and other technology components. When those components were ordered, they were in hot demand. Now, companies are dispositioning excess electronic components (selling them at lower prices, scrapping them, using them in alternate products, and trying to sell them back to suppliers) to get them off their balance sheets.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Beyond the obvious environmental cost, an inventory glut of high-end electronics components is an expensive problem. Excess inventory is a $250+ billion problem in the US alone, according to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kearney.com/industry/technology/article/-/insights/how-can-high-tech-companies-digest-250-billion-in-inventory&quot;>;2023 Kearney study&lt;/a>;. On a global scale, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.census.gov/mtis/www/data/pdf/mtis_current.pdf&quot;>;US census data&lt;/a>; shows excess inventory amounts to trillions of dollars. Someone pays for all that extra inventory.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;And this problem isn&#39;t a pandemic-era anomaly. New demand spikes are coming our way — you only have to consider the seemingly “infinite” demand for electric vehicle batteries or the boom of chipsets that drive AI-powered technology to see how similar cycles could play out in the near future.&lt;/p>; &lt;article-promo>; &lt;hbr-component type=&quot;promo&quot; is-insight=&quot;insight-center&quot; title=&quot;The New Age of Operations&quot; dek=&quot;Improving efficiency and increasing resilience.&quot; cta-text=&quot;&quot; href=&quot;/insight-center/the-new-age-of-operations&quot;>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/insight-center/the-new-age-of-operations&quot; style=&quot;color:black;text-decoration:none&quot;>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; Insight Center Collection &lt;/div>; &lt;h3>;The New Age of Operations&lt;/h3>; &lt;div>; Improving efficiency and increasing resilience. &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hbr-component>; &lt;/article-promo>; &lt;p>;As we look ahead at a new age of operations, leaders have the opportunity to address the current inventory problem and be stewards of a healthy, sustainable industry ecosystem. Players in every part of the value chain (from component suppliers to manufacturers) have a key role in preventing this kind of waste in the future. We see the opportunity for forward-thinking leaders to blaze a trail, modeling a more sustainable way of collaborating for shared success.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;How Inventory Gluts Occur&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Inventory challenges aren&#39;t new. Electronics littered shelves in 2001 after the dot-com bubble burst. Then, in 2009, the financial crash left manufacturers with excess inventory when consumer buying power suddenly dropped. And now, the high-tech industry is feeling the weight of a volatile market that has led to excess component inventory.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Excess inventory can happen at any part of the supply chain. Here&#39;s a hypothetical example: As cloud computing booms, a company selling servers (also known as an original equipment manufacturer or OEM) gets a giant order for server equipment. The OEM, in turn, sends an order to their contract manufacturer for this server. (“We need as many as you can make!”) The contract manufacturer starts sourcing all of the parts they need to make those servers, including two kinds of semiconductors (we&#39;ll call them “A” and “B” semiconductors). The contract manufacturer searches high and low for those semiconductors; getting the parts could take a year. Once all the parts are finally in hand, surprise! The original order has changed. The technology has advanced, and the demand has shifted. Now those same servers use “B” and “C” semiconductors. The contract manufacturer is stuck with warehouses full of the outdated semiconductors “A” and excess quantities of “B,” creating a very expensive and very wasteful problem.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The key problem is in the original order. Demand is never actually “infinite” or fully predictable given technology changes. Every manufacturer must creatively collaborate with their customers to understand realistic demand for what they will manufacture. There&#39;s also an opportunity for suppliers, manufacturers, and distributors to creatively work together to return components that do not get used and get them in the hands of someone who needs them.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;How One Manufacturer Is Turning the Tide on Excess Inventory&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Let&#39;s look at how one contract manufacturer we have worked with is managing the problem of excess inventory. The manufacturer&#39;s excess inventory was steadily inching toward unsustainable levels, while external factors like increasing interest rates created an intractable problem.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Company leaders started applying the concept of “Inventory Momentum,” a forward-looking metric based on the classic momentum equation: current inventory x rate of inventory change. In other words, having a large inventory isn&#39;t a problem. But when the inventory rate increases, the combined momentum creates a major headache. And when you&#39;re talking about billions of dollars in electronic components that have an expiration date driven by technology transitions, the headache is expensive.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Once they understood their inventory momentum, the leadership team took five key actions to reduce excess inventory, stem the rate of inventory change, and prevent the situation from happening in the future:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;They reduced incoming materials.&lt;/strong>; Instead of ordering all components in advance, the company only ordered the components needed to make finished goods in the short term. The procurement teams delayed orders for components that would not be immediately used in manufacturing.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;They set more accurate planning parameters.&lt;/strong>; Investing in real-time systems provided stakeholders with information on how much inventory they had across all factories and suppliers&#39; books. This data allowed the company to simulate changes to inventory levels when planning parameters like lead time, safety stock levels, and minimum order quantities.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;They disposed of excess and obsolete inventory. &lt;/strong>;The company collaborated with suppliers and distributors to find alternative customers for stranded components.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;They collaborated with their customers. &lt;/strong>;Leaders worked out agreements with customers that if orders changed, the company wouldn&#39;t get stuck with excess components — and arranged working capital advances to get paid in advance for critical materials. Customers could optimize their consumption of excess components by modifying product lifecycles or working with suppliers to design alternative applications.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;They prioritized revenue for customers. &lt;/strong>;By prioritizing customers with a backlog of large orders, they maximized customer revenues by building the mix of products where components were already on hand.&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;The results: The company reduced the total inventory number by more than 10% in just a few short weeks and reduced inventory momentum.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Creating a More Sustainable Inventory Ecosystem&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;This real-world example isn&#39;t an outlier — it&#39;s the canary in the coal mine. The liability of excess inventory affects every business in the value chain. To create a more sustainable environment, every business needs to start thinking differently about the burden of excess inventory.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To start, leaders must reconsider the narrative of “infinite” demand. Every demand spike will eventually end in an inventory glut. It&#39;s up to the companies placing orders to temper that demand with a dose of reality.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If suppliers maximize revenues and OEMs order more than what they can reasonably sell, contract manufactures get stuck in the middle. That dynamic isn&#39;t healthy or sustainable. Value chain partners like OEMs, contract manufacturers, and suppliers need to be aligned on optimizing inventory. Suppliers should be able to redistribute excess components that are still perfectly useful for another application. Getting products into the hands of people who need them is ultimately good for everyone.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Finally, as new industries emerge, prioritize creating healthy ecosystems from the start. The growing realm of AI represents a major opportunity for high-tech manufacturers — but it&#39;s also an opportunity to build a healthy ecosystem. To do so, we can&#39;t assume an “infinite” demand for AI-powered applications. The same is true of the electric vehicle industry. If the ecosystem over-produces parts for EVs, there&#39;s a high risk those parts will be outdated or unusable by the time demand eventually materializes.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Inventory management is a critical problem that should be on the radar of anyone in an industry with volatile demand and long lead times. And it requires a careful, collective solution. No single company stands alone. Instead, we&#39;d all be well served to consider the broader business ecosystem, making decisions that will serve our bottom lines and the health of all the companies connected to us.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;em>;Acknowledgments: The author would like to thank Ben T.

But that&amp;#8217;s not the only reason they struggle during downturns, according to new research &amp;#8212; they also have a tougher time hiring. That&amp;#8217;s because job seekers prefer safer options and so are more likely to apply for jobs at incumbent firms. This, alongside the difficulty fundraising, makes growth even tougher for startups during recessions.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/research-in-recessions-employees-avoid-jobs-with-startups?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/research-in-recessions-employees-avoid-jobs-with-startups?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;Startups are an important catalyst for innovation and economic growth. Yet these important firms are also more sensitive to economic fluctuations than their more established counterparts. While the vulnerability of startups to economic downturns has been &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w21776/w21776.pdf&quot;>;well documented&lt;/a>;, the reason for this vulnerability is not entirely understood.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Conventional wisdom suggests that startups are vulnerable to recessions&amp;nbsp;because they struggle to secure financing during such times. However, the Covid-19 downturn upended this narrative. Venture capital funding &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ey.com/en_us/growth/venture-capital-continues-to-exhibit-immunity-to-the-covid-19-pandemic#:~:text=The%20numbers%20we%20are%20seeing,over%20the%20past%20four%20years.&quot;>;surged in 2020 and 2021&lt;/a>;, contrary to expectations. That raises the possibility that funding isn&#39;t the only factor that makes recessions so hard for startups.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We sought to shed new light on how employees choose between startups and established firms, which are increasingly competing for the same talent. Understanding employee preferences and how they change with economic conditions is critical to understanding incumbent-vs.-new-entrant dynamics. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=59035&quot;>;Our research&lt;/a>; offers an alternative hypothesis rooted in the labor market: Startups find it challenging to attract talent during downturns due to job seekers&#39; inclination toward larger, more established firms.&lt;strong>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Testing this hypothesis is tricky. If startups hire less during a downturn, is that because workers are reluctant to join them, or because startups are reluctant to add workers to their payrolls?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To specifically detect changes in workers&#39; interest in startups, we partnered with AngelList Talent, the leading job-recruitment platform for entrepreneurial firms. Through this partnership, we were able to look at changes in job search and application behaviors during the most recent recession: the Covid downturn. Our findings reveal a “flight to safety” among job seekers. During the downturn, they increasingly directed their searches and applications to larger, more established organizations. Notably, higher-quality candidates, measured by experience or education, were particularly inclined to shift away from startups.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This shift had a tangible impact on firms. Less-established startups received fewer job applications, particularly from high-quality candidates, leading to a decline in the talent pool available to them. This decline happened even within the same job vacancy over time. That means it&#39;s not just that startups demand less labor during recessions — even for existing job postings, hiring got harder. While startups faced challenges in filling their job vacancies, more established firms benefited from this shift in job seeker interest, experiencing greater success in attracting talent.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What drives the flight to safety by workers? There are two possible explanations. First, workers may become more risk-averse across the board during recessions, amplifying their desire for job security. Second, workers could change their view of how risky different employers are. Our findings point more toward the former, because both growing, successful startups and less-successful ones saw a decline in applicants. That&#39;s more consistent with an across-the-board decline in risk tolerance, rather than a reassessment of how risky specific employers are. (Because if that were the case, the struggling startups would presumably take a bigger hit than the more successful ones.) Thus, our results are more consistent with the idea that increased risk-aversion drives job seekers away from all startups — regardless of their quality.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One might question whether these findings are applicable beyond the unique circumstances of the Covid downturn, which may have been more extreme than other downturns. However, we show that the magnitude of the decline in economic expectations during that time period aligns closely with declines observed in past recessions. Moreover, we conducted rigorous tests to rule out Covid-specific factors that might explain our results, such as a shift in job-seeker preferences toward employers who could offer remote work or strict health protocols.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It has long been recognized that startups grapple with financial constraints during periods of economic turbulence. The Covid recession was unusual in that most recessions lead to less venture capital funding, not more. Our research adds a new dimension to this understanding by highlighting that human capital — another vital resource for startups — also comes under significant strain during downturns, leading to a “double whammy.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Historically, policy interventions have been primarily geared toward alleviating financial pressures on startups but have ignored the talent crunch they face. This talent crunch poses a considerable risk, potentially undermining a startup&#39;s ability to survive and compete against larger, established firms. As we navigate through economic uncertainties, a more nuanced understanding of these forces is essential for both policymakers and entrepreneurs.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 29 Sep 2023 22:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Creating a Cohesive Team for Corporate Transformation Projects]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/09/creating-a-cohesive-team-for-corporate-transformation-projects]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/09/Sep23_29_2509341.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;Juan Moyano/Getty Images&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;Hollywood films have long been made by teams of independent contractors and employees of different production companies brought together for short-term projects. Companies have embraced this model for transformations, with data showing that 45% of the people on these projects are not regular employees. Managing a disparate group like this can be a challenge, but team leaders can overcome that by working to create one culture, making work personal, and empowering the team leader.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/creating-a-cohesive-team-for-corporate-transformation-projects?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/creating-a-cohesive-team-for-corporate-transformation-projects?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;The screenwriters&#39; strike that began last May, and the actors&#39; strike that followed in July, highlighted an employment model that has given Hollywood a highly flexible workforce for decades: The vast majority of people on a set are not studio employees but independent contractors or employees of other firms. Take, for example, the people who worked on this year&#39;s Oscar winner for best picture, &lt;em>;Everything Everywhere All at Once.&lt;/em>; In addition to the 42 actors; the 49 artists, set dressers, and painters; and the hundreds more who provided art, music, transportation, writing and editing, costumes, casting, sound, and stunts, the rest of the crew came from six production companies, three special-effects firms, and 28 other organizations.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This model has begun to extend far beyond Hollywood. Our research shows, for example, that in early 2020, on average, employees made up only 62% of the teams responsible for transformation initiatives at 404 global technology, financial services, health care, and life sciences companies with at least $1 billion in revenue. The rest came from staffing or consulting firms or were independent contractors. By the fall of 2022, with nearly three years of the pandemic having put companies into transformation overdrive, those numbers were 55% employees and 45% non-employees.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Judging from a study of 1,005 companies we did in the spring of 2023, we predict that the average number of employees on corporate transformation teams will fall below 50% by 2030, for four reasons:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;By using outsiders, companies can acquire key skills on demand and escape hefty severance costs down the road.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;They can tap the pool of freelance talent that grows with every mass layoff and forced retirement.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Many of these hires can work from home, which creates a global talent market.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;And companies can avoid employee burnout — a big issue today.&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;The Pandemic and Project Overload&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Over the past three years, the Covid-19 pandemic has propelled mission-critical corporate transformations, such as reorienting supply chains suffering from acute component shortages, installing new financial systems to track revenue and expenses faster and more accurately, and restructuring business processes for data cleanliness. The resulting pressure on full-time employees — and sometimes the absence of key knowledge internally — forced companies to hire outsiders with valuable and hard-to-find skills. “E-commerce, digital data security, data privacy—those are all new for us,” the comptroller for the Asia-Pacific region of a US-based luxury goods company told our researchers. “Local statutory requirements are getting more complex, as well as countries&#39; political issues. No one organization will know it all.” And large global companies that are running dozens of initiatives at once may have too few internal project leaders to go around.&lt;/p>; &lt;article-promo>; &lt;hbr-component type=&quot;promo&quot; is-insight=&quot;insight-center&quot; title=&quot;The Future of Work&quot; dek=&quot;Will your company adapt or be left behind?&quot; cta-text=&quot;&quot; href=&quot;/insight-center/the-future-of-work&quot;>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/insight-center/the-future-of-work&quot; style=&quot;color:black;text-decoration:none&quot;>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; Insight Center Collection &lt;/div>; &lt;h3>;The Future of Work&lt;/h3>; &lt;div>; Will your company adapt or be left behind? &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hbr-component>; &lt;/article-promo>; &lt;p>;Successfully staffing and running transformation initiatives with the right mix of insiders and outsiders requires what we call a “dynamic workforce model.” Unlike a static model, which assigns only employees to a critical project team or outsources the work altogether, the dynamic version puts insiders and outsiders on an equal footing. Our study found that the best executors of these initiatives, which were 15% of the 404 companies surveyed, were far more likely to use a dynamic workforce model than the worst executors (24% of the survey base). The best executors&#39; companies also substantially outperformed the worst executors financially, with an 63% average increase in market capitalization between 2017 and the fall of 2022, compared with an average 24% decline for the worst companies.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But this model also presents steep challenges, including creating a cohesive team culture, building trust among people who don&#39;t know one another, and empowering leaders to keep things on track. Project sponsors and project leaders must address those challenges to succeed.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Creating a One-Culture Team&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;When a company fields its own team to run a big transformation initiative, or brings in a consulting firm to execute it, everyone on the team is well versed in the organization&#39;s values and beliefs, the behaviors that are permissible, and who are the powerful internal “players.” But if the team includes outsiders, they are like tourists in a strange land. They can&#39;t be expected to understand the full context of the initiative the way insiders do, no matter how well they&#39;ve been briefed. A thorough onboarding — one that informs team members of both the project mechanics and the company culture as well as project steps, roles, deliverables, and tools — will convey the values, beliefs, and behaviors of the company.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The gene therapy firm Asklepios BioPharmaceutical Inc. (AskBio) gets this. Acquired by Bayer in 2020, AskBio has a number of promising therapeutics in development, including for Parkinson&#39;s disease and congestive heart failure. “It&#39;s super important to create a unified team culture,” said Guru Ramamurthy, chief financial offer at the 800-employee firm based in Research Triangle Park, NC, and CFO of Bayer&#39;s US business. Tapping contractors and consultants has been an important component of rapidly scaling up its infrastructure and capabilities. “Maintaining momentum is critical to execution,” Ramamurthy says, especially since the Bayer buyout. But during a time of rapid growth and change, hiring employees to fill key team roles can be time-intensive and may prove unsuccessful. It can take about three months to discover that a new employee isn&#39;t a good fit, and retraining a replacement can take from six to nine months. Meanwhile, demands and focus may change, altering role requirements. Supplementing with outside experts offers greater operational flexibility and agility.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since the pandemic began, anywhere from 15% to 30% of AskBio&#39;s project team members have been external, depending on the initiative. “A key area of success is how well we blend our employees with the experts we get from various vendors,” Ramamurthy says. He believes that contractors and consultants, particularly those who work remotely, must be treated as equally valued team members. AskBio provides them with access to information and company tools to enable communication across blended teams.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Once an AskBio initiative has been completed, external team members often ask about company job openings. When Ramamurthy hears this, he knows they didn&#39;t feel like outsiders on their teams. “This is the kind of project experience you want to give every contributor,” he says.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Making the Work Personal, Not Transactional&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;On a team composed of employees from one company, the members have a chance to know one another personally — their lives outside the job, their passions, their families, their ups and down at work. But outsiders on a team don&#39;t have that experience. And as more people are hired from outside a company, insiders may detach emotionally from the work, especially if they are involved in several critical initiatives. “It&#39;s easy to see people just as numbers or resources,” a chemical company&#39;s chief strategy officer explained.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Remote team members have an even harder time establishing strong personal relationships. A finance executive at a multibillion-dollar medical-products manufacturer told us how difficult it was to manage remote team members — especially when they aren&#39;t employees, but even when they come from other business units. “We find trust, understanding, and engagement are sometimes missing with them,” he said.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Building trust among transformation team members is crucial to success. Consider, for example, a project manager who must promise anonymity to a team member who points out a mistake that needs correcting. “You have to empower people to speak up,” the finance executive said. And strong commitment to the well-being of a hard-to-replace team member may be necessary to pull that person through a bad patch in the life of a transformation initiative. The executive told us that his company&#39;s project leaders are encouraged to make personal visits when relationships with team members appear strained.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;An Asia-Pacific regional comptroller watched her Shanghai team members get caught in pandemic lockdowns after 2020. Several times she arranged grocery deliveries to their homes and access to mental and physical health resources. “You can&#39;t expect the usual high performance under those conditions,” she told our researchers. Project leaders must use empathy in such cases to motivate teams. The company&#39;s projects — of which she was juggling 19 — have been long, making it hard to keep team members motivated and focused. Awarding bonuses and other recognition for good work has helped, she said.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Empowering the Project Leader&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Among the companies we studied, the best at executing critical transformations had better project leaders than the worst and were more likely to give those leaders the authority to decide what skills were needed on their team and who had them. Some 85% allowed those leaders to replace team members when necessary, whether from inside or outside, whereas only 70% of the worst gave project managers the same authority.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The medical-products company executive told us that empowering project managers increases the chances that they&#39;ll stay with the organization. “Having strong project leaders gives an organization a large competitive advantage,” he said. “There are always projects to be done. If you don&#39;t have a strong project capability, you cannot keep up with your peers.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At a time when companies must move faster to stay competitive, bringing in outsiders for key roles in transformation initiatives has become a reality. But insiders and outsiders must be managed as one effective, cohesive, motivated, and collegial team. Movie producers and directors know how to do this. Companies in industries that are a long way from Hollywood must follow suit.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 29 Sep 2023 21:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Eliminating Algorithmic Bias Is Just the Beginning of Equitable AI]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/09/eliminating-algorithmic-bias-is-just-the-beginning-of-equitable-ai]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/09/Sep23_29_n4KewLKFOZw.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;HBR Staff/Imansyah Muhamad Putera/Unsplash&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;When it comes to artificial intelligence and inequality, algorithmic bias rightly receives a lot of attention. But it&amp;#8217;s just one way that AI can lead to inequitable outcomes. To truly create equitable AI, we need to consider three forces through which it might make society more or less equal: technological forces, supply-side forces, and demand-side forces. The last of these is particularly underemphasized. The use of AI in a product can change how much customers value it &amp;#8212; for example, patients who put less stock in an algorithmic diagnosis &amp;#8212; which in turn can affect how that product is used and how those working alongside it are compensated.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/eliminating-algorithmic-bias-is-just-the-beginning-of-equitable-ai?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/eliminating-algorithmic-bias-is-just-the-beginning-of-equitable-ai?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;From automating mundane tasks to pioneering breakthroughs in healthcare, artificial intelligence is revolutionizing the way we live and work, promising immense potential for productivity gains and innovation. Yet, it has become increasingly apparent that the promises of AI aren&#39;t distributed equally — it risks exacerbating social and economic disparities, particularly across demographic characteristics such as race.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Business and government leaders are being called on to ensure the benefits of AI-driven advancements are accessible to all. Yet it seems that for each passing day there is some new way in which AI creates inequality, resulting in a reactive patchwork of solutions — or often no response at all. If we want to effectively address AI-driven inequality, we will need a proactive, holistic approach.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If policymakers and business leaders hope to make AI more equitable, they should start by recognizing three forces through which AI can increase inequality. We recommend a straightforward, macro-level framework that encompasses these three forces but centers the intricate &lt;em>;social mechanisms&lt;/em>; through which AI creates and perpetuates inequality. This framework boasts dual benefits. First, its versatility ensures applicability across diverse contexts, from manufacturing to healthcare to art. Second, it illuminates the often-overlooked, interdependent ways AI alters demand for goods and services, a significant pathway by which AI propagates inequality.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Our framework consists of three interdependent forces through which AI creates inequality: technological forces, supply-side forces, and demand-side forces.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Technological forces: Algorithmic bias&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Algorithmic bias occurs when algorithms make decisions that systematically disadvantage certain groups of people. It can have disastrous consequences when applied to key areas such as healthcare, criminal justice, and credit scoring. Scientists investigating a widely used healthcare algorithm &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aax2342&quot;>;found that it severely underestimated the needs of Black patients&lt;/a>;, leading to significantly less care. This is not just unfair, but profoundly harmful. Algorithmic bias often occurs because certain populations are underrepresented in the data used to train AI algorithms or because pre-existing societal prejudices are baked into the data itself.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;While minimizing algorithmic bias is an important piece of the puzzle, unfortunately it is not sufficient for ensuring equitable outcomes. Complex social processes and market forces lurk beneath the surface, giving rise to a landscape of winners and losers that cannot be explained by algorithmic bias alone. To fully understand this uneven landscape, we need to understand how AI shapes the supply and demand for goods and services in ways that perpetuate and even create inequality.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Supply-side forces: Automation and augmentation&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;AI often lowers the costs of supplying certain goods and services by automating and augmenting human labor. As research by economists like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/pandp.20181019&quot;>;Erik Brynjolfsson&lt;/a>; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://openai.com/research/gpts-are-gpts&quot;>;Daniel Rock&lt;/a>; reveals, some jobs are more likely to be automated or augmented by AI than others. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.brookings.edu/articles/race-and-jobs-at-risk-of-being-automated-in-the-age-of-covid-19/&quot;>;telling analysis&lt;/a>; by the Brookings Institution found that “Black and Hispanic workers … are over-represented in jobs with a high risk of being eliminated or significantly changed by automation.” This isn&#39;t because the algorithms involved are biased, but because some jobs consist of tasks that are easier (or more financially lucrative) to automate such that investment in AI is a strategic advantage. But because people of color are often concentrated in those very jobs, automation and augmentation of work through AI and digital transformations more broadly has the potential to create inequality along demographic lines.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Demand-side forces: Audience (e)valuations&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;The integration of AI in professions, products, or services can affect how people value them. In short, AI alters demand-side dynamics, too.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Suppose you discover your doctor uses AI tools for diagnosis or treatment. Would that influence your decision to see them? If so, you are not alone. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2023/02/22/60-of-americans-would-be-uncomfortable-with-provider-relying-on-ai-in-their-own-health-care/&quot;>;recent poll&lt;/a>; found that 60% of US adults would be uncomfortable with their healthcare provider relying on AI to treat and diagnose diseases. In economic terms, they may have lower demand for services that incorporate AI.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Why AI-augmentation can lower demand&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Our recent research sheds light on why AI-augmentation can lower demand for a variety of goods and services. We found that people often perceive the value and expertise of professionals to be lower when they advertise AI-augmented services. This penalty for AI-augmentation occurred for services as diverse as coding, graphic design, and copyediting.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, we also found that people are divided in their perceptions of AI-augmented labor. In the survey we conducted, 41% of respondents were what we call “AI Alarmists” — people who expressed reservations and concerns about AI&#39;s role in the workplace. Meanwhile, 31% were “AI Advocates,” who wholeheartedly champion the integration of AI in the labor force. The remaining 28% were “AI Agnostics,” those who sit on the fence, recognizing both potential benefits and pitfalls. This diversity of views underlines the absence of a clear, unified mental model on the value of AI-augmented labor. While these results are based on a relatively small online survey, and do not capture how all of society views AI, they do point to distinct differences between individuals&#39; social (e)valuations of the uses &lt;em>;and&lt;/em>; users of AI. and how this informs their demand for goods and services — which is at the heart of what we plan to explore in further studies.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;How demand-side factors perpetuate inequality&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Despite its significance, this perspective — how audiences perceive and value AI-augmented labor — is often glossed over in the broader dialogue about AI and inequality. This demand-side analysis is an important part of understanding the winners and losers of AI, and how it can perpetuate inequality.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;That&#39;s especially true in cases where peoples&#39; perceived value of AI intersects with bias against marginalized groups. For example, the expertise of professionals from dominant groups is typically assumed, while equally qualified professionals from traditionally marginalized groups often face skepticism about their expertise. In the example above, people are skeptical of doctors&#39; relying on AI — but that distrust may not play out in the same ways across professionals with varying backgrounds. Doctors from marginalized backgrounds, who already face skepticism from patients, are likely to bear the brunt of this loss of confidence caused by AI.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;While efforts are already underway to address &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ajl.org/library/research&quot;>;algorithmic bias&lt;/a>; as well as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://workofthefuture.mit.edu/research-post/artificial-intelligence-and-the-future-of-work/&quot;>;effects of automation and augmentation&lt;/a>;, it is less clear how to address audience&#39;s biased valuations of historically disadvantaged groups. But there&#39;s hope.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Aligning social and market forces for an equitable AI future&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;To truly foster an equitable AI future, we must recognize, understand, and address all three forces. These forces, while distinct, are tightly intertwined, and fluctuations in one reverberate throughout the others.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To see how this plays out, consider a scenario where a doctor refrains from using AI tools to avoid alienating patients, even if the technology improves healthcare delivery. This reluctance not only affects the doctor and their practice but deprives their patients of AI&#39;s potential advantages such as early detection during cancer screenings. And if this doctor serves diverse communities this might also result in exacerbating the underrepresentation of those communities and their health factors in AI training datasets. Consequently, the AI tools become less attuned to the specific needs of these communities, perpetuating a cycle of disparity. In this way, a detrimental feedback loop can take shape.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The metaphor of a tripod is apt: a deficiency in just one leg directly impacts the stability of the entire structure, which impacts the ability to adjust angles and perspectives, and inevitably its value to its users.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To prevent the negative feedback loop described above, we would do well to look to frameworks that enable us to develop mental models of AI-augmented labor that promote equitable gains. For example, platforms that provide AI-generated products and services need to educate buyers on AI-augmentation and the unique skills required for working effectively with AI tools. One essential component is to emphasize that AI augments, rather than supplants, human expertise.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Though rectifying algorithmic biases and mitigating the effects of automation are indispensable, they are not enough. To usher in an era where the adoption of AI acts as a lifting &lt;em>;and&lt;/em>; equalizing force, collaboration between stakeholders will be key. Industries, governments, and scholars must come together through thought partnerships and leadership to forge new strategies that prioritize human-centric and equitable gains from AI. Embracing such initiatives will ensure a smoother, more inclusive, and stable transition into our AI-augmented future.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 29 Sep 2023 20:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Video Quick Take: SAP&rsquo;s David Hamilton on Disruption, Growth, and the Role of Technology in Midsize Companies - SPONSOR CONTENT FROM SAP]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/sponsored/2023/09/video-quick-take-saps-david-hamilton-on-disruption-growth-and-the-role-of-technology-in-midsize-companies]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;html>; &lt;head>;&lt;/head>; &lt;body>; &lt;p>;&lt;b>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/b>;&lt;/p>; &lt;div>; &lt;div data-props=&quot;{&amp;quot;name&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;6337163374112&amp;quot;}&quot; js-target=&quot;video-player-page&quot;>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>;&lt;/div>; &lt;div>;&lt;/div>; &lt;div>;&lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;span>;Loading... &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;script src=&quot;//players.brightcove.net/2071817190001/default_default/index.min.js&quot;>;&lt;/script>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Todd Pruzan, HBR&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Welcome to the HBR Video Quick Take. I&#39;m Todd Pruzan, senior editor for research and special projects at Harvard Business Review. Over the last few years, midsize companies have made huge leaps in adopting technology to survive, enabling their employees to work remotely, switching to online stores, improving supply chain visibility, and offering online learning.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Today, we&#39;re talking about that with David Hamilton, senior vice president and chief marketing officer at SAP Concur and chief marketing and solutions officer at SAP Midmarket. David, thanks for being with us.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;David Hamilton, SAP&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Thank you for having me.&lt;/p>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div id=&quot;DFP_IC_pos3&quot;>; &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;>;if (isAdobeSync()) googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(&quot;DFP_IC_pos3&quot;); });&lt;/script>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Todd Pruzan, HBR&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;David, how did technology play a role for companies to survive all these recent disruptions?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;David Hamilton, SAP&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It&#39;s been really tough. These have been challenging times. IDC Research, commissioned by SAP, showed midsize companies that have completed or [are] in advanced stages of digital transformation were much more successful in continuing to drive growth in revenue and market share. And they were able to positively navigate the pandemic.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These leaders have adopted technologies that may have seemed available only to large enterprises in the past. For instance, one example is, of those leading companies, 92% of them have adopted or plan to adopt an ERP system.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Todd Pruzan, HBR&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ninety-two percent—that&#39;s pretty impressive. David, as you said, many of these technologies only seemed appropriate for the big guys in the past. So what&#39;s changed?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;David Hamilton, SAP&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div id=&quot;DFP_IC_pos4&quot;>; &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;>;if (isAdobeSync()) googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(&quot;DFP_IC_pos4&quot;); });&lt;/script>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;It is really interesting. I think what we&#39;ve seen is this democratization for these midsize companies. And it&#39;s the ability to consume technology through the cloud that&#39;s at the heart of that because the cloud allows companies of all sizes to adopt advanced tech functionality without having to invest in servers or expand their IT departments.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For instance, companies can benefit from technology with embedded AI and machine learning without having to be experts. It&#39;s a real-time value-add, since software continually gets more intelligent. Also, companies that have higher adoption of cloud technology, because it&#39;s pushed directly to employees, can immediately use it.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Todd Pruzan, HBR&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Well, that makes sense. David, how does technology support growth?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;David Hamilton, SAP&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Well, technology supports growth in many different ways. It can provide connections across the business. It can help automate repetitive tasks, which helps teams to be more efficient, freeing them to focus on projects that drive business value. Technology can provide increased visibility across the business and give you scale to align with company growth. Technology could also help with flexibility and agility. You can seize opportunities in new markets without having to worry about compliance, or respond to new customer demands and innovative products, and deal with supply chain disruptions more quickly. It is at the core of growth opportunities for companies of all sizes.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Todd Pruzan, HBR&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;OK, so what do you recommend midsize companies do to take the next step to be ready for growth?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;David Hamilton, SAP&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first thing I really recommend is companies do an internal review of their biggest pain points. Perhaps it&#39;s the ability to manage employees remotely or improve supply chain diversification—it could be many different things—and based on this, make the right technology decisions to support these pain points.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For instance, one of the first things to consider is likely a core ERP solution that can serve as the foundation for growth and help address a number of pain points. An ERP solution can give visibility across the business, reducing the data needed to make decisions, automate processes, and reduce costs.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Todd Pruzan, HBR&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;OK, well, that&#39;s a great overview. David, thank you so much for a great conversation, for all of your insights today.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;David Hamilton, SAP&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Thank you so much for having me.&lt;/p>; &lt;hr>; &lt;p>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ad.doubleclick.net/ddm/trackclk/N69702.124507HBRHARVARDBUSINESSR/B29173838.376677450;dc_trk_aid=567330240;dc_trk_cid=189409904;dc_lat=;dc_rdid=;tag_for_child_directed_treatment=;tfua=;ltd=;dc_tdv=1&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Learn more.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/a>;&lt;/p>; &lt;hr>; &lt;p>;&lt;em>;&lt;strong>;David Hamilton is the senior vice president and chief marketing officer at SAP Concur and chief marketing and solutions officer at SAP Midmarket.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>; &lt;/body>; &lt;/html>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 29 Sep 2023 04:25:01 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[How to Be a Better Leader Amid Volatility, Uncertainty, Complexity, and Ambiguity]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/09/how-to-be-a-better-leader-amid-volatility-uncertainty-complexity-and-ambiguity]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/09/Sep23_28_sb10063113cd-001.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;ColorBlind Images/Getty Images&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;More than three decades ago, the US Army War College developed a framework for understanding how leaders succeed during times of volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity. The framework, known as VUCA, has been widely discussed and adopted since, but it turns out to be better at describing &lt;em>;what&lt;/em>; successful leaders do than teaching all leaders &lt;em>;how&lt;/em>; to succeed. The authors present an updated approach that has generated positive outcomes in military, business, and sports contexts.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/how-to-be-a-better-leader-amid-volatility-uncertainty-complexity-and-ambiguity?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/how-to-be-a-better-leader-amid-volatility-uncertainty-complexity-and-ambiguity?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;Your environment is changing fast. You lack the data to make confident decisions. Your operations sprawl with processes. You&#39;re spotting trends that could be good — or not.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These are the four challenges of volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity. They&#39;re the reality of business today. But they&#39;re &lt;a href=&quot;/1992/11/is-management-still-a-science&quot;>;not new. &lt;/a>;They&#39;re intrinsic to markets, sales, manufacturing — and life in general. So why do some organizations respond better? How do they succeed when others struggle or even surrender?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the late 1980s, after the fall of the Soviet Union triggered a spike in global instability, the US Army War College set out to find answers. They developed the concept of VUCA, an acronym for volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity. And they determined that leaders who did best in VUCA had the capacity to create and communicate a story of the future, a story broad enough to adapt to changing circumstance, yet accurate enough to &lt;a href=&quot;https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/beyond-forecasting-creating-new-strategic-narratives&quot;>;yield competitive advantage&lt;/a>;. They called this skill “vision.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the wake of the 2008 global financial crisis, &lt;em>;Harvard Business Review&lt;/em>; published &lt;a href=&quot;/2010/11/leading-in-a-vuca-environment&quot;>;a four-part series&lt;/a>; on VUCA that detailed the core characteristics of visionary leadership: flexibility, collaboration, foresight, active listening, clear communication. Since then, the War College&#39;s theory has become a standard resource for modern business in times of uncertain change.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But in the 2010s Army researchers inventoried VUCA and discovered that the War College&#39;s theory was better at describing leaders than at producing them. It explained &lt;em>;what&lt;/em>; good leaders did in VUCA, but didn&#39;t explain &lt;em>;how&lt;/em>; to cultivate those behaviors in less successful leaders.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To fill that gap, we (the authors of this article) returned to VUCA. Two of us have decades of experience training military commanders and frontline leaders; the third is an expert in the brain science of creating and communicating plans and other narratives. Working with US Army Special Operations, we developed a suite of new techniques for training the brain to initiate effective plans and strategies in murky and fast-changing environments. We tested these techniques outside the Army in professional sports (such as the NFL) and in business (from Fortune 15s such as Cardinal Health to billion-dollar tech firms such as Faire). And we synthesized our findings into a method that the US Army has formally recognized with a Commendation Medal for “groundbreaking research.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Here&#39;s that method, starting with what psychologists refer to as a mindset shift.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Decision-Making Doesn&#39;t Always Improve with More Data&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;When life is stable and transparent, more data leads to better decisions. But when life turns choppy or murky, data gets fragile and elusive. More data is not an option — and to seek it produces passivity, mission creep, and hesitation.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The key to intelligent leadership in VUCA is low-data decision making. Low-data decision making is impossible for computers, which is why volatility causes AI to become brittle and prone to catastrophic error. But low-data decision making is an inherent power of the brain, which evolved to thrive in unpredictable environments.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To activate that power, target “exceptional information.” Exceptional information is an exception to an existing rule. It&#39;s the initial sign of an emergent threat or opportunity, like when the mainframe engineer Steve Wozniak saw the Altair 8800 microcomputer at the first meeting of the Homebrew Computer Club on March 5, 1975. Other mainframe engineers dismissed the Altair as too small to be useful. But in the Altair&#39;s unusual smallness, Wozniak glimpsed a new story of the future: a world where computers were used to work and play games at home. He dashed back to his own home and engineered the Apple I.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you think you can&#39;t spot exceptional information unless you&#39;re as brilliant as Wozniak, think again. You did it as a child, when unusual cracks on the sidewalk and unique clouds in the sky prompted your brain to imagine: &lt;em>;What if?&lt;/em>; To return to that earlier mindset, exit your adult brain&#39;s bias toward abstract reasoning. Focus instead on identifying what&#39;s unique about every person you meet and every place you visit — like how a company accountant spends his evenings studying Nigerian poetry, or how a local chef blends two spices like nobody else. You&#39;ll know you&#39;re picking up on the exceptional if you find yourself experiencing that childlike power to dream new tomorrows, imagining what could happen next.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;New Leadership Techniques&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Now that you have shifted your mindset, here are three techniques for training yourself to lead better in VUCA.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;&lt;strong>;Don&#39;t&amp;nbsp;Rely on Active Listening.&amp;nbsp;Do Use the New Science of Active Questioning.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Active listening is a venerable business method, defined in the 1950s by Carl Rogers and Richard Farson, that can be effective when there is low urgency and high transparency. But in VUCA, you will increase your effectiveness by employing active questioning.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Active questioning surfaces exceptional information via a simple technique: Delay asking &lt;em>;Why&lt;/em>;. When we ask &lt;em>;Why&lt;/em>;, the brain seeks answers in existing rules and prior judgments, which dismiss or explain away the new and unexpected. Instead prioritize &lt;em>;What&lt;/em>;, &lt;em>;Who&lt;/em>;, &lt;em>;When&lt;/em>;, &lt;em>;Where, How — &lt;/em>;focusing on answers that trigger surprise. That surprise is an indicator of exceptions that press the brain to develop new rules and judgments. The more of those exceptions that can be gathered and held simultaneously in view, the more effectively a leader can imagine new futures.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We recently worked with a Fortune 50 finance company that since 2019 had been losing a growing slice of its junior talent. To understand what was happening, HR asked the leavers, “Why are you going to our competitors?,” and they responded, “Money.” So the company upped its retention offers — but continued to lose talent.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To help the company respond more effectively to this emergent challenge, we trained its HR staff to delay asking &lt;em>;Why &lt;/em>;and instead engage junior talent with questions like: &lt;em>;What&lt;/em>; do you do on your weekends? &lt;em>;Who &lt;/em>;do you do it with? &lt;em>;Where &lt;/em>;do you go on vacation? From these questions, HR determined that the company&#39;s junior talent suffered from a variety of sources of low life-satisfaction. Money wasn&#39;t the deep reason for their discontent; it was just a surrogate explanation, used to communicate their sense that something was missing and to rationalize why they wanted to explore outside career options.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;By using active questioning to identify what was actually missing from its younger employees&#39; lives, the company became substantially more effective at retaining talent. One junior exec was unhappy because they and their partner were struggling to conceive a child. The company paid for fertility treatments — then hosted a baby shower.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;&lt;strong>;Don&#39;t Optimize the Plan. Do Optimize the Planner. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;In 1957, US President Dwight Eisenhower gave a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-national-defense-executive-reserve-conference&quot;>;speech&lt;/a>; in which he recalled spending his early days at the Army Staff College planning for wars that never happened. It was a waste of time, he said — except that it wasn&#39;t, because the process trained him and his colleagues to be ready for anything. “The reason it is so important to plan,” he told his audience, is “to keep yourselves steeped in the character of the problem that you may one day be called upon to solve.” In other words, as he put it famously in that speech, “Plans are worthless, but planning is everything.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Not long ago, we worked with a $100m sales company that had an unusually high percentage of senior managers who did not successfully transition to leadership. We embedded with them and discovered that they believed a key to leadership was developing the optimum plan. Their senior managers brainstormed every likely challenge or opportunity, crunched the probabilities, and developed a grand strategy. Just in case something unexpected occurred, they also made a Plan B. Yet despite having plans for every probable contingency, they were continually caught flat-footed. Their optimum plans broke again and again, as did their Plan Bs — at which point they lost confidence in their leadership, prompting their teams to lose confidence too.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These managers set themselves up for failure by trusting in Plan B. In VUCA, Plan B isn&#39;t anything other than a variation on Plan A. Both are based upon the same underlying methods and assumptions, so if one fails, the other often follows.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To help the senior managers transition into leadership, we trained them to push beyond Plan B and generate a whole set of plans that encompassed not just the most probable contingencies but all possible contingencies, with a particular emphasis on the extreme and unprecedented. The goal of this process was not to make better plans. It was to make better planners, who reacted dynamically when their plans failed by planning again. As assessed by the company&#39;s internal metrics, this approach more than doubled the rate at which senior managers transitioned into leaders.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Don&#39;t Dissociate from Fear and Anger. Do Use Emotion Reset. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Fear and anger are popularly characterized as negative emotions. Leaders are taught to suppress or bypass them via mindfulness, meditation, pop-Stoicism, and other dissociative techniques. But although fear and anger may lead to negative behaviors, they arise, like all emotions, for positive reasons — notably, to signal the onset of a flight-or-fight response. That response is triggered when your nervous system detects environmental volatility and other indicators of VUCA.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you ignore or suppress fear and anger, you deprive yourself of a warning system, tuned through millions of years of biological evolution, for alerting you when you&#39;re under threat and need to switch on your leadership vision.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;That warning system isn&#39;t perfect. But you can improve it. The next time you feel fear or anger, recall in detail a time when you dealt successfully with a similar situation, reminding your brain, &lt;em>;You&#39;ve done this before&lt;/em>;. We call this technique “emotion reset.” It allows you to quickly evaluate whether your flight-and-fight is tuned to your environment. If your fear and anger calm when you perform emotion reset, then your flight-or-flight response is an overreaction. You&#39;re imagining more VUCA than is actually present, so the best course of action is to stick with your existing plans and keep gathering data. But if your fear and anger remain constant when you perform emotion reset, then the VUCA is real, and your circumstances are urgent. Respond energetically to match that urgency by re-planning fast and acting decisively.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We worked on this with an NFL quarterback prospect who improvised too much during games. To rein in his behavior, his coaches drilled him on sticking to the gameplan. This stopped him from improvising but negatively affected his performance, turning him into a robot who lost his feel for the game.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To help him keep improvising without overdoing it, we studied his game tape. We noticed that his improvisation rate increased after failed plays, suggesting it was often driven by overactive fight-or-flight. To allow him to better assess the reliability of his fight-or-flight response, we worked with him on emotion reset. From game tape, we highlighted examples of when he had successfully executed planned plays and we had him mentally review these occasions, over and over, seeing them in detail. This primed the memories in his brain for fast recall. Then we had him create a “trigger,” a memento he associated with those memories. He took the trigger into his next game and looked at it after every bad play, remembering &lt;em>;I&#39;ve done this before&lt;/em>;. By resetting his emotions, he kept himself from getting unnecessarily anxious or aggressive, sticking more consistently to the coaches&#39; game plan.

Deep tech, which combines physical technologies and digital technologies, is moving out of the lab and into real-world supply chains. Younger firms, working alone or in collaboration with large companies, are doing much of the work to commercialize it.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/how-deep-tech-can-drive-sustainability-and-profitability-in-manufacturing?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/how-deep-tech-can-drive-sustainability-and-profitability-in-manufacturing?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;The days of operations that pursue speed, quality, and cost efficiency above all else have come to an end. Today, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bcg.com/publications/2022/production-as-a-service-benefits-opportunities&quot;>;objectives that manufacturers must pursue&lt;/a>; to ensure competitiveness have evolved. Sustainability, long seen as incompatible with these traditional goals, is now a strategic imperative.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This raises a question for manufacturers: How can they make products and production processes more sustainable while remaining profitable?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is a vibrant ecosystem of companies that have started to break this trade-off with deep tech: the innovative use of emerging physical technologies enabled by digital technologies to solve large-scale problems. As they try to increase profitability and sustainability, it&#39;s time for manufacturers to use deep tech more widely and at scale.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A confluence of factors is converging to make this possible. First, the urgency to deliver sustainability is on the rise, driven by net-zero commitments and stakeholder demands. Second, financial and regulatory support for developing green technologies has never been greater. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.whitehouse.gov/cleanenergy/inflation-reduction-act-guidebook/&quot;>;Inflation Reduction Act&lt;/a>; in the United States and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/priorities-2019-2024/european-green-deal_en&quot;>;European Green Deal&lt;/a>; in the EU are prime examples of this. And third, potentially transforming technologies are moving out of the lab and into the real world, with many demonstrating success at scale. These shifting dynamics present opportunities for manufacturers such as creating or moving to new markets or securing a head start in addressing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bcg.com/publications/2023/how-scarcity-will-reshape-sustainability-strategy&quot;>;supply scarcities&lt;/a>;, especially for green materials.&lt;/p>; &lt;article-promo>; &lt;hbr-component type=&quot;promo&quot; is-insight=&quot;insight-center&quot; title=&quot;The New Age of Operations&quot; dek=&quot;Improving efficiency and increasing resilience.&quot; cta-text=&quot;&quot; href=&quot;/insight-center/the-new-age-of-operations&quot;>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/insight-center/the-new-age-of-operations&quot; style=&quot;color:black;text-decoration:none&quot;>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; Insight Center Collection &lt;/div>; &lt;h3>;The New Age of Operations&lt;/h3>; &lt;div>; Improving efficiency and increasing resilience. &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hbr-component>; &lt;/article-promo>; &lt;p>;To capture these opportunities, break their trade-offs, and deliver sustainability, leaders should apply deep tech across their products as well as their processes. They will also need to consider how to collaborate with the innovation ecosystem, especially with younger deep tech firms.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Deep Tech Can Enhance the Profitability-Sustainability Profile of Products&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;With deep tech, manufacturing companies can reimagine the very essence of their products. Instead of offering incremental enhancements or partial substitutions — which often don&#39;t yield significant benefits and may even be counterproductive — it&#39;s essential for businesses to consider more fundamental product updates.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Manufacturers can develop and use new materials that are delinked from legacy materials&#39; supply chains or environmental footprints. Synthetically produced biological materials can act as sustainable building blocks or as drop-in substitutes. Market segments in which a sustainable manufactured product translates into a new relevant product claim are more likely to command a green premium, for example in the personal beauty space.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Consider &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.genomatica.com/&quot;>;Geno&lt;/a>;, a San Diego-based company that has developed plant-based alternatives for palm oil and fossil-based beauty, cleaning, and apparel ingredients based on its synthetic biology platform. The carbon footprint of Geno&#39;s synthetic biology–based palm oil is up to 50% lower than conventional palm-derived ingredients. By offering traceability and lowering the reliance on traditional palm-oil supply chains, its use also drives supply chain transparency and resiliency. Similarly, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.modernmeadow.com/&quot;>;Modern Meadow&lt;/a>; has developed a synthetic biology–derived collagen with unique bioactive effects. Specialty ingredients supplier &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.modernmeadow.com/news/evonikpartnership&quot;>;Evonik has partnered with Modern Meadow&lt;/a>; to bring this to scale across the personal care and cosmetics sector.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Deep tech can contribute to both supply and price stability of raw materials, which are key for a manufacturer. Switching to renewable or more abundant materials answers both of those needs and can even shorten supply chains, reducing the complexity and carbon footprint of their logistics network. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nironmagnetics.com/&quot;>;Niron Magnetics&lt;/a>;, for instance, has developed and is scaling up production of high-performance magnets. Their magnets are made from widely abundant nitrogen and iron, a viable alternative to alleviate the rare earth metals supply chain, which is concentrated in a few sources and processed in only a few plants worldwide. While initially targeting applications such as sensors or loudspeakers, these magnets could soon &lt;a href=&quot;https://spectrum.ieee.org/permanent-magnet-tesla&quot;>;contribute to making EV motors&lt;/a>;, such as those from Tesla, rare earth-free.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another way to enhance the profitability-sustainability profile is to change the performance profile of a product, for example by extending its life or endowing sustainable product properties that aren&#39;t possible with conventional materials.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Basilisk, for instance, has developed a bio-based drop-in treatment, made of engineered microorganisms using syn-bio techniques, that can be mixed in with mortar or applied to existing concrete structures. This repair system uses limestone-producing microorganisms to eliminate the need for crack repair and maintenance. Depending on the product, this can lower CO&lt;sub>;2&lt;/sub>; emissions by &lt;a href=&quot;https://basiliskconcrete.com/en/products/product-healing-agent/&quot;>;30–50%&lt;/a>; versus conventional concrete by extending the lifetime of the concrete and reducing the amount of steel needed for reinforcement. If applied at scale, this could mean a reduction of global CO&lt;sub>;2&lt;/sub>; emissions by more than 1.5%, since currently more than 6% of global CO&lt;sub>;2&lt;/sub>; emissions come from concrete.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Deep Tech Can Make Sustainable Process Economics More Compelling&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;It&#39;s not just the products themselves that create constraints, but also the processes used to make them.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2023/05/31/there-is-more-than-one-way-to-make-green-steel&quot;>;Boston Metal&lt;/a>; reimagined the conventional carbon-intensive steelmaking process by inventing a new electrolytic process and associated apparatus able to run on 100% renewable electricity and emitting no CO&lt;sub>;2&lt;/sub>;. The molten-oxide electrolysis technique, made possible by new electrode materials that can withstand high temperatures and are stable in the presence of oxygen, has the potential to reduce the carbon footprint of the steel industry, currently responsible for as much as 8% of global GHG emissions.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Deep tech can enable innovation on processes to deliver step-changes in energy efficiency. Combined with new production enablers — like a shift from linear assembly lines to small, cellular factories — manufacturers can increase flexibility, introduce optionality for local manufacturing, and transition to a lower carbon footprint production network.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For instance, &lt;a href=&quot;https://plasmonics.tech/&quot;>;Syzygy Plasmonics&lt;/a>;&#39; scalable photoreactor combines LED light and photocatalytic nanoparticles to conduct chemical reactions, made possible by combining advancements in architected materials and innovation in photonics. Because the reactor focuses the energy from light exactly where it is needed, conversions become much more efficient and sustainable than a conventional reaction. By removing the need for combustion in the emissions-heavy chemical industry, Syzygy Plasmonics aims to avoid one gigaton of CO&lt;sub>;2&lt;/sub>; emissions by 2040.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lastly, manufacturers can develop and use entirely new processes, like new additive manufacturing or precision fermentation techniques, that enable the realization of conventionally unmanufacturable sustainable products. With deep tech, manufacturers can engineer processes that reduce the number of energy-requiring transformations by building from the atom up.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Geno has successfully scaled their synthetic biology technology and farm-based supply chain to tackle large ingredients markets like butanediol (BDO), an industrial chemical, and nylon critical to the sustainability goals of its brand partners like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.unilever.com/news/press-and-media/press-releases/2022/unilever-and-geno-launch-120m-venture-to-scale-alternative-ingredients/&quot;>;Unilever&lt;/a>;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.loreal-finance.com/eng/news-event/loreal-invests-biotechnology-venture-scale-development-plant-based-ingredients&quot;>;L&#39;Oréal&lt;/a>;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.genomatica.com/news-content/lululemon-partners-with-genomatica-on-plant-based-nylon/&quot;>;Lululemon&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Operations executives should look for incentives, subsidies, and other opportunities created by recent &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/the-new-era-of-industrial-policy-is-here&quot;>;government policies&lt;/a>;. In the United States, the IRA alone covers &lt;a href=&quot;https://media-publications.bcg.com/BCG-Executive-Perspectives-US-IRA-Clean-Tech.pdf&quot;>;$71 billion&lt;/a>; in stimulus for advanced manufacturing, industrial facilities, and energy efficiency.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Build an Innovation Ecosystem&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Deep tech operates at the intersection of several emerging technologies, such as synthetic biology and 3D printing. It addresses complex issues that cross different scientific fields. It needs to serve real market needs, while often demanding significant funding and extended development periods.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Traditional companies may find it difficult to navigate this swiftly changing landscape. And few, if any, will have the tools and capabilities to do it alone.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To start making progress, manufacturers should seek to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bcg.com/publications/2023/fast-tracking-new-green-technologies&quot;>;collaborate with partners &lt;/a>;— through commercial alliances, incubators, or ecosystems that can even include governments and academia, for example. Counterintuitive as it might seem, younger deep tech firms and incumbent manufacturers should not compete but rather collaborate. Established manufacturers can expect to get access to novel technologies and specific know-how that enables them to apply deep tech in their products and processes. When partnering with deep tech startups, manufacturers should look for solutions that are most compatible with their domain and build on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://fortune.com/2023/02/03/synthetic-biology-startups-incumbents-cooperation/&quot;>;unique assets and capabilities&lt;/a>; they can leverage to create value for their joint efforts.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chicago-based biotech company LanzaTech, for instance, has developed a microbe-based technology that uses residual gases containing carbon monoxide and hydrogen as feedstock to produce bioethanol. In partnerships such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.basf.com/global/en/media/news-releases/2021/05/p-21-206.html&quot;>;with BASF&lt;/a>;, the world&#39;s largest chemicals manufacturer, LanzaTech is working to convert the carbon in the exhaust gases from industrial processes, such as steel making, into sustainable raw materials for various industries. By capturing and utilizing carbon in this way, the technology can help reduce the carbon emissions of many manufacturers and associated supply chains. BASF thus improves the sustainability of their customer&#39;s resource use and helps create demand for LanzaTech&#39;s technology.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This example is just one of many. When looking to collaborate with deep tech startups, manufacturers can consider &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bcg.com/publications/2023/what-is-your-synthetic-bio-strategy&quot;>;partnerships, joint ventures, or M&amp;amp;A approaches&lt;/a>;. The optimal engagement strategy and suitable partner will depend on the specific constraints a manufacturer faces in their domain, the need to complement missing in-house capabilities, and desired ambition level or scale.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To achieve commercial success activated by deep tech at scale, manufacturers should combine their product or process innovation with foundationally different value chains. Our extensive &lt;a href=&quot;https://bcghendersoninstitute.com/themes/business-ecosystems/&quot;>;research on business ecosystems&lt;/a>; shows that value chain transformations, while challenging and often requiring extensive collaboration, will unlock enormous value. Manufacturers can leverage their unique capabilities and existing relationships to influence suppliers and distributors to transition to solutions or infrastructure that will support the new processes and products or help navigate the regulatory environment.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Consider the fashion industry, which accounts for around &lt;a href=&quot;https://fashionforgood.com/our_news/fashion-for-good-launches-the-renewable-carbon-textiles-project/&quot;>;4%&lt;/a>; of greenhouse gas emissions globally. Sustainability innovation efforts, which need to be effective throughout complex global fashion value chains, are particularly &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.glossy.co/fashion/a-tough-sell-to-ceos-fashion-sustainability-is-taking-a-hit-in-the-current-economy/&quot;>;challenged in the current economic environment&lt;/a>;. Companies are pooling risk by collaborating cross-industry through a consortium like Fashion for Good. Fashion for Good has established an &lt;a href=&quot;https://fashionforgood.com/innovation-platform/&quot;>;innovation program&lt;/a>; that connects brands, retailers, manufacturers, and investors to develop and scale disruptive solutions within the textile industry.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The members of this industry-wide initiative are looking to realize collective goals of making sustainable change happen in &lt;a href=&quot;https://fashionforgood.com/innovation-platform/focus-areas/&quot;>;areas&lt;/a>; such as materials, processing, or end of use — but are unable to do it individually. The group has, for example, launched the &lt;a href=&quot;https://fashionforgood.com/our_news/fashion-for-good-launches-the-renewable-carbon-textiles-project/&quot;>;Renewable Carbon Textiles Project&lt;/a>;, focusing on producing fibers from polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) polymer fibers, which could offer a sustainable, biodegradable alternative to traditional, fossil-based fibers, with the potential to significantly cut emissions in fashion&#39;s value chain while simultaneously allowing manufacturers to fine-tune fabric properties. The project combines expertise of innovators like Danimer Scientific, Bio Craft Innovation, Paques Biomaterials, Helian Polymers, and Newlight Technologies with other players in the industry who will test the solutions, provide funding, and help scale the solution.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Conclusion&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;The examples of deep tech ventures and collaborations with manufacturing incumbents show that deep tech can already help companies deliver on the operations paradigm, advancing a common sustainability agenda without sacrificing long-term profitability. The real challenge is not the technology itself, but the inertia of long-established capital investments and time-tested manufacturing approaches — overcoming this is no small feat.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Given the pressing urgency for sustainability, manufacturers need to act swiftly and decisively. Manufacturers that leverage their unique capabilities and succeed in identifying the right engagement models can use deep tech as their critical driver of competitive advantage — and now is the time to get started.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 28 Sep 2023 21:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[3 Ways to Prepare for the Future of Work]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/09/3-ways-to-prepare-for-the-future-of-work]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/07/Jul23_20_alanahsarginson.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;Illustration by Alanah Sarginson&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;Many forces are converging today in unprecedented ways to reshape the nature of work. To understand and adapt to these forces, leaders need to start thinking seriously about three important areas of concern: the future of &lt;em>;workers&lt;/em>; (who are questioning the role that work plays in their lives and demanding more from the organizations they work for); the future of &lt;em>;working&lt;/em>; (which is evolving rapidly thanks to hybrid and flexible work arrangements, digitalization, and automation); and the future of &lt;em>;work &lt;/em>;itself (which always involves in response to macro forces and societal shifts). The authors refer to these three areas as the &lt;em>;who&lt;/em>;, the &lt;em>;what&lt;/em>;, and the &lt;em>;why &lt;/em>;of work. Each has its own particular set of challenges. Leaders need to confront and address these challenges, and the authors of this article provide suggestions for how they can best do that.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/3-ways-to-prepare-for-the-future-of-work?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/3-ways-to-prepare-for-the-future-of-work?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;The last few years have been marked by generation-defining crises — political, economic, societal, and environmental. Much that we once took for granted about the world of work has been called into question, and much that was previously unimaginable is now an everyday fact of life. But the churn is far from over. As a recent recruit at a global consulting firm told us, “We are at the beginning, not the end, of massive upheavals in our work lives.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These upheavals have prompted all sorts of questions about the future of work. Where are we headed? What does the future hold, and how can leaders prepare? What should they focus on as they move their organizations forward? Digitalization and the rapidly growing capabilities of AI? The many repercussions of the shift to hybrid work? Employee wellbeing? The changing priorities of millennials and boomers? Questions of social and environmental responsibility? The unstable geopolitical context and our unclear economic future?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Faced with these multiple competing — yet interdependent — issues, leaders are feeling understandably overwhelmed. “I have done all I can to hold this firm together through the pandemic,” the CEO of the above-mentioned consulting firm told us. “When I contemplate the scale of the challenges that lie ahead, I feel I have nothing left to give.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We&#39;re scholars of leadership, sustainability, and organizational change. In recent years we have focused our attention on how leaders and organizations can best rise to meet these challenges. And what we&#39;ve learned, in both our academic research and our professional consulting, is that if leaders hope to understand and adapt to the forces that are reshaping work, they&#39;re going to need to start thinking more specifically about three important areas of concern: 1) the future of &lt;em>;workers&lt;/em>;, 2) the future of &lt;em>;working&lt;/em>;, and 3) the future of &lt;em>;work &lt;/em>;itself.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In other words, the &lt;em>;who&lt;/em>;, the &lt;em>;what&lt;/em>;, and the &lt;em>;why &lt;/em>;of work.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Three Areas of Concern&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;The &lt;em>;who&lt;/em>;, &lt;em>;what&lt;/em>; and &lt;em>;why&lt;/em>; of work are deeply connected. Thinking about how they are related won&#39;t help us accurately predict the future, but it will help us prepare for it. So let&#39;s consider each in turn.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;The future of workers (the &lt;em>;who&lt;/em>;).&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Pandemic-induced introspection and the frame-breaking experience of lockdown have caused a lot of people to question the role of work in their lives. They&#39;re asking profound questions about what their organizations are demanding of them and questioning whether their organizations are worthy of their commitment. At the same time, they&#39;re often demanding the right to bring more of their “whole selves” to work, which has forced leaders to pay much more attention than in the past to questions concerning, among other topics, employees&#39; gender, race, religion, and sexuality.&lt;/p>; &lt;article-promo>; &lt;hbr-component type=&quot;promo&quot; is-insight=&quot;insight-center&quot; title=&quot;The Future of Work&quot; dek=&quot;Will your company adapt or be left behind?&quot; cta-text=&quot;&quot; href=&quot;/insight-center/the-future-of-work&quot;>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/insight-center/the-future-of-work&quot; style=&quot;color:black;text-decoration:none&quot;>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; Insight Center Collection &lt;/div>; &lt;h3>;The Future of Work&lt;/h3>; &lt;div>; Will your company adapt or be left behind? &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hbr-component>; &lt;/article-promo>; &lt;p>;But leaders who become too focused on addressing diverse individual needs can lose sight of the bigger picture. Employees&#39; questions and concerns about work arise from a collision between two powerful forces: today&#39;s macro socio-economic realities, on the one hand, and long-accepted understandings of what belonging to an organization and doing “good” work look like, on the other. Any reflections on the future of work must take stock of this evolving status of the &lt;em>;who&lt;/em>; and how it relates to the &lt;em>;what &lt;/em>;and &lt;em>;why&lt;/em>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;The future of working (the &lt;em>;what&lt;/em>;).&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Hybrid, remote, and flexible working are here to stay. In spite of attempts to compel staff to return to the office, levels of remote working remain four to five times higher than before the pandemic. These new practices fundamentally alter how people work, where they work, and when they work, but their consequences are not yet fully understood.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Leaders feel themselves under pressure to announce “standardized” policies, as a way of providing some reassuring certainty in the midst of uncomfortable ambiguity. But in the current unsettled macro context, a sense of certainty about how we should work can only be illusory and transient.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Meanwhile digitalization is rapidly reshaping the ways people and machines interact, affecting the tasks we do, the roles we fulfill, and the organizational arrangements that guide and support us. By the mid 2030s, up to 30% of jobs may be at risk of automation, and today&#39;s rapid developments in AI have brought the future into the present much faster than most predicted. How can leaders shape work environments and employee tasks that are in constant flux as a result of rapidly evolving technological systems?&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;The future of work (the &lt;em>;why&lt;/em>;).&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Long-term macro forces and short-term shocks are creating a host of new demands on business as we adapt to new energy infrastructures, aging populations, and a hotter, more turbulent planet. Supply-chain disruptions are becoming increasingly frequent. Political events are also galvanizing rapid shifts in public sentiment — about racial inequality, for example, or business relations with Russia and China. Alongside these macro shifts, people&#39;s desires and actions are evolving, reflecting deepening differences in values, aspirations, and life choices.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some leaders are responding with renewed statements of purpose, defining how they will serve societal needs alongside shareholders&#39; increasingly diverse expectations. But these attempts to take the long view are fraught with short-term ambiguities, as moves toward redefining the role of business in society trigger backlash. This is to be expected as we work through cultural shifts and start to develop a new understanding of “what good business looks like,” and hence what good work comprises.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;We Have More Agency Than We Realize&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;The upheavals that are reshaping the who, what and why of work feel beyond our control, and to some extent that will continue. Even if the direction of travel is clear, no one can predict with certainty when and where the next operational or human crisis will arise, nor whether it will be triggered by technology, war, climate, or social unrest. Regaining agency starts with recognizing our role in this complex system, and noting how workers, working, and work itself are intertwined. Ultimately, the future of work is not “out there.” It&#39;s within us and our organizations, and we can help shape it with our colleagues through the steps outlined below.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Lead collectively through uncertainty.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;For complex environmental and geopolitical challenges, it&#39;s generally accepted that localized action can only have a limited effect, and that the solutions lie in collective action. Just as nations acting alone are weak and ineffective at dealing with complex system-level challenges, so too are leaders in organizations. To address the challenges of the future of work, leaders need to understand that theirs is not an individual responsibility but rather a collective one that brings together a complex coalition of colleagues across the organization. &lt;a href=&quot;/2019/03/how-to-lead-your-fellow-rainmakers&quot;>;Collective leadership&lt;/a>; is a core component of the future of work.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Remember the exhausted consulting-firm CEO we mentioned at the start of this article, who feels he has “nothing left to give”? He is overburdened by his sense of responsibility for shaping the future of work in his organization. But he shouldn&#39;t have to bear that responsibility alone. The burden is collective. His job is to bring together potential leaders at all levels across the organization to work on this issue, to expand collective insight, and contain emotional uncertainty.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Expand collective insight.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;The current complexity of challenges in the world of work cut across hierarchies, generations, functions, and geographies. They can only be addressed by bringing together multiple sets of stakeholders with competing interests who collectively can generate a broad set of insights and help the organization and its leaders successfully navigate uncertainty. By definition those at the top of an organization have the most to lose in the short term and so may be resistant to asking the most challenging questions about the future. Meanwhile, the youngest employees have the most to gain in the long term, because the status quo is of little value to them. For this reason, many of the organizations we work with are exploring ways of integrating new and unfamiliar voices into their leadership discussions.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Contain emotional uncertainty.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;While leaders need to reach out across their organization to instigate and sustain leadership initiatives, they also need to create some emotional guard rails. A key role for leaders at any time is to work out how best to balance individuals&#39; need for autonomy with their organization&#39;s need for control. While younger colleagues in particular may crave autonomy and opportunities to pursue their passions at work, they still need the reassurance of believing in the collective identity of their organization and their position within it. Leaders should remind employees of the best aspects of their organization&#39;s past, to reaffirm their cultural identity and to provide a firm base from which to build a collective future.&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;* * *&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ultimately, we all want to belong to something greater than ourselves that is worth committing to. But the organizations we belong to have changed, and &lt;a href=&quot;/2021/03/how-has-the-past-year-changed-you-and-your-organization&quot;>;so have we&lt;/a>;. Faced with cumulatively overwhelming challenges, it is tempting to turn away from them and try just to carry on as “normal.” But when the old sense of normal is no longer relevant, as is the case today in the world of work, we have to learn how to think clearly about what&#39;s happening.&amp;nbsp; We have to recognize that we will ultimately make sense of this difficult and exciting transformative period only by creating a new sense of normal for ourselves, one that accommodates rather than resists ambiguity and ongoing uncertainty. That&#39;s simply not something we can do in isolation. But within our organizations, focusing on collective leadership, we can begin to do it together.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 28 Sep 2023 20:25:01 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Personalize Your IT Service Delivery With Persona Mapping - SPONSOR CONTENT FROM UNISYS]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/sponsored/2023/09/personalize-your-it-service-delivery-with-persona-mapping]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;html>; &lt;head>;&lt;/head>; &lt;body>; &lt;figure>; &lt;img aria-describedby=&quot;caption-attachment-364744&quot; src=&quot;/resources/images/article_assets/2023/09/WRQ-1240-3177-Harvard-Business-Review-Sponsor_Header-Image.jpg&quot; >; &lt;/figure>; &lt;p>;&lt;em>;By Alan Shen&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Anyone who has worn a one-size-fits-all T-shirt knows that not every fit is a good fit, despite what the label says.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The same holds true for the delivery of enterprise technologies to employees. A one-size-fits-all strategy may loosely fit the needs of some of your employees—but not all.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some successful organizations have embraced a promising alternative: persona mapping, the strategy of identifying individuals (or personas) within your organization and tailoring the technology experiences you deliver to each persona group. It&#39;s a shift from the mindset of “a user is a user” that maps each employee to the business function they serve.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Persona mapping is a must for any organization prioritizing business for understanding and refining the employee experiences (EXs) you provide. By creating persona groups, you can measure and optimize the business impact of your enterprise technologies.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;How can persona mapping optimize IT service delivery? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Persona mapping enables your IT teams to recognize the unique needs of every employee rather than focusing on a broad picture of a generic end user. Beyond improving EX, a persona-mapping strategy can align to organizational priorities, making it easier to achieve key business outcomes.&lt;/p>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div id=&quot;DFP_IC_pos3&quot;>; &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;>;if (isAdobeSync()) googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(&quot;DFP_IC_pos3&quot;); });&lt;/script>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;Here are two of many applications for persona mapping.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;&lt;em>;Help desk ticket routing&lt;/em>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Organizations often struggle to efficiently allocate limited IT support resources and prioritize service tickets, especially when multiple specialized service desks are involved. Imagine explaining your problem to a service desk agent, being transferred to a different agent, and then being required to restate the details of your issue. This inefficiency can result in frustrating delays for employees seeking help. Us for better customer service and reduced response times.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When an employee contacts the service desk, a dynamic lookup system identifies their persona group and directs them to the right specialist immediately. A field salesperson might be sent directly to a team specializing in their specific sales software, while a health care worker could be directed to an expert familiar with their hospital&#39;s electronic medical record system. This approach not only improves the support experience but also enhances employee productivity.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;&lt;em>;Equipment refresh&lt;/em>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Adopting a persona-driven approach to device life cycle management ensures your workforce has the tools it needs for optimal performance. Engineers using heavy-duty applications may need frequent device updates, while occasional equipment upgrades may suffice for a salesperson, saving costs and benefiting the environment.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Moreover, frontline employees, like airline crews using corporate tablets, benefit from tailored support solutions. Providing support at briefing centers or a “device help” button for airport staff ensures efficient on-site troubleshooting without inconveniencing passengers.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;How do you choose your personas?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div id=&quot;DFP_IC_pos4&quot;>; &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;>;if (isAdobeSync()) googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(&quot;DFP_IC_pos4&quot;); });&lt;/script>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;The number of personas your organization should create depends on what&#39;s both manageable and useful for IT. If you&#39;re new to persona mapping, start with up to ten personas to balance benefits and administrative ease. Scaling up can occur as needed.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Remember, personas shouldn&#39;t be aligned solely by job role, because roles can vary widely in technology needs. Instead, create personas based on clusters of employees with similar needs, such as a group comprising finance, legal, and marketing staff or another based on geographic location.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When developing personas, consider these key factors:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Seniority and role: &lt;/strong>;High-ranking executives and mission-critical employees like trauma center doctors may need prioritized IT support. Organizations often create a VIP persona for such roles.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Customer experience:&lt;/strong>; Roles that are customer facing, like retail staff, may require quicker support to minimize downtime and its impact on the customer experience.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Location:&lt;/strong>; Employees at a manufacturing plant may require immediate Tier 1 service desk attention to avoid costly downtime. Location-based personas also help tailor services for remote and in-office staff.&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;Some employees may fit multiple personas, such as a doctor who is both customer facing and of high seniority. In such cases, establish a process to help IT decide which persona takes precedence in different scenarios. Whatever the circumstance, understanding a day in the life of each of your user personas is a must.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;What&#39;s involved in setting up persona mapping? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong>;Persona mapping involves qualitative research, often through workshops with key stakeholders, to understand employee tech needs and daily experiences. However, merely listing personas isn&#39;t enough; significant engineering is required to map this data in your identity database for tailored IT services.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A common hurdle for adoption is unclear responsibility for planning, implementation, and maintenance of personas. To avoid setbacks, it&#39;s crucial to assemble a dedicated team and clarify stakeholder responsibilities early on.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Maximize your business value with persona mapping&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Prioritize your IT resources based on personas to better inform equipment refreshes, service ticket routing, EX initiatives, and other business processes. Persona mapping can help your employees deliver better customer outcomes, contributing to higher customer loyalty and renewals.
