&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt; a href=&quot;/2023/09/how-the-best-chief-data-officers-create-value?language=es&quot;>;阅读西班牙语&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/ how-the-best-chief-data-officers-create-value?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;数据正在迅速成为每个决策、客户接触点和决策中不可或缺的元素。内部流程。更强大的数据和分析能力带来的机会在整个价值链中都是显而易见的——从面向客户的算法工具（提供个性化建议）到企业工具（自动筛选申请人简历）。随着数据和分析成为提高效率、更好决策和更大创新的重要驱动力，首席执行官们开始邀请一位新成员加入他们的最高管理层：首席数据（和分析）官 (CDO)。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;尽管数据和分析功能的重要性迅速提高，但大多数 CDO 未能对其数据和分析功能所创造的业务成果进行评估和定价。毫不奇怪，许多 CDO 落后于&lt;a href=&quot;/2021/08/why-do-chief-data-officers-have-such-short-tenures&quot;>;预期&lt;/a>;并且&lt;a href =&quot;/2023/06/why-chief-data-and-ai-officers-are-set-up-to-fail&quot;>;任期较短&lt;/a>;。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;作为研究项目的一部分在哈佛大学数字、数据和设计学院的数字价值实验室，我们对 CDO 进行了 17 次深度访谈，他们在很大程度上被认为处于该角色的前沿。根据访谈，我们总结了 CDO 可以在哪些方面创造价值以及他们如何衡量和定价价值。除了创造和&lt;a href=&quot;/2023/01/8-strategies-for-chief-data-officers-to-create-and-demonstrate-value&quot;>;展示价值&lt;/a>;的策略之外，我们还提供定性见解以及数据分析领导者目前采用的定量测量方法。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;CDO 如何创造价值&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;CDO 通常会影响四个相互关联的领域。根据数据责任&lt;a href=&quot;/2019/07/building-the-ai-powered-organization&quot;>;联盟&lt;/a>;的级别，CDO 对这些领域具有或多或少的影响力。第一个影响范围与业务价值直接相关，可以称为与用例直接相关的数据产品。这些产品的开发、维护和持续改进（主要由 CDO 部门）是为了解决内部或外部客户的特定业务问题。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;其次，CDO 通常会管理组织的数据资产和平台（有时负责管理组织的数据资产和平台）。也称为多用途&lt;a href=&quot;/2022/07/a-better-way-to-put-your-data-to-work&quot;>;数据产品&lt;/a>;）：本质上是可重用的资产，允许团队整个组织可以轻松高效地访问数据并在此基础上构建用例驱动的数据产品（包括报告）。对于大多数公司来说，第一个资产是“Customer 360”，它汇集了跨业务部门收集的客户的所有信息。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;第三个影响范围在概念上位于前两个范围之下，包括组织的数据架构和治理。它承载着数据产品团队以标准化方式高效运营所需的底层技术和管理基础设施。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;CDO 的第四个影响范围是组织，更具体地说，是其人员。该组织反映了任何数据计划的基础，因为它提供和培养一般数据素养和专业数据人才。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;了解竞争环境很重要。企业聘用的首席数据官通常具有不同的期望，包括成为数据和分析的技术领导者、整体业务的远见者、促进数据驱动决策的文化革命者、数据治理专家等等。然而，成功需要这些不同角色之间的共同努力。勇敢的 CDO 需要为每个影响范围提出价值、衡量价值并主张价值。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;数据产品的价值主张&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;数据产品是应用程序由 CDO 开发和管理，以便在正确的时间为特定业务流程提供正确质量的正确数据。他们的目标是生成可行的见解，以改善内部运营、增强产品或服务、创建全新产品或向外部合作伙伴提供数据。 CDO 部门应反映每个业务线，然后针对每个业务线制定数据产品路线图（与业务方共同），优先考虑最具影响力的用例，并部署跨学科团队来开发、维护和改进数据产品遵循&lt;a href=&quot;/2022/07/a-better-way-to-put-your-data-to-work&quot;>;敏捷产品开发&lt;/a>;和数据运营的原则。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;每个团队都应该具备独立运行所需的所有能力，从理解业务问题到创建数据科学模型和可视化，再到构建数据管道。这些灯塔项目在战术层面非常重要：它们激发了其他 C 级管理人员和业务部门的支持和信任，并展示了数据计划的可行性和影响。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Mohammed Aaser，CDO数据和分析平台提供商 Domo Inc. 表示：“CDO 正在打一场两条战线的战争。在一种情况下，他们必须迅速展现价值。同时，他们必须建立能够持久并能够创造价值的平台。现实情况是，如果你从平台开始，需要两年的时间，你不会表现出太大的价值，而且你也不会找到工作。”&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;数据资产和数据的价值主张平台&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;第二个影响范围包括数据资产和平台，可用于构建应对各种挑战的数据产品。他们将整个企业的源系统中的不同数据集和元素集成到单个资产或平台中，从而可以更好地了解正在考虑的问题。他们的目标是实现规模化：数据资产或平台使组织中的任何人都可以轻松快速地交付数据（通过数据产品或自助服务 API）。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;CDO 需要与部门负责人保持一致优先考虑哪个数据资产或平台。然后，专门的团队拥有每个资产或平台，并使用以产品为中心的敏捷交付方法（类似于数据产品）。他们首先收集用户需求，确定功能的优先级，然后开发、维护和改进资产。这包括衡量采用率和收集用户反馈。由于这些资产跨越多个业务线，它们通常需要统一核心业务指标的定义和计算——这有力地证明了 CDO 的跨职能角色如何帮助业务线使用相同的语言并形成整体理解&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;数据架构和治理的价值主张&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;在大多数企业中，数据的激增导致了系统、实践、和政策。因此，管理数据架构和治理是 CDO 的核心职责之一——我们将其视为第三个影响范围。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;数据架构和治理的目标都是管理数据的基础知识通过以经济高效的方式提供所需的数据系统并确保以简化的方式生成、记录和使用数据来组织组织。关于数据架构，CDO 的价值主张是定义和调整目标数据架构中需要哪些系统和工具（例如安全性）来支持所需的数据产品，然后获取或构建并运行这些系统。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;此外，CDO 应集中管理通常极其昂贵的数据特定系统的许可证和实例，并定义使用标准。对于数据治理，CDO 的价值主张包括制定有关可访问性、质量、互操作性和安全性的数据策略，以及开发数据目录作为有关数据的方式、位置和数据的单一事实来源。存储在数据资产和平台中。数据治理还应包括数据操作以及算法和人工智能的使用的核心最佳实践和标准。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;组织数据就绪的价值主张&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>; CDO 的目标应该是培养所需的数据特定角色和组织范围内的能力，以支持所有其他与数据相关的活动。虽然这需要雇用和保留足够的数据人才，但真正的成功来自于整个组织的激活：领先的 CDO 定义不同的内部数据角色，对组织中的每个角色进行分类，并为他们规划职业发展旅程。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;提高 CDO 部门以外员工的技能，例如通过为业务领导者和主题专家提供“数据翻译”培训，创造了对数据产品的强劲需求。技能提升还创造了本地冠军，确保数据产品在其业务部门的嵌入和采用。一线员工需要了解基础知识（例如，如何计算指标、如何去平均和识别较低水平的趋势），否则，担心犯错误、取错数字或误解数字会让他们回到原来的状态。他们的旧流程。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;CDO 如何衡量、展示和定价他们的价值贡献？ &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;对于 CDO 来说，在所有影响范围内明确定义价值主张是衡量、展示甚至有时定价其价值的必要先决条件。领先的 CDO 已开始制定定性和定量衡量标准，以防止组织对其数据计划投资不足或过度。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一位 CDO 声称业务部门将不再（或不太频繁）请求或使用数据产品，如果他们必须考虑数据团队和底层数据资产/平台的相关价格，这可以解释为什么一些组织回避内部退款模型。然而，定价数据可以让企业领导者更好地评估预算的最有效利用。此外，如果业务部门从自己的预算中分配资金，他们就参与其中，并希望利用它获得可衡量的结果。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;数据领导者通常从“影子”退款（即理论上的内部费用）开始。 CDO 部门拥有的每项服务、产品或资产的“影子”收入账户（即启用的收入增量）——“影子”表明它（还）不是正式的损益记录。影子退款有助于为 CDO 项目贴上价格标签，无论谁为这些项目付款，了解这一点都很重要。考虑到数据计划的战略相关性，CDO 和业务部门经常利用 CFO 控制的中央预算来支付退款。 （影子）退款和收入账户的好处是什么？资源得到有效分配，业务部门对推动采用和成功更加感兴趣，CDO 被激励进入销售模式，CDO 可以更轻松地展示其价值贡献。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;数据的价值衡量产品&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;CDO 角色需要大量的说服和讲故事。在这方面，展示数据产品在具体业务用例中的潜力至关重要。 CDO 应至少衡量以下一组指标：&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;灯塔数据产品的业务影响&lt;/h3>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;定量衡量：&lt;/strong>; 数据产品的采用率针对内部客户（例如一线员工）或外部客户&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;定量测量：&lt;/strong>;根据实施前基线或参考案例（通过 A/B 测试）改进数据产品例如，减少流失&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;h3>;&lt;strong>;数据产品团队的运营效率和成熟度&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;定量衡量：&lt;/strong >; 数据产品开发和运营中使用的资源（例如，每个数据产品或功能的工时、所需的额外 CPU）&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;定性衡量：&lt;/strong>; 支持业务、通过调查对反馈的响应度和 SLA 履行情况&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;定性衡量：&lt;/strong>;通过调查了解敏捷数据产品团队的成熟度（例如敏捷仪式的复杂程度）&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul >; &lt;p>;大多数企业领导者仍然难以理解数据如何改变其核心流程的工作方式。展示高价值的灯塔数据产品及其业务影响可以帮助业务部门领导了解可能性。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但是，明智的投资决策需要对成本进行估计。在部署团队之前，CDO 需要让他们参与项目规模调整练习，以确定潜在数据产品需要哪些角色以及需要多少人时。对于每个业务线，CDO 部门应保留一个数据产品路线图，反映并遵循各自的业务战略和目标/关键结果。一位 CDO 告诉我们，他举办了一个年度高管价值工程研讨会，他们将一长串 60 到 70 个数据产品想法归结为 10 名候选者，然后是在来年实现的 4 个数据产品。他们的决策基于 2×2 矩阵，其中一个轴为估计业务影响，另一轴为估计资源需求（即成本）。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;CDO 先驱 Sebastian Klapdor，Vista 的 CDO，营销和设计公司建立了各种指标来衡量其团队创造的价值。通过采用数据产品以及实施前后的测量，Vista 已经能够增加 9000 万美元的利润，其中很大一部分每年都会重复产生。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;价值数据资产和平台的衡量&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Domo Inc. 的 Mohammed Aaser 将多用途数据资产和平台描述为“装配线”，允许在整个组织内大规模开发数据产品。 CDO 开发并不断改进装配线，不断消除所有瓶颈并纳入用户反馈。然而，在数据资产和平台之上构建数据产品的团队会增加价值，随着成熟度的提高，这些产品和平台可能会变得越来越去中心化，并由各自的业务部门执行。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;因此，CDO 需要实施各种定性和定量测量，以衡量、显示和声明它们通过数据资产/平台提供的价值。&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;多用途数据产品/平台的业务影响&lt;/h3>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li >;&lt;strong>;定量测量：&lt;/strong>;数据资产和平台的使用和参与度（例如，用户数量、访问的数据量）&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;定量测量：&lt;/strong>;处理时间使用数据资产和平台的查询&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;定性测量：&lt;/strong>;用例驱动的数据产品开发流程改进的轶事故事（来自业务部门和 CDO 部门团队）&lt; /li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;h3>;数据产品/平台团队的运营效率&lt;/h3>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;量化衡量：&lt;/strong>;数据资产/平台开发和运营所使用的资源（例如，每个数据资产/平台的人时）&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;定量测量：&lt;/strong>;功能开发和源系统集成的速度&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;构建诸如“Customer 360”资产之类的多用途数据资产/平台需要大量预算，并且通常需要较长的开发时间（一到三年，具体取决于业务）。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在开发之前， CDO 应优先考虑与业务部门领导最相关的多用途数据资产和平台。他们应该根据五年内可能实现的 30 到 40 个数据产品来估计每个领域的相关价值池（这里适合粗略估计）。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;基于平均投资回报率现有数据产品的数量以及额外开发需求的统一费率降低（在这些多用途数据资产/平台的基础上构建），应对投资规模进行预算。鉴于此类资产和平台是跨职能的且具有战略价值，首席财务官最常充当项目发起人。尽管如此，CDO 在开发后应该利用业务部门希望产生的估计影响以及用例驱动的数据产品的平均投资回报率来实施内部（影子）退款。或者，CDO 可以定义基于用户或基于使用的定价模型。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;数据架构和治理的价值衡量&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;提供数据的大部分职责架构以集中和高效的管理为中心，例如通过许可证和实例的集中分配或系统的合理化。 Salesforce 的高级副总裁兼首席数字官 Wendy Batchelder 解释说，这些往往是快速的胜利，并且首席财务官成为推动项目的重要合作伙伴。通过实施分层方案来规范查询何时被视为高/中/低速查询，她很快就实现了显着的成本节省。&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;数据架构的业务影响&lt;/h3>; &lt;ul >; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;定量衡量：&lt;/strong>;通过集中管理和根据实施前基线对系统进行合理化来改善成本基础&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;h3>;&lt;strong>;为未来做好准备数据架构和治理&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;定性测量：&lt;/strong>;系统路线图的进展（现状与目标状态）&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;定性衡量：&lt;/strong>;数据政策的进展（现状与目标状态）&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;定性衡量：&lt;/strong>;数据目录的进展（现状与目标状态）&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;定性衡量：&lt;/strong>;数据目录的进展（现状与目标状态）&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;定性衡量：&lt;/strong>;数据目录的进展（现状与目标状态）&lt;/li>; li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;组织数据就绪性的价值衡量&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;创建数据文化通常被认为是 CDO 面临的最大挑战之一。领先的 CDO 与人力资源等内部合作伙伴和大学等外部合作伙伴密切合作，策划教育计划并开发针对特定数据的专业发展之旅。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;为了了解其教育工作的有效性，CDO 应设定净推荐值 (NPS) 调查。一位接受采访的首席数据官因其中层管理培训获得了 80 至 90 的世界级 NPS，该培训重点关注业务价值创造和数据的道德使用。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;三种衡量标准构成了绩效跟踪的基础组织影响范围：&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;定量衡量：&lt;/strong>;数据素养员工培训、学院、训练营和电子学习的完成率&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt; strong>;定量衡量：&lt;/strong>;数据素养员工培训、学院、训练营和电子学习的净推荐值&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;定性衡量：&lt;/strong>;数据角色和数据素养的概念开发历程&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;。 。 .&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;走出 CDO 的阴影不仅仅是一个职业抱负。它预示着组织对数据的看法发生了重要转变，并确保数据相关项目根据其价值贡献获得资助或取消资助。鉴于与数据、分析和人工智能相关的巨大机会，如果没有与价值的明确联系，企业将无法再承担不协调的数据工作。虽然人工智能占据了头条新闻，但人们一致认为：数据成熟必然先于人工智能成熟。&lt;/p>;

&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09 /the-myth-of-the-ceo-as-ultimate-decision-maker?language=es&quot;>;阅读西班牙语&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/the-myth-of- the-ceo-as-ultimate-decision-maker?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;对首席执行官角色的一个常见误解是，他们是最终决策者，并且获得这个令人垂涎的职位的奖励是你现在可以做出所有决定。事实上，首席执行官的角色更多的是&lt;em>;塑造&lt;/em>;，而不是做出决策。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这种微妙差异有一个根本原因。组织每天面临无数决策，首席执行官不可能参与每一项决策。尝试这样做会减慢整个操作的速度，甚至可能使其陷入停滞。因此，首席执行官的正确角色不是直接做出决策，而是让其他人做出首席执行官可以支持的决策。当然，有时首席执行官必须是最终决策者，但首席执行官的做法应该受到奥卡姆剃刀的启发：首席执行官可以做出的决策越少越好。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;首席执行官有几种工具供他们决定在其组织中制定决策。有些是在整个组织层面。首席执行官可以通过让每个人围绕共同目标、阐明优先事项和设定目标来制定决策。决策还可以通过制定明确的战略、采用能够适当分配职责的组织结构以及培育强大的文化来形成。清晰的绩效衡量和奖励制度也能有所帮助。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;即使首席执行官们构建了更广泛的背景来影响整个组织的决策，他们也不能完全放弃决策。事实上，他们必须选择个人参与决策的地点和方式。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;任何组织的决策环境都是广阔的。一张有用的地图是在一个轴上考虑决策类别（例如，战略、结构、文化、人员、产品、投资等），在另一个轴上考虑需要做出决策的组织级别（例如，公司、业务单位、区域、职能、子公司、工厂、办事处等）。首席执行官必须选择如何亲自参与整个领域的决策。这涉及在类别和级别的每个交叉点，确定他们参与设计决策过程的程度，选择何时直接参与，监控工作，并明确何时和由谁做出决策。该框架基于我与同事一起在哈佛商学院教授首席执行官研讨会的 25 年经验，以及我自己作为董事会成员和顾问领导组织和为首席执行官提供建议的经验。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;设计流程&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;首席执行官可以通过深思熟虑地设计决策流程来影响任何决策。这涉及设置参数，例如谁将参与，要回答什么问题，要收集什么类型的信息，要记住什么护栏，要举行多少次会议，讨论的结构以及何时和通过什么决定谁。首席执行官可能在设计某些决策流程中发挥重要作用，而在其他决策流程中发挥较小的作用。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;例如，我们研究的一位首席执行官大量参与了关键投资组合选择流程的设计，例如保留、剥离和收购业务。他与他的直接下属和一小群高潜力经理合作，定义了评估每项业务的指标，选择了一组竞争对手来衡量绩效，设定了三个月的时间框架来完成分析，并建立了每周举行三小时会议，期间团队审查进展情况并商定后续步骤。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;同一位首席执行官将为结构性变革准备建议的任务委托给其首席财务官和首席人力资源官，从而实现成本削减目标。共享服务，例如人力资源、IT 和财务。除了具体说明他希望两人共同努力实现超过 15% 的成本节省外，他还给了他们充分的余地来设计生成这些建议的流程。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这两个例子说明了首席执行官必须采取的意向性这些设计选择。根据他们想要影响的具体问题，他们必须选择各种参数（例如，任务对象、设定什么目标/指标、建立什么时间框架以及创建什么期望），并确定他们想要解决哪些问题亲自参与，以及他们乐于委托和信任其他人参与哪些工作。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;参与流程&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;CEO 必须选择参与多少他们希望参与决策过程的各个阶段。 CEO 可能会积极参与每一步，时不时地进行检查，或者在特定的时间点（例如开始、中间或结束）参与其中。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;CEO 对何时以及如何亲自进行的选择参与决策通常反映了他们希望团队积极参与决策的愿望，以此作为增加支持的一种方式。如果你观察这些环境中的首席执行官，你会发现，令人惊讶的是，他们的许多行为都是为了引导他人做出决定，而不是以一种可能让人感觉严厉的方式公开影响决策。他们通过挑战流程、提高标准、提出棘手问题并要求更好的答案来提供指导。尽管首席执行官们参与其中，但他们还是小心地将实际决策权留给了同事。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;例如，设计战略投资组合审核流程的首席执行官出席了 12 次会议中的 5 次。他参加了前两次会议，以设定正确的基调和方向。然后他允许团队做作业。他在流程中间进行了一次检查，以确保一切顺利进行。最后，当该小组提出建议时，他参加了最后两次会议，重新参与其中。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;相比之下，在成本削减工作流程上，他没有参加任何会议，而是要求首席财务官和首席人力资源官向他介绍情况并在认为有帮助时寻求他的意见。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;首席执行官在此类情况下选择的个人参与程度反映了他们希望管理每个流程的严格程度以及他们对流程的重视程度决定、他们对涉及每个案件的领导者的信心程度，以及他们认为随着流程的展开进行干预和改变方向的成本有多大。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;监控工作&lt;/ strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;首席执行官还必须选择他们希望亲自参与监督工作的程度。在任何决策过程展开时提供反馈是首席执行官角色的重要组成部分。在定期审查的情况下，首席执行官将自己描述为监督者，必须进行检查以确保事情步入正轨并且组织正在按计划执行。有时，首席执行官将自己的角色描述为教练，教育员工，提供建设性反馈，帮助提高绩效，但实际上几乎没有采取任何行动来影响正在讨论的最终决策。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;通过亲自监督决策过程，首席执行官标准、鼓励协调并实现路线修正。在某些情况下，首席执行官可能会定期与团队会面以监控进展情况。在其他情况下，他们可能只是偶尔检查以确保事情步入正轨。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;监控决策过程时的一个关键选择是首席执行官希望参与的高度或粒度级别。首席执行官可以选择高层参与或深入研究细节。一些首席执行官提前设定了这些高度期望；其他人则实时战略性地选择他们，以保持团队的警惕性，并准备好在他们选择的任何高度与他们交战。尽管团队可能会觉得这种情况不一致或不可预测，但想象一下自己处于这样的位置：如果您知道首席执行官可能会提出从大局到最本质细节的问题，您是否可以为一系列会议做更彻底的准备？&lt; /p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;做出决策&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;对于某些事务，例如设定公司的整体绩效目标，CEO 可能是主要决策者，选择在提出一系列建议后做出最后决定。在其他情况下，首席执行官可能会选择与一小群关键高管和董事会成员进行磋商，例如在并购交易中，或在选择高层管理团队成员时。在其他情况下，例如制定业务部门的战略，首席执行官可能会让其他人（例如业务部门负责人）做出决策，然后批准这些决策。 In yet other circumstances, such as deciding which R&amp;amp;D projects the company should pursue, although the CEO may participate at some stage to better understand the choices under consideration, the CEO may delegate the final decision to a senior manager such as the head of R&amp;amp;D, because the CEO may lack the technical expertise to weigh in.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Factors to Consider in Choosing How Much to be Engaged&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;CEOs often use various criteria to determine the level of personal involvement they have across the decision-making landscape. These include the decision&#39;s strategic importance: Does it matter for the CEO&#39;s key priorities and have long-term implications for the company&#39;s direction, vision, or mission? High-level strategy decisions almost always warrant the CEO&#39;s direct engagement. Other factors that may influence the CEO&#39;s involvement include the decision&#39;s impact on the company&#39;s financial health, either in terms of revenue, costs, or profitability; or the risk associated with the decision, either in terms of potential loss, legal implications, or harm to the company&#39;s reputation. If a decision involves the allocation or reallocation of significant resources — like capital investments or human resources — it may warrant CEO oversight.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;CEOs may also factor the extent to which the decision impacts the company&#39;s core values and ethics. Any decision that could challenge or redefine these values require greater CEO involvement. Decisions that set a precedent for future company actions or policies often also require CEO engagement.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If a decision spans across multiple segments of the organization or has the potential to lead to significant internal disagreement or conflict, the CEO should get more involved and consider making the final call. Decisions that will notably impact key stakeholders — including shareholders, major customers, regulators — might also draw the CEO&#39;s attention. Urgent decisions, especially those that must be made rapidly to address immediate challenges or capitalize on opportunities, may warrant the CEO&#39;s prompt attention.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although CEOs tend to focus on these more significant decisions, some CEOs wisely note that they find benefit from periodically involving themselves directly in decision-making on smaller issues or at lower levels in the organization. For example, the CEO may engage with some decisions far removed from the top, such as the strategy for a fledgling business unit or the design of an executive development program, because they want to signal its importance to the company. These symbolic opportunities for engagement can be just as important as the more substantive matters that warrant the CEO&#39;s involvement.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Decision-making isn&#39;t the only activity in which a CEO must make conscious choices about the right level of personal involvement. CEOs must be strategic about when to personally engage with customers, investors, regulators, the media, and other stakeholders. They must decide which senior roles require an interview with the CEO as part of the hiring process. They must decide when and how often to engage with individual directors in one-on-one conversations between full board meetings. Making the right choices about the level of personal involvement is key to a CEO&#39;s overall effectiveness.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In conclusion, the role of the CEO is not about making every decision, but rather about creating an environment in which decisions are made effectively. By shaping decisions rather than making them, CEOs empower their teams, foster agility, and drive the organization toward success. The CEO is more of a conductor, orchestrating the many parts to produce harmonious results, than a dictator issuing commands. It&#39;s a shift in perspective that is required when leaders assume this pinnacle position and can be transformative for many leaders and organizations alike.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 13 Sep 2023 20:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[How AI Can Help Cut Energy Costs While Meeting Ambitious ESG Goals - SPONSOR CONTENT FROM SCHNEIDER ELECTRIC]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/sponsored/2023/09/how-ai-can-help-cut-energy-costs-while-meeting-ambitious-esg-goals]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;html>; &lt;head>;&lt;/head>; &lt;body>; &lt;figure>; &lt;img aria-describedby=&quot;caption-attachment-0&quot; src=&quot;/resources/images/article_assets/2023/08/GettyImages-updated-1024x576.png&quot; >; &lt;/figure>; &lt;p>;Rising and volatile energy prices, fueled in part by geopolitical conflicts, are putting business leaders under urgent pressure to cut costs. Energy is eating up an increasing share of corporate budgets, leaving less funding for innovation and growth.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, consumers, investors, and regulators increasingly expect companies to embrace environmental, social, and governance (ESG) principles and speed up with factual decarbonization. In most industries, thriving in the long term requires urgent progress on ESG. Many enterprises have set ambitious goals for reducing their carbon footprints but are struggling to achieve them.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Artificial intelligence (AI) is changing that today, helping companies optimize energy consumption, deploy renewable energy sources, and manage infrastructure for EVs. With the proper AI technology and energy expertise, any organization with sufficient digitization experience and infrastructure can tap the potential of AI to reduce operating costs while moving the needle on sustainability.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“If we want to &#39;decarbonate&#39; the planet, we need industries to electrify much more, to be more efficient, to use less energy, and to create less waste,” says Philippe Rambach, SVP and Chief Artificial Intelligence Officer of Schneider Electric. “That requires a combination of digitization and AI to optimize our processes.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;The Power of AI &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Addressing the twin challenges of energy and sustainability can be challenging: companies need to integrate renewable energy efficiently while ensuring reliable power, but renewable energy sources produce an inconsistent supply that changes with shifting environmental conditions. Such measures as introducing a fleet of EVs requires businesses to manage demand, expand grid capacity, and install charging infrastructure while accounting for energy costs and grid stability.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;AI is critical for addressing these obstacles at scale, drawing on massive volumes of data—more than humans could reasonably process—to reveal patterns of energy use and areas of inefficiency. Using AI can help companies incorporate renewable power sources, manage better decisions about EV charging infrastructure, and reach their sustainability objectives, all while cutting energy costs.&lt;/p>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div id=&quot;DFP_IC_pos3&quot;>; &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;>;if (isAdobeSync()) googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(&quot;DFP_IC_pos3&quot;); });&lt;/script>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;As more companies become “prosumers”—both consuming and producing energy—the combination of Big Data and AI can help them use energy efficiently and pivot in real time.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;AI and the Future of Energy Management &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Despite the best intentions, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2018-02-13-gartner-says-nearly-half-of-cios-are-planning-to-deploy-artificial-intelligence&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;>;85% of AI projects are projected to fail&lt;/a>;. Successful AI implementation requires organizations to use custom-made solutions that integrate seamlessly into existing operations and processes. And beyond technology, these organizations also need external domain expertise on AI, energy management, and industrial automation from a partner with extensive experience.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Innovations in three cases illustrate the potential of AI to help organizations curb energy use and promote sustainability.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;em>;1. A Carbon-Neutral Distribution Center&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The 40-year-old supermarket chain Lidl operates approximately 12,000 grocery stores and more than 200 distribution centers in 31 countries.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.se.com/ww/en/work/campaign/life-is-on/case-study/lidl-finland.jsp&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;>;The company opened a distribution center&lt;/a>; with Finland&#39;s largest industrial microgrid, hosting 1,600 solar panels and a battery storage system that lightens the load on the national power grid. Its advanced heating and cooling system stores excess heat to reuse in cold weather and provides hot water to around 500 households.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Using AI-enabled forecasts and optimization, the center operates on 100% renewable energy and has reduced its energy costs by 70%.&lt;/p>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div id=&quot;DFP_IC_pos4&quot;>; &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;>;if (isAdobeSync()) googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(&quot;DFP_IC_pos4&quot;); });&lt;/script>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;&lt;em>;2. Energy Management for a Fleet of EVs&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Schneider Electric manages a large fleet of electric vehicles (EVs) at its headquarters outside Paris. The sheer scale of this fleet could disrupt the smooth operation of the building if all the EVs were charged at the same time.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To address this issue, the company uses an energy-management solution that monitors such critical factors as power availability, weather conditions, and energy sources to prevent power surges during charging peaks and to generate, distribute, and manage power from multiple sources.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the heart of this approach is the Edge Control component, which optimizes the distribution of power to EVs in real time and maintains a balance between charging needs and available power, using cloud-based AI-driven analytics.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;By accounting for such variables as power demand and weather conditions, the analytics ensures optimal power distribution to the building from various energy sources in a microgrid. The result is significant building power efficiency and a marked reduction in carbon footprint.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;em>;3. Transforming a Factory in Northern France&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Renault Group, the French car manufacturer, set the ambitious goal of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.se.com/ww/en/work/campaign/life-is-on/case-study/sf6free-renault.jsp&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;>;achieving a negative carbon balance&lt;/a>; at its plant in Flins, France, by 2030. To do so, the automaker installed environmentally friendly switchgear and smart sensors that enabled forecasting and remote monitoring of equipment and outages. As a result, the factory has reduced costs and made advances on its sustainability objectives.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Enabling Sustainability and Innovation&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The transition to renewable energy cannot happen without AI. But every organization has its own needs and objectives, and implementing the latest off-the-shelf AI technology may not be enough to achieve them.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Schneider Electric&#39;s Rambach says, “Small additional investments in AI solutions in energy optimization and industrial automation can unlock the value of the large investments companies have already made in the cloud and in data gathering.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Implementing AI can help companies slash energy spending and operate sustainably. Tackling these complex challenges by combining AI with human expertise can have an impact far beyond the organizations leading these efforts.&lt;/p>; &lt;hr>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;&lt;em>;&lt;a href=&quot;http://se.com/ai&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;>;Discover AI solutions&lt;/a>; with Schneider Electric.&lt;/em>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;/body>; &lt;/html>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 13 Sep 2023 01:25:01 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[How AI Is Transforming the Field of Radiology - SPONSOR CONTENT FROM SIEMENS HEALTHINEERS]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/sponsored/2023/09/how-ai-is-transforming-the-field-of-radiology]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;html>; &lt;head>;&lt;/head>; &lt;body>; &lt;figure>; &lt;img aria-describedby=&quot;caption-attachment-0&quot; src=&quot;/resources/images/article_assets/2023/08/Visual_AI-Rad-Companion_HBR_Advertorial_092023-1024x576.png&quot; >; &lt;/figure>; &lt;p>;In the realm of radiology, Austrian provider Diagnostikum&lt;strong>;[1]&lt;/strong>; stands at the forefront of delivering exceptional patient care through cutting-edge technologies. Lead by Priv.-Doz. Dr. P. Brader, Diagnostikum in Linz, Austria, serves as a testing ground for evaluating new products before they are adopted at other sites that belong to the radiology service provider. Among these innovations, the AI-Rad Companion Chest CT&lt;strong>;[2]&lt;/strong>;, an AI solution in chest CT imaging, has been in use at Diagnostikum since 2021. Tackling the challenges posed by increasing complexity, high workload, and staff shortages, Diagnostikum harnesses the power of artificial intelligence (AI) to automate a number of tasks in the field of radiology.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Siemens Healthineers, an innovation pioneer in radiology for over a century, is continuously evolving its AI solutions, with the AI-Rad Companion taking center stage. This advanced tool employs deep learning algorithms to automate various tasks in chest CT, providing support to radiologists. As part of the AI-Rad Companion product family, the Chest CT module is a cloud-based solution, seamlessly integrating with different digital radiology systems and picture-archiving solutions (PACS) used by radiology providers.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In his role as a key opinion leader and pioneer in the field of AI, Priv.-Doz. Dr. Brader, an early adopter of the AI-Rad Companion Chest CT, attests to its clinical value. The software becomes an integral part of the imaging value chain, efficiently processing CT examinations of the chest. Upon receiving the DICOM images, the AI algorithms instantly begin processing, delivering the results directly to the radiologist&#39;s reading environment enhancing the radiologist&#39;s ability to access and interpret the results with ease. Nevertheless, if desired by an institution, the results can be reviewed prior sending to the PACS.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At Diagnostikum, the AI-Rad Companion Chest CT has a significant impact on patient preparation, the CT scan process, and the reading and reporting of chest CT cases. One remarkable benefit is observed in patients requiring evaluation of the thoracic aorta to detect conditions like aortic ectasia or aneurysm. Traditionally, these patients underwent contrast-enhanced chest CT, involving numerous preparatory steps such as creatinine level assessment, IV line placement, selection of dedicated scan protocols and preparation of contrast injector. As AI-Rad Companion Chest CT supports also non-contrast enhanced CT images, these additional steps could be avoided, streamlining the entire process. Using specific deep-learning algorithms, the software accurately detects landmarks on the thoracic aorta, measures diameters, and generates 3D images, as well as DICOM SR, and DICOM images with quantification results, facilitating better disease progression monitoring.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;By using the AI-Rad Companion Chest CT, Diagnostikum experiences several key benefits throughout the patient pathway:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;1) Patient preparation: &lt;/strong>;Without the requirement for contrast media, patients no longer need to undergo creatinine tests, saving time and avoiding extra visits. Furthermore, this approach may have positive implications for kidney health, eliminating the risk of allergic reactions or extravasation.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;2) Scan preparation:&lt;/strong>; Radiographers are spared the task of preparing the IV line and contrast injector, allowing for a smoother workflow. Patients can move efficiently from the waiting room to the scan room, reducing the overall preparation time and giving radiographers more time to focus on essential tasks.&lt;/p>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div id=&quot;DFP_IC_pos3&quot;>; &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;>;if (isAdobeSync()) googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(&quot;DFP_IC_pos3&quot;); });&lt;/script>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;3) Scan execution:&lt;/strong>; The AI-Rad Companion Chest CT simplifies the scan process by processing data from standard chest CTs, eliminating the need for gated or triggered scan modes. The default scan protocol adheres to the ALARA principle, ensuring low-dose imaging while saving time for radiographers who would otherwise spend considerable time on reconstruction and 3D reconstructions.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;4) Reading and reporting:&lt;/strong>; With automated processing and immediate results pushed to the PACS system, radiologists, like Priv.-Doz. Dr. Brader, benefit from increased efficiency and accuracy. The standardized method for calculating diameters ensures objective longitudinal comparisons, contributing to high-quality reports that enhance the institution&#39;s reputation.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Incorporating deep-learning solutions like the AI-Rad Companion Chest CT has transformed the customer experience at Diagnostikum in Linz, showcasing how AI supports medical experts in their daily routines. The comprehensive and user-friendly capabilities of the AI-Rad Companion have elevated the efficiency of radiological processes, benefiting both patients and medical professionals alike.&lt;/p>; &lt;h5>;[1] The statements by Siemens Healthineers&#39; customers described herein are based on results that were achieved in the customers&#39; unique setting.

They incorrectly believe that a higher number of shares translates into superior compensation even when it doesn&amp;#8217;t. Five steps can help you avoid this mistake.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/when-it-comes-to-compensation-more-equity-isnt-always-better?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/when-it-comes-to-compensation-more-equity-isnt-always-better?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;Startups frequently compensate employees through a blend of cash and equity, such as stock options or restricted stock units, which may translate into ownership stakes. For prospective employees, assessing job offers with equity components can prove to be a complicated task. In fact, in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/jleo/advance-article/doi/10.1093/jleo/ewad017/7232738&quot;>;recent research study&lt;/a>; we found a clear and consistent pattern among participants evaluating offers that included equity compensation: They appeared to perceive that a higher number of shares translated into superior compensation. This led them to be more willing to sacrifice cash compensation when offered a larger quantity of shares, even when the underlying value remained the same. Call it the equity illusion.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When making an offer that includes an equity grant, a startup may propose a specific number of options, but current US regulations don&#39;t require private firms to reveal the total number of shares outstanding. So while potential employees may know the quantity of options offered, they often have no insight into the actual ownership stake those options represent. It&#39;s akin to an employer declaring, “We&#39;ll pay you 100,000,” leaving you to wonder whether that&#39;s in dollars, euros, yen, or yuan. In the same vein, comparing job offers from different startups based solely on the number of securities in their equity packages turns the decision-making process into an exercise in comparing apples with oranges — which can lead you to make an unwise career decision.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To find out how savvy workers are at understanding equity compensation, we ran an experiment with more than 1,000 American workers with STEM degrees, a demographic often drawn to startup opportunities. Indeed, 15% of those surveyed had experience in earning equity compensation in the past.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We presented participants with hypothetical compensation packages from a startup. These packages consisted of varying amounts of cash and equity shares, with the explicit notation that the shares represented a 0.5% stake in the hypothetical company.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Our findings indicated that participants were more inclined to forgo cash in favor of equity, when the equity proposal included a larger quantity of shares despite the consistent value of the shares across different scenarios in our study. For instance, when given the choice of surrendering $10,000 from their cash compensation for 1,000 shares, 74% of respondents chose the shares. When the same equity stake was presented as 50,000 shares for the identical $10,000 concession, the preference for the equity grant increased to 81%. In a similar vein, 60% of the respondents were willing to forgo $30,000 in exchange for 1,000 shares, but this figure rose to 64% when the equity was offered as 50,000 shares.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We followed up this experiment with a survey to gauge the respondents&#39; comprehension of startup equity compensation offers. We designed a set of questions aimed at assessing their financial literacy in this area, probing their understanding of key aspects such as stock option value, liquidation preferences (which determine the order in which shareholders will be paid upon a company&#39;s exit or liquidation), and the risk levels associated with investment in restricted stock versus stock options —&amp;nbsp;all vital components in the evaluation of equity compensation packages.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The results were illuminating but disconcerting. Nearly 44% of those surveyed were unable to correctly answer a single question related to startup equity compensation; a scant 5% answered all questions correctly. Perhaps more alarming was the overconfidence among participants; though given the option to admit they didn&#39;t know the answer, they selected the incorrect answers. For example, on a question evaluating understanding of how liquidation preferences might affect employee equity value, only 18% answered correctly, a mere 16% conceded they didn&#39;t know, and the rest — nearly 66% — answered erroneously.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Despite this pervasive lack of equity financial literacy, a troubling complacency emerged. Among those who had previously been offered equity, fewer than 25% reported that they had sought professional guidance in evaluating a proposal. This lack of initiative not only reflects a critical knowledge gap but also hints at potential missteps in navigating the intricate landscape of equity compensation, where equity illusions seem to hold sway.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To avoid falling prey to equity illusions, here are five things you can do:&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;1. Educate yourself.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Before accepting an offer involving equity compensation, you should deepen your knowledge of the core concepts of equity. Understand how exercise prices impact the value of stock options, how liquidation preferences influence employee options, and how stock options and restricted stock units differ. Most importantly, realize that the number of shares offered by a startup doesn&#39;t necessarily correspond to the grant&#39;s economic value.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;2. Ask questions.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;While current US regulations do not require private firms to fully disclose information from their capitalization tables, you should ask prospective employers questions that can help you evaluate equity compensation offers. Ask about the company&#39;s financing history and capital structure. Understanding how much money has been raised and its implications can help in decision-making. Similarly, inquire about what percentage of ownership the equity grant represents. Look also for relevant benchmarks in the industry. A company refusing to share this information could be a red flag.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;3. Think about the costs of equity compensation.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Evaluate the specifics of the investment required. It is essential to multiply the exercise price by the number of options in the grant to determine the amount required to purchase the shares. If options aren&#39;t exercised, they can expire, becoming worthless. Thus, decide if the financial commitment aligns with your personal financial goals. For some, a compensation package with a higher cash salary might be preferable if the financial commitment seems daunting.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;4. Consider complications that would arise if the startup stays private longer.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Startups are increasingly staying private for longer periods, which can delay financial benefits from stock options for employees. Those leaving the company typically have only 90 days to decide whether to exercise these options or forfeit them.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some employees might receive restricted stock units (RSUs) instead of traditional stock options. While RSUs don&#39;t require immediate out-of-pocket costs, they might expire if the company doesn&#39;t go public within seven years.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Moreover, as startups continue to raise money in the private capital market, they undergo multiple funding rounds, each adding layers of complexity to their capital structure. This affects employee equity&#39;s potential value. Joining a maturing startup may also mean facing higher costs for stock options, adding to the financial risk.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;5. Consult experts.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Even if you&#39;re confident in your grasp of equity&#39;s broad concepts, seeking expert opinions can provide nuanced insights into specific equity offers, helping you make well-informed decisions.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Becoming well-versed in equity is not merely about understanding finances; it&#39;s pivotal for making informed career and investment decisions in the startup world. By gaining a comprehensive understanding of these intricate financial instruments, you can confidently navigate the startup equity landscape, transforming what might seem like an illusion into actual ownership.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 12 Sep 2023 22:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[5 Ways to Actually Move Forward on That Task You&rsquo;ve Been Avoiding]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/09/5-ways-to-actually-move-forward-on-that-task-youve-been-avoiding]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/09/Sep23_12_1471373623.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;Olga Rolenko/Getty Images&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;It&amp;#8217;s human nature to procrastinate &amp;#8212; but it can be devastating for your future goals if you continually procrastinate on projects that are important but not urgent. In this article, the author offers five strategies to overcome procrastination on ambiguous but essential tasks: 1) Get clear on the vision. 2) Identify concrete steps. 3) Take (small) action. 4) Create forcing functions. 5) Limit competing distractions.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/5-ways-to-actually-move-forward-on-that-task-youve-been-avoiding?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/5-ways-to-actually-move-forward-on-that-task-youve-been-avoiding?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;Every professional occasionally drags their feet on certain projects. It&#39;s easy to put off tedious tasks, like filing expense reports, or emotionally draining ones, like writing up a negative employee performance review. Indeed, &lt;a href=&quot;https://compass.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/spc3.12011&quot;>;research has shown&lt;/a>; that procrastination — rather than being a moral failing or sign of laziness — is actually a subconscious strategy to avoid negative emotions.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One of the most common reasons we procrastinate is that certain projects may feel ambiguous or amorphous. We become overwhelmed because we just aren&#39;t sure what to do or where to start, leading to “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/12/well/mind/task-paralysis.html&quot;>;task paralysis&lt;/a>;.” As I discuss in my book &lt;a href=&quot;https://dorieclark.com/longgame/&quot;>;&lt;em>;The Long Game&lt;/em>;&lt;/a>;, that can derail our efforts to make progress on long-term goals, even while we fill our time with what we recognize as comparatively trivial matters. If you find yourself repeatedly ignoring a particular line item on your to-do list, even when it may be critical for your future success, here are five things you can do.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Get clear on the vision&lt;/strong>;.&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Especially if a particular project has been handed to you by a manager or colleague — “write this grant proposal” or “research this opportunity” — it may be unclear what they&#39;re actually looking for. Do they want a 20-page deep dive or a one-page summary? An analysis you can present to the board or your quick take? In the midst of our “freeze response,” we may not even realize we&#39;re unclear on the scope, so it&#39;s important to go back to first principles. What, precisely, are you being asked to do? What is the desired output, and how long do you estimate it will take? Clarifying the intention can often help get us unstuck.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Identify concrete steps&lt;/strong>;.&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Even when you&#39;re clear on the vision — or if you&#39;re pursuing your own — it may not be self-evident how to get to your desired destination. Especially if you&#39;re tackling something you&#39;ve never done before (such as launching a new product), you may have a to-do list brimming with possible activities, but feel uncertain which are the most critical, or in what order to pursue them. (&lt;em>;Conduct focus groups? Develop a prototype? Create a marketing plan? Test a pricing strategy?&lt;/em>;)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In those situations, it&#39;s useful to speak with colleagues who have done something similar in the past. If that&#39;s not an option, you might consider hiring a consultant with relevant expertise or carefully studying and reverse-engineering what others in your field have done in the past. You don&#39;t have to mirror their moves exactly — your innovations may turn out to improve on the norm — but being aware of past best (and worst) practices can help you develop an initial plan and make conscious choices about where you&#39;d like to deviate.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Take (small) action&lt;/strong>;.&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Ambiguous projects — because they&#39;re unclear — often feel enormous, so it makes sense they often get pushed to the back of the line. But &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdKUJxjn-R8&quot;>;as Stanford professor BJ Fogg has noted&lt;/a>;, taking even a tiny action creates positive momentum that makes it easier to complete the full task (just as flossing one tooth makes you realize it&#39;s not much more effort to floss your entire mouth, writing one paragraph of a progress report can propel you along into finishing it). Identifying a task you can accomplish, even if it&#39;s not the most strategic (such as sending an email or fixing the layout on a presentation deck), may disrupt your inertia and make it feel easier to return to the task in the future.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Create forcing functions.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;If you&#39;ve been procrastinating, it&#39;s probably clear that willpower alone won&#39;t suffice to motivate you (“&lt;em>;I&#39;ll definitely make it happen this Thursday&lt;/em>;”). Instead, build in “&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forcing_function&quot;>;forcing functions&lt;/a>;” for yourself to ensure your compliance. Just as hiring a personal trainer quasi-guarantees better exercise compliance (you&#39;ve already paid for the session and it would be rude to stand them up at the gym), you can set up accountability mechanisms for yourself, like scheduling a weekly check-in with your manager or a trusted colleague.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;You can even choose to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.caveday.org/&quot;>;virtually “cowork”&lt;/a>; with others to stay accountable for your progress on a given day; participants announce what they&#39;ll be working on at the outset of a session and report back at the end. You can also create your own “rules” to keep you moving forward. In the past, when I&#39;ve been on deadline, I would occasionally hole up at a café (so that being hungry or thirsty was no excuse) and wouldn&#39;t permit myself to leave until I&#39;d finished.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Limit competing distractions&lt;/strong>;.&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;As humans, our minds are wired to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/global/2021/aug/22/how-digital-media-turned-us-all-into-dopamine-addicts-and-what-we-can-do-to-break-the-cycle&quot;>;seek out dopamine hits&lt;/a>;, including the “thrill” of reading and responding to messages that hit our inbox and scrolling through new social media posts. No one thinks this is actually productive, yet it&#39;s devilishly hard for most of us to resist. Even if you&#39;ve taken the steps above to facilitate your work on a given project, it&#39;s still easy to be lured away, so it&#39;s important to proactively limit the distractions you face. Otherwise, you&#39;ll always be tempted to choose the quick hit of crossing off a minor to-do item (ordering your sandwich for the lunch meeting or checking to see how many LinkedIn connection requests you&#39;ve received), rather than diving into messier (and more amorphous) tasks that are meaningful.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Experiment to see what works for you; you might try keeping your phone in another room, using software to limit your access to certain websites, or even using a computer that&#39;s not connected to the Internet in order to make progress on in-depth writing projects.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It&#39;s human nature to procrastinate — but the stakes vary widely. While it&#39;s suboptimal to let your inbox fester or delay filling out certain administrative forms, it can be devastating for your future goals if you continually procrastinate on projects that are &lt;a href=&quot;https://todoist.com/productivity-methods/eisenhower-matrix&quot;>;important but not urgent&lt;/a>;. By following these strategies to overcome procrastination on ambiguous but essential tasks, you can become a better &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LF-7ijPLv5g&quot;>;long-term thinker&lt;/a>; — and doer.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 12 Sep 2023 21:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Is Organizational Hierarchy Getting in the Way of Innovation?]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/09/is-organizational-hierarchy-getting-in-the-way-of-innovation]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/09/Sep23_12_organizational-hierarchy.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;Illustration by Klawe Rzeczy&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;Technological advances and increasingly sophisticated ways of gathering and analyzing data are changing both the kinds of products and services companies can offer&amp;#160;&lt;em>;and&amp;#160;&lt;/em>;are increasing competitive pressures. To meet the moment, this article argues that organizations may need to change the way they operate to innovate. Specifically, the authors suggest that companies should consider a version of RenDanHeYi. They outline the four key elements of this model and offer suggestions for whether, and how, to implement elements of it.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/is-organizational-hierarchy-getting-in-the-way-of-innovation?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/is-organizational-hierarchy-getting-in-the-way-of-innovation?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;An RV rolling through a parking lot in Louisville, Kentucky, does not normally turn heads.&amp;nbsp; But this case was different. The geometric beige patterns that typically adorn RVs had been boldly wrapped over by the corporate colors and logo of GE Appliances (GEA). And the RV was driving not into a public lot, but onto the tarmac of GEA&#39;s corporate headquarters during a company-wide event.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In its nearly 120 years of existence — having built everything from air conditioners, refrigerators, and washing machines to microwaves, ovens, and trash compactors — GEA had never intentionally targeted the RV market. Its products were made for stationery use in homes, offices, and commercial spaces.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The RV was a rallying cry from two GEA employees to change that. They saw a promising growth opportunity for the company. RV ownership in the US had been &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rvia.org/media-resources#:~:text=11.2%20million%20U.S.%20households%20now,Boomers%20who%20are%20entering%20retirement&quot;>;steadily growing&lt;/a>; for over a decade and the employees felt GEA&#39;s experience building and selling appliance technology — such as air conditioning, refrigerators and microwaves — could translate into a competitive position for the company to sell AC units, refrigerators, and other appliances into the RV market. They had created what GEA, and its parent company Haier, call a “microenterprise” — a small, autonomous business unit, comprised of a handful of internal entrepreneurs, who are able to take action on ideas they are passionate about that they think could become valuable businesses.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;That the employees had the autonomy within their role to take this kind of action is surprising enough. But perhaps even more astonishing is the fact that they didn&#39;t need to go through arduous steps standard in most organization to get permission, like putting together a business case or detailed financial projections for their idea. They just got on with it, starting small, with the company providing just enough funding to allow them to start testing their idea.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This approach is just one of many examples of decentralized organizational models that GEA, and a growing number of other companies, are adopting — models that run in direct conflict with the hierarchical tendencies of nearly most companies today.&lt;/p>; &lt;article-promo>; &lt;hbr-component type=&quot;promo&quot; is-insight=&quot;insight-center&quot; title=&quot;The New Age of Operations&quot; dek=&quot;Improving efficiency and increasing resilience.&quot; cta-text=&quot;&quot; href=&quot;/insight-center/the-new-age-of-operations&quot;>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/insight-center/the-new-age-of-operations&quot; style=&quot;color:black;text-decoration:none&quot;>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; Insight Center Collection &lt;/div>; &lt;h3>;The New Age of Operations&lt;/h3>; &lt;div>; Improving efficiency and increasing resilience. &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hbr-component>; &lt;/article-promo>; &lt;p>;In this article, we explore why and how these new models are surfacing, looking specifically at how emerging technologies have created a tipping point for the shift to more competitive alternatives to the traditional firm. We share the findings of our research, which looks at the move towards decentralization and identifies the key characteristics of one the most successful and promising models. And we provide practical advice on how companies who want to keep ahead of the curve can start adapting their organizational designs.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;The Rise of New Organizational Models&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Over the past few decades, there has been much debate about the demise of traditional hierarchical structures. The consensus appears to be that while bureaucracy still has a place in some circumstances, it is increasingly becoming less fit for the needs of today&#39;s businesses.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So, what exactly brought us to this point? Technology has, of course, been a major factor. Robotics, automation, and 3D printing are enabling companies to develop and launch new products faster and more economically, and in ever smaller quantities than before.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Further, the broader adoption of the internet of things (IoT) to produce data, blockchain and APIs to share data, and analytical and AI capabilities to understand the data, are enabling companies to test both product and internal ideas more rapidly, frequently, and with lower cost and risk.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Much of the attention around these advances has focused on the new possibilities they are opening up in the market. But the internal organizational implications are at least as profound. New and emerging technologies are making it possible for organizations to evolve into new ways of organizing and acting by pushing the boundaries of what technology can enable. But this potential will only be realized if firms are prepared to adapt and embrace them enthusiastically.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Historically, organizations have attempted to do this by experimenting with a range of alternative approaches: a team of teams (small independent teams with an overarching umbrella team), an open organization (communities of people with a common purpose and no top-down hierarchy) and &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/07/beyond-the-holacracy-hype&quot;>;Holocracy&lt;/a>;, to name a few. But most have proved inadequate, with no clear front runner emerging.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Our research shows, however, that the defining design elements of a winning new organizational model are coming into focus: &lt;a href=&quot;/2018/11/the-end-of-bureaucracy&quot;>;RenDanHeYi&lt;/a>;, or a version of it, which was introduced by Haier. This organizational philosophy and system is composed of several innovative characteristics, including the breaking of large hierarchical units into “microenterprises” (MEs), turning support functions into profit centers that must sell into the enterprise rather than cost centers, and relating to employees as intrapreneurs.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Companies who embrace four elements of this approach in particular are significantly outperforming their peers. GEA, for example, has doubled its business organically in the last four years, according to GAE CEO Kevin Nolan. We believe we are on the brink of a seismic shift, where companies are waking up to the fact this new model offers them the opportunity not just to adapt, but to substantially replace their hierarchical, bureaucratic perspective with something radically different.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;The Four Elements of the New Organizational Model&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Over the past eight years, we have been conducting a research study into the barriers within organizations to internal innovation and the emergence of new organizational models that address these barriers. Over the course of the study, we spoke to over 150 employee innovators, discussed the topic with around 100 heads of strategy from mid-to-large enterprises. These enterprises include financial services, media, technology, pharmaceuticals, real estate, professional services, NGOs, education, and infrastructure firms. Most are large ($1 billion to $60 billion revenue), and about 20% are mid-sized ($100 million to $900 million revenue). We interviewed around 20 of today&#39;s leading authorities on this topic (Rita McGrath, Michael Tushman, and Martin Lindstrom to name just a few). And we conducted a quantitative survey of around 500 mid-level managers and interviewed experts on the key defining characteristics of Haier&#39;s RenDanHeYi model.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Two clear, overarching messages emerged from an in-depth analysis of this wealth of data and interviews.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First, that firms are gradually becoming less centralized — although their evolution towards decentralization has been a slow and nonlinear process.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Second, there is clear and statistically significant evidence to show that companies who use elements of a looser RenDanHeYi model outperform their peers in terms of entrepreneurial activity, the ability to attract and retain top talent, and ultimately financial performance.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This research also brings into focus four clear&amp;nbsp;characteristics of these organizations, most of which replace their traditional hierarchy.&amp;nbsp;These characteristics are:&lt;/p>; &lt;ol>; &lt;li>;Treat employees like intrapreneurs&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Work in smaller independent units (MEs) rather than business units&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;“Manage” MEs&amp;nbsp;with decentralized marketplace structures rather than centralized authority&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Let MEs choose which support services (eg R&amp;amp;D, finance, IT) to&amp;nbsp;work with&lt;/li>; &lt;/ol>; &lt;p>;We describe these four characteristics below,&amp;nbsp;the advantages they bring, and some examples of how forward-thinking organizations are applying them.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Treat employees like intrapreneurs.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Our research showed that firms whose employees feel they are treated more like intrapreneurs enjoyed a level of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/entrepreneurial-intensity-freeonlinecourseswithcertificate/&quot;>;entrepreneurial intensity&lt;/a>; — the frequency and degree of innovation and risk that employees undertake — that was nearly 3x higher than their peers. They were also more likely to outperform their competition (1.4x) and were better and recruiting and retaining top talent (1.6x). Treating employees like intrapreneurs can involve rewarding proactive behavior, encouraging them to get close to customers, and celebrating ideas and even failed attempts at innovation.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;You only have to look at examples from corporate history to see how much potential has been missed by companies who have failed to give their employees the freedom to explore new opportunities.&amp;nbsp;As an employee at HP, Steve Wozniak, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.inc.com/melissa-chu/before-apple-was-born-steve-wozniak-begged-this-co.html&quot;>;for example&lt;/a>;, proposed the design that would become the first Apple computer and was turned down all five times.&amp;nbsp;How much more valuable would HP be today if it had given Wozniak a greenlight?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Embedding an intrapreneurial culture doesn&#39;t always have to mean the constant pursuit of new product ideas. MacMillan Learning, for example, recently held an innovation competition, where they invited employees to enter innovative projects they had been working on over the past year. More than 200 employees engaged with the competition, entering 46 projects — which helped to reinforce the message that staff were in fact already acting as internal intrapreneurs and, because most of the ideas were internal process and organizational innovations, entrepreneurial action need not always be market-facing.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Work in smaller independent units rather than larger traditional business units.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;In RenDanHeYi, employees &lt;a href=&quot;/2018/11/the-end-of-bureaucracy&quot;>;group together in microenterprises&lt;/a>;, which can range in size from five to 20 employees, to innovate around specific opportunities or challenges. GEA, for example, launched 14 MEs while its parent, Haier, is organized into thousands.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Our quantitative research showed that firms that adopt this type of organizational model were able to unleash greater entrepreneurial behavior (1.5x), achieve better financial performance relative to peers (1.3x), and were better at recruiting and retaining top talent (1.2x). When a group of Haier employees saw an opportunity to provide a one stop cooking solution for consumers, for example, they banded together to form their own microenterprise. The resulting Internet of Food microenterprise now covers everything from designing and installing “smart” cookers and fridges that recognize their owners, to providing precisely timed recipes and allowing users to interact with each other via smart screens on their cooker hoods.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;“Manage” MEs with decentralized marketplaces instead of centralized authority.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Our findings confirm that empowering units and teams to act with autonomy and make their own decisions is a powerful driver of entrepreneurial intensity.&amp;nbsp;Firms that do this enjoy over 2x higher entrepreneurial intensity rates.&amp;nbsp;They are also 1.5x better at recruiting and retaining top talent and enjoy a more marginal, but significant advantage in financial performance (1.3x).&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Dutch healthcare provider Buurtzorg, for example, has been able to provide better patient care by offering its nurses a high degree of autonomy.&amp;nbsp;Small, self-managed teams of nurses are able to work with patients in the way they think best, based on professional standards, with a back-office IT and support system around them to free them from paperwork and bureaucracy.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://assets.kpmg.com/content/dam/kpmg/pdf/2016/05/value-walks.pdf&quot;>;A recent KPMG study&lt;/a>; showed that by adopting this model of care, Buurtzorg has been able to halve the hours of care it delivers, while at the same time achieving high patient and nurse satisfaction scores.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Give MEs an option to choose which support services to use.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;This is perhaps the most interesting and radical characteristic of the model. In hierarchical models, it is assumed that business units use the shared services provided by the company in order to create cost advantages — think IT, finance, R&amp;amp;D, etc. GEA CEO Nolan refers to these support functions as internal monopolies which need to be broken up because they “can easily within a company become like a &#39;post office,&#39; where they feel there is no competition. There&#39;s a [sense of] entitlement: [because they are] going to deliver the mail for everyone, [the business units] have no choice.” Instead, he says, they should “have to fight for their business every day. They have to improve, they have to be the best.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What would this new approach to support services look like in practice? Let&#39;s say a particular microenterprise is not happy with the support it is getting from their IT department. Because all departments are microenterprises, there are multiple IT microenterprises to choose from. They compete with autonomy for internal clients. The initial microenterprise can even decide to contract with an external, third-party IT service provider, if they so choose. And if a supporting ME is not competitive enough to win internal clients, its budget is effectively reduced or cut not because a centralized authority decided to cut it, but because they couldn&#39;t succeed internally.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Our quantitative research shows fewer companies are adopting this practice compared to the other characteristics, perhaps because this implies a broad organizational redesign. But those who do enjoyed far higher levels of entrepreneurial intensity (2.1x) recruitment and retention (1.6x) and more marginal but significant advantage in financial performance (1.3x).&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;How to Implement the Four Elements&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;It&#39;s simplistic to think that the right approach to adopting a new organizational model is the same for each company or each area of your company. In some situations, hierarchical models will maintain the advantages they have enjoyed for hundreds of years. And even where a less hierarchical model is likely preferable, the degree to which you implement an alternative model will vary. To design the right approach for your specific case, consider taking three steps:&lt;/p>; &lt;ol>; &lt;li>;Decide where to consider implementing a new organizational approach&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Decide how deeply to implement and initiate first actions&lt;/li>; &lt;/ol>; &lt;h3>;Decide where to consider implementing a new organizational approach.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Sometimes, a more entrepreneurial, decentralized approach is not the best option. When you are building complex technology components on which rockets, airplanes, and spacecraft depend — components you designed, built, and tested to achieve extremely low failure rates — you don&#39;t want your engineers improvising. You instead want them following detailed, prescriptive checklists.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So, the first step to implementing our findings is to decide where you should consider implementing them. The most promising candidates will be those a) most impacted by emerging technologies and b) those which benefit from higher levels of entrepreneurial behavior. You can prioritize the top candidates by asking two questions:&lt;/p>; &lt;ol>; &lt;li>;Are advances in technology likely to open up new, more competitive approaches to organizing efforts?&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Does entrepreneurialism (eg, testing new approaches, working with agility) lead to success?&lt;/li>; &lt;/ol>; &lt;p>;You can think of these as a two-by-two matrix:&lt;/p>; &lt;div>; &lt;figure>; &lt;img aria-describedby=&quot;caption-attachment-363008&quot; src=&quot;/resources/images/article_assets/2023/08/W230821_KRIPPENDORFF_NEW_ORG_360.png&quot; >; &lt;/figure>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hbr.org/data-visuals&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;>;See more HBR charts in Data &amp;amp; Visuals &lt;i>;&lt;/i>;&lt;/a>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;Depending on where an area of the business sits on the matrix, you may want to embrace a different approach.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For those on the bottom left, maintaining a traditional, centralized, hierarchical model probably makes the most sense. Think of the engineers manufacturing&amp;nbsp;missiles or airplane propulsion systems.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the bottom right, you may want to encourage more entrepreneurialism, but not necessarily through tech-enabled changes. Rather, focus on traditional organizational tools like reporting structures, culture, storytelling, and hiring.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the top left, where you want the advantages technologies offer but do not need or want more entrepreneurialism, you may implement a digital products approach. For example, you might build an algorithm to dictate which candidate a recruiter should give a larger signing bonus to.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the top right, you&#39;ll find areas that are the most ripe for opportunity by using a new organizational model.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As you can see from this matrix, two reasons we are seeing more experimentation of new organizational approaches are that a) new technologies are advancing the matrix upward and b) the need for entrepreneurial behavior is increasing as the pace of change is accelerating across many sectors, pushing the matrix to the right.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Decide how deeply to implement and initiate first actions.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Once you decide where to implement a new approach, consider implementing the four elements in a sequence of four stages:&lt;/p>; &lt;ol>; &lt;li>;Treat employees like intrapreneurs&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Break down large units into smaller teams (MEs)&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Allow management of these smaller teams to be governed by internal supply and demand rather than centralized authority(eg, rather than centralizing all budgeting decisions, let microenterprises reinvest a portion of the profits they generate)&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Give these smaller teams freedom in deciding what central functions (eg, HR, IT, R&amp;amp;D) to work with&lt;/li>; &lt;/ol>; &lt;p>;This first step — treating employees like intrapreneurs — can be implemented with a change management or cultural transformation effort. Such efforts are not easy but there is already &lt;a href=&quot;/1995/05/leading-change-why-transformation-efforts-fail-2&quot;>;much known&lt;/a>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2020/03/building-a-culture-of-experimentation&quot;>;about&lt;/a>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2000/05/cracking-the-code-of-change&quot;>;how to do this&lt;/a>;. Using proven tactics such as rituals, leadership mirroring, storytelling, role titles, awards, office design, language, and symbols, a focused, coordinated effort can shift culture remarkably quickly.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Step two — breaking down units into microenterprises — can get complicated, as you must rethink reporting structures to pull smaller units out of larger units. But there is a good chance that your IT department has already implemented some form of smaller team-based approach having adopted “lean” or “scrum” approaches — and as those IT teams have interacted the business side, they too have started shifting toward teams at least as regards specific projects. Product and marketing teams may already be reorienting toward “&lt;a href=&quot;https://venturebeat.com/entrepreneur/what-the-heck-is-a-growth-team/&quot;>;growth teams&lt;/a>;” popularized by tech companies like AirBNB, Meta, and Uber. What is left to do is evolve such project teams into permanent team structures.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Step three — allowing management of small teams to be governed by a marketplace — adds an additional layer of complexity as you must untangle and redesign budgeting processes and performance management systems, as well as shift culture and leadership behaviors. This may seem a daunting task, but the first step is relatively straightforward: ensure that financial accounting practices allow the enterprise to measure the individual financial performance of product and customer segment teams. Some industries, such as consumer-packaged goods, are already structured to do so. They typically break down profit and loss by customer segment (a customer that buys a particular brand, through a specific channel, and in a defined geography). But other sectors, like banking, may require some untangling. Because they tend to track financial performance by product (eg, mortgages or wealth management) rather than customer (affluent, retired, etc.), value-destroying conflicts can emerge. A second step here is to start decentralize reinvestment so that teams get to keep more of the value they generate.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Finally, step four — giving smaller teams freedom in deciding what central functions to work with — requires cutting deeper into your organizational norms to redesign functional departments that have long operated essentially as utilities and cost-centers into entrepreneurial profit-centers. This involves applying steps 1, 2, and 3 above to your support functions.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To do this, first involve them in the wider cultural change effort so they too start seeing themselves as intrapreneurs. Second, restructure support functions into a team structures, which may feel less alien than one might expect because many of them — HR, Finance, R&amp;amp;D, and, to a lesser extent perhaps, legal — are likely already organized into teams that support specific business teams. For example, the general counsel of one major media company structured her organization into dedicated sub-teams that support radio, broadcast TV, streaming, etc. Third, adjust financial reporting to start creating separate profit and loss statements for each team and, what seems the biggest leap for companies considering this step, to allow business teams to determine to which support teams they want to work with. As a result, instead of using political levers to ask for better service (such as asking the head of legal to replace the lawyer supporting their team), the head of a microenterprise is given the direct authority to choose to spend their budget on a different support team (or in this case, a different legal team).&lt;/p>; &lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;. 。 .&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;The technologies that are coming to the fore are not only transforming the way firms go to market, but are also forcing companies to rethink the very way they operate. Bureaucracy — with its defining characteristics of hierarchy, clear lines of authority and division of labor into specialties — has been the dominant method of coordinating human effort over the past several centuries. But as IoT, AI and data analytics, blockchain, and a collection of related technologies take hold, new, more open models are emerging in some areas as more efficient alternatives.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Our research shows many of the organizations adopting elements of such open structures are experiencing higher levels of entrepreneurial behavior, are proving better at attracting and retaining top talent, and delivering superior financial performance as a result.&amp;nbsp;We also believe that there is a danger that those who don&#39;t adapt will get left behind.&amp;nbsp;Strategy thought leader Martin Reeves &lt;a href=&quot;https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/fighting-the-gravity-of-average-performance/&quot;>;points out&lt;/a>;, for example, that in our new data-driven, tech-enabled world, competitive advantage decays about 10 times faster than previously, making it imperative for companies to keep up with the game. And futures specialist Mark Esposito &lt;a href=&quot;https://outthinker.com/podcast/?wchannelid=jxermuwnpf&amp;amp;wmediaid=op55wp7cvi&quot;>;says&lt;/a>; firms that have not yet investigated new technologies need to be aware they are becoming ubiquitous, and if they don&#39;t get on board, they will get left behind.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Evolving into a new organizational model is not easy. It involves unlearning and deconstructing management norms, processes, structures. But our research suggests a company need not embark on an across-the-board transformation to start seeing the benefits. The real opportunity is to embrace the organizational power of new technologies and implement the more decentralized models they make possible selectively in areas of the organization where new technology and/or non-hierarchical models offer a more competitive approach.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 12 Sep 2023 20:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Why These Companies Are Choosing Collaboration Over Competition, For a Climate Resilient Future - SPONSOR CONTENT FROM GLOBAL SALMON INITIATIVE]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/sponsored/2023/09/why-these-companies-are-choosing-collaboration-over-competition-for-a-climate-resilient-future]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;html>; &lt;head>;&lt;/head>; &lt;body>; &lt;figure>; &lt;img aria-describedby=&quot;caption-attachment-0&quot; src=&quot;/resources/images/article_assets/2023/08/gsi-HBR-hero_1200x675-1024x576.jpg&quot; >; &lt;/figure>; &lt;p>;The global food system is facing the imperative to produce more with less, balancing the need to feed a growing population with the need to protect the environment and address climate change.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, business leaders face pressure from shareholders, regulators, and consumers to demonstrate progress on sustainability goals while continuing to meet financial targets.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Most organizations are taking on these challenges the traditional way: individually and competitively, seeking their own solutions as fast as they can. But there is growing realization that given the scale of the environmental issues society faces—including climate change, deforestation, and plastics pollution—this may not deliver the wide-scale change needed at the speed needed.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;That&#39;s why some future-forward leaders are using a different approach: collaboration. Working together offers the potential for organizations to expand capacity, share the costs of innovation, decrease risk-trialing multiple approaches, and increase the chance of finding solutions and adapting much faster.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The farmed-salmon sector has used this approach for the past decade, illustrating how a model of collaboration can enable change at speed and scale. Could this be the sort of transformation model the food sector needs to implement so it can address the vast nutrient and climate risks it faces?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;A Faster Path Toward Sustainability&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Aquaculture, or fish farming, offers huge potential in meeting a rising global demand for healthy, protein-rich foods without further exploiting wild fish populations and depleting natural resources such as fresh water and arable land. Fish farming also produces one of the lowest greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions among all farming of animal proteins.&lt;/p>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div id=&quot;DFP_IC_pos3&quot;>; &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;>;if (isAdobeSync()) googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(&quot;DFP_IC_pos3&quot;); });&lt;/script>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;Fish, and salmon specifically, is high in the omega-3 fatty acids associated with good brain and heart health, and it reduces nutrient deficiencies and the risk of cardiovascular disease.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The health factor is part of what makes aquaculture the fastest-growing food sector today. The average person eats twice as much seafood as people did 50 years ago, and global consumption will continue to grow. That makes it critical for fish farming to take place sustainably and responsibly, using resources more efficiently, reducing harm to the environment, and promoting a more climate-resilient food system.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2013, CEOs of salmon aquaculture companies from around the world formed the Global Salmon Initiative (GSI) to make the industry more sustainable. Recognizing their responsibility to advance the environmental performance of the sector, they chose to work together to pool their knowledge and resources to directly tackle the primary environmental challenges they faced.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;A Future-Forward Strategy&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Collaboration is not the default state in a business context. So how do you get CEOs to come to the table and work together? And what can we learn from this example that can be translated to a broader scale?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;GSI unites 15 salmon-farming companies, representing nearly half of global salmon-farming production, alongside key supply chain actors to work on highly targeted areas where they seek a common goal of improving sustainability. They have a narrow focus on areas where there is collective interest, the motivation to drive change, and clear boundaries on areas where the companies cannot work together in line with antitrust and competition laws—as these are competitors in every other frame of their businesses.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From operating in shared waters to facing the same environmental challenges—sourcing of feed ingredients, monitoring and mitigating disease risks, and increasingly, the impacts of a changing climate—these were common challenges each of the companies faced and they saw that only by working together could they implement meaningful change.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As a member, each company must commit time and financial resources to help advance GSI&#39;s goals, and each is held accountable to transparently report on their sustainability metrics every year.&lt;/p>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div id=&quot;DFP_IC_pos4&quot;>; &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;>;if (isAdobeSync()) googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(&quot;DFP_IC_pos4&quot;); });&lt;/script>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;While many companies voluntarily report on sustainability metrics, it is still uncommon for entire sectors to align on metrics, which makes it hard to compare them and see improvements. This alignment in reporting is crucial to the group&#39;s learning and development. Having initiated this model of open-access reporting for its members 10 years ago through an annual sustainability report, GSI recently launched a similar framework for GHG emissions, which generates clearer comparisons and, more importantly, identifies where companies can learn from each other when it comes to effective mitigations.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Within the GSI model, members continually return to the foundation of aligned data and knowledge sharing to support changes in operations. With their commitment to working with the widely acknowledged “gold standard” for certification in aquaculture—the Aquaculture Stewardship Council—and in monitoring the impacts of a changing climate on fish welfare, GSI&#39;s model of bringing companies and CEOs together is to find the common sustainability issues where each company is dependent on improving a shared ecosystem. At its core, this is an intuitive model that other sectors facing shared environmental challenges could easily replicate.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;GSI&#39;s model is founded on the premise that if you convene technically adept leaders, give them sufficient data, and allow them to discuss and share ideas, they are likely to find a solution—or at least open the door to new approaches.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One intended consequence of the GSI model is that collaboration doesn&#39;t stop at industry walls. Other stakeholders and nongovernmental organizations recognized GSI for its model of working together and setting clear goals with pragmatic plans by acting as a united voice and inviting both supporters and critics to guide GSI in the right direction. GSI has built partnerships with groups, including World Wildlife Fund (WWF), to develop industrywide improvement programs that strengthen the sector&#39;s environmental performance and credibility. Not all sectors succeed at using this multi-stakeholder approach, but the scale of current global challenges makes collaboration among industry, academia, environmental groups, and policymakers crucial in supporting sectors prioritizing the right initiatives and everyone working off the right information. The salmon sector has not always had many allies in different sectors, but GSI shows that through a commitment to open dialogue and partnership, it is possible to unite groups on a sustainable journey.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Embrace Pre-Competitive Collaboration &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;GSI calls the collective insight-sharing strategy of its salmon-farming member companies “pre-competitive collaboration”—a term that seems to be gaining traction in the aquaculture sector following the work of GSI. But now the question is how the benefits of collaboration can be expanded in other sectors.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Pre-competitive collaboration is especially effective in industries whose companies use shared resources or face shared challenges. “The private sector can&#39;t just say, &#39;I&#39;m doing my part and in my silo,&#39; without realizing they&#39;re part of a global system,” says Jason Clay, SVP, markets, and executive director, Markets Institute at WWF.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In a time when the global food system is facing mounting pressure, natural resources are being exhausted, and climate change is reaching critical mass, the planet can&#39;t afford to inch toward sustainability one enterprise at a time. Organizations need to embrace collaboration not as an idealistic buzzword, but rather as a critical strategy to make their businesses thrive for the long term.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If more organizations in more sectors embrace the pre-competitive collaboration model that&#39;s succeeding in salmon aquaculture, there is a stronger chance that humanity can make massive strides in our ability to feed the world with nutritious, climate-resilient food.&lt;/p>; &lt;hr>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;&lt;em>;Learn more about &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.globalsalmoninitiative.org/&quot;>;GSI&#39;s work&lt;/a>;.&lt;/em>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;/body>; &lt;/html>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 11 Sep 2023 23:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[How Tony&rsquo;s Chocolonely Created a Purpose-Driven (and Profitable) Supply Chain]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/09/how-tonys-chocolonely-created-a-purpose-driven-and-profitable-supply-chain]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/09/Sep23_11_1306504236.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;bfk92/Getty Images&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;Supply chains in commodity industries are often characterized by social and environmental abuse. In the cocoa industry, for example, the average farmer cultivates between three and five hectares to earn less than two dollars a day. It is an environment rife with social and environmental abuse. In this article, the authors look at the experience of Tony&amp;#8217;s Chocolonely, a Dutch chocolate brand founded in 2005, which set itself a mission to sell 100% slavery-free chocolate. They show how Tony&amp;#8217;s brought its supply chain partners together to create an altogether new paradigm in which all actors take responsibility for social impact. And it really works: Tony&amp;#8217;s profitably sells around $130 million worth of slavery-free chocolate bars in Western Europe and the US&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/how-tonys-chocolonely-created-a-purpose-driven-and-profitable-supply-chain?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/how-tonys-chocolonely-created-a-purpose-driven-and-profitable-supply-chain?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;Supply chains for many commodity products — such as cocoa, cotton, and sugar — are highly fragmented. In the case of cocoa, for example, most of which comes from West Africa, the raw product is produced by more than two million farmers, who supply a complex network of middlemen. With an average farm size of three to five hectares and an estimated income of less than two dollars a day, nearly all of these farmers live below the poverty line. It is an environment rife with social and environmental abuse.&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;Players in the cocoa business — and industries like it — are aware of the negative impacts but find it hard to respond, especially when under pressure to deliver cost-driven performance. Nobody wants child labor, for example, but everyone is locked into capturing value within the existing system. In this paradigm, actors are &lt;em>;alienated&lt;/em>; from each other in that they have no control over and take little interest in what other actors are doing — just so long as the price is right for them.&lt;/p>; &lt;article-promo>; &lt;hbr-component type=&quot;promo&quot; is-insight=&quot;insight-center&quot; title=&quot;The New Age of Operations&quot; dek=&quot;Improving efficiency and increasing resilience.&quot; cta-text=&quot;&quot; href=&quot;/insight-center/the-new-age-of-operations&quot;>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/insight-center/the-new-age-of-operations&quot; style=&quot;color:black;text-decoration:none&quot;>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; Insight Center Collection &lt;/div>; &lt;h3>;The New Age of Operations&lt;/h3>; &lt;div>; Improving efficiency and increasing resilience. &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hbr-component>; &lt;/article-promo>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;Taking a moral high ground — for example, by refusing to deal with supply chain counterparties who exploit children — risks their own livelihoods while achieving no improvement for the children, as there are always less-principled competitors ready to do business with the exploiters. Nor are the issues black-and-white; rural families on the poverty line with lots of children often have little choice but to put them to work or send them to work on plantations where they are highly likely to be exploited, even enslaved.&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;There are no easy answers to problems like this, but a business ecosystem will only produce positive social and environmental outcomes if the players involved can reinvent their supply chains so that individual actors in the system are no longer alienated from each other. In these new &lt;em>;resonating&lt;/em>; supply chains, as we call them, profit and social goals are closely intertwined and aligned rather than in conflict with one another.&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;But how can this kind of change be brought about if the players are alienated in the first place? To answer this question, we&#39;ll look at the experience of Tony&#39;s Chocolonely, a Dutch chocolate brand founded in 2005, which set itself a mission to sell 100% slavery-free chocolate. We&#39;ll show how Tony&#39;s brought its supply chain partners together to create an altogether new paradigm in which all actors take responsibility for social impact. And it really works: Tony&#39;s profitably sells around $130 million worth of slavery-free chocolate bars in Western Europe and the US&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Turn counterparties into partners&lt;/h2>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;There are economic advantages to supply chains that are fragmented and transactional as suppliers along the chain compete on price, quality, and availability. The consumer here is the prime beneficiary. But if social and environmental value are also required, players need to know and understand what the other players are doing. Without connections between players that provide each with an overall view of the value created by the system, social impact results are impossible to prove.&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;The first step in shifting the paradigm, therefore, is to invest time in getting to know all actors in the end-to-end supply chain, from market proposition to sourcing raw materials. Tony&#39;s quickly realized that many actors — notably the managers of farming co-ops in West Africa — did not feel part of the cocoa supply chain. After loading a truck at the collection point with bags full of cocoa beans, their involvement was over. They had no idea where the beans were going.&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;Tony&#39;s started including co-op managers in the oversight of their supply chain. They agreed upon annual planned production volumes with the co-ops and gave managers access to a shared digital open information platform tracking bean shipments and deliveries. Tony&#39;s also hosts a kick-off event for the annual supply cycle, which brings together farming co-ops, NGOs, and certification bodies along with representatives of other supply chain players including Tony&#39;s main chocolate producer, Swiss-based Barry Callebaut, and leading cocoa bean traders. The group reviews the previous season, aligns plans for the upcoming season, and discusses market risks and opportunities. These events serve to make the various stakeholders feel like partners in a system rather than anonymous counterparties.&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;This approach has made Tony&#39;s an attractive partner for co-ops in West Africa. In 2016, the company successfully onboarded ECAM, a reputed cooperative in Ivory Coast that had been supplying big chocolate companies for years. When Tony&#39;s shared its standard annual plan agreement with the co-op manager, she told them that she had never had a contract with, or received official commitments from, a cocoa buyer before.&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;Companies starting on this path have to expect road bumps. In 2020, Tony&#39;s encountered a case of structural fraud at one of its partner co-ops. The company took serious measures: It suspended purchases from the co-op for a year and required a change of the co-op management team. But they continued investing in the co-op and supported it in its attempt to regain &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fairtrade.net/news/sustainability-and-cocoa-views-from-a-few-leading-brands&quot;>;the Fairtrade certification&lt;/a>; it had lost. &lt;a href=&quot;https://tonyschocolonely.com/nl/en/annual-fair-reports/annual-fair-report-2019-2020&quot;>;Tony&#39;s communicated transparently&lt;/a>; about the situation online and in its annual reports, and in the following year it &lt;a href=&quot;https://tonyschocolonely.com/nl/en/annual-fair-reports/annual-fair-report-2020-2021&quot;>;resumed buying&lt;/a>; from the co-op.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>; Agree on responsible business practices&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;In transactional supply chains like the cocoa business, value creation may not necessarily receive financial reward. The quality and quantity of beans produced by West African farmers has not changed significantly in the past 30 years, yet &lt;a href=&quot;https://voicenetwork.cc/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2020-Cocoa-Barometer-EN.pdf&quot;>;the earnings of farmers have declined steadily&lt;/a>;, because a few dominant chocolate producers with market power have been able to capture much of the value of the beans from the farmers in order to lower the price of goods to the end users and increase profits for themselves.&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;Once a company has successfully fostered relationships across and between its supply chain partners, the anonymity between players has been removed, making it possible for the company to create consensus around responsible business practices. Tony&#39;s developed and committed itself to what it calls &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tonysopenchain.com/sourcing-principles&quot;>;Five Sourcing Principles&lt;/a>; aimed at helping cocoa farmers out of poverty and eliminating child labor.&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;The implementation of each principle is clearly defined and, where appropriate, supported by tools. For example, one of the principles is that Tony&#39;s develops long-term relationships with the co-ops it purchases from. This is specifically embodied in a five-year Memorandum of Understanding between the company and the co-op, which is agreed to after a one-year trial relationship based on an initial one-year agreement. Another principle is that all beans traded in the supply chain should be traceable, and to support that, Tony&#39;s has developed a tracking platform that its supply chain partners can use.&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://online.flippingbook.com/link/11305/4-5/&quot;>;Tony&#39;s principles have had tangible — and dramatic — results&lt;/a>;. In 2020–2021, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cocoainitiative.org/&quot;>;International Cocoa Initiative&lt;/a>; detected cases of child labor at just 4.4% of Tony&#39;s co-ops&#39; member farms, compared to instances at 52.8% of member farms in co-ops not partnering with Tony&#39;s, while the average income for farmers that have been in Tony&#39;s co-ops for three years more than doubled.&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;Tony&#39;s has taken its initiative a step further with&amp;nbsp;Open Chain, a collaboration platform bringing together industry players from the chocolate and other confectionery businesses. Companies participating in the initiative have to sign up to the Five Principles and must share knowledge, tooling, partners, infrastructure, and communications at cost price. Companies that have signed up include the ice cream maker Ben and Jerry&#39;s, which &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.confectioneryproduction.com/news/40701/ben-jerrys-joins-tonys-chocolonelys-open-chain-ethical-sourcing-celebrated-with-new-releases-from-both-companies/&quot;>;joined the platform in August 2022&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>; Share the data &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;When a company&#39;s communications on purpose and impact do not match operating realities, the credibility of the company is at stake. It might at first be given the benefit of the doubt, but eventually it must provide proof of impact, otherwise it will face &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ypulse.com/article/2022/11/08/3-brands-accused-of-greenwashing-in-western-europe/&quot;>;accusations of greenwashing&lt;/a>; or its social impact equivalent. At the same time, many companies&#39; marketing communications fail to recognize what the companies may actually be doing in terms of impact, which means they miss out on opportunities for obtaining impact price premiums.&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;Sharing data and examples with both internal and external stakeholders reduces both these risks. Together, they help the different supply chain players efficiently work together and feel connected to Tony&#39;s, to each other, and to the shared goal of eradicating child labor and reducing poverty.&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;Tony&#39;s invested early on in its information platform. Several years of development and testing different tools, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/chelseadavis/2019/03/31/this-company-is-using-blockchain-technology-to-eradicate-slavery-in-the-chocolate-industry/#7f14aa6e1407&quot;>;including a blockchain pilot&lt;/a>;, were needed to build the “Beantracker” we alluded to earlier, which organizes and tracks physical flows between supply chain actors and records farmer membership data, GPS farm size data, beans output, and productivity. These data are input for farmer coaching and other agronomic improvement programs. The tracker also holds the data triggering the issue of premium invoices from partner co-ops to Tony&#39;s. In addition, there is an Impact Dashboard that shares information about the social impact the new approach has on participating farmers. &lt;a href=&quot;https://tonyschocolonely.com/uk/en/other-stuff/reframed&quot;>;What comes back to Tony&#39;s&lt;/a>; are examples of children who are doing well at school and families who are now able to install basic sanitation in their homes.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>; Collaborate to achieve the common good&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;Traditionally, business prospers when companies compete — and businesses aren&#39;t sustainable unless they can compete effectively. But competition doesn&#39;t work so well for challenges like child labor or CO2 reduction.&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;Cocoa provides a case in point. During trips to Ghana and Ivory Coast, Tony&#39;s teams often encountered kids on plantations and on the dirt roads around villages. When asked where they had been, they always gave the same answer: “school,” even when the circumstances, location, or time and day of the week would make that highly unlikely.&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;The kids&#39; answers are the result of a decades-long ritual dance between cocoa buyers and cocoa-producing communities. Cocoa buyers don&#39;t want child labor in their chain, so when they find cases, the easiest way is to stop buying cocoa from those communities, thereby protecting their certifications. But the result is that cocoa-producing communities instruct their children to avoid answers that may lead to losing a buyer, thereby making the problem invisible.&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;This perverse outcome is precisely why competition fails in the face of challenges like child labor, which are by their nature common problems, requiring collaborative responses in which companies work together with competitors, suppliers, NGOs, and governments to educate consumers about social issues in product supply chains. Created in 2015, the International Cocoa Initiative&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cocoainitiative.org/our-work/operational-support/child-labour-monitoring-and-remediation-systems&quot;>;Child Labor Monitoring and Remediation System&lt;/a>; (CLMRS) provides a good example of what this can achieve. The ICI is a cocoa-industry-focused NGO initially set up by the Swiss food giant Nestlé, and since 2015, its CLMRS has been adopted by many chocolate companies as the standard child labor monitoring tool.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3 style=&quot;font-weight: 400; text-align: center;&quot;>;. 。 .&lt;/h3>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;This Tony&#39;s Chocolonely case shows that a even a relatively small brand operating in a commodity industry that produces negative social and environmental effects can successfully build an alternative ecosystem that lifts people out of poverty and the social injustices that accompany it. Tony&#39;s experience also shows that the resonant supply chain paradigm offers a basic framework for engaging with these issues. It can help managers transition their company and implement an impact-led supply chain that aligns business results with impact results. And, &lt;a href=&quot;/2018/01/inclusive-growth-profitable-strategies-for-tackling-poverty-and-inequality&quot;>;as other authors have demonstrated&lt;/a>;, the experience of the cocoa business is mirrored in many other industries as well.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 11 Sep 2023 22:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Where Should Your Company Start with GenAI?]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/09/where-should-your-company-start-with-genai]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/09/Sep23_09_AlexWilliam.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;Illustration by Alex William&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;Companies are struggling with where to start with generative AI.

In taking this view, however, leaders may also need to adjust what they&#39;re looking for.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Our case studies, based on our growing global community of over 3,000 GenAI practitioners, point to a new category of work, more precise and actionable than “knowledge work.” We call it WINS Work: the places where tasks, functions, possibly your entire company or industry are dependent on the manipulation and interpretation of Words, Images, Numbers, and Sounds (WINS). Heart surgeons and chefs are knowledge workers but not WINS workers. Software programmers, accountants, and marketing professionals are WINS workers.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;GenAI has the potential to be power tools for WINS work. It can generate new prose, computer code, images, narration, music, and videos as well as ingest and summarize, critique, improve, and reformat almost any manner of document or analysis. Every WINS task, subprocess, and end-to-end process within your enterprise (and in many cases the entire enterprise) should be evaluated for potential leverage with GenAI.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;How Urgent Is It for My Firm to Pay Attention to GenAI?&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;We believe the easiest way for companies to proceed is to ask themselves two simple questions:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;How much of our cost base is made up of WINS work?&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;How digitized are the WINS inputs today?&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;div>; &lt;figure>; &lt;img aria-describedby=&quot;caption-attachment-363806&quot; src=&quot;/resources/images/article_assets/2023/08/W230905_BAIER_WINS_WORK_AI_360.png&quot; >; &lt;/figure>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hbr.org/data-visuals&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;>;See more HBR charts in Data &amp;amp; Visuals &lt;i>;&lt;/i>;&lt;/a>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;Plotting your company on a 2×2 matrix, ask yourself where it falls. The top-level categorization can be accomplished by looking at the cost base of the firm overall and then by function, and estimating the percentage of work that is WINS work. For example, software development, customer service, marketing, and R&amp;amp;D are just four areas with high levels of WINS work. Here&#39;s a closer look at each competitive position.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;In the Crucible&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Industries with a high percentage of cost in WINS work and that are highly digitized are “In the Crucible” and must understand and embrace GenAI immediately. Software, entertainment, professional services, financial services, education, and others are In the Crucible, because competitors who adopt GenAI rapidly will be better, faster, and cheaper.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The tools of GenAI provide new, creative answers and expressions for everything from resumes to marketing. Think of it like the power of photography in portraiture. While portrait painting was previously available only to the wealthy — an artifact created slowly by highly trained craftspeople — photography expanded the market radically, transforming the entire idea of a portrait (think about a selfie) and its economics. In the hands of great talent, photography became a new form of art. Likewise, software development, script writing, film production, tax filing, accounting, etc., are likely to be under significant cost pressure — and in time will undergo wholesale transformation. These activities may or may not become totally automated, but just as you&#39;d never hire an accountant today who doesn&#39;t use Excel, having GenAI capability may become table stakes for many tasks.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Holding a Lever&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Companies that are “Holding a Lever” are able to gain advantage in cost, time, and quality, even if their cost base is not heavily weighted toward WINS work and their customer end product or deliverable is also not WINS nor digitized. For example, Moderna has recently &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.modernatx.com/media-center/all-media/blogs/moderna-launches-ai-academy-all-employees&quot;>;required&lt;/a>; all employees be trained in GenAI tools. They believe it is a fundamental skill to drive WINS worker productivity even though their product is a molecule or treatment intervention. In our GenAI learning community, we have found GenAI is excellent for supporting bid preparation when responding to an RFP. Speed of sale is a critical performance variable for all, even those firms with few WINS workers. Many SG&amp;amp;A functions, key aspects of R&amp;amp;D, and even the entire end-to-end product development and supply functions can leverage GenAI.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Next in Line&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;The category of “Next in Line” in our framework may provide an opportunity to take tasks that are not digitized today and digitize them to create opportunity. For example, many leading home décor companies are investing in what they are calling their “digital front door,” enabling customer engagement in the identification and purchase process. GenAI will enable new levels of customization to help customers take actions to envision home furnishings in much more realistic and imaginative ways, leading to a better experience, greater customer uptake, and far fewer returns for those companies that are in the forefront.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;In the Balcony&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;For companies that are “In the Balcony,” we see low digitization and limited WINS work as characteristic of the value creation process today. These are often industries with high amounts of low-skilled labor or, when high skill is involved, the nature of the skill is more in the creation of a physical product or service. Figure 2 gives a sample of industries in each of the four quadrants.&lt;/p>; &lt;div>; &lt;figure>; &lt;img aria-describedby=&quot;caption-attachment-363807&quot; src=&quot;/resources/images/article_assets/2023/08/W230905_BAIER_WINS_WORK_AI_INDUSTRIES_360.png&quot; >; &lt;/figure>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hbr.org/data-visuals&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;>;See more HBR charts in Data &amp;amp; Visuals &lt;i>;&lt;/i>;&lt;/a>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;Unlike much CapEx and technology spend that takes several years to see a return, GenAI, even at this early stage, can often be accretive to EBITDA within the year it is adopted, because the near-term productivity boost is so compelling. Over time, these initiatives may birth strategic investment opportunities to create defensible assets or competitive moats.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Legal and Risk Issues&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;When using these tools, it&#39;s vital to have human review of important and high-risk decisions. Today&#39;s GenAI models can sometimes “hallucinate” and give wrong answers. Therefore, for now, staff should use it to augment — not fully automate — high-risk tasks. In time, innovators will figure out ways to improve and augment the core models to improve accuracy. In addition, if you are using one of the open access models like ChatGPT, have clear policies as to when you will allow data and queries to be part of their knowledge base and when will you keep it private.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Where to Start&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;To get your GenAI initiative moving, we suggest the following approach:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;1. Get fully educated on the entire suite of GenAI tools that can drive productivity, change, and innovation in your company and industry. This is not a classroom exercise. This is more akin to swimming. You cannot learn to swim by listening to a lecture or watching a video. Roll up your sleeves, dive into the pool, and swim laps. Learn how the tools work and what they can do.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2. The board/CEO should appoint a cross-functional team to start at the task, subprocess, and process levels for practical experiments and report on progress.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;3. Have a cross-functional business/technology/finance team examine whether and where you could generalize the lessons of your early experimentation. Discover where you “hold the lever.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;4. Perform a strategic review of the cost drivers in the WINS category and current digitization to assess how urgent it is to invest broadly in GenAI. Find out if your company is “In the Crucible.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;5. If you discover you are “In the Crucible” or “Holding a Lever,” create a test-and-learn strategy linked to a six-to-24-month program of improvement. We believe that&#39;s how much time you have before competitive intensity increases in your industry.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;6. If you are “Next in Line,” get smart on GenAI and begin to move toward digitization of all WINS work so you are ahead of the curve. You are next to be “In the Crucible,” and if you don&#39;t transform your industry, someone else will.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;7. For those “In the Balcony,” continue to learn. While things are less imminent for you, GenAI tools will come along to make your business easier and faster, much like Excel and Word replaced calculators and typewriters.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Looking at GenAI Through Bifocal Lenses&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;As we said in the beginning, we advocate that all business leaders should put on their GenAI bifocals and look not only into the distance through that top lens, but perhaps more urgently and importantly, look through the bottom lens to see what&#39;s near. Historically it has taken about five to seven years for a disruptive firm to change industry models. Five years after Uber&#39;s 2009 founding, taxi medallion prices in NYC peaked at about $1,000,000 in 2014. By 2017 their value was $250,000 or less and continued down.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Firms with heavy reliance on WINS work need to act today to fend off stiffer competition and to overcome disruptive competitors within 36 to 60 months. Don&#39;t be caught with high costs, old processes, a data disadvantage, fleeing talent, and expensive capital.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 11 Sep 2023 21:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[What Makes a Great Corporate Purpose Statement]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/09/what-makes-a-great-corporate-purpose-statement]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/09/Sep23_11_1437553268_175488496.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;HBR Staff/Marina Demeshko/kentarcajuan/Getty Images&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;Having a well-crafted purpose statement really matters. Not only does it represent the organization&amp;#8217;s aspirations, it also sends signals to employees about what the company stands for. It is the vital first step on the road to actually embedding and activating an authentic purpose. Yet leaders often struggle to articulate an appropriate and inspiring purpose statement due to a lack of guidance concerning the focus, scope, and form of expression they should aim for. The authors conducted a detailed analysis of purpose statements from leading organizations around the world and developed a diagnostic framework leaders can use to help craft the best purpose statement for their specific situation.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/what-makes-a-great-corporate-purpose-statement?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/what-makes-a-great-corporate-purpose-statement?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;Organizations in all sectors are increasingly required by their investors, customers, employees, and wider stakeholders to articulate a clear statement of corporate purpose. Purpose isn&#39;t about profit maximization; it&#39;s the reason the organization exists.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A purpose statement should clearly explain how the organization will contribute to human, societal, or environmental goals. It needs to be believable, authentic, and inspiring. However, we&#39;ve seen many purpose statements that in our opinion range from vague (eg, Delta&#39;s “Lift the world”) to grandiose (eg, Cisco&#39;s “to power an inclusive future for all”) to uninspiring (eg, Decathlon&#39;s “to be useful for people”).&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Having a well-crafted purpose statement really matters. Not only does it represent the organization&#39;s aspirations, it also sends signals to employees about what the company stands for. It is the vital first step on the road to actually embedding and activating an authentic purpose. Yet leaders often struggle to articulate an appropriate and inspiring purpose statement due to a lack of guidance concerning the focus, scope, and form of expression they should aim for.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We&#39;ve undertaken a detailed analysis of 66 purpose statements from leading organizations around the world. We considered whether the statements were clearly formulated and closely linked to the organization&#39;s core activities, as well as the extent to which they were credible. We talked to senior leaders and employees and reviewed best-practice advice. Based on these insights into what does and doesn&#39;t work, we developed a diagnostic framework leaders can use to help craft the best purpose statement for their specific situation.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;A Framework for Crafting a Meaningful Purpose Statement&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Our framework, SABRE, identifies four dimensions of purpose statement &lt;em>;content&lt;/em>; (ie, what the purpose means) and one dimension of purpose statement &lt;em>;formulation&lt;/em>; (ie, how the statement itself is worded). Leaders can evaluate their current or proposed purpose statement against each dimension.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Societal&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;The foundation of any purpose statement is an explicit reference to the specific, pressing human, societal, or environmental problem(s) the organization seeks to address or alleviate.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;All too often, we see purpose statements that simply refer to these in a very general way or worse, fail to mention them at all. In fact, 68% of the statements we analyzed fell into this latter category. We&#39;ve also seen purpose statements formulated around performance or profit aspirations. Statements like these point to a mission or goal, but not a purpose.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A good example of a clear statement of societal benefit comes from Philips:&lt;/p>; &lt;blockquote>; &lt;p>;At Philips, our purpose is to improve people&#39;s health and well-being through meaningful innovation. We aim to improve 2.5 billion lives per year by 2030, including 400 million in underserved communities. As a technology company, we — and our brand licensees — innovate for people with one consistent belief: there&#39;s always a way to make life better.&lt;/p>; &lt;/blockquote>; &lt;p>;For those struggling to articulate how their company&#39;s products and services advance a social or common good, it may be more realistic to relate the purpose to how the company operates. For example, food retailer Aldi&#39;s purpose is to “Provide value and quality to our customers by being fair and efficient in all we do.”&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Authentic&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Both employees and external stakeholders, including customers and investors, will want to know if they can trust that your purpose statement accurately and honestly reflects the organization&#39;s true aims, and they&#39;ll seek cues in and around the organization to guide their evaluation. If the organization&#39;s stated purpose is to improve health yet it continues to sell tobacco products, for example, stakeholders will conclude that the purpose fails the authenticity test.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Employees are likely to be especially well-attuned to inauthentic purpose statements. Where they perceive a mismatch between the stated purpose and the daily realities of organizational life, we&#39;ve found they experience disenchantment, leading to loss of engagement and potentially even the decision to quit. Adding questions about the purpose statement to regular employee surveys will help leaders identify where it&#39;s falling short. Customers and investors are equally unimpressed when a company is revealed to have misrepresented itself in its purpose statement, giving rise to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kcl.ac.uk/business/assets/research/literature-review-purpose-washing.pdf&quot;>;accusations of purpose-washing&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;BlackRock&#39;s purpose statement comes across as authentic because it&#39;s grounded in what the company does and how it operates: “As a global investment manager and fiduciary to our clients, our purpose at BlackRock is to help everyone experience financial well-being.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, authenticity isn&#39;t fixed — purposes that seem authentic one day can become inauthentic the next following negative publicity. For example, Volkswagen, which had previously stated its corporate commitment to delivering sustainable cars for a better future, was accused of “greenwashing” following the revelation in 2015 that the company had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nrdc.org/stories/what-greenwashing&quot;>;tampered with emissions testing&lt;/a>;, leading to the “Dieselgate” scandal, hefty fines, and reduced trust around the world.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Believable&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Some purpose statements are so grandiose that they&#39;re impossible to live up to. Unfortunately, many of the statements we analyzed failed the believability test for this very reason. Vague aspirations such as “improving the world” may be laudable, but stakeholders will ask: How?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The best statements make it clear that the organization can realistically deploy their resources and measure their progress toward achieving their purpose. For example, Astra Zeneca&#39;s statement, “We push the boundaries of science to deliver life-changing medicines,” shows strength on the believability dimension, as it&#39;s easy to imagine a pharmaceutical company developing important new drugs.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Relevant to beneficiaries&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;The most effective purpose statements contain a clear indication of which segments of society and the environment will benefit. Unfortunately, some statements fail to mention any specific beneficiaries at all, and so remain abstract.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, Mars&#39;s statement, “The world we want tomorrow starts with how we do business today,” fails to clarify who in particular will benefit from the company&#39;s products. Apple&#39;s purpose statement, on the other hand, makes the intended beneficiaries, its customers, more clear: “Bringing the best user experience to its customers through innovative hardware, software, and services.”&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Engaging&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;The final component of SABRE addresses how the statement is worded. The best purpose statements are engaging and inspiring, appealing to the heart as much as to the mind. They&#39;re memorable for all the right reasons. When statements are too long, they become unclear and lose their grip on people&#39;s attention. Sure, you may want to have a more detailed explanation of what the purpose means, but the headline statement needs to be punchy. Consider General Mills&#39; brief and engaging purpose statement: “Making food the world loves.”&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Putting It All Together&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;We believe an organization can develop a statement that meets all of these criteria. Take Novo Nordisk, for example:&lt;/p>; &lt;blockquote>; &lt;p>;Our purpose is&amp;nbsp;to drive change to defeat diabetes and other serious chronic diseases, such as obesity and rare blood and endocrine disorders. We do so by pioneering scientific breakthroughs, expanding access to our medicines, and working to prevent and ultimately cure diabetes.&lt;/p>; &lt;/blockquote>; &lt;p>;Novo Nordisk clearly states the societal problem they&#39;re setting out to tackle. The statement aligns with the organization&#39;s core ambitions, and we can see how the firm can deploy its resources to achieve these. The beneficiaries are named, and the statement is concise and aspirational.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;By using the SABRE framework to guide purpose statement discussions, leaders can move toward achieving an inspiring, authentic, actionable purpose that will make clear to internal and external stakeholders how they will help address today&#39;s fundamental challenges.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 11 Sep 2023 20:25:02 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
