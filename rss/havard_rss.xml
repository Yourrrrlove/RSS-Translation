&lt;p>;我所说的“同侪压力操纵”直接针对我们的集体本能。五种操纵策略尤其会导致决策者犯下错误，例如选择可疑的合作伙伴或投资、雇用不合格的机构、为考虑不周的内部活动开绿灯以及支持普遍糟糕的想法。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在这里，我们将讨论如何捍卫您的利益你自己和你的团队的决策是通过同侪压力操纵做出的。一旦您能够识别五种常见的操纵策略，您就可以在任何时候感觉产品、想法、投资或行动方案可能不真实时进行保护性心理练习。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;如何同伴压力操纵有效吗？​​&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;操纵者需要你接受三个假设为真——即使它们没有明确说明。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这些想法构成了同伴压力操纵的基础。学会注意并评估何时有人希望您相信这三个“事实”：&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;相关的&lt;em>;其他&lt;/em>;人相信操纵者告诉您他们相信的事情。&lt;/li >; &lt;li>;其他人的意见不仅是真实的，而且与&lt;em>;您的&lt;/em>;相关&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;您的&lt;em>;个人&lt;/em>;最佳利益在决策中受到威胁蔑视或附和他人的观点。&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;当您了解五种操纵策略以及如何扭转每一种策略时，请记住这个框架。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>; 5 种操纵策略&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;这些场景的灵感来自于我与不同领域的决策者的对话，并综合到现实世界的例子中。&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;1.他们窃取了可信度。&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;莎拉是一位科技会议主席，她需要为她的活动再预订一位发言人。一位营销专家要求提供这个位置。他说他曾与亚马逊、PayPal、Stripe 和其他主要品牌合作过。他还提到了一个“科技股”非营利组织的名字，称他希望为边缘群体的创始人提供帮助。莎拉印象深刻，给他预订了。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但在他讲话几分钟后，她就后悔了。这位专家没有向观众提供任何营销建议。相反，他向他们推销自己的服务。他甚至提供了“特别的一次性折扣”，一位与会者称这是“令人畏缩”的举动。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;失败后，莎拉更详细地研究了这位专家，看看她错过了他的哪些方面。她了解到，他的客户实际上是亚马逊、PayPal、Stripe 等公司的现任或前任员工，而不是他所代表的公司本身。她也找不到他参与他声称支持的事业的任何历史。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;看起来莎拉的专家不真实地将自己与他知道会给她留下深刻印象的品牌名称和事业联系在一起，选择了&lt;他们对自己的可信度。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当某人的推销严重依赖于他们的联想时，请审查他们的真实性。询问有关这些关系的问题。这个人与这些人或品牌到底有什么联系？他们是否在这些事业上投入了时间？他们采取了哪些行动来践行他们声称持有的价值观？&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;2.他们利用共同的威胁来赢得您的信任。&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;虽然我们经常因共同利益而与人建立联系，但我们往往会立即喜欢的人是那些&lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary .wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1475-6811.2006.00109.x&quot;>;分享我们的&lt;em>;负面&lt;/em>;意见&lt;/a>;。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;与格温有同样挫败感的人与首席财务官合作更有可能说服她接受他们的建议。与本一样担心这笔交易会伤害他们的人更有可能赢得他的信任。共同的负面情绪可以使人们团结起来，但它也可以帮助操纵者使人们与他们的议程保持一致。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;仔细审查任何引发共同敌人或共同威胁以建立融洽关系的宣传。如果有人谈论你们对灾难性结果或即将发生的事件的恐惧，或者如果他们声称分享你对某个人、情况或品牌的愤怒——请注意。他们如何利用这一共同威胁很重要。他们提到它是因为这是他们想要解决的真正问题吗？或者，这种共同的威胁除了帮助他们与你建立联系之外没有其他任何目的吗？如果有人煽动你的愤怒或恐惧只是为了表明志同道合，他们会促使你接受他们接下来所说的一切。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;最终，没有必要怀疑每个与你有共同恐惧的人。但您正在考虑的产品或计划应该因其提供的功能而引人注目，而不是其所反对的内容。&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;3.他们伪造了市场验证。&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;在品牌合作伙伴关系未能推动销售后，营销主管乔丹重新阅读了合作伙伴品牌的案例研究，以调查出了什么问题。他注意到他之前错过的一些奇怪的事情：案例研究是假设的，没有提及实际客户的名字。该品牌还拥有大量社交媒体受众，但参与度较低，这表明可能存在“机器人”追随者。事实证明，该品牌网站上的媒体徽标代表的是付费广告，而不是文章或新闻。乔丹开始认为该品牌伪造了他们的受众规模，甚至可能还伪造了他们过去的作品。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;伪造市场验证对于操纵者来说是轻而易举的事情。他们明白，强大的观众的出现会激发我们寻求同伴认可和归属感的本能。他们指望我们从表面上看这些指标。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;用外表来代替现实是很诱人的。但请花点时间询问能够揭示受众规模和情绪的市场洞察来源。 NPS 分数、使用统计数据、网络分析和社交参与度等量化数据比关注者数量更能直接表明情绪。获取参考文献和案例研究主题的名称，并询问模糊的启发式信息，例如网站上的媒体徽标。&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;4.他们试图抹黑竞争对手。&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;迈克尔是一家营养饮料品牌的销售总监，他希望与当地经销商合作。但竞争品牌也是如此——只有其中一个能够赢得独家协议。于是迈克尔发起了战斗：他告诉经销商，选择其他品牌将是一个冒险的选择。迈克尔表示，他们的产品在营养科学界并不可信，许多人认为它“不安全”。迈克尔暗示，与他们合作会损害经销商的声誉，甚至可能带来责任。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;批评竞争产品的质量或适合度并没有什么不妥的。但试图通过将它们描绘成有污点的、非法的或禁忌的来抹黑它们是一种操纵策略，它让人们担心如果他们敢于做出错误的选择就会受到关联的耻辱。在迈克尔的案例中，他援引了社会最大的耻辱之一来抹黑他的竞争对手：忽视安全。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;如果你有一种令人不安的感觉，即一个人向你推销某样东西想要抹黑或污蔑竞争性的选择，那么你就会感到不安。首先需要从特征中解析事实。深入研究“人们的想法”或“社区相信”的说法，找出&lt;em>;谁&lt;/em>;实际上说了&lt;em>;什么&lt;/em>;。他们的具体用词是什么？他们是否使用了“不安全”这个词，或者这是一种表征？不同的利益相关者如何解释来自来源的信息，他们有什么动机？&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;如果您得出结论，这些特征毕竟有优点，请采取下一步。评估推介的好处，而不考虑其他选择。拒绝错误的二分法，即仅仅因为选项 A 不好，选项 B 就一定是好的。&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;5.他们分而治之。&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;凯德是一位雄心勃勃的物流经理，但他并没有得到同事的充分信任，因为他似乎总是渴望更多的权威。他请求副总裁允许组建并主持一个监管监督委员会。该委员会表面上会保护公司免受事故影响，但它也会让凯德访问其他经理的私人项目日志。副总裁并不相信，但告诉凯德，如果团队的其他成员都参与其中，他会考虑这一点。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;因此，凯德向部门负责人请愿。他告诉他们，他已经得到了副总统的支持。部门领导不想惹恼别人，所以就同意了。然后，凯德告诉经理们，他们的部门负责人已经同意了，而经理们也很不情愿地签字同意。人们对给予凯德监督持谨慎态度。但他们不想挑战老板和同事，所以没有人发声。因此，凯德向他的副总裁展示了团队的“一致支持”，并获得了成立委员会的许可，但私下里，没有人愿意这样做。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这种分而治之的策略被称为&lt;a href= “https://www.simplypsychology.org/pluralistic-ignorance.html&quot;>;多元无知&lt;/a>;。它的作用是在小组成员中引起对反对坏主意的恐惧，因为他们（错误地）被引导相信他们是唯一反对的人。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;如果你发现自己被迫采取共识观点如果您不确定，请调查它是否有实际的支持 - 或者只是合规性。询问同事他们喜欢这个想法的哪些方面以及他们认为它有什么帮助。注意他们的语气。他们是在传福音，还是只是随波逐流？通过分享你自己的不确定性来创造一个坦诚反馈的机会：“我不知道我对 X 的感觉如何。你确信这是正确的举动吗？”匿名调查还可以通过发现团队成员没有分享他们的实际观点来打开讨论之门。&lt;/p>; &lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;。 。 .&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;同侪压力操纵者不会使用最有力的论据来说服我们。他们只是利用我们对认可和联系的需求，或者利用我们对失去在群体中的地位的恐惧。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;好消息是，我们不需要停止关心别人对我们的看法来抵制这种操纵。我们只需要发现支撑它的花招、简单化的跳跃和错误假设。因此，提出问题并测试声明。当你挑战其基础时，操纵就会被推翻。通常情况下，其他人会感谢你的反击。&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;我也真的很兴奋，尽管有些保守。如今，人工智能提供了提高生产力的机会，其中&lt;a title=&quot;https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/08/28/the-missing-pandemic-innovation-boom&quot; href= “https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/08/28/the-missing-pandemic-innovation-boom&quot;>;在很长一段时间内保持平稳&lt;/a>;，并解决&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2023/09/13/how-scientists-are-using-artificial-intelligence&quot;>;迄今为止棘手的问题&lt;/a>;，例如搜索对于抗生素耐药药物，了解蛋白质如何折叠，并寻找具有制造更好电池所需特性的材料。从 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lineate.com/blog/3-ways-amazon-uses-ai-to-make-product-recommendations&quot;>;亚马逊的推荐引擎&lt;/a>;到 Callaway，取得了令人印象深刻的成功高尔夫的下一代发球杆设计，百事公司的制造努力&lt;a title=&quot;https://blogs.microsoft.com/ai-for-business/pepsico-perfect-cheetos/&quot; href=&quot;https://blogs. microsoft.com/ai-for-business/pepsico-perfect-cheetos/&quot;>;更一致的奇多&lt;/a>;有助于证明这种兴奋是合理的。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但我也认为，进展将需要更长的时间，而且要困难得多超出大多数人的预期，尤其是在商业环境中。正如我将解释的那样，人工智能的成功需要齐心协力，而这些努力远远超出了技术的范围。因此，他们需要公司最高领导层的全力投入。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;值得注意的是，人工智能在过去曾引起过相当大的兴奋，但被 &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia .org/wiki/AI_winter#:~:text=There%20were%20two%20major%20winters,single%2Dlayer%20artificial%20neural%20networks)&quot;>;AI 冬天&lt;/a>;在 1970 年代中期和 1990 年代初。就在三年前，即 2020 年，《经济学人》&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.com/technology-quarterly/2020/06/11/an-understanding-of-ais -limitations-is-start-to-sink-in&quot;>;指出&lt;/a>;“不太可能出现另一个全面的冬天。但秋风渐起。”举个例子，自动驾驶汽车受益于大量投资，并且似乎总是&lt;a href=&quot;https://universe.byu.edu/2016/01/15/self-driven-cars-are-just-around -the-corner/&quot;>;“就在拐角处”，&lt;/a>;但是&lt;a href=&quot;https://umdearborn.edu/news/why-your-first-driverless-car-decades-not-years-距离“更可能是几十年后。&lt;/a>;此外，在大流行期间，当洞察力非常宝贵时，数百个&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/07/ 30/1030329/machine-learning-ai-failed-covid-hospital-diagnosis-pandemic/&quot;>;用于捕获新冠病毒的人工智能工具&lt;/a>;已通过审核。事实上，人工智能项目的失败率似乎是 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbetechcouncil/2023/04/10/why-most-machine-learning-applications-fail-to-部署/?sh=6dee0b08736d&quot;>;80%以北&lt;/a>;。最后，Meta（前身为 Facebook）研究人员最近在受控条件下进行的一项研究表明，大型语言模型无法正确理解事实&lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.10168.pdf&quot;>;三分之二&lt;/a>;。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;不过，我不太关心技术本身，而更关心人工智能必须伴随的其他进步。历史表明，任何新技术的开花结果都需要广泛的相关技术、组织创新以及新技术与社会之间的协调。我将使用电气化和印刷机来说明这些观点，然后探讨它们如何应用于人工智能。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;正如奥地利政治经济学家约瑟夫·熊彼特 &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ebusinessforum.gr /old/content/downloads/IstheInformationRevolutionDead&quot;>;指出&lt;/a>;，成功的技术往往以集群的形式出现。随着电气化的发展，发电机、发电机、开关装置和配电系统应运而生。随着印刷机的出现，生产大量廉价纸张和墨水的技术也随之而来。而且，虽然本身不​​是一项技术，但需要圣经和其他经典之外的新材料来刺激对印刷材料的需求。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;单个缺失的组件可能会阻碍新技术的采用。例如，今天缺乏足够的快速充电站是 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.com/leaders/2021/12/11/the-tricky-business-of-charging-electric-cars ?utm_medium=cpc.adword.pd&amp;amp;utm_source=google&amp;amp;ppccampaignID=17210591673&amp;amp;ppcadID=&amp;amp;utm_campaign=a.22brand_pmax&amp;amp;utm_content=conversion.direct-response.anonymous&amp;amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwx5qoBhDyARIsAPbMagCl_ gWXBuyeFVRJoNK_eIISY6YEQW5LjFFp3SrF2o1C8jTc-M6JfDAaAl26EALw_wcB&amp;amp;gclsrc=aw.ds&quot;>;减缓电动汽车的发展&lt;/a>;。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;接下来，新技术需要新的组织能力。虽然电力和电动机的好处显而易见，但它们要求工厂重新设计。经过 40 年的学习、实验和多方面投资，工厂才实现全面电气化。同样，帮助匹配供需和价格的出版业也花了这么长时间才出现。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;新技术和社会迟早必须相互适应。一开始，电是很危险的——误触带电电线可能会致命！随着时间的推移，标准插座和插头帮助缓解了这种担忧。印刷机发明时，很少有人识字。但随着社会文明程度的提高，印刷机的好处也随之增加。查看这些过去的集群可以帮助我们了解我们现在所处的时刻，以及人工智能的未来可能是什么样子。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;采用人工智能的障碍&lt;/strong>;&lt;/ h2>; &lt;p>;这些领域中的每一个都对人工智能的广泛采用构成了巨大的障碍。 （在使用人工智能这个术语时，我正在撒下一张广泛的网，包括机器学习、深度学习、计算机视觉、自然语言处理、机器人、专家系统、模糊逻辑以及通常与人类智能相关的其他任务领域.)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;首先，考虑与人工智能相关的技术。最重要的两个是海量的计算能力和大量的高质量数据。日益复杂的模型需要更多的计算能力，正如摩尔定律所预测的那样，计算能力似乎正在迅速增长。对于那些处于领先地位的人来说可能不够快，但对于大多数商业用途来说已经足够快了。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当涉及“大量高质量数据”时，情况更加复杂。例如，在教人工智能下国际象棋时，研究人员为算法提供了规则，并指示它与自己下棋，从而避免了现实世界的质量问题。相比之下，糟糕的数据质量让 IBM 的 Watson &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statnews.com/2017/09/05/watson-ibm-cancer/&quot;>;首次进入医疗保健领域&lt;/a>;遭遇失败。为了进一步强调高质量数据的重要性，研究人员普遍承认，如果没有精心策划的可信数据，今天的人工智能模型就不可能实现&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/18 /magazine/wikipedia-ai-chatgpt.html?searchResultPosition=3&quot;>;摘自维基百科&lt;/a>;。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;所有这些都是有道理的：即使像人工智能这样卓越的技术也无法产生比它的输入。在大多数商业环境中，&lt;a href=&quot;/2017/09/only-3-of-companies-data-meets-basic-quality-standards&quot;>;质量问题&lt;/a>;与 Watson 的相似度远高于原始环境国际象棋。训练、更新和操作 AI 模型的&lt;a href=&quot;/2018/04/if-your-data-is-bad-your-machine-learning-tools-are-useless&quot;>;质量要求&lt;/a>;是广泛、深入，而且在某些情况下，人们理解甚少。例如，虽然 Microsoft 的 Tay 聊天机器人似乎在正常对话方面训练有素，但用户生成的内容 &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tay_(chatbot)#:~:text=Tay% 20was%20an%20artificial%20intelligence,only%2016%20hours%20after%20its&quot;>;快速教会它模仿仇恨言论&lt;/a>;。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;雪上加霜的是，许多公司的数据和系统架构越来越多凌乱而混乱。这使得获取数据以应用人工智能工具变得更加困难，从而加剧了质量问题。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我发现这种情况很矛盾。据我所知，每个参与人员都了解高质量数据的重要性。一些从业者私下承认数据是任何人工智能项目中最重要的部分。但公司甚至还没有安排专人负责，更不用说整理出他们需要的完整程序来确保他们拥有所需的高质量数据。或许，正如 Google 研究人员&lt;a href=&quot;https://research.google/pubs/pub49953/&quot;>;指出&lt;/a>;那样，“每个人都想做模型工作，而不是数据工作。”但在数据工作完成之前，很难看到好的模型出现和人工智能取得成功。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;现在考虑与让人工智能发挥作用所需的组织能力相关的问题。这些很可能与质量问题一样困难。我发现基本但强大的分析技术的渗透在这里具有广泛的指导意义，因为它和人工智能都严重依赖于数据。这些工具已经存在了至少两代。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但是除了基本的报告之外，大多数组织仍然不经常或很好地使用它们。这些工具比人工智能模型更容易理解。不幸的现实是，&lt;a href=&quot;/2023/06/your-data-strategy-needs-to-include-everyone&quot;>;分析是固定在组织上的，而不是内置于组织中的，&lt;/a>;实际上保证了永久的争取相关性。在这个结构性问题得到解决之前，很难看到人工智能有光明的未来。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;第二个大的组织问题是员工抵制威胁其工作的创新。虽然人工智能可以减少工作中的苦差事，提高员工的工作效率，并导致就业增长，但大多数人的担忧是正确的。毕竟，当一份苦差事能够养家糊口时，它胜过任何工作。那么，员工和人工智能将如何协同工作？是否应该期望员工帮助创建一个能够取代他们的人工智能？解释和/或清理训练数据？当人工智能取代他们的时候，他们应该如何得到补偿？在人工智能使人们更加有效和/或高效的情况下，人们是否应该获得更高的报酬？没有简单的答案。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;最后一点是关于员工的。尽管生成式人工智能易于使用，但开发和部署大多数人工智能都需要顶尖人才。然而，太多的数据科学家认为他们的才能被浪费了。正如一位资深人士所说，“我发现大多数数据科学家都因自己没有产生太大影响而感到非常沮丧。”没有惊喜！找到企业实际使用的新颖的东西并在实践中部署模型是非常困难的。更糟糕的是处理官僚主义、质量问题以及受工作影响的人的恐惧。希望吸引和留住顶尖人才的公司必须解决这些挫败感。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;第三，也是最后一点，考虑人类/社会和人工智能相互适应的问题。如上所述，一些人认为人工智能将提升人类水平，而另一些人则认为人工智能威胁文明。因此，这些问题已经引起了国家和国际层面的巨大关注，尽管迄今为止还没有达成一致。尽管只有少数公司在这些层面上有很大影响力，但大多数公司都会发现他们必须在某些方面采取立场，例如：&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;公司应该根据什么标准来比较他们的人工智能？有许多关于自动驾驶汽车造成死亡的报道。但人们远非完美的司机，他们的错误也会导致很多人死亡。 “零事故”或“更少事故”是目标吗？&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;公司是否应该向提供数据的个人提供补偿？他们是否应该为保证正确的数据支付更多费用？&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;国家安全问题（例如中美之间的竞争）应如何影响公司的计划？&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;人工智能很像一个“黑匣子” ”——它没有对其得出结论的方式给出很好的解释。因此，公司应该开始思考如何解决合理的问题，例如“你为什么拒绝我的贷款？”&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;h2>;该怎么办？&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;这可能是是盘点的好时机。您的公司是否完全接受人工智能所需的数据、组织和社会挑战，并且您的高级领导层是否全力投入？如果是这样，那么您成功的机会就增加了。祝你好运！&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;或者，您的大部分工作是否都集中在技术上，也许由您的首席分析官和/或技术团队领导？如果是这样，问问自己是否准备好在数据、组织和社会/人员问题上开展全方位的工作，以获得显着的业务成果。如果没有，最好保持粉末干燥。如果是这样，真正艰巨而重要的工作还在后面。您只需让更高级的领导层投入到这项工作中即可。没有用于执行此操作的固定脚本。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;您还必须开始处理上述数据和组织问题。我建议您采取两个步骤来帮助您入门：&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;为了数据质量，进行一些测量，以便您知道自己的立场。然后通过查找并消除错误的根本原因来&lt;a href=&quot;/2020/02/to-improve-data-quality-start-at-the-source&quot;>;进行一些改进&lt;/a>;。&lt;/li>; &lt; li>;为了建立您所需的组织力量，&lt;a href=&quot;/2019/10/most-analytics-projects-dont-require-much-data&quot;>;完成几个“小数据项目”&lt;/a>;，涉及的团队包括人们专注于改进自己的工作流程。&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;我还建议采取另外两个步骤，预计会做出全力投入的决定：&lt;/p>;

&lt;/div>; &lt;p>;有您是否曾发现您的团队来回寻找问题的良好解决方案却没有取得进展？或者，您可能在会议结束后对所选解决方案感到不确定，想知道您的团队是否忽略了重要信息。 To help your team make better decisions more confidently, you need to address a decision-making bias we call the &lt;em>;solution fixation trap&lt;/em>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The solution fixation trap emerges when a team rushes into discussing possible solutions before fully understanding the problem at hand.例如，负责解决销售下降问题的营销团队可能会匆忙建议对现有营销活动进行修改，而没有花足够的时间来充分了解销售下降的根本原因。同样，负责增强求职者人口多样性的招聘工作组可能会在没有充分分析可能的抑制因素的情况下匆忙提出新的招聘策略。 Not only does this make it challenging for teams to arrive at solutions they feel confident about — it puts them at risk of committing to the wrong course of action.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this article, we share the study that helped us uncover this bias, explain what the solution fixation trap looks like, and discuss what you can do to protect your team from it.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Visualizing a Team&#39;s Unfolding Decision-Making Behavior&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;To better explain what the solution fixation trap looks like, we developed a method to visualize and analyze a team&#39;s decision-making behavior.当我们与周围的世界（例如其他团队成员）互动时，我们的每一种行为（言语或非言语）都有其作用。例如，分享一条信息或询问信息都是专注于信息处理的行为。 Close analysis of phase maps — illustrations that highlight time periods where teams engage with behaviors with a common function — helped us answer important questions about team dynamics and unravel phenomena such as the solution fixation trap. The phase-mapping technique focuses on identifying clusters of behaviors with a common function, which we label as a phase type.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One hundred and sixty-nine MBA students participated in this study.参与者组成 28 个小组，参加了涉及一系列问题解决任务的学习模拟。 (Disclosure: The &lt;a href=&quot;https://hbsp.harvard.edu/product/7000-HTM-ENG&quot;>;Leadership and Team Simulation: Everest V2&lt;/a>;&amp;nbsp;is a product of Harvard Business Publishing.) We recorded audio and video of each team as they engaged with the simulation. Then, we transcribed team communications verbatim and assigned a code to each statement based on its function.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Prior research by scholars such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/hcr/article-abstract/15/4/549/4584138?redirectedFrom=fulltext&quot;>;Marshall Poole, Jonelle Roth&lt;/a>;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1952-03911-001&quot;>;Robert Bales&lt;/a>; suggests that behaviors of teams tasked with solving a problem can be categorized into four phase types: 1) information processing, 2) solution exploration, 3) confirmation, and 4) executive action.下图显示了塑造每个阶段的行为示例。 As a team works on a task over time, it flows through these phases.&lt;/p>; &lt;div>; &lt;figure>; &lt;img aria-describedby=&quot;caption-attachment-364976&quot; src=&quot;/resources/images/article_assets/2023/09/W230913_SOHRAB_DECISION_MAKING_BEHAVIOR_360.png&quot; >; Information processing, shown as orange: Sharing something that others may not know, Asking for information, and Answering questions.&lt;br />; Solution exploration, green: Proposing a solution, Evaluating a proposed solution, and Expanding a proposed solution.&lt;br />; Confirmation, yellow: Asking for confirmation, and Confirming.&lt;br />; Executive action, blue: Ensuring that everyone has access to the required documents, Completing required paperwork, and Discussing guidelines about the process.&lt;br />; Unorganized period, gray: Unorganized action that does not focus on one type of behavior.The lefthand side of the bar is labeled “beginning of the task” and the righthand side is labeled “end of the task.” The lengths of each block correspond to the amount of time spent in a phase. The first block is the longest, encompassing about a third of the task bar, and indicates the information processing phase. Then two smaller blocks show a switch to the solution exploration phase and back to information processing phase, followed by the second-longest block on the task bar, which is another phase spent in solution exploration. The last one-fourth of the bar shows a short block of the confirmation phase and culminates with a final block in the executive action phase.Source: Serena G. Sohrab, Mary J. Waller, Sjir Uitdewilligen.&lt;br />; &quot; title=&quot;Phase Map of a Hypothetical Team&#39;s Decision-Making Behavior.&quot; width=&quot;360&quot; height=&quot;649&quot;>; &lt;/figure>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hbr.org/data-visuals&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;>;See more HBR charts in Data &amp;amp; Visuals &lt;i>;&lt;/i>;&lt;/a>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;The above graphic also depicts a hypothetical team&#39;s interactions as members work on a problem-solving task, with each block representing a time period focused on a specific type of behavior. The team starts by discussing the available information (the first orange block). Once members feel fairly confident that everyone has had a chance to share what they know, the team switches to considering possible solutions (the green block). Then, the team returns to discussing information to better inform its decision (the second orange block) before engaging in a long discussion of potential solutions and evaluating them (the second green block). This phase is followed by the team seeking everyone&#39;s verbal confirmation (the yellow block). The team ends the task by ensuring the decision is properly recorded and documented (the blue block).&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;While this behavior may seem aligned with what most of us would expect to happen on a team when making a decision, most teams&#39; behavior trajectory actually looks more like the graphic below, with more frequent switches between phases and some unorganized periods (illustrated as gray blocks).&lt;/p>; &lt;div>; &lt;figure>; &lt;img aria-describedby=&quot;caption-attachment-364975&quot; src=&quot;/resources/images/article_assets/2023/09/W230913_SOHRAB_DECISION_MAKING_BEHAVIOR_PHASES_360.png&quot; >; &quot; title=&quot;Phase Map of a Typical Team&#39;s Decision-Making Behavior.&quot; width=&quot;360&quot; height=&quot;369&quot;>; &lt;/figure>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hbr.org/data-visuals&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;>;See more HBR charts in Data &amp;amp; Visuals &lt;i>;&lt;/i>;&lt;/a>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;/div>; &lt;h2>;The Solution Fixation Trap&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;In our research study, we examined the phase maps of 28 teams that worked on a moderately complex problem-solving task. By analyzing their interactions during the task, we were able to uncover a behavioral pattern that was a key performance indicator, distinguishing high-performing teams that found the best solution from low-performing ones that chose the worst solution. The below graphic shows the phase maps for five high-performing and five low-performing teams.&lt;/p>; &lt;div>; &lt;figure>; &lt;img aria-describedby=&quot;caption-attachment-365163&quot; src=&quot;/resources/images/article_assets/2023/09/W230913_SOHRAB_DECISION_MAKING_BEHAVIOR_TEAMS_360_V2.png&quot; >; The second group of tasks is labeled “low-performing teams.” All five task bars contain much more occurrence of solution exploration blocks, showing that Low-performing teams&#39; discussions are dominated by solution exploration and assessment rather than by gathering and analyzing the information required to arrive at a good solution.Source: Serena G. Sohrab, Mary J. Waller, Sjir Uitdewilligen.&quot; title=&quot;Comparison of Phase Maps for Five High- and Five Low-Performing Teams.&quot; width=&quot;360&quot; height=&quot;872&quot;>; &lt;/figure>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hbr.org/data-visuals&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;>;See more HBR charts in Data &amp;amp; Visuals &lt;i>;&lt;/i>;&lt;/a>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;As evident in these maps, low-performing teams&#39; discussions are dominated by solution exploration and assessment rather than by gathering and analyzing the information required to arrive at a good solution. Interestingly, both high and low performers started the task by discussing what they knew about the problem. However, shortly thereafter, low-performing teams became fixated on pitching suggestions about what they should do and began generating various solutions. Once this happened, they failed to return to information analysis for any sustained period of time.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We also found that when these low-performing teams became fixated on their solution exploration, they were less likely to seek information to answer questions that surfaced. If a team member asked, “What do we know about X?”, low performers would typically ignore the question and continue discussing potential solutions without substantiating them. This fixation on debating solutions limited the low performers&#39; ability to reveal and fully evaluate all the information available to them, which in turn led to poor decision outcomes. Interestingly, these teams that seemed to rush into debating solutions did not finish the overall task any faster than the high-performing teams.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Protecting Your Team from the Solution Fixation Trap&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;So what can managers do to prevent their teams from falling into this solution fixation trap? Here are a few easy-to-implement strategies based on our research:&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Start the meeting by reviewing all the available information.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Go around the table and encourage people to share what they know — not their opinions — about the situation or problem at hand. Once everyone has had a chance to share what they know, ask the room if they&#39;re aware of any information that was not discussed. This is essential because more than &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1046496415599068&quot;>;three decades of research&lt;/a>; offers solid evidence that information not known by all team members is significantly less likely to be mentioned during team discussions.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Be mindful of immature solution suggestions.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Meetings are hardly anyone&#39;s favorite event, as most people find them a waste of time, &lt;a href=&quot;/2017/07/stop-the-meeting-madness&quot;>;overwhelming, and even soul-sucking and painful&lt;/a>;.因此，当你召集人们开会解决问题或做出决定时，你可能会遇到那些有意无意地试图匆忙讨论并尽快结束会议的人。他们可以通过对时间做出明确的评论或更微妙的方式来做到这一点，例如直接讨论可能的解决方案。 When you notice an immature solution suggestion, label it by saying something like, “Thanks for that suggestion — let&#39;s come back to that when we&#39;re sure we&#39;ve uncovered all the relevant information.” Then, bring the discussion back to information sharing and analysis.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Encourage evidence-based decision-making throughout the process.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;When questions arise, guide the team to answer them based on the available information, not their opinion or rough guesses. You might say something like, “Sounds like we need to go back and dig into this issue a little more.”&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Use visualization tools to organize the information and solutions discussed.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Some of our other &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/job.2301&quot;>;research&lt;/a>; suggests that teams sifting through and sharing complex information can benefit significantly from the use of a collective display, such as a dry erase board or electronic whiteboard. Writing information on a shared display can certainly help tie information to possible solutions as they are discussed.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;. 。 .&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;In the face of escalating complexities confronting organizations, the reliance on teams to tackle these intricate issues and drive pivotal organizational decisions is on the rise. To extract maximum value from team dynamics, it&#39;s paramount to remain mindful of potential biases that may impact team dynamics and to actively steer and fine-tune team processes.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 11 Oct 2023 22:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[What&rsquo;s Lost When Data Systems Don&rsquo;t Communicate]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/10/whats-lost-when-data-systems-dont-communicate]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/10/Oct23_11_6551-000359-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;Raimund Koch/Getty Images&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;In every industry, many large corporations have teams that help bridge outdated, disconnected systems, and databases. Without them, there is no way companies can upgrade their technology without causing disruption to their operations. The problem is that running a company on disconnected or barely patched together systems affects employees at all levels. To understand what disconnected systems are costing companies &amp;#8212; &amp;#8220;disconnection debt&amp;#8221; &amp;#8212; the authors measured the impact of information silos arising from disconnected systems, on business outcomes in over 100 teams across companies.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/10/whats-lost-when-data-systems-dont-communicate?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/10/whats-lost-when-data-systems-dont-communicate?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;Imagine a scenario. Kelly, a dedicated employee in a large hospital network, readied herself for another day of handling upset customers. As a member of the consumer relations team, she addressed escalated calls from patients who had been redirected multiple times. Her challenge for the day involved a potential Alzheimer&#39;s patient seeking a second opinion from a different hospital network. Unfortunately, this patient was informed that Kelly&#39;s network was unable to transmit medical records electronically, and instead may have to undertake a 90-minute trip to collect the records on a CD.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Amid the stress of the call, Kelly identified a synchronization problem within their internal systems as the root cause. She took the initiative, navigating across various systems, including electronic health record systems, archives, health exchanges, and health information service provider systems. Kelly manually resolved the sync issue and ensured the records were sent over, earning the patient&#39;s gratitude. This act of service, particularly meaningful because she herself had ageing parents, brought Kelly immense joy.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Every day, several super-advocates like Kelly work in hospital networks to tackle a multitude of member issues, largely stemming from processes ripe for modernization or disparate systems needing to communicate with each other. Indeed, in every industry, many large corporations have teams like this one, who help bridge outdated, disconnected systems, and databases. Without them, there is no way companies can upgrade their technology without causing disruption to their operations. This scenario, though imagined, is ubiquitous in reality across companies and industries.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The problem is that running a company on disconnected or barely patched together systems affects employees at all levels. In another case, one that is real, a Fortune 500 CFO grappled each quarter with consolidating financial data from over 70 systems across 50 subsidiaries. The team had to meticulously extract, reconcile, integrate, and validate data from these systems, a time-consuming and risky process prone to inaccuracies.&lt;/p>; &lt;article-promo>; &lt;hbr-component type=&quot;promo&quot; is-insight=&quot;insight-center&quot; title=&quot;The Future of Work&quot; dek=&quot;Will your company adapt or be left behind?&quot; cta-text=&quot;&quot; href=&quot;/insight-center/the-future-of-work&quot;>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/insight-center/the-future-of-work&quot; style=&quot;color:black;text-decoration:none&quot;>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; Insight Center Collection &lt;/div>; &lt;h3>;The Future of Work&lt;/h3>; &lt;div>; Will your company adapt or be left behind? &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hbr-component>; &lt;/article-promo>; &lt;p>;Every quarter the finance team and the IT team debated &lt;em>;the same &lt;/em>;issues: &lt;em>;Why do we have a plethora of diverse systems? Why don&#39;t these systems talk to each other? What can we do to eliminate these data silos that create more risk, delays, and effort? &lt;/em>;&lt;em>;How can we dismantle these data silos that contribute to risks, delays, and additional effort?&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Like Kelly, the finance and IT teams, and the CFO, most workers are familiar with some version of these frustrations, no matter their job, department, or industry. They spend hours moving data from one system to another, troubleshooting incompatible applications, and often accept this dysfunction as an unavoidable friction in their work. But most companies have no idea how bad the problem is, because they haven&#39;t taken the time to quantify the impact this disconnection has on business outcomes.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To understand what disconnected systems are costing companies — what we call “disconnection debt” — we measured the impact of information silos arising from disconnected systems, on business outcomes in over 100 teams across companies. Here&#39;s what companies need to know about this problem — and how they can fix it.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Disconnection Debt: The cost of disconnected systems on business&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;In an ideal world, all systems in an organization would be integrated with each other in the backend with APIs and seamlessly talk to each other. For users — that is, employees — that would mean eschewing repetitive and manual work in copying or extracting information from multiple sources. Instead, users should ideally use their experience, judgement, and training to make decisions or recommendations based on information provided by the system, which is responsible for doing the tedious work of gathering that information from multiple sources. &amp;nbsp;But this is rarely the case.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Disconnected systems exist because each system is built to meet the organization&#39;s needs at a particular point in time. But over time, as business needs and workflows evolve, there is a gap between how these systems are designed and the evolving business needs. A cloud system, for example, does not talk to a mainframe system. And today&#39;s new system is likely to be tomorrow&#39;s disconnected legacy system. When organizations accept this as an unavoidable problem, they are implicitly accepting long-term costs: inefficiency, errors, delays that customers or end consumers experience, and risks to the business in terms of risks to revenue, impediment to scaling, customer experience, churn, or loss of market share.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To bridge these gaps, all organizations tend to “throw people at the problem”: employees manually extract data from multiple systems, make decisions, and then input data back into the relevant systems. These employees, act as human adhesive between disparate systems, taking on “swivel chair” roles. This, of course, comes with cognitive and productivity costs associated with &lt;a href=&quot;/2022/08/how-much-time-and-energy-do-we-waste-toggling-between-applications&quot;>;toggling between numerous applications&lt;/a>;. But that is only one part of the overall cost. Disconnected systems give rise to information silos that impose significant manual effort and excessive delays in execution. Ultimately, these shortcomings highlight the true cost of the disconnected debt: consistent negative impact on organizational outcomes and key performance indicators, therefore exacerbating risk. Organizations pay these costs over long periods of time.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To understand just how much the drag of disconnected systems was costing companies, we studied over 103 teams engaged in over 42 processes, in over 1,000 instances, in 13 key functions across 10 Fortune 500 companies and 8 small and medium-sized businesses. We used a work graph — a digital map of how teams work in organizations — to identify where and how these costs arose, sorting them across cost, customer experience, employee experience, revenue, and risk. The companies we looked at spanned banking, retail, telecom, life science, and consumer goods. To estimate the sole impact of disconnected systems on business outcomes, we left out the toggling tax that teams pay.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We found a high variance in the impact of disconnected systems on business outcomes. In some cases, teams spent up to 60% of their working day on activities arising from such systems — extracting information from multiple systems, entering data into other systems, etc. This inefficient use of effort contributed to “disconnection debt” — costs that organizations pay in terms of poor business outcomes and key performance indicators.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The results we found across functions and teams, and their impact on business outcomes are summarized in the table below.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;!-- table start -- Disconnection Debt -- ajrp 2023 -->;&lt;/p>;

&lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>; &lt;!-- table end -- Disconnection Debt -- ajrp 2023 -->;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Regardless of the size of the company, we found that disconnection debt was responsible for slower execution, redundant manual efforts, and more errors. The end impact on business outcomes is likely range of possibilities, including, slower revenue growth, increased costs, more risk, and poorer customer and employee experience.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, in the above table, disconnected systems caused a US-based fast-moving consumer goods retailer an additional 10% delay (amounting to a few extra days) when selling $300,000,000 of its products to distribution channels each year. Similarly, over 6,000 new employees joining a F500 life sciences company experienced additional delay of four weeks in completing their onboarding formalities. Finally, in one instance, customers signing up for a new bank account experienced several days of delay in being approved. During this process, because systems in the backend were not well integrated, the organization had repeated back and forth with customers, requesting them to fill in additional forms and details. And slow internal processes that required pulling together data from multiple systems and then stitching them together. Not only did all this result in poor customer experience but also, the management was concerned that they are likely to lose prospective customers to competition, who offered a more streamlined experience for signing up. Other areas of organizations that we have not yet studied will suffer from similar costs of disconnected systems. In the few cases where teams were not suffering from disconnection debt, we found they were either performing all their work within one system or were largely involved in making decisions, based on data from one system.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;What Leaders Can Do&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;As business needs evolve, information silos arising from disconnected systems and the risk they pose to business outcomes will continue to be a reality. This issue affects all parts of an organization and creates risk to businesses. Hence, dealing with this issue needs to be on the agenda for all leaders in organizations. CEOs and risk committees on the board must set quarterly targets and metrics to actively track and mitigate risks arising from disconnected systems.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Essentially, organizations need to take a product management lifecycle approach to managing disconnected systems and always stay on top of this problem.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A thumb rule to prioritize which areas to investigate further and improve — teams in critical parts of your business that spend more than 5% of their workday extracting information from at least 2-3 disconnected systems. Hence, to get started, the first priority of leaders ought to be in gaining visibility — finding silos that may be hurting the business and mitigating their impact.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;1. Gain visibility into the existence and impact of disconnected systems on business outcomes&lt;/h3>; &lt;h3>;Find your “Kellys”:&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Find colleagues, often on the frontlines, with firsthand insights into customer frustrations caused by disconnected systems. Foster a culture where they can openly share friction points with senior leaders, generating a heatmap of customer challenges. Supplement this with social listening and direct exposure of senior leaders to distressed calls. Some companies have embraced a “&lt;a href=&quot;https://hbsp.harvard.edu/product/115006-PDF-ENG&quot;>;zero distance&lt;/a>;” approach, striving to comprehend frontline issues and systematically address them.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Create telemetry for your systems and processes:&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;With today&#39;s tools, you can map and measure system interactions, &lt;a href=&quot;/2021/12/do-you-know-how-your-teams-get-work-done&quot;>;creating a “work-graph,” a map of how your teams get work done&lt;/a>;. This helps identify and quantify breakpoints, especially between departments and systems. Consequently, it allows for a prioritized list of the busiest breakpoints in your processes.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A combination of finding “Kellys” and the work-graph gives you a priority list to attack with short-term and long-term fixes. Overlapping breakpoints or friction points highlighted by your “Kellys” and the work-graph measurements yield priorities that you can address with conviction. Make this a weekly discipline in your company. Create metrics and targets out of this visibility that is sent all the way to your board&#39;s risk committees.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;2. Short-term fixes to buy time.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;There are short-term fixes for these problems, which function more as band-aid solutions that are susceptible to changes in the business including acquisitions, regulatory changes, process changes, etc. But they can ameliorate the situation and buy more time for long-term changes. Solutions include:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;Building single-pane applications: their sole purpose is to gather data from multiple systems and aggregate them into a single view. Hence, users will not spend effort in manually pulling data from multiple systems and instead focus on a &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/sap-lens/best-practice-1-7.html&quot;>;single application window&lt;/a>;.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Automating tasks: that pull data from multiple systems, pre-populating fields in applications, and writing data back into systems. However, this solution is temporary since it does not fix the underlying problem and may only lead to proliferating more automation solutions on top of disconnected solutions.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Leverage latest advances in computing: LLMs, among other tools, may be useful in extracting unstructured information from multiple systems, reducing manual effort, and normalizing them into a structured format.&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;These solutions shift the mechanical manual effort in extracting information from disconnected systems, from humans to software. This approach mitigates the risk of disconnectedness and buys business leaders room to fix the root issue in the underlying problem. For example, an outdated and slow system, despite the automation built on top, still slows down the overall airline booking process and customer experience.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;3. Long-term fixes.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Sustainable long-term solutions are expensive and difficult to implement. Typically, they may involve:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;Fundamentally re-engineering systems leveraging newer technology: These initiatives take 18–36 months and usually involve a larger change management effort that requires a lot of discipline.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Mandate building more APIs and adapters that are faster, more scalable, and secure. As business needs evolve and new workflows are created, these APIs and interfaces will need to be updated.&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;But these sorts of changes are not discrete events since business needs continue to evolve and hence these newly engineering systems too will soon be out of date. Hence, organizations need a strategy of constantly iterating – gaining visibility into the current impact of disconnected systems on business goals, short-term fixes to buy some time and space, and a long-term deeper fix. And to then iterate again from the beginning.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 11 Oct 2023 21:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[3 Ways to Determine What Your Customer Really Values]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/10/3-ways-to-determine-what-your-customer-really-values]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/10/Oct23_11_1219096552.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;Klaus Vedfelt/Getty Images&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;Companies often get into trouble because they make the wrong assumptions about what is valuable to stakeholders. A good way to avoid this trap is to reflect where your company sits on these three scales, which you should do in the order presented: commoditized vs. customized; rational vs. emotional; and assessable vs. unknowable.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/10/3-ways-to-determine-what-your-customer-really-values?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/10/3-ways-to-determine-what-your-customer-really-values?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;Producing value sits at the very heart of business strategy and competitive advantage. It&#39;s the reason Singapore Airlines, for example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/Airline_Review-d8729151-Reviews-Singapore-Airlines&quot;>;consistently makes it to the top airline list&lt;/a>; and why Toyota, for instance, is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/martyswant/2021/12/16/why-toyota-is-the-top-auto-brand-in-the-halo-100/?sh=7ed923e16171&quot;>;rated so highly among its peers&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But “value” is a term that is surprisingly misused and misunderstood. There are many places to trip and fall when it comes to “creating value” due to wrong assumptions about what is valuable to stakeholders. A good way to avoid this trap is to reflect where your company sits on these three scales, which you should do in the order presented.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;1. Commoditized vs. Customized&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;A few years ago, I was conducting my strategy workshop for a group of managers from different industries. I was pointing out that value is created by many factors, and I told the group that it is usually a mistake to lower prices in the push for competitive advantage because price does not equal value. Trevor, an executive from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bhp.com/&quot;>;BHP&lt;/a>;, Australia&#39;s largest mining company, piped up with: “What if you&#39;re a price taker not a price maker?”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;BHP sells iron ore, metallurgical coal, copper, and other minerals around the globe. Trevor was referring to the fact that BHP sells “commodities.” I offered my suggestions on other areas of possible differentiation, like on-time delivery and customer service. But these aren&#39;t big drivers of choice when it comes to buyers in Chinese companies. They tend to take these things for granted. Even the quality of the products isn&#39;t a differentiator as coal, iron ore, and other minerals are graded to a specification. In other words, Trevor was right, price does equal value in the eyes of a customer when all other &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/05/dialing-up-the-volume-on-strategic-innovation&quot;>;strategic factors&lt;/a>; in the purchase decision are equal, which often occurs with commodities.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But I was right, too. Many other products and services are customized rather than commoditized, and, in these cases, price doesn&#39;t equal value. Steve, for example, is CEO of a kitchen design and installation company specializing in large and expensive homes. When his inquiries dropped, he leapt to the assumption that he was “too expensive.” So, he embarked on a round of price cutting. But was cost really the issue? To find out, we assisted by interviewing some of his clients who chose a competitor. A typical example was Jenna.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She&#39;d sought three quotes for the kitchen of her large home. “They came in at different prices, naturally,” she said. “I could have bought a new car at the prices supplied.” She explained that the kitchen contractor she chose wasn&#39;t the cheapest. More important to Jenna were four other factors: innovative design (she spent a lot of time with each contractor trying to find the best design solution), work quality (recommendations from previous customers about kitchen finishes), customer service (easy to deal with and good listening skills), and quality of inclusions (the brands of dishwasher, sink and taps recommended).&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The final factor, she said, was “trust.” It was “very important because she wasn&#39;t going to be there every day checking on the installation of plumbing and electrical fittings.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Your position on the scale of commoditized vs. customized depends on how much unique value you contribute to your products, which is why you need to start with this scale. If you&#39;re in the business of supplying raw materials, it may be that you don&#39;t add much value. This means that lowering your prices is your only option to increase competitive advantage. But this is not the case for most businesses. Your “value add” can include all sorts of factors from the experience of customers with your service to the quality of your materials. These are value factors that customers are willing to pay more for.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The next scale helps you figure out what kind of value you provide.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;2. Rational vs. Emotional&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Some years ago, I was CEO of a business that made trusses and frames for houses. These were prefabricated in our factory, loaded onto trucks, and hauled to a customer&#39;s building site. We provided everything a builder needed to erect the skeleton of a house. I was charged with turning the business around from a loss to a profit. This required us to achieve a competitive advantage. So, we needed to understand fully the criteria customers employed to judge “value.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Value for builders is determined by weighing up price against other &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/05/dialing-up-the-volume-on-strategic-innovation&quot;>;strategic factors.&lt;/a>; These include product quality (the product must meet specifications and stay together during erection), delivery (being on time is important, delays cost money), and customer service (technical advice and dealing with any issues). For builders, our customers, the purchase decision was very rational, involving carefully evaluated costs and benefits.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;a href=&quot;/2015/01/when-to-sell-with-facts-and-figures-and-when-to-appeal-to-emotions&quot;>;But not all products and services add value in such a rational way&lt;/a>;. Angeline is a Product Manager of a well-known international cosmetics company. Its products are sold mainly through large retail department stores. I asked her about “value” for her consumers, the users of the cosmetics.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She replied that “the decision isn&#39;t purely rational as image is very important. Consumers become emotionally connected to a brand.” She added, “that&#39;s why we link our products to well-known celebrities.” She also pointed out that online influencers are becoming increasingly important: “They can make or break a product.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Finding your place on the rational vs. emotional scale involves scrutinizing your customers&#39; decision-making processes. Are they influenced by any emotional factors or are they able to set emotions aside entirely and take a hard-nosed and rational approach? Many consumer decisions include an emotional component and the involved companies&#39; advertising is a dead giveaway. Think of the ads we see for products like cars, travel, or soft drinks. These ads position the products via branding and image to maximize non-rational value factors, such as celebrity endorsement and high-end imagery.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This brings us to the third scale, which helps clarify how the customer chooses you.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;3. Assessable vs Unknowable&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Picture this. Julie is driving home from work, and she realizes that she needs milk, bread, and rice. She doesn&#39;t want to line up at a supermarket, so she pops into her local convenience store. In making this decision she evaluates price (she&#39;ll pay more than at the supermarket), customer service (quick and pleasant), location (handy, on her route home), product range (they have what she wants), hours of operation (they are open) and store presentation (clean and well organized).&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;All this is very assessable by her, and she comes to the decision to steer into her local convenience store rather than the busy underground car park at the supermarket. The criteria relevant to her decision are known and can be evaluated by her.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But in other cases, this isn&#39;t the situation. Take the case of my friend Jim, who recently had a knee replacement. I asked him how he chose his surgeon. “He was recommended by my local doctor,” he said. “He appears to have a good reputation. But, boy, he&#39;s expensive.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Jim&#39;s decision wasn&#39;t based on price. In fact, I&#39;ve yet to hear anyone say that they&#39;ve just had their hip or knee replaced by “the cheapest surgeon in town.” So, what was it based on?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Jim didn&#39;t have the specialist and technical knowledge to assess value. His perception of value was based on reputation and word of mouth. He assumed these factors would be reflected in the price — so the higher the price, the better the value.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you&#39;re in the business of selling products or services to customers who don&#39;t have the background knowledge to know exactly how they work, you need to figure out your place along the assessable vs unknowable scale. Customers making purchases in these areas are forced to rely on other sources of information to make their buy decisions. You must ensure that you&#39;re presenting well across those other sources.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;That&#39;s why Jim&#39;s specialist includes reference to a great deal of recent research from reputable teaching hospitals in the literature he provides to patients in pamphlets, on his website and in person. He also includes detailed descriptions of the cutting-edge technology he uses, to demonstrate he&#39;s up to date. Finally, he includes many testimonials from former patients telling their stories in their own words.&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;• • •&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are many ways you can get confused when it comes to figuring out what your customers value. But thinking where you stand on the three value scales will help you identify what kind of unique value you deliver, whether it&#39;s tangible or intangible, and how your customer recognizes it. That&#39;s how you&#39;ll build a real, sustainable competitive advantage.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 11 Oct 2023 20:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[The Future of Mental Health at Work Is Safety, Community, and a Healthy Organizational Culture]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/10/the-future-of-mental-health-at-work-is-safety-community-and-a-healthy-organizational-culture]]><description> &lt;div>;

&lt;p>;2019 年，Mind Share Partners 与 Qualtrics 合作开始了两年一次的工作中心理健康报告，以探索员工经验和观点不断变化的格局围绕心理健康、耻辱和工作。每份报告都收集了 1,500 名全职美国工人的全国代表性样本。每一项还包括来自历史上边缘化人群的统计显着样本：女性、有色人种、LGBTQ+ 工人等。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;今年，我们的 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mindsharepartners.org/mentalhealthatworkreport -2023&quot;>;第三项研究&lt;/a>;揭示了有关大流行之前、期间和之后工作场所心理健康如何变化的新见解。以下是我们发现的关于员工在工作中心理健康方面的愿望和需求的信息，以及雇主如何提供这些信息。&lt;/p>;

&lt;h2>;Mind Share Partners 2023 年工作心理健康报告的主要发现&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;今年的研究表明，心理健康美国的情况并没有改善，但也出现了一些新的亮点。工人们对工作中的心理健康表现出越来越高的认识，并超越传统福利和最新技术。他们越来越想要的是研究一直显示有效的东西：心理更健康的文化。我们的发现如下：&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;员工正在从危机转向萎靡不振。&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;从 2019 年到 2021 年，心理健康症状激增，员工对心理健康的总体看法下降。 2023 年，我们发现报告任何症状的人数下降了 20%，这是一个充满希望的趋势。但当被要求对过去一年的整体心理健康状况进行评分（满分 10 分）时，工人的评分持续下降。 2019 年，78% 的人给出了 7 到 10 的评分。2021 年，67% 的人给出了评分。 2023 年，61% 的评分在 7 到 10 之间，&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/hr-topics/organizational-and-employee-development/pages/financial-strain-impacts-workers -mental-health.aspx&quot;>;据报道，财务&lt;/a>;和工作本身对心理健康的负面影响最大。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;心理健康状况如何看似同时改善和恶化？心理健康包括各种各样的经历，从可诊断的状况和症状到悲伤、倦怠和压力等挑战。摆脱大流行的许多危机缓解了当时许多心理健康挑战的严重性。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但工人们进入了一个充满挑战的新世界：通货膨胀、增长&lt;a href=&quot;https:// time.com/5888024/50-trillion-venue-inequality-america/&quot;>;收入不平等&lt;/a>;和&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2023/venue- Poor-health-insurance-coverage.html&quot;>;贫困率&lt;/a>;、裁员、&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/companies-making-workers-employees-return-to-office-rto -wfh-hybrid-2023-1&quot;>;强制返回办公室&lt;/a>;，雇主加倍努力&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/31/google-ceo-to- Employees-productivity-and-focus-must-improve.html&quot;>;生产力&lt;/a>;和&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vox.com/recode/22841490/work-remote-wages-labor-force -participation-great-resignation-unions-quits&quot;>;在&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/09/03/business”浪潮中，雇主和工人之间的紧张关系日益加剧&lt;/a>; /economy/strikes-union-sag-uaw.html&quot;>;工会化&lt;/a>;。这些问题本质上是社会、政治和经济问题。虽然治疗和冥想肯定可以帮助个体工人应对，但从根本上解决这些问题需要系统干预。许多人，比如年轻人，仍在&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/07/science/pandemic-adolescents-depression-anxiety.html&quot;>;危机&lt;/a>;中挣扎。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;因此，许多人陷入了一种压倒性的感觉，嗯，“废话”，或者正如著名组织心理学家 Adam Grant 在 2021 年创造的那样，他们“&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes” .com/2021/04/19/well/mind/covid-mental-health-languishing.html&quot;>;陷入困境&lt;/a>;。”&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;投资组织文化胜过治疗和自我保健。&lt; /h3>; &lt;p>;从历史上看，雇主提供的心理健康支持主要集中在产品化、个性化的方法上——治疗、应用程序、休假。这为员工提供了在工作之外的业余时间自我管理心理健康的资源。同时，这也意味着应该私下处理此事。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;然而，在过去几年中，&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.entrepreneur.com/business- news/poor-working-conditions-can-impact-your-mental-health/450455&quot;>;围绕心理健康与工作本身之间相互依赖性的研究继续变得更加有力。 &lt;a href=&quot;/2019/12/burnout-is-about-your-workplace-not-your-people&quot;>;职业倦怠&lt;/a>;尤其是&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/ news/item/28-05-2019-职业倦怠现象-国际-分类-疾病&quot;>;世界卫生组织将其定义为&lt;/a>;，其根本原因是工作场所压力管理不善。同样，顶尖的倦怠研究专家克里斯蒂娜·马斯拉赫 (Christina Maslach) 指出了&lt;a href=&quot;/2021/02/beyond-burned-out&quot;>;导致倦怠的六大主要原因&lt;/a>;：不可持续的工作量、感知到的缺乏控制力、努力奖励不足、缺乏支持性社区、缺乏公平以及价值观和技能不匹配——所有这些都是工作场所因素。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;为了更好地了解工人的需求，我们要求今年的受访者评价以下因素对他们心理健康的帮助程度：&lt; /p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;心理健康治疗&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;心理健康的自我保健资源&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;有利于心理健康的安全和支持性文化&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;健康的文化和可持续的工作文化&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;在所有受访者中，健康和可持续的文化成为明显的赢家，78％的人认为它有中等、非常或极其有帮助。当按照性别、代际、LGBTQ+ 身份、种族和族裔、照顾者状况和资历水平对结果进行细分时，这一点仍然成立。其次是有利于心理健康的安全和支持性文化（67%），其次是心理健康治疗（64%）和自我保健资源（60%）。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;员工对心理健康的认识也不断提高。更好地了解什么样的支持才是真正有帮助的——不仅仅是应付工作。员工们将心理健康视为工作场所的集体责任，而不是个人的责任。支持工作中的心理健康越来越意味着从根本上重新调整组织文化与人类福祉。&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;心理安全感有所下降。&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;从我们 2019 年至 2021 年的研究中，员工变得更加愿意交谈了解心理健康，并对心理健康和患有心理健康问题的人形成更健康的信念。两者都表明心理健康耻辱感有所减少。随着雇主增加对心理健康资源的投资，更多的工人也表示感受到了支持。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;然而，进入 2023 年，一个悖论出现了。工人的个人信仰继续反映了对心理健康的更大认识和理解。然而，他们也觉得在工作中谈论心理健康不太安全，不太可能这样做，而且今年在心理健康方面得到雇主的支持较少——而且这些下降接近大流行前的水平。事实上，员工对向高层领导谈论心理健康的满意度几乎下降了一半，从 2021 年的 37% 降至 2023 年的 19%。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;不幸的是，这并不奇怪。尽管许多雇主在心理健康方面进行了投资，但许多雇主也“重返业务”&lt;a href=&quot;https://about.fb.com/news/2023/03/mark-zuckerberg-meta-year-of-效率/&quot;>;生产力&lt;/a>;、&lt;a href=&quot;https://fortune.com/2023/06/01/marc-benioff-salesforce-performance-culture-earnings-call/&quot;>;绩效&lt;/a>; , &lt;a href=&quot;https://tech.co/news/heres-what-google-meta-and-co-have-cut-to-save-costs&quot;>;底线成本&lt;/a>;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://fortune.com/2023/01/10/resistance-attrition-quiet-quitting-drop-diversity-forced-return-to-office-gleb-tsipursky/&quot;>;返回办公室计划&lt;/a >; 和&lt;a href=&quot;https://abcnews.go.com/US/corporate-america-slashing-dei-workers-amid-backlash-diversity/story?id=100477952&quot;>;对 DEI 的投资&lt;/a>; - 同时仍然鼓励灵活性和工作与生活的平衡，尽管工作的现实使其更加难以实现。在复杂的信号中，尽管个人层面的意识有所提高，信念更加健康，但员工在组织内的心理安全感却恶化了。&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;对 DEI 的投资正在改善心理健康和参与度。&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>; Mind Share Partners 自 2019 年以来与 Qualtrics 合作进行的所有三项研究都表明，来自边缘化身份群体的人在心理健康和工作方面面临着不成比例的挑战。今年，女性、Z 世代、黑人、拉丁裔和 LGBTQ+ 受访者的心理健康状况往往比同龄人更差；当他们谈论工作中的心理健康时，不太可能得到支持性回应；总体而言，他们对工作满意度、信任、自豪感和留在雇主的意愿的参与程度较低。这些结果代表了文化和制度的持续存在，这些文化和制度不仅导致了公然的歧视行为，而且还导致了招聘、发展和支持流程中嵌入的偏见。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;好的一面是什么？雇主的努力得到了回报，并为工人的经历带来了有意义的改变。感觉雇主支持其身份的受访者在心理健康以及工作对心理健康的影响方面表现出更好的结果，并且总体上与那些感觉不支持的受访者相比，他们对雇主更加投入和忠诚。&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;返回办公室问题的答案是自主权。&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;关于混合工作的争论持续升温&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2023/07/远程工作返回办公室政策/674736/&quot;>;有争议&lt;/a>;。在今年的研究中，我们询问参与者是否亲自工作、混合工作或完全远程工作。此外，我们还询问他们这样做是出于选择还是雇主强制要求的。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在比较不同工作情况的关键结果时，没有出现一致的主题。然而，可以自由决定工作地点的混合型员工的心理健康症状持续时间较短，工作对心理健康的积极影响更大，在工作中谈论心理健康更舒适，因心理健康原因离职的可能性更低，以及更大的自豪感和在当前雇主工作两年或更长时间的意愿。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;没有、也永远不会有一种明确“更好”或“更差”的单一、普遍的工作方式” 比另一个。 （还记得&lt;a href=&quot;/2019/11/the-truth-about-open-offices&quot;>;开放式办公室&lt;/a>;吗？）好处总是会因公司、职能、行业、地区、文化而异，&lt; a href=&quot;https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/worklab/in-the-office-it-is-all-about-moments-that-matter&quot;>;员工生命周期的阶段&lt;/a >;、团队成员个人的需求和偏好等等。然而，对工作地点的关注分散了工作的许多其他方面，例如我们的工作时间或沟通方式。更重要的是，它掩盖了一个更基本的问题：个人的能力选择&lt;/a>;适合他们的方式。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;雇主可以做什么&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;自 2017 年成立以来，Mind Share Partners 一直与跨行业、跨规模和跨地区的全球组织合作。随着我们继续加强雇主内部的培训、战略咨询和实施工作以及更广泛的运动建设和宣传举措，我们根据今年的调查结果为组织提供了五项关键战略：&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;共同重新设想一个心理健康的工作场所。&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;对于心理健康的工作场所，永远不会有一个一刀切的愿景。要实现这一目标，需要根据组织的规模、阶段、行业、地区、个人角色等，集体重新设想工作场所心理健康对组织中的每个人（领导者和员工）意味着什么。首先要了解您的组织、组织内部的心理健康状况，以及最终您的员工的需求。这意味着&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mindsharepartners.org/post/5-workplace-mental-health-questions-to-include-in-employee-pulse-and-employee-engagement-surveys&quot;>;测量&lt; /a>; 心理健康和工作场所因素，定期询问员工的观点，并根据员工的需求制定真正、有意义的变革。将这些努力进一步融入组织的文化、系统、&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mindsharepartners.org/post/prioritizing-mental-health-throughout-employee-journey-mapping&quot;>;员工生命周期&lt;/a>; ，而业务战略确保将福祉融入企业本身，而不是简单地归入人力资源&lt;a href=&quot;/2019/08/what-wellness-programs-dont-do-for-workers&quot;>;福祉计划&lt; /a>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;实现自上而下和自下而上的文化变革。&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;今年的研究表明，员工希望有更安全、更有利于心理健康的支持性文化，以及更健康、更可持续的工作文化一般来说。不可避免地，这种文化变革需要自上而下和自下而上的方法。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;从上层开始，领导者可以告诉自己&lt;a href=&quot;/2023/05/leaders-sharing-your- own-mental-health-story-can-help-you-become-a-better-ally&quot;>;组织内的心理健康故事&lt;/a>;，或者像 Mind Share Partners 那样向外公开分享&lt;a href=&quot; https://www.mindsharepartners.org/leadersgofirst&quot;>;领导者先行&lt;/a>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mindsharepartners.org/leadersgofirst&quot;>;活动&lt;/a>;。这可以使心理健康正常化，并帮助其他人在工作中轻松地谈论它（如果他们愿意的话）。他们还可以塑造健康的工作实践，特别是作为领导者、资源团队和个人，以保持健康和可持续的工作方式。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;自下而上，雇主和个体工人都可以探索对话论坛，例如&lt;a href=&quot;/2020/05/how-to-form-a-mental-health-employee-resource-group&quot;>;员工资源组&lt;/a>;、&lt;a href=&quot;https://www. mindsharepartners.org/peerlisteningprograms&quot;>;同伴倾听计划&lt;/a>;、跨职能心理健康工作组或&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mindsharepartners.org/casestudy-pgim&quot;>;心理健康冠军网络&lt; /a>;.这些对话可以是关于心理健康的，但也可以在团队内部进行，以建立工作规范，探索&lt;a href=&quot;/2023/08/the-radical-promise-of-truly-flexible-work&quot;>;包容性灵活性&lt; /a>;，并授权个人决定如何最好地工作。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;自然而然的一步是让您的员工能够领导这一变革。这通常是通过跨级别的培训来实现的，从管理和公平的角度采取积极主动的预防性方法，而不仅仅是“注意到警告信号”。工人和领导者都需要制定策略来创造心理安全和可持续的工作文化。提升员工技能还可以包括&lt;a href=&quot;/2020/08/8-ways-managers-can-support-employees-mental-health&quot;>;经理计划&lt;/a>;、领导力辅导、指导等。&lt;/ p>; &lt;h3>;探索根本原因解决方案以及健康福利。&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;在管理任何策略或预算时，很容易陷入投资“快速修复”计划和产品的陷阱，而没有批判性地评估其目的。例如，&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/mindsharepartners/2019/10/10/the-futility-of-mental-health-days/&quot;>;心理健康日&lt;/a>;声称休息和恢复活力的好处，并且经常伴随着乐观的意识口号，例如“不好也没关系！”这可以实现值得称赞的意图：休息、提高认识并引发更广泛的对话。但之后会发生什么呢？嗯，在很多情况下，它又回到了同样的流失和烧毁状态。更糟糕的是，它使雇主能够在个人韧性的幌子下继续“不好”（即不可持续）的商业行为。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;领导者需要提供应对和解决问题的方法。根本原因。该领域的参与者数量不断增加 - &lt;a href=&quot;https://time.com/6308096/therapy-mental-health-worse-us/&quot;>;医疗保健提供者&lt;/a>;，&lt;a href =&quot;/2019/08/what-wellness-programs-dont-do-for-workers&quot;>;健康计划&lt;/a>;，&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/the-unbearable- Irony-of-meditation-apps/&quot;>;冥想应用程序&lt;/a>;——每个应用程序都有自己的理念、方法、产品和业务目标。所有这些方法都有其独特的好处，这些好处通常在科学文献中都有体现，但是当员工要求建立健康且可持续的工作文化时，这些方法&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eidCHlP8_bQ&quot;>;可能会没有解决正确的问题&lt;/a>;。&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;重新致力于工作本身的基础。&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;虽然每个组织都不同，但仍然有每个工作场所必须有意义地解决的核心基础培养心理健康的劳动力：&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;安全：&lt;/strong>;这包括身心安全、财务稳定以及长期的平衡和可持续性。&lt;/li >; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;自主性：&lt;/strong>;这包括完成工作所需的时间、带宽和资源；对工作的控制力、灵活性和可预测性；并拥有发言权。&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;归属感：&lt;/strong>;这包括能够真实地工作、建立有意义的联系并获得支持，并感受到与他人的整体社区意识。&lt; /li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;不幸的是，这些是人类的核心需求，但由于雇主在不解决基本问题的情况下追求健康福利，这些需求往往被忽视。如需更深入地了解，请探索美国卫生局局长&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hhs.gov/surgeongeneral/priorities/workplace-well-being/index.html&quot;>;最近推出的工作场所心理框架&lt;/a>;健康和福祉，Mind Share Partners 合作。&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;坚持 DEI。&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;雇主在解决世界不平等问题上的地位一直受到激烈争论。至少。但让我们更简单地看看他们控制范围内的东西：工作场所。组织不仅有避免不平等现象长期存在的道德责任，而且有机会帮助员工从人类多样性、友情和共同目标中蓬勃发展。今年的数据显示，当社会身份得到支持时，员工的心理健康和参与度会更好。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;心理健康和 DEI &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mindsharepartners.org/diversityinclusion&quot;>;本质上是联系在一起的。历史上被边缘化的群体在工作和寻求帮助时都面临着更多的文化和结构障碍心理健康支持。鉴于应对心理健康挑战的人们普遍存在&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.psychiatry.org/ Patients-families/stigma-and-discrimination&quot;>;耻辱和边缘化&lt;/a>;，心理健康也是 DEI 中的一个类别或有条件地生活。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;最终，DEI 是为了让工作为每个人服务。当然，就像任何有远见的目标一样，这需要人力、预算、战略规划和跨职能投资。不幸的是，一些雇主&lt;a href=&quot;https://qz.com/it-shouldn-t-be-this-easy-for-companies-to-walk-back-th-1850686363&quot;>;回避&lt;/a >; 来自 DEI 的平权行动&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/30/business/economy/hiring-affirmative-action.html&quot;>;回滚&lt;/a>;。其他人则保持坚定和承诺，部分是出于商业需要。 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mindsharepartners.org/post/mind-share-partners-to-corporate-america-stay-the-course-on-dei&quot;>;我们的消息&lt;/a>;？坚持到底。&lt;/​​p>; &lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;。 。 .&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;通常需要几十年的社会运动，工作场所心理健康运动只需几年就能实现。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当我们展望未来时，工作场所心理健康运动将最终需要“回到基础”。工人们不再希望琐碎的福利分散他们的工作注意力。他们希望有稳定的就业来减轻财务焦虑，希望得到认可以知道自己很重要，希望有可持续的工作量来防止倦怠，希望有一个支持性的社区来找到归属感，希望能够灵活地决定工作如何适合他们，希望有自主权和发言权来感受到尊重、代理和支持。对工作和生活的所有权。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;工作中心理健康的未来不会是新兴的技术复兴或混合工作的转变。未来将是对人类核心需求的重新承诺。这将是安全、社区和健康的组织文化。这将是植根于公平和工人声音的可持续工作。 The future of workplace mental health will start with exactly that: work itself.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->;

&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div >; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/10/why-your-organization-should-use-salary-benchmarking?language=es&quot;>;阅读西班牙语&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/10/ Why-your-organization-should-use-salary-benchmarking?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;美国多个州最近的透明度政策，例如阻止雇主要求的薪资历史禁令候选人报告自己的薪酬甚至薪资期望，更加关注工作场所的公平薪资实践。因此，对确定适当薪酬的策略的需求不断增加。一个关键的解决方案在于薪资基准：使用汇总的市场数据来建立有竞争力的薪资水平。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;设定薪资是一种平衡行为：你不想提供相对于市场而言过高的薪资，因为那样会影响你的薪资水平。会很浪费；但提供低于市场水平的薪资可能会导致难以吸引、留住和激励员工。雇主如何找到他们的最佳位置？&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nber.org/papers/w30570&quot;>;最近的研究&lt;/a>;中，我们开发了一个理论模型阐明了薪资基准的需求。在我们的模型中，公司确切地知道求职者会带来多少价值。该公司希望向候选人提供低于该价值的报价，以保留部分价值作为利润。但是，报价应该低多少呢？报价越低，节省的费用就越高。另一方面，如果报价太低，公司可能会面临将求职者流失到另一家公司的风险 - 他们可能会拒绝报价，或者接受报价并很快离开。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;因此，无论是公司想要提供或多或少激进的报价，很大程度上取决于公司认为求职者的市场价值：即，其他公司愿意为该求职者支付多少费用。这就是薪资基准的用武之地：公司可以使用类似员工（例如，具有相同职位头衔和行业）接受的报价数据来确保他们的报价相对于市场基准不会太低或太高。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我们的研究还提供了经验证据，表明获得薪资基准对公司设定的薪资有重大影响。我们与美国最大的薪资处理公司 ADP 合作开展这项工作，为 650,000 家公司提供服务，并为 2000 万美国人处理薪资。除了薪资服务外，公司还以薪资基准的形式汇总薪资记录中的薪资数据。然后，客户可以以用户友好的方式&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.adp.com/what-we-offer/products/adp-datacloud.aspx&quot;>;搜索&lt;/a>;他们想要的任何职位。它是最先进的基准工具之一，被许多知名公司所使用。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我们的数据涵盖了该工具从 2015 年底首次引入市场时一直到 2015 年年初的整个过程。我们的样本包括 584 家获得该工具使用权的“治疗”公司和 1,431 家未获得该工具但因与治疗公司具有相似特征而被选中的“控制”公司。我们研究了处理公司在使用基准测试工具之前和之后不久的薪资变化，并将其与对照公司相应的薪资变化进行了比较。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这是我们的发现：让我们可以说，当一家公司选择的薪资处于同一职位、行业和州的中位数薪资的狭窄范围（5%）内时，他们就设定了“正确”的薪资。在使用基准测试工具之前，公司设定“正确”薪资的可能性为 11.6%。使用基准测试工具后，设定“正确”薪资的可能性增加了两倍，达到 22.1%。这是令人信服的证据，表明这些薪资基准真正影响了薪资设定，并导致各公司的职位级别薪资趋同。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我们还发现，薪资基准的影响相当对称。在查看基准之后，企业不太可能支付远高于市场的价格，大概是因为这会造成浪费； but firms are also less likely to pay significantly below-market, presumably because it would be costly in terms of attracting, retaining and motivating employees.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For standardized positions, such as bank teller and receptionist, we found some evidence of a modest increase in the average salary. If employers are choosing to raise salaries for this group, it must be because they expect to get something in return, right? For instance, bumping salaries up to market may allow employers to retain their employees and save those pesky turnover costs. Our research shows that, indeed, benchmarking improves retention. Among employees in these roles, the gain of about 6% in average salary was followed by an increase of about 16% in the retention rate over the following 12 months.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;How can I use salary benchmarking?&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;The payroll data show that high quality salary benchmarks sway employers to set pay closer to the marketplace median pay, and that benchmark users benefit from a boost in employee retention. But how exactly does one go about sourcing and using a salary benchmark?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Salary benchmarks are wide ranging; some are created by the government and others exclusive to the clients of consulting firms. Still others are crowdsourced data from anonymous employees. For example, the US government reports average earnings at the six-digit occupation code, within industry and state, each year using surveys of businesses and households. These data are highly representative, but are released infrequently and at a higher level of aggregation than the sought after position level information. Meanwhile, several large consulting firms offer exclusive access to the aggregated earnings of their clients, often using proprietary standardized corporate titles. Most recently, firms that collect salary information as part of their core businesses, like ADP, have added user interfaces that make these data accessible as benchmarks. And platforms like Glassdoor have encouraged millions of users to volunteer their salary information anonymously in exchange for seeing the average inputs of others at the position level.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To better understand how firms use salary benchmarking, we also conducted a survey with the members of the Society for Human Resource Management Research Institute (SHRM). We collected responses from a large sample of 2,085 HR managers in charge of pay-setting. This sample spans organizations of every size, state and industry, including both public and private sectors. To complement this data, we conducted an additional survey with a sample of clients from ADP, in which we obtained responses from 720 HR managers in charge of pay-setting.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Employers use salary benchmarking for a wide range of purposes. For instance, 54% of respondents use benchmarking when setting the pay of new hires. Other popular uses include salary negotiations (53%), setting ranges for specific job titles (90%), and setting the salary for a job advertisement (41%). Employers also vary in terms of how frequently they consult salary benchmarks. For instance, while some employers do benchmarking for every single new hire (37% of respondents), the rest prefer to do it for some specific new hires or for some specific positions.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Our survey data indicates that employers differ in which data sources they use. The most popular option is to use industry surveys, chosen by 68% of respondents, but hiring a consulting firm to conduct these surveys can be quite expensive, and there is no guarantee that the survey data will live up to the expectations. If you do not have a big budget, you may also want to try the second most popular option: free online data sources (58% of respondents) such as Glassdoor.com. More recently, payroll service companies have gained popularity (used by 23% of respondents and the fastest growing source), which may give the best bang for your buck in terms of data quality. Most employers, however, use a combination of data sources. While the majority look at free online sources, on a scale of 1-5, HR professionals report that other sources are twice as trustworthy as free online sources.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Labor market trends can sometimes change rapidly, especially in the post-pandemic world. You do not need to check the benchmarks on a daily basis, but try to at least do it from time to time — remember that information, too, has an expiration date. Likewise, you may not have time to sit down to study market trends for every position in which you hire. However, make sure to at least do due diligence for the positions that are most critical for your business.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When using a benchmarking tool, you may feel information overload. Some tools provide not only the median pay, but also the mean, 10th percentile, 25th percentile, and so on and so forth. And some tools allow you to filter by industry, state, and other criteria. There are trade-offs. For instance, filters can allow you to focus on peer employers, but at the cost of smaller sample sizes and thus statistically imprecise benchmarks. While the right approach depends on the context at hand, according to our survey, there are some clear favorites: most firms (89%) prefer to look at the median market pay or the average market pay, and the most popular filters are by industry (87%) and state (84%).&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We also gave the survey respondents an opportunity to share their own tips and advice for salary benchmarking. Some recommended not relying on job title information alone, but rather to pay attention to the job description to ensure it&#39;s a good match. Another manager suggested that, to the extent possible, you should review the benchmarks regularly to stay in sync with the latest trends in the job market. In the same spirit, one manager recommends being proactive — do not wait until employees are unhappy about low pay and reach out to you, or you risk higher turnover.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In sum, the pay transparency revolution extends to firms knowing much more about what their competitors are offering. New high-quality sources have changed pay-setting practices. According to our latest study, keeping up with pay in the marketplace, and knowing how to use those sources, can affect your bottom-line retention and payroll costs. And from a societal perspective, this is closing the gap between pay across firms.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 10 Oct 2023 22:25:01 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[10 Reasons Why Inclusion Is a Competitive Advantage]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/10/10-reasons-why-inclusion-is-a-competitive-advantage]]><description>&lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/10/Oct23_10_457893079.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;Michael H/Getty Images&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;In their new book, &lt;em>;Move Fast and Fix Things&lt;/em>;, Frances Frei and Anne Morriss outline five strategies to help leaders tackle their hardest problems and quickly make change.

Today&#39;s excerpt is about inclusion, which Frei and Morriss define as the act of creating conditions that allow other people to thrive — not in spite of their differences as complex, multidimensional humans, but precisely because of those differences.&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;. 。 .&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Although it can be hard to measure a complex outcome like inclusion, researchers are getting better at it. Serious people are working to identify and quantify the many effects of inclusion on firm performance, and the insights they&#39;re generating are persuasive. Below is a list of some of our favorite findings, many of which remain generally underappreciated.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;1. Inclusion helps you recruit good people. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Inclusion is now a tell for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.glassdoor.com/employers/blog/diversity/&quot;>;all kinds of talented people&lt;/a>; — not only the underrepresented — that you&#39;ve built a healthy workplace and understand what it takes to collectively excel. Expect candidates to look for evidence of inclusiveness in everything from where you recruit to the fine print of your benefits package. For example, they may not need those same-sex fertility benefits or veteran mentorship services, but they&#39;ll still see them as a sign that you appreciate difference.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;2. Inclusion helps you retain good people.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;It turns out that those same candidates &lt;a href=&quot;/2018/12/to-retain-employees-focus-on-inclusion-not-just-diversity&quot;>;will stick around as employees&lt;/a>; if you truly walk the talk on inclusion. Inclusion drives &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jstor.org/stable/25067557&quot;>;higher rates of retention&lt;/a>; at all levels of the organization, and some employee segments (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.shrm.org/foundation/ourwork/initiatives/engaging-and-integrating-military-veterans/Documents/13056-G-01_SHRMF_WhyHireVet.pdf&quot;>;military veterans top the list&lt;/a>;) will reward your ability to value their unique contribution with industry-leading loyalty.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;3. Inclusion increases the engagement of your people. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Engagement scores are consistently higher for companies labeled “inclusive,” and we now have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/joshbersin/2015/12/06/why-diversity-and-inclusion-will-be-a-top-priority-for-2016/?sh=fc0a6632ed5b&quot;>;some interesting data&lt;/a>; that helps to explain these numbers. Inclusive companies are &lt;em>;also &lt;/em>;almost three times better at coaching people for improved performance and four times better at identifying and building leaders. Making people better is the key to their engagement, and inclusion seems to give you an advantage.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;4. &lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Inclusion makes you more resilient.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;When different types of people are thriving in your organization, &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/11/why-diverse-teams-are-smarter&quot;>;you&#39;re better at navigating crises&lt;/a>; and (our favorite business euphemism) “turbulent times” in general. You&#39;re more adaptable, more comfortable with change, and better at dealing with personnel problems. One fun fact: while the S&amp;amp;P saw a 35% decline in stock performance between 2007 and 2009 (remember that ride?), the shares of inclusive companies went in the other direction, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/mursalhedayat/2020/06/24/diversity-in-the-workplace-is-now-more-critical-than-ever/?sh=5172eb6e60aa&quot;>;gaining over 14% in value&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;5. &lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Inclusion grows your marketplace.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Inclusive teams are &lt;a href=&quot;/2013/12/how-diversity-can-drive-innovation&quot;>;better at identifying and cultivating new markets&lt;/a>; because they expand a firm&#39;s peripheral vision and help eliminate its blind spots. &lt;a href=&quot;/2004/09/diversity-as-strategy&quot;>;More women in decision-making roles&lt;/a>;, for example, improves a company&#39;s ability to solve problems for female clients. And this is before we even get to the macro implications of &lt;em>;economic &lt;/em>;inclusion. For example, the US GDP could get &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.accenture.com/_acnmedia/pdf-89/accenture-disability-inclusion-research-report.pdf&quot;>;a boost of up to $25 billion&lt;/a>; if just 1% more of persons with disabilities joined the labor force. What percentage of that boost would represent new customers for your business?&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;6. &lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Inclusion makes you more innovative.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Inclusion creates a healthier meritocracy for new ideas &lt;a href=&quot;/2021/04/research-adding-women-to-the-c-suite-changes-how-companies-think&quot;>;where out-of-the-box thinking is more likely to break through&lt;/a>;. This happens in part because people in inclusive organizations are more likely to surface and hear the &lt;em>;what &lt;/em>;of a good idea rather than allow that idea to be diluted or buried by an unexpected &lt;em>;who&lt;/em>;. How much of an innovation bump does true inclusion buy you? Depending on your starting place, estimates range from &lt;a href=&quot;/2018/01/how-and-where-diversity-drives-financial-performance&quot;>;roughly 20%&lt;/a>; all the way &lt;a href=&quot;/2013/12/how-diversity-can-drive-innovation&quot;>;up to 70%&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;7. Inclusion turns you into better decision-makers. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Decision quality goes up when a range of voices are &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/11/why-diverse-teams-are-smarter&quot;>;not only present but also integrated&lt;/a>;. In &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/eriklarson/2017/09/21/new-research-diversity-inclusion-better-decision-making-at-work/?sh=627907124cbf&quot;>;one delightful study&lt;/a>;, all-male teams beat individuals nearly 60% of the time, but gender-diverse teams outperformed individuals almost 75% of the time. Teams that were gender diverse, geographically diverse, and had at least one age gap of more than 20 years made better decisions than that lone individual &lt;em>;87% of the time&lt;/em>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;8. Inclusion helps you manage risk.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;In the wreckage of the 2008 financial crisis, a serious “Lehman Sisters” argument emerged positing that the story would have played out differently if more women had been in the room for the most consequential decisions. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0148296315002143&quot;>;Subsequent&lt;/a>; &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.aom.org/doi/abs/10.5465/amj.2018.1039?journalCode=amj&quot;>;studies&lt;/a>; have since explored this argument, concluding that gender inclusion in the C-suite and boardroom is associated with a healthier firm relationship to risk—neither overly risk-averse nor risk-seeking—and better overall performance.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;9. Inclusion improves your stock price. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Estimated bumps to shareholder returns range &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.catalyst.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/The_Bottom_Line_Connecting_Corporate_Performance_and_Gender_Diversity.pdf&quot;>;from 10% to over 30%&lt;/a>; (seriously) when you get inclusion right. This may be why Goldman Sachs &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/article/bc-finreg-unlocking-diversity-inclusion/unlocking-diversitys-promise-psychological-safety-trust-and-inclusion-idUSKBN2C01N2&quot;>;recently announced&lt;/a>; that it would no longer take any company public where the board is made up exclusively of straight, white men. Whatever your organization&#39;s own return on inclusion may end up being, the question we often ask companies is, “What else are you doing to chase those kinds of returns?”&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;10. Inclusion makes you more money. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;For all the reasons we&#39;ve covered in entries one through nine, inclusion ends up &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/diversity-and-inclusion/diversity-wins-how-inclusion-matters&quot;>;boosting both your top line and bottom line&lt;/a>;. Your talented, engaged teams will drive higher revenues through better innovation and smarter market development, while allowing you to spend capital more efficiently through better decision-making, higher retention, and higher productivity. And when you hit some turbulence along the way, you&#39;re more likely to land the plane safely. We hope to live in a world where inclusion is an organizational given. Until we get there, we know of no other distinction that can deliver these kinds of advantages.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;em>;This excerpt has been lightly edited.&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 10 Oct 2023 21:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[It&rsquo;s Time to End the Battle Between Waterfall and Agile]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/10/its-time-to-end-the-battle-between-waterfall-and-agile]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/10/Oct23_10_501194249.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;MirageC/Getty Images&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;Too many project leaders think rigidly about Waterfall and Agile project management methodologies and believe that they need to choose between the two. But many projects &amp;#8212; especially those with diverse stakeholder needs and complex structures &amp;#8212; benefit from a hybrid approach that combines aspects of Waterfall and Agile. The rise of hybrid methods isn&amp;#8217;t tied to a particular time or event; instead, they have evolved organically as a response to the needs of modern, complex projects. A review of the key components of Waterfall and Agile allows project leaders to select among them to build a hybrid approach based on the unique demands of each project.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/10/its-time-to-end-the-battle-between-waterfall-and-agile?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/10/its-time-to-end-the-battle-between-waterfall-and-agile?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;When you are leading a high-stakes project, choosing between the rigor of Waterfall and the flexibility of Agile can make or break your initiative. For the last two decades, too many academics, leaders, project managers, and organizations have thought they have to choose one or the other. Worse, the emergence of Agile methods led to tribalism in the project community, stifling innovation and limiting the potential for truly effective solutions.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Bring a bunch of project managers together and inevitably they&#39;ll share their thoughts about their least-preferred methodologies. I&#39;ve heard it all: “Waterfall is a process designed for a world that no longer exists.” “Agile is a way of delivering failure faster.” “Waterfall is a dinosaur.” “Agile makes eagles team up with turkeys.” Entire organizations choose to “go agile,” setting aside the fundamentals of traditional methodologies that some projects need. This rigid and divisive thinking leads to real losses.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The key to navigating this landscape lies in &lt;em>;hybrid project management methodologies&lt;/em>; that combine the planning rigor of Waterfall with the flexibility of Agile. Indeed, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pmi.org/learning/library/forging-future-focused-culture-11908#:~:text=The%20survey%20results%20for%20this,of%20their%20projects%20failing%20outright.&quot;>;Project Management Institute&#39;s 2020 report&lt;/a>; indicated that 11.4% of investment is wasted due to poor project performance. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.standishgroup.com/news/45&quot;>;Standish Group&#39;s CHAOS report&lt;/a>; showed only a 31% project success rate, with 19% of projects failing outright. This indicates an estimated annual global financial loss of an astounding $3 trillion, not to mention wasted resources, missed opportunities, and negative societal impacts.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Embracing hybrid methods can help organizations begin to remedy some of these outcomes. In this article we look at how, with this blended approach, organizations can achieve an optimal balance, allowing them to nimbly adapt to unforeseen challenges without losing sight of their ultimate objectives. First, let&#39;s briefly review the core components of Waterfall and Agile, which both contain the building blocks of hybrid methodologies.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Waterfall: The Structured Approach&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;The traditional Waterfall methodology is structured and sequential, where progress “flows” downward through distinct phases: conception, analysis, design, planning, construction, testing, implementation, handover, and maintenance.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Key characteristics of the Waterfall method are highlighted through various examples:&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Sequential phases&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://learninglegacy.crossrail.co.uk/learning-legacy-themes/project-and-programme-management/initiation-and-development/&quot;>;London&#39;s Crossrail project&lt;/a>;, a significant infrastructural undertaking budgeted at £14.8 billion, illustrates the effectiveness of the Waterfall model&#39;s distinct and sequential phases. Each phase had to be meticulously completed before the subsequent one began, ensuring a structured progression that left no room for oversights. Despite the challenges involved, the Crossrail project, upon its completion, was hailed as an engineering marvel, connecting 41 stations over 118 km and forecasted to serve about 200 million people annually.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Detailed documentation&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://everything-everywhere.com/the-large-hadron-collider/&quot;>;Large Hadron Collider&lt;/a>; (LHC) project by CERN, with an estimated cost of €7.5 billion, showcases the importance of the Waterfall model&#39;s emphasis on thorough documentation. Given the LHC&#39;s complexity, including a 17-mile-long circular tunnel and thousands of custom parts, detailed documentation was essential to ensuring everyone involved in the project comprehensively understood each phase.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Predictability&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.arabianbusiness.com/industries/real-estate/burj-dubai-cost-1-5bn-build-27430&quot;>;Burj Khalifa project&lt;/a>; in Dubai, valued at $1.5 billion, stands as a testament to the predictability in cost and timeline offered by the Waterfall method. The meticulous upfront planning facilitated the construction of the world&#39;s tallest building (828 meters), completed within six years as per the original timeline, despite the project&#39;s immense scale and complexity.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, numerous high-profile project failures have exposed the limitations of the Waterfall approach:&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Rigidity&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.audit.vic.gov.au/report/operational-effectiveness-myki-ticketing-system?section=&quot;>;Myki ticketing system&lt;/a>; project in Melbourne, Australia, starkly underscores the Waterfall method&#39;s rigidity. With a budget exceeding AUD 1.5 billion, the project took four times more than the expected two years. Yet, the system was riddled with issues due to its inability to adapt to evolving user requirements and technological advancements.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Late discovery of issues&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;The US government&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessofgovernment.org/sites/default/files/Viewpoints%20Dr%20Gwanhoo%20Lee.pdf&quot;>;HealthCare.gov project&lt;/a>;, which cost over $2 billion, illustrates the repercussions of late-stage testing, a characteristic of the Waterfall model. System defects identified during the late testing phase resulted in a flawed launch and considerable public and political uproar, leading to expensive and time-consuming repairs and improvements.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Incompatibility with change&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-08-31/nbn-cost-revised-up-to-51-billion-dollars/10187108&quot;>;National Broadband Network&lt;/a>; (NBN) project in Australia, an AUD 51 billion endeavor, experienced frequent shifts in strategy and technology, resulting in delays and budget overruns. This highlighted the Waterfall method&#39;s inadequacy in managing projects where requirements are dynamic and continually evolving.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Unsuitability for undefined projects&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;In 2015, Cerner, a health care technology company that provides electronic health records software, began a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.va.gov/oig/pubs/VAOIG-19-08980-95.pdf&quot;>;project&lt;/a>; to develop a new system for the US Department of Veterans Affairs. The project, which was using the Waterfall model and was estimated to cost $16 billion and take 10 years to complete, quickly ran into problems. The VA&#39;s requirements for the new EHR system were not well defined in advance, and the Waterfall model made it difficult for Cerner to change course. By 2018, the project&#39;s cost had &lt;a href=&quot;https://federalnewsnetwork.com/veterans-affairs/2022/07/house-lawmakers-pan-va-ehr-as-bad-investment-with-upcoming-39b-cost-estimate/&quot;>;increased to over $20 billion&lt;/a>; and was still years behind schedule forcing the VA to terminate the project. The Cerner VA EHR project is considered to be one of the most expensive and disastrous IT projects in US government history.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The digital era, characterized by rapid changes and unpredictable environments, has tested the Waterfall method&#39;s limits, recognizing a need for more adaptable project management methodologies.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Agile: The Adaptive Approach&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Agile methods focus on enabling teams to deliver work in small increments, thus delivering value to their customers faster. Because the team continuously evaluates project requirements, plans, and results, it can make changes rapidly.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Key characteristics of Agile, exemplified in various projects, include:&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Iterative development&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;The development of Google&#39;s search engine is a fitting example of iterative development. It started as a research project in 1996 and evolved into the most widely used search engine today, servicing over &lt;a href=&quot;https://fitsmallbusiness.com/google-search-statistics/&quot;>;8.5 billion&lt;/a>; daily searches. The continuous enhancements, adjustments, and improvements made over the years underline the concept of iterative development intrinsic to Agile.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Customer collaboration&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Amazon, a pioneer in customer centricity, epitomizes the Agile principle of customer collaboration. Its constant solicitation and incorporation of customer feedback into its products and services have propelled it to its&amp;nbsp;stratospheric market value.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Response to change&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Spotify, the world-leader in streaming music, is a classic case of Agile&#39;s adaptability. It has consistently evolved its business model and product offerings in response to market changes and user demands, moving from a simple music streaming platform to offering podcasts, videos, and personalized playlists.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the Agile methodology has its share of limitations:&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Inadequate documentation&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;The Agile method&#39;s focus on rapid delivery often leads to insufficient documentation. In 2015, the German supermarket chain Lidl launched a project to implement a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.henricodolfing.com/2020/05/case-study-lidl-sap-debacle.html&quot;>;new SAP system&lt;/a>;. The project failed to accurately map out Lidl&#39;s unique business processes onto the new system. The lack of sufficient documentation led to misunderstandings between the development team and the stakeholders, causing discrepancies in the system&#39;s design and functionality and leading to the project&#39;s cancellation in 2018, incurring a loss of around €500 million.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Unpredictable delivery time and costs&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;The UK&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.computerweekly.com/news/2240185166/Universal-Credit-will-cost-taxpayers-128bn&quot;>;Universal Credit welfare reform project&lt;/a>;, budgeted initially at £2.2 billion, illustrates Agile&#39;s difficulty in estimating delivery times and costs. The project&#39;s costs escalated to over £12 billion, and it&#39;s still not fully implemented nearly a decade later due to its complex nature and continuous changes in requirements.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Dependence on client involvement&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Projects where the client cannot commit significant time or does not provide timely feedback can face significant hurdles. A notable example is the $60 million &lt;a href=&quot;https://federalnewsnetwork.com/tom-temin-commentary/2018/02/the-coast-guards-epic-fail/&quot;>;US Coast Guard payroll system project&lt;/a>;, which was terminated in 2017, partly due to insufficient stakeholder engagement.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Inadequacy for certain types of projects&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Agile&#39;s flexibility and adaptability do not translate well to projects with fixed requirements or requiring high predictability. For instance, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://interestingengineering.com/innovation/engineering-nycs-iconic-structure-one-world-trade-center&quot;>;One World Trade Center construction&lt;/a>;, a project with a budget of approximately $3.9 billion, required strict regulatory compliance and precise planning, which wouldn&#39;t have been feasible with Agile.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As Agile continues to evolve, these limitations underline the need for project management methodologies that can blend the strengths of both Waterfall and Agile, effectively mitigating the weaknesses inherent in each. Thus, the case for a hybrid approach becomes increasingly compelling.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Embracing the Hybrid Approach&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;The emergence of hybrid methodologies represents a new era in project management that draws on the strengths of both Agile and Waterfall while mitigating their limitations. The rise of hybrid methods isn&#39;t tied to a particular time or event; instead, they have evolved organically as a response to the needs of modern, complex projects.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Key characteristics of Hybrid Project Management and their real-world implications include:&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Flexibility and structure&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Hybrid methodologies, such as the one implemented by Philips for their digital transformation initiatives, offer a mix of Agile&#39;s flexibility and Waterfall&#39;s structure. Philips adopted a hybrid approach for its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usa.philips.com/healthcare/innovation/about-health-suite&quot;>;HealthSuite digital platform&lt;/a>;, delivering rapid, iterative releases for software development while still adhering to strict documentation and safety guidelines. By combining these two approaches, Philips was able to create a hybrid approach that was both flexible and structured. This &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.philips.com/c-dam/b2bhc/master/hts/healthsuite/brochure-philips-ealthsuite.pdf&quot;>;resulted&lt;/a>; in better product quality, reduced time to market, predictable costs and savings.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Phased and iterative&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Hybrid methods&amp;nbsp;employ a phased approach for well-defined components and an iterative approach for uncertain ones. On its way to becoming the world&#39;s best digital bank, DBS Bank executed well-planned phases for infrastructure overhaul while implementing iterative development for its customer-facing digital services. This approach enabled them to revamp their legacy systems and simultaneously bring innovative services to market, boosting their revenues from S$9.6 billion in 2014, the year it launched its digital transformation, to S$14.6 billion in 2020.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Customer involvement and predictability&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Hybrid methodologies strike a balance between customer involvement and predictability. British Telecom (BT) uses agile methods for digital services, such as its new &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.globalservices.bt.com/en/solutions/products/5g-private-networks&quot;>;5G network&lt;/a>;, to ensure customer involvement by getting feedback early and often. This helps to ensure that the final product meets the needs of customers.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.globalservices.bt.com/en/aboutus/unlocking-the-future-of-infrastructure?cid=ppc_(sc)google(cam)infrastructure(md)ppcad(id)infrastructure&amp;amp;gad=1&amp;amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwl8anBhCFARIsAKbbpyQVcAlVAgU3VYlwMUe8G6mZK1tx6wYwFKM4fOpPHtwxVSEYN9tReLEaAoBeEALw_wcB&amp;amp;gclsrc=aw.ds&quot;>;infrastructure projects&lt;/a>;, such as its new data centers, BT uses Waterfall methods to plan and execute projects more predictably. This helps to ensure that projects are completed on time and within budget. The hybrid approach ensures customer involvement and offers predictable delivery timelines, helping BT achieve an annual revenue of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statista.com/statistics/290320/bt-group-adjusted-revenues/&quot;>;£21.37 billion in 2021&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Benefits of Hybrid Project Management and its related examples include:&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Balanced approach&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Hybrid methodologies offer the best of both worlds, as shown by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/company/how-we-make-games/technology&quot;>;Ubisoft&lt;/a>;. The video game developer used Waterfall to plan and develop assets like characters and initial coding to ensure that the base game would be robust and well-constructed. They switched to Agile when it came to gameplay mechanics, debugging, and post-launch updates. By applying a hybrid approach, Ubisoft successfully launched &lt;em>;Assassin&#39;s Creed Valhalla&lt;/em>; to commercial acclaim in November 2020.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Risk mitigation&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;A hybrid approach allows for risk mitigation by blending Agile&#39;s adaptability with Waterfall&#39;s structured planning, as demonstrated by Tesla&#39;s hybrid approach to the development of their Model 3. To build the Gigafactory, where the vehicle&#39;s batteries are produced, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tesla.com/sites/default/files/blog_attachments/gigafactory.pdf&quot;>;Tesla utilized rigorous planning and risk assessment methods&lt;/a>;. At the same time, Tesla&#39;s capability to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-software-updates-allow-quick-fixes-taking-risks-2022-02-18/&quot;>;update vehicle software over the air&lt;/a>; allows for rapid issue resolution and feature addition post-production. This dual strategy enables Tesla to mitigate risks effectively while maintaining flexibility in a high-stakes manufacturing landscape.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Efficient use of resources&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Hybrid approaches offer the stability of resource-intensive, long-term planning while providing the flexibility to adapt rapidly to market demands. For example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://quickbooks.intuit.com/r/supply-chain/zara-supply-chain-its-secret-to-retail-success/&quot;>;​Zara&#39;s&lt;/a>; detailed planning and staggered development phases ensure that there is minimal resource idling.​ On the other hand,​ cross-functional teams consisting of designers, marketers, and store managers engage in iterative cycles and sprints. These quick feedback loops allow ​Zara to allocate or reallocate resources immediately based on real-time sales data and new fashion trends.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;When Hybrid Methods Work Best&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Recognizing when to use a hybrid method is pivotal to a project&#39;s success. The approach offers adaptability without sacrificing the vision and detailed planning that many projects require, making it an invaluable approach that every organization should develop. So, how can you determine whether your project would benefit from a hybrid approach? Here are some indicators:&lt;/p>; &lt;ol>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Diverse stakeholder needs:&lt;/strong>; When you&#39;re dealing with a broad range of stakeholders, each with their own requirements and expectations, a hybrid approach can cater to all. It can allow for iterative feedback, like in Agile, while maintaining a structured roadmap, as in Waterfall.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Varied project phases:&lt;/strong>; A hybrid method can offer the best of both worlds if different stages of your project require different approaches — such as an initial research phase requiring strict structure, followed by a development phase needing more flexibility.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Uncertain requirements:&lt;/strong>; For projects where requirements may change or need to be fully clear at the outset, but there&#39;s a need for a definite structure or end goal, a hybrid approach can accommodate evolving needs without losing sight of the final objective.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Risk management:&lt;/strong>; If your project encounters high levels of uncertainty or risk that require iterative testing and review but also require thorough documentation and planning, a hybrid method can strike the right balance between adaptability and meticulousness.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Complex project structures:&lt;/strong>; For projects characterized by intricate interdependencies, multifaceted components, or multifunctional teams, a hybrid method can cater to the nuanced demands, balancing rigorous planning with nimble execution.&lt;/li>; &lt;/ol>; &lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;. 。 .&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;It&#39;s time to end the destructive battle between Waterfall and Agile. The key to unlocking the true potential of projects lies in bringing a diverse set of tools to every initiative — an assortment of approaches, methods, and techniques that can be adapted and applied per each project&#39;s unique demands.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hybrid project management methodologies present a promising step in this direction, embracing the strengths of both Waterfall and Agile while offsetting their weaknesses. By having hybrid methods as a tool in our toolbox, we equip ourselves to increase the success rate of projects, deliver more value for our organizations, and navigate the complexities of the &lt;a href=&quot;/2021/11/the-project-economy-has-arrived&quot;>;project economy&lt;/a>; more effectively.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 10 Oct 2023 20:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Transform Business Operations with Process Mining]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/10/transform-business-operations-with-process-mining]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/09/Sept23_28_596456570.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;Bernd Vogel/Getty Images&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;The most effective companies we interviewed use process mining to generate operational insights at scale, identify process inefficiencies, define targeted actions, and measure process improvements &amp;#8212; all of which lead to value realization. It is often a major cultural change to fully embrace this level of process management. Leaders describe a cultural journey from a hero-focused company to a process-focused company. The goal is to establish efficient processes with consistent, smooth execution rather than relying upon local heroes to save the day.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/10/transform-business-operations-with-process-mining?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/10/transform-business-operations-with-process-mining?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;Process mining has evolved from an academic concept (first &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vdaalst.com/publications/p128.pdf&quot;>;published&lt;/a>; in 2001) to a&amp;nbsp;popular software tool for analyzing, monitoring, and improving process performance. As we have described in a &lt;a href=&quot;/2019/04/what-process-mining-is-and-why-companies-should-do-it&quot;>;previous article&lt;/a>; and a &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-40172-6&quot;>;book&lt;/a>;, process mining analyzes logs of&amp;nbsp;enterprise transactional system events to create a detailed picture of the processes, thus providing a digital twin of actual process flows. It is quickly replacing previous observational and subjective approaches to understanding business processes.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Process mining began as a tool used to investigate process performance issues on an ad hoc basis, but has evolved into a platform for monitoring and improving operational process execution at scale to drive process efficiency and help realize business value. As an indisputable, fact-based visualization of de-facto process flows, it provides a unique source of truth to scale operational transformation.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Our research has focused on the business context and critical success factors behind the success of process mining in large organizations. We interviewed process mining leaders in eleven companies. One of us (Lars) has observed many other efforts to scale process mining using Celonis, a leading provider of the technology, in the course of his customer advisory role. There are now many vendors of process mining software, including established firms like Microsoft and SAP, and we have also interviewed customers of other vendors in this research.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;The Context for Employing Process Mining&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;We found two alternative contexts in which companies were applying process mining to their businesses and scaling it over time. One involves companies that have broadly adopted a process orientation across their businesses; the other context is within firms that are attempting to become more process-focused, but have not yet fully done so. Process orientation became somewhat popular with process improvement and reengineering efforts over the last several decades, but many companies have not fully institutionalized a process view of their businesses. Process-oriented firms have clearly-defined end-to-end processes like order-to-cash and procure-to-pay, owners of those processes, and clear goals and performance metrics for them.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Those companies we interviewed with an established process orientation — primarily companies in central Europe — were using process mining to go beyond traditional business process modeling toward mining and improving the actual execution of process-based operations. They use it for generating operational insights at scale, identifying process inefficiencies, defining targeted actions and measuring process improvements — all leading ultimately to value realization.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Companies without a strong process orientation were using process mining to further inculcate the idea of end-to-end processes, motivate better process execution, and to push for less variation and complexity in process flows across the business. Both groups found the technology useful, although process mining leaders in companies without a strong process orientation had to spend more time evangelizing for the technology and recruiting business sponsorship. It is often a major cultural change to fully embrace process management, as evidenced by a large global shipping and logistics company we interviewed. Its process leaders described a cultural journey from a hero-focused company to a process company. The goal is to establish efficient processes with consistent, smooth process execution rather than relying upon local heroes to save the day.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Critical Success Factors for Scaling&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;There are a variety of possible factors that might drive success in scaling process mining initiatives. Some that we have identified include:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;Executive buy-in to the idea of process mining and continuous support&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Business ownership to drive projects within their domains&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Creating a center of excellence (CoE) — a dedicated team to accelerating process mining&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Change management, training, and community development of users&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Connecting process mining to strategic objectives and internal programs&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;An emphasis on business value realization (value-first) from process mining&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Real-time integration and data access, with connection to feeder systems&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Operational process execution efforts embedded into ongoing management.&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;When we discussed these factors with the process mining leaders we interviewed, we asked which ones were most important in their own organizations. The most common response was executive buy-in — recruiting executives sponsors in the first place, securing their ongoing support, and driving adoption of new projects throughout the organization. At the consumer products company Reckitt, the process mining program has been supported right from the start by the CEO, CFO, and CIDO. They not only sponsor the program, but connect it to strategic priorities and managing transformation through measurable KPIs.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Business ownership is a lower-level version of executive buy-in that was also mentioned&amp;nbsp;by several process mining leaders. Business stakeholders or process owners need to&amp;nbsp;understand and support the idea of mining, analyzing, and acting on process&amp;nbsp;performance data, or it will not happen at all or become established into daily practice.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At PepsiCo, business stakeholders view process mining as a key enabler on a mission to create a totally different company, as part of their digital transformation strategy. Merck has a well-defined process for engaging with new business areas with the goal of building ownership. It includes presentation of existing Merck examples as references and discussion of pain points, important pockets of resources, and improvement potentials for that business area.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Several process leaders also mentioned the importance of a strong emphasis on value. Process mining has costs — eg for software and organizational support — and it is important in most companies to ensure that the value derived from it is calculated, validated and realized.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Business value focus implies that the most valuable projects are prioritized, leading to a positive business case. At the healthcare company Cardinal Health, for example, there are stated goals for value from process mining each year. The process mining team reports true actual values for each project each month, and the finance organization and the business stakeholder must agree to them. Already in the second year, process mining efforts at Cardinal Health over-delivered on value goals by 2.5X.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some process mining leaders — who generally head CoEs for the technology — acknowledged that such centers are critical to accelerate adoption. However, they would not be established in the first place without some degree of executive buy-in and a competent team. The candy and pet food giant Mars mentioned that its primary success factor was finding the right talent for process mining — people who are capable of connecting both technology and the business domain. The individuals need to be able to code, build data models, consult, understand requirements, deploy, and support improvement of processes. Not surprisingly, they are difficult to find.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To make process mining a strong driver for operational transformation, it always comes back to people. Change management is a key factor at a pharmaceutical giant in Europe. It has a dedicated process mining community program including bi-weekly all hands calls, internal training sessions for personal development, showcasing best practice success stories, and continuous community activities.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;From Insights to Action&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;The process mining leaders we interviewed agreed that it is important to move beyond insights on how processes are performing — the original intent of process mining — to actions for sustainable improvements.&amp;nbsp;From a software perspective, moving from insights to action involves targeted apps and problem areas for particular types of processes, such as preserving cash in accounts&amp;nbsp;payable or improving cash flow in accounts receivable (both popular in recessionary&amp;nbsp;economies), improving supplier reliability in procurement and building supply chain&amp;nbsp;resilience, or optimizing inventory levels. Many companies also focus on identifying and&amp;nbsp;speeding up slow or low-quality deliveries in order management processes.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From a management perspective, the companies we interviewed took various steps in order to translate insights into action. At the Nordic and Baltic telecom company, Telia Company, a combination of factors helped drive action. Its CoE focused on finding the right part of the business that was curious about process mining and open to trying it.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In many cases, the Telia Chief Operations Officer opened the doors for them.&amp;nbsp;The center staff also worked to identify the right people in that business area to work with them and get them engaged in data-driven process improvement. They consulted with the&amp;nbsp;internal client to identify a process problem they wanted to solve. The ultimate goal was&amp;nbsp;to use the insights from process mining operationally and to drive value on a daily basis.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;The Future of Process Mining&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;In addition to asking process mining leaders what made their organizations successful (and what was less helpful in that regard), we also asked about their future plans for process mining and operational transformation. Some of the companies were focused on using technological innovations; others on fleshing out the organizational infrastructure for process mining.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the technology front, Mars is focused on determining how advances in automated analytics can make process mining easier to use and scalable across the organization. The goal is to enable a seamless generation of tailored insights and recommendations that drive business value. In a similar vein, several parties want AI to help users identify big improvement levers and support better process execution. BMW is focused on making process mining accessible to almost everyone in the organization, and is currently engaged in training 80,000 employees on digital skills that would enable process mining and other user-initiated activities. Cardinal Health wants to add a focus on task mining and execution management technologies to its basic process mining software. Merck is working on object-centric process mining to achieve a 3D perspective on processes and facilitate cross-silo improvements with a digital process twin.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In terms of organizational development of process mining, several organizations, including the filter manufacturer MANN+HUMMEL, wanted to expand both a user community for process mining as well as a process management organization that can help with improving processes. Ingka (an IKEA retailer) similarly wants to build a community of process mining practitioners and champions. Its process mining leaders envision that the global furniture retailer will eventually enable each country to have its own process mining sandbox to experiment with, and a federated set of process mining CoEs around the globe. Mars wants to establish a federated network of superusers, while Telia aims at enabling citizen developers for process automation. Cardinal Health, which works with a network of pharmaceutical and medical device companies, wants to extend process mining to optimize processes interorganizationally.&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;These companies provide evidence that process mining is a technology that is here to&amp;nbsp;stay. Multiple vendors now offer it, big companies are building technical and&amp;nbsp;organizational infrastructures to support it, and many companies are getting substantial&amp;nbsp;value from it. Insights are being turned into action, ultimately delivering value in respect&amp;nbsp;to the top, bottom and green line of organizations.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 09 Oct 2023 21:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[5 Ways to Develop Talent for an Unpredictable Future]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/10/5-ways-to-develop-talent-for-an-unpredictable-future]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/10/Oct23_09_1582805042.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;designer491/Getty Images&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;We may not know what tomorrow&amp;#8217;s jobs will look like, but we can safely assume that when people are more curious, emotionally intelligent, resilient, driven, and intelligent, they will generally be better equipped to learn what is needed to perform those jobs, and provide whatever human value technology cannot replace. Rather than betting on specialists or forcing people into specific niches, organizations need to focus on expanding people&amp;#8217;s talents. What we need is not just re-skilling or up-skilling, but &lt;em>;pre&lt;/em>;-skilling: that is, being able to future-proof&amp;#160;talent and reinvent peoples&amp;#8217; careers before we even know what tomorrow&amp;#8217;s jobs and in-demand skills will be. This article makes five broad recommendations for preparing your workforce for an uncertain future.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/10/5-ways-to-develop-talent-for-an-unpredictable-future?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/10/5-ways-to-develop-talent-for-an-unpredictable-future?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;Despite the many clickbaity headlines and apocalyptic fearmongering around AI and job automation, the data are rather clear: As I highlight in my latest book, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Human-Automation-Quest-Reclaim-Unique-ebook/dp/B099KQV3ZJ&quot;>;&lt;em>;I, Human: AI, Automation, and the Quest to Reclaim What Makes Us Unique&lt;/em>;&lt;/a>;&lt;em>;, &lt;/em>;you are less likely to lose your job to AI than to &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/05/3-human-super-talents-ai-will-not-replace&quot;>;another human&lt;/a>; using AI, especially if you don&#39;t use AI yourself. In that sense, there&#39;s nothing new about the AI age; just like previous disruptive technologies, AI is eliminating some jobs but creating many more new jobs in turn, which desperately require humans.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As illustrated in our recent ManpowerGroup report, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.manpowergroup.com/en/news-releases/news/58-of-employers-believe-artificial-intelligence-and-virtual-reality-will-be-job-creators&quot;>;58% of employers&lt;/a>; see AI as a net creator of new jobs. The problem is that people who are displaced by job automation (for example, brick-and-mortar store managers) don&#39;t automatically have access to all the new jobs that are created by technology (for example, cybersecurity analyst, digital marketer, or AI ethicist). According to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10796-022-10308-y&quot;>;World Economic Forum&lt;/a>;, half of employees will need reskilling by 2025 to keep up with new technologies, and this figure predates the current generative AI boom.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As Stanford&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNX_6gzLIvI&quot;>;Erik Brynjolfsson&lt;/a>; estimates, for every dollar organizations spend on technology, they need to invest an additional nine dollars in talent and related processes, such as identifying people with the right skillsets and potential; developing the right skills; enabling proper change-management processes; and creating the conditions for people to &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/07/when-your-employee-isnt-reaching-their-full-potential&quot;>;live up to their potential&lt;/a>;. Indeed, as my colleague Becky Frankiewicz and I &lt;a href=&quot;/2020/05/digital-transformation-is-about-talent-not-technology&quot;>;noted&lt;/a>;, what makes or breaks digital transformation is not the actual technology, but the human factor: talent.&lt;/p>; &lt;article-promo>; &lt;hbr-component type=&quot;promo&quot; is-insight=&quot;insight-center&quot; title=&quot;The Future of Work&quot; dek=&quot;Will your company adapt or be left behind?&quot; cta-text=&quot;&quot; href=&quot;/insight-center/the-future-of-work&quot;>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/insight-center/the-future-of-work&quot; style=&quot;color:black;text-decoration:none&quot;>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; Insight Center Collection &lt;/div>; &lt;h3>;The Future of Work&lt;/h3>; &lt;div>; Will your company adapt or be left behind? &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hbr-component>; &lt;/article-promo>; &lt;p>;So, what we need is not just re-skilling or up-skilling, but &lt;em>;pre&lt;/em>;-skilling — that is, being able to future-proof talent and reinvent peoples&#39; careers before we even know what tomorrow&#39;s jobs and in-demand skills will be.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Pre-Skilling Your Workforce for an Unknown Future&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;How can this be done? Although nobody has the exact recipe, not least because there&#39;s no data on the future, we can extrapolate from macro historical trends, as well as draw lessons from recent economic and human capital patterns, to make five broad recommendations:&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;1) Focus on potential&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;As the lifespan of current skills, expertise, and performance shrinks, it is advisable to hire and promote people for what &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.myhrfuture.com/digital-hr-leaders-podcast/how-ai-can-unlock-human-potential-and-make-work-more-meaningful&quot;>;they &lt;em>;could&lt;/em>; do&lt;/a>;, rather than what they &lt;em>;have done &lt;/em>;in the past. This means prioritizing soft skills — such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.learnabilityquotient.com/&quot;>;learning ability&lt;/a>;, &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/12/assessment-whats-your-curiosity-profile&quot;>;curiosity&lt;/a>;, resilience, and adaptability — over hard skills — such as programming or data mining — focusing on the foundational &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/iops.12001&quot;>;ingredients of employability&lt;/a>; rather than current technical expertise or past employment history, both of which still dominate modern hiring approaches.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Simply put, we may not know what tomorrow&#39;s jobs will look like, but we can safely assume that when people are more curious, emotionally intelligent, resilient, driven, and intelligent, they will generally be better equipped to learn what is needed to perform those jobs and provide whatever human value technology cannot replace. One advantage with potential is that we have reliable and proven methods to measure it, notably &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Talent-Delusion-Intuition-Unlocking-Potential/dp/0349412480&quot;>;psychological assessment tools&lt;/a>;, which can also be used to &lt;em>;develop&lt;/em>; people&#39;s potential, particularly through normative and &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2019-21619-003&quot;>;data-driven feedback&lt;/a>; that helps them identify gaps between where they are and where they need to be (see next point).&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;2) Provide crucial feedback&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Even before AI&#39;s arrival, there was already a great deal of confusion and misunderstanding around aligning people&#39;s talents and potential with the best career choices. Things are even more complex now, and most employees (and managers) are rightly wondering what they will do in the future, whether their experience and expertise — and all the time and money they invested in their careers — will still be relevant, and if so, where.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sharing data-driven feedback (from assessments, internal data, and peer-ratings) and helping people understand how their interests and skills can be a future asset to your organization is key. This means thinking of &lt;a href=&quot;/2019/11/the-leader-as-coach&quot;>;leaders as coaches or talent agents&lt;/a>;, where their main job is to proactively nurture people&#39;s talents, as well as harness their full potential. Remember: Most people are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Fair-Talk-Three-Powerful-Feedback/dp/1912555093&quot;>;feedback-deprived&lt;/a>;, and a staggering &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1996-02773-003&quot;>;two-thirds of feedback interventions&lt;/a>; fail to produce desirable results. The key is to tell people what they &lt;em>;need&lt;/em>; to hear even when they don&#39;t &lt;em>;want&lt;/em>; to hear it, and above all, that you tell them something they didn&#39;t know and that can motivate them to get better.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Crucially, it is not enough just to provide people with feedback on their skills gaps; organizations also need to incentivize them to develop the relevant skills while providing the most efficient, enticing, and impactful programs to develop them.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;3) Focus on talent expansion&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Rather than betting on specialists or forcing people into specific niches, focus on broadening or expanding people&#39;s talents. This means &lt;em>;not&lt;/em>; playing to &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/01/strengths-based-coaching-can-actually-weaken-you&quot;>;people&#39;s strengths&lt;/a>;, but rather, helping them develop &lt;em>;new&lt;/em>; strengths, so they become a more versatile version of themselves.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We all have a natural tendency to adapt the world to our current skills so that we can do “more with less” and optimize for lazy efficiency rather than stretch goals or new skills acquisition. In reality, unless your employees are in the top 1% of any area of expertise (which, by definition, can only apply to a very small selection of individuals), they will be better served becoming a jack of all trades, not least because with every new task or skill you learn, there will be many new underlying skills with adjacencies to other tasks, jobs, and careers.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This will also increase diversity and inclusion. As Harvard&#39;s Joseph Fuller and Christina Langer and Burning Glass Institute&#39;s Matt Sigelman &lt;a href=&quot;/2022/02/skills-based-hiring-is-on-the-rise&quot;>;point out&lt;/a>;: “The shift to skills-based hiring will open opportunities to a large population of potential employees who in recent years have often been excluded from consideration because of degree inflation.” If organizations complain about their inability to find diverse and creative talent, they should stop looking for talent in the same old places and ways.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;4) Invest in mid-level managers&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;As &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/07/3-ways-to-reenergize-your-team-when-morale-is-low&quot;>;Amy Edmondson and I&lt;/a>; recently noted, managers hold the key to unlocking human potential at work, especially when the challenge is to revitalize, reenergize, and reimagine talent. Even before the AI age, the role of middle managers was critical and accounted for &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1037/1089-2680.9.2.169&quot;>;30 to 40% of team performance&lt;/a>;, but the role has increased massively in complexity.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Historically, a manager was someone with proven technical expertise and strong past performance as an individual contributor. Today, they need to understand not just the “classic” managerial tasks (hire the right people, give them the right tasks and direction, use feedback to motivate them, and enable team performance), but also some very complex specific new challenges, such as &lt;a href=&quot;/2020/10/how-to-manage-a-hybrid-team&quot;>;managing hybrid&lt;/a>; and virtual teams, &lt;a href=&quot;/2022/12/a-guide-to-building-psychological-safety-on-your-team&quot;>;creating psychological safety&lt;/a>;, &lt;a href=&quot;/2021/05/5-strategies-to-infuse-di-into-your-organization&quot;>;boosting DEIB&lt;/a>; (which includes hiring and motivating people who are different from themselves), and helping people &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/06/what-will-working-with-ai-really-require&quot;>;manage the human-AI age&lt;/a>;, including all the uncertainties and stress that evokes.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In short, there has never been a better &lt;a href=&quot;https://qz.com/the-case-for-investing-a-lot-more-in-middle-managers-in-1850548862&quot;>;time to invest&lt;/a>; in mid-level managers, especially harnessing the critical soft skills that will likely future-proof them by enabling them to keep up with technological advancements and drive the value realization their organizations expect from new innovations.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;5) Invest in leadership skills&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;If you are worried about an AI-fueled future but still think humans will be part of the picture, then you should be worried about pre-skilling your leaders, for they will (still) be tasked with setting and selling the company&#39;s strategy, and driving the evolution of its culture, in tomorrow&#39;s uncertain time. In part, this is still about promoting individuals with the right soft skills (as per Step 1) and developing those skills. It is also about &lt;a href=&quot;/2019/08/hire-leaders-for-what-they-can-do-not-what-they-have-done&quot;>;moving on&lt;/a>; and understanding that today&#39;s top leaders may be a poor fit for the future, not least because their success is based on replicating what has worked in the past, which is often an obstacle to changing or learning new things.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Importantly, investing in leadership means harnessing the skills that enable people to collaborate effectively and become a high-performing team. It is not about promoting individuals to senior positions or glorifying status, let alone about the popularity contest that often underpins &lt;a href=&quot;/2017/10/what-science-says-about-identifying-high-potential-employees&quot;>;“high-potential” nominations&lt;/a>; — rather, it is about the qualities people must have to inspire, motivate, and bring others along into a future that will surely include AI, but should ideally also be defined as the human-AI age. This is the critical leadership challenge of today. If organizations can upgrade their leadership-selection systems, shifting from replicating past success profiles to selecting and nurturing for future skills, all other challenges will become easier. In particular, this means de-emphasizing things like “culture fit,” past performance, and technical expertise to focus more on learning ability, curiosity, integrity, and people skills. More importantly, if organizations are truly interested in harnessing diversity, they must prioritize &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/what-makes-an-inclusive-leader&quot;>;inclusive&lt;/a>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/key-attributes-inclusive-leader-professor-business-psychology?r=US&amp;amp;IR=T&quot;>; leadership&lt;/a>;&amp;nbsp;and cognitive diversity, breaking the homogeneity in leadership profiles.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;. 。 .&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Technology is always changing, but to ensure that those changes are actually an evolution (ie, contributing to progress), we must make every possible effort to enable humans to develop and deploy the relevant talents to reap the potential benefits of technology. Although this is by no means a given, we should have faith and confidence in our species&#39; ability to continue to adapt to its own technological inventions.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 09 Oct 2023 20:25:02 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
