&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt; /div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/10/operations-in-an-era-of-radical-uncertainty?language=es&quot;>;阅读西班牙语&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot; /2023/10/operations-in-an-era-era-of-radical-uncertainty?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;运营对于实现目标始终至关重要。竞争优势。蒂姆·库克，他有&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2021/08/25/tim-cooks-decade-at-apple-makes-him-the-most-successful- successor-ceo-ever&quot;>;比任何其他公司的任何其他首席执行官创造了更多的股东价值&lt;/a>;，是一位运营专家。事实上，他认为 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/07/apple-ceo-tim-cook-steve-jobs-expected-innovation-from-everyone.html&quot;>;即使在富有远见的史蒂夫·乔布斯掌舵公司时，运营创新对于苹果的成功也至关重要。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但是&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bcg.com」的本质/publications/2023/why-ambidexterity-in-business-needs-to-evolve&quot;>;竞争优势随着时间的推移而变化&lt;/a>;——运营在其中扮演的角色也在变化。从历史上看，运营的主要战略价值是创造规模，以便通过&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bcg.com/publications/2013&quot;获得自我强化的&lt;em>;效率&lt;/em>;优势/growth-business-unit-strategy-experience-curve-bcg-classics-revisited&quot;>;经验曲线&lt;/a>;。随着数字革命，静态的物理规模失去了优势：通过构建或利用连接供应商和消费者的数字平台和生态系统，即使是小型初创企业也能够获得主导地位和高利润。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt; strong>;弹性：当今的运营优势&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;新的优势来源变成了灵活性，&lt;/em>;根据不断变化的技术和竞争条件调整业务模式的能力。灵活性有不同的模式：这可能意味着能够在新机会出现时快速扩展解决方案。这可能意味着能够抵御意外的冲击。事实证明，在新冠疫情期间，韧性是&lt;a href=&quot;/2022/03/make-resilience-your-companys-strategic-advantage&quot;>;优势的关键来源&lt;/a>;，各公司之间的业绩差异就证明了这一点。有些人从未恢复到冲击前的表现水平，另一些人能够恢复，但后来失去了暂时的优势，而很少有人成为结构性赢家，能够在冲击后的环境中可持续发展。&lt;/p>; &lt;div>; &lt;图>; &lt;img aria-scribedby=&quot;caption-attachment-364565&quot; src=&quot;/resources/images/article_assets/2023/09/W230907_REEVES_COVID_WINNERS_360.png&quot; >; &quot; title=&quot;许多疫情时代的高绩效公司已经失去了优势.&quot;

&lt;/div>; &lt;p>;Covid 不仅强调了复原力的价值，还揭示了这项工作需要在运营团队和更广泛的组织内部完成，将其从危机期间应用的一套直观方法转变为一种长期的、系统的和可重复的能力。在大流行之后，我们发现自己处于多重危机的世界中，磨练和系统化弹性能力将至关重要。为此，领导者必须：&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;&lt;strong>;1.采取正确的心态。&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;效率继续主导财务管理心态，尤其是在投资者对短期盈利能力的需求随着利率上升而上升的情况下。对复原力的投资可能看起来效率低下，并且即时回报有限，导致管理者低估它们。&lt;/p>; &lt;article-promo>; &lt;hbr-component type=&quot;promo&quot; is-insight=&quot;insight-center&quot; title=&quot;新运营时代&quot; dek=&quot;提高效率并增强弹性。&quot; cta-text=&quot;&quot; href=&quot;/insight-center/the-new-age-of-operations&quot;>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/insight-center/the-new-age-of-operations&quot; style= &quot;color:black;text-decoration:none&quot;>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; 洞察中心集合 &lt;/div>; &lt;h3>;运营新时代&lt;/h3>; &lt;div>; 提高效率并增强弹性。 &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hbr-component>; &lt;/article-promo>; &lt;p>;但是，&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bcg.com/publications/ 2020/how-to-become-an-all-weather-resiliient-company&quot;>;实证分析&lt;/a>;表明，韧性推动股东价值：在 25 年的时间范围内，公司股东总回报 (TSR) 的 30%是在危机时期累积的——尽管这些时期只占调查期间的 11%。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;通过让公司将危机视为竞争机会，而不是暂时抵御冲击，韧性可以推动长期卓越表现。领导者需要将韧性视为一种战略能力，可以通过磨练实验能力、选择和扩大新兴模型以及利用&lt;a href=&quot;/2020/04/we-need-imagination-现在比以往任何时候都更具有“想象力”的力量&lt;/a>;来主动重塑公司并重塑其环境。&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;&lt;strong>;2.采取整体方法。&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;&lt;a href=&quot;/2022/03/make-resilience-your-companys-strategic-advantage&quot;>;建立复原力&lt;/a>;包括在以下方面采取行动：运营层面，例如，通过创建预警系统或建立多个冗余的制造设施或供应渠道。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但是，还需要考虑运营之外的弹性 - 它是整个系统的属性，而不是部分的属性系统——企业需要采取更广泛的方法。还需要在公司之外采取措施：通过将其目标和活动与更广泛的商业生态系统和社会保持一致，公司可以加强与在危机中可以信赖的利益相关者的关系。&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;&lt;strong>;3.将危机中的经验教训制度化。&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;虽然许多领导者渴望在危机过去后继续前进，但他们应该花时间将他们所学到的知识制度化。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;对于为此，我们提出了&lt;a href=&quot;/2023/03/has-your-organization-acted-on-what-its-learned-in-the-pandemic?ab=hero-main-text&quot;>;三步走方法&lt;/a>;，这需要评估您的表现（与您的同行相比以及随着时间的推移）；吸取教训（例如，缺少哪些能力，哪些决策是正确或错误的）；并实施必要的改进（例如，编写危机手册、创建更灵活的协作结构）。正如一位首席执行官所说：“我们不能依靠少数人的主动性和激增能力来创造可持续的恢复能力。”&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;&lt;strong>;4。采用弹性测量。&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;弹性的好处很难用传统的业务指标来衡量，这会导致领导者做出过度重视短期效率的决策。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; -以长期价值创造为导向，企业需要&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bcg.com/publications/2020/benefits-of-corporate-vitality&quot;>;引入新的指标&lt;/a>;来衡量并激励灵活性和响应能力。这包括可以追溯量化的战略措施，例如复苏率（公司相对于竞争对手恢复到危机前绩效水平的速度）或公司在行业或经济的冲击后上升中所占的份额。&lt; /p>; &lt;p>;同样重要的是运营措施，它可以帮助公司评估他们对下一次冲击的准备情况：例如，分析资本或产能的灵活性（可以重新分配多少资金以及多快）或运营动员的敏捷性（例如，备份系统或设施的启动速度）。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;通过将弹性系统化和制度化，企业将能够抵御特定的、低概率的、高影响的事件，并通过利用灵活性跳转到新的体验曲线，在变化的环境中蓬勃发展。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但这并不是运营的最终前沿。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt; strong>;选择性：运营优势的下一个前沿&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;我们现在正在进入一个充满不确定性的时代，多种危机在不同规模和时间范围内同时展开。因此，企业必须做好准备，以适应世界上各种可能出现的未来状况 — — 并且考虑到最近资本成本的上升，它们必须能够有效地做到这一点。换句话说，他们必须灵活地将效率和灵活性考虑结合起来，才能在这个新时代蓬勃发展。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;要在这种背景下取得成功，运营必须启用并创建&lt;a href=&quot;/2023/05/radical- optionity&quot;>;激进的可选性&lt;/a>;：有效构建&lt;a href=&quot;/2023/05/why-conflicting-ideas-can-make-your-strategy-stronger&quot;>;选项组合&lt;/a>;的能力— 每一项都可能成为未来竞争优势的基础 — 并在未来显现时重新调整和重新衡量它们。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;企业如何征服下一个运营前沿？&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;&lt;strong >;1.扩大客户互动和洞察。&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;为了更有效地创造新选择，公司需要更好的方法来利用客户信息。每次客户交互都是独特的，并且必须以能够捕获和分析其中的信息并将吸取的经验教训反馈到公司的探索过程中的方式来设置操作。这方面的一个例子是用于记录、分析、解析和编码客户呼叫的数字工具。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;公司不仅可以从客户的行为（即他们购买的商品）中了解情况，还可以从他们的搜索中了解情况活动（即他们想买什么（其他））。 Datadog 是一家基于云的监控和分析平台提供商，成功地使用了这种方法：遵循开源模型，该公司 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/community/interview-brett -langdon-node-dogapi/&quot;>;欢迎来自其用户社区的代码贡献&lt;/a>;，这些代码向 Datadog 告知其客户需要解决的问题类型，从而激励其开发工作。&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;&lt;strong>; 2.通过客户搜索获利。&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;客户不仅会消费，还会进行探索。通过与客户的搜索流程互动，公司还可以塑造他们的旅程，向客户展示更多的产品。大多数电子商务平台都是通过推荐来做到这一点 - 想想“搭配”或“其他买家喜欢”的标签。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;另一个强大的方法是通过客户的探索之旅本身获利：例如，Spotify 意识到音乐流媒体服务的价值主张不仅是能够立即访问用户已经知道他们想听的歌曲，而且还能够发现他们可能喜欢的新艺术家和专辑。它的&lt;a href=&quot;https://engineering.atspotify.com/2015/11/what-made-discover-weekly-one-of-our-most-successful-feature-launches-to-date/&quot;>;“发现“每周”&lt;/a>; 功能是一种个性化播放列表，它使用从数百万用户探索 Spotify 目录时收集的数据来预测个人可能会感兴趣的歌曲。对于 Spotify 来说，这创造了独特且可货币化的竞争优势，比其音乐目录的广度或其应用程序的可靠性和音质更难以模仿。&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;&lt;strong>;3.个性化产品。&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;通过利用客户行为和搜索过程中的信息，公司可以更好地满足特定客户的个人需求。例如，&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-04-12/indochino-hacked-suiting-now-can-it-do-the-same-for-retail&quot; >;Indochino&lt;/a>; 更新了数字时代的定制西装业务。网上商店允许用户设计西装和衬衫，选择适合自己尺寸的剪裁和面料。通过这种模式，用户可以获得广泛的产品选择，但 Indochino 不必预先投资于无法销售的设计，这意味着它可以有效地扩展可选性。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;迈出定制化的一步此外，像 Roblox 这样的公司还为其平台用户提供&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/10/technology/roblox-stock-price.html&quot;>;构建产品的工具&lt;/a >; 他们渴望自己。该平台不是猜测哪些体验最吸引人，而是专注于最大限度地提高用户的开发便利性，以便他们能够实现自己的梦想创作，并激发他人的创作灵感（并受到他人的启发）。这种良性循环帮助 Roblox 达到了巨大的规模：2020 年，&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/16/how-roblox-kids-video-game-platform-b​​ecame-worth-近300亿.html&quot;>;超过一半的美国16岁以下儿童&lt;/a>;曾在该平台上玩过游戏，该平台现在拥有&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statista.com/statistics/1192573 /daily-active-users-global-roblox/&quot;>;每日活跃用户超过 6500 万&lt;/a>;。&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;&lt;strong>;4.整合搜索和执行。&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;最后，公司必须整合其内部搜索和执行流程，以改善整个组织的知识流动，并提高新产品推出的速度。一方面，这需要将日常运营中的经验教训融入到研发过程中。紧密反馈循环的力量的一个例子是 &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/30/the-slack-origin-story/&quot;>;Slack&lt;/a>;，它最初是一个从事视频游戏的开发人员的业余项目，他们希望改善团队内部的沟通。作为该工具的用户和创建者，他们可以快速了解哪些功能最有效以及哪些功能可以使软件变得更好。当他们的游戏未能成功时，该公司意识到他们在 Slack 中构建了一些有价值的东西，可以帮助其他团队提高工作效率。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;另一方面，这意味着将搜索组件嵌入到执行中 - 对于例如，通过利用 A/B 测试来改进网页的设计（例如 &lt;a href=&quot;https://netflixtechblog.com/its-all-a-bout-testing-the-netflix-experimentation-platform-4e1ca458c15&quot; >;Netflix&lt;/a>; 或 &lt;a href=&quot;/2020/03/building-a-culture-of-experimentation&quot;>;Booking.com&lt;/a>;）或通过尽早向用户推出新解决方案以获得反馈。 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2023/05/19/a-short-history-of-chatgpt-how-we-got-to-where-we-are-today /?sh=5c3ce4e6674f&quot;>;考虑一下 ChatGPT 的成功推出&lt;/a>;，它免费提供不仅是为了激发兴趣，也是为了改进基于用户交互的技术。&lt;/p>; &lt;h3 style=&quot;文本对齐：居中；&quot;>;。 。 &lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;随着公司在充满不确定性的时代中前行，运营对于竞争优势仍然至关重要，但将以一种新的方式——通过高效地创造战略选择性。这意味着从“先思考后做”的模式转变为“边做边思考”的模式：战略制定和实施将变得更加交织在一起，成功的战略将根据运营数据不断调整以及定期出现的新运营能力以支持战略意图。&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;>;但是好奇心不仅是职业进步的关键，也是在工作中制定目标和意义的核心。我们都希望感觉到我们的工作是有意义的，并且我们都有机会做到这一点。但&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;需要对我们自己、我们的工作以及与我们一起工作的人产生好奇心，才能每天解锁更深层次的目标。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p >;

— &lt;/span>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;none&quot;>;对你的工作生活做出微小改变以将你现有的工作变成你想要的工作的艺术。这个想法是，通过对你的工作做一些小的改变，你可以根据你独特的激情、个性和兴趣来定制它，最大限度地发挥它对你和他人的意义。我最喜欢的例子是&lt;/span>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cbsnews.com/news/curtis-jenkins-lake-highlands-elementary-bus-driver-beloved-by-community-2019-05-24 /&quot;>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;none&quot;>;柯蒂斯·詹金斯&lt;/span>;&lt;/a>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;none&quot;>;，达拉斯公交车司机，他成功地改变了自己的立场，创造了记者所说的“黄色巴士乌托邦”同时改变了数百人的生活。 &lt;/span>;&lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6}&quot;>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;none&quot;>;让工作变得更有意义的第二种方法是让它是一门手艺。在历史的大部分时间里，人们经常会跨代从事职业。&lt;/span>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;none&quot;>;诸如 f&lt;/span>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;none&quot;>;武装、木工、&lt;

&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;none&quot;>;有内在的动机和目的知道我们已经尽最大努力去做某件事，我们已经以一种挑战我们的方式磨练了技艺。&lt;/span>;&lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot; ;:6}&quot;>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;none&quot;>;但是我们怎样才能在现代工作中找到手工艺的机会呢？毕竟，建立财务模型或在工厂领导团队可能会让人感觉与米开朗基罗的历史杰作有点遥远&lt;/span>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;none&quot;>;米开朗基罗的历史杰作&lt;/span>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;none&quot;>;或天才的 &lt;/span>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;none&quot;>;史蒂夫 &lt;/span>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;none&quot;>;乔布斯。但工艺与历史无关&lt;/span>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;none&quot;>;影响&lt;/span>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;none&quot;>;。这是关于自我完善和追求突破我们自己的表现极限——接受新的挑战并取得艰巨而独特的成就。当我在麦肯锡担任分析师时，这看起来就像用优雅的公式构建漂亮的 Excel 模型，可以让客户使用多年。无论合作伙伴是否注意到&lt;/span>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;none&quot;>;是否注意到&lt;/span>;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;none&quot;>;，我都这样做了，因为我为挑战和提高自己而感到自豪。在你的工作中，这是另一回事。好奇心可以解锁它。 &lt;/span>;&lt;span data-ccp-props=&quot;{&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6}&quot;>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;

And carve out time for conversations and interactions with your colleagues that don&#39;t just accomplish your work tasks but (in a professional way) enhance the relationship you have with them.

To find the most workable alternative, they should focus on four factors: the needs of the work, the needs of the people, how work gets done, and the new managerial muscle required to manage a hybrid workforce.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/10/does-your-hybrid-strategy-need-to-change?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/10/does-your-hybrid-strategy-need-to-change?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;This fall, companies are once again pushing workers to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/zoom-other-remote-work-champions-call-employees-back-to-the-office-e5a78c2d&quot;>;return&lt;/a>; to the office, continuing the debate over how many days employees should work together in person.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This debate continues to miss the point.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One-size-fits-all mandates can succeed only if work is a universal task executed by a homogenous workforce. Of course, we know neither is true. Instead of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/29/business/amazon-jobs-return-to-office/index.html&quot;>;threatening&lt;/a>; employees, CEOs should empower and enable their managers — especially those on the front line — to gain a deep and nuanced understanding of the work their teams do, the working style of their team members, and how that work best gets done. They must also consider the impact of generative AI, which will change all of these factors.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Our research, experience working with company leaders, and surveys of workers around the world show how considering these factors can lead to better outcomes for everyone.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Companies Are at a Crossroads&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;We can empathize with CEOs. Leaders must justify office rents despite record-low occupancy levels and build a culture of collaboration in a place with empty halls. They are grappling with &lt;a href=&quot;/2022/09/when-quiet-quitting-is-worse-than-the-real-thing&quot;>;quiet quitting&lt;/a>;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/lifestyle/careers/youve-heard-of-quiet-quitting-now-companies-are-quiet-cutting-ba2c326d&quot;>;quiet cutting&lt;/a>;, pressure from city governments to restore the vibrance of business districts, and the impact of generative AI.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But the answer to these pressures is not return-to-office mandates that essentially use face time as a performance management tool — think badge-swipe monitoring, which has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/13/google-rto-crackdown-gets-backlash-check-my-work-not-my-badge.html&quot;>;elicited notable backlash&lt;/a>;. Monitoring the time employees spend online doesn&#39;t work, either. A recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://slack.com/intl/en-gb/blog/news/state-of-work-2023&quot;>;survey of 18,149 desk workers and executives conducted by Slack&lt;/a>; revealed that 32% of employees&#39; time is spent on performative work, and 63% try to keep their status active online even if they&#39;re not working at that moment.&lt;/p>; &lt;article-promo>; &lt;hbr-component type=&quot;promo&quot; is-insight=&quot;insight-center&quot; title=&quot;The Future of Work&quot; dek=&quot;Will your company adapt or be left behind?&quot; cta-text=&quot;&quot; href=&quot;/insight-center/the-future-of-work&quot;>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/insight-center/the-future-of-work&quot; style=&quot;color:black;text-decoration:none&quot;>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; Insight Center Collection &lt;/div>; &lt;h3>;The Future of Work&lt;/h3>; &lt;div>; Will your company adapt or be left behind? &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hbr-component>; &lt;/article-promo>; &lt;p>;The inclination to associate physical presence or time active online with productivity is a symptom of a broader issue, as many of today&#39;s leaders struggle to embrace ways of working that are radically different from how they grew up. They proved themselves in a culture where commuting to the office to work from 9 to 5 was the norm, and where anyone who tried to work flexibly was marginalized — such as those on the “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.themuse.com/advice/mommy-track-what-to-do&quot;>;mommy track&lt;/a>;.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The most successful organizations will recognize that there is too much complexity to set rigid, top-down mandates, and that the managers who are at the rock face of the work, the team, and the customers are best positioned to make such decisions when they are empowered with the right skills and tools.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;CEOs and executive teams who focus on the following four actions can make work &lt;em>;work better &lt;/em>;for everyone.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Recognize the Needs of the Work&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;When we asked &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bcg.com/publications/2023/flexible-working-models&quot;>;more than 1,500 office-based workers&lt;/a>; when they wanted to be in person, we learned that they want to come to the office to do tasks and activities they consider best done there. For instance, participants were eight times more likely to prefer being in-person for affiliation and development, compared with doing work that requires focus or tackling administrative tasks, which are better done remotely.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But where employees feel most effective doing certain types of work is only one side of the coin. We also explored how much time they spend doing these tasks. We found that individual contributors spend 37% of their time on work they believe is done most effectively in person; for managers and executives, this jumps to 49%. But this is on average across organizations. It is important for leaders to spend time investigating what those preferences look like based on the nature of work and people across their organization.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It becomes even more critical to recognize which types of work are best done in different settings in the age of generative AI. When doing focus work, our survey data suggests that 65% of employees want to be remote — but some of this work can be greatly enhanced with the use of generative AI. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bcg.com/publications/2023/how-people-create-and-destroy-value-with-gen-ai&quot;>;field experiment that our BCG colleagues conducted&lt;/a>; with the support of a group of academics from HBS, MIT, Wharton, and the University of Warwick found that for tasks that involve creative ideation, GenAI generates output that should be considered as a final draft (versus a first draft that humans need to take time to edit). This means that for some employees, the mix of work that they do may start to shift, as they hand over some of the focus work they would have preferred to do remotely and pick up other tasks beyond the frontier of generative AI&#39;s competence. As a result, their work models may also need to shift, depending on what these new tasks are.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Recognize the Needs of the People&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;In our survey, roughly 90% of employees who identify as female, caregivers, LGBTQ+, or as having a disability consider flexible work options an important factor when deciding whether to stay in or leave their job. That is 30% higher than employees who did not identify with these categories. In other words: If you care about diversity, equity, and inclusion, you need to get your working model right.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We saw a particularly wide gap when it comes to gender: Female employees are 1.5 times more likely than their male counterparts to prioritize flexibility. And this is not just a working-mom phenomenon. We found only a marginal difference (3%) among women when comparing caregivers with non-caregivers.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Our biological cognitive differences also indicate preferences toward certain work environments. In some situations, groups of people doing the same job may have similar cognitive profiles. For example, a team of software engineers is more likely to be “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.01098/full&quot;>;analytical/tough-minded&lt;/a>;” and therefore might work best when allowed to maintain focus and prefer to have routines in how they do their day-to-day work.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But teams with high cognitive diversity will need more options to maintain optimum performance and happiness. We found outliers in our survey, for example — those who prefer to do interactive work remotely, and administrative or focus work in person. Some of their preferences are likely linked to cognitive characteristics such as introversion/extraversion.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Leaders struggling with how to think about getting the best out of employees with different cognitive profiles would do well to remember that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/deborahlovich/2022/03/02/its-past-time-to-treat-all-employees-like-customers/?sh=4e65e14126ff&quot;>;your people are just as diverse as your customers&lt;/a>;. Just as successful companies obsess about their customers and the decisions they make, it may be even more important for them to obsess about their employees. By doing so, they can reveal the root of the emotional and functional needs involved in making decisions about their careers — and create work environments that fulfill these needs.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Rethink How Work Gets Done&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;“Place” is just another tool for getting work done. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bcg.com/publications/2023/stop-tracking-employee-attendance-start-trusting-people&quot;>;As HBS professor Tsedal Neeley has observed&lt;/a>;, “I talk about using the office as a tool, the same way we use various technologies as tools to communicate and engage. If you see the office as a tool, you determine what specific uses it has for collaborations that require people to be physically present together.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yet 62% of our survey respondents told us that they do not have a say in their work model policy. Instead, it is dictated either by company-wide guidelines or by their manager. Of all participants, 39% reported that their company decides where they work. In these companies, 24% of employees were unhappy with their work location policy; this figure decreases to 14% if the manager decides, and to 6% if the team decides. The closer to the executors of the work the policy gets set, the more satisfied employees are.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Companies like &lt;a href=&quot;https://fortune.com/2023/05/05/cisco-ceo-chuck-robbins-rebranding-office-collaboration-center-slashing-private-workspaces-coax-employees-back/?utm_source=email&amp;amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;amp;utm_campaign=chro-daily&amp;amp;utm_content=2023081413pm&amp;amp;tpcc=NL_Marketing&quot;>;Cisco&lt;/a>; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.dropbox.com/topics/work-culture/the-shifting-dimensions-of-work#:~:text=At%20Dropbox%2C%20we&#39;ve%20decided,a%20daily%20basis%20post%2DCOVID.&quot;>;Dropbox&lt;/a>; are redesigning their office space to make it more amenable to collaboration. Such moves are consistent with their respective work model policies, which enable employees to do focus work remotely and encourage employees to come together for key events such as all-hands meetings. As Cisco&#39;s CEO Chuck Robbins put it, in today&#39;s world you have to offer a compelling “return on commute” to get your employees bought into coming into the office.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Redesigned work models also need to consider the ways in which we communicate. For example, we &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.verizon.com/about/news/verizon-study-focus-meeting-accomplish-more&quot;>;worked with Verizon&lt;/a>; to improve the way they run meetings, such as scheduling 25- or 50-minute meetings with a 5- or 10-minute lagged start time to give people breathing room. We also identified meetings that could be replaced by asynchronous modes of work (such as email, chat, shared documents, or offline review) and clarified what “required” and “optional” meant. In our experiments, 90% of participants reported overall meeting effectiveness had improved and 78% felt they wasted less time sitting in meetings where their live participation wasn&#39;t required.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Leaders will also need to monitor the impact of new technologies that they introduce. The generative AI experiment mentioned above also revealed that overreliance on generative AI can lead to a loss of collective diversity of ideas. As leaders seek to benefit from the value creation opportunities of generative AI, they&#39;ll need to consider where and how people collaborate most effectively to ensure they retain their creativity and innovativeness.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Invest in Building a New Managerial Muscle&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;The orchestration of these factors needs to come from managers — those at the front line, working with the teams. They are closest to the needs of the work, the people, and how that work gets done.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, this orchestration requires two new managerial muscles.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first is one that was not needed before Covid, when work was done in the office by default, nor during Covid, when remote work was predominant for many office-based professionals. Managers now need to facilitate discussions with and align their teams on where, when, and how work gets done. They need to hold weekly retrospectives on what worked, what didn&#39;t, and what to change in how they work the next week.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The second muscle is one that managers arguably needed before Covid, since working with distributed teams isn&#39;t new. Managers need to build their ability to create connection and culture as well as develop, inspire, mentor, and coach across distributed and hybrid teams. They must also meet employees&#39; emotional as well as functional needs. A&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bcg.com/publications/2022/all-about-generative-leadership-and-its-benefits&quot;>;recent BCG survey&lt;/a>; on employee expectations about leadership at work conducted across nine countries revealed that the top four qualities characterizing great leaders are recognition, people coaching and development, empathetic listening, and care.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Building these new managerial skills requires work, but the rewards are worth it: better performance, engagement, and retention, to name but a few. And just like any muscle, it needs investment of time and practice to strengthen. However, every organization can take positive steps starting from within: Identify your best managers — the ones who are already doing some of these things. Determine the specific habits and behaviors that set them apart, then follow a “best teach the rest” approach to help others learn how to develop similar capabilities. This is beyond simple training; it is about teaching, coaching, role modeling, and rewarding new ways of working every day.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In short: Instead of setting top-down mandates and expecting frontline managers to enforce them, leaders ought to focus on empowering those managers to co-create ways of working with their teams that are best suited to the needs of the people and the work they do, as well as the digital and GenAI tools at their disposal.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;While it may be easier to follow the crowd and issue blanket return-to-office policies, the potential upside of implementing thoughtful changes based on the four categories above is not only worth it — it will soon become an imperative for businesses that want to create and sustain work and talent advantages into the future.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 02 Oct 2023 21:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Better Ways to Support a Colleague with Breast Cancer]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/10/better-ways-to-support-a-colleague-with-breast-cancer]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;英雄图像 >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/10/Oct23_02_558367763.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label= &quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;HBR 工作人员/Willie B.

- 具体来说，我们如何帮助减轻癌症患者正在经历的精神痛苦。&lt;/span>;&lt; /p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;癌症很难从任何方面讨论&lt;/span>;&lt;em>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;任何&lt;/span>; &lt;/em>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;当然，这是一种观点，但工作场所有时会模糊地区分“与工作相关”和“与工作无关”的内容，尤其是在工作场所。具有挑战性的场景。为了更好地了解这些情况，我们采访了五位女性，她们在工作中谈论了她们的乳腺癌诊断，她们经历了同事的各种反应。虽然样本量很小，但我们相信，他们的故事共同表明，通过这种经历来支持同事有更好和更坏的方法，并且他们提供了一些有用的策略来帮助面临这种诊断的人。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;不该说的话&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;乳腺癌患者常常被善意但无益的陈词滥调所困扰，尤其是与他们在工作中只是偶然认识的人。根据哈里斯民意调查，21% 的患有癌症的职业成年人遇到“关于他们的癌症诊断的不敏感或冒犯性的评论。”&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot; >;萨布丽娜·埃利松多 (Sabrina Elizondo) 是一家混合媒体制作公司的执行制片人，她在化疗期间的某个时刻，感觉好多了，并发布了一些自己在音乐节上侧手翻的照片。接下来的周一上班时，她的老板评论道：“&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;如果你有精力做侧手翻，我觉得你就有精力承担更多的工作。 ”这一观察感觉就像是一记重击，让埃利松多原本对能够享受一点乐趣的感激之情变成了非人化。 &lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;“她的冷漠让我感觉自己作为一个人很少受到关注和关心，”埃利松多解释道。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt; span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;会计师杰米·帕肯 (Jamie Parcon) 指出，即使是看似来自支持者的评论也可能会产生意想不到的痛苦反响。 “我觉得五分之一的回答是他们认识其他患有乳腺癌的人，”帕肯说。莱昂斯说，她认为这是大多数人的本能反应。 “我们希望将其与我们自己的故事联系起来，”她说。 “每个人都曾遭遇过癌症。”不过，虽然这句话似乎无伤大雅，但帕肯解释道，“知道其他人不得不受苦，这并没有让我感觉更好。”&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font- Weight: 400;&quot;>;其他下意识的反应，比如“你会渡过难关的！”很诱人，但它们也可能疏远正在经历这种危险经历的人——尤其是如果这就是 &lt;/span>;&lt;i>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;全部 &lt;/span>;&lt;/i>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;你这么说，却没有得到有意义的支持。 “我听到的是陈词滥调，然后就沉默了，”娱乐业律师阿奈斯·马西洛 (Anais Masiello) 说。 “支持的话很容易得到，但我非常清楚[我的工作能力下降]已经变得多么沉重，这让我感到孤立。”&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;诸如“你会打败这个”之类的变幻莫测的内容通常也不受欢迎。另外，当您不了解所有细节时，承诺或暗示完全康复是不合适的。 “与‘你已经拿到了！’相比，一条真诚、有用的短信意义重大，”市警察局发言人凯西·利宁 (Casey Liening) 说。这里还有一种隐含的、常常不被重视的情绪在起作用：癌症患者是“战士”，他们将战胜体内的敌人。当然，这不是癌症治疗的原理，这种情绪实际上可能会产生相反的效果，尤其是当事情感觉特别具有挑战性时：“这让我感觉自己很虚弱，不够坚强，”埃利松多说。&lt;/span >;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;要避免的另一个陷阱：避免主动提供建议。 “这不是被要求或需要的，”利宁说。 “当我第一次得知我的治疗不包括手术、化疗或放射时，我一定告诉了工作中的人。这引发了一个谣言，说我选择不接受任何类型的治疗，”她说。同事们分享他们的想法是非常不受欢迎的&lt;/span>;&lt;i>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;非常&lt;/span>;&lt;/i>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>; 。在这种可能危及生命的经历中告诉某人如何感觉、做什么或对他们的健康做出假设既是不必要的，而且毫无疑问是没有帮助的。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;虽然担心同事的工作量及其对您的影响是可以理解的，但这些想法需要退居第二位。他们的福祉和健康必须放在第一位，而不是他们完成工作的能力。 “对于感到压力的同事来说，我也有压力，&lt;/span>;&lt;i>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;加上&lt;/span>;&lt;/i>;&lt;span style =&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;化疗、化疗脑、更年期脑，以及转移性癌症带来的所有担忧和经济压力，”Elizondo 说。 “我很惊讶自己做得这么好，但有时我想提醒我的老板我正在处理&lt;/span>;&lt;i>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;这个&lt;/span>;&lt;i>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>; span>;&lt;/i>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>; 最重要的是，所以他们让我放松了一点。但我也不想要一张怜悯卡或一个“特殊”的叙述。这是一把双刃剑。”&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;支持患有乳腺癌的同事的更好方法&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;最重要的事情？ “跟随他们的领导，”莱昂斯说。有些人愿意敞开心扉，有些人则不愿意。对于一些人来说，他们的工作生活可能为他们提供了远离癌症现实生活的避风港，他们可能不想谈论癌症及其带来的一切——如果是这样，请尊重这一点。 （哈里斯民意调查发现，40% 的受访者表示，他们继续工作是为了感觉“尽可能正常”。）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;也就是说，我们要求采访的女性分享她们实际感受到的例子&lt;/span>;&lt;i>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;感受&lt;/span>;&lt;/i>;&lt;span style =&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>; 在工作中提供支持，帮助指导您的行动。帕肯讲述了一位同事寄给她的一张卡片。 “里面写着‘我很抱歉这件事发生在你身上。’”这很简单，是的，但“这些话就像一股新鲜空气，”她说。 “我最终从其他人那里得到的是同理心，而不是同情。”当这些词感觉具体而不是笼统时，马谢洛同样很欣赏。马谢洛说，真诚的关怀之词看起来像是“你的力量是鼓舞人心的，我只是希望你不必这么坚强”，或者注意到她接受治疗的那天早上说“再来一次！” “所有这些小动作都意义重大，”她说。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;远离迂腐的陈词滥调，而是对同事的关注确切的情况表明理解并传达关怀。 “一位同事对我说过的让我永远不会忘记的一件事是‘第四阶段并不是死刑，’”Liening 说。 “这意味着更多一点，因为有时确实感觉就是这样。微妙地提醒人们保持积极态度总是很有启发性的。”虽然这些情绪和更一般的反应之间的界限对于那些自己没有经历过癌症的人来说可能并不明显，但它们之间存在数量级的差异。在列宁的例子中，评论者既知道也记得有关她的诊断的具体信息，并且在支持和有毒阳性之间保持着微妙的界限：没有热情洋溢的承诺，只有在事实和个人经历中的深思熟虑。然而，值得一提的是，并不是每个人都想要&lt;/span>;&lt;i>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;想要&lt;/span>;&lt;/i>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>; ”>; 积极性。有时，只是重申“这太糟糕了”就令人振奋。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;Parcon 也喜欢同事签到，因为这让她不必自愿更新。马谢洛的同事们纷纷采取行动，这是另一种具体的帮助方式：“有同事简单地处理事情，而我不必担心，这是最有帮助的事情。他们不希望我在治疗或手术期间担心我的工作。我让同事告诉我我错过的任何电话或会议，这样我就不会感觉自己被排除在外，”她说。 “我被鼓励尽可能多地抽出时间，并且知道在我不在的时候总会有人为我提供帮助。同事们先发制人地介入，代表我处理事情，并认真检查我的表现。”Masiello 说。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-体重：400；&quot;>;莱昂斯表示，这对于创建支持性文化大有帮助——你越积极主动，癌症患者的负担就越轻。毕竟，“如果我能做点什么，请告诉我”有多少次会遭到沉默？当涉及到工作量和与工作相关的任务时，只需&lt;/span>;&lt;i>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;做&lt;/span>;&lt;/i>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400 ;&quot;>;有事，别问。图书馆主管杰西卡·赛德纳 (Jessica Sidener) 表示，她的同事们做的最出乎意料的周到的事情之一就是协助她确定任务的优先顺序。 “当我做得太多时，我的同事们会友善而明确地让我知道，并帮助我确定待办事项、义务和责任的优先顺序，尤其是当我感到不知所措而无法独自处理它们时，”她解释道。 “对于那些确实有紧迫感的任务，他们想出了如何介入。”&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;这种感觉社区也可以提供安慰。 “我的同事们的总体态度是&lt;/span>;&lt;i>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;我们&lt;/span>;&lt;/i>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;会渡过难关，而&lt;/span>;&lt;i>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;你&lt;/span>;&lt;/i>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;会渡过难关这个，”西德纳说。当她的同事为她举办筹款活动并说“没有人孤军奋战”时，列宁也感受到了这种团结感。她说：“这最令人惊奇地提醒我，我的支持系统有多么庞大。”&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;重要的是请记住，您的同事可能面临的恐惧不一定有时间范围，因此支持也不应该有时间范围。虽然您的同事可能会结束治疗，宣布病情缓解，并看似康复，但“治疗后会出现挑战，”莱昂斯说。那些已经战胜癌症、现在从技术上讲已经“站在癌症的另一边”的人将面临复发的恐惧，面临长达数年的日常药物治疗及其副作用，以及与肿瘤科医生的后续预约，可能会与身体的全面恢复作斗争。疤痕，并可能会经历令人衰弱的疲惫。&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;乳腺癌通常并不快速或简单。它不会用弓绑起来。人们在未来的几年里都要应对后遗症。持续的检查所带来的同情心——“你感觉怎么样？”或“对你来说，生存是什么样的？” ——可能是无价的。 &lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;&lt;br>; &lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;&lt;br>; &lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font -weight: 400;&quot;>;最后，值得注意的是，遵循此建议并不能保证不会犯错或发表令您患有癌症的同事感到受伤的评论。而且您可能并不总是知道您的想法、评论或行动何时或是否以这种方式被接受。但这并不是停止出现或避开同事的理由——消失的行为可能是最痛苦的。谦逊、愿意接受纠正以及不断努力让你的同事感到被关心是你最大的资产——好好利用它们。 “能够保持开放，并且[这种开放]遇到爱确实很有帮助，”马西洛说。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;JASON BUECHEL：&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我的幸运之一就是与约翰一起工作[麦基]历时九年，大约有 11 个月的时间来完成我们的过渡。这对我来说是一个很好的机会能够融入这个角色。我得到了约翰的大力支持，他真的希望我在这 11 个月的时间里帮助承担其中的一些职责。当我正式担任这个角色时，我已经做好了准备。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;对于我们的团队成员来说，担任这样的角色也是一个非常困难的过程。约翰担任我们的首席执行官 42 年，最终这就是他们所知道的。对我来说，与我们的团队成员联系非常重要，确保我们能够提供愿景，并确保他们了解全食超市的要素、我们的文化、我们的核心价值观和我们的更高目标。它们将保持完整，我的工作就是帮助承担这些责任并支持我们能够保持全食超市和重要元素的完整。&lt;/p>; &lt;hbr-component type=&quot;newsletter&quot;

&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;JASON BUECHEL：&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;了解团队成员的声音非常重要。他们在这个转变中寻找什么以及什么对他们来说是重要的？对我来说，我利用这 11 个月的机会做了一次我们称之为“整体对话之旅”的活动，这让我对团队成员的想法有了一些深刻的见解。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在某些情况下，他们您是否担心约翰退休后我们的文化或质量标准是否会发生重大变化？未来的情况会怎样？对于我们的利益相关者来说，无论是供应商还是客户、社区合作伙伴，我认为在进行过渡时了解所有这些利益相关者的声音非常重要。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我认为我要给出的另一部分建议是确保你不只是想成为那个领导者。对我来说，约翰和我，我们以非常不同的方式领导，这就是为什么我们在合作中如此互补。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这也是关于做真实的自己，同时确保你的支持公司及其需要走向何方。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS：&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;您的首席执行官之路并不典型。也许没有人是这样，但尤其是你的不是。谈谈你的过去、你的生活和职业生涯以及它是如何最终担任这个角色的？&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;JASON BUECHEL：&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我有工作机会自 2000 年以来，我一直从事零售业。我的第一套经验实际上来自于咨询。我在埃森哲工作，有机会与美国和世界各地的许多领先零售商和杂货商合作。这就是我在零售领域工作的热情。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这份职业让我与 Whole Foods Market 的几位高管建立了联系，其中包括我们的前联合首席执行官 Walter Robb 和首席财务官 Glenda Flanagan。当他们正在寻找新的首席信息官或首席技术官时，他们联系了我。我提供了一些我认为适合这份工作的客户的名字，他们回过来说：“你为什么不把你的名字写上？我们非常希望您考虑加入全食超市。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我来到奥斯汀，在这里呆了两天，并且非常欣赏这样一个事实：更高的目标和核心价值观是&#39;不仅仅是墙上的文字。他们日复一日地过着日子。这让我意识到，这是我工作并度过余下职业生涯的正确地方。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当我加入 Whole Foods 时，我负责技术以及我们的数字业务。帮助我们建立我们尚未推出的送货和取货业务。在那段时间里，我还帮助我们寻找方法来建立一些我们以前没有的组织和支持实践，就像我们的第一个运营支持团队一样。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;随着我在全食超市度过了更多的时间，我选择了在团队成员服务（其他公司称之为人力资源）等领域承担额外的职责，并最终于 2019 年 1 月担任首席运营官。经历这一角色确实帮助我为下一步迈向成功做好了准备。首席执行官职位。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS：&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在那之前我就在想你的过去。当我第一次与你们的员工联系时，他们说：“他是一个奶酪人。你必须明白这一点。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;JASON BUECHEL：&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当然。我与食物有着很长的渊源，从七岁起我就开始园艺。我父亲实际上是一名奶酪制造商。我的父母都是在奶牛场长大的。我当时在威斯康星州农村，与我们的粮食系统有着有趣的联系，很高兴今天有机会担任我可以帮助影响和支持我们子孙后代的粮食系统的角色。&lt;/p>; &lt; p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS：&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;全食超市向亚马逊巨头报告意味着什么？&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;JASON BUECHEL： &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我们在很多方面都非常荣幸。首先，也是最重要的，在过去六年中，我们真正兴奋的一件事是，我们真正关注全食超市的长期发展，并且能够得到亚马逊的支持，为我们提供能力，使我们能够我们以最令人惊奇的方式为我们的客户提供服务。无论是通过技术还是其他服务，能够帮助创造出色的客户体验是亚马逊提供帮助的事情之一。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;此外，我们正在帮助重新定义杂货店的面貌。这个空间。拥有一家拥有资源和专业知识的母公司，我们可以利用这些资源和专业知识来支持全食超市，这非常重要。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我也很欣赏同样的事情，我们能够成为全食超市并保持我们的文化。我之前提到过，我们仍然有同样的更高目标和核心价值观。虽然我们是亚马逊的一部分，但这实际上是一种互补的关系，我们提供我们所能提供的最好的产品，并且我们能够插入并利用亚马逊内部最好的产品。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>; ADI IGNATIUS：&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我认为我们与我们喜欢的品牌有情感联系。您对那些热爱 Whole Foods 品牌及其品牌承诺，但对亚马逊没有同样感情的人们有什么想说的？&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;JASON BUECHEL：&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;在某些情况下，它可以帮助这些客户了解他们可以使用的一些好处，亚马逊也可以为他们提供支持。无论是使用 Amazon One 在我们的一家商店提供更快的结账服务，还是最终的一些支持和工作，我们都在共同寻找帮助实现我们的环境和可持续发展承诺的方法。&lt;/p >; &lt;p>;这是我们很多客户关心的事情，也是我们作为 Whole Foods 能够利用的事情，并支持我们围绕环境的核心价值。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS：&lt;/strong>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;您认为全食超市面临的最大挑战是什么？仅仅是为了尽快增长、增加新店吗？或者你会以其他方式思考这个问题吗？&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;JASON BUECHEL：&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这实际上是在弄清楚我们如何扩大我们的影响力和影响力。显然，我们要做到这一点的方法之一就是增加新商店，但同时也在寻找为客户提供服务的新方法。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我们今年早些时候推出的产品之一是能够直接购买商品。通过亚马逊运送到客户家中。目前，我们的独家品牌拥有超过 800 种产品，以我们的 365 品牌为例。我们可以通过新的方式为更多客户提供服务。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我们也非常关注如何帮助支持我们滋养地球上人类的更高目标。这不仅仅是为了增长而增长，而是我们如何帮助成为变革的力量？&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我真正热衷的事情之一是再生农业。这是一个机会，最终将使我们能够利用我们今天所了解和喜爱的产品，并确保我们能够继续为子孙后代生产这些产品。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS：&lt;/strong >;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;对于不熟悉再生产品或农业概念的人来说，这意味着什么？&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;JASON BUECHEL：&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p >; &lt;p>;在这个领域，我认为很多消费者不明白我们目前的表土继续失去生产我们所了解和喜爱的产品所需的营养。再生不仅是帮助将这些养分带回土壤，而且是以可持续的方式提供帮助。确保我们能够继续支持我们的土壤和更广泛的生物环境，不仅继续生产我们今天所了解和喜爱的产品，而且最终创建一个不会像我们今天所看到的那样具有破坏性的生态系统。 How do we make sure that we can partner with our suppliers so they can support these practices and be an advocate for them?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One of the things I&#39;m really proud of is that we&#39;ve already launched three regenerative products under our own exclusive brands to help take that leadership position. One of my personal favorites is our green lentils under our Whole Foods Market brand, a great product. And it&#39;s one of the very first certified regenerative products from a private label perspective on the market.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Your strategy, if I understand it, seems essentially still to be primarily a brick and mortar one. Do you feel the need to become more of an e-tailer going forward?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;JASON BUECHEL:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The reality is we are an e-tailer today. Whether you are having products delivered to your house, you&#39;re picking them up in one of our stores, you&#39;re getting some of our exclusive brand products like our 365 products shipped directly to your home: we&#39;re already playing in that space. I continue to see that we&#39;ll have opportunities both in the physical experience as well as online.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A lot of our customers like to shop through multiple different channels. In some cases they&#39;d like to have center of store picked for them and ready for them to pick it up when they shop the store, and then look at our perimeter, whether it&#39;s picking out their own meat or seafood or interacting with our team members. As an example, at our cheese case, a certified cheese professional can help choose exactly the right cheeses as you&#39;re putting together your cheeseboard and charcuterie plates.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So fast-forward, not way into the future, but a year or two or three. How do you think the in-store experience will change for Whole Foods customers?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;JASON BUECHEL:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We&#39;re going to continue to find ways to help simplify and make things easier for our customers. One of the things our customers find value in is our ability to help save them time. In some cases, as I mentioned earlier, delivery and pickup help support that. We want to be able to find ways that customers can find products in the store faster. How can we better provide the expertise across all the different areas within our stores so customers can make sure we&#39;re supporting the amazing events and dinners they&#39;re helping prepare for their family and loved ones, and ultimately, checking out faster in our stores?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There&#39;s a lot of things we&#39;re making investments on where technology will support things, and investments into our team-member experience, to make sure that our team members can best serve our customers and help save them time.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I want to go to an audience question. This is from Holly who&#39;s in Boston. Do you have any recommendations for how companies can best develop an internal leader to be the next CEO, including maybe external development programs?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;JASON BUECHEL:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One of the things I&#39;m really, really proud of is the investment we put into our team member experience and focus around internal growth and development. We had over 11,000 promotions over the last 12 months, which I&#39;m so proud of.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, when I look at my executive team, two of my direct reports actually started in our stores part-time. Our head of operations, Bill Jordan, as an example, joined through Mrs. Gooch&#39;s [Natural Food Markets], which was one of our acquisitions. He&#39;s worked across almost every part of our stores, multiple regions, and now leads operations reporting directly to me for all of Whole Foods Market.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We&#39;re making big investments into career development programs. We do this for our major leadership positions within the organization. Just yesterday, I was actually doing the keynote graduation ceremony for our store team leader career development program which is focused on a six-month period, helping make sure our team members are ready to take that next step up.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For our most senior leadership positions, we&#39;ve helped cross-pollinate and have leaders work across multiple different parts of the company. That was something I was privileged to be part of, being able to lead multiple different functions before stepping into this role.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One of the other things that&#39;s really unique for us is both for our executive team and something we call WFLN, which is the Whole Foods Market Leadership Network, built of our 19 most senior leaders. We collectively work together across all different facets. Folks are helping participate in work in parts of the company they may not lead. For us, it&#39;s really making sure we&#39;re working together as a team and helping make sure we&#39;re bringing some of those experiences and expertise across our entire leadership team.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I&#39;m also really proud of the fact that 50% of the group I just mentioned grew up in our stores, and so that expertise of knowing Whole Foods and being able to build a career in a functional area is something we&#39;re really proud of.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Let&#39;s shift gears a little bit. This is another audience question, from Punjab, Pakistan, and it&#39;s about hybrid work. How do you manage the fact that your frontline workers need to be there full-time in the stores, versus white collar workers who are able to work hybrid? How do you balance that?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;JASON BUECHEL:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We&#39;ve done a return to office where our store support team members are required to be in the office three days a week, but ultimately many of them also have to spend time in our stores or in our facilities, helping connect with team members.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One of the things that&#39;s been an important part of our vision is something I call store-centricity, in making sure that every single one of our store support team members has a connection to our stores. We ultimately have included it in something we call our job-dialogue process, which is part of our performance management process, on setting the expectation, and ultimately having team members talk about the things they&#39;ve done over the course of the last 12 months to connect with our stores, and what those experiences have taught them.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We&#39;ve also built some programs around our senior leadership and other leaders that we have within our store support group, and actually pairing them with stores and partnering up with our store team leaders, and finding ways that we can better support our stores, and ultimately making sure that we can bring those experiences where our store support team members really understand everything that&#39;s happening day-to-day in a store, what it takes to lead a store, and how do we help improve our team member and customer experiences in the work that we do.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To build on that, you used the phrase before, the theater of retail. I love that term. When you think about Whole Foods, the Whole Foods experience, what is your theater of retail?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;JASON BUECHEL:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For so many of our customers, they&#39;re coming to Whole Foods as an oasis, to get out of the hectic day-to-day life, you know? One of my favorite examples of that is our Manhattan West store, located in Hudson Yards in Manhattan, and you get off the busy street and you walk in the store, and it&#39;s just an immediate sense of Zen. For me, we want to be able to create this oasis for customers, bring the theater of retail.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We want our customers to have sensory overloads in the experiences they have, as they&#39;re walking into produce, the smells that they&#39;re having, the beautiful merchandising that they&#39;re seeing, the demos of products that we&#39;re doing in the store. We can be at our very best when we&#39;re helping bring this theater to life for our customers, because it&#39;s one of the reasons they&#39;re coming to our stores.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We have a question from Reno, Nevada in the US. How does Whole Foods think about the phenomenon of food deserts. You aren&#39;t everywhere. You&#39;re in markets that can sustain it. How do you think about the food desert issue, at least in the US, and whether there&#39;s anything you can do to alleviate that.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;JASON BUECHEL:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is one of the areas we&#39;ve actually made investments in and have tried to find ways to support those who might be underserved or don&#39;t have access to some of the highest quality products we sell at Whole Foods Market. We have an entire foundation that we call &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wholecitiesfoundation.org/about/&quot;>;Whole Cities&lt;/a>;, which has been dedicated to some of these efforts, in not only having us establish stores, but ultimately investing in communities through a lot of different programs that can help bring access to food in these underserved communities.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Here&#39;s a question from London in the UK. Having followed a very dynamic, well-profiled CEO, how do you think about the role of the CEO? Does it need to be a very public-facing role, or not necessarily?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;JASON BUECHEL:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It really depends upon the company. You know, are you public or private? In our case, we are a subsidiary, and for me, the most important role that I have is internal from that perspective. Obviously, having responsibilities external allows us to support our stakeholders as well, so when I look at the time that I spend, it&#39;s probably 80% on the internal side of things, and in the 20% I&#39;m spending external, it&#39;s really trying to help connect with and support our stakeholders.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I give a great example on this with our suppliers. How do we help bring a voice into other organizations, folks within government, around some of the work that we need to do to help support our farmers and our suppliers and ranchers?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It&#39;s figuring out that right balance, but the responsibility I personally have is serving as our internal leader, and making sure that our team members understand the vision that we have as an organization. I&#39;m spending time directly in our stores, connecting with our team members, making sure that they understand where we are going, and making sure we can get feedback. My job is to be a servant leader in serving our stores. One of the things I really have tried to do is set the tone across the entire organization of us being store-centric.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When we launched our new vision, growing with purpose, in January, one of the commitments we made is that every single one of our stores is being visited by a member of our executive team. There&#39;s eight of us, so for our 535+ stores, we&#39;re spending a lot of time on this road show this year, connecting with our team members, making sure they understand where we&#39;re going and getting their feedback of what they&#39;re seeing. It&#39;s helping us improve and elevate many of the priorities and initiatives we&#39;re doing across the organization.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I don&#39;t think we&#39;ve been through a show this year without talking about generative AI. We have a question from Tampa, Florida, which is just how do you think about AI and how it can, or maybe already is, changing the grocery shopping experience?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;JASON BUECHEL:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It&#39;s going to fundamentally change retail and grocery over the course of the next 10 years. To go into one of your earlier questions, this is one of the great things about being a subsidiary of Amazon as well, and being able to leverage capabilities on this side.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When I think about how we work, things are going to change. You know, the role of a merchant, which is very much at the center of retail in how you select product, decisions that you&#39;re going to be making around assortment, and pricing, and merchandising. We&#39;re going to have additional insights and toolsets that AI is going to really influence.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I think about all of the different, amazing things that this is going to provide for customers as well, whether it&#39;s helping build out a shopping list, to helping select products that you&#39;re going to bring together for an amazing meal or experience that you&#39;re preparing for, to helping provide discovery. I think there&#39;s going to be so many different applications in how this is going to make things easier, better, and more impactful for our customers, and at the same time, allowing us to raise the bar on how we look at things like assortment and all of the key things that we do in bringing the experiences to our customers.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;You&#39;ve talked a couple times about sustainability, and I know that&#39;s a big priority for you. How does a company go from wanting generally to do the right thing in terms of climate change, in terms of sustainability, to really making it fundamental?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;JASON BUECHEL:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First and foremost, it&#39;s important to be authentic. For us, within our core values, the environment has always played a role. The work that we&#39;ve done in supporting the organic movement is an example, which has been the leading climate-friendly agricultural practice over the last several decades. It&#39;s always been part and parcel around how we can make sure that this is authentically connected to the work we&#39;re doing. For us it&#39;s easy, because it ties to our higher purpose of nourishing people on the planet.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When it comes down to doing things just for the sake of hitting metrics and goals, when you&#39;re not thinking about how this ties to why you&#39;re doing it, I think you have to take a step back and really understand, “How does this actually connect to the company&#39;s vision, and the mission, and the goals that we&#39;re trying to do?” If it&#39;s not authentically there, understand the changes that you need to make within the organization to make sure that it is. That would be my top piece of advice.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Here&#39;s a question from Ontario, Canada, about retention: what strategies has the company implemented to retain employees?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;JASON BUECHEL:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One of the top things is providing growth opportunities for our team members. I mentioned a little bit earlier we had 11,000 promotions over the last 12 months. One of the things that&#39;s important about doing that is providing ways by which we can help support our team members&#39; growth and happiness.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One area I&#39;m excited about is an apprentice program. We currently have three live, a Butcher Apprentice program, a Certified Cheese Professional, and a Bakery Decorator Apprentice. We&#39;re going to be rolling this out so each one of our departments and teams has an apprentice program going forward. This allows team members to develop skills and trades they can use at Whole Foods Market and elsewhere in their life.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It&#39;s not only great for the team member, but it&#39;s great for our customers: our customers are actually coming to Whole Foods Market for the great expertise and experience we can provide. By having things like this in place, it makes sure that our team members are supported in taking those next steps for growth within the company.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I mentioned a little bit earlier the career development programs we do. We do this throughout our entire organization, so we&#39;ve got programs from multiple levels within our store, around store leadership as an example. Team members not only see their current next-step opportunities, but they see the growth and support they&#39;re going to have at future levels as well.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One other area that I&#39;m proud of is something called Cultivate. It&#39;s a mentoring program that we have in place, and this is very unique to Whole Foods Market. Most other retailers might offer this type of program for their store team leader or store leadership. We open up all this for our team members so they have opportunities to connect with other folks to get supporting, coaching, mentoring experiences.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I have a great example of connecting the two where we have a team member, Marie in Hawaii, who&#39;s connected with a mentor who&#39;s in Boston, and the experience that she&#39;s able to have virtually in a wonderful way to learn things that allow her not only to grow, but bring new experiences into her store. Examples like that have team members not only connected to Whole Foods, but knowing that they&#39;re supported for an entire career they can have with us.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We&#39;re almost out of time, but I want to ask the cliche question you probably get all the time. When I interviewed Howard Schultz when he was CEO of Starbucks, I had to ask, what does he order when he walks up to the barista. So when you shop Whole Foods, what&#39;s in your basket? What are some of your favorites?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;JASON BUECHEL:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Well, every shop is a little bit different depending upon what I&#39;m preparing for. When I&#39;m going through produce, I&#39;m always picking up bananas, blueberries, avocado. At our seafood counter, I&#39;m looking at whatever&#39;s coming fresh. I love our salmon. It&#39;s one of my favorite products. In meat, it&#39;s the ribeye. In cheese, I&#39;m looking to see what artisan cheeses we have in place. Current favorites right now are Uplands and Jasper Hill as far as producers. The Harbison is actually one of my personal favorites. In our prepared foods, I hit the salad bar almost daily for lunch. And in center store, I&#39;m always trying to check out whatever store I&#39;m in, what are the local products? Local is a really important part of Whole Foods Market, so I love discovering new local favorites in whatever store I&#39;m at.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I assume your certified cheese professional gets a little nervous when you walk up and ask what they&#39;ve got?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;JASON BUECHEL:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Not at all, because they know that I&#39;m excited about a great conversation we&#39;re going to have on some of their favorites. And usually it involves tasting a few samples as well, so always a great experience.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;All right, well Jason, I want to thank you for being on the show. It&#39;s really great to hear your thoughts, and thank you for being here.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;JASON BUECHEL:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Thanks for having me.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 30 Sep 2023 02:55:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[The Next Supply-Chain Challenge Isn&rsquo;t a Shortage &mdash; It&rsquo;s Inventory Glut]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/09/the-next-supply-chain-challenge-isnt-a-shortage-its-inventory-glut]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/09/Sep23_29_594832575.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;Halfdark/Getty Images&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;Inventory challenges aren&amp;#8217;t new. Electronics littered shelves in 2001 after the dot-com bubble burst. In 2009, the financial crash left manufacturers with excess inventory when consumer buying power suddenly dropped. And now, the high-tech industry is feeling the weight of a volatile market that has led to excess component inventory. Measuring inventory momentum can help leaders address the problem. It&amp;#8217;sa forward-looking metric based on the classic momentum equation: current inventory x rate of inventory change.&amp;#160;Once leaders understand their inventory momentum, they can take actions to reduce excess inventory, stem the rate of inventory change, and prevent the situation from happening in the future.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/the-next-supply-chain-challenge-isnt-a-shortage-its-inventory-glut?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/the-next-supply-chain-challenge-isnt-a-shortage-its-inventory-glut?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;It&#39;s March 2020. Store shelves sit empty, without any toilet paper or cleaning supplies in sight. Tablets and electronic devices are out of stock. Consumers are clamoring for the basics they need to suddenly work and learn from home and live under quarantine. Meanwhile, on Zoom calls and in email threads, company leaders around the world are racing to put in giant orders with their suppliers to speed up supply-chain lags and get products to customers. In the supply-and-demand equation, demand seems infinite.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Now, three-plus years later, we&#39;re seeing the stark aftereffects of that spike in demand. After the race to order key components and manufacture products, suppliers are left with mountains of excess inventory as growth has slowed to normal levels. In the tech industry, it&#39;s common for warehouses to be &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/28/how-the-world-went-from-a-semiconductor-shortage-to-a-major-glut.html&quot;>;full of now-outdated semiconductors&lt;/a>; and other technology components. When those components were ordered, they were in hot demand. Now, companies are dispositioning excess electronic components (selling them at lower prices, scrapping them, using them in alternate products, and trying to sell them back to suppliers) to get them off their balance sheets.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Beyond the obvious environmental cost, an inventory glut of high-end electronics components is an expensive problem. Excess inventory is a $250+ billion problem in the US alone, according to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kearney.com/industry/technology/article/-/insights/how-can-high-tech-companies-digest-250-billion-in-inventory&quot;>;2023 Kearney study&lt;/a>;. On a global scale, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.census.gov/mtis/www/data/pdf/mtis_current.pdf&quot;>;US census data&lt;/a>; shows excess inventory amounts to trillions of dollars. Someone pays for all that extra inventory.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;And this problem isn&#39;t a pandemic-era anomaly. New demand spikes are coming our way — you only have to consider the seemingly “infinite” demand for electric vehicle batteries or the boom of chipsets that drive AI-powered technology to see how similar cycles could play out in the near future.&lt;/p>; &lt;article-promo>; &lt;hbr-component type=&quot;promo&quot; is-insight=&quot;insight-center&quot; title=&quot;The New Age of Operations&quot; dek=&quot;Improving efficiency and increasing resilience.&quot; cta-text=&quot;&quot; href=&quot;/insight-center/the-new-age-of-operations&quot;>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/insight-center/the-new-age-of-operations&quot; style=&quot;color:black;text-decoration:none&quot;>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; Insight Center Collection &lt;/div>; &lt;h3>;The New Age of Operations&lt;/h3>; &lt;div>; Improving efficiency and increasing resilience. &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hbr-component>; &lt;/article-promo>; &lt;p>;As we look ahead at a new age of operations, leaders have the opportunity to address the current inventory problem and be stewards of a healthy, sustainable industry ecosystem. Players in every part of the value chain (from component suppliers to manufacturers) have a key role in preventing this kind of waste in the future. We see the opportunity for forward-thinking leaders to blaze a trail, modeling a more sustainable way of collaborating for shared success.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;How Inventory Gluts Occur&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Inventory challenges aren&#39;t new. Electronics littered shelves in 2001 after the dot-com bubble burst. Then, in 2009, the financial crash left manufacturers with excess inventory when consumer buying power suddenly dropped. And now, the high-tech industry is feeling the weight of a volatile market that has led to excess component inventory.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Excess inventory can happen at any part of the supply chain. Here&#39;s a hypothetical example: As cloud computing booms, a company selling servers (also known as an original equipment manufacturer or OEM) gets a giant order for server equipment. The OEM, in turn, sends an order to their contract manufacturer for this server. (“We need as many as you can make!”) The contract manufacturer starts sourcing all of the parts they need to make those servers, including two kinds of semiconductors (we&#39;ll call them “A” and “B” semiconductors). The contract manufacturer searches high and low for those semiconductors; getting the parts could take a year. Once all the parts are finally in hand, surprise! The original order has changed. The technology has advanced, and the demand has shifted. Now those same servers use “B” and “C” semiconductors. The contract manufacturer is stuck with warehouses full of the outdated semiconductors “A” and excess quantities of “B,” creating a very expensive and very wasteful problem.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The key problem is in the original order. Demand is never actually “infinite” or fully predictable given technology changes. Every manufacturer must creatively collaborate with their customers to understand realistic demand for what they will manufacture. There&#39;s also an opportunity for suppliers, manufacturers, and distributors to creatively work together to return components that do not get used and get them in the hands of someone who needs them.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;How One Manufacturer Is Turning the Tide on Excess Inventory&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Let&#39;s look at how one contract manufacturer we have worked with is managing the problem of excess inventory. The manufacturer&#39;s excess inventory was steadily inching toward unsustainable levels, while external factors like increasing interest rates created an intractable problem.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Company leaders started applying the concept of “Inventory Momentum,” a forward-looking metric based on the classic momentum equation: current inventory x rate of inventory change. In other words, having a large inventory isn&#39;t a problem. But when the inventory rate increases, the combined momentum creates a major headache. And when you&#39;re talking about billions of dollars in electronic components that have an expiration date driven by technology transitions, the headache is expensive.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Once they understood their inventory momentum, the leadership team took five key actions to reduce excess inventory, stem the rate of inventory change, and prevent the situation from happening in the future:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;They reduced incoming materials.&lt;/strong>; Instead of ordering all components in advance, the company only ordered the components needed to make finished goods in the short term. The procurement teams delayed orders for components that would not be immediately used in manufacturing.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;They set more accurate planning parameters.&lt;/strong>; Investing in real-time systems provided stakeholders with information on how much inventory they had across all factories and suppliers&#39; books. This data allowed the company to simulate changes to inventory levels when planning parameters like lead time, safety stock levels, and minimum order quantities.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;They disposed of excess and obsolete inventory. &lt;/strong>;The company collaborated with suppliers and distributors to find alternative customers for stranded components.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;They collaborated with their customers. &lt;/strong>;Leaders worked out agreements with customers that if orders changed, the company wouldn&#39;t get stuck with excess components — and arranged working capital advances to get paid in advance for critical materials. Customers could optimize their consumption of excess components by modifying product lifecycles or working with suppliers to design alternative applications.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;They prioritized revenue for customers. &lt;/strong>;By prioritizing customers with a backlog of large orders, they maximized customer revenues by building the mix of products where components were already on hand.&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;The results: The company reduced the total inventory number by more than 10% in just a few short weeks and reduced inventory momentum.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Creating a More Sustainable Inventory Ecosystem&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;This real-world example isn&#39;t an outlier — it&#39;s the canary in the coal mine. The liability of excess inventory affects every business in the value chain. To create a more sustainable environment, every business needs to start thinking differently about the burden of excess inventory.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To start, leaders must reconsider the narrative of “infinite” demand. Every demand spike will eventually end in an inventory glut. It&#39;s up to the companies placing orders to temper that demand with a dose of reality.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If suppliers maximize revenues and OEMs order more than what they can reasonably sell, contract manufactures get stuck in the middle. That dynamic isn&#39;t healthy or sustainable. Value chain partners like OEMs, contract manufacturers, and suppliers need to be aligned on optimizing inventory. Suppliers should be able to redistribute excess components that are still perfectly useful for another application. Getting products into the hands of people who need them is ultimately good for everyone.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Finally, as new industries emerge, prioritize creating healthy ecosystems from the start. The growing realm of AI represents a major opportunity for high-tech manufacturers — but it&#39;s also an opportunity to build a healthy ecosystem. To do so, we can&#39;t assume an “infinite” demand for AI-powered applications. The same is true of the electric vehicle industry. If the ecosystem over-produces parts for EVs, there&#39;s a high risk those parts will be outdated or unusable by the time demand eventually materializes.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Inventory management is a critical problem that should be on the radar of anyone in an industry with volatile demand and long lead times. And it requires a careful, collective solution. No single company stands alone. Instead, we&#39;d all be well served to consider the broader business ecosystem, making decisions that will serve our bottom lines and the health of all the companies connected to us.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;em>;Acknowledgments: The author would like to thank Ben T.

But that&amp;#8217;s not the only reason they struggle during downturns, according to new research &amp;#8212; they also have a tougher time hiring. That&amp;#8217;s because job seekers prefer safer options and so are more likely to apply for jobs at incumbent firms. This, alongside the difficulty fundraising, makes growth even tougher for startups during recessions.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/research-in-recessions-employees-avoid-jobs-with-startups?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/research-in-recessions-employees-avoid-jobs-with-startups?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;Startups are an important catalyst for innovation and economic growth. Yet these important firms are also more sensitive to economic fluctuations than their more established counterparts. While the vulnerability of startups to economic downturns has been &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w21776/w21776.pdf&quot;>;well documented&lt;/a>;, the reason for this vulnerability is not entirely understood.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Conventional wisdom suggests that startups are vulnerable to recessions&amp;nbsp;because they struggle to secure financing during such times. However, the Covid-19 downturn upended this narrative. Venture capital funding &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ey.com/en_us/growth/venture-capital-continues-to-exhibit-immunity-to-the-covid-19-pandemic#:~:text=The%20numbers%20we%20are%20seeing,over%20the%20past%20four%20years.&quot;>;surged in 2020 and 2021&lt;/a>;, contrary to expectations. That raises the possibility that funding isn&#39;t the only factor that makes recessions so hard for startups.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We sought to shed new light on how employees choose between startups and established firms, which are increasingly competing for the same talent. Understanding employee preferences and how they change with economic conditions is critical to understanding incumbent-vs.-new-entrant dynamics. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=59035&quot;>;Our research&lt;/a>; offers an alternative hypothesis rooted in the labor market: Startups find it challenging to attract talent during downturns due to job seekers&#39; inclination toward larger, more established firms.&lt;strong>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Testing this hypothesis is tricky. If startups hire less during a downturn, is that because workers are reluctant to join them, or because startups are reluctant to add workers to their payrolls?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To specifically detect changes in workers&#39; interest in startups, we partnered with AngelList Talent, the leading job-recruitment platform for entrepreneurial firms. Through this partnership, we were able to look at changes in job search and application behaviors during the most recent recession: the Covid downturn. Our findings reveal a “flight to safety” among job seekers. During the downturn, they increasingly directed their searches and applications to larger, more established organizations. Notably, higher-quality candidates, measured by experience or education, were particularly inclined to shift away from startups.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This shift had a tangible impact on firms. Less-established startups received fewer job applications, particularly from high-quality candidates, leading to a decline in the talent pool available to them. This decline happened even within the same job vacancy over time. That means it&#39;s not just that startups demand less labor during recessions — even for existing job postings, hiring got harder. While startups faced challenges in filling their job vacancies, more established firms benefited from this shift in job seeker interest, experiencing greater success in attracting talent.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What drives the flight to safety by workers? There are two possible explanations. First, workers may become more risk-averse across the board during recessions, amplifying their desire for job security. Second, workers could change their view of how risky different employers are. Our findings point more toward the former, because both growing, successful startups and less-successful ones saw a decline in applicants. That&#39;s more consistent with an across-the-board decline in risk tolerance, rather than a reassessment of how risky specific employers are. (Because if that were the case, the struggling startups would presumably take a bigger hit than the more successful ones.) Thus, our results are more consistent with the idea that increased risk-aversion drives job seekers away from all startups — regardless of their quality.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One might question whether these findings are applicable beyond the unique circumstances of the Covid downturn, which may have been more extreme than other downturns. However, we show that the magnitude of the decline in economic expectations during that time period aligns closely with declines observed in past recessions. Moreover, we conducted rigorous tests to rule out Covid-specific factors that might explain our results, such as a shift in job-seeker preferences toward employers who could offer remote work or strict health protocols.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It has long been recognized that startups grapple with financial constraints during periods of economic turbulence. The Covid recession was unusual in that most recessions lead to less venture capital funding, not more. Our research adds a new dimension to this understanding by highlighting that human capital — another vital resource for startups — also comes under significant strain during downturns, leading to a “double whammy.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Historically, policy interventions have been primarily geared toward alleviating financial pressures on startups but have ignored the talent crunch they face. This talent crunch poses a considerable risk, potentially undermining a startup&#39;s ability to survive and compete against larger, established firms. As we navigate through economic uncertainties, a more nuanced understanding of these forces is essential for both policymakers and entrepreneurs.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 29 Sep 2023 22:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Creating a Cohesive Team for Corporate Transformation Projects]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/09/creating-a-cohesive-team-for-corporate-transformation-projects]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/09/Sep23_29_2509341.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;Juan Moyano/Getty Images&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;Hollywood films have long been made by teams of independent contractors and employees of different production companies brought together for short-term projects. Companies have embraced this model for transformations, with data showing that 45% of the people on these projects are not regular employees. Managing a disparate group like this can be a challenge, but team leaders can overcome that by working to create one culture, making work personal, and empowering the team leader.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/creating-a-cohesive-team-for-corporate-transformation-projects?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/creating-a-cohesive-team-for-corporate-transformation-projects?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;The screenwriters&#39; strike that began last May, and the actors&#39; strike that followed in July, highlighted an employment model that has given Hollywood a highly flexible workforce for decades: The vast majority of people on a set are not studio employees but independent contractors or employees of other firms. Take, for example, the people who worked on this year&#39;s Oscar winner for best picture, &lt;em>;Everything Everywhere All at Once.&lt;/em>; In addition to the 42 actors; the 49 artists, set dressers, and painters; and the hundreds more who provided art, music, transportation, writing and editing, costumes, casting, sound, and stunts, the rest of the crew came from six production companies, three special-effects firms, and 28 other organizations.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This model has begun to extend far beyond Hollywood. Our research shows, for example, that in early 2020, on average, employees made up only 62% of the teams responsible for transformation initiatives at 404 global technology, financial services, health care, and life sciences companies with at least $1 billion in revenue. The rest came from staffing or consulting firms or were independent contractors. By the fall of 2022, with nearly three years of the pandemic having put companies into transformation overdrive, those numbers were 55% employees and 45% non-employees.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Judging from a study of 1,005 companies we did in the spring of 2023, we predict that the average number of employees on corporate transformation teams will fall below 50% by 2030, for four reasons:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;By using outsiders, companies can acquire key skills on demand and escape hefty severance costs down the road.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;They can tap the pool of freelance talent that grows with every mass layoff and forced retirement.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Many of these hires can work from home, which creates a global talent market.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;And companies can avoid employee burnout — a big issue today.&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;The Pandemic and Project Overload&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Over the past three years, the Covid-19 pandemic has propelled mission-critical corporate transformations, such as reorienting supply chains suffering from acute component shortages, installing new financial systems to track revenue and expenses faster and more accurately, and restructuring business processes for data cleanliness. The resulting pressure on full-time employees — and sometimes the absence of key knowledge internally — forced companies to hire outsiders with valuable and hard-to-find skills. “E-commerce, digital data security, data privacy—those are all new for us,” the comptroller for the Asia-Pacific region of a US-based luxury goods company told our researchers. “Local statutory requirements are getting more complex, as well as countries&#39; political issues. No one organization will know it all.” And large global companies that are running dozens of initiatives at once may have too few internal project leaders to go around.&lt;/p>; &lt;article-promo>; &lt;hbr-component type=&quot;promo&quot; is-insight=&quot;insight-center&quot; title=&quot;The Future of Work&quot; dek=&quot;Will your company adapt or be left behind?&quot; cta-text=&quot;&quot; href=&quot;/insight-center/the-future-of-work&quot;>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/insight-center/the-future-of-work&quot; style=&quot;color:black;text-decoration:none&quot;>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; Insight Center Collection &lt;/div>; &lt;h3>;The Future of Work&lt;/h3>; &lt;div>; Will your company adapt or be left behind? &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hbr-component>; &lt;/article-promo>; &lt;p>;Successfully staffing and running transformation initiatives with the right mix of insiders and outsiders requires what we call a “dynamic workforce model.” Unlike a static model, which assigns only employees to a critical project team or outsources the work altogether, the dynamic version puts insiders and outsiders on an equal footing. Our study found that the best executors of these initiatives, which were 15% of the 404 companies surveyed, were far more likely to use a dynamic workforce model than the worst executors (24% of the survey base). The best executors&#39; companies also substantially outperformed the worst executors financially, with an 63% average increase in market capitalization between 2017 and the fall of 2022, compared with an average 24% decline for the worst companies.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But this model also presents steep challenges, including creating a cohesive team culture, building trust among people who don&#39;t know one another, and empowering leaders to keep things on track. Project sponsors and project leaders must address those challenges to succeed.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Creating a One-Culture Team&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;When a company fields its own team to run a big transformation initiative, or brings in a consulting firm to execute it, everyone on the team is well versed in the organization&#39;s values and beliefs, the behaviors that are permissible, and who are the powerful internal “players.” But if the team includes outsiders, they are like tourists in a strange land. They can&#39;t be expected to understand the full context of the initiative the way insiders do, no matter how well they&#39;ve been briefed. A thorough onboarding — one that informs team members of both the project mechanics and the company culture as well as project steps, roles, deliverables, and tools — will convey the values, beliefs, and behaviors of the company.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The gene therapy firm Asklepios BioPharmaceutical Inc. (AskBio) gets this. Acquired by Bayer in 2020, AskBio has a number of promising therapeutics in development, including for Parkinson&#39;s disease and congestive heart failure. “It&#39;s super important to create a unified team culture,” said Guru Ramamurthy, chief financial offer at the 800-employee firm based in Research Triangle Park, NC, and CFO of Bayer&#39;s US business. Tapping contractors and consultants has been an important component of rapidly scaling up its infrastructure and capabilities. “Maintaining momentum is critical to execution,” Ramamurthy says, especially since the Bayer buyout. But during a time of rapid growth and change, hiring employees to fill key team roles can be time-intensive and may prove unsuccessful. It can take about three months to discover that a new employee isn&#39;t a good fit, and retraining a replacement can take from six to nine months. Meanwhile, demands and focus may change, altering role requirements. Supplementing with outside experts offers greater operational flexibility and agility.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since the pandemic began, anywhere from 15% to 30% of AskBio&#39;s project team members have been external, depending on the initiative. “A key area of success is how well we blend our employees with the experts we get from various vendors,” Ramamurthy says. He believes that contractors and consultants, particularly those who work remotely, must be treated as equally valued team members. AskBio provides them with access to information and company tools to enable communication across blended teams.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Once an AskBio initiative has been completed, external team members often ask about company job openings. When Ramamurthy hears this, he knows they didn&#39;t feel like outsiders on their teams. “This is the kind of project experience you want to give every contributor,” he says.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Making the Work Personal, Not Transactional&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;On a team composed of employees from one company, the members have a chance to know one another personally — their lives outside the job, their passions, their families, their ups and down at work. But outsiders on a team don&#39;t have that experience. And as more people are hired from outside a company, insiders may detach emotionally from the work, especially if they are involved in several critical initiatives. “It&#39;s easy to see people just as numbers or resources,” a chemical company&#39;s chief strategy officer explained.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Remote team members have an even harder time establishing strong personal relationships. A finance executive at a multibillion-dollar medical-products manufacturer told us how difficult it was to manage remote team members — especially when they aren&#39;t employees, but even when they come from other business units. “We find trust, understanding, and engagement are sometimes missing with them,” he said.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Building trust among transformation team members is crucial to success. Consider, for example, a project manager who must promise anonymity to a team member who points out a mistake that needs correcting. “You have to empower people to speak up,” the finance executive said. And strong commitment to the well-being of a hard-to-replace team member may be necessary to pull that person through a bad patch in the life of a transformation initiative. The executive told us that his company&#39;s project leaders are encouraged to make personal visits when relationships with team members appear strained.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;An Asia-Pacific regional comptroller watched her Shanghai team members get caught in pandemic lockdowns after 2020. Several times she arranged grocery deliveries to their homes and access to mental and physical health resources. “You can&#39;t expect the usual high performance under those conditions,” she told our researchers. Project leaders must use empathy in such cases to motivate teams. The company&#39;s projects — of which she was juggling 19 — have been long, making it hard to keep team members motivated and focused. Awarding bonuses and other recognition for good work has helped, she said.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Empowering the Project Leader&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Among the companies we studied, the best at executing critical transformations had better project leaders than the worst and were more likely to give those leaders the authority to decide what skills were needed on their team and who had them. Some 85% allowed those leaders to replace team members when necessary, whether from inside or outside, whereas only 70% of the worst gave project managers the same authority.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The medical-products company executive told us that empowering project managers increases the chances that they&#39;ll stay with the organization. “Having strong project leaders gives an organization a large competitive advantage,” he said. “There are always projects to be done. If you don&#39;t have a strong project capability, you cannot keep up with your peers.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At a time when companies must move faster to stay competitive, bringing in outsiders for key roles in transformation initiatives has become a reality. But insiders and outsiders must be managed as one effective, cohesive, motivated, and collegial team. Movie producers and directors know how to do this. Companies in industries that are a long way from Hollywood must follow suit.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 29 Sep 2023 21:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Eliminating Algorithmic Bias Is Just the Beginning of Equitable AI]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/09/eliminating-algorithmic-bias-is-just-the-beginning-of-equitable-ai]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/09/Sep23_29_n4KewLKFOZw.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;HBR Staff/Imansyah Muhamad Putera/Unsplash&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;When it comes to artificial intelligence and inequality, algorithmic bias rightly receives a lot of attention. But it&amp;#8217;s just one way that AI can lead to inequitable outcomes. To truly create equitable AI, we need to consider three forces through which it might make society more or less equal: technological forces, supply-side forces, and demand-side forces. The last of these is particularly underemphasized. The use of AI in a product can change how much customers value it &amp;#8212; for example, patients who put less stock in an algorithmic diagnosis &amp;#8212; which in turn can affect how that product is used and how those working alongside it are compensated.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/eliminating-algorithmic-bias-is-just-the-beginning-of-equitable-ai?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/eliminating-algorithmic-bias-is-just-the-beginning-of-equitable-ai?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;From automating mundane tasks to pioneering breakthroughs in healthcare, artificial intelligence is revolutionizing the way we live and work, promising immense potential for productivity gains and innovation. Yet, it has become increasingly apparent that the promises of AI aren&#39;t distributed equally — it risks exacerbating social and economic disparities, particularly across demographic characteristics such as race.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Business and government leaders are being called on to ensure the benefits of AI-driven advancements are accessible to all. Yet it seems that for each passing day there is some new way in which AI creates inequality, resulting in a reactive patchwork of solutions — or often no response at all. If we want to effectively address AI-driven inequality, we will need a proactive, holistic approach.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If policymakers and business leaders hope to make AI more equitable, they should start by recognizing three forces through which AI can increase inequality. We recommend a straightforward, macro-level framework that encompasses these three forces but centers the intricate &lt;em>;social mechanisms&lt;/em>; through which AI creates and perpetuates inequality. This framework boasts dual benefits. First, its versatility ensures applicability across diverse contexts, from manufacturing to healthcare to art. Second, it illuminates the often-overlooked, interdependent ways AI alters demand for goods and services, a significant pathway by which AI propagates inequality.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Our framework consists of three interdependent forces through which AI creates inequality: technological forces, supply-side forces, and demand-side forces.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Technological forces: Algorithmic bias&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Algorithmic bias occurs when algorithms make decisions that systematically disadvantage certain groups of people. It can have disastrous consequences when applied to key areas such as healthcare, criminal justice, and credit scoring. Scientists investigating a widely used healthcare algorithm &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aax2342&quot;>;found that it severely underestimated the needs of Black patients&lt;/a>;, leading to significantly less care. This is not just unfair, but profoundly harmful. Algorithmic bias often occurs because certain populations are underrepresented in the data used to train AI algorithms or because pre-existing societal prejudices are baked into the data itself.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;While minimizing algorithmic bias is an important piece of the puzzle, unfortunately it is not sufficient for ensuring equitable outcomes. Complex social processes and market forces lurk beneath the surface, giving rise to a landscape of winners and losers that cannot be explained by algorithmic bias alone. To fully understand this uneven landscape, we need to understand how AI shapes the supply and demand for goods and services in ways that perpetuate and even create inequality.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Supply-side forces: Automation and augmentation&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;AI often lowers the costs of supplying certain goods and services by automating and augmenting human labor. As research by economists like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/pandp.20181019&quot;>;Erik Brynjolfsson&lt;/a>; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://openai.com/research/gpts-are-gpts&quot;>;Daniel Rock&lt;/a>; reveals, some jobs are more likely to be automated or augmented by AI than others. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.brookings.edu/articles/race-and-jobs-at-risk-of-being-automated-in-the-age-of-covid-19/&quot;>;telling analysis&lt;/a>; by the Brookings Institution found that “Black and Hispanic workers … are over-represented in jobs with a high risk of being eliminated or significantly changed by automation.” This isn&#39;t because the algorithms involved are biased, but because some jobs consist of tasks that are easier (or more financially lucrative) to automate such that investment in AI is a strategic advantage. But because people of color are often concentrated in those very jobs, automation and augmentation of work through AI and digital transformations more broadly has the potential to create inequality along demographic lines.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Demand-side forces: Audience (e)valuations&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;The integration of AI in professions, products, or services can affect how people value them. In short, AI alters demand-side dynamics, too.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Suppose you discover your doctor uses AI tools for diagnosis or treatment. Would that influence your decision to see them? If so, you are not alone. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2023/02/22/60-of-americans-would-be-uncomfortable-with-provider-relying-on-ai-in-their-own-health-care/&quot;>;recent poll&lt;/a>; found that 60% of US adults would be uncomfortable with their healthcare provider relying on AI to treat and diagnose diseases. In economic terms, they may have lower demand for services that incorporate AI.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Why AI-augmentation can lower demand&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Our recent research sheds light on why AI-augmentation can lower demand for a variety of goods and services. We found that people often perceive the value and expertise of professionals to be lower when they advertise AI-augmented services. This penalty for AI-augmentation occurred for services as diverse as coding, graphic design, and copyediting.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, we also found that people are divided in their perceptions of AI-augmented labor. In the survey we conducted, 41% of respondents were what we call “AI Alarmists” — people who expressed reservations and concerns about AI&#39;s role in the workplace. Meanwhile, 31% were “AI Advocates,” who wholeheartedly champion the integration of AI in the labor force. The remaining 28% were “AI Agnostics,” those who sit on the fence, recognizing both potential benefits and pitfalls. This diversity of views underlines the absence of a clear, unified mental model on the value of AI-augmented labor. While these results are based on a relatively small online survey, and do not capture how all of society views AI, they do point to distinct differences between individuals&#39; social (e)valuations of the uses &lt;em>;and&lt;/em>; users of AI. and how this informs their demand for goods and services — which is at the heart of what we plan to explore in further studies.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;How demand-side factors perpetuate inequality&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Despite its significance, this perspective — how audiences perceive and value AI-augmented labor — is often glossed over in the broader dialogue about AI and inequality. This demand-side analysis is an important part of understanding the winners and losers of AI, and how it can perpetuate inequality.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;That&#39;s especially true in cases where peoples&#39; perceived value of AI intersects with bias against marginalized groups. For example, the expertise of professionals from dominant groups is typically assumed, while equally qualified professionals from traditionally marginalized groups often face skepticism about their expertise. In the example above, people are skeptical of doctors&#39; relying on AI — but that distrust may not play out in the same ways across professionals with varying backgrounds. Doctors from marginalized backgrounds, who already face skepticism from patients, are likely to bear the brunt of this loss of confidence caused by AI.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;While efforts are already underway to address &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ajl.org/library/research&quot;>;algorithmic bias&lt;/a>; as well as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://workofthefuture.mit.edu/research-post/artificial-intelligence-and-the-future-of-work/&quot;>;effects of automation and augmentation&lt;/a>;, it is less clear how to address audience&#39;s biased valuations of historically disadvantaged groups. But there&#39;s hope.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Aligning social and market forces for an equitable AI future&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;To truly foster an equitable AI future, we must recognize, understand, and address all three forces. These forces, while distinct, are tightly intertwined, and fluctuations in one reverberate throughout the others.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To see how this plays out, consider a scenario where a doctor refrains from using AI tools to avoid alienating patients, even if the technology improves healthcare delivery. This reluctance not only affects the doctor and their practice but deprives their patients of AI&#39;s potential advantages such as early detection during cancer screenings. And if this doctor serves diverse communities this might also result in exacerbating the underrepresentation of those communities and their health factors in AI training datasets. Consequently, the AI tools become less attuned to the specific needs of these communities, perpetuating a cycle of disparity. In this way, a detrimental feedback loop can take shape.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The metaphor of a tripod is apt: a deficiency in just one leg directly impacts the stability of the entire structure, which impacts the ability to adjust angles and perspectives, and inevitably its value to its users.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To prevent the negative feedback loop described above, we would do well to look to frameworks that enable us to develop mental models of AI-augmented labor that promote equitable gains. For example, platforms that provide AI-generated products and services need to educate buyers on AI-augmentation and the unique skills required for working effectively with AI tools. One essential component is to emphasize that AI augments, rather than supplants, human expertise.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Though rectifying algorithmic biases and mitigating the effects of automation are indispensable, they are not enough. To usher in an era where the adoption of AI acts as a lifting &lt;em>;and&lt;/em>; equalizing force, collaboration between stakeholders will be key. Industries, governments, and scholars must come together through thought partnerships and leadership to forge new strategies that prioritize human-centric and equitable gains from AI. Embracing such initiatives will ensure a smoother, more inclusive, and stable transition into our AI-augmented future.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 29 Sep 2023 20:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Video Quick Take: SAP&rsquo;s David Hamilton on Disruption, Growth, and the Role of Technology in Midsize Companies - SPONSOR CONTENT FROM SAP]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/sponsored/2023/09/video-quick-take-saps-david-hamilton-on-disruption-growth-and-the-role-of-technology-in-midsize-companies]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;html>; &lt;head>;&lt;/head>; &lt;body>; &lt;p>;&lt;b>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/b>;&lt;/p>; &lt;div>; &lt;div data-props=&quot;{&amp;quot;name&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;6337163374112&amp;quot;}&quot; js-target=&quot;video-player-page&quot;>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>;&lt;/div>; &lt;div>;&lt;/div>; &lt;div>;&lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;span>;Loading... &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;script src=&quot;//players.brightcove.net/2071817190001/default_default/index.min.js&quot;>;&lt;/script>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Todd Pruzan, HBR&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Welcome to the HBR Video Quick Take. I&#39;m Todd Pruzan, senior editor for research and special projects at Harvard Business Review. Over the last few years, midsize companies have made huge leaps in adopting technology to survive, enabling their employees to work remotely, switching to online stores, improving supply chain visibility, and offering online learning.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Today, we&#39;re talking about that with David Hamilton, senior vice president and chief marketing officer at SAP Concur and chief marketing and solutions officer at SAP Midmarket. David, thanks for being with us.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;David Hamilton, SAP&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Thank you for having me.&lt;/p>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div id=&quot;DFP_IC_pos3&quot;>; &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;>;if (isAdobeSync()) googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(&quot;DFP_IC_pos3&quot;); });&lt;/script>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Todd Pruzan, HBR&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;David, how did technology play a role for companies to survive all these recent disruptions?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;David Hamilton, SAP&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It&#39;s been really tough. These have been challenging times. IDC Research, commissioned by SAP, showed midsize companies that have completed or [are] in advanced stages of digital transformation were much more successful in continuing to drive growth in revenue and market share. And they were able to positively navigate the pandemic.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These leaders have adopted technologies that may have seemed available only to large enterprises in the past. For instance, one example is, of those leading companies, 92% of them have adopted or plan to adopt an ERP system.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Todd Pruzan, HBR&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ninety-two percent—that&#39;s pretty impressive. David, as you said, many of these technologies only seemed appropriate for the big guys in the past. So what&#39;s changed?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;David Hamilton, SAP&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div id=&quot;DFP_IC_pos4&quot;>; &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;>;if (isAdobeSync()) googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(&quot;DFP_IC_pos4&quot;); });&lt;/script>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;It is really interesting. I think what we&#39;ve seen is this democratization for these midsize companies. And it&#39;s the ability to consume technology through the cloud that&#39;s at the heart of that because the cloud allows companies of all sizes to adopt advanced tech functionality without having to invest in servers or expand their IT departments.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For instance, companies can benefit from technology with embedded AI and machine learning without having to be experts. It&#39;s a real-time value-add, since software continually gets more intelligent. Also, companies that have higher adoption of cloud technology, because it&#39;s pushed directly to employees, can immediately use it.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Todd Pruzan, HBR&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Well, that makes sense. David, how does technology support growth?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;David Hamilton, SAP&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Well, technology supports growth in many different ways. It can provide connections across the business. It can help automate repetitive tasks, which helps teams to be more efficient, freeing them to focus on projects that drive business value. Technology can provide increased visibility across the business and give you scale to align with company growth. Technology could also help with flexibility and agility. You can seize opportunities in new markets without having to worry about compliance, or respond to new customer demands and innovative products, and deal with supply chain disruptions more quickly. It is at the core of growth opportunities for companies of all sizes.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Todd Pruzan, HBR&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;OK, so what do you recommend midsize companies do to take the next step to be ready for growth?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;David Hamilton, SAP&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first thing I really recommend is companies do an internal review of their biggest pain points. Perhaps it&#39;s the ability to manage employees remotely or improve supply chain diversification—it could be many different things—and based on this, make the right technology decisions to support these pain points.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For instance, one of the first things to consider is likely a core ERP solution that can serve as the foundation for growth and help address a number of pain points. An ERP solution can give visibility across the business, reducing the data needed to make decisions, automate processes, and reduce costs.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Todd Pruzan, HBR&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;OK, well, that&#39;s a great overview. David, thank you so much for a great conversation, for all of your insights today.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;David Hamilton, SAP&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Thank you so much for having me.&lt;/p>; &lt;hr>; &lt;p>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ad.doubleclick.net/ddm/trackclk/N69702.124507HBRHARVARDBUSINESSR/B29173838.376677450;dc_trk_aid=567330240;dc_trk_cid=189409904;dc_lat=;dc_rdid=;tag_for_child_directed_treatment=;tfua=;ltd=;dc_tdv=1&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Learn more.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/a>;&lt;/p>; &lt;hr>; &lt;p>;&lt;em>;&lt;strong>;David Hamilton is the senior vice president and chief marketing officer at SAP Concur and chief marketing and solutions officer at SAP Midmarket.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>; &lt;/body>; &lt;/html>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 29 Sep 2023 04:25:01 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[How to Be a Better Leader Amid Volatility, Uncertainty, Complexity, and Ambiguity]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/09/how-to-be-a-better-leader-amid-volatility-uncertainty-complexity-and-ambiguity]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/09/Sep23_28_sb10063113cd-001.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;ColorBlind Images/Getty Images&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;More than three decades ago, the US Army War College developed a framework for understanding how leaders succeed during times of volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity. The framework, known as VUCA, has been widely discussed and adopted since, but it turns out to be better at describing &lt;em>;what&lt;/em>; successful leaders do than teaching all leaders &lt;em>;how&lt;/em>; to succeed. The authors present an updated approach that has generated positive outcomes in military, business, and sports contexts.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/how-to-be-a-better-leader-amid-volatility-uncertainty-complexity-and-ambiguity?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/how-to-be-a-better-leader-amid-volatility-uncertainty-complexity-and-ambiguity?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;Your environment is changing fast. You lack the data to make confident decisions. Your operations sprawl with processes. You&#39;re spotting trends that could be good — or not.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These are the four challenges of volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity. They&#39;re the reality of business today. But they&#39;re &lt;a href=&quot;/1992/11/is-management-still-a-science&quot;>;not new. &lt;/a>;They&#39;re intrinsic to markets, sales, manufacturing — and life in general. So why do some organizations respond better? How do they succeed when others struggle or even surrender?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the late 1980s, after the fall of the Soviet Union triggered a spike in global instability, the US Army War College set out to find answers. They developed the concept of VUCA, an acronym for volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity. And they determined that leaders who did best in VUCA had the capacity to create and communicate a story of the future, a story broad enough to adapt to changing circumstance, yet accurate enough to &lt;a href=&quot;https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/beyond-forecasting-creating-new-strategic-narratives&quot;>;yield competitive advantage&lt;/a>;. They called this skill “vision.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the wake of the 2008 global financial crisis, &lt;em>;Harvard Business Review&lt;/em>; published &lt;a href=&quot;/2010/11/leading-in-a-vuca-environment&quot;>;a four-part series&lt;/a>; on VUCA that detailed the core characteristics of visionary leadership: flexibility, collaboration, foresight, active listening, clear communication. Since then, the War College&#39;s theory has become a standard resource for modern business in times of uncertain change.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But in the 2010s Army researchers inventoried VUCA and discovered that the War College&#39;s theory was better at describing leaders than at producing them. It explained &lt;em>;what&lt;/em>; good leaders did in VUCA, but didn&#39;t explain &lt;em>;how&lt;/em>; to cultivate those behaviors in less successful leaders.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To fill that gap, we (the authors of this article) returned to VUCA. Two of us have decades of experience training military commanders and frontline leaders; the third is an expert in the brain science of creating and communicating plans and other narratives. Working with US Army Special Operations, we developed a suite of new techniques for training the brain to initiate effective plans and strategies in murky and fast-changing environments. We tested these techniques outside the Army in professional sports (such as the NFL) and in business (from Fortune 15s such as Cardinal Health to billion-dollar tech firms such as Faire). And we synthesized our findings into a method that the US Army has formally recognized with a Commendation Medal for “groundbreaking research.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Here&#39;s that method, starting with what psychologists refer to as a mindset shift.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Decision-Making Doesn&#39;t Always Improve with More Data&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;When life is stable and transparent, more data leads to better decisions. But when life turns choppy or murky, data gets fragile and elusive. More data is not an option — and to seek it produces passivity, mission creep, and hesitation.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The key to intelligent leadership in VUCA is low-data decision making. Low-data decision making is impossible for computers, which is why volatility causes AI to become brittle and prone to catastrophic error. But low-data decision making is an inherent power of the brain, which evolved to thrive in unpredictable environments.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To activate that power, target “exceptional information.” Exceptional information is an exception to an existing rule. It&#39;s the initial sign of an emergent threat or opportunity, like when the mainframe engineer Steve Wozniak saw the Altair 8800 microcomputer at the first meeting of the Homebrew Computer Club on March 5, 1975. Other mainframe engineers dismissed the Altair as too small to be useful. But in the Altair&#39;s unusual smallness, Wozniak glimpsed a new story of the future: a world where computers were used to work and play games at home. He dashed back to his own home and engineered the Apple I.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you think you can&#39;t spot exceptional information unless you&#39;re as brilliant as Wozniak, think again. You did it as a child, when unusual cracks on the sidewalk and unique clouds in the sky prompted your brain to imagine: &lt;em>;What if?&lt;/em>; To return to that earlier mindset, exit your adult brain&#39;s bias toward abstract reasoning. Focus instead on identifying what&#39;s unique about every person you meet and every place you visit — like how a company accountant spends his evenings studying Nigerian poetry, or how a local chef blends two spices like nobody else. You&#39;ll know you&#39;re picking up on the exceptional if you find yourself experiencing that childlike power to dream new tomorrows, imagining what could happen next.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;New Leadership Techniques&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Now that you have shifted your mindset, here are three techniques for training yourself to lead better in VUCA.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;&lt;strong>;Don&#39;t&amp;nbsp;Rely on Active Listening.&amp;nbsp;Do Use the New Science of Active Questioning.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Active listening is a venerable business method, defined in the 1950s by Carl Rogers and Richard Farson, that can be effective when there is low urgency and high transparency. But in VUCA, you will increase your effectiveness by employing active questioning.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Active questioning surfaces exceptional information via a simple technique: Delay asking &lt;em>;Why&lt;/em>;. When we ask &lt;em>;Why&lt;/em>;, the brain seeks answers in existing rules and prior judgments, which dismiss or explain away the new and unexpected. Instead prioritize &lt;em>;What&lt;/em>;, &lt;em>;Who&lt;/em>;, &lt;em>;When&lt;/em>;, &lt;em>;Where, How — &lt;/em>;focusing on answers that trigger surprise. That surprise is an indicator of exceptions that press the brain to develop new rules and judgments. The more of those exceptions that can be gathered and held simultaneously in view, the more effectively a leader can imagine new futures.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We recently worked with a Fortune 50 finance company that since 2019 had been losing a growing slice of its junior talent. To understand what was happening, HR asked the leavers, “Why are you going to our competitors?,” and they responded, “Money.” So the company upped its retention offers — but continued to lose talent.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To help the company respond more effectively to this emergent challenge, we trained its HR staff to delay asking &lt;em>;Why &lt;/em>;and instead engage junior talent with questions like: &lt;em>;What&lt;/em>; do you do on your weekends? &lt;em>;Who &lt;/em>;do you do it with? &lt;em>;Where &lt;/em>;do you go on vacation? From these questions, HR determined that the company&#39;s junior talent suffered from a variety of sources of low life-satisfaction. Money wasn&#39;t the deep reason for their discontent; it was just a surrogate explanation, used to communicate their sense that something was missing and to rationalize why they wanted to explore outside career options.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;By using active questioning to identify what was actually missing from its younger employees&#39; lives, the company became substantially more effective at retaining talent. One junior exec was unhappy because they and their partner were struggling to conceive a child. The company paid for fertility treatments — then hosted a baby shower.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;&lt;strong>;Don&#39;t Optimize the Plan. Do Optimize the Planner. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;In 1957, US President Dwight Eisenhower gave a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-national-defense-executive-reserve-conference&quot;>;speech&lt;/a>; in which he recalled spending his early days at the Army Staff College planning for wars that never happened. It was a waste of time, he said — except that it wasn&#39;t, because the process trained him and his colleagues to be ready for anything. “The reason it is so important to plan,” he told his audience, is “to keep yourselves steeped in the character of the problem that you may one day be called upon to solve.” In other words, as he put it famously in that speech, “Plans are worthless, but planning is everything.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Not long ago, we worked with a $100m sales company that had an unusually high percentage of senior managers who did not successfully transition to leadership. We embedded with them and discovered that they believed a key to leadership was developing the optimum plan. Their senior managers brainstormed every likely challenge or opportunity, crunched the probabilities, and developed a grand strategy. Just in case something unexpected occurred, they also made a Plan B. Yet despite having plans for every probable contingency, they were continually caught flat-footed. Their optimum plans broke again and again, as did their Plan Bs — at which point they lost confidence in their leadership, prompting their teams to lose confidence too.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These managers set themselves up for failure by trusting in Plan B. In VUCA, Plan B isn&#39;t anything other than a variation on Plan A. Both are based upon the same underlying methods and assumptions, so if one fails, the other often follows.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To help the senior managers transition into leadership, we trained them to push beyond Plan B and generate a whole set of plans that encompassed not just the most probable contingencies but all possible contingencies, with a particular emphasis on the extreme and unprecedented. The goal of this process was not to make better plans. It was to make better planners, who reacted dynamically when their plans failed by planning again. As assessed by the company&#39;s internal metrics, this approach more than doubled the rate at which senior managers transitioned into leaders.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Don&#39;t Dissociate from Fear and Anger. Do Use Emotion Reset. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Fear and anger are popularly characterized as negative emotions. Leaders are taught to suppress or bypass them via mindfulness, meditation, pop-Stoicism, and other dissociative techniques. But although fear and anger may lead to negative behaviors, they arise, like all emotions, for positive reasons — notably, to signal the onset of a flight-or-fight response. That response is triggered when your nervous system detects environmental volatility and other indicators of VUCA.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you ignore or suppress fear and anger, you deprive yourself of a warning system, tuned through millions of years of biological evolution, for alerting you when you&#39;re under threat and need to switch on your leadership vision.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;That warning system isn&#39;t perfect. But you can improve it. The next time you feel fear or anger, recall in detail a time when you dealt successfully with a similar situation, reminding your brain, &lt;em>;You&#39;ve done this before&lt;/em>;. We call this technique “emotion reset.” It allows you to quickly evaluate whether your flight-and-fight is tuned to your environment. If your fear and anger calm when you perform emotion reset, then your flight-or-flight response is an overreaction. You&#39;re imagining more VUCA than is actually present, so the best course of action is to stick with your existing plans and keep gathering data. But if your fear and anger remain constant when you perform emotion reset, then the VUCA is real, and your circumstances are urgent. Respond energetically to match that urgency by re-planning fast and acting decisively.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We worked on this with an NFL quarterback prospect who improvised too much during games. To rein in his behavior, his coaches drilled him on sticking to the gameplan. This stopped him from improvising but negatively affected his performance, turning him into a robot who lost his feel for the game.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To help him keep improvising without overdoing it, we studied his game tape. We noticed that his improvisation rate increased after failed plays, suggesting it was often driven by overactive fight-or-flight. To allow him to better assess the reliability of his fight-or-flight response, we worked with him on emotion reset. From game tape, we highlighted examples of when he had successfully executed planned plays and we had him mentally review these occasions, over and over, seeing them in detail. This primed the memories in his brain for fast recall. Then we had him create a “trigger,” a memento he associated with those memories. He took the trigger into his next game and looked at it after every bad play, remembering &lt;em>;I&#39;ve done this before&lt;/em>;. By resetting his emotions, he kept himself from getting unnecessarily anxious or aggressive, sticking more consistently to the coaches&#39; game plan. And by not forcing himself to stick robotically to that plan, he retained his ability to improvise in VUCA, leading his team by inventing fresh plans when needed.&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;* * *&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tomorrow is full of fog and volatility. Markets, supply chains, technology, and consumer trends are hazy and transforming. But you can lead your organization to succeed. The Army&#39;s original theory of VUCA defined visionary leadership. And now, using what we&#39;ve laid out in this article, you have a Special Operations method for cultivating it in yourself — and your future teams.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 28 Sep 2023 23:25:02 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
