&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div >; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/how-to-have-a-successful-meeting-with-your-bosss-boss?language=es&quot;>;阅读西班牙语&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href= &quot;/2023/09/how-to-have-a-successful-meeting-with-your-bosss-boss?language=pt&quot;>;葡萄牙语&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot; font-weight: 400;&quot;>;您对经理的经理有多了解？在没有老板在场的情况下，你和他们一起度过了多少时间？如果您像我共事的大多数专业人士一样，那么这两个问题的答案可能都是“很少”。然而，向上管理并不仅仅限于影响你的顶头上司。它还要求您与指挥链上层的领导者建立关系，包括与您的“大经理”或“大老板”。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400; &quot;>;与上级建立联系的最有效方法之一是通过越级会议。简而言之，越级会议是您和老板的老板之间的一对一会议。这是一个与您可能没有经常接触或互动的上级直接沟通的机会。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot; >;虽然您可能认为这种做法仅适用于初级员工，但您升得越高、走得越远，越级就越有价值&lt;/span>;&lt;a href=&quot;/2023/06/how-to-advance-your -career-when-your-company-is-downsizing&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;职业生涯的进步&lt;/span>;&lt;/a>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>; ”>;。随着职责范围和行动的影响变得更加广泛，跨级不仅可以确保您有效地履行自己的职责，而且可以保持一致、知情且日益引人注目。那是因为它们允许您：&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot; aria-level=&quot;1&quot;>;&lt;b>;获得更广阔的视角。&lt;/b>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;直接与经理的经理互动有助于您与公司更广泛的战略方向和宣传保持一致与高层重视的项目和举措产生共鸣。&lt;/span>;&lt;/li>; &lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot; aria-level=&quot;1&quot;>;&lt;b>;建立社会资本。 &lt;/b>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;与老板的老板建立融洽的关系奠定了信任的基础，在变化、过渡和不确定的时期，信任的价值是无价的。&lt;/span>; &lt;/li>; &lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot; aria-level=&quot;1&quot;>;&lt;b>;加强宣传。 &lt;/b>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;这些会议提供了一个展示成就的平台，&lt;/span>;&lt;a href=&quot;/2023/08/making-the-case-for-the- resources-your-team-needs&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;请求您团队所需的资源&lt;/span>;&lt;/a>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;,并为自己的进一步成长做好准备。&lt;/span>;&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;以下是如何设置、持有和利用向上跳跃-为了您自己以及整个组织的利益进行级别对话。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;b>;考虑您的文化。&lt;/b>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot; >;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;对于我指导的许多专业人士来说，仅仅想到与他们的越级经理直接互动就可能是彻头彻尾的想法令人生畏的。 &lt;/span>;&lt;a href=&quot;/2021/05/stop-being-so-hard-on-yourself&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;自我怀疑蔓延&lt;/span>;&lt; /a>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>; 他们担心浪费高级领导的时间或被认为“太努力了”。这些担忧都是有道理的。处理与经理的经理的关系需要微妙的平衡。越界，你可能会被视为绕过了你的直接主管。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;所以请小心行事。在您安排越级之前，请考虑您的工作场所文化以及人们如何看待此类请求。它会受到欢迎——还是被视为威胁？一些公司鼓励开放式沟通，而另一些公司可能有更多的等级结构。反思过去的互动和&lt;/span>;&lt;a href=&quot;/2023/07/overcoming-your-fear-of-giving-tough-feedback&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;反馈&lt;/ span>;&lt;/a>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>; 来自您的主管。他们之前是否鼓励您采取主动，或者是否建议您采取更加谨慎的做法？这可以深入了解他们如何看待您的请求。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;b>;让您的老板参与进来。&lt;/b>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400; &quot;>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;如果您确实继续，透明度是关键。选择一个您和您的直接主管可以进行坦诚对话的私人时间。解释为什么您认为越级会议对您和整个团队都有好处。也许可以分享它将如何帮助您做出明智的决策，减少来回的次数，或避免最后一刻出现意外而占用宝贵的时间和资源。强调你的目的不是要削弱或绕过你的经理，而是要增强你自己的理解以及与组织的一致性。您的老板会很高兴了解您请求背后的动机。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;向您的老板提出诸如“您建议我如何最大限度地利用时间？”之类的问题。 ”或“您认为有哪些具体主题适合我介绍？”表明您尊重他们的专业知识，并将该请求视为一项协作努力。如果你的老板表示保留或建议等待更合适的时机，请倾听。他们可能对职场政治有你不知道的见解。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;b>;定义你的目标。&lt;/b>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;高管们很忙，你最不想做的就是毫无准备地不尊重越级的时间。因此，请提前定义您的目标。澄清期望？列出你目前的理解并请求肯定或更正。寻求指导？概述您面临的具体挑战或机遇、您倾向于的解决方案，并询问他们过去如何处理类似情况。呈现信息？分享清晰、简洁的摘要，并根据高管的兴趣定制数据，重点关注影响和结果。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;b>;准备有力的问题。&lt;/b>;&lt;span style=&quot; font-weight: 400;&quot;>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;无论您想从对话中得到什么，您的主要工作是听。遵循 70/30 规则：你的目标是在 30% 的时间里发言，同时允许你老板的老板在 70% 的时间里发言。通过更多地倾听，您可以利用他们的经验和见解，并且可以更轻松地发现不明显的细微差别。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;另外，您的沟通必须简洁且有目的。你的演讲时间更多地是关于提出正确的问题——展示你的战略思维并获得清晰度的问题。例如：&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot; aria-level=&quot;1&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;从您的角度来看，您认为我们团队应该解决的最重大挑战是什么？&lt;/span>;&lt;/li>; &lt;li样式=“字体粗细：400；” aria-level=&quot;1&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;根据公司的长期战略，您认为我们团队的角色将如何演变？&lt;/span>;&lt;/li>; &lt;li style=&quot;字体粗细：400；” aria-level=&quot;1&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;根据您的观察，我如何在自己的角色中成长，以更好地支持我们的直属团队和更大的组织？&lt;/span>;&lt; /li>; &lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot; aria-level=&quot;1&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;市场有哪些趋势或变化值得我们关注或学习？&lt;/span>;&lt;/li>; &lt;li style =&quot;字体粗细：400；&quot; aria-level=&quot;1&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;当您展望我们公司未来五年或十年时，您希望我们实现哪些关键里程碑？&lt;/span>; &lt;/li>; &lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot; aria-level=&quot;1&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;鉴于我们行业面临的挑战，是什么让您保持乐观？&lt;/span>;&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;h2>;&lt;b >;建立关系。&lt;/b>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;与任何人（尤其是您经理的经理）建立真诚、有意义的关系就是始终如一地表现出尊重、诚信、主动。一点点的感谢会有很大的帮助，所以在会议结束后一定要发送一封后续电子邮件，感谢你的越级老板抽出时间。您还可以总结关键要点或分享您计划如何根据他们的指导采取行动。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;问责制很重要。如果你说过你会回过头来讨论某个观点或问题，那就兑现你的承诺并表明你是可靠的。还可以考虑要求召开季度会议并尽快将其列入日历。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>;花时间和精力投资向上的关系，例如与越级经理的关系，需要策略、谦逊和勤奋。毕竟，领导力不仅在于管理下属，还在于应对上面的复杂性。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- 引用 -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;br>;&lt; hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot;

&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/6-actions-ceos-must-take-during-a-cyberattack?language=es&quot;>;阅读 zh西班牙语&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/6-actions-ceos-must-take-during-a-cyberattack?language=pt&quot;>;葡萄牙语&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;2021 年 5 月 7 日，一个致命的星期五早晨，为美国东部运营重要燃料供应管道的 Colonial Pipeline 公司遭遇了勒索软件攻击。政府不知道的是，该公司决定关闭管道运营，因为他们试图确定发生了什么以及损失有多严重。此举产生了严重后果，在短短几天内将网络事件转变为更广泛的危机。数千个加油站&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/05/12/gas-shortage-colonial-pipeline-live-updates/&quot;>;燃料耗尽&lt;/a>; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/05/12/gas-shortage-colonial-pipeline-live-updates/&quot;>;天然气价格&lt;/a>;升至近来最高水平十年。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;运营的停止扰乱了燃料供应链，导致多个州的加油站出现恐慌性购买和随后的短缺。有关加油站排长队和价格飞涨的报道说明了网络威胁对现实世界的影响，强调了我们的物理和数字基础设施的相互依赖。这也加剧了公众对加油站的挤兑。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;针对不断升级的局势，美国政府&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/ 2021/05/11/情况说明书-拜登哈里斯政府已启动全政府努力解决殖民管道事件/&quot;>;采取了一系列果断行动&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;为了平息公众的反应，国土安全部部长亚历杭德罗·N·马约卡斯 (Alejandro N. Mayorkas) 和能源部长詹妮弗·格兰霍姆 (Jennifer Granholm) 于 5 月 11 日在白宫讲台上向美国公众发表讲话，2021 年。新闻发布室是西翼的一个小房间，里面挤满了大约 50 名记者，电视摄像机在后面运行。媒体聚集在这里，通过提出当天最重要问题的尖锐问题，让美国政府对美国公众负责——形成了一个强大的舞台，基本上全世界都在关注。两位国务卿概述了政府正在采取的行动减轻勒索软件攻击的影响。他们还&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/press-briefings/2021/05/11/press-briefing-by-press-secretary-jen-psaki-secretary-of-energy -jennifer-granholm-and-secretary-of-homeland-security-alejandro-mayorkas-may-11-2021/&quot;>;呼吁美国公众“没有理由囤积汽油，特别是在考虑到这一点的情况下”事实上，该管道应在本周末和周末之前基本投入运行。”&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;持久影响&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;殖民地管道勒索软件攻击的地缘政治影响是深远的。在此之后，拜登总统&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/07/09/readout-of-president-joseph-r-biden-jr-call -with-president-vladimir-putin-of- Russia-2/&quot;>;与俄罗斯总统弗拉基米尔·普京直接接触&lt;/a>;，强调了事件的严重性。这场危机还强调了迫切需要&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dhs.gov/news/2021/07/20/dhs-announces-new-cybersecurity-requirements-ritic-pipeline-owners-and-operators ”更强大的&lt;/a>;网络安全措施，特别是对于像殖民地管道这样的关键基础设施。它清楚地提醒我们，网络威胁并不局限于数字世界；网络威胁也不仅仅存在于数字世界。它们会迅速蔓延，造成广泛的破坏和社会影响。最终，殖民管道事件是一个分水岭。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这一事件至今仍在产生连锁反应，重新定义了首席执行官和行业领导者所扮演的角色，并将塑造我们对未来几年网络安全的看法。它还指出了企业领导人需要问自己的一些重要问题，并强调网络事件如何迅速升级为需要美国总统关注的国家安全危机。试想一下，如果 2022 年 2 月下旬或 3 月初，即俄罗斯军队进一步入侵乌克兰几天后，美国再次发生同样具有影响力的勒索软件攻击，会发生什么。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;其中一个连锁反应是首席执行官们的态度思考他们的角色和责任。殖民地管道公司首席执行官约瑟夫·布朗特&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cbsnews.com/news/colonial-pipeline-ceo-ransomware-hackers-senate-hearing/&quot;>;告诉&lt;/a>;国会议员支付大约 430 万美元的比特币作为赎金是“我在能源行业 39 年来做出的最艰难的决定”。是否向黑客支付费用并进一步加剧赎金要求的犯罪循环或&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.securitymagazine.com/articles/93062-ransomware-vicitim-travelex-forced-into-bankruptcy&quot;>;风险&lt;/ a>; 严重破坏甚至破产是不可能的选择。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;首席执行官们显然已经注意到了。很少有人会喜欢从卡诺莎到华盛顿的道路，并成为国会和媒体的焦点。我们从这起事件以及过去两年的其他重大事件中学到了什么？以下是给首席执行官的六项建议：&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;1.小心与公众沟通的方式。 &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;银行挤兑是公众反应和群体心理导致危机恶化的典型例子。 Covid-19 大流行期间的厕纸抢购事件和勒索软件攻击后的加油站抢购事件凸显出这个问题不仅限于金融机构。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;小心与公众沟通的方式和内容。并不意味着避免与公众沟通；相反，这是一种必然。然而，公司需要采取深思熟虑的方法。正如殖民地管道事件所表明的那样，这包括那些很少需要在日常运营中与公众接触的公司，但可能需要日复一日地与公众接触。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>; 2.与政府协调。&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;殖民地管道公司关闭其管道系统的决定需要尽快做出，但可以说有足够的时间咨询美国政府专家。关闭管道系统意味着，无论是否受到感染，都需要数天时间才能重新启动，从而扰乱实际的燃料供应，其所有后果都需要政府采取行动。与政府的协调是避免危机无意中恶化的关键。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;3.知道该联系谁。&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;为了快速做出明智的决策并与合适的人协调，首席执行官需要知道政府中谁是正确的联系人。正如多年来的一些轶事所表明的那样，联系北约或军方并不是正确的答案。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;话虽如此，有时政府并不能让外部各方轻松识别适当的个人或机构，因此政府有责任提供清晰度。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;4.制定一个计划并执行它。&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;这可能是最关键的一点，因为它提供了实现其他目标的工具。除了制定和制定计划（最好由首席执行官监督）之外，该计划还应该每年至少实施一次。定期的桌面练习将帮助公司领导层和员工建立在真正的危机中有效应对所需的“肌肉记忆”。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;5.了解您的网络。&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;理想情况下，首席执行官应该对公司的业务 IT 网络和运营技术 (OT) 网络如何交互有深入的了解。如果系统是气隙的，如果危害仅限于 IT 网络，则无需关闭 OT 网络。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;话虽如此，针对 Colonial Pipeline 的勒索软件攻击已经证明，即使瘫痪业务 IT 网络的变化可能会产生重大影响。如果一家公司无法再开具发票，不知道其客户是谁，也不知道如何联系他们，那么实际影响可能与实际停止生产一样具有破坏性。对于因航空公司 IT 系统&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-airports-systems-idUSKBN18Q10R&quot;>;停机&lt;/a而滞留在机场的读者>;，您亲身经历了破坏性影响。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;6.保持谦虚并寻求专家帮助。&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;网络安全是一个广泛的术语，涵盖高度复杂的问题集。虽然存在共性，并且一些软件跨部门使用，但管道的网络安全与金融部门、医院、学校或铁路的网络安全有很大不同。经过多年跨行业的网络事件，一个重要的见解是承认每个人的知识的局限性，包括网络安全专家的知识。因此，首席执行官应该毫不犹豫地向公司外部寻求帮助，以帮助制定、测试或完善计划或审查现有流程和政策。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;除了这些高级建议之外，还有大量其他资源，包括针对 CEO、董事会成员和 CISO 的更详细的&lt;a href=&quot;https://carnegieendowment.org/specialprojects/fincyber/guides&quot;>;指南和清单&lt;/a>;。美国政府，即网络安全和基础设施安全局 (CISA)，还提供 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cisa.gov/stopransomware&quot;>;Stopransomware.gov&lt;/a>; 和 &lt;a href=&quot;https: //www.cisa.gov/shields-up&quot;>;Shields Up&lt;/a>; 是专为公司设计的资源，可根据其网络安全成熟度水平使用。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;商业领袖作为信任的守护者&lt;/h2 >; &lt;p>;除了出于自身利益和避免国家安全危机而加强公司的网络安全之外，企业领导人还发挥着更大的作用，可以被视为整体技术信任的守护者。从根本上来说，网络安全围绕着信任。勒索软件和许多其他网络攻击都利用了这种信任。他们利用某人点击不可信链接、从未知电子邮件地址下载附件或接收恶意软件更新的情况。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这一原则延伸到公司对其系统底层技术的信任，从而引发地缘政治回到讨论中。中国企业在 5G 网络中的作用多年来一直是一个中心话题。它标志着关于在投资、购买和使用技术时如何考虑风险的更广泛辩论的开始。美国政府对来自中华人民共和国的某些技术的担忧&lt;a href=&quot;https://2017-2021.state.gov/5g-security/index.html&quot;>;众所周知&lt;/a>;。与此同时，在布鲁塞尔和其他欧洲国家首都，一场关于“去风险、 ” 受到俄罗斯入侵乌克兰和欧洲依赖的教训的影响。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;商界领袖处于这场辩论的中心，因为他们是技术信任最重要的守护者。科技公司决定投资什么，以及如何权衡成本与其他收益（例如更高的安全性和信任度）将决定整个社会的整体弹性。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;首席执行官的自我检查&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;多年来，许多人&lt;a href=&quot;/2018/08/corporate-cybersecurity-is-becoming-geopolitical-are-us-tech-companies-ready&quot;>;警告&lt;/a>;网络威胁日益严重，有些人&lt; a href=&quot;/2023/04/cyber-risk-is-forming-heres-how-companies-can-keep-up&quot;>;就如何加强组织的保护和复原力提供了&lt;/a>;深思熟虑的建议。三个问题可以帮助确定是否已采取足够的措施来补充上述建议：&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;您最近参加过网络桌面演习吗？&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;您是否有您的联系信息？首席信息安全官是否保存在工作电话或计算机以外的其他地方？ （请记住，如果您公司的网络遭受勒索软件攻击，您的工作设备可能无法访问。）&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;您知道在发生网络安全事件时您在政府中的联系人吗？&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul >; &lt;p>;如果以上任何一个问题的答案都是“否”，那么阅读本文有望激发一些后续行动 - 它将有助于更好地保护您的组织，并可能防止未来的国家安全危机。&lt;/p>; &lt; !-- 引文 -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 18 Sep 2023 22:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Research: Consumers&rsquo;

&lt;p>;我们研究信任，通过涉及 30 个行业 500 多个品牌的数十万消费者和员工的研究，我们测量了信任信任的力量可以推动一系列积极的行为。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;信任的员工会更有动力工作，缺勤率较低，并且不太可能寻找另一份工作。信任的客户更有可能选择某个品牌（而不是竞争对手）、再次购买并进行推广。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;高度信任的公司在市场价值方面比其他公司高出 400%。这些惊人的回报之所以能实现，是因为随着公司赢得信任，公司股票的信任边际效应就会增加。我们的 TrustID 平台&lt;a href=&quot;/2022/11/4-questions-to-measure-and-boost-customer-trust&quot;>;用于衡量公司信任度&lt;/a>;，显示当公司的得分从 30 移动到9 月 31 日，预期股票回报率增加约 3%。当分数从 60 攀升至 61 时，增幅为 6%。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;2.可持续发展可以促进信任，尤其是年轻一代的信任。&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;由于信任的回报如此之高，组织面临的一个明显问题是：是什么创造了对品牌的信任？我们的研究表明，可持续性是一个强大的驱动力。要理解其中的原因，您首先必须了解信任从何而来。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;其核心信任是在品牌或组织做出良好承诺并兑现承诺时建立的。他们分别通过传达积极的意图和展示能力来做到这一点。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我们对超过 350,000 名 18 岁至 98 岁的美国客户进行了调查，衡量他们对品牌意图和能力的看法。我们使用衡量信任的四个因素中的两个因素的综合得分来衡量意图：品牌感知的人性（同理心、善良、公平）和透明度（以简单语言分享动机和相关信息的开放性）。我们结合剩下的两个信任因素来衡量对品牌能力的看法：能力（产品质量）和可靠性（一致的交付）。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我们发现，可持续性不仅是一个关键驱动因素意图，但存在重要的代际效应。虽然年轻和年长的消费者都关心品牌的能力（质量和一致性），但年轻消费者对品牌的信任以及由此产生的购买行为更容易受到品牌积极意图的影响。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;考虑以下发现：当 Z 世代和千禧一代客户相信某个品牌关心其对人类和地球的影响时，他们购买该品牌的可能性比老一代高出 27%，这清楚地衡量了可持续发展推动该群体购买决策的力量.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;为了进一步放大，我们可以具体研究人性和透明度的影响，以及构成良好意图的信任因素。&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;当 Z 世代和千禧一代客户对一个品牌的人性评价很高，他们比老一代人更有可能在该品牌上花更多的钱并选择该品牌，而不是竞争对手。&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;当他们对透明度评价很高时，他们会比老一代人高出 30%比老一代人花更多钱的可能性高 %，选择它的可能性比竞争对手高 20%。&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;3.年轻一代很快将拥有美国大部分的购买力。&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;预测专家计算，到2030年左右，千禧一代和Z世代的购买力将超过婴儿潮一代，最多可达68万亿美元财富&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/21/what-the-68-trillion-great-wealth-transfer-means-for-advisors.html&quot;>;转移&lt; /a>; 到本十年末，从婴儿潮一代到年轻一代。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;要赢得这些年轻消费者的信任，很明显，您的品牌的可持续发展努力必须体现人性化和透明度：&lt;/p>; &lt; ul>; &lt;li>;为了突出&lt;em>;人性&lt;/em>;，表明您的组织重视并尊重每个人，无论身份、背景或信仰如何；尊重并照顾员工；并将社会和环境的利益置于纯粹的盈利之上。&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;为了强调透明度，&lt;/em>;确保消费者能够轻松找到有关您的品牌对社区和影响的直接信息。环境。&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;在这方面做得好的组织将会获得回报。以我们在杂货店的调查结果为例。 &lt;a href=&quot;https://corporate.publix.com/about-publix/company-overview/mission-statement-guarantee&quot;>;Publix&lt;/a>;，&lt;a href=&quot;https://corporate. publix.com/about-publix/company-overview/facts-figures&quot;>;美国销量最大的连锁超市&lt;/a>;，在我们的 TrustID 数据集中的 11 个同行杂货品牌的客户信任度中排名第一，具有人性化和透明度得分分别比第二名高出 75% 和 47%。这种差异对于 Z 世代和千禧一代客户来说更为明显，他们在 Publix 上的得分分别比排名第二的玩家高 83% 和 95%。因此，信任的客户从 Publix 购买的可能性比从竞争对手购买的可能性高出 54%。对于 Z 世代和千禧一代客户来说这一点更为明显，他们从 Publix 购买商品的可能性比从竞争对手购买的可能性高出 162%。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这种信任以及由此产生的客户忠诚度源自 Publix 对人员的可见投资和这个星球。例如，Publix 员工自动获得季度股票福利，并可以选择购买额外股票。这使得 Publix 成为全球最大的员工持股公司之一，拥有超过 20 万名员工，他们总共拥有公司约 80% 的股份。 Publix 还提供医疗和学费福利以及与公司匹配的退休计划，即使是兼职员工也是如此。员工会定期接受绩效评估和加薪。这些好处有助于解释为什么自愿离职率仅为 5%，而行业标准为 65%。难怪 Publix 是仅有的四家连续登上《财富》杂志“100 家最适宜工作公司”名单的公司之一 &lt;a href=&quot;https://corporate.publix.com/newsroom/news-stories/04042023 ---publix-named-on-fortunes-100-best-companies-to-work-for-list#:~:text=LAKELAND%2C%20Fla.%2C%20April%204,%20list 的%20inception%20in %201998.&quot;>;连续第 26 年&lt;/a>;。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在地球方面，Publix 积极投资减少食物浪费和促进保护。例如，&lt;a href=&quot;https://sustainability.publix.com/bakery/reducing-food-waste/&quot;>;2022 年&lt;/a>;该公司向农民发送了超过 5400 万磅的食物垃圾——制造副产品变成动物饲料。同年，其海鲜部门从聚苯乙烯容器改为可回收塑料手提袋，从而减少了 190,000 个容器的使用，而熟食部门则选择了更轻的塑料袋，并用餐具台取代了塑料包装的餐具套装。这些举措每年总共消除了超过 360,000 磅的塑料垃圾。 Publix 还以“GreenWise”标签创建了自己的可持续食品系列，展示了其对优质原料和严格动物福利标准的承诺。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;让 Publix 的经验成为一个教训：虽然转折点可能不会到来到 2030 年，各种类型的公司都应该在今天扩大其可持续发展工作和沟通，以在未来赢得信任和客户。&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- 引用 -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 18 Sep 2023 21:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[How to Address the Supply-Chain Staffing Crisis]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/09/how-to-address-the-supply-chain-staffing-crisis]]><description> &lt;div>;

&lt;span>;&lt;p>;全球技能短缺影响了企业的生产产出和服务交付。此外，由于劳动力成本的原因，生产材料、制造商品和提供服务的成本正在上升。对于中小型企业来说，这意味着利润可能会被挤压到无法在当今竞争异常激烈的全球市场中竞争的程度。人工智能、机器人技术、数字交易和相关自动化为中小企业提供了经济高效地增强和构建能力的手段。&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt; a href=&quot;/2023/09/how-to-address-the-supply-chain-staffing-crisis?language=es&quot;>;阅读西班牙语&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/ how-to-address-the-supply-chain-staffing-crisis?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;我们的全球供应链面临压力，不仅仅是因为材料短缺和运输延误，也是由于关键部门劳动力短缺造成的。现在，从采购到生产、物流以及商品和服务的交付，供应链连续体的各个环节都出现了技能短缺的情况。这些差距包括更多的手动任务（例如仓库订单拣选）到构建和维护供应链系统。现在的技术已经足够先进，可以填补由于技能短缺而造成的许多空白，但仅靠技术是无法做到这一点的。重建陷入困境的供应链需要将技术和人员技能发展战略相结合。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;招聘和留住合格的工人被认为是 2,000 名供应链高管在回应最近的&lt;a href=&quot;https ://www.mhi.org/publications/report&quot;>;供应链行业贸易协会 MHI 的调查&lt;/a>;。大多数人（57%）表示，雇用和留住合格工人是今年最大的挑战，56% 的人则面临持续的特定人才短缺问题。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一系列对供应链脆弱性敏感的行业都面临劳动力短缺问题根据 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.uschamber.com/workforce/understanding-americas-labor-shortage-the-most-impacted- Industries&quot;>;美国商会的分析&lt;/a>;。报告指出：“即使所有有耐用品制造业经验的失业人员都被雇用，该行业也只能填补约 75% 的空缺职位。”&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;敏感行业&lt;/strong >;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;受影响行业的高管和专家一致认为，解决技能短缺问题刻不容缓。经济逆风可能会削弱就业需求，但严峻的人员配置挑战仍将持续存在。人口老龄化和快速发展的技术技能差距等长期因素已成为人员配置的新常态。&lt;/p>; &lt;article-promo>; &lt;hbr-component type=&quot;promo&quot;

&lt;p>;制造业尤其代表了“供应链的矛尖”。 Joe Walden，堪萨斯大学供应链教授。 “劳动力短缺对这些人的打击最为严重。无论供应链其他环节的劳动力状况如何，这一层面的短缺都会影响消费者的产品供应。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在物流和配送领域，“劳动力短缺正在影响劳动力的流动”。阿里巴巴北美 B2B 供应链负责人 Yikun Shao 表示。 “物流领域人手不足可能会导致发货延误、港口装卸延误、卡车司机短缺和库存缺货、难以按时履行客户订单等各种挑战。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这反过来又对下游零售商和分销商产生不利影响。 UPS 旗下 Ware2Go 供应链主管凯尔顿·科西克 (Kelton Kosik) 表示：“高昂的劳动力成本加上对人才的持续需求，已经对商家及其履行流程造成了损害。” “尽管全球供应链的压力有所缓解，但在运输旺季（例如网络星期一和假日销售活动）期间缺乏人才以及制造、运输和交付产品的能力可能会导致经济通货紧缩或放缓。”&lt;/ p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;技术来拯救？&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;为了解决这些问题并实现许多技能要求的自动化，三菱重工的调查显示，公司正在加大技术投资。近四分之三的供应链高管（74%）正在增加对技术的投资。大多数人 (58%) 认为人工智能是他们当前的主要投资领域，另外 54% 的人希望通过工业物联网建立智能合作伙伴网络。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但是，部署人工智能有一个第 22 条军规：解决技能差距的技术——预先寻找构建和维护人工智能和物联网系统的技能。调查中的供应链高管将“缺乏足够的人才”视为实施人工智能或物联网等技术的主要障碍。 “具有讽刺意味的是，在实施创新技术时，人才既是障碍，也是受益者，”报告作者指出。 “虽然部署技术来自动化日常任务需要人才和人力，但一旦技术启动并运行，它就可以让员工专注于需要人类参与的更高价值的任务。”更高价值的任务可能包括与顾客或客户更密切地合作，或协调和监控商品或服务的流动。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;采取行动的时间&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p >;公司需要将技术与积极的技能开发工作相结合，以吸引和维持支持供应链所需的技能，以及管理技术以推动事物向前发展。奥多米尼恩大学海事、港口和物流研究所教授兼所长里卡多·翁戈表示，企业可以“通过将员工从重复性任务转移到当前技术无法胜任的角色来提高员工的生产力”。 “这是实现整个供应链数字化的必要步骤，提供了急需的可见性。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;以下行动可以帮助解决供应链内的技能短缺问题：&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;&lt;strong>;目标技术投资。&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;“中小型企业的资本投资能力可能更为有限，”Honeywell Intelligerated 总裁 Keith Fisher 表示。 “他们需要优先考虑具有明确投资回报的解决方案。例如，通过将自动化纳入其高周转率的业务部分，小型企业可能会看到对提高生产力的更大影响，从而获得更直接的投资回报。”&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;&lt;strong>;利用技术来弥补这一不足。适用于手动或重复性任务。&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;包罗万象的自动化方法对于需要扩大手动或重复性工作（例如配送操作）的组织特别有用。例如，机器人可用于在配送中心或仓库之间扫描、组装和移动零件和产品。机器人与自动存储和检索系统以及自动化系统一起，可以弥补许多体力要求较高的工作。”Walden 说道。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;此类应用程序“可显着减少配送中心工人的工作量，从而帮助提高配送中心工人的生产力”。从一个地点到另一个地点挑选产品所花费的时间，”Walden 补充道。 “从自动拣选到机器人托盘构建再到自动化包装的许多自动化概念最终都进入了配送中心，以弥补工人的短缺。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;此外，全面自动化“提供了整合的机会”自动化和机器人技术可以填补劳动力缺口并管理自动编带、标签应用和扫描等日常任务。”Kosik 说道。 “剩下的人才也可以专注于更紧迫的任务。公司可以利用人工智能进行更好的需求预测，以确保最有效地分配劳动力。”&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;&lt;strong>;利用技术来提高员工的工作效率。&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;核心的是，供应链永远不仅仅是交换信息和采购订单的自动化系统或算法。 “供应链是社交网络，”麻省理工学院工程系统教授 Yossi Sheffi 在他的《神奇传送带：供应链、人工智能和工作的未来》一书中写道。 “在供应链中做出决策时，例如管理异常或升级问题，公司人员与其客户和供应商之间的个人关系很重要。客户与供应商的关系可能很复杂，“有一个人际关系网”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;技术解决方案的目的应该是增强这些关系，并提高各级员工的生产力。&lt;/p>; &lt; p>;例如，“人工智能增强现实的使用可以雇用经验有限或没有经验的人，因为他们按照软件的指示执行某些任务，”谢菲举例道。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;另一种新兴用途人工智能填补技能短缺的一个例子是自动卡车运输。例如，由领头卡车中的人类驾驶员领导的“卡车排”由跟随领头卡车运动的电子连接卡车组成。 “许多公司正在投资开发 4 级自动驾驶技术，以在长途航线上运输货物，从而克服因厌恶长时间离家而导致的司机短缺问题，”Lungo 说。&lt;/p>; &lt; h3>;&lt;strong>;培训和发展员工管理现代供应链的技能&lt;/strong>;。&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;谢菲主张，组织应该将人才视为拥有自己的供应链。这旨在“提供人们获得和保留好工作所需的技能”，从雇主的角度来看，“确保公司拥有为客户生产负担得起且有价值的产品和服务所需的熟练人才。” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;对于中小型企业来说，培训至关重要。 “正确培训团队以理解技术的功能并有效地操作它至关重要，”费舍尔说。 “这不仅可以帮助他们更快地运用新技术，还可以提高采用率，并最终提高投资价值。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;近年来，新技术的数量增加了 15%三菱重工的调查发现，在投资技能提升和再培训计划的组织中，41% 的组织专注于让员工为新技术前沿的供应链工作做好准备，技能提升对于提供提高一线供应技能所需的教育和培训至关重要-连锁工作。报告称：“例如，目前使用 Microsoft Excel 的运营经理可以接受更复杂流程的培训，以使用新的运输和物流管理软件来集成供应链信息。”当今的供应链存在脆弱的联系——公司正在努力寻找和留住他们所需的工人，以保持货物和信息的流动。这是一个加大技术投资的机会，以尽可能实现生产、物流以及货物和服务交付工作的自动化。与此同时，仅靠技术无法承担所需的工作范围。雇主还需要加强技能获取和发展，帮助工人学习和使用技术来交付成果。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;技术可以“以无数种方式支持人类工人：培养新的能力和行为；提高运营绩效；提高安全性；三菱重工报告主张，支持更优化的工作与生活平衡。 “新的工作场所技术正在出现，它们不仅可以增强人类工人的能力并完成平凡的工作。相反，当有策略地使用时，它们有能力帮助个人和团队提高技能和重新技能他们的能力。”&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- 引用 -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 18 Sep 2023 21:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[How the Geeks Rewrote the Rules of Management]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/09/how-the-geeks-rewrote-the-rules-of-management]]><description> &lt;div>;

&lt;p>;极客的守护神可能是 &lt;a href=&quot;https://amshq.org/About- Montessori/History-of-Montessori/Who-Was-Maria-Montessori&quot;>;玛丽亚·蒙特梭利&lt;/a>;，大约100年前，她痴迷于如何最好地教育幼儿的问题，并提出了蒙特梭利教育方法，这与当时占主导地位的学校产业规模模式截然不同，遗憾的是现在仍然占主导地位。当你想到极客时，请想想玛丽亚·蒙特梭利。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS：&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;你如何定义你所谈论的“极客方式”书中？&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;安德鲁·麦卡菲：&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;让我感到兴奋的那些促使我写这本书的极客并不是玛丽亚·蒙特梭利这样的教育极客，他们是商业极客。他们是一群专注于（但不限于）美国西海岸的人，他们痴迷于这样的问题：“在一个技术变革非常快、充满不确定性的时代，我们如何经营一家公司？特别是，我们如何避免互联网时代的一些经典功能障碍？”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;他们想出了极客的方式。这是他们为了实现这个真正艰巨的目标而确定的商业模式、文化或一套规范。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS：&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这是一种对管理层感到厌烦的人，对吧？管理流程。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ANDREW MCAFEE：&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“痴迷特立独行”是我对极客的首选短语。我真正感兴趣的是那些痴迷的特立独行者，他们再次热衷于解决以下问题：“我们如何经营一家公司，并在我们的市场上保持良好的表现，并避免似乎困扰许多成功公司的功能障碍。”当他们变老变大时？我们如何避免这些功能障碍？我们如何做一些更高绩效、更可持续和更好的工作场所的事情？”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS：&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当我读这本书时，你谈到的一些属性，它们与速度有关，与实验有关。这只是数字化或应用业务设计思维的另一个术语吗？我们在这里谈论的是同一件事吗？&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ANDREW MCAFEE：&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;不，我不这么认为。阿迪，你还记得&lt;a href=&quot;https://variety.com/2023/digital/news/jeffrey-katzenberg-quibi-proud-to-own-failure-1235623036/&quot;>;Quib​​i&lt;/a>;，对吧，杰弗里·卡森伯格 (Jeffrey Katzenberg) 领导的视频初创公司？它将制作短片，并将改变我们消费娱乐的方式。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Quib​​i 完全是数字化的。这是一家完全数字化的企业。这是一次悲惨的失败。他们筹集了 17.5 亿美元。他们在推出后 200 天内就关闭了。这简直就是一场灾难。这是一家完全数字化的企业。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Netflix 是一家极客公司。他们遵循我的所有四个伟大的极客规范：科学、所有权、速度和开放性。我认为他们的结果不言自明。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;对我来说，极客与数字完全分开。你可以是一个非数字极客，而且你当然可以非常数字化但一点也不极客。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS：&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Quib​​i 的事情是一个有趣的例子。我想你的框架缺少的是开放性。你有一个成功的强大人物，但他没有倾听。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ANDREW MCAFEE：&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;没有倾听他的同行、同事的意见，给他的顾问。他似乎不是一个很好的倾听者，这是许多工业时代公司都会陷入的这种刻板陷阱。科技领导者也经常陷入这个陷阱。你变得迷恋自己的成功，而你真的不再倾听。这种情况非常普遍。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我对 Netflix 的里德·黑斯廷斯 (Reed Hastings) 这样的人充满力量且令我尊敬的事情之一是，他能够建立一家在他自己错误的情况下做出正确重要决策的企业。他们。在书中我谈到了其中的几个。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;他对于下载到 Netflix 应用程序的实用性的看法是完全错误的。他认为这根本没有什么用处。它非常有用。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;关于儿童节目对 Netflix 的重要性，他的看法是错误的。他在书中承认了这一点，&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/No-Rules-Netflix-Culture-Reinvention/dp/1984877860&quot;>;&lt;em>;没有规则&lt;/em>;&lt;/ a>; 他与 Erin Meyer 一起写的。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;他成功地努力建立了一家公司，这将纠正他，老板，组织高层的高地位和有声望的人。这是我所说的开放性极客规范的一部分。当组织结构图最高层的人犯错时，你如何建立一家能够正确行事的公司？伙计，这是一个难题。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS：&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这是一个难题。我确信有些人读了你的书后会想：“等等，我们谈论的很多公司都是硅谷初创公司或该领域的某个地方。”人们普遍认为这些文化不一定是你想要效仿的。他们通常是男性主导的兄弟文化。老板常常是一个要求过高的恶霸。您如何看待这一切？&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ANDREW MCAFEE：&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;硅谷显然正在发生一些事情。存在有毒文化。你提到了兄弟文化。我想说 &lt;a href=&quot;/2022/11/why-startups-should-embrace-radical-transparency&quot;>;Theranos&lt;/a>; 是我听过的最有毒的文化之一，它的总部就在在硅谷。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我认为那些根本不是极客公司。他们可能处于正确的地理位置，但他们没有遵循极客方式，即关于这些规范以及创建一种快速移动、自由流动、争论、自主、证据驱动和相当平等的文化。这就是极客方式的目标。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;现在你指出了一些我认为遵循极客方式的公司，但它们仍然过于苍白、陈旧和男性化。这绝对是真的。关于这一点，证据非常清楚。我希望随着时间的推移，情况会变得更好。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但是阿迪，你说了一些我不同意的话，即很多文化都不是工作的好地方。在某些情况下确实如此。还记得 LinkedIn 在 2016 年进行顶级吸引者调查时，他们说，看，我们只会考虑客观标准。我们将了解 LinkedIn 会员最常查看哪些公司页面。哪些公司最受 LinkedIn 会员的兴趣、最多的申请以及人们在找到第一份工作时会留在哪里？&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;LinkedIn 列表中排名前 11 的公司都是总部位于西海岸的公司在我们笼统称为科技的行业中。极客文化是一种极具吸引力的工作文化。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS：&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;其中一些创始人、企业家从事他们所从事的任何事情，因为他们想让世界变得更美好，Serge 和 Larry 在他们的车库里试图系统化我们对世界上所有信息的访问，这些伟大的理想：当他们真正经营公司时，他们不仅试图经营一家公司，而且他们成为杀手，想要消灭竞争，培育垄断行为，尽可能多地攫取市场份额。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ANDREW MCAFEE：&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;是有这个新的吗？企业内部？不，我认真的。以前时代的生意可爱吗？他们希望竞争对手成功吗？ Were they trying to rise all boats?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Capitalism is an inherently competitive process. These companies are very, very good performers. If you want to use the adjective “killer” for them, I think that&#39;s by design. You&#39;re not in business not to succeed. You want to grow your market share. You want to grow your profits, you want grow. That is often at the expense of somebody else.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I think it&#39;s for the courts to decide whether they meet the definition of monopolist. It&#39;s a word we toss around a lot. The courts so far have tossed out a lot of the recent lawsuits against some of these giant tech companies. I don&#39;t think they meet the definition of monopolist. In general, for a lot of these companies, the competition is one click away.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;And is Tesla a monopolist in the auto industry? You simply can&#39;t make that case. SpaceX has become pretty close to a monopolist in the rockets and satellites industry, but they didn&#39;t start that way, and they&#39;ve become so large and influential because they do the job better.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Let&#39;s talk about companies that are doing it right. This is not universally for digital companies. Some follow the geek way, as you&#39;ve laid it out, some don&#39;t.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;How many companies, large, small, digital, otherwise live into these principles, do you think?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ANDREW MCAFEE:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I think that&#39;s a really interesting question, and I don&#39;t have a great way to answer it yet. Because the only way that I can think to answer it is to administer a survey to everybody and get them to fill it out. That&#39;s just not going to work.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But you can look at what we know about the cultures at these companies. You can also look at the fantastic &lt;a href=&quot;https://sloanreview.mit.edu/projects/culture-500-introducing-the-2020-culture-champions/&quot;>;Culture 500 research that Don and Charlie Sull&lt;/a>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sloanreview.mit.edu/projects/culture-500-introducing-the-2020-culture-champions/&quot;>; did&lt;/a>;, published in a competitor magazine of yours, &lt;em>;Sloan Management Review&lt;/em>;. They grabbed all the LinkedIn reviews and put them through a machine-learning analysis to see what companies&#39; own employees said about them.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Three areas I was most interested in were execution, agility, and innovation. And wow, the scores for companies clustered on the West Coast, clustered in Silicon Valley, clustered in industries that we call high-tech, those scores are off the charts. There&#39;s not any real competition for them.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There&#39;s something brewing on the West Coast in industries that we label (for reasons that I don&#39;t like very much) high-tech. There&#39;s something brewing that&#39;s new, that is different than what&#39;s going on elsewhere in the economy, and it&#39;s pretty demonstrably powerful. The label that I hang on that is the geek way.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Was Steve Jobs a geek, and did his Apple follow the geek way or was that a different model?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ANDREW MCAFEE:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Jobs has some really classic non-geek characteristics. He believed that he knew best. He had a very, very large ego. He also screamed at his subordinates all the time, which I think is absolutely not what an open leader does.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, I interviewed Eric Schmidt for the book, and I brought this up to him and he said, “Look, I was on Apple&#39;s board for a while. I knew Steve pretty well.” He said Steve was a tough person in all those ways, but he learned that if you want to stay on top, you have to listen to the people around you. You have to stop thinking that you have all the answers.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We see a really clear example of that with the App Store. Jobs did not want to open up his beautiful, perfect walled garden iPhone to outside developers. He had to be talked into it. He eventually realized that he was wrong about that. There is a little bit of that openness going on.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One thing that Apple is pretty fanatic about, as I understand it, is they make decisions based on evidence. And whether or not that&#39;s a huge AB testing infrastructure is one thing. Apple loves to demo features, and gets everybody in the room to look at this and say, for example, is it better to have blurry portrait photos where you can adjust the blur before you take the picture? The instant they did a demo, they had the answer to that question. They did not sit around and argue from their different points of view. They said, OK, let&#39;s run an experiment. Let&#39;s do a demo here. That&#39;s an extremely geeky approach.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One of the interesting things about Jobs, and certainly something he would&#39;ve said about himself, he did say about himself, was that he didn&#39;t, and that one shouldn&#39;t, slavishly follow the focus groups. People don&#39;t know what they want.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It&#39;s a combination of let&#39;s get input, but there is a lot of personal touch, personal feel. It&#39;s like &lt;em>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Moneyball-Art-Winning-Unfair-Game/dp/0393324818&quot;>;Moneyball&lt;/a>;&lt;/em>; versus the old school. Maybe the answer is a combination of skills.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ANDREW MCAFEE:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Absolutely. And Ted Sarandos, who&#39;s the co-CEO of Netflix, says their decision-making is pretty algorithmic. It&#39;s 70-30 algorithmic versus human judgment. But he said, if anything, the human judgment is on top, if that makes any sense.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I think that makes a ton of sense. This norm of science that the geeks are pretty passionate about, it&#39;s not just dry analysis and do whatever the data says. That&#39;s an inaccurate caricature.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Science is about settling arguments with evidence. It&#39;s a ground rule for how you&#39;re going to come to a decision. You&#39;re going to do a test, you&#39;re going to do an experiment. You&#39;re going to sit around in a group and argue about it. And if you can&#39;t agree, evidence is going to settle this issue.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Science is this inherently, deeply social, deeply argumentative process with a ground rule. Evidence is the queen here. That&#39;s what we&#39;re going to follow. And a lot of the geek companies that I respect do that as naturally as breathing.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One of the examples in your book of geek culture triumphing is Microsoft, and specifically when &lt;a href=&quot;/2021/10/microsofts-satya-nadella-on-flexible-work-the-metaverse-and-the-power-of-empathy&quot;>;Satya Nadella&lt;/a>; came in and rekindled that early success and more. Talk a bit about what he got right, particularly in the framework that you&#39;ve created.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ANDREW MCAFEE:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Can you think of a more impressive corporate turnaround story in living memory?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;No. Microsoft went from the tech company we liked least to maybe the one we like best.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ANDREW MCAFEE:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;And if you were an investor, you really didn&#39;t like it for about a decade. The stock price was flat as a corpse&#39;s EKG. And then Nadella took over, and it&#39;s become one of the most valuable companies in the world. It&#39;s an astonishing comeback story.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I got to interview Nadella for the book. He&#39;d made brilliant strategic moves, a bunch of them. You have Microsoft embracing open source, wow.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But I was interested in the cultural changes that he made. And he did a couple things that I think are straight out of the geek playbook. Some of them are obvious. He embraced agile development methods as widely and quickly as possible inside Microsoft. He did a couple things to reduce the sclerotic bureaucracy that was in place at Microsoft, which was just hamstringing their ability to do anything important out there in the world.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One of the brilliant things he did was say, “Look, you cannot own a digital resource inside Microsoft. You cannot own the data. You cannot own the code.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;And what he meant by that was you can&#39;t be the gatekeeper. You can&#39;t say yes or no to other groups who might want to use it. With that one simple move, he said to the company, “Look, if the AI group wants to go grab all of the GitHub code to train up a model to help provide assistance to programmers, you don&#39;t have to ask permission. Just go do that, subject to all the right constraints and safeties on it.” Man, that is an astonishingly good bureaucracy-reduction mechanism.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Maybe the deepest thing that Nadella did was that he pulled off this amazing feat of helping Microsoft become a less defensive organization. What I mean by that was, he said in his interview with me, “We had a culture where it was not OK to be wrong, to show any weakness, to not hit your numbers, to not be the smartest person in the room.” He said, “We just had that culture and it had to change.” He did a number of really brilliant things to move from a culture of defensiveness to a culture of openness.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When I used to hear this word, “vulnerability”, in connection with leadership or business, I thought it was just a buzz phrase, hand wavy, nonsense business. The company is not a therapy group. It&#39;s not there so you can sit around feeling vulnerable all the time. I was just wrong.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Now, the company is not your therapy group. However, a successful company needs to be a place where it&#39;s okay to be wrong, to fail, to not have the answer, to show that you&#39;re uncertain. Nadella helped get Microsoft down that path, and it was an absolutely fundamental thing to do.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I also interviewed Yamini Rangan, who&#39;s the CEO of HubSpot here in Cambridge, who took over a culture and has strengthened it through a really difficult time through the pandemic.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She discussed one of the things she learned and that she was good at was saying in this unbelievably uncertain time of the pandemic where tech companies were shrinking. It was all weird. She said to a lot of her constituencies, “Look, I don&#39;t know. I don&#39;t know what the future holds here. I&#39;m going to be honest with you.” She also shared her board performance review with her direct reports, not just the good parts, but the stuff that she needs to work on too. These are all just great moves to start to show the rest of the organization it is okay not to be perfect, not to put on the brave front, not to be winning all of the time.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Jack Welch&#39;s autobiography was called &lt;em>;Winning&lt;/em>;, and it epitomized this industrial era view of what you have to do all day every day. I love the geek view, which is, “Hey, man, we&#39;re going to launch some rockets and they are going to blow up. Now, we&#39;re not going to kill anybody, but we&#39;re absolutely going to launch some rockets that are going to blow up on the launchpad.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Bezos said a few years back in the shareholder&#39;s letter, “We are incubating multi-billion dollar failures inside Amazon right now. That&#39;s appropriate for a company of our scale.” And you look at Alexa and I think maybe he was right about that.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But the point is that this obsession with winning and being on top and being right and being dominant, that has to go away.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I want to get to audience questions. One came from Shabana in Pakistan. What kinds of organizational design, organizational structures, do you need to foster this sort of geek culture?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ANDREW MCAFEE:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I don&#39;t think org structure is the key because the companies that I surveyed have very, very different org charts. They also have very different formal practices.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Netflix is fairly famous for having the no-vacation-days policy. Amazon has extremely strict vacation policies for different levels of employee.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I think it&#39;s not a matter of the org chart or the org structure that you have. It&#39;s not so much a matter of how formal a lot of your policies are. It&#39;s a matter of your norms. I love that word and I use it in the book all the time.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A norm is a behavior that the people around you expect. Maybe it&#39;s written down in the employee manual. Very often it&#39;s not. It&#39;s community policing. It&#39;s what the people around you expect. If you go out of line and violate a norm in a community, you will know that fairly quickly and you will either come back into line or you&#39;re just not going to stick around very long.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you can work on these norms of science, argue about evidence, of ownership, push authority and decision-making down to an uncomfortable degree, speed, iterate, don&#39;t plan, don&#39;t analyze, build stuff, get feedback, learn from reality and then openness. Don&#39;t be defensive. Be willing to pivot. Be willing to admit that you&#39;re wrong. They show a little vulnerability. Those are the norms that are critical for the geek way.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So Bob from our audience is asking, “Is the stack of books on your right your reading list for the week?”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ANDREW MCAFEE:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These are from all over the place. But there was a stack of books that I kept referring to when I was writing &lt;em>;The Geek Way&lt;/em>;, and they were not business books. I am sorry to admit this as a business book writer.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;They were books from this relatively new field called cultural evolution, which gets at this fundamental question, “Why are we the only species on the planet that builds spaceships?” Nothing else is even close. We&#39;re really the only ones out there. The octopuses are not going to do it. The ants, the bees, the chimpanzees are not going to do it. Why are we humans the only spaceship-building species on the planet? This field of cultural evolution to me has come up with the best answer to that question, which is we are the only species that cooperates intensely with large numbers of people that we&#39;re not related to. We are the species that learns the quickest, that improves its toolkit, its technologies, its cultures most rapidly over time.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;You can take that and put that to work in a company. A company is a large group of mostly unrelated people. And the goal of a company is to improve its culture, its artifacts, its technologies, its practices over time. The goal of a company is to practice very rapid cultural evolution. Now that we know a bit about how cultural evolution happens, we can put those insights to work.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There&#39;s this massive unexplored opportunity to take the insights from this field and put them to work inside the company. I think it&#39;s so massive because I haven&#39;t heard anybody talk using cultural evolution&#39;s terms inside even very geeky companies. This is very, very new stuff. And I think &lt;em>;The Geek Way&lt;/em>; is the first applied business book of cultural evolution.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I think I just figured something out. You&#39;re a total geek.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ANDREW MCAFEE:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We&#39;ve been working together for years. It took you this long to realize this?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But the thing that I got obsessed with was that in my career, I&#39;ve spent a lot of time in the (I hate these labels) old economy and the new economy, lots of industrial-era incumbents, and then a lot of companies clustered in the tech space, clustered on the West Coast.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For my whole career, I have been trying to pattern match and figure out what the deep differences are between the two. Is it the foosball tables? Is it the hoodies? Is it bringing your dog to work? No, obviously not.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Where the action is in the economy, where the excitement is in the economy, what are they doing differently? And &lt;em>;The Geek Way&lt;/em>; contains my answers to that kind of career long, geeky, head scratching question.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Let&#39;s get practical for our viewers who aren&#39;t in classically geeky cultures. How can they apply the approaches you&#39;re championing, at their own companies?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ANDREW MCAFEE:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Here are a few things you can start doing tomorrow that are extremely geeky practices that will get some traction. When you&#39;re in charge of your group or you&#39;re a team member or you&#39;re leading a team, if you say things like, “Oh, that&#39;s a good point. I hadn&#39;t thought of that. Let&#39;s go that way,” or, “Oh, I was wrong about that. That&#39;s really good to know,” you have just demonstrated openness and vulnerability instead of classic defensiveness.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;That&#39;s hard to do. Human beings are inherently defensive people, we don&#39;t like being shown to be wrong in public. It&#39;s deeply uncomfortable. But if you model that behavior, it will start to spread. And I&#39;ve seen geek leaders do that over and over.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;You can start to push decisions and responsibility down to a place that makes you uncomfortable, and to get out of saying, “Just run that by me first,” or, “Make sure I&#39;m included on that,” and try to get rid of the hard and soft bureaucracy that gets in the way.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I was talking to &lt;a href=&quot;http://robots.stanford.edu/&quot;>;Sebastian Thrun&lt;/a>;, who&#39;s an alpha geek in all kinds of things, and he said, “One of the things I try to get my teams to do is stop so much communicating.” He had this great image. He said, “A team works on something, and then they run it up the flagpole.” He said the really natural tendency is for the people at every layer of the org chart to add something to that because they want to be part of the solution, they want to be part of this winning idea. By the time that idea gets back down to the originating team, it&#39;s unrecognizable. Get out of that business.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Again, this is uncomfortable stuff to do, but it&#39;s a big step toward the geek way. And then finally, you can start to say, “How are we going to make this decision? Can we agree on what evidence we&#39;re going to look at to make this decision?”, as opposed to saying, “Well, I&#39;m the boss,” or, “I got it right last time, so you should listen to me this time,” all these other ways we have to make decisions, credentials, hierarchy, charisma, excellent PowerPoint, all these things: get out of that business and start asking for the consensus on, “How are we going to settle this argument? What evidence are we going to look at?” These are all super geeky practices you can start doing tomorrow.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ADI IGNATIUS:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Here&#39;s another audience question. This is Lori from North Carolina, and it&#39;s another very practical question: how can organizations get leaders to unlearn the idea that failure is bad?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;ANDREW MCAFEE:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is a super hard question, and I fall back on something that I learned from &lt;a href=&quot;/2020/01/the-essential-clayton-christensen-articles&quot;>;Clay Christensen&lt;/a>;: one of the things Clay taught me is that managers are voracious consumers of theory. He said, “Don&#39;t be afraid to tell them why this needs to change, what the principle, what the framework is.” And he said, “If you want to get people to change, there&#39;s a kind of a tripod. There are three things you have to do over and over again more until you&#39;re absolutely exhausted.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First of all, tell them a vivid story. We humans respond to narratives. Second, give them some evidence, give them some numbers to show that it works. And third, give them a theory. Explain why it works. You&#39;ve just got to go through all three of those legs.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Why can&#39;t we make decisions this way? I&#39;m a pretty smart person. I reached this place on the org chart because of my excellent judgment. What do you mean we should be relying a lot less on my judgment?” Again, three part answer to that question, keep iterating on it. It is not an easy process.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I think a lot of companies who get interested in what Silicon Valley does differently or might want to embrace the geek way are going to find it hard going because a lot of it is unnatural and uncomfortable.

Amidst rising skepticism and stricter disclosure requirements, a deeper dive reveals that traditional methods of influencing companies, namely &amp;#8220;voice&amp;#8221; (shareholder engagement) and &amp;#8220;exit&amp;#8221; (portfolio screening), are not exhaustive. Through a comprehensive review of over 3,500 research papers, a new approach &amp;#8212; &amp;#8220;field building&amp;#8221; &amp;#8212; emerges. This tactic acknowledges the interconnected web of stakeholders around companies, termed &amp;#8220;fields&amp;#8221;, that profoundly influence corporate behavior. By reshaping these fields, investors can indirectly drive sustainable change in firms. Five tactics are highlighted: (1) Shifting other investors&amp;#8217; evaluation of issues, (2) Sharing expertise, (3) Delegitimizing certain business activities, (4) Establishing voluntary standards, and (5) Supporting regulatory changes. While promising, field-building presents challenges like profitability and political exposure. Yet, by embracing this expanded toolkit, investors can magnify their positive impact and appeal to an increasingly conscious investment clientele.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/a-more-impactful-strategy-for-sustainable-investing?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/a-more-impactful-strategy-for-sustainable-investing?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;Whether sustainable investors can have a positive impact on business and society has been the center of debate in recent years. One major obstacle holding sustainable investing back from maximizing its impact is that most investors operate with too narrow of an understanding of how impact can come about. Most investors believe they have two primary ways to influence companies. First, there&#39;s portfolio screening, often termed “exit.” In this approach, investors shift capital from non-sustainable to sustainable companies. The second strategy is shareholder engagement, frequently called “voice.” Here, investors directly urge companies to adopt more sustainable practices through means like meetings, shareholder proposals, or voting.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But in our research, we have found that some unconventional investors go beyond the “exit” versus “voice” dichotomy. We have mapped their activities through a &lt;a href=&quot;https://eur03.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fonlinelibrary.wiley.com%2Fdoi%2Fepdf%2F10.1111%2Fjoms.12957&amp;amp;data=05%7C01%7Cmarti%40rsm.nl%7C5617faa4f4e6474822f608dbae59fdb1%7C715902d6f63e4b8d929b4bb170bad492%7C0%7C0%7C638295474207071901%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=qcr%2FaLPS2qF%2FkUPnG%2FDtSQEMQjLx0nl%2BrNN2UuL8oD8%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0&quot;>;systematic review of research&lt;/a>; for which we screened more than 3,500 research papers on sustainable investing. Based on this review and conversations we&#39;ve had with practitioners, we put forth a case for a third, potentially more impactful sustainable investing strategy: &lt;em>;field building.&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Field building works because companies are always embedded in fields. The term “fields” is closely related to industries, but broader. Fields encompass both companies (eg, oil and gas companies) and the stakeholders with which companies interact most frequently (eg, investors, regulators, or media). Through these interactions, actors within fields develop assumptions, norms, and rules that shape the behavior of companies within a field. In short, a field captures those parts of the external environment of a company that have the most direct influence on a company. Field building means that investors influence companies by changing the (1) stakeholders and (2) assumptions, norms, and rules that surround companies, thereby exerting their influence on companies indirectly.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We have found five tactics for field building that sustainable investors can use to increase their impact.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Shifting other investors&#39; evaluation of issues&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;As a first tactic for field building, investors can shift other investors&#39; evaluation of environmental and social issues. By publicly and continuously highlighting these environmental and social issues, an investor can raise attention to environmental and social issues among other investors and thereby motivate these other investors to influence companies.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This tactic is particularly relevant for investors that do not have enough assets under management or status to directly influence companies. By influencing larger investors with more direct influence on companies, investors can change the fields in which companies operate in ways that expose companies to more pressure for corporate sustainability.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Dutch shareholder “FollowThis” has used this first tactic very successfully since 2014 to influence oil and gas companies. FollowThis submits shareholder proposals on behalf of over 10,000 individuals who have bought shares of oil and gas companies. While FollowThis has neither the assets under management nor the elite status to be taken very seriously by oil and gas companies themselves, their approach has been very successful in influencing big Dutch pension funds. Some pension funds followed suit after their initial refusal to support FollowThis led to protests from beneficiaries and negative media attention — including ABP, the largest Dutch pension fund with over 500 billion Euro assets under management.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Sharing expertise with other investors&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;A second tactic for field building is to share expertise with other investors. Investors that are new to sustainable investing often struggle with the inherent complexity of environmental and social issues, and know neither what demands are realistic nor how to raise their demand in ways that make business sense for companies. By making private information publicly available, investors can empower other investors to influence companies. When other investors know more about sustainability, this creates additional pressure for corporate sustainability within the fields in which companies operate.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The international asset manager Robeco has used this tactic since August 2022, when it made its SDG framework openly accessible. This framework assesses the degree to which over 2,900 companies advance or undermine the 17 sustainable development goals (SDGs). Having used the framework internally since 2018, Robeco&#39;s decision to make their SDG framework open access not only establishes Robeco as a leader in that space. Access to this framework can help less experienced investors incorporate sustainability into their investment decisions.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Delegitimizing certain business activities&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;A third tactic for field building is to delegitimize business activities that are particularly harmful for the environment and society. Companies can only operate in fields in which key stakeholders — such as policymakers, consumers, suppliers, or the media — see their activities as legitimate. If these stakeholders start to see certain business activities as illegitimate, it can create existential problems for companies. Given these dynamics, investors that publicly problematize certain business activities can play a key role in changing widely shared assumptions about whether these business activities are legitimate or not.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Investors within the fossil fuel divestment movement have used this tactic very successfully. Since 2012, over 1,500 investors have publicly announced they would divest from fossil fuel companies, including the city of Chicago in 2022 and the Church of England in 2023. Proponents of the divestment movement make clear that, “&lt;a href=&quot;https://eur03.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgofossilfree.org%2Fusa%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2015%2F03%2FFossilFreeFrequentlyAskedQuestions.pdf&amp;amp;data=05%7C01%7Cmarti%40rsm.nl%7C5617faa4f4e6474822f608dbae59fdb1%7C715902d6f63e4b8d929b4bb170bad492%7C0%7C0%7C638295474207071901%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=AQBOvhTOgqMHpVyU1VprefUIR%2Foa%2BwCWQxS8Ns1s31g%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0&quot;>;Divestment isn&#39;t primarily an economic strategy, but a moral and political one&lt;/a>;.” They realize that their main influence does not come from increasing the cost of capital of fossil fuel companies in the short term, but by gradually changing public opinion about fossil fuel companies. Research shows that the divestment movement has influenced the views and actions of important stakeholders, including banks that have withheld credit from fossil fuel companies and students who have committed to not work for fossil fuel companies.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Establishing voluntary standards&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;A fourth tactic for field building is to establish voluntary sustainability standards. Voluntary standards have become a central instrument to advance corporate sustainability. They include codes of conduct, certification standards, and reporting standards, and may focus on single fields (eg, Equator Principles for project financing) or multiple fields (eg, the GRI reporting standard). Investors have played a major role in establishing voluntary standards, and have thereby reshaped the rules of the fields in which companies operate.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Investors that are active in the “Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures” have employed this tactic. Biodiversity loss and other nature-related risks are complex challenges, and many companies have little expertise on how to address them. Since 2020, investors have used the Taskforce to develop voluntary standards for corporate reporting on how companies harm nature and how nature creates risks for companies. After extensive stakeholder dialogue, pilot testing, and industry feedback, the Taskforce will release its final version in September 2023, which we expect will transform the nature-related parts of sustainability reporting.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Supporting regulatory changes&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;The fifth and final tactic for field building is to support regulatory changes that set mandatory standards for corporate sustainability. Once multiple companies within a field voluntarily engage in a sustainability-related activity, and thereby prove that such activities are technically and financially viable, regulatory interventions may be necessary to force laggard companies to follow suit. Following this logic, the number of laws related to corporate sustainability has &lt;a href=&quot;https://eur03.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.unpri.org%2Fpolicy%2Fregulation-database&amp;amp;data=05%7C01%7Cmarti%40rsm.nl%7C5617faa4f4e6474822f608dbae59fdb1%7C715902d6f63e4b8d929b4bb170bad492%7C0%7C0%7C638295474207071901%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=ZU3kycbEnn1GGmNwOIEHqUZNY11kMLAbEez1q7CfgcM%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0&quot;>;almost tripled between 2013 and 2023&lt;/a>;, from around 300 to almost 900. Given their investments in different types of companies, investors can provide valuable insights to policymakers and regulators about regulatory changes that seek to advance corporate sustainability.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some investors have used this tactic to shape the upcoming European Sustainability Reporting Standards, which will be mandatory for all companies operating in the European Union from 2028 onwards. While the April 2022 draft of this law contained strict disclosure requirements, the number of disclosure requirements were weakened in a subsequent draft due to pushback from companies. In February 2023, eleven investors and several sustainable investing industry associations wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;https://eur03.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdp.net%2Fen%2Farticles%2Fcompanies%2F60-companies-and-investors-worth-651bn-tell-eu-to-agree-ambitious-sustainability-reporting-standards&amp;amp;data=05%7C01%7Cmarti%40rsm.nl%7C5617faa4f4e6474822f608dbae59fdb1%7C715902d6f63e4b8d929b4bb170bad492%7C0%7C0%7C638295474207071901%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=dR4a7ipqlhcBhrCvxZCvnS4Td9USAyRarHM%2FEP%2FZJq8%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0&quot;>;public letter&lt;/a>; to policymakers of the European Union in which they urged policymakers to go back to strict disclosure requirement to “ensure a level playing field… for companies that already contribute to a nature-positive economy.”&lt;/p>; &lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;. 。 .&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Each of the five tactics can change the fields in which companies operate, thereby creating additional pressure for companies to become more sustainable. Despite these opportunities for increasing their impact, two reasons may deter investors from venturing into field building.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One reason is profitability. It can be difficult to make a business case for field building over the short term. Field building mostly generates costs for an investor, while benefits will be captured by other investors, including those in the future. Yet, given that many individuals are willing to accept lower returns if their investments create greater impact, they may seek out asset managers that engage in field building even if higher management fees slightly lower their returns.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another reason is political exposure. Field building requires that asset managers publicly take a stance on sustainability issues, which could lead to backlash by people with different views — a risk that is higher among asset managers that cater to a wide range of customers. These asset managers can limit this risk by doing field building on sustainability issues for which a broad consensus exists among their customers and that are backed by a strong business case.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;By broadening their toolbox of tactics, and mastering field building, investors can better position themselves to have a more positive impact on the environment and society — and, in doing so, attract more individual investors that care about impact.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 15 Sep 2023 23:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[How to Get Honest and Substantive Feedback from Your Customers]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/09/how-to-get-honest-and-substantive-feedback-from-your-customers]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/09/Sept23_15_1433543803-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;SvetaZi/Getty Images&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;Businesses can&amp;#8217;t improve operations without honest and substantive feedback. Customers can be reluctant to provide it, for several reasons. Companies can try to overcome this by focusing feedback requests on improvement (not employee assessment), focusing on customer actions instead of words, and approaching the gathering of feedback as a habit rather than an occasional effort.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/how-to-get-honest-and-substantive-feedback-from-your-customers?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/how-to-get-honest-and-substantive-feedback-from-your-customers?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;“How&#39;s everything so far?”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Fine, thank you.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In restaurants around the world, the “check-in dance” between servers and customers is pervasive. Servers ask how things are after customers receive their meal, and nearly all patrons reflexively respond with an automatic “fine, thanks.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the surface, it seems like the start of a feedback loop, but real feedback rarely materializes. Chances are the server isn&#39;t seeking a detailed critique, like whether the fish skin was crispy enough or the vegetables were over-seasoned. They&#39;re ensuring the meal is acceptable so that the dining process moves forward. Similarly, the diner often sidesteps genuine, constructive feedback, opting to maintain social etiquette and avoid a long interaction.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Both sides lose in this dance of niceties. The restaurant loses the opportunity to identify operational shortcomings, improve its product, and grow its reputation and customer base. The diner loses the opportunity to feel thrilled with the experience they receive and even — potentially — to be emotionally invested in the business.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Recently, one of us (Steve) and his wife, Michelle, were met with a different version of the dance at an upscale Brooklyn pop-up. The chef personally introduced a dish with the intention of combining several “luxury” ingredients. The dish just didn&#39;t work — at all. Michelle and Steve picked at it politely. But the dance departed from the typical choreography when instead of a server stopping by, the chef came out and asked a more pointed question, making it clear that he wasn&#39;t looking for politeness. “I&#39;ve been tinkering with that dish for a while and know it has a lot of elements, but does it &lt;em>;come together&lt;/em>; for you? I can&#39;t get better if I don&#39;t hear honest feedback.” The sincerity and sense of safety that the chef brought to the conversation allowed the diners to share that the dish just didn&#39;t work for them. It also made Steve and Michelle more engaged and interested in the restaurant&#39;s success, and they returned several weeks later to see that the dish had been adjusted and improved.&lt;/p>; &lt;article-promo>; &lt;hbr-component type=&quot;promo&quot; is-insight=&quot;insight-center&quot; title=&quot;The New Age of Operations&quot; dek=&quot;Improving efficiency and increasing resilience.&quot; cta-text=&quot;&quot; href=&quot;/insight-center/the-new-age-of-operations&quot;>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/insight-center/the-new-age-of-operations&quot; style= &quot;color:black;text-decoration:none&quot;>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; 洞察中心集合 &lt;/div>; &lt;h3>;运营新时代&lt;/h3>; &lt;div>; 提高效率并增强弹性。 &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hbr-component>; &lt;/article-promo>; &lt;p>;Many businesses have lost sight of this foundational operating principle and treat their customer feedback machine as a necessary evil to be fulfilled in the least-costly and least-awkward way possible. Smaller companies, which tend to be pressed for resources, may put little effort into trying to get customer feedback. Managers at small and medium-sized companies may feel like a robust customer feedback mechanism is a luxury that must wait until the company is larger.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;That&#39;s short-sighted, because true operational effectiveness comes from tweaking things that need to be changed &lt;em>;from a customer&#39;s vantage point&lt;/em>;. While obtaining feedback is crucial, it is only valuable if it&#39;s authentic. The challenge is that customers often shy away from such conversations, and businesses, unfortunately, tend to reinforce this reluctance in their approach to seeking feedback. The whole system has become so encumbered and obfuscated from its original purpose that in most circumstances it has become a useless ritual — one that may even destroy value.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Fixing the Problem&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;The fault with this dysfunctional feedback loop lies with both companies and customers. Companies have designed feedback systems aimed primarily for ease of customer input and quantification, leading to the innumerable requests we get to “please stay on the line to take a short survey after this call.” The last thing most customers want to do after phoning in to customer service is spend &lt;em>;more&lt;/em>; time on the phone. On the rare occasions when customers try to provide honest feedback in person, they are often met with defensive postures from staff members who are trained to “defuse” the situation instead of digging deeper for actionable feedback. In fact, often the best way to defuse the situation is to show a legitimate interest in hearing about the feedback!&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Customers also contribute to this problem. Humans are risk and conflict averse, so we generally try to avoid “high-stakes” interactions. The first step to fixing feedback systems is to understand why customers perceive them this way:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Honest feedback feels like a cognitive burden&lt;em>;.&lt;/em>;&lt;/strong>; Most of us avoid difficult and emotional conversations because they are, well, difficult. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gse.harvard.edu/ideas/news/13/11/remembering-professor-chris-argyris&quot;>;Chris Argyris&lt;/a>;, the late founder of the body of work called &lt;a href=&quot;https://thesystemsthinker.com/overcoming-defensive-routines-in-the-workplace/&quot;>;&lt;em>;productive interactions&lt;/em>;&lt;/a>;&lt;em>;, &lt;/em>;noted that there are three strategies people can use in situations of conflict: (1) &lt;em>;Bypass&lt;/em>; &lt;em>;— &lt;/em>;avoid discussing the issue and move on; (2) &lt;em>;Name&lt;/em>; — note the problem, but don&#39;t discuss it; and (3) &lt;em>;Engage&lt;/em>; — actually discuss the problem. The risk to the relationship is higher as you move up that scale, so people tend to employ &lt;em>;bypass &lt;/em>;in most situations. In the case of customer feedback, bypassing is saying things are fine, even if they are not.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;The consequences of feedback feel unnecessarily high. &lt;/strong>;This is especially true when the forum is one of many online public review sites. One of us (Elizabeth) recently found herself debating whether she wanted to write an honest review of a small business — one she was rooting for to succeed. It had a great product, but sub-par service. But an honest review would have the unintended effect of publicizing the service problems, so she just passed.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Fear of retaliation. &lt;/strong>;Some customers refrain from feedback for fear of retaliation. To continue the restaurant analogy, this might entail the dreaded image of kitchen staff tainting food in some way. Indeed, we often hear stories from customers who are repeatedly disappointed in some small way by a business, but don&#39;t want to give feedback for fear that it would impact the relationship. In effect, the customer seems to value the relationship with the business more than the service or product it provides.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Feedback requests have become like white noise.&lt;/strong>; Every business asks for feedback in every interaction, creating a situation similar to an inversion of the tragedy of the commons. Instead of an individual consuming a resource at the expense of the collective, the collective is ignoring a request at the expense of the business.&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;Some might ask whether this is a problem worth solving. Don&#39;t we get enough hints at issues from today&#39;s feedback system? We would argue no. The issue is that unhappy customers often just quit. They don&#39;t give warning — they just don&#39;t come back. So the real problem to be solved is that your “formal” feedback mechanisms might be saying that everything&#39;s fine, but you might have a service issue brewing. This can result in fast downward spirals and reputation issues that are hard to recover from. Like most health issues, prevention and/or early detection are far preferable to stronger interventions once the situation has become worse.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We offer several thoughts on how to improve:&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Make improvement your goal, not assessment.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Because companies use customer feedback to assess employee performance, many of us have experienced the plea from a customer service rep to rate them a “5 out of 5,” possibly taking a positive experience and ending it in an awkward (if not downright negative) way. It&#39;s not the employee&#39;s fault — it&#39;s the system that&#39;s in use.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We suggest reframing feedback questions to make it clear that the organization is seeking to improve — not to be told it&#39;s doing well. Instead of asking “how did I do?” ask “what&#39;s one thing could I do to have served you better today?” Invite the customer to join you in a journey for a better experience. You might need to teach your people to ask good second and third questions to solicit better feedback, because a broad-based initial question may not be sufficient for some customers to generate ideas. Training them to do this will be worth the effort.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Disproportionally focus on what customers do, not what they say.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;As noted above, customers are not inclined to share their thoughts or feelings unless things are either really bad or if the interaction is framed in the right way. So instead of tracking “sentiment,” which can be misleading, track and observe customer behavior. How often are customers repeating purchases? How frequently do they come to your store or site? What do they do when they&#39;re there? In the case of a restaurant, which entrees come back half-eaten and which inspire clean plates?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Systematically capturing this behavioral feedback requires a combination of data analysis to track large groups of customers to see patterns, but also, non-statistically significant observations by your frontline employees. Is there something they&#39;re noticing customers doing that indicates dissatisfaction? For instance, employees of a coffee stand might observe customers wrapping their cups in napkins; perhaps it means that the cup is too hot to hold? By combining data on customer behavior with the power of observation, businesses can generate hypotheses on how they can continually improve the quality of their operations.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Make this a habit, not a periodic intervention.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;As noted above, service issues can fester over time, causing customers to quit without warning. Prevention in this case is curative. So switch up that bi-annual or quarterly survey instrument in favor of mechanisms that are continual and part of your culture.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Finally, if you want to take it to the next level, consider pairing experimentation with your feedback efforts. Make a small change and ask for feedback. Or make a more significant change in a small area of your business and see how customers respond. Pairing experimentation with an eye to observing customers and seeking honest input is a mechanism to continually improve your operations — as is seeing feedback as both a gift and an imperative.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;By welcoming feedback as both a precious insight and a mandate, organizations can foster a vibrant and adaptive business environment that is responsive to customer needs and preferences. Establishing a genuine and meaningful feedback loop has the potential to elevate a business&#39;s operational standards considerably. Creating a culture that encourages feedback and sees customers not as sources of approval or disapproval, but as partners who can contribute to the betterment of a company&#39;s offering, is an important way to rethink the typical, unhelpful feedback dance that exists today.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 15 Sep 2023 22:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Sustainability Is About Your Workforce, Too]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/09/sustainability-is-about-your-workforce-too]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/09/Sept23_15_1219011427.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;Javier Zayas Photography/Getty Images&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;In recent years, many companies hired chief sustainability officers and established a set of high-priority programs to reduce carbon emissions and the risk of global climate change. As the EU moves forward with a number of regulations designed to protect the workforce, it&amp;#8217;s time to extend the concept of sustainability. People sustainability takes a holistic approach to corporate human capital practices, including diversity and inclusion, well-being, employee safety, and fair pay. It raises these human capital issues to the C-suite and obliges chief human resource officers to work with chief sustainability officers on these programs.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/sustainability-is-about-your-workforce-too?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/sustainability-is-about-your-workforce-too?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;The EU has long been committed to improving worker well-being, claiming it wants to create more transparent and predictable working conditions for all its 182 million workers. Now, it&#39;s moving ahead with this objective on a number of fronts:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;Its &lt;a href=&quot;https://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?langId=en&amp;amp;catId=1313&quot;>;Transparent and Predictable Working Conditions Directive&lt;/a>;, which member states were required to enact by August 2022, is geared toward improving employee protections and increasing labor market transparency.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Its &lt;a href=&quot;https://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=1311&amp;amp;langId=en&quot;>;Work-Life Balance Directive&lt;/a>;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>;,&lt;/span>; which came into effect in 2019, aims to set minimum standards for paternity, parental, and career leave as well as flexible work arrangements.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2022/11/28/council-gives-final-green-light-to-corporate-sustainability-reporting-directive/&quot;>;Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD)&lt;/a>; mandates that, starting in May 2024, any company with €40 million in net turnover, €20 million in assets, or 250 or more employees that trades in Europe publish detailed information about their efforts to address a range of sustainability challenges.&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;In recent years, many companies hired a chief sustainability officer and established a set of high-priority programs to reduce carbon emissions and the risk of global climate change. The enactment of these new regulations signals a new era in which it&#39;s time to extend the concept of sustainability to include similarly critical issues with the workforce — an idea I call people sustainability.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;People sustainability takes a holistic approach to corporate human capital practices, including diversity and inclusion, well-being, employee safety, and fair pay. It raises these human capital issues to the C-suite and obliges chief human resource officers to work with chief sustainability officers on these programs. It means that your employee well-being efforts are no longer delivered piecemeal, which was ineffective no matter how well-intentioned or resourced they might be.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The EU is essentially saying that all these “HR programs” are much bigger than HR: They now fall into the category of global citizenship mandates, and companies must treat and report them as such.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;How to Integrate People Sustainability into Your Company&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;I&#39;m talking to European and US firms about how they are gearing up for the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive and developing people sustainability metrics.&amp;nbsp;Here are examples of how a few companies are approaching this:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;Heineken has developed standard measurements of human rights, fair pay, and even living conditions for all its contract workers helping it deliver beverage sales around the world.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Enterprise software leader SAP has &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.sap.com/2022/10/people-sustainability-investment-sap-research/&quot;>;coupled its industry-leading diversity program to new pay equity and sustainability initiatives&lt;/a>;. For example, the company now openly publishes all pay bands so employees can see where they are and the pay scales for all new jobs posted. In parallel, it provides hiring and workplace support for neurodivergent employees. After undertaking a progressive gender pay equity analysis, it inaugurated a very aggressive program of promotions of women into senior leadership — all long-term “people sustainability” strategies.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Financial services firm Liberty Mutual sees people sustainability as a factor in limiting the global risks of its customers, partners, and employees in the face of accelerating climate change. Chief sustainability officer Francis Hyatt, who previously served as executive vice president of enterprise talent practices, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.libertymutualgroup.com/about-lm/corporate-information/sustainability/corporate-sustainability&quot;>;oversees the integration of global climate issues&lt;/a>; in the firm&#39;s risk management approach and promotes sustainability solutions for employees, resellers, and customers. The company promotes thought-through generational and gender equality programs, and Hyatt ensures that every employee understands how their long-term safety and success is part of the company&#39;s overall sustainability strategy. In other words, this new job function unifies all the brand&#39;s existing HR work into the context of sustainability and helping the planet.&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;What links all three of these major corporations is the way each separately discovered that when you frame human capital investment in the context of sustainability, it assumes even more importance than it did before.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you see value in this approach, where should you start at your organization? Building on the European Union&#39;s new detailed CSRD reporting requirements, leaders will need to address issues ranging from greenhouse gas emissions to gender pay across their own operations, as well as that of their suppliers and business partners. You should try to ensure sustainability becomes a pillar of operations as early as possible, as the compliance clock is ticking.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The real action is to get your HR team to start working as soon as possible with their ESG colleagues to get people sustainability metrics and strategies into your business goals. To drive this, bring together a team including your heads of HR, DEI, and ESG, as well as representatives from your corporate finance and legal teams, to design your people sustainability program. You&#39;ll ultimately want to see these goals reflected in your annual report and other stakeholder communications, so that these programs are seen as a core part of company strategy.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A recent survey by PwC reveals that many CEOs anticipate &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/news-room/press-releases/2023/pwc-26th-ceo-survey.html&quot;>;climate risk will affect their cost profiles&lt;/a>; and supply chains in the next year. However, despite these challenges, 60% of the surveyed CEOs do not plan to reduce headcount, and 80% do not plan to decrease compensation, as they recognize the importance of retaining talented employees.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Data like this underlines how people sustainability has become an integral strategy for corporate growth. Investors will soon begin to measure the effectiveness of a company&#39;s well-being initiatives as a key metric of overall performance as much as its P&amp;amp;L.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;You don&#39;t have to be directly affected by Europe&#39;s new sustainability laws to see that bringing together previously disconnected efforts such as DEI, purpose, or L&amp;amp;D under the umbrella of “long-term organizational sustainability” makes a lot of sense. You might even see it as meeting the needs of the present without compromising your future: a measure of sustainability that certainly gets my support.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 15 Sep 2023 21:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[The UAW and Other Unions Must Focus More on AI and Automation in Their Negotiations]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/09/the-uaw-and-other-unions-must-focus-more-on-ai-and-automation-in-their-negotiations]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/09/Sep23_15_N_FDXbXwQmc_h4elZPxUXLU_aQYgUYwnCsM_JUJzjthZnYU_1570020988.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;HBR Staff; Frazao Studio Latino/Getty Images; Umsplash&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;In its negotiations with the Big 3 car companies, the United Auto Workers&amp;#8217; priority is maximizing pay&amp;#160; increases for its members. The UAW and many other trade unions should be equally concerned about the impact of AI and automation on jobs and how to prepare their members for this new world.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/the-uaw-and-other-unions-must-focus-more-on-ai-and-automation-in-their-negotiations?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/the-uaw-and-other-unions-must-focus-more-on-ai-and-automation-in-their-negotiations?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;The advance of AI and automation technologies in the workplace requires new approaches to labor relations. Yet efforts by such trade unions as the United Auto Workers, Teamsters, and International Warehouse and Longshore Union efforts to negotiate a better future for their members appear to be stuck in the past.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This short-sightedness is especially worrying for young workers, who need effective representation at a time when the AI-driven workplace is taking shape. Employers should also be concerned because a lack of worker engagement in the change process today stores up problems for the future.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Both sides should take to heart the protracted strike involving Hollywood actors and writers. The actors union SAG-AFTRA recently joined the Writers Guild of America on the picket lines for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/story/2023-06-29/what-to-know-sag-aftra-strike-actors-hollywood&quot;>;first time in 63 years&lt;/a>;. The use of AI by movie and TV producers is one of the key issues that divides the sides. For example, there are concerns that computerized simulations of actors could replace the actors themselves, and writers will be relegated to refining AI-generated scripts. Resolving these issues will take time, but at least in this case, the parties have started the process before AI has become an industry mainstay.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;A Familiar Pattern&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;But other unions don&#39;t seem to be facing up to the ways technological advances will change jobs. Consider the recent deal struck by UPS and the Teamsters to increase the average annual pay for a full-time driver to about $170,000, &lt;a href=&quot;https://teamster.org/2023/07/weve-changed-the-game-teamsters-win-historic-ups-contract/&quot;>;touted&lt;/a>; as historic and a game changer by the trade union.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The agreement has achieved significant pay gains for workers but fails to adequately address issues such as how to prepare employees for automation. The future may involve fewer drivers operating not behind the wheel of a truck or van but behind a console as they manage fleets of autonomous vehicles.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A recent labor deal in the ports industry indicates a similar lack of attention to tech-related challenges. In August 2023, the International Warehouse and Longshore Union &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/dockworkers-ratify-labor-deal-at-west-coast-ports-f0dc23e?mod=djemlogistics_h&quot;>;confirmed&lt;/a>; it ratified a new, six-year contract with port employers that includes a 32% pay rise and a one-time (and well-deserved) “hero bonus” for dockworkers who worked through the pandemic. Meanwhile, the automation gap between North American ports like Los Angeles and facilities in Asia and Europe, such as Singapore, Dubai, Rotterdam, and Hamburg, has become disturbingly wide. Addressing this disparity and preparing workers for an automated future should be high on the labor-relations agenda.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Auto workers also face transformative change. Their industry is turning away from fossil fuel-burning cars in favor of electric vehicles and self-driving technology. The shift requires new, modern manufacturing platforms that fully utilize automation and different skill sets. Meanwhile, United Auto Workers union members &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/business/autos/uaw-members-vote-to-authorize-potential-strike-db4dbd7a&quot;>;recently authorized&lt;/a>; strike action against Detroit automakers should an agreement on a 46% pay increase and a 32-hour work week fail to be reached this year. But other issues, notably how to prepare workers for a changing workplace, should also be central to the negotiations.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Emerging Issues&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Of particular concern across most industries is the anticipated disappearance of many entry-level jobs, as algorithms take over much of the work of young recruits in areas such as computer programming, legal research, and product assembly lines. But without these jobs, how will junior workers gain the on-the-job experience they need to climb the career ladder and become future leaders in their chosen disciplines? Where will tomorrow&#39;s senior programmers or experienced lawyers come from?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another question that needs to be addressed is how to train people to work alongside AI in the workplace.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are various models for such coworker relationships. For example, AI-generated information is passed on to human managers to make decisions. Chipmaker Intel uses this approach to improve buying decisions. Procurement managers use information such as supplier-performance assessments produced by AI systems in their decision-making. Another framework employs AI systems to perform routine work but requires humans to intervene when there is an abnormal change in the operating environment. The onset of a pandemic or a system&#39;s unexpected behavior are examples of uncommon situations that require uniquely human attributes, such as understanding the context to recognize a problem and flexibility and adaptability to solve it.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Worker representatives and employers must develop ways to embed these frameworks and others in work practices to ensure that workers can fulfill such roles and pivot as necessary as new roles emerge.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;The Case for Urgency&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Now is the time to start thinking about these issues because the transition to an AI-driven workplace will not happen overnight. We have seen this in past waves of tech-infused change. For instance, in 2003, Walmart told its top 100 suppliers that it was about to mandate the installation of RFID tags on some one billion cases per year. The technology would deliver multiple benefits such as improved inventory accuracy and fewer out-of-stock instances. Industry pundits predicted that RFID would quickly become ubiquitous in supply chains. In reality, technical glitches and the high cost of tags stalled the technology&#39;s adoption. It took another 16 years for item-level RFID to come back into fashion.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;AI&#39;s adoption rate may be more rapid, but employers and employees have time to prepare for the workplace changes it will inevitably bring. Moreover, even if many workers stay in the same jobs with the same titles in the short to medium term, their jobs will change. They will likely see more repetitive tasks delegated to automated systems and have to perform more monitoring functions.&amp;nbsp; The demand for new skills — such as the ability to use a growing array of data and to spot aberrations that might disrupt automated processes — will increase.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Today&#39;s workers need ongoing, incremental re-skilling or upskilling to maintain a stable or improving career path. Displaced workers need substantive retraining to get their next job or career. Young people entering the workforce need a foundation of skills aligned with their aptitudes and the prevailing demand for human labor.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A range of educational programs, from bite-sized, on-demand learning to mid-length skill-certification programs, is required in response to these shifting demands. Updated high school, college, and post-graduate degree programs will also be needed. Unions should demand that companies invest in their members&#39; futures.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Short-Lived Advantages&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Negotiating pay and benefits concessions will always be a high priority for trade unions and their members. Today, in the current post-pandemic period, labor shortages strengthen unions&#39; bargaining positions. However, this environment will shift as AI and automation accelerate.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The pace of change is a cause for concern. AI is advancing rapidly, so the longer labor and employer representatives take to confront worker-related issues, the more difficult it will be to address them.&amp;nbsp;Now is the time for labor unions to use their leverage — which may not last long as AI tools become better — to ensure the future of their members.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 15 Sep 2023 20:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[How Off-the-Shelf Tech Can Make Factories More Profitable]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/09/how-off-the-shelf-tech-can-make-factories-more-profitableespecially-for-smaller-companies]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/08/Sep23_09_BLeOMjOFl1Y_343457_459728.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;HBR Staff/Unsplash/Pexels&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;Too often, smaller companies are intimidated by the high costs, complexity, and long installation times that high-end smart factory systems can require. This is short-sighted. Companies can see big financial benefits by utilizing existing data and simpler technologies to reduce waste, labor costs, overhead, and utility expenses.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/how-off-the-shelf-tech-can-make-factories-more-profitableespecially-for-smaller-companies?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/how-off-the-shelf-tech-can-make-factories-more-profitableespecially-for-smaller-companies?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;It&#39;s possible to turn a factory into a smart factory much faster and cheaper than most executives think.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When many people imagine a smart factory, they envision something complicated and expensive — the kind of massive “manufacturing execution system,” or MES, that can take more than a year and millions of dollars to implement. If you&#39;re Elon Musk, you can pour money into advanced automation and robotics — and keep pouring. But you don&#39;t need to be Elon Musk. Many of the greatest benefits of intelligent manufacturing require much less time and money.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many smart factory proponents, bedazzled by technology, overlook the biggest potential sources of value creation. We&#39;ve seen this in visits to hundreds of manufacturing sites over the last five years: that most manufacturers make far too little use of readily available data. Labor hours, for instance; those numbers are collected for payroll, but rarely extracted from clock-in/out systems and analyzed to discover ways to operate more efficiently. Similarly, off-the-shelf RFID technology can trace scrap origins, and simple Internet of Things (IoT) sensors can deliver real-time insights into utility usage. The ability to see, analyze, and act on information immediately can have as much impact on factory profitability as advanced robotics, at much lower cost.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The low-tech, low-cost path to a smart factory works for companies of any size and is especially well suited to the appetites and abilities of midsized companies. Middle market executives report being &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/05/how-midsize-companies-can-make-the-most-of-disruption&quot;>;daunted by disruption, especially in technolog&lt;/a>;y. In an unpublished survey conducted by AlixPartners this summer, 55% of companies with revenues under $500 million a year said technological change is happening too fast for them to keep up; just 24% of larger companies said the same. They don&#39;t need to be scared. Instead, the middle market can be the prime beneficiary of the revolutionary democratization of the digital realm. In recent years, cloud computing platforms have brought sophisticated capabilities within reach of almost every company, and sensors and cameras that once needed to be custom-built can now be acquired and adapted inexpensively. These changes empower enterprises of all sizes with state-of-the-art tools for smart factories.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When properly designed and deployed, a smart-factory strategy can accelerate efforts to solve the worker shortage, bridge the skills gap, decarbonize operations, shorten lead times, or nearshore. The key is knowing where to begin.&lt;/p>; &lt;article-promo>; &lt;hbr-component type=&quot;promo&quot; is-insight=&quot;insight-center&quot; title=&quot;The New Age of Operations&quot; dek=&quot;Improving efficiency and increasing resilience.&quot; cta-text=&quot;&quot; href=&quot;/insight-center/the-new-age-of-operations&quot;>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/insight-center/the-new-age-of-operations&quot; style= &quot;color:black;text-decoration:none&quot;>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; 洞察中心集合 &lt;/div>; &lt;h3>;运营新时代&lt;/h3>; &lt;div>; 提高效率并增强弹性。 &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hbr-component>; &lt;/article-promo>; &lt;p>;Start by identifying the business issue you are trying to solve. Companies should focus on the factory P&amp;amp;L and identify KPIs and metrics that directly impact on it. The next step is to figure out how to apply smart-factory concepts and tools to improve performance on those specific benchmarks, which typically include overall equipment effectiveness, machine/asset utilization, productivity, and throughput.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Take, for example, a commercial bakery in the northeast United States with annual revenues of about $200 million.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The company realized $1.5 million in annual savings, which increased EBITDA by 4.8%, through targeted smart factory solutions centered on three business issues: reducing scrap and other waste, improving labor costs, and cutting energy use. The company was able to address all three issues with relatively simple technology.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A major cause of waste, for example, was baked goods that came off the line underweight (which had to be discarded) or overweight (which used more dough than necessary). By installing digital scales and sensors on the existing manufacturing line, the company caught that waste before it was (literally) baked in — reducing scrap by 25%. A homemade labor visibility and utilization dashboard provided a similar real-time view of labor presence on the factory floor, revealing that a significant number of workers were staying on after their shifts; without a real-time way to track the behavior, managers had been unable to enforce shift times; with the tool, overtime dropped 50%.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Finally, by installing IoT sensors and connecting data feed with existing systems to monitor utilities consumption, annual utilities spend was cut by 5% because, among other things, it revealed when equipment was being run unnecessarily.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What made these gains — which took less than six months — possible? In our work with manufacturers, we have identified four best practices that help make smart factory projects affordable and successful.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Make the plant&#39;s P&amp;amp;L your focus.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Most practitioners define “smart factory” in terms of software technologies (such as AI, machine learning, and warehouse management systems) or intelligent hardware (like connected devices and computer vision). Any or all of these can be part of a smart factory — but a focus on tools or technologies runs the risk of not seeing the opportunity. In our experience, an approach that defines a smart factory with the lens of plant P&amp;amp;L brings pragmatism that is required for success on the plant floor.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Identify all the cost drivers.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Most smart factory initiatives look only at the operations inside a factory&#39;s four walls — and especially at production lines themselves. A program that looks only at overall equipment effectiveness (OEE) addresses less than a quarter of the factory&#39;s full costs, which are spread out across company departments. In a typical consumer goods operation, ingredients are about 45% of cost and packaging 20%; direct labor, indirect labor, and overhead are about 10% each (each managed by different teams); and utilities account for about 5%. All of those can be sources of digitally-driven value creation.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Leverage existing plant assets.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;You don&#39;t need to replace existing equipment with a monolithic digital platform. Adding digital capabilities to existing equipment will get most of the benefits of a rebuild for less money, in less time, and with less need to fix the problems new platforms always have.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Put manufacturing leaders in charge.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;The best leaders for smart factory projects are experienced executives who combine manufacturing pragmatism with digital savvy. Too many balance sheets show write-offs for factory modernizations that didn&#39;t deliver the goods — sometimes literally. In this respect, many middle market companies have an advantage over larger rivals, in that their senior leaders are closer to operations both experientially and physically.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We have seen this combination of capabilities work time and again. A couple of years ago, we worked with a east coast metal products manufacturer in the US with roughly $100 million in revenue that was overwhelmed by orders when Covid disrupted its overseas competitors&#39; supply chains. With no time for a major factory overhaul — and no way of knowing how long the surge would continue — the company installed IoT counters and displays costing about $100 apiece on cutting machines, which allowed plant supervisors to monitor and assist operators in real time. At the same time, data from the counters was integrated with the ordering system, so that orders could be instantly fed into production scheduling, tracked, and matched with shipping, which significantly streamlined the order-taking and fulfilment process.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This example of a practical digital solution drove a doubling of production and revenue within one year without any capital investment or physical factory expansion. Two years later, though global supply chains were back to normal, the company&#39;s sales had grown another 15% because its increased efficiency made them better able to meet global prices and benefit from “buy American” policy changes.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When a company&#39;s smart factory approach is laid out according to business priorities and leaders look for the simplest solution, inexpensive, quick-strike tactics can improve yield and quality, boost productivity of both labor and machinery, deliver savings in energy and materials used, reduce receive-store-pick-pack-ship lead times, and more.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Moves like these are a better fit for the &lt;a href=&quot;/2021/03/bridging-the-gap-between-capital-providers-and-midsize-companies&quot;>;capital constraints&lt;/a>; midsized and smaller manufacturers face. They deliver results faster and fit with the ability of midsized companies to move quickly, unencumbered by corporate bureaucracy.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;And they provide something else. Big multinationals — with many divisions and factories in many locations — are better able to set up pilot projects, experiments, or Skunk Works. They can try, fail, learn, and adapt with less danger than a company that has just one or two plants and P&amp;amp;Ls.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A low-tech, low-cost approach to smart factories provides middle market companies with low-risk gains while at the same time providing valuable learning and experience — for executives, managers, and production workers — that can pave the way to bigger, more technologically-advanced investments later.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 14 Sep 2023 22:25:02 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[AI Adoption in U.S. Health Care Won&rsquo;t Be Easy]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://hbr.org/2023/09/ai-adoption-in-u-s-health-care-wont-be-easy]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;hero-image >; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/09/Sep23_14_1473680688_488500297.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;div>; &lt;span>;HBR Staff/lcs813/Aleksandra Konoplia/Getty Images&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/hero-image>; &lt;div more-caption=&quot;more&quot; close-caption=&quot;close&quot;>; &lt;span>;Summary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&lt;p>;The US health sector has struggled to put innovations into practice. AI promises to be no different. But 3 steps can help overcome the obstacles. And the contrasting experiences of electronic health records and minimally invasive surgical removal of the gallbladder can be instructive.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/ai-adoption-in-us-health-care-wont-be-easy?language=es&quot;>;Leer en español&lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/09/ai-adoption-in-us-health-care-wont-be-easy?language=pt&quot;>;Ler em português&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;Artificial Intelligence has the potential to improve every aspect of health care. AI applications can &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.370.6521.1144&quot;>;accelerate scientific discovery&lt;/a>;, help physicians and nurses &lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/jamia/advance-article/doi/10.1093/jamia/ocad072/7136722&quot;>;make better decisions&lt;/a>;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/article-abstract/2804309&quot;>;improve medical advice &lt;/a>;for patients, and reduce the sometimes-crushing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/26/technology/ai-health-care-documentation.html&quot;>;burden of paperwork&lt;/a>;. But history suggests that the US health sector struggles to put innovations like AI into practice, due in part to what economists call “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/mic.4.3.1&quot;>;switchover disruptions&lt;/a>;,” the costly phase-in period for new technologies that can upend profitable operations. To reduce switchover disruptions for AI and accelerate adoption, health care innovators must build trust in AI with three critical constituencies: providers, patients, and the public.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are three things that innovators can do to build the requisite trust:&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;1. Change the narrative about the purpose of AI.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Instead of designing the new technologies to substitute for human decision-making, innovators should aim towards new tools that complement and augment the expertise of providers. For example, AI applications have the potential to support the patient-provider relationship by relieving providers of &lt;a href=&quot;/2019/11/how-ai-in-the-exam-room-could-reduce-physician-burnout&quot;>;rote tasks&lt;/a>; — such as typing information into an electronic health record (EHR) — and enabling them to spend more of their limited time and attention on their patients and on higher-order tasks such as problem-solving and communication.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some providers are even experimenting with AI as a tool to help them communicate more &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/12/health/doctors-chatgpt-artificial-intelligence.html&quot;>;compassionately&lt;/a>; with patients. The purpose of these tools should be to enable providers to do more for more patients in more places than would be possible without them.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;2. Pay careful attention to how AI applications are implemented.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Prior to implementation, AI applications — like all new diagnostic and therapeutic innovations — should demonstrably improve outcomes and provide better experiences for patients and providers. Payers, health systems, and providers need to come to a common understanding about when it is appropriate to use an AI application, how it should be used, and how potential side effects will be identified and mitigated.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, AI-driven online &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/ai-chatbots-can-diagnose-medical-conditions-at-home-how-good-are-they/&quot;>;symptom checkers, predictive models, and diagnostic&lt;/a>; programs must be carefully curated by physicians to reduce the risks of hallucinations (invented facts) or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aax2342&quot;>;diagnostic bias based on race&lt;/a>; or other characteristics. Payers and health systems should also rely on input from clinicians to adapt AI applications to clinical and administrative workflows.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;3. Assure patients and the public that AI applications serve their needs without threatening their rights.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;To address these concerns innovators should look to emerging frameworks such as the European Commission&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40804-021-00224-0&quot;>;&lt;em>;Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI&lt;/em>;&lt;/a>; or the Biden Administration&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/ai-bill-of-rights/&quot;>;&lt;em>;Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights&lt;/em>;&lt;/a>;. These frameworks offer design principles for trustworthy AI such as: AI systems should be safe and effective. AI algorithms should be unbiased and promote equitable healthcare outcomes. Data privacy should be maintained. Patients should be informed when an automated system is being used, and they should be able to opt out of automated systems where appropriate.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The contrasting examples of two earlier transformative technologies — EHRs and minimally invasive gallbladder surgery — illustrate why it is necessary, and urgent, to reduce switchover disruptions for AI in health care.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1991, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/5306/the-computer-based-patient-record-an-essential-technology-for-health&quot;>;report&lt;/a>; by the Institute of Medicine (IOM) of the National Academy of Sciences identified EHRs (then known as computer-based patient records) as an essential technology for health care. But by 2007 only 4% of physicians and less than 2% of hospitals reported having a fully functional EHR. This was true at a time when most other sectors of the economy were rapidly digitizing and despite studies showing that EHRs were associated with lower costs and improved quality of care.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It wasn&#39;t until the Obama administration included billions of dollars of subsidies for EHRs in its &lt;a href=&quot;https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R40161/9&quot;>;stimulus program&lt;/a>; during the great recession of 2009 — nearly two decades after the IOM report — that EHRs began to take off.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In contrast, minimally invasive surgical removal of the gallbladder — a method that transformed one of the most common surgical procedures — took just &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3016026/&quot;>;a few years&lt;/a>; from its first use in the United States in 1988 to nearly complete adoption.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Switchover disruptions were high for EHRs and low for the new surgical procedure. Why?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The introduction of EHRs required large initial expenditures on software and the purchase of computers for every clinical setting. Even more costly was training employees on the new system and the drop in productivity as they climbed the learning curve. Additional cost and disruption came from the redesign of clinical and administrative workflows needed to capture information for the EHR and to put that information to meaningful use.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The switchover to EHRs also involved hidden costs stemming from challenges to existing power relationships and professional identities. Many physicians saw EHRs as evidence of their increasing subordination to the demands of administrators and payers, particularly as the portion of their time devoted to feeding information into the system increased. Apart from the system modules that expedited billing and receiving, most physicians were not clamoring for EHRs and did not see them as solving a pressing problem. Many liked and trusted their paper records, and EHRs seem to have worsened the problem of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.healthaffairs.org/content/forefront/physician-burnout-public-health-crisis-message-our-fellow-health-care-ceos&quot;>;physician burnout&lt;/a>; and early retirement.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Minimally invasive gallbladder surgery was also a big change from previous technology and required significant investment in costly new tools, training, and processes. But surgeons and hospitals were already in the business of removing gallbladders, and the changes were primarily limited to the surgical suite.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Changing to a new and better surgical technique did not challenge existing power relationships and professional identities. Many surgeons &lt;em>;wanted&lt;/em>; to learn the new methods. In addition, the idea of minimally invasive surgery was attractive to payers, patients, and the public at large, which can greatly ease the transition to a new technology.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some AI applications come with relatively low switchover disruptions. For example, AI can be used to analyze medical records to predict which patients are at elevated risk for falls in the hospital. High-risk patients can then be flagged in the EHR. Anyone encountering the patient can then take steps to reduce the risk of a fall. This application is easily incorporated into existing workflows and can even eliminate steps such as, for example, a daily huddle for care teams to evaluate fall risks.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, much of the current excitement about AI comes from large language models (LLMs), like &lt;a href=&quot;https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt&quot;>;ChatGPT&lt;/a>;, that have the potential to automate decision-making about diagnoses and treatments.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These AI applications are likely to come with large switchover disruptions, threatening to devalue the hard-won human expertise — and even eliminate the jobs — of doctors, nurses, and other providers. Fear of this kind of automation creates resistance to change. The resistance is amplified by the tendency of LLMs to “hallucinate” (ie, invent facts). Checking for hallucinations adds another complication to the already overly full workload of providers.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2023/02/22/60-of-americans-would-be-uncomfortable-with-provider-relying-on-ai-in-their-own-health-care/&quot;>;recent surveys&lt;/a>; reveal that most Americans are uncomfortable with the prospect of AI being used in their own health care. Most doubt that AI will improve health outcomes and worry that it may worsen the patient-provider relationship. These concerns of patients and the public are another potential source of resistance.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fortunately, AI is a new technology and attitudes are not yet written in stone. There is time to act. However, high switchover disruptions reduce the incentives for firms to adopt innovations, particularly in markets — like those for physician and hospital services and health insurance — that are highly concentrated and protected from external competition by regulatory and other barriers. Without action, the health sector may delay or forego valuable AI applications much as it did with EHRs.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The United States is a world leader in the development of AI. But technology isn&#39;t destiny. People choose how and when to put technology to use. It would be sadly ironic if the US health sector lagged in reaping the benefits of this transformative new technology. The key is to design and implement AI applications so that they are worthy of our trust.&lt;/p>; &lt;!-- citation -->; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 14 Sep 2023 21:25:02 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
