data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;首先，让我给您讲一个故事。从前有两只豺狼：Karataka，名字的意思是“谨慎”，Damanaka，名字的意思是“大胆”。他们虽然是狮王平伽罗迦的第二位侍从，但野心勃勃，狡猾狡诈。有一天，狮子王被森林里的一阵咆哮声吓坏了。豺狼知道这是公牛的声音，没什么好害怕的，他们说服公牛来到狮子面前，表白了他的友谊。狮子和公牛成了朋友，豺狼被感恩的君主提升为第一品级。不幸的是，狮子和公牛开始花太多时间交谈，以至于狮子停止狩猎，随从的动物开始挨饿。于是豺狼让狮子相信公牛在密谋对付他，又让公牛相信狮子计划杀死他，于是狮子和公牛打了起来，公牛被杀了，有足够的肉吃。每个人都吃东西，豺狼在国王的眼中地位更高，因为它们警告了他这个阴谋，它们在森林里其他人的眼中也上升了，当然，除了可怜的公牛之外——但是这并不重要，因为他死了，并为每个人提供了一顿丰盛的午餐。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;这非常近似，是动物寓言书五个部分中第一部分也是最长的框架故事被称为“Panchatantra”，标题为“论朋友间的纷争”。第三部分“战争与和平”，这个标题后来被另一本著名的书所使用，描述了乌鸦和猫头鹰之间的冲突，其中奸诈的乌鸦的欺骗导致了猫头鹰的失败和毁灭。我在我的小说中使用了这个故事的一个版本“&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Victory-City-Novel-Salman-Rushdie/dp/0593243390&quot; data-event-click= &quot;{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Victory-City-Novel-Salman-Rushdie/dp/0593243390&quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https: //www.amazon.com/Victory-City-Novel-Salman-Rushdie/dp/0593243390&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;胜利之城&lt;/a>;。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;什么我一直觉得“五卷”故事的迷人之处在于其中许多故事并不道德化。他们不宣扬善良、美德、诚实或克制。狡猾、策略和不道德往往会克服所有反对。好人并不总是胜利。 （甚至并不总是清楚谁是好人。）因此，它们看起来不可思议地当代，因为我们，现代读者，生活在一个不道德、无耻和狡猾的世界里，世界各地的坏人常常获胜。&lt; /p>;&lt;p>;“这些故事都是从哪里来的？”在我的小说中，男孩 Haroun 问他讲故事的父亲“&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Haroun-Sea-Stories-Salman-Rushdie/dp/0140157379&quot; data-event-click= &quot;{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Haroun-Sea-Stories-Salman-Rushdie/dp/0140157379&quot;}&quot;

rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;她脚下的地面&lt;/a >;，”可以用不到一百个字来讲述，但它包含了关于艺术、爱情和死亡之间关系的巨大问题。它提出这样的问题：爱能否借助艺术战胜死亡？也许它的答案是：尽管有艺术，死亡难道不能战胜爱情吗？或者它告诉我们，艺术以爱与死亡为主题，并通过将它们变成不朽的故事来超越这两者。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;神话的宝库确实丰富。当然，有希腊神话，还有北欧散文和埃达诗。伊索、荷马、尼伯龙根的指环、凯尔特传说，以及欧洲三大事件：法国事件，围绕查理曼的故事；罗马问题，关于古典世界；以及不列颠事务，围绕亚瑟王形象的传说。在德国，有雅各布·格林和威廉·格林收集的民间故事。但在印度，在我听到这些故事之前，我是伴随着“Panchatantra”长大的，当我发现自己处于项目之间时，我就会回到这些狡猾的豺狼和乌鸦之类的地方，问他们我的故事是什么。接下来应该告诉。到目前为止，他们还没有让我失望。我需要了解的关于善良及其反面、关于自由与囚禁、关于冲突的一切，都可以在这些故事中找到。对于爱情，我不得不说，有必要到别处去寻找。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;因此，当我今天站着接受和平奖时，我问自己，“寓言的世界必须告诉我们什么关于和平？”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;这个消息不太好。荷马告诉我们，十年战争之后，当我们关心的每个人都死了，特洛伊被摧毁时，和平就会到来。北欧神话告诉我们，诸神黄昏之后，和平来临，众神消灭了他们传统的敌人，但也被他们摧毁了。 《五卷书》告诉我们，和平——猫头鹰的死亡和乌鸦的胜利——只能通过背叛行为来实现。暂时抛开过去的传说，看看今年夏天的双胞胎寓言，电影《奥本海默》提醒我们，只有在“小男孩”和“胖子”两颗原子弹分别落在广岛和长崎的人民身上之后，和平才到来；而名为“芭比”的票房怪兽则清楚地表明，在一个每天都完美的世界里，不间断的和平和未稀释的幸福只存在于粉红色的塑料中。&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline -recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;当战争在不远的地方肆虐时（一场由一个人的暴政和对权力和征服的贪婪而产生的战争）以及当另一场激烈的冲突发生时，我们聚集在一起谈论和平。以色列和加沙地带发生爆炸。现在的和平感觉就像是在烟斗中吸食麻醉剂而产生的幻想。就连这个词的含义，战斗双方也无法达成一致。对于乌克兰来说，和平不仅仅意味着停止敌对行动。这意味着，而且必然意味着，归还被占领的领土并保证其主权。对于乌克兰的敌人来说，和平意味着乌克兰投降。同一个词，有两个不兼容的定义。以色列和巴勒斯坦人的和平感觉更加遥远。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;和平是一件很难实现的事情。然而我们渴望它，不仅渴望战争结束后的伟大和平，也渴望我们私人生活的小小的平静。沃尔特·惠特曼认为和平是每天照耀在我们身上的太阳：&lt;/p>;&lt;blockquote >;&lt;div >;&lt;p>;真正和平的太阳！噢，加速的光芒！&lt;br/>;噢，自由而逍遥！哦，我在这里，准备着，为之歌唱！&lt;br/>;哦，世界的太阳将会升起，耀眼夺目，并占据他的高度——我的理想啊，你也一定会升起！&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>; &lt;/blockquote>;&lt;p>;惠特曼的“理想”是和平。因此，让我们同意他的观点，尽管很难找到，但这个东西非常值得追求。我的父母在给我取名 Salman 时也是这么想的，这个名字的根源是名词 &lt;em>;salamat&lt;/em>;，意思是“和平”。 “萨尔曼”是“和平的”。事实上，我是一个非常安静、乖巧、好学的男孩，生性平和。麻烦后来才开始。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;如果说我的作品受到寓言的影响，那么和平奖也明显带有寓言色彩。我喜欢这样的想法：和平本身可能&lt;em>;&lt;/em>;就是奖品——这个由明智的捐助者组成的评审团是如此强大，以至于他们能够将一年的和平奖授予一个人，仅此而已。真正的、受祝福的和平，不是琐碎的满足，&lt;em>;和平&lt;/em>;，而是优质的法兰克福和平葡萄酒，全年供应，送到您家门口，装瓶优雅。这是一个我很高兴获得的奖项。我什至想写一个关于它的故事，“获得和平作为奖品的人。”&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;我想象它发生在一个乡村小镇——村庄里公平，也许吧。通常会有一些比赛，争夺最好的馅饼和蛋糕，最好的西瓜；猜测农民的猪的重量。一个穿着破旧礼服的小贩乘坐马车来到这里，并表示如果允许他担任比赛评委，他将颁发任何人见过的最好的奖励。 “最好的奖品！”他哭。 “卷起！卷起！”就这样，他们卷了起来，淳朴的乡下人，小贩向各个获奖者分发小瓶子，瓶子上贴着真、美、自由、善良和和平的标签。村民们很失望。他们更喜欢现金。而且，在展会结束后的一年里，还发生了一些奇怪的事情。喝完瓶子里的液体后，真相奖获得者开始通过准确地告诉村民他对他们的看法来惹恼和疏远他们。美女喝完奖品后，变得更加美丽，至少在她自己看来，但也变得令人难以忍受的虚荣。自由的放荡行为震惊了许多村民，他们断定她的瓶子里一定含有某种烈性麻醉剂。善良自称为圣人，当然大家都觉得他难以忍受。和平只是坐在树下微笑。村子里闹事太多，这个笑容也太让人恼火了。&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt; /div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;一年后，集市再次举办，小贩又回来了，却被赶出了城。 “走开，”村民们喊道。 “我们不想要那种奖品。一个玫瑰花结、一块奶酪、一块火腿，或者一条挂着闪亮奖章的红丝带。这些都是正常的奖品。我们想要那些。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;我可能会也可能不会写那个故事。至少，它可以轻松地说明一个严肃的观点，即我们认为我们都同意是美德的概念可能会被视为恶习，这取决于你的观点及其在现实世界中的影响。在 Italo Calvino 的书中“&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Cloven-Viscount-Italo-Calvino/dp/0544960068&quot;

data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Peter Wilds-Bethea 从未打算成为一名教师。在布朗诉教育委员会做出裁决前后，他开始在家乡南卡罗来纳州达灵顿上学。他说，种族隔离“就在你面前”。他的父亲是白人，母亲是黑人；他的祖先曾在南部邦联军队服役，在内战前曾被奴役。黑人教师是他所在社区的重要人物——邻居、家人的朋友。但他并不认为教育是他的道路。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;当一位表弟鼓励他找到一份教师的工作，这样他就可以旅行并在暑假有时间休息时，情况发生了变化。那时，威尔兹-贝西娅已经搬到纽约市并获得了咨询硕士学位。他向纽约市考试委员会（当时是对纽约市教师进行认证的机构）询问了指导职位。但他被告知，辅导员的职位主要授予受青睐或更有经验的教师。因此，1985 年，他担任了特殊教育的代课老师，主要与有行为和情感问题的四年级学生一起工作。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;在接下来的五年里，Wilds-Bethea 致力于全面发展 -时间，完全获得教师资格。他参加了考试委员会要求的考试，获得了第二个硕士学位，并完成了试用期。他认为自己已经永远留在体制内了，于是在哈莱姆区的一所学校 PS 92 找到了一份工作，那里的许多教职人员都是黑人。但是，1991 年，一项新法律生效，这意味着 Wilds-Bethea 和全市其他教师必须通过另一项考试：国家教师考试 (NTE)。几十年来，在几个特别工作组得出结论认为教师的低标准正在损害学生的表现并呼吁教育工作者更多地了解文科知识后，该标准被纽约州采用。考试涵盖社会研究、科学、数学、文学和写作的基础知识。纽约市的教师——即使是那些已经获得终身教职并获得执照的教师——也需要通过考试才能保住全职工作并享受资历和福利。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Wilds-Bethea 开始参加 NTE 每次，他会落后两到三分。 He typically did fine on the math and science sections, but he had trouble on the communications section, which he attributes to a then undiagnosed hearing impairment that made it hard for him to focus on the listening portion of the test. There were also essay prompts, which Wilds-Bethea described as “ridiculous”: “I just went and wrote any old bullshit,” he said. Wilds-Bethea failed the NTE ten times. In 1993, the state began phasing out the NTE and introduced an alternative exam, the Liberal Arts and Science Test, or &lt;em >;LAST&lt;/em>;, which Wilds-Bethea took and failed three times.&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;He wasn&#39;t the only teacher who struggled with the NTE and the &lt;em >;LAST&lt;/em>;. At PS 92, Wilds-Bethea and his colleagues traded horror stories about their test-taking experiences. One woman said that she threw up every time she took one of the exams.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Wilds-Bethea heard that some teachers were organizing to address problems with the tests. The first meeting that he attended was at a middle school in the Bronx, in the lunchroom after school. There were maybe half a dozen people there. Wilds-Bethea served as note-taker. They gave themselves a name: the Committee for a Fair Licensing Procedure.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;The group started meeting every few weeks at different schools across the city. Soon, they were averaging a hundred people at each gathering, with several thousand more subscribed to the group&#39;s newsletter. Committee members would visit test sites, where they would hand out pamphlets and a questionnaire. They started compiling a database of affected teachers who had repeatedly failed the NTE and the &lt;em >;LAST&lt;/em>;.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Wilds-Bethea felt consumed by these tests. He wrote to the heads of licensing for New York City and State, asking for an exemption for previously full-time, tenured teachers, but got no response. To him, it seemed unfair to make full-time teachers prove themselves in this way—and to watch the ones who failed get demoted and lose pay, which is what eventually happened to him. And then there was the personal humiliation of it: “your feelings of being incompetent,” he said. His colleagues “wanted to be educators. And they&#39;ve been tarnished and labelled. It&#39;s not good for your self-esteem.”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;ztz9g8&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;zfjmd&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;The committee members were predominantly Black, although not exclusively: a few Latino educators joined, along with a substantial minority of white Russian immigrants. According to coverage from the time, the NTE had earned a nickname in some circles: the Negro Teacher Eliminator. A presentation by Bob Schaeffer, from the advocacy organization FairTest, confirmed the committee&#39;s perception that the test was racially biased. From 1993 through 1994, an average of eighty-four per cent of white test-takers passed the NTE, compared with forty-four per cent of Black test-takers, and forty per cent of Latino test-takers. From March, 1993, to June, 1995, the average pass rate for the &lt;em >;LAST&lt;/em>; was ninety-three per cent for white test-takers, compared with fifty-three per cent and fifty per cent for Black and Latino test-takers, respectively.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;After consulting a civil-rights attorney, the committee voted to sue New York City and State for violating Title VII, the legal provision that prohibits race-based discrimination in the workplace, along with other provisions. Their class-action lawsuit, filed in 1996, was made up of Black and Latino teachers who failed the NTE or the &lt;em >;LAST&lt;/em>;. The case has dragged on for almost three decades, and has come to include more than five thousand plaintiffs.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;The court found that Black and Latino teachers clearly passed these tests at lower rates than white teachers. In order to prove that this wasn&#39;t illegal, the defendants had to show that the test actually demonstrated what it promised: that teachers who did well on the test would do better in their jobs. A district-court judge, Constance Baker Motley—a Black woman and famous civil-rights lawyer who worked with Thurgood Marshall on Brown v. Board—initially found in favor of New York, concluding that the NTE and the &lt;em >;LAST&lt;/em>; were sufficiently job-related to justify their use. But the Second Circuit vacated part of that decision and dropped New York State as a defendant. Another district-court judge, Kimba Wood, subsequently found that the city had violated Title VII because the &lt;em >;LAST&lt;/em>; was not properly validated, or proven to show what it said it showed. In 2021, the city agreed to a schedule of payments. This fight over tests has proved expensive: the city now owes many of these teachers significant back pay and other financial compensation. The payouts are expected to total about $1.8 billion—the highest dollar-value judgment ever brought against New York City. (In a statement, a New York City Law Department spokesman called the court&#39;s decisions “mistaken” and said they “unfairly burden City taxpayers with costly judgements.”)&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The lawsuit raised a difficult question that never really got resolved: Were these tests racist? Coverage of the case, especially in conservative outlets, has focussed on this matter. One New York &lt;em>;Post&lt;/em>; article noted tartly that Herman Grim, a Queens resident who will get a payout of more than two million dollars from the city after failing the &lt;em >;LAST&lt;/em>; in the nineties, could not give any examples of why the test was racially biased. The clearly intended takeaway is that teachers who weren&#39;t smart enough to pass a basic-knowledge exam cried racism and will get to collect millions of dollars as a result.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;uvzbevo&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Actual question examples from the &lt;em >;LAST&lt;/em>; and the NTE are difficult to find, in part because portions of the trial transcript have been sealed—test-makers didn&#39;t want their proprietary materials being made public. But in the available sections of the transcript, the prosecution&#39;s expert witness, Frank Landy, a professor of industrial psychology at Penn State, did discuss a few NTE questions that he found particularly problematic. One apparently asked test-takers to look at a performance stage and speculate about why its designer had created it in such an “unadorned” way. Another concerned the splitting of the hemispheres of the brain, which Landy said would require a sophisticated understanding of “neurophysiology and neuroanatomy” and had “multiple correct answers.” Some test-takers were presented with a picture of the cadet chapel of the Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs and asked about its aesthetic purpose. Landy visited the Academy&#39;s Web site looking for an answer, and found that none of the multiple-choice options listed on the test matched the explanation the Academy gave.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;During the trial, Landy argued that people&#39;s experiences and knowledge are always shaped by race. “If I grew up in New York, would I go to &lt;em >;MoMA&lt;/em>; and the Metropolitan Opera and the Metropolitan Museum and listen to NPR?”他说。 “I&#39;m a 60-year-old Irish Catholic. I look at things a particular way, whether I want to or not.” In a conversation with me, Joshua Sohn, the lead attorney for the plaintiffs, recalled that on the &lt;em >;LAST&lt;/em>;, teachers were asked to explain the meaning of Andy Warhol&#39;s famous soup-can paintings. He questioned why a kindergarten special-education teacher or a Spanish teacher needs to know this; in his view, it&#39;s not a meaningful measure of how well they can do their jobs. But the question also gets to the heart of the case: “The further away the test gets from evaluating basic skills—reading, writing, math—the more likely it is to have some type of difference performance by group,” Sohn told me. “It necessarily tests culture.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;The plaintiffs&#39; ultimate argument is not that white people know about Andy Warhol and Black people don&#39;t. It&#39;s that asking experienced teachers to correctly interpret the meaning of soup cans is not actually job-related—it&#39;s closer to a poll test than a carefully considered question of competency.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Earlier this year, the Supreme Court &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/07/10/the-end-of-affirmative-action&quot;>;banned race-based affirmative action&lt;/a>; in college admissions. This reopened old debates over tests such as the SAT and ACT and whether they disproportionately favor white and Asian applicants. And yet, these debates about race and higher education focus on the end of a long pipeline. Years before recent high-school seniors prepared to take college-entrance exams, their teachers all had to take tests, too—tests that have sometimes been found by the courts to illegally disadvantage minority groups.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;There&#39;s an extensive history of states using licensure exams, sometimes intentionally, to keep Black educators out of classrooms following Brown v. Board. In the seventies, as Southern states reluctantly desegregated their schools, Black teachers and the National Education Association, a teachers&#39; union, believed that state officials deliberately used the NTE to make it less likely that Black teachers would obtain certification. This was primarily achieved through cutoff scores—the score someone needed to get on the test in order to pass, which was determined by state officials and varied from place to place. According to research by Leslie Fenwick, a professor of education policy at Howard, these scores have often been set slightly above the average pass rate for Black test-takers. In a quote from a 1970 report, the program director for the NTE warned, “You can build the best test available . 。 。 but if there&#39;s malice in somebody&#39;s heart, it can be used to eliminate Blacks.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In the eighties, Black teachers successfully sued the state of Alabama for using teacher-certification tests that were culturally biased and had an adverse effect on racial minorities. In a report she authored, Fenwick described the introduction in the nineties of the Praxis I, now called the Praxis Core—a broad-based skills test required in some states, often for college students interested in becoming teachers—as a disaster for her education department at a historically Black college in Atlanta. Suddenly, instead of bustling hallways, the department struggled to recruit teacher candidates. Black students had lower pass rates on the Praxis I than white students, and failing this test meant that they were cut off from trying to become teachers before they had even started. The test shrunk the whole Black-teacher pipeline.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;lzc7i&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;5zrx2d&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Racially disparate pass rates on aptitude tests aren&#39;t just a problem for aspiring teachers. The ACT, the SAT, the &lt;em >;LSAT&lt;/em>;, the &lt;em >;MCAT&lt;/em>;—Black students do worse than white students on nearly every prominent precollege and preprofessional test. To Fenwick, the problem lies with test-makers: “If all those tests, including teacher tests, are showing that there are racial disparities that have a practical significance in terms of who we allow into professions,” she said, “you need to update your tests.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;And yet there&#39;s a lot of disagreement among experts about this question—whether the tests are inherently flawed, or whether they just reflect society&#39;s deeper problems with race. “I don&#39;t think it&#39;s surprising that we see a disparate impact on test performance,” said Dan Goldhaber, a professor at the University of Washington whom another scholar described as “the doyen” of researchers in this area. “There is inequality in society. And one of the ways that manifests is with different educational outcomes.” Heather Peske, the president of the National Council on Teacher Quality (NCTQ), pointed out that disparate pass rates may reflect the racial inequalities of K-12 schooling—all aspiring teachers were once students themselves, and lots of evidence suggests that racial and ethnic minorities aren&#39;t doing as well in American schools as white students. “The idea that because there are disparate pass rates, it somehow means that the instrument itself is biased—I take issue with that as a premise,” Peske said. When it comes to teachers who don&#39;t pass the test, “we haven&#39;t provided test-takers of color with the content knowledge that they need to go and be successful with students. And that&#39;s really problematic for many reasons.” It&#39;s a vicious cycle: Black and Latino students are more likely to attend failing schools, where research shows they&#39;re more likely to be placed with teachers who are uncertified or still in training. Some of these kids will grow up to want to be teachers, but they may have trouble passing the tests they need to enter the profession. That will mean fewer Black and Latino teachers in classrooms. Research strongly suggests that when Black students, in particular, learn from teachers who look like them, they do better in school, take more advanced courses, and are more likely to graduate from high school and college.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;There&#39;s another weak link in that cycle, one that can be politically touchy to talk about: teachers&#39; colleges. According to the NCTQ, most teacher-training programs don&#39;t even require applicants to have a GPA of 3.0 or above, the equivalent of a B average. Once aspiring teachers enter their programs, they don&#39;t necessarily learn what they need to prepare students: only a quarter of elementary-school teacher-training programs address all the components of scientifically based reading instruction, and another quarter don&#39;t teach scientifically based reading methods at all. Graduate programs for elementary-school teachers often emphasize math pedagogy over math content, even though many teachers feel unprepared to instruct students in basic concepts. Many programs don&#39;t give teachers in training enough opportunities for clinical practice in classrooms. And teacher-training programs are overwhelmingly whiter than the campuses where they&#39;re housed. Many well-meaning policymakers have suggested that having “a more diverse teacher workforce necessarily depends on lowering the standards for who can become a teacher,” according to a report by the NCTQ (In an e-mail, a spokesperson for the New York State Education Department said that “creating more inclusive opportunities for more New Yorkers to enter the teaching field should not be viewed as lowering standards, and any attempt to draw that conclusion is baseless and abhorrent.”)&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;r35trj&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Still, Peske told me, “we run the risk of perpetuating the inequities that presently exist in our K-12 education system.” In her view, that&#39;s where licensure tests come in: they measure everyone the same way, even when they come out of programs of wildly varying quality. “Licensure tests serve as important guardrails on content knowledge of teachers,” Peske continued. “When we take these shortcuts in preparing teachers and insuring that they have knowledge and skills, it costs everyone, and, most of all, it costs the students.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Goldhaber pointed out that, in the debate over licensure tests, “there&#39;s a lot of options besides have exams or don&#39;t have exams.” For example, states can adjust or get rid of cutoff scores for teacher tests. Instead of making the test an up-or-down measure of whether someone can enter the profession, their score could be one piece of information a district may or may not use in hiring. Many states, including New York, also require certain teachers to pass subject-area exams—high-school chemistry teachers have to prove they know chemistry, for example. These subject-specific tests raise far fewer objections from educators who criticize the racial impacts of general-knowledge tests, in part because the disparities in outcomes are less pronounced.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Not all test alternatives are equally good. In 2014, New York began requiring teacher candidates to take the edT.PA, an extensive assessment that focusses on their performance in the classroom, drawing on sample lesson plans and materials, written narratives about their experiences, and video samples of their teaching. A few years later, the state lowered the passing score for the test; Black test-takers were nearly twice as likely to fail the edT.PA as white or Hispanic test-takers, according to an analysis done by Chalkbeat. Last year, the state got rid of the edT.PA altogether. New York State United Teachers, a federation of unions that represents a huge number of teachers in the state, hailed the move, citing reports from students and educators who “said completing the edT.PA was so consuming and stressful that it ruined the student teaching experience.” Teacher candidates in New York no longer have to take a broad-based knowledge or practical exam; starting this fall, their preparation programs will be primarily responsible for evaluating whether they&#39;re ready to be in a classroom. Goldhaber was skeptical of this approach. Teachers&#39; colleges have “pretty strong financial incentives not to tell somebody who is pursuing a teaching career, &#39;Sorry, we don&#39;t think you&#39;re going to make it,&#39; ” he said. “Those kinds of institutional incentives make me think that very few people would be ruled out.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;David Steiner, a former New York State commissioner of education and current professor of education at Johns Hopkins, said that most teachers&#39; colleges are fundamentally mismatched to the profession, focussing on traditional academic research and publishing over clinical classroom prep—he called the clinical training “pretty hopeless.” In the face of a severe nationwide teacher shortage and a disproportionately white teacher pipeline, “it&#39;s much, much easier to do a chase to the bottom, to rationalize the removal of almost any gateway, in the name of attracting a more diverse teaching force.”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;jmf5h&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;i0yo7e&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Like everyone else I spoke with, Steiner acknowledged that teacher-licensing exams have disparate racial pass rates, and he pointed out significant flaws in the edT.PA that, in his mind, could justify New York&#39;s decision to end its use, such as an emphasis on writing about teaching over actual teaching experience. But, ultimately, he said, “you can&#39;t design a test around teaching methods if you can&#39;t agree on what actually counts as effective.” America doesn&#39;t just have a problem with a lack of teachers and a lack of teacher diversity. “We can&#39;t agree on what good teaching is in the first place,” Steiner said. “And that&#39;s something no one will talk about.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In her finding against New York City, Judge Wood noted that the makers of the &lt;em >;LAST&lt;/em>; never compiled a list of the tasks that teachers are supposed to perform, nor did they try to figure out whether the knowledge tested on the &lt;em >;LAST&lt;/em>; was relevant to those tasks. Although this reasoning is important in court, it seems to miss something fundamental about education. Teachers are not garbagemen or accountants, charged with discrete, concrete duties. Their job is much broader, and more subtle: to fill students&#39; minds and equip them to venture out into the world.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;New York has cycled through at least four licensure exams since the late nineteen-eighties, always eventually dropping them. But it&#39;s not clear that any of these changes have actually improved students&#39; education. Since the pandemic, New York State has tumbled in the national ranking of performance in reading and math for fourth graders. This past school year, only half of New York City&#39;s third-to-eighth graders achieved proficient reading scores, and among Black and Latino students, that figure was closer to forty per cent. Schaeffer, of FairTest, has come to view teacher-licensing exams as nothing more than performative symbols—something for states and unions to point to in order to prove that teachers actually know something. “They&#39;re like the talisman that you wore around your neck in the Middle Ages to ward off the plague,” he said, paraphrasing &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.3102/0091732X014001169&quot;>;an old article&lt;/a>; about flaws in testing. “The evidence for their efficacy is weak and self-serving.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Even if states could devise the perfect test for teachers, fewer and fewer people are entering the profession. The pay isn&#39;t great: the Census Bureau reports that teachers make less on average than their peers with the same education level, and teacher pay has fallen over all since 2010. The pandemic made a difficult profession harder: reports of mental-health crises, unmanageable classrooms, and staggering &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/essay/whos-left-out-of-the-learning-loss-debate&quot;>;learning loss&lt;/a>; are everywhere.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;All this has primed the field of education for an anti-test moment. “Because of this shortage of teachers, we&#39;re going to have to become more creative about how we identify who could be a good teacher,” Pedro Noguera, the dean of the School of Education at the University of Southern California, said. “Several people over the years, myself included, have been arguing that you can&#39;t simply rely on a test.” Schaeffer described the opposition to testing culture—from licensure exams to student evaluations that affect teachers&#39; bonuses and performance reviews—as “widespread” within teachers&#39; colleges.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In recent years, thousands of teachers who failed the &lt;em >;LAST&lt;/em>; have received compensation for damages. Some of these people remained in education—maybe they moved to New Jersey, where testing cutoff scores were lower, or stuck with lower-paying substitute-teacher positions in New York. After a few years in limbo, Wilds-Bethea finally got a guidance-counsellor job at a school—what he had always wanted, anyway. Because of previous litigation, guidance counsellors were considered social-services employees, not teachers, so he was exempt from the &lt;em >;LAST&lt;/em>; requirement and could regain a full-time position with benefits. He had a long career working in New York City public schools and retired in 2016. He lives in Harlem, neighboring some of his former students, in a sun-filled apartment with a terrace covered in plants overlooking City College, where he got his teaching degree. The testing saga didn&#39;t completely derail his career. But he knows plenty of teachers whose lives truly changed: people who lost their houses or their pensions, or who couldn&#39;t afford to put kids through college.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Wilds-Bethea still hasn&#39;t seen any money from the lawsuit; litigation over each individual payout is ongoing. Given that he worked in New York City public schools for many years while the litigation was ongoing, though, the amount is likely to be large. Ultimately, he sees the whole thing as a tragedy. “I think the money could have been much better spent improving our schools,” he said. “That&#39;s kind of painful, too.” He wishes that all those years ago, the city would have granted an exemption to already licensed teachers and avoided the lawsuit, along with the billions it will cost the city. Kids won&#39;t see any of that money, but lawyers will. So far, the plaintiffs have been awarded at least $57.2 million in attorneys&#39; fees. Sohn, the lead lawyer in the case, defended the need to resolve this dispute in court: “When I started this case, I thought that we could make people do the right thing. And it&#39;s become really clear that we can just make them stop doing the wrong thing,” he said. That&#39;s “an incredible service to our communities.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Now some of these plaintiffs will have their lives changed once again because of a test. Payouts in the one-to-two-million range are not unheard of. The judgment also gives some plaintiffs a path to restoring their licenses to teach in New York City. These plaintiffs will have the chance to start over, but they may not want to take it. Many of them are well past the age when they might want to begin a new chapter of their career. As one of Wilds-Bethea&#39;s Committee bulletins put it, years ago, “Many of the teachers affected are enthusiastic young people who have come to our profession with a great deal of energy and idealism. They want to do a good job and are being cut off before they even start.” ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;iovg1&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 31 Oct 2023 19:06:01 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[What the U.A.W.

After making deals with Ford and Stellantis last week, UAW leaders reached a tentative agreement with General Motors on Monday, opening the way for a full return to work. Although some details of the agreements haven&#39;t yet been made public, it&#39;s clear that the UAW has achieved a historic victory for its members. Capitalizing on the industry&#39;s high profits, a tight labor market, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/10/09/biden-trump-and-whats-at-stake-in-the-uaw-strike&quot;>;support from President Biden&lt;/a>;, the union forced the Big Three automakers to make big concessions not just on wage rates but in other areas, too.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Shawn Fain, the leader of the UAW, has hailed the outcome of the strike as a major win for the entire labor movement, and he&#39;s right. Like the recent deals between &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/how-ups-and-the-teamsters-staved-off-a-strike-for-now&quot;>;the Teamsters and UPS&lt;/a>;, health-care workers and Kaiser Permanente, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/notes-on-hollywood/joy-in-los-angeles-as-the-writers-reach-a-tentative-deal&quot;>;the Writers Guild and the Hollywood studios&lt;/a>;, the tentative agreement between the UAW and the Big Three has demonstrated that, even in the fissured and outsourced economy of the twenty-first century, organized labor can still wield considerable power, especially in favorable economic conditions. That isn&#39;t a surprise to anybody familiar with labor history, but it is a lesson that in recent decades has often been lost, or deliberately obscured.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Going into the strike, the media attention focussed on four of the UAW&#39;s basic demands: sharply higher wages, including the restoration of automatic cost-of-living adjustments; the elimination of a two-tier pay system that was introduced more than fifteen years ago ago; a pathway to unionize new electric-vehicle plants; and the restoration of defined pensions and health insurance for union retirees. In the first three areas, the union appears to have achieved what it wanted. Only in the area of retiree benefits did the auto companies manage to hold the line.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Under the new labor contract with Ford, which served as the model for the agreements with Stellantis and GM, fully vested production-line workers will receive cumulative hourly pay increases of about twenty-seven per cent, and some members of skilled trades will receive raises of more than thirty per cent. All union members will also receive annual cost-of-living adjustments based on the rate of consumer-price inflation. Taken together, these provisions will raise the top hourly wages of Ford production workers from $32.05 to $42.60 in the course of the contract, which will run until 2028, and the hourly wages of skilled workers from $36.96 to $50.97, the union said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The agreement will also shorten the time it takes for new hires to be paid full wages. Under a two-tier pay system that was introduced in 2007, newer Ford workers received roughly half as much pay as older workers, and it took them eight years to make up the difference. Going forward, new hires will be paid eighty-five per cent of the top rate after two years, and a hundred per cent after three years. Between now and October, 2025, according to the union, some Ford workers will see their hourly wages double under this provision.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Given that last year GM and Ford each made more than ten billion dollars in operating income, it was always going to be difficult for them to resist the UAW&#39;s wage demands. What is perhaps more surprising is the companies&#39; willingness to make concessions on unionizing the electric-vehicle plants that are key to the industry&#39;s future. According to UAW leadership, the agreement with Ford will enable the union to organize workers at a new battery plant that the automaker is building in Marshall, Michigan, and at a new EV plant in Tennessee that is a joint venture with a South Korean electric-battery company, SK Innovation. In addition, workers at existing plants, which mainly make vehicles and components for vehicles powered by internal-combustion engines, will have opportunities to switch to electric-vehicle plants.&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;In the area of retirement benefits, Ford agreed to increase its 401(k) contributions to roughly ten per cent for older workers, but the new contract doesn&#39;t include the restoration of a defined-benefit pension and retiree health insurance for all employees. This wasn&#39;t really surprising. In 2009, the hefty cost of retirement benefits was one of the factors that prompted GM and Chrysler to file for bankruptcy protection. The current management of the auto companies is extremely reluctant to restore the old system.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;On this issue, Fain and his members didn&#39;t prevail. Taken over all, though, the new contracts vindicated the aggressive but deliberate strategy of the fiftysomething UAW leader, who was only elected to his post earlier this year. Rather than calling all his members out on strike at once, Fain targeted individual plants that were particularly important to the auto companies. This tactic caught the companies “flat footed and proved to be very effective,” Marick Masters, a professor of business at Wayne State University, told me. “The companies knew they were going to have to raise their employment costs significantly, but I think they ended up raising them considerably more than they would have liked to.”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;rmpl6b&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;i3c0mf&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Over the weekend, Bob Lutz, a former president of Chrysler, claimed that the new contracts could seriously undermine the future prospects of the Big Three. “In the past, the UAW always had a realistic respect for the needs of an automobile company to stay competitive,” Lutz said, in a radio interview. “This time, they did not.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;That remains to be seen. According to Ford, the agreement will increase its costs by about eight hundred and fifty dollars to nine hundred dollars per vehicle. At a time when the average selling price of new cars has risen to about forty-eight thousand dollars, the automaker would appear to have ample room to prosper.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;However, like GM and Stellantis, Ford makes most of its profits selling gas-guzzling SUVs and trucks, which may not exist a decade from now. Far down in the UAW&#39;s information sheet on the Ford deal is a line relating to the agreement about unionization efforts at the company&#39;s new Marshall battery plant: “Special provisions regarding operational flexibility will be negotiated based on the unique circumstances of the manufacturing operations.” In other words, EVs represent a new production model for the auto industry, and many details of this model are still to be worked out at a time when competition from Tesla and foreign-owned auto companies is intensifying. “The big question and the big challenge ahead is still the same—and that is whether these American companies are going to survive the transition to electric vehicles,” Masters said. Unions and management at the Big Three will be back at the bargaining table again soon enough. In the meantime, the workers have secured a good deal. ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;pmiv&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 31 Oct 2023 09:06:01 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[The Plight of the Hostages and the Rapidly Escalating Crisis in Gaza]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-plight-of-the-hostages-and-the-rapidly-escalating-crisis-in-gaza]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-30T22:10:16.567Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653fe64c4ce592daa8951346/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Coll-Israeli-Hostages.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;article >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attribute-verso-pattern=&quot;article-body&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;ArticlePageChunks&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;The Hostages and Missing Families Forum, an umbrella volunteer group formed by relatives, friends, and experts soon after the October 7th attack in Israel, &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://stories.bringthemhomenow.net/&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://stories.bringthemhomenow.net/&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://stories.bringthemhomenow.net/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;maintains a ticking clock&lt;/a>; on its Web site, to count the days, hours, and seconds since Hamas and allied militants seized what the Israeli military believes to be more than two hundred and thirty Israeli and international hostages, who are presumably being held in Gaza. The more the clock ticks, the more urgent are the pleas from the hostages&#39; families and their allies that Prime Minister &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tag/benjamin-netanyahu&quot;>;Benjamin Netanyahu&lt;/a>; and his war cabinet prioritize the hostages&#39; safe return. Over the weekend, protesters—including many family members—camped outside the defense ministry headquarters in Tel Aviv. On Saturday, Netanyahu met with family members, and on Sunday, the defense minister, Yoav Gallant, held his first official consultation with hostage relatives since the crisis began more than three weeks ago. “We are not waiting any longer,” Malki Shem-Tov, a protester whose son Omer was seized on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/11/06/israel-gaza-war-hamas&quot;>;October 7th&lt;/a>;, said, according to &lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-war-hostages-families-netanyahu-gallant-49b39b3d43cc263b872191874e2d69fa&quot;>;the Associated Press&lt;/a>;. “We want you, the Cabinet, the government, to imagine that these are your children.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;That pleading captured the pain and the moral complexity that often permeates hostage crises. Israel, tragically, has had experience with many such cases in Gaza and Lebanon, as well as with international hostage crises arising out of hijackings and other terrorist attacks, such as the seizure and killing of Israeli athletes at the 1972 Olympics, in Munich. At times, Israel has negotiated lopsided prisoner exchanges to free its captives. In 2006, Hamas kidnapped Gilad Shalit, an Israeli soldier, and held him in Gaza; five years later, the militant group freed him in exchange for more than a thousand Palestinian prisoners who had been held by Israel. Yet none of these past cases can offer easy guidance for how to handle the unprecedented &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/dispatch/the-devastation-of-beeri&quot;>;mass kidnapping&lt;/a>; of October 7th. Never before has Israel sought to rescue so many hostages from a territory where it is also waging an unbridled aerial war that has already claimed &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-uprooting-of-life-in-gaza-and-the-west-bank&quot;>;thousands of civilian lives&lt;/a>;—a campaign that Israel is now apparently escalating with a ground invasion.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The newspaper &lt;em>;Haaretz&lt;/em>; weighed in over the weekend with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.haaretz.com/opinion/editorial/2023-10-29/ty-article/israels-hostages-are-running-out-of-time-and-their-families-are-sick-of-slogans/0000018b-77c3-d1da-a1bb-7ffb0e430000&quot;>;an impassioned editorial&lt;/a>; arguing that “there is no question more burning” than whether Israel&#39;s attacks on Gaza will endanger the hostages. “The state does not have the mandate to sacrifice” the hostages, the editorial said, and “no one would give it that mandate. Nor can it be allowed to consciously, for tactical reasons, make these people collateral damage in the war against Hamas.” It urged Israel to “release all its Palestinian security prisoners”—who are thought to number about forty-five hundred—in exchange for the captives seized by Hamas and its allies, or to do “whatever it takes to bring the hostages home immediately.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;On Saturday, Gallant told a news conference that the problem was “very complex” and argued that only intense attacks by Israel would force Hamas to negotiate. “The more military pressure, the more firepower and the more we strike Hamas, the greater our chances are to bring it to a place where it will agree to a solution that will allow the return of your loved ones,” Gallant said. The oxymoronic strategy of bombing enemies to the negotiating table does not often work as designed, and, in the case of the Gaza war, Gallant&#39;s logic seems especially strained. An obvious reason is that intensifying combat may directly kill or injure hostages, or provide a ready cover story for Hamas to execute captives while claiming that they died under Israeli bombs. (According to Gaza&#39;s health ministry, which is controlled by Hamas, more than eight thousand people have been killed by Israel in Gaza so far, including thousands of children.) Last Thursday, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-67248317&quot;>;according to the BBC&lt;/a>;, Abu Ubaida, a spokesman for Hamas&#39;s military wing, said that about fifty hostages had already been killed in air strikes. More broadly, the coercive part of coercive diplomacy would seem to already be well established: as Israel decimates Gaza in one of the most intensely concentrated air attacks ever seen in the Middle East, Israel has repeatedly stated that one of its war aims is to destroy Hamas and kill the group&#39;s commanders. We can assume by now that they have got the message.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;So far, only five hostages have been freed: two Americans and three Israeli women, one of whom, Yocheved Lifshitz, an eighty-five-year-old grandmother, told reporters that she “went through hell” as she was beaten with sticks while being marched toward the vast network of underground tunnels built by Hamas. Necessarily, the international diplomacy under way to release more prisoners is opaque; Egypt, Qatar, and the International Committee of the Red Cross appear to be involved as mediators or facilitators. The United Nations Secretary-General, António Guterres, is among the world leaders who have called for a ceasefire in Gaza, in order to deliver humanitarian aid, and for the release of the hostages.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;The relatives of the hostages, while maintaining consensus within their ad-hoc coalition of the traumatized, have been careful not to tell Netanyahu or the Israel Defense Forces how to resolve the kidnappings—only to get the job done. On Saturday, Abu Ubaida &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/hamas-demands-all-palestinian-security-prisoners-be-freed-in-exchange-for-enemy-hostages/&quot;>;demanded the release&lt;/a>; of all Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli custody, in return for “the large number of enemy hostages in our hands.” That would be a hard call, politically and militarily, for the Israeli war cabinet. (Yahya Sinwar, the leader of Hamas in Gaza, &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/byhxaccst&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/byhxaccst&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/byhxaccst&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;was released&lt;/a>; as part of the exchange that freed Shalit.) Yet, as has often been observed during past crises, for many Israeli Jews, the fate of prisoners and hostages has involved more than the suffering of individuals and families—at issue, also, are ideas about collective sacrifice and the state&#39;s moral duties. As &lt;em>;Haaretz&lt;/em>; argued directly, “The government must declare the hostages&#39; return to be its most important goal.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;The United States has faced its own such dilemmas with a rising frequency in the past decade, as state-sponsored hostage-taking increased in countries such as Russia and China, and kidnappings soared in areas beset by armed conflict involving Islamist radicals and criminal gangs, such as in Syria and Afghanistan. After 9/11, as Al Qaeda-linked groups emerged in Africa and the Mahgreb, kidnappings forced Western governments to rethink public policy. For years, some European governments routinely paid ransoms to groups such as Al Qaeda, but the United States firmly refused, and the US government even warned the families of kidnapping victims that if they themselves paid the ransoms, they might violate antiterrorism laws. The Obama Administration undertook reforms to better prioritize the interests of families, yet these carefully balanced policies can have an air of think-tank abstraction about them. The crisis now facing Israel and its allies, including the Biden Administration, belongs to its own category.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;It is unclear whether the leaders of Hamas, which has already been designated as a terrorist group by the US, the United Kingdom, and the European Union, have come to think that their cruel and indiscriminate mass hostage-taking may be a potential liability, as they maneuver for political survival under Israel&#39;s assault. As a practical matter, would Hamas even accept the release of all Palestinian prisoners in Israeli detention, or is its offer only intended as a salvo in the information war, to further divide Israeli opinion about how to conduct the war? If Hamas did seek a deal, could it actually deliver the safe release of all of its captives? Even the trading of small numbers of prisoners in contested territory during war can present a daunting problem of trust, communication, and on-the-ground execution, as armed parties to the deal stand by, alert to any sign of betrayal. Managing such a release in Gaza now, even if Israel were to declare a temporary ceasefire to facilitate it, would be an extraordinary feat.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Yet such an exchange might turn the Gaza war away from its catastrophic, dead-end course, at least for a time. Among other things, it would salve at least some of Israel&#39;s trauma and strengthen international political negotiation as an instrument in conflict. It might create greater space—including political space within Israel—to support other managed humanitarian interventions, to relieve the suffering of Gaza&#39;s trapped civilians.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Why this offensive? There is no rush. Hamas wasn&#39;t going anywhere,” Zeev Scherman, one of the family members who was protesting near Israel&#39;s Ministry of Defense, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/28/is-there-a-plan-families-of-israeli-hostages-demand-answers-from-netanyahu&quot;>;told the &lt;em>;Guardian&lt;/em>;&lt;/a>; last weekend. Another protester nearby held up a handmade sign: “Life matters.” ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;qlnzo&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot;

(Concurrent with its publication, there is a series at Film Forum, “50 from the &#39;50s,” with Hirsch on hand to introduce some screenings.) Hirsch presents a panorama of the film industry at the time, anchored in the economic struggles that the studios were facing. The rise of television was drastically reducing moviegoing, and a federal antitrust suit (decided in 1948) had forced studios to divest themselves of movie theatres, a development that deprived them of guaranteed revenue. Hirsch&#39;s account goes into fascinating detail on how studios were forced to reconsider their modes of production, the new technology they employed in doing so, and the internecine battles that these shifts entailed. He looks at the political and social conflicts that the movies confronted and the ones they skirted, the rise of a new generation of stars and the varied fates of long-established ones, and the widely varied artistry of filmmakers who found themselves working in a newly unstable system.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Hirsch writes himself into the story. Having been born in 1943, he is in a position to reminisce about his childhood and adolescent moviegoing experiences in a way that complements both his research and his critical assessments. The result is a kind of firsthand sociology, in which moviegoing is treated as an &lt;em>;experience&lt;/em>;, of which the movie itself is only a part. He also considers how his views of movies of the fifties have changed since then, and the way in which that shift of perspective inescapably, though often tacitly, shapes his narrative of how the decade unfolded. He discusses the wider culture of the time, finding in fifties America “the seeds of the counterculture revolution that erupted in the late 1960s,” with movies as a vital part of that trend.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“The American film industry in the dying days of the studio system adopted a go-for-broke, let&#39;s-try-anything approach,” Hirsch writes, noting that this yielded some strange masterworks and a “portfolio of dark genres” that is “notably robust.” He praises many good and often overlooked films—including Robert Aldrich&#39;s “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/goings-on-about-town/movies/autumn-leaves&quot;>;Autumn Leaves&lt;/a>;,” Joseph H. Lewis&#39;s “Terror in a Texas Town,” and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/vincente-minnelli-at-bam&quot;>;Vincente Minnelli&lt;/a>;&#39;s “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/goings-on-about-town/movies/the-cobweb&quot;>;The Cobweb&lt;/a>;”—and explores idiosyncratic genres, such as ancient-world epics and low-budget sci-fi. When Hirsch is passionate about a movie, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/douglas-sirks-glorious-cinema-of-outsiders&quot;>;Douglas Sirk&lt;/a>;&#39;s “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/goings-on-about-town/movies/imitation-of-life&quot;>;Imitation of Life&lt;/a>;,” his fervor is matched by eloquence and an eye for detail. Indeed, his chapter on melodramas, with its long discussion of Sirk&#39;s extraordinary run of them, is the most moving part of the book. Hirsch notes that Sirk&#39;s films “were generally derided as kitschy soap operas aimed at gullible female spectators in the mood for a good cry. Although the films were box-office successes, they earned little or no critical respect; in the decades since their original release, however, the Sirk melodramas have undergone the greatest critical revaluation of any golden-age fare.” (Maybe, but I think the revaluation that has propelled Alfred Hitchcock&#39;s “Vertigo” to the title of the best film of all time might be even more drastic.)&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;GenericCallout&quot;>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;Judy Garland performing in “A Star Is Born.”&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653beb716e205727eb7686d7/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/ATHC-A-Star-Is-Born-Judy-Garland-1.png&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653beb716e205727eb7686d7/master/w_120,c_limit/ATHC-A-Star-Is-Born-Judy-Garland-1.png 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653beb716e205727eb7686d7/master/w_240,c_limit/ATHC-A-Star-Is-Born-Judy-Garland-1.png 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653beb716e205727eb7686d7/master/w_320,c_limit/ATHC-A-Star-Is-Born-Judy-Garland-1.png 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653beb716e205727eb7686d7/master/w_640,c_limit/ATHC-A-Star-Is-Born-Judy-Garland-1.png 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653beb716e205727eb7686d7/master/w_960,c_limit/ATHC-A-Star-Is-Born-Judy-Garland-1.png 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653beb716e205727eb7686d7/master/w_1280,c_limit/ATHC-A-Star-Is-Born-Judy-Garland-1.png 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653beb716e205727eb7686d7/master/w_1600,c_limit/ATHC-A-Star-Is-Born-Judy-Garland-1.png 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;Judy Garland in “A Star Is Born.”&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Hirsch rightly foregrounds the essentially countercultural power of nineteen-fifties movies and their enduring influence. But something is missing from the thesis; namely, a consideration of the personalities of the artists whose work has been reëvaluated and canonized—that is to say, directors. Hirsch is a writer of two minds. He&#39;s no stranger to the art of directing; he has written a good book about Otto Preminger. But, in “Hollywood and the Movies of the Fifties,” the sense of directors as expressive artists is diluted amid a historicist account of industry developments, technological advances, and economic and political history. Emphasizing the careers and box-office fortunes of stars, Hirsch discusses Nicholas Ray&#39;s Western “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-front-row/johnny-guitar-one-of-the-greatest-westerns-and-the-furthest-extreme-of-the-hollywood-system&quot;>;Johnny Guitar&lt;/a>;” as a Joan Crawford film, Ray&#39;s inside-Hollywood drama “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/goings-on-about-town/movies/in-a-lonely-place&quot;>;In a Lonely Place&lt;/a>;” as a Humphrey Bogart film, and Ray&#39;s teen drama “Rebel Without a Cause” as a James Dean vehicle. But he pays little regard to what makes all three of them Nicholas Ray movies. (Ray&#39;s hectic medical melodrama “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/goings-on-about-town/movies/bigger-than-life&quot;>;Bigger Than Life&lt;/a>;” is mentioned with no reference to Ray at all.) Though there is praise for directors such as Aldrich, Minnelli, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/being-frank&quot;>;Frank Tashlin&lt;/a>;, it usually appears fleetingly, in discussion of whatever films are germane to the historical topic at hand. He does the same with George Cukor, and gives short shrift to his direction of the furious 1954 remake “A Star Is Born.” Even with the most eminent Hollywood figures—Alfred Hitchcock, Howard Hawks, and John Ford—discussion of their films is dispersed, their art never considered in its unity. As for Jacques Tourneur, one of Hollywood&#39;s most distinctive stylists and politically confrontational directors of the fifties, he&#39;s not mentioned at all.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;It&#39;s not that Hirsch is indifferent to good directorial work. He enthuses about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/the-films-of-allan-dwan&quot;>;Allan Dwan&lt;/a>;&#39;s ferocious political Western “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/movie-of-the-week-silver-lode&quot;>;Silver Lode&lt;/a>;,” Ida Lupino&#39;s romantic melodrama “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/goings-on-about-town/movies/the-films-of-ida-lupino&quot;>;The Bigamist&lt;/a>;,” and Hawks&#39;s much-maligned period spectacle “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2007/06/25/a-clash-of-symbols&quot;>;Land of the Pharaohs&lt;/a>;.” But he doesn&#39;t put these careers, or his own appreciation of them, into historical perspective. Though he exults in the eventual revaluation of Sirk, he doesn&#39;t point out that similar belated critical adulation came to Dwan, Minnelli, and a slew of other studio directors. For instance, “Silver Lode,” at the time of its release, in 1954, was brazenly mocked in the &lt;em>;Times&lt;/em>; as “a meaningless sort of charade” that “will probably inspire the kiddies to buy more caps for their six-shooters for a while.” “Johnny Guitar” came in for misogynistic derision in this magazine. As for “Vertigo,” &lt;a href=&quot;https://content.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,863527,00.html&quot;>;&lt;em>;Time&lt;/em>; magazine called it&lt;/a>;, at the time of its release, a “Hitchcock-and-bull story in which the mystery is not so much who done it as who cares.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;An examination of why films and filmmakers derided or overlooked in their time are celebrated now—by Hirsch and by cinephiles at large—is an essential element of any assessment of Hollywood&#39;s nineteen-fifties output. But this long-term, large-scale reconsideration remains unacknowledged in his book. Even as Hirsch alludes to his own changing appraisals of movies, there&#39;s a critical shift that he leaves out concerning the way that movies are now appreciated and discussed, the way that new canons and pantheons among them are formed. It&#39;s a shift that has its roots in the very movies Hirsch is discussing, and which conspicuously shapes his choice of films to discuss and his mode of discussing them. For that matter, it&#39;s what creates demand for a book such as this one—a book about Hollywood in the fifties that is not a specialist monograph or nostalgic wallow but a wide-ranging critical history that can uncontroversially celebrate the best of these movies as key works of modern art.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;GenericCallout&quot;>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;Juanita Moore and Sandra Dee in a scene from the 1959 film IMITATION OF LIFE&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653beb71150b10556523731f/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/2R7P3KCAKII6LHFUCZ2GLSVCEU.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653beb71150b10556523731f/master/w_120,c_limit/2R7P3KCAKII6LHFUCZ2GLSVCEU.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653beb71150b10556523731f/master/w_240,c_limit/2R7P3KCAKII6LHFUCZ2GLSVCEU.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653beb71150b10556523731f/master/w_320,c_limit/2R7P3KCAKII6LHFUCZ2GLSVCEU.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653beb71150b10556523731f/master/w_640,c_limit/2R7P3KCAKII6LHFUCZ2GLSVCEU.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653beb71150b10556523731f/master/w_960,c_limit/2R7P3KCAKII6LHFUCZ2GLSVCEU.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653beb71150b10556523731f/master/w_1280,c_limit/2R7P3KCAKII6LHFUCZ2GLSVCEU.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653beb71150b10556523731f/master/w_1600,c_limit/2R7P3KCAKII6LHFUCZ2GLSVCEU.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;Juanita Moore and Sandra Dee in “Imitation of Life.”&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Something tectonic was happening in fifties Hollywood, but it was nearly undetectable up close; most American critics couldn&#39;t see the trees for the forest, missed the mighty art of individual films and filmmakers because of their inextricable Hollywood roots. A decade ago, I threw together &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/macdonald-and-movies&quot;>;a casual cornucopia&lt;/a>; of great fifties Hollywood directors; if I were doing it again today, in light of subsequent viewings, I might need two cornucopias. The fifties was a golden age of daring and original direction—but it was also largely unrecognized, in part, because of historical trends that Hirsch details. Intellectual disdain for Hollywood remained high, for a variety of reasons. There was the spinelessness of studios during the McCarthy era—the alacrity with which, caving to pressure from Congress and right-wing groups, they went about blacklisting politically suspect writers, directors, and actors. There was an increase in technology-fuelled spectacle—part of a frenzied effort to compete with television—with such gewgaws as 3-D, various wide-screen formats, and stereo sound. No new technique is intrinsically dubious and each is a potential boon to artists, but, at the time, the hasty and ballyhooed deployment reeked of brazen commercialism. The result was that Hollywood sold its gems as costume jewelry, not through mercenary cynicism but because the studio potentates were no more aware of the enduring art being produced under their aegis than were critics or, for that matter, viewers.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Against this background, there was a remarkable liberation of directors in Hollywood. The phenomenon was partly industrial, a result of the weakening of the studio system and the corresponding rise of independent producers. It was partly migrational; the rise of Hitler and the Second World War had brought an influx of great European filmmakers (including Sirk). And it was partly the legacy of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/12/07/the-shadow&quot;>;Orson Welles&lt;/a>;, who, for all the troubles he experienced in Hollywood, had definitively proved, with “Citizen Kane,” that a studio director—and a twenty-five-year-old one to boot—needn&#39;t be any less of a key artist of his time, and needn&#39;t yield to creators in any other field in regard to comprehensive originality. (Since Welles did little in Hollywood in the fifties, he&#39;s only a bit player in Hirsch&#39;s book.) In the best Hollywood movies of the fifties, there&#39;s a fury, a wildness, a violence (sometimes physical, principally emotional), a sense of resistance to a stifling or menacing order, a sympathy with the free spirit of youth and a view of its subjection to oppressive norms. (For instance, Ray and Minnelli are among the great cinematic poets of frightened children and desperate youths.) Just as pop music in the fifties was being roiled by Chuck Berry, Little Richard, Elvis Presley, and other fervent musicians of youth in revolt, so Hollywood was also in the grips of a youth rebellion—albeit not the one that one immediately thinks of. Of course, young stars such as James Dean and Natalie Wood did capture audiences&#39; imaginations, but more enduringly important was the work of directors—whether relative newcomers who&#39;d started their careers in the wake of Welles&#39;s or veterans well into middle age who were suddenly enjoying a cinematic second youth.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Why didn&#39;t American critics of the time see this? (The title of Pauline Kael&#39;s bitter 1956 essay “Movies, the Desperate Art” could stand in for much received opinion at the time.) The failure to recognize the greatness that was in the air was a failure of psychology, of imaginative sympathy—not with characters &lt;em>;in&lt;/em>; the movies but with the character of the directors responsible for the movies themselves. And it took outsiders, seeing American movies far from the collective clamor of Hollywood—not just the place but the idea, the symbol—to discern the flourishing of artistry and the vigorous rejuvenation that powered it. These outsiders were a new generation of critics who, inspired by Welles, understood the art of the director to be the art of youth and of the times. They wanted to make movies themselves and watched movies thinking like directors. They felt and lived movies as if from behind the screen; they understood what their mentors, role models, and future peers were doing, precisely because they saw them not as cogs in a system or as craftspeople in a commercial guild, but as fellow-artists. They understood more about movies than the meaning of images and the shaping of dramas; they experienced movies holistically, ethically, even metaphysically, grasping the gestalt of a film (images, text, tone, performance) as the reflection of the directors&#39; inner worlds.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;It happened that these critics were French, working and living in Paris, congregating at the journal &lt;em>;Cahiers du Cinéma&lt;/em>; (founded in 1951), and watching movies at the Cinémathèque Française. They were young—the eldest, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/eric-rohmers-elusive-life-revealed-in-a-new-biography&quot;>;Éric Rohmer&lt;/a>;, was born in 1920; the rest, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/franois-truffaut-liberal-filmmaker&quot;>;François Truffaut&lt;/a>;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/postscript-jacques-rivette&quot;>;Jacques Rivette&lt;/a>;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/postscript/jean-luc-godard-was-cinemas-north-star&quot;>;Jean-Luc Godard&lt;/a>;—were approximately a decade younger, and had started publishing criticism around the age of twenty. What they saw in Hollywood was an artistic youth, a youth younger than any they saw in the literature or the painting of the time. No matter that many of their favorite directors—such as Hawks, Hitchcock, and Fritz Lang—had been born in the nineteenth century; the image of Welles making “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/dvd-of-the-week-orson-welless-citizen-kane&quot;>;Citizen Kane&lt;/a>;” at twenty-five clinched, for them, the notion of American cinema as the youthful force they wished to emulate. When they started to make their own movies, their own cinema of youth, in the late fifties and early sixties, they borrowed, channelled, and transformed the styles, forms, and moods of recent Hollywood movies. The Hollywood fifties gave rise to their movement—the French New Wave—as surely as the rise of American rock and roll, in the fifties, gave rise to the British Invasion.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;GenericCallout&quot;>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;One person lying on a couch and another person sitting in a chair looking at them in the movie Cobwebs&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653bffc78e061a8cc8fb192c/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/10.27.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653bffc78e061a8cc8fb192c/master/w_120,c_limit/10.27.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653bffc78e061a8cc8fb192c/master/w_240,c_limit/10.27.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653bffc78e061a8cc8fb192c/master/w_320,c_limit/10.27.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653bffc78e061a8cc8fb192c/master/w_640,c_limit/10.27.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653bffc78e061a8cc8fb192c/master/w_960,c_limit/10.27.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653bffc78e061a8cc8fb192c/master/w_1280,c_limit/10.27.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653bffc78e061a8cc8fb192c/master/w_1600,c_limit/10.27.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;A still from “The Cobweb.”&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;The critic-directors of the New Wave, by so conspicuously establishing their fealty to these modern classics, sparked a new interest—and a new kind of interest—in them back in the United States. The artistic originality and the success of New Wave films validated the tastes and tenets of the movement; suddenly, viewers and critics who loved “foreign” films had to pay serious attention to Hollywood works as those more explicitly artistic movies&#39; equals. New Wave filmmakers created a new mainstream of Hollywood classics, based on their enthusiasm for particular directors, that owed nothing to Oscars or popularity. The New Wave filmmakers discerned, extracted, and developed those aspects of recent American movies that seethed and thrummed with the spirit of youth in order to create their own cinema of actual and manifest youth. In so doing, they definitively enshrined cinema as an art of youth, a central value of young people not only as audience members but as potential creators. Just the way that they might plug in and start a band, so, too, they might aspire to make a movie.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The analogy is imperfect. The young French critics were also inspired by such French filmmakers as Jean Renoir, Robert Bresson, and Jean Cocteau; by an international batch of directors that included Roberto Rossellini, Ingmar Bergman, Kenji Mizoguchi, and Max Ophuls; and by the directors of classic silent films, such as DW Griffith, Sergei Eisenstein, and FW Murnau. Still, not for nothing was this generation of French critics collectively nicknamed the Hitchcocko-Hawksians. Where others saw journeyman directors toiling away in the Hollywood system, the Hitchcocko-Hawksians saw true artistic fire. Their writings put Hitchcock and Hawks on the map, not to mention Sirk, Ray, Preminger, Minnelli, Aldrich, and others.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;These French critic-directors are the hidden figures behind the very existence of books such as Hirsch&#39;s. Moreover, in transforming how studio filmmakers&#39; art was regarded, they were able to distill its essence into a low-budget, even DIY practice, opening up an artistic pipeline between hands-on independent filmmaking and the industry at large. The transformations in the art and the business of Hollywood in the nineteen-sixties and beyond could not have occurred without the ferocious artistry of Hollywood&#39;s nineteen-fifties directors—and the crucial catalyst that unleashed their latent countercultural force is French. ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 31 Oct 2023 03:06:01 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[The Hamas Propaganda War]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-hamas-propaganda-war]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-30T17:57:33.364Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653c1bcf042a0d0fdf29a1f5/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Rasgon-Kirkpatrick-Hamas-Propaganda.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;article >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attribute-verso-pattern=&quot;article-body&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;ArticlePageChunks&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;As Hamas fighters rampaged through Israeli villages outside Gaza on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/dispatch/waking-to-an-attack-from-hamas&quot;>;morning of October 7th&lt;/a>;, killing roughly fourteen hundred people, some paused to take videos of themselves with Jewish children at the Kibbutz Holit. In one piece of footage, a fighter in an Adidas T-shirt vigorously &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://twitter.com/Alaqsavoice_Brk/status/1712872658562347337&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://twitter.com/Alaqsavoice_Brk/status/1712872658562347337&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Alaqsavoice_Brk/status/1712872658562347337&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;pats&lt;/a>; the back of a crying baby who is pressed against his shoulder—the same shoulder carrying his Kalashnikov. Another fighter, wearing a camouflage uniform, bandages the foot of an Israeli boy of toddler age, then puts the boy on his lap while jerking the crying baby back and forth in a stroller. A camera zooms in on the confused face of the boy as an unseen fighter, speaking broken English, instructs him to repeat the Arabic word meaning “in the name of God.” “Say &lt;em>;bismillah&lt;/em>;,” the fighter says. The boy complies, in a soft Hebrew accent.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Hamas released the &lt;em>;bismillah&lt;/em>; video on a Telegram channel six days after the attack. At a moment when the Western news media, and some major Arab outlets, were full of reports about the many civilians who were slaughtered, and Israeli officials were likening Hamas to &lt;em >;ISIS&lt;/em>;, the footage was apparently Hamas&#39;s rebuttal. At one point in the video, a masked fighter holds up the two children and addresses the camera: “Look at the mercy in our hearts. These kids—we didn&#39;t kill them like you do.” (At least six children died from rocket fire on October 7th, and Israel&#39;s Channel 12 has named at least nineteen others killed by militants.)&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;If Hamas meant to humanize its fighters to audiences in Israel or the West, the video was stunningly counterproductive. The group&#39;s propagandists hid the identity of the fighters by blurring out their faces and, in most scenes, distorting their voices. The resulting faceless growls made them look and sound only more monstrous. The Kalashnikovs next to the children, the ungentle pushing of the stroller, the Jewish child goaded into Muslim prayer, the absence of the boys&#39; parents—the whole scene was alarming. (The children turned out to be brothers: Negev, who is three, and Eshel, who is about five months old. Their mother was killed in the raid, and their father was away. Hamas brought the children into Gaza, but released them almost immediately.)&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Michael Milshtein, a retired Israeli intelligence official who specializes in analyzing Palestinian media, told us that the &lt;em>;bismillah&lt;/em>; video “demonstrates Hamas&#39;s arrogance toward the West—that they think all Westerners are stupid, that, if they show images of these barbarian terrorists holding babies and hugging them, people in the West will say, &#39;Oh, they are so sweet. We were wrong about them!&#39; It&#39;s ridiculous.” Many Israelis have observed that their government&#39;s vulnerability to the October 7th attack showed a profound failure to understand Hamas. Milshtein argued that Hamas&#39;s release of the &lt;em>;bismillah&lt;/em>; footage, which displays little comprehension of the audience in Israel and the West, proved that the misunderstanding was mutual.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Yet to Palestinians and other Arab viewers—a very different audience, and one that is more important to Hamas—the awkward &lt;em>;bismillah&lt;/em>; video served its purpose. It was posted to Al Jazeera&#39;s Facebook page for Egypt, and has been viewed more than 1.4 million times. Nearly seventy-five thousand viewers have liked it, and nearly three thousand have left comments, many of them admiring. One commenter praised “the morals of the fighters of the Islamic resistance.”&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;script-container&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;p>;Source: Qassam Brigades / Telegram&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;p >;Three days later, another surreal video &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://twitter.com/justin_hart/status/1714020970422550870&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://twitter.com/justin_hart/status/1714020970422550870&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/justin_hart/status/1714020970422550870&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;appeared&lt;/a>;, this one from an Israeli hostage who identifies herself as a twenty-one-year-old named Mia Shem. In the footage, her dazed eyes seemingly dart to read cue cards as she delivers a statement about the medical care that Hamas has provided for a serious wound to her arm. “They are taking care of me and giving me medicines, everything is fine,” she says flatly, avoiding the subject of who caused her injury in the first place. Since then, Hamas has released videos showing a few handovers of released hostages—including one in which an elderly Jewish Israeli &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://twitter.com/tom_zreika/status/1716609595140173907&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://twitter.com/tom_zreika/status/1716609595140173907&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/tom_zreika/status/1716609595140173907&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;bids&lt;/a>; “shalom” to her Palestinian captor.&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;However unpersuasive or ham-fisted such propaganda might seem in the West, Ghaith al-Omari—a former adviser to the Western-backed Palestinian Authority and a longtime opponent of Hamas—told us that such videos had convinced many Arabs that the group&#39;s fighters, unlike &lt;em >;ISIS&lt;/em>;, “are humane and respect Islamic laws of war.” He added, “It has resonated throughout the Arab world. This is now the line you see not only in Hamas media but in most Arab media, in Jordan, Egypt, and North Africa. The dominant narrative has become the narrative of Hamas.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Hamas began shaping that narrative moments after its fighters streamed through the breached barriers surrounding Gaza. As the assault unfolded, a split screen on Hamas&#39;s Al-Aqsa TV network juxtaposed footage of burning cars in Israeli towns with a video of a cluster of young Israeli men whose arms are tied behind their backs. A news anchor, addressing Palestinians everywhere, &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/100095456016281/videos/712413767415315&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.facebook.com/100095456016281/videos/712413767415315&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/100095456016281/videos/712413767415315&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;declared&lt;/a>;, “This picture is your picture, this might is your might, this flood is your flood, and this blessed action is for all of you!”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;A review of Hamas&#39;s propaganda on October 7th makes clear that a major objective of the group&#39;s assault was to spark a broader uprising among the Palestinians of the West Bank. After the news anchor delivered the “blessed action” soliloquy, the network cut to a recorded message from Saleh al-Arouri, the bellicose deputy chief of Hamas&#39;s political bureau, who explicitly urged Palestinians to rise up against both the Israeli settlers in the West Bank and the soldiers protecting them. The Israeli military “won&#39;t be able to attend to confrontations on other fronts,” Arouri said. “After today, no one can hold back his rifle, bullet, pistol, knife, car, or Molotov cocktail.” Similar calls for an uprising in the West Bank were &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/watch/live/?ref=watch_permalink&amp;amp;v=621151730096100&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.facebook.com/watch/live/?ref=watch_permalink&amp;amp;v=621151730096100&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/watch/live/?ref=watch_permalink&amp;amp;v=621151730096100&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;made&lt;/a>; in statements released during the attack by the Hamas military commander Mohammed al-Deif and by the masked Hamas spokesman Abu Obeida. The statements were broadcast repeatedly on Al-Aqsa TV and on Al Jazeera.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Although no West Bank uprising materialized, Hamas propagandists were still revelling days later in a triumph measured in bloodshed. On October 9th, as Israel was successfully repelling the last remaining Palestinian fighters from its territory, Shadi Asfour, a reporter for Al-Aqsa TV, &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/watch/live/?ref=watch_permalink&amp;amp;v=800879788533965&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.facebook.com/watch/live/?ref=watch_permalink&amp;amp;v=800879788533965&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/watch/live/?ref=watch_permalink&amp;amp;v=800879788533965&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;announced&lt;/a>; from a hospital inside the Strip that “the men of the resistance are still clashing right now on the lands usurped in 1948, in the occupied interior, and reports coming from those lands are that the morale is very high.” Israeli officials at the time had confirmed the deaths of more than seven hundred citizens. “We know that these numbers are certainly false,” Asfour said. “It will soon be acknowledged that the numbers are rising!”&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Observers on all sides of the conflict agree that Israel&#39;s launch of a brutal air campaign against Gaza has rallied sympathy for the Strip&#39;s beleaguered residents and buttressed Hamas&#39;s story of heroic resistance. Talal Okal, a columnist in Gaza for the Ramallah-based newspaper &lt;em>;Al-Ayyam&lt;/em>;, said of the media war, “Honestly and objectively, Israel defeated itself.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;But Al Jazeera, owned by the rulers of Qatar, has done the most to disseminate images of the devastation caused by the air strikes. The network, which has more cameras in Gaza than any other news outlet, has repeatedly broadcast footage of bodies trapped in rubble and of anguished parents clutching children wrapped in shrouds. The network&#39;s anchors and reporters have hewn closely to Hamas&#39;s preferred vocabulary for the conflict, speaking about “resistance fighters” battling against an “occupation army.” One of Al Jazeera&#39;s most prominent journalists, Majed Abdulhadi, &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://twitter.com/AJArabic/status/1710710145590890932&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://twitter.com/AJArabic/status/1710710145590890932&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/AJArabic/status/1710710145590890932&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;celebrated&lt;/a>; Hamas&#39;s attack as it happened by reciting a kind of prose poem: after rhapsodizing at length about the astonished surprise of an Israeli soldier who was captured in his tank, Abdulhadi concluded that, “in one fell swoop,” the assault had “wiped away dark layers of despair.” The video clip is still circulating on Arab social media, where it has been viewed by hundreds of thousands of people.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Al Jazeera&#39;s Gaza bureau chief, Wael al-Dahdouh, has covered many conflicts between Israel and Hamas, and the group&#39;s leaders have sometimes saluted his coverage for conveying their perspective. In an interview on the network in 2021, Dahdouh, who is Palestinian, said that about twenty members of his family had been killed in clashes with Israel. (At least four relatives belonged to the militant group Islamic Jihad.) Dahdouh continued, “Perhaps this is among the difficult moments in the life of a Palestinian journalist—when he goes to report on an incident and discovers the incident is his brother or cousin.”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;0njxum&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;1w4sw&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;On October 25th, Al Jazeera broadcast footage of Dahdouh on a Gaza rooftop, shrieking in agony while receiving a phone call telling him that an air strike on a refugee camp had hit his family. (It killed his wife, a sixteen-year-old son, and a six-year-old daughter.) A video &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://twitter.com/hassaneslayeh/status/1717220453180231907&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://twitter.com/hassaneslayeh/status/1717220453180231907&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hassaneslayeh/status/1717220453180231907&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;posted&lt;/a>; on social media captured him moments later, at a hospital, still wearing his blue press flak jacket, as he cried over the shrouded body of his son. “Are you taking revenge through our kids?” he asked, staring into the camera. “They are child killers, no more, no less. 。 。 。 The army of occupation must be driven away!” On Friday, Dahdouh was on the air again, telling viewers that he saw “no escape” from his duty to report on Palestinian suffering.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The other pan-Arab networks—Al Arabiya, which is controlled by the rulers of Saudi Arabia, and Sky News Arabia, which is controlled by the rulers of the United Arab Emirates—initially appeared to resist Hamas&#39;s story line. The Saudis and the Emiratis loathe Hamas and its Islamist allies. The UAE formalized diplomatic ties with Israel in 2020; Saudi Arabia has signalled that it expects to do the same. Al Arabiya and Sky News Arabia both started off broadcasting critical reports about what they called the Hamas attack. On October 8th, the Sky News Arabia journalist Nadim Koteich appeared to justify Israeli retaliation by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2-8nJGLtUk&quot;>;comparing&lt;/a>; Hamas&#39;s slaughter to Al Qaeda&#39;s attack on the United States on September 11, 2001. The Hamas assault, Koteich said, was “a premeditated coup against the Arab-Israeli peace plan.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;But as the Gaza death toll has climbed, and as Arab opinion has swung toward Hamas, the networks have seemingly capitulated to the feelings of their viewers. Putting aside “the Hamas attack,” newscasters now increasingly refer to the Israeli “war on Gaza.” And the networks have joined Al Jazeera in carrying extensive footage of suffering and carnage in Gaza. “Residents of a neighborhood in Gaza, most of them women and children, lying under the rubble,” an Al Arabiya headline &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90Xwvuu4was&quot;>;declared&lt;/a>;, on October 26th. At the same moment, a chyron repeated a report, by the Hamas-controlled Gaza Health Ministry, saying that in the preceding hours another four hundred and eighty-one Palestinians had been killed by Israeli air strikes.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;When referring to dead Palestinians, both networks still appear to favor the relatively neutral term “victims.” But at one point Ahmad Harb, an Al Arabiya reporter in the Gazan city of Khan Younis, briefly &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://twitter.com/ahmad12891/status/1716855473972949441&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://twitter.com/ahmad12891/status/1716855473972949441&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ahmad12891/status/1716855473972949441&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;spoke&lt;/a>; of eleven casualties as “martyrs”—the term that Palestinian groups invariably use to describe those killed in the conflict. Harb, apparently being interrupted by a producer speaking into his earpiece, quickly corrected himself, reverting to “victims.” On October 24th, the clip of his gaffe went viral on Arab social media, where it was portrayed as a glimpse of the effort by the network&#39;s overseers to check the sympathies of their journalists in the field.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Israel&#39;s military dominance grows &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/another-hospital-in-gaza-is-bleeding&quot;>;more evident&lt;/a>; by the day; according to officials of the Gaza Health Ministry, Israeli forces have killed more than eight thousand people. Yet Israeli, Palestinian, and Western analysts all told us, emphatically, that in the Middle East the winner of the propaganda war is Hamas.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Ghassan Khatib, a political scientist at Birzeit University, in the West Bank, and a former official in the Palestinian Authority, told us that he plans to release poll results showing a jump in support for Hamas among West Bank Palestinians. “Hamas is getting more popular because it is perceived to be standing up to the oppressive Israeli occupation, and because of the brutal retaliation by Israel,” he said. Americans and Israelis, he added, sometimes assume that the current war began on October 7th. But Arabs, and especially Palestinians, had been paying closer attention in the preceding days and decades. Khatib told us that this audience sees the Hamas attack as retribution for decades of “piecemeal repression,” including the expansion of the Israeli settlements in the West Bank and the increase in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-uprooting-of-life-in-gaza-and-the-west-bank&quot;>;settler violence&lt;/a>; against Palestinians. He noted, “People here accept a message that what Hamas did was a response to something that Israel has been doing every day for years and years.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;As Arab opinion shifts toward Hamas, Arab leaders are growing more reluctant to buck it. A statement from the Arab League on October 11th—which condemns “the killing and targeting of civilians on both sides,” including by Hamas—surprised many in the region. But on October 24th, at a United Nations meeting on the conflict, that evenhandedness evaporated. Arab foreign ministers from across the region took turns fulminating against the human cost of the Israel air strikes; all avoided discussion of the ghastly role Hamas had played in setting off the latest round of conflict.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Mahmoud Abbas, the President of the Palestinian Authority, recently spoke by phone with the President of Venezuela, and an initial readout released by the authority&#39;s news agency describes Abbas as having said that Hamas&#39;s actions and policies “don&#39;t represent the Palestinian people.” Just a few moments later, however, this account of Abbas&#39;s criticism of Hamas disappeared from the news site. Current and former officials of the authority told us that Abbas had demanded a retraction.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Nasser al-Qudwa, a nephew of the late Palestinian leader Yassir Arafat and a former foreign minister of the Palestinian Authority, has long condemned Hamas. But in a phone interview he told us that he could no longer do so in public. “I&#39;m not willing to criticize them now,” he said. “How could I while bombs fall on people&#39;s heads?”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;For Israel, the growing embrace by Palestinians and other Arabs of Hamas&#39;s self-portrayal—of outgunned resistance fighters revolting against an unjust occupation—compounds the difficulty of finding any path forward. Israeli leaders have vowed to “destroy” Hamas, but have declined to elaborate on what that means in practice. And how could Israel&#39;s goal be achieved when the &lt;em>;idea&lt;/em>; of Hamas is gaining more support each day of the war?&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Shibley Telhami, a political scientist at the University of Maryland who studies Arab public opinion, said that Israeli and American talk of destroying Hamas was playing into the group&#39;s hands. Telhami told us, “When people in the Arab world hear &#39;destroy Hamas,&#39; they think, &#39;destroy Gaza.&#39; ” Telhami argued that unflinching American support for Israel&#39;s retribution had now firmly tied Washington to the losing side of the propaganda war, adding, “In the Middle East and across the Global South, Joe Biden has become the same as the George W. Bush of the Iraq War.
