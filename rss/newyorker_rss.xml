data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;10 月 7 日上午，如哈马斯武装分子滑翔伞越过以色列的铁丝网进行大规模杀戮，亚哈夫·温纳 (Yahav Winner) 醒来时发现他刚出生的女儿沙亚 (Shaya) 在家中，那是一个田园诗般的沙漠社区，那里有向日葵田和成排的棕榈树。温纳和他的妻子谢莉·阿塔里 (Shaylee Atary) 都是电影制片人，他们在温纳长大的卡法阿扎基布兹 (Kfar Aza kibbutz) 组建了自己的家庭，这是一个约有 700 名居民的村庄，距离以色列和加沙边境仅几公里。她描述说，那天早上，七十名&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/israels-calamity-and-after&quot;>;哈马斯武装分子&lt;/a>;包围了温纳和阿塔里的家。当一名哈马斯战士的手臂冲破他们卧室的窗户时，温纳似乎意识到整个家庭都无法生存。他击退了入侵者，并向他的妻子做出了手势，要求他逃跑。阿塔里左腿有残疾，她抱着熟睡的女儿一瘸一拐地走出门。外面的庭院里，武装分子正在挨家挨户地走动——阿塔里可以通过消音器听到低沉的枪声。她在花园的棚屋里找到了避难所，并躲在空盆和表土中。大约一个小时后，她熟睡的婴儿醒来并开始哭泣。吮吸 Atary 的小指并不能让婴儿安静下来。于是阿塔里又跑了，尝试了每一栋房子，直到她和沙雅在一些家人朋友的安全房间里找到了避难所。二十七小时后，当他们出现时，阿塔里发现村庄已成废墟，而她的丈夫却失踪了。她希望他是哈马斯在加沙劫持的两百多名人质之一。她在接受电视直播采访时发现他实际上已经被杀了。 “我觉得，他献出了自己的生命来爱我，”阿塔里告诉我。 “我会终生想念他。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;以巴冲突的暴力在温纳的一生中留下了深刻的烙印。 2008年，在上一轮战斗中，当时温纳二十多岁，当时他正和他最好朋友的父亲在花园里干活，一枚哈马斯发射的火箭弹落地，将另一个人炸成了碎片。阿塔里说，这段经历塑造了温纳的生活：“他的灵魂崩溃了，”我们交谈时，阿塔里告诉我。 “他的创伤从那里开始。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;创伤成为他工作的重点。它是温纳最后一部电影《男孩》的中心内容，这是一部令人难以忘怀的美丽短片，捕捉了以色列-加沙边境生活的不和谐。影片的主角巴拉克是卡法阿扎的一名年轻人，他无法忽视巴勒斯坦邻居的现实生活。当他的父亲阿维诺姆（Avinoam）在田里干活时，巴拉克则专注于远处加沙枪击事件的回声。当他全神贯注地观看最新一轮暴力事件的新闻时，他冷漠的哥哥缠着他把频道换成真人秀：“《忍者》开播了，我不想看你的废话。”巴拉克对周围的悲惨背景有着清醒的认识。这种清晰度会带来损失；我们看到他感到焦虑，有时与家人发生冲突。巴拉克提供了一个认识他人人性的令人心酸的例子。 “主角非常心碎，因为他知道栅栏另一边的人们和他一样，”阿塔里在谈到她丈夫的电影时说道。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;阿塔里和温纳在十三年前相识，因为特拉维夫的创意合作者，两人都是当地紧密结合的艺术界的一部分。就像他的角色一样，温纳也在与创伤后应激障碍作斗争，然而，朋友们形容他开放、慷慨、有趣——正如一位老同事所说，“一个真正的甜心”。这对夫妇决定一起组建家庭。卡法阿扎拥有公共生活、老式氛围和美丽的自然环境，提供了一片绿洲——即使偶尔会有火箭弹发射。 “我们的大门永远敞开，”阿塔里说。 “这就是我们对社区的感受。”他们希望共同创作的故事能让政治局势好一点。&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;以色列电影制作人长期以来一直是这个国家的道德良知。 《看门人》和《五台坏相机》等电影让全球观众了解了巴勒斯坦人在占领下面临的严酷现实，许多此类电影都得到了国家部委的支持，一些人认为这是该国民主实力的标志。在&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/netanyahus-government-takes-a-turn-toward-theocracy&quot;>;内塔尼亚胡右翼利库德集团政府现在根深蒂固的权力下&lt;/ a>; 然而，被认为亲巴勒斯坦的项目的公共资金越来越难找到，许多导演都倾向于更加非政治的主题。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;在《男孩》中，温纳对生活进行了评论沿着以色列-加沙边境，这一点微妙但毫不退缩。影片进行到一半时，警报响起，“红色警报”，警告来自加沙的火箭弹袭击。熟悉边境生活的基布兹居民纷纷涌向最近的防空洞。巴拉克留在自助餐厅里。他正在努力解决一个他的社区成员宁愿忽视的想法：只要附近加沙的 200 万居民也无法安全地生活，那么生活就会因一枚错误的火箭而崩溃。&lt;/p >;&lt;p>;塞缪尔·毛兹是以色列最著名的导演之一，也是温纳的导师，他的《黎巴嫩》等黄釉电影显然给这位年轻导演的作品带来了灵感。在毛兹参加完温纳的葬礼回家后，我与他进行了交谈，由于有许多尸体需要辨认和埋葬，葬礼推迟了一周。 Maoz 翻阅了他们在 WhatsApp 上的旧短信，发现他最后一条查看 Winner 的消息从未收到。 “我猜他已经死了，”毛兹叹了口气说。在《男孩》的开发初期，维纳曾向毛兹寻求指导，但老导演说他也向维纳学习过。 “与 [Yahav] 合作让我成为一名更好的导演，”曾在世界一些主要电影节上获得最高奖项的毛兹说道。 “现在只剩下他直接、诚实、天真、赤裸的样子——漂浮在空中。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;确实留下了一些痕迹。温纳去世时，他的首部故事片正在制作中，这部由他自己和妻子主演的电影以他心爱的卡法阿扎为背景。影片的一半主题现在已经死了。在一个场景中，温纳亲吻了当时怀孕的妻子，当时她躺在床上，思考着他们一家人的未来生活。 “她长大了，”维纳抚摸着阿塔里的肚子说道。几个月后，在同一个房间里，温纳为挽救自己的生命而奋斗。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“我希望我能看到光明，”Atary 回忆起他们一起创作艺术的十年时说道。 “我们总是、总是在生活中努力寻找那微弱的光芒。”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;

Engoron)“对‘特朗普’的仇恨已经疯狂。” ” 他对律师在证人席上绊倒他的宿敌迈克尔·科恩感到幸灾乐祸，他评论道：“这就像观看最佳佩蒂·梅森剧集的结尾，被告崩溃并哭泣，‘是的，我做到了，我做到了’。”做到了，我做到了。 ”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;该案的实际被告是特朗普、他的两个儿子以及特朗普集团的两名前高管。在上个月末的预审判决中，恩戈隆决定了本案的关键问题，裁定被告在向银行和其他机构提交的财务披露表格上夸大了特朗普财产的价值，从而构成欺诈。该审判现已接近第四周结束，正在就更多罪名和可能的处罚进行审理，为此，纽约总检察长利蒂西亚·詹姆斯 (Letitia James) 寻求最高 2.5 亿美元的罚款以及终身禁赛。特朗普担任纽约任何企业的官员或董事。周三的诉讼程序是特朗普的律师对科恩进行严厉的盘问，这是迄今为止审判中最戏剧性的一天。由于这位前总统还面临着更为严重的刑事审判，这也为未来几个月带来了三个更大的教训。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;最重要的是，特朗普是完全不可救药的。随着其他案件的进展，他肯定会继续以蔑视和蔑视的态度对待法庭和整个法律程序，直到——除非——有人对他施加比五千或一万罚款严厉得多的制裁上周，恩戈隆对特朗普处以五千美元罚款，原因是特朗普未能删除一条社交媒体帖子，该帖子上展示了恩戈隆的一名法律助理与查克·舒默的合影，并声称她是特朗普的总统。参议院少数党领袖的“女朋友”。该帖子违反了恩戈隆之前的一项命令，即不得发布或公开谈论与坐在他旁边的法官或其他法庭工作人员有关的书记员。 （恩戈隆本人仍然是公平的游戏对象——只是不是为他工作的人。）周三，特朗普站在法庭外，显然没有注意到之前的罚款，他在拥挤的媒体围栏前停下来，形容恩戈隆是“一位非常有党派倾向的法官，坐在他旁边的一个非常有党派色彩的人，甚至可能比他更加有党派色彩”——大概又指的是那位法律助理。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;恩戈隆一坐上法官席就发表了特朗普的声明。他注意到诉讼程序发生的“过热环境”，他说，“我不希望任何人被杀。”他还询问特朗普的律师，为什么他不应该“对这种公然、危险地否认法院命令的行为实施严厉制裁”。特朗普的首席律师克里斯·基斯 (Chris Kise) 板着脸坚称，特朗普指的是迈克尔·科恩 (Michael Cohen)，当天作证的证人，而不是律师助理。恩戈隆指出，科恩与店员不同，科恩并没有直接坐在他旁边，但他说他会考虑此事。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;午休后，恩戈隆再次提出了这个问题，并打电话给特朗普亲自出庭作证。前总统宣誓就职后，法官询问他在声明中指的是谁。 “你和科恩，”特朗普回答道。恩戈隆并不买账。在对之前的社交媒体帖子进行了一番反复讨论后，他驳回了特朗普，后者静静地走回辩护桌。恩戈兰随后表示，“证人不可信”，并处以一万美元的罚款，并在三十天内支付。至少现在是这样。特朗普可能并不像他声称的那么富有，但他肯定能负担得起十英镑（或者他的竞选捐助者可以）。&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;今天的第二课是专门为检察官准备的：不要对迈克尔·科恩抱有太大信心。周二，科恩告诉法庭，特朗普将如何“指示”他和特朗普集团前首席财务官艾伦·韦塞尔伯格(Allen Weisselberg)重新调整特朗普净资产声明的估值，直到达到特朗普决定的任意水平。 ——比如说，六十亿美元。科恩和魏塞尔伯格完成这项任务后，他们将返回特朗普，“证明我们达到或接近他所寻求的数字，”科恩作证说。&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;周三，在两名特朗普律师阿丽娜·哈巴 (Alina Habba) 和克里夫·罗伯特 (Cliff Robert) 的激烈质询下，科恩看上去萎靡不振。哈巴在向这位前调解人讲述了他在 2018 年之前向媒体讲述的关于特朗普的一些令人兴奋的事情——“他将成为一位了不起的总统”、“这个家庭很棒”——让他说他对特朗普怀有极大的敌意，他通过批评他而“成就了自己的事业”，并且他在 2019 年 2 月的国会证词中宣誓撒谎，当时他说特朗普没有命令他夸大资产价值。罗伯茨接替哈巴后，科恩证实他在另一个场合撒了谎：在 2018 年 12 月的量刑听证会上向联邦法官撒谎。然后他否认了他向哈巴所说的在国会证词中撒谎的说法。 “所以特朗普先生从未要求你夸大他的财务报表上的数字，”罗伯特说。 “正确，”科恩回答道，特朗普和哈巴举起双臂。&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;在 Colleen Faherty 的指导下，作为纽约总检察长办公室的律师，科恩试图解决他的相互矛盾的言论。科恩说，特朗普“没有明确表示，‘迈克尔，去夸大数字’。” “唐纳德·特朗普说话就像黑帮老大，他所做的就是告诉你他想要什么，但没有具体告诉你。所以当他对我说：‘我的身价超过五百万。事实上，我的身价可能是六、七、八，”我们明白他想要什么。”这是一个完全合理的解释，并且与我们对特朗普的了解相符，特朗普也避免发送有罪的电子邮件和书面记录。但当一名证人似乎反悔或说他对另一位法官撒了谎时，这对检方来说绝对不是一件好事。周三的训练结束后，詹姆斯显然觉得有必要进行一些清理工作。她在法院外对记者表示，“重要的是要知道迈克尔·科恩不是主要证人。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;特朗普与科恩对决的最后一个教训是从本程序的开始，以及特朗普在其他案件中的审前评论。当特朗普面对原告时，他的法律策略在他的支持者眼中仅次于他抹黑法院和检方的政治策略。只有他自己知道自己的最终目标。但它们似乎包括提前对任何有罪判决提出质疑，并植入这样的想法：这种判决将是如此令人愤慨，以至于会导致骚乱和暴力。几乎可以肯定的是，如果他连任，他也在努力为联邦指控定罪时的自我赦免做好准备。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;在他追求这些目标时，特朗普的出庭主要是在媒体活动中，他向支持特朗普的平台传递自己的信息，这些平台放大了这一信息并激励了&lt;em>;MAGA&lt;/em>;的忠实粉丝。当恩戈隆拒绝了他的律师因科恩的证词而驳回此案的请求后，他愉快地违抗了恩戈隆的禁言令，从座位上站起来走出法庭，这一点再清楚不过了。在特朗普缺席的情况下，恩戈隆解释说，他“不可能、也不知道如何”做出这样的裁决，因为他认为一名证人的“可以说是模棱两可的声明”并不重要。 “有足够的证据来填满这个法庭，”恩戈隆说。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;当然，法官的声明并没有像特朗普那样得到那么多的关注“&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn. com/videos/politics/2023/10/25/trump-courtroom-new-york-Trial-cohen-vpx.cnn&quot;>;冲出法庭&lt;/a>;”，这是许多媒体对特朗普突然退出法庭的描述。法庭。在外面，他停下来错误地告诉媒体，科恩“承认我们赢得了审判”。这是一场精心上演的戏剧，但前总统冲出自己的审判是一个更好的故事。 ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot;

>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;On January 5, 2019, a group of people began breaking down the front door of a ministry building on the Rue de Grenelle in central Paris. Security rushed the government spokesperson at the time, Benjamin Griveaux, out through a side exit soon after the intruders took apart the wooden entrance using a commandeered forklift. Their use of heavy machinery had a touch of symbolism. Among the perpetrators were members of France&#39;s &lt;em>;gilets jaunes&lt;/em>; (“yellow vest”) movement, named for the high-visibility vests typically worn by construction workers. Demonstrators had donned the reflective neon garments in a show of working-class pride. January 5th had marked the eighth week of protests against &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/07/01/can-emmanuel-macron-stem-the-populist-tide&quot;>;Emmanuel Macron&lt;/a>;&#39;s economic policies; across the country that day, fifty thousand &lt;em>;gilets jaunes&lt;/em>; took to the streets, facing off against tear gas, water cannons, and other dispersal tactics employed by French riot police. Griveaux, who had earlier called the idea of meeting the protesters&#39; demands “unthinkable,” said on French television about the break-in, “It wasn&#39;t me who was attacked, it was the republic.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I learned about the Rue de Grenelle incident after Googling “France, January 5, 2019,” the date on which “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Vengeance-Mine-novel-Marie-NDiaye/dp/0593534247&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Vengeance-Mine-novel-Marie-NDiaye/dp/0593534247&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Vengeance-Mine-novel-Marie-NDiaye/dp/0593534247&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;Vengeance Is Mine&lt;/a>;,” the new novel by the French writer Marie NDiaye, begins. NDiaye&#39;s latest tale, a story of class conflict embedded within a psychological thriller, is scattered with interpretive hints, clues to the crimes of contemporary French society. Though it starts with a date on the calendar, the story works like a map. The novel is dotted with coördinates around Bordeaux—neighborhood and street names—which NDiaye drops into the story like pins, marking the poor sections of the city where domestic workers live and the rich ones where they work. By the last page, I was newly fluent in the social geography of Bordeaux and its environs, well traversed in the French city&#39;s throughways of privilege and its dead ends of precarity.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The novel, translated from the French by Jordan Stump, opens on that January day—with another tense office visit. A man walks into the struggling law practice of Maître (as attorneys are known in France) Susane. He looks familiar to her, and so he should. His name is Gilles Principaux. He is known throughout Bordeaux as the husband of Marlyne Principaux, a woman in jail for drowning her three small children in a bathtub in the couple&#39;s home in the affluent suburb of Le Bouscat. The case is all over the news. Yet Maître Susane suspects she knows Gilles, who wants to hire her to defend his wife, from somewhere else. She is almost certain that he is the son of a wealthy family who once employed her mother to iron their laundry. She recalls being “enraptured” by the teen-age boy, who had invited her into his bedroom, leaving her “at once dazed at the honor and anxious to prove herself worthy of that distinction.” Why, then, upon seeing him again, thirty-two years later, “did she feel as if her life were in danger?”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;When Sasha, the protagonist of “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Good-Morning-Midnight-Jean-Rhys/dp/0393303942&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Good-Morning-Midnight-Jean-Rhys/dp/0393303942&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Good-Morning-Midnight-Jean-Rhys/dp/0393303942&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;Good Morning, Midnight&lt;/a>;,” Jean Rhys&#39;s novel from the nineteen-thirties, is offered a “beautiful” room in a hotel in Paris, she scoffs at the qualifier, thinking to herself, “Never tell the truth about this business of rooms, because it would bust the roof off everything and undermine the whole social system. All rooms are the same. All rooms have four walls, a door, a window or two, a bed, a chair and perhaps a bidet. A room is a place where you hide from the wolves outside and that&#39;s all any room is.” In “Vengeance Is Mine,” rubbing shoulders with the rich means sharing a room with wolves—in Maître Susane&#39;s case, with one wolf in particular. Her memories of what exactly happened inside that bedroom are cloudy, but she recalls the rich teen-aged boy asking her what she thought of the house, rebuking her for any slips in grammar, any inelegantly formed turns of phrase. In turn, “she pulled out all the most insightful, the cleverest, the most beguiling, the most artful things her mind contained,” trying to speak with the confidence of the class whose space she had suddenly breached.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The image of that home, in the exclusive enclave of Caudéran, has stayed with Maître Susane all her life. The visit “put a spell” on her, one that took the magic out of everything else. She had always considered her parents&#39; modest home “enchanted.” But now, at just ten, she knew that “other houses were enchanted abodes, and enchanted far more intensely.” Even when the novel hints that Gilles might have abused her, she tells herself that she must be grateful to him for teaching her to want more. She even insists that the encounter inspired her to become an attorney. “He made me understand the pleasures I enjoyed and the talent I probably had for arguing and expounding,” she thinks, recalling “the boy who&#39;d initiated her, illuminated her!” NDiaye&#39;s delicately placed exclamation point suggests that Maître Susane is shouting at herself, trying to drown out the truth.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Suspense supplies the forward motion of “Vengeance Is Mine.” We are on edge when Maître Susane turns the corners of streets and the corners of her own mind, scared of what she might remember about Gilles, or the boy who might have been Gilles. After she agrees to take Marlyne Principaux&#39;s case, the gaps in her own story start to fill in. She sees that she and her client have led parallel lives. Both are the daughters of working-class strivers who pushed their children to want to be in better rooms than the ones they were born into, leaving them to deal with the consequences of whatever happened inside. In this elegantly layered tale of social stratification, NDiaye takes us through a maze of alleyways, backstreets, and elegant foyers, until we are dizzy from trying to chart the course of upward mobility and eager for a place to rest—a way out rather than in.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;NDiaye was born in 1967, the daughter of a Senegalese father and French mother. The latter raised her alone in a housing development in a suburb south of Paris. NDiaye was a prodigy who published her first novel at seventeen, and later won France&#39;s most prestigious literary award, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/11/07/the-goncourt-prize-gets-americanized&quot;>;Prix Goncourt&lt;/a>;, in 2009, for “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Three-Strong-Women-Marie-NDiaye/dp/0307741338&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Three-Strong-Women-Marie-NDiaye/dp/0307741338&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Three-Strong-Women-Marie-NDiaye/dp/0307741338&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;Three Strong Women&lt;/a>;,” a novel of interlocking tales set between France and Senegal. Success has not made NDiaye unfeeling toward the insidious injuries of class aspiration. If anything, across her work, she examines the wounds it leaves behind. “Vengeance Is Mine” shares some architectural features with NDiaye&#39;s previous novel, “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Cheffe-Cooks-Novel-Marie-NDiaye/dp/0525520473&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Cheffe-Cooks-Novel-Marie-NDiaye/dp/0525520473&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Cheffe-Cooks-Novel-Marie-NDiaye/dp/0525520473&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;The Cheffe&lt;/a>;,” in which a young girl from a poor family of farmworkers is sent to work in the home of greedy, well-off gourmands, where she becomes a cook. Like Maître Susane, she is referred to only by her job title, a sign that she has allowed herself to be defined by, or, rather, reduced to, her prestigious line of work. The Cheffe&#39;s education in cuisine is also an education in the insatiable appetites of the rich, and in the soul-hollowing experience of feeding them.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Maître Susane hires her own cook, Sharon, a Mauritian woman who also cleans her house, but her foothold in the middle class is precarious. (She only hires Sharon, who is undocumented, “as an act of militancy.”) At forty-two, she is still, by her own assessment, a “novice” in the law. She&#39;s had only a handful of clients, including Sharon, whose immigration case she has taken pro bono, and someone who wants his name changed, believing it to be that “of a slave trader.” Though her apartment, in central Bordeaux, is “grand in its appointments” with “herringbone parquet floors, seventeenth-century fireplace, tall windows with little panes,” it is barely large enough for one person. To her parents&#39; shame, she drives an old low-cost car. Her mother, “her naïve, madly loving mother,” lives in fear that Maître Susane might fall back to what she “most dreaded and so heavy-handedly endeavored to protect her [daughter] from: the abandonment of lofty aspirations, the retreat to a mediocre way of life.” The case will bring in much needed work, but she struggles to imagine what Gilles hopes to achieve. As he leaves her office after his initial visit, he asks her, “You&#39;ll get us out of this nightmare, won&#39;t you?” What would it mean to win a case when the accused has committed infanticide against their own child? “The dead were not going to extract themselves from his bad dream and be born a second time,” she thinks.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;The Medea theme has been on NDiaye&#39;s mind. She co-wrote the screenplay for “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/01/16/an-anatomy-of-a-murder-in-saint-omer&quot;>;Saint Omer&lt;/a>;,” directed and co-written by Alice Diop. The 2022 film was based on the true story of Fabienne Kabou, a French Senegalese woman who was convicted of the murder of her daughter, after the baby was found drowned on a northern French beach in 2013. In the film, the mother&#39;s name is Laurence Coly, and she has left Senegal to pursue a philosophy degree at the Sorbonne. “I wanted to leave my mark,” she tells the judge, and, indeed, the highly publicized trial allows her to achieve the kind of notoriety she craved before her ambitions were thwarted by the racist barriers laid down by French society. Asked to explain why she killed her infant daughter, she can only tell the judge, “I hope this trial will give me the answer.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;As in “Saint Omer,” NDiaye is interested in the elusiveness of motive in crimes committed by mothers, who, she suggests, are at the mercy of an insanity-inducing chorus of voices from all corners of society telling them what to do and how to behave. When Maître Susane meets Marlyne for the first time, in the visitor&#39;s room at the prison, Marlyne talks into the recorder for several pages uninterrupted, speaking of her deceased children in an almost incomprehensible stream of consciousness:&lt;/p>;&lt;blockquote >;&lt;div >;&lt;p>;But I don&#39;t miss them, no. But I&#39;ve brought them back inside me, they&#39;re tiny, in my brain. But in my belly they were all three big babies, but they were born after term, but beautiful children, heavy and long. But my God, how substantial they were! But now they&#39;re teeny-tiny in my brain.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/blockquote>;&lt;p >;She is lucid only when she begs that Gilles not be allowed to visit her. The reason for her actions remains a mystery, likely even to herself—a disorienting mix of isolation and perfectionism inside a mind shattered by expectations and the failure to meet them. Like Laurence Coly, Marlyne Principaux was a woman of great promise. On the day she murders her children, police officers find her “wearing a voluminous T-shirt with the insignia of the Sorbonne.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Reality is a slippery thing in NDiaye&#39;s novels. In the tradition of French Surrealism, she aims to get at the truth by distancing herself from it. In “Vengeance Is Mine,” Maître Susane&#39;s psyche breaks down as she works on Marlyne&#39;s case, resulting in a narrative fractured by the trauma of its protagonist. She invents details and fills in the case file with her own projections. She expresses admiration for Marlyne&#39;s mother (who reminds her of her own) for pushing her daughters to succeed in school, but that is a detail that Susane, not the family, has provided. She imagines that Gilles chose a poor girl to marry in order to manipulate her. Marlyne, she supposes, “complied with all the spoken or unspoken injunctions of that Principaux man who&#39;d been clever enough, on that score at least (the sisters and mother told themselves, according to M&lt;sup>;e&lt;/sup>; Susane), to marry a social inferior.” There is no evidence of such scheming on Gilles&#39;s part, certainly none that will stand up in court.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;But Maître Susane&#39;s proximity to Marlyne helps her approach a solution to her own mystery: of what happened in that bedroom and why she cannot put it to rest. After some time on the case, she works up the courage to ask Gilles if the two have met before. He deflects, and accuses Maître Susane of acting strange. She replies, “I turned strange when I was ten years old.” Sometimes, NDiaye reminds us, the hardest person to extract a confession from is the victim.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In a 2021 &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.thewhitereview.org/feature/interview-with-marie-ndiaye/&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.thewhitereview.org/feature/interview-with-marie-ndiaye/&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.thewhitereview.org/feature/interview-with-marie-ndiaye/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;interview&lt;/a>; with &lt;em>;The White Review&lt;/em>;, NDiaye said she never wants her books to be “described with words ending in &#39;-ist&#39;, whether that be humanist, feminist, socialist,” adding, “I can be all of those things as a citizen, but not as an artist.” NDiaye treats politics and the material conditions it creates as forces that create unpredictable, idiosyncratic outcomes. She never lets her characters be flattened to make a point. A lesser author might stage the interplay between Marlyne and Maître Susane as the contest between a mother and a professional, the novel becoming a stage for the drama of women&#39;s choices to play out. NDiaye transforms them instead into versions of a single person—two women raised to court the rich, to do whatever it took to be let into their houses, even if it meant they would never be at home in their own skin.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Maître Susane&#39;s revenge against Gilles, and everyone like him, will be to give Marlyne a defense that indicts the ruling class and its tools of exclusion. The setting will be where it all began, the home of Gilles Principaux—but, this time, Maître Susane does not ask to be let in. The novel ends with what appears to be her opening statement at trial. In her remarks, she takes the jury into the rooms of the house where Marlyne was made a recluse. “The house confesses, the house that collaborates in the crime, it confesses, it says: I was that man&#39;s accomplice,” she declares, breaking the front door down. ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;xc2n8a&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;bbof1f&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 27 Oct 2023 19:06:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Dear Pepper: All Work and No Play]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.newyorker.com/humor/daily-shouts/dear-pepper-all-work-and-no-play]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-27T10:00:00.000Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653aae03e3e379bb6e22b75d/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/O01.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;article >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attribute-verso-pattern=&quot;article-body&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;ArticlePageChunks&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p>;&lt;em>;Dear Pepper is a monthly advice-column comic by Liana Finck.

death, in 2021, the legendary composer has remained a steady presence on Broadway: a gender-flipped “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/12/20/two-musicals-on-the-perils-of-aging&quot;>;Company&lt;/a>;” was succeeded by a spare but magnificent “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/08/08/the-fraught-fantasies-of-into-the-woods-and-hamlet&quot;>;Into the Woods&lt;/a>;,” a baroque “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/04/10/sweeney-todd-theatre-review-broadway&quot;>;Sweeney Todd&lt;/a>;,” and, most recently, a transfer of &lt;strong>;“&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/12/26/merrily-we-roll-along-and-some-like-it-hot-bring-blockbuster-energy-to-the-stage&quot;>;Merrily We Roll Along&lt;/a>;,”&lt;/strong>; starring Jonathan Groff, Daniel Radcliffe, and Lindsay Mendez. This latest—a revival of Sondheim&#39;s notoriously troubled work from 1981—is a triumph of chemistry and empathy. The show follows a trio of friends in reverse, from lonely middle-aged successes back to the tight-knit strivers they were in their twenties. Franklin Shepard (Groff) has the farthest to fall: he&#39;s the one who abandoned his friends to make his fortune in Hollywood. But &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/09/25/merrily-we-roll-along-again&quot;>;Maria Friedman&#39;s&lt;/a>; production takes seriously the competing desires and compromises that got him there, capturing something real about the way a life sneaks up on you. The rapport between the leads makes the dissolution of their bond as wrenching as it is believable.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;GenericCallout&quot;>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;Photo from musical Here We Are by Stephen Sondheim&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653815ae6d5fb099a570e148/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Here%2520We%2520Are_Emilio%2520Madrid_3976_resized.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653815ae6d5fb099a570e148/master/w_120,c_limit/Here%20We%20Are_Emilio%20Madrid_3976_resized.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653815ae6d5fb099a570e148/master/w_240,c_limit/Here%20We%20Are_Emilio%20Madrid_3976_resized.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653815ae6d5fb099a570e148/master/w_320,c_limit/Here%20We%20Are_Emilio%20Madrid_3976_resized.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653815ae6d5fb099a570e148/master/w_640,c_limit/Here%20We%20Are_Emilio%20Madrid_3976_resized.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653815ae6d5fb099a570e148/master/w_960,c_limit/Here%20We%20Are_Emilio%20Madrid_3976_resized.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653815ae6d5fb099a570e148/master/w_1280,c_limit/Here%20We%20Are_Emilio%20Madrid_3976_resized.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653815ae6d5fb099a570e148/master/w_1600,c_limit/Here%20We%20Are_Emilio%20Madrid_3976_resized.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;Photograph by Emilio Madrid&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Friedman had known Sondheim for decades, first as an actor in and then as a director of his shows; another longtime collaborator, Joe Mantello, midwifed &lt;strong>;“Here We Are”&lt;/strong>; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/11/06/here-we-are-theatre-review&quot;>;reviewed this week by Helen Shaw&lt;/a>;), Sondheim&#39;s final musical, which opened this week, at the Shed, in a state that might generously be called unfinished. The first act follows a group of wealthy friends who are continually stymied in their efforts to eat brunch; the second, which bears almost no trace of Sondheim, finds them all at a meal they&#39;re mysteriously unable to leave. Light satire is supplanted by a descent into Hell: infidelities are uncovered, a man confesses to a murder, and the world outside, it&#39;s implied, has literally ended. None of these plot machinations matter—the characters emerge cheerfully unchanged—and, with no songs to smooth the tonal whiplash or to distract from David Ives&#39;s disjointed book, I started to feel trapped, too. (By the time someone decides a human sacrifice is required to get them out of the room, I was prepared to volunteer.) Seeing this uneven experiment on the heels of “Merrily,” whose problems were solved by years of tinkering, only underscored the loss. I couldn&#39;t help wishing that Sondheim had had more time.&lt;/p>;&lt;hr />;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;align-center&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:align-center&quot;>;&lt;h2 >;Spotlight&lt;/h2>;&lt;/inline-embed>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;GenericCallout&quot;>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;Goings On Samphas Ornate NeoSoul&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65382e7bece2f1517663d541/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/231106_r43272.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65382e7bece2f1517663d541/master/w_120,c_limit/231106_r43272.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65382e7bece2f1517663d541/master/w_240,c_limit/231106_r43272.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65382e7bece2f1517663d541/master/w_320,c_limit/231106_r43272.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65382e7bece2f1517663d541/master/w_640,c_limit/231106_r43272.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65382e7bece2f1517663d541/master/w_960,c_limit/231106_r43272.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65382e7bece2f1517663d541/master/w_1280,c_limit/231106_r43272.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65382e7bece2f1517663d541/master/w_1600,c_limit/231106_r43272.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;Illustration by Jamiel Law&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;heading&quot; aria-level=&quot;6&quot; >;Neo-Soul&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;Sampha&lt;/strong>; loves to take his time, making him a special commodity in an age of instant gratification. The English singer-songwriter&#39;s early collaborations—with an impressive list of auteurs, including Beyoncé, Drake, and Frank Ocean—treated his vocals like ornate flourishes to upgrade a song&#39;s architecture. Some of his outsourcing felt like a personal delay: Sampha tinkering with and trying to perfect his own sound. His stunning, experimental début, “Process,” from 2017, rewarded those waiting with a methodical album that blended electronic music with neo-soul as the singer grappled with losing his parents. After another extended hiatus, Sampha returns with the even more deeply considered “Lahai,” finding inspiration in new fatherhood for vital music that ruminates on progress.—&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/contributors/sheldon-pearce&quot;>;&lt;em>;Sheldon Pearce&lt;/em>;&lt;/a>; &lt;em>;(Webster Hall; Nov. 7-9.)&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>;&lt;hr />;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;GenericCallout&quot;>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;An illustration of the New York City skyline.&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64ad7fea3f0ea61101b7b5aa/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/header-2023.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64ad7fea3f0ea61101b7b5aa/master/w_120,c_limit/header-2023.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64ad7fea3f0ea61101b7b5aa/master/w_240,c_limit/header-2023.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64ad7fea3f0ea61101b7b5aa/master/w_320,c_limit/header-2023.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64ad7fea3f0ea61101b7b5aa/master/w_640,c_limit/header-2023.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64ad7fea3f0ea61101b7b5aa/master/w_960,c_limit/header-2023.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64ad7fea3f0ea61101b7b5aa/master/w_1280,c_limit/header-2023.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64ad7fea3f0ea61101b7b5aa/master/w_1600,c_limit/header-2023.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/div>;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;align-center&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:align-center&quot;>;&lt;h2 >;About Town&lt;/h2>;&lt;/inline-embed>;&lt;div role=&quot;heading&quot; aria-level=&quot;6&quot; >;Opera&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Anthony Davis&#39;s &lt;strong>;“X: The Life and Times of Malcolm X”&lt;/strong>; had its première in 1986, but, despite favorable reviews, it went largely unrevived for decades. Now this poetic musical biography of one of the twentieth century&#39;s great civil-rights orators arrives at the Met for the first time. With a mix of minimalism, atonality, and jazz, the opera transforms Malcolm&#39;s confrontational declamations into something more mesmeric, like incantations, as in a potent Act I aria in which Malcolm (Will Liverman) sings, “You want the truth, but you don&#39;t want to know.” Robert O&#39;Hara&#39;s production, originally staged in Detroit, has stops in Seattle and Chicago—so it seems that companies are finally ready to listen.—&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/contributors/oussama-zahr&quot;>;&lt;em>;Oussama Zahr&lt;/em>;&lt;/a>; &lt;em>;(Metropolitan Opera House; select dates Nov. 3-Dec. 2.)&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>;&lt;hr />;&lt;div role=&quot;heading&quot; aria-level=&quot;6&quot; >;Dance&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;With its lists of compliments and come-ons, the Song of Songs is one of the most sensually suggestive parts of the Bible. “Song of Songs,” a dance-theatre work by &lt;strong>;Pam Tanowitz&lt;/strong>; and &lt;strong>;David Lang,&lt;/strong>; is ardent but chaste. Lang&#39;s compositions analyze fragments of the scriptural text in limpid vocal harmony. Tanowitz&#39;s choreography is classical and largely indirect, with touches of folk dance and only hints of erotic pursuit and longing. In its formal beauty, “Song of Songs” resembles her earlier pieces “New Work for Goldberg Variations” and “Four Quartets,” though it&#39;s a little paler.

Seated behind the mixing board, the audience gazes into a glass-walled booth where the band lays down tracks (written—though you&#39;d never guess it from how period-perfect they sound—by Will Butler, formerly of Arcade Fire). Sessions are continually delayed by Peter (Tom Pecinka), the band&#39;s perfectionist guitarist, who offers nonstop ideas (sometimes good) and feedback (never good), usually to the lead singer, Diana (Sarah Pidgeon, a standout in a strong ensemble), his long-suffering girlfriend. Adjmi and the director, Daniel Aukin, never soft-pedal the electric drama, but, as with some seventies rock classics, you may wish that it had been trimmed.—&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/contributors/dan-stahl&quot;>;&lt;em>;Dan Stahl&lt;/em>;&lt;/a>; &lt;em>;(Playwrights Horizons; through Nov. 26.)&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>;&lt;hr />;&lt;div role=&quot;heading&quot; aria-level=&quot;6&quot; >;Indie Rock&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;The Chicago-based indie-rock band &lt;strong>;Slow Pulp&lt;/strong>; exists in a near-constant state of dazed soul-searching. Across its two albums, the group has made a fuzzy kind of dream pop that scratches the brain with its muted textures. Emily Massey, the lead singer, has a gauzy voice that dissolves into quietly lush guitar beds, and Slow Pulp&#39;s clouded sound is mirrored by her lyrics, which navigate self-doubt. The band&#39;s 2020 début, “Moveys,” proceeds briskly through its songs; this year&#39;s follow-up, “Yard,” is mellower in its pursuit of introspection and fulfillment. Its closer, “Fishes,” marks an important turn in Slow Pulp&#39;s evolution: toward greater trust in the self.—&lt;em>;Sheldon Pearce (Bowery Ballroom on Nov. 1 and Nov. 4; Le Poisson Rouge on Nov. 2.)&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>;&lt;hr />;&lt;div role=&quot;heading&quot; aria-level=&quot;6&quot; >;Art&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;gcli7&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;Henry Taylor the dress ain&amp;#x27;t me 2011&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653834f1ad11909755d07207/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/RS73760_TAYLH112837_resized.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653834f1ad11909755d07207/master/w_120,c_limit/RS73760_TAYLH112837_resized.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653834f1ad11909755d07207/master/w_240,c_limit/RS73760_TAYLH112837_resized.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653834f1ad11909755d07207/master/w_320,c_limit/RS73760_TAYLH112837_resized.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653834f1ad11909755d07207/master/w_640,c_limit/RS73760_TAYLH112837_resized.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653834f1ad11909755d07207/master/w_960,c_limit/RS73760_TAYLH112837_resized.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653834f1ad11909755d07207/master/w_1280,c_limit/RS73760_TAYLH112837_resized.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653834f1ad11909755d07207/master/w_1600,c_limit/RS73760_TAYLH112837_resized.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;“the dress, ain&#39;t me,” 2011&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Art work © Henry Taylor / Courtesy the artist / Hauser &amp;amp; Wirth; Photograph by Serge Hasenböhler&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;p >;Henry Taylor, the sixty-five-year-old subject of &lt;strong>;“Henry Taylor: B Side,”&lt;/strong>; has lived in Los Angeles for years, and sometimes seems to have painted everyone who&#39;s spent any time there at all, from panhandlers and music moguls to his siblings and the Obamas. The richness of Black American community and the indignities of Black American life, in particular the violence of law enforcement, are his recurring themes. There&#39;s also an undeniable strain of impishness and amoral weirdness in his images: after a friend of his, the artist Noah Davis, died of cancer, Taylor painted the man as an adolescent (or a man trapped in an adolescent&#39;s body).

It spans decades in the life of a Black woman named Mackenzie, who grows up in rural Mississippi in the nineteen-sixties and seventies. As a teen-ager, she&#39;s pried away from her home town after her mother&#39;s death; she also has to leave behind the young man she loves, a wrenching separation that leads to passionately dramatic twists and a legacy of secrets. Deftly intertwining time frames and paying rapt attention to faces and landscapes, Jackson—aided by the four actors who portray Mackenzie at different ages, and by the richly textured cinematography of Jomo Fray—unfolds the multigenerational saga with quiet, steadfast exaltation.—&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/contributors/richard-brody&quot;>;&lt;em>;Richard Brody&lt;/em>;&lt;/a>; &lt;em>;(In limited release Nov. 3.)&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>;&lt;hr />;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;GenericCallout&quot;>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;Goings On Samphas Ornate NeoSoul&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64b58b3399c75b29bf38350d/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/GOAT-PickThree-web.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64b58b3399c75b29bf38350d/master/w_120,c_limit/GOAT-PickThree-web.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64b58b3399c75b29bf38350d/master/w_240,c_limit/GOAT-PickThree-web.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64b58b3399c75b29bf38350d/master/w_320,c_limit/GOAT-PickThree-web.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64b58b3399c75b29bf38350d/master/w_640,c_limit/GOAT-PickThree-web.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64b58b3399c75b29bf38350d/master/w_960,c_limit/GOAT-PickThree-web.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64b58b3399c75b29bf38350d/master/w_1280,c_limit/GOAT-PickThree-web.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64b58b3399c75b29bf38350d/master/w_1600,c_limit/GOAT-PickThree-web.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/div>;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;align-center&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:align-center&quot;>;&lt;h2 >;Pick Three&lt;/h2>;&lt;/inline-embed>;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;align-center&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:align-center&quot;>;&lt;p >;&lt;em>;The staff writer &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/contributors/inkoo-kang&quot;>;Inkoo Kang&lt;/a>; shares current obsessions:&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>;&lt;/inline-embed>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;1.&lt;/strong>; In 1988, an American mathematician named Scott Johnson was found dead, at the age of twenty-seven, off a seaside cliff in Australia.

The Hulu docuseries &lt;strong>;“Never Let Him Go”&lt;/strong>; poignantly chronicles the three-decade journey toward justice that the deep-pocketed Johnson family undertook to find Scott&#39;s killer at any price, while asking urgent questions about which types of families get to have their pain and loss recognized by officials.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;2.&lt;/strong>; Martin Scorsese adds another American epic to his storied filmography with &lt;strong>;“&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/10/30/killers-of-the-flower-moon-movie-review&quot;>;Killers of the Flower Moon&lt;/a>;,”&lt;/strong>; based on the &lt;em>;New Yorker&lt;/em>; writer David Grann&#39;s 2017 book about the murders of dozens, if not hundreds, of oil-rich Native Americans in Oklahoma—an early-twentieth-century reprise of Manifest Destiny.

Opening night was six weeks away and his thoughts were crowded with technical and ideological uncertainties. Beijing Renyi, as the People&#39;s Theatre was popularly known, was the country&#39;s most prestigious modern-drama institution, but, all the same, sound effects and music had to be produced with a decades-old East German tape recorder, the set designer was obliged to make a cardboard box stand in for a refrigerator, and the lights would go dim during daytime rehearsals, because the whole city&#39;s voltage dropped when factories were in operation. Miller, who did not speak any Chinese, would be entirely reliant on an interpreter as he directed, and he worried, too, about what else might be lost in translation: could a society long removed from commercial life make sense of a man like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1999/01/25/making-willy-loman&quot;>;Willy Loman&lt;/a>;, whose dreams and crises were so bound up in nineteen-forties American materialism?&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The encounter between Miller and the members of Beijing Renyi is the subject of a new play at the Connelly Theatre, in the East Village, “Salesman之死,” by Jeremy Tiang. As the title hints—pronounced “Salesman zhīsǐ,” it simply means “death of a salesman”—the play flows bilingually back and forth between Mandarin and English. It is surtitled in both languages, and all the roles, including that of Miller himself, are played by a cast of six Asian women, five of whom are Chinese-speaking immigrants. Often making use of Miller&#39;s book about the episode—“&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Salesman-Beijing-Arthur-Miller/dp/067061601X&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Salesman-Beijing-Arthur-Miller/dp/067061601X&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Salesman-Beijing-Arthur-Miller/dp/067061601X&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;Salesman in Beijing&lt;/a>;”—the play dramatizes the misunderstandings and sudden connections of the rehearsal process, weaving them into a larger consideration of the distances and intimacies between the two countries and cultures.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Miller had been curious about the Chinese Revolution for years. In 1973, he wrote to the Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai pleading for a visa but got no response. Finally, in the fall of 1978, two years after the death of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tag/mao-zedong&quot;>;Mao Zedong&lt;/a>;, the Chinese People&#39;s Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries brought Miller to China for a visit of several weeks. During the visit, Miller met with various Chinese dramatists and directors, including the playwright Cao Yu, who was also the head of Beijing Renyi, and the famous actor-director Ying Ruocheng. The two of them later invited him to come back and direct “Salesman.” Meanwhile, Miller&#39;s wife, the Magnum photographer Inge Morath, who had been studying Chinese for years, set about recording what she saw on film. The country &lt;a href=&quot;https://cdn.theatlantic.com/media/archives/1979/03/243-3/132638042.pdf&quot;>;she photographed&lt;/a>; had only just emerged from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/02/01/what-are-the-cultural-revolutions-lessons-for-our-current-moment&quot;>;Cultural Revolution&lt;/a>;, and its quotidian realities were almost unknown to the outside world. As he watched her at work, Miller noted, “The ability to be surprised is a virtue.” “Salesman之死” finds humor in such cross-cultural surprises. When one character explains the concept of life-insurance policies—“people get money for dying”—another nods and says, “Oh, like revolutionary martyrs!”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Tiang, who was born in Singapore, developed the play alongside its director, Michael Leibenluft, who speaks Chinese and has directed plays in China. For the central character of their play, they picked not Miller but rather his interpreter, a twentysomething academic named Shen Huihui. Shen had written her graduate thesis on Arthur Miller and was a rising star at Peking University when she was approached by Ying, the actor-director Miller had met on his previous visit. Ying, now best known in the West for an appearance in Bernardo Bertolucci&#39;s “The Last Emperor,” played Willy Loman in the Beijing production and translated the text. He was ensconced in China&#39;s intellectual élite. His father was a famous educator and his paternal grandfather had married into the Qing royal family and founded a newspaper, &lt;em>;Ta Kung Pao&lt;/em>;, that is still in circulation. Ying had read “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Death-Salesman-Conversations-Twentieth-Century-Classics/dp/0141180978&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Death-Salesman-Conversations-Twentieth-Century-Classics/dp/0141180978&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Death-Salesman-Conversations-Twentieth-Century-Classics/dp/0141180978&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;Death of a Salesman&lt;/a>;” in December, 1949, the same year it premièred in America, and just weeks after the People&#39;s Republic of China was founded. For most of his life, performing it in China would have been an impossibility. In Tiang&#39;s play, Ying is exasperated when Shen, worried about neglecting her academic work, hesitates to take on the task of interpreting for Miller. The project “will clear a path for us to step out into the world,” he says. “Do you know how many decades I&#39;ve been waiting for the chance?”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;For decades before the Communists came to power, modern realist drama had flourished in China. Cao Yu, whom Miller met in 1978, was one of its star playwrights. But, after the Cultural Revolution began, in 1966, Beijing Renyi&#39;s rehearsal rooms were repurposed to house hundreds of Red Guards, and Cao went from being a cultural gatekeeper to an actual one—charged with directing cars to park in an alley by the theatre that he&#39;d previously managed. In a courtyard nearby, another of the theatre&#39;s most famous dramatists, Lao She, was taunted and abused by a group of Red Guards, and later found dead. In 1968, Ying and his wife were imprisoned, and later they were exiled to a reëducation center in the countryside, working on a rice farm. As it happened, Jiang Qing, Mao&#39;s powerful wife, was a former actress, and she promoted eight so-called model plays, which used the traditional forms of Beijing opera to convey revolutionary messages. Characters in such plays were either good or bad—there was no room for such a thing as a conflicted inner life.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Miller&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1996/10/21/why-i-wrote-the-crucible&quot;>;experiences&lt;/a>; with the House Un-American Activities Committee surely helped him relate to what his Beijing cast had been through. (In 1957, a congressman from Ohio had asked him, “Why do you write so sadly?”) During rehearsals Miller patiently worked with the actors to find common ground between their vastly different experiences. Ying, playing Willy Loman, found it hard to understand the character&#39;s delusional behaviors, as when he holds out hope for a business loan even after his son Biff has told him that it won&#39;t happen. Miller asked the actors to search their own lives for situations that they could neither bear nor adapt to, leaving self-deceiving hope as the only way forward. Ying laughed, immediately seeing the point. “It&#39;s as Chinese as hell,” he said. “It&#39;s our whole history.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Away from the rehearsal room, Miller and Morath took hours-long bike rides around town. “The tourist mind presses attention outward, but living in a place lets things in,” Miller wrote. They saw a city “intimate with itself”: in open spaces, men played checkers games and grandmas beat quilts. Miller and Morath could see early signs of Deng Xiaoping&#39;s market reforms. To counter youth unemployment, the government had begun to encourage small businesses. On the street, skilled laborers repaired bikes and made furniture. The atmosphere made Miller think of the tenements of the Lower East Side, the world in which his immigrant father had been a young man—“the philosophers congregating on the stoops, the future gangsters and judges and songwriters yelling across the areaways.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Part of Miller&#39;s struggle was to situate the 1983 production in a place that felt specific, without being necessarily Chinese or American. Early on, he was startled to find his cast in whiteface, wearing light-colored wigs, walking with an exaggeratedly “Western” gait. “Act yourself,” he urged them. Tiang&#39;s play often teases out the issues of identity latent in such moments. At one point, Ying&#39;s wife, a literary translator, refers to the author Bette Bao Lord, famous in the eighties for her best-selling novel “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Spring-Moon-Bette-Bao-Lord/dp/0060599758&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Spring-Moon-Bette-Bao-Lord/dp/0060599758&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Spring-Moon-Bette-Bao-Lord/dp/0060599758&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;Spring Moon&lt;/a>;,” as being “both Chinese and American, if such a thing is possible.” What makes the line so striking is not just that a cultural fusion so unthinkable to a nineteen-eighties Beijinger (and probably to many nineteen-eighties Americans) is now commonplace. More than that, the entire production with its cross-cultural, multinational, multilingual cast, writer, and director exists in this previously unimaginable hybrid space.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;There is a kind of cultural vertigo involved in seeing how deftly the actresses transform themselves as they switch between roles, or as they represent Chinese people representing Americans. Some of the mannerisms are unmistakably old Beijing: a working-class man spreading his legs and cursing, a cadre tapping his mug of tea when he&#39;s impatient. At other times, it feels as if nationality has almost evaporated. When Biff, wearing a baseball cap, exclaims in a perfect Beijing accent, “Pop, I&#39;m nothing! I&#39;m nothing, Pop! Can&#39;t you understand that?,” there is no sense of splintered identity, only a young person, put down by the world. He&#39;s angry at suffocating parental expectations but, at the same time, pained by his anger. The moment is a kind of fruition of Miller&#39;s own aspiration to create “something not quite American or Chinese but a pure style springing from the heart of the play itself—the play as a nonnational event, that is, a human circumstance.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Miller&#39;s show in Beijing was a success. People applauded ceaselessly. Lingering viewers missed the last bus. One professor walked eleven miles back home so he could ponder more. Miller soon left China, but the production ran for some fifty performances. As for Shen, the reluctant interpreter, toward the end of “Salesman之死,” we learn that she was so transformed by the experience that she decided to go to the US as a visiting scholar. “The door is open,” she says. “I don&#39;t know when it will shut again, but right now, I can walk through it.” Ying, a mentor figure by now, encourages her, borrowing the line that Willy often says to Biff—“the door of your life is wide open.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Shen is now in her late sixties and lives in Vancouver, and Tiang and Leibenluft interviewed her while developing the play. The play ends with projected footage of her speaking and, because she is speaking mostly Mandarin, the cast members take it in turns to translate what she says—the interpreter herself interpreted. The thing that stuck in Shen&#39;s mind, she says, was not the triumph of the production or the famous people she met, but a quiet moment one night, after rehearsal. It was nine or ten, and she took the tram to Chang&#39;an Street, in downtown Beijing. The street lamps emitted a warm light. “It felt as if everyone was resting, and I was the only one still at work, doing something very meaningful,” she says. “I was the chosen one.” As the six actresses translate her story, the projection of Shen blankets the stage. She smiles and nods, as if passing on the blessing Ying gave her forty years ago to the six actresses, younger versions of herself. ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;86wxu&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;a11m7o&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 27 Oct 2023 19:06:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“Fellow Travelers” Shows Another Side of Gay History]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/11/06/fellow-travelers-tv-review-showtime]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-27T10:00:00.000Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653950a9bca6913fb19e8249/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/231106_r43287.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;article >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attribute-verso-pattern=&quot;article-body&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;ArticlePageChunks&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Joseph McCarthy, whose pursuit of national purity exposed his own moral degradation, wasn&#39;t the sort to grant dignity to his enemies. “If you want to be against McCarthy,” he reportedly told the press, “you&#39;ve got to be either a Communist or a cocksucker.” The Wisconsin senator&#39;s right hand during his Red-baiting years was his chief counsel, Roy Cohn, who in turn recruited a pretty-boy hotel heir named David Schine. That the threesome spearheaded the Red Scare of the nineteen-fifties, as well as the accompanying Lavender Scare—which sought to rout gay men and lesbians from government service—didn&#39;t stop rumors from circulating about their own sexual inclinations; the playwright Lillian Hellman dubbed the trio of bachelors “Bonnie, Bonnie, and Clyde.” By the time Cohn died, from complications of &lt;em >;AIDS&lt;/em>;, in 1986, he was nearly as infamous for denying his own queerness as he was for his prosecutorial viciousness. McCarthy, too, was the subject of whispers—he was no stranger, allegedly, to Milwaukee&#39;s gay bars. They wouldn&#39;t be the last men to persecute their peers to deflect from their own apparent proximity to the closet, but they may have been the only ones to do so in such flamboyant fashion.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;McCarthy and Cohn are secondary characters in the remarkable new period drama “Fellow Travelers,” on Showtime, a generation-spanning romance between two ambitious men who first find each other amid the hunt for “subversives and deviants” in Washington. (The title derives from the real-life McCarthy&#39;s term for Communist sympathizers.) When Hawkins “Hawk” Fuller (Matt Bomer), a mid-level State Department official with a Bronze Star to attest to his manliness, meets the milk-sipping, charmingly priggish Tim Laughlin (Jonathan Bailey) at an Election Night party, the attraction is immediate. Unlike Hawk, who aspires to climb the ranks and cap a respectable if undistinguished career with a luxurious posting abroad, Tim is yet another young idealist who&#39;s come to DC to make a difference. Hawk, though far from a McCarthy ally, gets Tim a position in the Senator&#39;s office—a staggering opportunity for the devoutly religious young man, who excuses his hero&#39;s “rough tactics” as necessary for the greater good. It&#39;s not long before Tim learns that Hawk&#39;s gifts are always meant to be repaid.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The series&#39; creator, Ron Nyswaner, who adapted Thomas Mallon&#39;s 2007 novel of the same name, jumps between time lines, deftly weaving together Hawk and Tim&#39;s decades-long ardor with the historical events that follow: the Vietnam War, the assassination of Harvey Milk, and the &lt;em >;AIDS&lt;/em>; crisis, as the federal government&#39;s treatment of the LGBTQ community shifts from targeted hostility to malicious neglect. But it&#39;s during the Eisenhower era that “Fellow Travelers” is at its most absorbing, when the DC gay scene is functionally segregated, and solidarity is contingent at best. Constant surveillance heightens the risks of intimacy—and the furtive thrills of bathroom hookups. As much as Hawk despises McCarthy and Cohn, he&#39;s just as prepared to betray his associates to keep his own image clean; the difference between their mode of self-preservation and his is only a matter of scale. It doesn&#39;t seem to occur to him, until he meets Tim, that other men are available not only for cruising but also for love. Throughout the series, people in Hawk and Tim&#39;s orbit grapple with what queerness means, and what it can be. A lesbian friend, Mary (Erin Neufer), advises Tim that “hiding a part of yourself and killing it are two different things.” Marcus (Jelani Alladin), a Black man burdened by his father&#39;s dream for him to become the “Jackie Robinson of journalism,” distances himself from the gay movement—and elides his sexuality in his writing—in order to focus on race. His skittishness is a chronic disappointment to his on-again, off-again boyfriend, the drag queen Frankie (Noah J. Ricketts), who has no desire to pass as straight the way Marcus does. Tim comes to embrace the word “gay”; Hawk insists on “homosexual.” Each individual&#39;s relationship to his identity is both a question of philosophical sweep and one of brute survival.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The eight-part miniseries benefits from its fairly novel (and thematically complex) historical backdrop, but it develops into one of the year&#39;s best dramas through its rich characterizations. The casting of the leads is a particular achievement. Bomer, with his broad-shouldered athleticism and blandly handsome matinée-idol looks, channels Don Draper, whose besuited virility was all the more beguiling for his stoic unknowability. (For Hawk, like the “Mad Men” protagonist, the faultless masculine surface is all performance—though Draper never kept his heart rate down during a polygraph test by picturing Mamie Eisenhower.) But Bailey is the showstopper as Tim, a born zealot who&#39;s at ease only when armed with a clear sense of purpose. As young men, Hawk and Tim tell themselves that, however much they love each other, they want other things more. Hawk&#39;s cynicism and his desire for a traditional family life, including a wife and children, put him at odds with Tim, whose need to belong, if not to surrender, to something greater than himself can be met only temporarily with sex. The latter&#39;s yearning for the sublime undergirds his tortured relationship to Catholicism; with his willowy frame, floppy hair, and bespectacled visage, he has the makings of a modern martyr. It&#39;s no surprise that, as he grows older, he flips from the radical right to the activist left. The most compelling question the series asks is who, or what, will finally consume Tim in the way that he craves.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Tim and Hawk&#39;s affair is both satisfyingly unpredictable and magnificently erotic, their trysts tinged with mid-century camp. (The heat between Bomer and Bailey, stoked in part by the gleeful creativity of the sex scenes, certainly helps.) During one of their early meetings, when Tim announces that he&#39;s departing for noontime Mass, Hawk makes his interest explicit by leaning in and half-whispering, “I&#39;ll spend the rest of the afternoon picturing you kneeling in prayer.” Tim&#39;s answering smile says it all. Once the complications of reality set in, the push-pull dynamic becomes irresistible not because you&#39;re rooting for them to be together but because it&#39;s impossible to decide whether they should stay that way. Unlike most great onscreen love stories, this is a romance in which one person is fundamentally unworthy of the other—and yet it&#39;s undeniable that they&#39;re each other&#39;s best chance at happiness.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The supporting cast is nearly as strong, though the time-line hopping and the old-age makeup don&#39;t always work to their advantage. Allison Williams, who plays Hawk&#39;s wife, Lucy, is out of her depth as the gray-haired society matron who is finally forced to confront Tim&#39;s indelible role in her husband&#39;s life. The historical figures are among the most impressive, even if the series&#39; investment in their contradictions is perhaps more than they deserve. Will Brill embodies Roy Cohn brilliantly, full of the wounded, howling humanity implied by the epitaph on Cohn&#39;s eventual &lt;em >;AIDS&lt;/em>;-quilt panel: “Bully. Coward. Victim.” Chris Bauer is unrecognizable under heavy prosthetics, save for his bald pate and bulldog growl, but he manages to get at the oblique flirtations that McCarthy allowed himself with unsuspecting staffers. It&#39;s in those fleeting moments of stolen pleasure that you can see what might have been, if these men had been motivated by anything other than fear. ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;ypz4lj&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;hc0bph&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 27 Oct 2023 19:06:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“The Killer” Misses]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/11/06/the-killer-movie-review-the-holdovers]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-27T10:00:00.000Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653a82aff925b1d500f53340/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/231106_r43289.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;article >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attribute-verso-pattern=&quot;article-body&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;ArticlePageChunks&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;A dozen years have passed since “Shame,” in which Michael Fassbender played an unappeasable sex addict named Brandon, and I remember wondering, back then, what Brandon would do once the juice ran dry. Sell real estate, perhaps? Get married, raise three kids, and work on his short game on weekends? Another possibility is suggested by “The Killer,” a new film from David Fincher, in which Fassbender—still lean and staring, spookily unchanged by time—takes the role of a professional assassin. I can&#39;t prove anything, but I suspect that he is Brandon reloaded. From picking up strangers on the subway to picking them off with a silenced rifle, through a hotel window, is just a hop and a skip.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Fassbender is one of those actors who seem alone even when they&#39;re in company. He specializes in the hard, the hollow, and the robotic, and the anonymous figure he plays in “The Killer”—which is based on a multivolume graphic novel by Alexis Nolent—spends the first half hour or so in monkish solitude. He waits in empty rooms on the top floor of an apartment building, in Paris, preparing to shoot someone across the way. He has a gun, a telescopic sight, and a watch that measures his pulse. (No trigger should be squeezed until the rate drops below sixty.) Determined to leave no trace, he wears gloves at all times and dozes on a workbench as if it were an operating table. And, in voice-over, he talks to us.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Some of the talk is advisory, like that of a lecturer in advanced homicide. (“Anticipate, don&#39;t improvise.”) There are occasional quips, as when the killer cautions against using Airbnb: “Those Superhosts love their nanny cams.” For the most part, though, he trades in dead language. “It&#39;s a dog-eat-dog world, to reuse the apt cliché,” he tells us. But &lt;em>;why&lt;/em>; reuse it? A deliberate ploy, I guess, from Fincher and his screenwriter, Andrew Kevin Walker, who previously collaborated on “Se7en” (1995). It&#39;s as though they wished to cauterize their hero—to numb him against any hint of moral sensation. He&#39;s so uninterested in his environment that he can no longer be bothered to register it in anything but the flattest terms. Later, when he describes a suburb as “a stone&#39;s throw from the city that never sleeps, barely off the beaten path,” he might as well be reading from a brochure.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The Parisian hit goes ahead, though not as planned, and the killer embarks on a fresh quest. The motive becomes one of revenge—a surprising development, given that he was initially at pains to present himself as a cold fish, gutted of all sentiment and belief. His mission takes him to New Orleans (“A thousand restaurants, one menu”), Florida, Chicago, and the Dominican Republic. He switches identities as smoothly as he does locations, and we glimpse the various names that he employs: Felix Unger, Lou Grant, Sam Malone, and so on. The nod to the protagonists of TV series is a nice gag, and for any cop on the killer&#39;s track it would be a clue. Yet there &lt;em>;is&lt;/em>; no cop. Unlike the hired gun in “The Day of the Jackal” (1973), our man has nobody against whom to pit his wits. Instead, those wits are bent upon the minutiae of his trade: making a single call on a cell phone and then stamping it underfoot, or buying a garbage bin into which a corpse can be conveniently stuffed.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;These tactics are absorbing to follow, and it&#39;s clear that we are encouraged to regard Fincher, in his implacable handling of the action, as a kindred spirit of the assassin. (One poster for the film reads “Execution is everything.”) A similar kinship suffuses Jean-Pierre Melville&#39;s “Le Samouraï” (1967), starring a lethal Alain Delon, but Delon resembles a nineteen-forties gangster, in his trenchcoat and fedora, whereas Fassbender looks like a dweeb. He wears a bucket hat, which in Melville&#39;s domain would count as a capital offense. Technology, too, sets the two killers apart. Fincher&#39;s guy orders a widget on Amazon that enables him to copy a digital key fob; his French counterpart, needing to steal a car, gets into a parked vehicle, gazes through the windshield, and patiently goes through a set of keys, on a ring the size of a saucer, until he finds one that fits.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Something else has shifted, though, besides the evolving of style. If “Le Samouraï” was an enigma, Fincher&#39;s film has the sheen of a clever conceit. The killer&#39;s mixtape of choice, for example, consists of songs by the Smiths. “I was looking for a job, and then I found a job, / And heaven knows I&#39;m miserable now,” Morrissey sings, as if in tribute to Fassbender&#39;s unsmiling murderous mien. Despite the shafts of black comedy, and a sudden ruckus of violence, “The Killer” is oddly calculated and cooked up; it&#39;s easier to be excited and amused by the proceedings than to be stirred or convinced. This is especially true when, late in the movie, &lt;em>;two&lt;/em>; assassins meet at a fancy restaurant. One of them is played by Tilda Swinton, no less, and the scene is as elegantly paced and staged as you&#39;d expect, yet I felt that I was watching a slice of high-toned performance art rather than a link in a plausible plot.&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;For a similar encounter, with a very different twist, try “The Bourne Identity” (2002), in which Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) outsmarts and shoots a fellow-operative known as the Professor (Clive Owen). “Look at what they make you give,” the Professor says to Bourne, before lying down and breathing his last in a bed of dried reeds. There is no such rustle of gravity in “The Killer.” Never does it cross the movie&#39;s mind, as it were, that ending the lives of others, for a living, might do fearsome damage to a person&#39;s soul. Or could it be that souls—ungainly burdens, at best—are something that Fincher&#39;s characters, on the whole, like to think they can do without?&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The new film from Alexander Payne, “The Holdovers,” is set in the dying days of 1970. It is the season of good will, though not in the sour and unused heart of Paul Hunham (Paul Giamatti). At Barton Academy, a hidebound East Coast prep school, he has been teaching Ancient Civilizations for so long that most of his pupils, not to mention his colleagues, view him as a product of antiquity—no better than a broken shard of the past. He is, in every sense, history. Needless to say, the antipathy is requited; near the start, Hunham refers to the boys in his class as “lazy, vulgar, rancid little philistines.” In his dreams, I imagine, he would smite them with the jawbone of an ass.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Every year, for family reasons, a few kids—the holdovers of the title—end up staying at school over the festive period. On this occasion, there are five of them, although soon enough they are whittled down to one. (The whittling requires a deus ex machina, a rare bum note in an otherwise finely tuned tale.) The unlucky loner is Angus Tully (Dominic Sessa), bright and disruptive, who has already been kicked out of three schools and is careering fast toward his fourth kick. During this limbo, he is overseen by the rancorous Hunham; also in residence are the school cook, Mary (Da&#39;Vine Joy Randolph), and a janitor named Danny (Naheem Garcia). Snow falls. Resentments rise. It&#39;s like a murder mystery without a body. Can the crime of people&#39;s misery be solved?&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;A heap of earlier narratives surround this movie, like Yuletide presents piled up at the base of a tree. “The Breakfast Club” (1985) and “Scent of a Woman” (1992) are there, plus a couple of Dickensian gifts: “A Christmas Carol,” obviously, and the wretched quartet in “David Copperfield”—a master, a caretaker, a cook, and young David, marooned at Salem House over the holidays. As for Hunham, he&#39;s like the classics teacher in Evelyn Waugh&#39;s 1947 novella “Scott-King&#39;s Modern Europe,” who declares, “I think it would be very wicked indeed to do anything to fit a boy for the modern world.” What&#39;s engaging about Giamatti, who teams up with Payne for the first time since “Sideways” (2004), is that such reactionary resignation is voiced with a soft sigh and a dab of jesting levity. (In “Scent of a Woman,” by comparison, Al Pacino&#39;s performance was one long bark.) Observe that when Hunham does lose his rag, at the dinner table, he&#39;s defending Mary against a puerile gibe. “You have &lt;em>;no&lt;/em>; idea what that woman has been through,” he says.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;We can see where all this is headed, of course. It is an iron law of cinema that Scrooges must thaw their frozen spirits. The master will warm to the pupil, and fight his corner, if necessary. Lessons, far beyond the bounds of the curriculum, will be learned. The fact that an emotional template is clear and preset, though, does not make it any easier to adhere to, and seeing the job well done, as it is in “The Holdovers,” can be immensely gratifying. And the fact that characters are provided with statutory secrets, to be disclosed at nicely timed intervals—as happens with Hunham, Angus, and Mary—does not guarantee any intensity in the revelation. The leading players here, however, bring force and grace to the task. (Randolph can do an awful lot with a simple murmur of “Mm-hmm.”) Top marks to Payne, too, for concluding his fable not with a hug but with a handshake, in a sunlit New Year. Gratitude, even if it borders on a kind of grudging love, should always obey school rules. ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;vcx3ib&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;s4o0ym&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 27 Oct 2023 19:06:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Speaker Who?: The Rise of a G.O.P.

It wasn&#39;t so long ago, after all, that our politicians aimed to get a majority of the vote and conceded defeat when they did not get it, that running from the center rather than the extremes was seen as a winning strategy, and that lack of experience was viewed as a political liability which, if not exactly fatal, needed somehow to be addressed. Criminal indictments were generally considered career-ending. Governing was at least theoretically the goal of those who sought to run the government. But in the eighth year since Donald Trump took over the Republican Party, the GOP continues to do things that would seem to defy logic.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;For more than three weeks, amid a brewing crisis in the Middle East and with a national election year looming, House Republicans shut down the one branch of government that they control, having allowed a faction of just eight rebels to depose their leader and then finding themselves unable to agree on who should replace him. It was “perhaps the dumbest set of politics—or decision-making—a majority party in this institution could make,” as Patrick McHenry, the North Carolina Republican who served as acting Speaker for the duration of the follies, bluntly put it. When they finally settled the matter on Wednesday, twenty-two days into the mess, their new chosen Speaker, the Louisiana congressman &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/how-mike-johnson-went-from-relative-obscurity-to-speaker-of-the-house&quot;>;Mike Johnson&lt;/a>;, appeared to have two main qualifications for the post: his obscurity and his record of extreme fealty to Trump.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In the hours after Johnson&#39;s unexpected ascension on Wednesday, the press and the political commentariat feasted on examples of the previously little-known congressman&#39;s ideological extremism: his calling gay people “dangerous” and “deviant” threats to the American way of life; his sponsorship of a national abortion ban and warning that those who performed an abortion would, at least in Louisiana, end up doing hard labor; his insistence that, if only women would bear more “able-bodied workers,” there would be no need to cut back Medicare and Social Security. His climate-change denialism, his belief in creationism over evolution, and his promotion of “covenant marriage” were all examined. It was pointed out that Johnson, after only six years in Congress, was the least experienced Speaker in a hundred and forty years, and the most hard-right House leader anyone could remember.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;But none of those were the reasons for his rise, which had less to do with his stealth brand of political extremism than with his stellar record of support for Trump&#39;s unprecedented effort to overturn the results of the 2020 election. Many members of the House Republican Conference—two-thirds of them, in fact—had voted to back Trump&#39;s lies about the election. But few had worked as actively to foist bogus conspiracy theories about 2020 on the American public as did Johnson, a constitutional lawyer who enlisted dozens of fellow-members to support a Texas court case seeking to cancel the election results in battleground states. Johnson even promoted the bizarre falsehood, also amplified by Trump, that Dominion voting machines had been rigged because they came from “Hugo Chávez&#39;s Venezuela.” (One thing that always bothered me about this: Didn&#39;t anyone ever point out to them that Chávez died in 2013, seven years &lt;em>;before&lt;/em>; the election that he somehow stole?) Johnson&#39;s role, little noted at the time, was such that the &lt;em>;Times&lt;/em>; later called him “the most important architect” of the campaign to block congressional certification of the Electoral College results and thus overturn Trump&#39;s defeat.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;On Tuesday, it had looked like the Speakership might go to Minnesota&#39;s Tom Emmer, but the Republican whip turned out to have a fatal black mark on his résumé, at least as far as House Republicans were concerned: his vote on January 6, 2021, to certify President Joe Biden&#39;s election. After five rounds of voting in the Republican Conference on Tuesday, Emmer defeated Johnson, a hundred and nineteen votes to ninety-seven votes. But then Trump weighed in. No way he wanted an election-enabler as House Speaker. In a Truth Social post, Trump warned against the “tragic mistake” of choosing a “globalist &lt;em >;RINO&lt;/em>;” like Emmer. Enough Republicans then refused to go along with Emmer in a prospective House floor vote—where the Republican majority is so slim that a Speaker candidate can lose no more than four members of his own party—that he was soon forced to give up his bid. (“It&#39;s done. It&#39;s over. I killed him,” Trump reportedly bragged in a phone call with members.) It says everything about today&#39;s House GOP that Johnson lost the race against Emmer but then won the job anyway.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Just a few days before the dénouement of the Speaker drama, Ken Buck of Colorado had declared himself a proud holdout against installing an election denier in the Speakership. “If we don&#39;t have the moral clarity to decide whether President Biden won or not, we don&#39;t have the moral clarity to rule in this country, period,” he told reporters. Yet on Wednesday he, along with every other Republican in the House, voted to install Johnson as Speaker. There is moral clarity in this unanimous GOP choice, but not the kind that reflects well on Buck or his colleagues.&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;On Wednesday morning, Matt Gaetz, the Florida congressman who sparked all this chaos earlier this month, when he moved to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/letter-from-bidens-washington/mccarthys-ouster-is-proof-once-again-that-appeasement-doesnt-work&quot;>;oust Kevin McCarthy&lt;/a>;, gave Johnson a new nickname, soon embraced by everyone from the Biden campaign to Trump himself: “&lt;em >;MAGA&lt;/em>; Mike.” The gentleman from Louisiana may or may not be able to govern his unruly caucus, but he has already proved one thing: that lying for Trump is the essential prerequisite for winning power in the Republican-controlled House.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I imagine that Democratic strategists—not to mention all those frenetically Googling opposition researchers—are delighted with how this particular circus on Capitol Hill played out. They were already planning to run against the “&lt;em >;MAGA&lt;/em>; extremists” in 2024—now there&#39;s a Speaker to lampoon whose positions are so extreme they hardly seem believable for the twenty-first century. Republican House candidates, meanwhile, will have a hard time arguing that their constituents should elect them to run Congress—what&#39;s the point, after all, if they&#39;re so busy fighting among themselves that they can&#39;t even keep the House open for business?&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Still, it&#39;s hard to regard Johnson&#39;s elevation as a good development, no matter what comes out of it. The US government looks foolish and, with federal funding once again set to run out in just a few weeks, Congress is no closer to passing even the bare minimum of bills to keep the government open. The new Speaker, a politician who opposes basic human rights for many Americans and who would forswear his oath to the Constitution to keep a dishonest demagogue in power, represents an extreme minority of the country. He is also untested and unvetted, so little known that, before he became Speaker on Wednesday, he had never even met with the Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell. And yet he went to bed that night as second in line of succession to the US Presidency.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Kevin McCarthy, the deposed House Speaker, had a reputation as an establishment type with whom Democrats could do business. But his years of accommodation to Trump and the Trumpists who came to dominate his caucus shredded any claim he once had to credibility. It should be noted that McCarthy, too, was an election denier who voted against certification on January 6th, as were the majority of candidates who emerged at one point or another in October trying to succeed him.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The lesson of the last month is that it doesn&#39;t really matter whether it was Johnson or some other House Republican who won. There is no such thing as a political moderate among them.
