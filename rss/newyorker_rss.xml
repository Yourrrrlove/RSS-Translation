>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;当决定是否参加 2012 年总统竞选时，罗姆尼内心很矛盾。媒体普遍认为他是共和党的领跑者，但他的大多数家人反对再次竞选。右翼正在经历转变。奥巴马担任总统期间，煽动了反建制的茶党运动，而共和党内躁动不安、充满怨恨的草根阶层似乎对罗姆尼这样的贵族人物并不特别热情。他还决心避免 2008 年的扭曲。“当然，我想获胜，但感觉我一直忠于我所相信的事情更为重要，”罗姆尼在给顾问的电子邮件中写道。&lt;/ p>;&lt;p>;竞选活动决定持续关注经济；罗姆尼一直以一位扭亏为盈专家的身份来阐述自己的观点。但是，根据科平斯的说法，罗姆尼的顾问继续敦促他倾向极右翼。他关于移民的言论近乎本土主义。在一场共和党辩论中，他建议对无证移民进行“自我驱逐”。他还寻求特朗普的支持，特朗普花了几个月的时间煽动有关奥巴马出生地的毫无根据的阴谋论。罗姆尼获得提名，但在选举中被奥巴马击败。那天晚上，当他的一位顾问提出再次竞选的前景时，他坚称，“伙计们，我在舞台上的时间已经结束了。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;罗姆尼在科平斯的书的第四章中第一次遇到唐纳德·特朗普。 1995 年，特朗普邀请罗姆尼到他位于海湖庄园的豪华庄园过周末。据科平斯说，罗姆尼觉得这次经历“非常奇怪”，并认为他再也见不到特朗普了。 2016 年提名竞赛期间，这位大亨在民意调查中的支持率上升让他感到困惑。他和安观看了特朗普的集会，暴力的幽灵似乎无处不在。 “那些人没有参加我们的活动，”安说。当特朗普可能赢得共和党提名的情况明朗时，罗姆尼急忙阻止他，发表演讲谴责他是“骗子”，后来又在幕后工作，将提名送交大会。他曾向朋友预测特朗普将赢得大选。即便如此，事情发生时他也毫无准备。&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;然而，罗姆尼对特朗普的抵制并没有直线进行。众所周知，他曾考虑加入特朗普政府担任国务卿。当两人在纽约特朗普国际酒店大厦内的豪华餐厅 Jean-Georges 共进晚餐的照片在网上疯传时，这种反复无常的表情包又回来了。在橙黄色调的图像中，特朗普似乎几乎在咯咯笑。罗姆尼看起来很懊恼，眉毛扬起，嘴唇抿在一起。他后来向科平斯坚称，他的言论与特朗普无关。 “这与在公共餐厅里拍照的尴尬有关，”他说。晚宴结束后，他告诉记者，他“越来越希望当选总统特朗普能够带领我们走向更美好的未来”。据科平斯称，特朗普打电话给罗姆尼，告诉他需要发表更强硬的声明：特朗普“棒极了”，将成为“伟大的总统”。罗姆尼不能再忍受这种假装了。科平斯写道：“也许在多年来允许琐碎的侮辱和道德妥协堆积起来之后，他终于达到了极限。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;科平斯详细描述了罗姆尼在特朗普上任的头几个月里日益增长的警惕性：旅行禁令;国务院人员外流；在夏洛茨维尔举行白人民族主义集会后发表的声明称，“双方都有非常优秀的人”。有一次，罗姆尼抄下了威廉·巴特勒·叶芝在第一次世界大战后写的诗《第二次来临》中的一句话：“最好的人缺乏所有信念，而最坏的人/充满激情。”这就是罗姆尼心目中的新共和党。 2017年秋天，他决定重返政坛，竞选犹他州参议员席位。 “当你没有钱的时候，当你年轻的时候，金钱是一种激励，”他在日记中写道。 “现在的动力就是比自我更伟大的目标。”这个目的是成为特朗普的制衡力量。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;在参议院，罗姆尼的地位和毅力似乎都在增长。在他竞选总统期间使他瘫痪的谨慎已经消失了。他成为党内少数愿意批评特朗普过激行为的人之一。 2019 年 12 月 18 日，众议院&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/trumps-impeachment-and-impeachment-lite&quot;>;投票弹劾&lt;/a>;总统指控称他拒绝向乌克兰提供军事援助，以向乌克兰总统弗拉基米尔·泽伦斯基施压，要求其展开有利于特朗普政治的调查。为参议院的审判做准备，罗姆尼研究了《联邦党人文集》第 65 期，其中亚历山大·汉密尔顿认为，参议院是唯一具有足够独立性、能够以“必要的公正性”处理审判的机构。审判只持续了五天。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;罗姆尼对他的共和党同事感到沮丧。 “我们的核心小组与真正的陪审团有何不同？”他在日记中写道。一天晚上，参议院休会后，罗姆尼回到办公室，跪在地板上祈祷。后来，他在日记中列出了投票给特朗普定罪的潜在后果：他将在参议院受到排斥；福克斯新闻会对他进行猛烈抨击，“煽动人们的疯狂”；总统会无情地攻击他，或者利用政府来伤害他的儿子；罗姆尼可能需要离开犹他州。那天晚上，在他位于华盛顿的联排别墅里，他睡得很不好，黎明前就醒了，再次审查这个案子。在他的办公室里，他召集了员工，告诉他们他已经做出了裁决。&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >; &lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;2020 年 2 月 5 日，罗姆尼站在参议院议事厅的讲台上&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-专栏作家/mitt-romneys-act-of-political-courage&quot;>;解释了他决定&lt;/a>;成为美国历史上第一位投票罢免总统脱离本党派的参议员。 “作为一名参议员兼陪审员，我在上帝面前发誓，要行使‘公正的正义’，”他说。 “我笃信宗教。我的信仰是我的核心。”说到这里，罗姆尼停顿了几秒钟，眼神低垂，似乎不知所措。 “我在上帝面前发誓，这具有重大意义，”他继续说道。他说，为了党派目的而无视这一誓言，将使他的性格受到“我自己良心的谴责”。他承认，他的政党和州内的许多人不同意这一决定。他还承认，他的投票不会让特朗普下台。 “我会告诉我的孩子和他们的孩子，我已尽我最大的能力履行了自己的职责，”他说，“相信我的国家对我有这样的期望。”演讲结束后，罗姆尼联系了安用电话。她将观看他的演讲描述为一种精神体验。在接下来的日子里，随着罗姆尼的尖酸刻薄，他想起了帕利·帕克·普拉特（Parley Parker Pratt），一位早期的摩门教传教士，也是一位远祖，他在纽约辛苦了几个月，却没有赢得任何皈依者，但有一天他看到了异象。主的保证——他的努力没有白费，他的牺牲已被接受。罗姆尼在日记中写道，巨大的负担已经解除，“焦虑消失了。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;2021 年春天，科平斯和罗姆尼开始每周秘密会面，接受有时会进行的采访用了几个小时。自 1 月 6 日起义以来已经过去了几个月，科平斯写道，罗姆尼“听起来常常像敌后间谍”。罗姆尼坦言，他的政党中的大部分人“真的不相信宪法”。他正在思考一些棘手的问题，包括他自己对共和党的发展负有责任：“右翼的腐烂是新的，还是刚刚浮出水面的非常古老的东西？而主流建制派的成员——像他这样的人，&lt;em>;通情达理&lt;/em>;的共和党人——在让这种腐烂恶化的过程中扮演了什么角色？”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor =&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;上个月，七十六岁的罗姆尼宣布，他不会寻求参议院连任。他在决定中提到了自己的年龄，并宣称是时候更换新一代领导人了。据科平斯称，罗姆尼一再有自己死亡的预感。他的教会教导他，有一天，他将站在上帝面前，面对他的思想、言语和行为的清算。他必须解释他的政治生涯——他所采取的立场、他所做的妥协以及他选择坚持的立场。如果罗姆尼不知所措，他可能会带来科平斯的计算记录。 ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot;

is a North American labor union, with roots in the garment and hotel trades, that&#39;s known for its willingness to strike. Its divisions in New Haven have grown to encompass some eight thousand people who work at Yale. The earliest effort began in 1941, with Local 35, when mechanics in the campus power plant organized and later fought to bring in custodial and dining-hall workers. In 1984, the union struck for ten weeks to support receptionists, librarians, and laboratory researchers in their formation of Local 34. Most recently, after several failed attempts stretching across more than three decades, graduate-student teachers finally won their own union, Local 33.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The mayor credited the unions for holding the university accountable, but the gesture was also politically expedient: the Board of Alders is dominated by members or allies of &lt;em >;Unite Here&lt;/em>;. In a 2011 campaign nicknamed Aldermania, the unions ran a slate of candidates to win a majority on the Board. The idea was to bring working-class residents into government and turn the board into more than a rubber-stamping mechanism for the mayor. Weeks of door-knocking during the sticky summer heat paid off: seventeen of eighteen candidates endorsed by the union won their elections. They were Black and white and Latino; there was a Yale janitor, a Yale library assistant, and a Yale undergraduate. The majority has held ever since.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Tyisha Walker-Myers, who became an alder in the 2011 election, is now in her fourth term as president of the board. During the State of the City address, she sat to the right of Elicker, wearing glasses and long braids. She grew up in West River, a predominantly Black neighborhood, as factories in the area were shrivelling. She attended Albertus Magnus College, a local Roman Catholic university in New Haven, but felt out of place—“I was the only minority”—and left without a degree. In 1998, she got a job in a dining hall at Yale, her first real experience of the university beyond the monied shadow that it cast over her home town. “If you came on campus and weren&#39;t supposed to be there, you were going to be chased out by security,” she recalled. She became a shop steward in Local 35, then took a full-time job at the union. Her jump into local politics—the alder gig was technically part time and came with a tiny stipend—still felt like an odd fit. “People believe politics is crooked,” she said. “I&#39;m not a politician because I don&#39;t lie. I&#39;m very straightforward.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Across the country, &lt;em >;Unite Here&lt;/em>; invests heavily in electoral politics. One of its locals, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1996/02/26/how-the-maids-fought-back&quot;>;Culinary Union&lt;/a>;, in Las Vegas, has played a big role in keeping Nevada blue. In California, María Elena Durazo, a former &lt;em >;Unite Here&lt;/em>; organizer, is a powerful member of the California Senate and has served as vice-chair of the Democratic National Committee. But it is in New Haven that the union has come closest to functioning like an actual political party. The Yale locals&#39; effort to put members in office was part of a larger mission to bridge New Haven&#39;s town-gown divide.&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;It was a daunting, aspirational program: to jumble the boundaries of race and class and élite education. Some experiences would never be shared. In Elicker&#39;s speech, he arrived at the topic of gun violence. It was just a month into the new year, and five residents of New Haven, which has a population of a hundred and thirty-nine thousand, had already been killed—all people of color. (White people make up about forty per cent of New Haven; the rest are mostly Black or Latino.) The first victim, Dontae Myers, was twenty-three when he was shot, on New Year&#39;s Day. His brother, Dashown, had been killed in similar circumstances, in 2020—and a community group started by &lt;em >;Unite Here&lt;/em>;, called New Haven Rising, organized vigils after both of their deaths. The boys&#39; mother, LaQuvia Jones, was Walker-Myers&#39;s best friend, as close to her as a sister. The mayor paraphrased something that Jones had said: “When you pull the trigger, you don&#39;t pull it on a target. You pull it on a community. You pull it on anyone who loves that person.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;In January, the planning for Dontae&#39;s funeral had awkwardly coincided with celebrations at the union. A few blocks from city hall, grad students in jeans and shabby-chic sweaters were gathered in the basement of a Methodist church, which rents space to the union, to watch a live feed of the National Labor Relations Board certifying ballots for and against Local 33. The viewing party was largely devoid of suspense (the yes vote was overwhelming), but the room still whooped when the union was proclaimed official. There was a feeling of resolution. At the same time, the result would test the durability of the &lt;em >;Unite Here&lt;/em>; model. Graduate workers had built their demands on the struggles of Locals 35 and 34: New Haven&#39;s working class. These fellow-unionists expected fealty to labor—and to the needs of the city&#39;s residents—over Yale. It was more than a decade into Aldermania, which was now a mature political experiment in a stubbornly unequal place. Could the Yale unions find enough common ground between graduate students and custodians and billing clerks to keep the experiment going?&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The town-gown divide is almost as old as the college town itself. In a fabled instance from the mid-fourteenth century, students at Oxford accused the owners of the Swindlestock Tavern of serving subpar alcohol. Townies came to the tavern&#39;s defense, and the conflict erupted into a three-day riot that killed nearly a hundred men. Much later, the US imported many aspects of the physically and socially cloistered British university system. Town-gown relations proved manageable when the college was just one piece of the local economy. The strain sharpened when cities that once boomed with manufacturing became overly dependent on higher education.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;By the seventies and eighties, New Haven&#39;s factories were shutting down. Workers turned to jobs in health care and the service sector, and Yale became one of the city&#39;s top employers. (Its sister corporation, Yale New Haven Health System, is the largest private employer in Connecticut.) Yale expanded in enrollment and physical size, and its endowment grew at a rate that&#39;s difficult to comprehend, doubling since the Great Recession. New Haven, meanwhile, stayed relatively poor: the nonprofit DataHaven found that between 1990 and 2017—a span of nearly thirty years—the median household income &lt;em>;decreased&lt;/em>; by about two thousand dollars. Four-fifths of higher-wage jobs are held by suburban commuters who don&#39;t live in the city.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Yale made some efforts to be a good neighbor: it set up an Office of New Haven Affairs, redeveloped a commercial corridor downtown, and established a first-time-home-buyer subsidy for university employees, many of whom came from the surrounding community. Still, the Yale unions saw a need for more ambitious redistribution. They pushed initiatives that had little to do with contracts or other typical union fare, provoking accusations of “machine politics” and undue influence from their critics. “This particular vision of industrial unionism is pretty unique and not something you see very much at other unionized institutions of higher ed,” Zach Schwartz-Weinstein, a historian of Local 35 and a former member of NYU&#39;s grad-worker union, told me.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The unions pressured Yale to deliver more voluntary payments to the city and scrutinized Yale&#39;s requests for building permits. They established a local-hiring program run in partnership with the university, which, in 2015, promised to hire a thousand residents from New Haven, half from majority-minority “neighborhoods of need,” within five years. When Yale failed to keep pace, the Board of Alders convened a hearing that overflowed the aldermanic chambers. Walker-Myers, the board president, accused Yale of inflating its statistics with short-term construction jobs. A university representative promised to “think of systemic changes” to reach its goal. (In 2021, that goal was met.)&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;n3xru&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Part of &lt;em >;Unite Here&lt;/em>;&#39;s strategy has been to recruit organizers from the Yale student body. In 1969, it brought on John Wilhelm, who had been a working-class transfer student and civil-rights activist. At the time, Local 35 was staging long, aggressive strikes to win better-than-poverty wages. Wilhelm believed that a union should be run mostly by workers from the rank and file—his mentor was Vincent Sirabella, a former waiter and bartender who&#39;d risen through a local in Providence—but he also saw a place for intellectuals. In 2000, the union recruited Gwen Mills, a Cornell graduate who had grown up in New Haven. Mills helped to develop the campaign to run a labor slate for the Board of Alders. Like Wilhelm, she was later promoted to an executive position at the international headquarters of &lt;em >;Unite Here&lt;/em>;. They prototyped a career path that dozens of Yalies would follow.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In April, Wilhelm and Mills flew to New Haven for a two-day celebration of Local 33&#39;s win. Former Ph.D. students, many now tenured professors, arrived from across the US, England, and Brazil, and gathered in the sanctuary of the Methodist church. Mills stood at the pulpit and described her transition from Yale-resenting townie to union organizer. “I grew up a mile from here,” she said. “I got married here in this sanctuary.” She recalled a popular bumper sticker from her childhood—“Beep! Beep! Yale&#39;s cheap!”—that critiqued the university&#39;s stingy approach to the community. New Haven, she said, is a “post-industrial manufacturing town with a multibillion-dollar education corporation plopped right into the middle of it.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I came to Yale as a college freshman in the late nineteen-nineties, naïve and unprepared. I&#39;d never spent time on the East Coast. I was lousy at research and writing. I hadn&#39;t known anyone with money. When I tried to make small talk and asked one girl where she was from, she said, “Chelsea.” Another prep-school kid responded, “Park Avenue.” Where? Meanwhile, the message from Yale was to stay on campus, away from what it deemed the inner-city dangers of New Haven. I felt a small crack in this wall of alienation when I learned about the efforts of &lt;em >;GESO&lt;/em>;, the Graduate Employees and Students Organization, the precursor of Local 33.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Looking back, it was risky for Locals 35 and 34 to ask dining-hall cooks and library aides—who lived in the neighborhoods I was told to avoid—to put their dues money toward a union for young classics scholars, let alone chemists who could seemingly go on to lucrative jobs in Big Pharma. Barbara Vereen, a Local 34 staffer who worked in medical billing at the time and was raised in New Haven, told me that she was initially dismissive of the graduate campaign. Then, in 2003, she heard a presentation on the tenure-track system. “I came back, and I told my co-workers, we&#39;re looking at this all wrong,” she said. “Like, these people are workers. They got the same problems that we got.” The Yale historian Michael Denning told me, “The struggle for the first ten or fifteen years was to see the teaching work of graduate students &lt;em>;as work&lt;/em>;. I wrote two or three essays to prove it to myself.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;More persuasion came from Yale. Members of &lt;em >;GESO&lt;/em>; from the nineties and two-thousands endured years of acrimonious dealings. Even in departments that might have seemed friendly to unionization, student organizers say that they were sidelined, even blacklisted. “In anthropology, it was trench warfare,” Nazima Kadir, who was a Ph.D. student in that department, told me. One of her classmates was nearly expelled. An associate professor who came out in support of them was denied tenure. That professor was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/05/13/paint-bombs&quot;>;David Graeber&lt;/a>;, who went on to teach in England and helped launch Occupy Wall Street. (According to Yale, the vast majority of professors in Graeber&#39;s cohort were denied tenure; the university maintains that it has respected the right to organize.)&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In the two-thousands, as colleges relied increasingly on Ph.D. and master&#39;s candidates to fill their teaching needs, graduate students across the US turned to unions. But, at private universities, the status of this workforce was unsettled: were they student-apprentices or true employees who deserved the right to organize? The National Labor Relations Board went back and forth on this question. In 2016, Local 33 unionized a few select departments; in 2017, members staged a hunger strike. Then, after the Trump years, the union relaunched a comprehensive drive. In the fall of 2022, organizers collected more than two thousand union cards, and, unlike in years past, Yale administrators and faculty mostly left the students alone.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Local 33&#39;s victory this year was one of many landslide academic elections in a matter of months. At Boston University, the union won ninety-eight per cent of the vote; at the University of Chicago, ninety-two per cent; at the University of Minnesota, where the first attempt at a union had been made in 1974, ninety-seven per cent; at Duke, eighty-eight per cent. Late last year, nearly fifty thousand graduate teachers and researchers at the University of California struck for six weeks—the largest academic work stoppage in US history. A few months later, some nine thousand academic workers at Rutgers walked out over an expired contract. Only at Yale were grad workers integrated into a larger campus union, but the Rutgers campaign made a point of emphasizing links to the community. Its “common good” demands included a rent freeze on all Rutgers-owned properties and a million-dollar investment in the surrounding neighborhoods—though it won neither at the negotiating table. (Rutgers did promise to distribute six hundred thousand dollars through a nonprofit.)&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;pa667p&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Since the beginning of 2022, the National Labor Relations Board has certified twenty-seven bargaining units at private colleges and universities, comprising more than thirty-two thousand student workers. Undergraduates with on-campus jobs have organized as well—at Dartmouth, the University of Pennsylvania, Barnard, Tufts, and the University of Massachusetts at Amherst. Some nineteen thousand student workers on the twenty-three campuses of the California State University system will soon vote in a union election. Colin Culver, an undergraduate at San Diego State University, told me that the majority are from working-class families in town. The school pays them less than they pay regular staff. “They use student staff to lower wages for everyone,” Culver said. The union, he hopes, will put a stop to that.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;This spring, I met with Sulema Hamilton, a custodian in Local 35, who had just finished her shift at Yale&#39;s Asian American Cultural Center. (I worked there senior year as part of my financial-aid package.) The center is situated in an old three-story brick building with a covered porch. Hamilton was dressed in her Yale navy blues and safety shoes, and wore sparkly earrings. When she was growing up in New Haven, she said, her grandmother worked at a gun plant and belonged to a union. Hamilton went away for college, then returned to marry and raise two daughters and a son. For many years, she was a bank teller, but after a while her career stalled. She knew that jobs at Yale were union, and asked about a clerical position, envisioning something at a desk. The recruiter pointed her in another direction. “She&#39;s, like, &#39;It could be the kitchen, or custodial services,&#39; ” Hamilton told me. “I said, &#39;Well, I do all those things at home—how difficult can it be?&#39; ” She did have one very grimy assignment—at Gryphon&#39;s Pub, in a Yale-owned property that smelled like beer and piss. “I made it look like a palace,” she said. “I never looked at my position as &#39;I&#39;m doing something less.&#39; ” Her janitorial pay and benefits soon surpassed what she had earned as a teller.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Hamilton saw herself as a fixer of ordinary troubles, the kind of person you&#39;d want to be around if anything bad came your way: unpaid overtime, improper orders, a nasty supervisor. She and other campus workers I interviewed described union membership in broader terms as well. “If you think about a big institution, a big establishment, you have to get into politics,” Lisa Stevens, a medical assistant at Yale&#39;s cancer center and the vice-president of Local 34, told me. “You have to find other ways to fight. We can never match their dollars.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In 2022, Hamilton took time off to canvass for Democratic Senate candidates in Pennsylvania and Georgia. Other members of Locals 35 and 34, and grad workers with Local 33, joined her. It wasn&#39;t unusual for unions to stump for Democratic politicians. But, in 2020, Gwen Mills, the New Haven townie at &lt;em >;Unite Here&lt;/em>;&#39;s headquarters, devised a mass mobilization that doubled as income replacement. Most &lt;em >;Unite Here&lt;/em>; members worked in hotels and hospitality, and had lost their jobs during the pandemic. The union offered them hourly door-knocking work in battleground states—and helped pull off white-knuckle wins in Arizona, Pennsylvania, and Georgia (though Local 11, which covers Arizona and Southern California, later seemed to regret their exertions on behalf of now Senator Kyrsten Sinema).&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;When &lt;em >;GESO&lt;/em>; got started, in the nineties, graduate unions were considered faddish and economically unnecessary: the purview of gender-studies scholars or Marxist students whose parents were Marxist professors. &lt;em >;STEM&lt;/em>; people were assumed to be hard to organize. Ditto international students. It&#39;s now harder to conjure a typical profile. At the vote count, in the church basement, I noticed a South Asian woman wearing a cut-up T-shirt covered in “Local 33 &lt;em >;UNITEHERE&lt;/em>;!” buttons, in the style of chain mail, that jangled as she moved around the room. Her name was Arita Acharya, and she had taken a leave of absence from her Ph.D. in genetics to work for the union. “Some of the reasons I went into &lt;em >;STEM&lt;/em>; were my real desire and curiosity, but it was also my culture hammering into me that this was the only worthy thing to do,” she told me. During the pandemic, she&#39;d canvassed New Haven to try to get people vaccinated, and discovered that organizing was “another thing I might want.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Former organizers told me that &lt;em >;Unite Here&lt;/em>;&#39;s expectations were “psychotic” and that the experience was “exhausting.” They also said that it changed their lives. Shana Redmond, now an English professor at Columbia, was part of a &lt;em >;GESO&lt;/em>; effort to pressure Yale to divest from private-prison companies. As “the child of a formerly incarcerated person,” she told me, she saw in that campaign “the possibility of what a union could be.” Redmond chose to stay in academia, but other organizers applied their Ph.Ds to careers in labor. At the Local 33 celebrations in April, alumni included the presidents of &lt;em >;Unite Here&lt;/em>; locals in Miami and Seattle, a labor educator in Massachusetts, and a labor strategist in Arizona. The Yale-to-union pipeline spawned a semi-facetious conspiracy theory: maybe &lt;em >;Unite Here&lt;/em>; had intentionally stretched out the graduate-student organizing, in order to recruit as many smart young people into the labor movement as possible.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;By late spring, Acharya was weighing this choice herself. “It&#39;s a scary moment right now,” she told me. Would she return to her lab in the fall or defect for a union job? She ultimately chose an option in between, extending her leave of absence—“Because I&#39;m still having a good time!” she texted me. Other leaders of Local 33 resumed their studies. Abigail Fields, a Ph.D. candidate in French who&#39;d been on leave with Acharya, went back to her dissertation on representations of agriculture and rural life in the nineteenth-century French novel. Fields would spend the coming year in France, but planned to stay involved in the union. Her immersion in organizing had changed her personality. “I like myself much more now than when I was keeping my head down,” she said. “My adviser also noticed a move in my dissertation from ecology to labor.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;When campus emptied out for the summer, Acharya stayed busy with collective bargaining—Local 33 was meeting regularly with university representatives—and other &lt;em >;Unite Here&lt;/em>; business. The summer agenda was to tell neighbors about a new law that allowed renters to form tenants&#39; unions, and encourage them to file complaints with the city&#39;s Fair Rent Commission. In June, the members of New Haven&#39;s first two tenants&#39; unions rallied outside the offices of their corporate landlord. One protester held up a sign that said “A 30% Rent Increase Is a Soft Eviction!!!” Another described “a lot of mice, just killing them constantly.” In late August, after sixteen households in one of those buildings were given eviction notices, the statewide Connecticut Tenants Union (whose founders include members of Local 33) filed a lawsuit and called for a mass protest. The Yale unions showed up with hundreds of other people. Two days later, the company cancelled the evictions and agreed to negotiate.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Luke Melonakos-Harrison, the vice-president of the Connecticut Tenants Union, graduated earlier this year from Yale&#39;s Divinity School. “I had some anxiety when I got into organizing as a Yale student, trying to get involved in New Haven,” he told me. “There&#39;s definitely tension there, and bad histories.” There were also commonalities. When he and his wife rented their first apartment in New Haven, the bathroom ceiling nearly crashed down on their heads—and the rent wasn&#39;t cheap. “Everyone&#39;s rent is going up and everyone hates their landlord,” Acharya said. While door-knocking three days a week, she found that housing issues got people talking, which she could use to segue into conversations about politics. A primary election was coming up, and the Yale unions had endorsed Elicker for a second term and twenty-two candidates for alder seats. Three of those alder candidates were running for the first time. A handful of others—including the fourth-term president, Walker-Myers—were incumbents dating back to Aldermania. Acharya could point to plenty of achievements: Elicker and the union-backed alders had passed the ordinance legalizing tenants&#39; unions; they had steered pandemic-relief funds toward social services; they had pushed Yale to pay more in taxes. “I didn&#39;t realize how much the union was gonna feel like a political campaign,” Acharya told me. “It &lt;em>;was&lt;/em>; a political campaign.” ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot;

>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;When Japanese audiences encountered Puccini&#39;s “Madama Butterfly”—a sumptuous Italianate treatment of a geisha&#39;s doomed love for an American naval officer—they found it implausible, insulting, and riotously funny. In 1925, two decades after the opera&#39;s première, the &lt;em>;Japan Times&lt;/em>; reported “screams of hearty laughter” as spectators took in the posturings of a touring foreign troupe. Puccini&#39;s habit of citing popular Japanese songs did not help matters. As Arthur Groos points out in “Madama Butterfly/Madamu Batafurai,” a new book about the opera&#39;s Japanese sources and reception, the composer ignored advice about how to use his material appropriately. When Suzuki, Butterfly&#39;s maid, prays at an alleged Buddhist shrine, she sings to the tune of “Takai Yama,” a song that extols cucumbers and eggplants. Furthermore, she garbles the names of Shinto gods, who don&#39;t belong in a Buddhist setting to begin with. It&#39;s similar, Groos writes, to “having a Catholic pray to Adam and Eve in front of a menorah.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Nevertheless, Japanese audiences and artists have continued to engage with “Butterfly,” not least because it has influenced Western perceptions of Japan for generations. In the fifties, the Fujiwara Opera, based in Tokyo, collaborated with New York City Opera on a bilingual production: Japanese singers took the Japanese roles, and white singers portrayed the callous Lieutenant Pinkerton and the more sympathetic consul Sharpless. The 1953 musical “Chōchō-san Sandaiki” (“Three-Generation Butterfly”) wove Puccini&#39;s characters and music into a tale of Japan under Allied occupation; the fact that the opera is set in Nagasaki added a shuddering layer of significance to that retelling. The scholar Mari Yoshihara, in a 2004 essay about the pioneering Japanese soprano Tamaki Miura, who won international fame as Butterfly, notes that the singer challenged restricted ideas of femininity at home.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Today, as the American opera business grapples anew with the political baggage of its repertory, a fresh wave of “Butterfly” productions is arriving, with people of East Asian descent dominating the creative teams. Amon Miyamoto, Aria Umezawa, and Phil Chan have lately directed the work, at San Francisco Opera, New Orleans Opera, and Boston Lyric Opera, respectively. Earlier this month, at Detroit Opera, I saw a staging by Matthew Ozawa in which the story is framed as the increasingly disturbed fantasy of a modern American guy addicted to anime imagery and to VR technology.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Some operagoers will inevitably protest that “Butterfly” should be left alone, as an innocent artifact of its time. Yet a work that delves into late-nineteenth-century sexual colonialism and makes ironic use of “The Star-Spangled Banner” cannot be stripped of its politics. As Groos and other scholars have noted, “Butterfly,” especially in its original version, has an anti-imperialist streak; Pinkerton, who goes through the motions of marrying Butterfly and then discards her, is a devastating caricature of cultural arrogance. After the opera&#39;s unsuccessful première, at La Scala, in 1904, Puccini softened the Pinkerton character, but there remains enough of the initial idea for directors to run with. Butterfly, for her part, may be hemmed in by Orientalist stereotypes, yet she draws power from the opulence of the music that Puccini wrote for her. Grotesque in some ways, greathearted in others, “Butterfly” is the kind of piece that not only invites but requires reflection on the part of performers and spectators alike.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;At the beginning of Ozawa&#39;s “Butterfly” in Detroit, we see a bored young man alone in his apartment, which is decorated with Japanese posters and tchotchkes. He gets a beer out of the fridge—Sapporo or Kirin, no doubt. You have the sense of an emotionally shut-down business bro who studied for a semester in Tokyo. He settles into a chair and picks up his VR gear, at which point his modern world dematerializes. Ceremonially clad characters step out of the fridge; imperial sets slide forward. When Pinkerton is not in a scene, the singer who plays him often hovers to the side, gesturing and twitching in an indolent trance.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;The framing is ingenious because it compensates for the opera&#39;s misbegotten notions of Japan. When Shinto names are mangled, or when Chinese folk songs come out of nowhere, we can blame the protagonist&#39;s muddled reverie. Even Puccini&#39;s most questionable choice in his revision of the score—giving Pinkerton an aria of bathetic remorse—can be justified as a spasm of performative self-pity on the part of the player&#39;s avatar. I remain convinced that the original “Butterfly,” in which the cowardly Pinkerton slinks away while “The Star-Spangled Banner” snarls dissonantly in his wake, is superior; New York City Opera&#39;s staging of it in 1993 transformed my perspective on the work. But I also recognize the practical need to give the lead tenor something a bit more gratifying to sing.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Puccini, a sovereign artist terrified of commercial failure, tinkered with “Butterfly” for several years, steadily backtracking on his provocative initial conception. Ozawa drops some of the later changes, essentially adhering to a version that was presented in Brescia, several months after the première. The most crucial difference comes in the Act II aria “Che tua madre,” in which Butterfly, processing the news that Pinkerton has abandoned her, imagines her future and that of Dolore, her child. In the Brescia version, as in the original, she spins out a triumphant scenario in which Dolore is discovered by the Emperor and raised to a high station. Puccini later inserted a different, more lachrymose text, one that forecasts her suicide. The original Butterfly is a prouder, steelier character, a shade closer to the imperious Tosca.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;So she was in Detroit, in a formidable embodiment by Karah Son. Like many sopranos of East Asian background, Son has sung Butterfly over and over—in her case, more than three hundred times. She has not lapsed into routine. Her rendition of “Un bel dì” was a full-blown psychodrama, more a feverish hallucination of Pinkerton&#39;s return than a hopeful vision of it. Eric Taylor, as Pinkerton, brought to bear full-voiced lyric ardor while also communicating the character&#39;s rising unease over his entangled desires. Nmon Ford, as Sharpless, and Kristen Choi, as Suzuki, deftly navigated the show&#39;s imaginary landscape. Kensho Watanabe, in the pit, led a confidently paced, vibrantly colored performance.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;What I like most in this “Butterfly,” which has also played at Cincinnati Opera and will travel next to Utah Opera and Pittsburgh Opera, is its conjuring of stage pictures that are at once beautiful to look at and troubling to think about. Ozawa&#39;s collaborators—the design collective known as dots, the costume designer Maiko Matsushima, and the lighting designer Yuki Nakase Link—festoon the scene with glowing lanterns, cherry blossoms, and the like, but the images have a tacky, CGI-like glow. Sometimes figures freeze and lights flicker, signalling a breakdown in the smooth function of the fantasy. It wasn&#39;t clear to what extent the audience grasped the deconstructive agenda; I heard confused mutterings at intermission. The message of the closing tableau, though, should have been unmistakable. After Butterfly stabs herself, Pinkerton rushes onstage and clutches her, only to be left holding her bloody garment as she strides away. At the final, shocking triple-forte chord, she fixes the audience with an icy stare.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;There are days, many days, when I miss the old City Opera. It rejuvenated audience favorites, like “Butterfly,” which remained piles of bric-a-brac at the Met. It took chances on American singers instead of flying in jet-lagged European stars. And it featured new works that the bigger company discovered only decades later. The Met opened its current season with Jake Heggie&#39;s “Dead Man Walking”; City Opera presented the work in 2002, with the young Joyce DiDonato leading the cast. Coming in November is Anthony Davis&#39;s “X: The Life and Times of Malcolm X,” which had its world première at City Opera in 1986. If the Met is looking for more inspiration in past City Opera seasons, it might consider Bernd Alois Zimmermann&#39;s “Die Soldaten” (1991), Erich Wolfgang Korngold&#39;s “Die Tote Stadt” (1975), and Alberto Ginastera&#39;s “Don Rodrigo” (1966). Or it could come up with new ideas.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“X,” which Detroit Opera revived last year, is a major work whose impact has deepened with time. “Dead Man Walking,” based on Sister Helen Prejean&#39;s account of her friendship with a death-row inmate, made a feebler impression on its return to New York. It&#39;s an uncommonly popular piece, having been staged by more than seventy companies around the world. But the score is derivative and discursive, reacting to the story instead of driving it. At the Met, the opera felt like a movie of the week blown up to CinemaScope dimensions. Frantically loud orchestral playing, under the overeager baton of Yannick Nézet-Séguin, only amplified the music&#39;s limitations. DiDonato, again playing Sister Helen, and Ryan McKinny, as the inmate, were vocally secure and theatrically incisive; the production, by Ivo van Hove, undercut them with video trickery and a relentlessly chilly mise en scène. The execution scene had a clinical vividness, yet the barbaric politics of the death penalty remained an abstraction. Curiously, “Butterfly” in Detroit seemed more of the moment: it suggested how the virtual realm can infect and degrade the real one, turning us into prisoners of other people&#39;s fantasies. ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot;

It was November, 2017, and my family had just moved into our house in Princeton. The trees were shedding their leaves, in a theatrical manner that was new to us—we had relocated from California to the East Coast four months earlier.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“There are some roses,” Brigid said. “Those look like lilies.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“And those are hostas.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;There were six or seven rose bushes, with residual flowers, fuchsia-colored, shivering on top of the near-leafless branches. Lilies and hostas, their leaves already paled and half rotted by the cold autumn rain, remained recognizable. The rest of the garden was a wilted mystery, buried under fallen leaves.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I was not a character, but I was speaking like one for a reason: I was pondering a set of characters. I went on and told Brigid about a moment in “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Saga-Century-Trilogy-Fountain-Overflows-ebook/dp/B0090WRZYS/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1D21Z2MNESIPN&amp;amp;keywords=The%20Saga%20of%20the%20Century%20rebecca%20west&amp;amp;qid=1697748370&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;sprefix=the%20saga%20of%20the%20century%20rebecca%20wes,stripbooks,96&amp;amp;sr=1-1&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Saga-Century-Trilogy-Fountain-Overflows-ebook/dp/B0090WRZYS/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1D21Z2MNESIPN&amp;amp;keywords=The%20Saga%20of%20the%20Century%20rebecca%20west&amp;amp;qid=1697748370&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;sprefix=the%20saga%20of%20the%20century%20rebecca%20wes,stripbooks,96&amp;amp;sr=1-1&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Saga-Century-Trilogy-Fountain-Overflows-ebook/dp/B0090WRZYS/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1D21Z2MNESIPN&amp;amp;keywords=The%20Saga%20of%20the%20Century%20rebecca%20west&amp;amp;qid=1697748370&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;sprefix=the%20saga%20of%20the%20century%20rebecca%20wes,stripbooks,96&amp;amp;sr=1-1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;The Saga of the Century Trilogy&lt;/a>;,” by Rebecca West, about a British family living in London in the first half of the twentieth century. The eldest daughter in the family, Cordelia, newly wed, has moved into a pretty house in Kensington; when she has her two younger sisters over for a visit, she frets, with the leisure of a young woman married into respectability and stability, about not knowing whether the hawthorn tree in her garden will bear white, pink, or red flowers in the spring.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;A few chapters later, the hawthorn tree blooms. By then, the little brother of the family, Richard Quin, still a teen-ager, has been killed in the Great War, ten days after arriving in France. “Killed, not missing?” Cordelia cries out in agony when she&#39;s told the news.

Other days, they feel just right. The predicament when writing about a sudden, untimely death: the more you remember, the more elusive that death becomes. A sudden, untimely death is a black hole, absorbing all that you can give, not really clamoring for more. Though is a black hole ever to be fully filled so that it can cease to be one? Has anyone been able to define, capture, or even get close to a black hole?&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;[In September, 2017, our older son, Vincent, died by suicide, at sixteen.]&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;[On that day, we put down the deposit for the house.

In writing fiction, one avoids coincidences like that, which offer unearned drama, shoddy poignancy, convenient metaphor, predictable spectacle. Life, however, does not follow a novelist&#39;s discipline. Fiction, one suspects, is often tamer than life.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Some fiction is tamer than some life, I should amend. And I confess that this is only a variation of a statement made by another character in “The Saga of the Century Trilogy,” who, upon discovering her husband&#39;s extramarital affair, reads “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Madame-Bovary-Penguin-Classics-Deluxe/dp/014310649X/ref=sr_1_4?crid=1GS2TAQUI4J9F&amp;amp;keywords=madame%20bovary&amp;amp;qid=1697748590&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;sprefix=madame%20bovar,stripbooks,82&amp;amp;sr=1-4&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Madame-Bovary-Penguin-Classics-Deluxe/dp/014310649X/ref=sr_1_4?crid=1GS2TAQUI4J9F&amp;amp;keywords=madame%20bovary&amp;amp;qid=1697748590&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;sprefix=madame%20bovar,stripbooks,82&amp;amp;sr=1-4&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Madame-Bovary-Penguin-Classics-Deluxe/dp/014310649X/ref=sr_1_4?crid=1GS2TAQUI4J9F&amp;amp;keywords=madame%20bovary&amp;amp;qid=1697748590&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;sprefix=madame%20bovar,stripbooks,82&amp;amp;sr=1-4&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;Madame Bovary&lt;/a>;” and exclaims, “But art is so much more real than life. Some art is much more real than some life, I mean.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;A couple of months after Vincent died, a colleague asked me where I was “in the process of grieving,” assuming, I supposed, that there would be, and should be, a conclusion of mourning at some point. That phrase struck me as inaccurate; she might as well have asked me where I was “in the process of living.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;There is, alas, not a normal course of life, against which deviations can be measured and, hopefully, corrected. Only changed courses, altered lives. One can look longingly at the alternatives: Vincent graduating from high school (as our younger son did this summer) or graduating from college (as Vincent&#39;s old school friends will next year), but alternatives belong to the realm of fiction. To paraphrase Elizabeth Bowen, the great Anglo-Irish writer, good fiction is good because it offers “the palpable presence of the alternatives.” In life, that presence can be palpably felt, but too much preoccupation with the alternatives may lead to a dilemma of either/or; even, neither here nor there. “Dilemma,” from its Greek etymology, means two lemmas: double assumptions, double propositions. But death is definitive; death does not lead to a dilemma.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;I think about the alternative lives of my characters all the time. But, as I did not live in fiction, I decided, soon after Vincent&#39;s death, to stop pondering the alternatives. &lt;em>;What if&lt;/em>; belongs to fiction; &lt;em>;what now&lt;/em>;, to this real life.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;What now, in the last months of 2017: I could not read fiction. It was not a problem of mental focus. I spent hours every day reading &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tag/william-shakespeare&quot;>;Shakespeare&lt;/a>;&#39;s plays and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/05/02/the-thrilling-mind-of-wallace-stevens&quot;>;Wallace Stevens&lt;/a>;&#39;s poems—all of a sudden, those words were the only ones that made sense to me. But if I stopped reading fiction would I ever be able to write fiction again? I was in the middle of a long novel. Forging ahead or scrapping the project felt equally impossible. Anguished, I looked up “anguish” in the OED, to make sure that I was using the right word to describe my situation, and, indeed, it was an apt word choice. Etymologically, “anguish” comes to us from the Latin &lt;em>;angustia&lt;/em>;—narrowness, lack of space, narrow space, narrow passage, strait, limitations, restrictions, confinement, imprisonment, restrictedness, shortage, scantiness, critical situation, narrow-mindedness, pettiness.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;A black hole takes all and gives back naught. The anguish from a sudden, untimely death has a narrowing effect: alternatives are lost; space in the mind, too.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;On her next visit, Brigid brought me two books. The first was “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Onward-Upward-Garden-Review-Classics/dp/1590178505/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2HSD3E1J99O1A&amp;amp;keywords=Onward%20and%20Upward%20in%20the%20Garden&amp;amp;qid=1697748739&amp;amp;sprefix=onward%20and%20upward%20in%20the%20garden,aps,188&amp;amp;sr=8-1&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Onward-Upward-Garden-Review-Classics/dp/1590178505/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2HSD3E1J99O1A&amp;amp;keywords=Onward%20and%20Upward%20in%20the%20Garden&amp;amp;qid=1697748739&amp;amp;sprefix=onward%20and%20upward%20in%20the%20garden,aps,188&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Onward-Upward-Garden-Review-Classics/dp/1590178505/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2HSD3E1J99O1A&amp;amp;keywords=Onward%20and%20Upward%20in%20the%20Garden&amp;amp;qid=1697748739&amp;amp;sprefix=onward%20and%20upward%20in%20the%20garden,aps,188&amp;amp;sr=8-1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;Onward and Upward in the Garden&lt;/a>;,” a collection of fourteen essays by the former &lt;em>;New Yorker&lt;/em>; fiction editor &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1996/02/26/lady-with-a-pencil&quot;>;Katharine S. White&lt;/a>;. The essays were originally published, in a span of twelve years, in the magazine, ostensibly as reviews of nursery catalogues. The other book was “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Two-Gardeners-Katharine-Lawrence-Friendship/dp/0807085588/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2YION9QR196CG&amp;amp;keywords=Two%20Gardeners:%20A%20Friendship%20in%20Letters&amp;amp;qid=1697748815&amp;amp;sprefix=two%20gardeners%20a%20friendship%20in%20letters,aps,84&amp;amp;sr=8-1&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Two-Gardeners-Katharine-Lawrence-Friendship/dp/0807085588/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2YION9QR196CG&amp;amp;keywords=Two%20Gardeners:%20A%20Friendship%20in%20Letters&amp;amp;qid=1697748815&amp;amp;sprefix=two%20gardeners%20a%20friendship%20in%20letters,aps,84&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Two-Gardeners-Katharine-Lawrence-Friendship/dp/0807085588/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2YION9QR196CG&amp;amp;keywords=Two%20Gardeners:%20A%20Friendship%20in%20Letters&amp;amp;qid=1697748815&amp;amp;sprefix=two%20gardeners%20a%20friendship%20in%20letters,aps,84&amp;amp;sr=8-1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;Two Gardeners: A Friendship in Letters&lt;/a>;,” a collection of correspondence between White and Elizabeth Lawrence. Lawrence was a gardener and a gardening writer in North Carolina, and the friendship began when Lawrence wrote a fan letter to White after reading her first essay, “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1958/03/01/book-review-onward-upward-in-the-garden-t&quot;>;A Romp in the Catalogues&lt;/a>;,” in the March 1, 1958, issue of &lt;em>;The New Yorker&lt;/em>;. For a year, they were “Mrs. White” and “Miss Lawrence” to each other, and then they became “Katharine” and “Elizabeth.” They would write to each other for the next nineteen years, until White&#39;s death, in 1977.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Through the winter, I read the two books, very slowly. There was no reason to hurry, as that first winter was a long one; cold, snowy—cold and snowy for recent transplants from California, in any case. Day after day, I looked at the bare limbs of the trees, brownish gray, and the stale snow covering the garden, grayish white. I thought one afternoon, What if spring never returns? Right away I recognized the illogic and the melodrama of that thought. I had at my hand the words of two gardeners of yesteryear, books that had taken years to be written. Were these words not enough evidence that spring always comes, if not now, later?&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;[That winter, I often returned to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tag/marianne-moore&quot;>;Marianne Moore&lt;/a>;&#39;s words: “If nothing charms or sustains us (and we are getting food and fresh air) it is for us to say, &#39;If not now, later,&#39; and not mope.” Incidentally, it was Moore who may have first suggested that White should collect her reviews of garden catalogues into a book.]&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Not to mope, I thought, was a proper goal: it would take all my energy and all my vigilance, and it was attainable. White&#39;s essays and the letters between White and Lawrence were just right for that aspiration. The two women (and likely some of the gardens and many of the plants that they had written about) were no more, and yet their words remained and sustained, offering facts and opinions, gardening tales and personal woes, seasons and years, illnesses and deaths—all there, ready to distract me.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;For instance, there were the names of plants to learn. In both books, I encountered many names, some familiar, others unfamiliar, and every one of them—even the most common, like “peony” or “lotus” or “fuchsia”—required investigation. Unlike Lawrence, I&#39;m not a purist when it comes to botany, and I don&#39;t always look up the Latin names for the plants. But I do like to know the etymology of their English names. And what one can learn just by going to the dictionary! “Peony” goes all the way back to ancient Greek: Paieon, or Paeon, was the physician of the gods. (What afflicts the gods? Possibly what afflicts us mortals.) “Lotus” comes from the Greek &lt;em>;lōtos&lt;/em>;, a mythical plant bringing forgetfulness to those who eat its fruits. (I have eaten my share of lotus seeds, a delicacy in Chinese cuisine, without achieving oblivion.) “Fuchsia,” a word I often misspelled as “fuschia”—what mythical story accompanies thee? It turns out that fuchsia was named for the sixteenth-century German physician and botanist Leonhard Fuchs, whose name gave birth not only to that of the flower and that of the color but also to the nickname, Fuchsienstadt, for his home town of Wemding, where there is a pyramid made of as many as seven hundred fuchsia plants. And yet Fuchs never saw the flower fuchsia in his lifetime: it was discovered in the Caribbean and named by the French botanist and monk Charles Plumier, who was born a hundred and forty-five years after Fuchs. What led Plumier to name the flower for Fuchs? One can ask the question, but any speculation would be closer to fiction, just as peony was once the physician of the gods and lotus would bring forgetfulness.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;o0tki7&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Nearer our time—nearer than Fuchs and Plumier—were the horticulturists, seedsmen, growers, some older than White, others her contemporaries, behind those nursery catalogues which were once scrutinized by her. “They are as individualistic . 。 。 as any Faulkner or Hemingway, and they can be just as frustrating or rewarding,” White wrote. And what a great joy to get to know the Faulkners and Hemingways of the nursery world through her words. Signing off for the catalogue of White Flower Farm was one Amos Pettingill. “I have no idea whether Amos Pettingill is a real person—the name sounds like an ill-advised fabrication,” White observed. Real or not, the name alone, I thought, was enough to send one&#39;s imagination on a detour to Dickens-land. In the catalogue of White Flower Farm, Mr. Pettingill claimed that its French Pussy Willow was “not the unreliable wild Pussy Willow,” which led White to protest, “What is unreliable, pray, about the native wild pussies? I have found them trustworthy in every respect.” David Burpee, the president of the W. Atlee Burpee &amp;amp; Company, campaigned to have the marigold recognized as the national flower of the United States. White, describing “David Burpee&#39;s one-man lobby,” noted, “I was also pleased as well as entertained, a couple of years back, when Mr. Burpee in person went to Washington, bearing marigold boutonnières for the legislators, and, at a Congressional hearing on naming a national flower, faced down the Senatorial proponents of grass, the corn tassel, the rose, and the carnation.” (Mr. Burpee did not succeed; the rose prevailed to become the national flower.)&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;To catch a glimpse, in White&#39;s essays, of these men and women who once lived in their gardens, cultivating, hybridizing, dreaming of colors and shapes and scents that would catch their fancy, and then turning their obsessions into words, hoping that their catalogues would catch the fancy of many gardeners&#39; hearts: there is nothing narrowing in the world of roses, dahlias, marigolds, tulips, daylilies, and chrysanthemums. They were not black holes but rabbit holes.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;And, of course, there were White and Lawrence, knowledgeable, opinionated, delighting in miscellanies. In her first letter, Lawrence recommended that White write about Cecil Houdyshel&#39;s catalogues (which always opened with “Dear Floral Friends”): “I think he is in his nineties now, so you had better hurry.” In reply, White confessed, “I am always nervous when I write about old people.” Both women saw a garden writer in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tag/lewis-carroll&quot;>;Lewis Carroll&lt;/a>;.

rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;Through the Looking-Glass&lt;/a>;,” the first fiction I read after Vincent&#39;s death. The books, of course, have less to do with the missed or lost alternatives; instead, they make perfect nonsense out of the alternatives.]&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;After we moved into the house, I ordered twenty-five hyacinth bulbs (Delft Blue) and buried them haphazardly in the corners where I was certain that they would not interfere with any existing plants. Twenty-five, in retrospect, was a touchingly small number—a gesture rather than a plan, a prelude to a dream rather than a dream realized. But a gardener, like a writer, must start somewhere. (Last fall, I planted eight hundred bulbs; the fall before, seven hundred.)&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Because of those twenty-five bulbs, garden catalogues began to arrive. One could be realistic: it had taken little time for one&#39;s address to be shared among the nurseries. One could also be romantic: imagine that tentative order of bulbs as a small bugle, announcing a budding gardener. The catalogues, though radically improved graphically from the ones reviewed by White, still bore the same names: White Flower Farm, Wayside Gardens, Park Seed Company, W. Atlee Burpee &amp;amp; Company, and several more. I perused the catalogues as I imagined White and Lawrence had done; although new to this literature, I had yet to cultivate my tastes and form my opinions.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;It occurred to me one day that no one had made a catalogue of gardeners: professional gardeners, who might be like important cultivars, bearing poetic or eccentric names; amateurs, akin to common carnations and cornflowers; and those, like me, who were gardeners only in their fantasies. Such a catalogue, abundant with human stories, would be amusing to read, no? I then realized that I was, true to my profession, fictioneering again.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;When I was growing up, in Beijing, my family lived on the ground floor of an apartment block, so we were lucky to have a tiny lot, about two metres by 1.5 metres. My father, who had come from poor peasant stock, gardened judiciously: a grapevine that produced very sweet grapes (often pillaged by the wasps), our favorite green beans (which bore the name “pig ears”), loofahs (good for soup when the gourds were young and tender; when they were old and fibrous, they made the best kitchen scrubs), a honeysuckle plant (dried honeysuckle flowers can be used as medicinal tea). One year, when I was four or five, he planted some potatoes and described to me the unforgettable flavor of new potatoes. The only other time I have heard such a rapturous description of new potatoes was from an Irish poet in Cork.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;My father did not garden for beauty. Some years, he would plant a cluster of impatiens, which he called “fingernail flowers” because, in the old days, the pink and red petals had been used when painting girls&#39; fingernails. The only constant floral decorations in our garden were the morning glories, self-seeding and wildly vivacious. Once, two women laughed at our garden to my face, dismissing my father as a lazy gardener who grew flowers that were no more than weeds. I was too young and too intimidated to defend him: he was a nuclear physicist, but he also did all the grocery shopping and most of the housework, cooked three meals a day for the family, and gardened in his spare time.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;People who cultivated peonies and roses and orchids were not necessarily kind, which was not a surprise. I had learned from Chinese history that cold-blooded dictators—&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tag/mao-zedong&quot;>;Chairman Mao&lt;/a>;, for instance—had also written heartrending poetry, and that capricious dynastic tyrants had often been supreme calligraphers and painters. On the other hand, people who were cruel to garden plants could easily extend that cruelty to human beings. One day, my mother uprooted the honeysuckle for no other reason than that she could—so she would—inflict pain. My father mourned, and I seethed, though we both did so quietly.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;When the spring of 2018 arrived, I, the daughter of my pragmatic father, started by growing vegetables in containers—I was still waiting for the flowers in the garden to emerge and show themselves to me. In the next two years, I grew Chinese celtuce, baby bok choy, green beans, eggplants, tomatoes, sweet peppers, okra, and a variety of herbs, and ended up having plenty of opportunities to observe at close hand birds and squirrels, snails and slugs, aphids and spider mites, and all the other archenemies of a garden. Various campaigns were carried out: I ordered live ladybugs, hundreds at a time, and released them in the evenings after it rained, hoping that they would not fly away; I hung up birdhouses, waiting for wrens to move in and feed their chicks with my garden&#39;s offering of bugs; fake snakes were strategically placed to ward off rodents, and they did little but frighten me every time I stepped on their rubbery bodies.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;And then there is the problem without any solution: the bigger animals. Deer graze undiscriminatingly (but luckily, in my case, only in the front yard, for the back yard is fenced). The fence, of course, does nothing to deter rabbits. (On a visit I paid to the Irish writer &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/contributors/william-trevor&quot;>;William Trevor&lt;/a>;, at his house in Devon, he pointed out rolls of metal mesh, to be buried at a certain depth—inches? feet? I forgot how much—into the ground as a rabbit fence. I have yet to be so enterprising.) The rabbits show up in late May or early June, fist-size fluffs, and a month later they can stand on their hind feet and stretch more than a foot tall. They chomp down everything and turn me into a maddened Mrs. McGregor. (I will never believe any catalogue if it dares label a plant rabbit-resistant.) Next comes our resident groundhog. Perhaps there is more than one, but they all look the same to me: giant and comical. The groundhogs are the most effective destroyers of a garden. I named ours for an infamous politician, although a friend, quite sensibly, pointed out that calling the groundhog by the politician&#39;s name was an insult to the animal: the groundhog is doing only what he&#39;s supposed to do, tramping and feasting in what he considers his garden.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;One early summer morning, I looked out the window and saw two deer and a rabbit in my front garden, eating up some hydrangea bushes I had planted a few weeks earlier. It occurred to me that, had I been able to go back to my childhood self and tell her that one day I would live in a place where rabbits and deer eat side by side peacefully, the child would be incredulous: certainly no real people could live in a fairy tale like that?&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;i11q09&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;“I am sure that if you had been told when you were a child about all the things that you were going to have to do, you would have thought you had better die at once, you would not have believed you could ever have the strength to do them.” In West&#39;s trilogy, Richard Quin says this to his mother before he leaves to be killed in France. Had I been able to go back to my childhood self and tell her that one day I would live as a mother who has lost a son, the child would be equally incredulous: surely such things happen only in fiction, to characters who are much more interesting and tragic?&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;My garden this spring looks a little different from the garden that came back to life in the spring of 2018. For two years in a row, it was razed by an endless army of rabbits, and, by late summer, it looked like a sad head suffering irregular hair loss, with large bald patches and some surviving stalks of flowers. But this, I had learned from White and Lawrence, is only part of a garden&#39;s fate. In a letter from the spring of 1960, Lawrence reported to White about her magnolia, “We had a real frost last night (almost unheard of for mid-April) and &lt;em>;Magnolia Lennei&lt;/em>; is covered with brown rags. I am going to chop it down, for this happens too often.” In her reply, White wrote, “I called home and learned that mice had eaten and destroyed nine of my old-fashioned rose bushes, so I am extra sympathetic about the magnolia.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Anything can happen in a garden, nothing lasts, and yet something can always be made out of the soil, even with the most destructive weather, even when rabbits and groundhogs and Japanese beetles join forces, greedy and ruthless. All things in the garden, just as in life, are provisional and impermanent. One gardens with the same unblinded hope and the same willingness to concede as one lives, always ready to say, If not now, later; if not this year, next year.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;But these sentiments would have sounded preachy had I said them to Vincent when he was alive. (The truth is, I would not have been able to, since I had not yet learned them myself.) A few weeks before his death, when we were touring the house with real-estate agents, he said to me, “This garden needs improvement. I can&#39;t wait to garden with you.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;One can linger in that memory, but there is no reason to attach too much meaning to it. A garden is not a shrine. Living is not metaphorizing. I don&#39;t always think about Vincent&#39;s plan to work alongside me when I potter in the garden. A garden is trustworthy only at this moment, in this now: the past is irrevocable, the future unpredictable.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;[Though I did plant a special patch of tulips for Vincent last fall: Tulipa Vincent van Gogh, dark and mysterious, and Tulipa Ballerina, golden and elegant.]&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Five years later, I still consider myself a beginning gardener. I&#39;m avid, but always ready to surrender to disappointments, to setbacks, to failures and deaths. Unlike White and Lawrence, I garden without a design. (From &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2005/02/14/andy&quot;>;E. B. White&lt;/a>;&#39;s introduction to the essay collection, one gathers that Katharine&#39;s garden provided the right colors, shapes, and scents throughout the year.) Much of the planting and growing delights me because of the connections I can make.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;The blooming of the Vanessa Bell, one of my favorite roses from the David Austin catalogue, reminds me of one of the last public readings that William Trevor gave, in 2008; I had flown from California to England to attend the event, which took place in Charleston, Vanessa Bell and Duncan Grant&#39;s house in East Sussex. Emily Brontë, another of my favorite David Austin roses, blooms with what I call “a wuthering tenderness,” and when the Emily Brontës are blooming I always think of my first reading of “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Wuthering-Heights-Penguin-Classics-Bront%C3%AB/dp/0141439556/ref=sr_1_3?crid=1HL1KLVP7V91Q&amp;amp;keywords=wuthering%20heights&amp;amp;qid=1697749633&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;sprefix=wuthering%20heigh,stripbooks,100&amp;amp;sr=1-3&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Wuthering-Heights-Penguin-Classics-Bront%C3%AB/dp/0141439556/ref=sr_1_3?crid=1HL1KLVP7V91Q&amp;amp;keywords=wuthering%20heights&amp;amp;qid=1697749633&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;sprefix=wuthering%20heigh,stripbooks,100&amp;amp;sr=1-3&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Wuthering-Heights-Penguin-Classics-Bront%C3%AB/dp/0141439556/ref=sr_1_3?crid=1HL1KLVP7V91Q&amp;amp;keywords=wuthering%20heights&amp;amp;qid=1697749633&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;sprefix=wuthering%20heigh,stripbooks,100&amp;amp;sr=1-3&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;Wuthering Heights&lt;/a>;,” as a teen-ager in Beijing. Mystified and electrified, I held on to the book as though it offered a refuge for my mind, but I now suspect that I was only pretending to understand the passion and the drama in the story. A few Roald Dahls from David Austin were planted because Dahl was among my children&#39;s favorite authors when they were young. The Lady of Shalott and Tess of the d&#39;Urbervilles for poetry and fiction. The Lady Gardener as a self-mocking gesture.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Over the past few years, I&#39;ve added a dozen hydrangea bushes to the garden, because one of my characters, Lilia—who, like me, lost a child at the age of forty-four—has grown hydrangeas all her life with a passion. [It was the novel I was working on when Vincent died. I had already written about the death of Lilia&#39;s child when I encountered the same loss.]&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Daylilies are not really my favorite, but I grow them because in my father&#39;s village in southern China the soil is the meagrest type, and the only crops my father&#39;s family could grow were yams and daylilies; the flowers were harvested for culinary use—a delicacy for other people.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Some flowers in my garden have been inherited from the previous owners: astilbes, baptisias, azaleas, and buddleias. When the astilbes bloom, their white flowers make a shimmering mass in the sun, countering the meaning of their name, in Greek, as something that does not shimmer. The baptisias have indigo flowers, and the name comes from the Greek: to dip, to immerse, to dye (which shares the root with “baptism”). Azaleas&#39; name, too, comes from the Greek, meaning “dry,” but there is nothing dry about these flowers. Buddleias, however, were simply named for an English botanist, Adam Buddle.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Primroses bloom early, before the roses. Anemones (ancient Greek&#39;s daughters of the wind) wave their strikingly colorful and delicate flowers in the spring breeze. Geraniums (from the Greek: cranes) expand long-leggedly. Campanulas (from the Latin: little bells) produce bell-shaped flowers without making a cacophony. These and other varieties I have added to the garden. Some have stayed and prospered. Others have proved to be a trustworthy food supply for rabbits. Delphiniums, I have learned, can never stay in the garden for more than a few days. Dianthus and phlox are a game of statistics, which is possibly just like fate; if they survive the raids of the rabbits, they have neither themselves nor me to credit.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;When Vincent was in the eighth grade, I drove him and a friend, a girl, back from a birthday party, and, like all mothers, I eavesdropped on their conversation. They were discussing the girl&#39;s decision not to participate in a poetry contest. She had read the previous winners, she said, and they were composed of words such as “injustice,” “inequality,” “empowerment,” “action.” “What I don&#39;t understand,” the girl said, “is why can&#39;t we write about flowers anymore.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Of course we can,” Vincent said. “But . 。 .”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;He did not finish the sentence. I wondered if he was asking: Is there still a place for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tag/emily-dickinson&quot;>;Emily Dickinson&lt;/a>; these days?&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Every spring, when the first flush of David Austin roses bloom, there is always a moment when I turn, in my mind, to Vincent. “Here&#39;s something you haven&#39;t seen: these roses.” The line is offered as a fact, not as an argument, for a rose is never an argument. There is no such thing as an angry rose or a moping rose or an empowered rose; only a realistic rose, a matter-of-fact rose, a transient rose.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;A garden is a place full of random, diverting, and irrelevant happenings, and a garden, as good as a rabbit hole, serves also as an antidote to a black hole. These days, I often get up early. Every flower seems to require an individual greeting from me. In the Buddhist tradition, one encounters sayings like “A flower is a world, a grass leaf is a paradise.” But I, not quite a believer in any kind of religion or metaphor, would rather think that each flower in my garden holds some concrete space, a physical one as well as a temporal one. A flower, like a thought, a sentence, a book, is but a placeholder. ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 23 Oct 2023 20:06:01 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Revenge of the Luddites!]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/10/30/revenge-of-the-luddites]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-23T10:00:00.000Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6532ea970b537a206b5acdbc/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/231030_r43257illuweb-site.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;article >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attribute-verso-pattern=&quot;article-body&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;ArticlePageChunks&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;“I&#39;m absolutely a Luddite,” the author and columnist Brian Merchant said the other day at an outdoor café in Brooklyn. He has long, brown hair and a goatee, and was wearing a plaid shirt over a T-shirt that read “The Luddites Were Right.” On the chair next to him sat an HP printer.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Merchant feels that the original Luddites, early-nineteenth-century cloth-makers who raided British factories and destroyed the new machines that were replacing them, have been getting a bad rap lately. Modern people tend to see them as fools who didn&#39;t appreciate the benefits of technology. In Merchant&#39;s view, the Luddites saw the future all too clearly: new machinery meant that the work they had previously done in their own homes would now be done in factories, as mass production, destroying the workers&#39; way of life.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“It wasn&#39;t so much resisting any kind of change—it was resisting getting steamrolled, getting crushed and thrown into poverty,” Merchant said. “They were more anti-poverty than they were anti-technology.” He thinks their rebellion, which came after more peaceful attempts to save their jobs failed, was “morally justified.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;He sees parallels in the present, including people throwing rocks at Google&#39;s employee buses, actors striking over streaming pay, writers protesting the use of artificial intelligence, and activists placing construction cones on driverless cars to scramble their computers. “That&#39;s a Luddite tactic right there,” Merchant said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;He was about to host what he called a Luddite Tribunal at Starr Bar, around the corner, to celebrate his new book, “Blood in the Machine,” about the history of the movement. Merchant and other tech critics—the artist Molly Crabapple; the podcast host Edward Ongweso, Jr. (“This Machine Kills”); the labor reporter Alex Press; and Paris Marx, the host of “Tech Won&#39;t Save Us”—planned to hold up pieces of technology, debate whether they caused more harm than good, and then smash the condemned objects to bits. Merchant had brought an eight-pound sledgehammer purchased from a local hardware store. (He shuns Amazon.)&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;At the bar, he explained that the panel would “try” the printer and a Ring camera he&#39;d brought, and accept submissions from the audience. “You have to have something that&#39;s, like, satisfying to smash,” he said. “I think we&#39;re gonna have to have a blast radius.” He supplied the front row with safety goggles.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;One of the bar&#39;s events managers, Quinton Counts, wasn&#39;t fazed by the potential for glass projectiles and flying motherboard shards. “We get it all,” he said. “It&#39;s Bushwick.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Two guys were sitting in the front row with cans of beer. One of them, Christian Cmehil-Warn, an MIT grad student with long hair and a red T-shirt, said that he worried about AI being used to oppress workers and make unjust decisions about loans and housing. His friend, a former professional gamer who has a graduate degree in quantitative finance (and who didn&#39;t want to be identified), said he&#39;d become skeptical of technology after realizing that the industry he works in—mobile gaming—had created the equivalent of online slot machines, primed to drive addiction. “It&#39;s, like, sixty to ninety per cent of the revenues come from one per cent of the people,” he said. “They&#39;re essentially degenerate gamblers being exploited by sophisticated algorithms.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;As the room filled up with other tech skeptics, Cmehil-Warn said that, at MIT, scientists were developing robots and apps without considering how they would be used. “It&#39;s like Frankenstein&#39;s monster,” he said. “The guy just makes it and lets it go.” The former gamer was interested in the psychology of cults and scams and said that he was opposed to cryptocurrency, which he called a “multilevel-marketing scheme for tech bros.” Which technological development were they most worried about? “AI girlfriends,” the former gamer said without hesitating.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;David Gray Widder, fresh from Carnegie Mellon with a Ph.D. in computer science, sat down. He said that, as a student, he&#39;d protested the use of facial-recognition software by the Pittsburgh police. He wore a Garmin, rather than an Apple, watch. He had helped cause a kerfuffle at Carnegie Mellon (named after “two anti-labor philanthropy capitalists,” he said) in 2020, when he took a screwdriver and removed a “smart sensor,” which included a microphone, that had been preinstalled in his campus office. He put the sensor in a plexiglass box on a shelf and notified the department leadership of his concerns. (After a backlash, he reinstalled it.) Caleb Malchik, another computer scientist, took a seat next to him. He&#39;d been radicalized against tech in part by Edward Snowden and said that copyright posed a threat to free speech.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Look!” the former gamer said, holding up his phone screen. “I just got a recruiting e-mail from Meta. How&#39;s that for irony?”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Onstage, Merchant leaned forward on the handle of his hammer. “You know, it&#39;s important to point out that the Luddites were not just in a blind rage, smashing everything,” he said. “They were very tactical and very focussed on what was actually causing exploitation.” After significant effort, the panelists managed to break the Ring camera (“expanding the surveillance state”), and then tore up a hideous clown poster created using generative AI (“made basically from plagiarized work”). Then Merchant brought out the printer (a symbol of the indignities of office life which only works with Hewlett-Packard&#39;s own overpriced ink) and placed it on a chair.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“ &#39;Office Space&#39; that shit!” someone yelled. ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;rgjk0i&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;83ep3y&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 23 Oct 2023 20:06:01 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[The Real Cost of Plundering the Planet’s Resources]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/10/30/the-real-cost-of-plundering-the-planets-resources]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-23T10:00:00.000Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6530266723b1c7056b8e042f/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/231030_r43242.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;article >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attribute-verso-pattern=&quot;article-body&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;ArticlePageChunks&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;The town of Spruce Pine, North Carolina, doesn&#39;t have a lot to say for itself. Its Web site, which features a photo of a flowering tree next to a rusty bridge, notes that the town is “conveniently located between Asheville and Boone.” According to the latest census data, it has 2,332 residents and a population density of 498.1 per square mile. A recent story in the local newspaper concerned the closing of the Hardee&#39;s on Highway 19E; this followed an incident, back in May, when a fourteen-year-old boy who&#39;d eaten a biscuit at the restaurant began to hallucinate and had to be taken to the hospital. Without Spruce Pine, though, the global economy might well unravel.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Spruce Pine&#39;s planetary importance follows from an accident of geology. Some three hundred and eighty million years ago, during the late Devonian period, the continent of Africa was drifting toward what would eventually become eastern North America. The force of its movement pressed the floor of a Paleozoic sea deep into the earth&#39;s mantle, where, in effect, it melted. Over the course of tens of millions of years, the molten rock cooled to form deposits of exceptionally pure mica and quartz, which were then pushed back up toward the surface. In the twentieth century, Spruce Pine&#39;s mica was mined to make windows for coal-burning stoves and insulation for vacuum tubes. In the computer age, it&#39;s the town&#39;s quartz that&#39;s critical.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Silicon chips are essentially made of quartz, although this is a bit like saying that the “Mona Lisa” is essentially made of linseed oil. Manufacturing microchips is phenomenally complex and supremely exacting. The process generally begins with quartz&#39;s cousin, quartzite, which consists in large measure of silicon dioxide. Under very high heat, and in the presence of carbon, the quartzite gives up most of its oxygen. Then acid and a great deal more heat are applied, until the silicon reaches a purity level of 99.9999999 per cent, or, as it&#39;s known in the business, “nine nines.” At this point, the silicon is ready to be fashioned into a “boule,” or ingot, that weighs upward of two hundred pounds and consists of a single perfectly aligned crystal. It is here that Spruce Pine&#39;s quartz comes into play.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;To form a boule, pure silicon has to be heated in a special crucible to twenty-seven hundred degrees Fahrenheit. The crucible must be tough enough to withstand this temperature, and, at the same time, it must have the right chemical composition, so it won&#39;t introduce contaminants. The only substance that meets both these criteria is high-purity quartz, and one of the only spots where the right sort of quartz can be found is Spruce Pine.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Spruce Pine&#39;s quartz is so valuable that, as the Vancouver-based journalist Vince Beiser observes in his book “The World in a Grain,” almost everything about it, outside of its purity, is a closely guarded secret. The company that owns the town&#39;s largest mine—Sibelco, a Belgian conglomerate—doesn&#39;t publish production figures. When contractors arrive to make repairs at the mine, they are reportedly led to the equipment in blindfolds. According to documents filed in a case that the company once brought against a former employee, it tries to divvy up its contracting jobs, so that no individual can learn too much, and for the same reason it purchases its supplies from multiple venders.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;All this stealth, Ed Conway suggests in his new book, “Material World: The Six Raw Materials That Shape Modern Civilization” (Knopf), is justified. “There are few such cases where we are so utterly reliant on a single place,” he writes. He quotes an unnamed industry veteran who notes that someone flying a crop duster over Spruce Pine and releasing “a very particular powder” could “end the world&#39;s production of semiconductors” within six months. No production of semiconductors would mean no production of computers, cell phones, automobiles, microwaves, game consoles, fitness trackers, digital watches, digital cameras, televisions—the list goes on and on.&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;“Even in devices that don&#39;t have &#39;smart&#39; in their name, mechanical linkages have long since given way to a network of semiconductors,” Conway, a London-based journalist, observes. “Nearly every economic activity, nearly every dollar of global GDP, relies in one way or another on the microscopic switches of semiconductors.” Prudently, he does not reveal what that very particular powder is.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Of the ten largest corporations in the world, six are tech companies. In 2021, fifty per cent of Americans said they spend more than half the day in front of a screen, and a recent survey found that kids in the United States devote almost seven hours a day to staring at pixels. Statistics like these can produce the sense that matter doesn&#39;t matter all that much anymore. Conway thinks that this is an illusion, and a dangerous one. Contemporary society continues to rely on raw materials, like Spruce Pine&#39;s quartz, taken from the earth. Indeed, extraction rates, far from slowing, keep accelerating. These days, Conway reckons, humanity mines, drains, and blasts more stuff out of the ground each year than it did in total during the roughly three hundred millennia between the birth of the species and the start of the Korean War. This comes with immense consequences, both ecological and social, even if we don&#39;t attend to them.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Consider sand, the first of Conway&#39;s not so dark materials. According to a 2022 report from the United Nations Environment Programme, global demand for “sand resources” has tripled in the past two decades, to something like a hundred trillion pounds a year; this amounts to almost thirty-five pounds a day for every person on the planet. A lot of sand (though no one seems to know exactly how much) goes into land building. Among the world&#39;s biggest sand importers is Singapore, which has grown by more than fifty square miles since the nineteen-sixties. Among the major exporters is Vietnam, where sand dredging along the Mekong Delta has caused so much erosion that whole villages&#39; worth of homes have been swept downstream.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;“Where once there were riverbanks, today there are sheer drops into the water,” Conway writes. Such is the hunger for sand that, in many parts of the globe, an illicit trade has sprung up. In India, so-called sand mafias are rumored to pay off cops and politicians. According to the South Asia Network on Dams, Rivers and People, a Delhi-based advocacy group, at least a dozen civilians and two government officials were killed by sand mafias between December, 2020, and March, 2022. (This was down from twenty-three civilians, five journalists and activists, and eleven government officials killed during the two years prior.)&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;A lot of sand also goes into building buildings, not to mention dams, bridges, overpasses, and roadways. Sand and gravel are the major ingredients in concrete, some seven hundred billion tons of which now slather the earth. Often, concrete is reinforced with rebar, which is made with iron, the third of Conway&#39;s six materials. (The material I&#39;ve skipped here is salt, which, Conway says, is essential to just about every chemical process that&#39;s ever been invented.)&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Worldwide, nearly three billion tons of iron ore are extracted each year. Australia is currently the leading source, and its biggest mines are in the Pilbara, a region in the country&#39;s dry, dusty northwest. Iron from the Pilbara is mined by blasting the landscape apart and then carting away the pieces, using, as Conway puts it, “church-sized diggers.” Just the other day, several people died in the Pilbara when a truck carrying ammonium nitrate, an explosive used in the blasts, collided with another vehicle.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Conway devotes a hefty chunk of his discussion of iron to the story of the rock shelters in Juukan Gorge. These were sacred to two of the Pilbara&#39;s Aboriginal peoples, the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and the Pinikura, and contained artifacts that were some forty thousand years old. After assuring the communities that “all reasonable endeavors” would be made to minimize the impact of its operations in the area, the mining company Rio Tinto blew the rock shelters up. (The company has since apologized for what happened.)&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Perhaps what makes the destruction of the Juukan caves most disturbing is that we are all, one way or another, complicit,” Conway writes. Most of Australia&#39;s iron ore is shipped off to China, where it&#39;s converted into steel and used to construct the factories and machinery that churn out the phones, consoles, chargers, T-shirts, running shoes, housewares, and assorted tchotchkes the rest of the world buys.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Like many books in its genre—about how &lt;em>;x&lt;/em>; number of &lt;em>;y&lt;/em>; items explain &lt;em>;z&lt;/em>;—“Material World” has trouble sticking to its chosen integer. One of Conway&#39;s six raw materials is oil, but into this category he also squishes natural gas. Both are obviously fossil fuels, but, as Conway himself notes, they have distinctive properties that make them essential in different ways. Oil powers the transportation sector—cars, trucks, airplanes, and supertankers—and its by-products go into plastics, which show up in just about every consumer product you can name, from air mattresses to zippers. Natural gas, meanwhile, is primarily used to generate heat and electricity. It&#39;s also a key ingredient for synthesizing nitrogen fertilizer, without which, it is estimated, half the world&#39;s eight billion people would starve.&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot;

Despite a lot of talk about cutting back on fossil fuels, the world, he points out, is consuming just as much oil and gas as ever before (and very nearly as much coal). But, if Conway is concerned about our continuing reliance on fossil fuels, he&#39;s also concerned about what it will take to replace them. Two of the alternatives are solar and wind. Conway calculates that building enough wind turbines to shutter a hundred-megawatt natural-gas plant would take fifty thousand tons of concrete and thirty thousand tons of iron. Meanwhile, a transportation sector that runs on electricity will require a whole lot more of his fourth material, copper. A recent report from S. &amp;amp; P. Global predicted that, worldwide, copper consumption will double over the next twelve years and that “there is a looming mismatch” between the available supply and the growing “copper demand resulting from the energy transition.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Conway visits the Chuquicamata copper mine, in northern Chile—Chuqui, for short—which is believed to be the largest open-pit mine on the globe. When a blast goes off at the bottom of the pit, more than half a mile down, the noise, he says, is “shattering.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Industrial mining operations began at the site a century ago. In the intervening decades, most of the best-quality ore there, and indeed around the globe, has been churned through. “Even as people demanded more copper the earth became considerably less willing to give it up,” Conway writes. In 1900, fifty tons of rock yielded a ton of copper; to obtain that ton today, some eight hundred tons of rock must be processed.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Next to the Chuquicamata mine sits a town of the same name, which was abandoned in the early two-thousands, as waste rock began tumbling into people&#39;s gardens and residents fell ill. (The citizens of the town took to calling it &lt;em>;Chuqui qui mata&lt;/em>;, or “Chuqui which kills.”) By now, the waste has piled up high enough to consume a quarter of the vacant houses and a seven-story hospital.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Lithium—the last of Conway&#39;s materials—is equally essential to electrification. A typical electric-car battery contains nearly twenty pounds of the metal, which, in the era of climate change, has been dubbed “white gold.” Like many strategic resources—see, for example, high-purity quartz—lithium is unevenly distributed. More than three-quarters of the known resources lie in just four countries: Chile, Argentina, Bolivia, and Australia. Competition over lithium supplies is one of the many sources of tension between the US and China. Conway fears a replay of the nineteenth century, “when European countries colonised their way through much of the world, seeking rubber here, copper there.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The best option he sees for the future lies in what he calls “unmanufacturing.” Iron, copper, and lithium, in contrast to oil, can be recycled. Faced with climate change on the one hand and the material demands of new energy infrastructure on the other, perhaps humanity will finally figure out how to reuse the gazillions of tons of resources it&#39;s already dug up. Conway doesn&#39;t believe this will happen anytime soon—“We are still a long, long way from that promised land,” he cautions—but it is at least theoretically possible.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Chip Colwell, too, argues that it&#39;s time to rethink our ties to the material world. But Colwell is an archeologist, and, as such, he takes a longer view. In “So Much Stuff: How Humans Discovered Tools, Invented Meaning, and Made More of Everything” (Chicago), he seeks to explain how &lt;em>;Homo sapiens&lt;/em>; went from knapping chert to ordering granite countertops. What happened, he asks, “that led our species from having nothing to needing everything?”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Colwell, a former curator at the Denver Museum of Nature &amp;amp; Science, divides humanity&#39;s association with “stuff” into three periods. At the start of the first (and by far the longest), our hominin ancestors realized that some of the objects that were lying around—rocks, primarily—could be fashioned into implements. By two and a half million years ago, hominins—it&#39;s uncertain which species they belonged to—had mastered what&#39;s known as “secondary tool use”; they could take a stone and bash it against a different kind of stone to produce a blade with one sharp edge. This method of tool production continued, pretty much unchanged, for a million years or so, until some other group of hominins—probably &lt;em>;Homo erectus&lt;/em>;—made a breakthrough: they figured out how to make stone tools with &lt;em>;two&lt;/em>; sharp edges. Meanwhile, the story goes, humans began to evolve in concert with their technologies. Their hand axes allowed them to chop up other animals (and also, presumably, plants); this, in turn, allowed them to devote less effort to digestion and put more toward cogitation. The result was a feedback loop.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;kni319&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;“Bigger and smarter brains led to the ability to create better tools, which in turn provided more energy for bigger and smarter brains,” Colwell writes. Eventually, early humans became so dependent on their tools that they couldn&#39;t do without them.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The next period, in Colwell&#39;s telling, begins with the invention of what might, broadly speaking, be called art. This happened perhaps as early as half a million years ago, when a &lt;em>;Homo erectus&lt;/em>; living in what&#39;s now Indonesia made some scratches on a mussel shell. By thirty thousand years ago, &lt;em>;Homo sapiens&lt;/em>; living in what&#39;s now Italy were grinding ochre to paint figures on stone. The advent of art marks the point, Conway writes, at which things were no longer valued only for their utility—“when objects began to do more than just serve our biological needs.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;During periods one and two, accumulating stuff was tough. In the days before agriculture, humans were constantly on the move and could possess only as much as they could carry. Once they began farming and settling down, around ten thousand years ago, whole new classes of objects were created—wheels, plows, sickles. The new objects, along with the food surpluses they helped produce, gave rise to new forms of human relations. Societies became stratified, and their most powerful members began to express their status by accumulating objects of value. Still, everything had to be made by hand, and the vast majority of people remained, by today&#39;s standards, dirt poor.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Then came the Industrial Revolution, which ushered in period three. People figured out how to reliably turn iron into steel and sand into concrete. They invented steam engines, followed by steam turbines. Each innovation begat more innovation, and the feedback loop was, in a manner of speaking, electrified. To manufacture demand, marketers capitalized on the equation of stuff with status. In the Global North, at least, scarcity gave way to superabundance. Colwell quotes an estimate—perhaps reliable, perhaps not—that the average US household possesses three hundred thousand things. (Some of these things, admittedly, are paper clips.) Americans now have so many belongings, he notes, that they routinely pay to keep piles of them in storage.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;While writing his book, Colwell decides to try to step off the consumerist treadmill. Together with his wife and nine-year-old daughter, he embarks on what he calls a “slow-buy year.” Each member of the family agrees to purchase no more than five items over the course of twelve months, besides “necessities”—a category that includes food and school supplies. Before the halfway mark, Colwell and his family are already starting to chafe against their self-imposed limits. Then they purchase a new house. The idea of slow buying gets tossed out with the moving boxes.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“So Much Stuff” and “Material World” each make strong points; taken together, the books are even more compelling—and alarming. Consumption patterns in the Global North—and South, increasingly—simply cannot be sustained. Everyone who&#39;s read the news lately, or just ventured outside into this summer&#39;s smoke-filled, record-breaking heat, knows this. But that knowledge doesn&#39;t seem to change much. Conway explains this failure as a function of modernity. The industrialized world was built out of mountains of sand, iron, and copper, and it cannot operate without vast quantities of these or other materials. Colwell traces the problem back even further. Our special talent as a species is our ability to refashion raw materials—first rocks into tools, then, eventually, quartz into integrated circuits. We are, he suggests, &lt;em>;Homo stuffensis&lt;/em>;, a creature “defined and made by our things.” We should change our ways—we &lt;em>;must&lt;/em>; change our ways—but this long history is against us. ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 23 Oct 2023 20:06:01 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“My Name Is Barbra,” Excerpted]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/10/30/my-name-is-barbra-excerpted]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-23T10:00:00.000Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653011c4e129bd34403a2f44/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/231030_r43241.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;article >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attribute-verso-pattern=&quot;article-body&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;ArticlePageChunks&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;blockquote >;&lt;div >;&lt;p>;With her long-awaited memoir, Barbra Streisand offers a funny and frank look at her career, six decades in.

But at the end of the day? These are precisely the things that these same people love about me. Bill and Hillary adored it when I gave them a tour of the barn and I made Hillary try on my sequinny black see-through Scaasi pants suit from the &#39;69 Oscars: NSFW Hillary. Hillary &lt;em>;beyond&lt;/em>; e-mails. I mean, if you don&#39;t assert your will and your consummate design sense, who are you really? Sure, people have called me &#39;mouthy&#39; or &#39;pushy&#39; or a million things that they&#39;d never say about a man, but you know what? The world needs to know what the rest of the world is thinking. People who need people, etc. And in my experience people &lt;em>;want&lt;/em>; to be told if their jeans make their ass look fat. Sure, they&#39;ll smart at first, but later that night, as they&#39;re falling asleep? They&#39;re smiling.为什么？ Because they&#39;re thinking, Barbra cares about my silhouette. So, sometimes you need to speak out. Sometimes you need to look at the person next to you at the dinner party of life and—on realizing that he is a liar and a bully and a misogynist and a tax cheat who supports capital punishment—whisper in his ear, &#39;Donald, honey. Less is more.&#39; ”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;PAGE 945 —&lt;/strong>; Barbra recounts vacation with Madeleine Albright rife with handbag repair, disappointment.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;PAGE 963 —&lt;/strong>;
