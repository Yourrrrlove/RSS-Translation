data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;小时候，拉里·麦克默特里 (Larry McMurtry) 骑着“臭猫”(Polecat)，这是一匹设得兰群岛小马，性格凶恶，习惯拖拽他穿过豆科灌木丛。这个家庭牧场位于得克萨斯州中北部一个坚硬、干燥、基本没有特色的角落，坐落在一个被称为“白痴岭”的高地上。麦克默特里的三个兄弟姐妹似乎更好地适应了他们的环境——他的一个姐妹被任命为牛仔竞技女王；他的兄弟当过一段时间的牛仔，但最大的拉里害怕灌木丛和家禽。他的父亲杰夫·麦克（Jeff Mac）饲养着数百头牛，他通过它们的标记逐一认识它们。拉里的视力很差，他很难发现地平线上的牛群。当他的牛仔叔叔们年轻的时候，他们坐在谷仓的屋顶上，看着最后一批牛群开始向北长途跋涉。麦克默特里躺在牧场房屋的屋顶下，听着高速公路的嗡嗡声，十八轮汽车驶向沃斯堡、达拉斯或更远的地方——任何更大、更远的地方。许多年后，出生于伦敦的 Simon &amp;amp;舒斯特编辑迈克尔·科达 (Michael Korda) 是一位牛仔竞技爱好者，第一次与麦克默特里会面时，他戴着斯泰森毡帽，打着波洛领带。他很惊讶，也许还有点失望，发现这位年轻作家穿着“像一名研究生”，穿着休闲裤和运动外套。 “他也不像我一样对马有热情，”科达回忆道。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;迷人的西部与更加严峻、严峻的现实之间的不匹配是麦克默特里在数十本小说、非小说类书籍和剧本中的伟大主题这本书是他在 2021 年 84 岁因充血性心力衰竭去世前撰写或共同撰写的。特雷西·多赫蒂（Tracy Daugherty）是关于约瑟夫·海勒（Joseph Heller）、琼·迪迪安（Joan Didion）和唐纳德·巴塞尔姆（Donald Barthelme）的广受好评的书籍的作者，在《拉里·麦克默特里：一生》（Larry McMurtry: A Life）一书中，麦克默特里成为了一个永远矛盾的人物，最终成为了尽管麦克默特里在华盛顿特区和图森生活了几十年，并写了以洛杉矶和拉斯维加斯为背景的书籍，但他始终意识到自己是德克萨斯人作家。这是一种从外部和内部强加的身份；麦克默特里的某些部分始终停留在白痴岭上，眺望着地平线。三十出头的时候，他写了几本小说，发表了一篇文章，谴责德克萨斯州的文学严重落后。十多年后，他写了另一份更为严厉的评估，声称“德克萨斯州没有产生任何重要的作家或重要的书籍。”但即使麦克默特里的否认也以一种有趣的方式重申了德克萨斯沙文主义。 （“有人必须问：内华达州最近为文学做了什么？谁是阿拉斯加的丁尼生？”巴塞尔姆在《德克萨斯月刊》上写道，对麦克默特里后来的文章进行了嘲讽的回应。“我们在至少和罗德岛州一样，我们正在把怀俄明州逼到绝境。”）麦克默特里相信，凭借畅销的赶牛史诗《孤独的鸽子》，麦克默特里在 1986 年为他赢得了普利策奖。从始至终都对西方进行批评。”相反，它使西部片作为一种流派重新焕发活力。多尔蒂引用了已故得克萨斯大学奥斯汀分校英语教授唐·格雷厄姆的话：“《教父》也应该消除暴民的神话，但我们看到它后都想成为黑帮，对吧？” ?”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;GenericCallout&quot;>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;external-link-embed--inline&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;a aria-label=&quot;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;最佳书籍我们本周阅读&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;” data-event-click=&quot;{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/best-books-2023&quot;}&quot;

>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;麦克默特里的小说很好地转化为电影，场景的扫荡有助于消除故事的愤世嫉俗。他的第一部小说《骑士，路过》后来变成了《Hud》，由冷酷无情、闷闷不乐的保罗·纽曼主演。根据多尔蒂的说法，《最后一场电影》精装本刚印刷就卖出了 900 份，但彼得·博格丹诺维奇 1971 年的电影立即引起轰动，赢得了两项奥斯卡奖。 （强奸小母牛的场景没有出现在电影中。）麦克默特里的家乡已经对他保持警惕，丑闻缠身的《最后一场电影秀》的拍摄并没有提高他在当地的声誉。 （博格丹诺维奇与妻子兼合作者波莉·普拉特的婚姻在他与二十岁的电影明星西比尔·谢泼德在片场发生恋情后破裂。）《阿切尔县新闻》刊登了一封愤怒的信关于“我们强加给这个国家年轻人的道德和态度的进一步退化和腐化”；根据多尔蒂的说法，麦克默特里对此类袭击感到愤怒，他的回应是向他的同胞发起挑战，要求他们就该镇的真实本质进行公开辩论。大约在那个时候，他认为德克萨斯州和德克萨斯州写作的未来是城市的，他继续写了一套以研究生为主角的小说，有趣但参差不齐的书，从闹剧到悲情。麦克默特里特别擅长捕捉休斯顿的魅力——热气腾腾、潮湿、暴力、有趣。&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;当多尔蒂告诉艺术评论家戴夫·希基他正在写一本关于麦克默特里的书时，希基回答说：“了解拉里，这将是一本真正的情景书。”麦克默特里是一位狂热的公路旅行爱好者，他像收集书籍一样收集朋友，多尔蒂的传记中充满了有趣的客串：麦克默特里接待了凯西的巴士，里面满是昏昏欲睡的快乐恶作剧者，与苏珊·桑塔格一起吃鱼子酱，与黛安·基顿一起去跳蚤市场购物，并出席罗纳德·里根为查尔斯王子和戴安娜王妃举办的国宴。但这些轶事，其中许多取自麦克默特里自己写的关于他的生活的文章，可能会让人感觉像是一个盾牌。在整部传记中，对麦克默特里的更深层次的认识仍然难以捉摸。他给人的印象是一个很难深入了解的人。 （在作家乔治·格肖（George Getschow）编辑的《空页的牧场：拉里·麦克默特里的生活和遗产的作家们》中，接近和接触麦克默特里的困难是一个反复出现的主题。）&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;麦克默特里他经常因其创作女性角色的技巧而受到称赞，这似乎可以归结为一个简单的事实：他发现女性很有趣，而不仅仅是她们与男性的关系。在麦克默特里的书中，那些没有得到自己想要的东西的人物往往拥有最丰富的内心。他笔下的女性角色不太能够强迫环境符合她们的自我，她们往往能更清晰地看待世界。在《母女情深》中，男人要么平淡无奇，要么滑稽可笑。小说更感兴趣的是一群女性之间的关系：艾玛·霍顿，一位有着未实现的文学抱负的年轻母亲；她的朋友帕齐；她令人烦恼、魅力十足的母亲奥罗拉；还有奥罗拉（Aurora）受骗的管家罗西（Rosie）。艾玛生命垂危时，奥罗拉和帕西围着她的病床讨论她孩子们的未来。艾玛的丈夫弗莱普“也在那里”，但“他不相关。”&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot;

data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;尽管麦克默特里对这些角色有着明显的感情，但他们的追求却普遍存在一种酸涩的感觉。在小说的第一个主要场景中，剧组人员在夜间袭击格兰德河，进入墨西哥，偷走一群马匹，以便踏上向北的旅程。 “显然，如果你过河去做这件事，它就不再是犯罪，而是变成了游戏，”一名十几岁的学徒了解到；经验丰富的人会认为抢劫是理所当然的。这一最初的犯罪行为与贯穿整部小说的更可耻、更严重的盗窃行为相呼应：白人定居者侵占大平原并试图消灭其土著居民。小说中充斥着这些行为的后果：一小群饥饿的美洲原住民为了食物而宰杀马匹；一位留着肮脏胡须的老人推着一辆装满水牛骨头的独轮车穿过高原。从地面上看，赶牛是令人兴奋的，但从更远的距离看，它是毁灭性的。小说中的浪漫愤世嫉俗者麦克雷时不时地揭露所有情节英雄主义的目的：“这就是我们所做的，你知道。给现代印第安人穿短裙，这样他们就不会打扰银行家了。”麦克默特里深知养牛业扩张所造成的生态破坏，也深知养牛业自身也埋下了崩溃的种子。过度放牧导致牧场退化，豆科灌木和杂酚油灌木丛挤占了原生草丛。 “孤独的鸽子”事件发生后仅仅几代人，麦克默特里的父亲卷入了一场无休止、徒劳的战争，目的是从他的牧场上根除豆科灌木。 “我们杀死了正确的动物——水牛，却引入了错误的动物——湿地牛。但它并没有奏效。”麦克默特里在 2010 年说道。&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;《孤独的鸽子》是一本非常矛盾的书，但令麦克默特里懊恼的是，它并不总是得到这样的认可。该剧于 1989 年改编成广受欢迎的迷你剧，由罗伯特·杜瓦尔和汤米·李·琼斯饰演麦克雷和考尔，进一步确立了前流浪者队的感伤英雄形象。麦克默特里开始将他最受欢迎的书与《乱世佳人》进行比较。他的意思并不是恭维。尽管如此，他还是继续写了续集和前传，创造了一个扩展的宇宙，总体上来说，比原作更死记硬背，也不那么复杂。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;尽管他对《孤独的鸽子》有着复杂的感情，麦克默特里很感激这本书和其他项目给他带来的回报。 “电影钱就是我喜欢花的那种虚幻的钱，”他曾经写信给他的经纪人。在公路旅行中，他开着租来的凯迪拉克汽车，通过联邦快递将脏衣服寄回家；他成为曼哈顿市中心鱼子酱店 Petrossian 的常客，以至于餐厅在他最喜欢的餐桌上安装了一块刻有他名字的黄铜牌匾。但他最大的嗜好就是书籍。随着全国各地的独立书店关闭，麦克默特里买下了他们的股票并将其转移到阿彻城，在那里他正忙着将市中心的建筑物改造成书店。麦克默特里写道：“在阿切尔城留下大约一百万人，对于该地区乃至西部来说都是我所能想到的最好的遗产。”这个小镇在经历了一次重大的石油危机后，终于准备好拥抱它任性的儿子了。前往阿彻城的游客现在可以入住孤独鸽子旅馆 (Lonesome Dove Inn)，并前往乳品皇后 (Dairy Queen) 的麦克默特里 (McMurtry) 小神社表达敬意。当桑塔格来拜访时，她告诉麦克默特里，他似乎生活在自己的主题公园里。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;多尔蒂书的最后三分之一读起来很黯淡。麦克默特里于 1991 年心脏病发作，四重搭桥手术让他感觉“很大程度上是死后的”，用他的话来说，这种情况他似乎从未完全康复。在此期间，他最亲密的合作伙伴是图森律师助理戴安娜·奥萨纳 (Diana Ossana)。多尔蒂始终无法解释他们关系的本质——她是他的女朋友、他的朋友、他的写作伙伴、他的经理，还是这四者的某种组合？无论他们的动态如何，奥萨纳都是重要的支持来源。在手术后最糟糕的时期，也就是麦克默特里患有抑郁症的时期，他和她住在一起。有一段时间，他仍然把写作当作农活，每周 7 天早上第一件事就是处理这些事情，从不间断。但1993年《拉雷多的街道》出版后，他就停了下来。奥萨娜最终把他哄回打字机前，很快她就开始编辑，有时甚至重写他的作品。 2011年，经过六周的求爱后，麦克默特里与肯的遗孀费耶·凯西结婚。这对夫妇和奥萨纳住在一起，这种安排显然很适合每个人。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;2006 年，麦克默特里和奥萨纳因改编安妮·普鲁克斯的《断背山》而获得金球奖最佳剧本奖；麦克默特里在获奖感言中感谢了他的打字机。在奥斯卡颁奖典礼上，他穿着蓝色牛仔裤和靴子，感谢“世界上所有的书商”。但阿彻城从未成为他所希望的文学目的地，他的书店 Booked Up 也陷入了财务困境。 2012年，麦克默特里拍卖了数十万本书。 “这是他的梦想，将阿切尔城变成一座图书小镇，”麦克默特里的朋友格绍当时说道。 “现在这是梦想的终结。没有办法解决这个问题。”麦克默特里毕竟遵循了家族传统，将自己投身于一个垂死的行业，并在这个过程中心碎。他去世后，德克萨斯州立法机构通过了一项纪念他的决议；两年后，一位州代表表示，学校“可能需要禁止《孤独的鸽子》”，因为它过于露骨。&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>; &lt;p>;麦克默特里看起来像是来自另一个时代的人物。他在文学经济中长大，这使得他的职业生涯得以缓慢发展。在《孤独的鸽子》取得突破性成功之前，他用一贯的轻描淡写的方式将自己描述为“中产阶级作家”和“小区域小说家”。 （一位朋友曾将这句话印在他的一件 T 恤上。）他写到的德克萨斯州以白人为主，有着农业根源，并且专注于其拓荒者的过去。麦克默特里时而反抗、时而拥抱的那种对国家有着如此重大影响的版本，现在已经不再那么重要了——德克萨斯州还有很多其他的故事可以讲述。 （要了解这部欢乐的十九世纪史诗的另一种方式，请尝试卡门·布洛萨（Carmen Boullosa）的《德克萨斯：大盗窃》。）&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;去年，&lt;em>;阿切尔县新闻&lt;/em>;报道称，Booked Up 被另一位得克萨斯州名人收购：奇普·盖恩斯 (Chip Gaines)，他是《Fixer Upper》的联合主演，在电视剧中衣着邋遢，这档家居装修节目因传播“农舍时尚”美学而受到赞誉（或指责）。盖恩斯小时候在阿彻城度过了夏天，他说他和妻子浏览了麦克默特里的藏书，并着眼于精美的装订，挑选了一些书籍在他们今年在韦科开设的一家新酒店中展示。落下;其他人的命运尚不清楚，但这对夫妇表示，他们计划将大部分捐赠回阿彻城。盖恩斯告诉我，他对麦克默特里晚年回到德克萨斯州小镇的经历很认同。 “他选择回到自己的根源，回到简单的起点，”他说。 “我只是希望我能让他感到骄傲。” ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;80bl2j&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;

Giroux)&lt;/em>;. This metafictional historical novel centers on the recollections of an eighteenth-century French botanist, whose voyage to Senegal is irrevocably altered by his fascination with a young woman who has escaped from a slave ship. His account—gleaned from notebooks discovered by his daughter—begins as a travelogue and then transforms into a record of the escapee&#39;s ordeal, which she recounts to the botanist in the course of one long night: a mesmerizing tale of capture, getaway, and revenge. Diop&#39;s novel, which culminates in a terrifying sequence of events, is a testament to fiction&#39;s ability to uncover our self-deceptions, leaving them “as if exposed to the African sun at its zenith.”&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;I&amp;#x27;ma Fan by Sheena Patel.&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64ff7aa16f174aef5e392efc/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/230925_r42984web.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64ff7aa16f174aef5e392efc/master/w_120,c_limit/230925_r42984web.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64ff7aa16f174aef5e392efc/master/w_240,c_limit/230925_r42984web.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64ff7aa16f174aef5e392efc/master/w_320,c_limit/230925_r42984web.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64ff7aa16f174aef5e392efc/master/w_640,c_limit/230925_r42984web.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64ff7aa16f174aef5e392efc/master/w_960,c_limit/230925_r42984web.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64ff7aa16f174aef5e392efc/master/w_1280,c_limit/230925_r42984web.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64ff7aa16f174aef5e392efc/master/w_1600,c_limit/230925_r42984web.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;p >;&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Im-Fan-Novel-Sheena-Patel/dp/1644452456&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Im-Fan-Novel-Sheena-Patel/dp/1644452456&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Im-Fan-Novel-Sheena-Patel/dp/1644452456&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;&lt;strong>;I&#39;m a Fan&lt;/strong>;&lt;/a>;&lt;em>;, by Sheena Patel (Graywolf)&lt;/em>;. The corrosive logic of one-sided relationships is the subject of this dryly funny polemical novel, told from the perspective of a young woman obsessed with her married lover and his ex-girlfriend. The narrator provokes the lover in various ways, in the hope that he&#39;ll end his other love affairs, despite her being aware of her delusion. Surveilling the ex-girlfriend on Instagram, the narrator reacts to the woman&#39;s expensive purchases, which she broadcasts to a sizable following, with a mixture of loathing and desire. This woman “lives with real life art that I can&#39;t afford and wouldn&#39;t know how to get,” she thinks, “and I put posters up with Blu Tack like I&#39;m still fifteen years old.

In this triple biography, the dynamics of Renaissance Europe are illustrated through the lives and the politically motivated marriages of Catherine de&#39; Medici, Elisabeth de Valois, and Mary, Queen of Scots. Catherine, who married into the French royal family, leveraged her maternal qualities to win the right to govern on behalf of her young sons. Her daughter Elisabeth married Philip II of Spain to seal an unsteady peace between their two countries. Mary&#39;s strongest loyalty was to her French relatives—leading her to underestimate a dissatisfied Scottish nobility. In an era of empire-hungry monarchs and religious violence, these women, while fulfilling their obligations as wives and mothers, forged diplomatic connections through family ties.&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;Anansi&amp;#x27;s Gold by Yepoka Yeebo.&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64ff7a8cfbe5b1290e51cef0/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/230925_r42986web.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64ff7a8cfbe5b1290e51cef0/master/w_120,c_limit/230925_r42986web.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64ff7a8cfbe5b1290e51cef0/master/w_240,c_limit/230925_r42986web.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64ff7a8cfbe5b1290e51cef0/master/w_320,c_limit/230925_r42986web.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64ff7a8cfbe5b1290e51cef0/master/w_640,c_limit/230925_r42986web.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64ff7a8cfbe5b1290e51cef0/master/w_960,c_limit/230925_r42986web.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64ff7a8cfbe5b1290e51cef0/master/w_1280,c_limit/230925_r42986web.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64ff7a8cfbe5b1290e51cef0/master/w_1600,c_limit/230925_r42986web.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;p >;&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Anansis-Gold-Outfoxed-Washington-Swindled/dp/1635574730&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Anansis-Gold-Outfoxed-Washington-Swindled/dp/1635574730&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Anansis-Gold-Outfoxed-Washington-Swindled/dp/1635574730&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Anansi&#39;s Gold&lt;/strong>;&lt;/a>;&lt;em>;, by Yepoka Yeebo (Bloomsbury)&lt;/em>;. For two decades, beginning in the late nineteen-sixties, a Ghanaian man named John Ackah Blay-Miezah carried out an astonishingly successful scam by pretending to have inherited billions of dollars from Kwame Nkrumah, Ghana&#39;s first President. Though the inheritance was a fiction, propped up by forged documents and opportunistic coöperators looking to capitalize on political instability, Blay-Miezah swindled his marks out of millions by convincing them that he needed money to access the fund, and used his newfound wealth to become one of the country&#39;s most powerful people. Yeebo, a journalist, skillfully interweaves archival material, FBI records, and interviews to recount the saga of the con man&#39;s career, and to reflect on how lies can be leveraged in the creation of national histories.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;yxf0pk&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 18 Sep 2023 19:06:01 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Jeremy O.

Harris was living in a two-story apartment in London. He had travelled there for a production of his play “Daddy,” about a young Black artist who has fallen under the thrall of an older white man. “Daddy” had débuted, Off Broadway, a year before, and was set to open at the Almeida Theatre at the end of March, 2020; it would have been Harris&#39;s first professional opening overseas. But the show didn&#39;t open, and Harris stayed stranded in London for weeks, then, eventually, for months.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Sad about the play and scared about the world, he passed the first few weeks not writing—although many deadlines, constant companions in his life, hovered at the peripheries of his mind. Since high school, Harris has used the late night and earliest morning as a time to work and party and talk about art with friends; now he binged anime and listened to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/03/23/fiona-apples-art-of-radical-sensitivity&quot;>;Fiona Apple&lt;/a>; and started reading Audre Lorde&#39;s “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Sister-Outsider-Speeches-Crossing-Feminist/dp/1580911862/&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Sister-Outsider-Speeches-Crossing-Feminist/dp/1580911862/&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Sister-Outsider-Speeches-Crossing-Feminist/dp/1580911862/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;Sister Outsider&lt;/a>;,” which he&#39;d always meant to get to. As the weeks wore on, he tired of his vampirism. “I decided that I wanted to see the sun more often,” he said one April morning, as streams of light made bright rectangles on the apartment walls. Waking up at normal hours meant dealing with pedestrian annoyances. He&#39;d begun ordering coffee from a nearby café, and twice in a row, although he ordered it black, it was delivered with milk. “It&#39;s, like, everyone&#39;s watching &#39;The Plot Against America,&#39; ” he said, referring to the HBO miniseries based on the novel by Philip Roth, “and this feels very much like &#39;The Plot Against Jeremy.&#39; ”&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Harris is very tall and very thin, and handles his body with improvised precision, formality within informality, like a dancer on an off day at the mall. A gesture begun in his shoulder always ends at the tips of his fingers. When he gropes for thoughts between sentences, he makes shapes in the air with his hands. He has clear cedar skin and a pert, wide mouth. His eyes are sedate and low-lidded when he&#39;s in a neutral mood, but they open wide when he tells a story or expresses an urgent (often dissenting) opinion. Stories sometimes incite him to stand up and pantomime crucial passages of action. His first dream, before writing, was to act.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;When the third coffee came, finally correct, he sat on a couch by a window and lit a cigarette. Lots of people he knew were smoking again, he said, despite the worldwide march of a deadly respiratory disease: “Our lungs could fail us at any moment, and we&#39;re just, like, you know, fuck it.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Coffee and an American Spirit, white light through the window—his instinct about waking with the sun had been borne out. The apartment was pleasant in the daytime. On one wall was a large abstract painting in russets and burgundies and bright lipstick shades. Upstairs was a bedroom that he shared with his newish boyfriend, Arvand Khosravi, a film and television executive. At the top of the staircase was a glass door leading out to a shallow ledge on the roof, where Harris often went to film TikTok videos—mostly poppy, fast-paced riffs on scenes from classic plays—which he had been posting almost daily. In one, titled “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://twitter.com/jeremyoharris/status/1246604978346754049&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://twitter.com/jeremyoharris/status/1246604978346754049&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jeremyoharris/status/1246604978346754049&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;Titus Andronicus Act V&lt;/a>;,” he lip-synchs dialogue from the TV show “Catfish,” in four different costumes; it&#39;s nine seconds long.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Harris did the TikToks for fun; they were, for weeks, his sole avenue of creative expression. But they were also, not so subtly, a dig at the profession through which he had gained his recent fame. Rooted in the history and the canonical repertoire of theatre, but yoked dramaturgically to hyper-current rhythms and attitudes and styles, the TikToks showed that Harris could do what the big arts institutions couldn&#39;t—keep up. While they floundered, he figured, the show would go on from his phone. He had changed the bio on his frequently updated Twitter account to a kind of epitaph for the theatre: “I spent my 20s devoted to a craft in a coma.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Stages everywhere were dark; theatre companies and nonprofits were scrambling. In both their public statements and their private conversations with playwrights, they projected blithe optimism, as though their operations would be up and running by summer&#39;s end.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Like, no, guys!” Harris said, describing his frustration. “We have to reinvent this or re-create this, or else it&#39;s going to be even more detrimental to artists in six months, when you guys have wasted your resources trying to go the normal way.” “Daddy” was still in British limbo, and he had another play, “A Boy&#39;s Company Presents: &#39;Tell Me If I&#39;m Hurting You&#39; ”—his version of a Jacobean revenge drama, based on a particularly bad breakup—scheduled to début in May, at Playwrights Horizons, in New York. Nobody would officially admit—or, perhaps, allow themselves to believe—that the upcoming seasons wouldn&#39;t happen, but Harris was already mourning the new play, just as he was mourning “Daddy.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;His ire notwithstanding, thinking and talking about the failures of his industry seemed to energize him—almost to soothe him—and his online complaints soon came to echo a wider mood. As the initial shock of the pandemic gave way to a reëvaluation of racial and other societal arrangements, Harris became a kind of spokesman for the long-standing and suddenly stark unrest felt by his fellow-artists. It was a moment well suited to Harris&#39;s natural, if somewhat paradoxical, penchant for institutional critique. A happy disrupter of genteel silences, he has nonetheless, however rockily, charted a professional and personal path through some of the entertainment world&#39;s most staid establishment outposts: the Yale School of Drama; Gucci, for which he does modelling; various Hollywood-adjacent neighborhoods in Los Angeles; and now, most visibly, the Great White Way. The previous fall, “Slave Play,” the first of Harris&#39;s works to be staged in New York, had transferred to the Golden Theatre, on Broadway, after an extended run at the venerable New York Theatre Workshop, downtown.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Slave Play” tells the story of three interracial couples undergoing “antebellum sexual-performance therapy,” in order, presumably, to mend the edges of their relationships, which have been frayed by race. In the first act, before the audience is in on the premise, the couples—dressed in nineteenth-century garb, as masters and slaves—engage in various kinky sexual scenarios calibrated to set off trip wires in race- and sex-sensitive American minds. The second act, in which the actual therapy takes place, is straightforwardly funny. The third is a surreal, largely horrifying duet between one of the couples, a Black woman and her white husband. Over and over, “Slave Play” calls into question the true parameters of sexual consent and tries to wring current-day catharsis from the brutal history of master-slave rape.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;In some corners—including this magazine, in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/12/24/black-and-white-in-slave-play-and-to-kill-a-mockingbird&quot;>;review&lt;/a>; that I wrote—Harris was lauded for the wild rigor of his vision and the originality of his voice. And the play&#39;s overwhelming success was the precondition for many of the luxuries he now enjoyed: the London flat, the European engagement, a two-year development deal that he had recently signed with HBO. At the same time, “Slave Play” was a kind of troll job, perversely aimed at unsettling and possibly enraging the various constituencies—racial, sexual, institutional, professional—to which he belonged. Harris must have known that the play would have this effect; he seemed to revel in the discursive mess it left in its wake. Even before the pandemic, he had earned a reputation as an enfant terrible, the kind of designation that is made possible only by way of proximity. You&#39;ve got to be fairly close to the big house to even consider throwing stones.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Something I&#39;ve always wondered is when I&#39;m going to develop the affected-Black-intellectual voice,” Harris said that summer, still stuck in London. He was reflecting on some of his favorite writers and artists of an older generation, and the way that their talk was often as effortfully stylized as their work. He&#39;d been thinking about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1994/11/07/andre-leon-talley-vogue-the-only-one&quot;>;André Leon Talley&lt;/a>;, the fashion writer and editor whose high diction and baroque syntax became hallmarks of his style—and seemed, moreover, like a way of asserting his belonging in a largely white milieu. Talley, who died last year, was, like Harris, a tall, queer, highly verbal Black man from the South. His web of complex, sometimes tortured relationships with white co-workers, bosses, and benefactors was consonant with—and had possibly even influenced—the dynamics depicted in “Slave Play.” Harris is unabashed in his study of other artists&#39; personas. “I&#39;m so interested in personal style, and personal relationships, and class—if not class ascension, then class association,” he said. “Just the lilt of certain people.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Talk of that voice—I knew what Harris meant without having to ask—got me thinking, perhaps slightly defensively, of my own.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“You have it a little bit,” he said, confirming a fear I&#39;d spoken aloud.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;We agreed, though, that the voice of our rough age cohort—Harris is thirty-four—was particular. The sort of Black Millennial writer whom Harris had in mind was not someone who would deploy the suavely concatenated sentences of James Baldwin. Rather, this hypothetical thirtysomething, as eager to showcase pop-cultural with-it-ness and egalitarian humility as to display hard-won verbal acuity, would use locutions peppered with pointed “like”s and “um”s, plus a bit of vocal fry, for subtler tones of falsely self-deprecating color: a Valley Girl with an advanced degree.&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot;

” Harris said. “But also, partially, I think unconsciously, I did it so that my intellect wouldn&#39;t be intimidating to everyone around me. This is a part of my plays that was also a part of growing up—I&#39;ve always had to figure out how to translate stuff from the academy into language that my mom could understand, without asking her to take time from her life to read, like, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/10/26/how-saidiya-hartman-retells-the-history-of-black-life&quot;>;Saidiya Hartman&lt;/a>;.” A dramaturgical note for “Slave Play” quoted both Hartman and Hortense Spillers, another Black feminist scholar, but the play itself takes Rihanna as its primary muse. “I had to bring my learning into a different space of understanding, which is why it&#39;s so much more fun for me to write plays that are based in theory than it is for me to go, &#39;And then Jonathan wanted to get a divorce from Becca,&#39; or things like that.”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;tv2w5&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Harris speaks in a restless tenor, alternating locomotive bursts with considered pauses; his voice is bright and brackish and warm. He talks about movies and plays and clothes and people&#39;s bodies constantly. His sentences often start with “Have you seen?” or “Have you read?” Unless he already knows, from your work—almost all his friends are artists or public people of one kind or another—that you&#39;ve seen it or read it, and what you think about it, and is prepared to gently argue. He says “yes,” encouragingly but without much emphasis, when he hears something he agrees with, never “yeah.” Two words he uses a lot are “ostensibly” and “psychotic.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Harris was raised in Martinsville, Virginia, among people who made their livings with their bodies, many of them in factories. His way with words marked him as different. His mother, Veronica Farrish, refused to let family members use baby talk with him. He taught himself to read, and was soon the kind of prematurely unimpressed kid who finds it easier to make friends with teachers than with classmates. When Harris was eight, one of his favorite pastimes, he said, was trading theories with his mother about what had happened to JonBenét Ramsey, the six-year-old pageant contestant whose murder was a tabloid bonanza in the late nineties: “I was, like, &#39;OK, I looked at this document.&#39; ”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;His early interest in true crime briefly convinced him that he wanted to be a lawyer—that standby aspiration for the precociously talkative. But after landing a part in his middle school&#39;s production of “My Fair Lady,” he realized that he possibly just wanted to play a lawyer on TV. Around the same time, Harris was realizing that he was gay, or at least different—this difference was the rare condition for which he didn&#39;t yet have the words. Another discomfort was the unsettled nature of his home life. He didn&#39;t meet his biological father until he was nine or ten; his mother married another man when Harris was four, got divorced when Harris was in middle school, then embarked on another short-lived marriage, to a military man stationed at what was then Fort Bragg, in North Carolina. Harris moved there with his mother and enrolled in a new school. “I was so upset,” he said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Harris spent much of his childhood in private Christian schools, helped by financial aid. As a result, he became comfortable with the discombobulating tension of being a poor Black kid in a largely rich, white environment. Then, in tenth grade, he got a scholarship to Carlisle, a prep school in Martinsville. In the hallways, there were pictures of each graduating class. As Harris recalls, Black faces didn&#39;t begin showing up in the photographs until the mid-nineties, when the school started a basketball team. “Everybody wanted me to play basketball,” Harris said. “And I was, like, No. I hated that so much. I was, like, I will &lt;em>;never&lt;/em>; do that.” Instead, he took up swimming and dance. He kept up his practice of befriending teachers. “Candace—and Paula, who taught in the middle school,” he recalled, “I would have coffee with them after school, and they were my friends.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;By this point, Harris was determined to be an actor. He got parts in plays and musicals and directed a production of “The Laramie Project,” Moisés Kaufman&#39;s documentary play about the aftermath of the killing of Matthew Shepard, a gay student at the University of Wyoming. His kaffeeklatsch pal Candace Owen-Williams, who taught drama at Carlisle, let him turn an empty trailer behind the school into a black-box theatre, where he and some other friends put on experimental shows. His senior thesis was a one-man production of Wallace Shawn&#39;s “The Fever.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;For college, Harris went to the acting conservatory at DePaul University, in Chicago. The program&#39;s structure was brutal: after freshman year, only half of the students were allowed to continue with the acting cohort; the others were cut, and had to pursue different fields of study if they wished to remain at the school. Harris found the first year—essentially a protracted audition—disorienting. “A lot of my teachers said that my intellect was going to get in the way of me being a real actor,” he said. “I always sort of directed or rewrote the circumstances of the scene to fit the emotional states that I wanted to play around in, to make it more interesting to me.” Part of the problem, he said, was that so many of the roles and scenes were geared toward white actors. But he internalized the message that “if you&#39;re smart, you have to hide it,” he said. “I still stand by all my choices,” he added, “because, in some ways, I made cooler theatre then than I&#39;m making now.” For an exercise in “auto-drama,” he put twenty lamps of different shapes and sizes onstage. The lamps were the only source of light in the show; each one represented a story connected to a father figure. Then, as now, Harris was seeking, and sometimes finding, masked ways to describe the absence left by his actual father. In the glow of each light, he told a version of a memory.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;After the first semester, Harris chopped his long hair, nervous about how his teachers might perceive him. When the program made its cuts, the following summer, he called his friend and classmate Erika J. Simpson. Neither had got in. They were quiet for a long time.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;1uw3i&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;It was June—a beautiful month in Chicago but, for Harris, who had just turned nineteen, the grim beginning of an uncertain period. He called one of his teachers to ask why he&#39;d been dismissed; she said that he wouldn&#39;t be “castable” as an actor until his thirties, and rattled off a list of reasons that felt, to him, like “gay-coded shit.” He told me, “There were four Black boys in our year, and the two that got cut were the ones that felt the femme-est.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;He started collecting issues of the Chicago &lt;em>;Reader&lt;/em>;, a free alternative newspaper whose pages he trawled for acting notices. At an audition, he broke down, crying and trembling. He explained himself to the producers—some of them had gone to DePaul; they understood—and they told him that he could step out of the room for a moment, compose himself, and try again. Instead, he just left.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Eventually, Harris got modest parts at small venues in the city. He became an English major, and briefly imagined writing poems. He was interested in the work of Ai, a mixed-race woman from Arizona whose poor upbringing reminded Harris of his own. In her poems, Ai, who died in 2010, inhabited the voices of tough, sly, vulnerable working-class people asserting their dignity—or, at least, some measure of hip and artful defiance—against the backdrop of an indifferent and often hostile world. “You say you want this story / in my own words, / but you won&#39;t tell it my way,” her poem “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/browse?volume=151&amp;amp;issue=1&amp;amp;page=14&quot;>;Interview with a Policeman&lt;/a>;,” from 1987, begins. Her work would come to influence Harris&#39;s understanding of the possibilities of monologue.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;But Harris didn&#39;t remain an English major, or a DePaul student, for long. He dropped out and, a year later, moved to Los Angeles.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;By the end of the first pandemic summer, Harris and Khosravi had left the London apartment and were driving around Europe in a car full of their stuff. Khosravi had felt too cooped up in their flat, but Harris refused to move back to the US “This is why it&#39;s hell to date me,” he said. The pair were in Naples, Italy, in mid-October, when Tony nominations were announced, on a live stream. It was evening in Italy; Harris got on FaceTime with his mom, nieces, and nephew, so that he could watch it with them. He had to hop off about four nominations in because the stream that his mom was watching was ahead of his, and she kept screaming before he&#39;d seen the news. In the end, “Slave Play” got twelve nominations, more than any non-musical production had before.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Slave Play” was a genuinely difficult piece of work, a deliberate provocation. At one post-show Q. &amp;amp; A., a white woman yelled at Harris that she didn&#39;t “want to hear that white people are the fucking problem all the time.” Some Black audience members insisted that the play was oriented toward a “white gaze,” and was a cynical exploitation of the intertwined subjects of slavery and rape. Both currents of backlash were more or less predictable. The dozen nominations seemed to indicate that Harris could start a food fight in the theatre world&#39;s living room and still be invited to sit at its dinner table.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“It emboldens me to be more forthright with my opinions and how I feel about the world, because, if I gave a fuck about what institutions were actually saying to me, the &#39;Slave Play&#39; that got twelve nominations would not be the &#39;Slave Play&#39; that got twelve nominations,” he said. “It would have been a dumber play, and a less complex play, and a less Jeremy play.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;But this institutional approbation also posed a kind of creative challenge. “I think the thing that I&#39;m trying to get over—and I&#39;ve been working on this a lot over the last year—is other people&#39;s excitement about me,” Harris said. “It&#39;s easier for me to write when I&#39;m writing from a place of, like, &#39;These people don&#39;t believe in me enough.&#39; When I have something to prove, I can write so much better.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Since his time in LA, if not before, Harris had defined himself in opposition to those around him—or, at least, those with power. He had initially made his way not in professional settings but in the more free-flowing dynamic of late-night scenes. In Chicago, he had begun to understand his personality and physical bearing as a kind of talent. He was funny and gay and six feet five; people gravitated toward him and wanted him to come to their parties. He got a job at a trendy women&#39;s boutique in Wicker Park, &lt;em >;AKIRA&lt;/em>;, where he helped clients find going-out outfits. Often, those clients would invite him to clubs. Soon, he was a night-life fixture.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“I am the No. 1 person who will tell you that I hate gay bars, because I don&#39;t have as much power there,” he told me. “Black and skinny and charismatic—it gives you much more power in a straight bar than in a gay bar. I wasn&#39;t threatening to the straight men there. And I was also a weird honeypot for the night clubs because all these fun girls would want to stick around longer to hang out, and buy more bottles, too.” Night life is a churning economy, only partially visible to most people, a system behind a veil.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;He carved out a similar space in LA, getting a day job where cool and connected people were sure to buy clothes—Barneys this time—and becoming a regular presence in the clubs. He made friends, some of them in show business, and asked around about how to find his way in the industry. Among the people he talked to at parties were important future collaborators: the writer and director Sam Levinson, the filmmaker Janicza Bravo. “I think that my verbal abilities helped me navigate the space,” he said. “And also my style. I have good-to-decent style.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Harris got small acting gigs: he starred in a short film directed by the actor James Franco; he appeared, very briefly, in the Terrence Malick movie “Song to Song.” But he hated the idea of being at the mercy of gatekeepers, who, like his teachers at DePaul, might label him uncastable. When Lena Dunham&#39;s show “Girls” débuted on HBO, in the spring of 2012, he saw her as a kindred spirit, and a role model. Watching “Girls,” he thought, “This is so perfect, and also I think I could do it.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Like Dunham—and like Ilana Glazer and Abbi Jacobson, of “Broad City,” another inspiration—Harris and Erika Simpson, his friend from DePaul, created a Web series, “#NightStrife,” and uploaded it to YouTube. “It&#39;s two twentysomethings trying to get famous,” Simpson says, by way of explanation, in the first episode. They made only a few episodes, which were not widely seen, though a tongue-in-cheek series promo of sorts, titled “Black Girl Takes a Shit,” has been watched nearly eighty thousand times.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Harris became jaded about Hollywood; he stopped acting, and stopped referring to himself as an actor. He started to call himself a playwright, though he had yet to write a play. He cast about for ideas, unsuccessfully, until he went on a date with a porn star, whose stories yielded the material for Harris&#39;s first play, “Xander Xyst, Dragon: 1,” a kind of fantasia on the theme of online celebrity. With the play—which featured music by Isabella Summers, of Florence and the Machine, another friend he&#39;d made in LA—he won a spot at the Samuel French Off-Off Broadway Short Play Festival, in 2014. There, he met a group of young playwrights who are now his contemporaries: Will Arbery, Martyna Majok, Leah Nanako Winkler, Eleanor Burgess.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Afterward, he applied for a fellowship at the MacDowell artists&#39; residency—and, when he was wait-listed, he called the administration every day until someone told him yes. At MacDowell, he met the playwright Amy Herzog, who encouraged him to apply to Yale. He&#39;d already finished a draft of “Daddy,” and he submitted it to the drama school&#39;s admissions board, along with a heartfelt essay. “The clearest memory I have of my childhood is elegantly staged,” he wrote. “Delicately, it moves in a realm between the cinematic and the theatrical: lights up on an open screen door leading into a wide hallway, my mother (early 30s) downstage paces from one off stage room to another whispering vitriol into a cordless phone, somewhere further off stage we can hear the sounds of a young girl crying, and upstage in profile I sit (12) back to back with a large suitcase looking out of the open door periodically. 。 。 。 Suddenly the crying stops replaced by The Pointer Sisters and my mother is standing with my sister in her arms in the middle of the hall tears, a smile and snot dancing on her face, &#39;He&#39;s not coming. Come on baby, let&#39;s dance,&#39; she said. So we did.”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;xd9qbr&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Harris has come to see “Daddy” as a play about furthering his career by seeking the opportunity and resources that an institution like Yale can provide. “Going to Yale was me deciding to marry a white guy on a hill and in order to have the time and space to make my work,” he &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.ssense.com/en-us/editorial/culture/oh-jeremy&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.ssense.com/en-us/editorial/culture/oh-jeremy&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.ssense.com/en-us/editorial/culture/oh-jeremy&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;told&lt;/a>; one interviewer. Elsewhere, he has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vice.com/en/article/8qgm9g/decolonizing-my-desire&quot;>;described&lt;/a>; the play as an attempt “to parse the ways I was cradled, coddled and collected by white institutions and how I&#39;ve collected and used them in turn.” He once wrote that he went to Yale with eyes open, “believing that I could take more from this place than they would take from me.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In early 2021, the demands of Harris&#39;s still fairly young renown finally called him back to New York. &lt;em>;Town &amp;amp; Country&lt;/em>; had planned a multi-page spread to showcase his newly designed home office, which had been furnished by the chic design firm Green River Project. On a cold, pewter-sky morning in January, Harris sat in a studio belonging to Aaron Aujla, one of the firm&#39;s owners, at a nondescript former warehouse in Brooklyn, getting ready to have his picture taken. Someone tended to his hair, always a foremost point of interest in the looks he puts together for magazine covers and red carpets. There were small, feathery tufts of it strewn about the studio&#39;s bright-green floor.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“I think I want just a mustache,” Harris said. He&#39;d come to the shoot with several pictures of the Japanese writer Yukio Mishima at the ready on his phone. He pulled one up: Mishima in his office, behind a desk and flanked by books, pouting fiercely at the camera, his dark brows writhing. The writer&#39;s louche, vaguely sexual gaze did have something of the solitary mustache about it.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Harris has often, with a bit of a wink—and in spite of Mishima&#39;s reactionary politics—called Mishima his favorite writer. A few months earlier, he had tweeted, “Ok guys so to combat seasonal / pandemic depression and the sense that my life moves at a pace my body can&#39;t keep up with I&#39;ve decided to do a workout every day a la my favorite writer YUKIO MISHIMA. Who combatted depression and dread w/ workouts and a failed coup d&#39;état.” In 1970, Mishima and several members of a militia that he had formed attempted to take over a Japanese military base, in the hope of inspiring an overthrow of the country&#39;s constitution. After a fiery speech, Mishima—obsessed with physical beauty and warlike vigor—killed himself with a sword. “Do I hate fascists?” Harris wrote, in another tweet. “Yes. Do I love Mishima?是的。 I&#39;m a Gemini. Two truths can be held.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Aujla puttered in and out of the studio, smiling and not saying much. He is married to the fashion designer Emily Bode, known for her knit menswear; she and Aujla are neighbors of Harris&#39;s, in Chinatown, and have become his friends. She&#39;d brought a rack of clothes for Harris to choose from. Once in a while, he&#39;d disappear behind a curtain and come out wearing a pair of fluid trousers or a lacy top or a burgundy suit, evocative of Mishima. (He selected the suit as one of his outfits.) When something tickled him, he let his voice rise to a high, smoky giggle. “That&#39;s cunt,” he sometimes said. Between costume changes, he chatted about recent movies, especially a new coming-of-age indie film that everybody seemed to like but that he couldn&#39;t bring himself to watch.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;“Arvand hates me for this,” Harris said, referring to his Hollywood-exec boyfriend, “but I can&#39;t stand this kind of shit.” He went on, “It&#39;s always that same thing: &#39;Here I am, marginalized little kid—Black, immigrant, gay, whatever—and here&#39;s the &lt;em>;wide&lt;/em>;, &lt;em>;wide world&lt;/em>;.&#39; ” By now he was acting out the archetype, hunched into a pantomime of childish wonder, his eyes big with fear, his hands clasped. “And now there&#39;s big trouble”—he cowered in terror—“and inner strife”—he anxiously trembled—“but soon”—now he let a smile spread across his face—“I overcome.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“I knew exactly what that movie was gonna be the moment it started, and I was, like, No, thank you,” he said. Bode, who has a slim face framed by twin curtains of dark hair and speaks in a soft, helpful voice, like that of an expensive therapist, laughed until her face turned pink.&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;a data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a27607&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a27607&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;Jeremy O.

Like Harris, Leifheit went to Yale for graduate school and is the entrepreneurial, self-sustaining center of his own career. He edits the magazine &lt;em>;MATTE&lt;/em>;, makes photo books, and teaches workshops across the country. They met because of Harris&#39;s insistence, in New Haven, on spreading his presence far beyond the confines of the drama school: he was known to drop in on photography critique sessions and to speak up, offering references and suggestions. “A lot of people thought he was part of the photo program,” John Pilson, one of the program&#39;s longest-serving faculty members, said. “By the end, we all expected to see him every week.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Harris had arrived at Yale in 2016. Several of his classmates were far beyond him professionally: they&#39;d had shows produced, they had agents. He was eager to catch up, but soon found himself at odds with the institution. The curriculum was too conservative for his taste; he felt that his instructors were dismissive of his interest in more experimental work. He started taking classes in Black studies and poetry. He also began work on “Slave Play,” which he says “poured out” of him almost whole. He was assigned a faculty adviser, the acclaimed playwright and director &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/11/03/real-gone-girl&quot;>;Young Jean Lee&lt;/a>;, who would help shepherd a student production.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Lee is a longtime downtown experimentalist, and many of her work&#39;s subjects—race, class, the body—are also crucial to Harris; he was excited to work with her. But she had extensive notes on “Slave Play,” which Harris mostly declined to take. She objected strongly to the final act, set in the bedroom of a Black woman named Kaneisha and her white British husband, Jim. Their therapy has been a disaster, largely because of Jim&#39;s refusal to go along with goofily degrading role-play. Kaneisha calls Jim a “virus,” and connects their relationship to the brutalities of the past; Jim gets back into character, as a slave master, and gives Kaneisha the abasement she seems to have been asking for.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;This sequence, the most hotly debated part of “Slave Play,” stayed in the show, even after the move to Broadway. When Lee saw it in a dress rehearsal, she was horrified; later, she told Harris that it took her more than an hour to calm down enough to give him feedback. The two then exchanged lengthy text messages. “I hope that no one has ever spoken that violently to you about work that so deeply intersects with your being, and if they have I&#39;m sorry,” Harris wrote. Lee replied, “If you&#39;re that irresponsible about putting a rape of a female body onstage, I&#39;m going to call you out on it in no uncertain terms. To turn it around and call me the violent one is a classic move that has been done to me many times, and I&#39;ve never fallen for it, and I&#39;m not falling for it now.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Their dispute culminated in a formal complaint process, presided over by Tarell Alvin McCraney, who leads the drama school&#39;s playwriting program. Harris used transcripts from those meetings in “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.nplusonemag.com/issue-38/fiction-drama/yell-a-documentary-of-my-time-here/&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.nplusonemag.com/issue-38/fiction-drama/yell-a-documentary-of-my-time-here/&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nplusonemag.com/issue-38/fiction-drama/yell-a-documentary-of-my-time-here/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;Yell: A &#39;Documentary&#39; of My Time Here&lt;/a>;,” his senior thesis play. I went to see it, in New Haven, in 2019. By then, Harris had already staged “Slave Play” and “Daddy” Off Broadway, but he still had something to prove to his teachers. The most constant formal structure in “Yell” is repeated acts of onstage defecation. Fake shit was everywhere at Yale&#39;s Iseman Theatre that day.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;p49xk&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Harris has said that “Yell” was inspired by the radical 1967 essay “The Student as Nigger,” by Jerry Farber, which compares the relationship between American students and their professors to that of slaves and masters. In June, 2020, at the height of the George Floyd protests, Harris shared “Yell” online, and wrote a long accompanying Twitter &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://twitter.com/jeremyoharris/status/1270447515570233350&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://twitter.com/jeremyoharris/status/1270447515570233350&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jeremyoharris/status/1270447515570233350&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;thread&lt;/a>; in which he posted screenshots of his text exchange with Lee, who declined to comment for this story. “EVERY DAY THEY TREATED ME LIKE A NIGGA THAT NEEDED TO BE TAMED AND IT MADE ME FEEL CRAZY,” he wrote.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In September, 2021, Harris sat in a chair in a bathroom at a ritzy hotel in New York. The Tonys were finally being awarded that night, and he&#39;d booked a suite nearby, where he could get ready. Also in the bathroom were his hairdresser, Latisha Chong, and a woman tending to his makeup and nails. He sat stock-still, never wincing as Chong pulled through his Afro and started to braid. The three of them, mutually devoted to the task of flashy beauty, calmly chatted about people they knew in common.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Everybody who knows him thinks he&#39;s gay,” Harris said. “But, I&#39;m telling you, he&#39;s straight.” Both women disbelievingly harrumphed. “Bone straight,” he said.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;The bathroom was a center of calm in the otherwise hectic suite. Harris occasionally got up to take a Polaroid of the room—an editor at &lt;em>;Vogue&lt;/em>; had commissioned him to keep a photo diary. Also milling around were two camerapeople shooting footage for a “Slave Play” documentary that Harris had promised to deliver to HBO. They swanned around the room, sometimes going out on the balcony to capture views of downtown and the West Side. Beyond and between the buildings, you could see the Hudson quietly snaking along.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Harris&#39;s assistant kept running out of the room, collecting bouquets of flowers and other gifts that were arriving in a steady stream. Harris had recently interviewed the young gay rapper Lil Nas X for a &lt;em>;GQ&lt;/em>; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gq.com/story/lil-nas-x-musician-of-the-year-2021&quot;>;profile&lt;/a>;. “Montero—he&#39;s brilliant,” he said, using the rapper&#39;s given name. “The interview felt kind of like a first date.” He asked his assistant to put on a song from Lil Nas X&#39;s new album, a catchy single called “Industry Baby.” “This one is gonna be huge,” Harris said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Friends continually appeared, at his invitation. His mother and niece were getting their makeup done in a neighboring room. Candace Owen-Williams, his old teacher, was there, too, in a sparkly gown. Harris pointed her out to each new arrival and repeated the story of how she made him feel less alone at school.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;This is how Harris relaxes—sitting somewhere near the center of a crowd that he&#39;s convened. Antwaun Sargent, an art critic and a gallerist with Gagosian, walked over to the ledge where Harris&#39;s gold accessories, custom-made for him by the haute-couture house Schiaparelli, sat gleaming. There were chunky rings and cufflinks, a necklace with a pendant made from a cast of Harris&#39;s ear, a “Phantom of the Opera”-style mask modelled after a swooping section of his face.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;As the sun began to set and the light in the room darkened, Harris asked everyone to leave so that he could ready himself for the show. That night, in a surprise to prognosticators, “Slave Play” was completely shut out—twelve nominations, nothing to bring home. The next day, the online edition of Page Six carried the headline “Jeremy O. Harris celebrates Tony snubs with two afterparties.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Early last year, Harris tweeted a casual swipe at the state of television. “I write tv for people who have an intellect for theatre since tv is hollow,” he wrote. “Bc the funny thing is the reason so many filmmakers and theatre makers were asked to make television is bc the medium hit a wall. That&#39;s why almost all the best tv, of late, has been made by exciting practitioners of other forms.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Stung TV writers and irritated critics noted that Harris now made much of his living from television, and not always in its most rarefied corners. In 2021, he&#39;d done a cameo, as himself, on the reboot of “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2008/03/10/advanced-placement&quot;>;Gossip Girl&lt;/a>;.” (The script called for a play within the show, which Harris wrote; later, he got it commissioned by the Public Theatre.) Then he was cast, as a fashion designer, in the second season of “Emily in Paris,” Darren Starr&#39;s critically maligned Netflix series about an American influencer who gets a job in France. The show&#39;s producers told Harris that they were looking for someone reminiscent of a young André Leon Talley.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Sharper observers of Harris&#39;s commentary noticed that he was playing a familiar role. “I support Jeremy O Harris being snotty about TV,” the &lt;em>;Times&lt;/em>; critic Jason Zinoman wrote. “Playwrights used to be like this all the time. It&#39;s a glorious tradition.” The path from New York theatre to a career in Hollywood—where the money and the weather are better, and the audiences are bigger—has been traversed by writers for almost a century. And Harris seemed to be giving television a dose of his usual medicine: let me in and I&#39;ll give you a piece of my mind.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;But on his winding path to playwriting, Harris had made the kinds of friends you would make if you were aiming for the screen all along. When Harris was still at Yale, Sam Levinson made him a consultant for his notoriously lurid HBO teen drama “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/on-television/the-addictive-chills-and-thrills-of-euphoria&quot;>;Euphoria&lt;/a>;.” (Harris is now a producer on the series.) Janicza Bravo got Harris hired as the co-writer for her movie “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-front-row/zola-reviewed-a-twitter-thread-takes-an-ingenious-and-audacious-cinematic-form&quot;>;Zola&lt;/a>;,” adapted from a riotous series of tweets.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;His steadiest Hollywood employment came in the form of the HBO deal that he signed in 2020. The following year, the network announced that he would adapt the novel “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Vanishing-Half-Novel-Brit-Bennett/dp/0525536965&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Vanishing-Half-Novel-Brit-Bennett/dp/0525536965&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Vanishing-Half-Novel-Brit-Bennett/dp/0525536965&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;The Vanishing Half&lt;/a>;,” by Brit Bennett, along with the playwright Aziza Barnes, a friend of his. The novel tells the story of twin sisters whose fates diverge: one dissolves into the American mainstream, passing as white; the other anchors herself in Black community. Harris and Barnes assembled a writers&#39; room to produce a pilot and a “show bible,” outlining the plot of the first season. They led the writers on a research trip to New Orleans, where much of “The Vanishing Half” is set. As the weeks passed, Harris was often airborne, travelling to fashion gigs, conducting interviews for magazines. When he signed the HBO deal, he&#39;d insisted that his contract contain an annual fund for supporting theatre, and he&#39;d used some of that money to create a fellowship for emerging writers. He was always &lt;em>;working&lt;/em>;. He just wasn&#39;t always writing.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Then, the following June, the Daily Beast &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thedailybeast.com/jeremy-o-harris-let-go-from-hbos-the-vanishing-half&quot;>;reported&lt;/a>; that Harris and Barnes were no longer working on the show. The article cited two sources who claimed that Harris “was let go after having trouble meeting script deadlines.” HBO insisted that he had not been fired. There had simply been creative differences, which were “part of the normal development process.” Harris, HBO added, “is a valued collaborator, and we currently have other projects in development with him.” (He is no longer on an exclusive deal with HBO but continues to work with the network.)&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I visited Harris, at his apartment, a couple of weeks later. It was a bright July day, hot in the sun but buoyed by a breeze. He answered the door wearing a long green terry-cloth robe, with dark polish on his fingernails. His young nephew had been wanting to paint his nails and was getting grief about it in his Southern milieu, Harris said, so he had painted his in solidarity. “Sometimes I think people don&#39;t want him to be a &#39;punk&#39; like Uncle Jeremy,” he said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The Daily Beast hadn&#39;t reported any details about Harris&#39;s approach to the “Vanishing Half” adaptation, but I had heard, from several friends, about a proposed scene in which a lot of feces is flung around. It sounded preposterous but not entirely unlikely. Harris, in his work, likes to explain drastic external action by way of uncomfortable, abject, and often lewd interior depths. His characters earn their brief glories after trudging through lots of shame; his people get splattered.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Harris seemed surprised that I&#39;d heard about the scene in such detail, but was happy to discuss it. He loved Bennett&#39;s book, but wanted to interpret it freely, even radically, something TV writers don&#39;t do enough, he said. One addition he and the writers envisioned was a surrealistic quasi-dream sequence that would send a character&#39;s consciousness “skipping like a stone across the waters of time,” as Harris put it in the show bible. The character would witness a “depraved ritual” meant to cleanse a small town of its communal sins, and the dark bacchanal would include “blackface masks, buffoonery and flying mud and feces.” It would end with “infidelities, thefts and dark family secrets ushered from the shadows into the light.”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;22nqj&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Harris was less annoyed by people gossiping about his work than by the suggestion, in the Daily Beast and elsewhere, that he wasn&#39;t a hard worker. “I&#39;m actually really insecure about that,” he said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;He was about to go abroad, and he wanted a new swimsuit for the summer trip; he&#39;d asked Emily Bode to design one for him. We walked to her small tailoring shop in Chinatown, where a board high up on a brownish wall announced the prices for alterations. Half-done garments hung on faceless mannequins.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;A tailor silently took Harris&#39;s measurements, then gave him the swimsuit that Bode had left for him to try on: a lime-green one-piece with thin tank-top straps and tight shorts. He had seemed sedate and almost tired in the apartment, but now his mood lifted. He retreated behind a curtain, then came out wearing the suit, hugging his thin body. It fit. He looked into a mirror and spread his arms. He was already smiling.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;One night last October, Harris went to the Brooklyn Academy of Music to see the renowned Belgian theatre director Ivo van Hove&#39;s adaptation of the novel “A Little Life,” by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/01/17/hanya-yanagiharas-audience-of-one&quot;>;Hanya Yanagihara&lt;/a>;. Harris is friendly with Yanagihara—he&#39;d spoken with her about acting in a possible TV adaptation of the book. He attended the play with an old roommate from his Yale days, Michael Breslin, who co-founded the theatre collective Fake Friends. Harris has co-produced two of the collective&#39;s shows: “Circle Jerk,” a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize for drama, and “This American Wife,” a harrowing parody of Bravo&#39;s “Real Housewives” franchise.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“A Little Life” centers on a group of friends in New York, one of whom, a saintly character named Jude, is repeatedly flayed by acts of unspeakable violence. Like “Slave Play,” the novel was dogged by accusations of sadism. After the show, Harris, who has cited the Marquis de Sade as a formative influence, chatted with his friends. They all agreed that some of the show&#39;s most excruciating scenes, which had provoked gasps in the audience, could have been, in keeping with the book, a bit more graphic.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Harris took a car home, stopping for a drink at a bar near his apartment. Writers—a species always overrunning those blocks, which have come to be called Dimes Square—spilled out of restaurants and sidewalk sheds. For a few minutes, cradling his drink, Harris argued amiably with a pop-music critic about the recently released movie “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-front-row/tar-reviewed-regressive-ideas-to-match-regressive-aesthetics&quot;>;Tár&lt;/a>;,” which Harris hated.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Back at his apartment, he ate and paced and talked—softly, because a friend, one in a rotating series of medium-term guests, was sleeping in the next room. Soon, Khosravi came home. Like Harris, he is tall and slender and demonstrative; subtle streaks of gray run through the ringlets of his hair. Unlike Harris, he seldom seems excited to argue. Before Khosravi, Harris had a boyfriend who broke up with him in part, Harris says, because of his sudden fame. “Arvand doesn&#39;t mind that I&#39;m a star,” he once told me.&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;a data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a24982&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a24982&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;“Take care out there today hon.

They were flying in the morning to a gala in Bentonville, Arkansas, at the Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art. Harris didn&#39;t seem stressed.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The next day, at the museum, as Harris wandered a room with paintings by Kehinde Wiley, Amy Sherald, and Kerry James Marshall, Khosravi surprised him by getting on one knee and proposing marriage. He&#39;d had a ring designed by a pair of jewellers who lived across the street from them in London and had become their friends. And he&#39;d asked the playwright &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/02/12/adrienne-kennedys-startling-body-of-work&quot;>;Adrienne Kennedy&lt;/a>;—a hero of Harris&#39;s, and now a frequent e-mail correspondent of his—to write a benediction, to be etched on the inside. It reads, “Happiness.是。大部头书。 Greatest Thing.” Harris said yes.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;A day later, he giddily recounted the proposal on Twitter, adding a pinch of social critique. “But someone, I guess I will?, needs to write about how cringe it is to be proposed to when you haven&#39;t been socialized to be waiting for it,” he wrote. “It&#39;s a really violent trap we set for both parties where you&#39;re asked to be in a play you know the script to and if you deviate from it 💔.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Harris&#39;s doomsaying in 2020—his sense that the gatekeepers were not doing enough to reimagine and thus preserve the world of theatre—has arguably been validated, in the worst way, in the three years since then. A wave of closures and layoffs has prompted a rash of op-eds about the future of the medium. Harris, as contrarian as ever, is not abandoning the theatre but, rather, becoming something of a gatekeeper himself: he has lately been, almost above all else, a facilitator of other people&#39;s work.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;He is currently the presiding playwright for the Yale Drama Series, a role that involves judging the program&#39;s annual prize. After he took the position, last year, he began conceiving a writers&#39; retreat for some of the prize&#39;s finalists—inspired, in part, by his experience at MacDowell. In March, he announced the inaugural Substratum fellows: four young playwrights who would spend a month at a medieval house, part of the hotel Monteverdi Tuscany, which, along with Gucci, would help cover the expenses.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;He was in Italy with the fellows when he got a text from the actress Rachel Brosnahan, who, along with Oscar Isaac, was starring in a revival of Lorraine Hansberry&#39;s 1964 play “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/03/13/sign-in-sidney-brusteins-window-theatre-review&quot;>;The Sign in Sidney Brustein&#39;s Window&lt;/a>;,” at &lt;em >;BAM&lt;/em>;. She hoped he&#39;d come see it. He said he was abroad, and asked if the play might be extended or transferred; she didn&#39;t think so. “I&#39;m going to get you to Broadway,” he replied. He phoned producer friends, and together they engineered a brief transfer to the James Earl Jones Theatre—another play set to open there had seen its financing collapse. The Hansberry revival wouldn&#39;t run long enough to turn a profit, but it would get a wider audience for a work by another of Harris&#39;s playwriting heroes. And the quick transfer suggested a different approach, perhaps, for Broadway: If space opens up, why not take a few chances?&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In August, Harris went to Great Barrington, Massachusetts, in the Berkshires, to spend two weeks acting in a movie directed by Pete Ohs, who edited the “Slave Play” documentary. Ohs makes largely improvised movies for twenty thousand dollars or less; the tiny budget meant that he could shoot without breaking the rules of the Writers Guild of America strike, which had begun in the spring and showed no signs of ending. The film was a country-house nightmare about contracting disease from deer ticks.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;The cast was staying at the house, which belonged to the actress Callie Hernandez, one of Ohs&#39;s collaborators. In the brightness of the afternoon, a wall of trees outside was variously green: dark pine, mild maple, vivid oak. Inside, James Cusati-Moyer, who was in “Slave Play”—his character, a gay man, refuses to describe himself as white—stood at the kitchen counter, mixing flaxseed, honey, psyllium husk, and cranberries in a steel bowl. He was making gluten-free bread, from a TikTok recipe. “You want a kind of cakey texture,” he said. “The woman in the video is incredibly annoying, but the bread is great.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The movie would begin shooting that night. Harris changed into a white linen caftan and went into town for groceries—he&#39;d volunteered to make dinner, for the second day in a row. He drives with a country boy&#39;s ease; he learned at fourteen, when his mother realized how impossible it would be for her to chauffeur him to all of his activities. He&#39;d already acclimated somewhat to the roads of Great Barrington, and to its local lore. “Birthplace of WEB DuBois,” he said. “They can&#39;t shut up about it—he&#39;s, like, the only Black guy they know.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Loping through the aisles at the grocery store, he picked up ears of corn with stringy husks and a pack of what he called “white-people aluminum foil,” packaged in a recyclable-looking brown paper box. He&#39;d begun writing a novel about a Black writer beset by deadlines and grief. Harris was very close with his mother&#39;s parents, who have both died in the past few years—his grandfather, Golden, died two weeks before “Slave Play” débuted on Broadway. “Writing isn&#39;t fun,” he said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;At lunch, in a small bakery across the street from a general store, he told me that his cash flow was slowing down as a result of the strike. “The other day, my niece asked me for a new phone, and I had to say no,” he said. “I told her, &#39;I&#39;m not trying to be mean—I&#39;m broke.&#39; ” He pays private-school tuition for her and his nephew; he bought a home, in Virginia, for his mom. He was worried about falling behind on payments.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;k3hwwg&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Back at the house, he enlisted his castmates as sous-chefs—chopping herbs, buttering corn—and began to cook. People were trying on clothes and critiquing the outfits. Would this work for the character? What else did it need? Cusati-Moyer was in a loose crop top. Harris loved it.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“I feel bloated from the bread,” Cusati-Moyer said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“You are,” Harris said, grinning.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“This is what he was like,” Cusati-Moyer told the others. “He builds you up and then he breaks you back down!”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Harris called his mom to ask her advice on the meal—pork chops, roasted corn, fried apples, all callbacks to his childhood. Should he melt the butter, put the apples in the cast iron, and &lt;em>;then&lt;/em>; pour the sugar in?&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“I don&#39;t know if you know this,” he told her, “but there&#39;s a white way to make this, where you don&#39;t just pour sugar.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Yeah, well, we make it the Black way,” his mom said. They talked about Harris&#39;s niece, and about the patterns his mom had begun to notice in her romantic life, and about literature. They sounded like siblings who take turns being in control.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;She said that she wanted to write a book about her life. “The best way to write is to read really good things,” Harris said. “You have to read this book by a French woman named &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/11/21/annie-ernaux-turns-memory-into-art&quot;>;Annie Ernaux&lt;/a>;. &#39;Happening.&#39; You&#39;ll really like it.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;He sat in the kitchen, with food in the oven and on the stove, steeling himself quietly for work later on, chatting with his mother. For a moment, his life seemed almost normal. ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>; &lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/ div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;div>;&lt;div>;&lt;div>;&lt;div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt; /div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 18 Sep 2023 19:06:01 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[How Thom Browne’s Gray Suit Conquered American Fashion]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/09/25/how-thom-brownes-gray-suit-conquered-american-fashion]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-18T10:00:00.000Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650367a2fd47431d5e50a6ab/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/230925_r43002.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;article >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attribute-verso-pattern=&quot;article-body&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;ArticlePageChunks&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Every new employee of the American fashion designer Thom Browne receives a “starter kit” of his brand&#39;s clothing worth some ten thousand dollars retail, including, among other items, two gray suits, five white oxford shirts, one gray wool tie, and one white pocket square. An eleven-page PDF lays out, through visual aids and bullet points, the rules for how to wear what Browne refers to as “uniform” (never “the uniform” or “a uniform”). Top buttons must remain undone. Shirts are not to be ironed. Neckties, a required accessory, should be tucked tightly into waistbands. Suit pants may be swapped out for a pleated skirt, regardless of one&#39;s gender; Browne, a proponent of androgynous dressing, has been putting men in skirts for more than a decade. Exceptions to the rules are doled out cautiously: the color navy is permitted Friday through Sunday but discouraged during the week; seersucker can be worn in the summer months, and white sneakers only on weekends.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;One afternoon in early July, I went to Avenue Montaigne, a luxury shopping promenade in Paris&#39;s Eighth Arrondissement, to visit Browne&#39;s French headquarters. In two days, Browne would, for the first time, present a runway show as part of Haute Couture Week. He was one of only a handful of American designers in the past fifty years to be invited to participate alongside such storied couture houses as Fendi, Chanel, and Schiaparelli. But the timing for a high-fashion pageant suddenly felt off. A few days earlier, a policeman had shot and killed an unarmed teen-ager of Algerian descent during a traffic stop in the Paris suburbs, sparking protests across the country. I had flown in on a red-eye expecting to find a city on edge. Yet on Avenue Montaigne the mood was serene. Pedestrians sauntered along a row of European flagship boutiques nestled in battlements of creamy limestone: Gucci, YSL, Prada, Louis Vuitton. At No. 30, Christian Dior occupied the same site where, more than seventy-five years ago, the designer unveiled his nipped-waist New Look silhouette. Browne&#39;s shop, at No. 17, is unmarked and open by appointment only, and when I saw the building, a blocky beige office tower that stood out from the elegant architecture like a bucktooth, I wondered if I was in the right place.&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;Thom Browne holding a ventriloquist&amp;#x27;s dummy.

One wore a suit paired with high-top lace-up brogues. Another was in seersucker shorts and a matching cinched waistcoat. The third had on a cropped cashmere vest over a sleeveless oxford shirt. The outfits were all variations on the archetypal Thom Browne ensemble: a “shrunken” gray suit with jacket sleeves that end above the wrists, lapels as thin and sharp as paring knives, and pant legs that are cut some three inches above the ankle, revealing what Browne likes to call “male cleavage.” (His preferred fabric is Super 120&#39;s wool twill in “medium gray,” a color that typically evokes the banal—pencil lead, gravel, wet cement.) The Thom Browne look has often been compared to Pee-wee Herman&#39;s archly nerdy costume or to Don Draper&#39;s office wear after a few rounds through the dryer, but it calls to my mind, too, some mischievous scamp out of a Roald Dahl book who is always conspiring to put a dead hamster in the headmistress&#39;s bed.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Browne, who is fifty-seven and launched his namesake ready-to-wear business twenty years ago, is hardly the first fashion designer to implement a dress code among employees—for decades, the Belgian designer Martin Margiela has required staff to wear long white coats, or &lt;em>;blouses blanches&lt;/em>;, at all times—nor is he the first to take a schematic approach to dressing his customers. Chanel&#39;s little black dress was, as &lt;em>;Vogue&lt;/em>; put it in 1926, a “uniform for all women of taste.” But, in an industry known for chasing novelty, Browne has built one of the most influential brands by iterating on a single idea. His deceptively humble goal is, as he regularly tells his staff, “to make the gray suit look interesting.” Once a menswear cult label, Thom Browne has in recent years become favored among celebrities who wish to signal that they&#39;re game for fashion risk-taking. In 2018—the same year the Italian textile juggernaut Zegna bought a majority stake in the brand, at a valuation of five hundred million dollars—LeBron James, a longtime fan, bought his Cleveland Cavaliers teammates matching Thom Browne suits to wear to playoff games. (The fashion critic Alexander Fury told me that Browne suits hold a special appeal among “big fucking straight men” who like the look of muscles bulging out of fine tailoring.) Browne has put the actor Oscar Isaac in a pleated skirt and the actress Christine Baranski in a corseted tuxedo. The members of boygenius, the queer-feminist supergroup, are currently channelling the early Beatles in custom Browne suits on their world tour. The musician Janelle Monáe, who identifies as nonbinary, attended this year&#39;s Met Gala in a Tim Burtonesque Thom Browne overcoat of black-and-white tweed that peeled off to reveal a giant sheer hoopskirt. Monáe told me, “In Thom&#39;s clothes I feel part of a species of people who are pushing culture forward.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;For the couture show, Browne had rented the Palais Garnier, the city&#39;s grand nineteenth-century opera house. His team had shipped the collection from New York in refrigerator boxes. On Avenue Montaigne, preparations were taking place in a temporary atelier two floors above Browne&#39;s permanent showroom. Fifty employees sat hunched over high tables covered in white cloth, furiously making final adjustments. Some were embellishing a blazer with hundreds of sequins no bigger than a freckle. Others worked on a long overcoat of dove-gray wool interlaced with rows of silver beads, mimicking the undulating texture of silk moiré. Across a hallway, in a makeshift photo studio and fitting room, a photographer was shooting a male model in a shale-colored “bell” gown. One of a dozen such looks in the collection, it had exaggerated mutton sleeves and a conical skirt; a three-piece suit was inlaid down the center of the garment, giving the impression of one outfit skin-grafted onto another. Every now and then, a muffled tinkling sounded from one corner, where Anna Scott, Browne&#39;s head of footwear, futzed with pairs of stilettos that featured brass bells on the heels.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;feature-large-callout&quot; >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;GroupCalloutWrapper&quot;>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;Every Thom Browne piece includes an accent of redwhiteandblue striped grosgrain as a nod to the ribbons on the medals...&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65039124ebce12b0b0432eed/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/230925_r43003_rd2.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65039124ebce12b0b0432eed/master/w_120,c_limit/230925_r43003_rd2.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65039124ebce12b0b0432eed/master/w_240,c_limit/230925_r43003_rd2.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65039124ebce12b0b0432eed/master/w_320,c_limit/230925_r43003_rd2.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65039124ebce12b0b0432eed/master/w_640,c_limit/230925_r43003_rd2.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65039124ebce12b0b0432eed/master/w_960,c_limit/230925_r43003_rd2.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65039124ebce12b0b0432eed/master/w_1280,c_limit/230925_r43003_rd2.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65039124ebce12b0b0432eed/master/w_1600,c_limit/230925_r43003_rd2.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;Every Thom Browne piece includes an accent of red-white-and-blue striped grosgrain, as a nod to the ribbons on the medals Browne won in his youth as a competitive swimmer.&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;A male ballet dancer wears a lavender sweater and skirt while balancing on the railing of a balcony.&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650368bc3731717dab8d71d2/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/230925_r43004.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650368bc3731717dab8d71d2/master/w_120,c_limit/230925_r43004.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650368bc3731717dab8d71d2/master/w_240,c_limit/230925_r43004.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650368bc3731717dab8d71d2/master/w_320,c_limit/230925_r43004.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650368bc3731717dab8d71d2/master/w_640,c_limit/230925_r43004.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650368bc3731717dab8d71d2/master/w_960,c_limit/230925_r43004.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650368bc3731717dab8d71d2/master/w_1280,c_limit/230925_r43004.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650368bc3731717dab8d71d2/master/w_1600,c_limit/230925_r43004.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;A look from Spring 2020.

I&#39;d worn shades of black and cream for my visit, but amid employees in uniform any color that wasn&#39;t gray seemed as obtrusive as flaming red. The British master milliner Stephen Jones, who makes headpieces for Browne&#39;s shows, noticed my baseball cap and asked, politely, if he might rid it of a smudge. Then he whisked it into another room to rub the brim down with a wet cloth.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Browne was standing in the middle of the fitting room, leaning against a marble table. He greeted me with a quick kiss on either cheek. Even in these surroundings, he stood out for the punctiliousness of his getup. He has a strong, square jaw and keeps his hair, now salt-and-pepper, in a tidy crewcut. He was wearing a tight sweater vest over his standard wrinkled oxford (“When everything is so well made, I think you need something that kind of throws it off a little bit so it&#39;s not so &lt;em>;precious&lt;/em>;,” he said of the wrinkles); on his muscular legs were snug wool shorts and a pair of Thom Browne knee socks. Browne&#39;s own approach to uniform is unvarying. A former swimmer, he runs eight miles a day; until a knee injury forced him to use a treadmill, he was known to jog around the Central Park reservoir in tailored shorts and a cashmere cardigan. Five years ago, he stopped wearing long pants altogether. He recalled that places like the Ritz in Paris and the Four Seasons in Milan used to give him a hard time for wearing shorts to dinner. “Now,” he said, “they always let me in.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Browne&#39;s runway presentations are known for their narrative sophistication, but his references, he told me, are often “more Bugs Bunny than Proust.” His settings are pulled from children&#39;s fables—an old-fashioned schoolhouse, an ice-skating rink, a pine forest filled with fake snow—often with a discomfiting twist. For his “Toy Story” collection, last year, he filled a room at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center with five hundred Steiff Teddy bears outfitted in his suits. A native of Allentown, Pennsylvania, Browne went to Catholic school until the seventh grade and served as an altar boy, and he has framed more than one collection around the theme of nuns and priests. For a show in 2012, he had his models emerge from coffins while a narrator told the audience that “they died for fashion.” Johnson Hartig, one of Browne&#39;s oldest friends and the founder of the fashion label Libertine, told me that although there is “something draconian and a little dystopian” about Browne&#39;s creative vision, “it&#39;s all done in a tongue-in-cheek, innocent kind of way.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;For the couture show, Browne had found inspiration in the opening lyrics of the song “Fade to Grey,” by the British New Wave band Visage: “One man on a lonely platform.” He described the show&#39;s protagonist, to be played by the Sudanese British supermodel Alek Wek, as “a girl who comes into a train station wearing a classic gray suit who is not so happy with her life.” The rest of the collection featured outfits representing various characters that the woman encounters on the railway platform, including luggage porters, gargoyles, a conductor, and a pair of high-fashion pigeons.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;One of the couture birds, played by a male model named Florian DesBiendras, wobbled in from the atelier in full costume, which included six-inch, heel-less cantilever shoes. Browne craned his neck. “God, you&#39;re so tall,” he said, giggling.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;For more than a decade, Browne has been in a relationship with Andrew Bolton, the head curator at the Metropolitan Museum&#39;s Costume Institute. When Browne was first developing the new collection, Bolton shared with him a time-honored rule of couture: garments should “look heavy and feel light.” The pigeon outfit consisted of a fitted turtleneck minidress made of a paillette fabric developed for Browne in Switzerland, and covered with hundreds of hand-tipped gray, green, and purple feathers. In a witty touch, a hand-felted skirt made to resemble a suit jacket was draped around the hips, with exaggerated shoulder pads that doubled as panniers.&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot;

Joining in, Browne put his hands behind his back and wiggled his fingers like tail feathers.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;mbq20g&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Later, Browne went over the show&#39;s soundtrack with his music supervisor. Along with the Visage song, the playlist included gloomy tracks from Björk and David Bowie and a pair of arias from the opera “Dido and Aeneas.” Browne likes to have his models walk slowly. Most fashion shows are under fifteen minutes; Browne&#39;s regularly go on for more than thirty. Critics sometimes complain about it, he said, “but I&#39;m, like, you know what? I spent so much on this. You&#39;re all gonna sit and enjoy it.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The music supervisor queued up the choo choo of a freight train, the clanging of an old-timey clock, and a chorus of pigeon coos. “Hey, I like to be cheesy sometimes,” Browne said. He had imagined sprinkling the stage at the Palais Garnier with handmade felt pigeon droppings—“They would have to be embroidered by Lesage,” Browne said, citing the legendary French needlework atelier—but had run out of time.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;It was &lt;em>;goûter&lt;/em>; hour in France. A publicist produced a spread that combined the glamorous and the mundane: a bottle of Dom Pérignon and a bag of plain potato chips. He poured the champagne into coupe glasses—Browne hates a flute—and the chips onto paper plates. Browne said that the idea for the combo had come from Marilyn Monroe&#39;s character in “The Seven Year Itch.” “Chips &lt;em>;always&lt;/em>; go with champagne,” he added, reaching for a plate.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Every Thom Browne piece includes a red-white-and-blue striped grosgrain ribbon as an accent, whether it&#39;s a tab hanging off the back of a collar or a ring encircling a shirt arm. It is meant as a throwback to the cheap ribbon necklaces on the sports medals that Browne won in his competitive-swimming days. The fourth of seven siblings from a tight-knit Irish-Italian family, Browne would wake up on school days as early as 4 &lt;em >;AM&lt;/em>;. to train. His younger sister Jeanmarie Wolfe recalled, “We all held each other accountable and we were all competitive, but we knew that Thom just had &lt;em>;it&lt;/em>;. We never worried about him. He always stayed the course.” (Today Wolfe, a lawyer in Allentown, wears head-to-toe Thom Browne to work nearly every day.) Browne became an all-American swimmer as a teen, and was recruited to Notre Dame&#39;s Division I team. “I grew up in a Speedo,” he recalled, when we met up in New York later in July, at Sant Ambroeus, an Italian café on Madison Avenue. “That regimen was always part of my day. I loved the organization of it, and the discipline.” Browne is still a creature of habit. Since he and Bolton moved to Sutton Place, on the far East Side, in 2021, he has gone to Sant Ambroeus each morning to pick up his to-go breakfast—a sugar croissant and an espresso. That day, he&#39;d agreed to dine in, at a red leather banquette. “This is new to me,” he said. His order remained the same.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Browne&#39;s father, James, a lawyer and accountant, worked at a financial-services firm and wore Brooks Brothers suits to the office. His mother, Bernice, who&#39;d met James in law school, stayed home with the kids and then, at fifty, passed the bar for a second time and went to work as a county solicitor. Browne thought he&#39;d follow a traditional corporate path. He graduated from college with a business degree and took a consulting job in New York City, but he hated it and quit in less than a year. Not long afterward, a friend, the British interior designer Paul Fortune, offered to let Browne stay in the guesthouse at his Los Angeles home. Browne took him up on the offer, and ended up living in LA for six years.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Fortune, who died in 2020, was known for his high-profile clientele—Sofia Coppola, Marc Jacobs, Aileen Getty—and for his patrician sense of style. Like Browne, he was a gay man who&#39;d gone to Catholic school. “He knew everybody,” Browne recalled. “And he had excellent taste. He was inspiring just to be around, to see how you could make your own life.” After two years, Browne moved into his own place, in Los Feliz. Many stories about Browne report that he spent his twenties as a “struggling actor,” but he laughed when I brought this up. He briefly studied with a drama coach and appeared in a few television ads. But he mostly supported himself as a production assistant and script reader. The one souvenir of Browne&#39;s short-lived show-business career, he says, is his British-seeming name. Because there was already a Tom Browne in the Screen Actors Guild, he started going by Thom.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Since his year in the corporate world, Browne had gravitated toward wearing suits—Brooks Brothers, like his dad. But in LA he began to develop a more distinctive personal style. He would scour vintage stores for classic men&#39;s pieces and have them altered at a local dry cleaner, raising the leg hems and truncating the sleeves. When asked about the inspiration for the look, Browne has cited memories of John F. Kennedy&#39;s slender suits. But in reality JFK often wore slouchy sack jackets and pants that broke over his shoelaces. The design “was this idea I had in my head, and I just had to get it out,” Browne said. He told me that he enjoyed the way his too-small suits “drove people crazy,” especially in laid-back LA He added, “I can&#39;t stand things that are very vanilla. I get bored by things that are just normal.”&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;A model poses in an elaborate blue gown while birds fly and perch around her.&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650368c2022245bfd87607b0/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/230925_r43009.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650368c2022245bfd87607b0/master/w_120,c_limit/230925_r43009.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650368c2022245bfd87607b0/master/w_240,c_limit/230925_r43009.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650368c2022245bfd87607b0/master/w_320,c_limit/230925_r43009.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650368c2022245bfd87607b0/master/w_640,c_limit/230925_r43009.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650368c2022245bfd87607b0/master/w_960,c_limit/230925_r43009.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650368c2022245bfd87607b0/master/w_1280,c_limit/230925_r43009.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650368c2022245bfd87607b0/master/w_1600,c_limit/230925_r43009.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;A “gargoyle” gown from Browne&#39;s couture collection features cascading layers of taffeta and satin.&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;p >;In 1997, he moved back to New York—“I had no money, and it was just scary,” he told me—and, through a friend, landed a job as a sales assistant at Giorgio Armani&#39;s wholesale showroom. Armani had revamped power suits in the eighties with loose, billowy silhouettes, and though the aesthetic wasn&#39;t to Browne&#39;s personal taste, he quickly became a top salesman. Around the same time, he befriended the designer Ralph Lauren&#39;s chief of staff and eventually met Lauren, who was looking for a new designer to develop menswear for his mid-level work-wear brand Club Monaco. Despite Browne&#39;s lack of training, Lauren hired him for the job. Browne tried to bring his own ideas to the brand—miniature cardigans, high-water pants—but “it wasn&#39;t right for them,” he recalled. “I couldn&#39;t give that stuff away. But I really loved it so much that I thought I should just be doing it myself.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Browne was not trained in sewing. To make suit prototypes for his own line, he needed to partner with an experienced tailor, but it was difficult to find one willing to use his bizarre specifications. After a stalled collaboration with a master tailor in Brooklyn, Browne connected with Rocco Ciccarelli, an old-school suit-maker in Queens, who agreed to make five sample suits (and went on to work as the head tailor for Browne until his retirement, in 2015). In 2001, at the age of thirty-five, Browne launched a made-to-measure business out of his one-bedroom apartment. He served as his own model, wearing the sample suits around town. He recalled that when he asked friends to purchase them “they were, like, &#39;Why would we want to buy something that doesn&#39;t even seem to fit &lt;em>;you&lt;/em>;?&#39; ”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Innovation in tailored menswear has historically taken place in what one critic described to me as “infinitesimal adjustments.” But by the turn of the millennium, with the rise in casual work wear, most men no longer had to buy a suit. The challenge was to make them &lt;em>;want&lt;/em>; to buy one, and designers were trying out increasingly daring ideas. Raf Simons, at his eponymous label, and then Hedi Slimane, at Dior Homme, produced sleek black suits that gave their wearers the look of louche indie rockers. Tom Ford, during his tenure at Gucci, introduced high-waisted velvet suits in sultry jewel tones. Browne&#39;s tapered design drew on codes of American conformity—the trope of the “man in the gray flannel suit”—but also quite literally undercut them. The result was something impish and a little bit kinky: all that male cleavage, out on display. Within the fashion world, Browne was initially considered an intriguing artist on the fringes. “It was &lt;em>;so&lt;/em>; small and &lt;em>;so&lt;/em>; custom and &lt;em>;so&lt;/em>; eccentric,” the veteran British fashion critic Tim Blanks recalled. “If somebody had told me this would be a half-a-billion-dollar business in twenty years, I would have laughed.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Browne gained an important ally when a friend introduced him to Miki Higasa, a brand strategist who&#39;d worked for Rei Kawakubo&#39;s avant-garde fashion house Comme des Garçons. Higasa had seen how a designer could make even the most challenging ideas legible to the public through repetition and persistence. She persuaded Browne to make a limited ready-to-wear collection in 2003, and soon afterward the operation moved into a small storefront in the meatpacking district. Higasa invited buyers to stop by, including Sarah Andelman, of the late trendsetting Paris boutique Colette, who placed an order for Browne&#39;s heavy oxford shirts and then, as she recalled, “had to keep reordering them.” A buyer from Bergdorf Goodman agreed to carry the collection. “They wanted to put it on the tailoring floor, and not on the third floor with the fashion,” Higasa recalled. “We said, &#39;This is not for the conventional guy.&#39; ”&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;a data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a27979-rd&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a27979-rd&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;“Hey its OK Frank.

He asked for a suit “exactly as I was wearing it, with no alterations,” Browne recalled; Bowie later donned it during a televised concert at Radio City Music Hall. Browne&#39;s look has since filtered into the mainstream. The rows of high-water pants in any Gap store owe a debt to his work, as does J. Crew&#39;s ubiquitous slim-cut Ludlow suit. Anna Wintour, the editor of &lt;em>;Vogue&lt;/em>; (and the global chief content officer of Condé Nast, the parent company of &lt;em>;The New Yorker&lt;/em>;), works closely with Bolton as the co-chair of the Met Gala and counts the couple among her good friends. She told me, of the Browne silhouette, “Now we accept it as being absolutely part of the fashion vocabulary. He completely changed the way we see.” One Browne staff member recalled that construction workers used to jeer at him when he walked down the street in his gray skirt. Today they just yell, “Hey, nice Thom Browne!”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;One of Browne&#39;s publicists had given me an official invitation to the couture show, which was printed on card stock as thick as a Wasa cracker and included a small square insert bearing the request “. 。 。 Please wear your best grey.” (Browne has a fondness for ellipses and prefers to spell “gray” the British way.) On the day of the event, the sky above the Palais Garnier&#39;s Beaux-Arts façade was a mottled, hazy apricot. Owing to the protests over the police shooting, armored guards stood around the building&#39;s perimeter. At the back entrance, I met one of Browne&#39;s lead publicists, Jonathon Zadrzynski—known as JZ—a skinny redhead wearing a full Thom Browne suit. I asked if he was roasting in the summer heat, and he shrugged. “We&#39;re used to it,” he said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Browne was inside in an airy rehearsal room with florid crown moldings and softly glowing globe lights. He stood quietly watching as two women added finishing touches to an ivory “gargoyle” gown that was hanging on a canvas dress form. There were two hours left until showtime.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;grat2t&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;“She wore gray!” Zadrzynski said to Browne, pointing to my outfit, a Rick Owens dress in a chalkboard hue.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;“And I thank you for that,” Browne said, flashing a smile. He walked over to another dress form to inspect a hulking trapezoidal blanket coat that his team had covered in ornate nautical embroidery—a sailboat, a lighthouse, conch shells, stalks of kelp. Sarah-Jane Wilde, a British American jewelry designer and former model, appeared suddenly from behind a rolling rack. “It&#39;s beautiful, Thom,” she said. A close friend and collaborator of Browne&#39;s, Wilde was wearing a custom black seersucker Thom Browne minidress with a matching cape. With her long black hair and her eyes painted with kohl and gold shimmer, she looked like a dapper Cleopatra.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“I&#39;m just here as a cheerleader,” Wilde said to me. “Thom kind of lives in his own world, of his own making. I call it the champagne bubble.” Glancing down at her outfit, she added, “That&#39;s why I&#39;d &lt;em>;never&lt;/em>; wear anything other than Thom. Why would you want to leave the bubble?”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Around the corner, in a hair-and-makeup room, the British makeup artist Isamaya Ffrench and her team were painting models&#39; faces with splotches of neon eyeshadow, inspired by Visage&#39;s New Romantic eighties look—the only pops of color in the show. Jordan Roth, a Broadway theatre producer and real-estate heir who had been cast as the other pigeon, sat in front of a vanity, sipping bottled water, as a makeup artist glued down his eyebrows. “The first piece Thom ever sent me was this exquisite &lt;em>;sculpture&lt;/em>;, with an hourglass shape and a codpiece,” he said. “The hyper-masculinized and hyper-feminized aspects went straight to my heart.” He swept one arm dramatically across the room. “It just makes sense that we are here now, because Thom is the &lt;em>;height&lt;/em>; of operatic fashion.”&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;A model dressed in red white and blue and holding an American flag emerges from a hole in the floor of an office.&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650368c83731717dab8d71d4/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/230925_r43008.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650368c83731717dab8d71d4/master/w_120,c_limit/230925_r43008.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650368c83731717dab8d71d4/master/w_240,c_limit/230925_r43008.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650368c83731717dab8d71d4/master/w_320,c_limit/230925_r43008.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650368c83731717dab8d71d4/master/w_640,c_limit/230925_r43008.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650368c83731717dab8d71d4/master/w_960,c_limit/230925_r43008.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650368c83731717dab8d71d4/master/w_1280,c_limit/230925_r43008.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650368c83731717dab8d71d4/master/w_1600,c_limit/230925_r43008.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;A look from Fall 2022. Browne&#39;s runway presentations are known for their narrative sophistication, but he describes his references as “more Bugs Bunny than Proust.”&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;p >;Guests had started to arrive, and some made their way backstage. Maisie Williams, a twenty-six-year-old British actress who played Arya Stark on “Game of Thrones,” carried an aquamarine Hector bag—one of Browne&#39;s most popular items, which is modelled on his eight-year-old dachshund of the same name and costs at least seventeen hundred dollars—and stroked it as if it were a real dog. Her outfit, a long pleated Wedgwood-blue skirt and boned corset, paired with a coördinating necktie, was the kind of thing a gentlewoman might once have worn to ride sidesaddle.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“I love the corset,” Williams said, placing a hand on her stomach, “because it&#39;s, like, nobody knows I just had a really big sandwich.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Browne had been calm through the previous days&#39; preparations, but as showtime drew nearer he seemed on edge. “Who is supposed to be watching you?” he asked a male model who was loitering out of formation in a bulky brocade jacket. He glanced at another model&#39;s latex thigh-highs, which were beginning to sag around the ankles. “Those don&#39;t look right,” he said. Wilde put her hands on my shoulders and gently steered me toward the exit.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Browne showed in Europe for the first time in 2009, at the venerated Pitti Immagine Uomo menswear exhibition, in Florence. During his presentation, which took place in the auditorium of a military school, forty men, all wearing cropped gray trousers and khaki trenchcoats and carrying black briefcases, walked out in single file and stood next to forty identical mid-century desks. A “boss” at the front of the room rang a bell, and the men sat down and began typing cacophonously on vintage Olivettis, calling to mind the opening scene of Billy Wilder&#39;s “The Apartment.” After several minutes, the men got up and each placed a red apple on the boss&#39;s desk.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Such imagery has led some observers to interpret Browne&#39;s collections as comments on American masculinity. Was Browne turning men into boys? Was he mocking the white-collar worker by making him look cramped in a suit he&#39;s on the verge of outgrowing? The fashion critic Cathy Horyn, writing about another of Browne&#39;s early runway shows, called him the “anti Ralph Lauren,” suggesting that whereas Lauren&#39;s vision of American life was expansive—Gatsbyesque gents in a classic roadster, a couple on a gleaming catamaran—Browne “seems to see a culture shrinking to the point of implosion.”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;feature-large-callout&quot; >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;GroupCalloutWrapper&quot;>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;A look from Spring 2020 features a starfish codpiece.&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6503912f107e3b742cc43d1d/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/230925_r43006_rd2.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6503912f107e3b742cc43d1d/master/w_120,c_limit/230925_r43006_rd2.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6503912f107e3b742cc43d1d/master/w_240,c_limit/230925_r43006_rd2.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6503912f107e3b742cc43d1d/master/w_320,c_limit/230925_r43006_rd2.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6503912f107e3b742cc43d1d/master/w_640,c_limit/230925_r43006_rd2.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6503912f107e3b742cc43d1d/master/w_960,c_limit/230925_r43006_rd2.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6503912f107e3b742cc43d1d/master/w_1280,c_limit/230925_r43006_rd2.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6503912f107e3b742cc43d1d/master/w_1600,c_limit/230925_r43006_rd2.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;A look from Spring 2020 features a starfish codpiece.&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;A model lies on the floor in a yellow beaded dress beside a large decorative swordfish.&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650368cd25274af116db7ff1/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/230925_r43007.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650368cd25274af116db7ff1/master/w_120,c_limit/230925_r43007.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650368cd25274af116db7ff1/master/w_240,c_limit/230925_r43007.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650368cd25274af116db7ff1/master/w_320,c_limit/230925_r43007.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650368cd25274af116db7ff1/master/w_640,c_limit/230925_r43007.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650368cd25274af116db7ff1/master/w_960,c_limit/230925_r43007.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650368cd25274af116db7ff1/master/w_1280,c_limit/230925_r43007.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650368cd25274af116db7ff1/master/w_1600,c_limit/230925_r43007.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;A gown from Spring 2019 evokes a mermaid with beaded shells at the bodice.&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Browne told me that he struggled, at first, to find a “balance between the conceptual and the commercial.” Menswear has experienced an “unprecedented boom” in recent years, according to Business of Fashion, an industry Web site. But by some estimates it constitutes only around thirty per cent of fashion-industry revenue. Menswear designers who want to expand their customer base—and who don&#39;t want to work for a legacy fashion house—often move into women&#39;s wear, accessories, fragrances, and other categories that make up a so-called life-style brand. Browne got a foothold in fashion&#39;s mainstream by collaborating with blue-blooded heritage labels. For five years, beginning in 2007, he designed a capsule collection at Brooks Brothers, called “Black Fleece.” The collection&#39;s suits, at around twenty-five hundred dollars, were almost double the price of the company&#39;s traditional suits (and about half the price of those made under Browne&#39;s own label). In 2009, Browne also designed a collection for the ski outfitter Moncler, featuring lapelled puffer coats and beanies in red, white, and blue. But in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis Browne&#39;s business almost collapsed, and he pivoted toward more traditional paths to financial stability. In 2011, with an investment from a Japanese wholesale distribution company, he launched his first women&#39;s line, with plaid skirt suits and grosgrain-trimmed capelets. His company now operates more than a hundred retail stores around the world.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Browne told me that he “hates trends,” but the ascendancy of his brand coincided with a revived interest in preppy style, spurred in part by the popularity of the TV shows “Gossip Girl” and “Mad Men.” Starting in the two-thousands, Polo Ralph Lauren and Lacoste saw a surge in sales, and J. Crew experienced a revitalization under the leadership of the designer Jenna Lyons (who wore Thom Browne to this year&#39;s Kentucky Derby). Like those brands, Thom Browne cannily drew upon the iconography of Ivy League style. From the beginning, as a nod to vintage varsity sweaters, Browne adorned many of his pieces with a trio of white stripes. When, in 2008, the sportswear giant Adidas sent him a cease-and-desist letter, accusing him of stealing its three-banded logo, Browne simply added a fourth stripe. (The problem seemed resolved until he launched a line of eight-hundred-dollar sweatpants and hoodies. Adidas sued for copyright infringement, in 2021, and lost a trial earlier this year. Browne made the news for wearing shorts every day to court.)&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;ma45hs&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Many wealthy consumers today have embraced “quiet luxury”; it is considered déclassé to use visible branding to prove that you paid thousands for your cashmere slacks. Thom Browne is as pricey as such understated brands as Loro Piana or Brunello Cucinelli, but Browne&#39;s designs are relatively aggressive about calling attention to themselves. Lauren Sherman, a fashion-industry correspondent for the media outlet Puck, told me that Browne&#39;s signatures have become as recognizable as the logos of far more profitable brands. “You know instantly when someone is wearing Thom Browne,” she said. The gray suit was once the ultimate cloak of anonymity. Browne has turned it into a badge of conspicuous consumption.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The couture show involved a clever bait and switch: guests were funnelled through the back door of the Palais Garnier and, unbeknownst to them, onto the main opera-house stage. The red velvet proscenium curtain was lowered. A large gray bell made of tulle and wrapped in red-white-and-blue grosgrain hung from the rafters, and several dozen felt pigeons were scattered around the felt-covered floor. On each seat lay a cigarette-size paper scroll, like the message a carrier pigeon might deliver, bearing the line “A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush . 。 .”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The actress Diane Keaton was seated in the front row, wearing a pale-gray Thom Browne three-piece with a matching bowler hat. (Later, in an e-mail, Keaton called the show “astonishing,” adding, “You know me, I love a man&#39;s suit.”) Emma Chamberlain, a Gen Z influencer, stood nearby in an écru Thom Browne laced corset, which she described as “not exactly comfortable.” She confessed that she was dying to take one of the stuffed birds home. “Pigeons are my favorite animal,” she said. “And rats.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;A few feet away, in a navy Thom Browne sheath dress, was the twenty-seven-year-old actress Ayo Edebiri, a star of the hit TV series “The Bear.” The show&#39;s creator, Christopher Storer, is a Browne devotee, and last season Edebiri&#39;s character, a professional cook, received a one-of-a-kind Thom Browne chef&#39;s jacket as a gift. Edebiri had told Browne how breathable it was underneath the hot lights of the set. “He thought that was really funny, because he was, like, &#39;I&#39;m not so known for making things that are functional,&#39; ” she recalled. (After the episode aired, Browne was flooded with requests for kitchen gear. “We&#39;re holding out for Jean-Georges,” he quipped.)&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The show was supposed to begin at five, but at twenty past guests were still milling about. A woman in uniform explained, “We&#39;re waiting for Cardi B. I guess she&#39;s stuck in traffic.” A few minutes later, Cardi made her entrance, wearing a tweed dress in a wiggle style and a foot-high gold filigree headdress. Soon the house lights dimmed. A swelling string overture played from the speakers, followed by a sound effect of thunderous applause. Then the curtain at the front of the room rose to reveal the two thousand red velvet seats of the opera house, each occupied by a cardboard cutout of a figure wearing sunglasses and a Thom Browne suit. The sea of deadpan faces was both spooky and hilarious—what better way to deliver a packed house than to print one? Audience members gasped and then began to applaud along with the soundtrack. Wintour told me later that she considered the stunt, which cost nearly a hundred thousand dollars, to be “one of the largest storytelling moments in Paris.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;During the next thirty minutes, more than fifty looks paraded down the runway. Alek Wek emerged first, wearing a plain Thom Browne suit and a head scarf. She sat onstage, on a piece of luggage, and remained there for the rest of the presentation, making eye contact with each model passing by. The collection was a kind of self-retrospective, but with Browne&#39;s usual motifs carried to elaborate extremes. A series of coats had a plaid pattern—a Browne staple—that was made not with preprinted fabric but by crisscrossing colored threads through tiny glass beads. His typically kitschy nautical themes were pushed into riskier, more grotesque territory. One striped blazer featured a puffy golden lobster whose embroidered claws came up over the shoulders, as if it were trying to drag the model underwater. Browne had strayed from his monochrome palette in previous collections—his 2022 styles included sumptuous evening jackets in mustard, lavender, emerald, and cantaloupe—but his couture looks were nearly all in shades of gray. The effect was to attune the eye to subtle contrasts—the way a gown juxtaposed shiny pewter satin with matte taffeta in a similar hue, or a pair of sequinned ombré trousers changed from charcoal at the hip to faintly ashen at the hem.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;feature-large-callout&quot; >;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;All Thom Browne employees must adhere to the persnickety dress code that Browne calls “uniform.”&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650368cf25274af116db7ff3/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/230925_r43005.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650368cf25274af116db7ff3/master/w_120,c_limit/230925_r43005.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650368cf25274af116db7ff3/master/w_240,c_limit/230925_r43005.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650368cf25274af116db7ff3/master/w_320,c_limit/230925_r43005.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650368cf25274af116db7ff3/master/w_640,c_limit/230925_r43005.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650368cf25274af116db7ff3/master/w_960,c_limit/230925_r43005.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650368cf25274af116db7ff3/master/w_1280,c_limit/230925_r43005.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650368cf25274af116db7ff3/master/w_1600,c_limit/230925_r43005.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;All Thom Browne employees must adhere to the persnickety dress code that Browne calls “uniform.”&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Couture shows traditionally end with the designer&#39;s take on a wedding gown. Browne&#39;s bride, the supermodel Grace Elizabeth, doubled as the train coming into the station. She glided down the center aisle, wearing a beaded, sheer white garment that looked like a tuxedo jacket whose hem was melting to the floor. Two men in swim caps carried the train of the dress. From far away, the piece shimmered as if made of shaved ice. Browne told me later that his team had worked eighteen-hour shifts for three straight weeks to finish it on time. In one hand, Elizabeth carried a large leather clutch in the shape of a steam locomotive. It was as if Browne were daring an overcooked gag—a train on a train on a train—to detract from the sombre mood of the proceedings. The fashion critic Amy Fine Collins told me afterward, “There are always moments in Thom&#39;s shows where you have to laugh. And typically you &lt;em>;never&lt;/em>; laugh at a fashion show.” (Browne told me that, beneath the gown, Elizabeth was wearing a pair of panties decorated with a bejewelled crab. “The joke is self-explanatory,” he said.)&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Some designers are interested in exalting the person wearing their creations. The late Alber Elbaz, who made elegantly draped women&#39;s gowns for Lanvin, said, “I&#39;m not trying to transform anyone, I&#39;m just trying to make everyone, as much as I can, a better version of themselves.” Browne, by contrast, has been criticized for his punishing demands on models—the impossibly high shoes, the agonizingly slow processions under heavy layers of wool. In the past, he has obscured models&#39; faces or tied their hands behind their backs. Browne told me, “Sometimes I like it when my clothes negate the person. Not because I don&#39;t respect the guy or girl wearing them.我愿意。 But I really want to see a fully fleshed-out idea.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The morning after the show, Browne was back in his showroom on Avenue Montaigne to receive private clients. Compared with the lively makeshift atelier upstairs, the space was hushed and austere. Stepping off the elevator, guests were greeted with the scent of a single Thom Browne vetiver candle sitting on a teak desk. When I entered the display area, where the couture pieces had been artfully arranged on mannequins and rolling racks, an employee asked me if I wouldn&#39;t mind placing my handbag (gray, but not Thom Browne) in the back room.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;A man whom one employee called the brand&#39;s “biggest client in Mexico” came through, wearing a suit printed with a “Moby-Dick”-inspired toile, from the new fall ready-to-wear collection. Sharon Coplan Hurowitz, an art adviser and New York socialite, was there in jodhpurs, but the night before her ensemble had been more “Alice in Wonderland,” including a tilted-teacup headpiece by Jones balanced precariously atop her head.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Marisa Hunt, one of Browne&#39;s “client-relations managers,” arrived with Chris Sunahara, a thirtysomething Google executive and self-professed “Thom Browne obsessive” who was wearing a gray Browne suit with added tuxedo tails. Sunahara told me that he discovered Browne&#39;s suits after losing a significant amount of weight and feeling liberated to try new ways of dressing. “I remember thinking, OK, this stuff is expensive, maybe I&#39;ll buy a T-shirt,” he said. But the completeness of Browne&#39;s uniform can serve as a potent sales tactic. Doing it halfway would be more unfashionable than not doing it at all. “You have to have the shoes and the suit and the glasses—everything down to your feet,” Sunahara said. “That&#39;s how they get you.” In less than a year, he had bought more than sixty pieces.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Listen, as a gay male, you &lt;em>;dream&lt;/em>; of fashion, and I could never fit in this stuff,” he said, his voice growing shaky. “When you wear Thom Browne, you get so much attention, and it&#39;s kind of nice to give that energy when you walk down the street.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“That is making me feel all the feels,” Hunt said, handing Sunahara a coupe glass of champagne.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Sunahara approached an ivory gown that Browne had described to me as his “mermaid sashimi dress,” featuring metallic breasts and scales on the front and a jagged golden fish skeleton running down the back. I learned later that it was priced at sixty thousand dollars.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;51a6r5&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;“Oh, my God,” Sunahara said, passing his hand over the brocade. He asked if Browne might consider making a version for him with a six-pack instead of breasts. “Like a mer&lt;em>;man&lt;/em>;,” he added.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;He left the showroom empty-handed, but the next day he returned to order a new made-to-measure Thom Browne suit.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Despite living with an eminent fashion historian, Browne is not steeped in fashion history, and prefers it that way. He doesn&#39;t make mood boards for his collections, choosing instead to transmit his vision to his team through conversation. “Andrew approaches things very intellectually,” Browne told me. “I&#39;m more just instinctual.” At one point, remarking on the use of lobster imagery in his designs, I brought up Elsa Schiaparelli&#39;s famous 1937 lobster dinner dress. “I wish I didn&#39;t know about that,” Browne said, adding that he finds it “crippling” to be aware of what other designers have done.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Some critics have tried to dissect Browne&#39;s work in relation to his biography—his thigh-baring shorts as a queer statement, for example—but he resists such connections. “I love gay men, and straight men, and gay women, and straight women,” he told me. He tries to stay away from political debates as well. He dressed Michelle Obama for the 2013 Presidential Inauguration and said in 2018 that he would be equally open to working with Melania Trump. When I asked him about this comment, which provoked consternation at the time, he replied, “What I said was that I respect the office of the First Lady. I would hope most people are proud to be American.”&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;A plaid ensemble with feathered shorts from Fall 2011.&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650368d209d49c7c04e6daa1/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/230925_r43013.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650368d209d49c7c04e6daa1/master/w_120,c_limit/230925_r43013.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650368d209d49c7c04e6daa1/master/w_240,c_limit/230925_r43013.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650368d209d49c7c04e6daa1/master/w_320,c_limit/230925_r43013.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650368d209d49c7c04e6daa1/master/w_640,c_limit/230925_r43013.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650368d209d49c7c04e6daa1/master/w_960,c_limit/230925_r43013.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650368d209d49c7c04e6daa1/master/w_1280,c_limit/230925_r43013.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650368d209d49c7c04e6daa1/master/w_1600,c_limit/230925_r43013.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;A plaid ensemble with feathered shorts from Fall 2011.&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;p >;Browne&#39;s reticence can seem at odds with his growing public role in American fashion. Last January, he replaced Tom Ford as the chairman of the Council of Fashion Designers of America, the trade organization that represents four hundred US designers and oversees New York Fashion Week. When he first assumed his CFDA position, he sent out a note to his fellow-designers saying that although he supported their endeavors “in spirit,” he would not be attending any of their shows in person that season—he would be busy “challenging myself to create something memorable.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;One afternoon in August, I visited Browne and Bolton at their home, a Georgian-style mansion that was built a century ago for the heiress Anne Harriman Vanderbilt. I was greeted at the entrance by Browne and a fusillade of high-pitched barking from Hector, who was bounding around Browne&#39;s feet. The dog, who has his own Instagram account and often wears a miniature Thom Browne sweater, might be the most famous pet-muse in fashion since Karl Lagerfeld&#39;s cat Choupette.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“He&#39;s a real &lt;em>;schweetie&lt;/em>;,” Browne said, scooping him up and giving him a scratch on the chin.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Browne and Bolton&#39;s taste in décor is a mix of the ornate and the severe. When they renovated, they painted the bright-blue front door black. The foyer features a black-and-white marble checkerboard floor and a large bronze cupid sculpture by Augustus Saint-Gaudens. In the dimly lit dining room, paintings of Jesus and four decorative urns created the atmosphere of a rectory.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;We went out onto the back terrace, which overlooked an enormous lawn stretching down to the East River. From this angle, the water looked like a private lido. A publicist brought out several chilled mini-bottles of Perrier and crystal goblets engraved with the logo of the Ritz Paris.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Bolton, a native of Lancashire, England, is pale and trim, with floppy gray hair and angular cheekbones. His outfit had an air of après-tennis: a gray-and-white striped Thom Browne T-shirt with Browne sneakers and socks. As he sat down next to Browne, he noted, a bit sheepishly, that his shorts were Ralph Lauren. “I would say ninety per cent of my wardrobe is Thom,” Bolton said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Hey, I like the shorts,” Browne said. “I do think Andrew has good style. We reference it so often in the office—&#39;How would Andrew wear it?&#39; ”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Browne and Bolton first met at a fashion conference in 2005, but Bolton told me that he had been aware of Browne&#39;s work for some time before. “I was in London working on a project with Savile Row tailors, and I remember them being completely up in arms about him,” Bolton said. “I suppose the first I heard of Thom was as a travesty to tailoring.” He went on, “You know, I think that was sort of a homophobia, because at first it was so associated with fashionable gay men wearing this particular suit. Maybe it still is.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Like Browne, Bolton grew up middle class and had no education in fashion. He studied anthropology at the University of East Anglia and curated East Asian art at the Victoria &amp;amp; Albert Museum before arriving at the Met, two decades ago. More than one person I spoke to referred to Bolton and Browne as American fashion&#39;s reigning power couple, and it&#39;s clear that their positions reinforce each other; the Met Costume Institute&#39;s 2021 exhibition “In America: A Lexicon of Fashion,” curated by Bolton, included two Thom Browne suits in a pantheon of looks that have defined a national style. But the men told me that they still see themselves as industry outsiders and that their friends, for the most part, “are not fashion people.” They attend the Met Gala every year, but when I asked whom they like to entertain at home Bolton let out a small laugh. “No one,” he said. He recalled that when Wintour first came over she said, “Why did you buy such a pretentious house? You never have anybody over. It&#39;s just going to be you and Thom rattling around.” In their free time, the pair like to order in and watch old movies. (Neither likes to cook.)&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Many critics have seemed pessimistic lately about the state of the American fashion industry. Whereas New York was once a hub of global fashion—particularly in the eighties and nineties, when designers like Marc Jacobs, Donna Karan, Oscar de la Renta, and Calvin Klein were all showing in Manhattan—the industry&#39;s center of gravity has since shifted to Europe. The Row, New York&#39;s quintessential quiet-luxury brand, recently moved its production operations to Italy. Perhaps the buzziest show of the year, the American musician Pharrell Williams&#39;s début as the men&#39;s creative director for Louis Vuitton, took place on the Pont Neuf, in Paris. The US ecosystem “has taken a bit of a walloping,” Tim Blanks, the fashion critic, told me, adding, “When Thom first arrived on the scene, there was a real sense of dynamism, and I haven&#39;t felt that in some time.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Browne said that his goal with the CFDA was to guide young American designers toward thinking about “longevity,” as opposed to following flash-in-the-pan trends or the tides of social media. “The most important thing I can do is just lead by example,” he said, adding, “I didn&#39;t know how to sustain this business at the beginning, but then I did. And no one can really help you but yourself.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The two men showed me a forthcoming coffee-table book on Browne&#39;s work, edited by Bolton. He had spent a year pulling hundreds of looks from Browne&#39;s archive, and had written an introductory essay about the history of the color gray.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Andrew selected everything,” Browne said. “He said to me once, which I think is very true, that designers are the worst at curating their own work.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;He got up from the table, prompting Hector, who had been snoozing underfoot, to bolt upright.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Want to go out and bark, Hecky?” Browne said, moving toward the back door. “He&#39;s horribly trained.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“He &lt;em>;can&lt;/em>; be very friendly,” Bolton said. “When we are on the street, he always runs up to men in gray suits.” ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;feature-large-callout&quot;

>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;On a Saturday afternoon in August, while the Red Sox were trouncing the Yankees in the Bronx on the way to a series sweep, members of the Baseball Project, a supergroup that sings about baseball, were settling into the greenroom of the Sinclair, a small venue in Cambridge, Massachusetts, not too far from Fenway Park. The night before, they&#39;d performed in Brooklyn—Yankees territory, more or less. “They were yelling for &#39;The Yankee Flipper,&#39; ” Scott McCaughey, one of the band&#39;s guitarists and singers, said. He was referring to a ballad he wrote about the time Jack (Black Jack) McDowell, the former Yankees ace, got drunk with members of REM—including McCaughey and one of his Baseball Project bandmates, Mike Mills. “Sorry,” McCaughey joked in the greenroom. “We don&#39;t know how to play that anymore.” McCaughey is a Giants fan. “You get sick of hearing the Yankees doing so great all the time,” he said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“You don&#39;t have to worry anymore,” Linda Pitmon, a Yankees fan and the band&#39;s drummer, said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The Baseball Project also includes another former member of REM, Peter Buck, along with Steve Wynn, the singer and guitarist who leads the Dream Syndicate. The group was born at a party the night before REM was inducted into the Rock &amp;amp; Roll Hall of Fame, in 2007. Wynn recalled that he and Pitmon, who are married, met McCaughey there, and they started talking about their shared baseball obsession.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“I&#39;d met you before,” McCaughey interrupted.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“In the men&#39;s room in a Seattle club,” Wynn clarified.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Scott and I, each unbeknownst to the other, had the idea of someday writing a few songs or an entire album about baseball,” Wynn continued. They began to discuss it, and within a week they&#39;d swapped several songs. A few months later, they had a whole album, “Volume One: Frozen Ropes and Dying Quails.” That was fifteen years ago. In the meantime, REM broke up.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;The Baseball Project has just come out with its fourth album, “Grand Salami Time!,” produced by REM&#39;s old producer Mitch Easter and recorded at his compound in North Carolina. They play mostly on small stages, although they often throw out the first pitch or sing “The Star-Spangled Banner” before ballgames. When the group had a night off in Boston a few years ago, Josh Kantor, the organist at Fenway, who has toured with the band, took them behind the scenes of the Red Sox&#39; ancient bandbox. Pitmon rolled around in the warning-track dirt in front of the Green Monster.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“I was, like, &#39;Oh, man, what&#39;s it like to play at, you know, an eighty-thousand-seat football stadium?&#39; ” Kantor recalled asking Mills. “He&#39;s, like, &#39;What&#39;s it like to play at the World Series?&#39; And I was, like, &#39;Oh, right. That actually is really cool.&#39; ”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Mills once invited Kantor to join their fantasy team—they play in a league with other indie musicians, including Stephen Malkmus, from Pavement, and Ira Kaplan, of Yo La Tengo—but warned him that he would have to take it seriously. Kantor knew that Mills meant it, and declined.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;McCaughey usually wins the league, though every member of the band is competitive—except for Buck. “I&#39;ll be in the van back there, and it&#39;s like fantasy whatever—”&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;“Fantasy baseball,” McCaughey said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“ &#39;Oh, this guy has a &lt;em>;groin pull&lt;/em>;,&#39; ” Buck went on.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Buck doesn&#39;t follow sports. “He&#39;s our token non-baseball man,” Wynn said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“I like all these people and I like the songs,” Buck explained. He does appreciate what he calls baseball&#39;s “old characters”: “They were like Wild West gunfighters. They were weird, you know, in a way that&#39;s now impossible.” He went on, “They were like rockabilly stars or rhythm-and-blues stars, except that they were wearing a uniform and hitting a little ball.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;These days, the money is bigger and any weirdness is under wraps. The band doesn&#39;t shy away from the game as it is now—there&#39;s a song about Shohei Ohtani, and a sly take on doctored balls (“Just like Brylcreem, a little dab will do ya / I use that LA look to try and fool ya”)—but it can be a struggle to come up with material. “A lot of the current players are kind of boring,” McCaughey said. “They don&#39;t drink and carouse like they used to. I mean, probably for a good reason.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The big themes persist, in baseball and in music. Wynn was on a solo tour, staying in a run-down hotel outside Buffalo, when Buck sent him the music for the song “Journeyman.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“It was great music,” Wynn said. “I went, Yeah. A guy goes town to town, just does the best he can, and does something pretty well so he can keep working. And I can write a song like that.” ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;9wacu4&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;9vsaf&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 18 Sep 2023 19:06:01 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“Mom Rage,” Reviewed.]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/09/25/mom-rage-the-everyday-crisis-of-modern-motherhood-minna-dubin-book-review]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-18T10:00:00.000Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6500e99864406378c0ed5105/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/230925_r42988web-social.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;article >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attribute-verso-pattern=&quot;article-body&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;ArticlePageChunks&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;On September 13, 2019, Minna Dubin, a mother in Berkeley, California, published a brief, confessional &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/15/parenting/mother-rage.html&quot;>;essay&lt;/a>; in the &lt;em>;Times&lt;/em>;&#39; parenting section titled “&lt;em >;The Rage Mothers Don&#39;t Talk About&lt;/em>;.” Under the subtitle—“Mothers are supposed to be patient martyrs, so our rage festers beneath our shame”—there was a photograph, taken from behind, of a woman and a boy of two or three. They sat side by side on a shaded stoop, their arms linked, and seemed to be examining something in a shrub beside them. The boy was shirtless and had a small brown mark in the middle of his back. The top of his head was level with the woman&#39;s shoulder. Like many boys of his age, the bottom of his hair had grown longer and thicker than the rest of it, curling into a soft, wide triangle that sloped down his neck. At the moment the photograph was taken, he seemed to be readying himself to pull away—although it was impossible to know for sure.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The photograph, which Dubin supplied, was not in itself remarkable, but it gained a strange pathos from the essay that followed, which began: “The rage lives in my hands, rolls down my fingers clenching to fists. I want to hurt someone. I am tears and fury and violence.” These sentences were lurid, shocking in their directness and their extremity. What explained her rage? Her son would not get into the car, or eat the foods that she wanted him to eat, or let her brush his teeth. He bit other children. He ignored her. She yelled at him, threatened him, squeezed his arms, threw him in his crib, and wanted badly to hit him. She ate too many sweets and wandered the house, ashamed and lonely, whispering to stop herself from laying her hands on him: “Don&#39;t touch him, don&#39;t touch him, don&#39;t touch him.” But she was reluctant to speak to anyone, even her husband. “Mother rage is not &#39;appropriate,&#39; ” she wrote. “As if mother rage equals a lack of love. As if rage has never shared a border with love.” She sensed that her reactions were excessive, but she made no real effort to understand. Understanding was not the point of her essay. The point was to unleash the primal scream of a mother who had regressed—spectacularly, obscenely—into a tantrumming child, not unlike the three-year-old who had spurred her rage in the first place.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The tantrum had its desired effect; immediately, Dubin started to receive messages from mothers around the world. They confided that they, too, struggled with uncontrollable anger and that her story “made them feel less alone,” she reported. Her essay went viral when the &lt;em>;Times&lt;/em>; republished it, in April, 2020, weeks after the surge in &lt;em >;Covid&lt;/em>;-19 cases prompted many governments to close schools. Parents struggled to work from home and care for their children, who were suddenly underfoot all the time; households everywhere grew isolated yet overcrowded, overstimulated yet bored, and exceedingly agitated. “Between stay-at-home orders, &lt;em >;Covid&lt;/em>;-19 health concerns, financial instability (or fear of it), and police violence against Black people, it is no surprise that mothers are experiencing intensified rage,” Dubin wrote, in a follow-up essay that was published in the &lt;em>;Times&lt;/em>; on July 6, 2020, with the headline “ &#39;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/parenting/mom-rage-pandemic.html&quot;>;&lt;em>;I Am Going to Physically Explode&#39;: Mom Rage in a Pandemic&lt;/em>;&lt;/a>;.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;GenericCallout&quot;>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;external-link-embed--inline&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;a aria-label=&quot;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;The Best Books We Read This Week&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.newyorker.com/best-books-2023&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/best-books-2023&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;&lt;span >;&lt;strong>;The Best Books We Read This Week&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/a>;&lt;p >;&lt;em>;Read our reviews of notable new fiction and nonfiction, updated every Wednesday.&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;a aria-label=&quot;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;The Best Books We Read This Week&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.newyorker.com/best-books-2023&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/best-books-2023&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/63c800e4e99d89b838ada996/1:1/w_200%2Cc_limit/undefined&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/63c800e4e99d89b838ada996/1:1/w_120,c_limit/undefined 120w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/a>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;The artlessness of Dubin&#39;s essays made them tremendously gripping—so gripping as to deflect certain intellectual and ethical questions that readers might have asked of her central concept, “mom rage.” It was a term that Dubin had adapted from a 1998 essay by Anne Lamott, called “Mother Rage: Theory and Practice.” Whereas Lamott&#39;s essay was a self-deprecating, mock-scholarly comedy about parenting, Dubin presented mom rage as a solemn social diagnosis. But what was “mom rage,” exactly? How did it differ from related diagnoses, such as anger issues or impulse-control disorders? More sensitive questions suggested themselves, too. How reliable was Dubin as a narrator? Did the photograph on the stoop suggest that this tender moment was the prevailing reality of her life, and that her rage was secondary? Or was the rage hiding in plain sight, coursing beneath the surface of even this placid scene? And what about her son? The photograph showed two subjects, an Everymother and an Everychild, but in the essay only one could have a voice. The silence of the child was easy to overlook when the speaker insisted that it was her speech that had been silenced, and that her confession defied a powerful taboo. But who enforced this taboo? In the twenty-first century, in the city of Berkeley, California, who was it that expected a mother like Dubin to “say nothing” about her frustrations or to be “martyr-like” in her behavior?&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Melodramas of oppression and resistance do not brook much nuance, and, in any event, it can be difficult to insist on ethical complexity when faced with a story that resonated with many readers. The two essays seeded “mom rage” as a new idiom that parents, psychologists, educators, wellness coaches, bloggers, podcasters, and television personalities increasingly deploy to map the explosive emotional terrain of motherhood. “We Should Be Normalizing Mom Rage” insisted a 2022 headline on the Web site Parents.com, which defined mom rage as “the uncontrollable anger mothers can experience that leads to verbal and /or physical explosions” and attributed it to a “lack of self-care,” “little support,” and a “raging pandemic.” Other commentators were quick to agree: “Mom rage is a real thing”; “Mom rage is real”; “Mom Rage Is Not Your Fault”; “I&#39;m Raging, You&#39;re Raging.” In the slightly aggressive, slightly insecure posture of these essays, one could detect a plea for legitimacy that doubled as a plea for absolution. A bargain, it seemed, was being negotiated: If we, the readers, could accept the reality of “mom rage” as a phenomenon that originated somewhere outside of, or beyond, the individual&#39;s control, then they, the writers, the mothers who yelled and threatened and handled their children roughly, could be freed from their self-doubt and remorse.&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot;

The first half of “Mom Rage” squats at the intersection of these genres. The anger of mothers is overdetermined by the “white supremacist, homophobic, classist, ableist, xenophobic, transphobic, misogynistic, capitalist patriarchy,” Dubin writes. The capitalist patriarchy props up the ideology of “capital-M Motherhood,” which “tells mothers we must throw ourselves full throttle into our mothering job—researching, planning, contacting, scheduling, overseeing, washing, tidying, folding, driving, thanking, inviting, hosting, cooking, preparing, and sharing.” Rage is simultaneously “a natural reaction to being systematically stripped of one&#39;s power” and a source of “power in its potential for individual and cultural change.” The remedies Dubin proposes range from state-subsidized child care to communal parenting, art-making (“I recommend the transformative power of creative practice,” she writes), and non-normative sexual arrangements (“I also recommend queerness”).&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Dubin&#39;s claims and prescriptions are, by now, staples of pop-feminist nonfiction. Such personal essays and polemics are built on the foundational arguments of an earlier generation of feminists—among them, Silvia Federici, Mariarosa Dalla Costa, and Selma James—who, in the nineteen-seventies, argued that capitalism&#39;s emphasis on waged work outside the home occluded the unwaged work of housewives and mothers. It is a measure of how influential such theorizing has become that this proposition, once radical, is almost received opinion among a new crop of cultural critics. But, by the same token, the newer books—call them “feminish”—engage only sparingly with the original sources. Reading paraphrases of paraphrases of paraphrases, one starts to feel as if there is something a little hollow and shiftless about the ease with which phrases such as “white supremacist, homophobic, classist, ableist, xenophobic, transphobic, misogynistic, capitalist patriarchy” are trotted out. We get the right words, strung together like marquee lights, but not the structural analysis that puts them in relation to one another.&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;As in Dubin&#39;s first essay, much of “Mom Rage” is memoiristic, with long indignant riffs about her experiences living in the Bay Area with her husband, parenting their son (who is now nine) and their five-year-old daughter. Her story is bolstered by the testimony of fifty mothers whom she interviewed for the book and who all “identify as having mom rage.” They comprise a racially and economically diverse group—Frannie is a “bisexual Taiwanese Canadian mom of two tweens,” Ceci is “a Mexican American paralegal”—but they are troublingly homogenous from a methodological point of view. Dubin does not appear to have interviewed any mothers who do not claim to suffer from mom rage. Nor has she interviewed fathers, rageful or otherwise, a renegade pack of mansplaining, gaslighting, happy-go-lucky ne&#39;er-do-wells. “Fatherhood is a side gig,” she writes. “In Western culture, fathers get to be anything they want.” A tiny bit of feminist theory might have complicated this claim—after all, the exploitation of women in the home is bound up with the exploitation of men at work—but it plays little role in “Mom Rage,” despite brief cameos by Adrienne Rich and Audre Lorde. Nor does Dubin consider literature, in which tales of angry, ambivalent, thwarted, and narcissistic mothers constitute a formidable canon of their own, beginning in 431 BC, with Euripides&#39; Medea and extending to Elena Ferrante&#39;s Leda, in “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Lost-Daughter-Novel-Elena-Ferrante/dp/1609457692&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Lost-Daughter-Novel-Elena-Ferrante/dp/1609457692&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Lost-Daughter-Novel-Elena-Ferrante/dp/1609457692&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;The Lost Daughter&lt;/a>;,” the subject of a recent essay in the Cut (by another mother of two) titled “The Perpetual Rage of Motherhood. ”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Absent history or culture, every feeling in “Mom Rage” is negotiated on the terrain of power: who has it, who wants it, and who is denied it. Occasionally, power is rooted in a set of concrete practices and institutions, as in Dubin&#39;s spirited discussion of hospital-based maternal health care. More often it is an atmospheric phenomenon, a feature of abstract entities, such as “the powers that be (the white supremacist, capitalist patriarchy),” or metaphors, such as “Motherhood&#39;s PR team.” No doubt the patriarchy and capitalism have power, but how precisely that power results in the rage of mothers toward their children, as opposed to their husbands or their bosses, remains unclear. (The powerlessness of children relative to parents is never considered, but it is the anchor of Lamott&#39;s original article: “One reason I think we get so angry mad at our children is because we can. Who else can you talk to like this?”) No doubt, too, the ideology of Motherhood is diffuse and compelling; as Dubin points out, more than half of Americans believe children are better off when their mothers do not work outside the home, while only eight per cent believe the same about fathers. But what does it mean to claim that its “ideas are in the water we guzzle every day?” Water does not have any ideas swimming around in it, let alone the ideas filtered in by Motherhood&#39;s PR team, which, as Dubin acknowledges, also does not quite make sense, either literally or figuratively. “The PR team?” “What even &lt;em>;is&lt;/em>; that?” she asks at the end of the chapter devoted to explaining it.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;The imprecision of Dubin&#39;s language strands her argument on unstable ground. Often, one wonders if what is truly at stake for her is not a dramatic political battle between the oppressors and the oppressed but a quieter struggle between personal freedom and unfreedom:&lt;/p>;&lt;blockquote >;&lt;div >;&lt;p>;Pre-motherhood I was slippery, a thousand tiny, silver fish—a woman, a writer, a friend, an educator, a queer person, a performer, a Philly girl, a Bay Area transplant, a wife, a lefty Jew. With nothing to lose, no property, no fancy job, no kids, I was a flight risk. I could do or say anything. But now that I have children, I can&#39;t stray too far, mouth off too much. There are children to consider! To feed. To pick up from school. Mothers have obligations, schedules, other people to put first. My name has been erased, and I&#39;m reduced to one role, one thing.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/blockquote>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;a6gks5p&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;duith8&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;One of the difficulties of being a parent, as Dubin intuits, is that it orients you to others in a knotty, demanding way. There are moments when I fantasize that, one day, my children will ask me the question that Henry James&#39;s Isabel Archer asks Madame Merle, the woman who has puppeteered her into making the decisions Isabel believes she has made of her own free will: “What have you to do with me?” To which I would respond, as Madame Merle does, “Everything”—but also, “Nothing.” Your child is and is not an extension of yourself. He is both an intimate and a stranger. He imitates you and he rejects you, and it is not always possible to anticipate which gesture is more startling. You can attempt to control what he does, to a point, but you cannot control what the world does to him, or how he responds to it. What we learn from our children is nothing less than our own limitations—our passivity and our susceptibility when faced with what was once a part of us, but is, ultimately, other to us.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;From this baffling relationship between self and other there can emerge an ambient feeling of unfreedom. The great responsibility and the great vulnerability of being a parent can be unsettling for one&#39;s identity, in the past, present, and future. It can be difficult to recall with any certainty who you were before you spent so much of your time wondering, ruminating, fretting, or catastrophizing about another person. If, like Dubin, you are relatively privileged, you know that you have chosen your unfreedom. Yet you may still feel that you did not choose to bind yourself to these people, these intimate strangers, or to this whole life. By this logic, the entire atmosphere of parenthood, no matter how privileged it may appear from the outside, can come to feel like “a scam,” as Dubin puts it. And the decision not to make lunch can seem like the ultimate horizon of liberty.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Acceptance of the fact that parenthood necessitates the relinquishment of various freedoms would seem to be one of its central features. “Selfish,” one of my favorite stories by Lydia Davis, captures this peculiar state by evoking a parent who thinks, “The useful thing about being a selfish person is that when your children get hurt you don&#39;t mind so much because you yourself are alright.” The story is structured around a painful irony. Its narrator does not tell us that she is a selfish person, only that it would be useful for “you,” a parent, to be one. We sense that the narrator is not a selfish person and is not all right when her child gets hurt; that a selfish person would not possess the insight to write these lines in the first place. And we sense, too, that it would be foolish to believe that a parent could simply choose to be a selfish person—that as a state of being it exceeds conscious choice, just as it very likely exceeds all the cultural and social changes that might improve the conditions of mothers. A mother&#39;s vulnerability to her children cannot be redistributed with the same exactitude that her work can be. Neither free day care nor a night off from doing the dishes can inure her to how her child&#39;s pain can, by shaping his identity, shape hers.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Dubin is not really imagining the freedom to be more than “one thing” but the freedom to run away from this bind and into the arms of nothing—no fixed roles, no lasting responsibilities. This is a negative freedom that does not expand one&#39;s sense of self so much as shrink it to pure potentiality. But you cannot live in potentiality forever. If spouses and children do not get in the way, then time will. In its purest and most personal moments, Dubin&#39;s rage seems like grief for the future, which is available to her children in a way it will never again be available to her.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Although rage is the passion that gets top billing in the book, it is made to share the stage with another feeling: shame. Shame is simultaneously the cause and the effect of rage. “Society punishes angry women and shames mothers who step out of their domestic box of caregiving,” Dubin writes. If the shame of not living up to the ideals of capital-“M” Motherhood causes mothers to rage, then it also causes them to stay silent, lest they articulate a greater and deeper shame: that they really are a “bad mom.” “Shame” and its variants appear with greater frequency as “Mom Rage” shifts into its second half, which looks to the genre of self-help to break the “Mom Rage Cycle” and, with it, the “Shame Spiral.” “Self-isolation is a key component of the Shame Spiral for me,” Dubin writes. “I am so deep in my own sorrow and self-hatred after a rage, I have a hard time reaching out to friends.”&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot;

writes. Sedgwick, who was also one of the great theorists of shame, saw the relationship between mother and child as a model for the isolation (and, more surprisingly, the possibility of intimacy) that shame can produce. The hot blush or the averted gaze that arises when a mother shouts at her child are “semaphores of trouble,” the outward signs of a breach in their intimacy that has caused them to shrink from each other and into their innermost loneliness. At the same time, these visible responses are invitations for the mother and child to repair their relationship. They can make it anew with an apology or an embrace—and, in doing so, they can make themselves anew, with a deeper understanding of their identities as both linked and separable beings.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Shame is a peculiarly contagious emotion. Like secondhand smoke, it can cling to you from great distances, both literal and metaphoric; consider, for instance, the simultaneous urge to look and to look away that you might feel watching a mother yell at her child in the supermarket, even if the mother and child are completely unknown to you. “One of the strangest features of shame,” Sedgwick writes, “is the way bad treatment of someone else, bad treatment &lt;em>;by&lt;/em>; someone else, someone else&#39;s embarrassment, stigma, debility, bad smell, or strange behavior, seemingly having nothing to do with me can so readily flood me.” For Sedgwick, shame&#39;s capacity to disrupt our sense of identity, by filling us with feelings on behalf of another person, gives it a potentially political dimension. It can be a spur to altering conditions that are abject, embarrassing, and exploitative—not only for ourselves but for others. Attending to shame within the context of a parent-child relationship offers a model by which we may learn to relate to others by learning to perceive them as both similar to and different from ourselves.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Dubin deliberately foregrounds examples of her treatment of her son that may leave one feeling flooded by shame; when, for instance, he goes limp while they are crossing a busy intersection, and, once they reach the other side, she pushes him, causing him to hit his head on the sidewalk. Yet her insistence on not feeling shame short-circuits her acknowledgment of her son&#39;s discreteness from her and robs them both of the opportunity to remake their relationship. Indeed, a perplexing lack of intimacy characterizes her descriptions of her son. In her first &lt;em>;Times&lt;/em>; essay, he was nonspecific, a typically rambunctious three-year-old boy. “His behavior is age-appropriate,” Dubin reassured the reader (and herself). “All kids test limits.” In the book, her son has a name, Ollie, and he is no longer the Everychild she previously presented. Dubin introduces him through his diagnoses: a sensory-processing disorder, fine and gross motor delays, food rigidity, and autism-spectrum disorder. Once we learn this, her mom rage reads differently, as the reaction of a parent facing more than run-of-the-mill challenges. Alarmed by Ollie&#39;s uncomprehending reactions and emotional blankness—“His silence infuriated me,” she writes—she screams and tries to frighten him. Staging these scenes allows her to capture him through his physical responses to her. We learn about his “chubby, tear-streaked face” and the “doughy hugs” he offers to appease his mother. “Between genetics and autism, Ollie never really had a chance,” she writes, and, although the sentence is specific to his challenges with potty training, it is difficult not to hear in it a more general lament or judgment.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;j0pkr&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;“Moms of sick, disabled, or neurodivergent kids all have increased stress levels that make them more prone to mom rage,” Dubin observes. Such stress cannot be underestimated, but the specificity of Dubin&#39;s experience presents a problem for her thesis. Even if we accept her argument that “white supremacist, capitalist patriarchy” shapes the conditions of contemporary motherhood in profoundly unjust ways, it is clear that this is not the whole story of her rage. The book fails to universalize a particular predicament, and, in strenuously attempting to do so, turns into an exercise in ill-advised candor. There are times when one wants to shield both Dubin and her son from such exposure, and times, too, when one feels rage toward Seal Press, which should have used better editorial discretion with a first-time author. Aptly enough, the fortunes of Seal Press echo, in a way, the current mainstreaming of feminist theory in nonfiction publishing. Founded by two feminists in a Seattle garage in 1976, it has now, after a sequence of corporate acquisitions, ended up as an imprint of Hachette, one of the world&#39;s largest trade publishers, which is apparently happy to pass off the book as a “groundbreaking work of reportage” by dressing it up in the flimsiest fashions of pop feminism.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Whereas the photograph that ran with the essay showed us a nondescript still of tenderness, “Mom Rage” offers close-up footage of unstable moments; of reflexive action and reaction in the exhausting, relentless years of early parenthood; of panic dissolving into rage and shame, yes, but also into fear. “&lt;em>;No.不！ This is&lt;/em>; &lt;em >;NOT&lt;/em>; &lt;em>;happening again!&lt;/em>;,_ _” Dubin thinks as she reads a letter from her son&#39;s preschool teacher informing her that the school is no longer a good fit for him. A similar emotion surfaces when she sends him to camp: “I could feel every inch of my skin prickle as the counselor spoke and the story of Ollie&#39;s behavior unfolded.” She is frightened for her son, who must learn to exist in a world in which his well-being means less to everyone else than it does to her. Every parent can understand this.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;There are scenes scattered throughout “Mom Rage” when Dubin&#39;s gaze widens beyond the mother&#39;s point of view. In one of them, Dubin&#39;s son and daughter have been tussling over the bathroom door, her on one side of it, him on the other. He pushes too hard, and she falls back and hits her head. Dubin is about to bellow but then stops. Instead, she looks closely at her son: “I recognize regret and sadness in his wet, almond eyes, mirror images of mine. I take a slow breath and see that his heart is just like my heart—full of self-punishment. I open my arms to him and say no words at all.” She closes the chapter by describing a piece of scrap paper with two sentences written on it that, for a time, she kept in her purse to remind her of this moment. The first sentence read, “Ollie is a four-year-old boy, and he is good.” The second read, “I am a thirty-five-year-old woman, and I am also good.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The mother and child&#39;s silent embrace is the ideal image of intimacy renewed. It is the closest Dubin comes in the book to the tender mood of the photograph, and it will soften even readers who have hardened to her extravagant performance. And yet it is difficult to accept it as proof of understanding. At such a pivotal moment, one would expect the language of recognition to be slightly more imaginative and precise, not his eyes are “mirror images of mine” or “his heart is just like my heart.” How clearly can a writer see anyone or anything—her children or the social and political contours of motherhood—when she perceives everything through the haze of moral cliché? “&lt;em>;My boy&lt;/em>; &lt;em >;IS&lt;/em>; &lt;em>;good!&lt;/em>; I wanted to scream. &lt;em>;He&#39;s&lt;/em>; &lt;em >;GOOD&lt;/em>;&lt;em>;!” “Please&lt;/em>; &lt;em >;SEE&lt;/em>; &lt;em>;him! See his good self&lt;/em>;,” Dubin pleads. It is wrenching to witness how much she needs others to affirm that both she and her son are good, instead of understanding how they can be good to, or good for, each other. And it is unsettling to realize that she is incapable of seeing him or herself clearly—that careless prose can narrow the terrain on which a person encounters others and interrogates her own desires.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Dubin never relinquishes the language of morality. She cannot; her book has promised universal absolution and universal absolution it must deliver. “&lt;em>;You are a good mom&lt;/em>;,” she assures the reader in the book&#39;s last line. But to liberate parents from shame like this is every bit as moralizing an act as scolding them would be. Both acts situate the writer on a plane of judgment above the reader, reducing the reader to an extension of the writer&#39;s values. The question “How can she be sure that I am a good mother?” can only be answered with another question: “Does she care who I am?” The writer gets to play out a fantasy of the infinitely benevolent mother by casting the reader in the role of the child, desperate for forgiveness. Yet what the reader really seeks from the writer, and what the child seeks from his mother, is not a moral sentence. It is an ethical point of view—the attentiveness and the curiosity borne of the clear-eyed recognition of both self and others. ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;h03fm&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 18 Sep 2023 19:06:01 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“Merrily We Roll Along” Again]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/09/25/merrily-we-roll-along-again]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-18T10:00:00.000Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65039e49fd47431d5e50a7b3/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/230925_r42994illuweb-site.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;article >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attribute-verso-pattern=&quot;article-body&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;ArticlePageChunks&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;“Who wants to live in New York?” the three frenemies in Stephen Sondheim&#39;s “Merrily We Roll Along” wonder. Happily, Maria Friedman does. Friedman, a British singer and actress, is directing a new version of that musical, soon to open on Broadway. “Here, the elevator man has as much right as you do,” she said one day last week, sitting in the café behind the Loeb Boathouse, in Central Park. “Everything is like these quick-witted, fast one-liners.” She snapped her fingers to emphasize her point.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;It was late on a sultry afternoon. The temperature was past ninety, but Friedman, who had just finished nine hours of rehearsal with Daniel Radcliffe (Charley), Jonathan Groff (Franklin), and Lindsay Mendez (Mary) for the mid-September transfer from New York Theatre Workshop (sold out) to the Hudson Theatre (limited run), felt not the humidity but “the aspiration of man” in the New York air. For her, yes, the noise, yes, the dirt, yes, the heat—whoops, a rat! Friedman lifted her feet up and gamely went on with her story.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Her first visit to Manhattan was as a twenty-three-year-old, in 1983. A boyfriend who had a gig as a dancer with Shirley Bassey in the Bahamas sent her a cheap ticket with a stopover in the city. She asked a cop how to get to the Park. “Take a left, a left, then another left,” she recounted. She acted out the joke, doing a New York&#39;s Finest accent.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Her favorite part of Central Park is the Lake. She has rowed there no fewer than twenty-five times, by her count. But, alas, the rehearsal had gone so long that she&#39;d missed her chance on this day. The boats were all locked up, leaving the water to darkness and to—whoops, another rat!&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;This prompted a good show-biz story: Friedman was having dinner in the West End one night. A friend excused himself to use the bathroom and came back to find her standing on a chair. She recalled, “He asked, &#39;Are you singing “Happy Birthday”?&#39; And I was, like, &#39;Maria Friedman is going to stand up and sing because it&#39;s somebody&#39;s birthday? Are you &lt;em>;kidding&lt;/em>; me? Get me out of here!&#39; ” She&#39;d seen a mouse.&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;a data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a27623&amp;quot;}&quot;

She originated the role of Dot in the London production of “Sunday in the Park with George” (Olivier nomination, 1991), did the same six years later with Fosca, in “Passion” (won!), and sang the jealous Mary in “Merrily” along the way. Directing the play made her shift her sympathies to Franklin. Of all the “Merrily”s over the years, Friedman&#39;s is probably the nicest to the character, who is usually portrayed as the kind of spineless wretch that Alan Alda plays. “Here&#39;s the question,” she demanded. “What is wrong with success? Why &lt;em>;wouldn&#39;t&lt;/em>; you want it? Do you &lt;em>;want&lt;/em>; to sit in a garage? They call it selling out. I call it success.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Friedman and Sondheim, who died in 2021, were old, old friends. When did they meet? Friedman doesn&#39;t do dates. “I&#39;m literally the most present person,” she said. “I&#39;m useless. Days go by and I&#39;m in them, whatever.” She first got to know the composer-lyricist when she played Dot in “Sunday.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;A connection blossomed. Sondheim looked out for her. “I got ill once,” Friedman recalls, “and I said, &#39;Look, who knows what&#39;s going to go on?&#39; ” What do you say, old friend? Sondheim agreed to be godparent to one of her children. Friedman even has a rare I-stood-up-Sondheim-and-lived-to-tell-the-tale story, which took place on the very same Lake she was sitting by. She was rowing with an elderly friend, lost track of time, and couldn&#39;t find a cab in the Park. Sondheim loved her and forgave. But what year? “So find out the year Marvin died,” Friedman said. She was in town to sing at his memorial. (Hamlisch, 1944-2012.)&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Merrily” on Broadway, she added, is the NYTW “Merrily” plus “a notebook this full of notes”—fingers spread—that she and the cast never got to address earlier. And a bigger budget. When Franklin walks up the gangplank to sail to Europe, the stairs come out now. “The beat was missing before,” Friedman said. “Now I have the show I wanted to do.” Her next hope isn&#39;t to direct another Sondheim but to sing him again. She has her eye on Mrs. Lovett, in “Sweeney Todd.” She worries that she is going to be too old—Annaleigh Ashford, almost twenty-five years younger than she, is baking the meat pies now on Broadway. But this is New York. “I have a very good Mrs. Lovett in me,” she declared, with moxie. ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;ptzs1s&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;c0lji8&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 18 Sep 2023 19:06:01 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Diana Ejaita’s “Lines of Beauty”]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cover-story/cover-story-2023-09-25]]><description>&lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-18T10:00:00.000Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6504ce88f91140847d576236/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/cover-story-promo-ejaita_promo.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;article >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attribute-verso-pattern=&quot;article-body&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;ArticlePageChunks&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p>;The cover of this year&#39;s Fall Style &amp;amp; Design issue showcases the work of Diana Ejaita, an artist who has herself dabbled in the world of fashion. When we published her &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cover-story/cover-story-2019-05-13&quot;>;first cover&lt;/a>; for the magazine, four years ago, she had just launched a line of clothing inspired by her heritage, a mix of Nigerian and Italian roots. Now Ejaita is a young mother—her daughter, Mathilda, was born nearly two years ago—and a recognized artist who has been the artist-in-residence at Florence&#39;s Villa Romana for the past few months. In her cover for the September 25, 2023, issue, Ejaita continues to trace a distinctive path, blending classic shapes and techniques of Western and African art traditions, fusing the old and the new. I talked to the artist about Florence, family life, and multidimensional living.&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;What has the artist residency in Florence been like?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I have enjoyed being in Florence so far. It&#39;s my first time back in Italy after seventeen years away. I am especially trying to use this time to get back into practices I had set aside in the recent past, such as working with clay and trying to put the subjects of my drawings into tri-dimension. I have also had the chance to get back to printing techniques such as etching. Il Bisonte, a very old printing laboratory, invited us to visit and practice with them; the last time I worked with the medium was more than thirteen years ago. I&#39;m trying to un-digitalize my practice and myself—and to go back to more organic ways of creating art.&lt;/p>;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;feature-default&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;image&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:feature-default&quot;>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;Clay vases and a print in Diana Ejaita&amp;#x27;s studio.&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6504a76adca176b6672dc12b/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/ejaita_studio_2.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6504a76adca176b6672dc12b/master/w_120,c_limit/ejaita_studio_2.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6504a76adca176b6672dc12b/master/w_240,c_limit/ejaita_studio_2.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6504a76adca176b6672dc12b/master/w_320,c_limit/ejaita_studio_2.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6504a76adca176b6672dc12b/master/w_640,c_limit/ejaita_studio_2.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6504a76adca176b6672dc12b/master/w_960,c_limit/ejaita_studio_2.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6504a76adca176b6672dc12b/master/w_1280,c_limit/ejaita_studio_2.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6504a76adca176b6672dc12b/master/w_1600,c_limit/ejaita_studio_2.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;Some of Ejaita&#39;s recent clay sculptures and prints.&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/inline-embed>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;You&#39;re also opening your own artist&#39;s space in Lagos, Nigeria.

Do you let her in the studio when you work?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;This is a question I ask myself, too: When will I be ready to share the studio with Mathilda? At the moment, she is too young, and I guess the studio time is my time right now. I hope that, when she&#39;s older, we will be able to share more creative time together.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;Growing up, did you always know that you would be an artist?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I think so. I have always been on the creative side, and I naturally followed the path I was supposed to walk through.

>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;In July, 1918, Virginia Woolf spent a weekend at Garsington—a country home, outside Oxford, owned by Lady Ottoline Morrell, a celebrated hostess of the era, and her husband, Philip Morrell, a Member of Parliament. The house, a ramshackle Jacobean mansion that the Morrells had acquired five years earlier, had been vividly redecorated by Ottoline into what one guest called a “fluttering parrot-house of greens, reds and yellows.” One sitting room was painted with a translucent seafoam wash; another was covered in deep Venetian red, and early visitors were invited to apply thin lines of gold paint to the edges of wooden panels. The entrance hall was laid with Persian carpets and, as Morrell&#39;s biographer Miranda Seymour has written, the pearly gray paint on the walls was streaked with pink, “to create the effect of a winter sunset.” Woolf, in her diary, noted that the Italianate garden fashioned by Morrell—with paved terraces, brilliantly colored flower beds, and a pond surrounded by yew-tree hedges clipped with niches for statuary—was “almost melodramatically perfect.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Woolf characterized Morrell herself with a note of satire, observing that her conversational “drift is always almost bewilderingly meandering.” While on an afternoon walk, Morrell had leaned on a parasol and offered a discourse on love—“Isn&#39;t it sad that no one &lt;em>;really&lt;/em>; falls in love nowadays?”—before declaring her dedication to the natural world and to literature. “We asked the poor old ninny why, with this passion for literature, she didn&#39;t write,” Woolf wrote. Morrell replied, “Ah, but I&#39;ve no time—never any time. Besides, I have such wretched health—But the pleasure of creation, Virginia, must transcend all others.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Morrell, who was born in 1873, just nine years before Woolf—hardly an old-ninny interval—may not have written novels, but she certainly took pleasure in creation. As if to accompany her lush décor, she cultivated an extravagant persona, especially through her clothing. Her contemporaries found the performance at once irresistible and risible. The poet and writer Siegfried Sassoon, visiting Garsington in 1916, remarked on Morrell&#39;s “voluminous pale-pink Turkish trousers.” Desmond MacCarthy, the British critic, described one of Morrell&#39;s hats as being “like a crimson tea cosy trimmed with hedgehogs.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Morrell is one of the most chronicled and caricatured figures connected with the Bloomsbury group, the association of writers, artists, and thinkers who, in the early twentieth century, shared living spaces in a district of London known for its leafy squares, and whose intellectual and erotic paths intertwined well after those residential arrangements ended. Lytton Strachey, the critic, who was a frequent guest of Morrell&#39;s, said that she was, like Garsington itself, “very impressive, patched, gilded and preposterous.” According to the artist Vanessa Bell, Woolf&#39;s sister, Morrell had “a terrifically energetic and vigorous character with a definite rather bad taste.” D. H. Lawrence—not himself a part of the Bloomsbury group, but well acquainted with its members—drew on Morrell in his characterization of Hermione Roddice, the aloof, domineering heiress in “Women in Love.” (“People were silent when she passed, impressed, roused, wanting to jeer, yet for some reason silenced.”) Morrell, who kept a diary, declared in one entry that “conventionality is deadness,” but she was conventional enough to be hurt by her friends&#39; sniping. Lawrence&#39;s portrait extinguished their friendship.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;GenericCallout&quot;>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;Morrell turned Garsington—her country home outside Oxford—into what one guest called a “fluttering parrothouse of greens...&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65036f2266325fdeb35658aa/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/230925_r42997_rd.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65036f2266325fdeb35658aa/master/w_120,c_limit/230925_r42997_rd.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65036f2266325fdeb35658aa/master/w_240,c_limit/230925_r42997_rd.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65036f2266325fdeb35658aa/master/w_320,c_limit/230925_r42997_rd.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65036f2266325fdeb35658aa/master/w_640,c_limit/230925_r42997_rd.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65036f2266325fdeb35658aa/master/w_960,c_limit/230925_r42997_rd.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65036f2266325fdeb35658aa/master/w_1280,c_limit/230925_r42997_rd.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65036f2266325fdeb35658aa/master/w_1600,c_limit/230925_r42997_rd.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;Morrell turned Garsington&amp;#8212;her country home, outside Oxford&amp;#8212;into what one guest called a “fluttering parrot-house of greens, reds and yellows.”&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Photograph © National Portrait Gallery, London&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Lady Ottoline&#39;s marriage to Philip, which began in 1902, combined observance of convention with its subversion. The Morrells had two children—a daughter, Julian, and her twin brother, Hugh, who died soon after birth—and remained together until Ottoline&#39;s death, in 1938. But both had numerous external relationships. Around the time of Virginia Woolf&#39;s visit to Garsington, Philip fathered two children outside his marriage, one with his secretary and another with his wife&#39;s former maid. Ottoline, meanwhile, was engaged in a long-term affair with the philosopher Bertrand Russell. Another of Ottoline&#39;s lovers had been Augustus John, the artist, whose painting of her, made in 1919, today hangs in the National Portrait Gallery in London. Ottoline, who was six feet tall even before putting on the scarlet high heels she favored, is dressed in a black velvet gown with enormous puffed sleeves and a square neckline edged with lace, and wears atop her massed auburn curls a gargantuan black hat. She lifts her chin and looks sidelong down her nose, the regard in her deep-set eyes striking a precarious balance between imperiousness and insecurity.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;One morning this past July, Sarah Glenn, a textile conservator based in London, eased a protective sheath off a tailor&#39;s dummy in her studio, in the Battersea district, to reveal a dress belonging to the collection of the Fashion Museum in Bath. The black velvet evening gown, which had a square neck edged with lace, puffed sleeves, and a fishtail skirt, had once belonged to Lady Ottoline. It may not have been the exact one she wore while sitting for Augustus John; Morrell had loved the style so much that she had owned repeat models over the years. Exposed on either side of the rib cage was a pair of heavy-duty zippers—an innovation introduced to dressmaking during the Jazz Age. The tubular sleeve was so narrow that Morrell must have found it challenging to bend her elbows. At the upper arm, the sleeve burst into a voluptuous puff, which would have made Morrell&#39;s shoulders appear as broad as a rugby player&#39;s. With a silhouette that offered exaggerated nods to both femininity and masculinity, the dress was less clothing than costume; its gender ambiguities brought to mind Rei Kawakubo&#39;s archly stylized designs for Comme des Garçons, with their distorted shoulders and hips. The gown, probably fabricated by Morrell&#39;s longtime dressmaker, was a bold expression of Morrell&#39;s creativity, with herself as the medium.&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot;

(The title quotes an instruction that Virginia Woolf gave to T. S. Eliot in 1920 before he joined her for a weekend in the country—she was encouraging him to leave constrictive finery behind.) The show, curated by Charlie Porter, a fashion journalist and the author of “What Artists Wear,” is being held in Lewes, a town in East Sussex, at a new gallery run by the Charleston Trust, which also owns the seventeenth-century farmhouse, seven miles outside town, that was once the home of Vanessa Bell and her sometime partner Duncan Grant, the artist. Bell was in what amounted to an open marriage with the art critic Clive Bell, and took up residence with Grant during the First World War, when Grant, a conscientious objector, needed to find farmwork, an approved alternative to fighting. Though Grant generally slept with men—among them the writer David Garnett and the economist John Maynard Keynes, both of whom spent many nights at Charleston—he and Vanessa Bell had a child together, Angelica, who was born at the farmhouse. (Angelica later added a further tangle to these arrangements by marrying Garnett.) Vanessa Bell died in 1961, and Grant continued to live at Charleston until his death, in 1978. The house subsequently became a museum. It stands next to a working farm, complete with the evocative smell of the barnyard.&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;During Bell and Grant&#39;s tenure, the house was idiosyncratically decorated by its inhabitants, in a joyful blurring of the boundary between art and life. The walls, the furnishings, the mantels, the woodwork, and even the sides of a bathtub were riotously painted with floral and geometrical patterns, still-lifes, and sturdy nudes. The shared spaces and the bedrooms were occupied by spouses, lovers, and friends, among whom habits of Edwardian decorum were happily discarded. Virginia Woolf, for one, was married to the scholar and editor Leonard Woolf, but she had romantic relationships with women, most notably the writer and garden designer Vita Sackville-West.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;GenericCallout&quot;>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;Virginia Woolf and her niece Angelica in 1932.&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65035f05fd47431d5e50a6a9/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/230925_r42998.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65035f05fd47431d5e50a6a9/master/w_120,c_limit/230925_r42998.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65035f05fd47431d5e50a6a9/master/w_240,c_limit/230925_r42998.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65035f05fd47431d5e50a6a9/master/w_320,c_limit/230925_r42998.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65035f05fd47431d5e50a6a9/master/w_640,c_limit/230925_r42998.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65035f05fd47431d5e50a6a9/master/w_960,c_limit/230925_r42998.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65035f05fd47431d5e50a6a9/master/w_1280,c_limit/230925_r42998.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65035f05fd47431d5e50a6a9/master/w_1600,c_limit/230925_r42998.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;Virginia Woolf and her niece Angelica, in 1932.&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Photograph © Peter Lofts Photography / National Portrait Gallery, London&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;In recent years, a new space has been added to the Charleston site, offering temporary exhibitions of contemporary artists working in the spirit of Charleston&#39;s earlier occupants. (An upcoming show centers on intimate drawings by David Hockney of friends and lovers in domestic settings.) Under its current director, Nathaniel Hepburn, who took over in 2017, Charleston has embraced more fully its heritage as a site of radical politics and personal self-invention—or, as Hepburn told me, “a place where people came to imagine how life might be lived differently.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;The new gallery in Lewes, in a former office building, is an extension of this mission. “Bring No Clothes” emulates Charleston&#39;s mode of casual ornamentation: there are no fastidiously reconstructed interiors with mannequins posed on chairs. Instead, the show wittily throws together a wide range of objects, both historical and contemporary. In a section devoted to Bloomsbury&#39;s affinity for handcrafts, a series of portraits of Vanessa Bell is shown alongside a multicolored rag rug fashioned from her worn-out clothing—an artifact recovered from the drafty floors at Charleston. A copy of “Orlando,” Virginia Woolf&#39;s 1928 novel about a gender-switching aristocrat, inscribed to Sackville-West—the inspiration for the story—is displayed, as are three costumes that Kawakubo designed for a 2019 operatic adaptation of the book, by the composer Olga Neuwirth.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Porter has also included items from contemporary artists and designers who share a kinship with the group. These include Jawara Alleyne, a Jamaican-born designer whose use of safety pins to fasten slashed fabric echoes the handmade aesthetic of Charleston, and Ella Boucht, a young London-based designer who creates tailored clothes and leather garments that celebrate butch identity. Among other things, the exhibition makes a strong case that the Bloomsbury group&#39;s approach to resisting social norms—playful, exploratory, ever-shifting—set the stage for current notions of gender and sexual fluidity. Clothing was never the focus of the group, but, as Porter&#39;s exhibit text notes, “fashion provided a language with which to explore their break away from tradition.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Few garments that belonged to the key members of the Bloomsbury group have survived. Scholars have written about the significance of gloves in the novels of Virginia Woolf; in an early iteration of “Mrs. Dalloway,” “Mrs. Dalloway in Bond Street,” it is gloves rather than flowers that Clarissa Dalloway says that she will buy herself in the first line. But none of the gloves that Woolf wore in her lifetime are thought to exist today. The only piece of Woolf&#39;s clothing known to have survived is a black Chinese-silk shawl decorated with green foliage and salmon-colored flowers and birds. It was a gift from the generous Lady Ottoline Morrell.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;How Woolf, Bell, and others dressed, and how they thought about what they wore, has been preserved principally in their texts, photographs, and art works. On display in Lewes is the diary of Grace Higgens, who served as a housekeeper for Vanessa Bell and Duncan Grant at Charleston, which reveals with clarity what happened to Bell&#39;s clothing after her death: “Had a bonfire &amp;amp; burnt Mrs Bells mattress &amp;amp; lots of her clothes, &amp;amp; pillows.” Porter told me, “It confirms the absolute absence of sentimentality about clothes. From this, you can kind of presume what happened to Virginia Woolf&#39;s clothes. There would have been no sense of holding on to things.”&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;a data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a28061&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a28061&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;“But realistically Finance.”&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/65035efa1c0c59ca5ffb3211/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/230925_a28061.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/65035efa1c0c59ca5ffb3211/master/w_120,c_limit/230925_a28061.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/65035efa1c0c59ca5ffb3211/master/w_240,c_limit/230925_a28061.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/65035efa1c0c59ca5ffb3211/master/w_320,c_limit/230925_a28061.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/65035efa1c0c59ca5ffb3211/master/w_640,c_limit/230925_a28061.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/65035efa1c0c59ca5ffb3211/master/w_960,c_limit/230925_a28061.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/65035efa1c0c59ca5ffb3211/master/w_1280,c_limit/230925_a28061.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/65035efa1c0c59ca5ffb3211/master/w_1600,c_limit/230925_a28061.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/a>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;“But realistically?

S. Eliot to “bring no clothes” for a visit to the country, she added, by way of explication, “We live in a state of the greatest simplicity.” In conventional society of the time, hosts and guests at a country house would change their clothes several times a day, culminating in a formal outfit for dinner. Woolf may have dispensed with such rules, but she was hardly free of anxiety about clothing. Her journals are filled with comments about the inadequacies of her wardrobe. On multiple occasions, she decries herself as badly dressed (a verdict sometimes endorsed by other members of her circle). In 1915, Woolf considers attending a party, reminding herself that she will “see beautiful people, &amp;amp; get a sensation of being on the highest crest of the biggest wave,” then decides against it. “There is vanity,” she writes. “I have no clothes to go in.”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;pdjuxh&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Judging by photographs taken at Garsington and elsewhere, Woolf appears to have settled at a young age on an aesthetic—long, lean lines, with little trussing at the waist or fussing at the neckline—that rejects some of the strictures of dress placed on women in the first decades of the twentieth century. But, if Woolf was careless of certain Edwardian forms of sartorial constraint, she was mindful of others: “It seems to me quite impossible to wear trousers,” she wrote in a 1917 letter, observing the bolder choices of others, such as the artist Dora Carrington—who preferred to be called by only her last name. Carrington wore corduroy trousers and jodhpurs, and styled her hair in a short, blunt bob that threatened to obscure her face. Porter has found a snapshot of Woolf reclining outdoors on a chaise longue during a vacation in Devon, dressed in what she would have meant by “no clothes”: a loose sweater and a calf-length skirt revealing stockings and leather pumps.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;If Woolf found self-expression through dressing down, she was also aware of the pleasure and the power offered by dressing up. In April, 1925, just before the publication of “Mrs. Dalloway,” Woolf wrote in her diary of the happiness of commissioning a new garment: “Going to my dressmaker in Judd Street, or rather thinking of a dress I could get her to make, &amp;amp; imagining it made—that is the string, which as if it dipped loosely into a wave of treasure brings up pearls sticking to it.” A few days later, she expressed a desire to explore “the party consciousness, the frock consciousness, &amp;amp;c.”—her now celebrated coinage for the ways an individual&#39;s sense of self can be altered by what she puts on her body. Her reflections were prompted by a visit, earlier that day, to a studio in the Marylebone district of London, where she sat for Maurice Adams Beck and Helen MacGregor, the chief photographers of British &lt;em>;Vogue&lt;/em>;. In the resulting portrait, she sits in a dark dress, one hand sheathed in a pale glove, with its mate resting on her lap. The experience had given her occasion to consider the exclusionary function of the fashion system, “where people secrete an envelope which connects them &amp;amp; protects them from others, like myself, who am outside the envelope, foreign bodies.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In addition to being formally photographed by professionals, Woolf and her circle were captured in casual snapshots. Porter has rummaged through Bloomsbury albums for images, and among his finds are photographs of Grant and others shirtless, semi-clothed, or naked—a freedom permitted by the privacy of the enclosed gardens at properties such as Charleston and Garsington. (One can presumably still streak at Garsington, which remains a private home.) Lady Ottoline Morrell frequently brandished a camera, capturing her guests in moments of relaxed deshabille, or in bohemian tea-party ensembles. She pasted the photographs into albums and often gave copies of the images to the subjects; many of them are now in the collection of the National Portrait Gallery.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;feature-large-callout&quot; >;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;A group of writers and artists in the walled garden at Charleston.&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65035f4b25274af116db7fed/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/230925_r42999.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65035f4b25274af116db7fed/master/w_120,c_limit/230925_r42999.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65035f4b25274af116db7fed/master/w_240,c_limit/230925_r42999.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65035f4b25274af116db7fed/master/w_320,c_limit/230925_r42999.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65035f4b25274af116db7fed/master/w_640,c_limit/230925_r42999.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65035f4b25274af116db7fed/master/w_960,c_limit/230925_r42999.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65035f4b25274af116db7fed/master/w_1280,c_limit/230925_r42999.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65035f4b25274af116db7fed/master/w_1600,c_limit/230925_r42999.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;A 1928 snapshot, by Vanessa Bell, of writers and artists in the walled garden at Charleston, the Sussex farmhouse that became a retreat for the Bloomsbury group.

(In a 1911 Duncan Grant portrait of Woolf, her sitting figure is surrounded by Fauvist swaths of orange and green, but her dress is rendered in black.) A photograph from 1923 shows Woolf seated on a garden bench at Garsington, smoking a cigarette and wearing a long, unstructured pin-tucked dress, a lace shawl, and a broad-brimmed hat trimmed with pale feathers. One can only guess at the combination of colors and tones. The written record, at least, suggests that Woolf&#39;s palette could be vivid. Sackville-West, whom Woolf met in the early nineteen-twenties, remarked in 1922 that Woolf was dressed more smartly than she had last seen her: “That is to say, the woolen orange stockings were replaced by yellow silk ones, but she still wore pumps.” Porter has observed, aptly, that the description “sounds like a styling decision taken today backstage at Prada.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Similarly, Porter unearths accounts by Woolf and others that reveal what surviving photographs obscure. In a 1916 letter from Woolf to Bell, the outfit of their sister-in-law Karin Stephen, designed by Bell, is described sardonically as “a skirt barred with reds and yellows of the vilest kind, a peagreen blouse on top, with a gaudy handkerchief on her head.” Woolf jokes, “I shall retire into dove colour and old lavender, with a lace collar and lawn wristlets”—the Edwardian colors and styles that the sisters had clearly left behind.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;It is an accident of fate—and of class—that Lady Ottoline Morrell&#39;s clothes were preserved by her descendants after her death. Her wardrobe offers a rare sample of the material texture of Bloomsbury, and the inventive ways in which its members sought to fashion themselves anew. At the exhibition, Morrell&#39;s garments have been lined up like runway models at the end of a contemporary designer&#39;s show. “Morrell spoke in her journal of how her preferred look was long and plain—she &lt;em>;thinks&lt;/em>; her look is very simple,” Porter said. “But it seems to me that she is responding to her own features and exaggerating things because of the way she looked herself, rather than trying to hide anything.” Given Morrell&#39;s height, hair, and hauteur, she was well aware that she looked striking and odd. Indeed, her appearance qualified as what she and her contemporaries would have called “queer”—that is, peculiar. In “Women in Love,” Hermione Roddice is described as “waving her head up and down, and waving her hand slowly in dismissal, smiling a strange affected smile, making a tall queer, frightening figure.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Alongside the “Bring No Clothes” exhibition, Porter has published a book that shares the title. In both, he aims to demonstrate how people in the Bloomsbury circle used clothing, fashion, and the rejection of fashion to liberate themselves in a way that presages the modern usage of “queer” as an umbrella term for “not straight.” “I describe myself as &#39;queer&#39; rather than &#39;gay,&#39; even though I am a gay male,” Porter writes. “The word is specific enough to have meaning, broad enough to give all queer humans the space to be themselves.”&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot;

Porter writes that, if Woolf were alive today, “we might imagine her identifying as non-binary or trans.” At the same time, he acknowledges that it is anachronistic to re-gender people who lived a century ago. What Woolf writes of the Elizabethans in “Orlando”—“Their morals were not ours; nor their poets; nor their climate; nor their vegetables even”—is equally true today of our distance from the Bloomsbury era.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Porter&#39;s most novel contribution to Bloomsbury scholarship is to look at the group&#39;s artifacts from the vantage of contemporary queer culture. He offers an analysis of a portrait painted by Duncan Grant of his friend Harry Daley, a policeman who had a long affair with the Bloomsbury-group associate E. M. Forster. Daley, unusually for the time, was relatively open about being gay—protected from the legal prohibition on homosexuality by his position in law enforcement. Porter, writing about Daley&#39;s snug police uniform, which is garlanded with chains and buckles, notes, “Daley is entirely covered, but to queer eyes the coded language of the garments tells a different story. 。 。 。 It speaks of fantasies in which a policeman forces a suspect to submit, or conversely, a suspect gets the upper hand.” In the book “Bring No Clothes,” Porter gives what stands for a credo: “The queer members of the Bloomsbury group had to navigate prohibitive societal norms to find ways to exist. By looking at their clothing, these strategies for living come to the fore. It can make us realize that, even today, we all live by such codes, as much as we believe that we are free.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Just as Vanessa Bell painted her wardrobe and her fireplace with highly personal designs, she made her own clothes, sometimes from textiles that she had created. These garments were proudly unfussy, with ragged hems, and at least some of them were colorful. In a 1915 letter, Bell told Grant she was making a dress that “will be mostly purple,” adding, “I&#39;m going to make myself a bright green blouse or coat.” Grant, for his part, improvised turbans out of lengths of cloth, and mixed styles with dashing ease: Woolf wrote that, at Charleston, Grant could be found “incredibly wrapped round with yellow waistcoats, spotted ties, &amp;amp; old blue stained painting jackets.” The DIY aesthetic of Charleston has inspired Porter to explore making his own clothes. The first time I met him, he wore a pair of lightweight pants with a ribbed elastic waistband, like maternity wear, and a shirt fashioned from two panels of cotton in different patterns and of different lengths, so that the front was shorter than the back. In “Bring No Clothes,” he writes, “Spending this time with the Bloomsbury group has pushed my thinking about garments wide open.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The mishmashed Bloomsbury aesthetic continues to inspire. For many interior designers, the painterly clutter of Charleston offers an alternative path after decades of white walls and sleek industrial furnishings. At the bar of the Beaverbrook Town House, a new hotel in the Chelsea district of London, teal tiles and maroon glass clash delightfully with crowded shelves of ornately patterned pottery. English designers such as Tess Newall and Jermaine Gallacher have made a specialty of applying whimsical designs directly to walls. &lt;em>;Architectural Digest&lt;/em>;, which recently declared that the “irreverent chic” of the Bloomsbury group “is making a comeback,” quoted Gallacher as saying that, whenever he designs a space, he tries “to include a cheeky mural or hand-painted surface.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Today&#39;s fashion runways are full of the kind of gender play favored by the Bloomsbury set. The fall/winter, 2023, collection of Prada prominently features ties for women; Armani, meanwhile, is offering patterned shawls for men. The kind of brightly colored stockings that Woolf favored are back in style, too. For some contemporary fashion designers, Bloomsbury is a central point of reference. Among them is the British Turkish designer Erdem Moralioglu, whose spring, 2022, collection was inspired both by Lady Ottoline Morrell&#39;s clothes and by Dame Edith Sitwell, a Bloomsbury satellite whom Woolf described, upon first meeting her, as “a very tall young woman, wearing a permanently startled expression, &amp;amp; curiously finished off with a high green silk headdress.” Moralioglu told me that he finds the Bloomsbury era “such an interesting, progressive time,” adding, “The fluidity between relationships was fascinating.” His collection included slim floral dresses with flared skirts that hit mid-calf, broad-brimmed hats, and sensible brogues of the sort in which one might comfortably climb a country hillside, lean on a parasol, and announce one&#39;s dedication to the natural world and to literature. The runway show took place in Bloomsbury, at the British Museum, laid out beneath that institution&#39;s neoclassical colonnade, so that the models were quite literally following in the footsteps of their historical antecedents.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;0nuoax&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Perhaps the fashion industry&#39;s most prominent Bloomsbury aficionado is Kim Jones, the artistic director of Fendi womenswear and Dior menswear. Jones, who is forty-four, spent time in Lewes growing up, and first visited Charleston on a school trip when he was in his teens. “It struck a chord with me—the way that these people lived exactly how they wanted to live,” Jones told me. “It was almost like punk. They really shook off the semblance of Victoriana they grew up with.” In recent years, Jones&#39;s success as a designer and a fashion executive has given him the resources to amass an enormous library of manuscripts, letters, paintings, and objects related to the Bloomsbury group. Among the letters is a 1923 note that Virginia Woolf sent to T. S. Eliot, in his capacity as editor of the &lt;em>;Criterion&lt;/em>;, offering him “Mrs. Dalloway in Bond Street” for publication. (Eliot declined.)&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;When Jones was creating his spring, 2023, collection for Dior Men, he immersed himself in the life and aesthetic of Duncan Grant. The resulting collection offered baggy, flapping raincoats, chunky shoes, and shorts paired with thick socks—a fantasia on the kinds of garment Grant wore to dash from the painting studio to the walled garden at Charleston. Several items from the Dior collection are on display in Lewes, alongside the images and works of Grant that helped inspire them. A hand-knitted sweater bears a design, featuring two female nudes, that Grant made for a curtain at a London theatre; a zip-up jacket features a lily-pond-like pattern that Grant painted on a table for the bedroom at Charleston used by John Maynard Keynes.&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;Dora Carrington climbing naked upon a muscular statue of a male figure.&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65035f0de8cb5056481b2875/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/230925_r43000.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65035f0de8cb5056481b2875/master/w_120,c_limit/230925_r43000.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65035f0de8cb5056481b2875/master/w_240,c_limit/230925_r43000.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65035f0de8cb5056481b2875/master/w_320,c_limit/230925_r43000.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65035f0de8cb5056481b2875/master/w_640,c_limit/230925_r43000.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65035f0de8cb5056481b2875/master/w_960,c_limit/230925_r43000.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65035f0de8cb5056481b2875/master/w_1280,c_limit/230925_r43000.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65035f0de8cb5056481b2875/master/w_1600,c_limit/230925_r43000.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;At Garsington, in 1917, Morrell photographed the artist Dora Carrington climbing naked upon a muscular statue of a male figure.&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Photograph © National Portrait Gallery, London&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;p >;Jones&#39;s Bloomsbury collection will eventually be bequeathed to Charleston, and he has acquired a defunct elementary school in Sussex which is to become a scholarly repository for books and manuscripts and other objects. For the moment, though, he lives with the collection in his homes, in Sussex and in London. In Sussex, Jones has hung up two male nudes by Grant, whose private erotic drawings of men were the focus of an exhibition at Charleston last year. In London, a spacious and elegant lavender-colored living room displays six Bloomsbury-era paintings along a single wall, among them a Post-Impressionist portrait by Grant of Vanessa Bell wearing an orange dress trimmed with green, with a yellow shawl over her head. The work was bought at auction in London last year for more than three hundred thousand pounds—a record high for Grant. Jones is lending it to the “Bring No Clothes” show, along with a number of other treasures, including the copy of “Orlando” inscribed to Sackville-West, which he bought a few years ago. Jones owns eleven copies of the novel, nine of them inscribed by the author to different members of the Bloomsbury group. “The book is more relevant now than it was when it came out, just shy of a hundred years ago,” Jones told me. “And it will probably speak even more to the generation a hundred years from now.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“What a pity one can&#39;t now and then change sexes!” Lytton Strachey once wrote to Clive Bell, adding, “I should love to be a dowager Countess.” To Strachey, Morrell once declared that she wished she were a man, “for then we should get on so wonderfully.” As Strachey&#39;s biographer Michael Holroyd has observed, the two often &lt;em>;did&lt;/em>; get on wonderfully, neither of them conforming to the prevailing expectations of masculinity and femininity. When Strachey came to stay at Garsington, he and Lady Ottoline enjoyed dipping into her wardrobe, treating its contents like a box of costumes. Morrell wrote of one visit, “At night Lytton would become gay and we would laugh and giggle and be foolish; sometimes he would put on a pair of my smart high-heeled shoes, which made him look like an Aubrey Beardsley drawing, very wicked.” (Beardsley, a contemporary of Morrell&#39;s, was known for his erotic and disturbing pen-and-ink drawings, including illustrations of Oscar Wilde&#39;s play “Salomé.”) Morrell wrote of Strachey, “I love to see him in my memory tottering and pirouetting round the room with feet looking so absurdly small, peeping in and out of his trousers, both of us so excited and happy, getting more and more fantastic and gay.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In the “Bring No Clothes” book, Porter peers into the sometimes transparent, sometimes occluded queerness of several Bloomsbury figures. In a chapter on Keynes, who famously had a prodigious count of lovers, Porter turns his queer eye to the photographic record. He notes Keynes&#39;s dominant stance when captured in conversation with his sometime partner Grant—left hand shoved into his pants pocket, pelvis tilted forward, shoulders back. “Keynes&#39;s pose breaks with the respectfulness of the tailored suit,” Porter writes. “It says, I want more now. It also says, I claim power.” Porter finds another image of the pair taken a few years later to have similar body language: Keynes has his hands on his clearly irrepressible hips. Elsewhere, Porter writes with subtlety about Carrington&#39;s efforts to find language for an identity that today might be categorized as nonbinary. In a 1925 letter rejecting a former lover, Gerald Brenan, Carrington tells him, “You know I have always hated being a woman. 。 。 。 I am continually depressed by my effeminacy.” Writing elsewhere of an affair with the American journalist Henrietta Bingham, Carrington confesses to having “a day-dream” of “not being female.” Porter&#39;s book illuminates the ways in which gender norms, no less than norms of sexual orientation, were up for grabs among the Bloomsbury set, even while certain social conventions, including marriage, were observed. (Both Keynes and Carrington married partners of the opposite sex; Strachey was unusual in Bloomsbury circles for never marrying.)&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Despite the assertion of Miranda Seymour, Morrell&#39;s most recent biographer, that “lesbianism played no part in Ottoline&#39;s life”—a judgment that echoes that of an earlier biographer, Sandra Jobson Darroch—Porter believes that there is ample reason to count Morrell among the queer women of Bloomsbury. In a well-known sequence of photographs taken in the gardens at Garsington in the summer of 1917, Carrington, then in her early twenties, climbs naked upon a muscular statue of a male figure, against whom her own athleticism is counterposed. Porter points out that Morrell was holding the camera. He includes a photograph of Morrell lying naked alongside a row of shrubs at Garsington, a trail of discarded clothes behind her. Morrell, twenty years Carrington&#39;s senior, is lithe-limbed, with the slack belly of a woman who has borne children. The photographer is unknown, but Porter suggests that Morrell and Carrington exchanged the camera as they robed and disrobed.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Porter also advances a theory that Morrell and Virginia Woolf may have fleetingly been lovers. He cites, among other suggestive evidence, a remark in a letter to Vanessa Bell from Roger Fry, an art critic in the Bloomsbury group, that Morrell and Woolf “have fallen into each other&#39;s arms.” At the very least, Porter argues, it makes sense to consider Woolf and Morrell as “queer comrades.” In an inspired bit of sleuthing, Porter considers a photograph of Woolf shot for &lt;em>;Vogue&lt;/em>; in 1924, a year before the celebrated glove-holding portrait. Woolf is shown wearing a dress that is usually described as having belonged to her mother, Julia Stephen. Porter is skeptical: the dress&#39;s style, he shows, does not resemble any garments known to have been worn by Stephen, who was much photographed, being a great beauty. Instead, Porter hazards, the dress, with its dramatically puffed sleeves and its low, lace-edged neckline, which gapes around Woolf&#39;s slender collarbone as if it were several sizes too big for her, may have been loaned to the novelist by her friend Morrell: a token of affection, and perhaps more, passed between them.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;As Morrell&#39;s wardrobe was being studied, the garments betrayed other details about the Bloomsbury group and their friends, enemies, and supporters—scraps of their lives that have escaped the bonfire of time. When curators at the Fashion Museum in Bath peeked into the pockets of a pair of high-waisted, balloon-legged pants made from soft, indigo-colored cotton velvet, they found remnants of Ottoline&#39;s cigarettes, perhaps left over from a walk in the countryside around Garsington.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Also on display in Lewes is a long black velvet tunic, embroidered with gold thread in geometric patterns, in a knockoff of a style popularized by the Spanish couturier Fortuny. Morrell may have been an aristocrat, but she was not as wealthy as she looked—financial pressures eventually forced her and Philip to sell Garsington—and she preferred to have her clothes made locally, rather than in the ateliers of Europe. Stitching irregularities suggest that the tunic was made by Morrell&#39;s own dressmaker. The inside of the neckline is stained with an oily residue, probably from makeup. It looks like the dirty collar of a five-year-old who has hurriedly used her T-shirt to wipe her mouth—and therefore suggests the careless vivacity of the wearer, as an evening with friends grew more and more fantastic and gay.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;feature-large-callout&quot; >;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;The interior of Charleston with furnishings and artwork on display.&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65035f10f7614bb9cc793d73/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/230925_r43001.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65035f10f7614bb9cc793d73/master/w_120,c_limit/230925_r43001.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65035f10f7614bb9cc793d73/master/w_240,c_limit/230925_r43001.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65035f10f7614bb9cc793d73/master/w_320,c_limit/230925_r43001.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65035f10f7614bb9cc793d73/master/w_640,c_limit/230925_r43001.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65035f10f7614bb9cc793d73/master/w_960,c_limit/230925_r43001.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65035f10f7614bb9cc793d73/master/w_1280,c_limit/230925_r43001.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65035f10f7614bb9cc793d73/master/w_1600,c_limit/230925_r43001.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;At Charleston, which is now open to the public, the walls, the furnishings, the mantels, the woodwork, and even the sides of a bathtub were riotously painted with floral and geometrical patterns, still-lifes, and sturdy nudes.&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Photograph by Jon Santa Cruz&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Shortly before “Bring No Clothes” was installed in Lewes, Porter made a discovery about another Morrell garment that he&#39;d selected for the show, a gauzy tunic of undyed linen, edged with ceramic beads. The front is patterned with eight repeating floral motifs outlined in dull green; some of the petals are colored in pale pink and blue. Porter researched the Fortuny archives and found that this garment was in fact genuine, except for one inauthentic detail: on the original, the floral pattern was printed without color.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;8ts9x&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Like Morrell&#39;s puffed-sleeve velvet gown, the tunic had gone to the conservation studio in Battersea. When it was withdrawn from its tissue-lined box and carefully laid out on a worktable, Porter recalled something that he had been told earlier by a costume researcher named Gill MacGregor: the pink and blue on the fabric wasn&#39;t evenly distributed. Unlike the green outlines, the petals seemed to have been colored in by hand. The tunic had been modified, embellished to suit the inclinations of Morrell, who—like so many of her guests, and friends, and lovers—saw no reason to adhere to the prescribed tastes of the time, in matters sartorial or otherwise.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;It was impossible to say who had been responsible for the alteration. Most likely, the handiwork—like the irregular stitching elsewhere on Morrell&#39;s clothes—was that of her dressmaker. But wasn&#39;t it possible to imagine Morrell taking up a paintbrush on her own, just like the artists with whom she surrounded herself? Among the objects that survive her are several sewing boxes, filled with brightly colored thread. “She could make dresses herself—she talks about making dresses as a child,” Porter said. Even if there was no telltale paintbrush among the needles and bobbins, it was nonetheless tempting to believe that Morrell had made her mark, experiencing for herself the transcendent pleasure of creation. ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;

Politics newsletter.&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>;&lt;hr />;&lt;p >;About 1.4 million people in the United States end up in homeless shelters every year, many thousands more living on the street. You could fill the city of San Diego with the unhoused. The problem seems gigantic, tragic, and intractable. But there are proven solutions. For the chronically homeless, a key strategy is supportive housing, which provides not only a stable apartment but also services like psychiatric and medical care on-site. The &lt;em>;New Yorker&lt;/em>; contributor Jennifer Egan spent the past year following several individuals who had been homeless for long periods of time &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/09/18/a-journey-from-homelessness-to-a-room-of-ones-own&quot;>;as they transitioned&lt;/a>; into a new supportive-housing building in New York. “Is it easy to bring people with these kinds of difficult histories into one place in the span of eight months? No,” she tells David Remnick. “Does it work? From what I have seen, the answer is yes.” By one estimate, addressing the country&#39;s homelessness problem would cost about ten billion dollars. But Egan argues that the figure pales in comparison with what we&#39;re spending on the problem in the form of emergency medical care, emergency shelter, and other piecemeal solutions. “No one wants to see that line item in a budget, but we are already spending it in all of these diffuse ways,” she says. “We are hemorrhaging money at this problem.”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot;

data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;2018 年，肯·帕克斯顿 (Ken Paxton) 竞选连任德克萨斯州总检察长时，他处于状态不佳以及证券欺诈的联邦起诉书，而且他还因轻微渎职而闻名。他的民主党对手贾斯汀·纳尔逊决定将帕克斯顿可疑的道德判断作为他竞选活动的核心。 “我真的只是想嘲笑这个家伙，并强调腐败的卑鄙唯利是图，”尼尔森最近告诉我。选举前不久，纳尔逊的竞选团队获得了 2013 年帕克斯顿居住的科林县法院入口处的监控录像。在这段模糊的视频中，帕克斯顿穿着西装，拎着公文包，在金属探测器上发现了一支万宝龙钢笔，有人留在了那里。帕克斯顿把那支价值数千美元的笔塞进口袋，然后走开。 （几天后，一名副警长联系了帕克斯顿，帕克斯顿归还了那支笔，称他误拿了它。）这段视频被广泛观看；无论如何，帕克斯顿以三分的优势赢得了选举。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;帕克斯顿长期以来一直受到欺诈、腐败和普遍不当行为的指控——他的国家证券欺诈指控可以追溯到 2015 年——但直到最近，他似乎对他们无动于衷。 （他对州指控不认罪，审判日期尚未确定。）2020 年 10 月，帕克斯顿的 8 名前雇员（全都是德克萨斯州总检察长办公室的高级职员）指控他们的前老板行贿，滥用职权以及其他联邦和州犯罪。去年秋天，帕克斯顿再次当选，这次以近十个百分点的优势。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;不过，在过去的六个月里，帕克斯顿的政治地位似乎发生了显着的转变。今年五月，在对举报人提出的指控进行秘密调查后，共和党控制的德克萨斯州众议院以压倒性票数弹劾了他。超过百分之七十的共和党人投票支持弹劾，其中包括来自帕克斯顿家乡县的每位众议院议员。 “我很惊讶——我想大多数人都很惊讶，”德克萨斯大学奥斯汀分校德克萨斯政治项目主任詹姆斯·汉森说。 “迄今为止，没有证据表明任何共和党人愿意在初选挑战的有限条件之外就帕克斯顿的行为提出批评。这么长时间以来，他一直逍遥法外。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;两周以来，帕克斯顿在德克萨斯州参议院接受审判，以确定他是否会成为德克萨斯州第三位被免职的民选官员。办公室。作为少数党，民主党大多持观望态度。这场闹剧在共和党人中上演，共和党人中既有帕克斯顿的指控者，也有他的热心支持者。在投票前，帕克斯顿的支持者试图将他的命运与&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tag/donald-trump&quot;>;唐纳德·特朗普&lt;/a>;联系起来。 “这感觉很像他们试图对特朗普总统做的事情，”支持极右翼候选人的“捍卫德克萨斯自由”组织的负责人乔纳森·斯蒂克兰在史蒂夫·班农的节目中表示。帕克斯顿否认有不当行为，他的一位律师称弹劾是“政治迫害”。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;审判第一周早些时候，我去了奥斯汀的红色花岗岩国会大厦，德克萨斯人喜欢参观那里。比国会大厦高十四英尺的地方，可以观看参议院会议厅的会议，这是一间荧光灯照明的房间，周围挂满了昏暗的油画，在室外令人窒息的炎热天气下，空调不停地开着。正如检方所陈述的，针对帕克斯顿的案件既俗气又后果严重，涉及从非法优步乘车到以房屋装修形式进行的贿赂，以及对帕克斯顿“怪异、过分”地专注于利用国家权力的指控。帮助一位朋友，著名的房地产开发商内特·保罗。有时，诉讼过程中充满了令人不安的亲密气氛。对帕克斯顿作证的证人包括他的几位高级雇员：他的前幕僚长、他办公室的律师，以及帕克斯顿的妻子安吉拉曾戏称他们夫妇的“二儿子”的私人助理。 （最受期待的证人之一，据报道与帕克斯顿有外遇的一名妇女最终没有出庭作证。）证词被提交给陪审团，其中包括作为无投票权的州参议员安吉拉。&lt; /p>;&lt;p>;审判由该州副州长丹·帕特里克（Dan Patrick）主持，他是帕克斯顿的政治盟友。 （帕特里克是一位没有受过正规法律培训的前脱口秀主持人，他似乎偶尔会对律师术语感到困惑。）领导检方的两位律师迪克·德盖林和拉斯蒂·哈丁以前从未合作过，尽管他们曾为对立的一方辩护过。少数案例。 “我们没有踢对方的小腿或其他任何东西，”德盖林告诉我。德盖林和哈丁都是八十岁出头的人，他们在德克萨斯州许多最丑闻的事件中发挥了作用，从安然公司倒闭到&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/来自西南的信/韦科的真实情况&quot;>;韦科围城&lt;/a>;。罗伯特·德斯特承认杀害并肢解加尔维斯顿的邻居后，德盖林让他无罪释放。作为安娜·妮可·史密斯 (Anna Nicole Smith) 石油大亨丈夫的遗产律师，哈丁在盘问过程中对这位前《花花公子》玩伴进行了无情的针刺，以至于她惊呼道：“去你的，拉斯蒂！” （史密斯没有从遗产中得到任何好处。） 作为检察官，两人都扮演了慈爱但严厉的乡村祖父的角色。 （德盖林曾一度反对帕克斯顿的一位律师的主张，并宣称这是“废话”。）帕克斯顿的首席律师托尼·布兹比 (Tony Buzbee) 是一名出庭律师，2017 年因停车而陷入 HOA 麻烦。他休斯顿的家门前有一辆坦克。在审判的第一周，肤色黝黑的布兹比指责媒体有“偏见”，发布了一张让他看起来比实际颜色更橙色的照片。&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline- recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;证词有时很戏剧性，检方强调，为帕克斯顿作证的证人并非出于党派之争。 （当一个人被问到他有多保守时，从一到十，他给自己打了十一分。）检方结案陈词的一部分是由州众议员杰夫·利奇（Jeff Leach）发表的，他是一名共和党人，他将帕克斯顿描述为朋友和朋友。导师。 “我爱肯·帕克斯顿很长时间了，”他说，然后敦促参议员将帕克斯顿免职。周六，帕克斯顿在一次主要是党派路线的投票中被宣告无罪，对他的 16 项指控被宣告无罪。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;帕克斯顿出生于北达科他州，他的父亲在那里的一个空军基地服役，后来就读于贝勒大学德克萨斯大学，他在那里认识了安吉拉。在他职业生涯的大部分时间里，他都住在麦金尼，这是达拉斯以北 30 英里的一个庞大且快速发展的郊区，他在那里帮助建立了附近的一座大型教堂，参与了各种可疑的商业交易，并担任 JC Penney 的内部法律顾问。他的政治权力崛起似乎不是基于他杰出的个人品质，而是基于他在共和党内的联盟。 （当我向汉森描述帕克斯顿“不是特别有魅力”时，他突然大笑起来。他说：“是的，我认为可以这么说。”）他在 2002 年第一次赢得了州议会选举，这是一波浪潮的一部分这使共和党自重建以来首次在立法院获得多​​数席位，并巩固了他们对德克萨斯州政治的控制。在任期间，帕克斯顿与日益反动的福音派结盟。汉森说，随着这群人开始主导德克萨斯州乃至全国的共和党政治，帕克斯顿“完美地驾驭了这股浪潮”。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;在州参议院任职一届后，帕克斯顿一度当选德克萨斯州顶级律师当时总检察长在国家政治中扮演着新的突出的党派角色。在 2016 年的一次活动中，安吉拉·帕克斯顿 (Angela Paxton) 在台上开玩笑说，她的丈夫经常不在州议会大厦或华盛顿特区，他效仿了他的前任 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker .com/tag/greg-abbott&quot;>;格雷格·阿博特&lt;/a>;，对奥巴马政府发起了大量诉讼。 “如果你要在我上床睡觉后回家，我需要提醒一下，这样你就不会被枪杀，”安吉拉明亮地说，引来人群的笑声。 “如你所见，他在这里，没有被枪杀。”然后她唱了宾·克罗斯比和安德鲁斯姐妹歌曲的一个版本，改编以反映她婚姻的细节：“我是一个手枪包妈妈，我的丈夫起诉奥巴马，我是一个手枪包”妈妈，是的，我是。”&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/ div>;&lt;p>;在帕克斯顿的领导下，总检察长办公室发布了指南，将对未成年人的性别肯定护理归类为虐待儿童，并支持&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyoker.com/news/our-columnists/the-德克萨斯州堕胎法的多重威胁&quot;>;立法&lt;/a>;激励私人起诉任何帮助他人堕胎的人。帕克斯顿表示，如果最高法院重新审理劳伦斯诉德克萨斯州案，他将支持德克萨斯州的反鸡奸法。他也是唐纳德·特朗普的重要捍卫者。 2021 年 1 月 6 日，帕克斯顿在支持特朗普的集会上发表讲话，该集会是&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/01/25/among-the-insurrectionists&quot;>;袭击Capitol&lt;/a>;，安吉拉在他身边。 “因为我们今天在这里，我们要传递的信息是：我们不会放弃战斗，”他说。 “我们是德克萨斯人。我们是美国人。我们不会放弃。”他接着将那天下午的暴力事件归咎于 Antifa，并带头发起一场试图推翻选举的失败诉讼。&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;一些共和党人对全州范围内的担忧似乎正在蔓延感到不安。在国家问题上哗众取宠。一位前共和党民选高级官员告诉我，总检察长办公室还因发表符合帕克斯顿支持者利益的意见而享有盛誉。他说：“我无法想象在阿博特领导下会发生这种情况，当然在[约翰]科宁领导下也不会发生这种情况。”现在是一名参议员。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;在接任司法部长后不久，帕克斯顿解雇了高级员工并更换了他们和具有极右血统的助手。这些新员工包括杰夫·马特尔（Jeff Mateer），他是一名律师，曾代表俄勒冈州一家面包店拒绝为一对女同性恋夫妇烤蛋糕，并称变性儿童是“撒旦计划”的一部分。九月，马特尔是第一个被传唤出庭作证指控帕克斯顿的举报人。马特尔在看台上脸色通红，心情不安，但他被前任老板背叛的感觉是显而易见的。他说：“我得出的结论是，帕克斯顿先生的行为是不道德、不道德的，而且我真诚地相信这是非法的。”弹劾指控源于帕克斯顿与内特的关系开发商保罗.保罗是来自印度移民的儿子，在德克萨斯大学奥斯汀分校完成一年级学业后，他购买了他的第一块房地产，一栋十三单元的公寓楼。他最终从大学退学，在他二十二岁左右的时候，他的企业开始从奥斯汀警察退休系统筹集两千五百万美元的投资。 Paul 的时机很偶然：他创业后不久，2008 年经济衰退来袭，他在低利率和低价格时期购买了房产，并在奥斯汀科技推动的繁荣时期看到了房产的估值急剧上升。 2014 年，“Nate Paul”是奥斯汀《商业杂志》网站上搜索次数最多的短语；三年后，时年三十的保罗告诉&lt;em>;福布斯&lt;/em>;，他“在某种程度上垄断了奥斯汀市中心潜在办公空间的市场。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;但很快就出现了麻烦的迹象。 2018 年，保罗的企业开始拖欠据称价值数亿美元的贷款。第二年，他的办公室和家被联邦调查局突击搜查（6 月，保罗被指控向金融机构撒谎以获取贷款八项罪名。根据起诉书，他提供了粗略篡改的财务报表，例如，一个账户持有 1850 万美元，而实际上只持有 12000 美元。保罗此前否认在此案中存在不当行为。）保罗认为这次突袭是出于政治动机，他希望司法部长办公室进行干预。据其中一名举报人称，帕克斯顿认为他的证券欺诈指控是有偏见的调查的结果，并且是一名愿意倾听的人。但他的副手们对此表示怀疑。帕克斯顿的前执法主管、一位名叫大卫·麦克斯韦尔的粗暴的德克萨斯游骑兵退伍军人作证说，他警告他的老板不要与保罗有牵连。 “我告诉他内特·保罗是一名罪犯，他正在经营一个庞氏骗局，该计划将与比利·索尔·埃斯蒂斯（Billie Sol Estes）（德克萨斯州臭名昭著的诈骗犯）相媲美，“如果他不摆脱这个人并停止做他该做的事，如果他这样做，他就会被起诉。”帕克斯顿和保罗的法律代表没有回应置评请求。&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:自动&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;08i7he&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden= &quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt; div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;incv4r&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt; div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;帕克斯顿和保罗是不太可能的朋友。保罗与莱昂纳多·迪卡普里奥一起参加派对，开着一辆兰博基尼，并享有“这样的人，你知道，他会经过一家夜总会，花一大笔钱，在那里呆上三十分钟，然后就消失了”。在市中心一家俱乐部工作的女士告诉我。相比之下，帕克斯顿将自己描绘成一位虔诚而忠诚的丈夫和父亲。为了解释为什么帕克斯顿会不遗余力地支持保罗，检方提出了两种理论：首先，保罗雇佣了一名据称与帕克斯顿有染的女性，并帮助促成了这件事。 （“仅仅因为某人有外遇并不意味着他们是——引用——‘罪犯’，”布兹比辩称。）其次，保罗支付了帕克斯顿家的翻修费用——这些想法一度包括新的想法。花岗岩台面。 （在开庭辩论中，布兹比嘲笑了这个想法；辩方最终提出了证据，他们认为，证明帕克斯顿夫妇自己支付了翻修费用。保罗否认贿赂帕克斯顿。）&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport- Monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;根据众议院调查和证人证词，无论动机如何，帕克斯顿据称在 2020 年春季和夏季不遗余力地协助保罗。他安排保罗与他办公室的高级官员会面，并试图帮助保罗获得列出对他不利的证据的文件，包括机密消息来源的姓名。保罗的一个商业实体与一家慈善信托公司卷入了一场旷日持久的法律纠纷；帕克斯顿计划亲自代表保罗就该案提出一项动议，直到他的一名副手劝说他不要这样做。然后，当保罗的一些财产计划在止赎拍卖中出售时，保罗再次向司法部长寻求帮助。 7 月下旬，帕克斯顿指示他的副第一助理总检察长瑞安·班格特 (Ryan Bangert) 根据该州的新冠疫情协议，起草一份关于是否应继续进行户外止赎拍卖的意见。 Bangert 的结论是销售情况良好；德克萨斯州优先考虑保持企业开放。当帕克斯顿读到草稿时，他很沮丧。根据班格特的说法，他说：“这是错误的答案。”班格特急忙修改意见，帕克斯顿紧盯着他，“就像有人把他扣为人质一样，”班格特后来说。马特尔有些厌恶地作证说，最终草案建议暂时停止止赎拍卖，“就好像安东尼·福奇写的一样”。班格特在周日晚上午夜过后完成了这件事。后来他得知保罗的财产定于两天后拍卖。 （帕克斯顿的辩护团队坚称，该意见对保罗的财产没有影响，保罗的财产已被置于破产状态，从而停止了止赎程序。）&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;举报人的证词描绘了一幅功能失调的办公室的画面，其中对保罗的关注分散了他们认为更重要的优先事项：准备挑战拜登当选的诉讼；响应&lt;em>;新冠肺炎&lt;/em>;。班格特作证说，当他和马特尔即将就计划针对谷歌的诉讼开始一次重要会议时，帕克斯顿打电话来，想讨论另一起内特·保罗的问题。 （随着总检察长办公室受到关注，一些琐碎的抱怨也开始出现。几位前雇员告诉美联社，HEB 每年圣诞节都会向总检察长办公室发送椰子蛋糕。员工过去常常分享蛋糕，但当据报道，帕克斯顿接手后，他将其保留给自己。）&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;到了 9 月份，帕克斯顿得出结论，他的员工没有对保罗的投诉给予应有的关注。记录和证词显示，他聘请了一名外部律师，但没有通知他的副手。这位律师名叫布兰登·卡马克，五年前从法学院毕业。 （在群发短信中，马特尔称他为“孩子”。）“可能必须有人告诉他如何送达传票，”卡马克的父亲告诉《德克萨斯论坛报》。“这就是他缺乏经验的原因。”这个男孩就是。”保罗的律师迈克尔·韦恩 (Michael Wynne) 向卡马克提供了保罗希望调查的数十个目标的清单，卡马克使用韦恩提供的语言对其中一些人发出传票。 （保罗似乎将自己视为间谍惊悚片中的主角，喜欢用代号来提及他的计划；他将这次行动称为“深海行动”。）传票名单中包括执法人员，以及保罗卷入一起事件的人员。与借钱给他的银行进行法律斗争。当卡马克去两家银行送达传票时，韦恩陪同他。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;9 月下旬，其中一家收到传票的银行致电总检察长办公室，以确保传票的真实性。 “我们遇到了一个大问题，”马特尔在群聊中发短信说。 “这孩子已经向银行发出了传票。亲自出现在银行。”一行人聚集在马特尔的办公室。结论是，正如班格特在他的证词中所说，内特·保罗和他的利益在该机构中“转移”，帕克斯顿“决心利用我们办公室的权力，并为了个人的利益而反对整个机构的利益”。班格特作证说，他们决定联系联邦调查局，感觉就像“走进了真空”。 “我们是在保护国家利益，最终，我相信，是在保护总检察长的利益，并且在我看来，签署了我们的职业死亡令。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;即使在一些举报人之后2020 年，在一场错误解雇诉讼中，他们公开了他们的投诉的大致轮廓，但影响有限。在过去的两年里，帕克斯顿在共和党人中的工作支持率仍然相当高。他与特朗普的联盟似乎掩盖了他办公室里发生的丑闻。 2023 年 2 月，帕克斯顿同意就错误解雇案达成 300 万美元的和解金。他在一份声明中表示：“我选择这条道路是为了节省纳税人的钱，并确保我作为司法部长的第三个任期不会受到不必要的干扰。”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>; &lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div 数据节点-id=&quot;qp0jrs&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>; &lt;div >;&lt;p >;根据和解协议，举报人将从国家资金中获得报酬，等待立法者的批准。众议院发起了一项调查，调查结果包括在线提供的近四千页文件。至少对一些共和党人来说，帕克斯顿的个人丑闻太过分散注意力。 “有人致力于儿童抚养执法，或者代表铁路委员会或德克萨斯州环境质量委员会工作——所有这些工作都有助于在德克萨斯州这样大的州保持人们的健康和安全，”这位前高级官员说。共和党级别告诉我的。 “这可能会损害他们的声誉。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;如果帕克斯顿被免职，阿博特就会任命一位临时替代者——可能是同样保守的人，但没有帕克斯顿的包袱。但帕克斯顿与特朗普以及党内“让美国再次伟大”派的联盟依然牢固。今年夏天，帕克斯顿的支持者向一个专门为他辩护的基金投入了资金。支持极右翼候选人的“捍卫德克萨斯自由”组织支付广告牌，谴责一名投票弹劾帕克斯顿的共和党众议院议员，并威胁要资助初选活动，反对投票赞成罢免帕克斯顿的参议员。 （捍卫德克萨斯自由组织还向丹·帕特里克捐赠了 300 万美元。）周四，特朗普发表了对帕克斯顿的辩护，将弹劾归咎于“建制派 RINOS”。来自这些团体的压力是参议员们严重关切的问题，特别是因为共和党初选选民在决定德克萨斯州竞选结果方面发挥着巨大作用。汉森说：“你看看这个特定的德克萨斯州参议院，你看不到一个在政治上特别勇敢的团体，或者特别愿意接受原则而非个人利益的团体。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;尽管帕克斯顿将恢复他的任期尽管他担任司法部长（自五月弹劾投票以来他已被停职），但他的法律麻烦尚未结束。他仍然面临国家证券欺诈指控，而且他与内特·保罗的关系可能会产生进一步的影响。帕克斯顿自己的律师丹·科格德尔推测，现在面临联邦指控的保罗可能面临着背叛他前朋友的压力。 （周六投票后，科格德尔称弹劾和证券欺诈指控都是“废话”。他说，“这个案子，就像这个案子一样，根本不应该被提起。”“他们应该驳回它。如果他们不这样做的话”驳回它，我们会尝试他们并在那里击败他们，就像我们在这里击败他们一样。”)&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Paxton 的无罪释放是进一步的证据表明共和党被最极端的选民所俘虏。根据最近的民意调查，包括共和党人在内的德克萨斯人对帕克斯顿的行为了解得越多，他们就越不愿意忽视这些行为。 （相比之下，尽管特朗普&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/08/14/the-challenges-of-trumps-third- important-indictment&quot;>;无数起诉书&lt;/a>;。）&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“我们现在看到的很多事情都是一个政党执政二十多年、拥有完全统治地位的副产品曾为德克萨斯州多位共和党官员工作过的传播策略师詹妮弗·哈里斯 (Jennifer Harris) 表示： “作为一名党派人士，回到过去，我可以为此欢呼，但我认为你可能会变得自满，与自己的选民脱节。”哈里斯表示，她不再认为自己是共和党人。 “我内心的品牌传播者就像是，‘你无法挽救这个品牌。’” ”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“从非常狭隘的党派角度来看，如果他被无罪释放，对民主党来说几乎更好，”前民主党候选人贾斯汀·尼尔森在投票前告诉我。 “那么整个共和党就沾满了这种腐败，你无法将其分开。” ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;cpchdg&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;
