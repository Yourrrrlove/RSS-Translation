aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt; /div>;&lt;div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;麦考利主持了这个训练营，布拉德利是特邀嘉宾。麦考利还曾在圣路易斯老鹰队担任明星中锋，并曾入选圣路易斯大学全美最佳阵容。他被称为“Easy Ed”，因为他刚上场的时候。当他的队友们进行快攻时，他几乎在步行中落后于他们。艾斯艾德身高六英尺八英寸，比尔六英尺五英寸。十九年后，我陪同比尔前往新泽西州海边高地的木板路进行竞选访问，在那里，他在一块写着“&lt;em>;认识参议员布拉德利&lt;/em>;”的牌子后面逆流而上。他遇到的一位潜在选民说：“伙计，你高吗？当你为尼克斯队效力时，你看起来很小。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“当我为尼克斯队效力时，我&lt;em>;很小&lt;/em>;，”参议员说。足够正确了。他是小前锋。现在，1964 年，在密苏里州的唐博斯科营地，我与比尔·布拉德利和埃德·麦考利一起走在一条土路上。道路由深深的平行车辙组成，中间有一个长满草的驼峰。布拉德利是一种惯例，麦考利是另一种，而我则处于他们之间的驼峰上。我比大多数人都小——大约和安德鲁·卡内基、詹姆斯·麦迪逊、弗拉基米尔·普京、约瑟夫·斯大林和拿破仑·波拿巴一样小。事实上，我的巅峰身高是五英尺七英寸，最近已经凝缩了。驼峰比车辙高一英尺。尽管如此，我们三个人的轮廓还是形成了字母 M。&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;比尔在大四的早期度过了东京，获得金牌。普林斯顿大学的其他人也在那里——莱斯利·布什 (Lesley Bush)，一名跳台跳水员，在普林斯顿高中读四年级；杰德·格雷夫（Jed Graef），一名仰泳运动员，刚从大学毕业；我的父亲是美国队的主治医生。所有三名运动员都是金牌得主。还有日元问题。如果运动员想观看自己运动以外的比赛，则必须付费才能观看。杰德想看篮球比赛。比尔找到了一个备用装备包，添加了一些服装装饰，然后将杰德作为美国队的一员带入了竞技场。故事讲到这里，我情不自禁地回到了 2003 年，当时杰德的女儿达娜是我在普林斯顿写作班的二年级学生。她的一篇文章是关于她在纽约西部的童年的。她的母亲是一位佛教僧人。达纳在文章中说道：&lt;/p>;&lt;blockquote >;&lt;div >;&lt;p>;我常年在雪地里玩耍，从邻居的院子里砍郁金香，偷饼干。我在复活节吃薄饼，在光明节吃马铃薯饼，几乎每天都吃巧克力。当我想让客人留下来时，我就把他们的钥匙藏起来，然后骑在父亲的肩膀上从幼儿园回家。我穿了一件白色蕾丝连衣裙参加我母亲的任命仪式，一件灰色缎面连衣裙参加她的认可，一件绿色连衣裙参加我父亲进入游泳名人堂的就职典礼。&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/blockquote>;&lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;qy78h&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/ div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;比尔·布拉德利 (Bill Bradley) 年轻时，他的母亲给他报名了参加足够的游泳课程来提高蓝鳍金枪鱼的水平。她是一名运动员，一名高尔夫俱乐部冠军。比尔从来没有打过高尔夫球。网球课程既不会产生过顶球，也不会产生反手击球。但他作为游泳运动员的能力给他留下了深刻的印象。在十九世纪七十年代的七年里，我们一家人在新罕布什尔州北部湖边的一所房子里度过了七月。事实上，我们是两个合并的家庭，有很多孩子，但我们有足够的独木舟和兰奇利船可以四处走动。 When Bill and his wife, Ernestine, first visited us there, Bill stepped off the dock and into a canoe. He chose a place quite close to one end of the canoe. The other end shot up into the air, pointed at the sky, while Bill&#39;s end penetrated the lake with him in it. I had never heard him mention canoeing lessons. This was in the middle of his ten years as a Knick. The next summer, he announced on arrival that ABC, for its program “The Superstars,” had invited him to Florida with other professional athletes to compete in various sports other than their own. Bill would be competing as a swimmer. So he wanted to take advantage of our lake to prepare to race on television. I had competed in swimming only as a boy at summer camp, but I didn&#39;t lose a race in ten years. For what else it may be worth, I had also been an American Red Cross water-safety instructor during summers in my college years.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I gestured toward a diving raft that was forty or fifty yards from the dock. I said I would be pleased to help him train for television and would race him from the dock to the raft. The look on his face was not exactly contemptuous; it would be interpretive to call it a smirk. There was some of that, but mainly he was concealing amusement, and doing his best not to be insulting, not even to seem indulgent. It was clear, though, that he thought my offer absurd.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Three, two, one, go! When Bill reached the raft, I was waiting for him there. We had a telephone on the porch of the lakeside house. Bill swam back to the dock, climbed out, went to the telephone dripping, touched a bunch of buttons, got ABC on the phone, and cancelled his trip to Florida.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;In fact, he was acting, pantomiming, faking a phone call to Florida. He was connected to no one at ABC or anywhere else. There is more clown in him than most people have had a chance to discern. He went to Florida, he was on the show, and he won something.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The swimming race was unimagined and ten years in the future when &lt;em>;The&lt;/em>; &lt;em>;New Yorker&lt;/em>; published my Profile of Bill Bradley. My participation in the process occurred in William Shawn&#39;s office, where he had checking proofs, copy-editor proofs, and every other kind of proof, including his own, none of which he showed to me as he brought up point after point and discussed them with me. &lt;em>;The New Yorker&#39;s&lt;/em>; criterion was that the writer be satisfied, and in that criterion I was immersed for the first time.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;As I wrote in 2017 in my book “Draft No. 4”:&lt;/p>;&lt;blockquote >;&lt;div >;&lt;p>;Shawn edited the piece himself, as he routinely did with new writers of long fact, breaking them in, so to speak, but not exactly like a horse, more like a baseball mitt. For a week or so before the press date, we met each day and went through galleys from comma to comma, with an extra beat for a semicolon. 。 。 。 Now and again, Mr. Shawn said things that were most encouraging to a fretful, not to say neurotic, unconfident writer. He had had a lot of practice.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/blockquote>;&lt;p >;He made me feel entirely comfortable in his presence, so comfortable that when the &lt;em>;Daily Princetonian&lt;/em>; published its annual Joke Issue two days after &lt;em>;The&lt;/em>; &lt;em>;New Yorker&lt;/em>; published the Bradley Profile, I took a copy of the Joke Issue to West Forty-third Street to show to Mr. Shawn. A big, bold, wall-to-wall headline said:&lt;/p>;&lt;blockquote >;&lt;div >;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;align-center&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:align-center&quot;>;&lt;p>;BRADLEY BOOTED-OUT!&lt;br/>;Olympian Took Dope,&lt;br/>;Threw Cornell Game&lt;/p>;&lt;/inline-embed>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/blockquote>;&lt;p >;A front-page sidebar contained the reaction of Harry Truman, a quote begun by chaste symbols—?!*%#—meant to suggest unprintable words. “I never did trust that boy,” Harry said. Elsewhere on the front page was a photograph of Grant Wood&#39;s “American Gothic,” under the words “Parents Receive News Stoically.” Without explanation, I handed the Joke Issue to Shawn, thinking that he would get it immediately and laugh. He didn&#39;t get it, and he didn&#39;t laugh. His face reddened. He looked stricken. I spluttered explanation. I wasn&#39;t ninety-two then, as I am at this writing. I was thirty-three going on thirteen. I desperately hoped to join the &lt;em>;New Yorker&lt;/em>; staff. This, in a crowded field, is the dumbest thing I ever did.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;xf03pg&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;When Bill was at Oxford, studying PPE (Politics, Philosophy, and Economics) as a Rhodes Scholar, he not only played basketball for the university but also flew to Italy to play professionally for a Milanese meatpacker called Simmenthal. In his second Oxford year, he wrote to me asking that I go to Trenton and buy from the state government a book titled “New Jersey Civil Practice Laws and Rules.” I sent it to Oxford. Widely predicted to be a future governor of Missouri, Bill was weaving the first threads of a carpetbag.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;The Knicks had drafted him, and after he returned from Oxford, in 1967, he had his first tryout with the team, at the Knicks&#39; training center, in Farmingdale, on Long Island. Red Holzman, the coach, studied Bill in the company of the team&#39;s best players, among them Dick Barnett, Walt Frazier, and Willis Reed. Willis, six-ten, was the Knickerbockers&#39; franchise player, the team captain, its leading scorer. Like planets, the others orbited around him. And off they went in full-court scrimmage in Farmingdale. Bill was an exceptional passer, a pinpoint passer, but his first pass to Willis connected with nothing and bounced away, hitting the base of the empty stands. A minute or two later, after Willis set a pick, as he had before, Bill ran his defender into the pick, again expecting Willis to roll suddenly away from his defender, coming open for a bounce pass, in this classic set piece of basketball. Again, the pass went bouncing off on its own. Holzman blew his whistle and stepped onto the court to tell Bill, “Willis doesn&#39;t roll.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;This flat statement made a deep entry into the comic wit of Robert Bingham, the &lt;em>;New Yorker&lt;/em>; fact editor to whom Mr. Shawn assigned me after my first two Profiles. Bingham was my editor for sixteen years, before he died, in his fifties. He dragged my confidence past numerous barriers, and he treated my manuscripts as if they were mine, looking up now and again from some hot-dog line I&#39;d written and saying, “Willis doesn&#39;t roll.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Bill, meanwhile, got off to a slow, discouraging start with the Knicks, not getting much game time, and even being booed in Madison Square Garden because of irrationally high expectations, not to mention a widespread skepticism prompted by the size of his signing bonus, for which he had been given the nickname Dollar Bill. I had admired him and what I heard about him since he was a freshman in college, and he would become a friend forever, but there would be no era in which I thought more highly of him than when he was struggling to make it with the Knicks, playing three minutes a game, or something of the kind, and surely feeling the threat of a depression the like of which he&#39;d never experienced.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;After basketball games in the Garden, he would go to dinner and the basketball did not go with him. His best asset, I had long thought, was his ability to compartmentalize the factors in his life, and never let his concentration on one thing spill over into others. When he went to dinner, with a variety of people, he dwelt on subjects that had nothing to do with his job. He was like that then, and he is like that now.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;By February, 1969, he was faring better. When the Knicks showed up in Milwaukee to play the Bucks, I happened to be nearby, spending a week as a writer-in-residence at Lake Forest Academy, in Illinois. I went to the game. The Knicks won. Bill had a standout game, and was confronted afterward by a man with a microphone asking for his pithiest analysis of the contest. Stepping into this cliché encounter, Bill took the microphone and analyzed the action, then reanalyzed the action, and gave a third and a fourth analysis, and was not about to give back the microphone. Changing the subject, he talked on, and on, and on, until the TV control room threw a switch.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;On Christmas Eve that year, in a New York movie theatre where continuous screenings ran far into the night, Bill stayed up late with me, watching Robert Redford in “Downhill Racer.” Since early summer, my wife and I had been separated, and therefore came Christmas without my daughters. Apart from a family death, if there is a lower moment in a physically healthy life I can&#39;t imagine it.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The Knicks&#39; season was in full flow. They beat the Detroit Pistons 112–111 that Christmas Day and lost to the Lakers the following night. They would see more of the Lakers and the Lakers would see more of them. The Lakers were Wilt Chamberlain. The Knicks were Dave DeBusschere, Bradley, Barnett, Frazier, and Captain Willis Reed. They were on a roll (but not that one). In June, they beat the Lakers in the NBA finals. It was the Knicks&#39; first championship. They won their second, also against the Lakers, in 1973, and at this writing the Knicks have yet to win another.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;His political ruminations notwithstanding, Bill thought about other futures, other professions, and one of these was photography. He bought a Nikon with multiple lenses and went at the challenge with the same dedication he had given to no-look passes and peripheral vision. One of his first artistic themes was life on the road, life on the run, the quotidian experience of a professional athlete, forever in airplanes, in unfamiliar cities, checking into and out of hotels. One example of this genre is on display in a fishing cabin owned by me and my family on the upper Delaware River. Made in Los Angeles, the picture is a point-blank view of a hotel under construction, shot from a room in a neighboring hotel so close that the picture shows no roofline or other defining edges, just twenty half-finished hotel rooms, full of building materials, and looking like a grotesque checkerboard, the itinerant athlete&#39;s total view. DeBusschere, Bill&#39;s roommate on the road, slept through most of that.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Fifty-eight years ago, I took an outdoor picture of Bill with our garage in the background. He was twenty-two. In more recent years, he has used that photograph in two of his books and in a long video he describes as “a performative autobiography.” In professional compensation, I have yet to see one red cent, let alone a dollar bill.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Bill had been a Knick for seven years when West Germany and the Netherlands reached the finals of the World Cup, in Munich. Bill was married now, and his wife—as smart a person as I have ever met, apart from nuclear scientists and geophysicists—had grown up Ernestine Misslbeck, in Ingolstadt, Bavaria, fifty miles from Munich. The Misslbecks wanted to attend the Cup final, a tough ticket if ever there was one. The match would occur on the seventh of July. Could Bill do something for his in-laws? He called the Milanese meatpacker he had played for when he was at Oxford. The company said it would obtain the tickets if Bill would fly to Italy and play one exhibition game for the meatpacker. He went.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;He was elected a US senator from New Jersey in 1978. His home was in Denville then, in Morris County. Earlier, when he had first planned to run for office in the state, I had sought and found a carpetbag, filled it up with New Jersey road maps, and given it to him. It hung on a peg high inside his front door for twenty years. It is now in the possession of Ernestine and Bill&#39;s daughter, Theresa Anne. She is my goddaughter. When Bill was in his early Senate days and had not yet bought a house in Washington, he borrowed the apartment of Carl Bernstein and Nora Ephron, who were somewhere else at the time. For a week or so, I was in Washington working on my geology project at the Smithsonian and at the US Geological Survey, nearby in Virginia. I stayed with Bill. Coming through the door, you faced a curvilinear wall with an Italian bicycle hanging on it like a work of art, which it was. It was worth more than a car. And it was not the most arresting sight there. The apartment was filled with Pat and Dick Nixon figurines, a Pat salt shaker with a Dick pepper shaker, Pat and Dick ceramics of every ilk, five years after Deep Throat and Woodward and Bernstein&#39;s reportage on Watergate.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;sb4tha&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Bill&#39;s new presence in the Senate gave rise to a trivia question that lasted for eighteen years around Princeton. People with nothing better to do entertained one another with this question: What Princeton basketball player became a Rhodes Scholar and later a United States senator? Answer: Paul Sarbanes, Princeton 1954. Sarbanes, from Maryland, served in the US Senate for thirty years, which included Bill Bradley&#39;s eighteen.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In 1970, on vacation in Maine, Bill began writing a book he called “Life on the Run.” His ten-year career in pro basketball was still not far from its beginning, but his theme was clear to him and was in part the theme expressed in the photograph he made in the Los Angeles hotel. Since my own first book had been about Bill, it was assumed by some that I had had a hand in Bill&#39;s first book. If you want to know the truth, he sent me the manuscript, asking me to vet it. I did, and wrote to him, saying, among other things, “Abandon the project, you&#39;ll embarrass yourself.” He still has the letter. He claims that—twenty years after “Life on the Run”—I suggested that he abandon the manuscript of his third book, “Time Present, Time Past.” He has also stored in his memory, and conceivably his alone, some magazine&#39;s list of “The 10 Best Sports Books of All Time.” “Life on the Run” was No. 4. “A Sense of Where You Are,” my book about him, No. 6. Not that it is relevant, but my book about him says, “He is everything his parents think he is.” Anybody with enough angst to destroy a rug while trying to write is a writer.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;When I was preparing this piece, Bill&#39;s daughter surprised me with a letter I had written to Bill fifty-eight years ago—a few days before he graduated from Princeton:&lt;/p>;&lt;blockquote >;&lt;div >;&lt;p>;We&#39;ve spent so much time talking together that I&#39;m going to miss it quite a bit. 。 。 。 There was always some sort of purpose, something to be accomplished . 。 。 but the thing I learned that impressed me most was that, although your discipline is justly celebrated, you know how to waste time every bit as much as I do, which means that you&#39;re a champion at it. For every hour in which something got done, two went out the window. The best two went out the window.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;At Drake&#39;s Corner Road, you will be missed by Laura, Sarah, and Jenny. 。 。 。 Martha will have to live down the disappointment of not having been old enough when you were here. Even the older children have no standards by which to judge you except what you&#39;re like when you&#39;re dealing with them, and all of them start acting as if Ringling Brothers is in town whenever you come up the driveway.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;. 。 。 I hope that you will be coming up the driveway for years and years. Come to think of it, that is what we&#39;re all going to miss most: the explosive sound of the tires biting into the red gravel; the after-burner cutting in when you reached the big poplar; and, as the car came into view, the impressionistic blur against the green of the trees; then, finally, the relieving sight of the arresting parachute opening out to the rear.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/blockquote>;&lt;p >;When Yolanda Whitman and I were married, fifty-plus years ago now, the mayor of Princeton officiated on the Princeton campus. We were five in all, and the two others—the witnesses—were my mother and Bill. He is the younger brother I never had, and I am the brother he never had. “Bro” is how he has signed his e-mails to me since soon after e-mail was introduced. ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 09 Oct 2023 19:06:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Jake Sullivan’s Trial by Combat]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/10/16/trial-by-combat]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-09T10:00:00.000Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/651dcf7d98d3cdbde1212c2e/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/231016_r43166.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;article >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attribute-verso-pattern=&quot;article-body&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;ArticlePageChunks&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;figure data-testid=&quot;IframeEmbed&quot; >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;IframeEmbedContainer&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;iframe height=&quot;90&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; sandbox=&quot;allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups&quot; title=&quot;Embedded Frame&quot; data-src=&quot;https://audm.herokuapp.com/player-embed?pub=newyorker&amp;amp;articleID=651d80ba6814f7b281e47dc0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay *; encrypted-media *; clipboard-write; autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture&quot;>;&lt;/iframe>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;p >;On a Monday afternoon in August, when President Joe Biden was on vacation and the West Wing felt like a ghost town, his national-security adviser, Jake Sullivan, sat down to discuss America&#39;s involvement in the war in Ukraine. Sullivan had agreed to an interview “with trepidation,” as he had told me, but now, in the White House&#39;s Roosevelt Room, steps from the Oval Office, he seemed surprisingly relaxed for a congenital worrier. (“It&#39;s my job to worry,” he once told an interviewer. “So I worry about literally everything.”) When I asked about reports that, at a recent &lt;em >;NATO&lt;/em>; summit, he had been furious during negotiations over whether to issue Ukraine a formal “invitation” to join the Western alliance, he said, only half jokingly, “First of all, I&#39;m, like, the most rational human being on the planet.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;But, when it came to the subject of the war itself, and why Biden has staked so much on helping Ukraine fight it, Sullivan struck an unusually impassioned note. “As a child of the eighties and &#39;Rocky&#39; and &#39;Red Dawn,&#39; I believe in freedom fighters and I believe in righteous causes, and I believe the Ukrainians have one,” he said. “There are very few conflicts that I have seen—maybe none—in the post-Cold War era . 。 。 where there&#39;s such a clear good guy and bad guy. And we&#39;re on the side of the good guy, and we have to do a lot for that person.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;There&#39;s no question that the United States has done a lot: American assistance to Ukraine, totalling seventy-six billion dollars, with more than forty-three billion for security aid, is the largest such effort since the Second World War. In the aftermath of the February 24, 2022, Russian invasion, the US has delivered more than two thousand Stinger anti-aircraft missiles, more than ten thousand Javelin antitank weapons, and more than two million 155-millimetre artillery rounds. It has sent Patriot missiles for air defense and High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems—known as &lt;em >;HIMARS&lt;/em>;—to give Ukraine longer-range strike capability; sophisticated Ghost drones and small hand-launched Puma drones; Stryker armored personnel carriers, Bradley fighting vehicles, and M1A1 Abrams tanks.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Biden has framed the conflict in sweeping, nearly civilizational terms, vowing to stick with Ukraine for “as long as it takes” to defeat the invaders, who—despite an estimated hundred and twenty thousand dead and a hundred and eighty thousand injured—still hold nearly twenty per cent of the country&#39;s territory. But at nearly every stage the Administration has faced sharp questions about the nature and the durability of the US commitment. Beyond the inevitable tensions with Ukraine&#39;s President, Volodymyr Zelensky, there are jostling Washington bureaucracies, restive European allies, and a growing Trumpist faction in the Republican-controlled House of Representatives, which is opposed to the bipartisan congressional bills that have, up until now, funded the war. A vocal peace camp, meanwhile, is demanding negotiations with Vladimir Putin to end the conflict, even as Secretary of State Antony Blinken has said there is currently little prospect for “meaningful diplomacy.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The task of leading the White House through such treacherous politics has fallen to Sullivan, who, when he was appointed, at the age of forty-four, was the youngest national-security adviser since McGeorge Bundy held the job, during the Vietnam War. “It&#39;s really Jake,” Ivo Daalder, a former US Ambassador to &lt;em >;NATO&lt;/em>;, who has consulted regularly with the National Security Council since the Russian invasion, told me. “He&#39;s the quartermaster of the war—and everything else.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Sullivan is lean, with wispy blond hair, a tendency to blush bright red, and a workaholic intensity unusual even by Washington&#39;s standards. (One night a few months ago, Sullivan discovered an intruder who had broken into his home at around 3 &lt;em >;am&lt;/em>;, because he was still up working.) In his office, there is a chart—updated frequently—showing countries&#39; current stocks of ammunition that might go to Ukraine. This spring, during the battle of Bakhmut, he knew the status of the fighting down to the city block. He often speaks with his counterpart in Kyiv, Zelensky&#39;s chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, two or three times a week, and has taken charge of everything from lobbying South Korea for artillery shells to running an emergency operation to get Ukraine additional power generators. Earlier this year, when Germany balked at sending Leopard tanks to Ukraine, Sullivan spent days in intensive talks with the German national-security adviser to secure them; in exchange, the US agreed to provide M1A1 Abrams tanks, a move that the Pentagon had long opposed. The NSC, in other words, has gone operational, with Sullivan personally overseeing the effort while also doing the rest of his job, which, in recent months, has taken him to secret meetings with a top Chinese official in Vienna and Malta and to complicated negotiations in the Middle East.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;In contrast to the epic feuds between George W. Bush&#39;s Pentagon and the State Department over Iraq, or the vicious infighting in Donald Trump&#39;s turnover-ridden national-security team, the Biden White House&#39;s approach to the war has been notably drama-free. Disagreements among advisers, while at times robust and protracted, have barely surfaced in the press. Blinken, a confidant of Biden for more than two decades, has been perhaps the most visible salesman for the Administration&#39;s strategy and a key conduit to European allies. Lloyd Austin, the congenial and low-profile Secretary of Defense, has overseen the military relationship with Kyiv. Sullivan is more of an inside player, the relentless wonk at Biden&#39;s side. In an interview, Blinken called him “the hub,” an “honest broker” who has refereed the team&#39;s differences, which the Secretary acknowledged to me but described as largely “tactical, rarely fundamental in nature.” The fact that they have “a friendship, partnership, and real complicity in working together for many years,” he added, has also made for an unusually consensus-minded group.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;At the same time, the Administration&#39;s policy hasn&#39;t always been clear. “A pledge to support Ukraine &#39;for as long as it takes&#39; is not a strategy,” the top Republicans on the House and Senate foreign-affairs committees wrote in a letter this month to the White House. A major complaint from Ukraine supporters in both parties is that the White House delayed too long in providing urgently needed weapons. The term “self-deterrence” is popular among those who subscribe to this view. So is “incrementalism.” John Herbst, a former US Ambassador to Ukraine, called it “world-class ad-hoc-ery.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In some sense, the President&#39;s instructions have been clear from the beginning: No US boots on the ground; no supplying weapons for the purpose of attacking Russian territory; and avoid giving Putin grounds for nuclear escalation. In practice, however, it&#39;s fallen to Sullivan and Biden&#39;s other advisers to oversee a series of one-off decisions about which weapons systems to provide to keep Ukraine in the fight. “I don&#39;t necessarily think that they went in thinking, Oh, we&#39;re going to boil this frog slowly, because that&#39;s the best way to avoid escalation,” Andrea Kendall-Taylor, a former national-intelligence officer who worked on the Biden transition team for the NSC, said. “They stumbled into it.”&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot;

Kennan, the Kremlinologist and the architect of containment. Sullivan, in his early thirties, was already a Washington prodigy, with a dazzling résumé and a reputation as a Midwestern nice guy. When Biden named him national-security adviser, he called him a “once-in-a-generation intellect.” Clinton has referred to him as a “once-in-a-generation talent.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Sullivan grew up in a large Irish Catholic family in Minneapolis, one of five children of a high-school guidance counsellor and a college journalism professor who once studied to become a Jesuit priest. At Yale, Sullivan was the editor-in-chief of the &lt;em>;Yale Daily News&lt;/em>; and a nationally ranked college debater; once a week, he commuted to New York to intern at the Council on Foreign Relations. During his senior year, he scored a rare trifecta—“the academic equivalent of horse racing&#39;s Triple Crown,” as the &lt;em>;Yale Bulletin&lt;/em>; put it—winning all three of the most prestigious fellowships available to American undergraduates: the Rhodes, the Marshall, and the Truman. Sullivan opted for the Rhodes, earned a master&#39;s in international relations at Oxford, and took time out to compete in the world collegiate debate championships in Sydney, finishing second. He then went to Yale Law School and, after graduating, secured a Supreme Court clerkship with Justice Stephen Breyer.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;t5yf66&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Sullivan began his political career as an aide to another bright Minnesotan with a Yale degree: the Democratic senator Amy Klobuchar, who connected him with Clinton to run debate prep for her 2008 primary against Barack Obama. Sullivan quickly proved indispensable to the former First Lady, and, when Clinton became Obama&#39;s Secretary of State, Sullivan went with her. “Jake did everything for her,” one of Obama&#39;s senior aides told the authors Jonathan Allen and Amie Parnes. “Whatever was the front-burner issue of the day, you could go to Jake.” Eventually, Clinton and Sullivan travelled to a hundred and twelve countries.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Biden and his national-security team have often been portrayed, with some justification, as a sort of second coming of the Obama Administration, a reunion of the old gang, albeit with younger aides, such as Blinken and Sullivan, moving into principal positions. When Sullivan got married, in 2015, to Maggie Goodlander, who would go on to serve as counsel to Attorney General Merrick Garland, attendees at the wedding, which was held on Yale&#39;s campus, included not only Clinton, who read a Bible verse in the ceremony, but also Blinken and William Burns, Biden&#39;s future CIA director. (During Obama&#39;s Presidency, Sullivan and Burns, at that time the Deputy Secretary of State, were secretly dispatched to Oman to begin talks with Iran, which ultimately produced the Iran nuclear deal.) Tom Sullivan, the groom&#39;s younger brother, is now Blinken&#39;s deputy chief of staff.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Many of the figures who are ascendant in the Biden Administration—including Biden himself—had also been occasional critics of Obama&#39;s policy toward Russia. In 2009, when Obama sought to repair relations with Russia despite its recent invasion of Georgia, Clinton gamely handed Russia&#39;s Foreign Minister, Sergey Lavrov, an oversized “reset” button—incorrectly translated into Russian, as it turned out—to symbolize the new policy. But internally she was skeptical. When she left the Obama Administration, in 2013, one of her last acts was to submit a harshly worded memo warning the President about Putin. “Don&#39;t appear too eager to work together,” she told Obama, according to her memoir. “Don&#39;t flatter Putin with high-level attention. Decline his invitation for a presidential-level summit.” The first draft of the memo was written by Sullivan. “It was significantly darker” than the final product, he told me—so much so that “some of the Russia hands in the State Department” had said, “That&#39;s over the top, that&#39;s too far.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;After Clinton&#39;s departure, Sullivan succeeded Blinken as Biden&#39;s Vice-Presidential national-security adviser. The following year, Putin launched a surprise takeover of the Crimean Peninsula and backed a separatist war in eastern Ukraine. In response, Biden and others in the White House urged Obama to provide lethal assistance to Kyiv, such as Javelin antitank weapons, but Obama refused. Blinken and Sullivan disagreed with the decision. “Biden was generally the one that was much more forward-leaning in wanting to take more steps,” one of their NSC colleagues at the time recalled. The same was true of his advisers—“the people,” as the colleague put it, “who are now in the driver&#39;s seat.” Another colleague from the Obama years added, “These are the people from the Obama Administration who thought there were real mistakes.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Sullivan left the White House to serve as the chief policy adviser for Clinton&#39;s 2016 campaign. The morning after her loss, when Clinton stoically spoke of the need to accept Trump&#39;s win—in a speech that Sullivan had stayed up all night writing—he sat in the front row and cried. “There&#39;s nothing I don&#39;t second-guess about 2016,” he told me.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The experience convinced Sullivan that liberal internationalists like himself were an endangered species unless they could reorient their thinking. During the Trump years, he launched a think-tank project with the self-appointed mission of developing a “foreign policy for the middle class.” He emerged notably more skeptical about the benefits of unfettered globalization and free trade, a new position that he stressed as Biden&#39;s top policy adviser during the 2020 campaign.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Biden won the 2020 election not wanting to talk so much about Russia. America&#39;s growing rivalry with China, Blinken said, in an early speech as Secretary of State, now looked to be “the biggest geopolitical test” that the US would face this century. As for Russia, another reset was impossible after Putin&#39;s meddling in the 2016 Presidential election and four years of Trump&#39;s open sycophancy. Instead, Biden&#39;s team settled on a new formula, pinning their hopes on a “stable and predictable” relationship. The word “guardrails” came up often in their planning, according to a former official who was involved in the talks.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In the spring of 2021, when Russia began an ominous military buildup along its border with Ukraine, Biden invited Putin to meet in Geneva. But, by the time of the summit, in June, the threat to Ukraine seemed to have ebbed and Biden focussed on warning Putin against launching further cyberattacks on the US After the meeting, Biden insisted that there was a “genuine prospect” for better relations.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;By then, a more pressing problem was unfolding. In April, Biden had announced the end of the two-decade-long US military presence in Afghanistan, setting a September deadline for all remaining US troops to exit the country. In August, however, the US-backed government in Kabul collapsed. The Biden Administration, believing that such a possibility was months away, had failed to evacuate Afghans who had assisted the US during the conflict. Thousands descended upon the Kabul airport, where the US military organized an emergency airlift. The operation ultimately rescued some hundred and twenty-five thousand people, but only after horrific scenes of chaos and a terrorist attack at the airport&#39;s Abbey Gate, in which thirteen US service members and at least a hundred and seventy Afghans died.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Sullivan came under criticism for the botched withdrawal, with some people calling for him to be fired. Brett Bruen, the director of global engagement for the Obama White House, argued in an op-ed that Sullivan and others were responsible for “the most unnecessarily embarrassing day in the history of the National Security Council.” Sullivan kept his job, but colleagues told me that he had taken this “trial by fire,” as one put it, deeply personally. An after-action report by the State Department chided the Administration for succumbing to groupthink and for its failure to plan adequately for “worst-case scenarios.” “This definitely weighed on Jake very heavily,” Ron Klain, Biden&#39;s first White House chief of staff, told the author Chris Whipple. “Did he give the right advice? Did he push back on the military enough?”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The first secret US intelligence reports about Russia&#39;s plans to invade Ukraine came only a few weeks after the withdrawal from Afghanistan, in early October, 2021. A month later, in a speech to an Australian think tank, Sullivan again spoke about “striving for a more stable, more predictable relationship” with Russia.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;In fact, the stable-and-predictable policy was already dead. A week before the speech, Biden had dispatched Burns, his CIA director, on a secret mission to Moscow. Burns notified the Kremlin that the United States was aware of its intentions and warned of serious consequences if Putin followed through. He returned to Washington convinced that the invasion was going to happen.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Biden&#39;s NSC team was haunted by both the recent catastrophe in Afghanistan and the recollection of Putin&#39;s 2014 takeover of Crimea. “In Crimea, [Russia] created a &lt;em>;fait accompli&lt;/em>; before the world had really fully woken up to what they had done,” Sullivan recalled, in an oral history for Politico. “We wanted to make sure the world was wide awake.” He compared the situation to a scene from the first “Austin Powers” movie, in which “there&#39;s a steamroller on the far side of the room, and a guy standing there, holding up his hand, and shouting, &#39;No!&#39; Then they zoom out, and the steamroller is moving incredibly slowly and is really far away.” He added, “I was determined that we were not going to be that guy—just waiting for the steamroller to roll over Ukraine. We were going to act.”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;u70hd4&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Prewar estimates suggested that Ukraine&#39;s military could hold out against the Russians for no more than a few days. A “tiger team” assembled by Sullivan and his deputy national-security adviser, Jon Finer, met to game out possibilities. “A lot of our planning was worst-case scenario planning,” Sullivan told Politico, “which always psychologically puts one in a tough space.”&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot;

The White House was suddenly improvising a strategy for a long war. But Putin&#39;s increasingly explicit nuclear sabre-rattling meant that the early months of the conflict were spent in arguments over what might or might not cross Russia&#39;s red line. In the spring of 2022, a debate raged in Washington over whether to give Ukraine the precision medium-range missile system known as &lt;em >;HIMARS&lt;/em>;. When Nancy Pelosi, the House Speaker, led a congressional delegation to Kyiv to meet with Zelensky, the Ukrainian President&#39;s “main ask” was for the &lt;em >;HIMARS&lt;/em>;, according to Jason Crow, a House Democrat and a military veteran. Eventually, Biden approved the delivery, with the proviso that the &lt;em >;HIMARS&lt;/em>; not be used to hit targets inside Russia. “I felt like we dragged our feet,” a Democratic senator told me. Ukraine, meanwhile, moved on to the next items on its list. Arguments ensued over tanks, F-16 fighter jets, and longer-range missiles known as &lt;em >;ATACMS&lt;/em>;.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Sullivan, characteristically, knew every side of each issue. “Jake&#39;s a master debater,” one of his former NSC colleagues said. “He constantly wants to test his own propositions.” Advocates of talks with Russia have had an open line to Sullivan and his staff, as have former officials who believe that such talks are akin to selling out Ukraine. “One of the things I genuinely admire about Jake is his willingness to take criticism and input, his willingness to double-check and to ask,” Senator Chris Coons, a Biden confidant from Delaware and a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, told me.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Even officials in the Administration who have, at times, been frustrated with Sullivan told me that they appreciated his openness. “He&#39;s a really good listener, and it can be a strength,” a senior official said. “He wants a real debate, and he fosters that. But the weakness of that is that sometimes he can blow in the wind, and you just get these shocks to the system, like, &#39;Wait, what? We&#39;re doing what now?&#39; ”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Sullivan also studiously avoids any daylight between himself and Biden. “He is very careful not to contradict him,” a former official who worked with Sullivan during the Obama Administration said. “He can guide him, but he can&#39;t contradict him. That&#39;s what a national-security adviser has to do, and Jake has always been very conscious, like frankly any good Washington staffer, of never getting afoul of his principal, and he never does.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Sullivan&#39;s methodical, hyperanalytical style fits with Biden&#39;s career-long tendency to hold on to a decision, to wait and test the angles and find a way to the political center of gravity. But the downside of that approach is evident, too. “There&#39;s a real tendency to paralysis by analysis,” Eric Edelman, a former Under-Secretary of Defense in the Bush Administration, said. “Jake likes to look at every facet of a problem and wants to understand everything. That&#39;s the tragedy of government—you have to make decisions behind a veil of irreducible ignorance.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;By February of this year, it was clear that the war would not be ending anytime soon. Biden decided to travel to Kyiv, in a risky and secret trip, to commemorate the first anniversary of the invasion. During an overnight train ride from the Polish border town of Przemyśl to the Ukrainian capital, Biden and Sullivan sat alone together in a wood-panelled car, with the curtains drawn for security, working on the contours of a longer-term strategy to discuss with Zelensky. Since the previous fall, when Ukraine took back key cities such as Kherson and Kharkiv, the question was not so much whether the Administration had failed to anticipate disaster, as in Afghanistan, but what more it could do to make winning possible. Biden and Sullivan were focussed on two converging challenges—how best to supply Ukraine for a planned spring counter-offensive and how to prepare for the &lt;em >;NATO&lt;/em>; summit in July, in Vilnius, Lithuania, where Zelensky would push for a definitive answer to when Ukraine would be allowed to join the alliance.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Biden was immovable in his opposition to granting &lt;em >;NATO&lt;/em>; membership to Ukraine while the war was ongoing. But, during the ten-hour trip into the war zone, he and Sullivan discussed what they planned to offer Zelensky instead: long-term security guarantees and military assistance akin to what the US has provided to Israel since the nineteen-eighties. Sullivan told me, “We had a long conversation about this in which the President said he wanted to use the meeting in Kyiv to lay out for Zelensky his view that there is a pathway to &lt;em >;NATO&lt;/em>;—it&#39;s not for now, it&#39;s for later—and the bridge to &lt;em >;NATO&lt;/em>; is the Israel model.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;The idea had been germinating in the NSC since mid-January. The arrangement with Israel has been codified and sustained going back to the Reagan Administration by a series of formal memorandums of understanding, which commit the US to providing a certain amount of military aid and weapons over a ten-year period in order to give Israel a “qualitative military edge” in the region. Unlike &lt;em >;NATO&lt;/em>;&#39;s Article 5 commitment, which states that an attack on any one member is an attack on all, there has been no explicit pledge obliging the US to fight on Israel&#39;s behalf if it is attacked.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Such an arrangement would nevertheless send a message to Putin—and to everybody else—that the United States would not abandon Ukraine. The next morning, in a meeting with Zelensky, Biden proposed the “Israel model” for the first time. Later, when he and the Ukrainian President met with the press, Biden framed the trip as a rebuke to Putin. “Putin thought Ukraine was weak and the West was divided,” Biden said. “He thought he could outlast us. I don&#39;t think he&#39;s thinking that right now.” Then he and Zelensky took a stroll through Kyiv, as air-raid sirens blared.&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot;

In May, when Biden travelled to a G-7 summit in Japan, Sullivan pitched Yermak and other national-security advisers on a joint statement of principles outlining a long-term security commitment to Ukraine. The idea was that each country, including the US, would then negotiate its own bilateral memorandum of understanding with Ukraine. (Blinken told me that the US ultimately enlisted twenty-eight other countries.) “We negotiated the hell out of that document,” a senior Administration official said. The White House and some allies, such as Germany, wanted to insure that the statement came from the G-7, and not &lt;em >;NATO&lt;/em>;, “because &lt;em >;NATO&lt;/em>;, we continue to feel, should be kept out of this conflict,” a senior European official told me.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Zelensky, however, continued to lobby for full &lt;em >;NATO&lt;/em>; membership. Otherwise, he believed, even if Ukraine won the war it would exist in a security gray zone, vulnerable to future attack by Russia. A number of &lt;em >;NATO&lt;/em>; allies, especially among the former Soviet-bloc countries, agreed. “The bigger issue is he wanted to make clear throughout that this was not one hundred per cent a substitute for &lt;em >;NATO&lt;/em>;,” the senior Administration official recalled. “Zelensky didn&#39;t want to be told, &#39;That&#39;s it, the door is now closed on you. You&#39;re down an entirely different path and you can never get back on this other path.&#39; ”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Inside the Administration, there was disagreement about how to handle this brewing problem. Some State Department officials prodded the White House to offer more to Ukraine. During a &lt;em >;NATO&lt;/em>; meeting of foreign ministers in early June, in Oslo, Blinken called Biden and Sullivan with the message that the US, along with Germany, risked being perceived as an isolated holdout. “The strong majority felt that it was important that the summit take steps forward on advancing the proposition of Ukraine&#39;s membership and that we could not simply sit on the status quo,” Blinken told me. “And so I reported that back.” &lt;em >;NATO&lt;/em>;&#39;s Secretary-General, Jens Stoltenberg, floated a proposal for what the alliance might offer Ukraine: not yet membership, but a faster track to getting there, in which Ukraine would not be required to first fulfill an elaborate Membership Action Plan, a condition that &lt;em >;NATO&lt;/em>; had imposed on other former Soviet states. When Stoltenberg came to Washington in mid-June, Biden reluctantly agreed to skip the &lt;em >;MAP&lt;/em>;.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;xfl8ji&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Privately, the Ukrainians were hardly thrilled with the proposal. Zelensky was still holding out hope for a concrete commitment to let Ukraine join &lt;em >;NATO&lt;/em>;. A senior diplomatic source told me that the Americans were disappointed by Ukraine&#39;s reaction to the lifting of the &lt;em >;MAP&lt;/em>;: “Like, &#39;What, you don&#39;t see that as a win?&#39; It was so frustrating.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Ukraine&#39;s long-awaited spring offensive began, in June, with high expectations. Publicly, the Administration emphasized what the Pentagon called the “mountain of steel” it had sent to bolster the Ukrainian Army. But Russia had built three lines of defense in key places along the front. The fighting would hark back to the awful trench warfare of the First World War. The Ukrainians, in fact, were expending artillery shells at an unheard-of rate. In the White House, Sullivan and others worried that a shortage would stall the counter-offensive before it could succeed.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Sullivan had warned about this scenario for months. In January, the Ukrainians had worked with the Pentagon on an extensive war game in Wiesbaden to assess their needs. The conclusion was not good: the counter-offensive would require more 155-millimetre rounds than the Pentagon had to offer. By February, Sullivan began to speak of this as the war&#39;s “math problem.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;As Sullivan saw it, there were three potential solutions: dramatically ramp up production; look for additional sources of ammunition around the world; or send Ukraine some of the large stocks of phased-out cluster munitions held in storage by the Pentagon. But the White House learned that it would take months to sufficiently increase production of artillery shells—too late for the counter-offensive. And the State Department was opposed to sending cluster munitions, known as &lt;em >;DPICM&lt;/em>;s, which are outlawed by more than a hundred countries, including many US allies in Europe, because of the civilian casualties they often leave in their wake. That left the hunt for more munitions. Austin and Sullivan began calling leaders across the globe, including in countries, such as South Korea and Israel, that had not been particularly supportive of the war effort. “The decision was made to make a real run at the South Koreans, because they were the allies that had the biggest stockpile,” a senior Pentagon official recalled. Leaked documents revealed that the NSC proposed various creative ways of getting around South Korea&#39;s prohibition on directly selling arms to fuel the conflict; one of these involved having Poland or the US buy the munitions and then send them on to Ukraine.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;But by early summer a secret report from the Pentagon warned that Ukraine risked running out of ammunition sooner than expected and again recommended sending cluster munitions. “We&#39;d reached the end of the road,” the senior Administration official recalled. “Like, if we want to make sure there is not a significant disruption in supply, we have to make this decision right now.” The State Department finally lifted its objections—it was a “very stark choice,” Blinken told me, and the Pentagon&#39;s dire warning was “dispositive”—and the NSC convened a meeting to ratify the decision. “They had to go back to the President and say, Option A is the Ukrainians run out of ammo and the counter-offensive stops, or Option B is you provide &lt;em >;DPICM&lt;/em>;s,” the senior Pentagon official said. In early July, Biden announced the move, which he called “difficult.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In an interview that same day, I asked Sullivan about the Administration&#39;s cycle of “no-no-no-yes” decisions on sending various kinds of military assistance to Ukraine. By this point, even some inside the Administration found the pattern hard to understand. “It&#39;s like the boy who cried wolf,” a senior official had told me. “I just don&#39;t know what to believe anymore. When they say, &#39;No way, we would never look at the &lt;em >;ATACMS&lt;/em>;,&#39; I say, &#39;Is that true?&#39; I do feel I just keep seeing the same movie over and over again.”&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot;

I see the through line you guys are all drawing on the no-no-no-yes thing, but actually each of these has their own distinct logic to them.” To him, the Abrams-tank decision was “about sustaining unity” with Germany. Sometimes the State Department objected, as in the case of the cluster munitions. Sometimes it was the Pentagon or the President personally, as with the &lt;em >;ATACMS&lt;/em>;.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The &lt;em >;ATACMs&lt;/em>; had become a particular sore point. In 2022, Biden had rejected sending them, arguing that, to Putin, they would constitute an unacceptable escalation, since their range, up to a hundred and ninety miles, meant that they could hit targets inside Russia. “Another key goal is to insure that we do not end up in a circumstance where we are heading down the road towards a Third World War,” Sullivan said that summer. But once the British began providing similar missiles, in the spring of 2023, the argument no longer seemed to apply. “What has held us back,” the senior Pentagon official told me this summer, was that doing so would “deplete our stocks at a time when we require those missiles for our own contingencies, whether that be Iran or North Korea or China.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Members of Congress in both parties objected to that reasoning. In June, the House Foreign Affairs Committee passed a bipartisan resolution saying that &lt;em >;ATACMS&lt;/em>; should “immediately” be offered. When officials had told Crow, the Democratic congressman, that sending the &lt;em >;ATACMS&lt;/em>; would affect the Pentagon&#39;s Operations Plan, his response, he said, was “Well, for what future war? The war in Europe is now, and it is being fought by the Ukrainians. So change the goddam &lt;em >;OPLAN&lt;/em>;.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;More broadly, some of Ukraine&#39;s supporters feared that the protracted deliberations had negatively affected the counter-offensive, which, by midsummer, had failed to produce the hoped-for breaches in the Russian lines. “Think about where we might be if things like &lt;em >;HIMARS&lt;/em>;, Stingers, F-16s, &lt;em >;ATACMs&lt;/em>; were over there a year ago,” Dan Sullivan, a senior Republican senator on the Armed Services Committee, told me. “That&#39;s the really big flaw in the execution of their strategy, and it does start to undermine support when people don&#39;t think they&#39;re in it to win it.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;For his part, the national-security adviser seemed to chafe at the view, circulating widely in Washington, that he was the holdup and that others, including Blinken, were more “forward-leaning.” In recent months, Sullivan had taken to saying that, despite all the attention paid to high-tech weapons and fighter jets, there were only two things that Ukraine could not do without: artillery and air defense. This, he said, was why he had been among the loudest voices pushing to approve the cluster munitions, which, he told colleagues, were the most important single assistance the US could give. “He&#39;s frustrated with this perception that he&#39;s the problem,” a former senior US official told me. “It&#39;s completely wrong.”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;0xzpjg&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Blinken told me that the criticism stemmed from a misunderstanding of Sullivan&#39;s role. “I&#39;ve been forward-leaning in advocating to get the Ukrainians different things at different times, but it&#39;s imperative that that be part of a rigorous process,” the Secretary said. “It&#39;s never been, at all, Jake is a brake on this—it&#39;s Jake doing the job the way it&#39;s supposed to be done.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;The former official said that, by December of 2022, Sullivan was trying to get the President to use the threat of sending &lt;em >;atacms&lt;/em>; as leverage with the Russians. “He was pushing Biden: Why don&#39;t we at least say we will send &lt;em >;ATACMS&lt;/em>; unless you stop firing on cities?” the former official told me. “So he&#39;s been making that argument for at least six months now, and the President was not willing to do it. At some point, the President is the President.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Another former senior US official recalled a conversation with Sullivan about whether the US would agree to send F-16s to Ukraine. Sullivan indicated that he was supportive. But, in early 2023, Biden publicly ruled out doing so, at least in the short term. Months later, several European allies agreed, with Biden&#39;s approval, to supply F-16s to Ukraine. It wasn&#39;t until the summer, however, that the US signed off on a plan to train Ukrainian pilots on the fighter jets. The former official told me he had concluded, “The biggest drag on the speed of responding to Ukrainian requests has been the President, not Lloyd Austin, not Tony, not Jake—not the Administration, but the President. Jake is trying to play the role of honest broker, because he&#39;s with the President every day.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Martin Indyk, who served as Obama&#39;s chief Mideast peace negotiator, argued that Biden&#39;s equivocation had real consequences. “They made a big mistake,” he told me. “They self-deterred. That affected every move—that cautious incrementalism which we can now see with the benefit of hindsight was unnecessary.” Indyk, who wrote a book about Henry Kissinger&#39;s Mideast diplomacy, recalled a key moment in the Yom Kippur War, in 1973, when Kissinger, the national-security adviser, was hesitating to send more than three C-5a transport aircraft to Israel. “Nixon famously said, &#39;You know, Henry, we&#39;re going to get blamed and criticized if we send thirty or if we send three,&#39; ” Indyk told me. “So he said, &#39;Send everything that flies. And get on with it.&#39; ” The problem today is that Biden has been more Kissinger than Nixon, Indyk said: “We need him to tell Jake, &#39;Send everything that flies, goddammit, and get on with it.&#39; I think it would have changed the course of the war.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;em >;NATO&lt;/em>; summits are usually staid affairs, with almost everything haggled over and approved in advance. But two things happened in the weeks leading up to the Vilnius summit which disrupted hopes for a smooth rollout. First, in late June, came explosive news from inside Russia: Putin&#39;s mercenary Yevgeny Prigozhin had launched a mutiny. Sullivan cancelled a trip to Denmark to monitor the situation from Washington; he and Biden had just helicoptered to Camp David and arrived at their cabins when word came that Prigozhin had been persuaded to stand down.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Then, a few days later, a phone call between Biden and the German Chancellor, Olaf Scholz, threatened to derail negotiations over the summit&#39;s final communiqué, which would show where &lt;em >;NATO&lt;/em>; stood on the divisive matter of Ukraine&#39;s quest for membership. Scholz, according to four sources with whom I spoke, made clear that he was adamantly opposed to a statement that included a specific “invitation” for Ukraine to join &lt;em >;NATO&lt;/em>;. He also told Biden that he was skeptical of letting Ukraine out of the Membership Action Plan requirement. On that point, Biden refused—he had already agreed to it.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Biden, who prizes his closeness to Scholz—the senior European official described the “extremely warm, brothers-in-arms feeling” between them—agreed to present a joint front with the Germans on the idea of extending a formal invitation to Ukraine. As Scholz saw it, lifting the &lt;em >;MAP&lt;/em>; would be a significant enough show of progress for Ukraine. The senior Administration official recalled, “Biden basically said to Scholz, &#39;Look, I will make sure that, as we go through these negotiations, we aren&#39;t on a kind of a pure slippery slope.&#39; ”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The issue had still not been resolved by the weekend before the summit. That Monday, Sullivan and Blinken signed off on a compromise—an awkward, American-drafted sentence offering an unspecified future “invitation” but nothing to explain how or when Ukraine could obtain it. Another breakthrough came that night, when Turkey&#39;s leader, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, agreed to drop his objections to Sweden&#39;s &lt;em >;NATO&lt;/em>; membership, which he had been stalling almost single-handedly for more than a year.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;But on the morning of Tuesday, July 11th, when leaders were to formally gather in Vilnius, Sullivan sensed trouble during a phone call with Yermak, the Ukrainian chief of staff. Sullivan turned beet red as Yermak told him that the hard-fought language in the communiqué was not enough. After Yermak informed Sullivan that he and Zelensky would soon land in Vilnius and hoped to negotiate final wording, Sullivan responded sharply: this was &lt;em >;NATO&lt;/em>;&#39;s communiqué, he said, not Ukraine&#39;s.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Things soon got worse. Zelensky sent out a tweet blasting the draft for placing “unprecedented and absurd” conditions on Ukraine. He also suggested that the allies were holding out to use Ukraine&#39;s &lt;em >;NATO&lt;/em>; status as a bargaining chip in future negotiations with Russia. Sullivan, who was stunned by the tone of the tweet, left a meeting that Biden was holding with a bipartisan group of senators to call Yermak again. “We literally did this sentence to make them happy,” a senior US official recalled of the moment. Maybe, Sullivan said to Biden, they should remove or replace the carefully negotiated wording. What was the point if the Ukrainians didn&#39;t like it? “I was, like, this whole summit&#39;s going to come crashing down,” the senior diplomatic source said. “I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever seen Jake that angry.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;By that evening, after hours of talks, both Biden and Emmanuel Macron, the French President, among others, objected to making any revisions, and the statement was finalized exactly as it had been before the hours of embarrassingly public discord. For a summit meant to project “unity and zeal” on Ukraine&#39;s behalf, as Sullivan had put it days earlier, it was a mess. The senior European official said the dustup was consistent with the “track record of President Zelensky asking for things which he knows he cannot get,” thus “creating his own disappointment.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The Americans, the senior Administration official told me, went back to the Ukrainians with one last pitch: “Guys, the play&#39;s the same, and it&#39;s a good one for you,” with a promise of &lt;em >;NATO&lt;/em>; membership in the future and bilateral security commitments in the meantime. Zelensky got the message. The next day, he appeared alongside Biden and praised the summit as a “success” for Ukraine. Their meeting, he tweeted, was “meaningful” and “powerful.”&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;a data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a26074&amp;quot;}&quot;

event. Daria Kaleniuk, one of Ukraine&#39;s best-known anti-corruption activists, rose to ask him a question. Wearing a dusty-pink blazer over a black T-shirt emblazoned with the slogan “#Ukraine &lt;em >;NATO&lt;/em>; now,” she confronted Sullivan in starkly personal terms. She had left her eleven-year-old son behind in Kyiv, “sleeping in the corridor because of the air raids,” she said. “Jake, please advise me, what should I tell my son?” Was Biden refusing to allow Ukraine to join &lt;em >;NATO&lt;/em>; “because he is afraid of Russia”? Or because he was engaged in “back-channel communications with the Kremlin,” preparing to sell out Ukraine to Putin?&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;8f2wjc&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Sullivan, looking exhausted, began by talking about the “bravery and courage” of the Ukrainians and how the United States would be there for them “as long as it takes.” But his tone sharpened as he responded to Kaleniuk&#39;s speculation about Biden&#39;s motives, which he called “unfounded and unjustified” and “a lot of conspiracy theorizing that simply is not based on any reality whatsoever.” What&#39;s more, he added, “I think the American people do deserve a degree of gratitude” for their support of Ukraine.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;An audience member told me that there were audible gasps in the room—you don&#39;t tell a mother who&#39;s left her child sheltering from Russian bombs to express more gratitude. Hours later, Sullivan ran into Oleksiy Goncharenko, a member of Ukraine&#39;s parliament, and heatedly complained about the “unfair and unfounded” question.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Kaleniuk, for her part, had no regrets. Sullivan had been described to her as the most important Biden adviser on the war—and also as a “very, very cautious” brake on the advanced weapons, assistance, and &lt;em >;NATO&lt;/em>; membership that Ukraine needed. “It&#39;s just important for Jake to understand it&#39;s not the craziest thing, that actually there are thousands of Ukrainians who have the same perception of how America treats us,” she told me when I reached her in Kyiv. Her biggest fear, she added, was that Washington, despite its support, has no plan for how to insure that Ukraine wins. The &lt;em >;NATO&lt;/em>; summit had only reinforced this concern. “The White House doesn&#39;t have a clear end-game scenario and end-game strategy for this war,” she said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Early on, the Biden team had settled on a response to the inevitable question of how and when there might be a negotiated end to the war: “Nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine.” There would be no separate deal with Russia, they promised. But many Ukrainians, like Kaleniuk, continue to worry that that is exactly where things will end up, with the two nuclear superpowers at the table, settling their country&#39;s fate once again.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Shortly before the Vilnius summit, NBC News reported that Lavrov, the Russian Foreign Minister, had held a secret meeting in New York with former US officials, including Richard Haass, president emeritus of the Council on Foreign Relations. At the time, Sullivan and the Americans were trying to ease Ukraine&#39;s disappointment about &lt;em >;NATO&lt;/em>; membership, and they denied having anything to do with the meeting or with any other secret negotiations with Russia.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Still, a former US official who has met with the Russians during the war told me that the NSC was “fully briefed” both before and after the conversation. I was also told, in June, of an intermediary who was going to the White House with a message from the Kremlin. “The White House wants to see these people,” a former official who has participated in unofficial discussions with the Russians told me. “They want to understand what the Russians are thinking.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;There is little doubt that the Biden Administration has actively considered ways to get Russia to the negotiating table. Last fall, Mark Milley, then the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, publicly expressed his view that the war would likely not be ended on the battlefield. Privately, Sullivan has had extensive discussions about what a peace deal might look like. “My conversations with him all the way through have been about what can you do to eventually bring this war to an end,” an informal adviser of Sullivan&#39;s told me. “There are massive risks that are attendant with continuing to fight a hot war via proxy with the Russians. And the risks aren&#39;t going down. They&#39;re probably going up. So they want to find a way to eventually get to a freeze, to eventually get to a negotiated settlement. But it has to be something that keeps &lt;em >;NATO&lt;/em>; together. It has to be something that doesn&#39;t isolate the Ukrainians or have them go off and undermine everything that&#39;s been done. That&#39;s a hard square to circle.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Talks, if they do occur, are likely to raise tensions further between the US and Ukraine. “The Administration&#39;s policy up to now has been close to unconditional support for Ukraine and essentially a real reluctance to be seen to be at cross-purposes with Ukraine,” Haass told me. “But that policy endures only if there is identity of interests between the United States and Ukraine, and if that were to be the case that would be without historical precedent. If you look at the history—whether the US with South Vietnam, or the US with Israel, or the US with Britain and France during Suez—history is about how you manage disagreement with your allies.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In September, shortly before Zelensky made his second visit to Washington since the invasion, Biden approved sending &lt;em >;ATACMS&lt;/em>; to Ukraine, after nearly a year of resisting the idea. American officials, meanwhile, have held two rounds of formal negotiations with Ukraine over the terms of a memorandum of understanding—Sullivan&#39;s “Israel model.” With Trump barrelling toward the Republican nomination, however, the political support that had once seemed so strong and bipartisan for Ukraine in Washington has been quickly eroding.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;On September 30th, the House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, facing a rebellion from a group of hard-right Trumpists, stripped Ukraine funding from a resolution to temporarily keep the government open. A few days later, Biden asked European leaders, on a call, “not to read too much into it,” Blinken told me, but, within hours, McCarthy was ousted as Speaker by the anti-Ukraine rebels. Now the fate of Ukraine aid, including a White House request for another twenty-four billion dollars, is entirely up in the air. Zelensky, during his recent visit, warned members of the US Senate about the consequences of a cutoff: “If we don&#39;t get the aid, we will lose the war.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Sullivan clearly has profound worries about how this will all play out. Months into the counter-offensive, Ukraine has yet to reclaim much more of its territory; the Administration has been telling members of Congress that the conflict could last three to five years. A grinding war of attrition would be a disaster for both Ukraine and its allies, but a negotiated settlement does not seem possible as long as Putin remains in power. Putin, of course, has every incentive to keep fighting through next year&#39;s US election, with its possibility of a Trump return. And it&#39;s hard to imagine Zelensky going for a deal with Putin, either, given all that Ukraine has sacrificed. Even a Ukrainian victory would present challenges for American foreign policy, since it would “threaten the integrity of the Russian state and the Russian regime and create instability throughout Eurasia,” as one of the former US officials put it to me. Ukraine&#39;s desire to take back occupied Crimea has been a particular concern for Sullivan, who has privately noted the Administration&#39;s assessment that this scenario carries the highest risk of Putin following through on his nuclear threats. In other words, there are few good options.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;khj96&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;“The reason they&#39;ve been so hesitant about escalation is not exactly because they see Russian reprisal as a likely problem,” the former official said. “It&#39;s not like they think, Oh, we&#39;re going to give them &lt;em >;ATACMS&lt;/em>; and then Russia is going to launch an attack against &lt;em >;NATO&lt;/em>;. It&#39;s because they recognize that it&#39;s not going anywhere—that they are fighting a war they can&#39;t afford either to win or lose.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I read this quote to Sullivan during our interview in the Roosevelt Room. “That&#39;s kind of the rap on us,” he acknowledged. “I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a fair one. We&#39;re not fighting for a draw here.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Then he proceeded, once again, to raise and attempt to demolish all the by now familiar arguments. “To be paralyzed by escalation would be terrible, and we have not been paralyzed—we have provided tens of billions of dollars of advanced weapons, intelligence, training, capacity, that has had enormous lethal effect,” he said. “But to be completely cavalier about escalation, to say that to even raise the question makes you a coward, that&#39;s easy to do from the outside, but when you sit in this seat you can&#39;t do that. You have an obligation to the American people to consider worst-case scenarios. That&#39;s our job.” ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 09 Oct 2023 19:06:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Raking Dirt for Art’s Sake]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/10/16/raking-dirt-for-arts-sake]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-09T10:00:00.000Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/652079b9e60c85389b83b125/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/231016_r43182illuweb-site.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;article >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attribute-verso-pattern=&quot;article-body&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;ArticlePageChunks&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;A line snaked along Wooster Street the other day, for a designer sample sale. A few doors down and one floor up, Bill Dilworth stood in a large room filled with two hundred and eighty thousand pounds of dirt, wondering how the two days of watering that he&#39;d just finished had affected the soil.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Just to get it back to this moist state is gratifying to me, because this is the state that I relate to, that I maintained for decades,” Dilworth, who had the knee-high rubber boots of a farmer, the trim-cut jeans of an urbanite, and the eyebrows of a mad scientist, said. He has spent the past thirty-four years caring for “The New York Earth Room,” an installation by the artist Walter De Maria which is part of the Dia Art Foundation&#39;s permanent collection. His chief duties are watering and raking the soil, to keep its color consistent.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Dilworth and his wife moved to New York from Detroit in 1979, and one of his odd jobs was sweeping the basement stairs in a Dia building. When he took over the Earth Room, in 1989, all he was given by way of instruction was a photograph of what it looked like when it was installed, in 1977, for an intended three-month run. (Photographs are not permitted; that image is the only sanctioned one.) The room is thirty-six hundred square feet, filled with dirt twenty-two inches deep. Visitors view it from behind a knee-high glass barrier.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Last year, Dia replenished the soil, which had fallen below the height that the artist wanted—owing to a combination, Dilworth said, of natural causes (“the weight of me walking on it”) and visitors sneaking out with handfuls. The new soil was too dry, so, in January, Dilworth gave it a thorough watering with a hose. The humidity inside interacted with the cold air outside, making the windows stream with condensation. After that, he let the soil dry out for a spell, then watered it again.&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Now he was ready to see what the color looked like beneath the surface. He started in with a clawlike tool called a cultivator. “Oh, my God, it really saturated,” he said, delighted. The earth he was turning over had a uniform dark-chocolate hue. Next, he would try a rake with broad, short tines. (Both tools were on site when he started.) For his first three decades, he had mostly used the cultivator. (“I thought it looked a bit like a rug, so I tried to make it look more like earth.”) Last year, he switched to the rake after Heiner Friedrich, a Dia founder, suggested that he “smooth it out.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Visitors often ask Dilworth what the Earth Room means, and he usually gives them the same answer: “Walter didn&#39;t speak about it, so, whatever your impressions are, that&#39;s valid. Don&#39;t worry about what it&#39;s about. There is no explanation.” He adds that on a return visit “you might have a different take.” In the winter, the dirt is likely to be drier and lighter. In the summer, after watering, it can be “black and loamy.” He likes “the idea that it&#39;s not static.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;If a visitor keeps pushing for an interpretation, Dilworth will say, “It&#39;s about earth, art, and quiet.” It is also about time: “People look at it, and they think nothing&#39;s growing, and I say, &#39;Look at it again, time is growing out there.&#39; ”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;This is Dilworth&#39;s last season with the Earth Room; he plans to retire next spring. (His wife, Patti, recently retired, after decades of caring for another De Maria installation, “The Broken Kilometer,” a couple of blocks away.) In addition to overseeing the dirt, Dilworth buzzes in visitors and supplies Dia with a tally. For years, he kept track using a handheld metal clicker. When there were no visitors, he would retreat to a back room and work on his own art. (One reason he took the job was the free studio space it offered.)&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Over the years, the number of visitors increased. Dilworth needed to find a way to pursue his art while sitting at the front desk. In 2003, he made the process of tallying his new project, creating a visual map of the day, each person marked by a curling black stroke. At one point, he experimented with color: red and green in December; a brief stint of pink for women and blue for men.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;He might try color again for his final season. But first he had to decide how to rake the newly moistened dirt. He eyed two patches he had already raked: a smoother area, from the flat rake, and a textured one, from the cultivator. He opted for the cultivator.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“It&#39;s meant to be unchanging,” he said. “But it&#39;s always been changing.” For years, he had raked from right to left. “Then it occurred to me—why don&#39;t I just rake it the other way.” Years later, another idea: front to back. “Instead of lengthwise, I would go widthwise. I always loved it widthwise, I always felt it was special that way.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“The nice thing about duration and time,” he said, “is that you eventually get to things.” ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;184gw8&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;tj4iqi&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 09 Oct 2023 19:06:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[A Trans Teen in an Anti-Trans State]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/10/16/a-trans-teen-in-an-anti-trans-state]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-09T10:00:00.000Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/651f50effaa4a51aff771bd9/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/231016_r43183.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;article >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attribute-verso-pattern=&quot;article-body&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;ArticlePageChunks&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;On the last morning of July, Kristen Chapman was getting ready to leave Nashville. Chapman, who is in her early fifties and wears her silver hair short, sat on a camp chair next to a fire pit outside the rental duplex where her family had lived for twelve years. She was smoking an American Spirit and swatting at the mosquitoes that kept emerging from the dense green brush behind her. Her husband, Paul, who was wearing a T-shirt with the Guinness logo, carried boxes out to the front lawn. Their daughters, Saoirse and Willow, who were seventeen and fifteen, were inside, still asleep. Chapman looked down at the family&#39;s beagle mix, Obi-Wan Kenobi, who was drinking rainwater out of a plastic bucket. “We got him when we moved in here for the kids,” she said. “He&#39;s never lived anywhere else.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Paul was planning to stay in town; Chapman was heading to Richmond, Virginia, with Saoirse and Willow. Chapman and Paul&#39;s marriage was ending, but the decision to split their family apart had happened abruptly. Willow is trans, and had been on puberty blockers since 2021. In March, Tennessee&#39;s governor, Bill Lee, had signed a bill that banned gender-transition treatment for minors across the state.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;On paper, the law, which went into effect in early July, would allow trans teens like Willow to continue their medical care until March of 2024. But Chapman wasn&#39;t sure they could count on that. Willow was determined to begin taking estrogen when she turned sixteen, in December of 2023, which would allow her to grow into adulthood with feminine characteristics. If she couldn&#39;t continue taking puberty blockers until then, she would begin to go through male puberty, which could mean more surgeries and other procedures later in life.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;At first, the family had hoped that the courts would declare the new law unconstitutional. Federal courts had already done so in at least four other states in 2023, finding that such bans violated the First Amendment and the equal-protection and due-process clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment. But that spring the Pediatric Transgender Clinic at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, where Willow had been receiving care, informed its patients that it was ceasing operations. Seeing this as a bad sign, Chapman set up a GoFundMe page in early May and began planning their departure.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Inside, the apartment was filled with abandoned objects—an old Wi-Fi router, trash bags of unwanted clothes. A Homer Simpson doll in a hula skirt lay forgotten on a windowsill. Chapman, an artist who supplements her income with social work, had recently quit her job as a caseworker. She would need their landlord as a reference to get an apartment, especially because she had bad credit, but the family still owed him back rent. She checked Venmo, waiting on a loan from a friend.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;At six-thirty that morning, Chapman had gone out to her white Dodge SUV and found her younger daughter asleep in the back seat. Willow had gone over to a friend&#39;s house and stayed out late. When she got home, she realized that she had locked herself out. The Dodge&#39;s window had been stuck open for months, so she got in. “Any other human being would have handled this totally differently,” Chapman said, shaking her head.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Willow had gone back to sleep in her room, which she once shared with her brother. (He was a sophomore in college and had already moved out.) The colorful scarves and lights that used to decorate the space had been taken down. When she woke up, she began sifting through what was left. “I feel like I&#39;m ready to say goodbye to it,” she said, looking around. There were drawings scrawled on the wall, a desk spattered in paint. “Most of the stuff in here I&#39;ve trashed.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“It&#39;s like getting a new haircut,” Chapman said. “A fresh palette.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Chapman had chosen Virginia for their new life, she said, because it was still in the South, but there would be “multiple avenues of escape.” Paul worked nights for a large grocery-store chain; Richmond was among the northernmost cities where it had branches, and Chapman thought that at some point he might be able to transfer there. Earlier in the summer, she and Willow had driven to Richmond to see the city, and Chapman had lined up a marketing job. It didn&#39;t pay well, but she knew she wouldn&#39;t get a lease without a job. Willow, who had received her last puberty-blocker shot at the Vanderbilt clinic in late May, was supposed to receive her next one in late August. They didn&#39;t have a lot of time.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Despite having taken puberty blockers for two years, Willow looks her age. She is tall and long-limbed and meticulous about her appearance. That morning, she had on Y2K-revival clothes: wide-legged jeans worn low on the hips with a belt, a patterned tank top, and furry pink Juicy Couture boots. Her blond hair was glossy and straight, her bangs held back with a barrette. She is committed to living her adolescence as a girl regardless of what medical treatment she is allowed to receive. At times she has used silicone prosthetic breasts; attaching them is an onerous process involving spray-on adhesive.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;From a very young age, Willow wore dresses and gravitated toward friendships with girls. Her parents thought that she would likely grow up to be a gay man. As Chapman put it, “We knew she was in the fam.” When a homophobic shooter killed forty-nine people at Pulse, the gay night club in Orlando, in 2016, Willow, who was eight at the time, accompanied her mother to a vigil in Nashville. Willow wrote a long message on a banner in solidarity with the survivors. Chapman took a photo of her there. “It was like she was transfixed,” Chapman remembered. In the sixth grade, Willow went to an all-girl sleepover. A parent overheard the kids discussing gender and sexuality, and told Chapman. Willow says that it was around then that she began to think about her identity. “Pretty much as soon as I knew about, like, conceptualized gender, I knew I wanted to be a girl,” she said. She had been an A student, but her grades started going down. Looking back, Willow struggled to articulate what had happened. “It just got complicated, like with all my stuff physically, it just felt like a mess,” she said.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;She came out to her friends first; then one day, in the spring of 2020, while she was upstairs on her laptop and Chapman was downstairs working, Willow sent her mother a three-word e-mail that said, “I am trans.” Willow told me, “I realized I have to do this sometime if I want to advocate for myself and get what I need to get.” She left it to her mother to inform the rest of the family. Chapman was accepting; Paul was more skeptical. “That&#39;s him, you know—a man of science,” Chapman said. “It wasn&#39;t overly positive or negative.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Willow had already decided on her new name before coming out, and began using it with friends. She was again reluctant to tell her family. “I was, like, I&#39;ll keep that secret,” she said—she had been named at birth for a brother of her father&#39;s who had died, and knew the name was important to him. Her mother found out when another mom referred to Willow by her chosen name. Chapman started using it right away; it took Paul another year.&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;a data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a23219&amp;quot;}&quot;

She was referred to the center&#39;s Pediatric Transgender Clinic. The clinic, which opened in 2018, was part of a broader expansion of gender-affirming care at flagship medical schools in the South that occurred around that time. (Clinics also opened at Duke University, the University of Mississippi, and Emory University, among other schools.) These places “attracted the kind of people who build very trusting relationships with patients and are able to establish not just the clinical competencies but also an inclusive environment,” Jasmine Beach-Ferrara, the executive director of the Campaign for Southern Equality, an advocacy group for LGBTQ rights, told me. “All those things are nothing you can take for granted when seeking medical care in the South.” (Federal funding for health care is often funnelled through state governments, some of which have a history of withholding money from providers that offer abortion and other politicized health services.)&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Care for patients who are experiencing gender dysphoria is highly individualized: some trans kids opt for a purely social transition, changing their names or pronouns; others, like Willow, seek a medical transition, which can be started at the onset of puberty. In Willow&#39;s case, a diagnosis of gender dysphoria had to be verified before pharmaceutical treatment could begin. A course of psychotherapy was accompanied by a physical assessment at Vanderbilt, which included ultrasounds, X-rays, and blood tests. The clinic was following a protocol supported by the Endocrine Society and the World Professional Association for Transgender Health, whereby patients take puberty blockers—which have been used to treat children experiencing early-onset puberty since the nineteen-eighties—to delay the onset of secondary sex characteristics until they are ready to begin taking estrogen or testosterone.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;“I&#39;d always explain it to the families as a pause on puberty, allowing the youth to take a deep breath,” Kimberly Herrmann, a pediatrician and internist at Whitman-Walker Health, a provider in the Washington, DC, area that offers gender-affirming care to patients aged thirteen and over, told me. (Some patients choose to go through their natal puberty.) “All of the data suggests that it is the correct thing to do for a patient with a clear diagnosis,” Izzy Lowell, a doctor who started a telehealth practice for gender-affirming care called QueerMed, said, of taking puberty blockers. “If they are going to develop the body of a grown man, it becomes difficult to undo those changes.”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;dbzuah&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Paul was worried about the blockers&#39; long-term effects on Willow&#39;s health. (Studies have shown that they can affect bone density when used long term, and the protocol for hormone therapy advises doctors to discuss potential risks to fertility and options for fertility preservation.) Chapman thought the risks to Willow&#39;s well-being would be worse if she developed male secondary sex characteristics. In one testimony against the Tennessee ban, an adult trans woman described her adolescence, in which she attempted to present as male, as “a disastrous and torturous experience.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Paul and I talked about it and came to the belief that we wanted her on them as quickly as possible for safety reasons,” Chapman said. “I hate that that&#39;s true, but we know that&#39;s the world that we live in, and that she is going to be a safer person for the rest of her life if she does not look male.” (A recent analysis of crime statistics from 2017 and 2018 found that transgender people are more than four times as likely as cisgender people to be the victims of a violent crime.)&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The evaluation and diagnosis took almost a year. For Willow, the talk therapy was the most taxing part. Willow was insured through the state&#39;s Medicaid program, TennCare, which meant that there were only a limited number of therapists she could see, none of whom were trans, or even queer. She went through three in a year. “We were in the lowest tier of care,” Chapman said, adding that at least one therapist dropped their health insurance. Willow told her mother that she wished she could just be left alone to be a “sad trans girl.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;At the age of thirteen, she was finally able to start puberty blockers. “You have an end goal,” Willow said of the experience. “And all the in-between doesn&#39;t matter.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In September, 2022, the conservative commentator and anti-trans activist Matt Walsh, who moved to Nashville in 2020 (along with his employer, the conservative news company the Daily Wire), posted a thread on Twitter. “Vanderbilt drugs, chemically castrates, and performs double mastectomies on minors,” it began. “But it gets worse.” Walsh—who is the author of books including “Church of Cowards: A Wake-Up Call to Complacent Christians” and “What Is a Woman?,” a polemic arguing that gender roles are biologically determined—worked in conservative talk radio before being hired by the Daily Wire as a writer, in 2017. Last year, the left-wing watchdog group Media Matters for America mapped Walsh&#39;s origins as an aspiring radio shock jock in the early twenty-tens who once said, “We probably lost our republic after Reconstruction.” In 2022, he was one of several right-wing social-media pundits who began broadcasting misinformation about hospitals that provided gender-transition treatment for minors, which were then overwhelmed with phone and e-mail threats and online harassment. One study found that more than fifteen hospitals modified or took down Web sites about pediatric gender care after being named in these campaigns.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Walsh included in his thread about Vanderbilt a video clip of Shayne Taylor, the medical director of its Transgender Clinic, speaking of top and bottom surgeries as a potential “money-maker” for the hospital. Walsh did not specify that Taylor was mostly speaking about adults. (Vanderbilt never performed genital surgery on underage patients and did an average of five top surgeries a year on minors, with a minimum age of sixteen.) More than sixty Republican state legislators signed a letter to Vanderbilt describing the clinic&#39;s practices “as nothing less than abuse.” In a statement calling for an investigation, Governor Lee, who was up for reëlection, said that “we should not allow permanent, life-altering decisions that hurt children.” Within days, Vanderbilt announced that it would put a pause on surgeries for minors. Jonathan Skrmetti, Tennessee&#39;s Republican attorney general, began an inquiry into whether Vanderbilt had manipulated billing codes to avoid limitations on insurance coverage.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In October, Walsh and other anti-trans advocates held a “Rally to End Child Mutilation” in Nashville&#39;s War Memorial Plaza. The speakers included the Tennessee senator Marsha Blackburn, the former Democratic Presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard, and Chloe Cole, a nineteen-year-old self-described “former trans kid.” After identifying as male from the age of twelve, receiving testosterone, and getting top surgery, Cole de-transitioned to female at sixteen and is now one of the country&#39;s foremost youth advocates of bans on gender-transition treatment for minors. “I was allowed to make an adult decision as a traumatized fifteen-year-old,” she said at the rally.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;For the past four years, the number of anti-trans bills proposed throughout the United States has dramatically risen. The ACLU has counted some four hundred and ninety-six proposals in state legislatures in 2023, eighty-four of which have been signed into law. The first state ban on gender-transition treatment for minors was passed in Arkansas in 2021. It was permanently blocked by a federal judge this year, but more than twenty states have passed similar laws since then. As lawsuits filed by the ACLU, Lambda Legal, and other organizations make their way through the courts, trans people are left to navigate a shifting legal landscape that activists say has affected clinical and pharmaceutical access. Lowell told me that she consults with six lawyers (including one she keeps on retainer) to best advise patients, who must frequently drive across state borders to receive care. “It&#39;s literally a daily task to figure out what&#39;s legal where,” she said.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;In Tennessee, the Human Rights Campaign has counted the passage of at least nineteen anti-LGBTQ laws since 2015, among the most in the nation. Some of these laws have been found unconstitutional, such as a ban on drag shows in public spaces and a law that would have required any business to post a warning if it let transgender people use their preferred rest room. But many others have gone into effect, such as laws that censor school curricula and ban transgender youth from playing on the sports teams that align with their identity.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Proposals to ban gender-transition treatment for minors were the first bills introduced in the opening legislative sessions of the Tennessee House and Senate in November, 2022. “It was Matt Walsh who lit a fire under the ultraconservative wing of the Republican Party this year,” Chris Sanders, the director of a Nashville-based LGBTQ advocacy group called Tennessee Equality Project, told me. “It was lightning speed the way it all unfolded.” At hearings throughout the winter, parents of trans kids, trans adults, trans youth, and a Memphis pediatrician who provides gender-affirming care testified against the ban. Those who spoke in support of it included Walsh, Cole (who is from California), and a right-wing Tennessee physician named Omar Hamada, who compared such treatment to letting a minor who wanted to become a pirate get a limb and one eye removed.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;LGBTQ activists who attended described feeling disregarded by the Republican majority. Molly Quinn, the executive director of OUTMemphis, a nonprofit that helps trans youth navigate their health care, likened the experience to “being the only queer kid at a frat party.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Three months after Governor Lee signed the ban, Vanderbilt University Medical Center informed patients that the previous November, at the attorney general&#39;s request, it had shared non-anonymized patient records from the Pediatric Transgender Clinic, including photographic documentation and mental-health assessments. “I immediately started hearing from parents,” Sanders said. Their fear stemmed in part from attempts in states like Texas to have the parents of trans kids investigated by child-protective services. (The attorney general&#39;s office said in a statement that it is “legally bound to maintain the medical records in the strictest confidence, which it does.”) Former patients have sued Vanderbilt, and a federal investigation by the Department of Health and Human Services is also under way. (A spokesperson for Vanderbilt declined to comment for this article.)&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In July, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals became the first federal court in the country to allow a ban on gender-transition treatment for minors to take effect, with a final ruling planned for September. Chapman, who had spoken out for trans rights through local media outlets, and had been targeted with online threats and menacing phone calls in return, understood that Tennessee, where she had lived for most of the past thirty-five years, had become a hostile environment for her family. “I genuinely feel we are being run out of town on a rail,” she said. “I am not being dramatic. It is not my imagination.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;It was dusk by the time Paul had loaded the last of the boxes into three storage pods. Everything was ready, but the family was having trouble leaving. Someone would walk out of the house and get into the car, only to go back into the house five minutes later. Chapman suddenly remembered that she had forgotten to buy padlocks for the storage pods, which were scheduled to be picked up by U-Haul the next day. As she drove off to get them, Paul sat on the back steps and stared out at the lawn. Fireflies were winking on and off over the grass.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Bollocks,” he said to himself, then stood up and went inside.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Although comprehensive demographic data on transgender youth are scarce, the American Academy of Pediatrics has reported that “research increasingly suggests that familial acceptance or rejection ultimately has little influence on the gender identity of youth.” But without parental consent most kids in America who wish to transition medically are legally unable to do so until they turn eighteen. Having a supportive parent or guardian as a trans child is more than a legal or practical advantage, though. A study of eighty-four youth in Ontario, aged sixteen to twenty-four, who identified as trans and had come out to their parents found that the rate of attempted suicide was four per cent among those whose parents were strongly supportive but that nearly sixty per cent of respondents who described their parents as not supportive had attempted suicide in the previous year.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Chapman&#39;s decision to support her daughter grew in part out of her own experience as a black sheep in a deeply religious family. She was born in East Tennessee to a Baptist minister and his wife and had an itinerant upbringing, moving around the South. The last words her grandfather, who was also a Baptist minister, said to her were “I&#39;m so sorry I&#39;m not gonna see you in Heaven.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Paul was raised in Dublin, Ireland, as the youngest of twelve children in a Catholic family. “We both came from communities that were super fundamentalist,” Chapman said. They agreed that they would raise their children outside of any religious tradition. If they had a doctrine, Chapman said, it was “critical thinking.” They brought their kids to Black Lives Matter demonstrations, and took them to hear the Georgia congressman and civil-rights activist John Lewis speak. But Paul and Kristen would also listen to the far-right radio host Rush Limbaugh, to know what the other side was saying. As the children got older, Paul and Kristen started to have different visions of the future—Kristen wanted to buy an RV and travel the country, and Paul wanted to buy a house. In 2019, they decided to separate, but they couldn&#39;t afford to split their family into two households.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;2ct6if&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Paul at first had trouble understanding how Willow could decide about her gender so young. Kristen would argue, “If a person presents and says, &#39;This is who I am,&#39; it is not your job to unpack that.” In the end, it was by talking to two trans women—a co-worker in her fifties and a twentysomething bartender at the pub he frequented—that Paul came to understand his daughter better. “Reading online was too much right-wing or left-wing,” he said. “I needed something more grounded.” The bartender told him that her father had rejected her, and that she had scars on her arms from self-harm. “I said, no matter what, I wasn&#39;t doing that,” Paul recalled.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Willow had told me that one of the hardest parts of leaving town was doing so while her relationship to her father was still evolving. “I feel like my biggest unfinished business is that relationship,” she said the day before the move, over boba tea in a strip mall called Plaza Mariachi. “I think I&#39;ve dealt with it. We&#39;ll talk on the phone. Even if we don&#39;t have an in-person connection, I think we&#39;ll be OK”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Once they all managed to leave the house for the last time, Paul gave Chapman and each daughter a hundred dollars in cash as a parting gift. The family had dinner at Panera Bread, then sat for a while at a nearby park. Paul cancelled two Lyfts before finally getting in one and heading to the pub, where he would try to process the day. Chapman and the girls got in the white Dodge and took I-24 out of Nashville.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;LGBTQ-rights activists around the country have seen the sudden uptick in bills targeting transgender identity as a strategy to rally conservative voters after the legalization of gay marriage and the criminalization of abortion. “There was an inordinate amount of money and attention and huge far-right groups, many of which have been deemed hate groups, focussed on keeping us as LGBTQ people from getting married, right?” Simone Chriss, a Florida-based lawyer, told me. Chriss is representing trans people in several lawsuits against the state over its restrictions on gender-affirming care. She observed that, after the Supreme Court legalized gay marriage, in 2015, “all of the people singularly focussed on that needed something else to focus on.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;She recalled watching as model legislation propagated by groups such as the Alliance Defending Freedom and the Family Research Council targeted trans people&#39;s freedom to use bathrooms of their choice, and to play on their preferred sports teams. Health care came next. “All of a sudden, you see this surge in gender-affirming-care bills,” Chriss said. “And what&#39;s bananas is there was not a single bill introduced in a single state legislature prior to 2018.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The anti-trans rhetoric about protecting children mirrored that of the anti-gay-marriage movement, she continued, and new rules mandating waiting periods, for example, were familiar from the anti-abortion movement. “It&#39;s like dipping a toe in by making it about trans children,” she said. “I think the goal is the erasure of trans people, in part by erasing the health care that allows them to live authentically.”&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot;

(The Williams Institute at UCLA estimates that there are more than a hundred thousand thirteen-to-seventeen-year-olds who identify as trans living in the South, more than in any other region in the country.) Already, university hospitals such as the University of Mississippi Medical Center and the Medical University of South Carolina have discontinued their pediatric gender services before being legally required to do so.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Had Chapman stayed in Tennessee, Willow&#39;s closest option for getting puberty-blocker shots would likely have required a four-hundred-and-fifty-mile trip to Peoria, Illinois. Willow&#39;s TennCare insurance would not easily travel, and a single shot can cost twelve hundred dollars out of pocket. Paul had told Chapman not to be ashamed if the move didn&#39;t work out and she changed her mind, but she already knew she would never go back to Nashville.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;On their way east, the family stopped for a few days in Seneca, South Carolina, where Chapman has relatives. Back on the road, she tried not to focus on the uncertainty that awaited her and her daughters, but she had to pull over at least twice to breathe her way through anxiety attacks. There was a heat wave, and by the time they arrived in Richmond the back speakers of the SUV were blown out, and everyone was in a bad mood. Willow had snapped at her mother and Saoirse for trying to sing along to the Cranberries; she had even yelled at the dog. “It was difficult?” Willow told me afterward, when I asked how the trip had been; then she added, “I&#39;m still excited.” (Saoirse declined to be interviewed.)&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Chapman had booked an Airbnb, a dusty-blue bungalow outside Richmond. It had good air-conditioning and a small back yard for the dog. She could afford only a week there before they would have to move to a motel. That night, Willow zoned out to old episodes of “RuPaul&#39;s Drag Race” in the living room, while Chapman scrolled through real-estate listings on her phone. She asked for advice on the social-media feeds of local LGBTQ groups, and the responses were heartening. She decided that, if she was able to find a place to live by the end of the week, she would not take the marketing job she had lined up. School wouldn&#39;t start for a few weeks, and it was not the right moment to leave her daughters alone all day.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;At eight the next morning, Chapman was sitting in an otherwise empty waiting room at the Southside Community Services Center, filling out forms to get the family food stamps and health insurance. She had put on makeup for the first time in days and was wearing wide-legged leopard-print pants and a black shirt. She had forgotten her reading glasses, however. “Do you have a spouse who does not live at home?” she read out loud, squinting her way through the questions. “Yes,” she answered to herself, checking a box. (She and Paul are not yet divorced.)&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Chapman kept mistakenly writing “Willow” on the government forms—she had never officially changed her daughter&#39;s name. (A 1977 Tennessee state law that prohibits amending one&#39;s gender on a birth certificate will apply to Willow no matter where she moves; another Tennessee law, which went into effect this past July, bans people from changing the gender on their driver&#39;s license.) Chapman picked up the next batch of forms, for Medicaid. “One down, one to go,” she said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Later in the day, Chapman and her daughters went to see a house that was advertised on Craigslist, an affordable three-bedroom in the suburbs of Richmond. As they were driving, the owner texted Chapman that he had a flat tire and couldn&#39;t meet them. But the place looked ideal from the outside, so she filled out an application and sent the landlord a thousand-dollar deposit. At five the next morning, she woke up and saw a text from the owner claiming that the money transfer had not gone through. She quickly realized she&#39;d been scammed.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Chapman became weepy. She posted on social media about the con, then drove Saoirse to a thrift store she wanted to visit. At first, only one shopper noticed the woman crying uncontrollably in the furniture section. Then someone went to find some tissues, and someone else brought water. Soon, Chapman recalled, she was surrounded by women murmuring words of sympathy.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;That evening at the Airbnb, Chapman and Willow sat at the kitchen table. “The emotional impact of the scam hit me way more than the money,” Chapman said, still tearing up at the thought of it. Willow nodded in sympathy. But for Chapman the experience was also a reminder of the advantages of talking about their situation—the women had told her that the schools near the house were not very good, anyway. “Thrift-store people will help you when you&#39;re down and out. They&#39;re used to broken shit,” she said, shaking her head. “If I had broke down in a Macy&#39;s? Think how different the reaction would be.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The next morning, Chapman was feeling a little less pessimistic. The humidity had broken, and the weather was good. People had responded to the news of the scam by donating money to replace what she had lost, and a local Facebook group had led her to a property-management company that was flexible toward tenants with bad credit.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;She drove to see a three-bedroom apartment in a centrally situated part of Richmond. Though one of the bedrooms was windowless, the place was newly painted, and it had a wooden landing out back that could serve as a deck. It was also in a school district that people had recommended. “I can see this working,” Chapman said tentatively. Most of the utilities were included in the sixteen-hundred-and-fifty-dollar rent. Chapman didn&#39;t have time to overthink it. She wrote the real-estate agent saying she would apply.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;That afternoon, Chapman drove Willow to see the apartment. The door was locked, but Willow climbed through a window and opened the door so they could consider the space together. “We were, like, &#39;Oh, this is nice,&#39; ” Willow said. She loved the neighborhood, which had vintage stores and coffee shops. “You can walk anywhere, you don&#39;t need transportation—that&#39;s really cool.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The next day, Willow was sitting on a couch in the Airbnb watching a slasher film called “Terrifier.” Chapman was next to her, getting ready for a Zoom call with someone from a local trans-rights organization called He She Ze and We.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In the weeks leading up to the move, Chapman had taken time to research which schools were friendly to trans people. Willow estimated that maybe half the students in her middle school in Nashville were transphobic, and twenty per cent were explicit about it. She was bullied, but she says that it didn&#39;t bother her. Her teachers were more supportive, such as the one who gave her an entire Lilith Fair-era wardrobe. “She was, like, &#39;Do you want some of my old clothes? Because you&#39;re so fashion,&#39; ” Willow said. “I had that black little bob.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;“She had Siouxsie Sioux hair for a while,” Chapman said, looking at her fondly.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The two of them agree that Willow&#39;s personality shifted after transitioning. Once withdrawn and nonconfrontational, she began to develop a defiant attitude. “It was kind of fun to just mess with them,” she recalled of the bullies, who she said were not vicious but more into trying to get a laugh—“like, childish, immature stuff.” She would be coy; she would tell them to give her a kiss. “My only weapon, I guess, was how I chose to respond,” she said.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;hm4h5p&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;“She&#39;s not a shrinking violet,” her mother added.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“I just don&#39;t like the traditional way that you&#39;re taught to stand up for yourself,” Willow said. “I think absurdism is the best way.” If she lets someone misgender her, she said, “it&#39;s not because I don&#39;t want to be the annoying trans person, it&#39;s more like . 。 。 you&#39;re not gonna get to those people.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In her freshman year, she attended a public arts high school, and began skipping class and smoking. She says there were at least ten other students who identified as trans, but she remained something of an outsider. When she was in school, she says, she almost thought of herself as a kind of character expected to perform.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Chapman is not a disciplinarian—she had enough of that growing up. But she had a conversation with her daughter after watching a video of an incident in which Willow was voguing in a school hallway, attempted to do a death drop, and ended up with a concussion. The students around Willow were clapping and egging her on even after she fell. “It&#39;s great that you&#39;re the kind of person who will do crazy things,” Chapman remembered saying, “but you need people around you who are not like that.” Both Chapman and Paul worry about Willow&#39;s safety, in part because she is not easily scared herself.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Will you turn that off?” Chapman said now about the horror film, as she logged on to Zoom. Willow took that as a cue to leave the room.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“You&#39;re going to want to be on this thing,” Chapman said, calling her back.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Willow, who wore blue eyeshadow, a purple baby tee with a peace sign and the word “Smile!” on it, and magenta-pink shorts, plopped back down on the couch, then got up to retrieve supplies to disinfect her belly-button piercing, which she began to do with studiousness.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;On Zoom, Chapman introduced herself to Shannon McKay, the co-founder of He She Ze and We, and gave a summary of their situation.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Have you gotten connected with the medical piece yet?” McKay asked. She explained that, in Virginia, Willow might not have to wait until she turned sixteen to start estrogen. At this news, Willow looked up and made eye contact with her mother, who nodded back.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The conversation turned to politics. Earlier in the week, Glenn Youngkin, the Republican governor of Virginia, had held a town hall on parents&#39; rights at a school in Henrico County. A parent there had urged Youngkin to introduce a ban on gender-transition treatment for minors.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Our governor, just to let you know, has not taken a stance,” McKay, who also has a trans daughter, explained to Chapman. “And I think he&#39;s not conservative enough for the folks that wish he would be.”&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot;

Chapman asked McKay if that gave her some control over how Willow would be treated at school.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“The clincher here is, even if all parents involved do fill out the form and say, &#39;We&#39;re all on board,&#39; school personnel can still say, &#39;I don&#39;t believe in that. I&#39;m not going to do it,&#39; ” McKay said. She did have some good news, however: if Willow learned to drive, she could determine the name and gender on her identification card.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“I&#39;m not ready for it,” Chapman said, referring to the driving.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;“Well, before this governor messes it up, I encourage people to go ahead and get these documents lined up,” McKay said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Chapman got the apartment she and Willow had visited, and a few days later the family moved in. Willow started at her new school on Tuesday, August 22nd. She made friends with another trans girl in the first week. But, despite a letter from Chapman specifying Willow&#39;s name and pronouns, school administrators told her they had to use the name on her registration. She was also told she should use the nurse&#39;s bathroom instead of the girls&#39; bathroom, even though it was on a different floor and might cause her to be late to class. Willow ignored that rule, and asked her mother not to intervene on her behalf.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Before the school year had begun, Chapman told me that if school didn&#39;t work out she would be fine with her daughter getting a GED When I asked Willow about the future, she said that she wants to move to New York City. She wants to go to the balls, “maybe be a model, I don&#39;t know,” she continued. “I like doing art. I like meeting people. I don&#39;t know how to connect all of those things and get paid.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“You care more about personal freedom than hitting a milestone,” Chapman said. “You care less about the traditional high-school things, the traditional college things.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“I feel like I &lt;em>;should&lt;/em>; care about them,” Willow said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Oh!” Chapman said, looking surprised. “I like hearing that.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“I&#39;m open—like, I could potentially care about them, but if it&#39;s not welcoming me then I won&#39;t,” Willow said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The day in August when Willow needed her puberty-blocker shot came and went. The family&#39;s insurance still had not come through, and the earliest appointment Chapman could get at a clinic with tiered pricing was in mid-September. An administrator at the clinic assured her that there was a window with puberty blockers, and that Willow&#39;s voice would not drop overnight.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I talked to Chapman the evening after the appointment. “We thought we were just going in for an intake, but they started Willow on estrogen today,” Chapman told me over the phone. “The doctor was in shock that Willow had been on puberty blockers for two years and that she was almost sixteen.” (“It&#39;s really hard for cis people to fully appreciate the deep destabilizing physical betrayal that these kids are navigating on a day-to-day basis,” the doctor, Stephanie Arnold, told me. “It&#39;s a period where you should be establishing confidence in yourself and your ability to interact with the outside world.”) Willow, Chapman added, “is over the moon.” They called Paul to let him know. “After every fucking thing . 。 。 it just happened,” she said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The following Monday, Chapman started a new job, counselling people on signing up for Medicaid. She was earning less than she had in Nashville, but hoped to rebuild her career as an artist and a community organizer.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;The family was getting to know Richmond, with its restored Victorian row houses and stately parks. Using the hundred dollars from her father, Willow had bought herself a skateboard to get around town. Paul was planning a visit for October. “This city is just dang cute, let&#39;s be honest,” Chapman said. They had found a leftist bookstore where she had bought Willow a book of poetry by trans writers. When I asked Willow how she felt on estrogen, she said that it was too early to discern any changes with clarity; what she felt, she said, was more vulnerable. A little more than a month in, Willow said that she was liking her new school and had even attended the homecoming dance. “And my grades are OK,” she added. “So that&#39;s something.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;On September 28th, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the ban on gender-transition treatment for minors in Tennessee. The court found, among other things, that state legislatures can determine whether the risks of gender dysphoria are less significant than the risks of treating it before a patient turns eighteen. A dissenting opinion stated, “The statutes we consider today discriminate based on sex and gender conformity and intrude on the well-established province of parents to make medical decisions for their minor children.” Because the federal appeals courts have split in their findings, with other circuits finding such bans unconstitutional, the issue has the potential to proceed to the Supreme Court.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“I know what&#39;s going on,” Willow had said, when I asked her about politics. She doesn&#39;t see herself as an activist, though; she prefers to let the news filter through her mother rather than to consume it herself: “She&#39;s my person on the inside.” ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 09 Oct 2023 19:06:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“The Choc-Ice Woman,” by Mary Costello]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/10/16/the-choc-ice-woman-fiction-mary-costello]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-09T10:00:00.000Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/651d9aa06814f7b281e47e34/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/231016_r43167web.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;article >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attribute-verso-pattern=&quot;article-body&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;ArticlePageChunks&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;figure data-testid=&quot;IframeEmbed&quot; >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;IframeEmbedContainer&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;svg focusable=&quot;false&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 12 12&quot; width=&quot;32&quot; height=&quot;32&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Audio available&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M6 0C2.68573 0 0 2.68573 0 6V8.73736C0 10.5187 1.48129 12 3.26262 12H3.78785V11.0578C4.2899 10.8595 4.60907 10.3691 4.60907 9.8323V7.64241C4.60907 7.10556 4.28989 6.61524 3.78785 6.41698V5.47476H3.26262C2.39306 5.47476 1.62721 5.79438 1.05047 6.32323V6C1.05047 3.29202 3.29202 1.05047 6 1.05047C8.70797 1.05047 10.9495 3.29202 10.9495 6V6.32323C10.3728 5.79438 9.6069 5.47476 8.73736 5.47476H8.21216V6.41698C7.71013 6.61524 7.39092 7.10555 7.39092 7.64241V9.8323C7.39092 10.3692 7.71012 10.8595 8.21216 11.0578V12H8.73736C10.5187 12 12 10.5187 12 8.73736V6C12 2.68573 9.31422 0 6 0Z&quot; fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; clip-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;Listen to this story&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;iframe height=&quot;60&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; sandbox=&quot;allow-scripts allow-same-origin&quot; title=&quot;Embedded Frame&quot; data-src=&quot;https://www.wnyc.org/widgets/ondemand_player/thenewyorker/#file=https://downloads.newyorker.com/mp3/231016_costello_audio.mp3&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay *; encrypted-media *; clipboard-write; autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture&quot;>;&lt;/iframe>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;p>;Mary Costello reads.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;p >;Frances had never been in a hearse before. Mr. O&#39;Shea, the undertaker, pulled out into traffic and set off down North Circular Road, past the women&#39;s wing of Mountjoy Prison and the library at Eglinton Terrace, where she had been a librarian for twelve years before her retirement. She was grateful for the hum of the engine, the city outside. She kept herself apart, mentally, from Mr. O&#39;Shea. She forgot, briefly, about the coffin with the remains of her brother Denis behind her until the hearse braked going downhill and she had a vision of it crashing through the glass partition and slamming into them.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Are you all right there?” Mr. O&#39;Shea asked at the traffic light.&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;“I am, thanks,” she replied.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Is it warm enough?

The coffin had already been loaded and the paperwork completed when she and Frank arrived.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;“We can head off so, if ye&#39;re ready?” Mr. O&#39;Shea had said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“I&#39;ll go in the hearse with you,” she&#39;d said suddenly.

Without another word, she&#39;d gone around to the passenger side and got in.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;They were crossing the Liffey at Islandbridge now.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“I know it&#39;s usually a man from the family that travels in the hearse,” she continued. “Or at least that used to be the tradition. But I don&#39;t drive, you see, so if Frank went with you there&#39;d be no one to drive the car home.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“That&#39;s no problem at all,” Mr. O&#39;Shea said. “And, as for traditions, aren&#39;t they changing all the time?”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;He checked the rearview mirror. “Frank is close enough behind us, anyway. We&#39;ll probably get separated along the way but what harm—aren&#39;t we all going to the same place?”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;They were passing Inchicore. An old woman, pulling a wheelie shopper, stopped at a letter box. “We should be in Kerry by five o&#39;clock, all going well,” Mr. O&#39;Shea said.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;The woman was trying to push a brown package into the letter box, her white hair tossing wildly in the wind.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;“Is that all right?” Mr. O&#39;Shea asked.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Yes, yes.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The more he talked, the harder it would be to keep herself separate.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“The woman who does the embalming,” he said, a little tentatively, “will be coming in at half past six. How would ye be fixed . 。 。 would ye be able to get his clothes in to us then? If I&#39;m not there myself, Anne, my wife, will take them in.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Denis&#39;s suit had hung in his wardrobe for decades. He had last worn it to the funerals of their parents. He had not attended their brother Patrick&#39;s funeral.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“That&#39;s no problem. Frank will drop them in.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;A strange occupation for a woman, embalming, she thought. She wondered if Mr. O&#39;Shea&#39;s wife assisted. The two women packing cotton wool into orifices.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;“Are all corpses embalmed? Is it absolutely necessary?” she asked.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Well . 。 。 I suppose it&#39;s not &lt;em>;absolutely&lt;/em>; necessary,” Mr. O&#39;Shea said. “Some cultures don&#39;t do it, but then they tend to bury their dead very quickly. It&#39;s the done thing nowadays. It makes things a lot easier for the family—it removes a lot of the difficulties, the . 。 。 unpleasantness. It&#39;s best for the deceased, too.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Stitching up his tongue? I don&#39;t think so, Frances wanted to say.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Will I send in his socks and . 。 。 everything?” she asked.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Yes, everything . 。 。 except the shoes. We don&#39;t usually put shoes on.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;For two weeks she had been at Denis&#39;s bedside in the Mater hospital, leaving only after 10 &lt;em >;pm&lt;/em>; to return to her B. and B. on Drumcondra Road. In the past two days he had not spoken or opened his eyes, and his breathing had grown shallower and shallower. She&#39;d had an inkling last night, and felt that she should stay longer, but the nurse had assured her that he could last for several more days. Before she reached the B. and B., her phone rang. When she got back to the hospital, it was over and he had been moved to a private room with tea lights, a crucifix, and a leaflet for bereaved relatives placed on a side table. They had stretched a flesh-colored band, like an elastic stocking, around his head to keep his mouth closed. She kissed the top of his head and touched his cold hands, his nose, expecting to feel something. She thought of him as no longer alive but not yet dead. She whispered his name, but in the silence of the room it sounded contrived. She tried to summon the past. Denis and Patrick were twelve years older than Frances. Denis had been a fleeting presence in her early childhood. Home from Dublin one Christmas when she was eight or nine, he brought her a red plastic tea set, six Jaffa oranges wrapped individually in tissue paper, and a box of cornflakes, because cornflakes were a rare treat then. Not long afterward, he&#39;d come home for good, and seldom left his room.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Already he was changing before her eyes. His face was collapsing inward, leaving his nose looking pointed, like a bird&#39;s beak. The body was dissolving, every cell disintegrating. His soul had probably left his body by now, she thought. Where had she been—running down Drumcondra Road or along Dorset Street—when that happened, when his blood ebbed to a halt and his consciousness slowly shut down? It is easier to track the body&#39;s exit, she thought, than the exit of the mind. There is no knowing what the mind suffers in the final hours and minutes. In the moments before her mother took her last breath, she opened her eyes wide with a petrified look, as if she were seeing something terrible, but twenty-four hours later her face was serene, as if all the pain of existence had left her.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;A nurse arrived to say they would soon need to take Denis to the morgue. Frances went down to the foyer and called Frank. “Denis is gone,” she said. She did not wait for his response. “Will you ring O&#39;Shea to come up and bring him home tomorrow.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Frank was silent for a few moments. “I&#39;m sorry, Frances.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;“And ring the priest as well.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Will I come up tonight?” he asked.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“No, wait till the morning.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Every morning for years she had walked down Drumcondra Road—past the open gates of St. Patrick&#39;s College, where Denis had trained as a teacher decades before—on her way to work at the library in Phibsborough. The walk took forty-five minutes. She arrived an hour before opening time and put out the newspapers and the latest magazines, and logged returns and worked at her computer, checking orders and book-club requests. She had worked alongside first one, then another assistant librarian, but never developed a close friendship with either. At lunchtime during the summer months, she sat on the grass in the little park behind the library and read her book and ate her sandwich. The afternoons, when the schoolchildren arrived, were busiest in the library. She did not mind the older, studious ones, but the truth was she barely tolerated children in her library. She abhorred the way libraries had changed, the way some of the bigger city libraries resembled community centers or crèches, such was the level of noise and activity. Since when can toddlers read? she wanted to know. After work, she locked up and took the 16A bus home.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;One day four years ago, on the eve of Frances&#39;s sixtieth birthday, Patrick had come in from the fields, sat at the kitchen table, and slumped over. Denis had gone to the hall, picked up the phone, and called Frances at the library. “I think Patrick is gone,” he said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;For a while after Patrick&#39;s death, a neighbor had checked on Denis every day, but he could not be left alone, and so, after thirty-nine years&#39; service with Dublin City Libraries, Frances retired from her job and moved back home to Kerry. Within months, Frank, too, retired and they sold the house in Whitehall and the move became permanent. Still reeling from the loss of Patrick, she&#39;d leased out the farm to a neighbor and tried to restore the routine Denis had always known. She knew the shape of his days, his preference for plain food, his need for solitude, and these she could provide. But she could not replace Patrick, and though Denis never mentioned him, Frances was certain that he was pining for his twin brother&#39;s presence in the house. Frank drove Denis to the library in town every fortnight and did his best to help. Frances never asked what, if anything, they talked about on these journeys.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;They were on the motorway through Kildare, then Laois. Farmhouses appeared on hills, sheds and outbuildings nestled in behind them, the fields bare of livestock now in the dead of winter. Denis was behind her in the coffin, his head inches from hers. She suspected that this was a workhorse coffin used only for transport purposes. Denis might be in a body bag, dressed in his stained pajamas, zipped up by a stranger from his bony white feet to the top of his head. The odors of a decomposing body would still leak out, leaving a scent in the coffin for the next incumbent. She remembered reading that dogs often go crazy when they&#39;re muzzled at the vet&#39;s surgery—the scents of other dogs thrust on their faces is overwhelming, sending them into a frenzy of fear and panic.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Mr. O&#39;Shea&#39;s mobile phone, propped on the dashboard, vibrated, startling her. He tapped it quickly. “Sorry about that,” he said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;A few moments later, it vibrated again, and again he apologized. “That&#39;s my daughter. Young people . 。 。 it&#39;s always urgent with them, isn&#39;t it?” He switched the phone off.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“How old is your daughter?” Frances asked.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;“Sally. She&#39;s nineteen. She&#39;s actually on her way home now for the weekend. She&#39;s in college in Dublin.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;It struck her that Mr. O&#39;Shea might have planned to take his daughter home in the hearse, that it might be a regular arrangement whenever he was tasked with bringing the dead of Castleisland home from Dublin. With a contingency in place: If you can&#39;t reach me, it means I have a family member with me, so take the train.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Mr. O&#39;Shea adjusted the rearview mirror, then checked his wing mirror. “I think we&#39;ve lost Frank,” he said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Not far out of the city, before hitting the motorway, Frank would have pulled over at a service station, filled up with fuel, bought a newspaper, tea, a breakfast roll, and a bar of chocolate. On a day like this, he couldn&#39;t very well linger on the forecourt. Service stations—along with shopping centers and suburban housing estates—were, Frances used to imagine, one of his pickup spots for women. She&#39;d pictured him parking off to the side, near the service area, with his tea and breakfast roll, the racing page open on the steering wheel, keeping an eye out for a lone woman emerging from the shop, then tracking her, until she—game, like him, for a motorway fling—met his eye. There might be nothing said, just a look. The woman would pull over to check her tires, and Frank would, naturally, offer his help. Or he might simply tail the woman out of the service station, drive steadily in the lane alongside her until she turned her head and a look was exchanged. They were all the same, these women, it didn&#39;t matter where he found them; they were all like Frank.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Frank had started out as her lodger more than thirty years ago. Soon after she bought the house off Collins Avenue, she&#39;d advertised the two spare bedrooms to rent, to help with the mortgage. When he walked through the door—tall, broad, handsome, with dark curly hair—and she heard his country accent and saw his shy, polite manner, her heart flipped. And then there was the coincidence of his name. He worked with the gas board installing, servicing, and repairing gas boilers. A young teacher from Clare took the other room. Frances split the bills three ways, set the house rules, and stuck a cleaning rota on the fridge. Frank had a light footprint. He parked his van out on the road, and was gone every morning before eight. He was clean and tidy and quiet; he hoovered his room every Saturday, was discreet with his laundry, paid his rent on time, and was never drunk. He avoided conversation and eye contact, and in those rare times when he did speak Frances detected an endearing uncertainty in him. After a year, the young teacher moved out and Frank and Frances fell to cooking together in the evenings. She began to look forward to their meals, and their time alone. She told him about Kerry, her twin brothers, her widowed mother. For months Frank offered nothing, but, little by little, over the winter evenings, she learned the outline of his life. He had been placed in an orphanage very early on and, at the age of six, was fostered out to a farmer and his wife in County Kilkenny. At fifteen he started an apprenticeship with a local plumber, and he came to Dublin at seventeen. He knew nothing about his birth mother, other than the name on his birth certificate, and when Frances gently inquired if he was not curious about her or his father he shook his head. She had the impression of a man who did not want to delve into the past, a man who easily forgave and forgot the failings of others. He voiced no strong opinions, held no political allegiance, and was visibly uncomfortable with gossip. One Saturday evening after they had washed up the dishes, he folded the tea towel and stood behind a chair and asked her if she&#39;d like to go down to the Viscount for a drink.&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot;

a man without any obvious origins, as if he had simply materialized on the earth when he crossed her threshold. She used to imagine scenes from his childhood, scenes she had watched in films: eager, obedient children in orphanages lined up for visitors; watching as the pretty ones were chosen and driven away to new lives with the childless. Whenever Frances tried to nudge Frank into investigating his origins, he shook his head. He said that, as a young man going to dances, whenever he&#39;d told a girl about his background the girl had wanted nothing more to do with him. There were times when this absence of a past had bothered Frances, but then she would remember the little boy he once was, and she would be ambushed by a wave of love that flowed from her spine down into her arms and her hands, weakening her.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;She was thirty-four and Frank thirty-two when they married. She knew she was no beauty—tall, thin, and angular, with little in the way of hips or bosom, but neither this nor the plainness of her dress (she favored dark trousers, cream or white blouses, navy or wine cardigans) had seemed to matter to Frank. She was convinced that Frank&#39;s lineage must be notable; how else but genetics to explain his good looks, his manners, his work ethic—and had he not made something of himself despite his beginnings? And even when she was troubled by little doubts or signs of his deprivation she would remember an incident from their honeymoon. They were on a street in Edinburgh when Frank went to buy a lottery ticket. “Get me a Bounty bar, if they have them,” she said. When he came out of the shop and handed her the Bounty bar he said, “I don&#39;t know how you eat those things. I &lt;em>;hate&lt;/em>; coconut.” Such a strong word for Frank to use. They sat in a park and he told her that Kelly, the farmer who had fostered him as a boy, had always had sweets, which he never shared with Frank. One day Frank saw a sweet—an Emerald—on the floor of the tractor. He crept out that night and retrieved the sweet and hid behind the cowshed and sucked it very slowly, to make it last.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;That first year was the heyday of their marriage. She added his name to the deeds of the house. Together they painted the house, built raised beds in the back garden. That September they took a holiday in Greece, because Frances had always wanted to visit the oracle at Delphi. Frank rarely expressed needs or wants or wishes of his own, a trait, Frances assumed, that had developed early in his life. They bought a car and went regularly to Kerry. Her mother liked Frank and jokingly conspired against Frances, complaining about her dress sense or her regimental life style. “Why are you covering yourself up?” her mother would ask. “And you so slim you can wear anything!” Then she&#39;d turn to Frank: “I have only the one daughter, Frank, and she dresses like a nun. Maybe you can get her to change.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Frances expected they would have children quickly and easily. After two years, tests revealed blocked Fallopian tubes, and though she couldn&#39;t remember having had symptoms, the condition was attributed to suspected peritonitis as a result of an appendix operation when she was twenty-one. She underwent surgery to unblock the tubes and a year later suffered an ectopic pregnancy, followed in subsequent years by two miscarriages, the latter of which occurred in the sixth month. That was many years ago now, and though Frank had shown little emotion at the time, she&#39;d believed then that his outer display of stoicism was his way of supporting her, and that, inside, he was as bereft as she was.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Now she is no longer sure that Frank experiences grief—or any emotion, for that matter—in the manner that she and, she assumes, others experience it. Still, even now and after everything that has happened, she has to admit that, with the exception of Denis, she has never known anyone as peaceable as Frank. In all their years together, he had never raised his voice or spoken harshly to her or displayed the least flicker of irritation. She had always considered herself a kind person, if a little sharp at times, but there were moments when Frank&#39;s passivity tested the limits of her patience. He avoided looking at her during an argument and said almost nothing. She&#39;d goad him, accuse him of stubbornness, of stonewalling her, until he&#39;d shake his head and put a hand out to her and plead with her not to be cross. “This isn&#39;t normal,” she&#39;d cry. “Why don&#39;t you ever get angry? Where do you put your anger?” One evening, three or four years into the marriage, Frank told her of an incident at work where his boss had been rude, and dismissive of him.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;“Why didn&#39;t you stand up for yourself?” she demanded. “Why do you always let people walk all over you? Don&#39;t just sit there like some . 。 。 dumb animal.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;He was sitting at the kitchen table. “I&#39;m sorry if I&#39;m not the man you want me to be,” he said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;He had never spoken like this. She waited, her heart pounding with fear.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“I saw what anger did in the Kellys&#39; house. Tom Kelly was a brute. And worse when he got into a rage.” He shook his head. “There&#39;s nothing to be gained from anger, Frances.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“What happened? Was he a brute to you?”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“He was a brute to everyone and everything. The wife, the dog, me. I slept and ate in the back kitchen—I had a little bed that I folded away every morning. I got the leftover scraps—myself and the dog got the same food. She&#39;d give me nice things when he was gone to the mart or somewhere. Homemade bread and jam, a bit of meat. He wouldn&#39;t allow the dog inside, but I used to sneak him into the back kitchen at night and he&#39;d lie beside me. Captain. The loveliest dog you ever saw. And the brute shot him.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Jesus, Frank . 。 。为什么？ Why did he shoot him?”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Because Captain knocked over a bucket of milk, that&#39;s why. That&#39;s what anger does.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Mr. O&#39;Shea cleared his throat. His pale hands were resting on the steering wheel. Why had it surprised her that he was married, and had children? She doubted whether he had a strong libido. She can tell men like that now; they give off the whiff. She loathes people with big appetites—overeaters and drinkers, loud, gluttonous, noisy people with no self-control and no desire to refine themselves. Bodies swollen, pulsating with lust. Rutting like animals. That is the kind of husband she has. “Base” was the word that occurred to her years ago when his carry on first came to light. Base appetites and instincts. He had kept that side of himself hidden from her, but that is who he is. God knows who he has slept with, whose genitals he has slithered out of.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“I don&#39;t think I ever met Denis,” Mr. O&#39;Shea said. “Was he long sick?”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;“No, just a few months. He didn&#39;t go out much. He was always very delicate. The cancer was well advanced when they found it.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“He went fast, Lord have mercy on him.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;She liked that he had used Denis&#39;s name.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Very sad, and he a young man,” he continued.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“He was seventy-six.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Mr. O&#39;Shea shot her a look. “Seventy-six?”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;She nodded. “Seventy-seven next month. He was Patrick&#39;s twin.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Teaching had not suited Denis. Frances was ten when he came back from Dublin for good. He spent his days in his bedroom after that, resting and reading, her mother bringing his meals and his tablets, his laundered clothes, a tonic to build him up. When Frances helped her mother change the bed linen, she read the titles on his bookshelves. “The Complete Works of Shakespeare,” “Paradise Lost,” “The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire,” “The Collected Poems of John Donne.” Whenever she met Denis on the landing, he smiled and touched her head lightly, as a priest might do. No demands were made of him—it was Patrick who worked the farm with their father. Once a fortnight Patrick drove Denis to the library in Castleisland, where he spent an hour or more selecting books from the shelves.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In Frances&#39;s teen-age years, Denis began to leave novels at her bedroom door—“Moby-Dick,” “Pride and Prejudice,” “Silas Marner.” She was an adult before she understood that he&#39;d had some kind of breakdown. She wondered if a girl had broken his heart. Once, about ten years ago, she came upon him sitting on a tree stump looking out over the fields with his back to her. He was very still. A wood pigeon landed on the stone wall to his left, and he turned his head slightly to watch it, and in those moments, in the neutral way he observed the pigeon, she had a sudden realization of his nature: his absolute surrender and acceptance of things as they were. It was the way he observed everything—devoid of need or memory or rapture.&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;a data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a27362&amp;quot;}&quot;

In recent years she had considered various possibilities: that he might have been gay, or that something terrible had been visited upon him, or even, on days when all kinds of fears populated her mind, that &lt;em>;he&lt;/em>; had visited something terrible on someone else—a child, for instance.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;It is Denis she credits with giving her a love of books and a glimpse of the life of the mind. In her first posting, Frances had been taken under the wing of the senior librarian and, in less than two years, learned how to read with an open mind, how to discern good writing from bad and trust her own artistic sensibility. The senior librarian delivered to Frances a literary education that rivalled those offered by most universities, so that by the time she left that post Frances could make a good fist of describing what symbolist poetry was or explaining why James Joyce or Virginia Woolf or William Faulkner mattered.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;She read the biographies, too, and would come upon little tidbits that delighted her, like the fact that Joyce had kept two parakeets in his Paris flat, or that Robert Musil had once been a librarian. Over the decades, she continued to watch and learn and discern from the book lovers and aesthetes who frequented her libraries—middle-aged, bluestocking ladies, rakish young men, and intense young women—and took note of the books they read and the journals they requested. One winter, a Dutch student began to appear in her library on Friday evenings and Saturday mornings. He was thin and pale, with fair to reddish hair and high cheekbones. He often requested books that she had to call in from other libraries—titles by Robert Walser or Joseph Roth. She saw him, one evening, hunched against the wind, on the street in Phibsborough. When he returned the books, she took them home, one by one, and read them. Of all these books, Robert Musil&#39;s stories made the greatest impression on her, tales of young urban men—students and engineers and geologists—heading out of the city on work assignments into bleak valleys where they seduced peasant girls. The stories were pervaded with sickness and death and what the young men thought was love. They weighed on Frances and threw a pall over her, but, perhaps because she had been a country girl herself, she kept being drawn back to them. The Dutch student had disappeared by spring, but she associated these stories with him. In her mind, now, she somehow associates them with Frank, with the grim, miserable landscape of his childhood. And the sex: there was always sex in Musil&#39;s stories; the sexual act had an almost religious fervor, and the men experienced something like a mystical union with the girls, but had little regard or pity for the girls&#39; feelings or their futures. The poor girls, Frances thought, believing they were truly favored by the men, hoping for love.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;They were coming off the motorway. She looked at Mr. O&#39;Shea.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“We&#39;ll have to stop,” he said, a little agitated. “I&#39;m afraid I might have collected the wrong remains at the morgue. I don&#39;t know for certain . 。 。 But when you said your brother was seventy-six I was taken aback. It&#39;s a younger man I collected, I&#39;m sure of that. I&#39;m very sorry about this, but I&#39;ll have to open the coffin and check. Do you want to call Frank and he can link up with us, and he can check with me?”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;She shook her head as the words began to register. “No, it&#39;s all right. I can do it.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“This is Roscrea we&#39;re coming into,” he said. “I know the church here. It&#39;s surrounded by trees, so it&#39;ll be more private.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The church tower came into view and Mr. O&#39;Shea turned in to a churchyard bordered by cypress and yew trees. He came to a halt at the back of the stone church.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“If you can give me ten—or maybe fifteen—minutes.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;She put on a woollen hat and scarf and walked along the street and into a square with a stone fountain. She sat on a bench. They might have ferried a stranger&#39;s corpse all this way, she thought. A young woman in a puffer coat came and sat on a nearby bench, then lit a cigarette and became engrossed in her phone. The smell of the cigarette gave Frances a sudden longing. She had smoked in her youth—never more than ten a day—and quit when she turned thirty. She started smoking the odd cigarette again after the discovery about Frank, and then quit again four years ago after moving to Kerry. She had hoped that the move would herald a new start for them, that it would remove Frank from temptation. But after six months Frank was back on the road again, working part time with the local heating contractor.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;It was on the 16A bus one summer evening as it crawled through Drumcondra that she discovered Frank&#39;s betrayal. A Thursday evening, just before the June bank-holiday weekend. From her seat, she looked across the road at Thunders Bakery, remembering that she had ordered a cake for collection the following afternoon to take to Kerry. As she shifted her gaze, her eyes registered a Bord Gáis van a little ahead in the lane alongside the bus. It was the yellow sticker on the back door—a smiley character giving the thumbs-up sign—that caught her attention. That&#39;s Frank, she thought, happily, and leaned forward, ready to wave when the bus drew level. And in the space of about five seconds and in a distance of about five yards her whole self began to slide sideways. A bare forearm rested on the passenger window. In the passenger seat sat a woman, her profile and short dark hair visible to Frances from her higher perch. The woman was talking, then laughing. She raised a choc ice to her mouth and licked it. Then she stretched out her arm and Frank&#39;s face came into view, and then Frank&#39;s tongue, licking the woman&#39;s choc ice.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Later, when he came in, she never pretended a thing. He went upstairs and showered as usual and at the dinner she asked, as she often did, “Where are ye working these days?”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;He chewed and swallowed before answering. “We&#39;re out in Portmarnock since Monday, finishing up that housing estate.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Oh. I thought I saw your van in Dorset Street on my way home. That mustn&#39;t have been you, so,” she said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;He shook his head. “No, that wasn&#39;t me,” he said. “I dropped Tony over to Swords on the way home.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;So much of the past now made sense. It was not his first time. There had been patterns: callers who hung up when she answered, flurries of activity involving late-evening jobs, sudden changes to his scheduled hours, weekend jobs to which he went off bright-eyed and happy, followed by months when there was no evening work, no weekend jobs, just evenings in, early nights, and evasiveness. How blind she had been. She took a sip of water. &lt;em>;Liar&lt;/em>;, she thought, glaring at him and, for a second, there was panic in his eyes.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;When bedtime came, she said, “You can sleep in the front room from now on,” and there was no argument, no opposition, no discussion, ever.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;That summer, she would exchange looks with dark-haired women on the bus or walking slowly past her house or loitering near the library, any of whom might have been the choc-ice woman, coming to have a look at Frances. At lunchtime she sat under a tree in the little park behind the library, and felt the world shrink to nothing but the terrible quivering of the birch leaves above her. She wrote letters to Frank that she never gave him. She thought herself a fool, a mug, a female cuckold; she thought the words “unfaithful” and “infidelity”—men&#39;s words—too tame, too benign. Call it what it is: &lt;em>;fornication&lt;/em>;. She saw through walls into suburban houses, into the back of his van. She saw him arranging cushions and rugs, talking dirty, laughing, feasting on their bodies, cleaning up. The women would be coarse, sexually daring—devious, even—and Frank would let that side of himself out. He would show them photographs, and they would ridicule her. Yes, nunnish, they&#39;d agree, a dry old stick, a prude. His was a sexless marriage, he&#39;d tell them, and, to top it all, she was barren. The mortification almost annihilated her. In her worst hours, she feared &lt;em >;AIDS&lt;/em>;. Or a child. A child who would one day turn up on her doorstep to claim his inheritance. A child who would be legally entitled to part of her home. She lay awake at night. What if Frank fell in love with one of these women? What if he left her? What if &lt;em>;they&lt;/em>; fell in love? What if they wanted to be rid of her? There was a murder case in the news at the time—a doctor and his lover were on trial for killing the woman&#39;s husband. Every night when the item came on the nine-o&#39;clock news, Frances could hardly breathe.&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;a data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a28065&amp;quot;}&quot;

She sensed danger everywhere. She grew obsessive about hygiene, took copious showers and brutally scrubbed her body. She lost her appetite. Certain foods—their textures and odors—repelled her. She saw sexual similes and correlations everywhere—she shunned milk first, and then yogurt, because they reminded her of semen. She grew thin and anxious and watchful, afraid that somehow her shame might be discernible. Late one night, in the middle of a film, the lead actress turned to Frances and addressed her directly through the TV screen. You must wash your tongue every night, she said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The next day she would regain her equilibrium and tell herself that she had overreacted, that she had exaggerated what she saw from the bus that evening, that there must be other explanations for the choc-ice woman. Because surely, &lt;em>;surely&lt;/em>;, the housewives of Dublin were not so lustful that chance encounters with tradesmen led immediately to attacks of passion and fornication? And Frank was not a cruel or heartless man. He would never ridicule her, or harm her; he was incapable of doing evil. But in the evening, as the light faded, she&#39;d remember the choc-ice woman again, the short dark hair, the bare, tanned arm. She started checking the redial button on the phone late at night. One night she dialled, waited a few seconds after the woman answered. “Listen,” she said, her calm voice belying the terror she felt. “You&#39;re one of many. You&#39;re just one of his many whores.” She held her breath until the woman hung up. She did it again the following night. &lt;em>;Whore&lt;/em>;.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The coffin was at the mouth of the hearse, resting waist-high on a stand, the lid unscrewed and sitting on top.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Mr. O&#39;Shea slid the lid diagonally.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;She nodded and smiled. “That&#39;s him, that&#39;s definitely Denis.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Mr. O&#39;Shea lowered his head and heaved a sigh of relief. “Thank God.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;She touched Denis&#39;s face, the band around his head. There was nothing of him left, she thought, nothing she might call a soul still lingering. Just this fast-disintegrating ragtag of an old body, and her memory of it and him. She left her hand on his hair. Denis had been the lucky one. He had not had to navigate ordinary human relationships or contend with the intense emotions and pain they bring. Whatever he had suffered in his youth, he had survived through the shelter of home. He had withdrawn from the world and turned inward. Now she wondered if his youthful suffering had ever awoken in him an awareness of pain &lt;em>;outside&lt;/em>; of himself. &lt;em>;She&lt;/em>; has had intimations of pain outside of herself, moments when the whole suffering pantheon—the sick, the hungry, the tortured—from time immemorial hits her like a tsunami, so much so that whenever a documentary on orphanages or institutional child abuse comes on the TV she switches channels immediately or gets up and puts on a wash or cleans out a cupboard, something—anything—to turn her own soul toward distraction.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“He doesn&#39;t look anywhere near seventy-six,” Mr. O&#39;Shea said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“No, I suppose not. I forgot to say his hair was still dark,” she said. “He never went gray. It&#39;s no wonder you thought he was younger.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;When Mr. O&#39;Shea went to put the lid back on the coffin, she turned away. Suddenly she was alone in the world. Unbidden came the words of a prayer from childhood that she said in times of fear and danger. &lt;em>;Sacred Heart of Jesus&lt;/em>;, &lt;em>;I place all my trust in Thee&lt;/em>;.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;After that first summer, she thought the worst was over. Then one evening in late November she was removing the day&#39;s newspapers from their station in the library when she spotted a headline in the health pages of the &lt;em>;Irish Times&lt;/em>;. “&lt;em >;Chlamydia, the silent destroyer&lt;/em>;.” Her insides plummeted. She knew, before she read a word, what was in the article. She locked the library doors, switched off the main lights, and sat at a low table in the children&#39;s corner. The complications listed—infertility, blocked Fallopian tubes, ectopic pregnancy, miscarriage—had all been hers. She had always had an inkling, a vague sense of fear and foreboding around sex. She had put it down to the legacy of her upbringing, of being raised in an era when becoming pregnant outside marriage was the worst sentence a girl or a woman could face—worse, maybe, than death. And as if that weren&#39;t enough the &lt;em >;aids&lt;/em>; epidemic was at its height when Frances met Frank. It had not been easy at the start. Although Frank was gentle and kind, sex had been painful and messy and embarrassing. She had faulted herself, but she persevered, and on those occasions when sex was pleasurable she had felt womanly and worldly and sophisticated, like a character in a film. But the unease and the sense of foreboding were never far off. Now it was almost a relief to know that they had not come from nothing.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Back on the road, Mr. O&#39;Shea was in a grateful, almost buoyant mood.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“You know we always check that we&#39;re picking up the right sex—when we&#39;re collecting remains, I mean. But Lord God, no way does your brother look his age. He could easily pass for forty with that head of black hair.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;She never confronted Frank. Instead, on quiet mornings in the library she went online and read about the bacterium she had unwittingly hosted in her body for years. &lt;em>;Chlamydia trachomatis&lt;/em>;, derived from the Greek word for “cloak,” may have originated in amphibians, most likely frogs. She pored over the microscopic images on the screen, magnified into bulging, purple, misshapen globules, and thought of them invading and contaminating the pink flesh of her cervix and womb and tubes. She began to detest Frank&#39;s bodily presence, his smell, the sound of his chewing. In the evenings, they ate in silence. When Frank moved to clear the dishes—or do any task in the kitchen—she lifted her hand, “Leave that, I&#39;ll do it,” and meekly he acquiesced. He could have left. She could have asked him to leave, she could have screamed, &lt;em>;Go on&lt;/em>;, &lt;em>;get out!&lt;/em>; &lt;em>;Go to one of your fancy women&lt;/em>;. But she was not a screamer, any more than he was. Eventually, she summoned the courage to see an STI consultant in a private clinic and told the woman the whole story. The tests came back positive for chlamydia, negative for everything else. She had been a virgin, a novice on her wedding night. She had assumed that the pain and discomfort and discharge were associated with intercourse. Sitting there in the privacy of the doctor&#39;s office, Frances started to cry for the fool of a woman she had been. She went home, started a course of antibiotics, and went to bed for the weekend, full of hatred for Frank and for her own body, befouled with his filthy bacteria.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;There was a Robert Musil story that Frances came upon around that time. The protagonist, a student of chemistry and technology, became involved with Tonka, a humble, passive girl who had been hired to care for his grandmother. He believed he&#39;d once caught sight of her in the countryside, standing outside a cottage. His friend told him that hundreds of such girls labored in the fields when the beets were harvested, and that it was said they were as submissive as slaves to their supervisors. The young man saw something noble in this simple creature, in her innocence and helplessness. He thought, If it were not for him, who would understand her? When his grandmother died, he took Tonka with him to a big city. He did not love her, exactly, but he saw her as pure and natural and unspoiled. He believed she rinsed his soul clean. He loved all her little defects, even her deformed fingernail, the result of a work injury. After some years, Tonka became pregnant. The dates revealed that he had been away at the time of conception. But Tonka had no memory of anything having happened, and there was no man that he could suspect. He began to wonder if it could have been an immaculate conception. Then Tonka became ill with a horrible, “insidious” infection—syphilis. His doctors found no trace of the disease in him, and his mother hinted that Tonka was a prostitute. He grew suspicious and superstitious, but Tonka was steadfast in her denials. Send me away if you won&#39;t believe me, she said calmly. He sought several doctors&#39; opinions, hoping for a rational explanation that would prove her innocence. He wrestled with philosophical questions, like the idea that one must believe in a thing—a chair, a door—before the thing can exist in front of one&#39;s eyes. His private ordeal revolved around this question of belief—could he force himself to believe in Tonka&#39;s innocence? The disease progressed and Tonka grew sick and gaunt and ugly, but he continued to care for her, all the while wavering between hope and despair. He believed that Tonka was inwardly pure, despite her outward ugliness, and that her goodness was mysterious, like a dog&#39;s goodness. And then one day Tonka&#39;s old calendar lay open, and the young man saw, among other domestic entries, a little red exclamation mark recording the incident that Tonka denied. Frances remembers the young man&#39;s mental anguish, how demented he was with dreams and visions and feelings that were constantly oscillating. He did not believe Tonka, but he believed in Tonka.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;They were on the ring road around Limerick city. Mr. O&#39;Shea was tapping lightly on the steering wheel.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“We&#39;ll be home in good time, after all,” he said. “Frank won&#39;t have too long to wait.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;“No,” she said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;After a few moments, he gave her an inquisitive look. “Frank isn&#39;t a Kerry man, is he?”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“No. Kilkenny.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Over the years, much of the pain had abated. Little things had helped. The habit of passing the women&#39;s prison every morning and imagining the lives behind the walls—women who&#39;d been driven to kill their men after years of being kicked and beaten, of losing their minds and their pregnancies. There were worse fates than hers, she knew. Frank had not a violent bone in his body; as he aged, he had put on weight, and walked with a slow, lumbering gait. She would catch sight of him bending down to tie a shoelace or putting on his jacket in the hall, and something about the lonely slope of his shoulders would soften her and remind her of the boy he had been. Then she would catch herself: &lt;em>;Beware of pity&lt;/em>;, &lt;em>;Frances&lt;/em>;.&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;a data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a27918&amp;quot;}&quot;

By now, Frank would be parked outside the funeral home waiting for them, worried by their delay. She had lied to the STI doctor. When the doctor said that Frank would have to be told, and treated, Frances had nodded. But she had no intention of telling him. Let him go on infecting them, she thought. Let them rot.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;She turned to Mr. O&#39;Shea.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“My husband is a serial adulterer,” she announced. She had been rehearsing those words in her head for years.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Mr. O&#39;Shea looked at her in panic. Then he gave a little cough, and cleared his throat. “I&#39;m very sorry,” he said. “That&#39;s terrible. I don&#39;t know what to say.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;He looked at her softly, kindly, and for an instant she was afraid that he might put his hand on hers. She looked out her window. Maybe he&#39;s one, too, she thought. If I were a different woman, younger, more attractive—or maybe not even attractive, but capable of giving off a certain signal—would he be game, too? He might at any minute exit the motorway, drive along a country road and down a forest track, and there might be some talk or laughter and maybe even a little awkwardness as he unbuckled, and then he would do it and I would let him, with my dead brother lying there, inches from our heads.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Dusk was falling as they crossed the county boundary into Kerry. The last of the evening light appeared between the clouds, signalling, she thought, winter&#39;s end. She wondered what angle she would have on her life, her whole existence, when the end came. And what angle would Frank have on his life, if he ever pondered such things? It was difficult to know what, if anything, had meaning for Frank. If she had meaning for him. She knew precisely what meaning Frank had for her—he was a weight that would never leave her. They would be bound together for infinity, under one roof. She would be exiled with him within the walls of her childhood home, and this exile would start tomorrow or the next day. They would grow old and infirm together. She would tend to his body, or he to hers. In time, memory would fade or alter. The small boy creeping out at night to retrieve a sweet from the floor of a tractor would fade. Standing behind a cowshed then would be Frank as a grown man, sucking the sweet slowly and carefully until the chocolate was all gone and the desiccated coconut formed a hard, tight little ball in his mouth.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The street lights were on when they arrived in Castleisland. They turned off Main Street. Frank was parked across from the funeral home. In their life together, she had made all the decisions. She had brought them to Kerry without consideration for him. He had objected to nothing, and she had taken his silence as acquiescence. And what of his suffering? Where had he put the lost mother, the abandoned child, and all the sad days that followed? Had he reined it all in, sublimated everything? Everything except the sex.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Mr. O&#39;Shea drove around the back of his premises and parked the hearse and turned off the engine. For a moment, all was darkness. Then a light came on and a door opened. And from around the side of the building Frank&#39;s outline appeared. She squinted. Any moment now, she thought, I will be able to make out his face, his eyes. As she waited, a question rose: Who is the choc-ice woman? The choc-ice woman is nobody. Then Tonka came to mind. Tonka, gaunt and ugly on her deathbed, with her secret locked inside her. And the young man, who had loved her deformed fingernail, crying out her name and understanding, for an instant, all he had never understood, and feeling her, from the ground under his feet to the top of his head, feeling the whole of her life, in him. ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;em>;This is drawn from “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Barcelona-Mary-Costello-ebook/dp/B0CGF7Q6PL/&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Barcelona-Mary-Costello-ebook/dp/B0CGF7Q6PL/&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Barcelona-Mary-Costello-ebook/dp/B0CGF7Q6PL/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;Barcelona&lt;/a>;.”&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 09 Oct 2023 19:06:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Mary Costello on Betrayal and Forgiveness]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.newyorker.com/books/this-week-in-fiction/mary-costello-10-16-23]]><description>&lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-09T10:00:00.000Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/651da53e1eb6fd35358683a2/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/twif-mary%20costello.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;article >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attribute-verso-pattern=&quot;article-body&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;ArticlePageChunks&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;This week&#39;s story, “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/10/16/the-choc-ice-woman-fiction-mary-costello&quot;>;The Choc-Ice Woman&lt;/a>;,” opens as a hearse is pulling out into traffic in Dublin. It is carrying a woman in her sixties called Frances and the corpse of her older brother Denis. Did you have that scenario in mind when you started working on the story? How important is the idea of the journey?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I had Frances in my mind for a long time, but didn&#39;t have her full story. Then my mother-in-law mentioned that she&#39;d known a woman, years ago, who had accompanied an undertaker in the hearse taking the remains of her aunt from Dublin to her home place in the country. This is a common practice in Ireland—my brother sat in the hearse when my father&#39;s coffin was taken to the church and graveyard. That initial image of a woman and an undertaker in the hearse struck me; I could see them coming off the motorway, stopping for a smoke. As the story progressed, other possibilities presented themselves.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;As regards the journey, I wasn&#39;t consciously thinking of its metaphorical meaning. I like the intensity and the claustrophobic feeling of two people trapped together in the confined space of a car or, in this case, a hearse. Everything is concentrated. That space is as much a psychological space as a physical one. In that sense, it&#39;s very fertile ground for a writer.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;Frances is married to Frank, a shy, polite man who was fostered as a child. He&#39;s following the hearse on its journey to Kerry. As the journey—and the story—unfolds, we discover that Frances believes Frank is a compulsive philanderer. It&#39;s a passage that comes as a shock when a reader first encounters it. Was that your intention? How unsettled do you want the reader to feel?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Frances&#39;s life appears stable, ordered, without drama, but, beneath her calm, controlled exterior, there&#39;s a sense of fear and quiet trepidation, a low-level dread caused by Frank&#39;s adultery. Great shame, too. She manages to keep these threatening forces at bay, but only just. At any moment, the ground might give.&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;I like stories that have a neutral tone which belies what&#39;s really happening, where a character&#39;s psychic suffering is just intimated. Stories like Joyce&#39;s “A Painful Case” and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/alice-munro-our-chekhov&quot;>;Alice Munro&lt;/a>;&#39;s Juliet stories have that kind of effect—moments of quiet devastation where you can barely breathe out of fear for the characters.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;There was no intention to unsettle or shock. In the writing of a story, I&#39;m not thinking of the reader. My only concern is being faithful to the characters.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;Frances discovered Frank&#39;s infidelity when, from a bus, she caught sight of a stranger sitting next to him in his van, eating a choc ice. Will Frances ever be able to forget that moment? How did you come up with that particular image?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I don&#39;t remember when exactly that image came to me. I lived in Drumcondra during my college years, and I know that part of the city well; I travelled on the 16A bus a lot, so maybe it&#39;s some residual memory from way back then. At any rate, it&#39;s the little things that give us away, and, at a particular moment, the most ordinary scene can floor us. After that sighting from her perch on the bus, Frances&#39;s whole life tilted sideways, and can never be righted. Her best—and perhaps only—option is to try to understand Frank and live with this painful memory.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;In the early years of her career, Frances worked for a senior librarian who took her under her wing, giving Frances a literary education that rivalled one offered by any university. One of the writers she later reads is the Austrian modernist Robert Musil. Did you know from the outset that Musil&#39;s work would play a role in this story?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;This was originally Frank&#39;s story, the title of which was “Ballad of the Gas Fitter,” after a strange and intriguing poem by Gerrit Achterberg. But then Frances emerged as the central figure. And, as she was a librarian, her reading material wound its way in, too. I&#39;m not sure when, exactly, Musil&#39;s story appeared.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I came to Robert Musil&#39;s work years ago, by way of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/10/02/the-pole-jm-coetzee-book-review&quot;>;JM Coetzee&lt;/a>;. According to Coetzee, fiction is, for Musil, a “laboratory for the refinement of the soul.” (The same might be said of Coetzee.)&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I spend a lot of time reading and thinking about novels and stories and poems and essays—and their authors, so I suppose it is inevitable that the writers who matter to me and who&#39;ve had the greatest impact seep into my characters. The main character of my last novel, “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/River-Capture-Mary-Costello/dp/1782116435&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/River-Capture-Mary-Costello/dp/1782116435&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/River-Capture-Mary-Costello/dp/1782116435&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;The River Capture&lt;/a>;,” is obsessed with Joyce. And Kafka and Coetzee are present in the lives of a couple of characters in my next collection, “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.co.uk/Barcelona-Mary-Costello/dp/1805301837/&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.co.uk/Barcelona-Mary-Costello/dp/1805301837/&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.co.uk/Barcelona-Mary-Costello/dp/1805301837/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;Barcelona&lt;/a>;,” in much the same way as Musil is in Frances&#39;s.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;Frank&#39;s childhood was much harsher than Frances&#39;s, although he rarely reveals these details. She has long had empathy for him, but she&#39;s filled with anger now, too, when she thinks about what she&#39;s lost as a result of his behavior. Will she always feel a sense of pain when she thinks about her marriage? Or will it be negated in any way by her attempt to understand him and the world that made him?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Frances&#39;s dilemma is how to reconcile her compassion for Frank with the suffering that his betrayal has caused her. How to mediate those opposites. How, and why, do we continue to tolerate—and even love—those who harm us? Can we forgive those who wrong us, and should we even try? In an earlier draft, Frances was reading Camus—another womanizer who was nonetheless a good man—and finding a kinship with him, with his profound compassion for humanity and his reluctance to condemn human frailty.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Frank&#39;s childhood certainly offers Frances mitigating circumstances for his behavior, but when these threaten to tip the scales she cautions herself, echoing Stefan Zweig&#39;s warning to beware of pity.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;Her brother Denis had some kind of breakdown when he was a young man and retreated to the family farm. Frances has been left to wonder what happened. Was he hurt by someone, or, worse, did he inflict hurt on another person? She&#39;ll never know the answer. Do you know it as the writer?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;No, I don&#39;t know what happened to Denis in his youth. He has always been a sensitive, delicate man, a figure of goodness—almost saintliness—for Frances. But she&#39;s questioning the old certainties, aware that reality is altogether more slippery than she once thought. And she realizes that, for decades, Denis enjoyed the luxury of being sheltered, of never having to engage with the world or other people. It&#39;s easy to be a saint if you live like a hermit.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;gwddec&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;bx9t4k&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;Frances thinks about a story by Musil called “Tonka,” about a young man who falls in love with a peasant girl. Do you think she sees Frank as the young man—or as the girl, Tonka?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I think she sees Frank as being closer to Tonka. She herself has more of an affinity with the young man—they&#39;re both conflicted, both wrestling with the same ambiguities, both trying to accommodate compassion and pain. It&#39;s irrational and illogical for this young man to believe in Tonka&#39;s innocence; he seems almost willfully blind at times. But, like Frances, he&#39;s striving to go beyond the facts, beyond his experience of deception and human weakness toward a deeper understanding of humanity, an understanding that&#39;s perhaps metaphysical in nature. It is not simply a question of forgiveness or forbearance, but something more. And both Frances and the young man do come close to some kind of breakthrough, some revelation. After Tonka&#39;s death, the young man experiences a brief, numinous moment of insight; it is fleeting, gone in an instant. But it is, nevertheless, something.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Musil&#39;s story, which has leaked into her life, offers Frances that brief glimpse of clarity, too, that moment of consciousness. It&#39;s what literature can do. Afterward, of course, the veil falls back down again, and ordinary life resumes. ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;lt5vke&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 09 Oct 2023 19:06:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[The Melting Pot of “Jaja’s African Hair Braiding”]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/10/16/the-melting-pot-of-jajas-african-hair-braiding]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-09T10:00:00.000Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/652035c45d6ca64907fbae0c/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/231016_r43175.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;article >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attribute-verso-pattern=&quot;article-body&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;ArticlePageChunks&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Jaja (Somi Kakoma), the title character of Jocelyn Bioh&#39;s new play, “Jaja&#39;s African Hair Braiding,” doesn&#39;t show up onstage until the show&#39;s nearly over. But, before we ever see her, a portrait emerges. She&#39;s described by her employees in the course of a long day in 2019 at the Harlem shop over which she lovingly lords. To Bea (Zenzi Williams) and Aminata (Nana Mensah), she&#39;s a demanding boss with a proud streak. They take turns affectionately mocking how she says her fiancé Steven&#39;s name—a bit froggy in the throat, the “v” tending toward an “f,” both vowel sounds braggadociously distended. Jaja and Steven are getting married on this day; he&#39;s a well-off-sounding white man, and she&#39;s an undocumented immigrant from Senegal.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;To Jaja&#39;s daughter, Marie (Dominique Thorn), who minds the shop and tends to its administrative business, Jaja is a mother with high standards. Marie went to a private school, where she got great grades and ran circles around her more stably situated peers. She was the valedictorian of her class, but now that she&#39;s graduated she might not be able to go to college—she uses the name and the ID of a cousin she&#39;s never met. Born in Senegal but an American in every way except in the eyes of the law since she was four years old, Marie is walking a tightrope that&#39;s been thrown across the Atlantic and feeling the sharp winds to either side. Her future—at least as far as she can perceive it—depends on the marriage between her mother and Steven, but some small, nagging thought tells her she can&#39;t trust that it&#39;s all going to work out. Jaja wants Marie to be a doctor, or, as a backup, an engineer. But—like so many young people in so many plays—Marie wants to be a writer. She writes short stories in notebooks, and shares them with Miriam (Brittany Adebumola), a braider from Sierra Leone.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Jaja&#39;s African Hair Braiding”—on Broadway at the Samuel J. Friedman, produced by Manhattan Theatre Club, and directed with velocity and ease by the very talented Whitney White—skips through the hours at Jaja&#39;s salon. At one point, Bea—the shop&#39;s most insistent gossip, with the most unpredictable attitude—is venting her anger at a younger braider, Ndidi (Maechi Aharanwa), who she suspects is intentionally stealing her customers:&lt;/p>;&lt;blockquote >;&lt;div >;&lt;p>;B&lt;em >;EA&lt;/em>;: You must really have a death wish, eh? How many of my customers are you going to steal?!&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;N&lt;em >;DIDI&lt;/em>;: What are you talking about?&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;B&lt;em >;EA&lt;/em>;: Everyone in here knows that Michelle has been coming to me for YEARS!&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;N&lt;em >;DIDI&lt;/em>;: And I&#39;m supposed to know that how?&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/blockquote>;&lt;p >;Later, Miriam—outwardly shy but inwardly determined—tells her customer Jennifer (Rachel Christopher) all about her florid dramas back home:&lt;/p>;&lt;blockquote >;&lt;div >;&lt;p>;And you know, my husband—he&#39;s not a good husband. He didn&#39;t do anything. No job. He&#39;s lazy. I have to do everything in the house. So I was not happy, you know? And then one day, I was at the market and I run into my friends from secondary school. And we are talking and laughing and I&#39;m having a good time and they say “Miriam! You need to come with us tonight. This new singer is having a show on the beach. You have to come!” And I know my husband no want to go because he don&#39;t like anything fun. So I lie to him and tell him I&#39;m going to my sister&#39;s house and I go to the show.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/blockquote>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;The story turns into one of those fascinating narratives—quick love, poignant loss, uncertain paternity, distant voyages—which only someone like Miriam, with a big, if unheralded, life, lived across continents, can tell. Jennifer, a budding journalist who&#39;s in the shop to get microbraids—a day-spanning, finger-busting experience—is a happily captive audience for Miriam&#39;s one-woman show.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Kalyne Coleman and Lakisha May zoom in and out of the shop, playing several clients. One&#39;s incredibly rude; one&#39;s a school friend of Marie&#39;s; one&#39;s the aforementioned Michelle, who ignites the fire of battle between Bea and Ndidi. Both performers are versatile and funny, but, even more important for Bioh&#39;s project, they&#39;re also sociologically knowledgeable—you can&#39;t play (or, for that matter, write) all of these types unless you&#39;ve spent time in real neighborhoods, walking around with your antennae up, soaking up faces and gestures and sensibilities as they promenade past.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;With each role, Bioh&#39;s gifts are on display. She can make a real character appear—the kind that rests on archetype but always achieves the spark of individuality—in just a few seconds of talk or motion. She brings people into contact precisely at the places where they&#39;re most vulnerable, or wounded, or willing to crack just the right joke to reveal an uncomfortable truth. Sometimes she clears out space and simply lets her people dance, or gawk at the television. She allows life to happen onstage.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Bioh does this all so smoothly and expertly that her dialogue seems televisual—there are several moments in “Jaja&#39;s” that made me wonder if it would work as a streaming binge instead of a fleet ninety-minute play. But her emphasis on bodies and music and sound and sight gags keeps her work stubbornly theatrical. And, paradoxically, her interest in screen-based media and its effects on the heart is probably best explored in a live medium.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Bioh&#39;s previous play, “Nollywood Dreams,” was about the movie industry in Nigeria—and, in a hilarious side plot, how it&#39;s digested on daytime TV. Here, in Jaja&#39;s shop, we see how the cultural products forged so harrowingly in “Nollywood” are transmitted across oceans and throughout diasporas, salving homesickness as they go. At one point, Ndidi acts out a long passage of dialogue from a show that&#39;s playing on the shop&#39;s small TV, a glowing locus of constant attention. It&#39;s a funny moment, perfect as a showcase for Aharanwa&#39;s charismatic, joyful energy—but it also demonstrates, in a way that TV would be hard pressed to do on its own, how the mimetic impulse that soaps and other shows encourage in their viewers is a way of retreating into the self and wishing one&#39;s way back home.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Still, you can easily imagine what “Jaja&#39;s African Hair Braiding: The Miniseries” would be like. One thing it might address is only hinted at, really in a single line, in Bioh&#39;s play: the subtle strains, invisible to outsiders, that often wring the relationships between West African immigrants and Black Americans. After one particularly tough customer&#39;s tirades, Bea says simply, in a mode of lament, “These people.” These people, &lt;em>;who&lt;/em>;? A whole world, fraught with cultural dissonance and regrettable zero-sum economic competition, might spring from that tossed-off phrase. Knowing Bioh, she&#39;ll get there soon.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The run of this play is well timed in New York, where our local politics have suddenly become consumed with the question of whether or not it&#39;s right to welcome migrants when—for whatever reason, by whichever means—they show up in the city. Mayor Eric Adams, who&#39;s still fixated on fun but increasingly pestered by the annoyances of his actually quite important job, keeps saying that the current waves of asylum seekers, largely from Latin America, arriving on buses from red states along our country&#39;s southern border, will “destroy” New York.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;When Jaja finally arrives, sparkling in white, ready to storm City Hall and party down, she delivers a speech that refutes the paranoia of nativists like Adams:&lt;/p>;&lt;blockquote >;&lt;div >;&lt;p>;What kind of perfect immigrant are they looking for, eh? When it comes to us, the rules are alllllways changing! 。 。 。 This country is fine with TAKING. They are even fine with us GIVING, but the moment we ASK for something?嘿！就是这样。 Who are you? Dirty Africans! Get out of our country! Go back to your . 。 。 “shat-holes.” 。 。 。 Okay, so you want me to go? Fine, I will go. But when do you want me to leave? Before or after I raise your children? Or clean your house? Or cook your food? Or braid your hair so you look nice-nice before you go on your beach vacation?! 。 。 。 So now that&#39;s it. Today, I will be on THEIR level.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/blockquote>;&lt;p >;The ending of Bioh&#39;s play is a bit hastily resolved, which is especially jarring after the loose, languid, refreshingly episodic rhythm of the rest of the show. But it does reveal, like so much else here, a defiant spirit, a bit of flair amid disaster. ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;c8qd2q&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;oe79s8&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 09 Oct 2023 19:06:01 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
