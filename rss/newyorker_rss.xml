Engoron)“精神错乱”，并指责提起此案的纽约总检察长利蒂西亚·詹姆斯(Letitia James)是种族主义者。&lt;/p>;&lt;鉴于这一判决可能会禁止特朗普在纽约做生意，并迫使他放弃对该州一些珍贵商业资产的控制权——包括特朗普大厦和华尔街 40 号——他的愤怒也就不足为奇了。但至少他的部分愤怒应该针对一位已去世 35 年多的共和党同胞：雅各布·贾维茨 (Jacob Javits)，他现在因以他的名字命名的会议中心而闻名。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;从 1957 年到1971年，贾维茨担任纽约州参议员，但在此之前他担任的职位目前由詹姆斯担任。作为纽约总检察长，他赢得了愿意与强大利益集团较量的自由派检察官的声誉。 1956 年，即他任职的最后一年，他敦促州立法机构通过一项新法律，赋予他的办公室权力，对那些“屡次从事欺诈或非法行为或以其他方式表现出持续欺诈或非法行为的企业”进行调查并采取行动。业务的进行、进行或交易。”总检察长办公室援引纽约行政法第 63(12) 条这一广泛法规，提起了多项诉讼，从指控三家公交公司违反纽约市关于怠速的规定，到指控埃克森美孚在气候带来的商业风险方面误导投资者。改变。 “该法规赋予总检察长追究她或他认为具有欺诈性的任何行为的权力，”Stroock &amp; Co. 律师杰里·H·戈德费德 (Jerry H. Goldfeder) 说。斯特洛克安德鲁·科莫担任纽约总检察长时担任公共诚信特别顾问的拉万律师事务所 (Lavan LLP) 告诉我。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;在 2018 年当选之前，詹姆斯称特朗普为“骗子”，并承诺“将一盏明灯照进他房地产交易的每一个黑暗角落”。上任后，她对特朗普的业务展开了调查，去年9月针对唐纳德·特朗普的诉讼&quot;>;她根据《行政法》第 63(12) 条对特朗普、他的三个最大的孩子、他的两名雇员以及他的一些公司提起民事诉讼，其中她声称特朗普在向银行和保险公司等交易对手提交的财务报表中虚报了他的许多资产（包括他的建筑物、高尔夫球场和特朗普大厦顶层公寓）的价值数十亿美元。&lt;/p >;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;特朗普的律师试图让案件被驳回，理由是诉讼时效已过，詹姆斯没有资格提起诉讼，因为特朗普向其发送估值报表的金融机构从未提出投诉或遭受任何损失。特朗普在证词中声称，这些估值声明“一文不值”，而且每个人都知道这一点，因为它们附有一份限定声明，该声明称，如果将其资产投放市场，他的资产不一定能达到列出的估值。 p>;&lt;p>;恩戈隆在周二公布的长达三十五页的判决书中驳斥了这些论点。他指出，第63（12）条并没有要求政府证明造成经济损失或被告的行为意图欺诈。持续提交夸大的财务报表本身就满足了该法对欺诈的定义，并且包含模糊的、不可执行的免责声明“不能用于隔离被告所了解的特定事实的欺诈行为，即使是针对经验丰富的接收者，”恩戈龙&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;在此基础上，恩戈隆拒绝了特朗普团队驳回此案的请求，并批准了司法部长关于部分简易判决的动议——一项未经全面审判而做出的决定——根据第 63(12) 条，特朗普和其他被告应对欺诈行为负责。恩戈隆写道，特朗普的文件“明显包含被告在商业中使用的欺诈性估值，满足了 OAG 确定被告承担法律责任的责任”。 “被告回应称：文件并没有说明他们所说的内容；不存在“客观”价值这样的东西；从本质上讲，法院不应该相信自己的眼睛。”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Engoron 继续指出，即使尽管他去年任命了一名独立监察员来监督特朗普的业务，但“被告在开展业务时继续传播虚假和误导性信息。”他批准了詹姆斯取消特朗普在纽约的部分营业执照的请求，并表示他将任命另一名独立监察员来监督特朗普的业务，并可能监督这些业务的出售或解散。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;这样看来，特朗普长期以来因其可疑商业交易而逃避法律责任的能力已经结束，他在纽约的公司业务也可能因此结束。 （在周三的进一步听证会上，恩戈隆告诉特朗普的律师，他还没有准备好就特朗普企业到底会发生什么做出裁决。）特朗普的律师表示，他们将对裁决提出上诉，但目前这位前总统已被打上了烙印。一个不适合在他长大和生活了七十多年的州做生意的诈骗犯。 （他现在是佛罗里达州居民。）&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;恩戈隆的裁决决定了本案的核心问题：特朗普及其公司是否存在欺诈行为。詹姆斯的其余行为将于周一开始审判，其中包括保险欺诈指控，并可能导致经济处罚。 （周四，上诉法院驳回了特朗普律师推迟审判的努力。）&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;最引人注目的部分，也是这一切的真正丑闻，是数十年来它在商界广为人知。和新闻界认为特朗普经常夸大其资产的价值。当商业记者 Timothy L. O&#39;Brien 在 &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/TrumpNation-Donald-Timothy-L-OBrien/dp/044669617X&quot; data-event 中写下此内容时-click=&quot;{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.amazon.com/TrumpNation-Donald-Timothy-L-OBrien/dp/044669617X&quot;}&quot;

在国会提出了同样的主张证词表明检察官对此感兴趣。前曼哈顿地区检察官小赛勒斯·万斯 (Cyrus Vance, Jr.) 的调查人员基于詹姆斯在提起民事案件时使用的大部分相同证据，相信他们已经针对特朗普立案了一个可以获胜的刑事案件。但万斯的继任者阿尔文·布拉格决定停止调查。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;当然，今天特朗普在四个不同的法院面临着无数的刑事指控——总共九十一个，其中包括&lt;a href=&quot; https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/alvin-bragg-donald-trump-and-the-pursuit-of-low-level-crimes&quot;>;布拉格办公室的三十四项罪名&lt;/a>; 2016 年，特朗普向成人电影明星斯托米·丹尼尔斯 (Stormy Daniels) 行贿所引发的案件。然而，事实证明，由于雅各布·贾维茨 (Jacob Javits)，长期以来一直有一项法律旨在将特朗普这样的骗子绳之以法。预订，至少在民事意义上是这样。为什么之前没有人用过呢？这是一个好问题。但是，终于有人做到了，而且迄今为止的结果令人震惊。 ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot;

data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;奥利维亚·罗德里戈 (Olivia Rodrigo) 可以说是汽车史上最著名的驾驶执照的拥有者。 &lt;em>;新冠病毒&lt;/em>;在她刚满十七岁的时候席卷了世界。罗德里戈是一名加州孩子，是一名在家接受教育的儿童演员，也是一名教师和家庭治疗师的女儿，她一直坚持自己的歌曲创作，直到一年后，她制作了《驾驶执照》。这首歌以其直接、深情的方式表达了分手后的孤独、愤怒和解放，很快就在 Spotify 上引起了轰动，一周内的播放量达到了 8000 万次。当疫情缓和，罗德里戈开始在公共场合表演时，她有了斯威夫特式的经历，看到数以万计的歌迷唱着她首张专辑中的歌词，“&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/” 2021/06/07/how-olivia-rodrigo-became-pops-brightest-new-star&quot;>;Sour&lt;/a>;”，和她一起——一夜成名，即使在流行音乐界也是罕见的。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;罗德里戈与制作人和词曲作者丹·尼格罗合作，现在已经二十岁了，并且推出了另一张单音节专辑，名为“&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com” /culture/listening-booth/olivia-rodrigos-star-making-guts&quot;>;胆量&lt;/a>;。”专辑中最受欢迎的单曲是“Vampire”，它也点亮了排行榜。这是一首愤怒的歌曲，针对的是“吸血鬼，名利混蛋，/像一个该死的吸血鬼一样让我流血”。贾·托伦蒂诺 (Jia Tolentino) 为《Vogue》&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vogue.com/article/olivia-rodrigo-august-cover-2023-interview&quot;>;封面故事&lt;/a>;拍摄&lt;em>;Vogue&lt;/em>; ，准确地理解了罗德里戈的音乐，写道：“她并没有生活在泡泡糖储物柜门童话故事的领域，也没有积极地宣称自己是前卫和成熟的。她只是捕捉到了二十岁的感觉，在这个年纪，你有时会燃烧着可笑的欲望，为被视为美丽而兴奋，为别人的期望而愤怒。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;罗德里戈的音乐知识是深入，她的英雄遍布地图：&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/05/22/carole-king-on-capitol-hill&quot;>;卡罗尔·金&lt;/a >;、&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/long-live-the-greatest-hits-album&quot;>;白色条纹&lt;/a>;、&lt;a href=&quot;https ://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/03/23/fiona-apples-art-of-radical-sensitivity&quot;>;菲奥娜·苹果&lt;/a>;，艾拉妮丝·莫莉塞特，洛德，&lt;a href=&quot;https:// /www.newyorker.com/sports/sporting-scene/kelce-swift-is-a-dream-pairing-for-the-nfl&quot;>;泰勒·斯威夫特&lt;/a>;，圣文森特。她从小就在迪士尼电视节目《Bizaardvark》和《歌舞青春：音乐剧：系列》中扮演主角，在舞台和媒体采访方面有着非同寻常的未经训练的指挥能力。我们最近在 Zoom 上花了一个小时讨论 &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://link.chtbl.com/qOucM248&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;出站URL“：”https://link.chtbl.com/qOucM248“}”href =“https://link.chtbl.com/qOucM248”rel =“nofollow noopener”target =“_blank”>;纽约客电台小时&lt;/a>;。罗德里戈在她位于曼哈顿的新公寓里加入了我们的谈话，为了篇幅和清晰度，我们对谈话进行了编辑。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;你对纽约有点陌生，对吧？&lt;/strong>;&lt;/ p>;&lt;p>;是的，我是。我几个月前刚刚得到这套公寓。我仍在探索，但我喜欢它；这是有史以来最伟大的城市。这里源源不断地有如此多的灵感。&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;所以您已经永远离开了洛杉矶？&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline -recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;我不这么认为。我的意思是，我认为洛杉矶永远是我的第一个家，但我喜欢尽可能经常来这里。这是最伟大的。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;我不知道，纽约在音乐上是否更适合你？&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;是的，我真的认为它是一种奇怪的方式，我记得人们总是告诉我这一点——我认识的词曲作者。他们会说，“哦，你必须去纽约。这太鼓舞人心了。”我会翻白眼，然后说：“好吧，当然，我明白了，我明白了。”但实际上我们在格林威治村的 Electric Lady Studios 制作了这张专辑“Guts”的一半 - &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;所以你和 Jimi Hendrix 在同一个房间录音？&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p >;&lt;p>;是的，没错。所有这些令人难以置信的唱片都是在那些房间里制作的，只是——我不知道，你肯定能感受到墙壁里的魔力。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;在过去的日子里，&lt;a href =&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-comment/a-close-read-of-the-beatles-in-get-back&quot;>;披头士乐队&lt;/a>;过去常去录音室，并且，三天后，一张唱片就出来了。现在效果如何？&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;&lt;p>;我的意思是，我不能代表所有人，但我花了很长时间来制作这张唱片“Guts”。真正的工作可能花了一年或一年半的时间。当我开始专辑制作过程时，我有很多保留意见。 《Sour》取得了非常出乎意料、非常令人赞赏的成功，接下来的事情面临着巨大的压力。我脑子里有所有这些声音——我认为人们会喜欢的，不想让人们失望。因此，我花了一段时间才到达一个地方，我终于觉得自己可以发挥创造力，并开始写我想在广播中听到的歌曲，这应该始终是您制作任何东西时的首要关注点。&lt; /p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;您是否害怕成为一击奇迹？&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>; &lt;p>;是的，我的意思是，这太疯狂了。它发生在我职业生涯中如此年轻的时候。我发行了这张专辑，并赢得了格莱美奖，当时我十九岁，我当时想，哇，我已经做了很多我想做的事情。我才十九岁。但是，在某种程度上，这也是一种自由。也许这听起来很奇怪，但在上一张专辑周期中完成这些事情真是太好了。我非常感谢当时发生的一切，以及所有打开的大门。但是，在某种程度上，想到“现在我可以为自己创作音乐”也很好。你知道我的意思？我觉得我现在可以做任何事了。&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;你是在迪士尼表演长大的。你曾出演过《Bizaardvark》和《歌舞青春》节目——小时候你就已经在电视界崭露头角。你是否一直怀有成为一名独唱歌手、成为一名词曲作者的野心、渴望和热情？&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;完全是。我一直很喜欢写歌。那是我的初恋，我年轻时的第一个激情。我记得四岁左右的时候，我就我四岁的问题创作了所有这些疯狂的歌曲。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;你还记得吗？&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;哦，天哪。我妈妈有一段视频，内容是我在超市里唱着失去父母的故事，这对四岁的人来说是一次非常痛苦的经历。我可以想象为什么我会感动地写一首关于它的歌。但是，当我十二岁或十三岁的时候，我开始表演，但我开始在钢琴上弹奏歌曲并学习如何根据和弦写歌曲，从那时起一切就开始起飞了。我爱上了它，从那时起它就成了我的生活。这是这份工作中我最喜欢的部分。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;你似乎拥有——甚至在你比现在年轻得多的时候——拥有广泛的倾听意识。很多事情都传入了你的耳朵。它们是什么？你为什么要听你正在听的东西？&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;是的，我非常信任我的父母对我的音乐品味的认可。我的父母喜欢九十年代的另类摇滚。我是听着《Smashing Pumpkins》、《Hole and the White Stripes》长大的，而且，从很小的时候起，我就爱上了很多女创作歌手。我意识到这就是我想要遵循的血统。我记得大概十三岁的时候，我和妈妈一起去旧货店，第一次买了卡罗尔·金的《Tapestry》，然后就开始玩了。至死。我会一遍又一遍地播放它，并获得所有这些帕特·贝纳塔尔的唱片并一遍又一遍地播放它们，还有乔尼·米切尔，而且，我不知道，我只记得当我很小的时候，有什么东西在我的脑海中响起，就像，哇，这些都是我想效仿的女孩。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;回想起来，你写的第一首歌是什么让你觉得，现在，这是&lt;em>;的东西&lt;/em>;。这不只是开玩笑——这可以带我去某个地方？&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;我的意思是，我写了我年轻时在客厅里闲逛时唱了很多歌，但我实际上记得写过《驾驶执照》。我记得那种感觉。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;这首歌大受欢迎。&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;我非常感谢那首歌。它以当时我完全无法想象的方式使我的职业生涯飞速发展。但我只记得写下那句话，感觉我真的表达了一些东西。我觉得那首歌里有很多我自己的影子，我记得我的感觉得到了恰当的体现，那是一种非常美丽的感觉。我记得我走进录音室向我的制作人展示这首歌，并逐字对他说：“我想我刚刚写了我写过的最喜欢的歌曲。”他说，“好吧，坐下来玩吧。”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;o10lzs&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data- testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;说说写作的经历。效果如何？因为我喜欢它的原因之一是它的开始如此直接。它决定了年龄，它决定了心情，它决定了你在第一行的位置。这是怎么发生的？&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;这是非常具体的。我的意思是，在写这首歌的前几天，我确实拿到了驾照，我很喜欢我新发现的自由。所以我开车在我家附近转悠，听着悲伤的歌曲，哭着思考这段关系，然后我就坐在钢琴前——我是一个非常情绪化的女孩，就像现在一样——然后我就在钢琴前哭了。我写了那首歌。我确实相信创造力有时是超越你的。这就像我们作为自负的人类无法控制的魔法。那是我职业生涯和创意生活中非常神奇的时刻。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;当您刚拿到驾照时，是什么让您在车里感到如此悲伤？我是泽西岛的孩子；你是加州孩子。一些关于驾驶的事——我不知道那是什么。它释放了一些东西。&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;确实如此。当我第一次拿到驾照时，我思考了很多这个问题。我认为开车是你真正独处的唯一时间之一，尤其是作为一个青少年，当你和父母住在家里时。但直到今天我仍然喜欢它。你可以在车里做任何事。你可以听任何你想听的。你可以大声尖叫，没有人会听到你的声音。你的邻居不会敲墙让你闭嘴。我认为也许正是这种孤立感激发了你的这些感受。&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;你在《周六夜现场》发行后多久在《周六夜现场》中表演了《驾驶执照》？&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;哦，天哪，真的很快。 《周六夜现场》是我的第一场演出之一。我想我发行了那首歌，并在伦敦的全英音乐节和“SNL”上表演，这是我歌手兼作曲家职业生涯中的前两场表演，回想起来，这是相当狂野的。&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;那是我第一次听说你的时候。我当时正在看《周六夜现场》，今天我又看了一遍录像带。当你即将走上舞台，面对数以百万计的观众时，你脑子里在想什么？你在发抖吗？你感觉怎么样？你脑子里在想什么？&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;我很害怕。我什至不打算摆出一副样子。我很勇敢。我很害怕。我记得在更衣室里——《周六夜现场》的更衣室是有史以来最酷的地方。墙上挂满了您所有英雄的照片，他们曾与您在同一个舞台上表演过。我刚刚完全崩溃了。我很紧张，很害怕。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;崩溃是什么意思？因为你确实在舞台上成功了！&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;我确实成功了！我当时正在哭。 My producer was there, thankfully, who I love and trust so much, and I was crying to him. I&#39;m, like, “I don&#39;t know if I can do it. I don&#39;t know if I can do it. I&#39;m so scared.” He&#39;s, like, “You got it.我爱你。 You can do it.” So his support meant a lot to me in that moment.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;Once you open your mouth and the music starts coming out, do you calm down? What does that feel like just as a human being, as a human body in front of the cameras, knowing what you know?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Performing shows and performing songs on TV are so vastly different. I love performing shows so much more. I think you can kind of get into a flow, and there&#39;s energy that&#39;s being exchanged. When you&#39;re performing on TV, sometimes it&#39;s a little hard because it&#39;s just one or two songs, and you just have to be in it from the get-go, and it&#39;s just a different experience. But I&#39;m still learning and growing, and I feel lucky to get to perform to this day. And lucky that people want to sit in the crowd and listen.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;Your first album struck me as attached somehow to the time of the pandemic.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Yeah. I actually wrote most of it during the pandemic, and I credit a lot of the songs to that isolation, like we were talking about earlier. I actually told myself I&#39;d write a song every day as long as the pandemic lasted—because, you know, we thought that the pandemic was going to be two weeks. So I&#39;m, like, I can do it. Turned out to be, like, forever.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;That&#39;s fourteen songs!&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;[&lt;em>;Laughs.&lt;/em>;] Yeah. But I did that for maybe five or six months, and it really helped me to hone my songwriting craft, and have discipline in my writing. Also, I think that people maybe wanted to hear all those sad songs during the pandemic. I think we were all, as a collective, facing emotions that we hadn&#39;t processed because of our new surroundings, where we couldn&#39;t distract ourselves. So, yeah, I think that the pandemic definitely is a big part of that album.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;When you&#39;re writing a song, sad or not sad, how much of it is just straight from your soul, or how much of it is sometimes a character? It seems to me that it can be both. Songwriting can do both things.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;w9smq&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Yeah, I think it can be both. I think it doesn&#39;t have to be mutually exclusive. I think that I am very multifaceted as a person, and some days I feel like I want to be super sarcastic and satirical and I feel angry and pissed. And, other times, I&#39;m feeling really sentimental and want to write a guitar ballad. I think that it&#39;s fun to play with different aspects of your personality, but I always try to make it seem genuine and true to who I am on a soul level, too.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;What does it feel like, physically, when you&#39;re onstage in front of a huge crowd and you&#39;re singing a ballad like “Drivers License” in front of an immense audience?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;It&#39;s really crazy. I think that feeling will probably never get old. It&#39;s just the power of music. You write a song in twenty minutes in your living room, and then a year later you&#39;re in front of ten thousand people and they know every word. It&#39;s just—music is so magical. It touches humans on a level that I don&#39;t think any other medium does. I feel so grateful that I get to do that for my job.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;Does your heart race? Does the top of your head fly into the crowd when you&#39;re singing something like “Vampire”?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Yeah. I mean, you know what&#39;s really cool? My favorite songs to sing are the really angry ones, especially on tour. I love looking out in the audience, and sometimes I&#39;ll see these girls and they&#39;re so young, they&#39;re seven or eight, and they&#39;re screaming these angry songs and getting so hyped up and so enraged, and I just think that&#39;s the coolest thing ever. That&#39;s not something you&#39;d see on the street, but it&#39;s so cool that people get to express all those emotions through music.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;If you had to think of one moment, or one image, from your last tour that&#39;s seared into your memory, into your brain, what might it be?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Glastonbury. Performing at Glastonbury was incredible.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;This is the big outdoor festival in Britain.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Yeah. It&#39;s actually the first music festival I&#39;d ever been to, and I got to play it. It&#39;s just awesome. And it was the most people I had ever played for.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;How many people were there?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Oh, I think it was, like, sixty thousand or something like that. Pretty crazy to think about. That was a really great moment in my career. And the Supreme Court &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/07/04/we-are-not-going-back-to-the-time-before-roe-we-are-going-somewhere-worse&quot;>;overturned Roe v. Wade&lt;/a>; the day before I went onstage, and Lily Allen and I dedicated “Fuck You” to the Supreme Court that day. I remember feeling so angry, and being around so many of my friends who were so angry, and didn&#39;t know what to do or what to say. In that moment, music was such an outlet for us, and looking out into the crowd and seeing everyone who felt the same way—it just reminded me what the true purpose of music is.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;You mean as something of release and emotional force?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Of everything: of protest and of release and togetherness. Seeing an entire crowd sing that, and share that emotion in that moment, is just transcendent.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;Let&#39;s talk about your new album. When you wrote your first album, “Sour,” you had so much that you wanted to express and get off your chest and get off your mind as a young person. How is the Olivia Rodrigo of now different from the one who sat down to write “Sour”?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Oh, my gosh, she is worlds different. I&#39;ve changed so much just between the ages of seventeen and twenty. In that time period, you grow. I feel like I grew twenty-five years in three years. So, yeah, she&#39;s vastly different. But I definitely remember the fear of sitting down and trying to write this second album, and thinking, Oh, my God, I&#39;m not a seventeen-year-old girl going through her first heartbreak anymore. That&#39;s such a universally relatable experience. How am I going to make something that people can get behind?&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;Is it the pressure of writing something to match and maybe even outdistance what you&#39;ve just done? Or is it that your life has gotten two hundred per cent weirder because of all that comes with stardom and all the rest? What was the conversation like in your head?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Yeah. I think a mix of both. You know how people always are, like, “Your only competition is your past self.” And I don&#39;t know if that necessarily works for me. I don&#39;t know how I could ever follow up such crazy, unexpected success. I put that pressure on myself for a long time. Jack White is a big hero of mine—I met him for the first time maybe a year ago—and he wrote me a letter with a few pieces of advice. One of them was that your only job is to write music that you would like to hear on the radio. I was really struggling with all the pressure: Are people on Twitter going to like what this song sounds like? There was all this gunk in my head. And I remember reading that, and it really ignited something in me. That really helped.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;You said before that sometimes you write a song in twenty minutes. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/10/17/leonard-cohen-makes-it-darker&quot;>;Leonard Cohen&lt;/a>; took years to write “Hallelujah.” How does this work for you? Do you keep a notebook around? Do you knock it off really quickly? What&#39;s the creative process?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;37n98p&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;I love that Leonard Cohen story so much. For me, every song is different. I mean, there are some songs that come so easily, and you&#39;re, like, Wow, thank you, universe! This just landed in my lap. Thanks! So appreciative. And other songs kind of take some polishing. On this album, “Guts,” I really learned how to look at songwriting as a craft, and not just this pouring my heart out at the piano like I was doing when I was seventeen. These songs definitely took longer to write, and we just sat with them for a little longer.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;You took a poetry class at USC?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Yeah.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;When was that, and why did you do that?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;That was last year. I mean, I was homeschooled my whole life. There&#39;s a song on the album called “Ballad of a Homeschooled Girl”—it&#39;s about me dealing with the consequences of that. I was homeschooled my whole life, and I always wanted to go to college. I was always very curious. There&#39;s so much that I want to know in this world. I really enjoyed taking that class. I&#39;ve always been super interested in poetry, and I&#39;ve been writing it for a long time. It was really informative, and I feel very grateful that I got that opportunity. We actually turned one of the poems that I wrote as an assignment in the poetry class into a song on the album, called “Lacy.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;Are there any poems or poets that you read that are helpful to you? Not just as a human being but as an artist?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Yeah. I mean, you brought up Leonard Cohen. I read lots of his poetry while I was making “Guts.” I think he&#39;s incredible. That&#39;s an endless well of inspiration. And I wrote the poem “Lacy” with inspiration from the poem “Daddy,” by Sylvia Plath.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;On the show “Girls”—which . 。 。 I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve watched “Girls.”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I haven&#39;t watched it yet. Everyone&#39;s been recommending it to me, though. I really need to.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;So Lena Dunham is the creator of it, and she&#39;s also the star of the show, and she&#39;s a searching young woman. She wants to be a writer, and at a certain point she announces to her parents, “I think I may be the voice of my generation. Or at least a voice. Of a generation.” And now you&#39;re being branded, whether you like it or not, the voice of a generation, the voice of Gen Z. What do you make of all that?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;I tend to not think about it, just because it&#39;s kind of a scary thought. I don&#39;t think of myself that way. I just try to be as much myself as I possibly can, and try to do the best work I can. I mean, it&#39;s obviously super flattering when people say that. I love my generation. I am proud to be a part of it. So I guess it&#39;s a good thing.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;Social media makes its presence known in your songs. Do you also look at social media to see how people are perceiving you? It seems like a big burden.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Yeah, that&#39;s an understatement. It&#39;s definitely a burden. I&#39;ve gotten better at it the more that I&#39;ve been on it. It&#39;s a part of this job that I think is a necessary evil. There are some parts of social media that are awesome. I love connecting with people who I normally wouldn&#39;t have gotten the chance to, but it is weird. And I feel like I&#39;m growing in front of people, which is really strange. I&#39;ve been in front of people for a long time, and sometimes it can be stifling to feel like you&#39;re always being seen. But I don&#39;t know. I have a good relationship with it these days.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;Tell me about that burden.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I think for a long time I felt like I couldn&#39;t make mistakes, or I felt pressure to be a good role model. I grew up on these kids&#39; shows where being a good role model is very important—as it should be. And I always felt like I couldn&#39;t be a normal kid and go out and do stupid things and make mistakes and learn. At the end of the day, making mistakes is the only way you do learn. But in this album, in particular, I&#39;m grappling with those feelings and talking about the mistakes that I did end up making, and am being open and honest about them. And that was kind of cathartic for me.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;Like what, for example?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I mean, there&#39;s a song, “Making the Bed,” that I really love. One of the lyrics is “Sometimes I feel like I don&#39;t wanna be where I am, / Gettin&#39; drunk at a club with my fair-weather friends.” That&#39;s the chorus. And I was kind of nervous to say that—I&#39;m twenty years old, which is not “of age” yet, I guess. And I was nervous to put that one out there. I&#39;m always so conscious that young kids are listening to my music, and people&#39;s parents are listening to my music. But, at the end of the day, all of my heroes are my heroes because they are unapologetically who they are, and they express themselves without fear of being criticized. So that&#39;s what I try to tell myself.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;There comes a time with a lot of artists that you idolize—Leonard Cohen, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/10/31/a-unified-field-theory-of-bob-dylan&quot;>;Bob Dylan&lt;/a>;—they get sick of hearing about themselves being described as the voice of a generation. They rebel at that, and then they want to do what they want to do, and an audience doesn&#39;t always like it. Do you feel that for a third album, and a fourth album, you have to fulfill the expectations of your fans, of people that are out there in the crowd and buying records and all those things?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;3nx1ff&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;It&#39;s a really great question. I suppose I won&#39;t know until I embark on making my third record, but I think one of the biggest goals in my career, a real point to emphasize, is that I always want to be challenging myself. I want to make music that&#39;s ever-evolving. And even if people don&#39;t like that, well—all of my favorite artists are people whose every album is a choice, and something ambitious. So, if I can do that my whole career, I&#39;ll be very happy.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;Are there particular artists that you look to and you say, I like the way that person evolved not only as an artist but as a person and as an independent being?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Yeah, I mean, I really idolize Alanis Morissette. I think she&#39;s amazing, and I think her records are so human and perfectly capture what it is to be human. And I think they&#39;re really healing.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;Have you ever met her?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Yeah, I&#39;ve met her a few times, and she is wonderful. She&#39;s one of my inspirations on a human level. I think she&#39;s handled her career with such grace and warmth, and has a groundedness to her that I really appreciate. She&#39;s a bit of a guiding light for me.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;On this album, on “Guts,” you seem to be reaching back even further in history. The opening track, which is about the impossible standards of being a woman in America, starts out kind of Joni Mitchell but then turns abruptly midway into a song that sounds like the riot-grrrl scene. How do you position your music in a longer tradition of rebellion?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I love that question. I think female rebellion music, for lack of a better description, is my favorite music ever. I&#39;ve been obsessed with the riot-grrrl punk scene for a while, and “All-American Bitch” was my stab at trying to write a song like that. I feel a lot of kinship toward women, and I love writing songs about these female feelings of anger and resentment that aren&#39;t so easily expressible in everyday life. It&#39;s one of my favorites on the album.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;How do you look at your now reasonably distant past? You read about a lot of women who were on TV as kids, and they look back on their early careers and feel sad about the experience, and exploited. Do you feel that you got through all that and were decently treated, and that it was a healthy experience, or there were downsides to it as well?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I do. I can certainly see how people wouldn&#39;t have that experience. I think it&#39;s a very strange way to grow up. I feel really lucky that I was surrounded by wonderful people. My parents are wonderful and so grounded, and are always looking out for me. I just owe everything to them. I don&#39;t think that I would have the attitude toward it that I do if it wasn&#39;t for them. But, yeah, it is really strange, and you sacrifice a lot. I didn&#39;t have a normal childhood, so that I could have that career. I&#39;m really grateful for everything that happened. But it&#39;s definitely—it&#39;s a give-and-take, just like everything in life.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;What did you miss most?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I actually realized this year how much I missed—or I feel like I missed out on—going to high school, and being around people my own age. That camaraderie feels important to me. I grew up on sets where I was around forty-five-year-old guys all the time. So I had a relatively lonely childhood. Which is OK I mean, that&#39;s why I turned to writing songs and making music and all of that. But that&#39;s definitely one of the pitfalls.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;And fame at the level that you&#39;re experiencing it now, which is pretty rare—is it lonely, or is it something else?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I don&#39;t know what it is. Gosh, I feel incredibly lucky to have great people around me, but it certainly is trickier navigating social life and relationships of any kind. It&#39;s definitely something that I have to put more thought into. But social life and relationships are hard regardless of what your career is.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;And how much do you care and not care about the kind of fame that&#39;s outside of you, but very present? You had to deal with this kind of back-and-forth about Taylor Swift, for example. Can you brush it off pretty easily, or does it get to you?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;It depends on the day. I think that, ever since “Drivers License” came out, I&#39;ve been keen on separating Olivia the person and Olivia the persona—the person that people criticize even when they don&#39;t know me. And that&#39;s really helped. That keeps me grounded.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;Is there a theme that does connect the titles of your two albums, “Sour” and “Guts”? They&#39;re some of the bluntest album titles that I know.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I know. They pack a punch.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;Maybe indigestion or something.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;[&lt;em>;Laughs.&lt;/em>;] Yeah, I love four-letter words of all kinds. I love swear words, too, clearly, which is very evident in my albums. I think they&#39;re cool and succinct. And I&#39;d actually had the name “Guts” for a while. I had it when I was writing “Sour.” I thought it was a cool word that meant a lot of things. “Guts” can mean bravery, and “trusting your gut”—intuition. And “spilling your guts” is telling everyone your secrets. So it&#39;s a word that I&#39;ve always really loved.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;When you&#39;re making these records, do the songs that eventually take off—are those the ones that you&#39;re expecting to take off? Do you know when you have a hit?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;You never really know, especially in today&#39;s pop landscape. I feel like so many of the biggest pop songs are songs that maybe wouldn&#39;t have been a pop hit fifteen years ago. And I love that. I love that people are itching for something a little different. But, yeah, I think you don&#39;t really know until it comes out. I&#39;m always surprised by which songs people gravitate toward. ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot;

As the WGA negotiated for rights that its members should have had years ago, including protection against &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tag/artificial-intelligence-ai&quot;>;AI&lt;/a>; and fair pay for work shown on streaming platforms, “Strike Force Five,” on Spotify, reminded us why we&#39;ve missed late night and its writers.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;We&#39;ve been reminded of late night&#39;s value a few times in recent years: first, circa the post-Letterman, post-Leno, post-Conan, post-Jon Stewart “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/on-television/how-the-daily-show-squandered-the-opportunity-that-was-trevor-noah&quot;>;Daily Show&lt;/a>;” changing of the guard, then during the Trump Administration, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tag/coronavirus&quot;>;the pandemic&lt;/a>;, and then the strike. In the midst of a crisis, great late-night TV can feel like catharsis, even a kind of lifeline. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/notes-on-hollywood/scenes-from-hollywoods-hot-labor-summer&quot;>;The WGA and &lt;em >;SAG-AFTRA&lt;/em>; strikes&lt;/a>;, though not a pandemic-level crisis, have been a public reckoning with inequality and the economics of the digital age, and they resulted in the near-total suspension of production of new TV and movies. Just by existing, “Strike Force Five” helped us contend with that in a useful way. The podcast didn&#39;t produce the kind of satisfaction that late night&#39;s best monologue jokes and sketches, written by those long-striking writers, can deliver—and, if it had, the podcast&#39;s premise could have backfired. But the show had a value of its own. It was novel to hear these five guys together, vocally supporting the strike while being mutually warm and respectful and busting one another&#39;s chops.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Since it&#39;s a podcast, not network television, Colbert slings cheerful F-bombs, Kimmel doesn&#39;t have to interview stars of various Disney projects, and Oliver revels in the freedom of being able “to say what you think is true, not what you are told is legally defensible.” There&#39;s an element of late-night-geek fun—probably intentionally so—as we hear them compare notes on sets, opening sequences, and misguided ideas. Colbert says that he collects swag from ephemeral talk shows (a “Chevy Chase Show” hat, a “Pat Sajak Show” silk jacket), to remind himself that it can all go away; Meyers says a redesign was inspired by Alec Baldwin asking Lorne Michaels, “Why does Seth&#39;s set look like a sushi restaurant in Burbank?”; and Kimmel says that his manager once contacted Ben &amp;amp; Jerry&#39;s about a Kimmel-branded ice-cream flavor, à la The Tonight Dough Starring Jimmy Fallon and Stephen Colbert&#39;s Americone Dream, and that Ben &amp;amp; Jerry&#39;s wasn&#39;t interested. (If you&#39;ve ever stared at a supermarket freezer and idly wondered about this, as I have, there&#39;s your answer.)&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;There&#39;s some reading-between-the-bonhomie intrigue, too—much of it involving Fallon. The podcast doesn&#39;t address the September 7th &lt;em>;Rolling Stone&lt;/em>; investigative &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-features/jimmy-fallon-tonight-show-toxic-work-environment-crying-rooms-nbc-1234819421/&quot;>;piece&lt;/a>; that depicts him as an unkind leader with an unhappy staff. But even aside from that, Fallon, despite the Strike Force&#39;s five-way jollity, seems like the group&#39;s distractible odd man out. Toward the end of the second episode, Colbert, laughing, reveals that Fallon has just texted them all, saying that he wants to wrap it up. “So there&#39;s a &lt;em>;limit&lt;/em>; to how much you want to help the staff,” Colbert says. They all tease him a bit. “It&#39;s so hot where I am,” Fallon protests, adding, “I&#39;ve got things to do!” He&#39;s also the group&#39;s Joey Tribbiani. We learn that, while fishing on the Snake River with Kimmel, Fallon asked the guide if the river would go in a circle (“I thought it was a lazy river!”); he tells a story about trying to treat a cough by sleeping with chopped onions in his socks, to his co-hosts&#39; collective incredulity; he says he&#39;s learning about grilling meat, describes his fancy equipment, and admits to burning stuff. (“Have you ever tried boiling hot dogs in beer?” he adds. “&lt;em>;Game-changer&lt;/em>;.”) Then there&#39;s this incredible exchange, about summer reading:&lt;/p>;&lt;blockquote >;&lt;div >;&lt;p>;&lt;em >;Colbert&lt;/em>;: So you never finished “Why You Should Read Moby Dick.”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/blockquote>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;blockquote >;&lt;div >;&lt;p>;&lt;em >;Fallon&lt;/em>;: No, but I enjoyed it, up to a point . 。 。 。 I was, for two or three weeks, &lt;em>;obsessed&lt;/em>;.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/blockquote>;&lt;blockquote >;&lt;div >;&lt;p>;&lt;em >;Kimmel&lt;/em>;: Maybe there needs to be a shorter book, called “Why Read &#39;Why Read Moby Dick.&#39; ”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/blockquote>;&lt;blockquote >;&lt;div >;&lt;p>;&lt;em >;Colbert&lt;/em>;: Or “How to Read &#39;Why to Read Moby Dick.&#39; ”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/blockquote>;&lt;blockquote >;&lt;div >;&lt;p>;&lt;em >;Kimmel&lt;/em>;: Or just “How to Read.”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/blockquote>;&lt;blockquote >;&lt;div >;&lt;p>;&lt;em >;Meyers&lt;/em>;: Based on what happened to Captain Ahab . 。 。 to be able to let go of your obsession is a far healthier outcome.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/blockquote>;&lt;blockquote >;&lt;div >;&lt;p>;&lt;em >;Colbert&lt;/em>;: Do you have a favorite character from the book you didn&#39;t read?&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/blockquote>;&lt;blockquote >;&lt;div >;&lt;p>;&lt;em >;Fallon&lt;/em>;: Uh . 。 。 Ishmael! That fact that there&#39;s this guy . 。 。 I would say, what is Ishmael? In his thirties?&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/blockquote>;&lt;blockquote >;&lt;div >;&lt;p>;&lt;em >;Oliver&lt;/em>; (sounding especially British): Hey, Fallon, I don&#39;t know how we did it, but Herman Melville just killed himself.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/blockquote>;&lt;p >;Later, Colbert tells the others that he&#39;s prepared a quiz. “Fallon, there&#39;s great news,” Oliver says. “The quiz is about the first line of &#39;Moby Dick.&#39; ” (Here and elsewhere, the podcast made me laugh.) All of this may remind us that Fallon&#39;s “Tonight Show,” centered on a host who&#39;s best with amiable fluff, succeeded NBC&#39;s astoundingly badly handled Conan-Leno debacle, and that Fallon&#39;s outsized role in the late-night landscape is partly a by-product of network executives&#39; ineptitude. At one point in the podcast, Fallon attempts a game-show experiment for the guys and their wives, and fails to clarify who is meant to answer what about whom. Chaos and mass hysterics quickly result, and Fallon dissolves into helpless giggles. “I need segment producers so bad, and writers,” he says, barely able to speak. “I miss everybody so bad.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Strike Force Five” includes two notably powerful moments. The first demonstrates the importance of the strike and the potential that the podcast had to communicate it. Colbert, in order to call attention to one of the WGA&#39;s negotiating points, plays an ad for a sponsor that sounds like it&#39;s read by Kimmel, Meyers, Oliver, and Fallon but which Colbert has created with AI The voices are almost uncanny, and even sound like they&#39;re reading copy rather than speaking normally. The real co-hosts are flabbergasted.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“We got a year left till we&#39;re all dead,” Meyers says.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“We&#39;re fucked. It&#39;s over,” Oliver says.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“I don&#39;t understand what&#39;s happening!” Kimmel says.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“This is why the guild&#39;s got to hold the line,” Colbert says. “That cost me thirty bucks, by the way.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The other moment comes from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/podcast/political-scene/jon-stewart-thats-not-cancel-culture&quot;>;Jon Stewart&lt;/a>;, who seems to descend upon the Strike Force like a ghost from the future, dispensing wisdom about nightly comedy TV. “Here&#39;s the thing about what we do, guys,” he says. “When you leave what we do, you disappear. Seinfeld leaves and you still watch him every night at 11,” and you laugh, and enjoy a fun sitcom forever. “When we leave, you disappear. And if Oprah can leave and the world still turns . 。 .” There&#39;s a heavy pause, followed by nervous, explosive riffing. “We make egg salad, guys,” Stewart concludes. “No matter how good the egg salad is, after three days, you&#39;re, like, &#39;Can someone fuckin&#39; throw that out?&#39; ” As of Wednesday, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/notes-on-hollywood/joy-in-los-angeles-as-the-writers-reach-a-tentative-deal&quot;>;one entertainment-world strike is over&lt;/a>;; let&#39;s hope that the other ends well, too. For now, bring on the egg salad. ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;9f40qml&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot;

>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;In October, 2020, the Russian director Dmitry Krymov staged his own version of Thornton Wilder&#39;s “Our Town” called “Everyone is Here” for the Moscow theatre School of the Modern Play. At the time, Krymov didn&#39;t know that Russia would launch a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, nor that after he signed a public letter criticizing the war a temporary work trip to Philadelphia would become permanent exile. Yet “Everyone Is Here,” a video of which floats around the Internet, still seems very much like a farewell.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;A digressive, at times almost witchy reënvisioning of Wilder&#39;s plainspoken classic from 1938, it begins with a real black cat slipping through a door before the play&#39;s familiar characters materialize in swirls of smoke. After a few dreamlike scenes, a man in a cable-knit sweater and sneakers interrupts the action, claiming to be the director. Krymov, or rather his avatar (played by Aleksandr Ovchinnikov), tells the audience that he has been reconstructing a touring American production of “Our Town” that he saw in Moscow when he was eighteen. He reminisces about his past, introduces his long-dead parents, and reënacts spreading an old friend&#39;s ashes, struggling comically with the urn. Eventually Anton Chekhov (two actors in a trench coat) visits the Sakhalin penal colony. Wilder would never have recognized it.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Or perhaps he would have. The sixty-eight-year-old Krymov, who often writes his own adaptations, assumes the American playwright&#39;s cool-eyed stance toward the inevitability of loss, exhuming his own past in the process. Krymov frequently drills into the work of a great artist—Tolstoy, Pushkin, Chekhov—only to break into his own autobiographical substrate. There&#39;s grief down there, but also a great deal of comedy. His critically acclaimed productions, full of antic puppets and rousing folk music and the occasional surprise volleyball game, recall a circus fairground at night, a wild, inviting darkness where all the buskers are ghosts. “Everyone is Here” was nominated for five Golden Mask awards, the Russian equivalent of the Tony, but once Krymov became persona non grata his name disappeared from the posters. Officially, at least, no one was there.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;And now Krymov is here. Close to a million Russians have emigrated during the war, flooding into surrounding countries, but unlike some of the other openly anti-Kremlin superstar directors, who fled to Europe or Israel, Krymov has come to the United States. This month, he opens a double bill at La Mama, in New York, called “Big Trip,” which consists of two programs on different nights: “Pushkin &#39;Eugene Onegin&#39; in our own words,” a reimagining of an old Krymov piece, and “Three love stories near the railroad,” a new, tragicomical triptych that adapts three texts by Eugene O&#39;Neill and Ernest Hemingway. His first production in New York since a tour of his expressionist “Opus No. 7,” in 2013, “Big Trip” will also serve as proof of concept for a newly formed theatre company, a body of mostly young, mostly American artists called Krymov Lab NYC.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;La Mama, in the Bowery, isn&#39;t just Off Broadway, it&#39;s &lt;em>;Off&lt;/em>; Off. In early September, a few weeks before opening night, Krymov met with his small company in La Mama&#39;s rehearsal complex on Great Jones Street, in one of a stack of low, tin-ceilinged rooms where avant-gardists have been rehearsing for half a century. The actors, who had been on break for the summer, were trying on costumes for the first time. They had been rehearsing on and off in the course of a year, and had held a chaotic series of showings in December. (The night I saw it, an audience member took a prop and refused to give it back.)&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Krymov (Dima to his friends and admirers) is a large man—not tall, exactly, but bear-on-his-hind-legs imposing—with a wispy, silver Prince Valiant haircut framing a face that&#39;s moon-calm and smooth. His glasses, which have an aviator-style bar across the top, make his eyebrows look perpetually raised. His English is solid and idiomatic, though he sometimes chooses to speak through an interpreter, his lead producer Tatyana Khaikin. He&#39;s never as puzzled as he seems to be.&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;It sometimes takes only a glancing contact with Krymov&#39;s work to make a fan, even an acolyte. The actors and designers in the Lab have come together by a number of paths—several are from Yale&#39;s drama school, where Krymov has guest-taught and directed, and some trained in Russia, encountering his work in its original habitat. One of the Lab&#39;s producers and performers, Tim Eliot, for instance, was a student in the American Repertory Theatre&#39;s Institute for Advanced Theatre Training, which, when it was still running its graduate program, conducted a semester in Moscow. There he saw “Opus No. 7,” was “thrilled and awestruck,” and, a decade later, fell into Krymov and Khaikin&#39;s orbit in New York, when Krymov was teaching at the New School. (I was in an earlier class of that same ART program, but I first saw a Krymov piece in Poland, in 2009, at the Dialog theatre festival in Wrocław. “Opus No. 7” was a hot ticket, and I watched it sitting on the floor, crammed partly under someone&#39;s folding chair.)&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;During that September rehearsal, several Russian friends and supporters—including Krymov&#39;s wife, producer, and muse, Inna, and Isaac Koyfman, a lawyer and theatre aficionado turned president of Krymov Lab NYC&#39;s newly formed board—were crammed into the back half of the room. The company&#39;s costume designer, Luna Gomberg, owlish behind huge glasses, was sewing feverishly next to a costume rack, on which a black-and-white picture of Inna&#39;s laughing face hung on one side, with the women&#39;s clothes, and a mask of Dmitry hung on the other. Inna (tanned, tiny, peripatetic, brilliant) was chortling about Krymov getting stung by a jellyfish in France. “The last kiss of summer!” she told me.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;GenericCallout&quot;>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;A person holding a ballet dancer in front of an audience&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650c6b4fa7c2698078909c19/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Shaw_DmitryKrymov_3.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650c6b4fa7c2698078909c19/master/w_120,c_limit/Shaw_DmitryKrymov_3.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650c6b4fa7c2698078909c19/master/w_240,c_limit/Shaw_DmitryKrymov_3.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650c6b4fa7c2698078909c19/master/w_320,c_limit/Shaw_DmitryKrymov_3.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650c6b4fa7c2698078909c19/master/w_640,c_limit/Shaw_DmitryKrymov_3.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650c6b4fa7c2698078909c19/master/w_960,c_limit/Shaw_DmitryKrymov_3.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650c6b4fa7c2698078909c19/master/w_1280,c_limit/Shaw_DmitryKrymov_3.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650c6b4fa7c2698078909c19/master/w_1600,c_limit/Shaw_DmitryKrymov_3.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;Krymov Lab NYC rehearse at La Mama in the Bowery.&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;For the first section of “Three love stories near the railroad,” a clown-inspired dramatization of Hemingway&#39;s short story “Hills Like White Elephants,” Krymov was directing Jackson Scott, an actor who is also a gifted flamenco guitarist, on how to act like a director (though not a Krymov avatar, this time). Scott was rehearsing the prologue in which he introduces the audience to the set—a table and chair and a sad cardboard slab meant to represent a second chair. Almost immediately Krymov popped up to interrupt him. “You are the &lt;em>;director&lt;/em>;! There was supposed to be a &lt;em>;chair&lt;/em>;! You think, All staff are lazy &lt;em>;like usual&lt;/em>;, but you are very polite. 。 。 .” he said to Scott, demonstrating the tight smile and chopping hand motions he wanted. He then told an anecdote about the chansonnier Jacques Brel—“He was singing a song when the sound in the mike went out. He finished the song, &#39;da da da,&#39; and then walked offstage and began to Beat. The. Sound. Man.” He mimed a vicious walloping. Scott waited for the story to get a little less violent, but that was all. In Scott&#39;s second run-through, his gestures did seem more vigorous.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;This direction was explicit, but Krymov often tells his actors what he wants in more elliptical terms. He might say to a performer, as I saw him do in April, your character “turns humiliation into poetry in front of your eyes.” Anatoly Beliy, a lead actor of the Moscow Art Theatre of Chekhov, starred in one of Krymov&#39;s Moscow productions and describes this lyricism as his “bird language,” a Russian expression that means a gibberish that only those intimately familiar with it will understand; performing for Krymov, he says, is a process of learning to speak it. Krymov&#39;s style offers either free fall or freedom, an intoxicating sensation for some performers. “He treats actors in rehearsal like professionals—&#39;you have your “acting kitchen” and it&#39;s your kitchen. I won&#39;t butt in,&#39; ” Beliy told me. Krymov would say, “You don&#39;t have to ask me, just—you know, just do it.” (Beliy, who was born in Ukraine and was one of the most famous theatrical and movie stars in Russia, left soon after the war began. He is now living in Israel and performing for Russian-speaking audiences.)&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;In rehearsal, Krymov was laughing with the actors, but he was also constantly asking for the impossible. There was even some literal bird language: Krymov told Scott that he should introduce the components of “Three love stories” as “chicken without salt, chicken with salt, and chicken with sauce.” The statement passed unremarked as, in short order, a set piece collapsed, and the sound designer tested a loud train whistle. What had Krymov meant? Was this an actable note? I never found out. By the time the set got put back up, the circus had already moved on.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Krymov was openly critical of Putin before the war, but, even after he signed an open letter protesting the “annexation” of Crimea, in 2014, he was largely left alone by the authorities. “In all the years I was working in the theatre, the past twenty years, nobody ever told me what I&#39;m allowed to do,” he told me. “I never experienced censorship in my life as a director.” His producer, Khaikin, though, told me that the first Dmitry Krymov Laboratory, which was in residence at Moscow&#39;s School for Dramatic Art did break up some six years ago, after Krymov found his group being edged out of favorable performance slots and pressured about content. Reportedly, at the time, he quoted the writer Andrei Sinyavsky in an address to the audience, essentially equating himself to a famous Soviet dissident.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Working as an independent director, going from theatre to theatre, in the past decade, Krymov reached something like cultural ubiquity. He had won numerous Golden Masks, and was regularly fêted at international festivals. The scholar Anatoly Smeliansky, the former literary head of the Moscow Art Theatre, noted that in early 2022, Krymov had so many productions happening simultaneously that he would sometimes lose track. “Dima got into a taxicab and realized he did not know which of the five theatres he was working in he was supposed to go to,” Smeliansky said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;On February 25, 2022, the day after Russia invaded Ukraine, Krymov flew to the United States, ready to resume work on a production of “The Cherry Orchard,” which had been in development at the Wilma Theatre in Philadelphia. It was on his way to the airport that he co-signed the letter protesting the invasion. Once he and Inna landed, Krymov came to understand, through friends and frightened colleagues, that he should not return. “It was absolutely impossible to go back and work there because people who were there understood my attitude toward everything that was happening, and I wasn&#39;t hiding it,” he told me. He gave an interview to Voice of America, in which he compared the invasion to the horrors of the Second World War. He had nine shows playing in different theatres across Moscow, and seven of them were summarily shut down. “For some reason,” he told me, “they left two shows, and they said, &#39;If you want the show to run, your name should be taken out of the poster.&#39; I said, &#39;Of course.&#39; ” Those shows, too, are gone now.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;feature-large-callout&quot; >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;GroupCalloutWrapper&quot;>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;Director Dmitry Krymov making hand gestures in a conversation with two people&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650c6b53a6ca2173f433e26b/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Shaw_DmitryKrymov_5.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650c6b53a6ca2173f433e26b/master/w_120,c_limit/Shaw_DmitryKrymov_5.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650c6b53a6ca2173f433e26b/master/w_240,c_limit/Shaw_DmitryKrymov_5.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650c6b53a6ca2173f433e26b/master/w_320,c_limit/Shaw_DmitryKrymov_5.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650c6b53a6ca2173f433e26b/master/w_640,c_limit/Shaw_DmitryKrymov_5.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650c6b53a6ca2173f433e26b/master/w_960,c_limit/Shaw_DmitryKrymov_5.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650c6b53a6ca2173f433e26b/master/w_1280,c_limit/Shaw_DmitryKrymov_5.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650c6b53a6ca2173f433e26b/master/w_1600,c_limit/Shaw_DmitryKrymov_5.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;“The entire company is an endless improv,” Eliot says of Krymov&#39;s process. “We&#39;re all following the lead conductor of the improvisation.”&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;Four people rehearsing a play&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650c6b57172aded8151b2f2d/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Shaw_DmitryKrymov_4.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650c6b57172aded8151b2f2d/master/w_120,c_limit/Shaw_DmitryKrymov_4.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650c6b57172aded8151b2f2d/master/w_240,c_limit/Shaw_DmitryKrymov_4.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650c6b57172aded8151b2f2d/master/w_320,c_limit/Shaw_DmitryKrymov_4.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650c6b57172aded8151b2f2d/master/w_640,c_limit/Shaw_DmitryKrymov_4.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650c6b57172aded8151b2f2d/master/w_960,c_limit/Shaw_DmitryKrymov_4.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650c6b57172aded8151b2f2d/master/w_1280,c_limit/Shaw_DmitryKrymov_4.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650c6b57172aded8151b2f2d/master/w_1600,c_limit/Shaw_DmitryKrymov_4.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Smeliansky calls the flight of so many important directors—ten or twelve, he guesses, from Moscow and St. Petersburg—a “catastrophe for the national theatre.” He likens it to the Soviet expulsion in 1922 of intellectuals on the so-called Philosopher&#39;s Ship. “Lenin sent out of Russia the greatest Russian scientists, philosophers, and he cut the head off the country,” Smeliansky says. “It is like that time.”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;gxrj26&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;In Krymov&#39;s first season of expatriation, he went to Latvia, France, Israel. State-run theatres, with their year-round companies of actors, predictable funding, and, in some cases, Russian-speaking audiences, still want Krymov&#39;s heady mixture of literary elaboration and toybox visual invention. But he chose to be based in New York. He speaks English; he has friends here; he has taught and worked on the East Coast. Still, it&#39;s been a bit of an adjustment. When he asks for a few chandeliers in a state-funded theatre in Riga, they materialize. In the US, he wakes up thinking about how to raise cash for his tiny production, one twenty-dollar bill at a time. (The group has raised many of those twenty-dollar bills, actually. Thanks to small donations, two large gifts, and foundation grants, the budget is now four hundred thousand dollars, and well on its way to being covered. The entire run of “Big Trip” is sold out.)&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In many of his works, Krymov adopts the standpoint of a young boy: “Seryozha,” his 2018 adaptation of “Anna Karenina,” was named for Anna&#39;s son, Sergei; his pointedly political rewriting of Chekhov&#39;s “Seagull,” from 2021, is titled “Kostik,” a diminutive of Konstantin, the play&#39;s callow hero. It&#39;s possible that Krymov identifies as a perpetual child because so many in Russia think of him as the child of his famous parents, the director Anatoly Efros (born in what is now Ukraine, in 1925) and the critic Natalya Krymova. Efros, in particular, was an era-defining figure in nineteen-sixties Moscow, during the Khrushchev thaw, and in the return to rigidity that followed. He was a subtle modernist interested in characters&#39; psychology (an emphasis on the individual psyche had been ideologically repressed under strict Communist dicta), and he helped to popularize the rehearsal use of “études,” or independent improvisational studies, a technique devised by Konstantin Stanislavski in the nineteen-thirties.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In an étude, actors are asked to devise actions or sketches of behavior supertextually: how Hamlet might behave at his uncle&#39;s wedding buffet, for instance. Elaborate game-structures also underpin Krymov&#39;s process, and there&#39;s a sense that the script may never be fixed: “The entire company is an endless improv,” Eliot says. “We&#39;re all following the lead conductor of the improvisation.” In the La Mama rehearsal studio, I watched his company spend five minutes blowing on a feather, trying to keep it in the air, to represent the communal effort and delicate silliness of theatre. There are other, sadder parallels between father and son. In the eighties, Efros led the Taganka Theatre, after its founder, the theatre titan and defector Yuri Lyubimov, had his Soviet citizenship stripped from him. The authorities erased Lyubimov&#39;s name from his productions, as they would do sixty years later, with Krymov&#39;s. Efros&#39;s ensuing conflict with the Taganka company —according to one of his biographers, James Thomas, there were antisemitic aggressions against him—may have led to his final heart attack and death.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Krymov&#39;s grandfather, his father&#39;s father, insisted he be given his mother&#39;s last name rather than his father&#39;s because he “was afraid of recurring waves of antisemitism,” Krymov says. Krymov did not immediately follow his father into directing, choosing instead to become a set designer; Krymov got a degree in scenography from the Moscow Art Theatre School in 1976, and designed more than a hundred productions—including many for his father—in his first career. Then, when Efros died in 1987, when he was sixty-one, Krymov abandoned the theatre for more than ten years to paint.&lt;/p>;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;feature-default&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;image&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:feature-default&quot;>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;Director Dmitry Krymov with eyes downcast&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650c6b4bd266277376e66286/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Shaw_DmitryKrymov_2.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650c6b4bd266277376e66286/master/w_120,c_limit/Shaw_DmitryKrymov_2.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650c6b4bd266277376e66286/master/w_240,c_limit/Shaw_DmitryKrymov_2.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650c6b4bd266277376e66286/master/w_320,c_limit/Shaw_DmitryKrymov_2.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650c6b4bd266277376e66286/master/w_640,c_limit/Shaw_DmitryKrymov_2.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650c6b4bd266277376e66286/master/w_960,c_limit/Shaw_DmitryKrymov_2.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650c6b4bd266277376e66286/master/w_1280,c_limit/Shaw_DmitryKrymov_2.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650c6b4bd266277376e66286/master/w_1600,c_limit/Shaw_DmitryKrymov_2.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;For performers, Krymov&#39;s style offers either free fall or freedom.&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/inline-embed>;&lt;p >;In 2002, Krymov, almost fifty, joined the Russian Academy of Theatre Arts as a professor of scenography, and directed his first play. (It was “Hamlet,” professionally cast and coolly received.) While at the school, he pivoted, forming his signature Krymov Lab; his design students acted as performers and puppeteers. For the nearly two decades since, his theatrical works have often included a graveside moment or a cortège: there&#39;s the ashes ceremony in “Everyone Is Here”; “Tararaboombia” features an infinite funeral parade for Chekhov, staged on a conveyor belt; “Opus No. 7” contains a surreal wake for the composer Shostakovich; and “Death of a Giraffe” creates a knock-kneed animal onstage out of pipes and cardboard, asks the audience to love it, and then buries it.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I asked Krymov why so many of his works revolve around funerals. “I remember when I started to paint—because I was a painter for many years—it was after my father&#39;s death,” he said. “I started to paint funerals in different compositions, different fantasies. It was probably because of the very strong shock that I experienced during that time, and, somehow, it jumped over into my subconscious.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In the winter of 2022, Krymov and his wife woke up in New York to smoke in their apartment, which had caught on fire from a suspected electrical fault. After trying to fight the flames, Krymov spent several days in a medical coma, as doctors treated him for smoke inhalation and burns. His wife and friends didn&#39;t know if he would survive. He shrugs when he talks about it. He dealt with it the way he always deals with trauma: this summer, he went to Klaipėda, Lithuania, and devised a production borrowing from Chekhov&#39;s “Three Sisters,” based on the act in which the sisters take in their neighbors after a fire.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Even in translation, his work is referential and allegorical, but the world he left behind in 2022 understood his references. “Tararaboombia” paraded characters from Chekhov&#39;s plays past the audience, but it also included sly jokes, such as a train car marked “oysters.” How many people here would know, as a Russian theatregoer once would have, that Chekhov&#39;s body was shipped to Moscow in a refrigerated railway carriage? An important part of Russian theatre is its stratigraphic effect. From their school days, audiences are steeped in the meanings and changing interpretations of theatrical texts, which allows them to read a production as a series of layered transparencies. At New York&#39;s City Center, I once saw a Russian production of “Eugene Onegin,” by Alexander Pushkin, directed by the Lithuanian Rimas Tuminas, that baffled me—one actor was playing a rabbit, and I finally had to ask a Russian seatmate about it. Legend has it that Pushkin saw a rabbit in the road as he was on his way to participate in the doomed Decembrist Revolt; he thought that it was a bad omen, so he turned back, saving his life. So a show&#39;s jokes and talmudic references might well stay opaque, if you don&#39;t know both the text and the &lt;em>;commentary&lt;/em>; around the text.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Because Krymov&#39;s work primarily operates through image—the critic Viktor Beryozkin grouped him with other highly visual directors like Robert Wilson and Tadeusz Kantor in “the theatre of the artist”—it has been received well in New York despite the audience&#39;s lack of shared literary context. “Opus No. 7” came to St. Ann&#39;s Warehouse, in 2013, where it was rapturously received. There was a time when you could see quite a bit of work by Russian directors in New York: Piotr Fomenko&#39;s “War and Peace” came to Lincoln Center in 2004; the Foundry helped Kama Ginkas restage “KI from Crime,” an elaboration on a moment from “Crime and Punishment” put on in a midtown freight entrance, in 2005; Lev Dodin brought several of his epic, elegiac productions to Lincoln Center and Brooklyn Academy of Music, most recently in 2018. But it didn&#39;t take a war or a pandemic for that contact to lessen—such cultural exchange was already dwindling in the wake of increasingly stringent visa requirements and fading institutional support for overseas work.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Pushkin &#39;Eugene Onegin&#39; in our own words,” the first part of the La Mama diptych, begins with a band of travelling Russian players, grumbling and frustrated with their performing conditions. When Krymov spoke to his cast in April, before they spent the summer apart, he tried to explain to them how to play these Russian immigrants. “I know what it means to be an émigré,” he told them. “I know but I won&#39;t share. It&#39;s scary. It&#39;s like you&#39;re standing like this and behind”—he mimed a cliff at his heels—“everything has dropped away.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The audience receives puppets that look like children, which sit on their laps. The troupe talks directly to these loaned-out, artificial boys and girls, explaining everything from what a ballerina does to who Pushkin was, which turns the event into a kind of children&#39;s educational theatre. “Eugene Onegin,” of course, isn&#39;t really for kids. It&#39;s a sorrowful nineteenth-century epic about the impossibility of recovering the past. The jaded aristocrat Onegin spurns the affection of a country girl, Tatyana, and then, years later, reëncounters her, now the wife of a general, in the soulless glitter of high society. She rejects him, though she loves him, mourning her lost innocence. The puppet-children allow the audience to watch the show as if through children&#39;s eyes, vicariously experiencing, at least dimly, the sensation that Tatyana says has been lost forever. In the nineteenth century, the Russian literary critic Vissarion Belinsky called the novel in verse an “encyclopedia of Russian life,” and the view hasn&#39;t changed much since—Tatyana&#39;s despair and nostalgia are still central to how Russians see themselves.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;There&#39;s a hint of defensiveness in staging this now, of course. Russian culture is being reëvaluated and challenged as part of global anger about the invasion. When I asked a friend and theatre critic, who has been a passionate advocate for Krymov&#39;s work in the past, to speak with me about his career, he refused even to discuss him, pointing me instead to Ukrainian theatremakers. (Even fictional Russians are too radioactive for some creators: the author Elizabeth Gilbert pulled her period novel “The Snow Forest,” citing Ukrainian sensitivities.) Is there a place for Russian theatre? “The desire to destroy everything Russian on a national basis is also nationalism,” Krymov wrote, when I asked him about whether he was sensitive to these protests. He sees the work that the Lab is doing as hybrid—Russian theatre mixed with all the other influences that have immigrated into the room. Yury Urnov, one of the artistic directors of the Wilma Theatre and also a Russian-born theatre director, has struggled with just this: “It&#39;s a very painful moment to associate yourself with Russia, but then dissociating is dishonest,” he says. In Krymov&#39;s work, one encounters a “matryoshka of contexts,” Urnov says, which can be understood “in the context of this company, in the context of the war, in the context of his immigration, or—whatever it is, I don&#39;t know how to formally name it—immigration. Exile.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Elizabeth Stahlmann, an actor who followed Krymov from the Yale Drama School, plays Tatyana, and she says that when Krymov first showed “Onegin” to the new Lab, he acted out the entire play, reading the script and demonstrating the blocking, playing all the parts. Toward the end, Tatyana delivers a monologue. “It&#39;s one of the only times in the play that we actually use Pushkin&#39;s words,” Stahlmann says. “So he sat down, and he gives this monologue in Russian, with Tatyana [Khaikin] translating—and he &lt;em>;transforms&lt;/em>;. He&#39;s an incredible actor, and he starts crying. It&#39;s about leaving. For him, it was about not being able to go back, not being able to go back to Russia.” Then Stahlmann quoted Krymov reciting Tatyana&#39;s speech: “That&#39;s where my parents are buried. I will never see their graves again.” She, like many actors before her, was discovering that she would be playing a version of her director onstage.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;“And then he goes—&#39;OK, you do it now.&#39; ” ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 30 Sep 2023 00:06:01 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Telltale Signs That Spooky Season Is Here]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.newyorker.com/humor/daily-shouts/telltale-signs-that-spooky-season-is-here]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-29T10:00:00.000Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6515ba377ef26f0f1de6985a/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/shouts-elson-spooky%20season.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;article >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attribute-verso-pattern=&quot;article-body&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;ArticlePageChunks&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;A spider will descend from the ceiling on a single thread.

Yum!” At first, you might want to be, like, “Actually, I think the line ends back there,” but instead you&#39;ll allow the bat to stay. That is the spooky-season way.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Oak trees will cast long, wiggly shadows because they&#39;re doing a shoulder shimmy.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;You&#39;ll meet a band of witches in a cemetery who are playing with bunnies.

So will the bat. Then the werewolves, the witches, the spider, and the vampires will arrive for soup, too. The vampires will say, “We&#39;d like some sooOOooOOooup, please.” Because they said “sooOOooOOooup,” they&#39;ll get free refills of this nutty, slightly sweet concoction.

He hadn&#39;t yet turned thirty. “I was too comfortable,” he told me. “I need to be in the fire.” So he quit, and, in April, 2019, started a pop-up in the East Village&#39;s Black Emperor bar, selling burgers, chopped-cheese rice cakes, fried chicken. “I was a one-man show, selling five burgers a night,” Lee said. “I had to sell my prize possession, my Panerai watch, just to have rent money.” Then a Gothamist article came out: “Random East Village Bar Now Serving One of NYC&#39;s Greatest Burgers.” Lee&#39;s pop-up blew up: “I started selling hundreds of burgers overnight.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;GenericCallout&quot;>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;Ricotta toast and honeybutter tater tots are welcome accompaniments to the kimchilaced Legendary Cheeseburger.&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/651347060b11c2dec5908a72/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/231009_r43154.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/651347060b11c2dec5908a72/master/w_120,c_limit/231009_r43154.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/651347060b11c2dec5908a72/master/w_240,c_limit/231009_r43154.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/651347060b11c2dec5908a72/master/w_320,c_limit/231009_r43154.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/651347060b11c2dec5908a72/master/w_640,c_limit/231009_r43154.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/651347060b11c2dec5908a72/master/w_960,c_limit/231009_r43154.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/651347060b11c2dec5908a72/master/w_1280,c_limit/231009_r43154.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/651347060b11c2dec5908a72/master/w_1600,c_limit/231009_r43154.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;Ricotta toast and honey-butter tater tots are welcome accompaniments to the kimchi-laced Legendary Cheeseburger.&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Photographs by Justin J.

So Lee set up shop on his own, and launched Nowon, in the East Village (507 E. 6th St.), just months after the fateful article. This summer, he opened a second location, in Bushwick. Where the East Village room is all warm wood and cozy, if high-decibel, bar vibes, the Bushwick spot reads at once sleek and gritty, in black and red hues, Destiny&#39;s Child videos projected on the wall, Tyler, the Creator blasting on the speakers.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;GenericCallout&quot;>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;The eclectic drink menu includes Korean rice beer soju and zeroproof cocktails.&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6513470651fd0515dd04235a/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/231009_r43155.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6513470651fd0515dd04235a/master/w_120,c_limit/231009_r43155.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6513470651fd0515dd04235a/master/w_240,c_limit/231009_r43155.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6513470651fd0515dd04235a/master/w_320,c_limit/231009_r43155.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6513470651fd0515dd04235a/master/w_640,c_limit/231009_r43155.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6513470651fd0515dd04235a/master/w_960,c_limit/231009_r43155.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6513470651fd0515dd04235a/master/w_1280,c_limit/231009_r43155.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6513470651fd0515dd04235a/master/w_1600,c_limit/231009_r43155.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;The eclectic drink menu includes Korean rice beer, soju, and zero-proof cocktails.&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Photographs by Justin J.

Mandatory orders include a burger (a version with actual truffle rivals the Legendary); a killer gochujang-glazed fried-chicken sandwich; crisp honey-butter tater tots; and those chopped-cheese rice cakes, a variation of &lt;em>;tteokbokki&lt;/em>;, swimming in a velvety beef-and-American-cheese-fortified gravy.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Lee&#39;s wonderful &lt;em>;japchae&lt;/em>;, helpfully named Vegan Shroom Noods, bathes translucent sweet-potato glass noodles in a brown-sugar-soy sauce. Wood-fired pizzas, new for the Bushwick location, skew sweet, with a deliciously complex, chewy crust. Lee told me that he does think about an empire, but not the Roman kind: “I want to build a Korean American restaurant-bar empire, throughout the nation.” (&lt;em>;Dishes $11-$27.&lt;/em>;) ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 29 Sep 2023 19:06:02 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Richard Brody’s New York Film Festival Highlights]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.newyorker.com/culture/goings-on/richard-brodys-new-york-film-festival-highlights]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-29T10:00:00.000Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/651327e78c92a28253ccd2ba/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/231009_r43120.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;article >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attribute-verso-pattern=&quot;article-body&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;ArticlePageChunks&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/contributors/richard-brody&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Richard Brody&lt;/strong>;&lt;/a>;&lt;br/>;Staff writer&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;external-link-embed--inline&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;a aria-label=&quot;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;You&#39;re reading the Goings On newsletter, a guide to what we&#39;re watching, listening to, and doing this week. &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Sign up to receive it in your in-box.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://newyorker.com/newsletter/goings-on&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://newyorker.com/newsletter/goings-on&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;&lt;span >;&lt;em>;You&#39;re reading the Goings On newsletter, a guide to what we&#39;re watching, listening to, and doing this week. &lt;strong>;Sign up to receive it in your in-box.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/em>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/a>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;It was a scandal&lt;/strong>; when, in 1969, the New York Film Festival showed Paul Mazursky&#39;s extramarital romp “Bob &amp;amp; Carol &amp;amp; Ted &amp;amp; Alice” in its Lincoln Center sanctuary, but these days few doubt that art can issue from Hollywood. Several industry notables will grace this year&#39;s edition of the festival, which kicks off tonight and runs through Oct. 15, including Todd Haynes, whose drama &lt;strong>;“May December&lt;/strong>;”—featuring Natalie Portman as an actor preparing to portray a subject of a long-ago scandal (Julianne Moore)—is the opening-night offering. But NYFF is largely a celebration of movies that likely won&#39;t be on hundreds of multiplex screens and yet are no less worthy of attention, such as the idiosyncratic and intimate comedy &lt;strong>;“The Feeling That the Time for Doing Something Has Passed&lt;/strong>;”—written and directed by Joanna Arnow, who also stars as a thirtysomething Brooklyn woman whose quest for a romantic relationship conflicts with her desire to be sexually dominated—and &lt;strong>;“In Water,”&lt;/strong>; one of a pair of films by the veteran South Korean director Hong Sangsoo, about a young independent filmmaker&#39;s reckless effort to shoot an improvised drama. Many of Hong&#39;s images are intentionally out of focus, to surprising emotional effect, emphasizing the force of the film&#39;s confessional and confrontational dialogue.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;GenericCallout&quot;>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;Film still of Evil Does Not Exist&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65131e99beba73981475b622/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/NYFF61_EvilDoesNotExist_Image1.png&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65131e99beba73981475b622/master/w_120,c_limit/NYFF61_EvilDoesNotExist_Image1.png 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65131e99beba73981475b622/master/w_240,c_limit/NYFF61_EvilDoesNotExist_Image1.png 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65131e99beba73981475b622/master/w_320,c_limit/NYFF61_EvilDoesNotExist_Image1.png 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65131e99beba73981475b622/master/w_640,c_limit/NYFF61_EvilDoesNotExist_Image1.png 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65131e99beba73981475b622/master/w_960,c_limit/NYFF61_EvilDoesNotExist_Image1.png 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65131e99beba73981475b622/master/w_1280,c_limit/NYFF61_EvilDoesNotExist_Image1.png 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65131e99beba73981475b622/master/w_1600,c_limit/NYFF61_EvilDoesNotExist_Image1.png 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;Photograph courtesy Sideshow / Janus Films&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;But pride of place regarding long dialogue scenes of wondrous intensity goes to the Japanese drama &lt;strong>;“Evil Does Not Exist,”&lt;/strong>; directed by Ryûsuke Hamaguchi (whose 2021 film “Drive My Car” was nominated for four Oscars and won one, for Best International Feature Film). It&#39;s the story of a rural village of artisans and farmers whose way of life is threatened by a businessman&#39;s plan to open a glamping lodge there. Discussions among the villagers and the developers—as at a contentious public hearing—display a depth of practical knowledge and introduce a twisty succession of subjects that seem borrowed from the institution-probing documentaries of Frederick Wiseman. Hamaguchi flaunts his quasi-documentarian sensibility in wordless scenes, too, including an extraordinary long take of a woodcutter at work which is among the cinematic thrills of the year.&lt;/p>;&lt;hr />;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;align-center&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:align-center&quot;>;&lt;h2 >;Spotlight&lt;/h2>;&lt;/inline-embed>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;GenericCallout&quot;>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;Richard Brodys New York Film Festival Highlights&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/651327e78c92a28253ccd2ba/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/231009_r43120.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/651327e78c92a28253ccd2ba/master/w_120,c_limit/231009_r43120.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/651327e78c92a28253ccd2ba/master/w_240,c_limit/231009_r43120.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/651327e78c92a28253ccd2ba/master/w_320,c_limit/231009_r43120.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/651327e78c92a28253ccd2ba/master/w_640,c_limit/231009_r43120.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/651327e78c92a28253ccd2ba/master/w_960,c_limit/231009_r43120.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/651327e78c92a28253ccd2ba/master/w_1280,c_limit/231009_r43120.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/651327e78c92a28253ccd2ba/master/w_1600,c_limit/231009_r43120.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;Illustration by Rachelle Baker&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;heading&quot; aria-level=&quot;6&quot; >;Hip-Hop&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Few rappers can claim to be as skilled as &lt;strong>;Little Simz,&lt;/strong>; a British Nigerian artist who has steadily grown from phenom to bellwether. Her early albums were about transitioning into adulthood, finding her way through the uncertainty of her early twenties to realize her purpose. Even then, it was clear that her path was fated—her lyricism is fluid yet rugged, casual even at its most technical, foreshadowing a future as one of rap&#39;s most distinguished soul-searchers. In the years since she established herself as a mainstay, she has performed with brio and bravado: “Name one time where I didn&#39;t deliver,” she raps on “Gorilla,” already knowing the answer. Not only has Simz always come through; she just keeps getting better.—&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/contributors/sheldon-pearce&quot;>;&lt;em>;Sheldon Pearce&lt;/em>;&lt;/a>; &lt;em>;(Brooklyn Steel; Oct. 12.)&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>;&lt;hr />;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;GenericCallout&quot;>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;An illustration of the New York City skyline.&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64ad7fea3f0ea61101b7b5aa/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/header-2023.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64ad7fea3f0ea61101b7b5aa/master/w_120,c_limit/header-2023.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64ad7fea3f0ea61101b7b5aa/master/w_240,c_limit/header-2023.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64ad7fea3f0ea61101b7b5aa/master/w_320,c_limit/header-2023.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64ad7fea3f0ea61101b7b5aa/master/w_640,c_limit/header-2023.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64ad7fea3f0ea61101b7b5aa/master/w_960,c_limit/header-2023.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64ad7fea3f0ea61101b7b5aa/master/w_1280,c_limit/header-2023.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64ad7fea3f0ea61101b7b5aa/master/w_1600,c_limit/header-2023.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/div>;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;align-center&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:align-center&quot;>;&lt;h2 >;About Town&lt;/h2>;&lt;/inline-embed>;&lt;div role=&quot;heading&quot; aria-level=&quot;6&quot; >;Podcast&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Free association and podcasting aren&#39;t so different—both involve extracting meaning from thoughtful rambling—so it&#39;s not surprising that someone has made a podcast about psychoanalysis. &lt;strong>;“Ordinary Unhappiness”&lt;/strong>; (produced in collaboration with &lt;em>;Parapraxis Magazine&lt;/em>;) takes an approach to the subject that&#39;s more scholarly than therapeutic, providing an experience akin to listening in on a lively seminar. The hosts are Abby Kluchin and Patrick Blanchfield, a pair of academics who happen to be married. (That this fact comes out only incidentally in the course of the first episode feels appropriate.) Their interviews cover an expansive range of psychoanalytic themes in contemporary culture; a set of episodes called “The Standard Edition” proceeds methodically through Freud&#39;s work. The conversations are meandering but scattered with memorable insights and reading recommendations. Early on, Blanchfield tells listeners that the show will be “interminable, but in the best possible way”—so far, it fulfills that promise.—&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/contributors/molly-fischer&quot;>;&lt;em>;Molly Fischer&lt;/em>;&lt;/a>;&lt;/p>;&lt;hr />;&lt;div role=&quot;heading&quot; aria-level=&quot;6&quot; >;Classical&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;Riccardo Muti,&lt;/strong>; the venerable, debonair, exacting Italian conductor, opens Carnegie Hall&#39;s season with two concerts leading the &lt;strong>;Chicago Symphony Orchestra.&lt;/strong>; The first night is gala fare—Tchaikovsky&#39;s Violin Concerto, with the superlative Leonidas Kavakos, and Mussorgsky&#39;s “Pictures at an Exhibition”—and gives way to a thematic program for the second evening.

His works often address heavy topics, such as political instability in his homeland, with impressionistic subtlety. A new piece, “Once the dust settles, flowers bloom,” presented at the Joyce as part of the Crossing the Line Festival, is about refugees fleeing from violent jihadists. It&#39;s a peregrination of grounded, supple, springy motion, and, although it doesn&#39;t ignore suffering, the dancers carry flowers between their teeth.

In both versions, the fond Brother Abraham (Susannah Perkins) rescues his prostituted charge, but Horwitz seems ambivalent about which bodily surrender—to man or to God—is worse. The comedy is like a doodle on an illustrated manuscript, with jolly tonsured friars crushing on one another and on the Almighty. (Perkins, as chief flirter, is a miracle.) But Josiah Davis&#39;s spoof-medieval, no-cis-males-allowed production, for the Playwrights Realm, eventually frolics so much that the capering runs out of air. The central question of Mary&#39;s own desires remains unbroached; Horwitz hasn&#39;t yet found a secular equivalent for Hrotsvitha&#39;s sense of religious ecstasy.—&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/contributors/helen-shaw&quot;>;&lt;em>;Helen Shaw&lt;/em>;&lt;/a>; &lt;em>;(Robert W.

The longest of them, at thirty-nine minutes, is &lt;strong>;“The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar,”&lt;/strong>; a giddy cinematic experiment in which the filmmaker takes the concept of storytelling daringly literally. The film chronicles a rich fop who studies a magic manual and teaches himself how to achieve X-ray vision and clairvoyance. The story is told, into the camera, by Dahl (played by Ralph Fiennes), the author of the manual (Dev Patel), the magician whose skills it details (Ben Kingsley), and the wealthy protagonist himself (Benedict Cumberbatch), even as they act out their adventures on elaborately crafted, stagelike sets. For all the film&#39;s whimsical style and substance, it offers a potent vision of the redemptive power of apparent frivolity.—&lt;em>;Richard Brody (In limited release and streaming.)&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>;&lt;hr />;&lt;div role=&quot;heading&quot; aria-level=&quot;6&quot; >;Art&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;If you liked the new Tom Wolfe documentary, Richard Dewey&#39;s “Radical Wolfe,” visit Matthew Marks for a textbook example of radical chic. &lt;strong>;Wade Guyton&#39;s&lt;/strong>; latest batch of photo-based, ink-jet-printed paintings encompasses many subjects: abstract smears, a Manet still-life, a police car.

This time around, ads for “Funny Girl” or Banana Republic sit beside headlines about Trump or Ukraine.

The only other onstage presence is Kate Owens, who mutely and gamely plays opposite Etheridge when the singer is acting something out. Etheridge&#39;s songs are as affecting as ever, and she performs them in counterpoint to the drama-dense time line of her life. Love, sex, music, and, especially, her encounters with psychoactive drugs—it all comes up. (At one point, rhapsodizing about ayahuasca, she puts on a tasselled hippie jacket.) The stories are fine; the songs are worth the ticket price.—&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/contributors/vinson-cunningham&quot;>;&lt;em>;Vinson Cunningham&lt;/em>;&lt;/a>; &lt;em>;(Circle in the Square; through Nov. 19.)&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>;&lt;hr />;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;PS Good stuff on the Internet:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;ul >;&lt;li>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97SPDxM3Ezw&amp;amp;t=731s&quot;>;&#39;NSync on “Hot Ones”&lt;/a>;&lt;/li>;&lt;li>;&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://longreads.com/2023/09/27/what-500-means-to-zinida-moore/&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://longreads.com/2023/09/27/what-500-means-to-zinida-moore/&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://longreads.com/2023/09/27/what-500-means-to-zinida-moore/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;“What $500 Means to Zinida Moore”&lt;/a>;&lt;/li>;&lt;li>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/@SoftDrinkShack&quot;>;The YouTube channel “Steve&#39;s Soft Drink Shack”&lt;/a>;&lt;/li>;&lt;/ul>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 29 Sep 2023 19:06:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[The Violent End of Nagorno-Karabakh’s Fight for Independence]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/the-violent-end-of-nagorno-karabakhs-fight-for-independence]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-29T10:00:00.000Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65145befd48137d9fb6f7261/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Gessen-Karabakh-09-27-23.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;article >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attribute-verso-pattern=&quot;article-body&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;ArticlePageChunks&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;A thirty-five-year war reignited last week. Hundreds of people died. Tens of thousands may have been displaced. The world, focussed on the United Nations General Assembly and the war in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tag/ukraine&quot;>;Ukraine&lt;/a>;, barely noticed. On September 19th, Azerbaijan started shelling towns and military bases in Nagorno-Karabakh, an Armenian enclave that had long fought for independence. In less than a day, the self-proclaimed republic was effectively disarmed and forced to capitulate. Russian forces, ostensibly there to prevent just this kind of outcome, offered little or no resistance. The most generous reading of the situation is that they were caught unawares. The least generous is that Russia had given its approval to the attack, perhaps in exchange for maintaining a military presence in the region.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The Karabakh conflict dates back to 1988. It prefigured a dozen others that would erupt in what was then the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia. Nagorno-Karabakh was, legally, an autonomous region within Azerbaijan, a constituent republic of the USSR As &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/postscript/mikhail-gorbachev-the-fundamentally-soviet-man&quot;>;Mikhail Gorbachev&lt;/a>;&#39;s government loosened political restrictions, Karabakh Armenians demanded the right, which they argued was guaranteed to them by the Soviet constitution, to secede from Azerbaijan and join Armenia, also a Soviet constituent republic. Moscow rejected the demand. Meanwhile, shoot-outs between ethnic Armenians and ethnic Azeris in Nagorno-Karabakh sparked violence elsewhere. In February, 1988, anti-Armenian pogroms in the Azerbaijani town of Sumgait left dozens dead. Two years later, a week of anti-Armenian violence in Baku, Azerbaijan&#39;s historically multiethnic capital, killed dozens more. Thousands of ethnic Armenians fled Azerbaijan, where their families had lived for generations. Some left on a plane chartered by the chess champion Garry Kasparov, probably the best-known Azerbaijani Armenian, who was also leaving his motherland forever.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In 1991, the Soviet Union broke apart and each of its fifteen constituent republics became a sovereign state. For Karabakh Armenians, this meant that any legal basis for their secessionist aspirations had vanished. Nagorno-Karabakh became one of several ethnic enclaves in the post-Soviet space that was fighting for independence from the newly independent country of which they were a part—South Ossetia and Abkhazia tried to break free from Georgia, the Transnistria Region fought to separate from Moldova, Chechnya wanted out of Russia. In the early nineteen-nineties, each of these conflicts became a hot war. In every case outside its own borders, Russia supported the separatist movements—and, in most cases, used the conflicts to station its own troops in the region. Two decades later, Russia used the same playbook to foment &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/dispatch/the-fight-to-survive-russias-onslaught-in-eastern-ukraine&quot;>;armed conflict in eastern Ukraine&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Fighting in Nagorno-Karabakh lasted until 1994. Both sides engaged in ethnic cleansing: the deliberate displacement and killing of people based on their ethnicity. Moscow secretly supported Azerbaijan in the conflict. The war ended with a de-facto victory for the Armenians, who were able to establish self-rule on a large part of the territory they claimed, even though not a single country—not even Armenia—officially recognized the independence of Nagorno-Karabakh. Whether it was because the Armenians won, or because the conflict ended when Russia had been destabilized by its own bloody constitutional crisis, Nagorno-Karabakh was the only conflict region in the former empire where Russia did not station its troops.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;For the next three decades, the political paths of Armenia and Azerbaijan, two neighbors inextricably linked by blood and war, diverged. Azerbaijan transitioned from Soviet totalitarianism to post-Soviet dictatorship, with a ruling dynasty, censorship, and widespread political repression. One of the world&#39;s original oil powers, Azerbaijan also grew comparatively wealthy. It nurtured diplomatic, economic, and military ties with neighboring Turkey and with Israel, which views Azerbaijan as an ally in any confrontation with Azerbaijan&#39;s next-door neighbor Iran. Armenia, at least formally, undertook a transition to democracy. That transition hit a dead end in October, 1999, when a group of gunmen burst into the parliament and assassinated nine people, including all the leaders of one of the two ruling parties. The leader of the surviving party, Robert Kocharyan, led the country for another decade, and his clan remained in power until 2018, when a peaceful revolution seemed to start a new era. The new leader of Armenia, Nikol Pashinyan, is a former journalist.&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;In both countries, Nagorno-Karabakh remained the focus of political life. For Azerbaijan, the pain and humiliation of the 1994 defeat formed the centerpiece of the national narrative. “Azerbaijan got its independence in parallel with the war, so Nagorno-Karabakh has played a major role in shaping Azerbaijani national identity,” Shujaat Ahmadzada, an independent Azerbaijani political scientist, told me. “There was the memory, the images of internally displaced people, adding to the narrative of having suffered injustices. And conflict is important to keeping and solidifying power.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;In Armenia, what became known as the Karabakh Clan has held power for most of the post-Soviet period. Kocharyan is a former leader of the self-proclaimed Nagorno-Karabakh Republic. Armen Martirosyan, an Armenian publisher and longtime political activist, told me that, in 2018, he had hoped that Nikol Pashinyan would finally represent a “party of peace.” But even Pashinyan, who was born in 1975, was compelled to claim that he had got his political start in Nagorno-Karabakh. “Seven out of eight of our political parties are parties of war,” Martirosyan said.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Both sides continued to arm themselves. The self-proclaimed Nagorno-Karabakh Republic formed its own armed forces, aided and supplied by Armenia. Azerbaijan imported arms from Israel. “It shouldn&#39;t be a surprise to anyone that an oil-rich country with an authoritarian regime can put together a well-trained, cohesive army,” Alexander Cherkasov, a Russian researcher in exile who has been documenting ethnic conflicts in the region for thirty-five years, said. In 2020, Azerbaijan attacked Nagorno-Karabakh. Fighting lasted forty-four days. Thousands of people died. Azerbaijan reëstablished control over much of the self-proclaimed republic and adjacent territories. In the end, Moscow brokered a ceasefire that rested on the presence of Russian peacekeepers in Nagorno-Karabakh. The status of the self-proclaimed republic remained undecided but, for the time being, it seemed that a shrunken Nagorno-Karabakh would continue to be self-governed.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Less than fifteen months later, Russia &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/putin-launches-his-invasion-of-ukraine&quot;>;launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine&lt;/a>;. Hundreds of thousands of Russians fleeing political persecution, the draft, and Western economic sanctions flooded into Armenia. Security guarantees offered to Armenia by Russia began to seem less reliable, and the price of these guarantees seemed to rise. According to Arman Grigoryan, an Armenian-born political scientist at Lehigh University, Pashinyan launched a “grandiose project of pulling Armenia out of Russia&#39;s orbit.” Apparently counting on Russia&#39;s waning influence in the world and weakening interest in the region, Pashinyan dragged his feet on signing a peace treaty with Azerbaijan, at least one that involved having Russia at the table. He also did not deliver on one of the obligations Armenia had accepted as part of the 2020 ceasefire agreement: to provide Azerbaijan with an overland corridor to Nakhchivan, the country&#39;s exclave on the other side of the Armenian border, three hundred miles from Baku. Such a corridor would, under the terms of the ceasefire agreement, be controlled by the Russian security services. Pashinyan&#39;s reluctance was understandable, but his hope that Western support would allow him to stall indefinitely proved unfounded. Pashinyan also took a number of diplomatic—or, rather, undiplomatic—steps that galled Russia. Most recently, he asked the Armenian parliament to ratify the Rome Statute, the founding document of the International Criminal Court, which has indicted Vladimir Putin for war crimes allegedly committed against Ukraine. (Russia, like the United States, has not ratified the Rome Statute.)&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Late last year, Azerbaijan started ratcheting up pressure on Nagorno-Karabakh. In December, a blockade was imposed, apparently aimed at cutting off the only supply route to the enclave. People found some ways to circumvent it, but over time the situation grew dire. Thomas de Waal, a London-based senior fellow with the Carnegie Europe Endowment for International Peace, who has been documenting the Karabakh conflict for nearly thirty years, told me that “thousands of people were without gas and there was bread rationing, down to two hundred grams a day. This and having to walk everywhere for miles, for anything. And then, out of nowhere, getting shelled.”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;pxfed&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;k8crgc&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;The shelling on September 19th was shocking, but it was by no means unexpected. Ahmadzada, the Azerbaijani researcher, told me that Azerbaijan had been pursuing what he calls a “three-&#39;D&#39; strategy”: deinternationalization, deinstitutionalization, and deterritorialization. The conflict was effectively deinternationalized when all sides agreed to a peace agreement brokered by Russia, leaving out the more conventional (and arguably more trustworthy) European or UN actors. Deinstitutionalization has been achieved in the latest round of fighting, with self-rule now clearly off the table. The next stage would likely be the forced exodus of Armenians from the region. This is also known as “ethnic cleansing,” a phrase that has resurfaced in reference to the Karabakh conflict.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;On September 22nd, de Waal tweeted that, watching the events in Nagorno-Karabakh, he was experiencing “a disturbing déjà vu of the beginning of the Bosnia war.” Perhaps more accurately, the events are reminiscent of the 1991-94 Karabakh war, whose atrocities were overshadowed by atrocities committed in the former Yugoslavia. “And of course today we are seeing pictures of convoys on mountain roads, people having grabbed their possessions and abandoned their homes,” de Waal told me on the phone. “I am having flashbacks to the early nineteen-nineties.” At first, Armenian and Karabakh authorities talked of evacuating only the people whose homes had been destroyed in the fighting. But Armenian NGOs put out the call for people experienced in building refugee camps at a large scale. The population of Nagorno-Karabakh is believed to be around a hundred and twenty thousand people, though, according to de Waal, some eighty thousand to a hundred thousand people were in the region when it was attacked. About half of them are now believed to have left their homeland.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;On September 27th, Azerbaijan arrested Ruben Vardanyan, an Armenian-born entrepreneur and philanthropist who had made billions in Russia before moving to Nagorno-Karabakh to lead its government in 2022. (Vardanyan resigned his position in February, in an effort to facilitate negotiations with the Azerbaijani side.) Vardanyan, who had stayed in the region during the shelling, was apparently also trying to leave when he was detained. On September 28th, the government of the self-proclaimed republic announced its intention to disband by the end of the year.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The Nagorno-Karabakh independence project has ended. But, Grigoryan told me, the Azerbaijani-Armenian conflict is not over. “Azerbaijan has the military capability to take over southern Armenia, possibly on the pretext of needing a corridor to Nakhchivan.” Russia may have an interest in maintaining a military presence in the region, and further conflict could serve as the pretext. For now, the Russian media machine is working to destabilize the political situation in Armenia. Russia&#39;s chief propagandists, at least two of whom happen to be ethnic Armenians, have blamed the defeat in Nagorno-Karabakh on Pashinyan. They have unleashed diatribes against him, employing obscene language. Under a special legal arrangement between the two countries, Russian television is widely broadcast in Armenia. “I have understood that Armenia should not insert itself in the games big countries play,” Martirosyan, the publisher, said. “Because the big ones will have a spat and kill a small country. Or at least hurt it very badly.” ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;g6q71&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 29 Sep 2023 19:06:02 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
