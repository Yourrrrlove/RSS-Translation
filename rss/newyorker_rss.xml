C. Elimane 展开，他的小说被遗忘已久——据说每本都被毁掉了——在当代巴黎重新出现。埃利马内的作品成为当代非洲作家群体的痴迷，让他们“有机会在虔诚而血腥的文学较量中互相撕扯”。叙述者像经文一样讲述它：“他的书既是大教堂，又是竞技场；我们进入它，就像进入神的坟墓一样，最终跪在自己的鲜血中，作为对杰作的奠酒。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“人类最秘密的记忆”是叙事发明的特技壮举，旋转介于黑色、童话、讽刺和档案小说之间，对文学传奇的本质进行自我反思。它的《龚古尔》被视为法国文学界的一次政变，法国文学界此前从未给予来自撒哈拉以南非洲的作家最高的认可。 （萨尔笔下的人物对这种可疑的民族地理差异进行了有趣的嘲笑。）本月，拉拉·韦格诺（Lara Vergnaud）为其他出版社翻译的推进性翻译终于向英语读者开放，该出版社还计划重新发行《暴力的束缚》。&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;对乌洛洛姆的敬意中有一种诗意的正义元素，他赢得了抛弃他的当权者的如此认可。萨尔严厉审视文化“法兰西非洲”（Françafrique）——指法国对其前殖民地的地缘政治影响力——将非洲小说降级为隐蔽的回忆录、民族志研究或民俗娱乐。他挑战了这些类别，讲述了一个关于文学自我创造的造物故事，将一位停止写作的作家的悲惨命运转变成一个关于所有有待书写的激动人心的故事。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;萨尔的叙述者，Diégane Latyr Faye是一位旅居巴黎的塞内加尔青年作家。他有着迷人的神经质，对文学充满热情，并且偏离了“学术界的崇高道路”而成为一名小说家，完全随波逐流。他的女朋友离开了他，去从事外国报道工作，他在达喀尔的父母想知道为什么他从不打电话。他出版了一本小说，自命不凡地标题为“虚空解剖”，但只卖出了几十本，而且他已经在下一本的第一句话上浪费了一个月的时间。似乎所有将他束缚在地球上的都是他在巴黎文坛“非洲贫民窟”中的朋友，他们除了同一个大陆和大量的挫败感外，几乎没有什么共同之处。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;萨尔是一位熟练的漫画家，描绘了这一点带着刚毕业的校友的调皮感情的小集团。其中有一位法裔几内亚影响者，他的首张热门歌曲《爱情是一颗可可豆》在 Instagram 上广受好评，还有一位刚果诗人，他的评论残酷无情，他的六音步诗深奥难懂。他们聚集在一起抱怨他们的文学前辈（他们中的许多人深陷自我异国情调的“奴隶地位”）、非洲读者（“渴望被代表，而他们实际上无法代表”）、白人读者（他们想象他们“编织”）。月光下的故事”），尤其是法国文学界，这是他们公开嘲笑和私人梦想的对象。&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;对于 Diégane 来说，影响力的焦虑是压垮他的，他在一个“仍然被桑戈尔的笨重鬼魂困扰”的国家长大。在小说中最有趣的章节之一中，他几乎与其他成员一起参加三人行，但过度考虑了这种情况的文学共鸣。 “首先，我们屈服于刚刚成熟的夜晚的电流颤抖，绿色如年轻的芒果，”他回忆道，戏仿了黑人的感性意象。他们的女主人提议搬到卧室，但迪耶加内太胆怯了，最终在巨大十字架下的沙发上焦躁不安，试图忽略做爱的刺耳声音，同时幻想着与耶稣的对话。韦尔尼奥的敏锐耳朵为英国化的迪耶甘赋予了生动的生命，其夸张的句子掩盖了他文学性欲的怯场。&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;什么引发了中心叙述是另一次失败的幽会，这次是与一位年长的女人：Marème Siga D.，塞内加尔外籍作家的元老，她令人反感的坦率给了她“邪恶的皮提亚”的名声。当他们的前戏失败时，西加·D. 斥责迪耶甘混淆了生活和文学，并送他回家，送了一本 T.C. Elimane 的《不人道的迷宫》。在接下来的两个月里，他追踪作者的踪迹，在艾利曼的书中寻找自己的困惑的答案。 “人们认为，好像这是一个已成定局的事情，过去又回到了现在，困扰着现在，”他反思道。 “但情况也可能相反，即使不是更严重，也同样如此，而且我们无情地困扰着那些先行者。我们是历史上真正的幽灵，我们的幽灵中的幽灵。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;萨尔向叙述者讲述了他自己传记的许多方面。他出生于 1990 年，是一名医生七个儿子中的长子，他在法属西非首都圣路易斯的军校开始写诗，并以优异的成绩毕业，被评为塞内加尔的尖子生。后来，他就读于巴黎高等社会科学学院，在那里他开始了一篇关于三位西非作家及其在六十年代末的作品的论文：艾哈迈杜·库鲁马、马利克·法尔和扬博·乌洛洛姆。乌洛格姆的迅速崛起和随后的排斥让他特别着迷。萨尔最近说道：“我总是问自己，如果他不是马里人，他是否也会遭遇同样的命运。”他认为，真正让西方读者对乌洛洛姆感到困扰的是，他“不仅抄袭了来自马里的文本，而且更具爆炸性的是，模仿了这些文本”。殖民传统。”&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;最终，萨尔决定停止研究小说并开始出版小说，并与传奇品牌 Présence Africaine 合作发行了他的处女作。 《兄弟情谊》（2015）的故事发生在一座虚构的非洲城市，该城市被伊斯兰民兵占领，当地居民建立了地下日记来记录占领情况。这本书的主题很热门——当时的马里卷入了一场叛乱——但它的执行方式让人想起十九世纪的社会小说，在对腐败的圣战分子和他们的怀疑对象。 《Silence du Chœur》（2017 年）延续了这种模式，这是一部喧闹的复调小说，讲述了一群非洲移民以及他们在西西里小镇与欧洲本土主义者的对抗。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;这两本书赢得了多项奖项，早期的成功似乎让萨尔敢于冒重大风险。他的第三本书《De Purs Hommes》（2018 年）是一部引人入胜的心理剧，剖析了塞内加尔对同性恋的禁忌。叙述者是达喀尔的一名教授，在他所见到的一位女士向他展示了一段暴民挖掘并亵渎疑似同性恋尸体的视频后，他的生活发生了翻天覆地的变化。他假装漠不关心，逐渐痴迷于&lt;em>;góor-jigéen&lt;/em>;（一种沃洛夫语脏话，意思是“男女”），并被同性恋虽然被谴责为西方颓废，但却是潜在的讽刺所震惊。在一些传统做法中。一旦叙述者的学生抵制他关于魏尔伦的演讲，耻辱也开始笼罩着他。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;起初，这部小说在塞内加尔几乎被忽视。但在萨尔“&lt;em>;goncourisé&lt;/em>;”之后，争议爆发了。当地作家和宗教领袖指责他出卖自己的文化。更有阴谋论的人猜测，他之所以获得龚古尔勋章，是因为他支持 LGBTQ 立场，或者他自己就是一名伪装的同性恋者。这场争吵并没有阻止塞内加尔总统授予这位年轻作家国家狮子勋章。但它确实揭示了为什么萨尔可能在乌洛洛姆的勇敢无畏中找到了这样的模式。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;虚构文学史可以让作家驱除其霸道的存在，逃避其陈词滥调和死胡同。豪尔赫·路易斯·博尔赫斯通过查阅虚构的书籍来克服困扰他的祖先的巨大压力。伊什梅尔·里德（Ishmael Reed）在他的小说《Mumbo Jumbo》中，试图通过模仿哈莱姆文艺复兴时期的典型人物，将非裔美国作家从他们的束缚中解放出来。同样，萨尔借鉴了乌洛洛姆的生活，为他的传统塑造了一个新的起源神话。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Elimane 是塞内加尔人，而不是马里人，并且出版于十九世纪三十年代，而不是六十年代，这一事实使他接近法语非洲文学的开端。我们对他的“非人道迷宫”的了解不多，但它肯定不是黑人。故事以一位暴君屠杀王国长老开始，暗示着大胆的反传统而非程式化的怀旧情绪。新闻剪报描述了一位“黑人兰波”，他激起了偏执的帝国主义者、居高临下的社会主义者和其他许多人的争论，他们似乎对这本书本身不太感兴趣，而对它是否是“深入骨髓的非洲人”感兴趣。&lt;/p >;&lt;p>;他的传记通过一系列引人入胜的嵌套叙述相互联系。当 Diégane 在阿姆斯特丹拜访 Siga D. 时，她向他讲述了这位伟大作家的私生活故事，并介绍了第三种叙述者阵容，其中包括记者、他的一位前情人，以及她在塞内加尔的家人——其中，有一个转折点，也是 Elimane 的。我们了解到，他与他的出版商——一对犹太夫妇——卷入了三人行。与法国抵抗运动并肩作战；他可能花了数年时间前往欧洲寻找他的父亲，他是一名受过殖民教育的士兵，在第一次世界大战中志愿为法国作战后失踪在战场上。不过，事实证明，埃利曼实际上可能是这名士兵的双胞胎和浪漫对手的儿子，他是一名施行巫术的盲人渔夫。亲子关系问题寓言了文学起源的危机：埃利马内是离开的兄弟还是留下的兄弟的继承人，是欧洲洗脑还是塞内加尔传统？作者的真实性，尤其是在非洲文学的背景下。抄袭指控如此迅速地让乌洛洛姆的职业生涯陷入困境，原因之一是读者期望他体现一个种族、一种文化和一个大陆的精髓。借用《暴力的束缚》中的一个形象，他向文学界的民族学家卖了一个假面具。然而，技巧和缺席是现代作家神话的基础，萨尔既嘲笑又挑衅地宣称这一点。 “对于一位作家和他们的作品，我们至少可以知道这一点，”迪耶加尼在小说的开场白中宣称。 “他们一起穿过可以想象到的最完美的迷宫，路径又长又圆，目的地与起点相同：孤独。”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt; div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;ybaby&quot;>;&lt;/ div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot;

data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;他呼应了莫里斯·布朗肖（Maurice Blanchot）（“文学正在走向自身，走向其本质，即消失”）和罗伯托·波拉尼奥，萨尔认为是罗伯托·波拉尼奥解放了他“将文学置于小说的核心”。这本书的构思和标题借鉴了波拉尼奥的《野蛮侦探》，这是另一部对文学史的疯狂研究；为了向拉丁美洲的元小说致敬，萨尔甚至派埃利马内去布宜诺斯艾利斯，在那里他与一位海地女诗人发生了恋情，并与伟大的现代主义者交往。萨尔似乎热衷于提醒读者，非洲作家是世界文学史的一部分，超越了非洲和欧洲的界限。&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc ” >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;有时，埃利马内的来回可能会变得令人厌烦，特别是因为他的美学和政治观点从未完全成为焦点。为了推动叙事，他需要保持难以捉摸的状态，但以某种方式将他牵涉到他所经历的许多历史剧中会更有趣。他顽固的冷漠是迪耶加内对其文学职业的矛盾心理的另一面：“冲突激烈，地球令人窒息……” 。 。外面是一片狗屎海洋，而我们，非洲大陆在其中游泳的非洲作家，正在讨论&lt;em>;非人道的迷宫&lt;/em>;，而不是做任何一件该死的事情来拯救它。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“人类最秘密的记忆”在法国与其前非洲殖民地之间的决裂中问世。西非和中非——几内亚、马里、布基纳法索、尼日尔以及最近的加蓬——发生的一系列政变受到了反对法国对该地区军事和经济影响的民众的欢呼。马里在新宪法中放弃了法语作为其官方语言的地位，而在塞内加尔，政府最近镇压了一位年轻反对派领导人的支持者，法国公司已成为目标。这会让居住在前大都市的非洲作家何去何从？&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;萨尔将这些焦虑融入了迪耶加内返回塞内加尔的过程中，他来到塞内加尔寻找埃利马内。一场青年起义席卷了达喀尔的街道，每个人都想知道他的看法。 “白人在法国谈论你，”一名活动人士在 Facebook 上向他发起挑战。 “但是&lt;em>;你&lt;/em>;要为你的国家说些什么呢？”迪耶甘羞于意识到，什么也没有。萨尔本人最近与人共同撰写了一篇评论文章，批评塞内加尔总统今年夏天的骚乱。但在小说中，他尽职尽责地拼凑出一场模糊的政治危机，远不如他之前作品中的危机那么引人注目。它读起来就像是对写一本关于文学而不是时事的小说的半心半意的道歉。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;对于谁可以分享艺术家的孤独还有一个政治因素。当迪耶甘离开达喀尔前往位于锡尼-萨卢姆三角洲的埃利马内村庄时——塞雷尔人的国家，迪耶甘和萨尔一样也属于塞雷尔人——散文变得丰富而直接，仿佛叙述者已经摆脱了对同龄人的担忧，前兆和政治责任。他对自己的揭秘使命的怀疑加剧了：“内心有一个声音希望埃利曼回到这里，希望他写下一些东西并留下一些东西;另一位则祈祷事实恰恰相反。 。 。他以匿名的方式结束了自己的生命，就像有一天，一颗星星在一千颗星星中燃烧殆尽。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Yambo Ouologuem &lt;em>;&lt;/em>; 被他抛弃的世界发现了。一位学者在十九世纪九十年代末找到了他，当他在马里塞瓦雷镇即兴演讲伊斯兰教义时，他感到很惊讶。他被激怒了，拒绝拍照，也不愿意讨论文学问题。当他顽强的发现者询问他对针对萨尔曼·拉什迪的追杀令的看法时，他拒绝发表评论，尽管他的一位朋友抗议说他前一天已经谈论过这个问题。最终，他接受了采访，澄清了他传记的各个方面。但这些交流有一种悲伤的虎头蛇尾的气氛，就像托马斯·品钦和儿子外出的模糊照片，或者克劳迪奥·加蒂“揭露”埃琳娜·费兰特的面具。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;萨尔本可以写一本关于乌洛洛姆的传记作品，推测他的借用背后的心理，他用笔名写的色情作品，或者他放弃世俗写作以进行宗教研究。他本可以完成关于《暴力的束缚》及其时代的论文，而不是写一部以他自己为背景的小说。但文学需要它的传奇。非洲文学永远面临着沦为证词的风险，可能比大多数文学更需要它们。有时，作者对前人最大的敬意就是继续他们离开的地方。 ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;787bos&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;

I think about&lt;br/>;their hair, the possible dark-brown curls. Baby fingers&lt;br/>;tapping on my face. I haven&#39;t made up my mind yet,&lt;br/>;but my body is making decisions before I am ready&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;to make them. I can&#39;t seem to say what it is I want&lt;br/>;out loud. I can almost see all my different lives, almost&lt;br/>;taste them, like trying to catch the tail end of a cinematic&lt;br/>;dream before it evaporates. I want to capture it, a glimpse,&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;sneak a peek at each distant future before the View-Master&lt;br/>;reel clicks. I want to follow the perfume of each life&lt;br/>;I could live and linger in it: the vanillas. Milk leaking&lt;br/>;from my breasts. Cereal. The piquant odor of parenthood.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The one where I am a mother negotiating happiness.&lt;br/>;The one where I am not a mother and still negotiating&lt;br/>;happiness, beauty, and rest. Almost 39, and I&#39;ve never&lt;br/>;loved myself more, yet nostalgia wavers all around me&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;like a montage of mirages muddling memories, complicating&lt;br/>;hope, making me miss things I&#39;ve already mourned.&lt;br/>;The bargaining—ain&#39;t it a bitch? The bargaining aspect&lt;br/>;of grief, to constantly release that which I&#39;ve already&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;let go of, but how the water in my mind brings it all back&lt;br/>;like the flood current each day, and each morning, in the ebb&lt;br/>;I see the seafloor for what it is, another landscape of loss&lt;br/>;and renewal, another augur deciphering the tea leaves&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;in the tide pool revealing the children I might never name,&lt;br/>;have, or hold. There is a finite number of eggs and books&lt;br/>;inside me. I am trying to release them. I am trying to mourn&lt;br/>;the possible futures bursting before me in a fantastic finale&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;of fireworks, bursting in my mouth like red caviar as I try&lt;br/>;to find the right words to say goodbye to little faces I can&lt;br/>;only imagine. I&#39;m not sure what I want. Each decision seems&lt;br/>;to dissolve at the edge of the beach softened by the watercolor&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;cream of winter floating above the same shore where Eliot wrote&lt;br/>;“The Waste Land” after a mental breakdown a hundred and one&lt;br/>;years before me, writing “On Margate Sands. / I can connect /&lt;br/>;Nothing with nothing.” I keep looking at the gentle waves&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;for answers without trying to make another metaphor.&lt;br/>;What if the image of what I&#39;m feeling is too heavy to be&lt;br/>;carried over into language? Maybe in another life you get&lt;br/>;to live out all the lives you&#39;ve imagined. Maybe in this life&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I become who I am by not knowing—&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;7oikt4&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;h6sji&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 11 Sep 2023 18:06:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[A Journey from Homelessness to a Room of One’s Own]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/09/18/a-journey-from-homelessness-to-a-room-of-ones-own]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-11T10:00:00.000Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64fbdc2f2fd41dd8ef9fb16c/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/230918_r42940.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;article >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attribute-verso-pattern=&quot;article-body&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;ArticlePageChunks&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Jessica moved into 90 Sands Street, a vast new supportive-housing facility in Brooklyn, on February 15th: a bleak, cloudy morning. The move came not a moment too soon; there had been much upheaval in her life in the previous few weeks, including an assault by her ex-boyfriend and two of his friends that had left her with facial bruises, and an overdose caused by the presence of the animal tranquillizer xylazine in her heroin—an honest error, it seemed, on the part of her trusted dealer—for which the forty-two-year-old was rushed to Mount Sinai from the transitional-housing facility where she&#39;d been living for nine months. “I was dead,” she told me with characteristic flair, in her strong Southern accent. “When I left in the ambulance, I was dead. They gave me CPR, they took me to the best hospital in Manhattan, and they shocked me in the hospital six times.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Her hospital discharge paper flapped in the breeze on top of one of the many plastic tubs that Jessica, her friend Bill, and her case manager, Carley Medley, hauled from Jessica&#39;s transitional-housing room to the van that Medley was driving. (Jessica&#39;s name and those of her friends and family have been changed.) Given that Jessica had spent most of the previous seven years living outdoors (with two interludes in jail for probation violations on old drug-related charges), she had amassed a remarkable number of possessions: Barbies and LOL Surprise! Balls, craft kits, scented candles, and an array of cosmetics. Jessica is savvy and resourceful, which is partly how she managed to survive, alone, on New York&#39;s streets. In addition to panhandling, which usually brought in a hundred dollars a day, she ran an online business with a friend, selling merchandise they&#39;d bought at a discount from “boosters,” who often had stolen it from large stores. Hence the random assortment of brand-new items in her bins.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Medley and Jessica met in 2019, when Medley, who is now twenty-nine, moved to New York with the goal of working in homeless outreach, an interest that was sparked by research on unhoused mothers that she did as a student at Ohio State. She got a job with the nonprofit Breaking Ground, working on a team that seeks out homeless people in and around Macy&#39;s flagship Thirty-fourth Street store. Breaking Ground&#39;s goal is to coax these clients, as they are known, into transitional and ultimately permanent housing &lt;em>;without&lt;/em>; requiring that they first accept treatment for the drug, alcohol, and mental-health issues that are widespread among New Yorkers who live outdoors. This strategy, known as “housing first,” was pioneered in New York, in the early nineteen-nineties, by Sam Tsemberis, a psychologist whose organization, Pathways to Housing, began renting apartments for homeless people with mental-health diagnoses and delivering medical and psychiatric services to them at their new residences—debunking the prevailing belief that people could not remain stably housed without having first undergone treatment. Study after study showed Tsemberis&#39;s approach to be far more successful than requiring treatment in advance. Housing first became a federal policy in the United States with passage of the &lt;em >;Hearth&lt;/em>; Act, in 2009, though advocates say that its implementation is spotty.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Outreach of the kind that Medley was doing at Macy&#39;s is the first step, but even identifying an unhoused person in a bustling department store can be a challenge. “Being in Macy&#39;s is kind of like hiding in plain sight,” Medley told me. “It&#39;s like, Oh, I think I&#39;ve seen that woman sitting here every day this week, and she was here last week. Maybe we can go introduce ourselves, let her know what we&#39;re here for.” This stage of the process, which is known as engagement, is uncertain and often protracted; mistrust leaves many unhoused people reluctant to interact, and, when you&#39;ve managed to survive outdoors in New York City, you might be excused for thinking that you don&#39;t need anyone&#39;s help.&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot;

She&#39;s white, with hazel eyes and thick dark hair that reaches to her waist, although she keeps it tied back. While living on the street, she used the oversized sink in Macy&#39;s wheelchair-accessible restroom to clean herself. “I&#39;d strip down naked, sit in the sink, and take a bath,” she told me. “Wash my hair and everything. I would be in there for, like, three hours. 。 。 。 They knew it was me in the bathroom, &#39;cause I would go, like, twice a week.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Medley first encountered Jessica panhandling outside Macy&#39;s with a sign that identified her as pregnant and fleeing an abusive marriage. Alarmed, Medley alerted her fellow outreach workers. “And they were, like, &#39;Carley, that&#39;s so cute. It&#39;s your first day, you don&#39;t know anything yet.&#39; Her belly looked so real. And they&#39;re, like, &#39;Yeah, she&#39;s been pregnant for like a year.

She says that she was introduced to heroin in her mid-thirties by her third husband, who relapsed shortly after their wedding into an addiction that Jessica had been unaware of. “He held me down and shot me up,” she told me. “I had never used drugs in my life, not even smoked weed.” Her husband then persuaded her to leave the Southern state where they were living and come with him to New York. “I said, &#39;You promise you&#39;re not going to leave me by myself?&#39; And he did.” Within a year, she found herself alone in a new city, loosely connected to a group of about fifty drug users, she said, all of them living on the street in midtown Manhattan.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;feature-large-callout&quot; >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;GroupCalloutWrapper&quot;>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;90 Sands which started taking supportivehousing residents in September 2022.&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64fbdcb32cdbfce2f3e4abd0/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/230918_r42955.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64fbdcb32cdbfce2f3e4abd0/master/w_120,c_limit/230918_r42955.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64fbdcb32cdbfce2f3e4abd0/master/w_240,c_limit/230918_r42955.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64fbdcb32cdbfce2f3e4abd0/master/w_320,c_limit/230918_r42955.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64fbdcb32cdbfce2f3e4abd0/master/w_640,c_limit/230918_r42955.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64fbdcb32cdbfce2f3e4abd0/master/w_960,c_limit/230918_r42955.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64fbdcb32cdbfce2f3e4abd0/master/w_1280,c_limit/230918_r42955.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64fbdcb32cdbfce2f3e4abd0/master/w_1600,c_limit/230918_r42955.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;90 Sands, which started taking supportive-housing residents in September, 2022.&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;A hand holds out a set of keys.&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64fbdc30a224c2af71e77eec/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/230918_r42957.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64fbdc30a224c2af71e77eec/master/w_120,c_limit/230918_r42957.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64fbdc30a224c2af71e77eec/master/w_240,c_limit/230918_r42957.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64fbdc30a224c2af71e77eec/master/w_320,c_limit/230918_r42957.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64fbdc30a224c2af71e77eec/master/w_640,c_limit/230918_r42957.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64fbdc30a224c2af71e77eec/master/w_960,c_limit/230918_r42957.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64fbdc30a224c2af71e77eec/master/w_1280,c_limit/230918_r42957.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64fbdc30a224c2af71e77eec/master/w_1600,c_limit/230918_r42957.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;Jessica holds the keys to her new apartment at 90 Sands on her move-in day.&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Situated in Dumbo, near the Brooklyn waterfront, 90 Sands is thirty stories high and has Richard Scarry-esque views of New York Harbor. Jessica&#39;s newly renovated studio apartment looked pristine, and its triple-paned windows replaced the din of the Manhattan Bridge subway traffic with suctioning silence. Like all the supportive-housing apartments in the building, it was furnished with a full-sized bed, a small table, and two chairs. There were built-in shelves and drawers in an enormous closet, and a “welcome box,” containing bedding, kitchen and cleaning supplies, and toiletries. The building has a gym, a computer room, a laundry room, a bike room, and an outdoor plaza, as well as a team of service providers that includes psychiatrists, a doctor, a nurse practitioner, and an employment specialist.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“There are a hundred types of people who are homeless, but there are basically two patterns: people who are homeless for short periods of time and people who are homeless for very long periods of time,” I was told by Dennis Culhane, a social-science researcher at the University of Pennsylvania, who has spent decades studying modern homelessness and has worked on the problem under the Bush and Obama Administrations. Short-term homelessness is best addressed with what is known as “rapid rehousing”: granting emergency cash and rent money for up to two years. Permanent supportive housing like 90 Sands is the most effective solution for those in the chronically homeless category: generally people with disabilities—usually mental illness or substance-use disorders, often both—who need long-term rent subsidies and support services to keep them stably housed. A recent study showed that about ninety per cent of homeless people who enter supportive housing remain housed after two years.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Supportive housing has evolved since it was introduced in New York, in the early nineteen-eighties, and exists in various forms, from “scattered site” arrangements, in which tenants occupy ordinary apartments (singly or with a roommate), to entire buildings like 90 Sands. What the different arrangements have in common is that case management comes to the tenants with the goal of helping them remain housed. According to an estimate provided by the Supportive Housing Network of New York, there are now thirty-seven thousand units of supportive housing in New York City, about ninety per cent of which are for single adults, and about thirty-eight hundred more are under construction. Still, the quantity is woefully inadequate to the current need. (A Department of Social Services spokesperson said that the city is working to “aggressively expand” its supportive-housing capacity.)&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;90 Sands was originally a residential hotel for Jehovah&#39;s Witnesses, and it has some unusual features, including a panoramic observation deck on the top floor and a gargantuan underground kitchen that will be rented out to a commercial tenant. Snagging such valuable real estate for a supportive-housing development required some creative financing from Breaking Ground, which then brought in the Center for Urban Community Services (&lt;em >;CUCS&lt;/em>;) to provide on-site social services and medical care. The two organizations have been collaborating on such projects in New York since 1991. By late spring, 90 Sands, which started accepting residents in September of 2022, had filled all of its three hundred and five supportive units, sixty per cent of the building&#39;s apartments. (The supportive residents&#39; rent is paid by New York City&#39;s Department of Housing Preservation and Development, in combination with either a public-assistance housing allowance or a third of the resident&#39;s income or disability payments.) The remaining hundred and eighty-five apartments are designated “affordable” units to be rented by low- and middle-income New Yorkers through a separate bureaucracy that has proceeded more slowly (as of this writing, about forty-five per cent of the affordable units had been leased), for sums ranging from $537 to $2,132. Mixing supportive and affordable units is a standard industry practice, and the two types of tenants are co-mingled throughout the building. Sixty-one thousand applicants entered the city&#39;s lottery for 90 Sands&#39;s affordable units, a testament to New York&#39;s ongoing crisis of affordable housing.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Eligible individuals are usually referred into specific units by New York City&#39;s Department of Social Services. However, 90 Sands served as a test case for direct referrals, in which Breaking Ground and &lt;em >;CUCS,&lt;/em>; both major players in the city&#39;s street-outreach work and transitional-housing programs, were able to refer qualified clients (Jessica being one) into two-thirds of 90 Sands&#39;s supportive units. This made for an expedited process that proved timely when busloads of asylum seekers began filling the city&#39;s shelters last fall; housing-approved tenants were able to move out quickly to make room.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;To qualify for supportive housing at 90 Sands, a homeless person must have received a diagnosis of either a substance-use disorder or a serious mental illness, such as bipolar disorder or schizophrenia. Jessica&#39;s heroin addiction made her eligible, but she insisted, in January, as I sat beside her on a freezing Upper West Side pavement outside Bed Bath &amp;amp; Beyond while she panhandled, that she had no need for that kind of support. “I&#39;ll stay for, like, a year, and hopefully they can find me an apartment without supportive housing. I don&#39;t want to take something from somebody that really needs it,” she said. By the time she moved in, a few weeks later, she had reduced her daily heroin intake from two grams—or twenty-plus bags (“My tolerance is out of this world”)—to a quarter of a gram, which she divided into morning and evening injections. When Jessica was in jail in 2018, she went on methadone, which allowed her to stay heroin-free for several months, but she now regarded methadone as another form of addiction and believed that it was harder on her body than heroin. Years of homelessness and drug use had taken their toll on her physically: she needed oral surgery to remove all her teeth; the veins in her arms were “shot,” meaning damaged from years of injecting; and, in January, a deep new wound appeared where she had injected heroin into her calf—a by-product of that animal tranquillizer that nearly killed her.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“That is a lot of paper . 。 。 my God,” Jessica said at the start of her lease signing, which took place in 90 Sands&#39;s brightly lit conference room at a table decorated with silk flowers. As her emergency contact, Jessica listed Mary, her aunt, whom she lived with as a young child in the Midwest and often referred to as her mother. Her biological parents, whom she called her sperm and egg donors, both had drug addictions and were absent from her early life. Her mother reappeared when Jessica was six and drove her from her aunt&#39;s home to the South. “I didn&#39;t even know her,” Jessica said. She remembers looking out the back window of the car and screaming for her aunt and her grandmother as she was driven away. Her mother had a new husband who abused Jessica, and she left home at fifteen. She finished high school and a year of community college while sharing a small, rented trailer with a female friend. She had her children at nineteen and twenty-two with her first husband and recounts having thrived professionally in young adulthood as a deli bakery manager for a supermarket chain, with more than a dozen bakeries under her supervision. “I had a new car every other year, a house. My kids were spoiled rotten. We went on vacation twice a year,” she told me. But a violent rupture with her second husband brought an end to this stability, and the children went to live with their father. She spoke of wanting to go back to school for culinary arts. “I can decorate wedding cakes, all kinds of cakes. I can do anything in a grocery store,” she said. She and her aunt remained in frequent contact and shared a passion for reading—thrillers especially. When I visited Jessica while she was panhandling on the Upper West Side, she&#39;d come straight from the public library and had in her trolley a backpack crammed with fiction by Michael Connelly, Nora Roberts, Nicholas Sparks, and others. While panhandling, she usually reads a book a day.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;After the lease signing, Jessica unpacked her library books and a few other items, including a tiny green cactus in a ceramic vase, which she placed on her new windowsill. Medley handed over Jessica&#39;s birth certificate and New York State ID: two hard-won “vital docs,” whose retrieval had been essential to qualifying her for supportive housing. Jessica had lost virtually everything while living outside—most people do, which is why it&#39;s nearly impossible to apply for housing while chronically homeless, and why street outreach and case management are crucial to the process.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;i7ku76&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;It was time for Medley to head back to Manhattan, and Jessica walked out to catch a ride with her. 90 Sands occupies a gap between the Manhattan Bridge, the Brooklyn Bridge, and the BQE; at times, the roar of overhead trains can halt conversation. “I know nothing about Brooklyn—at all,” she reflected, eying her new surroundings. Her heroin dealer, her panhandling spots, her friends—all of that was still in Manhattan. She climbed into the van with Medley and rode back.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The ongoing influx of asylum seekers caused the number of people being sheltered in New York City to balloon from around sixty-seven thousand last December to a hundred and eleven thousand in August, according to city data. (Counting the homeless is an imperfect science, and the data from DHS and from the Department of Housing and Urban Development don&#39;t always align.) But homelessness had already been rising for nearly a decade in New York and a number of other American cities—Los Angeles, Seattle, Portland, San Francisco, and Washington, DC, to name a few—where median rents had begun to exceed an average person&#39;s (or family&#39;s) ability to pay. New York State has the second-highest number of homeless people in the nation (largely living in New York City) after California, but whereas almost seventy per cent of California&#39;s homeless live on the street (a sizable portion in vehicles), fewer than six per cent of New York&#39;s do, making homelessness far less visible here. Many factors account for this disparity, chief among them the fact that New York City is the only municipality in America to guarantee a legal right to shelter for individuals and families—the result of court-approved agreements between advocates and the city that date back to the nineteen-eighties. (Massachusetts has a right to shelter for families.) Research disproves the notion that homeless people migrate to the West Coast for the weather; rather, a comparative paucity of shelter beds likely explains the more overt presence of homelessness there.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The six per cent or so of New Yorkers who choose to remain outdoors despite the city&#39;s right to shelter are almost all single adults who tend to be chronically homeless and predominantly male. Often, they sleep on the street because they&#39;re unwilling to enter the city&#39;s huge, centralized shelter system, which separates men and women into large congregate settings, sometimes dozens to a space. (Family shelter is handled through a different centralized system.) Drugs and alcohol are forbidden in city shelters; there are metal detectors and bag searches and a ten-o&#39;clock curfew if one is not to lose one&#39;s bed. Many shelters require that residents vacate the dorms during the day.&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;a data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a27868&amp;quot;}&quot;

One example is Kenneth Roberson, who moved into 90 Sands last September and was a lively source of knowledge and street smarts for me throughout my research. Roberson, who is sixty-four and Black, with bright-blue eyes, is an avuncular presence; he often covers his shaved head with a do-rag, maintains a tightly manicured mustache and goatee, and has a love of flashy sneakers. As a youth living in the Bronx, he ran with the Wild Cowboys, a notorious drug gang. He doesn&#39;t discuss his crimes, except to say that they went along with what he calls “the life style” of drugs and easy money, which always ends—he likes to quiz me on this—in either jail or death. (“Jenny on the block!” he&#39;ll crow, when I get it right.) Roberson logged more than twenty years behind bars through a combination of state and county bids, the last of which he completed fifteen years ago, at nearly fifty. During his criminal era, he spent two years on the run from police over parole violations, sleeping in abandoned buildings in Harlem to keep the law from breaking down the doors of the two women he adored—his long-term partner, a corrections officer who passed away in 2017, and his mother, whom he cared for in her &lt;em >;NYCHA&lt;/em>; apartment until she died the following year, leaving him homeless because his name wasn&#39;t on her lease. (“God bless you, baby,” Roberson sings out at the mention of either woman.)&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Recalling those desperate years of sleeping in derelict spaces can still move Roberson to tears (particularly when he&#39;s drinking vodka), and he had no intention of doing it again after his mother&#39;s death. He reported to the city&#39;s shelter system, where his history may have protected him from what many describe as a predatory atmosphere. “They know who&#39;s who,” Roberson told me. “ &#39;Oh, yeah, that&#39;s the drug dealer. Don&#39;t fuck with him. Oh, this guy, yo, he&#39;s been upstate before, he did a lot of time. 。 。 .&#39; ” Roberson advocated for himself with the shelters&#39; often overloaded case managers. “You gotta stay on top of those people,” he explained. His vigilance paid off in the form of a city housing voucher.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;For those who lack Roberson&#39;s institutional experience, particularly people with fragile mental health, drug addiction, or both, congregate city shelters can be frightening and dangerous. A thirty-four-year-old woman who lives at 90 Sands experienced a psychotic break while doing graduate work in literature at Columbia University. Her erratic behavior got her expelled from the program and cost her her apartment. She spent three years in city shelters, where she says that she was a target of violence from other women. “It&#39;s like prison,” she told me. “But there&#39;s no bars to protect you from people in shelters.” She is working on a memoir about those experiences.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Jessica never entered the shelter system; she&#39;d heard stories of how violent it was, and her husband, who was fleeing arrest warrants when they came to New York, didn&#39;t want to be tracked through official records. The two spent their first winter sleeping in a dog park near Wall Street. “And then we came to midtown and I slept on Thirty-fourth Street between Madison and Fifth for, like, a year and a half, the same spot,” she told me. “I was comfortable. I&#39;ve had mattresses, I&#39;ve had couch cushions I&#39;ve slept on, I&#39;ve had the foam things you can buy that go on your bed: I would put one down on the cardboard and get underneath my thousand blankets.” She carried a knife, but said she&#39;d never had to use it.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The enclaves that people make for themselves outdoors in New York—temporary, vulnerable, subject to vandalism, confiscation, and theft—are proof of how primal the nesting instinct is for nearly all of us. Many formerly unhoused people speak almost tenderly of “my spot” or “my place”: under scaffolding; on church steps; on roofs or in stairwells; in abandoned cars. While accompanying an outreach team in Brooklyn, I saw a frail Black woman using bleach and a broom to scour not just the sidewalk around her makeshift home—constructed of bright-colored beach umbrellas, under elevated subway tracks—but the street itself. John Wood, a white man in his fifties who moved to 90 Sands in March, told me that he&#39;d come to the city from upstate eight years ago with his wife, “my soulmate,” with whom he shared a heroin addiction. The pair refused to be separated into shelters, and Wood instead constructed a series of insulated cave-homes, gouging them into hillsides in Riverside and Morningside Parks. At night, the couple lit their caves with dozens of candles whose eerie flickering beauty Wood captured in videos on his cell phone. That phone was long gone, as were the homes, each eventually discovered and destroyed; as was Wood&#39;s soulmate, who died of blood poisoning resulting from her drug use. But the memory was clearly a vivid one.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;GenericCallout&quot;>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;Kenneth Roberson who moved into 90 Sands in 2022 after years in city shelters.&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64fbce04e1c106613c37380e/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/230918_r42954.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64fbce04e1c106613c37380e/master/w_120,c_limit/230918_r42954.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64fbce04e1c106613c37380e/master/w_240,c_limit/230918_r42954.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64fbce04e1c106613c37380e/master/w_320,c_limit/230918_r42954.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64fbce04e1c106613c37380e/master/w_640,c_limit/230918_r42954.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64fbce04e1c106613c37380e/master/w_960,c_limit/230918_r42954.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64fbce04e1c106613c37380e/master/w_1280,c_limit/230918_r42954.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64fbce04e1c106613c37380e/master/w_1600,c_limit/230918_r42954.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;Kenneth Roberson, who moved into 90 Sands in 2022, after years in city shelters.&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Many people describe acts of kindness from strangers who came to know them over time in their chosen spots. A young woman I spoke with, who immigrated from South Asia with her family when she was eleven, became homeless in her twenties after refusing an arranged marriage. Her parents banished her from their apartment, and she lived in and around parks in Queens for several years, hardly speaking to anyone, often weeping, but cared for by locals who left her plates of hot food, blankets, towels, and money when they passed by on their way to work.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Outreach workers are also a presence in the lives of most people who live outdoors in New York. A handful of nonprofits—Breaking Ground, &lt;em >;CUCS&lt;/em>;, Goddard Riverside, BronxWorks, Project Hospitality, and the Bowery Residents&#39; Committee (BRC)—contract with the city to coördinate the systematic canvassing of all five boroughs, including the subways, in round-the-clock shifts, seven days a week. Outreach teams must also respond within two hours to 311 calls reporting a problem that involves a homeless individual. (Homeless people may report themselves as a way of requesting help.) These teams of at least two hand out supplies—bottled water and sunscreen in summer, socks and hand warmers in winter—and perform wellness checks, particularly during Code Blue and Code Red periods when temperatures are extreme. A psychiatrist and a physician or nurse practitioner accompany each outreach team once a week to treat patients at their street locations. At the end of each shift, outreach teams enter notes into a central database: listing which clients they saw where, and what interactions took place. Breaking Ground&#39;s corporate partnerships, like the one with Macy&#39;s, operate in addition to this structure.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The goal of all street outreach is to invite homeless individuals first “onto caseload”—meaning that they agree to share their story in detail and to work with a case manager—and then into transitional housing. For those who are averse to city shelters, transitional housing can take the form of “safe havens” or “stabilization beds”—together referred to as “low-barrier units”—newer models that are smaller and more flexible and forgiving than most city shelters. These facilities are often co-ed, though sleeping spaces are divided by gender, and they usually offer more private units, with dividers that extend partway to the ceiling. Like shelters, they serve meals, but there are no curfews, and residents are required to check in only once every seventy-two hours in order to insure that their beds are held for them—an easier standard to meet for those whose lives are disregulated by active addiction or mental-health crises. With a higher concentration of case managers and housing specialists on-site, low-barrier units have become desirable alternatives to city shelters, albeit on a lesser scale. (There are about thirty-five hundred such beds in the city.)&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;yhyz1c&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Even with elaborate coördination and information-sharing, though, the process of transitioning someone from the street into housing is patchy and precarious at best. Clients move around and rarely have phones; case managers—a position that generally requires no higher education, license, or specialized training—are poorly paid and often overburdened, though the good ones are heroic and save lives.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Last December, I joined a morning shift in Manhattan with Ramata Touré, a thirty-year-old assistant director at Breaking Ground&#39;s Connect to Care program, which is funded by a consortium of more than sixty companies through the Partnership for NYC. Touré oversees four supervisors and twenty outreach case managers, but, she says, she still likes to do outreach herself “once in a blue moon, just to keep up with my skills.” In a subway entrance on West Forty-sixth Street, she engaged a stocky, strident forty-five-year-old Black man, who was leaning on a pair of crutches and opening a Slim Jim with his teeth. He identified himself as Paul Cameron, and immediately began to complain about not having been placed in transitional housing. Touré offered to arrange transportation for him that afternoon to Olivieri&#39;s, a drop-in center on West Thirtieth Street (drop-in centers have reclining chairs where clients can stay overnight), while she looked for a safe-haven bed for him. Cameron was brashly skeptical. “Everything you say has been said to me,” he challenged Touré. “You sound enthusiastic, but I heard that before.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Touré had long braided hair, and wore a bright-green Partnership for NYC jacket. “I can&#39;t speak for others,” she rejoined amiably. “I can only say what I can do from our engagement today and on.” She gave Cameron a woollen hat, gloves, and granola bars, and took his photograph so that afternoon outreach workers driving the promised van would recognize him. But I later learned that, when the van arrived at the appointed time, Cameron wasn&#39;t there. It was a cold day, and he may have gone into the subway, where outreach is handled exclusively by the BRC “That&#39;s sometimes where the disconnect can happen, with the up and down,” Touré told me. “When it&#39;s cold, clients will go down.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;A native New Yorker, Touré was studying forensic psychology at John Jay College when she volunteered to join DHS&#39;s &lt;em >;PIT&lt;/em>; count in East Harlem—a “point-in-time” tally of every American municipality&#39;s total homeless population is required every two years. She liked the work and applied to Breaking Ground as a case manager soon afterward. (She completed her master&#39;s degree in social work last fall.) In the Times Square pedestrian plaza, Touré approached the Recharge Station, an outdoor booth operated by Fountain House, a mental-health organization. A small group of people—some tourists, it appeared—were partaking of coffee and snacks while charging their phones. “Identifying who may or may not be homeless can be the tricky part here,” Touré said, scanning the crowd. “People expect clients to look a particular way, and here you will not find that; clients are dressed appropriately, keep up with their hygiene, and blend in. You have to look for a tell: sometimes they&#39;ll have dirty fingernails, certain little markings, and the footwear kind of gives off a little bit.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;A hesitant, bearded older Black man approached Touré; he had been on Breaking Ground&#39;s caseload but had fallen off—something that often happens when people are hospitalized, jailed, or leave the city for a time. Touré arranged for him to go back on and noted his preference for a safe-haven bed. Later, she spotted an elderly white woman hunched over a suitcase under a scaffold, wearing a red Christmas sweater and a red face mask. The woman&#39;s tiny hands were exposed to the bitter chill. Touré approached respectfully. “My name is Ramata. I&#39;m from Breaking Ground. Are you OK?”她问。 “Do you want a hand warmer or anything?” The woman started, then recoiled, shrieking incoherently. Touré backed off with an apology. “Some clients resist the engagements,” she explained.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;About a month later, in January, I joined James Martin, a &lt;em >;CUCS&lt;/em>; supervisor for street outreach, for a 5:30 &lt;em >;am&lt;/em>; shift in upper Manhattan. Martin is fair and open-faced, and moves at times with the awkwardness of a very tall person. It was a Code Blue day, and we looked for three individuals who required wellness checks but weren&#39;t visible that morning; likely, they&#39;d gone underground to avoid a deluge of rain the previous night. Martin was also searching for a fourth person, a Black woman named Iishea Stone, a wheelchair-bound amputee who had discharged herself from Harlem Hospital—she&#39;d been admitted with &lt;em >;Covid&lt;/em>;—but hadn&#39;t returned to the Kelly, a &lt;em >;CUCS&lt;/em>; safe haven on West 127th Street, where she&#39;d been living for several months. Martin drove past a corner bodega in West Harlem that was Iishea&#39;s usual street spot, but she wasn&#39;t there.&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot;

Martin, who fell into outreach work years ago and also completed his master&#39;s degree in social work last fall, spent two years in the Peace Corps in Ecuador; he led the way, calling “&lt;em>;Buenos días!&lt;/em>; ” I followed him into a breathtaking debris field of single-use plastics and kaleidoscopic trash. Though devoid of human beings, the place intimated a breadth of recent activity: soiled mattresses, lighters, brooms and brushes, cigarette butts, a sequinned blue dress, rain-sodden socks, plastic cutlery, lipsticks, curlers, a spool of thread, a hurricane lamp, a crushed baby stroller, and a ubiquitous sprinkling of orange syringe caps. It was a reminder that life doesn&#39;t stop for people who live outdoors, invisible though they often may be to the rest of us. Iishea Stone, the woman Martin had been looking for, articulated this point for me a couple of weeks later, after outreach workers had located her by the bodega and she&#39;d cheerfully accepted a ride back to the Kelly.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;0t9hh8&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;“I had a life before this,” Iishea said once she&#39;d rolled her wheelchair into a small office off the Kelly&#39;s bustling hallway. “When I was homeless, I used to roll around the streets at night. I like being outside; I&#39;m like a butterfly. There&#39;s a peace of solitude. I was able to talk to God. If God spoke back, I was able to hear him—either a thought or an emotion, I was able to connect it to God. I roll the streets, like &#39;&lt;em>;Wheeeeeeee!&#39;&lt;/em>; I own the streets—there are no cars.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The wheelchair was a relatively new addition to Iishea&#39;s life; in 2020, she was run over by a subway train that severed her left foot and half of her left hand. (She had a prosthetic leg, but it hurt to wear it.) At fifty-one, she was a riveting presence, radiant, athletic, and a mesmerizing narrator of a dizzying life story: sexually abused from age five by her stepfather and three older brothers; dismissed by her mother even after the abuse was corroborated by another family member; introduced to crack cocaine at thirteen by family friends who had driven her to an after-school swimming practice. Iishea left home—Far Rockaway—that year and survived on the streets thereafter, mostly around Times Square, where she sold drugs and sought out the company of people who would protect her. She served multiple prison sentences for drug dealing. “The last time was four and a half to nine, and I did every bit of nine years, because I did four state bids already. So I became a &#39;persistent predicate,&#39; which means you keep doing the same goddam thing and you&#39;re gonna get it. But I&#39;m not mad at that.” In prison, she added, “I became a welder, I became a metal fabricator, a cook, I got my GED, and then I got with the older women and I listened. I knew they didn&#39;t want nothing from me. I could sit down and actually be OK with listening, you know? And I learned. So when I came home I was a woman. And every bit of a phenomenal woman. And everything I had was enhanced. Everybody will say you become pessimistic from being in prison.没有。不。 I found refuge.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;When Iishea completed that sentence, she was in her late thirties. She returned to New York and reconnected with an old acquaintance who became her husband. What followed was a golden interlude: the owner of the Brooklyn halfway house where Iishea stayed after prison agreed to rent her a house in Prospect Lefferts Gardens, and she and her husband lived there with their nine cats. Both stopped using and went on methadone. Iishea&#39;s husband had maintenance jobs at two churches, and Iishea worked at a deli and went to TCI College. Every other Thursday, they took the train to Harlem for a comedy show. Then their housing fell apart: they were supposed to move into a rental apartment in a Brooklyn brownstone, but the building was sold to new owners who rescinded the agreement—a development that seems to have crushed them.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“We got a monkey wrench thrown in our plans . 。 。 it felt like all our hard work just went down the drain,” Iishea told me. They went to a family shelter and were placed in a boarding house on Park Avenue, in Harlem, that was vermin-infested. Both went back to drugs and began drinking heavily. “We used to sit there and watch the mice playing tag on our table. 。 。 。 Everything just . 。 。 it went downhill. Everything you built—you watch it disappear just like that.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Her husband found maintenance work in Harlem, but Iishea had returned to dealing by the time she fell onto the subway tracks, in the winter of 2020. “The state shut me down,” she said. “The government shut me down This happened maybe thirty-five days before the panic of the &lt;em >;Covid&lt;/em>;. &lt;em>;Bang!&lt;/em>; I couldn&#39;t get into these places. They didn&#39;t want to answer their phones.” In August of that year, her husband died from cirrhosis of the liver. “He was the only ray of sunshine in my entire life. Him. Him,” she told me, weeping. “And when he died the only refuge I got is God, and sometimes I don&#39;t feel like I got him.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Iishea&#39;s account of what happened next was a textbook case of how street outreach is supposed to work. For months at a time, she slept in front of a bodega at the corner of Frederick Douglass Boulevard and West 116th Street. “I&#39;m never shy of working. I used to sweep up, or help them with the boxes and the fruit. They have a flower shop in front—they used to teach me about the flowers and stuff.” She suffered from asthma and congestive heart disease and had been told that she might need a pacemaker. (At one point, she told me, a heart-monitoring vest she&#39;d been prescribed was stolen from her at a city shelter.) Then she was approached by a representative of the &lt;em >;cucs&lt;/em>;-led Manhattan Outreach Consortium. “They was, like, &#39;Someone really, really, really cares about you. They called us and asked us could we help you. Iishea, what is it that you want?&#39; And I told them, &#39;I don&#39;t know what I want right now.&#39; So they kept coming, and they kept seeing me in that same spot or the immediate vicinity. And then one day I was, like, &#39;OK I&#39;m ready.&#39; ”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;mofa6r&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;The Kelly, which has sixty beds and caters to chronically homeless clients with serious mental-health diagnoses (eighty per cent of whom also use drugs), is a friendly place, and Iishea raved about her three roommates and the Kelly&#39;s director, Aimee Poulin. Her case manager was another story: according to Iishea, she had been absent for several weeks and left her in limbo. Iishea had yet to be approved for disability benefits or even for public assistance. “I don&#39;t understand why they won&#39;t give me no type of income at all,” she fumed, looking down at the stump of her left shin. “Inquiring minds want to know: &lt;em>;What the fuck&lt;/em>;?”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Iishea still used crack cocaine, she told me (“Please don&#39;t ask me to deal with this shit sober!”), but her use had diminished since she&#39;d moved into the Kelly. “When I was on the street, every day, every minute of my life, was idle time. I didn&#39;t want to feel anything, so I used. I haven&#39;t stopped, but I sure cut the hell down. At this point, it&#39;s when I &lt;em>;want&lt;/em>; to do it, not when I need to anymore.” She had a new suitor who was not a drug user—a Dominican man who&#39;d begun courting her when she was sleeping outside the bodega. “Whenever I feel like I want to indulge, I can, and he feels no way about it. He don&#39;t judge me,” she said. The keys to his apartment—on the ground floor, luckily, a city bus ride away—hung around her neck. She visited him overnight sometimes, but since her January disappearance she&#39;d always returned to the Kelly within the required seventy-two hours, in the hope of eventually getting her own apartment. “Don&#39;t get the fuck-its!” she told me, acknowledging her tendency to give up impulsively out of frustration and impatience. “These people allot you a lot of room. I don&#39;t want no rope to hang myself. I just want that room so I can get my place, that&#39;s it. Ooh, that&#39;s it.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The cactus on Jessica&#39;s windowsill was soon joined by sprouting bamboo stalks in a glass vase, and an aroma dispenser that suffused the air with a puff of floral sweetness every few minutes, masking the smell of the Newport 100s she smokes. Her books were carefully arranged, along with her collection of tiny Ty Beanies. I was startled to find that a miniature set of wheeled plastic shelves I&#39;d handed down to her contained orange-capped syringes from a needle exchange, plastic baggies full of miniature cotton balls, and the small squat cylinders that her heroin came in (at one point, her dealer would refund her two dollars and fifty cents for each one she returned to him).&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Before I arrived to visit, Jessica had been touching up her walls with a Magic Eraser to remove fingerprints left by Bill, the friend who&#39;d helped her move, and whom she&#39;d allowed to stay in her apartment for several days. That morning she&#39;d demanded that he leave. Bill&#39;s fiancée had died recently from an overdose (he does not use drugs), and he&#39;d fallen hard for Jessica on the rebound, even accompanying her while she was panhandling. “Ever since Bill started following me around, I stopped making money,” she vented. “He&#39;s trying to hug and kiss me. And I&#39;m, like, &#39;Dude, my sign says “Pregnant with an Abusive Husband”—they think that&#39;s you and I&#39;m still with you! Get away from me!&#39; ”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;She&#39;d made a new friend at 90 Sands, Troy, who she&#39;d correctly sensed was a fellow heroin user. Although he was on methadone, he&#39;d shot up with her several times and made tacos for her in her apartment. Bill was jealous of the new friendship, and Jessica had heard him grumbling under his breath when Troy came over the previous night. As she was telling me this, Bill called her cell phone. “OK, I have company,” Jessica told him testily. “I&#39;m allowed to have company, Bill, and I&#39;m allowed to have friends. And it&#39;s not Troy. 。 。 。 Don&#39;t get an attitude with me and say it like you just said it.” She listened for a while, then protested, “You&#39;ve gotta stop this jealousy shit. I told you I would be the most loyal best friend you ever had in your life, but I&#39;m not interested in you that way.” Bill&#39;s shouted reply prompted her to explode: “It ain&#39;t got nothing to do with getting high! Because you don&#39;t get &lt;em>;high&lt;/em>;? You think I want you to be a fucking heroin addict? Are you, like, crazy?” More bellowing from Bill. “I have company, so I have to go,” she said, cutting him off. “I love you, too. Bye.” After hanging up, she continued to rail as though Bill were in the room: “Are you an idiot? Do you think I want you to be a heroin addict? I wouldn&#39;t wish that on my worst enemy. Do you think I &lt;em>;want&lt;/em>; to live like this?”&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;a data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a27501&amp;quot;}&quot;

Supportive tenants&#39; former case managers are supposed to remain actively involved for the first three months after their clients move into 90 Sands, in order to soften the handoff to an unfamiliar case-management team, but a number of tenants told me that this “after-care” hadn&#39;t happened for them—one of many ways in which the case-manager position, with its low pay and high turnover, can constitute an unreliable link in the structure of homeless outreach and supportive housing, even as its low barriers to entry also encourage serendipitous vocations like Touré&#39;s and Martin&#39;s. Nearly all the people I spoke with described a trail of failed or abandoned case-manager relationships preceding the successful one—like Jessica&#39;s with Medley—that finally helped get them off the street and into housing.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;The vibe among tenants, in those early months at 90 Sands, was an uneasy mixture of wariness and need. Roberson&#39;s good will, for instance, stopped short at the prospect of neighborly visits. “Don&#39;t knock on my door about nothing” was how he summarized his position. “Once you start giving, people take advantage of that. I&#39;m not trying to break bread. You stay your distance, I stay mine.” He considers that, of his fellow-tenants, “sixty per cent is whack, and forty per cent is good.” When I asked him to clarify which group he was part of, he said, with a chuckle, “I came from the sixty per cent, but I&#39;m down with the forty per cent.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Within a few weeks of meeting Troy, her new neighbor-friend, Jessica called security to have him removed from her apartment after he hit her in the face. Later, they patched things up; then she swore off him again, saying he was using her for drugs. Then he agreed to take care of her new cat . 。 。 and so on. Relations with neighbors are complicated, as any city dweller knows, but the nature of supportive housing can compound those complications. One tenant who moved into 90 Sands last fall confided to me that the people in the next apartment had installed cameras inside his unit and were firing commentary at him through the walls. Understandably, he wanted to escape this invasion by changing apartments. But, to his frustration, Matthew Minogue, 90 Sands&#39;s building director, wouldn&#39;t grant his request.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;3ph2ss&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;Russell Reavesbey with his cat Roxy in his apartment at 90 Sands in May.&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64fbdc30b3510264829c1d49/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/230918_r42956.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64fbdc30b3510264829c1d49/master/w_120,c_limit/230918_r42956.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64fbdc30b3510264829c1d49/master/w_240,c_limit/230918_r42956.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64fbdc30b3510264829c1d49/master/w_320,c_limit/230918_r42956.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64fbdc30b3510264829c1d49/master/w_640,c_limit/230918_r42956.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64fbdc30b3510264829c1d49/master/w_960,c_limit/230918_r42956.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64fbdc30b3510264829c1d49/master/w_1280,c_limit/230918_r42956.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64fbdc30b3510264829c1d49/master/w_1600,c_limit/230918_r42956.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;Russell Reavesbey, with his cat, Roxy, in his apartment at 90 Sands, in May.&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;p >;Russell Reavesbey, a fifty-six-year-old Black Muslim who wears shiny, bright-colored jilbabs, has a tendency to close his eyes while speaking, as if to tame his thoughts. When agitated, he paces. In both states, he often revisits a litany of losses: his mother, in 1998; his father, in 2000; a brother, who died of &lt;em >;AIDS&lt;/em>;; another brother who was killed in a car accident; a sister who was murdered. “There&#39;s not one moment I don&#39;t miss my mother and my father,” he told me. “Ain&#39;t nobody around, nobody I can talk to.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Reavesbey had been homeless virtually his entire adult life until he moved into 90 Sands, having cycled for decades among shelters, safe havens, jails, and psychiatric hospitals. He became a father at forty-three; that daughter is now thirteen, living with her mother, and their second daughter is a year old. He wants to get his GED and become a veterinary assistant—he adores animals—but says that his Social Security card was stolen by terrorists during 9/11. There is one loss that always sends Reavesbey into pacing mode: when he was living on the street in Brooklyn and was picked up by police, he asked his then girlfriend to watch his bag, which contained a precious family photo album he&#39;d somehow managed to hold on to through the chaotic years. When Reavesbey was released the next day, bag and treasure had been lost. “It was all I had, because Mother and Father were dead and gone,” he fumed, stalking his apartment in stocking feet as he recalled the discovery. “Those pictures to me was, like, sentimental, you understand? And that hurted me! I want to kill her, man.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;He was also furious at whichever of his neighbors had found the apartment key he thought he&#39;d lost somewhere in the building and failed to return it. “Somebody has my key, and if I find out who has that key I bet you this: they won&#39;t be staying in here,” he muttered. “Won&#39;t be staying in here, because Imma—oh, Miss Jenny, I didn&#39;t mean to say it like that.” He fell into pained silence until I assured him that all was well between us. “I just didn&#39;t want you to see the other side of me, that&#39;s all,” he said. “I figured you&#39;d be disappointed or something.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Reavesbey was one of 90 Sands&#39;s first tenants. He moved in on September 15th, the same day as Donald Malloy, who is known as Speedy. Speedy, who is Black, wears square glasses, fashionably torn jeans, and has a large tattoo of a microphone on one forearm. He&#39;s restless and fit and loves to work delivering food and packages. He&#39;s open about having bipolar disorder and PTSD, which were diagnosed during his teen-age years. He grew up in his grandmother&#39;s home in Queens Village, but when she passed away and the bank foreclosed on her house he and his mother, with whom he has a volatile relationship, moved into a new apartment. After a physical fight with her when he was twenty-three, Speedy began sleeping in stairwells and on public-housing roofs, with spells in jail, psychiatric hospitals, and ten different shelters before outreach workers found him sleeping on the subway and referred him to a safe haven. He&#39;d had relationships with women simply to have a place to sleep, he told me. “I lost my home, my family&#39;s broken down. It make me cry a lot,” he said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;When I visited Speedy last February, a pan of stewed oxtails he&#39;d recently cooked was sitting on the stove. “I grew up in a household where everybody fight,” he told me. “Everything was broken. My family broke the house, they broke the window, they broke the thermostat. When I was young, I used to punch walls and everything. My brother used to do the same. I don&#39;t destroy nothing up in here. I make sure I clean everything. I do not like pests!” His windowsill was strewn with medication bottles; loose tobacco and weed covered the kitchen table. He rolled the mixture into cigarettes and smoked them in succession.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Within a few weeks of moving into 90 Sands, Speedy began clashing with the security guards who are stationed at the building&#39;s entrance around the clock. A government-issued ID is required for nonresidents to enter, and Speedy was incensed when a guard refused to allow his female guest into the building. “I&#39;m, like, &#39;You&#39;re security but you ain&#39;t gonna tell me how to live, &#39;cause I pay my rent here.&#39; I flashed my Taser. They called the ambulance and police; you can&#39;t have weapons up in here. I&#39;m, like, &#39;I just want to go to the hospital. I don&#39;t know what y&#39;all talking about. 。 。 .&#39; But if I hit them I&#39;m gonna get kicked out. I&#39;m gonna lose my privileges of living here.” Speedy was taken by ambulance to the hospital, where he was asked a series of mental-health questions and released later that night.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;j6lha&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;“I threw it in the river,” he said of the Taser. “I don&#39;t want to go back to sleeping on trains or sleeping on rooftops or sleeping with three hundred people in shelters. No. I can&#39;t do it no more. I just can&#39;t.” He mentioned often that he had turned thirty and wanted to complete his education. “There&#39;s a lady that was eighty-six that went back to school, and she got her diploma,” he told me. “It&#39;s never too late. Never.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In March, I received a text at 4:01 &lt;em >;am&lt;/em>;. from a man named Victor Lopez, whom I&#39;d interviewed at his safe haven and again at 90 Sands, where he&#39;d moved earlier that month after decades of homelessness: “I need to talk to you something happened yesterday that was dangerous to my life in the building it needs to be addressed or it may be one day someone&#39;s life may be taken like mine almost was yesterday please call me today later.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;That afternoon, I accompanied Lopez to basement level C1 at 90 Sands, where Breaking Ground and &lt;em >;CUCS&lt;/em>; have their offices. Lopez, a slight, courtly sixty-one-year-old who wears a porkpie hat and walks with a cane, relayed his story to Minogue. He&#39;d been visiting a friend on another floor the previous afternoon and was waiting for the elevator in order to return to his own apartment. “All of a sudden I hear, &#39;Open the fucking door.&#39; Elevator opens, she comes out with a big kitchen knife, chasing after me. As I was going backwards, I said, &#39;But I didn&#39;t do anything to you.&#39; She stopped, and my friend opened her door when I ring her bell. I stood inside her apartment for hours.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Minogue, a cheery man with a red beard who worked for years in the forensic ward at Bellevue Hospital, has the air of someone who would be difficult to shock. “I&#39;m aware of this tenant. I know who we&#39;re talking about,” he assured Lopez, and urged him to file an incident report with building security. He also mentioned that Lopez had the option of pressing formal charges. (The son of a police officer, Minogue works to maintain good relations with the local precinct, which he said was aware of 90 Sands as a “hot spot.”) “Our building is very well covered in cameras,” Minogue said to Lopez. “We can&#39;t provide footage to police unless they provide us with a subpoena. That could happen if you press charges. I&#39;m not encouraging you to. 。 。 。 You have a right to feel safe in the place where you live.” He did encourage Lopez to share his experience at the monthly tenant meeting that took place the following day.&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;Speedy sitting on a bed in his apartment.&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64fbdc309064d16b7cee26bc/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/230918_r42959.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64fbdc309064d16b7cee26bc/master/w_120,c_limit/230918_r42959.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64fbdc309064d16b7cee26bc/master/w_240,c_limit/230918_r42959.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64fbdc309064d16b7cee26bc/master/w_320,c_limit/230918_r42959.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64fbdc309064d16b7cee26bc/master/w_640,c_limit/230918_r42959.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64fbdc309064d16b7cee26bc/master/w_960,c_limit/230918_r42959.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64fbdc309064d16b7cee26bc/master/w_1280,c_limit/230918_r42959.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64fbdc309064d16b7cee26bc/master/w_1600,c_limit/230918_r42959.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;Speedy, in his apartment, in May. “I don&#39;t want to go back to sleeping on trains or sleeping on rooftops or sleeping with three hundred people in shelters,” he said.&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;p >;I caught up with Minogue before that meeting and asked him about the policy on threatening behavior at 90 Sands. “There are things that people do here, and behaviors that they engage in, that would very likely not be tolerated in other buildings,” he told me. “We try not to leap too readily to evictions for behavior stuff. But some are just blowing that tolerance—or one in particular is blowing it—way out of the water.” The difficulty for Minogue and his staff lies in balancing the conflicting needs of many fragile and unstable tenants. “There&#39;s an erosion of feeling that you&#39;re in a place you can call home if you feel like you&#39;re under assault,” he told me. “And when there&#39;s a lot of &lt;em>;stuff&lt;/em>; happening, fights or threats and things like that, that erosion happens more quickly.” Lopez didn&#39;t attend that tenant meeting, but I heard other complaints about his assailant.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;After the meeting, as I was entering the F-train station, I paused to give a dollar to a gaunt, forlorn figure wearing a face mask, huddled on the pavement wrapped in a soiled gray blanket. As I leaned down, the man lowered his mask and grinned at me. “Hi, Jenny!” It was Lopez. I was stupefied; I had sat at his kitchen table the previous day but had failed to recognize him without his porkpie hat—hadn&#39;t really looked at him, perhaps.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;People who used to cohabit in safe havens may cease to feel an affinity once they&#39;re sharing an apartment building—evidence of the wide array of backgrounds and histories that converge under the generic rubric “homeless,” a category I&#39;ve come to feel is no more descriptive than that of “voter” or “employee.” A man I&#39;ll call Danny, a member of the International Union of Operating Engineers, is licensed to drive bulldozers, backhoes, and small cranes. When I first met him at the Kelly safe haven, Danny, a trim and voluble forty-six, told me, “If I never became homeless, I wouldn&#39;t even talk to these types of people. But because I&#39;ve ridden the trains, them same people have given to &lt;em>;me&lt;/em>; food, given to &lt;em>;me&lt;/em>; a dollar, given to &lt;em>;me&lt;/em>; things when I didn&#39;t have anything, so I&#39;m not going to shun them. These are my people.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Danny grew up outside Philadelphia, the son of a white mother and a Black father. A self-described “Neanderthal type of guy” who admires Donald Trump, he was living in a house in Westchester with his wife, a nurse, and their three children when, in 2018, he began to suspect that his oldest son might be gay and confronted him disapprovingly. Enraged, Danny&#39;s son retaliated a few weeks later by stabbing him in the abdomen. The internal injuries caused hernias that have made it impossible for Danny to return to work, and the violent rift with his son broke up the family. Danny began living in his C-Class Mercedes, eventually downgrading to a Toyota. Four years passed as he moved in and out of shelters and slept on subways, unable to get the abdominal surgery he needed without a place in which to recover. He fell apart mentally and physically before finally connecting with outreach workers at the Salvation Army and moving into the Kelly.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Yet Danny has family and a social fabric that many at 90 Sands lack. His new apartment is full of gifts from his mother. He and his wife have divorced, but he sees his children regularly and says that he&#39;s working to repair relations with the son who injured him. His case manager is helping him plan for his surgery, after which he intends to resume full-time work. Shortly after moving into 90 Sands, he paid a social call to a fellow Kelly resident&#39;s new apartment and found himself among people smoking crack and K2, a form of synthetic marijuana. He quickly distanced himself from that crowd and has focussed instead on discovering Dumbo&#39;s upscale social offerings. A few weeks after moving in, he texted me, “I had to tell you Jennifer that this place gives so much more than inspiration and desire. A lust for life. 90 sands gave me that ☺.”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;GenericCallout&quot;>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;Marvell Calloway seated at a table by a window in his apartment.&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64fbdc308dd3be3e00168270/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/230918_r42958.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64fbdc308dd3be3e00168270/master/w_120,c_limit/230918_r42958.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64fbdc308dd3be3e00168270/master/w_240,c_limit/230918_r42958.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64fbdc308dd3be3e00168270/master/w_320,c_limit/230918_r42958.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64fbdc308dd3be3e00168270/master/w_640,c_limit/230918_r42958.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64fbdc308dd3be3e00168270/master/w_960,c_limit/230918_r42958.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64fbdc308dd3be3e00168270/master/w_1280,c_limit/230918_r42958.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64fbdc308dd3be3e00168270/master/w_1600,c_limit/230918_r42958.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;Marvell Calloway, in his apartment, in May. “I go about my business of that day and come home to peace and quiet, everything done, decent and in order,” he said.&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Marvell Calloway, a forty-five-year-old commercial driver from Florida, furnished his 90 Sands studio immediately upon moving in: a rug, an enormous TV, two counter stools, and a multi-panelled poster of a golden-eyed panther, all coördinated in black and gray with red accents. With its astonishing view of the Brooklyn Bridge, the apartment looks like a real-estate ad. Calloway, who is Black, has a gold grill on his upper front teeth and a manner that combines elaborate Southern politeness (“Yes, Ma&#39;am”) with occasional deadpan irreverence. “That just me, you know,” he said of his décor. “I had a vision in how I like to organize things. I go about my business of that day and come home to peace and quiet, everything done, decent and in order.” He is wary of his fellow-tenants, some of whom he knew from two years of living at a safe haven, where, he said, “common sense is not common, especially when it comes to hygiene. You gotta give &#39;em a extra push: &#39;Get in the shower, the water free! Ain&#39;t got no alligators, no sharks, and such.&#39; I guess they just stuck in that salvage life.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Calloway has always worked, yet homelessness has nipped at his heels for much of his adult life, in large part because of alcoholism. (While at the safe haven, he joined AA and has been sober for more than a year, attending AA meetings daily by Zoom on his phone.) He was drawn to New York in 2019 by the higher minimum wage, and for months slept in shelters and parks while working at a bakery in Grand Central Terminal to pay for the transfer of documents he needed in order to drive commercial vehicles here. Like Roberson, Calloway resists easy friendships at 90 Sands. “&lt;em>;Let me see your place, man!&lt;/em>; No, I don&#39;t do that. I tell him, &#39;It look just like yours. You know when you walk in your door with your key? Imagine that, just with me in it.&#39; ” Like Danny, Calloway has a professional network and good income prospects—things that are beyond the reach of many at 90 Sands. “All my friends are employed,” he told me. “So when I talk about work, it won&#39;t be unfamiliar. It&#39;s different than a person that ain&#39;t never had a job. I&#39;m, like, &#39;You ain&#39;t got no type of hustle in you? How in the world?&#39; I got cans in my closet. When it fill up, I&#39;m taking them to the recycling shop. It&#39;s not much money, but it&#39;s money: five cents a can.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Moving is disruptive for everyone. But the first weeks in a new home can be particularly volatile for people with serious mental-health or addiction issues—especially if they haven&#39;t experienced stable housing in years or decades. Sarah Lipsky, the program director at 90 Sands, supervises the “supportive” part of the housing. (She was recently promoted and will soon oversee a portfolio of &lt;em >;CUCS&lt;/em>; buildings, including 90 Sands.) A playful presence, with close-cropped blond hair and a palpable affection for her tenants, Lipsky told me, “One of the most reparative things, to me, in what we do is having the opportunity to build that relationship with people. There&#39;s so much healing that can happen just by being there and being a person who leads with that love and care and concern and respect that so many people haven&#39;t had. It doesn&#39;t solve everything, but it does a lot for people who have been collectively disenfranchised.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;But the breakneck pace of move-ins and a shortage of staff in the early months at 90 Sands sometimes made it challenging to form the necessary case manager-tenant bonds. Jessica&#39;s case manager was brand-new when they met at her lease signing, and she left the job three weeks later. Jessica, who is still in frequent contact with Medley, had little interest in engaging with a successor. Nor was she required to; while it is a condition of &lt;em >;cucs&lt;/em>;&#39;s government funding that the organization provide a quarterly service plan for every supportive tenant, which includes goals and challenges, in addition to an annual psychosocial assessment, the tenant is not obliged even to speak to a case manager, much less partake of &lt;em >;CUCS&lt;/em>;&#39;s on-site services. This can lead to an awkward dance of case-manager pursuit and tenant avoidance that requires skill and ingenuity on the case manager&#39;s part to break through. “We try to focus on creative engagement, not just sitting there trying to call somebody all the time,” Lipsky told me. “Are you visiting them at their apartment? Are we exhausting our options for how to engage with this person? And then we just keep going. We can be very annoying. Persistence doesn&#39;t always beat resistance, but when you offer consistency I do think eventually people feel that, and it pays off.”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;7s9s9a&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;When the case manager-tenant bond gels successfully, the results can be immediately striking. Johannah Rippe, a white thirty-three-year-old from upstate New York, arrived at 90 Sands after a decade of homelessness that began in the company of her parents, both of whom used heroin and moved with Johannah and her six siblings to New York City when she was twenty-two. (Her father, Curtis Rippe, was stabbed to death last year, a story that made the news.) Rippe began tasting her parents&#39; heroin at age nine. Later, when she was pregnant with the first of the two children she&#39;s had with her long-term partner, Ivan, a doctor insisted that she go off her bipolar medication. She tried using heroin to dull the mental and physical pain, and quickly became addicted. Both of her children were removed from her care in infancy by the Administration for Children&#39;s Services.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;While Rippe and I waited for her lease signing at 90 Sands in February, she showed me a cell-phone picture of herself at twenty-three, bare-armed and fresh-faced, cradling her first newborn. I was stunned by how different she looked ten years later. That day, she was dressed exactly as she had been when I met her at the safe haven where she and Ivan had spent the past two years (because Ivan is Mexican and undocumented, he can&#39;t join Rippe at 90 Sands, or apply for supportive housing, until they&#39;re legally married): both times, she was cocooned inside hoodies with grime-encrusted cuffs, bowed under a thick parka that fell to her knees, a blue Narcan pouch dangling from her neck on a lanyard. It was hard to conjure up the physical person underneath all those layers, and her posture was so radically hunched that she could barely make eye contact. (She has severe back pain, she told me.) Yet three weeks after Rippe&#39;s move, I caught a glimpse of her running through the 90 Sands lobby in black tights, a clingy dress, and platform shoes—a lithe young woman again. When I visited her apartment, she was pressed for time; her new case manager, with whom she was in close and frequent contact, had arranged for her to have a physical exam in the medical suite downstairs. When I commented on her change of attire, she said, “I&#39;m in my house now. I&#39;m not outside 24/7. Of course I don&#39;t need three, four, five coats. I&#39;m in eighty-degree weather—I got my own thermometer!”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;There was another change in Rippe that struck me as we stood together at her front door: her posture had straightened a little. “You can tell, right?” she said, with evident pleasure. “Everybody told me, &#39;You look different now, Johannah.&#39; &#39;Cause I&#39;m not outside all day like this.” She resumed the more exaggerated stoop, which I recognized suddenly as the stance of someone perpetually seated at ground level and looking up at passersby, as Rippe had done for years. The next time I saw her, she and her case manager had arranged for her to enter a methadone program the following day. She is still enrolled there.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Likewise, Iishea saw immediate results after the Kelly paired her with a new case manager, Mariah Jones. Within six weeks of my first visit, she&#39;d begun receiving public assistance and had had an interview for Supplemental Security Income. Under Jones&#39;s management, her housing packet was moving forward. She was also relying on Jones&#39;s help to get her prosthetic leg refitted; the suction part had been lost during a hospital stay, along with her dentures—she&#39;d had no upper teeth for months. When I next saw Iishea, her hair was elaborately curled; her boyfriend had been treating her to a hair-stylist appointment every two weeks. “I&#39;m sure now,” she said of the relationship. “He&#39;s sixty-seven years old, and it&#39;s not like he&#39;s involved in shenanigans and bullshit. He&#39;s more seasoned. He don&#39;t speak a lot of English. English is predominant here, so I help where I can. And then I clean and I cook and I cook and I clean. 。 。 。 He&#39;s just so sloppy. Just like a man, I swear. Ooh, girl, it&#39;s the truth.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Iishea was eager to be photographed for this article. She&#39;d lost her phone and was awaiting a replacement, so I made a date through Jones. We chose April 7th, a Friday when good weather was predicted. I arrived at the Kelly with the photographer and dozens of Krispy Kreme doughnuts and hazelnut coffee, Iishea&#39;s favorites. But she wasn&#39;t there and didn&#39;t show. Everyone at the Kelly was surprised; she&#39;d had her hair done especially for the photo shoot, they told me.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Jones assumed that Iishea was at her boyfriend&#39;s, but Iishea was not seen or heard from in the weeks that followed. Outreach workers visited the corner by her usual bodega repeatedly, without luck. Jones completed the housing packet, making Iishea eligible for a supportive-housing placement through the city&#39;s centralized system (likely not at 90 Sands, which was nearly full and far from Iishea&#39;s beloved Harlem). &lt;em >;Cucs&lt;/em>; undertook what is known as a diligent search: contacting hospitals, jails, and the morgue. The Kelly reluctantly released Iishea&#39;s bed. I went uptown in May and found the small group of buildings where, I was convinced, based on Iishea&#39;s description, her boyfriend lived. I wrote her several identical letters and taped one to every front door, urging her to call me. I visited her bodega, but the man at the counter said that he didn&#39;t know whom I was talking about. The woman at the flower stand recalled someone posting a picture of a missing woman outside the store, but it had come down after a while.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;My shock at Iishea&#39;s disappearance was a testament to how little time I&#39;d spent among people whose lives have been riven, for decades, by violent instability. At 90 Sands, ten people died in the first four months of 2023, eight of them from suspected overdoses. (One of the non-overdoses was a man I&#39;d interviewed in December, David Hoeltzel, a mechanical engineer who taught at Columbia in the nineteen-eighties and nineties and told me that he&#39;d first begun to unravel when he failed to get tenure.) Nearly everyone I knew at 90 Sands had seen a body bag leaving the building. On my way to Russell Reavesbey&#39;s apartment, I passed the door to a unit where a suspected overdose had occurred; it was secured with a neon-green NYPD “Seal for Door of DOA Premises.” Messages had been scrawled onto the seal: “Luv u Sis,” and “Jus know your time spent on this earth was great,” and “A100 u will always be remembered.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Taped just inside Reavesbey&#39;s door was a small xeroxed photograph of a Black man wearing a bandanna: another tenant who had recently overdosed. Given Reavesbey&#39;s tendency to brood over deaths that occurred decades ago, these reminders of mortality were keenly distressing. His mood that day was fiery and changeable; at one point he paused in his pacing and slammed the kitchen counter repeatedly for emphasis: “People died in this building. If the next two people that I know is gonna die of this fentanyl, then I need to be transferred, &#39;cause I can&#39;t stay in this type of situation. I can&#39;t!”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;A small tiger cat with yellow-green eyes lay curled on a folded blanket on the floor, observing Reavesbey&#39;s outburst. He&#39;d adopted her a few weeks earlier from a woman on another floor and was calling her Roxy. Early on, he&#39;d complained to me that Roxy was “unmotivated,” but things had improved between them. “She done got so used to me,” Reavesbey said, his mood softening suddenly when he focussed on his pet. “The more I feed her, the more she got attached to me. She&#39;ll come towards me, and I rub her belly.” He picked up Roxy and cradled her gently. “She&#39;s a one-in-a-million cat,” he said, smiling for the first time that day. “She&#39;s the queen of this apartment.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Signs went up all over the building warning of the risks of fentanyl and xylazine and urging people not to use &lt;em>;any&lt;/em>; drugs while alone. (Fentanyl, a powerful synthetic opioid, can be found in most street drugs, including cocaine products.) Medically prescribed Narcan kits were dispensed door to door and installed in every hallway. “Obviously, people die of overdoses in many contexts,” Eve Goodman, who has worked with &lt;em >;CUCS&lt;/em>; for seventeen years and teaches a training session on death and dying for &lt;em >;CUCS&lt;/em>; employees, told me. “I think that sometimes people move into apartments and feel lonely. And one of the things that help with loneliness is to get high. But when someone moves into a housing program they&#39;re more likely to be using by themselves. When you overdose, that&#39;s that; you can&#39;t give Narcan to yourself.”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;cqadxm&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;At about this time, I ran into Jessica returning to 90 Sands from the post office, where she&#39;d been mailing out online orders. I accompanied her to her apartment, assuming that she was just dropping off her trolley before heading back out for an ophthalmology appointment. As we chatted, she began to prepare a shot of heroin, finally flicking the syringe a couple of times and rising to her feet. “I&#39;ve gotta go in the bathroom for a minute, sweetie,” she said.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;A silence fell on the room in her absence. Her cat whined outside the bathroom door and then shoved it open with his head. I heard Jessica tell him faintly, “Stop.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;More silence, broken only by voices from the hallway and occasional chugs from her aroma dispenser. The cat mewed. I felt rising anxiety. After five minutes I called, “Are you OK?”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;She laughed softly. “Yeah.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I spent the next five minutes reminding myself of where the Narcan kit was and trying to recall how to administer it.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Still doing OK?” I finally asked. To her inaudible answer, I pressed, “What was that?”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“The more I try to rush, the longer it takes.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Twelve minutes after Jessica left the room, the toilet flushed and she reappeared, relaxed but unchanged. “All right,” she said. “I&#39;ve gotta go. Already gonna be late for my appointment.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Mercifully, the overdoses at 90 Sands slowed; of the six fatalities in the building since the end of April, four were from natural causes and the causes of the other two are, as of this writing, undetermined. (One of the latter deaths was that of John Wood, the builder of cave homes.) Spring arrived, the weather warmed, and the mood in the building felt lighter. More people could be found sitting outside on the curved wooden benches that intersperse landscaped flowerbeds in 90 Sands&#39;s public plaza.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;When I visited Reavesbey in May, another tenant had given him a carpeted blue-and-gray house for Roxy, and the cat watched him serenely from her cushy new bower. Reavesbey told me that he wants to train her to dance. He wants her to become a mother. “I have a philosophy about Roxy: Roxy is coming into her own,” he said. So, it would seem, is Reavesbey. “I&#39;m doing good for myself,” he told me. “I pay my rent, food-shop for myself, food-shop for this cat, clean up, sleep, mop, wash the clothes.” His daughters have come with their mother to visit. For a man in his fifties setting up a home for the first time, these are immense accomplishments. In August, both Reavesbey and Speedy signed new two-year leases.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;With all of 90 Sands&#39;s supportive units filled, the gruelling transition is over, leaving Lipsky and her staff with more time to focus on creating community events in the building, all of which are open to every tenant. There have been buffet lunches and board-game sessions and book deliveries from a nearby branch of the Brooklyn Public Library. There are hopes for group haircuts and foot soaks and self-defense classes. Meanwhile, the affordable units are slowly filling up, reducing the over-all proportion of tenants with acute needs. I spoke with the tenants of two affordable units, a young woman and a middle-aged man, both of whom have found living at 90 Sands challenging in the same ways that supportive tenants have. Both plan to stay—in part because of the vigilance of the management and the cleaning staff, and in part because, without an affordable apartment, they would have to leave New York altogether. “In the grand scheme of things,” the woman told me, “you have your own apartment that you can keep clean, that&#39;s near transit. 。 。 。 Those moments of stress can feel like they trump all the good, but they don&#39;t.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;When I interviewed Minogue and Lipsky together, in July, they were energized and optimistic. Minogue likened the ongoing evolution of a building like 90 Sands to a stockpot: “You never use up all the stock, you&#39;re constantly re-adding stuff to it, it has a fire underneath it all the time, and you can never leave it alone a hundred per cent. Things are better, they&#39;re just not done.” Lipsky agreed, adding, “We&#39;re still in that settle phase, and probably will be for at least the next two, three years.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Even in a newly renovated building with panoramic views of New York Harbor, affordable tenants will likely need to embrace the vision and mission of supportive housing embodied in 90 Sands: some three hundred individuals who, for years, slept on stoops, steps, roofs, in stairwells, under scaffolding and under bridges, in abandoned buildings, outside Starbucks, inside Macy&#39;s, freezing through subzero New York winters and sweating on the sidewalk through broiling summers are presently housed. (No unit has been surrendered, although legal proceedings that could lead to eviction are under way for Lopez&#39;s assailant.) Many still live in poverty, often without having finished high school, and are hobbled by disabilities and criminal records that make panhandling a more lucrative job than any other they might conceivably obtain (and getting a full-time job would terminate their benefits and thus their guarantee of housing). Some have problems that can&#39;t easily be solved, particularly after decades of turmoil have erased any memory of a stable baseline, if they ever had one. But it would seem inarguable that they have a better chance of meeting these challenges now, while housed, than they did while they were living on the streets.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“We can end every person&#39;s homelessness. We know how to do it,” Dennis Culhane, the sociologist, told me. For select populations—homeless &lt;em >;AIDS&lt;/em>; patients and homeless veterans—this has already to some extent been done. Culhane helped design the Obama Administration&#39;s veteran homelessness initiative, which, starting in 2009, used a combination of rapid rehousing and supportive housing to achieve, by 2016, an over-all reduction of homelessness among veterans by nearly fifty per cent. “We showed that you could move at scale and dramatically impact the number of people who were homeless in a particular population,” Culhane told me. The budget agreement, which was bipartisan, required an increase in the federal budget for veteran homelessness from some four hundred million to more than a billion dollars in 2016. Those systems, established more than a decade ago, continue to work, according to &lt;em >;HUD&lt;/em>;: the number of homeless veterans dropped by another eleven per cent between 2020 and 2022.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The forces underlying modern homelessness are many and complex, but they boil down to a withdrawal of the federal government&#39;s commitment to providing either affordable housing or a functional safety net for its vulnerable citizens. SSI benefits for disabled Americans are burdensome to apply for and frequently denied, and they often exclude addiction, or addiction-related disabilities like cirrhosis, as qualifying conditions. Even when granted, SSI pays a maximum of about a thousand dollars per month, depending on the region—which, even in its entirety, is only half the median market rent for a studio apartment in New York City. Medicaid under managed care is failing catastrophically to meet Americans&#39; mental-health needs—including those of people suffering from opioid-use disorder who would benefit from medication-assisted treatment, fewer than twenty per cent of whom have received it. Despite measurable progress since the early two-thousands, the number of Americans who fall into homelessness each year exceeds the number who exit from it. Subsidized housing is the answer, nearly everyone seems to agree, though what form it should take is debated. Culhane believes that the pace of building and renovation is too slow to address the problem, and favors rental assistance that individuals could use for apartment shares, or even to stay with family or friends. But states are reluctant to spend this money.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;oirb3v&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Still, lawmakers and citizens who recoil from the expense of ending modern homelessness would do well to ponder the cost of maintaining it: eight and a half billion dollars a year on emergency shelter alone, according to Culhane&#39;s research (based on 2015 data), or about twenty-seven thousand dollars per bed per year—eleven billion and thirty-six thousand in today&#39;s dollars. That eleven-billion-dollar expense doesn&#39;t include, as Culhane reminded me, “the excess use of health care, emergency rooms, EMTs, longer hospitalizations. It&#39;s not counting the impacts on parks, sanitation, police, libraries, education. 。 。 。 There is hardly a public-sector system out there that is not impacted by homelessness.” In a landmark study from 2002, Culhane calculated the cost of chronic street homelessness for a &lt;em>;single&lt;/em>; mentally ill person to be forty thousand dollars a year—about seventy thousand dollars in today&#39;s money. That&#39;s a lot of money to spend on a horrific status quo.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Nobody wants to be confronted with a spectacle of human suffering every time you walk out your door with your kids,” David Giffen, the executive director of New York&#39;s Coalition for the Homeless, told me. “I hate to put it in terms of enlightened self-interest, but if you don&#39;t want somebody sleeping in your subway then let&#39;s put a system in place that provides four walls, a roof, and a bed for that person.” In a country with skyrocketing housing costs and insufficient mental-health care, virtually anyone could end up in that position of need. “It&#39;s not a question of &lt;em>;these people&lt;/em>;,” Giffen said. “These people are us.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In late July, Iishea&#39;s case manager e-mailed to say that there seemed to have been some activity on her EBT card, or food-stamps account. I returned to West Harlem on a sweltering afternoon to look for Iishea again, and this time I managed to find a hair salon on West 116th Street that I thought might be the one where she&#39;d been getting her hair done. Sure enough, a woman who was braiding a customer&#39;s hair inside the salon knew whom I meant. “Ah, Iishea. Wheelchair,” she said in strongly accented English. Then she added, sadly, “She pass away. Long time ago. Overdose.” The news had come from Iishea&#39;s boyfriend, she said, the one who had been paying for her appointments.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Still not satisfied, I proceeded to the buildings where I&#39;d left letters for Iishea two months earlier. I rang all the ground-floor apartment buzzers and managed to find one tenant who identified himself as a former crack user and said that he knew of Iishea&#39;s overdose death “through the grapevine.” He told me which apartment her boyfriend lived in, and I left a letter in Spanish asking him to call me, so that I could find out exactly what had happened. I never heard from him. The Kelly was finally able to confirm with the morgue that Iishea had died on April 6th, the day before our scheduled photo session.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;In a broader sense, I know what happened to Iishea Stone: a luminous and extraordinary woman was failed repeatedly—by her family&#39;s pathologies, by poverty, and by a social safety net that couldn&#39;t seem to catch her. Had Iishea grown up with the advantages I had, she might have accomplished anything. Instead, she suffered acutely and slipped away so invisibly that, thus far, the Kelly does not know what was done with her body. How many Americans are we losing this way? How can we—the wealthiest nation in human history—tolerate those losses? The fact that we can, and do, despite knowing that it&#39;s wrong, is what is meant by the moral cost of homelessness.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;For Jessica, April brought the unthinkable: her aunt Mary, the woman she called her mother and listed as next of kin on her 90 Sands lease, died unexpectedly on the operating table during a lung biopsy. When I visited Jessica a couple of days later, she hadn&#39;t stopped shaking. She had spoken to Mary the night before the biopsy, trying to calm her fears about the procedure. “I woke up at four o&#39;clock, wide awake, and I had a horrible feeling,” she said. “I waited, because I knew she wouldn&#39;t be up at four. I messaged her at seven-thirty, and I was, like, I love you so much. I knew she wasn&#39;t coming home, I knew it.” She sobbed openly as she spoke.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Jessica&#39;s aunt never knew that she had relapsed into heroin after going on methadone a few years ago. “She&#39;s the only person I&#39;ve ever lied to about it in my life,” Jessica told me. “I couldn&#39;t break her heart like that.” But Mary had known about Jessica&#39;s homelessness and was hugely relieved when she moved into 90 Sands. “My cousin said, &#39;She told me she&#39;s so proud of you.&#39; I was, like, I don&#39;t know what for.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Jessica&#39;s cousin had advanced her money for a plane ticket to get to the funeral, which was the following afternoon. She planned to leave before dawn to take the subway to LaGuardia, but was grappling with a logistical problem: she didn&#39;t want to carry heroin on the plane and needed some way to keep from going into withdrawal while she was away. The obvious answer was to carry a sealed dose of methadone, but Troy, her sometime friend at 90 Sands, was demanding sixty dollars for one of his take-home doses. “I&#39;m, like, &#39;Are you fucking for real right now? I&#39;ve given you money all the fucking time, I&#39;ve given you dope, I&#39;ve given you cigarettes, and you&#39;re trying to charge me for methadone.真的吗？&#39; When I get back here, shit&#39;s gonna change,” she resolved. “I&#39;m not talking to none of them no more. I&#39;ll change my number if I have to.” She left without the methadone, and returned, dope-sick, within twenty-four hours.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Changing her life was not as immediate or neat as Jessica had promised herself it would be. After a fight with her dealer&#39;s girlfriend escalated into a fight with the dealer himself, she stopped buying heroin. Her withdrawal was manageable at first; she had tapered down enough that the sickness was bearable. But then illness seized her again; she vomited for days, and developed areas of infection in her legs that opened up into deep wounds. When those began to heal, she was too exhausted to leave her apartment. In mid-June she stopped answering texts, which was so uncharacteristic of her that I grew alarmed and went to 90 Sands, where I asked security to call upstairs on the internal phone to her apartment. She was there; her cell-phone service had been turned off because she was too drained to panhandle and hadn&#39;t paid the bill.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I found her lying on her bed beside the small set of plastic shelves, from which all the drug paraphernalia had been removed. She was noticeably thinner. I asked whether she thought her recovery from heroin would stick this time, when it hadn&#39;t before. She reminded me that, when she&#39;d left jail on methadone, she&#39;d returned to New York with no place to go: “It was wintertime, I didn&#39;t have blankets, I didn&#39;t have anything.” Medley wasn&#39;t her case manager yet, and no organization she contacted could find her a bed. Inevitably, she had rejoined the safety of the homeless drug users she knew and, after holding out briefly, returned to heroin. Now, in her own apartment, the situation was different: “I&#39;m not around nobody.” She had talked to her dealer on the phone a couple of times. “He asked me, &#39;You coming again, Jessica?&#39; ” She demurred, “Uh-uh, I&#39;m sorry, I love you, but I can&#39;t do it. Can&#39;t be around that right now.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Unfortunately, she &lt;em>;was&lt;/em>; still around heroin, and the rash of solitary overdose deaths had encouraged communal use. By the time I saw Jessica two months later, in August, she was using again (albeit on a smaller scale) and had new wounds caused by xylazine-adulterated doses that she said she&#39;d purchased from a dealer living in the building. Still, in the halting realm of opioid recovery a spell of sobriety is an accomplishment—even if, as she&#39;d insisted back in June, it was due less to grit than to sheer exhaustion, even depression, in the wake of her loss. “I just did not have the will power to get out of bed and go outside to try and make money—that&#39;s what it boils down to,” she said. It struck me that what Jessica was describing was grief. Here, inside her clean, quiet, aromatic apartment, she had the luxury of indulging it. “My cousins are, like, &#39;You need to get up and go do something.&#39;不，我不。 You don&#39;t understand. I was homeless on the streets. They can&#39;t grasp how hard it is. I was always outside. I walked ten miles a day, probably. Like, I don&#39;t need to get up.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Jessica is hoping to enroll in a culinary-arts program next semester, and is trying to get bone grafts so that her teeth can be replaced. She has started working with her 90 Sands case manager, and is receiving medical care for her wounds from the on-site doctor. She still intends to get off heroin.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“The wins can be really small at times,” Lipsky reminded me at our last meeting, when I expressed distress over Jessica&#39;s perilous health, without naming her. “You meet people and you see where they are at that current stage, and where they could be. It does take time. And it takes investment, and it takes consistency. It takes trust and belief in that person to get to that point when five, ten years down the line you look back and think, Wow! Look where that person came from.” ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>; &lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/ div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;div>;&lt;div>;&lt;div>;&lt;div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt; /div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 11 Sep 2023 18:06:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[The Mail]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/09/18/letters-from-the-september-18-2023-issue]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-11T10:00:00.000Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;&quot;/>;&lt;meta property=&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;article >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attribute-verso-pattern=&quot;article-body&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;ArticlePageChunks&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;h2>;Branching Off&lt;/h2>;&lt;p >;Kathryn Schulz, in her review of Gunnar Broberg&#39;s biography of Carl Linnaeus, discusses the fact that biologists have changed the classification of many species since Linnaeus&#39;s time (Books, August 21st). But the article omits the central paradigm shift: whereas Linnaeus believed that groups simply reflect similarity, biologists now see them as generally indicating species&#39; ancestral relationships. Thus, scientists no longer count Monera among the kingdoms, because we now recognize that its former subgroups, Archaea and Bacteria—although both consist of single-celled organisms—are only very distantly related to each other; the split between them represents perhaps the deepest surviving fork in the tree of life.&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;&lt;em>;Daniel Weissman&lt;/em>;&lt;br/>;&lt;em>;Associate Professor of Physics&lt;/em>;&lt;br/>;&lt;em>;Emory University&lt;/em>;&lt;br/>;&lt;em>;Atlanta, Ga.&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Schulz quotes Charles Darwin as saying that he looked “at the term &#39;species&#39; as one arbitrarily given, for the sake of convenience, to a set of individuals closely resembling each other.” In this passage from “On the Origin of Species,” Darwin is asserting that a natural group&#39;s taxonomic rank—its status as a species rather than as a genus, class, or variety—is arbitrary. He is not denying that a species is a unique kind of creature, as real as a chemical element. Indeed, only natural selection could explain this “natural arrangement in group under group.” According to Darwin, the branches in the tree of life are real, but a particular branch&#39;s “rank” is not.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;em>;Marc Lange&lt;/em>;&lt;br/>;&lt;em>;Theda Perdue Distinguished Professor of Philosophy&lt;/em>;&lt;br/>;&lt;em>;University of North Carolina&lt;/em>;&lt;br/>;&lt;em>;Chapel Hill, NC&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h2 >;Waste Not&lt;/h2>;&lt;p >;David Owen, in his article about the high percentage of products that are returned, especially those sold by online retailers, highlights the extent of a shocking phenomenon (“There and Back Again,” August 21st). Retailers have seemingly accepted the “free return” policy as the norm. But the costs of added shipping and early disposal represent economic and environmental losses that should be addressed. There is a community seeking to change such practices, under the rubric “zero waste.” A zero-waste policy would place the responsibility for a product and its packaging&#39;s eventual disposal on the producer. There would be a focus on reuse, and on product designs that are more durable, repairable, and recyclable. These measures would not prevent returns, but they would make them less desirable and less harmful.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;em>;Roger Diedrich&lt;/em>;&lt;br/>;&lt;em>;Cypress, Texas&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h2 >;Tragedy on Maui&lt;/h2>;&lt;p >;Elizabeth Kolbert, in her Comment on the Maui wildfires, mentions the introduction of invasive grasses in recent decades as a contributing factor, and interviews a fire ecologist who says that “nothing&#39;s been done since then” (August 28th). Indeed, there was ample warning for these fires. Between 1999 and 2019, twenty-six wildfires occurred in West Maui. Hazard-mitigation plans noted the changing vegetation but ignored the ubiquity of flammable materials in Lahaina. The governments of Hawaii and Maui are a morass of large committees and agencies; some actions they could have taken, but didn&#39;t, include burying electrical lines, requiring more sprinklers, implementing evacuation plans, and maintaining reservoir capacity. By blaming climate change as something inevitable and unstoppable, governments avoid responsibility for preventable disasters.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;&lt;em>;Michael Lindenfeld&lt;/em>;&lt;br/>;&lt;em>;La Jolla, Calif.&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;align-center&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:align-center&quot;>;&lt;p >;•&lt;/p>;&lt;/inline-embed>;&lt;p >;&lt;em>;Letters should be sent with the writer&#39;s name, address, and daytime phone number via e-mail to &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:themail@newyorker.com?Subject=Letters&quot;>;themail@newyorker.com&lt;/a>;.

We live in times of abundant booze, increasingly legal drugs, and technological surveillance. The semi-illicit-thrill industry could use an update. The other day, in the back of a second-floor yoga studio in NoMad, a couple of entrepreneurs were giving it a shot. They were throwing a party celebrating a new establishment called elahni, New York&#39;s first “wellness speakeasy,” which combines a spa with a bar that serves nonalcoholic “adaptogenic tonics.” Unlike a traditional speakeasy, the party wasn&#39;t hush-hush. (Heather Graham was on the invite list.) But there was a doorman, a guy in a peach-colored suit with his arms crossed, who manned the elevator entryway. His task: insure that all guests removed their shoes. “The wood is too gorgeous,” Rima Rabbath, the pixielike co-owner of &lt;em >;SOUK&lt;/em>;, the yoga studio, explained. Nick Rizk, one of elahni&#39;s proprietors, stood nearby with a hand on an unmarked metal door. “Ready?,” he said, and slid it open.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Inside, Rizk, who is thirty years old and wore a black long-sleeved T-shirt, and his business partner, Keane Tan, a baby-faced thirty-one-year-old Australian, guided guests around the windowless four-hundred-square-foot space. They explained that visitors would make their way through the yoga studio and spend ten minutes in elahni&#39;s hundred-and-eighty-degree sauna, followed by a minute or so in one of its two thirty-nine-degree ice baths. They&#39;d repeat the cycle three times. “It&#39;s a forced meditation: your body doesn&#39;t know where to go, except to focus on itself,” Tan said, as Middle Eastern house music pulsed softly. Next, it would be off to the bar for the tonic shots, which are meant to support the body&#39;s hormones. Elahni (which is “inhale” spelled backward) organizes its drinks by “desired end state”: “energized,” “restful,” “grounded,” “ready to mingle.” Rizk, a tech entrepreneur with a master&#39;s in neuroscience, and Tan, a former matcha importer, curated the menu themselves. “We&#39;ve been trying stuff out, saying, &#39;How does it feel?&#39; ” Tan said. “Neither of us has a background in, like, tonics.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The pair met five years ago, at a boutique gym in SoHo. Last fall, they visited &lt;em >;SOUK&lt;/em>; for some yoga. “Nick sensed a Lebanese vibe,” Tan said. (Rizk&#39;s mother is from Lebanon.) Rabbath, the co-owner, confirmed that she&#39;d been born in Lebanon, too. She told them about a spare twenty-by-twenty space that she was struggling to put to use. A partnership was born. Rizk&#39;s father, an architect, oversaw the intensive four-month construction that followed. “I gained a son,” the elder Rizk said, gesturing toward Tan. The Rizks&#39; corgi, Mishmush, panted at Tan&#39;s side. “I gained a dog,” he said.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;In the studio&#39;s main space, fit, sleekly dressed partygoers sipped boxed water and rosé beneath a disco ball. A dj, who&#39;d been granted a footwear exemption (he and his Brooks sneakers were confined to a yoga mat), spun tunes. Guests&#39; backless dresses revealed cupping bruises. Rizk&#39;s mother, Amal—“the most incredible Lebanese chef in the universe,” Rabbath announced—had prepared a lavish dinner buffet. Two partygoers, Leah Kreitz and her husband, Gabe Quiroga, were curious about elahni&#39;s price point. (A session costs fifty-five dollars.) Had they ever tried adaptogenic tonics? Kreitz wasn&#39;t sure. “We live in Brooklyn, so . 。 ”。 she said, and shrugged.&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;a data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a26775&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a26775&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;“In this corner a man who describes everything as &#39;Orwellian.

Since opening, they had hosted bachelorette parties, birthday celebrations, and office team-building outings. “We&#39;ve been having the real speakeasy experience,” Tan said. “One girl tried to come up in the service elevator.” Just then, a bespectacled sales rep named Carlos Oliva arrived, in khaki jeans, to discuss samples of a negative-ion drink. Rizk invited him to join the session.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Oliva had no swim trunks (“We should sell some,” Tan said), and he said he was on his way to a job interview, but that he was game. He emerged from the locker room a few minutes later, in black boxer briefs. Tan distributed paper cups of electrolyte water and led the group to the sauna, for the first ten-minute stint. “We had a timer display, but then we noticed everyone was just looking at the clock,” he said. Next came the one-minute ice bath. “There&#39;s a lot of bro culture around cold plunges,” Rizk said. “We&#39;re trying to make it more mindful.” Oliva went wide-eyed and stiff upon entry. “You should have a camera, like roller coasters,” he suggested.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The rounds carried on. Feet tingled, fingers pulsed, capillaries dilated and danced. After the last plunge, Tan slipped behind the bar to pour four shots of a plum-colored tonic. He warned that it contained traces of kratom, an herb with some opioid properties. “We call it &#39;calm focus,&#39; ” Tan said. “The company calls it a &#39;heart opener.&#39; ” The shots were downed. A Dalí-style melting clock that hung from a bookshelf read quarter to nine. Carlos changed back into his work wear, wet hair neatly re-combed, and set off for the interview. He said he no longer cared if he got the job. ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;58e46mb&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;y5o1hf&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 11 Sep 2023 18:06:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Would Steven Soderbergh Kill Baby Facebook?]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/09/18/would-steven-soderbergh-kill-baby-facebook]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-11T10:00:00.000Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64fb8e38829f3db5a96dc987/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/230918_r42965illuweb-site.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;article >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attribute-verso-pattern=&quot;article-body&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;ArticlePageChunks&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;At the Brandy Library, in Tribeca, a man in suspenders led Steven Soderbergh down a spiral staircase, into an amber-lit VIP lounge. Soderbergh, who calls the bar his “satellite office” (his real office is down the street), ordered “the usual.” The usual was singani, a Bolivian spirit made with Muscat of Alexandria grapes that are grown in the Andes, at an altitude of six thousand feet. Soderbergh first tasted it in 2007, while directing “Che,” and learned that it had never been exported from Bolivia. In 2014, he founded his own brand, Singani 63, and spent eight years on a quest to bring it to market. The spirit finally received US government recognition this past winter.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Don&#39;t go into the booze business,” Soderbergh warned, as the server poured him a glass. “I wonder why I did. Part of it was to be able to &lt;em>;get&lt;/em>; it, because otherwise you&#39;d have to have people buy it and send it to you.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Dread seems to come easily to Soderbergh, whose œuvre has probed the pleasures and the agonies of voyeurism (“sex, lies, and videotape”), stripping (“Magic Mike”), and Liberace (“Behind the Candelabra”). In 2020—a dread-filled year—he was reading the nonfiction book “Evil Geniuses: The Unmaking of America,” about the decades-long effort of plutocrats and right-wing intellectuals (the Koch brothers, Charles Murray) to rig the economy. “Like everybody, I was in a steady state of feeling overwhelmed by everything,” Soderbergh, who wore a blazer and his signature black-rimmed glasses, recalled. “It&#39;s always been my theory that this can all turn into &#39;Mad Max&#39; a lot faster than people think.” Naturally, he contacted the book&#39;s author, Kurt Andersen, and they turned it into a comedy.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The result is “Command Z,” a sci-fi series that Soderbergh self-funded and released independently this summer, available on the Web site commandzseries.com, in eight bite-size episodes. Michael Cera plays a billionaire who has blown himself up on his way to Mars and appears in the dystopian year 2053 as an AI upload. (Shades of the would-be cage-match combatants Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk.) His digital double sends a trio of employees on a mission to save the world by travelling back to 2023 and influencing ultra-powerful jerks to make better decisions. Their method of time travel: entering a wormhole inside a laundry dryer while listening to “Theme from Mahogany.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The fictional billionaires include a fossil-fuel mogul and the founder of a private-equity firm—the type of guys who are “infatuated with their own brilliance and the affirmation of that brilliance by having a quarter-trillion dollars,” Andersen, who sat beside Soderbergh with a glass of Merlot, said. Neither man has had close experience with such people. Andersen knows Warren Buffett—they&#39;re both from Omaha—but views him as the rare benevolent billionaire. Soderbergh has worked with an evil non-billionaire, Harvey Weinstein, and plenty of megastars—“Clooney told this story about getting elbowed in the mouth in Rome by somebody trying to get to Brad”—but Hollywood fame “doesn&#39;t typically result in the Federalist Society,” he said.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Still, the thought experiment was tempting. Given the opportunity to go back in time, how would they influence our future billionaire overlords? Let&#39;s say: Zuckerberg, 2004, Harvard University. “Get him laid more,” Andersen spitballed.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“It&#39;s axiomatic,” Soderbergh said. “If he had the same approach to relationships that I do, that business couldn&#39;t have scaled in the way it scaled. I would have probably smothered it as soon as I saw the implications of what it could do.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;How about Musk, in his South African adolescence? Andersen proposed enrolling teen Elon in an institute to teach him “that free speech is not just being an asshole and a troll and saying whatever you want and, like, lolz.” The Koch brothers? “Just kill them,” Andersen joked.唐纳德·特朗普？ “His father was a monster,” Andersen reasoned. “He would be better today if I went back in time to 1946 and raised him as my own.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;How would they use the time machine on themselves? Andersen said that he would urge himself to visit his mother in Omaha more often before she died: “I don&#39;t think it would have any bad unintended consequences—unless my plane went down. That would be tragic.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Soderbergh said that he&#39;d pondered the question on the walk to the bar. “It wouldn&#39;t work,” he said, clutching his second glass of singani. “First of all, if it was my voice, I wouldn&#39;t trust it at all. Secondly, I&#39;ve gotten very good advice from people whom I &lt;em>;do&lt;/em>; trust that I have completely ignored.” Would he advise himself to stay out of the Bolivian-booze trade? “No, and I think it comes back to issues of intention, why you do things,” he said. “But, boy, it&#39;s extremely competitive in ways that I didn&#39;t understand, as somebody who used to just walk into a bar and order a drink. What was happening on that backbar was invisible to me. And now it&#39;s ruined.” ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;i0j9d&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;qjsvjy&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 11 Sep 2023 18:06:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[How Emily Wilson Made Homer Modern]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/09/18/emily-wilson-profile]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-11T10:00:00.000Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64fa4bd0898637fa1cfe84ef/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/230918_r42942.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;article >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attribute-verso-pattern=&quot;article-body&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;ArticlePageChunks&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;figure data-testid=&quot;IframeEmbed&quot; >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;IframeEmbedContainer&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;iframe height=&quot;90&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; sandbox=&quot;allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups&quot; title=&quot;Embedded Frame&quot; data-src=&quot;https://audm.herokuapp.com/player-embed?pub=newyorker&amp;amp;articleID=64f8954abeacd4c1a93b9246&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay *; encrypted-media *; clipboard-write; autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture&quot;>;&lt;/iframe>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;p >;Some three millennia ago, a blind bard whose name in ancient Greek means “hostage” is said to have composed two masterpieces of oral poetry that still speak to us. The Iliad&#39;s subject is death, and the Odyssey&#39;s is survival. Both plumb the male psyche and women&#39;s enthrallment to its bravado. “Tell the old story for our modern times,” Homer entreats his muse, in the Odyssey&#39;s first stanza. The translator Emily Wilson took him at his word. Her radically plainspoken Odyssey, the first in English by a woman, was published six years ago. Her Iliad will be published in two weeks.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;On a recent summer evening, Wilson surveyed the view from a precipice above Polis Bay, in the quiet village of Stavros, on the northwest coast of Ithaca. A shrine in the town square shows the floor plan of a ruin, not far away, that may be the palace of Odysseus. She pointed to a crescent beach five hundred feet below, slung like a hammock between two mountains. The cave at its far end was a site of Mycenaean goddess worship, and relics recovered from it include a set of bronze tripods which fit Homer&#39;s description of gifts that Odysseus received from the Phaeacians. “We&#39;ll swim there,” she said.&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Wilson is fifty-one, with expressive features that radiate alertness, and a lithe, sinewy physique—more Hermes than Hera. She set a brisk pace on our hike down the mountain. As I watched from the deserted beach, she plunged into the water and headed for the cave with rhythmic strokes. The bay was glassy until a breeze ruffled its surface with purple shadows, suddenly making sense of Homer&#39;s “wine-dark sea.” It was Wilson&#39;s first visit to Ithaca. “I felt the presence in that sea of protective deities,” she told me later, though she hastened to add that, elsewhere in Greece, unprotected migrants were drowning in it.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;On our way to Stavros, we&#39;d passed cultivated valleys and hillsides terraced with vineyards and olive trees. But the landscape, like Homer&#39;s prosody, is mostly rugged and austere. (Ithaca is “only fit for goats,” the poet tells us.) It wasn&#39;t hard for Wilson to imagine the tar-blackened ships that Odysseus&#39; father beached in its secluded coves, and the treasure he plundered stowed in its mountain grottoes. “Old Laertes was basically a pirate,” she said fondly.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;One of the grottoes is known as Eumaeus&#39; Cave, in honor of the faithful swineherd who tended Odysseus&#39; pigs and is said (improbably, given the terrain) to have fattened them on acorns there. Following Athena&#39;s directions, we found it near the spring of Arethusa, whose black waters are alleged to be a mother&#39;s tears for her dead son.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;After a vertiginous climb through thorny underbrush, Wilson and I reached a keyhole of rock in the cliff and slid down the moss-slimed rocks at its entrance into a humid cavern that looks like a rotunda some Titan sheared in half. She had sprinted ahead of me, and when I caught up with her she was sitting on a boulder, dwarfed by her surroundings. The air hummed with birdsong, and with the bells of the mountain goats that forage in the highlands. “That sound takes you straight back to Homer,” she said.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;In bringing Homer back from antiquity, Wilson also had to bridge the chasm of time that has elapsed in English literature since the first full translation of the Odyssey: George Chapman&#39;s, in 1616. But, she cautioned, “you can&#39;t and shouldn&#39;t try to make all that history—layer upon layer—visible in the text. My goal was to evoke an experience like the original, using the language of the people who will read it.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The epics were originally performed by itinerant singers who roamed ancient Greece, entertaining guests at social gatherings. Travel inflected their speech with a mixture of dialects that they patched into their recitals. In classical Athens, the singers were known as &lt;em>;rhapsodes&lt;/em>;, from the verb meaning “to sew songs together.” Their diction was stately, but audiences of every class and age listened raptly to Homer&#39;s graphic imagery and impassioned dialogue, scored to a propulsive beat. Wilson&#39;s ambitious project of the past decade has been to re-democratize both the poetry and its audience. Her “folk poetics,” as she calls them, are a reproach to predecessors who have “turned a great poem into a hard one,” or into a poem of their own. She rejects historical reënactments that “archaicize” Homer&#39;s diction—“he didn&#39;t sound archaic to the Greeks”—and modern renovations that expand his footage. The opening of Robert Fagles&#39;s widely admired Odyssey, she points out, uses two English words for every Greek one. Her own translation hews strictly to the original line count, and it retains the power of a storyteller&#39;s voice to fix itself in your memory. “I write for the body,” she told me.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;As a brotherhood of nomads, the bards must have imbued their songs with a yearning for &lt;em>;nostos:&lt;/em>; the homecoming that crowns a hero&#39;s journey. Homer keeps us in suspense about Odysseus&#39; &lt;em>;nostos&lt;/em>;. He left Ithaca unwillingly to fight the Trojans and spent his youth at war. His return is disrupted by misfortunes, but “dreadful, beautiful, divine” Calypso rescues him from the sea. After seven years of captivity, her charms have palled. When Zeus finally orders her to set him free, she looks for him on her island&#39;s shore:&lt;/p>;&lt;blockquote >;&lt;div >;&lt;p>;His eyes were always&lt;br/>;tearful; he wept his sweet life away, in longing&lt;br/>;to go back home, since she no longer pleased him.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/blockquote>;&lt;p >;A jealous goddess is dangerous, as anyone would know who had languished for ten years at Troy:&lt;/p>;&lt;blockquote >;&lt;div >;&lt;p>;So Odysseus, with tact,&lt;br/>;said, “Do not be enraged at me, great goddess.&lt;br/>;You are quite right. I know my modest wife&lt;br/>;Penelope could never match your beauty. 。 。 .&lt;br/>;But even so, I want to go back home.”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/blockquote>;&lt;p >;Odysseus knows how to massage an ego; that was his role in the fractious Greek camp. He&#39;s also the con man who thinks up the Trojan horse. Homer introduces him with the adjective &lt;em>;polytropos&lt;/em>;—literally, “of many turns.” Previous translators have called him “shifty,” “cunning,” and a hundred other things. After grappling with the alternatives, Wilson chose “complicated,” hoping also to convey the sense of “problematic.” Her first sentence—“Tell me about a complicated man”—instantly makes him our familiar: that charismatic prince who&#39;s too impossible to live with and too desirable to live without.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Part of Odysseus&#39; appeal, not least to modern writers, is that he redefines heroism as imagination. “You love fiction,” Athena teases him. The decade of his odyssey passes like a dream, as episodes of hardship and violence alternate with voluptuous idylls. And the mind games he plays to outwit his captors—lusty nymphs, ravenous cannibals, vengeful gods—have, Wilson notes, “a &#39;meta&#39; element that&#39;s about language and storytelling.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The Iliad feels suffocating by comparison. Its central protagonist, the demigod Achilles, is problematic without being complicated. His “cataclysmic wrath” fuels a story that begins in medias res—not with Paris&#39; abduction of Helen, or the massing of an invasion force, but at the end of a nine-year stalemate, with the demoralized Greeks camped on the Trojan coast and the Trojans trapped in their impregnable city. The action is compressed into about six weeks, whose grinding carnage would numb your senses if Homer&#39;s poetry didn&#39;t keep stirring them. Yet the Iliad&#39;s greatness is inseparable from its claustrophobia. Against a background of blight and bleakness, the characters dazzle us with their vivid idiosyncrasy. Perhaps even more than Odysseus, they&#39;re our familiars: beleaguered humans in tragically stressed relationships, at the mercy of fate.&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot;

The priest offers to ransom her with a priceless treasure, which Agamemnon spurns rudely, and Apollo punishes this sacrilege with a plague. Only after the Greek armies have been decimated does their general relent and send Chryseis home. But then he consoles himself by mortally offending his greatest warrior: he confiscates Achilles&#39; trophy from an earlier looting spree, “fresh-faced Briseis.” And with that puerile quarrel between stubborn warlords over the right to own and to rape a girl, Western literature begins.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;n8tmh&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;While Wilson was contemplating the Greeks sickening in their camp, and the Trojans caged behind their city walls, the plague of &lt;em >;Covid&lt;/em>; forced her family of five into lockdown. She didn&#39;t want to push the analogy (“I never thought, &#39;Oh, no—Achilles has to order online groceries&#39; ”), but she was conscious of both how volatile confinement can be and how primal the need for company becomes. “You can either rage at the people you&#39;re stuck with or grow more devoted,” she said.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Wilson teaches classics and comparative literature at the University of Pennsylvania and lives near the campus in a rambling old house that she shares with her partner of nine years, David Foreman, an administrator at Swarthmore, and her two school-age daughters, Psyche and Freya. (Her eldest daughter, Imogen, is now in college.) When we met last May, she greeted me at her door in running clothes. I was surprised first by her youthfulness, then by the luxuriance of her tattoos. “I didn&#39;t used to read as a tattoo person,” she told me, as we settled on the deck outside her bedroom, which is painted Aegean blue. “When you get tattooed in places that show, it changes your identity.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Wilson&#39;s tattoos became visible as she worked on the Iliad. They inscribe her closest relationships: with her children; Foreman; her late mother; her younger sister Bee Wilson, the noted British food writer; plus a pantheon of Greek deities and creatures sacred to them. The birds and flowers are emblems of a tender heart, while the armory of spiky weapons—a spear and a bow on her calves, the thunderclouds of Zeus on her shoulder—are badges of a fighting spirit.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;That afternoon, Wilson took me for a walk through a neighborhood of abandoned factories, then along the banks of the Schuylkill River, crossing wild meadows to a glade, a route she&#39;d chosen for its “Iliadic contrast of beauty and desolation.” Her Iliad won&#39;t be the first by a woman, but she considers “the first-woman thing” a sexist distraction: “It slights the many brilliant female scholars who&#39;ve worked on the poems. And no one mentions the gender of the men.” What she didn&#39;t say, though her followers do (the flaws and merits of her Odyssey have been vehemently debated on social media), is that it slights her translations&#39; real singularity.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“The ancient Greeks teach one to be modern,” the poet and classicist AE Stallings observed to me. “They taught that to me and to Emily. It was time to strip away all the mannered layers—the tarnish of centuries—and she does that. Her translations have the freshness of the sky after a storm. Their briskness and simplicity are faithful to the oral tradition, and she brings the poems to a new generation, which struggles to read harder texts and wants clarity.” Wilson feels an acute, almost maternal sense of duty to those lay readers: “They need to trust that I&#39;m telling them the truth, both about the language and the psychology. There are no lazy ways to do it.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;On rare occasions in her Iliad, a word would jar me: “flirty,” “flabbergasted,” “inappropriate.” Or a slangy outburst made me laugh at a dramatic moment: “Stop! You are acting crazy, Menelaus!” But that line is worth pausing to consider precisely because none of Wilson&#39;s predecessors would have written it. Among the notable translations of the past century—by Fagles, Robert Fitzgerald, Richmond Lattimore, Peter Green, Caroline Alexander, Stanley Lombardo, Robert Graves (who pivots from prose to poetry to highlight dramatic moments; there&#39;s a lot of mansplaining in Homerdom)—each has its strengths. Their authors are united in presuming that readers will be “improved,” as pious critics used to say, by their encounter with Homer. But Wilson reminds us that a great storyteller conceived the poems as entertainment. Her language is so vitally urgent that even the Iliad&#39;s endless battle scenes feel, to use an un-Homeric simile, like listening to the Super Bowl on car radio. Stallings said, “Does Emily&#39;s clarity betray that element of the epic register that Matthew Arnold calls &#39;nobility&#39;? Some critics think a certain grandeur is missing. But every translation is a compromise, even a great one.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Wilson&#39;s mother, Katherine Duncan-Jones, was an eminent scholar of Elizabethan literature who died in October of complications from Alzheimer&#39;s. Her father is AN Wilson, the prolific English writer whose subjects as a biographer include Jesus, Darwin, Tolstoy, Milton, Hitler, and Queen Victoria. When I spoke with him in June, at the British Library, he was researching a life of Goethe. His latest book, “Confessions: A Life of Failed Promises,” is the memoir of a writer&#39;s triumphs and travails. Among the latter, his first marriage set the high-water mark.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The Wilsons met at Oxford. Katherine was a teaching fellow, and Andrew was an undergraduate of twenty, a decade her junior. They married hastily in 1971, when she got pregnant with Emily. “Mom did all the housework and cooking and was always apologetic about it,” Wilson said. Andrew Wilson told me that he found talking to his daughter difficult: “Sometimes she was completely mute, and sometimes she would burst into tears.” Even as a little girl, Emily was conscious of her father&#39;s rage at his vassalage to a family, for which she felt he blamed her: “I was the one who had ruined his young life by being born.” For reasons that are a bit inscrutable under the circumstances, the couple had Bee when her sister was two.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The Wilsons lived in poisonous silence, beneath a veneer of civility. (“We had a fatal gift for politeness,” as Andrew put it.) Emily often locked herself in her room, from which she heard Bee sobbing through the wall. “My parents weren&#39;t listeners,” she said, “so it was hard for me to imagine that I could be heard.” Encouraged by her mother, she took refuge in books, and excelled in school, though she refused to say a word in class. Her other sanctuary was a world of fantasy: “For a year or two, I pretended to be a gorilla. I would thrust my lower jaw out, even though it was painful to walk around that way.” Her other alter ego was an orangutan, which referred to itself in the third person. “It felt liberating to speak in another voice,” Wilson told me. “It drove my parents completely crazy, which is also why I did it.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;When Emily was eight, a perceptive teacher saw through her camouflage and cast her as Athena in a school production of the Odyssey. (The headmaster played the Cyclops, and the children relished poking his eye out.) “It was a turning point in my life,” Wilson writes in the notes to her translation. The experience kindled a love of theatre shared by her mother; it also, she suggests, gave her a model of “human and nonhuman” shape-shifting. “Translators have to be chameleons,” she said, “leaping from a green leaf to a brown one.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Both sisters told me that they were, at times, hostages to their mother&#39;s depression, though they never doubted her devotion to them. Their father could be charming, but he played favorites capriciously. “One day you were the scapegoat, the next you were his chosen one,” Bee told me, over lunch in Cambridge. “It was a toxic game which served to teach us that love is conditional.” It also served to cast them as foils. In Bee&#39;s telling, she was the “normal” one who loved comics and television, didn&#39;t cause much trouble, and cleared her plate. Emily was the brooding “genius.” At around fourteen, she stopped eating, then coming to the table altogether, though neither parent commented on her blatant anorexia, even when she was living on apples. “As E got smaller, I got larger,” Bee wrote in a poignant essay on sisters and their eating disorders.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;tsvw34&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Unhappy families tend to spin conflicting narratives, and there would probably be no literature without them. “I found this when I was working on my memoir,” Andrew Wilson said. (His daughters are mentioned in it only in passing.) “It was my version of events, not theirs, about which I won&#39;t comment, except to say that what they may tell you about me is true, or partially, because they felt it.” No one, however, took issue with Emily&#39;s account of the bitter scene that took place on January 1, 1988, when she was sixteen. The Wilsons had gathered for a New Year&#39;s lunch, and they went around the table announcing their resolutions. “My resolution,” their father told them, “is to get a divorce.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Andrew Wilson decamped to London, where he eventually remarried and had a third daughter. Duncan-Jones went on to write “Ungentle Shakespeare,” a biography that reads the Bard&#39;s work deeply but portrays the man as a cad. “Mom knew that great literature is written by imperfect humans,” Wilson said. Her father read “Ungentle Shakespeare” as a swipe at “Ungentle AN”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;When Bee went to boarding school, then to Cambridge, Emily stayed in Oxford to support their mother, “who was devastated for a long time.” She read classics at Balliol and earned a master&#39;s in English literature at Corpus Christi, but by then England “felt like the wrong place for my well-being.” In 1996, she took a blind leap. Knowing nothing about America or about Yale—“I hoped it was by the sea”—she arrived in New Haven to pursue a doctorate. Her marriage to a former fellow graduate student ended shortly after Imogen&#39;s birth. A second union also foundered and was followed by the familiar trials of single motherhood.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Wilson&#39;s thesis became a book: “Mocked with Death,” a treatise on the tragedy of “overliving”—a penal sentence, by age or loss, to the terminal privation of whatever made a life worthwhile. Her mother&#39;s dementia hadn&#39;t set in yet, but she was attracted to writers who have dramatized this “horror”: Sophocles, Euripides, Seneca, Shakespeare, and Milton. “Most of us,” she wrote, “struggle in vain to outlive our own past selves.” That struggle may not be in vain, if the self that survives it is the authentic one. But, Wilson wondered to me, how do you recognize her? “I&#39;m not sure I have a stable identity—or perhaps it only emerges through an engagement with language.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;At lunch, Bee had wanted to show me what one of Emily&#39;s past selves looked like, so she&#39;d brought a family album. In a grainy photograph from the nineteen-seventies, the Wilsons pose in an English garden. The parents—a dapper young fogy with ramrod posture and a soulful, slightly rumpled bluestocking—stand behind two tidy little girls in matching sailor suits. The taller one is refusing to smile. “It&#39;s funny, isn&#39;t it?” Bee said. “Emily escaped to a world where people were free to express anger.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;She was thinking of ancient Greece, but her sister also escaped to an angry new country. Wilson became an American citizen last year, in order “to vote where I live,” and to engage with the political arguments raging around her. Had she not emigrated, she doubts that she would have seen the need for new Homer translations. “Being from two worlds is part of the story,” she said. In that respect, she&#39;s also a dual national of two education systems. Her own élite schooling had come to seem cloistered, shielded by “walls of class” that also insulate some of her students. The ones who went to private schools “don&#39;t doubt that they belong” in a classics program, even if “they have some unlearning to do,” she said. The public-school kids “need more nurturing to feel welcome. As a translator, I was determined to make the whole human experience of the poems accessible to them.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;My first visits with Wilson took place during graduation weekend at Penn, which happened to coincide with Taylor Swift concerts in Philadelphia, so the city was a zoo. Worried that I&#39;d get stuck in traffic, she gave me strict instructions to take the trolley. I shared a car with Swifties in lamé, graduates in mortarboards, and their elders of three generations. Wilson&#39;s chair had been endowed by the College for Women class of 1963 (Penn became coed a decade later), and the alumni who had gathered for their sixty-year reunion would celebrate her at a banquet. Many were the same age as her mother. “Today&#39;s her birthday,” she said quietly. “She would have been eighty-two.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;When I asked Wilson about the evening&#39;s dress code, she apologized for having “no idea.” But she typically wears something talismanic when she performs. For her readings of the Odyssey, it was often a sequinned owl T-shirt that channelled Athena. (Homer, she notes, has an eye “for things that sparkle.”) Athena is a shape-shifting goddess. She has the power to make herself invisible, and at luminous moments in Wilson&#39;s translations, especially private ones between foes or lovers, so does Wilson. Those exchanges are often monosyllabic and charged with unspoken feeling. Her aim, she said, was “to give the characters breathing room for their ambiguities.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;That evening, her sandals paid homage to Achilles&#39; mother, “silver-footed Thetis”—a daughter of the sea god Nereus, who was forced to marry King Peleus of Phthia, after he had raped her with the gods&#39; connivance. Thetis is a tutelary spirit for Wilson: “I&#39;ve come to see the Iliad as a poem about the pain of a goddess mother who adores her mortal child and can&#39;t protect him. The theme of a mother&#39;s tragic love structures the whole poem. But that anguish teaches you a hard truth: you can&#39;t prevent your children from ever being hurt.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The banquet was held at the Penn library, and we got there early, so that Wilson could review her notes in a quiet corner. As the guests drifted in for cocktails, a few came over to introduce themselves. One regretted that she&#39;d never studied Greek. Another suggested that the Iliad was ripe material for “a rap musical like &#39;Hamilton,&#39; ” and Wilson nodded politely. As a jazz group played oldies, her co-speaker, Stuart Weitzman, checked out her footwear. “I can see you&#39;re a lady who&#39;s into comfort,” he said. Weitzman, a Penn megadonor, is a &#39;63 graduate of Wharton who made a fortune in the shoe business. “I should really have planned a talk around various characters tying on their sandals,” Wilson told me later. “They abound. But I wanted to read a violent slaughter passage.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Diffidence is Wilson&#39;s default mode, the legacy of a childhood spent biting her tongue, but her ferocity emerges onstage. “I think there&#39;s a tension,” she told me, “or at least for many people a surprise, in the gap between my mostly shy persona and the intensity of emotion I try to express in performance.” Her sonorous voice gives ancient Greek the rumble of a cataract, though she also brings an impious verve to passages of dialogue. In a video I watched online, Penelope might have been Lady Chatterley and gruff Odysseus her sexy gamekeeper.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Some of Wilson&#39;s YouTube readings have an edge of zaniness; she pulls faces and changes character with comic props—a cardboard crown, cat ears, a dishevelled wig. But that night, dressed sombrely in black lace, she recited one of the Iliad&#39;s most heartrending passages. The gods have been intriguing furiously. Thetis begs Zeus to avenge her son&#39;s honor, although the plan he hatches will also fulfill the prophecy that torments her: Achilles can choose to either die young as a hero or live to an obscure old age.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;ync9v&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;As the story unfolds, Agamemnon is tricked into thinking that he can win the war without his greatest fighter. The Trojans&#39; champion—Hector, King Priam&#39;s son—makes the most of this advantage, without knowing it&#39;s a ploy. But a wary seer warns him to seek Athena&#39;s favor, so he leaves the gory plain to organize a sacrifice. Back in the city (briefly, he hopes), he finds his wife, Andromache, watching the war from the battlements with a nurse cradling their infant. In the passage that Wilson read, she grasps his hand and implores him:&lt;/p>;&lt;blockquote >;&lt;div >;&lt;p>;What are you doing, Hector? You strange man!&lt;br/>;Your will to fight will kill you! Do you feel&lt;br/>;no pity for your little baby son,&lt;br/>;or my unhappiness, my life of loss?&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/blockquote>;&lt;p >;Achilles, she reminds him, raided her father&#39;s kingdom, killing him and her seven brothers and enslaving their mother. Hector is torn. If he stays behind on the walls, he can defend the citadel. But the supreme imperative of the noble warriors on both sides—Achilles, Odysseus, Ajax, Aeneas, Sarpedon, Patroclus, and even foppish Paris—is, as Hector exhorts his fighters, to “be men.” A man is someone who courts death for glory, hoping that his deeds will be immortalized by a poet. (This worked out for all of the above.)&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Hector tells Andromache, “No one matters more to me than you.” Yet he offers her no comfort:&lt;/p>;&lt;blockquote >;&lt;div >;&lt;p>;One day some bronze-armed Greek will capture you,&lt;br/>;and you will weep, deprived of all your freedom. 。 。 .&lt;br/>;But as for me, I hope I will be dead,&lt;br/>;and lying underneath a pile of earth,&lt;br/>;so that I do not have to hear your screams&lt;br/>;or watch when they are dragging you away.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/blockquote>;&lt;p >;Hector routs the besiegers and sets fire to their ships. The desperate Greeks throw every man they have into the field. While Achilles sulks in his tent, his beloved comrade, Patroclus, who shares his bed, bravely joins the battle in Achilles&#39; armor. This imposture cows the enemy, but Hector slays Patroclus anyway, sealing everyone&#39;s fate. Maddened by grief and rage, “the best of all the Greeks” butchers the Trojans and seizes twelve of their young boys to sacrifice on Patroclus&#39; funeral pyre. He spears Hector through his neck, then drags the corpse around the city walls until old King Priam abases himself to beg for its return. The poem ends with the laments of three royal women—Helen, Hecuba, and Andromache—whose losses, Wilson writes, “can never be recuperated,” except in the retelling.&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot;

But I also had a dutiful Hector self, doomed by compliance.” I told her that I thought Hector&#39;s speech to Andromache, with its vision of her degradation, was tinged with sadism, but she disagreed: “Brusqueness is often a mark of fear. You push people away when you worry that you need them too much.” And it rankles her that men whom she considers self-appointed guardians of the Western canon have questioned a woman&#39;s fitness to do Homer justice. “Any woman who has lived with male rage at close range has a better chance of understanding the vulnerability that fuels it than your average bro. She learns firsthand how the ways in which men are damaged determine their need to wreak damage on others.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;This insight, and the lucidity Wilson brings to it, may be the greatest revelation of her Iliad. The poem&#39;s machismo has often bored or estranged me, and, in more grandiloquent translations, its heroes&#39; mindless bloodlust obscured the pathos of boys and men who are shamed literally to death by weaknesses that they&#39;ve been bred to suppress. Her plainsong conveys the tragedy of their bravado, and, listening to her voice, I felt it for the first time.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I met Wilson in Athens before we left for Ithaca. The city, in late June, was more crowded than Philly had been, and considerably hotter. One morning, we hiked up to the Acropolis, but the wait for tickets was two hours in the sun, so we hiked back down. Over coffee in a little square, I told her about a vintage shop near my hotel. She was delighted by the prospect of taking her girls there. Finding a treasure in a thrift store, she said, gives her a sense of accomplishment akin to “what feels so satisfying in translation. Working within strict constraints like syntax and meter is like digging out the gem from a donation bin.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Wilson translated Homer into Shakespeare&#39;s meter—an iambic five-foot line, natural to an Anglophone&#39;s ear. She tuned her text like an instrument by reciting it aloud. But she avoided reading her predecessors, who suffered, in her opinion, from reading one another. None of them, she said, felt “particularly sacred, beyond Pope and Chapman, and that&#39;s because they are both in very different ways great poets.” In writing for the body, she searched not only for the most visceral equivalent of every Greek word but for the least slanted one. Toward the end of the Odyssey, the hero&#39;s son, Telemachus, proves that he has become a man by hanging twelve of his mother&#39;s serving women, who have slept with the suitors besieging her. Most translators, Wilson writes, describe them as “sluts” or “whores,” terms that don&#39;t figure in the Greek. Instead, she calls them what Homer does: “slaves,” or, in an echo of plantation culture which felt apt to her, “house girls.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Wilson&#39;s translations are the first in English to jettison slurs or euphemisms that mask the abjection of women in a society where a goal of war, according to the Iliad, was to rob men of their women, and where female captives of every rank were trafficked for sex and domestic labor. (Boys were, too.) Yet she isn&#39;t aiming to generate outrage at the sexual politics of a Bronze Age patriarchy: “It&#39;s too easy.” To the degree that she&#39;s outraged, it&#39;s by the sexual politics of her vocation. “The &#39;faithful&#39; translation,” she writes, is a “gendered metaphor.” It presupposes a wife-like helpmeet whose work is subordinate to that of “a male-authored original.” To some of her critics, especially the trolls on Twitter, Wilson&#39;s “wokeness” perverts Homer&#39;s world view. In her own view, the biases of previous translators have distorted Homer&#39;s “experiential truth.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Homer&#39;s goddesses are thrilling models of female power. Aphrodite takes her pleasure where she finds it (everywhere). Semi-divine Helen, Zeus&#39; daughter, has a witchy seventh sense, a ventriloquist&#39;s voice, and a pharmacy of magic potions. In Wilson&#39;s view, “Nothing beats Hera, dressing up with super-chic earrings and skin creams to mess with Zeus&#39; plans.” (Her craftiness evokes a conjugal eye roll: “She always thwarts whatever I decree.”) But the poems&#39; mortal women are subject to the dictates of their husbands and fathers, and even, like Penelope, of their barely postadolescent sons. None of them challenge that convention, yet Wilson is alert to the ambivalence in their stoicism. Where Andromache&#39;s is explicit, Penelope&#39;s is opaque. (Her name means “veil over the face.”) “Is Penelope really glad to see her husband after twenty years?” Wilson asked me. Yes, but her translation of their reunion gives us a moment to wonder:&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;riobsi&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;blockquote >;&lt;div >;&lt;p>;She crossed the threshold&lt;br/>;and sat across from him beside the wall,&lt;br/>;in firelight. He sat beside the pillar,&lt;br/>;and kept his eyes down, waiting to find out&lt;br/>;whether the woman who had once shared his bed&lt;br/>;would speak to him. She sat in silence, stunned.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/blockquote>;&lt;p >;After coffee, I went prospecting for gems at the National Archaeological Museum. Its most famous artifact is a funeral mask of hammered gold leaf that Heinrich Schliemann, the German archeologist, found in what he believed to be Agamemnon&#39;s tomb at Mycenae. The mask, from the sixteenth century BCE, predates the war, if there was one, by about three hundred years, but it&#39;s the haunting likeness of an old king with an archaic smile, and, whatever terrible crimes he succumbed to or committed, he seems to be at peace.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The ancient gold in the vitrines reminded me of a passage from Wilson&#39;s introduction to the Odyssey. Helen and her husband, Menelaus, she notes wryly, “seem to have suffered no obvious ill effects from her escapade—beyond the fact that so many people . 。 。 died as a result.” Their marriage, she concludes, might have been cemented by a mutual appreciation for “wonderful consumer goods.” They surely would have coveted the goods that were on display: exquisitely wrought diadems, tripods, wine cups, sword hilts, and jewelry, the likes of which Homer inventories with the concupiscence of a Sotheby&#39;s catalogue.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;If you learn one thing from the Iliad, it&#39;s that the greed for stuff, the drive for sex, the fear of death, the bonds of love, the pull of home, the glamour of fame, plus all the insecurities—especially about virility—that generate violence in the world are still the same. I will confess that, in the next gallery, I tarried for longer than was strictly seemly at the statue of Paris—a monumental nude youth with surely the most beautiful face ever sculpted. Of course Helen eloped with him. Abduction, my foot.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;When Odysseus at last reaches Ithaca, he doesn&#39;t recognize the island. Athena has shrouded it in mist to buy him some time for plotting his revenge before he confronts the suitors. Once she unveils the landscape, Odysseus, elated, knows just where he is: in a bay like Polis, shaded by a wooded mountain. A “cave sacred to nymphs” lies at one end of the beach, and that is where they hide his treasure—the Phaeacians&#39; “heroic gifts of bronze.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;On Ithaca, Wilson and I often crossed paths with mountain goats, whose bleating kids rooted at their udders, but we never met a goatherd. “They&#39;re all off composing poetry,” she said. We never met a soul, in fact. It was as if the gods had decided to reward her with a private tour of their haunts.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;To reach the palace of Odysseus, we set out from Stavros a little before dusk, when the heat had abated. About a mile from the village, on a steep mountain road, we found a sign that vaguely pointed toward the “School of Homer.” Turning onto a rocky path, we climbed for another twenty minutes until an ancient flight of steps delivered us to a plateau that is one of the island&#39;s strategic high points. In the distance, we could see Afáles Bay and, beyond it, the Ionian Sea shimmering in a violet haze.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Schliemann poked around this acropolis in the mid-nineteenth century, and many archeologists have followed him. The existence of the palace has been disputed for millennia, and alternative locations have been proposed in Cephalonia, Paxos, Sicily, the Baltic, southwestern Spain, and elsewhere on Ithaca, but the School of Homer is a contender. Its ruins were once a complex of buildings pieced together from massive blocks of limestone, and sited so that ships or strangers were visible as they approached. Whoever lived here would have given those strangers a cordial welcome, according to &lt;em>;xenia&lt;/em>;—the sacred code of Greek hospitality, whose breach by Paris (it was bad form to run off with your hostess) led to the Trojan War.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;If these are indeed the ruins of the palace, they don&#39;t fit the Odyssey&#39;s descriptions of a royal seat with a vast banquet hall, a storeroom secured by “dazzling double doors,” and an upper story where Penelope worked at her loom and hid herself from the rowdy suitors. A mosaic floor in one of the roofless chambers looked Roman. (Rome occupied Greece for hundreds of years.) In the seventeenth century, some of the stone was used to erect a church, dedicated to St. Athanasios. The School of Homer got its name in English some two hundred years ago, from a local priest who showed the site to a British classicist. He saw shards of pottery, perhaps Mycenaean, scattered in the rubble; Odysseus was unlikely to have been the first Achaean prince to live there.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The birds singing in this ruined choir might have told us its history, but there was no one to interpret their song. Wilson wandered off alone and spent a while looking out to sea. Later, she told me that she&#39;d been thinking about her mother: “She was the home that I came back to.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;em>;Nostos&lt;/em>; may also imply the yearning for a home that doesn&#39;t exist, or no longer, or only as an ideal: a place where the people you love the most finally recognize and embrace you. “I often feel like an Odysseus,” Wilson said. “He was always reinventing himself and, like a translator, pretending to be someone else and telling that character&#39;s story. But maybe a true self can emerge from the lies.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;When we got back to the road, a sudden apparition arrested us. The setting sun backlit a spider&#39;s web. She hung like a dense onyx bead precisely at our eye level between a gnarly olive tree and a pine whose scent mingled in the warm air with jasmine and goat dung. Wilson whispered, “Athena is with us.” ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot;

Grann is among the most lauded writers at &lt;em>;The New Yorker&lt;/em>;; David Remnick says that “his urge to find unique stories and tell them with rigor and style is rare to the vanishing point.” Grann talks with Remnick about his beginnings as a writer, and about his almost obsessive research and writing process. “The trick is how can you tell a true story using these literary techniques and remain completely factually based,” Grann says. “What I realized as I did this more is that you are an excavator. You aren&#39;t imagining the story—you are excavating the story.” Grann recounts travelling in rough seas to the desolate site of the eighteenth-century shipwreck at the heart of “The Wager,” his most recent book, so that he could convey the sailors&#39; despair more accurately. That book is also being made into a film by Scorsese. “It&#39;s a learning curve because I&#39;ve never been in the world of Hollywood,” Grann says. “You&#39;re a historical resource. 。 。 。 Once they asked me, &#39;What was the lighting in the room?&#39; I thought about it for a long time. That&#39;s something I would not need to know, writing a book.” But Grann is glad to be in the hands of an expert and keep his distance from the process. “I&#39;m not actually interested in making a film,” he admits. “I&#39;m really interested in these stories, and so I love that somebody else with their own vision and intellect is going to draw on these stories and add to our understanding of whatever this work is.”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot;

Like Edmund Gosse&#39;s memoir of the same name, Raban&#39;s posthumously published final work follows an English father and son whose lives take diverging paths. Raban juxtaposes an account of his rehabilitation after a stroke that occurred in 2011, when he was sixty-eight, with his father&#39;s experiences as an artillery officer in the Second World War. The stories never connect, reflecting the divide between the liberal, literary son, who immigrated to Seattle in 1990, and the conservative father, who became a vicar in the Church of England. The war chapters, which excerpt correspondence between Raban&#39;s parents, are compelling, but it is Raban&#39;s reckoning with his own frailty that carries the emotional weight of the book. “What have I lost?”他问。 “And am I fooling myself?”&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;247 Politics Cable Television the Fragmenting of America from Watergate to Fox News by Kathryn Cramer Brownell.&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64f7687cb25752e83487338f/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/230918_r42950web.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64f7687cb25752e83487338f/master/w_120,c_limit/230918_r42950web.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64f7687cb25752e83487338f/master/w_240,c_limit/230918_r42950web.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64f7687cb25752e83487338f/master/w_320,c_limit/230918_r42950web.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64f7687cb25752e83487338f/master/w_640,c_limit/230918_r42950web.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64f7687cb25752e83487338f/master/w_960,c_limit/230918_r42950web.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64f7687cb25752e83487338f/master/w_1280,c_limit/230918_r42950web.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64f7687cb25752e83487338f/master/w_1600,c_limit/230918_r42950web.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;p >;&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/24-Politics-Television-Fragmenting-Watergate/dp/0691246661&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/24-Politics-Television-Fragmenting-Watergate/dp/0691246661&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/24-Politics-Television-Fragmenting-Watergate/dp/0691246661&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;&lt;strong>;24/7 Politics&lt;/strong>;&lt;/a>;&lt;em>;, by Kathryn Cramer Brownell (Princeton)&lt;/em>;. This near-encyclopedic exploration of the rise of cable news begins with the lead-up to the 1984 Presidential election, when cable executives and lobbyists set out to dismantle the power of network broadcasters and redirect it to themselves. Brownell, a historian, details how the opponents of network broadcasting successfully cast the industry as “elitist” and peddled cable as a democratizing force that would “empower people, politicians, and perspectives.” Her persuasive account argues that cable&#39;s advocates were, in fact, motivated primarily by profit, and that cable television&#39;s Sisyphean pursuit of ratings and revenue ultimately served to cultivate a toxic media—and political—environment.&lt;/p>;&lt;hr />;&lt;h2 >;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/best-books-2023&quot;>;The Best Books of 2023&lt;/a>;&lt;/h2>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;Briefly Noted Book Reviews&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/63d16763c44837936a5fb854/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/bestbooks-header-2023-desktop.png&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/63d16763c44837936a5fb854/master/w_120,c_limit/bestbooks-header-2023-desktop.png 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/63d16763c44837936a5fb854/master/w_240,c_limit/bestbooks-header-2023-desktop.png 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/63d16763c44837936a5fb854/master/w_320,c_limit/bestbooks-header-2023-desktop.png 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/63d16763c44837936a5fb854/master/w_640,c_limit/bestbooks-header-2023-desktop.png 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/63d16763c44837936a5fb854/master/w_960,c_limit/bestbooks-header-2023-desktop.png 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/63d16763c44837936a5fb854/master/w_1280,c_limit/bestbooks-header-2023-desktop.png 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/63d16763c44837936a5fb854/master/w_1600,c_limit/bestbooks-header-2023-desktop.png 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;p >;&lt;em>;Read our reviews of the year&#39;s notable new fiction and nonfiction.&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>;&lt;hr />;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;Witness by Jamel Brinkley.&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64f76862a62b93da484f0d66/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/230918_r42951web.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64f76862a62b93da484f0d66/master/w_120,c_limit/230918_r42951web.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64f76862a62b93da484f0d66/master/w_240,c_limit/230918_r42951web.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64f76862a62b93da484f0d66/master/w_320,c_limit/230918_r42951web.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64f76862a62b93da484f0d66/master/w_640,c_limit/230918_r42951web.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64f76862a62b93da484f0d66/master/w_960,c_limit/230918_r42951web.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64f76862a62b93da484f0d66/master/w_1280,c_limit/230918_r42951web.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64f76862a62b93da484f0d66/master/w_1600,c_limit/230918_r42951web.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;l249jim&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;n0vcs9&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Witness-Stories-Jamel-Brinkley/dp/0374607036&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Witness-Stories-Jamel-Brinkley/dp/0374607036&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Witness-Stories-Jamel-Brinkley/dp/0374607036&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Witness&lt;/strong>;&lt;/a>;&lt;em>;, by Jamel Brinkley (Farrar, Straus &amp;amp; Giroux)&lt;/em>;. Many of the stories in this powerful collection, by a National Book Award finalist, orbit figures who dwell on the past, unable to accept their “forward movement through the entanglements of time.” There is a woman who is obsessed with the wife of her brother&#39;s killer; a son haunted by his mother as he makes plans to install his father in a nursing home; a man whose budding romance ends after he relates a horrific memory. The wounds that afflict Brinkley&#39;s characters stem from social inequality—police brutality, exploitation in the gig economy, and doctors&#39; racist dismissals of Black patients—and from such universal vulnerabilities as family discord, heritable illnesses, and our own resistance to change.&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;The Details by Ia Genberg.&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64f768647883dc299e90b409/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/230918_r42952web.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64f768647883dc299e90b409/master/w_120,c_limit/230918_r42952web.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64f768647883dc299e90b409/master/w_240,c_limit/230918_r42952web.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64f768647883dc299e90b409/master/w_320,c_limit/230918_r42952web.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64f768647883dc299e90b409/master/w_640,c_limit/230918_r42952web.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64f768647883dc299e90b409/master/w_960,c_limit/230918_r42952web.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64f768647883dc299e90b409/master/w_1280,c_limit/230918_r42952web.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64f768647883dc299e90b409/master/w_1600,c_limit/230918_r42952web.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;p >;&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Details-Novel-Ia-Genberg/dp/0063309718&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Details-Novel-Ia-Genberg/dp/0063309718&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Details-Novel-Ia-Genberg/dp/0063309718&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;&lt;strong>;The Details&lt;/strong>;&lt;/a>;&lt;em>;, by Ia Genberg, translated from the Swedish by Kira Josefsson (HarperVia)&lt;/em>;. This elliptical novel, narrated by an unnamed woman who is confined to her bed by a high fever, consists of four character studies. During her illness, the woman picks up a book—an edition of Paul Auster&#39;s “New York Trilogy”—inscribed to her by a former lover. Flipping through it brings back vivid recollections of that woman, whose frosty personality “was part of her—and not as deficiency but as tool, a useful little patch of ice.” These reminiscences lead to others: first of a wayward roommate; then of a “hurricane” ex-boyfriend; and finally of the narrator&#39;s traumatized mother. She relates her textured insights into human nature through small moments. “As far as the dead are concerned,” she muses, “all that matters are the details, the degree of density.”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;jykxrki&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot;

aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >; &lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;也许这是一个不愉快的夜晚。几周后我回来时，发现了同样的人群，同样温暖的环境，同样核鸡尾酒派对的喋喋不休和叮当声。切奇的房间是一个你想进入的房间，一个你想要的房间——所以当你走近他们的展位时，你会怀着极大的乐观态度向主人微笑。当你被派去等待你迟到的同伴到达酒吧时，你保持着微笑，那里已经满了。你在两个就座的聚会之间摇摆不定地侧身移动，并在那里永远站了四分钟，直到你引起调酒师的注意，你和他大声相声（“一杯湿杜松子马提尼！”“一杯鸽子马提尼？”“一个杜松子酒马提尼，湿了！”），然后你在吧台椅背和餐桌两侧之间的一条狭窄小路上摇摇晃晃，这是餐厅的主要服务动脉，试图保留鸡尾酒中的内容玻璃溅到某人坐着的头上，阳光明媚的心情变得阴暗，只是一点点。这次的桌子很不错——几乎所有的桌子都在后面的房间和浴室入口处的那个小岛外面——尽管不如那些固定房间的弧形隔间好，这些隔间是为&lt;em>;非常人准备的。 &lt;/em>;

data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Cecchi&#39;s 的食物相当不错，只是有点不确定它想要讲述的故事。曾在棕榈滩工作过的主厨塞萨尔·巴尔德拉斯 (Cesar Balderas) 在小酒馆风格的菜单上加入了眨眼的怀旧音乐，这正是喜欢马提尼酒和 TikTok 的人群所想要的：刨冰上铺着巨大的鸡尾酒虾；极简主义、精致多汁的汉堡； a 不是切碎而不是组合的楔形沙拉。与 Café Loup 咖啡馆一样，Cecchi&#39;s 的薯条是菜单上最好的食物。与 Café Loup 不同的是，这并不是一种隐晦的侮辱：薯条细长、金黄、酥脆，闪烁着盐味，蘸着龙蒿浓重的棕色黄油蛋黄酱，搭配菜单上的嫩牛排，味道极佳。厨房里也有一些有点奇怪的地方：San Gennaro in a Blanket，这是一种意大利香肠，用毯子里的猪做成，配上番茄酱，看起来和尝起来都像是儿童菜单上的；杏釉排骨开胃菜虽然非常美味，但在概念上更符合 19 世纪 80 年代的《Parade》杂志，而不是 Cecchi&#39;s 试图唤起的永恒魅力。简短的特色鸡尾酒单包括苹果提尼和石榴大都会，这是近代最大的两种酒精妙语，但它们绝对是直白的：它们制作精良，味道鲜美（它们一直如此！它们成为这样的原因是有原因的）非常时尚！），但不清楚餐厅是想复兴它们，取笑它们，还是假装它们从一开始就从未过时。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;甜点很简单，我特别满意的是围绕不太甜的饼干制作的草莓酥饼。但当我点了一杯卡布奇诺，想多待一会儿时，我收到了一杯加了牛奶的双份浓缩咖啡，没有一点泡沫。这还重要吗？ “食物还是服务？食物还是服务？食物还是服务？” Cecchi-Azzolina 在他的回忆录中若有所思地补充道：“即使每次都吃同一道菜——Raoul&#39;s 的牛排、Minetta Tavern 的 Black Label 汉堡、Carbone 的通心粉、&lt;em>;ris de veau&lt;/em” >; Le Coucou 的美食、La Grenouille 的多佛比目鱼，或者由时下最受喜爱的厨师烹制的一些新混合物——这仍然是服务。 &lt;em>;始终如一的服务。&lt;/em>;”第二次没有人忘记送鸡尾酒。 ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;
