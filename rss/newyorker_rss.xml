aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >; &lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;也许这是一个不愉快的夜晚。几周后我回来时，发现了同样的人群，同样温暖的环境，同样核鸡尾酒派对的喋喋不休和叮当声。切奇的房间是一个你想进入的房间，一个你想要的房间——所以当你走近他们的展位时，你会怀着极大的乐观态度向主人微笑。当你被派去等待你迟到的同伴到达酒吧时，你保持着微笑，那里已经满了。你在两个就座的聚会之间摇摆不定地侧身移动，并在那里永远站了四分钟，直到你引起调酒师的注意，你和他大声相声（“一杯湿杜松子马提尼！”“一杯鸽子马提尼？”“一个杜松子酒马提尼，湿了！”），然后你在吧台椅背和餐桌两侧之间的一条狭窄小路上摇摇晃晃，这是餐厅的主要服务动脉，试图保留鸡尾酒中的内容玻璃溅到某人坐着的头上，阳光明媚的心情变得阴暗，只是一点点。这次的桌子很不错——几乎所有的桌子都在后面的房间和浴室入口处的那个小岛外面——尽管不如那些固定房间的弧形隔间好，这些隔间是为&lt;em>;非常人准备的。 &lt;/em>;

data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Cecchi&#39;s 的食物相当不错，只是有点不确定它想要讲述的故事。曾在棕榈滩工作过的主厨塞萨尔·巴尔德拉斯 (Cesar Balderas) 在小酒馆风格的菜单上加入了眨眼的怀旧音乐，这正是喜欢马提尼酒和 TikTok 的人群所想要的：刨冰上铺着巨大的鸡尾酒虾；极简主义、精致多汁的汉堡； a 不是切碎而不是组合的楔形沙拉。与 Café Loup 咖啡馆一样，Cecchi&#39;s 的薯条是菜单上最好的食物。与 Café Loup 不同的是，这并不是一种隐晦的侮辱：薯条细长、金黄、酥脆，闪烁着盐味，蘸着龙蒿浓重的棕色黄油蛋黄酱，搭配菜单上的嫩牛排，味道极佳。厨房里也有一些有点奇怪的地方：San Gennaro in a Blanket，这是一种意大利香肠，用毯子里的猪做成，配上番茄酱，看起来和尝起来都像是儿童菜单上的；杏釉排骨开胃菜虽然非常美味，但在概念上更符合 19 世纪 80 年代的《Parade》杂志，而不是 Cecchi&#39;s 试图唤起的永恒魅力。简短的特色鸡尾酒单包括苹果提尼和石榴大都会，这是近代最大的两种酒精妙语，但它们绝对是直白的：它们制作精良，味道鲜美（它们一直如此！它们成为这样的原因是有原因的）非常时尚！），但不清楚餐厅是想复兴它们，取笑它们，还是假装它们从一开始就从未过时。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;甜点很简单，我特别满意的是围绕不太甜的饼干制作的草莓酥饼。但当我点了一杯卡布奇诺，想多待一会儿时，我收到了一杯加了牛奶的双份浓缩咖啡，没有一点泡沫。这还重要吗？ “食物还是服务？食物还是服务？食物还是服务？” Cecchi-Azzolina 在他的回忆录中若有所思地补充道：“即使每次都吃同一道菜——Raoul&#39;s 的牛排、Minetta Tavern 的 Black Label 汉堡、Carbone 的通心粉、&lt;em>;ris de veau&lt;/em” >; Le Coucou 的美食、La Grenouille 的多佛比目鱼，或者由时下最受喜爱的厨师烹制的一些新混合物——这仍然是服务。 &lt;em>;始终如一的服务。&lt;/em>;”第二次没有人忘记送鸡尾酒。 ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;

。 “我们都写有大创意的书，”克莱因写道，“我们都有棕色的头发，有时会因为过度突出而变成金色。 。 。 。我们都是犹太人。”两人都有一个名叫阿夫拉姆（Avram）的伴侣。 （克莱因的丈夫于 2021 年竞选加拿大社会党公职，他的名字是阿维。）尽管他们曾经拥有不同的专业领域，但他们的专业最终开始趋同。我可以证明这种困惑的持久性：在 2017 年纽约客节采访克莱因之前，我收到了朋友们发来的多条短信，说：“祝娜奥米·沃尔夫好运！”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;娜奥米的困惑变得更加严重随着话语转移到社交媒体上，内奥米和其他人一样，都缩减到了粉丝数量和微小的头像。病毒式&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://twitter.com/markpopham/status/1186995263807864832&quot;

>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;我曾是一名公众人士在我成年后的大部分时间里。我取消了一次售书活动；我取消了各种让读者告诉我我是谁的公共活动。因此，像我们许多人一样，我打破了有关社交媒体的所有个人规则。我上网寻找一些社交关系的模拟，希望能找到镜像到我自己的东西。我有过这种特殊的经历，有时候，成百上千的人在谈论我，但实际上是在谈论别人，把我误认为是另一位内奥米作家——内奥米·沃尔夫。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;其中一部分是真正的混乱。在&lt;em>;新冠肺炎&lt;/em>;期间，沃尔夫成为了医疗错误信息的工业规模传播者。所以有些人真的很想知道：为什么娜奥米·克莱因说疫苗应用程序是法西斯政变？但后来这也是推特左侧的一个笑话。我经历了一段真正眩晕的时期，比如：构建自我的所有努力是为了什么？&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;个人品牌的想法是主题之一二十多年前你写的《No Logo》——正如你在《Doppelganger》中写的那样，它很快就成为了你敦促读者对之产生怀疑的那种商品化符号。&lt;/strong>;&lt;/ p>;&lt;p>;大约十年来我一直想回到那些材料。我想写一篇关于个人品牌文化如何影响我们彼此之间的关系，影响我们的社会运动的文章。这是一个很难写的领域，这就是为什么我要讲一个我以前从未真正讲过的故事，讲述写一本谴责品牌的书，然后自己成为一个品牌的怪异、矛盾和虚伪——我总是这样做极力否认是真的，但客观上是真的，无论我是否在努力表现我的品牌。&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;而且我真的试图颠覆它。我决定，“我不再写有关营销的文章了。”我后来的书根本就不是建立在“No Logo”的基础上的。我试图成为一个糟糕的品牌——没有一致性，没有重复。但我还是很在乎自己的名誉的。我仍然过多地使用社交媒体——这对我来说是接触读者的一种非常有价值的方式。作为一名反资本主义作家进行巡回售书是一个固有的矛盾，你知道吗？我想把它写成一个我们都在其中并受到牵连的系统。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;你一直是左派坚定和决心的化身——而且，在书中，你努力解决在大流行期间你变得更难获得这些品质的方式。&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;这不是那种拉拉啦啦队长的角色，但它也不是失败主义的——我希望你我并不觉得自己要放弃。我认为这更多的是左派忧郁的传统，这是一种真正的政治传统——Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor 在她的&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/books/under-review/the- disciplined-power-of-disappointment&quot;>;评论&lt;/a>;

>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;我想强调，这本书不是关于我的分身的。它利用她作为所有其他已经改变的人的案例研究，但它也利用分身的形象来理解我们政治时刻的不可思议。弗洛伊德将离奇描述为那种改变曾经熟悉的事物的恐惧。过去人们对蜡像感到非常苦恼，而现在我们有了一个完整的分身世界。在某些方面，政治运动感觉像是彼此的分身——在加拿大抗议疫苗强制令的卡车司机车队感觉就像我参与过的大规模社会运动的分身，就像针对 Keystone XL 管道的抗议活动一样。大约十年前，Bill McKibben 写了一本名为“&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Eaarth-Making-Life-Tough-Planet/dp/0312541198” data-event-click 的书=&quot;{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Eaarth-Making-Life-Tough-Planet/dp/0312541198&quot;}&quot;

But, right: whenever you don&#39;t like reality, you can just say it&#39;s not real. Rather than confront the implications of climate change, you just deny the reality. And I think that that impulse has been generalized to basically everything.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Historically, the doppelgänger emerges in culture during moments of collective vertigo. One of the first pieces of theoretical writing about doppelgängers was by Otto Rank, in the first year of the First World War. Then artists turned to the figure of the doppelgänger again during the Second World War. Charlie Chaplin made his film “The Great Dictator,” in 1940, and cast himself as both the persecuted Jewish barber and the Hitler-like dictator, and they trade places, and the Jewish barber dressed as Hitler gives one of the greatest antifascist speeches of all time.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;You write about listening to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tag/steve-bannon&quot;>;Steve Bannon&lt;/a>;&#39;s podcast. He&#39;s ranting about living under the rule of the wealthy to suppress the masses, and you realize he sounds like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2003/03/31/the-devils-accountant&quot;>;Noam Chomsky&lt;/a>;—or, maybe, like you. You had urged your readers to be suspicious of those with power taking advantage of moments of crisis, and many on the far right began to understand &lt;em >;COVID&lt;/em>; as exactly this sort of situation, only with ideas totally divorced from material reality—that the government was tracking all of us with microparticles, etc.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;That&#39;s the part of this research journey that chilled me most. People asked me whether I was worried that, in listening to Steve Bannon so much, I might begin to agree with him—that I might red-pill myself or something. But that is not what worried me. What worried me is exactly what you&#39;re describing, hearing Steve Bannon take up these issues that I knew to be very powerful, these traditionally left-wing issues that had been kind of left unattended.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;When I would hear Bannon cosplaying Chomsky, or my own politics, it wasn&#39;t that I thought he believed it. It&#39;s that he was using this political move to great effect, looking at the people and the issues that the Democratic Party has abandoned. And, I mean, he has other moves—he&#39;s racist, he&#39;s xenophobic, he&#39;s transphobic. But this is part of what he did with workers in the Rust Belt who had voted for Democrats their whole life, and who were continually told by politicians that trade deals were going to be renegotiated, and then the politicians just signed more of them. What Bannon did with the forgotten everyman is what he&#39;s been doing more recently with the angry everymom, and that&#39;s who my doppelgänger represents to him—the frazzled &lt;em >;COVID&lt;/em>; mom who feels mocked and dismissed. He says, “Come on over,” and then he moves very quickly from masks and vaccines to “critical race theory” and transphobia.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;And we can get angry about that, and we should, but we have to get rid of this fear of sounding too much like the other side. During &lt;em >;COVID&lt;/em>;, it was sort of, like, if &lt;em>;they&lt;/em>; are anti-vax and anti-mask, we just need to be the people saying, Get vaccinated, and wear your mask, and don&#39;t make too big a deal about all the other things our governments could have done, like lift the patents on the vaccines and make sure that every classroom had proper air filters and make sure that nurses had PPE and ban pandemic profiteering. Obviously, there are exceptions, but we were not ambitious in calling that out, and we dangerously ceded political territory.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;This unholy marriage between Wolf and Bannon is an example of what the political theorists William Callison and Quinn Slobodian call diagonalist politics. Can you explain that idea a little?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;There&#39;s a phrase used to describe these new political alliances in Germany called &lt;em>;querdenker&lt;/em>;, which is sometimes translated as out-of-the-box thinking or diagonal thinking. It&#39;s a discourse of post-partisanship, but, as Callison and Slobodian point out, diagonalist politics veer consistently to the right. It isn&#39;t horseshoe theory—it&#39;s very much a challenge to horseshoe theory, because it isn&#39;t people on the far left who are going over. It&#39;s not the Marxists and the Trotskyists. It&#39;s people from the green left; from wellness culture; small-business folks; the yoga instructor who&#39;s mad that their studio closed down—it&#39;s what I call the “far out” meeting the far right.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;2k0wtf&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;And a lot of these folks are people who had played by the rules of the game. We live in a culture that has told people very clearly, You are on your own in this cruel world. Your job is not to look after a whole society—Margaret Thatcher said there was no such thing as society. Your job is to optimize yourself and your family, to create a little fortress around you and your loved ones, and, if you succeed, that is your heroic narrative. And then &lt;em >;COVID&lt;/em>; hit and suddenly the rules changed. We were told we were supposed to care about people who were systemically made invisible in our culture. To me, the wonder is not that a bunch of people said, Screw that. What I think is interesting is that they were actually the minority, and the majority welcomed the reality that we actually do live in a web of connection.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;Yes, well, at least at the level of discourse. But, as you write, this is a moment when the discourse on many subjects has been drastically altered while the underlying conditions remain the same—or get worse, because the discourse obscures the reality. In the pandemic, there was this groundswell of interest in what constitutes essential labor and a fairly mainstream movement toward police abolition and mutual aid. Now &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tag/eric-adams&quot;>;Eric Adams&lt;/a>;, an ex-cop, is the Mayor of New York City, and billionaire fortunes have skyrocketed, and those workers at grocery stores never actually got their raises at all. You describe this as a “moment when words and ideas underwent a radical currency devaluation,” and you connect that crash “to the torrent of words in which we&#39;re swimming on these screens.”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I think one of the greatest pieces of political performance art in my lifetime is what Greta Thunberg did at the Glasgow climate summit a couple of years ago, when she shook off her former role of being the young person who pleads with and scolds world leaders to match their words with their actions. Instead, anytime someone put a microphone in front of her, she just went, They sort of improved the blah, blah, blah, and they actually added a bit more blah, blah, blah, to the agreement, and, you know, blah, blah, blah. It was amazing, and, if you look at what she&#39;s been doing since then, she&#39;s been getting arrested trying to stop fossil-fuel infrastructure.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I think that&#39;s the only way we get out of speechlessness and bring words and actions back into alignment. I still believe in words—I wouldn&#39;t be writing books if I didn&#39;t, or having this conversation. But I don&#39;t think that what we need to do we can just do with words. I think we organize in our communities and we try to live our principles, including treating one another better. That&#39;s another thing that was interesting about eavesdropping on Steve Bannon. We tend to just see the fire-breathing clips of him, but he actually performs a kind of cuddly self for his listeners. He makes a really big deal about how kind he is, and accepting, and willing to tolerate difference. It&#39;s a performance, in the way that everything he does is a performance, but he is feeding off of identified failures. He sees an opportunity in the way that liberals and leftists treat one another like garbage a lot of the time.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;An underlying argument in this book is that we move from confusion and flux toward calm and action through the doppelgänger of all these doppelgänger situations. You also write about another kind of shadow self, borrowing a formulation from the writer Daisy Hildyard—the idea being that, while we&#39;re typing on iPhones, we also exist in rare-earth mines alongside poisoned teen-age laborers. The awareness of the plunder and damage inherent in the idealized American life has increased, but so, perhaps, has the lived acceptance of it, and the result is a simmering sense of unease.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I quote James Baldwin a lot in the book, because I think he&#39;s probably the most powerful theorist of the fear of what Hildyard is talking about. She calls it the second body—the shadow self that&#39;s implicated in all of these systems that are unveiled. It isn&#39;t just that they&#39;re hard to look at, it&#39;s also that we are implicated; we are not apart from them. There is my body sitting in this chair, and there&#39;s my other body, hovering over the tax dollars funding drone warfare, implicated in oil wars, implicated in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/07/03/book-reviews-plastic-waste&quot;>;plastic in the ocean&lt;/a>;. That&#39;s not other people—that&#39;s me, that&#39;s us.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;We&#39;re in this moment of unveiling, and &lt;em >;COVID&lt;/em>; played a big role in that. People and places that were systematically hidden were suddenly being seen, because they were the &lt;em >;COVID&lt;/em>; hotspots—the eldercare facilities, the slaughterhouse floors. The shadow worlds were coming up—the shadows of our past were surfacing in the racial-justice reckonings. In Canada, we had two waves of this, one after the murder of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tag/george-floyd&quot;>;George Floyd&lt;/a>; and another after unmarked mass graves were found at the sites of residential schools for First Nations people. We are implicated in the histories that are coming at us, in the future that&#39;s coming at us, the storms that will hit us, and we are implicated in worker exploitation in the clothes that we wear and the foods that we eat. And, oh, my God, that&#39;s hard. Is it any wonder that people are finding ways to look away?&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;fzbh1&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;70ad3r&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;The argument I make about conspiracy culture—and what&#39;s going on with my doppelgänger and Steve Bannon—is that they&#39;re creating fake scandals that are an amazing way to not look at the real scandals. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a coincidence that Elon Musk loves conspiracy theories. Of course, he does—he&#39;s a walking conspiracy theory. As Ronan Farrow recently &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/08/28/elon-musks-shadow-rule&quot;>;wrote&lt;/a>; in his story, Elon Musk is running a whole bunch of stuff that you didn&#39;t know about. Conspiracy theories keep us from looking at the systems of power and exploitation that we actually have the goods for, these things that we can actually prove.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I dove deep into doppelgänger novels and short stories and films for this book, and I think I can say with certainty that pretty much all the story lines start with you thinking that you&#39;re confronting your doppelgänger and end with you confronting yourself. So I would say to those of us who might feel a bit smug about those ridiculous people who are choosing to take a flight into fantasy instead of doing the hard work of looking at reality—I mean, I went to “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-front-row/barbie-is-brilliant-beautiful-and-fun-as-hell&quot;>;Barbie&lt;/a>;.” Did you? There are lots of different ways of fleeing from reality.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;Well, speaking of “Barbie,” last week I reread “No Logo,” which still feels very prescient, but also feels almost quaint in the age of the &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://twitter.com/GoldmanSachs/status/879408187828555776&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://twitter.com/GoldmanSachs/status/879408187828555776&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/GoldmanSachs/status/879408187828555776&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;Goldman Sachs pride float&lt;/a>;. We&#39;ve reached a level of corporate capture that has progressed through many levels of nightmare since you wrote that book in the nineties. But you write about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/07/10/after-barbie-mattel-is-raiding-its-entire-toybox&quot;>;Mattel&lt;/a>; in that book several times, and also Barbie, who you refer to as a “cultural imperialist in pink.”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;I did go to “Barbie,” also, literally two weeks after I had a baby. I was immersed in the real and the animal, and it sounded amazing to escape into something shiny and synthetic, and I had a great time. But I found it vaguely depressing as an example of how corporations now actively incorporate dissent as a way of maintaining power. The Barbie movie explicitly advertised itself to viewers who hate Barbie.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Genius.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;And all these Barbie corporate collaborations, with Airbnb or with ice-cream companies, were celebrated as legitimate creative events. And it doesn&#39;t seem as though people fail to get what&#39;s going on—the people behind these productions are smart and funny, and we&#39;re steeped in irony and desperate and taking what we can get.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Barbie” is only one part of this broader thing, right? We&#39;re going to see a lot more from Mattel as a film producer, and we&#39;re seeing all these films about brands—about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-front-row/blackberry-like-the-blackberry-never-reaches-its-potential&quot;>;BlackBerry&lt;/a>;, about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-front-row/air-reviewed-its-fun-to-spend-time-with-these-people-but-we-dont-know-much-about-them&quot;>;Nike&lt;/a>;. In “No Logo,” I wrote about this urge I had very powerfully as a kid growing up in the eighties, to basically crawl inside my television set and live there, especially because I grew up with crunchy sixties radicals as parents, and my home culture was very much in contrast with the dominant culture of the eighties. All I wanted to do was to escape it, and to just be in this bulbous, shiny, smooth world of logos.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;And I &lt;em>;still&lt;/em>; have that, and I did also enjoy the Barbie movie, and I also hated myself for enjoying it in the sense that it isn&#39;t just a fun afternoon, right? Because—and this is the boring part—there is a second body attached to it, and that second body is producing little plastic dolls at record rates, and it is not the moment for us to be doing that. I feel like such a boring shrew saying that about something that&#39;s giving people pleasure when we all need pleasure. But I really do think we have to find other forms of pleasure.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I also think that that desire to smooth ourselves out is an interesting one. A through line in this research for me was the self taking up too much space. This is where I embraced having a doppelgänger as a sort of exposure therapy, because I probably care too much about the image I project in the world. I&#39;m not proud of that. It is tied to, I think, an overly developed sense of shame, and a sense of being surveilled that came from having these extroverted hippie parents and just being really embarrassed of them when I was a kid. And then I had the wonderful and weird experience of having my first book make me suddenly well known—and literally surveilled. There was a newspaper in Canada with a short-lived column called “Klein Watch,” where they would try to catch me going into a Gap or a Starbucks. The Vice guys, before they became media titans, had a free weekly newspaper distributed all over Toronto, where I lived, and they sent people to go through my garbage and photograph my tampon boxes and Diet Coke cans and Calvin Klein underwear tags to prove that the “No Logo” girl consumed logos.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Because that happened to me when I was fairly young, it made me inflate my sense of importance in the world. People were watching me to try to catch me doing something wrong, but it was still narcissism—it still involved thinking that people care about you way more than they actually do. It was probably just three guys, you know? And so there&#39;s something amazing about having a doppelgänger who lots of people think is you, a person doing all kinds of things you would never do, this fact-free remix of your work—not consciously—and feeding the thought puree to Tucker Carlson, who nods vehemently.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;tx53d7&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;It just tells you very starkly the futility of all of this self-performance. It comes back to the question of what we do about all this speechlessness. I think we hold ourselves a little more loosely. I think we melt some of the icy edges of our identities. As Mariame Kaba says, everything worth doing is done with other people. And that doesn&#39;t mean we&#39;re going to annihilate our egos or not care about ourselves, but the amount of labor we are putting into optimizing our bodies, our image, our kids, is robbing from the work that needs to be done to preserve the habitability of the planet, to preserve our humanity in the face of those spasms, so we don&#39;t double down on the barbarism, on the borders. We have a ton of work to do, and I don&#39;t believe we will do it unless we get over ourselves a little bit.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;As you note in this book, it&#39;s a lot easier to prune and manicure the self than to turn one&#39;s attention to enormous systems that feel intractable. But I do think more and more people have an understanding that the relentless optimizing of one&#39;s own life through consumption and travel directly harms the commons, by polluting the planet—and this knowledge, which we often suppress, reëmerges in weird ways.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I was struck by the way you wrote about motherhood, the spasms of consumption linked to becoming a new parent. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever felt the need to shop more than when I first became a parent. And it&#39;s instructive, because it shows you that it&#39;s really just about fear—that you&#39;re afraid of being a bad parent, that you don&#39;t have the people to look to for help that previous generations did. I think a lot of consumption comes from that place of fear, and it&#39;s helpful to identify it, and think about how we can meet those needs.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;I&#39;m going through this right now, with my second baby, and it has definitely struck me anew how the dominant reality of isolated new-parent struggle is always disguised as an exciting opportunity for individual optimization. I mostly notice this at 3 &lt;em >;AM&lt;/em>; as I think about buying things on my phone. You talk in “Doppelganger” about the work of your life being pattern recognition. What I see as the essential pattern that recurs in your work—the profit incentive devouring everything—is certainly present here. Did you see other patterns that were specific to this project?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;When I wrote “The Shock Doctrine,” which came out in 2007, I looked at what I call the disaster-capitalism complex. It was not an entirely new phenomenon, but, during the Bush years, the age of Blackwater and Halliburton, a whole lot of aspects of war-making and reconstruction and aid were moved from the public to the private sector. Then Hurricane Katrina happened, and all of these same contractors moved from Iraq to what one reporter called Baghdad on the Bayou. There, as always, conspiracies swirled in the wake of the disaster, because of the presence of exploitation. People think, Someone must have blown up the levee, because people are getting so rich off of all of this. I was in Sri Lanka in 2005, a few months after the tsunami there, and there was so much profiteering and land-grabbing that people started saying, Maybe the US detonated a war weapon. It wasn&#39;t true, but you could understand why people&#39;s minds went there.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;But it wasn&#39;t until &lt;em >;COVID&lt;/em>; that conspiracy itself became an industry, because now we&#39;re in the attention economy as well as all these other economies. So if we want to know why conspiracy theories are surging in the midst of unsettling times, it&#39;s in part because conspiracy is now part of that disaster-capitalism complex.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The other thing I think is important to map about this moment is where the energy of &lt;em >;COVID&lt;/em>; denial goes now that the mandates are lifted. And I think a lot of that energy is now moving to climate-change denial, and misinformation about non-&lt;em >;COVID&lt;/em>; childhood vaccines. And these people have a lot more friends with them—all these people who were apolitical before and got political during &lt;em >;COVID&lt;/em>;. I think we need to be aware of both of those shifts.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;There&#39;s a new shimmer of strangeness to this book, compared to your past ones—it&#39;s baked into the subject matter, into the time in which you&#39;re writing it, into the medium where the discourse about these ideas is conveyed. You do reach a final note of clarity and resolve, but I wondered if it was difficult to get there, either in writing or in life.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I do think I wrote myself back into some kind of stability. And I lean into myself as an unstable narrator at the start of the book for dramatic effect, but it&#39;s not made up—I really was listening to Steve Bannon while doing yoga. I was politically speechless, and the speechlessness was coming from the fact that I have been a particular kind of writer for a quarter of a century, and I have been pretty clear about, Here is what we do.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I think my speechlessness had to do with political disappointment. I&#39;d just been part of the Bernie campaign. We were marching in the streets for Black lives, I was moved by the way people seemed to be interested in showing up for working-class people, I was moved by the mutual aid, and somehow so much of it dissipated in a very ugly way. And my political disappointment is always in our side, you know? It&#39;s not in them. I never had expectations for them. It&#39;s us—it&#39;s always us.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;9dv63&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;vyvske&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;For me, writing is medicine. But I didn&#39;t know how to write the content in a way I was excited about. I felt like I was just repeating myself, and to less and less effect, particularly when it came to climate. So I thought maybe if I can get excited about form, that&#39;ll unlock something. If I could write about this subject from the inside, and really make myself vulnerable in ways that I hadn&#39;t done before, it would help me believe in myself again.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;And there was something else about this project that was kind of relaxing. We are all racing against the clock, as writers, and it doesn&#39;t always encourage our best work. But, in this case, I knew I didn&#39;t have to rush anything, because no one could write this book but me.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;Did you feel less like yourself—less like Naomi Klein—when you were confused?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;I felt like I was not able to be the person at the front of the room saying, We can do it, we&#39;ve got three more years. I&#39;ve been that person for a long time. In 2014, we were saying we had a decade to turn things around, and then we said it again in 2015, in 2016. And then it became, OK, we are not going to prevent dangerous warming, but we can maybe prevent catastrophic warming. And then at a certain point, if we&#39;re not turning it around—are you going to be the person who&#39;s still going to say this? Like, Guys, we&#39;ve got six months left?&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;So I knew I couldn&#39;t honestly say that we were going to achieve these kinds of transformations on this timescale. But I think there are a lot of things we can do to save one another&#39;s lives. And that depends on whether or not we see one another as human, or worth saving. That&#39;s part of the work of this book—looking at the way we create hierarchies of the human.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;Where do we go from here in terms of electoral politics? Bernie isn&#39;t running again. What do you think of what &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tag/joe-biden&quot;>;Biden&lt;/a>; has accomplished in his first term?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Biden can be pushed. Biden right now is not the Biden he was under Obama, or the Biden before that. The Biden we get is infinitely connected to whether or not there are forces outside politics that are building real power and real constituencies. As much as I had some of the most thrilling moments of my life in the Bernie campaign, I recognize that it was something of a shortcut—to go straight for the Presidency without building more base power, whether that&#39;s in tenants&#39; unions, debtors&#39; unions, labor unions. I&#39;m in LA right now, and I take heart in the fact that half the city is on strike. And I don&#39;t think that&#39;s apart from politics.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;We went from the highs of 2020—the Bernie campaign, the BLM uprising—to the left almost becoming a ghost, a phantom. And so I think there is a process that is really rebuilding brick by brick, not taking any shortcuts—and we have to fucking keep Trump out. The history of the rise of fascism is not only a history of the power and organization of the fascist right; it&#39;s also a story of fragmentation and refusal to make coalition on the antifascist left. It&#39;s very important to pledge to one another that we&#39;re not going to repeat those errors. It doesn&#39;t mean line up and be a good Biden soldier and don&#39;t say what you know. It&#39;s organize and push him and stop the fascist. ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;q81lvj&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot;

>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;On a hot day in May, 2022, Ron Klain, who was then President Joe Biden&#39;s chief of staff, found himself in the midst of a joyous crowd at the Tufts University commencement, and railed at the heavens. “&lt;em>;Why aren&#39;t we receiving any credit for making this possible?&lt;/em>; ” he thought, according to an account in “The Last Politician,” a new book about the Biden Administration, by Franklin Foer. The pandemic was finally in abeyance: students were gathering with their families, and, as Klain saw it, the “whole nation could rush to see &lt;em>;Top Gun: Maverick&lt;/em>; in theaters thanks to the White House.” But Biden&#39;s approval rating was around forty per cent—about the same as Donald Trump&#39;s. Klain found it “darkly humorous” that the public got so worked up about problems like the baby-formula shortage but didn&#39;t applaud when the Administration would “drop everything” to deal with them. To him, it seemed terribly unfair.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;And yet when voters went to the polls several months later, in midterm elections that were expected to be a brutal rebuke to the Administration, Democrats held on to the Senate and only narrowly lost the House. Foer&#39;s book ends with the midterms, so it is imbued with a sense of vindication. Biden, it argues, proves the doubters wrong.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Perhaps so, but the midterms are beginning to feel like a long time ago. Unemployment is low and inflation has eased, but it would be perilous to consider this a period of ascendance for Biden, or to be all that confident about the 2024 election. Foer writes, by way of praising the President&#39;s political instincts, that in the 2022 midterms he “desperately wanted to avoid a referendum on his performance,” given his unpopularity, and that he encouraged Democrats to focus instead on the extremism of “ultra-&lt;em >;MAGA&lt;/em>;” Republicans. Such a dodge is a lot harder in a Presidential election, even though his opponent will most likely be the ultra-ultra-&lt;em >;MAGA&lt;/em>; Republican himself, Trump. Biden&#39;s favorability ratings are about the same now, after Trump&#39;s fourth criminal indictment, as they were a year ago.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Surveys released last week suggest further reasons for Democrats to worry. An analysis of &lt;em>;Times&lt;/em>;/Siena College polls found a sharp drop in support for the President among Black and Hispanic voters, particularly younger ones. A CNN poll, meanwhile, showed Biden not only trailing Trump, among registered voters, but behind or tied with every other major Republican contender, except Vivek Ramaswamy. What&#39;s more, only thirty-six per cent of Biden supporters said that they were more “for Joe Biden” than “against Donald Trump.” Trump supporters had a different answer: sixty-two per cent were “for” him, which may reflect a different degree of commitment.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The poll numbers are a reminder that the Biden boosters may be missing something. There are clear sources of discontent: the dearth of affordable housing; problems managing the influx of migrants; the surge in fentanyl use, which pushed the number of overdose deaths above a hundred thousand in 2021; fear of crime; economic stress; the mental-health crisis among young people. (For that matter, the baby-formula shortage persists, to some extent.) And when Democrats in the CNN poll were asked their biggest concern about Biden “as a candidate,” half of them mentioned his age—he turns eighty-one this year—and another twenty per cent mentioned related issues, such as mental competence and health.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Those results are in line with a &lt;em>;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em>; poll in which seventy-three per cent of registered voters said that Biden is too old to run again. Only forty-seven per cent said the same of Trump, even though he is just three years younger than Biden. More than sixty per cent had doubts about whether Biden was “mentally up for” the job; the number was forty-six per cent for Trump. Both men&#39;s ages add two somewhat paradoxical factors to the political equation: a sense that the country is stuck in a loop (with the same characters contending for the same offices) and that our institutions are unstable (with the possibility that upheaval is only one medical incident away).&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;There is also the matter of Hunter Biden, the President&#39;s son. Polls indicate that the GOP&#39;s focus on him is beginning to gain traction with some voters. The problem is not imaginary: a special counsel, David Weiss, is assigned to the case, and he has said in court filings that he expects to bring at least one indictment against Hunter Biden in the next few weeks, connected to the purchase of a gun while he was addicted to crack cocaine, with more, on tax charges, likely to follow, and potentially more after that, perhaps related to foreign lobbying. A plea agreement fell apart after a judge found it questionable. Republicans have alleged political interference on Hunter&#39;s behalf, a claim that the Justice Department has publicly denied. Last month, Kevin McCarthy, the Speaker of the House, called an impeachment inquiry “a natural step forward.” Hunter Biden is not the candidate, and his legal issues are still minuscule compared with Trump&#39;s, but they don&#39;t help.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Foer, in calling Biden the “last politician,” relies on a narrow definition of politics which is distinctly Washingtonian, involving mediation, tolerance, rules, and acceptance of defeat. It is manifest in backroom negotiations of the sort that ultimately yielded the Inflation Reduction Act. Politics, in this sense, is Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo helping to bring Senator Joe Manchin back to the negotiating table by serving him and Klain a dinner of eggplant parm, roast pork, and cannoli. (Manchin likes Italian food.) But that anecdote is also a reminder of what has changed since the midterms: Manchin is now openly contemplating a third-party Presidential bid.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Still, the Inflation Reduction Act includes unprecedented support for green energy and a climate transition. Such investments, as they pay off, could give Biden more to run on. After all, he is not lacking in ways to differentiate himself from Trump. A key factor in the unexpected outcome of the midterms was the rage of women voters at the Supreme Court&#39;s Dobbs decision, in June, 2022, which overturned Roe v. Wade. That anger remains.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Biden is not the last politician, though he may be among the last of a certain kind. Trump is a politician, too—with his rallies and his appeals to crowds, the raw tools of the political trade—and a very dangerous one. Politics can be both its most compelling and its ugliest when people feel that they are shut out. Ultimately, in the United States, politics is about gaining power at the polls. Winning bureaucratic, legislative, or even legal battles is not the same as winning the country. And Biden has a real fight ahead of him. ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;a44gtd&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot;

>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;In April, Janet Protasiewicz, a circuit-court judge in Milwaukee, was elected to the Wisconsin Supreme Court, shifting its balance of power to a 4–3 liberal majority. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/a-liberal-victory-in-wisconsin&quot;>;Her victory&lt;/a>; holds enormous implications for abortion rights, labor unions, voting rights, and, perhaps, the integrity of the 2024 Presidential election. (In 2020, the court ruled, by a single vote, against former President Donald Trump&#39;s demand to throw out more than two hundred thousand ballots from the state&#39;s two most populous Democratic counties; Joe Biden won Wisconsin by a tenth of that margin.) Protasiewicz&#39;s place on the court might also mean the end of the extreme partisan &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-political-scene/a-high-stakes-election-in-the-midwests-democracy-desert&quot;>;gerrymandering&lt;/a>; that for the past twelve years has made Republican control of the Wisconsin statehouse virtually impregnable. The issue was central to Protasiewicz&#39;s campaign; at a candidate forum, she called the state&#39;s district maps “rigged.” “They do not reflect people in this state,” she said. “I can&#39;t tell you what I would do on a particular case, but I can tell you my values. And the maps are wrong.” She later said that she would “enjoy taking a fresh look at the gerrymandering question.” Protasiewicz won by eleven points, a landslide in Wisconsin.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Her comments enraged Republicans, who are now threatening to impeach Protasiewicz if she does not recuse herself from two lawsuits challenging the maps. Only one official in the state&#39;s history has been impeached, and that was in 1853. (Levi Hubbell, a judge, was accused of taking bribes; he was acquitted by the state Senate.) Wisconsin&#39;s constitution sets a high bar for impeachment, reserving it for “corrupt conduct in office, or for crimes and misdemeanors.” But on August 11th, ten days after Protasiewicz was sworn in, Robin Vos, the Speaker of the Assembly, said, on a conservative talk-radio show, “You cannot have a judge who said, you know, the maps are rigged.” He went on, “Then she sits on that trial acting like she&#39;s gonna listen and hear both sides fairly? That just can&#39;t happen.” Last Tuesday, at a news conference, Vos reiterated his threat to pursue impeachment.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Republicans in the Assembly, who have sixty-four of the chamber&#39;s ninety-nine seats, need only a simple majority to impeach Protasiewicz. A trial would then be held in the Senate, which requires a vote with a two-thirds majority—the exact proportion currently held by Republicans—to convict. If Protasiewicz is impeached, she would be barred from performing her duties while awaiting the trial. Some political observers have suggested that the Senate may delay holding one, which would leave Protasiewicz powerless and the court ideologically deadlocked. Others have suggested that Republicans may try to convict her by December 1st; Wisconsin&#39;s Democratic governor, Tony Evers, could appoint a replacement—who would serve only until the next judicial election, which is in April, on the same date as the state&#39;s Republican Presidential primary. (If Protasiewicz is convicted after December 1st, a replacement would serve until 2031.)&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Robert Yablon, a professor of law at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, who has examined judicial impeachments across the country, has found no record of any judge in American history being impeached for failing to recuse herself owing to campaign activities, including statements made on the trail. He noted a 2002 US Supreme Court case, whose majority opinion was written by Antonin Scalia, that gives wide latitude to judicial candidates to speak on political issues. Nor has Yablon found a judge who has been removed before hearing a single case. “This is a very vivid illustration of the kind of minoritarian rule that a gerrymander can get you,” he said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The Princeton Gerrymandering Project has determined that Wisconsin&#39;s Senate is the most gerrymandered legislative body in the United States, with a partisan bias favoring Republicans by nearly twenty percentage points. The current districts are based on maps drawn in 2011, after Scott Walker won the governorship and Republicans took control of both houses in the legislature. Since then, Republicans have always won at least sixty of the state&#39;s ninety-nine Assembly seats, even when Democrats have won well over half of the aggregate statewide vote. In 2021, the Wisconsin Supreme Court, then controlled by conservatives, mandated that new maps, which are required by law to be created every ten years, adhere to a novel “least-change” standard, cementing GOP control of the legislature, theoretically in perpetuity—at least until the election of Protasiewicz.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Dan Knodl, a Republican assemblyman who won a narrow race, in April, to fill a vacant seat in the state&#39;s Senate, floated the idea of impeaching Protasiewicz even before she was elected. Knodl&#39;s victory gave Republicans the supermajority they would need to convict her. But the next day, Devin LeMahieu, the majority leader in the Senate, shot down the idea of impeachment. “For impeachment to succeed, there has to be a serious crime, a misdemeanor, something like that, and it shouldn&#39;t be used as a tool to overturn elections,” he told a reporter. On Thursday, though, LeMahieu appeared to be coming around. “We have a justice that has prejudged a case,” he said on TV. “She said the maps are rigged.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;State Democrats, meanwhile, are apoplectic about Protasiewicz&#39;s potential removal. This week, Ben Wikler, the chair of the state&#39;s Democratic Party, announced a four-million-dollar outreach campaign, called Defend Justice, to try to head off an impeachment. “This is a fundamental threat to the American system of government,” Wikler told me. “Essentially what Republicans are proposing to do is end judicial independence by sidelining or removing a judge based on their opposition to the decision that they think she would make. That has no precedent in the state of Wisconsin and would be a warning shot for every other judge in every other state. If Republicans do this, they will have created a new mechanism to short-circuit the judiciary.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In a motion for Protasiewicz&#39;s recusal, Republicans cite Caperton v. Massey, a 2009 case involving a recusal dispute in West Virginia. A justice on the state&#39;s Supreme Court had cast the deciding vote in overturning liability damages owed by a coal company; the justice&#39;s election campaign had been funded primarily by the company&#39;s CEO The US Supreme Court ruled that, because there was a “serious risk of actual bias,” the justice was required to recuse himself. At the same time, Anthony Kennedy, writing for the majority, emphasized that the facts in the case were highly specific. “It was one of a kind,” Yablon, the law professor, told me. In the fourteen years since the decision, he hasn&#39;t found a single state or federal court that has ruled against a judge for failing to recuse from a case in which a litigant supported a campaign financially.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Nevertheless, Republicans in Wisconsin—and one of Protasiewicz&#39;s conservative colleagues on the court—have argued that, because Protasiewicz&#39;s campaign received ten million dollars from the Democratic Party, she has a personal stake in the outcome of the two redistricting cases coming before the court. The Democratic Party, however, is not a petitioner in either one. (During the campaign, Protasiewicz promised to recuse herself from any case in which they were.)&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Wisconsin has unusually lax recusal and campaign-finance rules, which were entirely crafted by Republican politicians and conservative justices. In 2007, when Chief Justice Annette Ziegler first ran for a seat on the court, Wisconsin Manufacturers &amp;amp; Commerce, the state&#39;s largest business lobby, spent more than two million dollars on ads supporting her campaign. Despite calls for her to recuse herself from cases involving the organization, she has declined to do so. Two years after she was elected, WMC, along with the Wisconsin Realtors Association, drafted the court&#39;s recusal language, which was adopted, verbatim, by the court&#39;s conservative majority, including Ziegler. The rules explicitly state that judges who have received campaign contributions from a person or party involved in a case are not required to recuse themselves. (In 2008, Ziegler became the first sitting Supreme Court justice in the state&#39;s history to be reprimanded by her colleagues for not recusing; as a circuit judge, she had presided over eleven cases involving a bank for which her husband was a board member.) In 2017, a panel of fifty-four retired state judges petitioned the court to tighten its recusal rules. Ziegler and the four other conservatives on the court ruled against the recommendations. By then, Republicans in the legislature, led by Robin Vos, had already gutted the state&#39;s campaign-finance laws. Among the changes: political parties were now allowed to make unlimited donations to candidates for the state Supreme Court.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Critics of the effort to impeach Protasiewicz have noted additional instances of hypocrisy. Two of the three conservatives on the court have received financial support from the Republican Party; neither recused themselves from the redistricting case that established the “least-change” standard, despite its potential benefit to Republicans. According to the Wisconsin Democracy Campaign, a nonpartisan watchdog, a dark-money group called Wisconsin Alliance for Reform spent more than two million dollars supporting the election of the conservative justice Rebecca Bradley; Eric O&#39;Keefe, who has been the treasurer of that group, was a named petitioner in the 2021 “least-change” case.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The recusal question has come up with regard to other issues, too. Wisconsin is currently operating under a law passed in 1849 that effectively bans nearly all abortions. Bradley has compared abortion to the Holocaust. Brian Hagedorn, another conservative justice on the court, once described Planned Parenthood as a “wicked organization more committed to killing babies than to helping women.” Both have rejected calls to recuse themselves from abortion cases. (A legal challenge to the 1849 law is expected to reach the court this term.)&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The looming threat of Protasiewicz&#39;s impeachment is the latest in a series of anti-democratic Republican interventions in Wisconsin&#39;s civic infrastructure. Republican lawmakers have also enacted one of the strictest voter-ID laws in the country; stripped the governor and the attorney general of significant powers, during a lame-duck session, after those offices were won by Democrats; and sanctioned a sprawling and baseless &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/08/01/will-wisconsins-republicans-make-voting-meaningless-or-just-difficult&quot;>;taxpayer-funded investigation&lt;/a>; into the integrity of that election and the officials who administered it. Senate Republicans are attempting to oust Meagan Wolfe, the administrator of the Wisconsin Elections Commission. In August, Knodl held a hearing that featured a parade of election conspiracy theorists, including Peter Bernegger, a convicted felon (mail and bank fraud) and self-styled election expert who was recently warned by police that his behavior toward Wolfe “could be interpreted as &#39;stalking&#39; under state law.” At the hearing, Bernegger said, “I don&#39;t call for Meagan Wolfe&#39;s ouster, I call for her arrest,” to loud applause.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Meanwhile, the gap between the GOP and a majority of the Wisconsin electorate continues to widen. Since 2018, Republicans have lost fourteen of seventeen statewide races. No one appears angrier and more defiant than Vos, the most powerful Republican politician in state government. Vos, who was college roommates with Reince Priebus, one of Trump&#39;s former White House chiefs of staff, joined the legislature in 2005 and rose to prominence a few years later by helping to pass Act 10, a law that demolished collective-bargaining rights for public employees in the state. He has been speaker for the past decade, during which he has earned a reputation for being an unrelenting partisan. (In 2019, he refused to allow a quadriplegic Democratic legislator to phone in to committee meetings.) After the 2020 election, Trump pressured him to initiate an investigation into the election. Still, Trump backed a fringe candidate in the 2022 primaries to run against Vos, who was nearly defeated.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Dale Schultz, a former Republican state senator and majority leader, told me that he is unsurprised by Vos&#39;s latest effort to cling to power. Schultz, who belongs to a slice of the electorate that helped give Protasiewicz her eleven-point victory in an evenly divided state, fell out with Republicans after he refused to support Act 10 and cast the deciding vote against a law that would permit an enormous open-pit iron-ore mine in the state&#39;s most pristine watershed. (It was later passed.) He eventually retired and went on to co-lead, with a Democratic former majority leader, a barnstorming effort for fair election maps. He is fatigued and repelled by his party&#39;s fixation on power politics. “This is a desperate attempt to hang on to gains that were achieved by mechanically adjusting democracy,” he said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;What seems to dismay him most is the unwillingness of Republican lawmakers to challenge their leaders who are pushing the impeachment. “People are just paralyzed in the status quo,” he said. “There was a time in this state when people took enormous pride in their independence. They didn&#39;t want to be ceding to other people their right to think for themselves—and their ability to do things for their constituents. Now I don&#39;t know what we pay these birds for.” ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;f4j918&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;59ky2h&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 10 Sep 2023 19:06:01 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[A Departure from Reality, by Viet Thanh Nguyen]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-weekend-essay/a-departure-from-reality-viet-thanh-nguyen]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-09T10:00:00.000Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64fc752fa224c2af71e77eee/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/vtn3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;article >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attribute-verso-pattern=&quot;article-body&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;ArticlePageChunks&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;In order to re member yourself and your mother, you examine the paper fragments of your past. Sometime before the fall of 1990, you visit your mother in what you remember as the Asian Pacific Psychiatric Ward. In a fitful, fragmentary journal you keep in college, you describe yourself as feeling&lt;/p>;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;align-right&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:align-right&quot;>;&lt;p >;numb.&lt;/p>;&lt;/inline-embed>;&lt;p >;Your older brother, the medical student, calls your mother&#39;s affliction a&lt;/p>;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;align-right&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:align-right&quot;>;&lt;p >;neurosis.&lt;/p>;&lt;/inline-embed>;&lt;p >;A dictionary calls a neurosis&lt;/p>;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;align-right&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:align-right&quot;>;&lt;p >;a relatively mild mental illness&lt;/p>;&lt;/inline-embed>;&lt;p >;but not&lt;/p>;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;align-right&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:align-right&quot;>;&lt;p >;a radical loss of touch with reality.&lt;/p>;&lt;/inline-embed>;&lt;p >;Really? You perceive this ward, its patients, and your mother as&lt;/p>;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;align-right&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:align-right&quot;>;&lt;p >;insane.&lt;/p>;&lt;/inline-embed>;&lt;p >;None of the patients, your mother included, appears to be a member of your reality. Seven or eight months later, while you are a sophomore at Berkeley, you try to write about the Asian Pacific Psychiatric Ward in a seminar led by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/06/08/maxine-hong-kingstons-genre-defying-life-and-work&quot;>;Maxine Hong Kingston&lt;/a>;. In your essay, you describe how a woman named Trinh rolls on the floor before a ward attendant, a Black woman, gently picks her up. Then&lt;/p>;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;align-right&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:align-right&quot;>;&lt;p >;Trinh stands in the middle of the floor before us. Her&lt;br/>;language is a mixture of Vietnamese and baby talk and&lt;br/>;maybe something of her own thrown in. She gapes out the&lt;br/>;window. She begins clapping her hands and singing in a&lt;br/>;disjointed, breathless way, like a child singing too eagerly.&lt;/p>;&lt;/inline-embed>;&lt;p >;You put away the essay and do not look at it again for thirty years. When you finally dare to read it again, it might as well be fiction. You have no memory now of this scene or the fact that most of the patients are Asian and Vietnamese. But you possess a vague image of the ward, because Má returns in 2005 when she embarks on her final departure from your reality. What you mostly recall from 1990 is your discomfort among these patients, your shock and terror that your mother is here. She is not herself. Or perhaps she is herself. Herself as another. As your Other.&lt;/p>;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;align-right&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:align-right&quot;>;&lt;p >;A white patient walks by, one of the few&lt;br/>;white people in this ward. She says, “Tell your mother not to&lt;br/>;worry about dying. We all felt that way when we first&lt;br/>;got here. We all get over it.” I nod at her to&lt;br/>;recognize that she exists.&lt;/p>;&lt;/inline-embed>;&lt;p >;The patients do not exist for much of the world outside the ward. This is perhaps especially true for the Asian patients, coming from people, such as your own, who rarely, if ever, discuss mental illness. Embarrassing. Shameful. You do not feel this way, but you can write about Má&#39;s voyage into surreality only now that she has died.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;And what right have you to do even that?&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;But perhaps you tell this story so you&lt;br/>;can recognize that your mother&lt;br/>;existed, exists, in all her selves, and&lt;br/>;that she was not and is not alone.&lt;/p>;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;align-center&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:align-center&quot;>;&lt;p >;•&lt;/p>;&lt;/inline-embed>;&lt;p >;You do not recall what brought her to the Asian Pacific Psychiatric Ward until you read the words you wrote as a nineteen-year-old:&lt;/p>;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;align-right&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:align-right&quot;>;&lt;p >;Someone out there—if not everyone—is trying to kill her.&lt;br/>;They crawl through the sewer and emerge through the&lt;br/>;toilet. She was waiting for them, locked in the bathroom,&lt;br/>;when my father decided enough was enough and&lt;br/>;knocked a hole in the door to reach her.&lt;br/>;It was my bathroom.&lt;/p>;&lt;/inline-embed>;&lt;p >;If you cannot remember this, why do you remember the reverse, the night Má chases Ba into the other bathroom in the hallway? When Ba locks himself inside, Má smashes holes into the door with a chair, all the shouting in Vietnamese you don&#39;t understand.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Ba, so fastidious about everything, so protective of you, never letting you hang your arm through the open car window because, he says, you will lose it in a car accident—this Ba never bothers to fix or replace the door Má has smashed. Although you remember how the gaping holes in the bathroom door reveal its hollowness for the rest of your years in that brown house, you possess no image of sitting with your mother in the ward.&lt;/p>;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;align-right&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:align-right&quot;>;&lt;p >;She recognized me, but I was no more important in&lt;br/>;her world than the rest of the ugly furniture. She looked&lt;br/>;ahead at the opposite wall. Her mouth remained slightly&lt;br/>;open, her eyes slightly glazed, but she didn&#39;t move.&lt;/p>;&lt;/inline-embed>;&lt;p >;Is this the same gaze you will see years later in the memory-care unit?&lt;/p>;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;align-right&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:align-right&quot;>;&lt;p >;She wouldn&#39;t hug us or touch us, but instead shied away&lt;br/>;like a timid child. She stood on the middle of the floor&lt;br/>;and smiled vacantly as we said goodbye.&lt;/p>;&lt;/inline-embed>;&lt;p >;You believe that these things happened, even if you cannot re member them, including how Má ignores the grapes and orange juice Ba has brought, and, while Ba talks to a social worker,&lt;/p>;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;align-right&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:align-right&quot;>;&lt;p >;the tears started to come from me and I got up before anybody&lt;br/>;saw me crying, because nobody had seen me cry since the&lt;br/>;sixth grade. I walked into the bathroom without saying&lt;br/>;anything to her, but I don&#39;t think she noticed anyway.&lt;br/>;I locked myself in the bathroom stall, and&lt;br/>;my first sob made me gasp.&lt;/p>;&lt;/inline-embed>;&lt;p >;You do not remember fleeing from Ban Mê Thuột and Sài Gòn because you were only four, but why can you not re member these things from your late teen years? You do not remember your (adopted) sister, twelve years your senior, who stayed to look after the house when the rest of you fled, but why can you not re member yourself? You have been dis membered and disremembered, by Hollywood and colonialism and racism, yes, but also by no one other than you.&lt;/p>;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;align-center&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:align-center&quot;>;&lt;p >;•&lt;/p>;&lt;/inline-embed>;&lt;p >;What you finally re member, provoked by these paper fragments, is this:&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Throughout your childhood and adolescence, Ba Má want to shape you into a moral, hardworking, upstanding, one-hundred-per-cent Vietnamese Catholic. You disagree with their intention, but you respect them. They are not hypocrites. They never deviate from their moral beliefs, their grinding work schedules at their grocery store, the SàiGòn Mới of San Jose, California, their nightly ritual of the Rosary, their weekly attendance at Mass, which, on retirement, becomes daily.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;But they verge on fanaticism. During your summer working in Santa Clara on the rides at Great America, when you are sixteen, you buy a pair of gray checkered pants with your own money from the teen fashion department at Macy&#39;s in Eastridge Mall. You roll up the hems and twist them tight around the ankle. You can never imagine wearing pants any other way, especially like those poor adults—your teachers—in their baggy chinos.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Má sees these checkered pants as the sort that delinquent Vietnamese refugee youth wear as they smoke, hang out with the opposite sex, do poorly in school, style their hair into outrageous heights, and go to night clubs and garage parties, all that is good and fun in your mind and wild and destructive in Má&#39;s imagination. She berates you, says you are not respectable and proper, that you are dooming your future. She orders you to return the pants. You do.&lt;/p>;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;align-right&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:align-right&quot;>;&lt;p >;And seethe.&lt;/p>;&lt;/inline-embed>;&lt;p >;The lesson you learn is the need to keep a secret life. You are already adept at secrecy and silence. In Ba Má&#39;s house in San Jose, you are an American spying on them. Outside their house, you are a Vietnamese spying on Americans and their strange ways and customs, including the forbidden, fantastic world of dating, seen in John Hughes movies like “Pretty in Pink” and “Weird Science” and “Some Kind of Wonderful.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Then you meet J at Great America. She lives fifty-six miles away from San Jose. To see her, you take a bus and then &lt;em >;BART&lt;/em>;, a trip of three hours each way. You sell your beloved comic-book collection to pay your long-distance phone bill. You maintain the secrecy for three years, until you run out of money and start calling J on Ba Má&#39;s phone bill. On January 4, 1990, Má says:&lt;/p>;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;align-right&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:align-right&quot;>;&lt;p >;“Your father doesn&#39;t even buy himself&lt;br/>;ten-dollar shirts. He wears your and your brother&#39;s&lt;br/>;hand-me-downs. Now, every time you call, he has to&lt;br/>;pay ten or twenty or thirty dollars.”&lt;br/>;And she cries.&lt;/p>;&lt;/inline-embed>;&lt;p >;By January 9th, your parents find your letters from J and your photos with her under your bed. You never see them again. You are outraged at this violation of your possessions, your memories, your affection for J, your chance to live your life like the white teen-agers in the movies. Ba Má are incensed because, all of a sudden, they discover that their quiet, sullen, usually obedient, vulnerable boy, not yet a man in their eyes, has been lying to them. And worse—is becoming someone they don&#39;t even know. You write:&lt;/p>;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;align-right&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:align-right&quot;>;&lt;p >;Mom threatened to have a heart attack.&lt;/p>;&lt;/inline-embed>;&lt;p >;Ba Má demand that you end the relationship. You have no car, no money, no guts, and you owe your parents loyalty and love. So you tell Ba Má you will not see J again, although you keep seeing J. You have become used to living a secret life, with two faces and two selves, only one of which you reveal to Ba Má. What harm does it do them if they don&#39;t know of your other life? You avoid thinking about what harm it does to J, who tolerates the situation. Your mother and father compromise in their own way. They offer to set you up with nice Vietnamese Catholic girls. The last thing you want is a nice Vietnamese Catholic girl.&lt;/p>;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;align-right&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:align-right&quot;>;&lt;p >;Eventually, though, you marry a nice Vietnamese Catholic girl—Lan,&lt;br/>;who is also so much more. But, like you, she knows how&lt;br/>;to wear the appropriate face for certain occasions.&lt;br/>;Not a false face. Just the right face.&lt;/p>;&lt;/inline-embed>;&lt;p >;Then, even though you will forget it, even though you have forgotten about it, on February 18, 1990, five weeks after learning about your secret romance with J, Má departs from reality and enters the Asian Pacific Psychiatric Ward, a fate arguably worse than a heart attack.&lt;/p>;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;align-right&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:align-right&quot;>;&lt;p >;Correlation? Or&lt;br/>;cause and effect?&lt;/p>;&lt;/inline-embed>;&lt;p >;You don&#39;t know, but, in Kingston&#39;s seminar in the fall of 1990, you try to get to the center between your two selves, try to get to the crossing between reality and surreality, try to re member what you have already begun to disremember. One of your other writing teachers, Bharati Mukherjee, reads your work and says you need to&lt;/p>;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;align-right&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:align-right&quot;>;&lt;p >;Cut to the bone.&lt;/p>;&lt;/inline-embed>;&lt;p >;No one can teach you how to do that. You will have to teach yourself.&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;As for your journal, you will not write another entry until October 6, 1991. It will be your final entry in this belated, fitful attempt to be a writer. Its last word?&lt;/p>;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;align-right&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:align-right&quot;>;&lt;p >;Guilt.&lt;/p>;&lt;/inline-embed>;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;align-center&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:align-center&quot;>;&lt;p >;•&lt;/p>;&lt;/inline-embed>;&lt;p >;Má recovers. Comes home. Returns to work at the SàiGòn Mới, open every day of the week, nearly every day of the year. Does not return to the Asian Pacific Psychiatric Ward for another fifteen years. You continue keeping secrets from her and Ba, a double life not atypical of immigrant and refugee children, or so you tell yourself.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Ba Má want to protect you from dangers you do not see; you want to protect them from knowledge they do not need. And they must own secrets you do not even know about. Isn&#39;t a true secret, by definition, something whose existence is not known? As for you, which secrets are worst? Being an atheist? Reading Marxist theory? Getting arrested? Seeing J for ten more years until the relationship ends?&lt;/p>;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;align-right&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:align-right&quot;>;&lt;p >;ie,&lt;br/>;that is,&lt;br/>;in other words,&lt;br/>;she dumps your sorry ass.&lt;/p>;&lt;/inline-embed>;&lt;p >;J refuses to be your secret any longer. She doesn&#39;t need to be with a person too weak to stand up on her behalf, content to live a double life that she did not ask for. When does duality become duplicitousness? When does having two selves lead not to double vision but to self-deception? The last time you see her is at her wedding to a Vietnamese groom. At least you did not ruin all Vietnamese people for her.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;You marry Lan. Although the most important thing about her to Ba Má is that she is a Vietnamese Catholic from a good family, the most important thing about Lan is that she is a poet, as well as beautiful. Your delighted parents pay for the very loud wedding, held in a Chinese banquet hall with the same elaborate ten-course Chinese meal served at every Vietnamese wedding, a bottle of Hennessy cognac on every table for the four hundred guests, most of whom you do not know. No one expects you to enjoy your own wedding. What a Western idea!&lt;/p>;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;align-center&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:align-center&quot;>;&lt;p >;•&lt;/p>;&lt;/inline-embed>;&lt;p >;For seven months in 2003, from summer to winter, you and Lan stay in the Eleventh Arrondissement of Paris, where English is rarely heard and Americans are rarely seen, a few steps from Métro Voltaire. You are newly married, and you have just been tenured.

No Haussmannian splendor and no elevator, but you and Lan are young and in love, with only one suitcase each.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;If going to Paris, a city famous for its writers, is a literary pilgrimage for you, Ba Má visit you in Paris that fall intent on a religious pilgrimage. They have retired from the brutal schedule of the SàiGòn Mới, and this is their idea of a good time: visiting the major Catholic shrines of Western Europe. Over five days, you escort them to Lourdes in southwestern France and Fátima in Portugal, with a stop in London. You pack a bottle of whiskey to relieve the stress, but are proud of yourself for orchestrating this vacation of a lifetime for Ba Má.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;1cfysh&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;This is their fourth international voyage. Their first was fleeing their homeland. If forced migrations make a person cosmopolitan, then refugees and migrants would be considered some of the world&#39;s best-travelled people. They are far worldlier than those who never leave their country of birth and yet look down on these voyagers whose odds of surviving their journey are as bad as or worse than those of astronauts.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Astronauts eventually return to Earth. But cosmonauts like Ba Má permanently escape the gravity of home.&lt;/p>;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;align-right&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:align-right&quot;>;&lt;p >;Is this the root of your own willingness to leave home?&lt;br/>;San Jose too small for you?&lt;/p>;&lt;/inline-embed>;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;align-right&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:align-right&quot;>;&lt;p >;Nostalgia is, literally, homesickness,&lt;br/>;with those afflicted yearning for&lt;br/>;their home. But what to call&lt;br/>;being sick of home?&lt;/p>;&lt;/inline-embed>;&lt;p >;For devout Catholics, the real home is not Earth but Heaven, their longing for it perpetual. How else to ascend and fulfill that desire but by becoming a one-way cosmonaut, voyager, risktaker? Nothing riskier than faith in what cannot be seen, heard, touched.&lt;/p>;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;align-right&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:align-right&quot;>;&lt;p >;Your parents call their object of faith God.&lt;br/>;You call yours justice.

Tourist shops sell crucifixes of every size, plates adorned with the Pope, Virgin Mary statues, snow globes, and lockets. You buy a cologne-size bottle of holy water for your father-in-law. Your parents bathe in this holy water while you wait outside the baths.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Fátima impresses you with its severity. Nestled in green mountains and supposedly named after a Moorish princess kidnapped by a Christian knight, Fátima commemorates other Virgin Mary sightings. Visitors approach a grand basilica with a towering spire by crossing an expansive square. Those desperate for the Virgin Mary&#39;s help shuffle across the square on their knees. In grimmer days, the knees of the faithful would be bloody and bruised. Now the pilgrims can wear kneepads. Ba Má pray at Fátima but do not crawl. They do not need a miracle. They have already saved themselves, with the aid of the US government and God.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;You never tell Ba Má you are an atheist because you do not want to upset them. Protecting Ba Má is how you show you love them, even if they do not know it, even as you do not remember all the unspoken ways they love you. Being their tour guide is another way of showing love. Ba Má put themselves in your care as someone finally an adult. Getting married is the first real sign of your adulthood. Grandchildren are what they want next, but fatherhood terrifies you.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;You buy yourself time with this pilgrimage. Surprisingly, you enjoy yourself, happy to see Ba Má delighted as you escort them to the Eiffel Tower and Versailles, Buckingham Palace and the Tower of London. Ba Má prefer the cleanliness of London over the dirtiness of Paris. In the Paris Métro, Má laughs recalling how, as a girl, she rode the bus without a fare, hiding underneath a seat.&lt;/p>;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;align-right&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:align-right&quot;>;&lt;p >;Years later, you will understand this memory when&lt;br/>;you take an oversold night train through central&lt;br/>;Việt Nam, third class, kids sleeping under your wooden&lt;br/>;bench, a stranger dozing on a stool in the aisle,&lt;br/>;forehead against your chest.&lt;/p>;&lt;/inline-embed>;&lt;p >;Your terror of fatherhood comes partly from seeing what motherhood inflicts on Má. The mother of your childhood wields a beautiful smile. She loves to adorn herself. She is statuesque and elegant, authoritative and powerful. The SàiGòn Mới exhausts her, ages her, diminishes her.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;But this pilgrimage signals the end of&lt;br/>;sacrifice. The war years, long past.&lt;br/>;SàiGòn Mới, no more.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;You will take them to all the Catholic shrines in the world. You might even go back with them to Việt Nam, to re member.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;It is the fall of 2003. Má is healthy.&lt;br/>;Neither of you know that in two years&lt;br/>;nothing will be the same, ever again,&lt;br/>;for her. Or you.

You are me, but seen from a slight distance, or the greatest distance, which is the space between one and one&#39;s self.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;You are my excuse to write about me, because I find myself too boring to go on about and also too frightening to think about.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Only through writing about you can I attempt to re member not only you but also myself. And, perhaps, in writing and re membering, you and me, engaged in this delicate dialectic, can become something greater than the sum of our disjointed parts.&lt;/p>;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;align-center&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:align-center&quot;>;&lt;p >;•&lt;/p>;&lt;/inline-embed>;&lt;p >;Ba no longer remembers Fátima and Lourdes, visits I now seize on as cherished memories of a time when Má inhabited this reality and I was a good son.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;What he does remember: Paris and London. And what he remembers most:&lt;/p>;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;align-right&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:align-right&quot;>;&lt;p >;Those curtains in that hotel room, he says wistfully.&lt;/p>;&lt;/inline-embed>;&lt;p >;The Marriott hotel where we stayed, near Big Ben, with its conjoining suites for Ba Má and for me, had floor-to-ceiling gold curtains.&lt;/p>;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;align-right&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:align-right&quot;>;&lt;p >;I modelled the curtains in the living room on them.&lt;/p>;&lt;/inline-embed>;&lt;p >;A tailor in his youth, Ba cut and sewed the curtains himself upon his return from London. Now, every morning and afternoon, he sits and naps on the plush brown leather sofa, hands clasped on his chest, illuminated by the soft golden light filtering through the closed curtains.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Sitting on that sofa, one sees on the opposite white wall the photos of Ba Má&#39;s fiftieth wedding anniversary, in 2004, coinciding with the fiftieth anniversary of the partition of Việt Nam, of the beginning of their refugee life together.&lt;/p>;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;align-right&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:align-right&quot;>;&lt;p >;Even as a country is divided, a future of blood&lt;br/>;foretold, marriage brings together two families&lt;br/>;and two lovers—a great detail for a novel!&lt;/p>;&lt;/inline-embed>;&lt;p >;During this anniversary, Ba wears a tan suit; Má, a golden áo dài. The presiding plump, pink-cheeked bishop of San Jose is ornately robed in his chasuble, bedecked with a mitre, and wielding a tall staff over his Vietnamese sheep.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;A year later, in December, 2005, during the Christmas holiday, I sit on this sofa, stunned. Something in Má has suddenly broken.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;There is no visible cause for this crack between our reality and her surreality. She was retired, enjoying her life: perfecting a handful of recipes, picking something different each day from her extensive wardrobe for the daily Mass she attended with Ba, taking pictures with her grandchildren. Now she is in a hospital, detained against her will and ours. I learn that doctors can put patients in a seventy-two-hour hold from which their loved ones cannot rescue them. This is one of the few facts I remember.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I do not keep a journal of this time.&lt;/p>;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;align-right&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:align-right&quot;>;&lt;p >;And I call myself a writer?&lt;/p>;&lt;/inline-embed>;&lt;p >;In the absence of words, my memory is blank.

Partly to protect you and me. Partly because remembering what I cannot remember would be an act of fiction rather than fact.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Fact: I am unable to recall what happened to Má, whether I was even there for her breakdown, what she looked like, how long she was in the hospital, or its name, or how she eventually returned to the same Asian Pacific Psychiatric Ward from so long ago.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The fact is that I also refuse to re member. I do not call my brother to ask for his help in sharpening my memory and my prose, the better to saw against&lt;/p>;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;align-right&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:align-right&quot;>;&lt;p >;bone.&lt;/p>;&lt;/inline-embed>;&lt;p >;I reject memory. I accept my amnesia. Because—fact—the Asian Pacific Psychiatric Ward is the most terrifying place I have ever been, and my mother&#39;s seventy-two-hour detention in that hospital is the most unsettling time of my life. I would trade parts of my body, even shorten my life, rather than be afflicted like the patients of that ward, like the people undergoing that detention.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Like Má.&lt;/p>;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;align-right&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:align-right&quot;>;&lt;p >;Forgetting the painful things is necessary for some&lt;br/>;of us. As long as we eventually simmer that&lt;br/>;bone that we cannot cut through. Have I&lt;br/>;simmered that bone enough? Can&lt;br/>;I taste that marrow of&lt;br/>;memory?&lt;/p>;&lt;/inline-embed>;&lt;p >;After the doctors release my mother from detention, after she leaves the Asian Pacific Psychiatric Ward, after we gather the legal documents Ba needs to control Má&#39;s fate, we deliver my mother to a nursing facility.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;My memory resumes at this halfway house between the surrealism of the Asian Pacific Psychiatric Ward and the realism of life with Má at home where she belongs. The nursing facility, neither luxurious nor cheap, resembles a hospital but is mostly a refrigerator to keep human beings alive until they are ready to die.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;ejla8ng&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;If a quiet library with towering walls of books and hushed patrons and my own leather armchair is my vision of eternal bliss, this refrigerator is, if not Hell, then a purgatory with tiled floors, brightly lit hallways, bland meals under plastic covers, incapacitated patients, the constant bustle of nurses, therapists, visitors, the buzz of televisions.&lt;/p>;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;align-right&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:align-right&quot;>;&lt;p >;I have never seen anyone&lt;br/>;reading a book in&lt;br/>;this purgatory.&lt;/p>;&lt;/inline-embed>;&lt;p >;Most of the staff, clad in nursing scrubs or polo shirts and chinos, are Filipinas. American colonization in the Philippines created this route for nurses to come to the United States, while draining the Philippines of its own medical professionals and depriving the children left behind of their mothers, exported to take care of others around the world.&lt;/p>;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;align-right&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:align-right&quot;>;&lt;p >;Where is the televised dramatic comedy about these&lt;br/>;women?

Old and ill, or old and dying. Occasionally, someone screams. I do not want to end up here.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;My mother stays for days, or weeks, or months. I can&#39;t remember.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;What I do re member is that this time is different from the other times.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;While driving my brother and father away from one visit with Má, I realize that Má will not get better. As they discuss Má&#39;s condition, I understand that Má will never descend from her surreality to our reality, except for occasional, brief visits. I am ambushed by myself, sobs and tears rupturing the wall that separates you and me, me and myself. It has been fourteen years since I was so waylaid by myself, when Má was in the Asian Pacific Psychiatric Ward the first time.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Neither my father nor brother says a word as I grip the wheel and struggle to see through tears.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I recover. I get hold of myself. I put you back where you belong.&lt;br/>;My father and brother resume their conversation. I&lt;br/>;resume driving.&lt;/p>;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;align-right&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:align-right&quot;>;&lt;p >;We never speak of this moment.&lt;/p>;&lt;/inline-embed>;&lt;p >;After the nursing facility releases Má, Ba brings her body home. But not her mind. Not fully. Her thoughts travel most of the time through a different, parallel universe. Still, she sometimes returns to our reality, enough to notice how Ba, beginning at age seventy-two, when he should be circumnavigating the world via Boeing, remains earthbound. Homebound. He cares for Má without complaint for the next ten years, ignoring entreaties from my brother and me to hire the help that he can easily afford.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;As a child, I watched Ba cook dinner, shop for groceries, vacuum the house. The typical Vietnamese man is allergic to these chores. This routine of mundane deeds, I understand later, is love.&lt;/p>;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;align-right&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:align-right&quot;>;&lt;p >;In 2012, the Austrian filmmaker Michael Haneke,&lt;br/>;whose work I admire, makes “Amour,” about a&lt;br/>;loving husband and wife in their eighties.&lt;br/>;A stroke disables the wife, leaving her&lt;br/>;helpless and in her husband&#39;s care. Out of&lt;br/>;deep love, he suffocates her, and he is&lt;br/>;then alone, perhaps even dead, &lt;br/>;in their Parisian apartment.&lt;/p>;&lt;/inline-embed>;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;align-right&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:align-right&quot;>;&lt;p >;Haneke.

Both know how to suffer and sacrifice, without the reward of recognition from anyone but their sons, without the drama of a murder-suicide or a crucifixion.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Má&#39;s many medications, arrayed in a repurposed cookie tin, prevent such theatrics. The meds calm her. Reduce the chance of self-harm. Keep her from breaking fully free from our reality. So tightly is she leashed in orbit that Má is very quiet, moves slowly, does little. But she recognizes me and Ellison, my son, and her other grandchildren, even if the glow of recognition quickly fades.&lt;/p>;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;align-right&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:align-right&quot;>;&lt;p >;Unlike Haneke&#39;s two-hour, seven-minute movie,&lt;br/>;this quiet play, as slow and puzzling as&lt;br/>;“Happy Days” by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tag/samuel-beckett&quot;>;Samuel Beckett&lt;/a>;,&lt;br/>;goes on for a decade.&lt;/p>;&lt;/inline-embed>;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;align-right&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:align-right&quot;>;&lt;p >;Beckett also wrote, in “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Unnamable-Howard-Hughes/dp/0571244645&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Unnamable-Howard-Hughes/dp/0571244645&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Unnamable-Howard-Hughes/dp/0571244645&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;The Unnamable&lt;/a>;,”&lt;br/>;You must go on, I can&#39;t go on, I&#39;ll go on.&lt;/p>;&lt;/inline-embed>;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;align-right&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:align-right&quot;>;&lt;p >;How appropriate for refugees, of whom&lt;br/>;Beckett was one.

She is as still as water in a plugged sink. Her pills don&#39;t always work. One day I learn that she has broken her arm by jumping on and then falling off her bed, or so the staff says. A doctor, whom I never see, adjusts her meds. Her arm, permanently injured, huddles against her body or floats by her side, useless.&lt;/p>;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;align-right&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:align-right&quot;>;&lt;p >;I cannot now re member if it is her left or right arm.&lt;/p>;&lt;/inline-embed>;&lt;p >;In 2018, Má&#39;s condition worsens. She needs X-rays, MRIs. The memory-care unit can no longer attend to her. She returns to the nursing facility, the setting for a horror movie more frightening than anything Hollywood can dream up. A Hollywood drama is finished in a couple of hours, but finishing off a human being can take much longer than that.

A middle-aged one with graying hair soon arrives in his black uniform with its white collar. He stands over Má&#39;s bed to bestow last rites, delivers the words in Vietnamese. I don&#39;t understand the words. Má doesn&#39;t open her eyes.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The rites are done in a few seconds, the priest present for a few minutes. I expect solemnity from the Vietnamese holy man, a pat on the shoulder for Ba, but the man offers no words of care, not even pretending to share in the sorrow of my father. The priest could have been washing dishes for all the feeling he exhibits as he makes the sign of the cross.&lt;/p>;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;align-right&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:align-right&quot;>;&lt;p >;Father.

And&lt;br/>;her ghost?&lt;/p>;&lt;/inline-embed>;&lt;p >;I expect more from this Vietnamese priest. But I say nothing. Ba is thankful, shakes the priest&#39;s hand, bows a little. If my father is grateful, who am I, the ingrate, to say anything. Perhaps when I am aged and shaky and vulnerable like Ba, I, too, will be grateful.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;We bring Má back to her suburban house. The vast, verdant lawn is now an expanse of dirt, Ba too tired and distracted to maintain it. I sleep in an upstairs bedroom, the same one I slept in the last two years of high school. It&#39;s December. The house is cool, especially the downstairs bedroom where Má sleeps. We wheel her rented hospital bed into the family room, with its television that has barely been watched since Má fell ill and the stereo system no one listened to even when Má was well. Background music is not a part of family life. The house is usually as silent as an empty church. There is no soundtrack as I watch December 22nd turn to December 23rd while Má takes her last breaths, thirteen years almost to the day from her final breakdown. Ba, my brother, my sister-in-law, and I are the only witnesses.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Má was born in 1937 as Nguyễn Thị Bãy, a poor girl in a poor northern Vietnamese village. She dies in 2018 as Linda Kim Nguyen, American citizen, traveller of a life both ordinary and epic.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;At seventeen, she married and became a refugee for the first time.&lt;/p>;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;align-right&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:align-right&quot;>;&lt;p >;At seventeen, I almost did not&lt;br/>;graduate from high school&lt;br/>;because I nearly failed&lt;br/>;precalculus.&lt;/p>;&lt;/inline-embed>;&lt;p >;At thirty-eight, a mother of two biological sons and one adopted daughter, Má became a refugee for the second time, her sequel starting in an alien country.&lt;/p>;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;align-right&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:align-right&quot;>;&lt;p >;At thirty-eight, I, with&lt;br/>;no children, struggled&lt;br/>;with writing a short&lt;br/>;story about Má.&lt;/p>;&lt;/inline-embed>;&lt;p >;Má&#39;s first name is Bãy. Giving children numbers as names was common in rural Việt Nam. Families often had so many children. Some would not survive. Why give a girl a real name?&lt;/p>;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;align-right&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:align-right&quot;>;&lt;p >;As a girl, the seventh child, she deserved no more.&lt;/p>;&lt;/inline-embed>;&lt;p >;Má hated this birth name. In her last decades, she wanted to be called by her American name, Linda. But both her names feel alien on my tongue. I never called her by her name, only Mẹ as a child, Má as an adult. Her refugee path shaped even what I called her. Northerners say Mẹ, southerners say Má, and I, as always, am somewhere in between.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Most Americans who met Má probably saw only her mortal, unextraordinary coil. If they knew anything about her, they might know she had been a shopkeeper, businesswoman, refugee. If they knew nothing about her, she was another Asian woman who did not speak good English. Mẹ, or Má, never wanted to mention that she had received only a grade-school education. I am telling on her, and yet she should be told on, even if it is not my secret to tell. Look at what Má accomplished with just a grade-school education, overcoming everything—almost everything—except her mind.&lt;/p>;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;align-right&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:align-right&quot;>;&lt;p >;Defeated, like so many&lt;br/>;heroes, not by others&lt;br/>;but by herself.&lt;/p>;&lt;/inline-embed>;&lt;p >;A hero but not a soldier. People like Má who will not be remembered by History are also a part of History, drafted as reluctant players in horrific wars. And the wars of the twentieth century—including the ones in Việt Nam—killed at least as many civilians as soldiers.&lt;/p>;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;align-right&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:align-right&quot;>;&lt;p >;Civilian stories can be war stories, too.&lt;/p>;&lt;/inline-embed>;&lt;p >;Perhaps what happened to my mother was simply her body and mind&#39;s fate. But History and war took their turns hammering Má. Unnerving her. Breaking her.&lt;/p>;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;align-right&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:align-right&quot;>;&lt;p >;My mother, child&lt;br/>;of colonization&lt;br/>;and war.&lt;/p>;&lt;/inline-embed>;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;align-right&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:align-right&quot;>;&lt;p >;Me, grandchild&lt;br/>;of colonization&lt;br/>;and war.&lt;/p>;&lt;/inline-embed>;&lt;p >;Also the child of Ba Má, who chose each other. For all that Má was lost to us for so many years, my father&#39;s love was not lost to her. She saw this reality from the orbit of her surreality. I know because the last words Má says on her hospital bed in the family room before she says the Lord&#39;s Prayer with my father are for my father, to my father:&lt;/p>;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;align-right&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:align-right&quot;>;&lt;p >;Em yêu anh.&lt;/p>;&lt;/inline-embed>;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;align-right&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:align-right&quot;>;&lt;p >;This I will translate, even if the&lt;br/>;translation is not enough:&lt;/p>;&lt;/inline-embed>;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;align-right&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:align-right&quot;>;&lt;p >;I love you.&lt;/p>;&lt;/inline-embed>;&lt;p >;After the Lord&#39;s Prayer, silence.&lt;br/>;My brother the doctor gives Má morphine&lt;br/>;while my sister-in-law the doctor watches.&lt;br/>;Má&#39;s eyes are long closed. Her breathing&lt;br/>;slows.&lt;/p>;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;align-right&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:align-right&quot;>;&lt;p >;I lean close to tell Má in Vietnamese that I love her.&lt;br/>;She lived a good life. A life of hard work and&lt;br/>;sacrifice. A heroic life. A life that&lt;br/>;demanded so much strength,&lt;br/>;devotion, and love.&lt;/p>;&lt;/inline-embed>;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;align-right&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:align-right&quot;>;&lt;p >;I don&#39;t know where Má&lt;br/>;found those qualities. But I am&lt;br/>;the beneficiary. These words, this faith&lt;br/>;in her, this betrayal of her, are the outcome.&lt;/p>;&lt;/inline-embed>;&lt;p >;Má&#39;s eyes do not open. She gives no sign of hearing.&lt;br/>;Her breathing finally stops. It is midnight.&lt;br/>;Her journey on this earth, complete.&lt;/p>;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;align-right&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:align-right&quot;>;&lt;p >;My mother is mine and my&lt;br/>;mother is also Other to me.&lt;/p>;&lt;/inline-embed>;&lt;p >;My brother makes a phone call. In an hour,&lt;br/>;a courteous stranger who might be Filipino arrives&lt;br/>;with a gurney, fills out a form, takes away my mother,&lt;br/>;leaves the empty hospital bed in the family room,&lt;br/>;and drives my mother into the night.&lt;/p>;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;align-right&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:align-right&quot;>;&lt;p >;I remember Má loved me.&lt;/p>;&lt;/inline-embed>;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;align-right&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:align-right&quot;>;&lt;p >;Everything else&lt;/p>;&lt;/inline-embed>;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;align-right&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:align-right&quot;>;&lt;p >;I can forget. ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/inline-embed>;&lt;p >;&lt;em>;This is drawn from “&lt;/em>;&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Man-Two-Faces-History-Memorial/dp/0802160506&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Man-Two-Faces-History-Memorial/dp/0802160506&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Man-Two-Faces-History-Memorial/dp/0802160506&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;&lt;em>;A Man of Two Faces: A Memoir, a History, a Memorial&lt;/em>;&lt;/a>;&lt;em>;.”&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 10 Sep 2023 00:06:01 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[A Departure from Reality]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-weekend-essay/a-departure-from-reality]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-09T10:00:00.000Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64fb8c9a284ea88dca166c92/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/vtn2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;article >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attribute-verso-pattern=&quot;article-body&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;ArticlePageChunks&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;In order to re member yourself and your mother, you examine the paper fragments of your past. Sometime before the fall of 1990, you visit your mother in what you remember as the Asian Pacific Psychiatric Ward. In a fitful, fragmentary journal you keep in college, you describe yourself as feeling&lt;/p>;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;align-right&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:align-right&quot;>;&lt;p >;numb.&lt;/p>;&lt;/inline-embed>;&lt;p >;Your older brother, the medical student, calls your mother&#39;s affliction a&lt;/p>;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;align-right&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:align-right&quot;>;&lt;p >;neurosis.&lt;/p>;&lt;/inline-embed>;&lt;p >;A dictionary calls a neurosis&lt;/p>;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;align-right&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:align-right&quot;>;&lt;p >;a relatively mild mental illness&lt;/p>;&lt;/inline-embed>;&lt;p >;but not&lt;/p>;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;align-right&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:align-right&quot;>;&lt;p >;a radical loss of touch with reality.&lt;/p>;&lt;/inline-embed>;&lt;p >;Really? You perceive this ward, its patients, and your mother as&lt;/p>;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;align-right&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:align-right&quot;>;&lt;p >;insane.&lt;/p>;&lt;/inline-embed>;&lt;p >;None of the patients, your mother included, appears to be a member of your reality. Seven or eight months later, while you are a sophomore at Berkeley, you try to write about the Asian Pacific Psychiatric Ward in a seminar led by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/06/08/maxine-hong-kingstons-genre-defying-life-and-work&quot;>;Maxine Hong Kingston&lt;/a>;. In your essay, you describe how a woman named Trinh rolls on the floor before a ward attendant, a Black woman, gently picks her up. Then&lt;/p>;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;align-right&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:align-right&quot;>;&lt;p >;Trinh stands in the middle of the floor before us. Her&lt;br/>;language is a mixture of Vietnamese and baby talk and&lt;br/>;maybe something of her own thrown in. She gapes out the&lt;br/>;window. She begins clapping her hands and singing in a&lt;br/>;disjointed, breathless way, like a child singing too eagerly.&lt;/p>;&lt;/inline-embed>;&lt;p >;You put away the essay and do not look at it again for thirty years. When you finally dare to read it again, it might as well be fiction. You have no memory now of this scene or the fact that most of the patients are Asian and Vietnamese. But you possess a vague image of the ward, because Má returns in 2005 when she embarks on her final departure from your reality. What you mostly recall from 1990 is your discomfort among these patients, your shock and terror that your mother is here. She is not herself. Or perhaps she is herself. Herself as another. As your Other.&lt;/p>;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;align-right&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:align-right&quot;>;&lt;p >;A white patient walks by, one of the few&lt;br/>;white people in this ward. She says, “Tell your mother not to&lt;br/>;worry about dying. We all felt that way when we first&lt;br/>;got here. We all get over it.” I nod at her to&lt;br/>;recognize that she exists.&lt;/p>;&lt;/inline-embed>;&lt;p >;The patients do not exist for much of the world outside the ward. This is perhaps especially true for the Asian patients, coming from people, such as your own, who rarely, if ever, discuss mental illness. Embarrassing. Shameful. You do not feel this way, but you can write about Má&#39;s voyage into surreality only now that she has died.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;And what right have you to do even that?&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;But perhaps you tell this story so you&lt;br/>;can recognize that your mother&lt;br/>;existed, exists, in all her selves, and&lt;br/>;that she was not and is not alone.&lt;/p>;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;align-center&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:align-center&quot;>;&lt;p >;•&lt;/p>;&lt;/inline-embed>;&lt;p >;You do not recall what brought her to the Asian Pacific Psychiatric Ward until you read the words you wrote as a nineteen-year-old:&lt;/p>;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;align-right&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:align-right&quot;>;&lt;p >;Someone out there—if not everyone—is trying to kill her.&lt;br/>;They crawl through the sewer and emerge through the&lt;br/>;toilet. She was waiting for them, locked in the bathroom,&lt;br/>;when my father decided enough was enough and&lt;br/>;knocked a hole in the door to reach her.&lt;br/>;It was my bathroom.&lt;/p>;&lt;/inline-embed>;&lt;p >;If you cannot remember this, why do you remember the reverse, the night Má chases Ba into the other bathroom in the hallway? When Ba locks himself inside, Má smashes holes into the door with a chair, all the shouting in Vietnamese you don&#39;t understand.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Ba, so fastidious about everything, so protective of you, never letting you hang your arm through the open car window because, he says, you will lose it in a car accident—this Ba never bothers to fix or replace the door Má has smashed. Although you remember how the gaping holes in the bathroom door reveal its hollowness for the rest of your years in that brown house, you possess no image of sitting with your mother in the ward.&lt;/p>;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;align-right&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:align-right&quot;>;&lt;p >;She recognized me, but I was no more important in&lt;br/>;her world than the rest of the ugly furniture. She looked&lt;br/>;ahead at the opposite wall. Her mouth remained slightly&lt;br/>;open, her eyes slightly glazed, but she didn&#39;t move.&lt;/p>;&lt;/inline-embed>;&lt;p >;Is this the same gaze you will see years later in the memory-care unit?&lt;/p>;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;align-right&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:align-right&quot;>;&lt;p >;She wouldn&#39;t hug us or touch us, but instead shied away&lt;br/>;like a timid child. She stood on the middle of the floor&lt;br/>;and smiled vacantly as we said goodbye.&lt;/p>;&lt;/inline-embed>;&lt;p >;You believe that these things happened, even if you cannot re member them, including how Má ignores the grapes and orange juice Ba has brought, and, while Ba talks to a social worker,&lt;/p>;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;align-right&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:align-right&quot;>;&lt;p >;the tears started to come from me and I got up before anybody&lt;br/>;saw me crying, because nobody had seen me cry since the&lt;br/>;sixth grade. I walked into the bathroom without saying&lt;br/>;anything to her, but I don&#39;t think she noticed anyway.&lt;br/>;I locked myself in the bathroom stall, and&lt;br/>;my first sob made me gasp.&lt;/p>;&lt;/inline-embed>;&lt;p >;You do not remember fleeing from Ban Mê Thuột and Sài Gòn because you were only four, but why can you not re member these things from your late teen years? You do not remember your (adopted) sister, twelve years your senior, who stayed to look after the house when the rest of you fled, but why can you not re member yourself? You have been dis membered and disremembered, by Hollywood and colonialism and racism, yes, but also by no one other than you.&lt;/p>;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;align-center&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:align-center&quot;>;&lt;p >;•&lt;/p>;&lt;/inline-embed>;&lt;p >;What you finally re member, provoked by these paper fragments, is this:&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Throughout your childhood and adolescence, Ba Má want to shape you into a moral, hardworking, upstanding, one-hundred-per-cent Vietnamese Catholic. You disagree with their intention, but you respect them. They are not hypocrites. They never deviate from their moral beliefs, their grinding work schedules at their grocery store, the SàiGòn Mới of San Jose, California, their nightly ritual of the Rosary, their weekly attendance at Mass, which, on retirement, becomes daily.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;But they verge on fanaticism. During your summer working in Santa Clara on the rides at Great America, when you are sixteen, you buy a pair of gray checkered pants with your own money from the teen fashion department at Macy&#39;s in Eastridge Mall. You roll up the hems and twist them tight around the ankle. You can never imagine wearing pants any other way, especially like those poor adults—your teachers—in their baggy chinos.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Má sees these checkered pants as the sort that delinquent Vietnamese refugee youth wear as they smoke, hang out with the opposite sex, do poorly in school, style their hair into outrageous heights, and go to night clubs and garage parties, all that is good and fun in your mind and wild and destructive in Má&#39;s imagination. She berates you, says you are not respectable and proper, that you are dooming your future. She orders you to return the pants. You do.&lt;/p>;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;align-right&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:align-right&quot;>;&lt;p >;And seethe.&lt;/p>;&lt;/inline-embed>;&lt;p >;The lesson you learn is the need to keep a secret life. You are already adept at secrecy and silence. In Ba Má&#39;s house in San Jose, you are an American spying on them. Outside their house, you are a Vietnamese spying on Americans and their strange ways and customs, including the forbidden, fantastic world of dating, seen in John Hughes movies like “Pretty in Pink” and “Weird Science” and “Some Kind of Wonderful.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Then you meet J at Great America. She lives fifty-six miles away from San Jose. To see her, you take a bus and then &lt;em >;BART&lt;/em>;, a trip of three hours each way. You sell your beloved comic-book collection to pay your long-distance phone bill. You maintain the secrecy for three years, until you run out of money and start calling J on Ba Má&#39;s phone bill. On January 4, 1990, Má says:&lt;/p>;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;align-right&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:align-right&quot;>;&lt;p >;“Your father doesn&#39;t even buy himself&lt;br/>;ten-dollar shirts. He wears your and your brother&#39;s&lt;br/>;hand-me-downs. Now, every time you call, he has to&lt;br/>;pay ten or twenty or thirty dollars.”&lt;br/>;And she cries.&lt;/p>;&lt;/inline-embed>;&lt;p >;By January 9th, your parents find your letters from J and your photos with her under your bed. You never see them again. You are outraged at this violation of your possessions, your memories, your affection for J, your chance to live your life like the white teen-agers in the movies. Ba Má are incensed because, all of a sudden, they discover that their quiet, sullen, usually obedient, vulnerable boy, not yet a man in their eyes, has been lying to them. And worse—is becoming someone they don&#39;t even know. You write:&lt;/p>;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;align-right&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:align-right&quot;>;&lt;p >;Mom threatened to have a heart attack.&lt;/p>;&lt;/inline-embed>;&lt;p >;Ba Má demand that you end the relationship. You have no car, no money, no guts, and you owe your parents loyalty and love. So you tell Ba Má you will not see J again, although you keep seeing J. You have become used to living a secret life, with two faces and two selves, only one of which you reveal to Ba Má. What harm does it do them if they don&#39;t know of your other life? You avoid thinking about what harm it does to J, who tolerates the situation. Your mother and father compromise in their own way. They offer to set you up with nice Vietnamese Catholic girls. The last thing you want is a nice Vietnamese Catholic girl.&lt;/p>;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;align-right&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:align-right&quot;>;&lt;p >;Eventually, though, you marry a nice Vietnamese Catholic girl—Lan,&lt;br/>;who is also so much more. But, like you, she knows how&lt;br/>;to wear the appropriate face for certain occasions.&lt;br/>;Not a false face. Just the right face.&lt;/p>;&lt;/inline-embed>;&lt;p >;Then, even though you will forget it, even though you have forgotten about it, on February 18, 1990, five weeks after learning about your secret romance with J, Má departs from reality and enters the Asian Pacific Psychiatric Ward, a fate arguably worse than a heart attack.&lt;/p>;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;align-right&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:align-right&quot;>;&lt;p >;Correlation? Or&lt;br/>;cause and effect?&lt;/p>;&lt;/inline-embed>;&lt;p >;You don&#39;t know, but, in Kingston&#39;s seminar in the fall of 1990, you try to get to the center between your two selves, try to get to the crossing between reality and surreality, try to re member what you have already begun to disremember.

Comes home. Returns to work at the SàiGòn Mới, open every day of the week, nearly every day of the year. Does not return to the Asian Pacific Psychiatric Ward for another fifteen years. You continue keeping secrets from her and Ba, a double life not atypical of immigrant and refugee children, or so you tell yourself.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Ba Má want to protect you from dangers you do not see; you want to protect them from knowledge they do not need. And they must own secrets you do not even know about. Isn&#39;t a true secret, by definition, something whose existence is not known? As for you, which secrets are worst? Being an atheist? Reading Marxist theory? Getting arrested? Seeing J for ten more years until the relationship ends?&lt;/p>;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;align-right&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:align-right&quot;>;&lt;p >;ie,&lt;br/>;that is,&lt;br/>;in other words,&lt;br/>;she dumps your sorry ass.&lt;/p>;&lt;/inline-embed>;&lt;p >;J refuses to be your secret any longer. She doesn&#39;t need to be with a person too weak to stand up on her behalf, content to live a double life that she did not ask for. When does duality become duplicitousness? When does having two selves lead not to double vision but to self-deception? The last time you see her is at her wedding to a Vietnamese groom. At least you did not ruin all Vietnamese people for her.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;You marry Lan. Although the most important thing about her to Ba Má is that she is a Vietnamese Catholic from a good family, the most important thing about Lan is that she is a poet, as well as beautiful. Your delighted parents pay for the very loud wedding, held in a Chinese banquet hall with the same elaborate ten-course Chinese meal served at every Vietnamese wedding, a bottle of Hennessy cognac on every table for the four hundred guests, most of whom you do not know. No one expects you to enjoy your own wedding. What a Western idea!&lt;/p>;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;align-center&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:align-center&quot;>;&lt;p >;•&lt;/p>;&lt;/inline-embed>;&lt;p >;For seven months in 2003, from summer to winter, you and Lan stay in the Eleventh Arrondissement of Paris, where English is rarely heard and Americans are rarely seen, a few steps from Métro Voltaire. You are newly married, and you have just been tenured. You cannot be fired, short of committing a crime, and so you are here not to write another scholarly book—&lt;/p>;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;align-right&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:align-right&quot;>;&lt;p >;your best friend from high school tells&lt;br/>;you he keeps your academic book&lt;br/>;by his bedside to help him&lt;br/>;fall asleep&lt;/p>;&lt;/inline-embed>;&lt;p >;—but to write your book of short stories while living in a one-bedroom apartment on the third floor of an unadorned building on the unfashionable Rue Richard Lenoir. No Haussmannian splendor and no elevator, but you and Lan are young and in love, with only one suitcase each.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;If going to Paris, a city famous for its writers, is a literary pilgrimage for you, Ba Má visit you in Paris that fall intent on a religious pilgrimage. They have retired from the brutal schedule of the SàiGòn Mới, and this is their idea of a good time: visiting the major Catholic shrines of Western Europe. Over five days, you escort them to Lourdes in southwestern France and Fátima in Portugal, with a stop in London. You pack a bottle of whiskey to relieve the stress, but are proud of yourself for orchestrating this vacation of a lifetime for Ba Má.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;i4cx2&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;This is their fourth international voyage. Their first was fleeing their homeland. If forced migrations make a person cosmopolitan, then refugees and migrants would be considered some of the world&#39;s best-travelled people. They are far worldlier than those who never leave their country of birth and yet look down on these voyagers whose odds of surviving their journey are as bad as or worse than those of astronauts.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Astronauts eventually return to Earth. But cosmonauts like Ba Má permanently escape the gravity of home.&lt;/p>;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;align-right&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:align-right&quot;>;&lt;p >;Is this the root of your own willingness to leave home?&lt;br/>;San Jose too small for you?&lt;/p>;&lt;/inline-embed>;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;align-right&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:align-right&quot;>;&lt;p >;Nostalgia is, literally, homesickness,&lt;br/>;with those afflicted yearning for&lt;br/>;their home. But what to call&lt;br/>;being sick of home?&lt;/p>;&lt;/inline-embed>;&lt;p >;For devout Catholics, the real home is not Earth but Heaven, their longing for it perpetual. How else to ascend and fulfill that desire but by becoming a one-way cosmonaut, voyager, risktaker? Nothing riskier than faith in what cannot be seen, heard, touched.&lt;/p>;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;align-right&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:align-right&quot;>;&lt;p >;Your parents call their object of faith God.&lt;br/>;You call yours justice.

Tourist shops sell crucifixes of every size, plates adorned with the Pope, Virgin Mary statues, snow globes, and lockets. You buy a cologne-size bottle of holy water for your father-in-law. Your parents bathe in this holy water while you wait outside the baths.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Fátima impresses you with its severity. Nestled in green mountains and supposedly named after a Moorish princess kidnapped by a Christian knight, Fátima commemorates other Virgin Mary sightings. Visitors approach a grand basilica with a towering spire by crossing an expansive square. Those desperate for the Virgin Mary&#39;s help shuffle across the square on their knees. In grimmer days, the knees of the faithful would be bloody and bruised. Now the pilgrims can wear kneepads. Ba Má pray at Fátima but do not crawl. They do not need a miracle. They have already saved themselves, with the aid of the US government and God.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;You never tell Ba Má you are an atheist because you do not want to upset them. Protecting Ba Má is how you show you love them, even if they do not know it, even as you do not remember all the unspoken ways they love you. Being their tour guide is another way of showing love. Ba Má put themselves in your care as someone finally an adult. Getting married is the first real sign of your adulthood. Grandchildren are what they want next, but fatherhood terrifies you.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;You buy yourself time with this pilgrimage. Surprisingly, you enjoy yourself, happy to see Ba Má delighted as you escort them to the Eiffel Tower and Versailles, Buckingham Palace and the Tower of London. Ba Má prefer the cleanliness of London over the dirtiness of Paris. In the Paris Métro, Má laughs recalling how, as a girl, she rode the bus without a fare, hiding underneath a seat.&lt;/p>;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;align-right&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:align-right&quot;>;&lt;p >;Years later, you will understand this memory when&lt;br/>;you take an oversold night train through central&lt;br/>;Việt Nam, third class, kids sleeping under your wooden&lt;br/>;bench, a stranger dozing on a stool in the aisle,&lt;br/>;forehead against your chest.&lt;/p>;&lt;/inline-embed>;&lt;p >;Your terror of fatherhood comes partly from seeing what motherhood inflicts on Má. The mother of your childhood wields a beautiful smile. She loves to adorn herself. She is statuesque and elegant, authoritative and powerful. The SàiGòn Mới exhausts her, ages her, diminishes her.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;But this pilgrimage signals the end of&lt;br/>;sacrifice. The war years, long past.&lt;br/>;SàiGòn Mới, no more.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;You will take them to all the Catholic shrines in the world. You might even go back with them to Việt Nam, to re member.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;It is the fall of 2003. Má is healthy.&lt;br/>;Neither of you know that in two years&lt;br/>;nothing will be the same, ever again,&lt;br/>;for her. Or you. Or me.&lt;/p>;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;align-center&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:align-center&quot;>;&lt;p >;•&lt;/p>;&lt;/inline-embed>;&lt;p >;You.

You are me, but seen from a slight distance, or the greatest distance, which is the space between one and one&#39;s self.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;You are my excuse to write about me, because I find myself too boring to go on about and also too frightening to think about.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Only through writing about you can I attempt to re member not only you but also myself. And, perhaps, in writing and re membering, you and me, engaged in this delicate dialectic, can become something greater than the sum of our disjointed parts.&lt;/p>;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;align-center&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:align-center&quot;>;&lt;p >;•&lt;/p>;&lt;/inline-embed>;&lt;p >;Ba no longer remembers Fátima and Lourdes, visits I now seize on as cherished memories of a time when Má inhabited this reality and I was a good son.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;What he does remember: Paris and London. And what he remembers most:&lt;/p>;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;align-right&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:align-right&quot;>;&lt;p >;Those curtains in that hotel room, he says wistfully.&lt;/p>;&lt;/inline-embed>;&lt;p >;The Marriott hotel where we stayed, near Big Ben, with its conjoining suites for Ba Má and for me, had floor-to-ceiling gold curtains.&lt;/p>;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;align-right&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:align-right&quot;>;&lt;p >;I modelled the curtains in the living room on them.&lt;/p>;&lt;/inline-embed>;&lt;p >;A tailor in his youth, Ba cut and sewed the curtains himself upon his return from London. Now, every morning and afternoon, he sits and naps on the plush brown leather sofa, hands clasped on his chest, illuminated by the soft golden light filtering through the closed curtains.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Sitting on that sofa, one sees on the opposite white wall the photos of Ba Má&#39;s fiftieth wedding anniversary, in 2004, coinciding with the fiftieth anniversary of the partition of Việt Nam, of the beginning of their refugee life together.&lt;/p>;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;align-right&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:align-right&quot;>;&lt;p >;Even as a country is divided, a future of blood&lt;br/>;foretold, marriage brings together two families&lt;br/>;and two lovers—a great detail for a novel!&lt;/p>;&lt;/inline-embed>;&lt;p >;During this anniversary, Ba wears a tan suit; Má, a golden áo dài. The presiding plump, pink-cheeked bishop of San Jose is ornately robed in his chasuble, bedecked with a mitre, and wielding a tall staff over his Vietnamese sheep.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;A year later, in December, 2005, during the Christmas holiday, I sit on this sofa, stunned. Something in Má has suddenly broken.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;There is no visible cause for this crack between our reality and her surreality. She was retired, enjoying her life: perfecting a handful of recipes, picking something different each day from her extensive wardrobe for the daily Mass she attended with Ba, taking pictures with her grandchildren. Now she is in a hospital, detained against her will and ours. I learn that doctors can put patients in a seventy-two-hour hold from which their loved ones cannot rescue them. This is one of the few facts I remember.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I do not keep a journal of this time.&lt;/p>;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;align-right&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:align-right&quot;>;&lt;p >;And I call myself a writer?&lt;/p>;&lt;/inline-embed>;&lt;p >;In the absence of words, my memory is blank.

Partly to protect you and me. Partly because remembering what I cannot remember would be an act of fiction rather than fact.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Fact: I am unable to recall what happened to Má, whether I was even there for her breakdown, what she looked like, how long she was in the hospital, or its name, or how she eventually returned to the same Asian Pacific Psychiatric Ward from so long ago.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The fact is that I also refuse to re member. I do not call my brother to ask for his help in sharpening my memory and my prose, the better to saw against&lt;/p>;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;align-right&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:align-right&quot;>;&lt;p >;bone.&lt;/p>;&lt;/inline-embed>;&lt;p >;I reject memory. I accept my amnesia. Because—fact—the Asian Pacific Psychiatric Ward is the most terrifying place I have ever been, and my mother&#39;s seventy-two-hour detention in that hospital is the most unsettling time of my life. I would trade parts of my body, even shorten my life, rather than be afflicted like the patients of that ward, like the people undergoing that detention.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Like Má.&lt;/p>;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;align-right&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:align-right&quot;>;&lt;p >;Forgetting the painful things is necessary for some&lt;br/>;of us. As long as we eventually simmer that&lt;br/>;bone that we cannot cut through. Have I&lt;br/>;simmered that bone enough? Can&lt;br/>;I taste that marrow of&lt;br/>;memory?&lt;/p>;&lt;/inline-embed>;&lt;p >;After the doctors release my mother from detention, after she leaves the Asian Pacific Psychiatric Ward, after we gather the legal documents Ba needs to control Má&#39;s fate, we deliver my mother to a nursing facility.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;My memory resumes at this halfway house between the surrealism of the Asian Pacific Psychiatric Ward and the realism of life with Má at home where she belongs. The nursing facility, neither luxurious nor cheap, resembles a hospital but is mostly a refrigerator to keep human beings alive until they are ready to die.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;6zczbl&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;If a quiet library with towering walls of books and hushed patrons and my own leather armchair is my vision of eternal bliss, this refrigerator is, if not Hell, then a purgatory with tiled floors, brightly lit hallways, bland meals under plastic covers, incapacitated patients, the constant bustle of nurses, therapists, visitors, the buzz of televisions.&lt;/p>;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;align-right&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:align-right&quot;>;&lt;p >;I have never seen anyone&lt;br/>;reading a book in&lt;br/>;this purgatory.&lt;/p>;&lt;/inline-embed>;&lt;p >;Most of the staff, clad in nursing scrubs or polo shirts and chinos, are Filipinas. American colonization in the Philippines created this route for nurses to come to the United States, while draining the Philippines of its own medical professionals and depriving the children left behind of their mothers, exported to take care of others around the world.&lt;/p>;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;align-right&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:align-right&quot;>;&lt;p >;Where is the televised dramatic comedy about these&lt;br/>;women?

Old and ill, or old and dying. Occasionally, someone screams. I do not want to end up here.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;My mother stays for days, or weeks, or months. I can&#39;t remember.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;What I do re member is that this time is different from the other times.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;While driving my brother and father away from one visit with Má, I realize that Má will not get better. As they discuss Má&#39;s condition, I understand that Má will never descend from her surreality to our reality, except for occasional, brief visits. I am ambushed by myself, sobs and tears rupturing the wall that separates you and me, me and myself. It has been fourteen years since I was so waylaid by myself, when Má was in the Asian Pacific Psychiatric Ward the first time.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Neither my father nor brother says a word as I grip the wheel and struggle to see through tears.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I recover. I get hold of myself. I put you back where you belong.&lt;br/>;My father and brother resume their conversation. I&lt;br/>;resume driving.&lt;/p>;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;align-right&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:align-right&quot;>;&lt;p >;We never speak of this moment.&lt;/p>;&lt;/inline-embed>;&lt;p >;After the nursing facility releases Má, Ba brings her body home. But not her mind. Not fully. Her thoughts travel most of the time through a different, parallel universe. Still, she sometimes returns to our reality, enough to notice how Ba, beginning at age seventy-two, when he should be circumnavigating the world via Boeing, remains earthbound. Homebound. He cares for Má without complaint for the next ten years, ignoring entreaties from my brother and me to hire the help that he can easily afford.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;As a child, I watched Ba cook dinner, shop for groceries, vacuum the house. The typical Vietnamese man is allergic to these chores. This routine of mundane deeds, I understand later, is love.&lt;/p>;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;align-right&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:align-right&quot;>;&lt;p >;In 2012, the Austrian filmmaker Michael Haneke,&lt;br/>;whose work I admire, makes “Amour,” about a&lt;br/>;loving husband and wife in their eighties.&lt;br/>;A stroke disables the wife, leaving her&lt;br/>;helpless and in her husband&#39;s care. Out of&lt;br/>;deep love, he suffocates her, and he is&lt;br/>;then alone, perhaps even dead, &lt;br/>;in their Parisian apartment.&lt;/p>;&lt;/inline-embed>;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;align-right&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:align-right&quot;>;&lt;p >;Haneke.

Both know how to suffer and sacrifice, without the reward of recognition from anyone but their sons, without the drama of a murder-suicide or a crucifixion.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Má&#39;s many medications, arrayed in a repurposed cookie tin, prevent such theatrics. The meds calm her. Reduce the chance of self-harm. Keep her from breaking fully free from our reality. So tightly is she leashed in orbit that Má is very quiet, moves slowly, does little. But she recognizes me and Ellison, my son, and her other grandchildren, even if the glow of recognition quickly fades.&lt;/p>;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;align-right&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:align-right&quot;>;&lt;p >;Unlike Haneke&#39;s two-hour, seven-minute movie,&lt;br/>;this quiet play, as slow and puzzling as&lt;br/>;“Happy Days” by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tag/samuel-beckett&quot;>;Samuel Beckett&lt;/a>;,&lt;br/>;goes on for a decade.&lt;/p>;&lt;/inline-embed>;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;align-right&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:align-right&quot;>;&lt;p >;Beckett also wrote, in “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Unnamable-Howard-Hughes/dp/0571244645&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Unnamable-Howard-Hughes/dp/0571244645&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Unnamable-Howard-Hughes/dp/0571244645&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;The Unnamable&lt;/a>;,”&lt;br/>;You must go on, I can&#39;t go on, I&#39;ll go on.&lt;/p>;&lt;/inline-embed>;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;align-right&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:align-right&quot;>;&lt;p >;How appropriate for refugees, of whom&lt;br/>;Beckett was one.

I don&#39;t understand the words. Má doesn&#39;t open her eyes.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The rites are done in a few seconds, the priest present for a few minutes. I expect solemnity from the Vietnamese holy man, a pat on the shoulder for Ba, but the man offers no words of care, not even pretending to share in the sorrow of my father. The priest could have been washing dishes for all the feeling he exhibits as he makes the sign of the cross.&lt;/p>;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;align-right&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:align-right&quot;>;&lt;p >;Father.

Or the ghoulish. I looked at Má then,&lt;br/>;as I had many times earlier, and thought:&lt;br/>;How will I write about this?&lt;br/>;About her? And&lt;br/>;her ghost?&lt;/p>;&lt;/inline-embed>;&lt;p >;I expect more from this Vietnamese priest. But I say nothing. Ba is thankful, shakes the priest&#39;s hand, bows a little. If my father is grateful, who am I, the ingrate, to say anything. Perhaps when I am aged and shaky and vulnerable like Ba, I, too, will be grateful.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;We bring Má back to her suburban house. The vast, verdant lawn is now an expanse of dirt, Ba too tired and distracted to maintain it. I sleep in an upstairs bedroom, the same one I slept in the last two years of high school. It&#39;s December. The house is cool, especially the downstairs bedroom where Má sleeps. We wheel her rented hospital bed into the family room, with its television that has barely been watched since Má fell ill and the stereo system no one listened to even when Má was well. Background music is not a part of family life. The house is usually as silent as an empty church. There is no soundtrack as I watch December 22nd turn to December 23rd while Má takes her last breaths, thirteen years almost to the day from her final breakdown. Ba, my brother, my sister-in-law, and I are the only witnesses.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Má was born in 1937 as Nguyễn Thị Bãy, a poor girl in a poor northern Vietnamese village. She dies in 2018 as Linda Kim Nguyen, American citizen, traveller of a life both ordinary and epic.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;At seventeen, she married and became a refugee for the first time.&lt;/p>;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;align-right&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:align-right&quot;>;&lt;p >;At seventeen, I almost did not&lt;br/>;graduate from high school&lt;br/>;because I nearly failed&lt;br/>;precalculus.&lt;/p>;&lt;/inline-embed>;&lt;p >;At thirty-eight, a mother of two biological sons and one adopted daughter, Má became a refugee for the second time, her sequel starting in an alien country.&lt;/p>;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;align-right&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:align-right&quot;>;&lt;p >;At thirty-eight, I, with&lt;br/>;no children, struggled&lt;br/>;with writing a short&lt;br/>;story about Má.&lt;/p>;&lt;/inline-embed>;&lt;p >;Má&#39;s first name is Bãy. Giving children numbers as names was common in rural Việt Nam. Families often had so many children. Some would not survive. Why give a girl a real name?&lt;/p>;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;align-right&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:align-right&quot;>;&lt;p >;As a girl, the seventh child, she deserved no more.&lt;/p>;&lt;/inline-embed>;&lt;p >;Má hated this birth name. In her last decades, she wanted to be called by her American name, Linda. But both her names feel alien on my tongue. I never called her by her name, only Mẹ as a child, Má as an adult. Her refugee path shaped even what I called her. Northerners say Mẹ, southerners say Má, and I, as always, am somewhere in between.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Most Americans who met Má probably saw only her mortal, unextraordinary coil. If they knew anything about her, they might know she had been a shopkeeper, businesswoman, refugee. If they knew nothing about her, she was another Asian woman who did not speak good English. Mẹ, or Má, never wanted to mention that she had received only a grade-school education. I am telling on her, and yet she should be told on, even if it is not my secret to tell. Look at what Má accomplished with just a grade-school education, overcoming everything—almost everything—except her mind.&lt;/p>;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;align-right&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:align-right&quot;>;&lt;p >;Defeated, like so many&lt;br/>;heroes, not by others&lt;br/>;but by herself.&lt;/p>;&lt;/inline-embed>;&lt;p >;A hero but not a soldier. People like Má who will not be remembered by History are also a part of History, drafted as reluctant players in horrific wars. And the wars of the twentieth century—including the ones in Việt Nam—killed at least as many civilians as soldiers.&lt;/p>;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;align-right&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:align-right&quot;>;&lt;p >;Civilian stories can be war stories, too.&lt;/p>;&lt;/inline-embed>;&lt;p >;Perhaps what happened to my mother was simply her body and mind&#39;s fate. But History and war took their turns hammering Má. Unnerving her. Breaking her.&lt;/p>;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;align-right&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:align-right&quot;>;&lt;p >;My mother, child&lt;br/>;of colonization&lt;br/>;and war.&lt;/p>;&lt;/inline-embed>;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;align-right&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:align-right&quot;>;&lt;p >;Me, grandchild&lt;br/>;of colonization&lt;br/>;and war.&lt;/p>;&lt;/inline-embed>;&lt;p >;Also the child of Ba Má, who chose each other. For all that Má was lost to us for so many years, my father&#39;s love was not lost to her. She saw this reality from the orbit of her surreality. I know because the last words Má says on her hospital bed in the family room before she says the Lord&#39;s Prayer with my father are for my father, to my father:&lt;/p>;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;align-right&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:align-right&quot;>;&lt;p >;Em yêu anh.&lt;/p>;&lt;/inline-embed>;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;align-right&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:align-right&quot;>;&lt;p >;This I will translate, even if the&lt;br/>;translation is not enough:&lt;/p>;&lt;/inline-embed>;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;align-right&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:align-right&quot;>;&lt;p >;I love you.&lt;/p>;&lt;/inline-embed>;&lt;p >;After the Lord&#39;s Prayer, silence.&lt;br/>;My brother the doctor gives Má morphine&lt;br/>;while my sister-in-law the doctor watches.&lt;br/>;Má&#39;s eyes are long closed. Her breathing&lt;br/>;slows.&lt;/p>;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;align-right&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:align-right&quot;>;&lt;p >;I lean close to tell Má in Vietnamese that I love her.&lt;br/>;She lived a good life. A life of hard work and&lt;br/>;sacrifice. A heroic life. A life that&lt;br/>;demanded so much strength,&lt;br/>;devotion, and love.&lt;/p>;&lt;/inline-embed>;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;align-right&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:align-right&quot;>;&lt;p >;I don&#39;t know where Má&lt;br/>;found those qualities. But I am&lt;br/>;the beneficiary. These words, this faith&lt;br/>;in her, this betrayal of her, are the outcome.&lt;/p>;&lt;/inline-embed>;&lt;p >;Má&#39;s eyes do not open. She gives no sign of hearing.&lt;br/>;Her breathing finally stops. It is midnight.&lt;br/>;Her journey on this earth, complete.&lt;/p>;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;align-right&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:align-right&quot;>;&lt;p >;My mother is mine and my&lt;br/>;mother is also Other to me.&lt;/p>;&lt;/inline-embed>;&lt;p >;My brother makes a phone call.

I was well prepared for this outcome, as I&#39;ve been watching the promotional videos of Sanders that have been filmed and uploaded to YouTube during the last nine months. They are each about fifteen minutes or so in length, and show Sanders preparing for the upcoming season. I&#39;m using the term “filmed” generously here—these are low-rent, anti-glitz videos that seem to purposely eschew the easy wonder of the iPhone 14 for something that more closely resembles, in spirit and technical proficiency, the home videos shot by your uncle on his camcorder in the nineteen-nineties. There&#39;s no narration, no talking heads, and no obvious through line other than that expectations are sky-high for Sanders, who signed a five-year, nearly thirty-million-dollar contract last year.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Instead, there&#39;s plenty of handheld shakiness with hard cuts and missing segues. We&#39;re occasionally afforded the courtesy of a quick and mumbled introduction of a coach or player—if you catch it in time—but the rule of thumb seems to be that either you understand what&#39;s going on or you don&#39;t. Often the camera is out of focus. Other times the audio is poor. Sometimes the sound drops out completely and a caption on the screen might explain that the video had to be muted because something “wild” was said. It&#39;s worth noting that Sanders says he hasn&#39;t cursed since he was a college student at Florida State University, where he weaned himself off profanity by paying a fine of five dollars to whoever happened to be with him at the time. The closest he comes now to using a swear word is “dang” and “darn,” which, coming from Sanders, is strangely alluring (as opposed to cloying), and is just one example of how the banal manages to upstage the grandiose in these videos.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The camera follows Sanders as he traverses the team facilities—equipment room, weight room, indoor practice field—sometimes riding through the hallways on a bicycle that&#39;s been provided for him. (Sanders has a bad foot, which was dislocated for nearly twenty years.) Watching Sanders waiting in line in the campus cafeteria, being served chicken, shrimp, rice, etc.—“That&#39;s a beautiful plate right there,” he tells the camera—is another example of where the activities of daily living can trump the actual fundamentals of putting together a football season with its ubiquitous team meetings and player workouts and cliché exhortations. There are times when the videos seem to consciously point directly at the power of the mundane, à la Frederick Wiseman, without the social commentary, as when we see Sanders vacuuming the white plush rug in his office, at 4:30 &lt;em >;AM&lt;/em>; no less, thirty seconds of ambient sound only, after which he extolls the virtuosity of the vacuum cleaner and declaims that he hopes to do business with the company. “Dyson,” he says, “please call me.” In the age of TikTok, this is what counts as an extended meditation on everyday life.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;That&#39;s not to say that there aren&#39;t plenty of the customary sports platitudes to go around: “This is the beginning,” Sanders tells his team at one point, early in the rebuilding process. “We are going to look back at this particular day and understand how prolific and how profound that this day is.” That might be true, but it&#39;s something we&#39;ve already seen many times before from coaches, players, fans, commentators, et al. What we &lt;em>;haven&#39;t&lt;/em>; seen before is what takes place between him and a campus cleaning woman he meets while waiting for the elevator one morning. He&#39;s in the middle of talking to one of his coaches when he pauses and turns to the woman who is standing next to a cart piled with bags of garbage.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“How you doing today?” he says to her.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“I&#39;m doing good, sir,” she says. “Thank you for asking.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;She speaks with an accent and she&#39;s diffident—who wouldn&#39;t be?—and then Sanders puts his arm around her shoulder. “You&#39;re doing a good job,” he says to her. He corrects himself: “A &lt;em>;great&lt;/em>; job.” He holds the elevator door as she wheels the cart of garbage in, and the last thing we hear her saying is, “I need to take my eight o&#39;clock breakfast break.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;If this is Sanders exhibiting his magnanimous personality for the benefit of the camera, consider me a sucker. That he had a difficult childhood growing up in Fort Myers, Florida, where his mother worked as a cleaner to support her children, adds a level of backstory to a life now spent completely amid the largesse of a Pac-12 football team.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;This is not the first so-called documentary about Sanders as a Division 1 head coach; on Barstool Sports and Amazon Prime, cameras followed his first college-coaching job, at Jackson State University, where he was hired after being an offensive coördinator at Trinity Christian High School, where two of his sons played. The first season of the Amazon Prime series ran for only four episodes, and concluded with an undefeated regular season &lt;em>;and&lt;/em>; Sanders being hired away by the University of Colorado, which is where these YouTube videos pick up, without any trace of the polished docuseries that we&#39;ve become accustomed to. (Amazon Prime is reportedly at work on a new season.)&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The irony of these underproduced videos is that Deion Sanders—aka Neon Deion, aka Prime Time, aka, most recently, Coach Prime—was one of the flashiest football players in the history of the NFL He was a cornerback, a punt returner, an occasional wide receiver—and, by the way, an outfielder for nine seasons in Major League Baseball. He&#39;s the only professional athlete to have played in both a Super Bowl and a World Series. Those glory days are long gone. He now walks with a pronounced limp because two years ago he nearly died as a result of blood clots in his leg and had to have two toes amputated. He&#39;s not shy about displaying his foot; he has it massaged twice a day in the team training room to keep the blood flowing. In a Boulder nail salon, he asks the technician, with his typical aplomb in the face of physical decline, “I got eight toes—do I get a discount?” The deterioration of his body—he estimates twenty-two surgeries, twelve on the foot alone—adds a certain amount of pathos to this story, and an unintentional meta-commentary: here is what awaits the young, seemingly indestructible bodies of the athletes he now coaches, almost none of whom will make it to the NFL or earn anywhere near the millions that Sanders made in the course of his career.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;The mastermind behind the videos is Sanders&#39;s son Deion, Jr., who is present nearly as much as his father, and who serves as social-media manager. The nepotism extends to Sanders&#39;s two other sons, Shedeur, who is Colorado&#39;s starting quarterback, and Shilo, a starting safety, both of whom he brought from Jackson State when he resigned. (Darius Sanders—no relation—helps out with filming the videos.) Deion, Jr.,&#39;s days are relatively uneventful, which makes them fascinating. He runs errands for his father, he unboxes products sent by companies in the hope of free advertising—sunglasses by Shady Side Up—he shoots the shit with the staff and players. There he is dropping in unannounced on the tech guy who fixes the team&#39;s computers. “How genius is that?” Deion, Jr., asks with genuine appreciation. There he is shopping at the craft store Michaels, understandably bewildered, as he tries to find a picture frame large enough for one of his father&#39;s football jerseys. In short, he&#39;s responsible for coming up with content, and the guiding principle seems to be that pretty much anything goes. In one video, titled “THE NEW Record for MOST SPENT at the School Book Store,” he buys a thousand dollars&#39; worth of University of Colorado sweatshirts and assorted merchandise. “Get your Colorado stuff,” he tells the camera. “If you really support, show me that you support.” This serves as a useful reminder that college football is a business.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;So it&#39;s not entirely accurate to say that there&#39;s no social commentary in these videos—in fact, it&#39;s implied in almost every frame. The execution might be bargain-basement, but everything else is penthouse, beginning with the senior Sanders&#39;s luxury office, designed just for him, with a chandelier and a view of the snowcapped Flatirons, and the equipment room that resembles a Nike factory outlet, and, of course, the thirty-million-dollar contract that Sanders has signed. “God is good,” is a phrase often repeated for rhetorical effect. As the title of the YouTube series, “Colorado Opulence,” makes clear, there will be no shame or embarrassment about the absolute monetary supremacy of Division 1 college football and the many directions in which the cash flows.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;af1pni&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;dja6si&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;And, lest anyone should forget, Sanders has been hired with the goal of turning around the university&#39;s underperforming asset, ie, making a winner out of a football team that finished last year in last place in the Pac-12 with a record of 1–11. If Sanders seems daunted by the prospect, he shows no sign of it. After all, he had already worked miracles when he was at Jackson State, transforming a mediocre team at an HBCU, with a fraction of the University of Colorado budget, into a powerhouse that won the Southwestern Athletic Conference in both of the seasons he coached there. This is the reputation that precedes Sanders when he meets his new players for the first time, way back in December, entering to enthusiastic applause, limping, as per usual, dressed in a three-piece suit and a black-and-yellow tie—the team colors—while “All Eyez on Me” plays over the speakers. “That&#39;s the way we walk in,” he says to laughter. But that&#39;s as funny as it&#39;s going to get for the players, who mostly stare at him in awe.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In a video that&#39;s been viewed almost four and a half million times—I account for six of those—Sanders talks matter-of-factly about what he interprets as a culture of complacency that has overtaken the team. “I&#39;m coming,” he says ominously—which is to become a refrain in his speech. “I&#39;m coming to work and not to play. I&#39;m coming to kill it and not to kick it.” A few weeks later, this will be turned into the collective—“We coming”—and used as the team motto, emblazoned on sweatshirts that can be purchased at the college bookstore for fifty-five dollars. Sanders is unsentimental and proscriptive in his speech. He informs the players that from now on there will be no hats, no hoodies, and no phones in his meetings. “I wish you &lt;em>;would&lt;/em>; bring a phone in my meeting,” he says, issuing a veiled threat, and speaking for every college professor who lacks his commanding presence and institutional support. He explains that he already has plans to replace many of them with better players—his sons Shilo and Shedeur happen to be two of those better players. “I&#39;m bringing my luggage with me,” he says, “and it&#39;s Louis.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Not long after that initial team meeting, Sanders puts his money where his mouth is, and brings with him more Louis Vuitton luggage, shocking the sports world by flipping the five-star cornerback Cormani McClain, who had already committed to the University of Miami; Sanders is a talent who attracts talent. (On the field last Saturday against TCU, only ten players remained from last year&#39;s team.) And when his friend Lil Wayne arrives with his entourage, circa midnight—rap-star time—Sanders, wearing overalls and red sandals, gives him a personal tour of the impeccable team facilities. We&#39;ve been here before, of course, but now we&#39;re experiencing it through Lil Wayne&#39;s eyes, and his disbelief is palpable in the presence of such outsized wealth, on a college campus no less.

>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Fast forward some seven months later to the TCU game, where Sanders can be seen giving an electrifying pre-game speech, showcasing the full power of his oratory skills, and transforming the team motto, as if he had planned this from the very beginning, from “We coming,” into “We here.” ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;dbq2fd&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot;

>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Last Thursday was a typically atypical day at Burning Man—the last before a series of atypically atypical days. It began, for me, with a bike ride with some friends to the Temple for an orchestral performance. Burning Man is named after a large effigy that burns in a raucous extravaganza on Saturday night; the next night, most of the same crowd sits in silence watching a wooden temple, of a different design each year, go up in flames. Beforehand, people fill the Temple with messages, writing on the walls and stapling photos and personal effects to the structure. I wandered inside and perused the community&#39;s contributions. Many of them memorialized lost loved ones, but the ones that hit me hardest addressed the search for self-love. “To my past self,” one message read. “You are more amazing than you realize. We&#39;ve made it.” The note ended with a hint at the future: “See you there. xoxo.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I was in a receptive mood, and tears streamed down my face. I spent an hour reading. Then I headed to Burning Man&#39;s makeshift airport, where I needed to reschedule a volunteer shift. The airport is a somewhat contentious spot: earlier in the week, climate protesters had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vox.com/technology/2023/8/30/23852215/burning-man-climate-protest-block-road&quot;>;blocked off&lt;/a>; the road leading to Burning Man to protest, among other things, the increasing number of private planes flying into the temporary metropolis that we call Black Rock City. For years, the community has struggled with how to deal with the influx of money. Wealthy individuals contribute to some stunning art, mutant vehicles, and theme camps on the playa, but the cash also allows people to insulate themselves in RVs set up by hired hands. In an official newsletter, the Burning Man Project reported that they “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://jackrabbit.burningman.org/t/ViewEmailArchive/t/88C55773A628E24B2540EF23F30FEDED/C67FD2F38AC4859C/&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://jackrabbit.burningman.org/t/ViewEmailArchive/t/88C55773A628E24B2540EF23F30FEDED/C67FD2F38AC4859C/&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://jackrabbit.burningman.org/t/ViewEmailArchive/t/88C55773A628E24B2540EF23F30FEDED/C67FD2F38AC4859C/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;took action&lt;/a>;” last year against seventy camps for selling accommodations, amenities, or services. “Convenience camping (formerly described as turnkey or plug-and-play camping) is not permitted in BRC, and runs totally counter to the values of our community,” its Web site &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://journal.burningman.org/2023/08/black-rock-city/participate-in-brc/preserving-burning-man-culture/&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://journal.burningman.org/2023/08/black-rock-city/participate-in-brc/preserving-burning-man-culture/&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://journal.burningman.org/2023/08/black-rock-city/participate-in-brc/preserving-burning-man-culture/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;reads&lt;/a>;. Burning Man is supposed to be hard.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;As I headed back to camp from the airport, I passed a photographer who&#39;d set up a white tent to take portraits of Burners. I stopped in for one. Then I ran into a friend from New York who helps run Kostume Kult, a theme camp that gives away flamboyant garb and hosts parties and runway shows for anyone who wants to strut. We played Jenga, accepted Capri Sun bags injected with alcohol, and filmed people for a sing-along video that he&#39;s making with his wife. Back at my own camp, Deep Playa Surprise, I was recruited for a bike ride back across the city to visit a foam body-wash party. We arrived too late and settled for shaved ice handed out by kids. Just as I started back, a dust storm rolled in. Blinded in the whiteout, I navigated by following the sound of a distant beat. It was the kind of extreme weather that&#39;s predictably unpredictable at Burning Man: you learn to not leave camp without goggles and a dust mask.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I made it back in time to see that the camp across the street from us, run by a bunch of Aussies, was about to begin its Dildo Olympics. I joined a team, and then our own event for that day followed. We served cocktails and hosted a discussion with NiNo Alicea, the first Puerto Rican artist to earn a grant from Burning Man; his work this year, “ATABEY&#39;s Treasure,” was a silver fish whose head and tail appeared to peek from below the desert ground to a height of about twenty feet. (Burning Man is glacially becoming more racially diverse, but it&#39;s still heavily populated by &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://blackrockcitycensus.org/sociodemo#demographics&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://blackrockcitycensus.org/sociodemo#demographics&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://blackrockcitycensus.org/sociodemo#demographics&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;wealthy, college-educated white people&lt;/a>;.) We rode out to the sculpture, where a couple who looked like Instagram influencers were photographing each other; an apparently professional ballet dancer soon arrived, and began posing and leaping around in a thong for another photographer. We returned to camp, where two friends on their way to No Holes Barred, a comedy club down the block, told us that they&#39;d &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://twitter.com/srsiskind/status/1699656561444954447&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://twitter.com/srsiskind/status/1699656561444954447&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/srsiskind/status/1699656561444954447&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;just got engaged&lt;/a>;. Earlier that week, one of them had run a desert ultramarathon on acid.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Black Rock City is shaped like a doughnut with a bite taken out of it: the Man is in the center of the hole, the Temple is in the bite mark, and art fills the hole, the bite, and the space beyond for about a mile. After dark, a group of us biked out to see the glowing art scattered around the playa. In a large piece made by my friend from Kostume Kult and his wife, four stacked rings, each about five feet high, rotated on an axis; by pulling on the rings with ropes, people could mix and match animal legs, bodies, heads, and ears. We watched a two-story heart-shaped chrysalis burn, revealing a steel butterfly inside. Farther out, we found a miniature airstrip with rocking chairs shaped like airplanes; we climbed up a tower—a plane pointed vertically with a lower level containing a lounge and open bar serving tea. (All bars at Burning Man are open bars.) I often think that Black Rock City has some of the best contemporary art in the world, from big installations like the temples to little pieces of mind-fuckery, like a lone mirror, set up on its own, that read, “Don&#39;t look high.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;After a few hours of touring art, we headed to a dance party at a camp called Ashram Galactica. I ran into a friend who was building a retreat in Costa Rica. Then we rode back to camp through a nighttime dust storm.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;GenericCallout&quot;>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;View of the muddy playa at Burning Man in 2023&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64fb892f829f3db5a96dc963/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Hutson-BM-2.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64fb892f829f3db5a96dc963/master/w_120,c_limit/Hutson-BM-2.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64fb892f829f3db5a96dc963/master/w_240,c_limit/Hutson-BM-2.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64fb892f829f3db5a96dc963/master/w_320,c_limit/Hutson-BM-2.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64fb892f829f3db5a96dc963/master/w_640,c_limit/Hutson-BM-2.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64fb892f829f3db5a96dc963/master/w_960,c_limit/Hutson-BM-2.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64fb892f829f3db5a96dc963/master/w_1280,c_limit/Hutson-BM-2.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64fb892f829f3db5a96dc963/master/w_1600,c_limit/Hutson-BM-2.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;The next day, Friday, was cold for Burning Man. In the late morning, a few of us went to a camp called Bubbles and Bass for champagne and house music. Then, in the early afternoon, it started raining. That would be the last of Burning Man as we knew it. The rain grew heavier, and our camp of about twenty hunkered down in our tents and RVs I didn&#39;t make it to my rescheduled airport shift—I saw someone try and fail to ride a bike in the mud, and figured that, even if I could make it to the airport on foot, nothing would be landing anyway. Eventually, most of us gathered in one large RV for the evening. Just walking the few dozen feet from my tent was treacherous. Water turns the playa dust into a clay-like mud; every step adds another layer of muck to your shoes, and after just a few steps your encased feet are pounds heavier. We drank, snacked, and laughed until bedtime. Then we used pull-string kitchen trash bags, one for each foot, to make it back to our tents, waddling along as we held them up by the strings. In my tent—which, after years of use, was no longer waterproof—pools of muddy water were collecting. I carpeted the floor with emergency rain ponchos, piled things on top, and tried to sleep in my half-soaked sleeping bag.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;On Saturday morning, we surveyed the situation. Mud and pools of water surrounded us. Some people had planned to leave that day, to avoid a lengthy exodus—it can take hours to channel tens of thousands of people out of the desert and onto the narrow two lanes of Highway 447—but now it would be impossible. We listened on the radio to predictions of further showers. There would be no sun until Monday, and it could take a day or more of sunlight for the ground to dry; we realized that we might not get out until Wednesday.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;We ate and drank, but not too much—we had plenty to go around, but wanted to avoid the porta-potties. Getting to them now involved navigating a slippery, stumbly, sticky obstacle course; the muck in the much-trod area in front of them was especially deep, and, inside, mud was building up on the floor, requiring a big, risky step up. (On the other hand, the extra height turned them into Squatty Potties—good for gut evacuation!) Because service trucks couldn&#39;t reach the porta-potties, they started to fill up. We peed in jugs in our tents and contemplated shitting in bags. This was the approach people had taken during Renegade Burn, in 2021, when there was no official Burn because of the pandemic but thousands came to the playa anyway.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;In late August, a week before the festival, an even heavier rain had hit, from Tropical Storm Hilary, flooding much of the desert for days. (A photo of someone in a kayak circulated online.) I&#39;d met a festival worker who told me that the best way to walk around then had been in socks—over either feet or shoes—and I shared this information with my campmates. We tried various combinations of socks, shoes, and trash bags. Meanwhile, some people got intermittent wireless or cellular signals. Texts arrived from friends asking if we were OK, and we began to see ourselves in the news. The view from the outside didn&#39;t align with the view from the inside. We were mostly just inconvenienced, enjoying one another&#39;s company and half joking about “trauma bonding,” but news reports described it as a “disaster,” perhaps putting some people in mind of Hurricane Katrina or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/living-through-mauis-unimaginable-wildfires&quot;>;the Maui fires&lt;/a>;. On one site, we found a &lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/article/fact-check-burning-man-festival-ebola-national-emergency-498334622942&quot;>;rumor&lt;/a>; about an Ebola outbreak, which we quickly dismissed; elsewhere we read that Chris Rock and Diplo had &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://twitter.com/diplo/status/1698095454544949421&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://twitter.com/diplo/status/1698095454544949421&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/diplo/status/1698095454544949421&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;hiked&lt;/a>; through miles of mud to the pavement and, alarmingly, that someone had been electrocuted while trying to start a generator in standing water. (He may have died of drug intoxication, a coroner later said.)&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In fact, everything did not go to hell. People supported one another, sharing resources within and between camps. We offered beer to our neighbors and received ice cream. One good Samaritan with a rainbow parasol hat carried a shovel to the porta-potties and started to clean out the mud. Later, I saw online that some people had made mud sculptures—a dragon, a phallus (naturally). The few bad vibes were cast at people who tried to drive out of Black Rock City even though we were being told to shelter in place. All the attempts I saw failed, as vehicles got stuck and spun their wheels, blocking and damaging the road. Maybe those people really needed to be somewhere else; maybe they just wanted to be somewhere else. I don&#39;t know, and can&#39;t judge them.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;feature-large-callout&quot; >;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;A row of porta potties with mud around them at Burning Man in 2023&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64fb8928673df1e00aeebb36/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Hutson-BM-4.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64fb8928673df1e00aeebb36/master/w_120,c_limit/Hutson-BM-4.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64fb8928673df1e00aeebb36/master/w_240,c_limit/Hutson-BM-4.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64fb8928673df1e00aeebb36/master/w_320,c_limit/Hutson-BM-4.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64fb8928673df1e00aeebb36/master/w_640,c_limit/Hutson-BM-4.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64fb8928673df1e00aeebb36/master/w_960,c_limit/Hutson-BM-4.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64fb8928673df1e00aeebb36/master/w_1280,c_limit/Hutson-BM-4.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64fb8928673df1e00aeebb36/master/w_1600,c_limit/Hutson-BM-4.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;This was my eighth time at Burning Man, but my first in seven years. I&#39;d stopped going because of the stress, the hassle, and the opportunity cost: at least a week offline, perhaps another week of travel and errands in Reno and elsewhere, and sometimes months of preparation. Once I get to the playa, I feel at home—more myself than anywhere else—but until that moment I&#39;m racked with anxiety, thinking about every little thing that can go wrong, from faux pas to equipment failure to grievous injury. (During my second year, a toppling speaker broke my friend Suzie&#39;s arm and she courageously stayed at the Burn in a sling all week before having surgery back in New York.) Going to Burning Man is a leap of faith—a bet that you can just deal.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In my early years, I did more psychedelics—LSD, psilocybin, MDMA, MDA, 2C-B, DOM—each trip also a leap of faith. My last few psychedelic trips at Burning Man, however, I felt overwhelmed and retreated to my tent to be with my own thoughts. I began sticking mostly to alcohol. This year, I decided to test myself again. Sitting around with my campmates in the muck on Saturday, I took half a tab of AL-LAD, a chemical analogue of LSD. The initial rush created a familiar anxiety—the kind that a high person feels when staring into a mirror that says, “Don&#39;t look high.” I questioned the appropriateness of everything I did, and of core parts of myself. Then I reflected on the messages in the Temple about seeking self-love. Everyone questions themselves. We are all flawed, and it eats at us, yet we find ways to deal, hopefully.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I assigned myself the task of accepting what I could not control—the weather, the porta-potties, parts of who I was. Through all this, I was actually having a pretty good time. One laughter attack with a campmate—the kind that feeds on itself—left us gasping and teary-eyed. Someone kept shouting “Best Burn ever!” at passersby. Maybe it was. In a way, the wetness had disrupted the festival, but it had also reified it as a time and place for disruption. I thought back to my first Burn, in 2007. When I arrived, after midnight on Tuesday morning, the Man was already on fire; an old-school Burner had ignited it in apparent protest of what he later said had become an RV-filled “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/2007/08/addis/&quot;>;Alterna-Disney&lt;/a>;,” hoping to bring the festival back to its countercultural roots. Maybe the rains would be another sort of jolt. Or maybe they would lead to more RVs&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Because of the rain, the Man would not burn on Saturday night. But the Aussies set up a small wooden man in the middle of the street, doused it in gasoline, and lit it up. Every year, there&#39;s a fire conclave—a collection of fire dancers invited to perform around the Man before it goes up in flames. During my last Burn, in 2016, I was part of the conclave, spinning poi. Seeing the mini-man, I grabbed my LED poi and jammed out, feeling sorry for everyone whose performances and events had been cancelled. The Aussies followed their burn with a dance party that went until eight in the morning. By then, it was still cool and cloudy, but the wind had dried the mud enough for us to start taking down our shade structure and kitchen and begin packing things up. Service trucks reached the porta-potties. People marched over carrying gallon-size water jugs filled with pee that was dark amber from tactical dehydration.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The weather was iffy, with sun and clouds here and there. Two people in our camp made it out in a truck; two others started driving, got caught in a shower, and trudged back to camp on foot. The new rain meant that no one else would be getting out that day. But Monday was sunny, and we all managed to pack up, scour the ground for &lt;em >;MOOP&lt;/em>; (matter out of place), and leave, along with much of the rest of Black Rock City. It took eight hours of stop-and-go traffic to drive the few miles to the pavement—not the shortest exodus, not the longest. I think they burned the Man as I was on the road to Reno.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;GenericCallout&quot;>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;GroupCalloutWrapper&quot;>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;A person crouched down by a car tire attempting to get it out of the mud at Burning Man in 2023&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64fb893831c4737131be2c7e/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Hutson-BM-5.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64fb893831c4737131be2c7e/master/w_120,c_limit/Hutson-BM-5.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64fb893831c4737131be2c7e/master/w_240,c_limit/Hutson-BM-5.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64fb893831c4737131be2c7e/master/w_320,c_limit/Hutson-BM-5.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64fb893831c4737131be2c7e/master/w_640,c_limit/Hutson-BM-5.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64fb893831c4737131be2c7e/master/w_960,c_limit/Hutson-BM-5.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64fb893831c4737131be2c7e/master/w_1280,c_limit/Hutson-BM-5.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64fb893831c4737131be2c7e/master/w_1600,c_limit/Hutson-BM-5.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;A alligator sculpture made of mud at Burning Man in 2023&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64fb89374984dce7e190c3a9/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Hutson-BM-6.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64fb89374984dce7e190c3a9/master/w_120,c_limit/Hutson-BM-6.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64fb89374984dce7e190c3a9/master/w_240,c_limit/Hutson-BM-6.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64fb89374984dce7e190c3a9/master/w_320,c_limit/Hutson-BM-6.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64fb89374984dce7e190c3a9/master/w_640,c_limit/Hutson-BM-6.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64fb89374984dce7e190c3a9/master/w_960,c_limit/Hutson-BM-6.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64fb89374984dce7e190c3a9/master/w_1280,c_limit/Hutson-BM-6.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64fb89374984dce7e190c3a9/master/w_1600,c_limit/Hutson-BM-6.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Last year, Burning Man was exceptionally hot and dusty. Those conditions persuaded many people not to return this year. But last week, we yearned for the heat and the dust. When people ask me whether the event has changed much since I started going, I say it hasn&#39;t. It&#39;s grown bigger; bars now ask for ID; Instagram wasn&#39;t a thing before. But those changes are minor. Climate change could be an existential risk. If it gets too hot on the playa, some people will die, and many more will stop coming; if heavier rain falls, a &lt;em >;FEMA&lt;/em>; situation could unfold. Logistically, financially, ethically, That Thing in the Desert might become untenable. From Reno, I reached out to the Burning Man Project to ask whether they&#39;ll be planning things differently next year. A spokesperson later wrote that “it would be too soon to know if anything next year might need to change.”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;pkvgs&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;As those road-blockaders saw, Burning Man is not only a victim of environmental change but also a perpetrator of it.

Larry Harvey, Burning Man&#39;s late founder, once &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://brcweekly.com/BRCWeekly2023_ext.pdf&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://brcweekly.com/BRCWeekly2023_ext.pdf&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://brcweekly.com/BRCWeekly2023_ext.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;said&lt;/a>; that the festival would be over when it was everywhere else—that is, when its ethos had become the Zeitgeist.

They can take myriad forms. Humanity may face a climate apocalypse, or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/science/annals-of-artificial-intelligence/can-we-stop-the-singularity&quot;>;another kind of apocalypse&lt;/a>;, and selfishness and resentment and bad vibes will surely emerge, but so will generosity, practicality, and good vibes. Waiting for the shuttle to the Reno airport on Tuesday, I asked a woman from Montreal about her Burn. She&#39;d also seen someone shovelling mud out of the porta-potties; other people noticed what was happening and grabbed their own shovels. “The news said we&#39;d become like &#39;Lord of the Flies,&#39; ” she told me. “But we&#39;re not animals. This is what we do.” ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;feature-large-callout&quot; >;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;A person lifts weights surrounded by mud at Burning Man in 2023&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64fb893e3d9eedcbff92ed05/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Hutson-BM-Ender.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64fb893e3d9eedcbff92ed05/master/w_120,c_limit/Hutson-BM-Ender.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64fb893e3d9eedcbff92ed05/master/w_240,c_limit/Hutson-BM-Ender.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64fb893e3d9eedcbff92ed05/master/w_320,c_limit/Hutson-BM-Ender.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64fb893e3d9eedcbff92ed05/master/w_640,c_limit/Hutson-BM-Ender.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64fb893e3d9eedcbff92ed05/master/w_960,c_limit/Hutson-BM-Ender.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64fb893e3d9eedcbff92ed05/master/w_1280,c_limit/Hutson-BM-Ender.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64fb893e3d9eedcbff92ed05/master/w_1600,c_limit/Hutson-BM-Ender.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 09 Sep 2023 07:06:01 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
