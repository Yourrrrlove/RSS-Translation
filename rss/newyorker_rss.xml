data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;问答进行到一半。 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-political-scene/why-is-nikki-haley-running-for-president&quot;>;妮基·黑利&lt;/a>;市政厅的一部分本月早些时候，在新罕布什尔州梅里马克的对外战争退伍军人哨所，一位名叫特德·约翰逊的男子站起来宣布美国正在走向内战。 “那么，”他问海莉，“我怎样才能回到十九世纪八十年代的那一天，那时我很快乐，在街上跑步，骑自行车？”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;碰巧，海莉经常提起八十年代。她最近出版的书的标题取自玛格丽特·撒切尔夫人的名言，她在竞选活动中经常引用撒切尔夫人的话。上个月，在第一届共和党总统辩论上在这场辩论&lt;/a>;中，她向迄今为止最多的观众抛出了“如果你想要做某事，就去问女人”这句台词。 2 月份，黑莉竞选活动的一段视频预告片以珍妮·柯克帕特里克 (Jeane Kirkpatrick)（民主党人后来成为罗纳德·里根 (Ronald Reagan) 的新保守主义外交政策顾问）在 1984 年共和党全国代表大会上发表讲话的一段模糊片段开始。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;美国总统竞选季节非常漫长，大多数候选人通常都有机会享受“片刻”。这是尼基·黑利 (Nikki Haley) 的：CNN 最近的大选预选赛预选赛显示，她以最大优势击败了&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tag/joe-biden&quot;>;乔·拜登&lt;/a>;共和党候选人，包括&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tag/donald-trump&quot;>;唐纳德·特朗普&lt;/a>;。在第一次辩论之后，正如《华盛顿邮报》&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2023/08/25/nikki-haley-republican-debate-competence /&quot;>;说起来&lt;/a>;，海莉“赢得了智慧和经验”，大卫·布鲁克斯 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/24/opinion/nikki-haley-republican-辩论-winner.html&quot;>;写道&lt;/a>;是时候“给海莉机会”了；甚至&lt;em>;新共和国&lt;/em>;也发表了一篇&lt;a href=&quot;https://newrepublic.com/article/175317/nikki-haley-2024-campaign-biden-scared&quot;>;文章&lt;/a>;来解释为什么她“吓坏了拜登竞选团队”。海莉并不以孤立主义者或民粹主义者的身份出现。她没有称政府为“政权”，也没有将这个国家与衰落的罗马帝国进行比较；在我参加的她的活动中，她从未说过“醒来”这个词，甚至从未说过“自由派”或“精英”这个词。她喜欢说“我总是说出残酷的事实”这句陈词滥调，这句简单的陈词滥调让她在非特朗普的共和党初选阵容中脱颖而出，而不是像 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/ tag/ron-desantis&quot;>;罗恩·德桑蒂斯&lt;/a>; 或 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/vivek-ramaswamy-is-not-the-next-trump&quot;>;维韦克·拉马斯瓦米&lt;/a>;，不像&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tag/mike-pence&quot;>;迈克·彭斯&lt;/a>;对黄金时代的吸引力那样毫无生气。&lt;/ p>;&lt;p>;在国外战争退伍军人哨所，入口处有一个闪烁的标志，宣传肉类抽奖活动。一位前空军护士介绍了海莉，她穿着喇叭形蓝色牛仔裤和白色蕾丝毛衣来回踱步。当约翰逊问她如何才能回到八十年代时，她把他的幻灭和对过去时代的怀念视为一个令人心酸的故事的开场——民主党人通常会讲这种故事——关于一个移民的女儿埋葬​​南方联盟旗帜的故事。 &lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;“我不知道不知道你们是否还记得，几年前我们在南卡罗来纳州发生了一场可怕的教堂枪击事件，”她说。她讲述了 2015 年，一名年轻的白人男子在查尔斯顿的伊曼纽尔非洲卫理公会教堂与九名黑人一起参加圣经学习后，谋杀了他们。枪手的文章呼吁进行种族战争，他的网站上还刊登了他举着南方邦联旗帜的照片；海莉决定南卡罗来纳州是时候把自 1961 年以来一直飘扬在州议会大厦前的那面旗帜摘下来了。海莉说，为了说服州立法者投票赞成，她告诉他们陪伴她的父亲（一名锡克教徒）的事。在一所历史悠久的黑人大学任教，在他们居住的小镇短途旅行时购买杂货；店主看到她父亲的头巾后报了警。 “每次我要去机场，我都必须经过那个农产品摊。而且，每次经过它，我都会感到疼痛。不要让任何孩子必须经过州议会大厦，看到那面旗帜并感到痛苦。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;离开市政厅后，我坐在约翰逊旁边的折叠椅上。 “我在 2016 年和 2020 年支持特朗普，但现在我想要团结，”他告诉我。 “我是海利皈依者。我昨晚订了她的标志。现在，我已经为布尔古姆准备了一份，但很快就会被取消。”我告诉他，我想我看到他在海莉关于国旗的即兴表演中流泪了。 “我完全忘记了这一点，”他说。 “她是真正把它拿下来的人——她与共和党人、民主党人、信仰领袖、社区领袖合作。当我说十九世纪八十年代时，妈妈让我出了家门，直到天黑我才回家。每个人都互相喜欢，每个人都很开心。我和我的妻子现在是独立人士，海莉会吸引像我们这样的人。她也会拉拢温和的民主党人。”他接着说，“这里有很多特朗普的基地，在偏远地区。他们希望亨特付出代价，他们希望希拉里付出代价。这不会让我们的国家一事无成。”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;“你还记得吗，当你长大的时候，多么简单生活怎么样，感觉有多安全？”海莉向观众提出了这样的问题，当她走向汤姆·佩蒂和伤心乐队的《美国女孩》时，观众们报以热烈的掌声。 “你不想再来一次吗？”他们做到了，他们也做到了。海莉说，她在第一次辩论后七十二小时内筹集了 100 万美元，她在新罕布什尔州的竞选活动充满了胜利的基调。在她的市政厅期间，我注意到观众会自发地使用她的措辞。 （“我来这里是因为这场辩论，”一位选民说，“而你却说出了残酷的事实。”）梅琳达·图朗乔（Melinda Tourangeau）是一名沙漠风暴老兵，她戴着珍珠、粉色口红和条纹西装外套，她告诉我，“我还没有”自罗纳德·里根以来，没有人如此热爱政治家。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;黑莉对未来的主张让人回想起共和党的一种更传统的愿景——人们可能认为当代政党没有用的那种候选人身份——但精明的建制保守派可能是拜登最大的威胁。海莉现在在新罕布什尔州初选民意调查中与德桑蒂斯并列第二位——当然，特朗普是第一——但更重要的是，她似乎对拜登需要赢得的一群温和派郊区选民具有真正的吸引力。她摘下了南部邦联的旗帜，并不直接敌视跨性别者权利或女性的选择权，并站在自由国际主义一边支持&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tag/ukraine&quot; >;乌克兰&lt;/a>;。她是该国第一位女性少数族裔州长，而且从未在选举中落败。她的主张尤其具有包容性：“我们应该希望赢得大多数美国人的支持，”她说。 “我们的解决方案是正确的，但你不能通过将人们拒之门外来做到这一点。你可以通过打开帐篷来做到这一点。我们需要更多的人。我们需要年轻人，我们需要女性，我们需要非裔美国人，我们需要亚洲人，我们需要西班牙裔人。你不会去找他们说：“你应该和我们在一起。”你去找他们说：“你关心什么？” ”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;在 VFW 的前一天，Haley 来到了佛蒙特州边境的克莱蒙特 (Claremont)，这是一个位于佛蒙特州边境的曾经繁荣的磨坊小镇，参加了当地一家老年中心游戏室的市政厅活动。墙上钉着一个车牌，上面写着“退休：不用担心，不用着急，不用电话，不用老板。”附近有一个标志，警告人们不要上当受骗。根据白板上草书写的菜单，晚餐是牧羊人馅饼。海莉穿着一件蓝色条纹衬衫和白色露趾麻底鞋走了进来，上面有浅粉色的修脚。活动规模较小；每个记者的出席人数不超过十人。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;海莉通常会用一个简短的家庭起源故事来开始她的巡回演讲：南卡罗来纳州两个红绿灯小镇上唯一的印第安人——“我们不够白”成为白人，我们还不够黑人”——她的父母告诉她，他们在美国是多么幸运。她谈到凌晨四点送她的丈夫（一名退伍军人）前往非洲进行为期一年的部署。她指出，在从政之前，她是一名毕业于公立大学的会计师。 （没有法学院，没有常春藤盟校。）她总是说，“我们首先要解决的是这种席卷我们国家的民族自我厌恶情绪”——这是对柯克帕特里克“责怪美国第一”演讲的回想她在信中表示，美国人民了解“无休止的自我批评和自我贬低的危险”。海莉喜欢在总结时坚称，她很高兴一生都被低估了：“这让我斗志旺盛。”&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;她还会在不引起任何注意的情况下组织一些欢快的、预设的玩笑。彭斯或德桑蒂斯，或者就这一点而言，现任总统的畏缩。她脸上露出专注、积极倾听的表情，面带微笑，并且不会打断别人的话。她说到一半就停下来对房间后面打喷嚏的人说“保佑你”。她抱着一名正在哭泣的选民的婴儿，并熬夜与负责活动的当地警察交谈。我旁边的两位女士向我汇报情况：“这太棒了——一个真正取得了成就的人。”两个学龄儿童想要海莉的签名，当他们走到队伍前面时，她跪下来与他们进行了详细的商谈，然后在他们的笔记本上签下了“上帝保佑你们”。&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt; /div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node- id=&quot;rblpljs&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot;

data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;在新罕布什尔州举行的共和党活动不仅有寻找后特朗普候选人的共和党人参加，还有共和党人参加。许多听众是民主党人和独立人士，他们仔细聆听，看看他们是否能找到拜登的替代者。在克莱蒙特市政厅，我与戴着绿松石角框眼镜的巴雷·平斯克进行了交谈。 “我是一名艺术家、雕塑家，所以我应该是一名民主党人，”他说。 “我喜欢奥巴马和里根。奥巴马很酷，他可以和杰里·宋飞 (Jerry Seinfeld) 一起骑行，而里根则是男人中的男人。我没有结婚，也没有孩子，但我有家庭价值观。所有这些事情对我来说都很重要。所以正因为我是一个自由的人，所以我仍然有怀旧的、美国式的观点。”他接着说，“共和党一团糟，如果有人不以中间派的身份加入，共和党就没有机会获胜。我希望看到他们找到一个能够吸引那些摇摆选民的人。我就是他们正在寻找的那种选民，而且我正在喝 Haley Kool-Aid。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Haley 是共和党初选中唯一的女性候选人，这一事实让新州的许多选民都感到惊讶。汉普郡告诉我，他们不自觉地被吸引了。当海莉二月份宣布参选时，唐·柠檬 (Don Lemon) 因称她 51 岁“已经过了巅峰期”而被 CNN 解雇。 （海莉后来说，她通过出售写着“&lt;em>;我的巅峰期已过&lt;/em>;？”的啤酒酒杯，为她的竞选活动筹集了两万五千美元。）平斯克告诉我，“她将母性精神带到了领导职位上” ”。海莉大多给人鹰派和强硬的印象，但她偶尔也会表现出某种母性能量。在南卡罗来纳州，枪击事件发生后，她说，“我必须用双臂拥抱我的州并保护她。”后来：“我认为白宫需要一位妈妈。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;在梅里马克的退伍军人哨所，她的鹰派立场赢得了人群的欢呼。一位穿着美国国旗 T 恤、名叫保罗的男子告诉我：“我希望有人愿意对中国扣动核扳机。把这件事结束吧，即使这将是我们的终结。玛格丽特·撒切尔、戈尔达·梅厄——我们需要一个坚强的人。”海利的国际经验很有吸引力：一位名叫芭芭拉·希利的前陆军护士说，“俄罗斯、中国、朝鲜可能会来敲我们的门——我们需要一个能够应对这些问题的人。”观众喜欢海莉说，作为联合国大使，她可以把美国背上的“踢我”牌子拿下来。我想知道她对乌克兰的干预政策会如何发挥作用，因为特朗普、德桑蒂斯和拉马斯瓦米都希望美国减少参与。她主张向乌克兰提供武器和金钱作为短期爱国义务；快速结束战争将使像她丈夫这样的退伍军人不再参加战斗，并向中国和俄罗斯展示实力。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;当被问及后罗伊时代的美国时，海莉的回答是模棱两可的这样可以避免疏远大多数反堕胎选民，同时也设法吸引自由主义者。 “我要告诉你们我的残酷真相，因为我认为美国人没有了解这种情况的真相，”她在梅里马克说道。 “我不会评判任何支持堕胎的人。”她提到了一位被强奸的大学室友；她谈到了她丈夫的收养和她自己的怀孕困难。海莉呼吁达成共识——“难道我们都不能同意吗？”——将她从可能失去选票的极端行为中拯救出来，但也向一些人表明，她在那些本应定义她的问题上缺乏坚定的信念。前共和党政治顾问斯图尔特·史蒂文斯告诉我：“矛盾的是，她说了所有这些话，但在涉及到这些问题时，她仍然会竞选并投票给特朗普。” “这个人曾向党内最右翼分子示好，并对他们说了积极的话。海莉和玛乔丽·泰勒·格林之间的差异最终纯粹是审美上的，但我不认为 MTG 阅读民意调查是为了提醒她深切感受到的信念。海莉竞选总统并试图取悦所有人是一种轻浮的行为。”海莉以不同的方式描述了这一点，将其描述为“加法的故事”。在宣布参选后不久，她告诉巴里韦斯：“我比其他人更有可能赢得大选，这是有原因的。这是因为我认同&lt;em>;这么多&lt;/em>;很多不同的人。”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;在兽医发布后， Haley 参观了曼彻斯特的一所特许学校 Founders Academy，与保守派倡导团体创始人 Tiffany Justice 一起举办市政厅活动 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/11/07 /the-right-wing-mothers-fuelling-the-school-board-wars&quot;>;妈妈们争取自由&lt;/a>;。在此之前，她与校长、一些老师和几位竞选当地学校董事会的妈妈一起参加了一次圆桌会议。闷热的教室里，按颜色排列的莎士比亚作品旁边，挂着一张海报，上面写着“亲爱的，生活很艰难，但你也一样”。餐桌上的一位妈妈用袖珍宪法给她的孩子扇风。海莉让它变得无聊。 “我们不想要民主党和共和党的父母，”她说。 “我们想要所有的父母。难道所有的父母不都希望透明吗？”在学校图书馆举行的市政厅会议上，一名坐在架子上的新闻摄影师撞破了架子，彩色铅笔飞得到处都是。海莉讲述了一个故事，当她七年级时，她的父亲没有签署她的性教育许可单，所以她在课程期间不得不独自坐在一个房间里。 “这不是由学校决定的，”她说。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;海莉说，拜登因与妈妈争取自由组织一起举办活动而称她为“&lt;em>;MAGA&lt;/em>;极端分子”。 “那就算我为他们中的一员吧！”她开玩笑说。她的表现很传统，而不是极端，提出了保守派希望听到的所有观点，但又不会陷入与迪士尼的全面斗争，也不会像德桑蒂斯和拉马斯瓦米那样好战，承诺废除教育部。她在跨性别问题上的表现与在堕胎问题上的表现是一样的，与大多数其他共和党候选人相比，有时给人的印象几乎是进步的。 “我相信自由，”海莉说。 “如果成年人决定要变性，我们欢迎他们这样做。” （最近，就连特朗普似乎也意识到在这些问题上采取不妥协立场的危险：他称德桑蒂斯的堕胎禁令是一个“可怕的错误”，并告诉梅金·凯利，他听说男人现在可以生育了。） 在高级中心，海莉提醒人群，共和党在过去八次总统选举中的七次都输掉了普选，百分之七十八的父母认为他们的孩子不会比他们过上更好的生活。她在“自由妈妈”组织中表现得很好，同时又采取了温和路线，她对拜登的微妙反驳是，这一切都可以变得简单，而不是进步派和极端主义者之间的永远的战争。海莉分享了她经常在竞选活动中讲述的一件轶事，回忆起她在学校因印度人被嘲笑时母亲对她的建议：“你的工作不是向他们展示你的不同之处。你的工作就是向他们展示你们有多么相似。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;在克莱蒙特，在问答中。 A. 中，一位名叫戴尔·贾尔斯 (Dale Giles) 的选民将黑莉 (Haley) 误认为是图尔西·加巴德 (Tulsi Gabbard)。在海莉澄清自己并非如此后，贾尔斯仍然开始批评：“看来你对特朗普怀有敌意。我对你只有最崇高的敬意。”贾尔斯戴着一顶道奇帽子，穿着一件类似沃尔玛标签的衬衫，上面写着“拜登：支付更多。”生活更糟”；他口袋里的手机响亮地响着。他更多的是评论而不是问题，最后建议海莉选择南达科他州州长克里斯蒂·诺姆作为她的竞选搭档。 （“我认为这意味着你是女性的粉丝！”海莉回答道。）随后，贾尔斯上前与海莉合影，他们聊了几分钟。我询问他对这位候选人的印象，几分钟前他还以为他是别人。 “我很想看到乔带她到谷仓后面，”他微笑着说道，在我等着看他要带它去哪里时停顿了一下。 “让她踢他的屁股。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;即使黑莉最有可能击败拜登，但这并不意味着她会成为共和党提名人。 （在新罕布什尔州，与德桑蒂斯并列第二仍然意味着他们都输给了特朗普三十七分。）正如八十年代怀旧者约翰逊所称的那样，“在边远地区”的基地黑莉是强硬派，是党内全球主义、反民粹主义、企业派的典型奋斗代表。在&lt;em>;泰晤士报&lt;/em>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/15/opinion/nikki-haley-president.html&quot;>;圆桌&lt;/a>;中，名为“Nikki海莉不会成为下一任总统，”保守派专栏作家丹尼尔·麦卡锡写道，她“太代表了党内精英的愿望，希望被视为工人阶级的合理护民官。” （在辩论中，拉马斯瓦米祝愿海莉“在洛克希德公司和雷神公司董事会的未来职业生涯一切顺利。”）她显然对自己作为候选人形象中的这一缺陷很敏感；在播客上，当被要求说出她读过的最后一本书时，她给出了“&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Hillbilly-Elegy-Memoir-Family-Culture/dp/0062300547” data-event-click=&quot;{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Hillbilly-Elegy-Memoir-Family-Culture/dp/0062300547&quot;} “ href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Hillbilly-Elegy-Memoir-Family-Culture/dp/0062300547&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;乡巴佬挽歌&lt;/a>;，作者：JD万斯. “尼基正在竞选大西洋理事会的主席，而不是总统提名，”塔克·卡尔森告诉我。 “她并不是想赢得特朗普选民。她正在做一些更隐蔽、更困难的事情，那就是让专业级的特朗普仇恨者忘记，就在几年前，她还为他工作过。 NPR 听众平均会投票给多少位特朗普内阁部长？妮基是唯一的人。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;海莉温和地将自己定位为推动党超越特朗普的人——“我们必须选出一位&lt;em>;新的&lt;/em>;保守派领导人”，但也没有谴责他但在克莱蒙特，她一直被要求明确表达对前总统的效忠。贾尔斯说：“当你在辩论中举手说即使特朗普总统入狱你也会支持他时，人们想知道你是否在撒谎。” “你现在可以和我们一起举手表示你会支持特朗普总统吗？”对于那些真正想获胜的人来说，在这场竞选中可能最重要的立场——不稳定的特朗普路线上，黑莉能够灵活地做出转变。她提醒选民，她能够“没有发一条推文”离开特朗普政府，尊严完好无损。尽管八十年代很伟大，但海莉务实的模棱两可可能是她最好的武器。她明白决定某一时刻能否持续的真正决定因素的“残酷事实”。她如何摆脱“是”或“否”，对特朗普举手还是放下？ “我说的是残酷的事实，”她微笑着回答。 ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;c1jlo&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;

After taking power in 2017, he restored the Republican majority on the five-person National Labor Relations Board, the agency that was established during the New Deal to support workers&#39; rights to organize and bargain collectively. Trump appointed a former House Republican staffer, Marvin Kaplan, as chair of the NLRB Under GOP leadership, the agency quickly moved to reverse several pro-labor rulings that it had issued during the Obama Administration, including one that made it easier for workers at fast-food franchises to organize. This pro-employer slant continued throughout Trump&#39;s term. In December, 2019, the agency issued two rulings that introduced new restrictions on unionization votes and made it easier for firms to classify workers as independent contractors, thus depriving them of union wage scales and benefits.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Contrast this record with the actions of the NLRB under Biden, who appointed two former union lawyers to its board and another former union lawyer, Jennifer Abruzzo, as its general counsel. In the past couple of years, the agency has abrogated many of its Trump-era rulings, including the ones related to voting procedures and independent contractors. Last month, the NLRB ruled that if a company engages in intimidatory behavior during a unionization election, such as firing union organizers, the agency will order the company to recognize the union and bargain collectively. In another ruling, the NLRB set out new rules for unionization votes, which require votes to be held promptly and restrict efforts by employers to delay them, which are very common occurrences.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Labor activists and commentators sympathetic to unions praised these decisions. Writing for &lt;em>;The American Prospect&lt;/em>;, Harold Meyerson &lt;a href=&quot;https://prospect.org/labor/2023-08-28-bidens-nlrb-brings-workers-rights-back/&quot;>;hailed&lt;/a>; the NLRB&#39;s anti-intimidation edict as its “most important ruling in many decades.” The issuance of the two rulings together, Meyerson added, “effectively makes union organizing possible again, after decades in which unpunished employer illegality was the most decisive factor in reducing the nation&#39;s rate of private-sector unionization from roughly 35 percent to the bare 6 percent at which it stands today.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;As the rate of unionization has steadily declined, most Republicans have consistently opposed legislative efforts to reverse that trend, including two bills that would have made it easier for unions to organize: the Employee Free Choice Act, which a Democratic-controlled House passed in 2007, and the Protecting the Right to Organize (&lt;em >;PRO&lt;/em>;) Act, which the House passed in 2019 and again in 2021. (On the latter occasion, five Republicans voted for the bill; two hundred and five didn&#39;t.)&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;To quote an old saying, actions speak louder than words. On Friday, Representative Slotkin went to a Ford assembly plant in Wayne, Michigan, and spoke to some striking UAW workers. The Democratic senators Gary Peters, of Michigan, and John Fetterman, of Pennsylvania, have also appeared on the picket lines. Bernie Sanders has railed against “corporate greed” at a UAW rally in Detroit. What about Trump and Pence and the rest of the Republican UAW stalwarts? So far, they have been conspicuously absent. On Monday, the &lt;em>;Times&lt;/em>; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/18/us/politics/trump-detroit-debate.html&quot;>;reported&lt;/a>; that Trump is planning to visit Detroit on September 27th, the day of the second Republican candidates&#39; debate, and speak to a crowd of workers, including autoworkers. It remains to be seen what sort of reception he receives. “Every fiber of our union is being poured into fighting the billionaire class and an economy that enriches people like Donald Trump at the expense of workers,” Shawn Fain, the UAW president, said in a statement after the &lt;em>;Times&lt;/em>; story appeared. ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;d6r6ns&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot;

>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;On Monday, after eight years inside Iran&#39;s Evin Prison, notorious for its brutal conditions, Siamak Namazi stepped through the door of a Qatar Airways plane that had just flown him to freedom and paused. From the top of the steps, he looked around, cracked &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/5-detained-americans-freed-iran-us-official-confirms/story?id=103159837&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/5-detained-americans-freed-iran-us-official-confirms/story?id=103159837&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/5-detained-americans-freed-iran-us-official-confirms/story?id=103159837&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;a smile, then waved&lt;/a>;—at no one in particular. Minutes later, he issued a statement from Doha, before his transfer for the final leg of his journey to Washington to reunite with his family. His “ineffable joy,” he said, was laced with “a painful and deep feeling of guilt” because so many still languished behind Evin&#39;s hostile walls. “All the political prisoners of Iran,” he said, “deserve their liberty.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;According to Belgian government officials, Iran currently holds at least twenty-two Europeans, including a European Union diplomat. The release of Namazi and four other Americans, as part of a prisoner swap that culminated two years of plodding diplomacy, will almost certainly not bring an end to an Iranian tactic that has spanned more than four decades and imprisoned almost a hundred US citizens. “Hostage-taking keeps the zealots in power, even at the cost of Iran&#39;s remaining an international pariah/polecat whose passport is worthless, whose currency is worthless,” John Limbert, one of the fifty-two Americans held for four hundred and forty-four days after Iranian students seized the US Embassy in the aftermath of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tag/iranian-revolution&quot;>;1979 revolution&lt;/a>;, told me. Detaining foreigners is also an essential ploy in the gamesmanship among rival factions inside Iran. Limbert added, “As long as the ultra-&lt;em >;MIGA&lt;/em>; (Make Iran Great Again) faction there needs to show that it&#39;s in charge, it will continue to take actions—like hostage-taking—to discredit its political rivals, no matter the associated costs.” One of Limbert&#39;s captors told him in 1979, “This isn&#39;t about you; this isn&#39;t about the Shah; this isn&#39;t about the US It&#39;s about us. We have our internal fish to fry.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Namazi, a former fellow at the National Endowment for Democracy and the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington, was the longest held of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://iranprimer.usip.org/blog/2023/sep/18/iran-us-prisoner-swap-profiles&quot;>;five Americans&lt;/a>; released on Monday. He was detained, in 2015, while visiting his parents in Tehran and was charged with coöperating with an enemy state. To pressure Washington, Iranian intelligence then arrested several more Americans, including Namazi&#39;s father, Baquer, a former &lt;em >;UNICEF&lt;/em>; official.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Since 2018, Iranian officials have refused to talk with their American counterparts, after the Trump Administration pulled out of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tag/iran-nuclear-deal&quot;>;Iran nuclear deal&lt;/a>;. The Trump White House also imposed more than fifteen hundred new sanctions on Iran to squeeze its economy. Last October, Iran allowed Baquer Namazi to leave the country for urgent medical care. Diplomatic momentum picked up in the spring, and played out over a reported nine rounds of awkward diplomacy conducted through third parties, mainly Qatar and Oman. In tiny Doha, Qatari officials &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/12/politics/iran-prisoner-deal-took-shuttle-diplomacy-from-hotel-to-hotel/index.html&quot;>;shuttled&lt;/a>; between the American and Iranian delegations staying at different hotels.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Two of the other Americans released by Iran on Monday were identified as Morad Tahbaz, an environmentalist who tracked rare Asiatic cheetahs and was sentenced, in 2019, to ten years for spying, and Emad Shargi, a businessman with a capital-investment fund who was sentenced in 2020 to ten years for espionage; two others released in the deal declined to be identified.&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;The terms of the deal sparked criticism even before it took place on Monday morning. In exchange for the five Americans, the United States released &lt;a href=&quot;https://iranprimer.usip.org/blog/2023/sep/18/iran-us-prisoner-swap-profiles&quot;>;five Iranians&lt;/a>;—four held on charges related to sanctions-busting matériel that could be used for military purposes and one for allegedly failing to register as a foreign agent for the Islamic Republic. Only two wanted to return to Iran. Two preferred to remain in the United States, the Iranian Foreign Ministry &lt;a href=&quot;https://iranprimer.usip.org/blog/2023/sep/18/iran-us-prisoner-swap-profiles&quot;>;acknowledged&lt;/a>; on Monday. Another will join relatives in a third country.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The most contested element of the deal is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tag/joe-biden&quot;>;Biden Administration&lt;/a>;&#39;s agreement to issue a waiver so that South Korea could transfer six billion dollars in frozen assets that it owes Iran for past oil purchases. The terms stipulated that the funds be deposited in a restricted account permanently controlled by Qatar, which will oversee and pay out for Iran&#39;s designated purchases for humanitarian goods, such as food, medical, educational, and agricultural goods. (For years, Iran imported &lt;a href=&quot;https://qz.com/91152/the-us-has-sent-nearly-2-million-worth-of-bull-sperm-to-iran-this-year&quot;>;hundreds of thousands of dollars&lt;/a>; in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/02/magazine/02IRAN-t.html&quot;>;bull semen&lt;/a>; from the United States to breed cows.) No money will ever go into Iran, a senior US official told reporters on Sunday. “This channel is designed explicitly, again, to guard against money laundering, misuse of Asian and US sanctions,” he said. “If Iran tries to divert the funds or use them for anything other than a limited humanitarian purpose as authorized, we&#39;ll take action to lock up the funds.” The US Treasury will also have oversight on all of Iran&#39;s designated purchases. It expects that the funds will be used over years, not all immediately.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Both Republican and Democratic Presidents have engaged in prisoner or hostage swaps in the past, but Republicans have condemned the terms of the agreement with Iran. Senator Ted Cruz, the Texas Republican, called the six billion dollars a “ransom” payment. Others charge that Iran will be able to free up the six billion dollars it would need for humanitarian purchases and use it for military or other nefarious ends. “Iran&#39;s leaders will take the money and run,” Senator Tom Cotton, the Arkansas Republican, &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://twitter.com/SenTomCotton/status/1701626584405287410&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://twitter.com/SenTomCotton/status/1701626584405287410&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/SenTomCotton/status/1701626584405287410&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;wrote on social media&lt;/a>; last week. “What on earth did Joe Biden think would happen?” On Monday, he added, “Two of the five Iranians released as part of this terrible deal will stay in the US Joe Biden&#39;s embarrassing appeasement not only makes Iran stronger, it makes America less safe.” On &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/SenJohnThune/posts/pfbid02hCrVjyvwXiCySW27NKZ5oRtYbgv65yKCoVmAkSDC5ECrGvBCHA8L12GvBz3crXbNl&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.facebook.com/SenJohnThune/posts/pfbid02hCrVjyvwXiCySW27NKZ5oRtYbgv65yKCoVmAkSDC5ECrGvBCHA8L12GvBz3crXbNl&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/SenJohnThune/posts/pfbid02hCrVjyvwXiCySW27NKZ5oRtYbgv65yKCoVmAkSDC5ECrGvBCHA8L12GvBz3crXbNl&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;Facebook&lt;/a>;, Senator John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, said he supported efforts to bring home Americans detained abroad, “but Iran will now count pallets of ransom money, putting its leaders in a better position to develop a nuclear weapon and fund terrorists. And the price to release US hostages will only go up.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;On Monday, the White House announced a new round of sanctions on the former Iranian President &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tag/mahmoud-ahmadinejad&quot;>;Mahmoud Ahmadinejad&lt;/a>;, as well as Iran&#39;s ministry of intelligence, for their past involvement in the wrongful detentions of Americans. The Biden Administration hopes the swap will enable other diplomatic openings with Iran, notably on Iran&#39;s increasingly advanced nuclear program. According to Kelsey Davenport, the director for nonproliferation policy at the Arms Control Association, Tehran now has enriched uranium to more than sixty per cent and—if it made the political decision to build a bomb—could fuel up to three nuclear weapons. Officials in Washington have also long wanted to deal with Iran on regional issues, such as Iran&#39;s proxy attacks on Americans in the Middle East and the war in Yemen between rival factions supported by Iran and Saudi Arabia. The United States had less room to maneuver on these issues while Americans were imprisoned in Iran. So the swap is a first step. But a very tiny step. ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;3hnu3d&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;yro6ok&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 19 Sep 2023 06:06:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[The Fight Against Climate Change Returns to the Streets]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-fight-against-climate-change-returns-to-the-streets]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-18T19:28:28.079Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65086f4d98443ed0f81910d1/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/McKibben-Climate-march.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;article >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attribute-verso-pattern=&quot;article-body&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;ArticlePageChunks&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Keeping movements alive is hard work—they run on volunteer energy, and they can be derailed by too much success, too much failure, too much internal strife, too many competing interests. Or they can be hindered by a pandemic, which largely brought the climate movement to a halt just months after its biggest single day, in September of 2019, when millions of people around the world, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/new-yorks-climate-strike-and-the-things-that-make-teen-agers-march&quot;>;most of them young&lt;/a>;, took to the streets; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/photo-booth/the-faces-of-young-protesters-at-new-york-citys-climate-strike&quot;>;in New York City&lt;/a>;, according to organizers, a quarter million of them joined the then sixteen-year-old Swedish climate activist &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/books/under-review/how-greta-thunberg-transformed-existential-dread-into-a-movement&quot;>;Greta Thunberg&lt;/a>; down at the Battery.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Sunday&#39;s March to End Fossil Fuels was not as big—Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, in a rousing wrap-up speech at the end of the day, estimated the crowd at between fifty and seventy thousand people, the organizers said seventy-five thousand, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/17/climate/climate-protests-new-york.html&quot;>;the &lt;em>;Times&lt;/em>;&lt;/a>; went with “tens of thousands.” But that didn&#39;t matter—the march was considerably larger than organizers had expected, and represented a real return to the streets for climate campaigners. I wandered back and forth along the line of march, which went from Broadway in the fifties crosstown to First Avenue, near the United Nations; the sun was bright, spirits were high, and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/children-lead-the-way-a-gallery-of-youth-made-climate-strike-signs&quot;>;signs&lt;/a>; were clever.

Clearly, the climate movement, led by Indigenous groups and frontline communities, has come through the past few years intact; enormous credit is due to the organizers, including Jean Su, of the national NGO the Center for Biological Diversity (“Our Mission: Saving Life on Earth”), who pulled together a major march in a matter of months.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Yet, just as clearly, this movement needs to expand again. Campaigns draw their structure from the committed activists at the core, but they draw their power from the large numbers of less intensely engaged citizens that they can entice in for a little while; victory for movements means somehow reaching into the broad middle and convincing people that they can play an important role, even if they do so just temporarily. In September of 2014, for instance, a climate march across Manhattan drew as many as four hundred thousand marchers. They came less because of existential fear (2014 was practically an ice age compared with the heat and fire we&#39;ve seen this summer) than because they sensed a chance to send a message ahead of the Paris climate talks, and their message was heard. Here&#39;s President Barack Obama speaking at the UN two days later:&lt;/p>;&lt;blockquote >;&lt;div >;&lt;p>;Our citizens keep marching. We cannot pretend we do not hear them. We have to answer the call. We know what we have to do to avoid irreparable harm.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/blockquote>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Representative Ocasio-Cortez &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbCIZebVUtY&quot;>;repeated that theme&lt;/a>; yesterday. “That means something,” she told marchers. “I&#39;m in rooms in Washington all the time where people say that they have a commitment to this issue, but we need urgency.” She may have been thinking of President Biden, who will address the UN General Assembly on Tuesday. At various points in the proceedings, the audience booed at the mention of his name, for having granted permits for new fossil-fuel projects, but they also reserved their loudest cheers for Ocasio-Cortez, who, of course, has endorsed Biden for reëlection; clearly, there&#39;s at least some understanding of the political realities around the beckoning campaign.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I talked to marchers who thought that the attendance should have been higher, given a summer that featured what were likely the highest temperatures in a hundred and twenty-five thousand years, and the Canadian wildfire smoke that filled the skies of American cities, and the epic flooding taking a horrific toll in Libya. But it takes time to grow—or regrow—movements, and the good vibe from this one will make the next such day easier to recruit for. We don&#39;t have endless time, of course. But yesterday was a crucial, jaunty step. The world was marching again. ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;iu6rij&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;93ttz&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 19 Sep 2023 04:06:01 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[The Pope’s Coming Vatican Showdown with American Conservatives]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-popes-coming-vatican-showdown-with-american-conservatives]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-18T16:10:08.378Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65020bfb6a22f972c10daec9/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Elie%20:%20Pope%20Francis&amp;#x27;s%20Coming%20Vatican%20Showdown%20With%20American%20Conservatives.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;article >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attribute-verso-pattern=&quot;article-body&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;ArticlePageChunks&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Pope Francis&#39;s “apostolic journey” to Mongolia earlier this month had the unexpected consequence of bringing Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, a singular and controversial French Jesuit scientist who died nearly seventy years ago, into the news cycle. As it turns out, Teilhard&#39;s theology of cosmic spiritual progress is a useful way to understand the challenges that Francis is currently facing, as he and the Church prepare for a global synod next month in Rome. There, three hundred and sixty-three clerical and lay leaders representing two rival conceptions of the Church will encounter one another for several weeks of behind-closed-doors dialogue—a process that is meant to be amicable but may lead to open conflict prior to a second session next October.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The main question surrounding the Pope&#39;s journey was “Why Mongolia?” The country, with a population of around 3.3 million, has only fifteen hundred Catholics, fewer than in a large parish in Chicago—and far fewer than in other Asian nations, such as Vietnam, which has seven million Catholics and a complex history with the Church, and may have benefitted from a papal visit. (By comparison, in early August, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tag/pope-francis&quot;>;Francis&lt;/a>; celebrated Mass in Lisbon for a million and a half congregants, many of them young people there for World Youth Day.)&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;But the trip suited Francis&#39;s stated wish for the Church to go “to the margins,” and allowed him to spend time with Giorgio Marengo, an Italian cleric who has lived for more than two decades in Mongolia, doing missionary work, such as fostering Catholic-Buddhist dialogue. In August of last year, Francis made Marengo, who is forty-nine, the youngest member of the College of Cardinals, where he is likely to be a progressive presence for decades to come. And being in Mongolia gave Francis an opportunity to direct remarks, implicitly, to the neighboring powers: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tag/russia&quot;>;Russia&lt;/a>;, whose war in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tag/ukraine&quot;>;Ukraine&lt;/a>; has occasioned a shifting and at times confusing response from him; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tag/china&quot;>;China&lt;/a>;, where the Vatican&#39;s agreement to let the government choose which priests become bishops, in exchange for tolerating the Church&#39;s presence in that nation, has been widely criticized.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The trip also expressed Francis&#39;s own long-distance interest in Asia. As a young man in Argentina, he wanted to be a missionary in Japan; then and afterward, he hoped to follow in the footsteps of influential Jesuits who spent large parts of their careers in Asia: St. Francis Xavier, Matteo Ricci, Pedro Arrupe, and Teilhard de Chardin. Born in France in 1881, Teilhard was a restless, searching figure: a priest, a poet, a stretcher-bearer in the First World War, a paleontologist based in China (where, in the nineteen-twenties, he took part in an important expedition in search of human origins), and a mystical theologian. His written work, a sustained effort to reconcile Christian theology with the theory of evolution, placed him in the vanguard of twentieth-century theology—though lately otherwise appreciative theologians have expressed concern that his emphasis on progress through evolution led him to contrast “the advancing wing of humanity” with “definitively unprogressive ethnical groups,” thus aligning himself with movements in support of race-based eugenics. Teilhard&#39;s notion that the earth would someday be surrounded by a complex information system powered by human consciousness has been seen as anticipating the Internet, and the Episcopal homilist at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/photo-booth/outside-windsor-castles-walls-during-prince-harry-and-meghan-markles-wedding&quot;>;Prince Harry&#39;s wedding&lt;/a>; to Meghan Markle, in 2018, alluded to one of Teilhard&#39;s aphorisms: “Someday, after mastering the winds, the waves, the tides, and gravity, we shall harness for God the energies of love, and then, for a second time in the history of the world, man will have discovered fire.” But Teilhard&#39;s most memorable concept is the notion that “&lt;em>;tout ce qui monte&lt;/em>;, &lt;em>;converge&lt;/em>;,” or “everything that rises must converge”—that the various forces of natural evolution and human civilization are all ascending in a pattern of spiritual progress and will converge in a “Point Omega” at the end of time.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;While doing field work in Mongolia, in 1923, Teilhard celebrated what he called a Mass on the World; lacking bread and wine to consecrate in the usual fashion, he simply consecrated the whole physical world, represented by the vast steppe where he stood. The Mass was expressive of Teilhard&#39;s thought, which, in 1927 and afterward, drew the attention of the Vatican, where officials objected to his dismissal of the idea that the human race descended from Adam and Eve, and his corresponding lack of emphasis on the idea of original sin.&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;During the next three decades, Teilhard elaborated on his outlook in a number of essays and two books, “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Divine-Milieu-Newly-revised-Translation-Cowell/dp/1903900581&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Divine-Milieu-Newly-revised-Translation-Cowell/dp/1903900581&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Divine-Milieu-Newly-revised-Translation-Cowell/dp/1903900581&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;The Divine Milieu&lt;/a>;” and “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Phenomenon-Harper-Perennial-Modern-Thought/dp/0061632651&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Phenomenon-Harper-Perennial-Modern-Thought/dp/0061632651&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Phenomenon-Harper-Perennial-Modern-Thought/dp/0061632651&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;The Phenomenon of Man&lt;/a>;.” The Vatican and his Jesuit superiors forbade him to publish any theological writing, but he remained a faithful Catholic and an obedient Jesuit. Following a visit to the US in 1948, he settled in a Jesuit residence in New York City, where he died in 1955, on Easter Sunday—and the posthumous publication of his work began. During the Second Vatican Council, which first convened in 1962, criticism of his work eased, and his books became standard texts for progressive theologians—until they fell out of favor again, under the traditionalist Popes John Paul II and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/benedict-xvis-most-powerful-influence-on-the-catholic-church-came-before-he-was-pope&quot;>;Benedict XVI&lt;/a>;, even as they personally spoke warmly of him from time to time.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;This Pope, however, has looked emphatically to Teilhard as an example. In “Laudato Si,” his landmark encyclical on the climate, from 2015—he is expected to issue another one next month—he cited Teilhard as an inspiration. After celebrating Sunday Mass in Mongolia, Francis spoke ardently about Teilhard, on the centenary of the Mass that he celebrated there. “This priest, often misunderstood,” he said, “intuited that &#39;the Eucharist is always in some way celebrated on the altar of the world.&#39; ” The Pope was bringing the priest back from the margins, and joining his own Asian journey to Teilhard&#39;s.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Francis&#39;s trademark style of discourse is to issue an offhand comment that is clearly on the side of progress, but to remain vague about how progress is to be achieved, and this tendency, too, has lately sparked controversy. Following a video call with young Russian Catholics, on August 25th, in which Francis urged them to connect with their roots in the “Great Russia of saints, rulers, Great Russia of Peter I, Catherine II, that empire—great, enlightened, of great culture and great humanity,” Archbishop Sviatoslav Shevchuk, the head of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church, immediately castigated the Pope for celebrating Russian imperialism past and present. Then the Jesuit journal &lt;em>;La Civiltà Cattolica&lt;/em>; published a partial transcript of a conversation that Francis had with Portuguese Jesuits during his trip earlier that month. When one asked about the open criticism of him by some American Catholics, including bishops, Francis replied at length. “You have seen that in the United States the situation is not easy: there is a very strong reactionary attitude. It is organized and shapes the way people belong, even emotionally,” he said. “I would like to remind those people that &lt;em>;indietrismo&lt;/em>;”—backwardness—“is useless, and we need to understand that there is an appropriate evolution in the understanding of matters of faith.” He later added, “Those American groups you talk about, so closed, are isolating themselves. Instead of living by doctrine, by the true doctrine that always develops and bears fruit, they live by ideologies.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Which American groups, everyone wanted to know, was Francis talking about? In the &lt;em>;Times&lt;/em>;, C. Preston Noell III, of the American Society for the Defense of Tradition, Family, and Property (a Pennsylvania-based offshoot of a Brazilian group founded in 1960 to resist supposed communist influence on the Church), pointed out that Francis has spent less than a week in the United States as Pope, suggesting that he is poorly informed about the life of the Church here. The Washington &lt;em>;Post&lt;/em>; ran a dossier of suspects, among them Raymond Arroyo, a host on the traditionalist Catholic cable network EWTN, based in Alabama, who has personified the network&#39;s opposition to Francis. Others pointed to Cardinal Raymond Burke, who served as the archbishop of St. Louis and then as a Vatican official, until he was removed from one post in 2014 and replaced in a different one earlier this year. In the foreword to a &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Synodal-Process-Pandoras-Box-Questions/dp/1877905771&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Synodal-Process-Pandoras-Box-Questions/dp/1877905771&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Synodal-Process-Pandoras-Box-Questions/dp/1877905771&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;new book&lt;/a>;, Burke writes that the October synod will cause “confusion and error” and lead to “the grave harm of many souls.” The book has been published in eight languages by the Society for the Defense of Tradition, Family, and Property, which has sent copies to bishops and clergy, some of whom will be delegates to the synod.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;a16dn&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;nxwq5&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;It&#39;s likely that these are some of the people Francis had in mind when he spoke to the Jesuits in Portugal. But it&#39;s perhaps more instructive to look at his remarks in terms of American Catholicism&#39;s place in the recent history of Catholicism globally. And this is where the notion that “everything that rises must converge” is apt. A century ago “modernism” and “Americanism” were synonymous in the eyes of Catholic Rome. Vatican II&#39;s affirmation of the principle of religious freedom was rooted in the work of the American Jesuit political philosopher John Courtney Murray. The trip that Pope Paul VI made to New York City, in October, 1965—when he spoke at St. Patrick&#39;s Cathedral, met President Johnson at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, addressed the UN General Assembly, celebrated Mass at Yankee Stadium, and visited the World&#39;s Fair, all in a single day—was arguably the high point of his pontificate. The vernacular liturgy, the modern angular church architecture, the emphasis on amity with other Christian churches and other faiths that came after Vatican II were all a good fit with the populous, influential, flexible, and prosperous American Church. John Paul II, elected in October, 1978, gained iconic stature in two early visits to the US, and was lionized by President Ronald Reagan; John Paul remained hugely popular among American Catholics, even as many disagreed with or distanced themselves from particular positions he took.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;John Paul and a deputy of his, Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, also reshaped the US clergy and hierarchy in their image, promoting men who were fiercely orthodox and squarely against homosexuality and abortion. American cardinals—John O&#39;Connor, in New York; Bernard Law, in Boston; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/what-the-new-vatican-report-shows-about-the-churchs-failure-to-address-sexual-abuse&quot;>;Theodore McCarrick&lt;/a>;, in Newark and Washington, DC—enjoyed exceptional access to the Pope. As Ratzinger succeeded John Paul, becoming Benedict XVI, Timothy Dolan, in New York, Charles Chaput, in Philadelphia, and José Gómez, in Los Angeles, succeeded them as figures whose stature at the Vatican gave them stature in the American Church, and vice versa. As Catholicism was losing influence in Europe and Latin America, in the US it was gaining influence on public policy, a development that would culminate in the reversal of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tag/roe-v-wade&quot;>;Roe v. Wade&lt;/a>;. It wasn&#39;t a stretch to imagine that an American might be elected Pope—Cardinal Dolan, say, whose name showed up on shortlists after Benedict resigned, in 2013.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Instead, the Jesuit cardinal of Buenos Aires was elected. And not only has this first Pope from the Americas shown no special regard for the US; the American Church has become the church that stands between Francis and his vision of Catholicism. That vision is dedicated to the poor and determined to go to the world&#39;s margins, and devoted to the God of “nearness, proximity,” confident that, as Teilhard put it, “God is not remote from us. He is at the point of my pen, my pick, my paintbrush, my needle—and my heart and my thoughts.” The rise of traditionalist American Catholicism, that is, has met with the rise of a progressive Latin American Pontiff, whose vision is focussed on the Global South.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;All of this is prelude to the coming reckoning at next month&#39;s synod. The familiar narrative is that Francis&#39;s age—he will turn eighty-seven in December—is giving urgency to his efforts to foster progress in the Church. But the aging of the American traditionalists is just as significant. Cardinal-archbishops (the ones who head big-city archdioceses) are required to submit their resignations upon reaching seventy-five, and those who are allowed to stay on can no longer vote in the College of Cardinals for a new Pope once they turn eighty. Cardinal Burke is seventy-five; Cardinal Dolan, who will be a delegate at the synod, is seventy-three. There is cause for the traditionalists to worry that Francis will lead the Church into his nineties (as Benedict might have done, had he not retired unexpectedly at age eighty-five) and then yield the papacy to a successor chosen by younger cardinals whom he has appointed. For the traditionalists, then, the synod is something like a last stand, where the legacy of two Popes just past will converge with the determination of the present one. ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;q5sq0c&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 19 Sep 2023 01:06:01 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Jeremy O.

Harris was living in a two-story apartment in London. He had travelled there for a production of his play “Daddy,” about a young Black artist who has fallen under the thrall of an older white man. “Daddy” had débuted, Off Broadway, a year before, and was set to open at the Almeida Theatre at the end of March, 2020; it would have been Harris&#39;s first professional opening overseas. But the show didn&#39;t open, and Harris stayed stranded in London for weeks, then, eventually, for months.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Sad about the play and scared about the world, he passed the first few weeks not writing—although many deadlines, constant companions in his life, hovered at the peripheries of his mind. Since high school, Harris has used the late night and earliest morning as a time to work and party and talk about art with friends; now he binged anime and listened to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/03/23/fiona-apples-art-of-radical-sensitivity&quot;>;Fiona Apple&lt;/a>; and started reading Audre Lorde&#39;s “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Sister-Outsider-Speeches-Crossing-Feminist/dp/1580911862/&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Sister-Outsider-Speeches-Crossing-Feminist/dp/1580911862/&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Sister-Outsider-Speeches-Crossing-Feminist/dp/1580911862/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;Sister Outsider&lt;/a>;,” which he&#39;d always meant to get to. As the weeks wore on, he tired of his vampirism. “I decided that I wanted to see the sun more often,” he said one April morning, as streams of light made bright rectangles on the apartment walls. Waking up at normal hours meant dealing with pedestrian annoyances. He&#39;d begun ordering coffee from a nearby café, and twice in a row, although he ordered it black, it was delivered with milk. “It&#39;s, like, everyone&#39;s watching &#39;The Plot Against America,&#39; ” he said, referring to the HBO miniseries based on the novel by Philip Roth, “and this feels very much like &#39;The Plot Against Jeremy.&#39; ”&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Harris is very tall and very thin, and handles his body with improvised precision, formality within informality, like a dancer on an off day at the mall. A gesture begun in his shoulder always ends at the tips of his fingers. When he gropes for thoughts between sentences, he makes shapes in the air with his hands. He has clear cedar skin and a pert, wide mouth. His eyes are sedate and low-lidded when he&#39;s in a neutral mood, but they open wide when he tells a story or expresses an urgent (often dissenting) opinion. Stories sometimes incite him to stand up and pantomime crucial passages of action. His first dream, before writing, was to act.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;When the third coffee came, finally correct, he sat on a couch by a window and lit a cigarette. Lots of people he knew were smoking again, he said, despite the worldwide march of a deadly respiratory disease: “Our lungs could fail us at any moment, and we&#39;re just, like, you know, fuck it.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Coffee and an American Spirit, white light through the window—his instinct about waking with the sun had been borne out. The apartment was pleasant in the daytime. On one wall was a large abstract painting in russets and burgundies and bright lipstick shades. Upstairs was a bedroom that he shared with his newish boyfriend, Arvand Khosravi, a film and television executive. At the top of the staircase was a glass door leading out to a shallow ledge on the roof, where Harris often went to film TikTok videos—mostly poppy, fast-paced riffs on scenes from classic plays—which he had been posting almost daily. In one, titled “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://twitter.com/jeremyoharris/status/1246604978346754049&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://twitter.com/jeremyoharris/status/1246604978346754049&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jeremyoharris/status/1246604978346754049&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;Titus Andronicus Act V&lt;/a>;,” he lip-synchs dialogue from the TV show “Catfish,” in four different costumes; it&#39;s nine seconds long.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Harris did the TikToks for fun; they were, for weeks, his sole avenue of creative expression. But they were also, not so subtly, a dig at the profession through which he had gained his recent fame. Rooted in the history and the canonical repertoire of theatre, but yoked dramaturgically to hyper-current rhythms and attitudes and styles, the TikToks showed that Harris could do what the big arts institutions couldn&#39;t—keep up. While they floundered, he figured, the show would go on from his phone. He had changed the bio on his frequently updated Twitter account to a kind of epitaph for the theatre: “I spent my 20s devoted to a craft in a coma.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Stages everywhere were dark; theatre companies and nonprofits were scrambling. In both their public statements and their private conversations with playwrights, they projected blithe optimism, as though their operations would be up and running by summer&#39;s end.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Like, no, guys!” Harris said, describing his frustration. “We have to reinvent this or re-create this, or else it&#39;s going to be even more detrimental to artists in six months, when you guys have wasted your resources trying to go the normal way.” “Daddy” was still in British limbo, and he had another play, “A Boy&#39;s Company Presents: &#39;Tell Me If I&#39;m Hurting You&#39; ”—his version of a Jacobean revenge drama, based on a particularly bad breakup—scheduled to début in May, at Playwrights Horizons, in New York. Nobody would officially admit—or, perhaps, allow themselves to believe—that the upcoming seasons wouldn&#39;t happen, but Harris was already mourning the new play, just as he was mourning “Daddy.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;His ire notwithstanding, thinking and talking about the failures of his industry seemed to energize him—almost to soothe him—and his online complaints soon came to echo a wider mood. As the initial shock of the pandemic gave way to a reëvaluation of racial and other societal arrangements, Harris became a kind of spokesman for the long-standing and suddenly stark unrest felt by his fellow-artists. It was a moment well suited to Harris&#39;s natural, if somewhat paradoxical, penchant for institutional critique. A happy disrupter of genteel silences, he has nonetheless, however rockily, charted a professional and personal path through some of the entertainment world&#39;s most staid establishment outposts: the Yale School of Drama; Gucci, for which he does modelling; various Hollywood-adjacent neighborhoods in Los Angeles; and now, most visibly, the Great White Way. The previous fall, “Slave Play,” the first of Harris&#39;s works to be staged in New York, had transferred to the Golden Theatre, on Broadway, after an extended run at the venerable New York Theatre Workshop, downtown.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Slave Play” tells the story of three interracial couples undergoing “antebellum sexual-performance therapy,” in order, presumably, to mend the edges of their relationships, which have been frayed by race. In the first act, before the audience is in on the premise, the couples—dressed in nineteenth-century garb, as masters and slaves—engage in various kinky sexual scenarios calibrated to set off trip wires in race- and sex-sensitive American minds. The second act, in which the actual therapy takes place, is straightforwardly funny. The third is a surreal, largely horrifying duet between one of the couples, a Black woman and her white husband. Over and over, “Slave Play” calls into question the true parameters of sexual consent and tries to wring current-day catharsis from the brutal history of master-slave rape.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;In some corners—including this magazine, in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/12/24/black-and-white-in-slave-play-and-to-kill-a-mockingbird&quot;>;review&lt;/a>; that I wrote—Harris was lauded for the wild rigor of his vision and the originality of his voice. And the play&#39;s overwhelming success was the precondition for many of the luxuries he now enjoyed: the London flat, the European engagement, a two-year development deal that he had recently signed with HBO. At the same time, “Slave Play” was a kind of troll job, perversely aimed at unsettling and possibly enraging the various constituencies—racial, sexual, institutional, professional—to which he belonged. Harris must have known that the play would have this effect; he seemed to revel in the discursive mess it left in its wake. Even before the pandemic, he had earned a reputation as an enfant terrible, the kind of designation that is made possible only by way of proximity. You&#39;ve got to be fairly close to the big house to even consider throwing stones.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Something I&#39;ve always wondered is when I&#39;m going to develop the affected-Black-intellectual voice,” Harris said that summer, still stuck in London. He was reflecting on some of his favorite writers and artists of an older generation, and the way that their talk was often as effortfully stylized as their work. He&#39;d been thinking about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1994/11/07/andre-leon-talley-vogue-the-only-one&quot;>;André Leon Talley&lt;/a>;, the fashion writer and editor whose high diction and baroque syntax became hallmarks of his style—and seemed, moreover, like a way of asserting his belonging in a largely white milieu. Talley, who died last year, was, like Harris, a tall, queer, highly verbal Black man from the South. His web of complex, sometimes tortured relationships with white co-workers, bosses, and benefactors was consonant with—and had possibly even influenced—the dynamics depicted in “Slave Play.” Harris is unabashed in his study of other artists&#39; personas. “I&#39;m so interested in personal style, and personal relationships, and class—if not class ascension, then class association,” he said. “Just the lilt of certain people.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Talk of that voice—I knew what Harris meant without having to ask—got me thinking, perhaps slightly defensively, of my own.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“You have it a little bit,” he said, confirming a fear I&#39;d spoken aloud.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;We agreed, though, that the voice of our rough age cohort—Harris is thirty-four—was particular. The sort of Black Millennial writer whom Harris had in mind was not someone who would deploy the suavely concatenated sentences of James Baldwin. Rather, this hypothetical thirtysomething, as eager to showcase pop-cultural with-it-ness and egalitarian humility as to display hard-won verbal acuity, would use locutions peppered with pointed “like”s and “um”s, plus a bit of vocal fry, for subtler tones of falsely self-deprecating color: a Valley Girl with an advanced degree.&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot;

” Harris said. “But also, partially, I think unconsciously, I did it so that my intellect wouldn&#39;t be intimidating to everyone around me. This is a part of my plays that was also a part of growing up—I&#39;ve always had to figure out how to translate stuff from the academy into language that my mom could understand, without asking her to take time from her life to read, like, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/10/26/how-saidiya-hartman-retells-the-history-of-black-life&quot;>;Saidiya Hartman&lt;/a>;.” A dramaturgical note for “Slave Play” quoted both Hartman and Hortense Spillers, another Black feminist scholar, but the play itself takes Rihanna as its primary muse. “I had to bring my learning into a different space of understanding, which is why it&#39;s so much more fun for me to write plays that are based in theory than it is for me to go, &#39;And then Jonathan wanted to get a divorce from Becca,&#39; or things like that.”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;dn7vnr&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Harris speaks in a restless tenor, alternating locomotive bursts with considered pauses; his voice is bright and brackish and warm. He talks about movies and plays and clothes and people&#39;s bodies constantly. His sentences often start with “Have you seen?” or “Have you read?” Unless he already knows, from your work—almost all his friends are artists or public people of one kind or another—that you&#39;ve seen it or read it, and what you think about it, and is prepared to gently argue. He says “yes,” encouragingly but without much emphasis, when he hears something he agrees with, never “yeah.” Two words he uses a lot are “ostensibly” and “psychotic.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Harris was raised in Martinsville, Virginia, among people who made their livings with their bodies, many of them in factories. His way with words marked him as different. His mother, Veronica Farrish, refused to let family members use baby talk with him. He taught himself to read, and was soon the kind of prematurely unimpressed kid who finds it easier to make friends with teachers than with classmates. When Harris was eight, one of his favorite pastimes, he said, was trading theories with his mother about what had happened to JonBenét Ramsey, the six-year-old pageant contestant whose murder was a tabloid bonanza in the late nineties: “I was, like, &#39;OK, I looked at this document.&#39; ”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;His early interest in true crime briefly convinced him that he wanted to be a lawyer—that standby aspiration for the precociously talkative. But after landing a part in his middle school&#39;s production of “My Fair Lady,” he realized that he possibly just wanted to play a lawyer on TV. Around the same time, Harris was realizing that he was gay, or at least different—this difference was the rare condition for which he didn&#39;t yet have the words. Another discomfort was the unsettled nature of his home life. He didn&#39;t meet his biological father until he was nine or ten; his mother married another man when Harris was four, got divorced when Harris was in middle school, then embarked on another short-lived marriage, to a military man stationed at what was then Fort Bragg, in North Carolina. Harris moved there with his mother and enrolled in a new school. “I was so upset,” he said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Harris spent much of his childhood in private Christian schools, helped by financial aid. As a result, he became comfortable with the discombobulating tension of being a poor Black kid in a largely rich, white environment. Then, in tenth grade, he got a scholarship to Carlisle, a prep school in Martinsville. In the hallways, there were pictures of each graduating class. As Harris recalls, Black faces didn&#39;t begin showing up in the photographs until the mid-nineties, when the school started a basketball team. “Everybody wanted me to play basketball,” Harris said. “And I was, like, No. I hated that so much. I was, like, I will &lt;em>;never&lt;/em>; do that.” Instead, he took up swimming and dance. He kept up his practice of befriending teachers. “Candace—and Paula, who taught in the middle school,” he recalled, “I would have coffee with them after school, and they were my friends.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;By this point, Harris was determined to be an actor. He got parts in plays and musicals and directed a production of “The Laramie Project,” Moisés Kaufman&#39;s documentary play about the aftermath of the killing of Matthew Shepard, a gay student at the University of Wyoming. His kaffeeklatsch pal Candace Owen-Williams, who taught drama at Carlisle, let him turn an empty trailer behind the school into a black-box theatre, where he and some other friends put on experimental shows. His senior thesis was a one-man production of Wallace Shawn&#39;s “The Fever.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;For college, Harris went to the acting conservatory at DePaul University, in Chicago. The program&#39;s structure was brutal: after freshman year, only half of the students were allowed to continue with the acting cohort; the others were cut, and had to pursue different fields of study if they wished to remain at the school. Harris found the first year—essentially a protracted audition—disorienting. “A lot of my teachers said that my intellect was going to get in the way of me being a real actor,” he said. “I always sort of directed or rewrote the circumstances of the scene to fit the emotional states that I wanted to play around in, to make it more interesting to me.” Part of the problem, he said, was that so many of the roles and scenes were geared toward white actors. But he internalized the message that “if you&#39;re smart, you have to hide it,” he said. “I still stand by all my choices,” he added, “because, in some ways, I made cooler theatre then than I&#39;m making now.” For an exercise in “auto-drama,” he put twenty lamps of different shapes and sizes onstage. The lamps were the only source of light in the show; each one represented a story connected to a father figure. Then, as now, Harris was seeking, and sometimes finding, masked ways to describe the absence left by his actual father. In the glow of each light, he told a version of a memory.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;After the first semester, Harris chopped his long hair, nervous about how his teachers might perceive him. When the program made its cuts, the following summer, he called his friend and classmate Erika J. Simpson. Neither had got in. They were quiet for a long time.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;alua1&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;It was June—a beautiful month in Chicago but, for Harris, who had just turned nineteen, the grim beginning of an uncertain period. He called one of his teachers to ask why he&#39;d been dismissed; she said that he wouldn&#39;t be “castable” as an actor until his thirties, and rattled off a list of reasons that felt, to him, like “gay-coded shit.” He told me, “There were four Black boys in our year, and the two that got cut were the ones that felt the femme-est.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;He started collecting issues of the Chicago &lt;em>;Reader&lt;/em>;, a free alternative newspaper whose pages he trawled for acting notices. At an audition, he broke down, crying and trembling. He explained himself to the producers—some of them had gone to DePaul; they understood—and they told him that he could step out of the room for a moment, compose himself, and try again. Instead, he just left.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Eventually, Harris got modest parts at small venues in the city. He became an English major, and briefly imagined writing poems. He was interested in the work of Ai, a mixed-race woman from Arizona whose poor upbringing reminded Harris of his own. In her poems, Ai, who died in 2010, inhabited the voices of tough, sly, vulnerable working-class people asserting their dignity—or, at least, some measure of hip and artful defiance—against the backdrop of an indifferent and often hostile world. “You say you want this story / in my own words, / but you won&#39;t tell it my way,” her poem “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/browse?volume=151&amp;amp;issue=1&amp;amp;page=14&quot;>;Interview with a Policeman&lt;/a>;,” from 1987, begins. Her work would come to influence Harris&#39;s understanding of the possibilities of monologue.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;But Harris didn&#39;t remain an English major, or a DePaul student, for long. He dropped out and, a year later, moved to Los Angeles.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;By the end of the first pandemic summer, Harris and Khosravi had left the London apartment and were driving around Europe in a car full of their stuff. Khosravi had felt too cooped up in their flat, but Harris refused to move back to the US “This is why it&#39;s hell to date me,” he said. The pair were in Naples, Italy, in mid-October, when Tony nominations were announced, on a live stream. It was evening in Italy; Harris got on FaceTime with his mom, nieces, and nephew, so that he could watch it with them. He had to hop off about four nominations in because the stream that his mom was watching was ahead of his, and she kept screaming before he&#39;d seen the news. In the end, “Slave Play” got twelve nominations, more than any non-musical production had before.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Slave Play” was a genuinely difficult piece of work, a deliberate provocation. At one post-show Q. &amp;amp; A., a white woman yelled at Harris that she didn&#39;t “want to hear that white people are the fucking problem all the time.” Some Black audience members insisted that the play was oriented toward a “white gaze,” and was a cynical exploitation of the intertwined subjects of slavery and rape. Both currents of backlash were more or less predictable. The dozen nominations seemed to indicate that Harris could start a food fight in the theatre world&#39;s living room and still be invited to sit at its dinner table.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“It emboldens me to be more forthright with my opinions and how I feel about the world, because, if I gave a fuck about what institutions were actually saying to me, the &#39;Slave Play&#39; that got twelve nominations would not be the &#39;Slave Play&#39; that got twelve nominations,” he said. “It would have been a dumber play, and a less complex play, and a less Jeremy play.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;But this institutional approbation also posed a kind of creative challenge. “I think the thing that I&#39;m trying to get over—and I&#39;ve been working on this a lot over the last year—is other people&#39;s excitement about me,” Harris said. “It&#39;s easier for me to write when I&#39;m writing from a place of, like, &#39;These people don&#39;t believe in me enough.&#39; When I have something to prove, I can write so much better.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Since his time in LA, if not before, Harris had defined himself in opposition to those around him—or, at least, those with power. He had initially made his way not in professional settings but in the more free-flowing dynamic of late-night scenes. In Chicago, he had begun to understand his personality and physical bearing as a kind of talent. He was funny and gay and six feet five; people gravitated toward him and wanted him to come to their parties. He got a job at a trendy women&#39;s boutique in Wicker Park, &lt;em >;AKIRA&lt;/em>;, where he helped clients find going-out outfits. Often, those clients would invite him to clubs. Soon, he was a night-life fixture.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“I am the No. 1 person who will tell you that I hate gay bars, because I don&#39;t have as much power there,” he told me. “Black and skinny and charismatic—it gives you much more power in a straight bar than in a gay bar. I wasn&#39;t threatening to the straight men there. And I was also a weird honeypot for the night clubs because all these fun girls would want to stick around longer to hang out, and buy more bottles, too.” Night life is a churning economy, only partially visible to most people, a system behind a veil.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;He carved out a similar space in LA, getting a day job where cool and connected people were sure to buy clothes—Barneys this time—and becoming a regular presence in the clubs. He made friends, some of them in show business, and asked around about how to find his way in the industry. Among the people he talked to at parties were important future collaborators: the writer and director Sam Levinson, the filmmaker Janicza Bravo. “I think that my verbal abilities helped me navigate the space,” he said. “And also my style. I have good-to-decent style.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Harris got small acting gigs: he starred in a short film directed by the actor James Franco; he appeared, very briefly, in the Terrence Malick movie “Song to Song.” But he hated the idea of being at the mercy of gatekeepers, who, like his teachers at DePaul, might label him uncastable. When Lena Dunham&#39;s show “Girls” débuted on HBO, in the spring of 2012, he saw her as a kindred spirit, and a role model. Watching “Girls,” he thought, “This is so perfect, and also I think I could do it.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Like Dunham—and like Ilana Glazer and Abbi Jacobson, of “Broad City,” another inspiration—Harris and Erika Simpson, his friend from DePaul, created a Web series, “#NightStrife,” and uploaded it to YouTube. “It&#39;s two twentysomethings trying to get famous,” Simpson says, by way of explanation, in the first episode. They made only a few episodes, which were not widely seen, though a tongue-in-cheek series promo of sorts, titled “Black Girl Takes a Shit,” has been watched nearly eighty thousand times.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Harris became jaded about Hollywood; he stopped acting, and stopped referring to himself as an actor. He started to call himself a playwright, though he had yet to write a play. He cast about for ideas, unsuccessfully, until he went on a date with a porn star, whose stories yielded the material for Harris&#39;s first play, “Xander Xyst, Dragon: 1,” a kind of fantasia on the theme of online celebrity. With the play—which featured music by Isabella Summers, of Florence and the Machine, another friend he&#39;d made in LA—he won a spot at the Samuel French Off-Off Broadway Short Play Festival, in 2014. There, he met a group of young playwrights who are now his contemporaries: Will Arbery, Martyna Majok, Leah Nanako Winkler, Eleanor Burgess.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Afterward, he applied for a fellowship at the MacDowell artists&#39; residency—and, when he was wait-listed, he called the administration every day until someone told him yes. At MacDowell, he met the playwright Amy Herzog, who encouraged him to apply to Yale. He&#39;d already finished a draft of “Daddy,” and he submitted it to the drama school&#39;s admissions board, along with a heartfelt essay. “The clearest memory I have of my childhood is elegantly staged,” he wrote. “Delicately, it moves in a realm between the cinematic and the theatrical: lights up on an open screen door leading into a wide hallway, my mother (early 30s) downstage paces from one off stage room to another whispering vitriol into a cordless phone, somewhere further off stage we can hear the sounds of a young girl crying, and upstage in profile I sit (12) back to back with a large suitcase looking out of the open door periodically. 。 。 。 Suddenly the crying stops replaced by The Pointer Sisters and my mother is standing with my sister in her arms in the middle of the hall tears, a smile and snot dancing on her face, &#39;He&#39;s not coming. Come on baby, let&#39;s dance,&#39; she said. So we did.”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;6a1t4b&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Harris has come to see “Daddy” as a play about furthering his career by seeking the opportunity and resources that an institution like Yale can provide. “Going to Yale was me deciding to marry a white guy on a hill and in order to have the time and space to make my work,” he &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.ssense.com/en-us/editorial/culture/oh-jeremy&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.ssense.com/en-us/editorial/culture/oh-jeremy&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.ssense.com/en-us/editorial/culture/oh-jeremy&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;told&lt;/a>; one interviewer. Elsewhere, he has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vice.com/en/article/8qgm9g/decolonizing-my-desire&quot;>;described&lt;/a>; the play as an attempt “to parse the ways I was cradled, coddled and collected by white institutions and how I&#39;ve collected and used them in turn.” He once wrote that he went to Yale with eyes open, “believing that I could take more from this place than they would take from me.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In early 2021, the demands of Harris&#39;s still fairly young renown finally called him back to New York. &lt;em>;Town &amp;amp; Country&lt;/em>; had planned a multi-page spread to showcase his newly designed home office, which had been furnished by the chic design firm Green River Project. On a cold, pewter-sky morning in January, Harris sat in a studio belonging to Aaron Aujla, one of the firm&#39;s owners, at a nondescript former warehouse in Brooklyn, getting ready to have his picture taken. Someone tended to his hair, always a foremost point of interest in the looks he puts together for magazine covers and red carpets. There were small, feathery tufts of it strewn about the studio&#39;s bright-green floor.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“I think I want just a mustache,” Harris said. He&#39;d come to the shoot with several pictures of the Japanese writer Yukio Mishima at the ready on his phone. He pulled one up: Mishima in his office, behind a desk and flanked by books, pouting fiercely at the camera, his dark brows writhing. The writer&#39;s louche, vaguely sexual gaze did have something of the solitary mustache about it.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Harris has often, with a bit of a wink—and in spite of Mishima&#39;s reactionary politics—called Mishima his favorite writer. A few months earlier, he had tweeted, “Ok guys so to combat seasonal / pandemic depression and the sense that my life moves at a pace my body can&#39;t keep up with I&#39;ve decided to do a workout every day a la my favorite writer YUKIO MISHIMA. Who combatted depression and dread w/ workouts and a failed coup d&#39;état.” In 1970, Mishima and several members of a militia that he had formed attempted to take over a Japanese military base, in the hope of inspiring an overthrow of the country&#39;s constitution. After a fiery speech, Mishima—obsessed with physical beauty and warlike vigor—killed himself with a sword. “Do I hate fascists?” Harris wrote, in another tweet. “Yes. Do I love Mishima?是的。 I&#39;m a Gemini. Two truths can be held.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Aujla puttered in and out of the studio, smiling and not saying much. He is married to the fashion designer Emily Bode, known for her knit menswear; she and Aujla are neighbors of Harris&#39;s, in Chinatown, and have become his friends. She&#39;d brought a rack of clothes for Harris to choose from. Once in a while, he&#39;d disappear behind a curtain and come out wearing a pair of fluid trousers or a lacy top or a burgundy suit, evocative of Mishima. (He selected the suit as one of his outfits.) When something tickled him, he let his voice rise to a high, smoky giggle. “That&#39;s cunt,” he sometimes said. Between costume changes, he chatted about recent movies, especially a new coming-of-age indie film that everybody seemed to like but that he couldn&#39;t bring himself to watch.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;“Arvand hates me for this,” Harris said, referring to his Hollywood-exec boyfriend, “but I can&#39;t stand this kind of shit.” He went on, “It&#39;s always that same thing: &#39;Here I am, marginalized little kid—Black, immigrant, gay, whatever—and here&#39;s the &lt;em>;wide&lt;/em>;, &lt;em>;wide world&lt;/em>;.&#39; ” By now he was acting out the archetype, hunched into a pantomime of childish wonder, his eyes big with fear, his hands clasped. “And now there&#39;s big trouble”—he cowered in terror—“and inner strife”—he anxiously trembled—“but soon”—now he let a smile spread across his face—“I overcome.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“I knew exactly what that movie was gonna be the moment it started, and I was, like, No, thank you,” he said. Bode, who has a slim face framed by twin curtains of dark hair and speaks in a soft, helpful voice, like that of an expensive therapist, laughed until her face turned pink.&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;a data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a27607&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a27607&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;Jeremy O.

Like Harris, Leifheit went to Yale for graduate school and is the entrepreneurial, self-sustaining center of his own career. He edits the magazine &lt;em>;MATTE&lt;/em>;, makes photo books, and teaches workshops across the country. They met because of Harris&#39;s insistence, in New Haven, on spreading his presence far beyond the confines of the drama school: he was known to drop in on photography critique sessions and to speak up, offering references and suggestions. “A lot of people thought he was part of the photo program,” John Pilson, one of the program&#39;s longest-serving faculty members, said. “By the end, we all expected to see him every week.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Harris had arrived at Yale in 2016. Several of his classmates were far beyond him professionally: they&#39;d had shows produced, they had agents. He was eager to catch up, but soon found himself at odds with the institution. The curriculum was too conservative for his taste; he felt that his instructors were dismissive of his interest in more experimental work. He started taking classes in Black studies and poetry. He also began work on “Slave Play,” which he says “poured out” of him almost whole. He was assigned a faculty adviser, the acclaimed playwright and director &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/11/03/real-gone-girl&quot;>;Young Jean Lee&lt;/a>;, who would help shepherd a student production.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Lee is a longtime downtown experimentalist, and many of her work&#39;s subjects—race, class, the body—are also crucial to Harris; he was excited to work with her. But she had extensive notes on “Slave Play,” which Harris mostly declined to take. She objected strongly to the final act, set in the bedroom of a Black woman named Kaneisha and her white British husband, Jim. Their therapy has been a disaster, largely because of Jim&#39;s refusal to go along with goofily degrading role-play. Kaneisha calls Jim a “virus,” and connects their relationship to the brutalities of the past; Jim gets back into character, as a slave master, and gives Kaneisha the abasement she seems to have been asking for.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;This sequence, the most hotly debated part of “Slave Play,” stayed in the show, even after the move to Broadway. When Lee saw it in a dress rehearsal, she was horrified; later, she told Harris that it took her more than an hour to calm down enough to give him feedback. The two then exchanged lengthy text messages. “I hope that no one has ever spoken that violently to you about work that so deeply intersects with your being, and if they have I&#39;m sorry,” Harris wrote. Lee replied, “If you&#39;re that irresponsible about putting a rape of a female body onstage, I&#39;m going to call you out on it in no uncertain terms. To turn it around and call me the violent one is a classic move that has been done to me many times, and I&#39;ve never fallen for it, and I&#39;m not falling for it now.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Their dispute culminated in a formal complaint process, presided over by Tarell Alvin McCraney, who leads the drama school&#39;s playwriting program. Harris used transcripts from those meetings in “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.nplusonemag.com/issue-38/fiction-drama/yell-a-documentary-of-my-time-here/&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.nplusonemag.com/issue-38/fiction-drama/yell-a-documentary-of-my-time-here/&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nplusonemag.com/issue-38/fiction-drama/yell-a-documentary-of-my-time-here/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;Yell: A &#39;Documentary&#39; of My Time Here&lt;/a>;,” his senior thesis play. I went to see it, in New Haven, in 2019. By then, Harris had already staged “Slave Play” and “Daddy” Off Broadway, but he still had something to prove to his teachers. The most constant formal structure in “Yell” is repeated acts of onstage defecation. Fake shit was everywhere at Yale&#39;s Iseman Theatre that day.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;frvuov&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Harris has said that “Yell” was inspired by the radical 1967 essay “The Student as Nigger,” by Jerry Farber, which compares the relationship between American students and their professors to that of slaves and masters. In June, 2020, at the height of the George Floyd protests, Harris shared “Yell” online, and wrote a long accompanying Twitter &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://twitter.com/jeremyoharris/status/1270447515570233350&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://twitter.com/jeremyoharris/status/1270447515570233350&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jeremyoharris/status/1270447515570233350&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;thread&lt;/a>; in which he posted screenshots of his text exchange with Lee, who declined to comment for this story. “EVERY DAY THEY TREATED ME LIKE A NIGGA THAT NEEDED TO BE TAMED AND IT MADE ME FEEL CRAZY,” he wrote.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In September, 2021, Harris sat in a chair in a bathroom at a ritzy hotel in New York. The Tonys were finally being awarded that night, and he&#39;d booked a suite nearby, where he could get ready. Also in the bathroom were his hairdresser, Latisha Chong, and a woman tending to his makeup and nails. He sat stock-still, never wincing as Chong pulled through his Afro and started to braid. The three of them, mutually devoted to the task of flashy beauty, calmly chatted about people they knew in common.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Everybody who knows him thinks he&#39;s gay,” Harris said. “But, I&#39;m telling you, he&#39;s straight.” Both women disbelievingly harrumphed. “Bone straight,” he said.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;The bathroom was a center of calm in the otherwise hectic suite. Harris occasionally got up to take a Polaroid of the room—an editor at &lt;em>;Vogue&lt;/em>; had commissioned him to keep a photo diary. Also milling around were two camerapeople shooting footage for a “Slave Play” documentary that Harris had promised to deliver to HBO. They swanned around the room, sometimes going out on the balcony to capture views of downtown and the West Side. Beyond and between the buildings, you could see the Hudson quietly snaking along.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Harris&#39;s assistant kept running out of the room, collecting bouquets of flowers and other gifts that were arriving in a steady stream. Harris had recently interviewed the young gay rapper Lil Nas X for a &lt;em>;GQ&lt;/em>; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gq.com/story/lil-nas-x-musician-of-the-year-2021&quot;>;profile&lt;/a>;. “Montero—he&#39;s brilliant,” he said, using the rapper&#39;s given name. “The interview felt kind of like a first date.” He asked his assistant to put on a song from Lil Nas X&#39;s new album, a catchy single called “Industry Baby.” “This one is gonna be huge,” Harris said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Friends continually appeared, at his invitation. His mother and niece were getting their makeup done in a neighboring room. Candace Owen-Williams, his old teacher, was there, too, in a sparkly gown. Harris pointed her out to each new arrival and repeated the story of how she made him feel less alone at school.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;This is how Harris relaxes—sitting somewhere near the center of a crowd that he&#39;s convened. Antwaun Sargent, an art critic and a gallerist with Gagosian, walked over to the ledge where Harris&#39;s gold accessories, custom-made for him by the haute-couture house Schiaparelli, sat gleaming. There were chunky rings and cufflinks, a necklace with a pendant made from a cast of Harris&#39;s ear, a “Phantom of the Opera”-style mask modelled after a swooping section of his face.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;As the sun began to set and the light in the room darkened, Harris asked everyone to leave so that he could ready himself for the show. That night, in a surprise to prognosticators, “Slave Play” was completely shut out—twelve nominations, nothing to bring home. The next day, the online edition of Page Six carried the headline “Jeremy O. Harris celebrates Tony snubs with two afterparties.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Early last year, Harris tweeted a casual swipe at the state of television. “I write tv for people who have an intellect for theatre since tv is hollow,” he wrote. “Bc the funny thing is the reason so many filmmakers and theatre makers were asked to make television is bc the medium hit a wall. That&#39;s why almost all the best tv, of late, has been made by exciting practitioners of other forms.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Stung TV writers and irritated critics noted that Harris now made much of his living from television, and not always in its most rarefied corners. In 2021, he&#39;d done a cameo, as himself, on the reboot of “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2008/03/10/advanced-placement&quot;>;Gossip Girl&lt;/a>;.” (The script called for a play within the show, which Harris wrote; later, he got it commissioned by the Public Theatre.) Then he was cast, as a fashion designer, in the second season of “Emily in Paris,” Darren Starr&#39;s critically maligned Netflix series about an American influencer who gets a job in France. The show&#39;s producers told Harris that they were looking for someone reminiscent of a young André Leon Talley.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Sharper observers of Harris&#39;s commentary noticed that he was playing a familiar role. “I support Jeremy O Harris being snotty about TV,” the &lt;em>;Times&lt;/em>; critic Jason Zinoman wrote. “Playwrights used to be like this all the time. It&#39;s a glorious tradition.” The path from New York theatre to a career in Hollywood—where the money and the weather are better, and the audiences are bigger—has been traversed by writers for almost a century. And Harris seemed to be giving television a dose of his usual medicine: let me in and I&#39;ll give you a piece of my mind.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;But on his winding path to playwriting, Harris had made the kinds of friends you would make if you were aiming for the screen all along. When Harris was still at Yale, Sam Levinson made him a consultant for his notoriously lurid HBO teen drama “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/on-television/the-addictive-chills-and-thrills-of-euphoria&quot;>;Euphoria&lt;/a>;.” (Harris is now a producer on the series.) Janicza Bravo got Harris hired as the co-writer for her movie “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-front-row/zola-reviewed-a-twitter-thread-takes-an-ingenious-and-audacious-cinematic-form&quot;>;Zola&lt;/a>;,” adapted from a riotous series of tweets.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;His steadiest Hollywood employment came in the form of the HBO deal that he signed in 2020. The following year, the network announced that he would adapt the novel “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Vanishing-Half-Novel-Brit-Bennett/dp/0525536965&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Vanishing-Half-Novel-Brit-Bennett/dp/0525536965&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Vanishing-Half-Novel-Brit-Bennett/dp/0525536965&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;The Vanishing Half&lt;/a>;,” by Brit Bennett, along with the playwright Aziza Barnes, a friend of his. The novel tells the story of twin sisters whose fates diverge: one dissolves into the American mainstream, passing as white; the other anchors herself in Black community. Harris and Barnes assembled a writers&#39; room to produce a pilot and a “show bible,” outlining the plot of the first season. They led the writers on a research trip to New Orleans, where much of “The Vanishing Half” is set. As the weeks passed, Harris was often airborne, travelling to fashion gigs, conducting interviews for magazines. When he signed the HBO deal, he&#39;d insisted that his contract contain an annual fund for supporting theatre, and he&#39;d used some of that money to create a fellowship for emerging writers. He was always &lt;em>;working&lt;/em>;. He just wasn&#39;t always writing.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Then, the following June, the Daily Beast &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thedailybeast.com/jeremy-o-harris-let-go-from-hbos-the-vanishing-half&quot;>;reported&lt;/a>; that Harris and Barnes were no longer working on the show. The article cited two sources who claimed that Harris “was let go after having trouble meeting script deadlines.” HBO insisted that he had not been fired. There had simply been creative differences, which were “part of the normal development process.” Harris, HBO added, “is a valued collaborator, and we currently have other projects in development with him.” (He is no longer on an exclusive deal with HBO but continues to work with the network.)&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I visited Harris, at his apartment, a couple of weeks later. It was a bright July day, hot in the sun but buoyed by a breeze. He answered the door wearing a long green terry-cloth robe, with dark polish on his fingernails. His young nephew had been wanting to paint his nails and was getting grief about it in his Southern milieu, Harris said, so he had painted his in solidarity. “Sometimes I think people don&#39;t want him to be a &#39;punk&#39; like Uncle Jeremy,” he said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The Daily Beast hadn&#39;t reported any details about Harris&#39;s approach to the “Vanishing Half” adaptation, but I had heard, from several friends, about a proposed scene in which a lot of feces is flung around. It sounded preposterous but not entirely unlikely. Harris, in his work, likes to explain drastic external action by way of uncomfortable, abject, and often lewd interior depths. His characters earn their brief glories after trudging through lots of shame; his people get splattered.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Harris seemed surprised that I&#39;d heard about the scene in such detail, but was happy to discuss it. He loved Bennett&#39;s book, but wanted to interpret it freely, even radically, something TV writers don&#39;t do enough, he said. One addition he and the writers envisioned was a surrealistic quasi-dream sequence that would send a character&#39;s consciousness “skipping like a stone across the waters of time,” as Harris put it in the show bible. The character would witness a “depraved ritual” meant to cleanse a small town of its communal sins, and the dark bacchanal would include “blackface masks, buffoonery and flying mud and feces.” It would end with “infidelities, thefts and dark family secrets ushered from the shadows into the light.”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;fcy98w&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Harris was less annoyed by people gossiping about his work than by the suggestion, in the Daily Beast and elsewhere, that he wasn&#39;t a hard worker. “I&#39;m actually really insecure about that,” he said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;He was about to go abroad, and he wanted a new swimsuit for the summer trip; he&#39;d asked Emily Bode to design one for him. We walked to her small tailoring shop in Chinatown, where a board high up on a brownish wall announced the prices for alterations. Half-done garments hung on faceless mannequins.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;A tailor silently took Harris&#39;s measurements, then gave him the swimsuit that Bode had left for him to try on: a lime-green one-piece with thin tank-top straps and tight shorts. He had seemed sedate and almost tired in the apartment, but now his mood lifted. He retreated behind a curtain, then came out wearing the suit, hugging his thin body. It fit. He looked into a mirror and spread his arms. He was already smiling.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;One night last October, Harris went to the Brooklyn Academy of Music to see the renowned Belgian theatre director Ivo van Hove&#39;s adaptation of the novel “A Little Life,” by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/01/17/hanya-yanagiharas-audience-of-one&quot;>;Hanya Yanagihara&lt;/a>;. Harris is friendly with Yanagihara—he&#39;d spoken with her about acting in a possible TV adaptation of the book. He attended the play with an old roommate from his Yale days, Michael Breslin, who co-founded the theatre collective Fake Friends. Harris has co-produced two of the collective&#39;s shows: “Circle Jerk,” a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize for drama, and “This American Wife,” a harrowing parody of Bravo&#39;s “Real Housewives” franchise.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“A Little Life” centers on a group of friends in New York, one of whom, a saintly character named Jude, is repeatedly flayed by acts of unspeakable violence. Like “Slave Play,” the novel was dogged by accusations of sadism. After the show, Harris, who has cited the Marquis de Sade as a formative influence, chatted with his friends. They all agreed that some of the show&#39;s most excruciating scenes, which had provoked gasps in the audience, could have been, in keeping with the book, a bit more graphic.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Harris took a car home, stopping for a drink at a bar near his apartment. Writers—a species always overrunning those blocks, which have come to be called Dimes Square—spilled out of restaurants and sidewalk sheds. For a few minutes, cradling his drink, Harris argued amiably with a pop-music critic about the recently released movie “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-front-row/tar-reviewed-regressive-ideas-to-match-regressive-aesthetics&quot;>;Tár&lt;/a>;,” which Harris hated.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Back at his apartment, he ate and paced and talked—softly, because a friend, one in a rotating series of medium-term guests, was sleeping in the next room. Soon, Khosravi came home. Like Harris, he is tall and slender and demonstrative; subtle streaks of gray run through the ringlets of his hair. Unlike Harris, he seldom seems excited to argue. Before Khosravi, Harris had a boyfriend who broke up with him in part, Harris says, because of his sudden fame. “Arvand doesn&#39;t mind that I&#39;m a star,” he once told me.&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;a data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a24982&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a24982&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;“Take care out there today hon.

They were flying in the morning to a gala in Bentonville, Arkansas, at the Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art. Harris didn&#39;t seem stressed.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The next day, at the museum, as Harris wandered a room with paintings by Kehinde Wiley, Amy Sherald, and Kerry James Marshall, Khosravi surprised him by getting on one knee and proposing marriage. He&#39;d had a ring designed by a pair of jewellers who lived across the street from them in London and had become their friends. And he&#39;d asked the playwright &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/02/12/adrienne-kennedys-startling-body-of-work&quot;>;Adrienne Kennedy&lt;/a>;—a hero of Harris&#39;s, and now a frequent e-mail correspondent of his—to write a benediction, to be etched on the inside. It reads, “Happiness. Is. To me. Greatest Thing.” Harris said yes.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;A day later, he giddily recounted the proposal on Twitter, adding a pinch of social critique. “But someone, I guess I will?, needs to write about how cringe it is to be proposed to when you haven&#39;t been socialized to be waiting for it,” he wrote. “It&#39;s a really violent trap we set for both parties where you&#39;re asked to be in a play you know the script to and if you deviate from it 💔.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Harris&#39;s doomsaying in 2020—his sense that the gatekeepers were not doing enough to reimagine and thus preserve the world of theatre—has arguably been validated, in the worst way, in the three years since then. A wave of closures and layoffs has prompted a rash of op-eds about the future of the medium. Harris, as contrarian as ever, is not abandoning the theatre but, rather, becoming something of a gatekeeper himself: he has lately been, almost above all else, a facilitator of other people&#39;s work.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;He is currently the presiding playwright for the Yale Drama Series, a role that involves judging the program&#39;s annual prize. After he took the position, last year, he began conceiving a writers&#39; retreat for some of the prize&#39;s finalists—inspired, in part, by his experience at MacDowell. In March, he announced the inaugural Substratum fellows: four young playwrights who would spend a month at a medieval house, part of the hotel Monteverdi Tuscany, which, along with Gucci, would help cover the expenses.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;He was in Italy with the fellows when he got a text from the actress Rachel Brosnahan, who, along with Oscar Isaac, was starring in a revival of Lorraine Hansberry&#39;s 1964 play “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/03/13/sign-in-sidney-brusteins-window-theatre-review&quot;>;The Sign in Sidney Brustein&#39;s Window&lt;/a>;,” at &lt;em >;BAM&lt;/em>;. She hoped he&#39;d come see it. He said he was abroad, and asked if the play might be extended or transferred; she didn&#39;t think so. “I&#39;m going to get you to Broadway,” he replied. He phoned producer friends, and together they engineered a brief transfer to the James Earl Jones Theatre—another play set to open there had seen its financing collapse. The Hansberry revival wouldn&#39;t run long enough to turn a profit, but it would get a wider audience for a work by another of Harris&#39;s playwriting heroes. And the quick transfer suggested a different approach, perhaps, for Broadway: If space opens up, why not take a few chances?&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In August, Harris went to the Berkshires to spend two weeks acting in a movie directed by Pete Ohs, who edited the “Slave Play” documentary. Ohs makes largely improvised movies for twenty thousand dollars or less; the tiny budget meant that he could shoot without breaking the rules of the Writers Guild of America strike, which had begun in the spring and showed no signs of ending. The film was a country-house nightmare about contracting disease from deer ticks.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;The cast was staying at the house, which belonged to the actress Callie Hernandez, one of Ohs&#39;s collaborators. In the brightness of the afternoon, a wall of trees outside was variously green: dark pine, mild maple, vivid oak. Inside, James Cusati-Moyer, who was in “Slave Play”—his character, a gay man, refuses to describe himself as white—stood at the kitchen counter, mixing flaxseed, honey, psyllium husk, and cranberries in a steel bowl. He was making gluten-free bread, from a TikTok recipe. “You want a kind of cakey texture,” he said. “The woman in the video is incredibly annoying, but the bread is great.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The movie would begin shooting that night. Harris changed into a white linen caftan and went into town for groceries—he&#39;d volunteered to make dinner, for the second day in a row. He drives with a country boy&#39;s ease; he learned at fourteen, when his mother realized how impossible it would be for her to chauffeur him to all of his activities. He&#39;d already acclimated somewhat to the roads of the Berkshires and to the local lore. “Birthplace of WEB DuBois,” he said. “They can&#39;t shut up about it—he&#39;s, like, the only Black guy they know.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Loping through the aisles at the grocery store, he picked up ears of corn with stringy husks and a pack of what he called “white-people aluminum foil,” packaged in a recyclable-looking brown paper box. He&#39;d begun writing a novel about a Black writer beset by deadlines and grief. Harris was very close with his mother&#39;s parents, who have both died in the past few years—his grandfather, Golden, died two weeks before “Slave Play” débuted on Broadway. “Writing isn&#39;t fun,” he said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;At lunch, in a small bakery across the street from a general store, he told me that his cash flow was slowing down as a result of the strike. “The other day, my niece asked me for a new phone, and I had to say no,” he said. “I told her, &#39;I&#39;m not trying to be mean—I&#39;m broke.&#39; ” He pays private-school tuition for her and his nephew; he bought a home, in Virginia, for his mom. He was worried about falling behind on payments.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;tls7&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Back at the house, he enlisted his castmates as sous-chefs—chopping herbs, buttering corn—and began to cook. People were trying on clothes and critiquing the outfits. Would this work for the character? What else did it need? Cusati-Moyer was in a loose crop top. Harris loved it.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“I feel bloated from the bread,” Cusati-Moyer said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“You are,” Harris said, grinning.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“This is what he was like,” Cusati-Moyer told the others. “He builds you up and then he breaks you back down!”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Harris called his mom to ask her advice on the meal—pork chops, roasted corn, fried apples, all callbacks to his childhood. Should he melt the butter, put the apples in the cast iron, and &lt;em>;then&lt;/em>; pour the sugar in?&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“I don&#39;t know if you know this,” he told her, “but there&#39;s a white way to make this, where you don&#39;t just pour sugar.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Yeah, well, we make it the Black way,” his mom said. They talked about Harris&#39;s niece, and about the patterns his mom had begun to notice in her romantic life, and about literature. They sounded like siblings who take turns being in control.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;She said that she wanted to write a book about her life. “The best way to write is to read really good things,” Harris said. “You have to read this book by a French woman named &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/11/21/annie-ernaux-turns-memory-into-art&quot;>;Annie Ernaux&lt;/a>;. &#39;Happening.&#39; You&#39;ll really like it.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;He sat in the kitchen, with food in the oven and on the stove, steeling himself quietly for work later on, chatting with his mother. For a moment, his life seemed almost normal. ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot;
