data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;现在是 10 月 27 日星期五下午 6:20&lt;em>;&lt;/em>;。我的孩子们正在我们避难的贾巴利亚难民营的房子里玩耍。 “我饿了，”我的妻子马拉姆低声对我说。 “我们吃点零食吧。”我们偷偷溜进隔壁房间，坐在楼梯上，这样我们的孩子就不太可能看到我们。我们怀念这些私密的时刻，那时我们可以一起度过时光，开玩笑。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;外面，黑暗的天空中闪烁着红光，就像闪电；随之而来的不是下雨，而是瓦砾，撞击着我们周围房屋的屋顶。马拉姆停止进食。当我站起来向外看时，气压将我推了回来。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;我走到父亲身边，他焦急地把收音机举到耳边。 “半岛电视台说他们与加沙的记者失去了联系，”他说。 “没有信号。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;我从口袋里拿出手机。自三周前升级以来，这是第一次没有互联网，而且我的 &lt;em>;SIM&lt;/em>; 卡都没有任何服务。我的姐姐阿雅有五个孩子，她要求我们在看到炸弹落下时警告她，这样她就可以在爆炸到达我们之前捂住耳朵。 “我的耳朵很痛，”她说。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;我记得我的 iPhone 有一个紧急求救功能，可以在没有信号时使用。但是，当我拉起它时，它告诉我，“您所在的地区不支持卫星连接演示。”我发现了另一种称为碰撞检测的选项——“如果你遭遇车祸，iPhone 可以自动呼叫紧急服务。”我认为苹果应该创建一个名为炸弹检测的功能，但能够帮助我们的人并不住在加沙。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;更多的炸弹正在落下。我的侄子和侄女试图在房子摇晃之前警告他们的阿雅阿姨。这是一个漫长的夜晚。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;第二天早上，我问坐在她睡觉的床垫上的母亲，我的父亲在哪里。她告诉我，他骑自行车回到加沙北部的拜特拉希亚，为我们收集一些橄榄油、橄榄和糖。我以前也经历过同样的旅程。 10 月 12 日我访问后，为了买一些面包，我为这本杂志撰写了关于 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-weekend-essay/the-view-from-my-window -in-gaza&quot;>;我担心我们的天花板会在空袭期间塌陷&lt;/a>;。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;我妈妈不喜欢我们回家。在她的一次梦中，我们的房子被毁了，她正在收集瓦砾。但我父亲不能不回去，因为他必须喂鸟和兔子。&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;“我是我要让他帮我的电动剃须刀拿充电器。”我说。当我给儿子剃头发时，电池没电了。我试着给父亲发短信，但后来我想起没有信号或互联网。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;我喝早茶。我母亲朗读《古兰经》。我的两个姐妹给孩子们梳头发。马拉姆在厨房里给水瓶装水。我尽量让大家保持安静，以免吵醒还在睡觉的人。&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;8点30分左右&lt;em>;AM&lt;/em>;，我的弟弟，哈姆扎和他妻子的家人住在该地区，他走进来。他眼镜后面的眼睛看起来很关切。 “父亲在哪儿？”他问道。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“他刚刚骑着自行车回到我们家。”我告诉他。&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;“我一小时前去了，”哈姆扎告诉我们。他用手告诉我们房子已经没了。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;从哈姆扎拍摄的照片中，我可以看到一楼的一部分，我父母住的地方。没有任何迹象表明这所房子有四层。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;我去找我的母亲和兄弟姐妹。我用我能控制的最安静的声音告诉他们我们的房子被毁的情况。不知怎的，妈妈很平静。 “感谢上帝，我们没有人受伤，”她说。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;我的姐夫艾哈迈德建议我们骑自行车去找我的父亲。仅仅三百米后，我们就看到了他，他在踩踏板时低着头。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;我父亲后来告诉我，通往我们家的街道上每一寸都被碎片覆盖。他没有喂养他的十五只鸭子、三十只母鸡、五只兔子和六只鸽子。 “也许有些还活着，被困在废墟下，”他说。但是，当他看到被炸毁的房子并听到无人机可怕的呼呼声后，他返回了营地。&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;当我们回到“家”时，我们都坐在地板上。直到后来我才开始意识到：我不仅失去了房子和房间，还失去了我的新衣服、鞋子和手表。我的书也是如此。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;我记得我建立个人图书馆的速度有多慢，以及朋友们花了多长时间将书籍邮寄到加沙。 2021年2月我从美国回来时，我在家人的行李箱里塞了一百二十本书；我不得不扔掉一些鞋子和衣服来腾出空间。 2023年5月我回来时，我多带了一个行李箱，里面装了大约七十本书。有些是由朋友签名的——&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/01/31/brown-furniture&quot;>;Katha Pollitt&lt;/a>;、&lt;a href=&quot;https:// www.newyorker.com/contributors/stephen-greenblatt&quot;>;斯蒂芬·格林布拉特&lt;/a>;、理查德·霍夫曼、阿米尔·阿尔卡拉、&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/09/11/the -自杀博物馆-ariel-dorfman-book-review&quot;>;乔纳森·迪伊&lt;/a>;。机场工作人员以为我的护照已过期，因为他从左到右倒着读。在从开罗出发的路上，我在提着沉重的行李箱时扭伤了肩膀。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;不到两个月前，我在费城参加一个文学节，并计划去旧金山。但我预感加沙局势岌岌可危，我决定缩短行程。在我飞回家之前，我让我的朋友哈桑从锡拉丘兹开车过来，这样他就可以给我我留给他的三十五本书。其中包括五卷“&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Greenwood-Encyclopedia-American-Poetry-volumes/dp/031332381X&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot ;element”:“ExternalLink”,“outgoingURL”:“https://www.amazon.com/Greenwood-Encyclopedia-American-Poetry-volumes/dp/031332381X”}&quot; href=&quot;https://www .amazon.com/Greenwood-Encyclopedia-American-Poetry-volumes/dp/031332381X&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;美国诗人和诗歌格林伍德百科全书&lt;/a>;。”&lt;/p>;&lt;因为很难相信我们失去了什么，所以我决定回到拜特拉希亚的家，亲眼看看发生了什么。当我接近我家的失事区域时，我惊慌失措地停下来——不仅因为现场，还因为无人机、喷气式飞机以及落在附近社区的炸弹的声音。&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/p>; div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;fby0k&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;我希望至少能找到一本我自己的诗集，也许在我邻居的橄榄树附近，但除了碎片什么也没有。除了爆炸的气味之外什么也没有。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;现在我坐在贾巴利亚营地的临时房子里，等待停火。我感觉自己就像在笼子里一样。我每天都和我的人民一起被杀。我唯一能做的两件事就是恐慌和呼吸。这里没有希望。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;我计划回到废墟中寻找我的书，并尽我所能营救。这次我不会把它们放在书架上。我只是想确保页面完好无损。我的兄弟哈姆扎也会对他花了十年时间收集的阿拉伯语语法和文学书籍做同样的事情。我们俩都祈祷未来的日子里不要下雨，把书页浸湿。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;10月31日，我们在家时，三声大爆炸震撼了我们。窗户坏了。瓦砾和灰尘飞进客厅。我们都冲进两间卧室，看着天花板。一枚炸弹落在七十米外。它摧毁了整个社区。&lt;/​​p>;&lt;p>;后来，以色列国防军发言人出现在 CNN 上，表示对贾巴利亚的袭击是针对哈马斯领导人的。当主播问起以色列国防军杀害平民的情况时，发言人说：“这是战争的悲剧。”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div >;&lt;p>;第二天，当我在手机上输入这篇文章的一部分时，我感到另一次爆炸就在附近。我冲了大约两百米到达现场，距离联合国办的学校不远。我看到受伤的妇女和儿童的脸部和胸部流血。一场大火正在燃烧。我找到一家药店，检查身体是否受伤，并尝试帮助周围的人。我们又活了下来。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;最近，我妻子梦见她正在收集冻肉。在梦中，她说：“这是我儿子的手臂。这是我女儿的腿。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;如果不是因为战争，我每周都会和朋友们踢两次足球。我会和我的妻子一起看电影。我会阅读书架上的书。我会带我的孩子去游乐场和海滩。我会和我的儿子 Yazzan 在海滩路上骑自行车。但现在没有书，没有书架，也没有海滩路。 ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;

data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;1926 年，弗吉尼亚·伍尔夫 (Virginia Woolf) 写了一篇关于一种天真的年轻艺术形式：无声电影的文章。伍尔夫认为这些电影太文学化了。他们必须找到自己的艺术语言，因为他们目前被囚禁在死气沉沉的惯例和机械信号量的系统中：“亲吻就是爱。杯子破碎是嫉妒。微笑就是幸福。死亡是一辆灵车。”偶尔，她会发现自己身处黑暗的电影院，对电影可能取得的成就感到担忧。 “透过那层厚厚的被子，巨大的灵巧和巨大的效率，人们可以瞥见内在的一些重要的东西，”她写道。 “但生活的乐趣会被更敏捷、更高的效率所掩盖。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;同年，英国作家毛姆出版了《木麻黄树》，这是一本由六篇短篇小说组成的书。毛姆正处于他成功的顶峰，他是一位伟大的、获得巨大成就的作家，他的技巧极其娴熟，效率极高。正如毛姆的传记作者塞琳娜·黑斯廷斯 (Selina Hastings) 所写，“在他漫长一生的大部分时间里”（毛姆于 1965 年去世，享年 91 岁）是“世界上最著名的作家”。他拥有如今演员、音乐家和犯罪政客所享有的名气。无论他走到哪里，他的足迹都被读者和记者追踪。他最轻微的声明就让一千份省级报纸的专栏变得丰富起来。到 1926 年，他作为小说家和剧作家开启了两项非常成功的职业生涯（他的戏剧集共六卷）。一年后，也就是他在费拉角买下一座别墅的那一年，《木麻黄树》中的故事之一《信》被改编成剧院。它在伦敦和百老汇演出；两部改编电影分别于 1929 年和 1940 年上映，后者由贝蒂·戴维斯 (Bette Davis) 主演。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;毛姆的世界声誉可能只有在二十世纪二十年代到五十年代之间才存在。文学声望仍然是文化的核心。渴望文学叙事的观众与渴望电影叙事的观众重叠，而英语是这两种大众艺术形式的幸运通用语言。大英帝国可能正在消退，但毛姆和他的朋友温斯顿·丘吉尔一样，在世界各地行走，仿佛太阳几乎没有落下它的罪恶。在二三十年代，作家前往印度、缅甸、西印度群岛、新加坡和马来西亚进行了广为人知的旅行。毛姆的“故事”是一个精心加工的艺术品——敏锐的心理、冷静的讽刺、轻微的颠覆性，还有点性感。疟疾肆虐的英国殖民地为潮湿、色情暗流提供了极好的条件。 《这封信》以新加坡为背景，根据真实的刑事审判改编，讲述了一位富裕的英国种植园主的妻子莱斯利·克罗斯比的故事，她被指控谋杀了邻居杰弗里·哈蒙德。这似乎是一个简单的案件：险些避免了强奸。晚上，杰弗里去看望了她，当时她丈夫不在。他对他进行了性挑逗，她出于自卫开枪射杀了他。莱斯利的律师认为他的当事人将被无罪释放。毛姆的故事始于一封充满激情的信，一封情人的信，莱斯利在信中似乎恳求杰弗里当晚去看她。那么，谋杀是一种必要的自卫行为，还是一种可以避免的激情犯罪？杰弗里是来攻击莱斯利的，还是要终止这段恋情的？ “这封信”冲向其叙事诱饵。&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;GenericCallout&quot;>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;external-link-embed--inline&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;a aria-label= “&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;本周我们读过的最好的书&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;” data-event-click=&quot;{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/best-books-2023&quot;}&quot;

G. 沃德豪斯 (P. G. Wodehouse) 的一个宝贵见解是，用这种自动的现实主义填充物可以创作出狂野的喜剧诗歌。如果一个角色可以“像伏尔加河船夫那样缓慢而拖沓地迈进”，为什么要让她直接走进一个房间（和一个故事）呢？如果你可以用“她看起来像一个刚刚咬了坏牡蛎的阿姨”来让你的读者发笑，为什么还要有人像母狮一样咆哮呢？伍德豪斯是一位本能的反现实主义无政府主义者，他不仅比毛姆更具实验性，而且始终是更精确的造型师。&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/ div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;你可以将陈端英的新小说《门之屋》（布卢姆斯伯里出版社）称为一种书目小说：它提供了，其他独特的乐趣，想象中描述了毛姆如何写下《这封信》，并通过将小说假设与现有的传记记录相结合来实现这一点。恩格的小说主要以马来西亚槟城州为背景，兼顾了两个中心叙述，一个来自 1910 年，另一个来自 1921 年。萨默塞特·毛姆于 1921 年访问了马来西亚，他非常喜欢这里，因此在那里待了六个月——探索故事，享受钦佩。以及英国殖民东道主的热情好客，并与他的秘书兼情人杰拉尔德·哈克斯顿一起自由度假。 （毛姆在伦敦有妻子和孩子。他有充分的实际理由对公开自己的双性恋持谨慎态度。）在恩格的小说版本中，毛姆足够出名，甚至其中一个仆人也读过他的作品。&lt;/p>; &lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt; div data-node-id=&quot;ecjh4&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/ div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div 数据节点-id=&quot;gkjzzc&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>; &lt;div >;&lt;p >;当时的马来亚处于英国的行政统治之下，《门之屋》以毛姆在《木麻黄树》中所描绘的殖民世界为背景——汗流浃背的晚宴，当地美食和令人怀念的糟糕的英国食物，舒适的种族偏见，孤立的殖民八卦。毛姆的主人是罗伯特·哈姆林 (Robert Hamlyn) 和莱斯利·哈姆林 (Lesley Hamlyn)（恩格借用了《木麻黄树》中角色的名字）。罗伯特是一名律师，是毛姆年轻时在伦敦的老朋友。恩格以毛姆的视角（第三人称）和莱斯利·哈姆林的视角（第一人称）交替章节，优雅地展现了一个复杂的社会场景。毛姆（他的朋友们称他为威利）和哈克斯顿一起抵达。莱斯利并没有立即意识到这两个男人是恋人，而且这种揭露并不受欢迎。 （“为什么我没有早点看到它？……我们屋檐下有一对该死的同性恋者。我看了罗伯特一眼——他知道；他当然知道。”）莱斯利最初觉得毛姆有点粗俗。她对作家冷酷审视的目光感到不安，本能地站在毛姆被遗弃的妻子一边，反对在她家里安逸居住的两个自由自在的绅士。莱斯利有理由感到被忽视：她过着殖民地妻子的失业状态；罗伯特比他大十八岁，长期身体不适。婚姻已经凝结成尊重的无爱。与此同时，毛姆收到一封信，通知他已经失去了所有的钱。他投资四万英镑的纽约经纪公司已经倒闭。受到损失的刺激，他开始寻找有前途的新故事，他将注意力转向莱斯利，莱斯利小心翼翼地对她的著名客人表示热情，而且她确实有故事可讲，其中三个故事占据了恩格小说的第二部分。&lt;/p>;&lt;向毛姆讲述的莱斯利的故事将我们带回到 1910 年，当时她第一次读到报纸报道她的朋友埃塞尔·普劳德洛克因谋杀而被捕。晚上，邻居威廉·斯图尔特 (William Steward) 拜访了埃塞尔的平房，当时她的丈夫外出了。他袭击了她，她出于自卫开枪射杀了他。埃塞尔·普劳德洛克并不是恩格的虚构人物。普劳德洛克于 1911 年在吉隆坡进行的审判在马来亚侨民群体中引起了轰动，部分原因是她人脉广泛，主要是因为与自满的殖民假设相反，她没有被无罪释放，而是被判处死刑。莱斯利向毛姆讲述了审判的情况（她被传唤为辩方证人）以及她在监狱里探望埃塞尔的情况。审判及其后果被巧妙地叙述；长篇情节是恩格小说中最引人注目的部分，它遵循了历史记录的大致轮廓。恩格的虚构转折涉及埃塞尔向莱斯利承认她与威廉·斯图尔特有染。她已经断绝了关系，而他却拒绝接受；当他盛怒地拜访她时，她出于自卫开枪射杀了他。 “门之屋”的埃塞尔没有公开承认自己通奸，而是默默接受了自己的判断，并被判处绞刑。据我们所知，真正的埃塞尔·普劳德洛克并没有私下承认这一点，而且她与威廉·斯图尔特的关系仍然模棱两可。 （在《信》中，毛姆虚构的补充就是这封信本身。这部小说让我们能够考察审判的实际事件，该事件被恩格轻微地虚构，而毛姆则被更严重地改造了，而毛姆反过来又被毛姆所小说化。 Eng.)&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Eng将普劳德洛克审判从1911年移至1910年，以便他可以将这个叙述与莱斯利的另一段回忆——她与孙中山先生的重要相遇——一起叙述。 1911 年底，孙当选为中华民国第一任临时大总统。1910 年，孙访问哈姆林时，他是一名流动革命者，本质上是在热情好客的当地民众中为自己的事业筹款。包括印度人、马来人和华人。 1972 年出生于槟城、拥有海峡华人血统的英再次巧妙地将历史记录与各种虚构编织起来。真正的太阳确实在 1910 年访问过槟城；同年11月的槟榔屿会议，承诺将成为孙中山的芬兰站时刻，启动推翻清朝的行动。恩格的小说增加了莱斯利，这对于英国白人殖民者来说是不同寻常的，她对孙和他的政治运动产生了强烈的兴趣。最初，毛姆认为莱斯利一定与这位迷人的中国激进分子有染。随着时间的推移，他从她那里得知，她不是与孙有染，而是与他当地的一位政治盟友，一位她称之为亚瑟的中国医生有染。这两个恋人定期在镇上的一所房子里约会，这所房子最初是亚瑟的祖母从中国飞往槟城后购买的。这给恩格的小说起了一个标题：墙上挂着木门，画着鸟语花香，或者是云雾缭绕的山峦。有些门的上半部装饰着复杂的龙凤纹饰。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“门之屋”是一个组合体，一座充满好奇心的房子。 Eng can write with lyrical generosity and beautiful tact: moths are seen at night “flaking around the lamps”; elsewhere, also at nighttime, “a weak spill of light drew me to the sitting room.” Shadowy emotions are delicately figured: “His eyes, so blue and penetrating, were dusked by some emotion I could not decipher.” Lesley&#39;s account of her affair with Arthur has a lovely, drifting, dreamlike quality—the adulterers almost afloat on their new passion, watched over by the hanging painted doors of Arthur&#39;s house on Armenian Street. In these and other scenes, Eng demonstrates the control and the exquisite reticence that made his previous novel, “The Garden of Evening Mists,” a sharply magical collocation. But in this novel these moments seem to occur only when Eng provokes himself to some special point of intensity and concentration. They sit alongside plenty of slack and formulaic gesturing. History and geography arrive in large flat patches—say, the political context of Sun&#39;s radicalism, or Malaysia&#39;s special diversity. Early on, for instance, when Maugham tells Lesley&#39;s cook that the dinner is the best meal he has eaten “in the East,” Lesley conveniently replies, “You won&#39;t find anything like it anywhere in the world. 。 。 。 Over the centuries Penang has absorbed elements from the Malays and the Indians, the Chinese and the Siamese, the Europeans, and produced something that&#39;s uniquely its own. You&#39;ll find it in the language, the architecture, the food.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In the same vein, Eng&#39;s narrative can take on a tone of blandly fictionalized biography. When Eng dabs in a little backstory around Maugham&#39;s unhappy marriage to Syrie Wellcome, the writing dozes off: “Their rows grew more frequent and stormy. After another quarrel, he told himself that the situation could not go on.” Maugham recalls returning to London from one of his long trips: “ &#39;You missed Liza&#39;s birthday,&#39; Syrie reminded him barely half an hour after he had stepped inside 2 Wyndham Place, his four-storey Regency house in Marylebone.” This passage occurs in one of the chapters seen from Maugham&#39;s point of view; the writing is thus offering a kind of free indirect style. (It&#39;s headed “Willie, Penang, 1921.”) It is unclear why Willie Maugham would have to remind himself that he lives in a four-floor Regency house in Marylebone. This kind of biographical positivism—Eng stays close to the historical facts—has the effect of forestalling the most fertile element of the novel, its manner of layering the narratives. (We have the “real” Maugham, the “real” Proudlock trial, and then the lightly fictionalized versions of both offered by Eng, and the more heavily fictionalized version of the trial offered by Maugham.) The potential for a vertiginous examination of the instabilities and deceits of storytelling collapses too easily into novelized biography. The novel sends one back to the source texts.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Would Maugham have any reasonable objection to Eng&#39;s fictional portrait? Certainly, he&#39;d be quite at home in Eng&#39;s spacious suite of cliché. Here is Lesley at a colonial party at the Eastern &amp;amp; Oriental Hotel: “I nursed my glass of wine and eyed the women around me. 。 。 。 I groaned inwardly when I saw Mrs Biggs, the wife of the director of the Rickshaw Department, making a beeline for me. In a booming voice that could be heard over on the mainland, she asked me if it was true that Ethel Proudlock had been having an affair with William Steward.” Woolf&#39;s cinematic reaction shots are everywhere: “Her laughter ebbed into a smile. She crooked an eyebrow.” “Robert laughed, slapping his knee.” “He swore softly at himself.” (A curse is anger.) “Willie looked at us, mortification flushing his face.” (A blush is shame.) And so on.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;No doubt Eng is slyly mimicking the dated argot and patter of Maugham&#39;s work, a fictional universe of stinging retorts, inward groans, arched eyebrows, and the like. (For instance, Eng uses the verb “chaff”—to tease someone good-naturedly—in what looks like conscious imitation of Maugham, who liked the verb.) You could say that this stylistic inhabiting in turn allows Eng to do something daring and eccentric: to write, as a contemporary Malaysian writer of Chinese descent, a novel set in early-twentieth-century Penang almost entirely from the perspective of the interloping white community resident there. Into this apparently stable and monochrome existence, Eng then introduces the gentle subversion and deviance of his more interesting subplots—Lesley&#39;s passion for Sun Yat-sen&#39;s cause, Lesley&#39;s passion for Arthur, Maugham&#39;s passion for Gerald, Robert&#39;s erotic wandering.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;But these relationships and encounters lack the power and the narrative emphasis of the central Ethel Proudlock story, which casts an enviably dramatic shadow over the whole book. And the subversions are too gentle, so that Eng&#39;s portrait of Somerset Maugham and his colonial world has neither the rotten pungency of satire nor quite the vitality of a truly fresh realism. The kick of life always stubs its toe on cliché. Where is P. G. Wodehouse when you need him? ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;68rlzq&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 06 Nov 2023 20:06:01 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[How Can Determinists Believe in Free Will?]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/11/13/determined-a-science-of-life-without-free-will-robert-sapolsky-book-review]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-06T11:00:00.000Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6542de8305eb91fba6e6b197/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/231113_r43347.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;article >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attribute-verso-pattern=&quot;article-body&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;ArticlePageChunks&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;You&#39;re walking fast, late for work. The line into the subway is barely moving. A man is walking very slowly, holding up everyone behind him. You&#39;re annoyed. And then you catch a glimpse of him. He&#39;s walking with the shuffle of the very old. You&#39;re inclined to be a little more tolerant; after all, he can&#39;t walk any faster. You look again—no, he&#39;s not old, just drunk. It&#39;s too late for him to sober up, but, it occurs to you, it was once up to him not to be drunk. And now you&#39;re annoyed again.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;But why stop there? There are bars everywhere, and billboards advertising the pleasures of spirits. The days are getting colder, and you live in a cold country—a cold country and a decadent one. Everyone drinks; how could he do otherwise? But, again, why stop there? Generous soul that you are, you wonder if he had a bad day, or week, or year, or life—one marked by the kind of suffering from which the bottle promises respite. Can you be sure that he doesn&#39;t come from a long line of alcoholics, helpless in the grip of their compulsion?&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;You might go further. Perhaps all this was simply meant to be. Recall that old French polymath Pierre-Simon Laplace and his omniscient “demon.” If the demon knew where every particle in the universe was at a given moment, he could predict with perfect accuracy every moment in the future—which is another way of saying that the future is wholly “determined” by the past. The demon, of course, merely illustrates a thesis that can be stated in more sombre terms: everything that happens is the inevitable consequence of the laws of nature and what the universe was like once upon a time. We&#39;re bound to do what we in fact do.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;GenericCallout&quot;>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;external-link-embed--inline&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;a aria-label=&quot;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;The Best Books We Read This Week&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.newyorker.com/best-books-2023&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/best-books-2023&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;&lt;span >;&lt;strong>;The Best Books We Read This Week&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/a>;&lt;p >;&lt;em>;Read our reviews of notable new fiction and nonfiction, updated every Wednesday.&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;a aria-label=&quot;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;The Best Books We Read This Week&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.newyorker.com/best-books-2023&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/best-books-2023&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/63c800e4e99d89b838ada996/1:1/w_200%2Cc_limit/undefined&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/63c800e4e99d89b838ada996/1:1/w_120,c_limit/undefined 120w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/a>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;“Causal determinism,” the philosopher&#39;s unlovely term for that unsettling hypothesis, is the default assumption of most modern science. It matters a good deal if the idea implies that none of our actions are what we call “free.” If science tells us to be determinists, and determinism is incompatible with freedom, shouldn&#39;t we give up on judging people for doing what they were destined to do?&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;That&#39;s what the Stanford neurobiologist Robert M. Sapolsky urges. He thinks the time has come to accept the truth about determinism and acknowledge that “we have &lt;em>;no&lt;/em>; free will at all.” What follows? Early in his book “Determined: A Science of Life Without Free Will” (Penguin Press), Sapolsky lists, with the morbid relish of a man daring to think the unthinkable, the implications of his heresy: no one is ever blameworthy—or, equally, praiseworthy—for doing anything. No one, Sapolsky writes, “has &lt;em>;earned&lt;/em>; or is &lt;em>;entitled&lt;/em>; to being treated better or worse than anyone else.” Ordinary human sentiments—resentment and gratitude, love and hate—are pretty much irrational in their normal forms: “It makes as little sense to hate someone as to hate a tornado because it supposedly decided to level your house.” One practical implication is that, since nobody&#39;s to blame for anything, criminal justice shouldn&#39;t be about retribution. Accordingly, he tries to view human beings without judgment. Free-will skeptics are, he suggests, “less punitive and more forgiving.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The steps of his reasoning are familiar: if everything is determined, there is no freedom; if there is no freedom, there is no moral responsibility. Science tells us that everything is indeed determined. Ergo, no freedom; ergo, no responsibility. Are we bound to agree?&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Much of “Determined,” appropriately for a book by a neurobiologist, is an attempt to defend the part of the argument which sits safely in the scientist&#39;s wheelhouse: that our best contemporary science has established the truth of determinism. Sapolsky draws on explanations at every level—from atoms to culture—to make the case that everything we think and do is caused by something other than free will. We can&#39;t control, say, the conditions of the crucial first nine months of our existence. “Lots of glucocorticoids from Mom marinating your fetal brain, thanks to maternal stress, and there&#39;s increased vulnerability to depression and anxiety in your adulthood,” he writes. You thought your failing marriage was to blame for your depression. But it turns out it was all bound to happen long ago. It isn&#39;t so much that our blame was aimed in the wrong direction as it is that blame, in the strict sense, never truly made sense.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Biochemistry only confirms Sapolsky in his conviction, as does physics (though he treads more warily through the mysteries of a discipline at least as demanding as his own). History does, too: details from our species&#39; past, he argues, explain why some cultures are peaceable and others martial, some monotheistic and others polytheistic.&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Why do we resist the truth? In part because we&#39;re skilled at concocting stories in which we&#39;re in charge. One experiment Sapolsky mentions suggests that people had cooler attitudes about gay marriage when considering it in a room with a disgusting smell. The effect was connected to the way certain odors activate the brain&#39;s insular cortex, which is what makes rancid food nauseating to us. But did the subjects know what was going on in their heads? “Ask a subject, Hey, in last week&#39;s questionnaire you were fine with behavior A, but now (in this smelly room) you&#39;re not,” Sapolsky writes. “They&#39;ll claim some recent insight caused them, bogus free will and conscious intent ablaze, to decide that behavior A isn&#39;t okay after all.” They were being played, but were desperate to regard themselves as the players.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Sapolsky&#39;s summaries are pithy and pacy, his spoiling-for-a-fight tone enjoyably provocative. Still, he doesn&#39;t assert that any one piece of research demonstrates that there is no free will. Rather, he says, “All these disciplines collectively negate free will because they are all interlinked, constituting the same ultimate body of knowledge.” In the end, “there&#39;s not a single crack of daylight to shoehorn in free will.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;To his exasperation, though, many sophisticates are skeptical about free-will skepticism. In a 2020 survey of academic philosophers, some sixty per cent of them—a strikingly large majority in a profession allergic to consensus—didn&#39;t agree that determinism ruled out freedom. Where Sapolsky, who says that he has been a free-will skeptic since adolescence, sees an excitingly counterintuitive conclusion, philosophers often see a reductio ad absurdum. Determinism, they tend to hold, is compatible with freedom, and therefore with moral responsibility, and therefore with blame, gratitude, and so on.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The technical term for that happy reconciliation is “compatibilism.” A compatibilist, that is, agrees that our actions are determined but denies that this truth casts doubt on anything of significance about human practices. Sapolsky will have none of it. He devotes some of his most trenchant writing to these quislings, whose arguments, he claims, “boil down to three sentences”:&lt;/p>;&lt;blockquote >;&lt;div >;&lt;p>;a. Wow, there&#39;ve been all these cool advances in neuroscience, all reinforcing the conclusion that ours is a deterministic world.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;b. Some of those neuroscience findings challenge our notions of agency, moral responsibility, and deservedness so deeply that one must conclude that there is no free will.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;c. Nah, it still exists.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/blockquote>;&lt;p >;How fair is that précis? Sapolsky clearly thinks that philosophers should start with the results of the sciences (objective, external, impartial) and ask what they imply for our naïve prescientific self-conceptions. If science, coming from outside, tells us that our self-conceptions are confused, so much the worse for them. Yet there&#39;s another way of approaching the question: from the inside out.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Of those who take such an approach, the most influential is Peter Strawson, a compatibilist philosopher whose arguments make no appearance in “Determined.” (Sapolsky mentions him once in a list of his allies, evidently thinking of his son Galen.) What we label “free will,” as Strawson saw it, was something that we could grasp solely in relation to the role it plays in our lives, in our daily practices of judging others and ourselves.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Start from the fact that, in our dealings with other people, we are sometimes angry or resentful, or, in happier moments, grateful. Does the fact that we&#39;re material beings situated within vast chains of causation make these responses—Strawson calls them “reactive attitudes”—irrational? In any case, could we live an intelligible human life while giving up such reactions entirely?&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The really troubling forms of philosophical skepticism—say, about the authority of moral demands, the possibility of altruism, the legitimacy of governments—are troubling in part because it&#39;s possible to live without a belief in such things. Can we live without a belief in the possibility of holding one another and ourselves responsible for the things we do?尝试一下。 We are always a “sorry,” a “thank you,” or a “how dare you” away from slipping back into the bad old ways. Sapolsky&#39;s long-standing convictions on the subject notwithstanding, he admits to being a normal guy with a normal guy&#39;s feelings. “It&#39;s been a moral imperative for me to view humans without judgment or the belief that anyone deserves anything special, to live without a capacity for hatred or entitlement,” he writes. “And I just can&#39;t do it.” He&#39;s in permanent misalignment with his theory of the world: “Sure, sometimes I can sort of get there, but it is rare that my immediate response to events aligns with what I think is the only acceptable way to understand human behavior; instead, I usually fail dismally.” If even the archest of skeptics cannot live out his skepticism, how serious an alternative is it?&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;xpap8e&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;po7h1&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;For that matter, if Sapolsky has no choice in how he thinks, what would it even be to try to think any particular way? It&#39;s unclear how he could subscribe to “hard incompatibilism,” as he avows, and believe in such ancien-régime vestiges as “moral imperatives.” The very idea that someone “ought” to do something makes sense only if that person is capable of making choices.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;For Strawson (like Kant before him), the difference between a story of causation and a story of choice-making is one of viewpoint. We&#39;ll never purge ourselves of those “reactive attitudes,” nor should we try to. But that&#39;s not a rejection of determinism; as Strawson says, we can sometimes “achieve a kind of detachment from the whole range of natural attitudes and reactions . 。 。 and view another person (and even, perhaps, though this must surely be more difficult, oneself) in a purely objective light—to see another or others simply as natural creatures whose behavior, whose actions and reactions, we may seek to understand, predict and perhaps control.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;The parents of teen-age boys are always oscillating between regarding their impossible offspring as creatures moved by hormones to do stupid things and regarding them as rational human beings who should know better. In time, those boys will learn to give Mom a pass for her possibly perimenopausal outbursts and understand that Dad, with his atherosclerosis, occasionally forgets things. On a night out in college, they&#39;ll learn to spot when it might still be possible to persuade an increasingly drunk friend to order an Uber home and the point at which all that remains to do is to pick him up off the ground and bundle him into one as if he were an unwieldy mattress.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;What Sapolsky considers “the only acceptable way to understand human behavior,” then, is one that we adopt &lt;em>;some&lt;/em>; of the time. Is it really one we should adopt &lt;em>;all&lt;/em>; of the time? Physics tells us a story about ourselves in which we are as much matter and energy as that mattress. Biochemistry tells us another story. So does neuroscience. So do history, psychology, and anthropology. All these modes of explanation tell us, in various ways, that people are causal systems, enmeshed in larger ones. But, from a first-person perspective, we&#39;re seldom inclined to wait around to see what the system does when we&#39;re faced with a decision. Instead, we do what even Sapolsky finds himself compelled to do—we get on with things and open the kitchen cupboard to decide (or, anyway, “decide”) what kind of tea we&#39;re going to have.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;A few minutes later, a kettle boils.为什么？ Consider these answers: because I want a cup of Earl Grey; because it&#39;s teatime in England and that&#39;s what we do around here; because the water molecules have reached a certain energy state. Must we choose among these statements? Can&#39;t they all be true?&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Sapolsky, to his credit, resists the fallacy of moving from ontological reductionism (the correct view that we&#39;re all physical stuff, governed by the laws of physics) to methodological reductionism (the error of concluding that physics is the only discipline that explains anything). Wisely, he doesn&#39;t think that history, psychology, or anthropology are just window dressing on the hard truth of our material, molecular existence. Mental states and neurobiological physical states, Sapolsky thinks, “can&#39;t be separated—they&#39;re just two different conceptual entry points to considering the same processes.” Different, but apparently equal, neither privileged over the other. Why, then, does he resist the first-person register of explanation, in which we believe, want, intend, and decide?&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Probably because his notion of “free will” isn&#39;t the one we actually make use of. Every now and then, it occurs to Sapolsky that the parties to the debate may be talking past each other, and he makes an effort, a little grudgingly, to clarify his terms. “What is free will?” he asks early in the book. “Groan, we have to start with that.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;What follows is not a definition but a challenge. A man, Sapolsky invites us to imagine, “pulls the trigger of a gun.” That&#39;s one description. Another is that “the muscles in his index finger contracted.”为什么？ “Because they were stimulated by a neuron,” which was in turn “stimulated by the neuron just upstream. 。 。 。 And so on.” Then he throws down the gauntlet: “Show me a neuron (or brain) whose generation of a behavior is independent of the sum of its biological past, and for the purposes of this book, you&#39;ve demonstrated free will.”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;uo6ixw&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Sapolsky&#39;s qualifying phrase—“for the purposes of this book”—suggests he recognizes that there are other things “free will” might mean to other people. The real question is whether the thing he thinks has been disproved will be much missed—whether Sapolsky&#39;s concept of free will is “our” concept, what we take it to be when, uncorrupted by the specialists, we go about our days blaming and thanking, loving and hating.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;His definition of free will, or the test he proposes in lieu of one, exemplifies an approach advocated in the nineteen-fifties and sixties by the German-born philosopher Rudolf Carnap, one of the great exponents of logical positivism. Carnap, who thought that philosophy should be a handmaiden to the sciences, found ordinary language squishy and unreliable; philosophers, he argued, should reconstruct, or “explicate,” its terms in more precise ways. Take a term of ordinary language such as “warm,” a word we understand as relating to our sensations, and a term of science, “temperature,” which, unlike “warm,” is a quantitative notion, employable in scientific formulas. Carnap thought that we would do well to replace the first with the second, or, anyway, to use the second to define the first. Something is warmer when its temperature increases, and the temperature of a room, unlike its mere “warmth,” can be precisely and objectively defined with reference to a thermometer.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In the positivist spirit, a philosopher or a scientist may replace “We have free will” with some determinate claim that might be supported or undermined by experimental evidence. But if we&#39;re going to allow the experimental results, and the ambitious thesis that they support, to overthrow our everyday practices of praising, blaming, and punishing, the scientific explication had better be close enough to the everyday concept that underlies these practices. Otherwise, as Strawson—a leading critic of Carnap, and of logical positivism—objected at the time, we&#39;re not solving a problem; we&#39;re just changing the subject.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Sapolsky may want us to replace our everyday concept, complex and muddled as it must be, with a new, improved concept. But he needs to offer us a good argument for doing so. In other words, if this isn&#39;t how we already use “free will,” is it how we &lt;em>;should&lt;/em>; use it? We don&#39;t ask this question often enough. Maybe that&#39;s because “free will” has become, for better or for worse, a term of ordinary language. As with other such large, abstract questions, our professed views on the free-will problem rarely do justice to the complexity of our real thoughts on the subject.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;There are sane and humane reasons for reminding ourselves that, as Sapolsky puts it, “&lt;em>;some&lt;/em>; people have much less self-control and capacity to freely choose their actions than average, and that at times, we &lt;em>;all&lt;/em>; have much less than we imagine.” But Sapolsky and skeptical fellow-travellers such as Sam Harris want to blow up our everyday practices; they&#39;re convinced that the innumerable subtle distinctions we mark in our ordinary talk and practices don&#39;t matter. Whatever it is we think we&#39;ve got, we haven&#39;t got it.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;82gmdk&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;df99mb&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Once we give up on free will, after all, we have to be willing to say that nobody has ever done anything intentionally (or voluntarily or deliberately or on purpose). That no line can truly be drawn between the malicious and the accidental, the voluntary and the forced. That no event has really been an &lt;em>;action&lt;/em>;, except in the undemanding sense in which the puppet Punch killing Judy was an action. We are not, except in this minimal sense, “agents.” Bits of our bodies move; things happen. That&#39;s it.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Yet we can wonder whether this ideal of the “causeless cause” is what we really mean in our careless everyday talk of free will. If it isn&#39;t, then insisting on that as the appropriate standard is, as Strawson once remarked, “like offering a text-book on physiology to someone who says (with a sigh) that he wished he understood the workings of the human heart.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;As it happens, Carnap&#39;s own definition, or explication, of “free choice” was devised to be compatible with the truth of determinism. Free choice, he wrote, “is a decision made by someone capable of foreseeing the consequences of alternate courses of action and choosing that which he prefers.” He saw no contradiction between free choice thus understood and even the strongest form of determinism. More than that, he thought that without determinism—that is to say, without reliable relations of cause and effect—there &lt;em>;is&lt;/em>; no free will. The point of making a choice, he noted, is that it has consequences. Indeterminacy—should the kind that exists at the quantum level encroach upon the meso-level scale of human lives—would replace our agency with sheer randomness, which is not anyone&#39;s idea of freedom.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Still, if Sapolsky&#39;s radical revisionism threatens to eliminate our moral vocabulary altogether, the traditional compatibilist approaches can err in the other direction: they can deny us grounds for reforming our practices of moral judgment. So we might want to ask—in the philosophical tradition not of positivism but of pragmatism—about the “cash value,” the practical uses, of invoking free will. Ignore the many things we say about free will and focus on what we do. By attending to our practices, we can conduct a more profitable line of inquiry: What do we need free will to be?&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Consider these questions. How does my response to a student who has failed to meet a deadline change when I discover that she sprained her wrist the day before? How do I respond to a piece of fruit chucked at me when I discover that the chucker is two years old? How vehemently do I press for a tough prison sentence when I learn that the defendant was abused as a child? Is there a difference between someone jumping into a pool and being pushed in? Between falling in after he stepped on a banana peel and falling in because he was drunk?&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In each of these situations, we can ask whether the person in question had or lacked something called “free will.” But look back at the factors that seemed to undermine the exercise of free will: rotten luck, immaturity, circumstance, coercion, accident, and incapacity. When the terms on the obverse side of the contrast are so disparate, it&#39;s hard to be confident that there really is a single thing called “free will” whose presence or absence we can meaningfully debate.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The philosopher J. L. Austin, in a paper titled “A Plea for Excuses,” observed that, though it&#39;s tempting to view “freedom” as a positive term requiring elucidation, we tend to use it just to rule out one of these miscellaneous antitheses. Freedom&#39;s just another word for no excuses. In Austin&#39;s spirit, you can wonder how much would be lost if we ceased talking about free will altogether and spoke more specifically of what we meant. “He was not acting of his own free will,” you tell me. “What do you mean?” I ask. “Was he being held at gunpoint? Sleepwalking? High on narcotics?” “Oh, no,” you say, “I just mean he&#39;s a toddler.” Maybe you should have just said that. Maybe, in other words, there is no &lt;em>;one&lt;/em>; thing that we need “free will” to be.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Sapolsky&#39;s most persuasive passages remind us of the many modest changes that we have made to our practices in light of advances in our understanding of certain facts about ourselves. Things got better for people with epilepsy once we learned that the condition was not a form of demonic possession that was “brought on by someone&#39;s own freely chosen evil.” Things got better for people with schizophrenia (and for their families) once it was recognized that the condition was at base a biochemical disorder, not a product of faulty mothering. Some of our current moral conceptions and presumptions may come to seem just as confused. We may currently be blaming people whom it would be better to treat, tolerate, or simply avoid.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;hhm4k&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Or, perhaps, better to forgive. That was, after all, part of Sapolsky&#39;s case for his new morality: free-will skeptics are “less punitive and more forgiving.” To understand all, he might have said, is to forgive all. But he can&#39;t have really meant that. Forgiveness is, as much as vengeance, a concept that can be applied only from within the first-person point of view. If free-will skepticism means never having to say you&#39;re sorry, then it also means never being forgiven. Sapolsky&#39;s ethic of forgiveness demands that we retain something of our old-fashioned belief in holding one another responsible.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The traditional project of compatibilist philosophers has been to treat determinism, free will, and moral responsibility as fixed parts of a triad and to search for ways to reconcile them. The skeptics, seeing an irresolvable contradiction, have concluded that the whole idea of moral responsibility has to go. But there are other ways of reconciling scientific and moral inquiry. It may be that we need a suppler and more humane approach to holding one another responsible, an approach that takes more seriously what our best scientific accounts tell us about ourselves. We needn&#39;t follow the skeptics to the conclusion that the best morality would be no morality at all to recognize that our current morality remains a work in progress. ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;07m5iq&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 06 Nov 2023 20:06:01 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“Our Time Is Up,” by Clare Sestanovich]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/11/13/our-time-is-up-fiction-clare-sestanovich]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-06T11:00:00.000Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654287ded2c509c63cc3e5c9/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/231113_r43346.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;article >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attribute-verso-pattern=&quot;article-body&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;ArticlePageChunks&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;figure data-testid=&quot;IframeEmbed&quot; >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;IframeEmbedContainer&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;svg focusable=&quot;false&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 12 12&quot; width=&quot;32&quot; height=&quot;32&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Audio available&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M6 0C2.68573 0 0 2.68573 0 6V8.73736C0 10.5187 1.48129 12 3.26262 12H3.78785V11.0578C4.2899 10.8595 4.60907 10.3691 4.60907 9.8323V7.64241C4.60907 7.10556 4.28989 6.61524 3.78785 6.41698V5.47476H3.26262C2.39306 5.47476 1.62721 5.79438 1.05047 6.32323V6C1.05047 3.29202 3.29202 1.05047 6 1.05047C8.70797 1.05047 10.9495 3.29202 10.9495 6V6.32323C10.3728 5.79438 9.6069 5.47476 8.73736 5.47476H8.21216V6.41698C7.71013 6.61524 7.39092 7.10555 7.39092 7.64241V9.8323C7.39092 10.3692 7.71012 10.8595 8.21216 11.0578V12H8.73736C10.5187 12 12 10.5187 12 8.73736V6C12 2.68573 9.31422 0 6 0Z&quot; fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; clip-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;Listen to this story&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;iframe height=&quot;60&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; sandbox=&quot;allow-scripts allow-same-origin&quot; title=&quot;Embedded Frame&quot; src=&quot;https://www.wnyc.org/widgets/ondemand_player/thenewyorker/#file=https://downloads.newyorker.com/mp3/231113_sestanovich_audio.mp3&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay *; encrypted-media *;剪贴板写入；自动播放; fullscreen; picture-in-picture&quot;>;&lt;/iframe>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;p>;Clare Sestanovich reads.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;p >;The mirrors reveal when it&#39;s time to clean again. A thin layer of dust on the one in the bedroom, toothpaste and fingerprints on the one in the bathroom, which doubles as a cabinet door. All the windows become mirrors at the end of the day, when it takes a subtle adjustment of the eyes to look through yourself instead of at yourself. But the windows will never be cleaned; the most that can be hoped for is a hard, purifying rain. There&#39;s a yellow streak of bird shit on the glass in the living room, crusted over now, and the kitchen window still bears the ghostly pattern that Angela once traced on the fogged-up surface while waiting for something on the stove, she can no longer remember what: a pot to boil, a formless egg to acquire edges and turn opaque, a single drop of oil to escape its pan and scald her out of her thoughts.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Since when does Angela care about cleaning? The other day, at dinner with a friend, she found herself extolling the virtues of a certain type of mop. She recently learned several methods for removing stains from supposedly stainless steel. She has even wished, on occasion, that she owned an iron.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;An iron! More symbol than tool at this point, and Angela doesn&#39;t like what the symbol stands for. She&#39;s not a housewife. For one thing, she rents. True, she&#39;s married, but there wasn&#39;t really a wedding, because she&#39;s opposed to weddings. She&#39;s employed. In theory, empowered.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;GenericCallout&quot;>;&lt;p >;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/books/this-week-in-fiction/clare-sestanovich-11-13-23&quot;>;Clare Sestanovich on routine and rupture.&lt;/a>;&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;The thing about the mop is that it&#39;s satisfying. Under the supervision of a therapist, Angela and Will have been talking a lot about satisfaction. How to define it, where to find it, whether they can feel it—have it—at the same time. Each swipe of the mop proves its usefulness, a glistening arc on a floor that a second ago looked OK but now is revealed to have been dusty and dull all along. The water in the bucket turns gray.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Angela doesn&#39;t like the therapist. Why are they talking about satisfaction when they could be talking about happiness?&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;When I was your age—&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Angela has heard this sentence completed so many times, in so many ways, that by now she can line up her mother&#39;s entire life beside her own entire life (thus far) and compare them year by year. She can try on the other life as you might try on a dress forgotten at the back of the closet: with no hope of it fitting, and yet with some perverse desire to see exactly where the seams stretch or the zipper catches, where two pieces of fabric refuse to meet.&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;At age six, Angela&#39;s mother watched the apartment building where she and her parents lived burn to the ground. At age six, Angela moved into a new house, with her very own bedroom. She was afraid to fall asleep in it, her heart beating wildly in the dark.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;At eight, Angela&#39;s mother lost her father. Something to do with the smoke that had got into his lungs. At eight, Angela lost her asthma inhaler. She knew it was expensive, so she didn&#39;t tell anyone for weeks, wheezing loudly through gym class.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;GenericCallout&quot;>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;Podcast: The Writer&#39;s Voice&lt;/strong>;&lt;br/>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/podcast/the-writers-voice/clare-sestanovich-reads-our-time-is-up&quot;>;&lt;em>;Listen to Clare Sestanovich read “Our Time Is Up.”&lt;/em>;&lt;/a>;&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;At eleven, Angela&#39;s mother worked all afternoon in her stepfather&#39;s laundromat, where he occasionally slid his hand under her shirt or, in the summertime, up the loose openings in her shorts. She started wearing pants all year round. At eleven, Angela tried to pretend that her nipples, which had puffed up and made two tiny tents in her T-shirt, did not exist. Once (but only once), a boy in her class pinched the left tent between his thumb and his index finger, and then it definitely existed.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;At eighteen, Angela&#39;s mother did not get to go to college. At eighteen, Angela did not want to go to college. She wanted to live on a farm in Italy, where she could turn grapes into wine with her bare feet. She had saved nine hundred dollars of her hard-earned wages for airfare.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;At twenty-two, Angela&#39;s mother married Angela&#39;s father, in a church. He was more than a decade older than her, but, if anything, she considered that a good thing: he had more experience, and also more money. At twenty-two, Angela, having never been to Italy, having been reminded that her mother did not receive a single cent of her own hard-earned wages until her stepfather died, graduated with a degree in American Studies. Degrees were also said to be earned, but other than a large amount of debt, which could not possibly be paid off by crushing grapes between her toes, Angela didn&#39;t think there was much evidence that she deserved hers.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;At twenty-five, Angela&#39;s mother had Angela&#39;s brother. At twenty-five, Angela took Plan B: once for a broken condom, once after unprotected sex with a man who was married, and once because of a nameless, baseless feeling that there was something inside her that needed to be expelled.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;4leqt8&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;At thirty-one, Angela&#39;s mother had Angela. At thirty-one, Angela went to her first baby shower. Gifts everywhere: clothes that would fit for only a few months, a stroller that cost as much as a used car. She vowed never to go to one again.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;At thirty-nine, Angela&#39;s mother threatened to divorce Angela&#39;s father. An affair. She eventually reconsidered, but not before she told Angela all about it. In the end, she said, pity won out: he didn&#39;t even know how to use the washing machine.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Here Angela&#39;s desire for comparison flags. She will be forty at the end of the year. Thinking about her mother&#39;s life is tiring, though not as tiring, she reminds herself in her mother&#39;s voice, as actually living it. The dress is harder to take off than it was to put on. Having tugged it over her hips, she leaves it there, the empty top flopping in front of her. Her stomach is soft and her breasts are heavy and she has no children to blame for either fact. None of this—her painless upbringing, her pointless degree, the money she finally spent on a vacation to Tuscany, which she could have spent on a thousand other things or, better yet, saved—would matter to Angela&#39;s mother if there were children.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;The therapist suggests that they talk about what matters to Angela instead of what matters to her mother. Will nods. He agrees with the therapist because he&#39;s agreeable, which is part of why Angela married him, which is why she can&#39;t object to the nodding, even though it irritates her. She wishes she were agreeable, too. Like the therapist, Will is full of good suggestions: more intimacy (physical), less inertia (existential). He wonders aloud if they should get a cat.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Whenever her mother calls, Angela nods to prove she&#39;s listening. They live four hundred miles apart: Angela by the beach, her mother in the desert. They used to talk every Sunday afternoon, but lately her mother has been calling on any day, at any time, even late at night. In the middle of a conversation, she accuses Angela of having hung up, and Angela has to remind herself that nodding means nothing on the phone. The only person she&#39;s proving anything to is herself.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The summer heat arrives and Angela opens all the windows, relieving herself of her reflection. The dust that accumulates during this time of year is no more visible than dust at any other time of the year, but, when Angela wipes the surfaces in the apartment with a microfibre cloth, the cloth ends up not the usual gray but a more alarming black. They live on a busy street. The dust is probably more like soot. They could close the windows, but Angela doesn&#39;t like the artificial cold of air-conditioning.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Plus, refrigerants are bad for the planet.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“But pollutants are bad for us,” Will says.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;As a compromise, they turn on the AC only at night. In some ways, they&#39;re too good at compromising. Every morning, the air is dry, their eyes crusty.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Early one Monday, before leaving for the office, Angela removes the eye crust and applies mascara in front of the bathroom mirror—clean but streaky. She works at a talent agency, where her job is to believe that her clients&#39; big break is about to come, or else to refuse to believe that it has come and gone. All the clients, mostly actors and models, put a lot of work into their appearance, and so do many of the agents. In front of the mirror, Angela ignores the way her eyelashes clump together unattractively, because in general she doesn&#39;t try very hard to be attractive. Her halfhearted makeup is, in its way, a point of pride. Unlike her apparent affinity for mops and irons and microfibre rags, her disdain for the rules and rewards of feminine style is a small triumph of principle.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Half an hour later, stopped in traffic, Angela watches a driver in the next lane apply lipstick, then brush a fine powder over her face. The cars start moving and the woman keeps brushing. Dangerous! (But as dangerous as refrigerants? As pollution? As turning into your mother?) Behind her, the other cars start to honk. The woman snaps her compact shut and, without turning her head, raises a middle finger in the air. Triumphs of principle are everywhere, Angela thinks, now doubting her own. Is the woman more or less attractive than her? She tries to get a better look at the woman&#39;s face, but the other car speeds up and is soon out of sight. In traffic, Angela somehow always chooses the slowest lane.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;d4it09&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Attraction, related to satisfaction, is another one of the therapist&#39;s big themes. After eleven years, Will still says Angela is beautiful. The therapist suggests the word “sexy,” which makes Angela recoil. Will notices, of course. He&#39;s disappointed, of course. They don&#39;t have as much sex as he would like.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;His disappointment is a wide, finely meshed net—hard to wriggle out of. In her efforts, Angela is tempted again toward principle: what is this, the nineteen-fifties? Haven&#39;t we agreed that husbands are not the only ones who get to have desires? These questions sound pointed when she practices them behind the steering wheel—when she&#39;s impatient or aggrieved, when she&#39;s alone—but they don&#39;t lead anywhere good.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;At the office, Angela sits at a desk that&#39;s hers on some days and Carrie&#39;s on others. There&#39;s a sticky note from Carrie on the computer screen. &lt;em>;Remove crumbs from keyboard&lt;/em>;. Mortified, Angela tears up the note and throws it in the trash.&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;a data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/11/13/our-time-is-up-fiction-clare-sestanovich&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/11/13/our-time-is-up-fiction-clare-sestanovich&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;“Dont you see You were never an ugly duckling.

Wives (another word to recoil from) get to have them, too. Angela can see Will nod. But what does she desire? As she extracts crumbs from between the keys, a string of letters, utter nonsense, appears on her screen.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Will and Angela started therapy because of the kids question: whether they want them, what it would mean to have them. For years, they&#39;ve avoided answering it by discussing it—long, looping conversations that are never finished, only abandoned. Afterward, they cry or fall asleep or order an elaborate takeout meal, which makes Angela feel guilty: all that plastic. Now they&#39;re running out of time to answer the question, but they&#39;ve spent at least half of their sessions arguing over a different one: whether Angela&#39;s mother needs to move out of her house. It&#39;s Angela&#39;s father&#39;s house, too, but Angela never thinks of it that way. He bought it, but her mother chose it. He left it early in the morning and returned to it late at night. She decorated it and redecorated it. He called from the top of the stairs when he was looking for something he couldn&#39;t find.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;At first, Angela and Will were in agreement about the house: things were getting out of hand; alarm bells were ringing. But Angela lost the argument with her mother, and after that her only choice was to bury it someplace inaccessible, practically unrememberable. To see Will dig it up again was enraging—more enraging, somehow, than the original dispute.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“How can you ignore it?” he asks. He&#39;s incredulous, but never impatient. “It&#39;s right in front of our eyes.” The therapist smiles at him encouragingly.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Will means the plastic bags, the stacks of magazines, the clamshell containers, the shelf in the pantry where her mother keeps all the complimentary snacks she&#39;s received on airplanes: miniature packages of pretzels and cookies, squat cans of tomato juice. (She protests if the flight attendant tries to open the can.) Admittedly, these collections are fastidiously organized. The plastic bags are stored in the sleeves of Angela&#39;s father&#39;s old dress shirts, which dangle from hooks all over the kitchen like severed limbs.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;And not all of it, as Angela&#39;s mother and then Angela herself have pointed out, is trash. Her mother is a talented ceramicist, a hobby that she practiced in moderation for the many decades that she had a job, and then in a kind of ecstatic frenzy as soon as she didn&#39;t. At her job—first she was a secretary and then she was an administrative assistant, though the work itself never changed—she didn&#39;t get to produce anything. Now every surface in the house displays her wares. Empty flower vases and stacks of cereal bowls, mugs that chart her progress at the wheel, their slouching posture improving until they are all in perfect, proud proportion. She makes teapots and gravy boats, despite never making tea or gravy. On a high shelf, Angela once found half a dozen egg cups, each one painted with a baby chick. She stood on a stool, eye level with the chicks. Why doesn&#39;t her mother give these things away?&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The therapist tries to steer the conversation back to bigger, harder questions.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;“Put aside, for a second, who &lt;em>;you&#39;re&lt;/em>; attracted to,” she says to Angela at the start of one session. “Do you believe that someone could be attracted to you?”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The therapist looks about the same age as Angela&#39;s mother. A second-waver, probably. (Not that Angela&#39;s mother has ever heard of the second wave.) She wears sensible shoes but expensive sweaters. Over the course of their sessions, she&#39;s been letting her hair gradually go gray. Angela can picture her in one of those consciousness-raising groups in the seventies, where all the women were given mirrors and instructed to look at their vaginas—presumably for the first time. The idea, as Angela understands it, was that once you saw yourself you could know yourself. &lt;em>;Be&lt;/em>; yourself.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Sounds nice! The mirror stuff seems quaint now, but Angela isn&#39;t totally sure why. Was everyone supposed to have done their own self-exploration—self-realization—long ago? She certainly hadn&#39;t. In adolescence, the approved period for such exploring, the only suitable mirror in her parents&#39; house would have been the full-length in the hall closet, next to the winter coats and the umbrellas. And anyway, back then, Angela had a different scale of exploration in mind: Italy, the Alps, something vast and impersonal. The sticky, unfamiliar folds of her vulva grossed her out. By the time she could appreciate the point of more local knowledge, it seemed too late. Plenty else had been down there: fingers, tongues, a whole clove of garlic (for bacterial vaginosis), various buzzing rubber toys (for fun). After all that, to admit that she hadn&#39;t fully seen what she had let many people touch would have been too embarrassing.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;v32k1r&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Now is the time to admit it. Here is a paid professional, a licensed therapist, who has been asking for their admissions. But Angela is pretty sure she&#39;s seen enough. You don&#39;t really need the mirror. The clitoris is a raisin flattened by a shoe. One of her labia, slightly larger than the other, droops like a lazy eyelid. It&#39;s not the vivid, secret pink of the body&#39;s interior. Like any exterior, its original color has been weathered a worldly gray.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;When Angela&#39;s father falls and breaks his wrist, it&#39;s been a few months since Angela and Will last argued about the house. Her father is eighty-one, with a history of minor hospitalizations. This time, he slipped, or tripped—the story is vague. He tried to brace his fall. It could happen to anyone, her mother keeps saying, which means: it could happen to someone young. He&#39;s still in the hospital, for some reason; his blood pressure, her mother says cryptically. Or maybe his blood-cell count? Her uncertainty is alarming enough that Angela and Will book a hotel with credit-card points and fly from Los Angeles to Phoenix. Angela makes certain compromises on the plane. They&#39;ll fix up the house. The junk can go, but the art will stay. Or fine, not all of it: just the essential stuff, the not lopsided stuff.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Will has made an informational call to a retirement community. There are tour guides who can show them around. Angela doesn&#39;t want to talk about it.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“My mom is barely seventy.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Will doesn&#39;t say anything, because he knows she knows what he will say: age is always relative. He scrolls through the facility&#39;s promotional materials online, tilting the screen in her direction.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Is there any harm in looking?”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;There&#39;s a dining room, a rec room, a man-made pond, a hair salon. There are art classes and therapy groups. One wing is for what the Web site calls independent living. How could anyone object to independent living?&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“They&#39;d be able to stay together,” Will says.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Who said anything about them splitting up?”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In the tense silence that follows, Angela, in the middle seat, becomes aware of the woman to her right—younger than her, but not by much, staring studiously out the window. From this angle, it&#39;s hard to know what the woman really looks like; she might look very different if they were face to face.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“It can&#39;t be cheap,” Angela says.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;With the therapist, she and Will have planned to discuss the cost of children. They haven&#39;t said anything about the cost of parents. Angela follows the younger woman&#39;s gaze out the window, but the view is obstructed by the wing of the plane. She closes her eyes and listens to the engine, to remind herself that there is something keeping so much heavy metal aloft.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;When Angela pictures her mother, the image that appears is decades out of date. Dark hair and unspotted skin, a bony frame that would be called petite, not fragile. This image feels like something she&#39;s remembering rather than inventing, but it&#39;s hard to tell the difference. When Angela opens her eyes, the flight attendant is handing her a paper napkin and a flimsy cup. Soda crackles over ice. She splits open a package of almonds and pours them straight into her mouth.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;They buy a seat for the shower and put a plastic bag over her father&#39;s cast before turning the water on. He&#39;s still not entirely steady on his feet.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“See,” her mother insists. “He&#39;s going to need plastic bags.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Patiently, Will tells her that she can keep one shirtsleeve&#39;s worth. He unstuffs the rest, pulling the bags out one at a time, until there are a dozen limp arms on the counter. He looks around for his next task.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The kitchen&#39;s elaborate architecture of detritus—towers of dishwashered takeout containers, a whole skyline of empty salad-dressing bottles—turns out to conceal a simpler, uglier landscape: mold, moth larvae, grease, something sticky, cobwebs, crumbs, pencil shavings, more mold. Angela&#39;s mother does not avoid the evidence. While Angela herds mouse droppings into a dustpan, she hovers behind her, enumerating all the treasures that she&#39;s saved over the years: swim-team trophies, letters from summer camp, red-eyed photographs with elaborate captions written on the back. When she says “saved,” what she means is “rescued.” Angela&#39;s prom dress is shrouded in dry-cleaner plastic and kept, inexplicably, in the hall closet.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“This is your past,” her mother says, sweeping her arm grandly around the house. “Your history.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Back at the hotel, Will takes a long shower. Angela consults the minibar prices, turns the TV on and then instantly off. Listening to the shower spray the shower curtain, Angela considers whether to repeat what her mother said. “History” is a weighty word. Will might think she&#39;s telling him in order to pick a fight, or at least to make a point, but she would be telling him only to—well, just to tell him. She has no idea what the point is. The water turns off. The shower rings slide along the rod. This is the unbidden intimacy of routine: to know exactly what he is doing on the other side of a closed door. In her head, she can see him turn his towel into a rope, then shuttle it back and forth across his back. At what point, she wonders, does routine become life? He opens the door an inch: steam, heat, a vaguely floral scent. Next, he&#39;ll smear a circle on the mirror, stick his neck out to get closer to his reflection. He&#39;ll look with special scrutiny at the stray hairs on his neck and shoulders. They&#39;re hardly noticeable, pale and delicate—almost elegant in their alienness, Angela thinks—but they distress him. As a kid, Will says, he dreaded his father&#39;s bare torso, pale and lumpy clay from which misplaced hairs just like these seemed to be constantly multiplying, his body newly confused about where and what to grow.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The bathroom door opens all the way. Angela can tell that Will is surprised to find her there watching him—instead of watching the TV, say, or whatever it is on her phone that makes her smile the faint, enigmatic smile he no longer asks about. (What&#39;s so funny?) In this room that looks exactly as they expected it would, surprise saves them. They smile at each other and their smiles are at least a little bit enigmatic. They kiss each other. His chest still wet, his neck and ears steamed pink. His hair, dripping onto her forehead, makes her think of dew. The way desire can feel brand new every time. She takes one of his errant shoulder hairs between her teeth and tugs.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;2qfujc&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;But the sound he makes is not the right kind of pain. Not enlivening pain. Not sexy pain. It&#39;s the sound of ordinary displeasure, the quick-drying disappointment of bodies that no amount of steam and soap will transform. Instinctively, he pulls away. Angela looks down at her shirt, at the Rorschach imprint of Will&#39;s damp chest. Is this shame or anger? Her mistake or his? He&#39;ll insist it&#39;s OK; he&#39;ll try to recover, because their therapist has taught them the importance of resiliency. Even the not young, they have been assured, can bounce back. Will touches Angela&#39;s shoulder, which should feel comforting, even arousing, but instead feels like nothing. She thinks about the bedspread getting wet under his towel. She multiplies fifty-two by eleven. Five hundred and seventy-two weeks of on-average weekly sex, plus another hundred for the early weeks (the sexy weeks), minus twenty or thirty for some of the later weeks (the worst weeks).&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“What are you thinking about?” His hand is still on her shoulder.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Angela goes to the bathroom and closes the door. The room is still full of moisture, the toilet seat damp under her thighs. She lingers at the sink. Holding her wrists under cold water, she can see the outline of the circle he wiped on the mirror. She leans in, so that the portal perfectly frames her face, and then she looks away.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In the morning, her mother has brought the trophies up from the basement. Plastic figures caught in the act of achievement: tennis racquet in mid-swing, cleated foot in mid-kick, toes curled on a ledge, ready to dive into some unseen body of water. Angela remembers these trophies clearly. Before each competition, they were lined up by height so that everyone could compare them in advance: from impressive pedestals all the way down to mere platforms. Each extra tier made the thing easier to grip, more satisfying to hoist in the air the way real athletes do. The trophies meant nothing after that, once they&#39;d been brought home and clustered among all the others of similar height.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;But now here they are on the carpet, insisting on their prowess even as their gold coating chips away, exposing the dull surface underneath. Scurrying up and down the stairs, her mother seems younger than she did yesterday. Will picks up a trophy, looking back and forth between the figure and Angela, as if searching for a resemblance.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;“You never told me you played softball.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“I didn&#39;t, really.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The faces on the trophies look like they&#39;ve been melted off, shiny and blank. Angela&#39;s mother shouts from the basement, “Of course you did!”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;She emerges clutching an outfielder&#39;s androgynous torso. The story she tells is something out of a movie. A championship game, a home run destined to break the tie, until Angela, backed up against the center-field fence, grabbed it right out of the air. Robbed!&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Angela is about to object, but Will beats her to it: “No way.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;He&#39;s found a cardboard box and is stacking the trophies on their sides, which makes them look like a pile of corpses. As always, his incredulity is mild; her mother may not even have noticed it. She hurries over to the box, waving her hands above it ineffectually.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Wait—wait a minute.” Bending down over the stack of trophies, she seems to lose her balance, lurching forward before catching herself. She stands up quickly, fear and pride vying on her face. Will reaches for her elbow, but she jerks her arm away. “When I was your age. I mean, when I was that age”—she gestures at the trophies—“we didn&#39;t play sports. The boys played and we watched.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Didn&#39;t you like tennis?” Angela says.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;“That was later.” Her mother snatches a figure from the box. “Too late.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Multiple figures, actually. There are three girls on top of this trophy, arms around one another&#39;s shoulders. They look exactly the same: matching uniforms; featureless, indistinguishable faces. Their chests are gently rounded, one mound instead of two. The metal plaque below them says “Participation.” Pressing the trophy into Angela&#39;s hands, her mother repeats the story of her heroics: her outstretched glove, reaching, waiting. The crowd was full of mothers holding their breath.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Robbed!” she says for the second time.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The more Angela thinks about it—the climactic moment of the climactic game, the ball sailing toward her, its perfect, inevitable, downward arc—the truer it seems. Surely it happened to someone.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Will is struggling to close the box. The flaps keep springing open. Angela bends down to help him, because she&#39;s good at this—the box thing. Getting one end of the first flap under one end of the second flap at the same time that you get the other end of the first flap over the other end of the second flap. She can feel her mother watching her, but Angela keeps her eyes on the box. It&#39;s satisfying when they&#39;re finished, the flaps coerced into their flat, unnatural shape. It&#39;s easy to ignore what&#39;s inside.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Will shows her parents the retirement community online. They&#39;ve agreed to take baby steps: first the Web site, then—maybe—the tour. Will is the one who says baby steps. Angela says, Don&#39;t infantilize them.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The images flick by on the screen: the buffet line, a smiling receptionist, the pond with two gray ducks. Her father makes vague sounds of curiosity. Her mother sits very still, straight back and stony face.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Don&#39;t breathe in my ear,” she says.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Will schedules a tour. He puts the box of trophies on the curb while Angela&#39;s parents take a nap. (Angela didn&#39;t know they took naps.)&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;The tour begins in independent living, passes through assisted living by way of the pond, and concludes in the memory wing. A savvier guide, Angela thinks, would have reversed the route, turning inescapable decline into an illusion of defiance: life could end with your very own kitchenette, figure-drawing classes, bread crumbs tossed to the ducks, enough strength to stand up from a chair after you sit down.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;5t28j8&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;They have to stop a few times during the tour, sometimes right in the middle of the hall, so that her father can catch his breath. Angela&#39;s mother—still stony-faced, silent—ignores this, so Angela is the one to put her hand on his back. She feels the air go in and out of his lungs. His body expands and contracts.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;When the tour is over, they&#39;re invited to meet the residents in the dining room. There are crisp white tablecloths and brown plastic trays, windows that look onto the parking lot. Only four o&#39;clock, but dinner is being served.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Look,” Angela&#39;s mother says. “All the servers are women.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;There&#39;s an awkward pause, in which the tour guide surveys the room, as if in search of evidence to the contrary. But Angela&#39;s mother is right. The women are all ages, in matching button-down shirts and not quite invisible hairnets. A teen-ager with bad posture ladles soup, a middle-aged woman with a weak chin tosses salad. One of them seems old enough to live here herself. The tour group watches the women in silence for a moment, and then the guide—she, too, is a woman, not the youngest but certainly the prettiest—clears her throat and changes the subject. She assures them that the residents are all very impressive people: former artists, former teachers, former entrepreneurs. Will notes that Angela&#39;s father was an entrepreneur, too. He&#39;s using his most agreeable voice. The guide smiles gratefully at him, but Angela&#39;s father doesn&#39;t seem to have heard.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;While the rest of them wait their turn at the buffet, her mother stands by the windows, squinting out at the view. Angela accepts a bowl of soup. Up close, she can see that the teen-age server is wearing too much makeup: bright lips, caked-over pimples, eyelashes with an unnatural upward curl. Who is she wearing it &lt;em>;for&lt;/em>;? The question embarrasses Angela, even though she hasn&#39;t said it out loud—a question a mother would ask. She takes the soup to the window.&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;a data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/11/13/our-time-is-up-fiction-clare-sestanovich&amp;quot;}&quot;

It knocks across the uneven ground for a few feet, then tips over. The boy jumps out in plenty of time, laughing.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“All children eventually take away their parents&#39; keys,” Angela&#39;s mother says, without turning away from the window.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“She doesn&#39;t want to go.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;They&#39;re back at the hotel, lights off, under the covers.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“But is that a good enough reason?” Will asks.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;They&#39;ve spent only one night here but already the sheets have been changed, the new set tucked tightly under the mattress. Angela feels a little trapped.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;“It&#39;s not a reason at all,” she says. “It&#39;s just a desire.”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;yzlq73&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;She stares up at the ceiling, dark but getting less dark. Or no, the same amount of dark—she&#39;s just getting used to it. Will falls asleep before her, as he always does, snoring softly. He tosses and turns a lot, and this, too, has become routine. When he flings his arm across her chest, jostling one breast against the other, she doesn&#39;t really mind. Their bodies are blind and dumb. In the partial dark, in her dimming mind, for right now but possibly also forever, she is all alone. His arm slides down, pressing against her bladder, which makes her realize she needs to pee. The bathroom seems far away. She shakes her legs to loosen the sheets but doesn&#39;t get up.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;When she finally falls asleep, an ordinary dream turns into a sex dream. At the beginning of the dream, Angela is supervising some sort of field trip—a bunch of teen-agers packed onto a school bus. She&#39;s not the teacher, just the chaperon, and she&#39;s too afraid to enforce any of the rules. When a game of spin the bottle starts at the back of the bus, she pretends not to notice. The bus is met at its destination by a team of nurses in monochrome scrubs, who lead all the teen-agers into a building that looks exactly like the main building of the retirement community. Unlike Angela, the nurses are good at getting the kids to be quiet. “You have a lot to learn,” they say sternly—to the kids, or maybe to her.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The sex starts in the dining room, and, as in most of Angela&#39;s sex dreams, she is not the one having it. The room is crowded, old people and teen-agers all mixed together, chatting, helping themselves to seconds, eating off one another&#39;s plates without even bothering to ask. At some point, Angela realizes that they&#39;re naked. Is her mother in there? Watching from the far side of the buffet, holding a plate she hasn&#39;t yet filled, Angela is pretty sure that the young are having sex with the young and the old are having sex with the old, but the longer she watches the less certain she becomes; all the bodies, actually, seem to look the same. She doesn&#39;t look down at her own.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In the dream, she&#39;s a little afraid and a little turned on. When she wakes up—the room is its darkest dark again—she still is. Will is on his back, breath flapping through his mouth, arm over his head, as if he were waving to someone. Angela squeezes a hand between her thighs, to feel herself respond: the crackle of a not quite near-enough radio station, the creak of ice under the weight of a shoe. But she doesn&#39;t keep the hand there. It&#39;s the beginning of masturbating she likes, that first exploratory touch. To see if anything&#39;s there. The rest of it, the dutiful search, too often disappoints. Does she even know what she&#39;s looking for?&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Will rolls toward her, his open mouth beside her open ear. She presses gently under his chin and his jaw gives in easily. The noise stops. She stays awake for a while, the dream half dissolved, the static in her crotch half gone—that is, still there.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;When it&#39;s time to return to California, they still haven&#39;t decided anything. But they&#39;ve cleaned. Angela has swept, sponged, Dustbustered. She&#39;s sorted glass from plastic, plastic from cardboard. Her hands smell like rubber gloves.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Look how much more room there is,” she says, opening closet doors with a magician&#39;s flourish. The winter coats were moth-eaten. The prom dress is gone.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Room for what?” her mother asks.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;2bxpi&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;She wants to drive them to the airport. She wants to give them half a dozen ceramics. A soup bowl, a serving bowl, a mug. At least two egg cups. She&#39;ll pack them carefully. There&#39;s bubble wrap in the basement.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;“There isn&#39;t,” Angela says. “Not anymore.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In the end, they compromise: a taxi to the airport, just a mug. The one Angela chooses is slightly off balance—she pictures the wet clay wobbling, the momentum of the wheel briefly taking over—but she likes the color: blue that looks black, the deeper color visible only in a certain light.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“That one?” Her mother laughs. Maybe the laugh means, I knew you would choose that one. Maybe it even means, I love you for choosing that one. Angela wraps the mug in several layers of underwear and stuffs it with a sock before putting it in her bag. She wonders if her mother will see it again.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;On the plane, Angela and Will are seated behind a baby who whimpers feebly from takeoff to landing. Would it be better, Angela asks, if he really, truly cried?&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Better for whom?” Will wants to know.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;It&#39;s only when they get home—the mail clogging the mail slot, the stale smell of rooms left by themselves—that they realize they&#39;ve missed their therapy appointment. Angela opens the windows and throws a softening onion in the trash. She imagines all the things they might have said to the therapist. Not the usual things: the careful criticisms, the qualified complaints, question after question.这是正常的吗？ What&#39;s normal? They are almost forty. They still don&#39;t know. Haven&#39;t they always wanted to be exceptional?&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;No, instead of questions: confessions, accusations. It&#39;s a strange, sour sort of satisfaction to hear them in her head. She may be beautiful, but she is less beautiful than before. He calls her sexy because he wants sex. There are other people, you know, who want it, too. Sometimes makeup shows you still care. There&#39;s a woman at the office (eyeliner, earrings) who makes him feel—well, what? Desired? Empowered? Something other than agreeable. At what point should they agree to disagree?&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Will is already unpacking his bag, because the longer you wait the harder it gets. Angela unzips her suitcase and removes the ceramic mug. She holds it up to the light, tilting it until black reveals blue. The blue of water under the surface or blood under the skin. Then she tilts her hand a little farther and the handle breaks off the cup. Or is it the other way around—the cup breaks off the handle? There&#39;s a crack and shards on the ground and Angela is left holding the pointless piece.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;For a moment, she just stares, unable to think of what to do next. But it isn&#39;t really a decision. She gets a broom from the closet and sweeps everything into a small, efficient pile. When she looks up, Will is watching her. She laughs, so he laughs, too. They don&#39;t really know what they&#39;re laughing at—what it means. Does her laugh sound like her mother&#39;s?&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The cup didn&#39;t break into that many pieces, actually: four big ones, each as sharp as a knife. But there are probably smaller ones she can&#39;t see; they can travel farther than you&#39;d think. Days from now, at the other end of the room, a tiny, blue-black shard might pierce the sole of her bare foot and make her call out—the pain of surprise, which can also be pleasure. Angela looks at Will and her vision briefly blurs. She won&#39;t find the pieces now, but she might later, when she&#39;s stopped looking, when she&#39;s bending down to pick up some other delicate thing that&#39;s slipped from her hand. ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>; &lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/ div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;div>;&lt;div>;&lt;div>;&lt;div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt; /div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 06 Nov 2023 20:06:01 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Reinventing the Dinosaur]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/11/13/dinosaurs-life-on-earth-netflix-series]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-06T11:00:00.000Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65454215f7a240dd4220b5ec/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/231113_r43343_rd.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;article >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attribute-verso-pattern=&quot;article-body&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;ArticlePageChunks&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;figure data-testid=&quot;IframeEmbed&quot; >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;IframeEmbedContainer&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;iframe height=&quot;90&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; sandbox=&quot;allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups&quot; title=&quot;Embedded Frame&quot; src=&quot;https://audm.herokuapp.com/player-embed?pub=newyorker&amp;amp;articleID=65426891c9c56d56b2a0bc85&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay *; encrypted-media *;剪贴板写入；自动播放; fullscreen; picture-in-picture&quot;>;&lt;/iframe>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;p >;Dan Tapster grew up watching David Attenborough&#39;s nature documentaries with his mother, in a village outside London. “It was appointment viewing,” he said. “She still claims to be Attenborough&#39;s No. 1 fan.” A few years after graduating from university with a biology degree, and following a stint leading nature tours in Peru, Tapster found himself working on Attenborough&#39;s films, first “The Life of Mammals” and later “Planet Earth.” Attenborough&#39;s documentaries are celebrated for their exceptional footage, often of little-known species or of rarely filmed behaviors: the kodkod of Patagonia, the swarming of red-billed queleas over the African savannah, the dark-of-night hunts (captured with infrared cameras) of big cats. In a sense, viewers get to see what they cannot actually see.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Once, Tapster and a colleague were filming pygmy marmosets (palm-size monkeys with lion-like manes) in the rain forests of Ecuador when they were kidnapped by a group of Huaorani women, who thought they&#39;d be a valuable bargaining tool in their conflict with the local government. “It sounds so dramatic, but then the story gets less exciting, because they were very nice, and fed us and gave us a comfortable place to sleep,” Tapster told me. Nonetheless, after a couple of days the two men fled by canoe at night, paddling to a nearby town. But now they faced another problem: until they could get transportation out, two days later, they had nothing to do. “I tried to read the one book I had as slowly as possible,” Tapster said. Then he decided to flip a coin a thousand times and record the outcomes, to see if it was in fact true that the coin would land on heads half the time. “It was four hundred and ninety-nine,” he said, recalling that he was devastated that it wasn&#39;t five hundred. That level of devotion to verification has served him well in the making of “Life on Our Planet,” an eight-episode Netflix documentary, for which Tapster, forty-seven, is a writer and a showrunner.&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;This drive to verify is essential, because “Life on Our Planet” spans four billion years and includes sixty-five extinct creatures. It is perhaps the most ambitious nature documentary ever made. Extraordinary footage of animals living today reveals, through persistent traits, the way the past is still present; long-lost creatures are rendered with such accuracy and vividness that they have never seemed more alive. The extinct creatures, made using CGI, are placed in footage of contemporary landscapes. “Paleobotanically, it&#39;s pretty accurate,” Tom Fletcher, a paleontologist from Bristol, England, and the senior scientific researcher for the show, told me. In choosing sites to film, “our biggest problem was grass,” Fletcher said. Though grass has been around since the late Cretaceous period, it&#39;s only been widespread for about twenty-five million years. Ferns, conifers—those were sufficiently ancient.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Fletcher was tasked with putting together a fact file for every extinct creature, one that detailed what is known about each species, inside and out, and its behavior, so that artists at Industrial Light &amp;amp; Magic, the visual-effects company founded by George Lucas in 1975, could bring them to life. Some of the CGI dinosaurs&#39; steps follow the precise pattern of documented trackways (also known as dinosaur footprints). Biomechanical studies offer persuasive estimates of bite force, fossilized feces give evidence of ancient diets, and cross-sections of fossilized bone suggest how slowly or quickly an animal grew. From the assembled clues, the ILM artists imagined into being Plateosauruses and woolly mammoths and Theosodons.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Animals and plants alive today, especially those which in some way embody key moments in the story of life—the advent of flight, or of flowering, or of caring for one&#39;s young—are also seen in new ways. (There&#39;s never-before-recorded footage of how “nurse” Megaponera ants take care of injured ants by applying a liquid from their bodies that contains antibiotics.) This mixture of extinct and living creatures poses an aesthetic problem: the Megacerops and gorgonopsids and two-metre-long millipedes need to appear as realistic as present-day dragonflies, snow leopards, and hummingbirds. Visual effects can make Spider-Man and Iron Man appear to battle Thanos, but the challenge of accuracy shifts when the conjured creatures once really lived. Some of the vivid colors of species we know—flamingos, giraffes—wouldn&#39;t seem plausible in an extinct animal. Tapster said, “We tried slow-motion footage of an Allosaurus running at you, to make it terrifying”—a familiar move in footage of predators such as cheetahs. “But it was more credible in real time.”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;0hxp6&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;A trope in narrating the lives of artists is their art being so good that it can&#39;t be distinguished from nature. The fifth-century-BCE Greek painter Zeuxis is said to have painted grapes that were so realistic that birds came down to peck at them. A lamb painted by Titian was said to have prompted the bleating of a mother ewe; after Titian completed his portrait of Pope Leo X, a cardinal supposedly tried to hand the figure a pen, to sign a document. When watching “Life on Our Planet,” I experienced that idea from the other side: the filmed footage of Komodo dragons hunting their own young appeared more fantastical to me than the CGI footage of a Dunkleosteus—a predatory fish of the late Devonian period that was among the first to evolve a jaw—hunting an ammonite, an ancient hard-shelled little creature. “Life on Our Planet” does as much to reveal the extraordinary and alien nature of the animals we currently share the world with as it does to make familiar the extinct ones. These upside-down moments make extinction itself more vivid, more legible. Morgan Freeman, the series&#39; narrator, tells viewers early on that ninety-nine per cent of all species that have ever lived are now extinct—a fact whose contours are unfathomable. The story of life, one begins to realize, is also the story of five mass extinctions, and of the scrappy return of a fraction of the Earth&#39;s life-forms following each one.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Dreaming up a beast from fossil clues is not a new practice. You&#39;re out on a walk in 1600, or 600, or earlier. You come across an enormous skull, with a large hole in front. What could it be? Some scholars hypothesize that the Cyclops&#39; single eye, as described in the Odyssey, was inspired by the skull of a Deinotherium, a long-extinct creature with a trunk like an elephant&#39;s that emerged from an opening in the front of its skull.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In the seventeenth century, Robert Plot, a naturalist and the first keeper of the Ashmolean Museum, at Oxford, described a fossil from Switzerland as appearing to be the thigh bone of a very large creature—perhaps, he speculated, one of the elephants that Romans rode when they conquered Britannia. Almost a hundred years later, Richard Brookes, an English physician, reconsidered Plot&#39;s detailed drawing of the fossil and gave it a scientific name that matched what he believed it was: &lt;em>;Scrotum humanum&lt;/em>;, the scrotum of a giant human-like creature. Decades after that, William Buckland, a naturalist, looked at the fossil and other bones found in the area and concluded that they were more likely from a giant lizard, which he named Megalosaurus—a name that is still in use today.&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot;

If we want to know about the life that is no longer with us, fossils are the clues. “That&#39;s why paleontology is the best—it&#39;s the ultimate cold case.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;In the Western world, until the eighteenth century fossils were generally thought to belong to animals that still existed—just elsewhere. Thomas Jefferson, who was nicknamed Mr. Mammoth for his interest in fossils, instructed Lewis and Clark to keep an eye out for mastodons on their journey to the Pacific. This idea soon shifted, however. In 1808, the French anatomist Georges Cuvier was shown the fossilized remains of a forty-foot-long sea monster which had been found deep in a chalk quarry in Holland; he argued that it was a creature no longer living anywhere on Earth. Extinction was a wild idea for Europeans and Americans, the Great Flood notwithstanding.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;In the United States, the late-nineteenth-century “bone wars” gave paleontology the reputation of being a bit of a yahoo sport, with rich and richer men competing to acquire more fossils and name more creatures. Paleontology came to be seen as, well, a bit childish; perhaps relatedly, dinosaurs were often seen as dim and lumbering reptiles. But we owe much of our understanding of not just extinct animals but the history of the Earth to paleontology. Many paleontologists today date the “dinosaur renaissance” to John Ostrom, of Yale, who in a 1963 paper argued that hadrosaurs ran quickly and upright, and whose subsequent finding of a Deinonychus (“terrible claw”) fossil, in 1964, led him to assert that this large-brained dinosaur had been agile, smart, and a pack hunter; research by his student Robert Bakker strengthened nascent ideas that dinosaurs had been plausibly warm-blooded, and more like modern birds than like reptiles. Soon, the US went from having around a dozen paleontologists to having thousands. In the past few decades, paleontology has arguably advanced as dramatically as biotech or cat memes. One large step forward came in the nineteen-eighties, when the geologist Walter Alvarez and his father, the physicist Luis Alvarez, put forth the idea that an asteroid strike had caused the death of the majority of non-avian dinosaurs. Even that now basic-seeming idea is younger than Laura Dern, who played a paleobotanist in “Jurassic Park.”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;7vma1&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;A field that was once mostly men in hats going on digs in the Black Hills or Hell Creek is now one that combines geology, botany, chemistry, and biomechanical engineering. The slow-witted yet still somehow terrifying dinosaurs of yesteryear are gone, and it&#39;s now not necessarily even dinosaurs that paleontologists study—there are so many other creatures, though the term “dinosaur” tends to be used by the public to mean most anything ancient, strange, or frightening.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The shifting story of the Oviraptor captures something of the changes in paleontology. In 1923, an expedition to the Gobi Desert discovered dinosaur eggs, which were presumed to have belonged to Protoceratops, as there were many Protoceratops fossils nearby. A seemingly different species was found on top of a clutch of eggs, and was named Oviraptor—the egg stealer. It appeared to be a fossilized crime scene. In 1993, scientists were again searching for fossils in the Gobi when they found a similar egg, this one with a preserved embryo inside—that of an Oviraptor. The egg stealer was in fact a protective, nesting parent.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I went with my daughter to the American Museum of Natural History to see the titanosaur exhibit, which opened in 2016. The titanosaur is a hundred and twenty-two feet long, and when it was first mounted at the museum its discovery was so new that it hadn&#39;t yet been formally named. It was posed impishly, with part of its long neck and its head peeking beyond the entrance of the display hall. Museums are where most people first encounter a three-dimensional fossilized dinosaur skeleton, or a cast or a replica of one, and museum displays, across the decades, themselves become museum pieces illustrating how the story of ancient history used to be told.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In 1915, the American Museum of Natural History mounted specimen AMNH 5027, a ferocious-looking dinosaur. About forty-five per cent of its skeleton had been found, including a marvellously intact skull. The missing parts were constructed using educated guesses, based on known relatives. (A lot of dinosaurs, even today, are known from only one specimen, or two or three partial skeletons.) Henry Fairfield Osborn, then the president of the museum, had named the specimen &lt;em>;Tyrannosaurus rex&lt;/em>;, the tyrant lizard king. (The &lt;em>;Times&lt;/em>;, reporting on the fossil&#39;s discovery, wrote that it was more than eight million years old; the Los Angeles &lt;em>;Times&lt;/em>; said that the specimen was three million years old; it is estimated today to be sixty-six to sixty-nine million years old.) Osborn thought that the animal was pretty athletic, and he wanted to mount it in a dynamic way, showing two &lt;em>;T. rexes&lt;/em>; in a standoff over a fallen hadrosaur. But the pose was too much of an engineering challenge—it would have required numerous metal girders. Osborn then wanted the &lt;em>;T. rex&lt;/em>; to be as tall as possible, twenty feet high—but there was a beam in the way. Eventually, the &lt;em>;T. rex&lt;/em>; stood eighteen feet high, posed in that classic tail-down upright stance of our collective dinosaur imagination. It was the first dinosaur-fossil display of its kind, and for many years the only one, and it was seen by millions of people a year.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;gwxtok&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;The original mount had three claws on each of those curiously short front arms; when paleontologists concluded that the &lt;em>;T. rex&lt;/em>; had only two claws, one was plucked off each arm. In the early nineteen-nineties, more changes were made. The pose was altered. Its head and neck were lowered, so that it now looks more like a magnificent, giant, running chicken. Today, the &lt;em>;T. rex&lt;/em>; stands only twelve feet above the ground at its highest point.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;By one estimate, a new extinct species is discovered nearly every week. In part out of nostalgia for elementary-school trips to what was nicknamed the “dinosaur museum”—now the Sam Noble Museum of Natural History, in Norman, Oklahoma—I called up a curator, Jacqueline Lungmus. She thought that she would become a veterinarian until, she said, “I realized I didn&#39;t like soft-tissue anatomy.” She is part of the new generation of paleontologists; she received her Ph.D. from the University of Chicago in 2020. She said that, in her eyes, a superbloom in paleontological knowledge occurred “in the nineties, with histology, the study of microscopic tissue.” By cutting open bones and looking at them through a microscope, scientists “could figure out how fast-growing a creature was, how long-living it was,” she said. “This revolutionized how we thought about their life histories.” The rapid growth of dinosaurs suggested that they were warm-blooded, because cold-blooded reptiles necessarily grow more slowly. Though there is a long history of connecting birds to dinosaurs, the link only recently began to be seen as scientific fact (by most experts), and to make its way into the popular imagination.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The paleontologist Gregory Erickson, a professor at Florida State University, tells the thousands of students in his course Living with Dinosaurs: The Rise, Reign, and “Demise” of the Fearfully Great Reptiles to recognize that they live in Jurassic Park, with eleven thousand species of dinosaurs—birds—around them. “I think we looked at them as dead animals for a long time, but now see them as formerly living animals,” Erickson said, of dinosaurs. With that shift in perspective comes more interest in behavior. As an example, he spoke about how some dinosaurs are now understood to most likely have been “gregarious”—a term that refers to living in social groups. “We&#39;ll find cases where we have trackways of sometimes hundreds of skeletons that died at the same time,” Erickson said. Reptiles are rarely gregarious; birds almost always are. “You don&#39;t see, like, two hundred lizards crossing the street.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Most of us have few ideas about what a Dunkleosteus or a gorgonopsid or a terror bird might have looked like, or of how they might have behaved—but paleontologists now have plenty. Early in the making of “Life on Our Planet,” while thinking about how to depict animals whose appearances and behaviors would have to be deduced from an increasing but still mysterious set of fossil clues, the creators invited scientific consultants from Yale, Bristol University, and the University of London to the London office of ILM “We started with &#39;King Kong,&#39; ”—in which the protagonist fights a &lt;em>;T. rex&lt;/em>;—“and went on forward, through to &#39;Jurassic Park,&#39; to &#39;Walking with Dinosaurs,&#39; ” Tapster said. The experts were asked to share what they thought about the different depictions of dinosaurs. I asked if the scientists liked any of them. Tapster laughed: “Mostly it was no, no, no.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Even within the scientific community, there are often profound disagreements about how to interpret the fossil record. &lt;em>;T. rex&lt;/em>;, one of the dinosaurs about which the most is known, is a great example of this. Some scientists say that it moved like a roadrunner from Hell (a moniker first used by Robert Bakker), but others argue that &lt;em>;T. rex&#39;s&lt;/em>; legs would not have been able to bear the body&#39;s enormous weight while running. Some say &lt;em>;T. rex&lt;/em>; was mostly a hunter, and others assure you that it was really a scavenger. Some say that the king of the dinosaurs was covered with feathers, and others that only the young had feathers, or that, among adults, probably only the males had a few decorative feathers. My generation, for the most part, can&#39;t picture &lt;em>;T. rex&lt;/em>; with any feathers at all. “One thing I learned at that conference was the damned-if-you-do, damned-if-you-don&#39;t concept,” Tapster said. Among the few details that the scientists agreed on was that dinosaurs shouldn&#39;t look “shrink-wrapped.” Tapster explained, “Dinosaurs in films are often very muscly, as if they&#39;ve just come from the gym. Except for human bodybuilders, animals don&#39;t look like that.” Fletcher, the scientific consultant, said, “We decided the &lt;em>;T. rexes&lt;/em>; needed to be . 。 。 hefty. To have those chunky legs.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;How do you tell a story that spans four billion years? Estimating that there are eight million or so species alive today, and nearly a hundred times more across time, and also the companion stories of the evolution of plants, and eight episodes, each of them less than an hour—the math just gets silly. “We had two geologists in the basement—they really were in the basement—giving us information about the planet&#39;s history,” Tapster said. Then the writers had to solve the challenge of making unfathomable scales of time and change feel intelligible, at least a bit. “We used Post-it notes in five different colors,” Tapster said. “I know . 。 。 Post-it notes.” One color for prehistoric creatures with an important story to tell—learning to swim, or eggs that can survive out of water. Another color for prehistoric creatures that are iconic—viewers need their dinosaurs. A third for modern-day animals in which exceptional evolutionary traits are apparent. A fourth for key events on Earth. And a fifth for potential cliffhanger moments. Then the team would discuss what would be included and what wouldn&#39;t make the cut.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Tapster said, “One of our researchers, Ida-May Jones, kept pushing for Lystrosaurus,” a proto-mammal that she found very cute. “We were, like, It has to be more than just cute.” The Lystrosaurus was herbivorous, about the size of a pig, with small tusks and a kind of beak. Because its front legs are so much stronger than its back legs, it is believed to have dug and lived in burrows. It existed both before the Permian extinction (in relatively small numbers) and then also after—it survived. “She brought it up again, she had really fallen for it, but what essential story was it telling?” Tapster said. Then Jones uncovered an unexpected detail about Lystrosaurus: at one point, after the Permian extinction, the species represented seventy-five per cent of all the vertebrates on Earth. It was, briefly, king. “So Lystrosaurus made it in,” Tapster said. A startled Lystrosaurus in its burrow appears early in Episode 4.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Tapster and his writing team also wanted the show to highlight less well-known aspects of the history of life on Earth: creatures other than dinosaurs, the mesmerizing progression of plant life, momentous environmental events. “I remember getting the note of &#39;So you&#39;re beginning Episode 2 with plankton? And Episode 3 with lichen?&#39; ” Tapster said. But who knew (other than paleontologists) that there was a time in Earth&#39;s history when it rained for a million years? Or about the forty million years when moss dominated the planet? Or about how plankton, by inventing photosynthesis and thereby giving off oxygen in the course of some two billion years, transformed Earth&#39;s yellow methane-filled atmosphere into blue skies, and the lifeless landscape into forests of green? In William Steig&#39;s book “Rotten Island,” illustrations show erupting volcanoes and creepy sea creatures and thorny plants and vicious land animals. One day, a jealous battle starts over a new life-form: a flower. Violence, destruction, giant insects, and ice and fire ensue, and lead to a mass extinction. I used to think that “Rotten Island” was about the disastrous pettiness of human wants and behaviors, and about how much better life might be without us. Now I see it as a reasonably accurate visual history of our planet, with extra polka dots and stripes, in watercolor.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Even if you haven&#39;t visited it in person, there&#39;s a good chance you&#39;ve seen Cheatham Grove. An ecological park in Northern California, it&#39;s where the famous chase scene in “Return of the Jedi” was filmed. Walking a few minutes with Tapster and Fletcher along a trail strewn with redwood needles, and sheltered by trees several hundred feet tall, I met Jonathan Privett, the visual-effects supervisor from Industrial Light &amp;amp; Magic; Jolyon Sutcliffe, a producer and a director with an extensive background in natural-history documentaries; and Katy Fraser, a camera operator whose additional skills as a deep-sea diver were essential for many of “Life on Our Planet” &#39;s underwater scenes. They were snacking on grapes and chatting while waiting for the sun to come out from behind the clouds, so that they could shoot footage that would match that of previous days. “Nature documentary is often hours and hours of waiting and then a few moments of intensity,” Sutcliffe told me. He had stayed up for many nights in the Sonoran Desert to capture the moment when a kangaroo rat leaps out to karate kick an attacking rattlesnake in midair; he had sat for hours waiting for the tiny scuffle of dust that signifies a trapdoor spider popping out from its burrow to seize its prey. During the pandemic, he spent weeks filming lichen growing; thousands of those images had to be “stacked” for the sequence in “Life on Our Planet” that shows lichen spreading across the land.&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;a data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/11/13/dinosaurs-life-on-earth-netflix-series&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/11/13/dinosaurs-life-on-earth-netflix-series&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;“How about if tonight you pretend to be someone else I need to practice my social skills.”&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/65454231706f085d0e21bd24/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/231113_a27085.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/65454231706f085d0e21bd24/master/w_120,c_limit/231113_a27085.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/65454231706f085d0e21bd24/master/w_240,c_limit/231113_a27085.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/65454231706f085d0e21bd24/master/w_320,c_limit/231113_a27085.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/65454231706f085d0e21bd24/master/w_640,c_limit/231113_a27085.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/65454231706f085d0e21bd24/master/w_960,c_limit/231113_a27085.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/65454231706f085d0e21bd24/master/w_1280,c_limit/231113_a27085.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/65454231706f085d0e21bd24/master/w_1600,c_limit/231113_a27085.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/a>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;“How about if tonight you pretend to be someone else?

The audience never sees the skeleton, but, if you get that right, a lot follows.” The skeleton could be animated, “and, see, we realized the wings couldn&#39;t fold completely away, like a pigeon&#39;s”—so Anchiornis, with his wings only partially tucked in, looks a bit like he&#39;s wearing a cape. “And then we can add the muscles, then the skin—it&#39;s like a sculpture.” Some remarkably intact Anchiornis specimens have been found, so there&#39;s a lot of information to work with. “Then we add the feathers.” In recent years, scientists have even deduced the color of the species&#39; feathers, by a microscopic examination of melanosomes, a kind of pigment cell. Parameters can be put in for how stiff the various feathers are, and for how many barbs they have. “It&#39;s the same with fur—you can decide how clumpy it is,” he added. Wind and turbulence variables can be added, too. Privett went on, “He doesn&#39;t fly so much. It&#39;s more like what Buzz Lightyear says: he falls with style. He&#39;s sort of part bird, part flying squirrel.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Privett&#39;s background is in mechanical engineering. After graduating from college, in 1991, he took a job in Detroit modelling cars with software that was new at the time. The software allowed car designers to work digitally, instead of having to build a model by hand. Soon, Privett was offered a position at a visual-effects company, and he has spent more than twenty years doing work he would never have foreseen, and that he loves. “This is kind of embarrassing, but I was never a fiction person—I read the dictionary and the encyclopedia,” he told me. The scientific information that went into building creatures naturally appealed to him, even though “it&#39;s a leap of faith, too,” he said. Fur and feathers are the toughest. “The snow blowing through the woolly mammoth&#39;s fur—that was a lot of work,” he said, with a little shudder.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Tom Fletcher&#39;s Ph.D. was on the hydrodynamics of ancient fish and sharks, and he lights up when talking about geologic formations, fossilized skin impressions, the movement patterns of early amphibians. In becoming a paleontologist, Fletcher, who&#39;s thirty-six, didn&#39;t so much follow his dreams as follow his fears. “The room of dioramas of dinosaurs in the natural-history museum in Liverpool—they&#39;re outdated now, but it looked like a sinister aquarium with ichthyosaurs and giant squids, and I would have nightmares about them,” he said. “They were terrifying, but also awesome.” His parents sometimes drove him to the coast, where he searched for fossils, deciding pretty early on that that was what he wanted to do with his life.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;One of Fletcher&#39;s jobs in “Life on Our Planet” was to give feedback on each draft of extinct creatures. Once ILM artists had visuals, they would send a collection of images, almost always including one of the creature posed next to a fountain topped with a statue of Yoda which sits in front of ILM&#39;s San Francisco office. Revisions would then be suggested, to improve on both the “feel” of what Tapster and others thought would work best artistically and, for Fletcher, the scientific accuracy. A producer might want to put something “characterful” on a creature, such as a crest, and Fletcher would have to explain that, owing to fossil evidence, it wasn&#39;t possible. “Pretty much all the accuracy changes suggested we were into—but there was disappointment about having to put lips on the &lt;em>;Tyrannosaurus rex&lt;/em>;,” Tapster said. Lips are likely rare on the &lt;em>;T. rexes&lt;/em>; of the popular imagination. “But the science was pretty strong,” Fletcher said. With &lt;em>;T. rex&#39;s&lt;/em>; feathers, there was disagreement among experts about how many there would have been. An early draft of the &lt;em>;T. rex&lt;/em>; “looked like he had a mullet and was headed to a Metallica concert,” Tapster said. “We asked them to pluck some of the feathers.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;More often, Tapster said, ILM saved the show from mistaking an inexact science for an exact one—from failing to take advantage of the special insights of art. He gave the example of the terror bird, a ten-foot-tall apex predator that lived after the dinosaurs. In “Life on Our Planet,” we see one terror bird in a territorial dispute, and another as it hunts a group of cute llama-like creatures. There is limited fossil evidence of the terror bird, so in designing one the production team tried to Frankenstein it from modern-day descendants. “We said to ILM to give it the legs of a secretary bird and the beak of its closest living relative, a seriema,” a much smaller leggy bird that often sports a bright beak with a fanciful plume at its base. What resulted “looked like a giant chicken with lipstick,” Tapster said. They asked the artists to come up with a version that looked like it belonged in the sandy landscape and was suitably terrifying—as per the ambush predator&#39;s name. They “came up with something so much better,” Tapster said. The terror bird now looks more like an ostrich on steroids, but with a killer hooked beak.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;So many astounding creatures now gone! One theme across the episodes is that of the dominant species not surviving the next extinction; it tends to be the smaller, more adaptable ones that make it to the far side. Another through line is that of chance: not only how a random mutation can end up being useful to a creature&#39;s survival but also, for example, the chance arrival of the dinosaur-killing asteroid. On our drive back to San Francisco from Cheatham Grove, Tapster said, “That meteorite is thought to have been stuck in the asteroid belt, before maybe a collision kicked it out onto its thirty-five-million-year trajectory to crash into Earth.” The precise place where the asteroid hit exacerbated the calamity: it landed in an area full of gypsum, which vaporizes into sulfur, which in turn blocks sunlight. “If that journey had ended two hours earlier, or two hours later”—so that its impact was elsewhere—“that would have made a difference.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Italo Calvino&#39;s short story “The Dinosaurs,” from 1965, is narrated by a dinosaur that has survived the extinction. Feeling himself to be the last of his kind, he&#39;s lonely. He joins a community of New Ones, who don&#39;t recognize him as a dinosaur, or really know anything about dinosaurs, but who tell frightening stories about them. The New Ones&#39; fear changes to over-the-top admiration, then eventually to telling stories of dinosaurs that position them as laughable, as “terrible monsters” playing “ridiculous roles.” They use stories of dinosaurs, unknowingly, for their own shifting emotional and psychological ends. Late in the story, after a dinosaur fossil is found by the New Ones, the dinosaur sees “everything we had been and were no longer, our majesty, our faults, our ruin.” When the New Ones move on to “the idea of the Dinosaurs” as “bound to the idea of a sad end,” he gets fed up, and leaves. Calvino&#39;s story, written when the extinction of the dinosaurs was still a mystery, now reads as a parable about our own possible extinction, even as its causes are not cloaked but visible.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;We are the New Ones now, telling a shifting set of stories, often heedless of their accuracy. The dramatizations of the extinctions in “Life on Our Planet” were difficult to watch, though they were, in a way, magnificent. As sea life froze, or suffocated, or the land transformed into an oven, I admit that I often turned away, as it looked all too real. ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>; &lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/ div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;div>;&lt;div>;&lt;div>;&lt;div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt; /div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 06 Nov 2023 20:06:01 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Ridley Scott’s “Napoleon” Complex]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/11/13/ridley-scott-director-profile]]><description>&lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-06T11:00:00.000Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6544402dbadffffaeddcc66f/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/231113_r43344web.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;article >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attribute-verso-pattern=&quot;article-body&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;ArticlePageChunks&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;On the morning of the Battle of Waterloo, Napoleon Bonaparte was full of catastrophic confidence. His seventy-three thousand troops were camped on a ridge near a tavern called La Belle Alliance. His nemesis, the Duke of Wellington, occupied a slope across the fields, with a mere sixty-seven thousand troops. Over breakfast, Napoleon predicted, “If my orders are well executed, we will sleep in Brussels this evening.” When his chief of staff offered a word of caution, Napoleon snapped, “Wellington is a bad general and the English are bad troops. The whole affair will not be more serious than swallowing one&#39;s breakfast.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;He was already making mistakes. Underestimating his enemies&#39; capabilities and overestimating his own, he assumed that the woods behind the British would block their retreat, but Wellington had strategically used the forest to hide more soldiers. An overnight downpour had left the fields soggy, and Napoleon, instead of striking at nine, as he had planned, held off until midday, giving the Prussians crucial time to reach Wellington as backup. Napoleon was tired. He was ill. He was strangely apathetic, declining to survey parts of the battlefield himself. Michael Broers, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1997/11/24/napoleon-bonaparte-the-good-soldier&quot;>;Napoleon&lt;/a>; scholar at Oxford, told me, “The real question isn&#39;t so much Why did he lose? but How on earth did he ever think he could win?”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In 2020, Broers was grading a student&#39;s essay when he got a call from an assistant in Ridley Scott&#39;s office, explaining that the director was planning an epic film about Napoleon, starring Joaquin Phoenix. Summoned to Scott&#39;s headquarters, in London—crammed with movie props, it reminded Broers of Aladdin&#39;s cave—the professor advised Scott on everything from the motivations of Empress Josephine to whether Napoleon was left-handed. (He wasn&#39;t.) Scott was particularly interested in battles, from both a practical and a psychological perspective. “He saw at eye level,” Broers recalled. “His Waterloo was like a diorama.” At one point, Broers drew him a map, and the director studied it like a hardened general preparing for battle—which, in a way, he was. “He&#39;s not un-Napoleonic himself,” Broers said. “When he&#39;s there, he&#39;s in charge, and you have complete confidence in him. He dishes it out, and he can take it.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Scott, who has filmed and fought more than his share of battles, will turn eighty-six this month, a week after the release of “Napoleon,” his twenty-eighth film. His movies have tackled other Great Men of History (Moses, Columbus), as well as aliens, androids, con men, gangsters, goblins, soldiers, serial killers, and the Gucci family. He creates visceral worlds, whether the rain-streaked, mechanized dystopia of “Blade Runner” or the dusty Roman arenas of “Gladiator,” and several of his screen images—a slime-covered creature bursting out of an astronaut&#39;s chest in “Alien,” Thelma and Louise zooming off a cliff—are lodged firmly in the popular imagination. But he&#39;s tough to pin down. “Is Ridley a fine artist? Is he an art-cinema director? Is he a commercial hack? Is he all of the above?,” Paul Sammon, a writer who has published three books about Scott, said. “That&#39;s what I really enjoy about Ridley—he is unclassifiable.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The director feels the same way. “My choices tend to be random,” he told me in September. He was in the West Hollywood offices of the Ridley Scott Creative Group, a sprawling enterprise that produces features, music videos, and commercials, with outposts in Amsterdam and Hong Kong. We sat in an airy conference room, the walls of which were covered with photographs of Scott on his various sets. Like Logan Roy, the patriarch in “Succession,” he wears his authority like an old sweater, his northern English burr unsoftened by Hollywood. He&#39;s a growler, a grumbler, a barker, a chortler. His narrow eyes peer over a long, stern nose, and his resting scowl is framed by an untidy white beard, which he occasionally strokes, more in irritation than in contemplation.&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Scott regards his œuvre with pugnacious pride, especially his less loved films, such as the 2013 crime thriller “The Counselor,” which he maintains was the victim of bad marketing. (“They fucked it up.”) When a movie fails, I asked, does he question his instincts? “No,” he grunted. “I blast the shit out of a tennis ball.” Beside him was Pauline Kael&#39;s four-page &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1982/07/12/blade-runner-movie-review&quot;>;evisceration&lt;/a>; of “Blade Runner,” which ran in this magazine in 1982 and contains, among other gibes, the line “Scott seems to be trapped in his own alleyways, without a map.” Scott had the review framed for his office wall years ago and had asked an assistant to lay it on the table for me; I got the sense that he had agreed to a &lt;em>;New Yorker&lt;/em>; Profile in order to have the last laugh.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Scott was on an enforced hiatus. In July, he&#39;d been more than halfway through shooting “Gladiator 2,” on the island of Malta, when the actors&#39; strike halted production. But, unlike Napoleon during his exile on Elba, he wasn&#39;t taking salt baths and stewing. He was busy preparing an extended cut of “Napoleon” for Apple, which produced and will stream the film. He&#39;d been editing what he had of “Gladiator 2,” slated for next fall, and “reccing”—reconnoitering—locations for a Western. As he approaches ninety, Scott is not slowing down but speeding up. Tom Rothman, the head of Sony&#39;s film division, which will distribute “Napoleon” theatrically, told me, “Ridley Scott is the single best argument for a second term for Joe Biden.” Paul Biddiss, a burly British ex-paratrooper who was Scott&#39;s military adviser for “Napoleon,” recalled shooting the siege of Toulon, in Malta: “He goes, &#39;Can you touch your toes? Come on!&#39; We&#39;re in the middle of Fort Ricasoli, we&#39;re both touching toes to see who&#39;s flexible, and he was, like, &#39;You&#39;ve got to take up yoga.&#39; ”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;mbj3yl&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;While many directors are embracing a gentler, more collaborative mode of authority, Scott characterizes his style as a benevolent dictatorship. “Working with Ridley, it&#39;s very much military in some ways,” Arthur Max, his longtime production designer, told me. David Scarpa, the screenwriter of “Napoleon,” said, “The striking thing about Ridley, more than anything else, is this enormous will. You send him pages while he&#39;s shooting, he shoots twelve hours a day, he then goes out to dinner with the actors, &lt;em>;then&lt;/em>; he works on editing what he&#39;s shot that day. After that, he reads your pages, and the next day you get the e-mail from Europe, and he&#39;s storyboarded them. That would kill ninety per cent of the directors in Hollywood.”&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;One of Scotts meticulous handdrawn storyboards called Ridleygrams for the Battle of Waterloo scene.&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65443e01f9309101ece46abb/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/231113_r43360.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65443e01f9309101ece46abb/master/w_120,c_limit/231113_r43360.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65443e01f9309101ece46abb/master/w_240,c_limit/231113_r43360.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65443e01f9309101ece46abb/master/w_320,c_limit/231113_r43360.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65443e01f9309101ece46abb/master/w_640,c_limit/231113_r43360.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65443e01f9309101ece46abb/master/w_960,c_limit/231113_r43360.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65443e01f9309101ece46abb/master/w_1280,c_limit/231113_r43360.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65443e01f9309101ece46abb/master/w_1600,c_limit/231113_r43360.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;One of Scott&#39;s meticulous, hand-drawn storyboards, called Ridleygrams, for the Battle of Waterloo scene.&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Art work courtesy Ridley Scott&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;p >;Researching the script, Scarpa began noticing similarities between director and subject. “Seeing Napoleon and Ridley side by side, I think that there are people who simply don&#39;t have that internal sense of limitation that normal people have,” he said. “I remember reading about how one time Napoleon was finishing up a battle, and he was simultaneously designing the currency.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Joaquin Phoenix, like other actors who have worked with Scott, was unable to talk to me for this story because of the actors&#39; strike. But, earlier this year, he told &lt;em>;Empire&lt;/em>; magazine, “If you want to really understand Napoleon, then you should probably do your own studying and reading. Because if you see this film, it&#39;s this experience told through Ridley&#39;s eyes.” Ten days before filming, Phoenix went to Scott and said, “I&#39;m agonizing over this. I don&#39;t know how to do it.” The two spent several twelve-hour days psychoanalyzing the Emperor, scene by scene. “We found that he&#39;s a split personality,” Scott said. “He is deeply vulnerable, and while doing his job he&#39;s able to hide that under a marvellous front. His forceful personality was part of his theatre.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Napoleon has enticed filmmakers practically since movies were invented. The French director Abel Gance débuted his five-and-a-half-hour silent epic, “Napoléon,” in 1927; with its use of cameras attached to guillotines and sleds, it was a breakthrough in special effects. (“I couldn&#39;t get through it, honestly,” Scott said.) In 1970, Sergei Bondarchuk released “Waterloo,” starring Rod Steiger as a sweaty, screaming Napoleon. It was filmed on Ukrainian farmland, with seventeen thousand extras borrowed from the Soviet Army. At the time, Stanley Kubrick, hot off “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/04/23/2001-a-space-odyssey-what-it-means-and-how-it-was-made&quot;>;2001: A Space Odyssey&lt;/a>;,” was laboring over his own Napoleon project, for MGM, envisioning Jack Nicholson in the title role. “He fascinates me,” Kubrick said, of the Emperor. He devoured biographies, obsessing over minutiae. One designer quit after an argument over whether rhododendrons had been brought from India by Napoleon&#39;s time. When Kubrick&#39;s plans fell apart, he funnelled his period research into “Barry Lyndon,” which in turn inspired Scott&#39;s first film, “The Duellists,” in 1977, about a pair of rival officers during the Napoleonic Wars. Years after Kubrick&#39;s death, Scott was sent his unused Napoleon script. Scott found it underwhelming, in part because it spanned “birth to death,” he said. (Steven Spielberg is currently developing the Kubrick project as an HBO series.)&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Scott became interested in Napoleon about fifteen years ago, when he happened upon a &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Assassination-St-Helena-poisoning-Bonaparte/dp/0888360282&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Assassination-St-Helena-poisoning-Bonaparte/dp/0888360282&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Assassination-St-Helena-poisoning-Bonaparte/dp/0888360282&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;book&lt;/a>; by Sten Forshufvud, a Swedish dental surgeon, who, in 1961, tested Napoleon&#39;s hair for arsenic and theorized that he had been poisoned. (Broers, the Oxford historian, is doubtful. “Forshufvud forgot something—everyone was a bit &#39;arsenic poisoned&#39; in those days,” he said. “Wallpaper and many other things were made with levels of it that would be banned today.”) Scott started thinking about Napoleon&#39;s final exile, on St. Helena. He was intrigued by his friendship with a young girl who liked to play with the Emperor&#39;s sword and hat. “He would sit there and watch her hacking away at a tree,” Scott said. “She had no idea who he was, other than a prisoner of war.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Unlike Kubrick, Scott wasn&#39;t big on biographies. He gave up after two or three books and ordered Scarpa, his screenwriter, to bone up. “One of the questions I found myself asking is Where am I supposed to come down on this guy?” Scarpa said. “In history, we tend to sort characters into heroes or villains. You&#39;re either Martin Luther King or you&#39;re Adolf Hitler.” He was curious about Napoleon&#39;s marriage to Josephine, who carried on a flagrant affair with a Hussar in her husband&#39;s Army. “What stuck was Napoleon&#39;s seeming ineptitude with women,” Scarpa explained. “His attachment to Josephine over the course of his entire life, but also the bizarre disconnect in a guy who is able to kill eighty thousand people on a battlefield in Eastern Europe, almost as a sporting event, and yet, to him, it simply wouldn&#39;t be sporting to deal with his rival for his wife&#39;s affections.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The angle appealed to Scott. “Who was this person, and why was he vulnerable?”他问。 “And it was this woman called Josephine.” He cast Jodie Comer, who had starred in his 2021 film “The Last Duel,” but two months before filming she had to drop out and was replaced by Vanessa Kirby.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Scott has described the “environment” as a character in all his films, and critics have accused him of prioritizing spectacle over substance. “I tend to be visual above all things, before the written word,” he said. He is fond of the adage “A picture is worth a thousand words,” which he attributes to Hitchcock. (In fact, it dates back at least to a speech in 1911 by the newspaper editor Arthur Brisbane.) His hand-drawn storyboards, known as Ridleygrams, are his method of thinking and communicating. His older son, Jake, recalled going on a family vacation in France when he and his brother were children: “He had us illustrate the holiday, and he wrote the text.

For a sequence with the ten plagues, Luke was tasked with filming vultures landing on a statue. When it was done, he recalled, “I think, All good, pretty good shots of vultures. And then I get a phone call: &#39;What the fuck was that?&#39; He says, &#39;The top of the statue has to be covered in bones, detritus, all of that!&#39; ” Luke called the vultures back and reshot the scene with the jetsam of pestilence. “I was misreading the storyboard,” he said.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;mianxm&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Scott&#39;s closest collaborators are trained to anticipate his aesthetic preferences. Arthur Max, the production designer, named a few: “Smoke. Thick, crusty, shiny, black, thick paint. Heavy aging. Filth. Dirt. Textures of all kinds. Shiny glass mirrors. Chrome. Metallic, silky fabrics. Corrosion. Small, fine, delicate mechanisms.” Janty Yates, his costume designer, avoids fluorescent fabrics for his films. “He prefers rich jewel colors,” she told me. “He loves gold trim, but old gold. He loves shadow. He really doesn&#39;t like green—and then suddenly he&#39;ll like green. He&#39;s quite a hummingbird.” On “The Martian,” he surprised her by requesting a “pop of orange.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;In his LA office, Scott had an assistant bring in a bound copy of his “Napoleon” storyboards, which looked like a comic-strip biography. He flipped through: the Battle of Austerlitz, in which Napoleon lures the Russians onto a frozen pond; a cut scene of Napoleon and Josephine discussing politics in a bathtub; the Fire of Moscow, in 1812. (“It burned like a son of a bitch.”) “This is now the day of Waterloo,” Scott said, pointing at a page. Originally, he had planned to show Napoleon on the toilet, noticing blood; he&#39;d read that the Emperor suffered from hemorrhoids, which were common to equestrians. (It&#39;s possible that he actually had stomach cancer.) “As I got close to the release, I thought, I haven&#39;t got the courage,” he said, and he cut the toilet scene. He turned to a drawing of Wellington in gray, asking a scout when the Prussians would arrive. A scribbled note read, “Does NB have similar intel?”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;To play the role of Waterloo, Scott&#39;s team scouted dozens of fields in England—“tromping around in Wellington boots in muddy fields, avoiding cowpats,” Max recalled—before settling on a farm in Berkshire. The production set up a “war room” in Brentford, a London suburb, with three-dimensional models of the terrain. Biddiss, the ex-paratrooper, ran five hundred extras through “boot camp” at the Cavalry Barracks in Hounslow, which were built in Napoleon&#39;s era. He assessed the extras to make sure they were “physically and mentally robust” and put the best three hundred up front. (CGI multiplied them into the thousands.) Biddiss had studied old military manuals and showed the extras how the French and the English loaded their muskets in different ways. Scott is less of a stickler. When the trailer came out, the TV historian Dan Snow posted a TikTok breakdown of its inaccuracies. (At the Battle of the Pyramids, “Napoleon didn&#39;t shoot at the pyramids”; Marie-Antoinette “famously had very cropped hair for the execution, and, hey, Napoleon wasn&#39;t there.”) Scott&#39;s response: “Get a life.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Waterloo was shot in the course of five days, with eleven cameras rolling. “It was quite blustery,” Max recalled. “I knew Ridley would like it, because he is very visceral about the elements. If he got an earthquake, he&#39;d find a way to use it.” Biddiss told me, “Uniformity is very important with Ridley—right down to the guys, making sure their hats are straight. There wasn&#39;t a bayonet that was out of synch.” The most complicated maneuver was forming human squares, with bayonets pointed outward—an infantry formation that the British used to scare off the Frenchmen&#39;s horses. “I had some sleepless nights, because I wanted to make sure that those guys did this square perfectly,” Biddiss said. On the day, “they pulled it off brilliantly. I could hear Ridley on the radio—&#39;Buy those boys a pint!&#39; ”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Scott calls himself a war baby, though he was born in 1937, two years before England entered the Second World War. The Scotts lived in South Shields, on the northeast coast. “When the air-raid warnings sounded off, my father was in London already as an officer,” Scott recalled. “My mother would hustle us under the stairs, and we&#39;d sit drinking cocoa, singing &#39;Old MacDonald Had a Farm&#39; while bombs came down around us.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;His father, Francis Percy Scott, had been a clerk in a shipping office, but the war was good to him. Despite his Geordie accent, he rose up the ranks to brigadier general overseeing civil engineering; according to Ridley, he received letters from Winston Churchill, thanking him for his input on D Day. After the war, Francis was asked to help rebuild Germany&#39;s infrastructure. He moved his wife and sons—Ridley, his older brother, Frank, and his younger brother, Tony—to a sumptuous house in Hamburg. In 1952, Francis was offered a prestigious role leading the Port Authority for the Elbe and the Rhine. (Scott said, “That&#39;s like being offered the St. Lawrence &lt;em>;and&lt;/em>; the Hudson!”) But Ridley&#39;s mother, Elizabeth, wanted to be near her relatives in England. Ridley remembers speaking up, saying, “Take the job!” and getting a thwack. They returned to England and lived in modest state housing. He said, “Already I was learning how life changes so quickly, you know?”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;pho1l9&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Despite Scott&#39;s machismo, he is known for populating his films with strong women: Sigourney Weaver&#39;s Ellen Ripley, in “Alien,” one of Hollywood&#39;s first female action heroes; Thelma and Louise; GI Jane; Lady Gaga&#39;s vengeful Patrizia Reggiani, in “House of Gucci”; even the sledgehammer-wielding rebel in his “1984” commercial for Apple. Sigourney Weaver credits Scott with the longevity of Ripley and “Alien.” Earlier this year, she told &lt;em>;Total Film&lt;/em>;, “They made Ripley a woman, without making her this helpless creature.” In &lt;em>;AnOther&lt;/em>; magazine, she recalled, “I&#39;d been put in a baby-blue space costume, and Ridley took one look at me and said, &#39;You look like fucking Jackie O. in space!&#39; ” He put her in an old &lt;em >;NASA&lt;/em>; flight suit instead. “Ripley is not a sexy space babe,” Weaver said. “I never worried how I looked, I worried about getting down the corridors fast enough to escape the explosions!”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Scott is not one to expound on gender roles. When asked about his predilection, he responds vaguely, as he did in 1998, speaking to Sammon: “I&#39;m drawn to strong, intelligent women in real life. Why shouldn&#39;t the films reflect that?” When I raised the subject with his son Jake, he replied, “I can tell you where that comes from—my grandmother.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“I shouldn&#39;t say this,” Scott told me, “but my mother was the man of the house. My mother insisted she was five feet—she was four foot eleven. And she was ferocious. My dad was a real gentleman. He was a sweetheart, a nice man, who took more than he should have from my mum.” Elizabeth, he recalled, “would take a belt or a stick to us.” She never worked outside the home, although, in the seventies, she offered to be a receptionist at Scott&#39;s commercial-production company. (“I didn&#39;t want to say it, but she&#39;d scare away more clients than she&#39;d bring in.”) Elizabeth lost her brother and four sisters to cancer, then lived until ninety-six. “She was formidable,” Scott said. “Her famous words to me before she died were &#39;This is ridiculous.&#39; ”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I asked Jake which of his father&#39;s characters most resembled Elizabeth. He laughed and said, “Mother, in &#39;Alien.&#39; ” Mother, or &lt;em >;MU/TH/UR&lt;/em>; 6000, is the spaceship&#39;s computer system, Scott&#39;s answer to Kubrick&#39;s &lt;em >;HAL&lt;/em>; 9000, from “2001.” At the end of “Alien,” she counts down to self-destruction in a firm, matronly voice. (The voice actress, Helen Horton, was in her fifties.) Jake said, “Even &#39;Napoleon&#39; begins with a defiant Marie-Antoinette at the guillotine, which is a sort of punk image.” Then he thought of another film, “A Good Year,” which features the actress Archie Panjabi as a hard-charging executive assistant. “That&#39;s another Grandma,” he said. “Do you know what? There&#39;s Grandmas in his films. They&#39;re here, there, and everywhere.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Does Scott see his mother in his heroines? “No, no,” he told me. “But I learned to give as good as I take. She&#39;d say, &#39;Don&#39;t you talk to me like that.&#39; And I&#39;d say, &#39;Don&#39;t you talk to me like that.&#39; ” In “Napoleon,” Josephine is the only person who seems unimpressed by her husband&#39;s conquests. In a particularly strong scene, he confronts her about her philandering, demanding that she say, “Without you, I am nothing.” Later, as they sit by a fire, she makes him say the same to her, reducing the Emperor of France to a whimperer. “By forgiving her, it in a way is both generous and a weakness,” Scott said. Later, his son Luke talked about how Elizabeth ruled over Ridley and his brother Tony. “The only person in the world who could tell them to shut up and get in line was her,” he said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Scott was a terrible student, but by the age of nine he&#39;d discovered two passions: smoking and painting. At seventeen, having flunked all his exams except art, he decided to enlist in the National Service; his older brother, Frank, had joined the British Merchant Navy. “You&#39;ve got nothing to learn from the Army,” Ridley&#39;s father advised him. “You should go to art school.” He enrolled in a local program, in West Hartlepool, an industrial seaside town. He&#39;d walk the beaches by the steelworks, watching “towers belching filth and junk,” he said. “It&#39;s a wonder I&#39;ve still got a pair of lungs.” Years later, he drew on those polluted skies while envisioning the dystopian Los Angeles of “Blade Runner.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;He went on to the Royal College of Art, in London. His classmates included David Hockney, whom he remembers getting bored in a life-drawing class and sketching a skeleton in the corner instead. The school had no filmmaking program, so Scott joined the theatre-design department, where, in 1962, someone lent him a Bolex 16-mm. camera. He returned to West Hartlepool to make a short film, “Boy and Bicycle,” starring his teen-age brother, Tony, who would follow him into art school. Scott was fascinated by Joyce&#39;s “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Ulysses-James-Joyce/dp/0679722769&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Ulysses-James-Joyce/dp/0679722769&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Ulysses-James-Joyce/dp/0679722769&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;Ulysses&lt;/a>;,” with its “organically visual descriptions” of, say, a butcher laying a “moist tender gland” onto “rubber prickles.” In “Boy and Bicycle,” a freckled lad skips school and bikes through town, as we hear his inner monologue on time, the stench of the smokestacks, and death. Scott said, “The idea was, boy plays hooky for the day, thinks it&#39;s freedom.

In New York, he met fashion designers and worked for the documentarians Richard Leacock and DA Pennebaker. He was full of drive but unclear which direction it should take. Back in London, he designed sets for such BBC series as “The Dick Emery Show.” He recalled, “From designing, I&#39;d been groomed to be a senior department head, and I surprised them by saying, &#39;I don&#39;t want that.&#39; Then they surprised &lt;em>;me&lt;/em>; by saying, &#39;Would you want to do a director&#39;s course at the BBC?&#39; ” For the class, he made a “potted version” of Kubrick&#39;s war drama “Paths of Glory.” The next Monday, he was offered his first directing job, on a police procedural called “Z-Cars.”&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;Another Ridleygram this one showing the preparation of artillery and cannonballs before Waterloo.&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65453d0f6c75cd39ffde442b/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/231113_r43361_rd.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65453d0f6c75cd39ffde442b/master/w_120,c_limit/231113_r43361_rd.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65453d0f6c75cd39ffde442b/master/w_240,c_limit/231113_r43361_rd.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65453d0f6c75cd39ffde442b/master/w_320,c_limit/231113_r43361_rd.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65453d0f6c75cd39ffde442b/master/w_640,c_limit/231113_r43361_rd.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65453d0f6c75cd39ffde442b/master/w_960,c_limit/231113_r43361_rd.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65453d0f6c75cd39ffde442b/master/w_1280,c_limit/231113_r43361_rd.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65453d0f6c75cd39ffde442b/master/w_1600,c_limit/231113_r43361_rd.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;Another Ridleygram, this one showing the preparation of artillery and cannonballs before Waterloo.&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Art work courtesy Ridley Scott&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;p >;One day in the mid-sixties, a colleague asked him to cover for her at a test shoot for a Benson &amp;amp; Hedges cigarette ad in Chelsea. Freelance commercial directing was better paying and less bureaucratic than the BBC, and Scott was soon shuttling in his white Mini between the BBC&#39;s White City Place and a studio in Chelsea. Within a year, he&#39;d shot hundreds of commercials, starting with a Gerber baby-food ad, during which “the baby spattered porridge all over me,” as he recalled with a grimace. Britain&#39;s ad business was experiencing a creative revolution, with dull, market-research-driven spots giving way to mini movies that captured the buzz of Swinging London. “British advertising had been waiting for a figure like Scott for some time,” Sam Delaney writes in “Get Smashed,” his chronicle of the era. “A generation of writers and art directors had elevated the standard of creative ideas but were unable to find directors who could properly execute their scripts.”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;43sewh&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Commercials trained Scott in economical storytelling, conjuring atmosphere, delivering on time and on budget, and making lots of money doing so. He was known for infusing banal scripts with a sheen of artistry; he shot a soap-powder ad in the style of “Citizen Kane” and a toothpaste spot inspired by “Doctor Zhivago.” As competitors moved in on his turf, he realized that he could profit off his rivals and, in 1968, he founded Ridley Scott Associates, which signed up-and-coming commercial directors. When his brother Tony got out of school, dreaming of making documentaries, Ridley urged Tony&#39;s wife to dissuade him: “I said, &#39;Dear, if he does documentaries, he&#39;s going to be riding the bicycle in forty years&#39; time. Come with me, because I know he really wants a Ferrari.&#39; So Tony came with me, and, sure enough, he got a Ferrari.” With the company flourishing, the brothers earned a reputation for avarice. One industry in-joke went, “What do you get if you drop a penny between the Scott brothers? A metre of copper wire!”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In 1973, Ridley made a commercial for Hovis Bread, featuring a boy pushing a bicycle, its basket stuffed with loaves of fresh bread, through the cobblestoned streets of an English village, set to Dvořák&#39;s “New World” Symphony. It was “Boy and Bicycle,” with existential dread swapped out for nostalgic warmth. (Tagline: “As good for you today as it&#39;s always been.”) In 2006, it was voted Britain&#39;s favorite advert of all time. Both brothers were part of a wave of rock-star British ad directors, many of whom would become feature filmmakers, including Alan Parker (“Midnight Express”) and Adrian Lyne (“Fatal Attraction”). But Ridley, approaching forty, was impatient to get his movie career going. He developed a project with the Bee Gees, but they didn&#39;t want to sing on film, and the project collapsed. When Parker landed his first movie, “Bugsy Malone,” produced by the former adman David Puttnam, Scott was so envious that he couldn&#39;t sleep.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;After “Bugsy Malone” played at Cannes, in 1976, Paramount asked Puttnam if he knew anyone else like Parker. He did—Ridley Scott, who had two potential screenplays. The first, about the Gunpowder Plot of 1605, would cost $2.2 million. The second, “The Duellists,” a dark comedy based on a Joseph Conrad story about the madness of competition, would cost $1.4 million. “I&#39;ll take that one,” the Paramount executive said. After making his first film, Scott recalled, “I thought, Blimey, that was easy.” At Cannes in 1977, “The Duellists” was nominated for the Palme d&#39;Or and won the prize for the best début film.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;By then, Scott had divorced his first wife, Felicity Heywood, a painter he&#39;d met in art school and the mother of his sons. In 1979, he married the advertising executive Sandy Watson, with whom he had a daughter, Jordan. (He&#39;s now married to the actress Giannina Facio, who played the wife of Russell Crowe&#39;s character, Maximus, in “Gladiator.”) All three children have become filmmakers, and all are partners in the family business. I mentioned the “Succession” vibes at the company to Jake. He laughed and replied, “It&#39;s been said.” A few years ago, he was at a restaurant in London when Brian Cox, who played Logan Roy, walked in. “My friend was, like, &#39;Oh, your dad&#39;s here!&#39; ”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;q3glcs&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;The three children were raised by Watson, and when they were young Scott was subsumed with work, spending evenings laboring over his Ridleygrams. In the seventies, the family lived in a mock-Tudor town house on Wimbledon Common, which Ridley designed with the exactitude he devoted to his sets. Jake recalled a conservatory with a checkered floor and a kitchen with no right angles. Both boys appeared in their father&#39;s and uncle&#39;s commercials; Luke remembered stuffing his mouth with Cadbury chocolate. In “The Duellists,” they play aristocratic boys in breeches and pageboy haircuts, and Jake asks a character played by Keith Carradine if he&#39;s ever talked to Napoleon.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;The boys saw less of their father as he made trips to Hollywood to drum up films. He developed an idea about Tristan and Isolde, but that fizzled in May, 1977, when Puttnam brought him to see “Star Wars” at Mann&#39;s Chinese Theatre. “It was beyond a crazy football crowd,” Scott recalled. He hadn&#39;t been much interested in science fiction but was seized with a need to top George Lucas. “I couldn&#39;t sleep for a week. I said to David, &#39;Listen, I don&#39;t know why I&#39;m doing Tristan and Isolde.&#39; He said, &#39;Think of something else.&#39; ”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;So he did “Alien.” Scott was engrossed with how it would look. He wanted the spaceship to feel claustrophobic, arguing a producer into lowering the ceilings. He was frustrated that the audience wouldn&#39;t be able to smell the creature, which he imagined had a horrible stench. For the chest-bursting scene, he said at the time, “We wanted to do something so outrageous that no one would know it was coming.” Kubrick, whom he idolized but had never met, later called him to ask how the hell he had pulled it off. At a preview screening in Dallas, women ran to the bathroom to vomit, and an usher fainted in the aisle. Scott was thrilled.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Alien” turned Scott into a bankable studio director, but he was entering perhaps his darkest phase. In 1980, his brother Frank died, at forty-five, of melanoma. “I was going through a nervous breakdown and didn&#39;t know,” Scott told me. “I&#39;ve always been very rational, and death is irrational. It became a nightmare to go to bed, because I&#39;d walk the floor for nine hours.” He was attached to direct “Dune,” but shooting was at least two years off, and he was restless. Instead, he returned to an idea he&#39;d rejected, an adaptation of Philip K. Dick&#39;s sci-fi novel “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Androids-Dream-Electric-Sheep-inspiration-ebook/dp/B000SEGTI0&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Androids-Dream-Electric-Sheep-inspiration-ebook/dp/B000SEGTI0&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Androids-Dream-Electric-Sheep-inspiration-ebook/dp/B000SEGTI0&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?&lt;/a>;” As he sketched out the world that became “Blade Runner,” what emerged was doom: a future of endless rain, perpetual night, environmental ruin, and technology that blurred the line between human and machine to a vanishing point.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The “Blade Runner” shoot was notoriously fraught. The first day, for a scene set in a corporate ziggurat, Scott looked through the lens and saw that the building&#39;s columns had been installed upside down. Paul Sammon, who was embedded on set and chronicled the film&#39;s making in his book “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Future-Noir-Revised-Updated-Making/dp/0062699466&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Future-Noir-Revised-Updated-Making/dp/0062699466&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Future-Noir-Revised-Updated-Making/dp/0062699466&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;Future Noir&lt;/a>;,” recalled, “Within the first few weeks, I felt this radical shift in his personality. I saw him go from being fairly personable to being a screamer.” Scott was unaccustomed to American union rules, which prevented him from operating his own camera. He sat in a video-playback booth, which isolated him from his unhappy star, Harrison Ford; the two men could never agree whether Ford&#39;s character, Deckard, was a man or a “replicant.”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;vjbo97&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Midway through, the &lt;em>;Guardian&lt;/em>; ran an interview in which Scott said that he preferred British crews, because he could give them orders and they&#39;d say, “Yes, guv&#39;nor!” The crew printed up T-shirts that read “&lt;em >;YES GUV&#39;NOR MY ASS&lt;/em>;!” Scott and his British compatriots tried to quell the insurrection by wearing T-shirts reading “&lt;em >;XENOPHOBIA SUCKS&lt;/em>;.” The budget ran two million dollars over. The final days were a frenzy, with the last scene—Rutger Hauer&#39;s moody android death—shot against the last sunrise to dawn before Scott&#39;s cameras would be taken from him. In postproduction, Scott was fired—twice—but worked his way back. When preview audiences expressed confusion, Scott, against his better judgment, added a voice-over and a happy ending in which Deckard and his android paramour flee Los Angeles; Kubrick gave him helicopter footage left over from “The Shining.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Blade Runner” came out in June, 1982, two weeks after “ET,” which synched better with the sunny Reagan era than Scott&#39;s bleak dystopia did. Kael wasn&#39;t its only detractor; another critic wrote, “I suspect my blender and toaster oven would just love it.” After making six million dollars on its opening weekend, the film all but disappeared. Although it grew into a cult classic and became a touchstone for such filmmakers as Christopher Nolan and Denis Villeneuve (who directed the 2017 sequel), Scott still speaks of “Blade Runner” with an ache. Asked what it taught him, he sounded like a defiant general routed by an undeserving enemy: “I learned that the only opinion that matters, when all is said and done—even with failure in your face, and you&#39;re lying on the mat, crushed—is, What did &lt;em>;you&lt;/em>; think of it?”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Just as Napoleon had Versailles, Scott maintains his own seat of power in the French countryside: Mas des Infermières, a winery in Provence, situated in a hilly patch of the Luberon region dotted with cypress and olive trees. Scott bought the property, with eleven hectares of vines, in 1992, after he made “Thelma &amp;amp; Louise.” He was eager to tell me that it once belonged to General Baron Robert, a health officer in Napoleon&#39;s Army.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The day before I met him there, on a cloudless morning in October, his son Luke told me about the house: “It&#39;s the sacred space, the mental palace. Everything within is the construct of this person who thinks visually. You&#39;ll go, &#39;Holy shit, this place is beautiful!&#39; But it&#39;s not accidental that it&#39;s that beautiful, because it&#39;s him pitting himself against nature itself. He is Canute sitting on the shores of England, shouting at the ocean, &#39;I command you to get back!&#39; It&#39;s like all of his movies virtually encapsulated, with the waft of the curtains and the drift of the pollen and the mist.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I found Scott not in the house but in a building that he constructed on the property in 2019, with a wine cellar, a tasting kitchen, and a gift shop. The outside is faux-rustic, capped with terra-cotta roof tiles. The inside is sleekly modern, with concrete floors, a steel staircase spiralling down to the cellar, and movie memorabilia everywhere. Next to a table with wineglasses and spittoons were four spacesuits, from “The Martian,” “Prometheus,” and “Alien: Covenant.” The mise-en-scène: Cézanne meets Planet Hollywood.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Scott sipped an espresso at a café table, beside the bicycle that Adam Driver rode in “House of Gucci.” He wore a dark T-shirt, trousers, and a plastic watch the color of a traffic cone (a pop of orange). “If I come here, I find that I can sit and think and draw,” he said. He showed me a print of one of his oil paintings, of a mesa in Spain that he had spotted shooting “Exodus.” He put on a tan fedora and led me through the back door, to an expanse of fields. “This place is bloody heaven!”他说。 “My vineyard goes way across. See those cypress trees? I go beyond that.” He hadn&#39;t paid much attention to his vintner&#39;s work until his reds began winning prizes in Paris. “So far, I&#39;m just losing money like crazy, but it doesn&#39;t matter. It&#39;s a pleasure.”&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;a data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/11/13/ridley-scott-director-profile&amp;quot;}&quot;

It was filmed eight minutes away. “Russell was damaged goods—he&#39;d thrown the phone in the Mercer Hotel,” Scott recalled, referring to a tabloid incident from Crowe&#39;s post-“Gladiator” bad-boy period. “In the morning, I see him in handcuffs. I went, Fuck! &#39;The phone stopped ringing,&#39; he said. &#39;No one&#39;s calling!&#39; And I said, &#39;OK, I got a film.&#39; That&#39;s how it began. I got him back on his feet. He&#39;ll never admit that.” (Indeed, a representative for Crowe disputed this account.)&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;liq5oc&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Back inside, past the spacesuits, Scott showed me a hall full of huge stainless-steel wine tanks, each with a blackboard indicating the variety. A circular window above a pair of barn doors was inspired by a monastery in Narbonne where he&#39;d filmed part of “The Last Duel.” “It&#39;s a church,” Scott whispered, taking in the quiet and the pleasant, vinous aroma. “The standards in France are rigid. You can&#39;t force aging. You can&#39;t add sugar. I find Californian wine way too sweet—you get drunk off one glass.” Scott illustrates all of his wines&#39; labels. In the gift shop, he tapped on a bottle of red, showing two dogs howling at the moon. “I thought all the wine should be about health, fun, sex, dogs,” he said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;A tasting group was coming in, so he led me down the staircase, warning, “I&#39;ve got dodgy knees—too much tennis.” (Arthur Max told me that Scott had injured his knee operating a camera on “GI Jane” but “blames it on tennis, which is more glamorous.”) In the cellar were rows of barrels aging the best of the reds, plus more movie artifacts: a sword from “Kingdom of Heaven,” his 2005 Crusades epic; a miniature of the Colosseum, from “Gladiator”; a chain-mail suit worn by Oscar Isaac in “Robin Hood”; a plaster alien head. “This shit is museum quality,” Scott said, stopping in front of two Napoleon uniforms. He picked up a gilded scimitar, with the inscription “&lt;em >;RECTE FACIENDO NEMINEM TIMEAS&lt;/em>;.” “I was never good at Latin,” Scott said. (It means “In acting justly fear no one.”)&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;He asked an assistant for another espresso. He&#39;d been busy. After finishing the extended cut of “Napoleon,” he started storyboarding the Western; he showed me pages of Ridleygrams, featuring a snowy fight scene. With &lt;em >;SAG-AFTRA&lt;/em>; and the studios back in negotiations, he was preparing to pick up “Gladiator 2,” which stars Paul Mescal, the moment the strike was resolved. “I could shoot on Monday,” he said. (The talks fell apart a week later.) In the meantime, he&#39;d been polishing the ninety minutes he had, including a scene in which the hero fights a pack of baboons; he&#39;d been haunted, he said, by a video of baboons attacking tourists in Johannesburg: “Baboons are carnivores. Can you hang from that roof for two hours by your left leg?不！ A baboon can.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I asked why he wanted to make a “Gladiator” sequel, and he gave a practical answer: the first one made a lot of money. But, as he described the new film, his thoughts turned toward immortality. In the first “Gladiator,” there&#39;s a recurring shot of Maximus&#39; hand grazing the tops of wheat stalks in a field, which we come to realize is the afterlife. Scott had captured the image spontaneously, when he saw Crowe&#39;s body double walking through a wheat field in Umbria, smoking a cigarette. “Do I believe in immortality?” Scott asked, unprompted. “I&#39;m not sure.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I thought back to something that Luke had told me the day before. “In each movie, there is always a character who I think is Ridley,” he&#39;d said. “They tend to be quite peripheral, almost observers. It&#39;s the one with a darker humor, the one who is, perhaps, more divisive. The one who has the agenda.” He thought of Guy Pearce&#39;s character in “Prometheus,” an eccentric billionaire who longs for immortality, or of Tyrell, the corporate wizard from “Blade Runner.” In “Gladiator,” it&#39;s the trainer played by Oliver Reed who advises Maximus, “Win the crowd and you&#39;ll win your freedom.” “In &#39;Napoleon,&#39; ” Luke said, “it&#39;s Napoleon.”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;ykjmhq&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;I asked Scott if he was all these people, and he chortled. “No!”他说。 “Oh, dear.” But he does see “winning the crowd” as his job description. “I have to,” he said. “There&#39;s nothing worse than doing something where you&#39;re thinking, I really got that right—and it fails.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;After “Blade Runner,” Scott&#39;s ability to win the crowd was in doubt. He had kept up his commercial business, directing a series of chic Chanel No. 5 ads inspired by René Magritte. (Chanel&#39;s chairman, Alain Wertheimer, had come to him, pleading, “Chanel No. 5 is my flagship perfume. It&#39;s only seen as a present for Grandma!”) The “1984” Apple ad, which aired during Super Bowl XVIII, became an advertising classic and established the company&#39;s image as a nonconformist juggernaut. But Scott&#39;s next film, “Legend,” a grotesque fairy-tale fantasy starring Tom Cruise as a sprightly woodland boy, bombed. In 1987, he tried his hand at gritty realism, with the noir thriller “Someone to Watch Over Me.” It also failed. Tony, meanwhile, directed the back-to-back mega-hits “Top Gun” and “Beverly Hills Cop II.” “He was competitive with me, naturally, because I&#39;m the older brother,” Ridley said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;His unlikely comeback was “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1991/06/03/thelma-and-louise-movie-review-outlaw-princesses&quot;>;Thelma &amp;amp; Louise&lt;/a>;,” in 1991. Scott picked up the script, by Callie Khouri, with the intention of producing it. After four directors turned him down, he was in a meeting with Michelle Pfeiffer, who was unavailable to star but told him, “Why don&#39;t you come to your senses and direct it?” Again, Scott was thinking visually. As an outsider in America, he wanted to capture the grandeur of the Southwest: “I felt, I&#39;m doing an odyssey of two women on the last journey, and so the last journey had better be beautiful.” The old Route 66 had become industrialized, so he shot in Bakersfield, California. “What he did was put it in an incredibly heroic setting, where John Wayne&#39;s films had actually been shot, which I think was really special,” Susan Sarandon, who played Louise, later told &lt;em>;W&lt;/em>;. Arriving during the throes of third-wave feminism, the movie was a lightning rod—and a hit. (As a bonus, it gave the world Brad Pitt.)&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Then Scott drove his career over a cliff. His follow-up film was the plodding “1492: Conquest of Paradise,” starring Gérard Depardieu, of all people, as Christopher Columbus. Even in 1992, post-colonial sentiment was such that Scott&#39;s treatment seemed weirdly hagiographic. But he clearly saw himself in the explorer. In one scene, Columbus argues with Queen Isabella&#39;s treasurer over the budget for his voyage, like a director haggling with a studio head: “You expect me to take all the risks while you take the profit?”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The rest of the nineties were rough. Scott&#39;s next films, “White Squall” and “GI Jane,” disappointed. He was divorced, again. His company had personnel problems. “He was being pulled in multiple directions,” Sammon observed. “He almost dipped below the radar.” In 2000, he rebounded with another once-in-a-decade hit, “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2000/05/08/gladiator-movie-review-the-empire-strikes-back&quot;>;Gladiator&lt;/a>;.” The movie, critically dismissed as a swords-and-sandals rehash, made nearly half a billion dollars and won the Oscar for Best Picture, though Scott lost the directing prize to Steven Soderbergh, for “Traffic.” “You know, I haven&#39;t gotten an Oscar yet,” he told me. “And, if I ever get one, I&#39;ll say, &#39;About feckin&#39; time!&#39; ”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Gladiator,” for better or worse, revived the Hollywood historical epic, along with Scott&#39;s career. Instead of face-planting again, he directed two more hits, “Hannibal” and “Black Hawk Down.” He was sixty-two when “Gladiator” was released; since then, in a mad sprint, he&#39;s directed seventeen movies, many of them grand in scale. In 2017, his film “All the Money in the World,” about the kidnapping of J. Paul Getty&#39;s grandson, was six weeks from release when its Getty, Kevin Spacey, was accused of sexual abuse. (Spacey denied the allegations and has since been cleared in two trials.) Scott told Tom Rothman, at Sony, that he wanted to reshoot all of Spacey&#39;s scenes with Christopher Plummer as Getty. Rothman recalled, “I said, &#39;Let me tell you absolutely, positively, it cannot be done.&#39; And absolutely, positively, he did it.” Plummer was nominated for Best Supporting Actor. In 2021, Scott released the medieval drama “The Last Duel” and the campy “House of Gucci” within weeks of each other.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Jake Scott has a theory about what is driving his father&#39;s turbocharged late period: “I think he didn&#39;t get to do it early enough.” Ridley reminded me twice that he didn&#39;t release his first movie until he was forty. “He&#39;s watching Spielberg, he&#39;s watching George Lucas, he&#39;s watching all those guys in their twenties and thirties,” Jake said. “Beginning in midlife means that he didn&#39;t get to do all those films that he wanted to do.” Or maybe, Jake conjectured, it has something to do with what happened to Tony.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;One August night in 2012, Scott was in France when his brother called from LA Tony had been battling cancer and was recovering from an operation. He&#39;d survived cancer twice before, as a young man, but his earlier chemotherapy had complicated his treatment. He sounded downbeat, so Scott tried to energize him about work: “I said, &#39;Have you made your mind up about this film yet? Get going! Let&#39;s get you into a movie.&#39; ” What he didn&#39;t know was that Tony was standing on the Vincent Thomas Bridge over Los Angeles Harbor. After hanging up the phone, he jumped. He was sixty-eight.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Scott shut down his offices for days. He dedicated his next film, “The Counselor,” to Tony. Then he made another. And another. “Ridley once told me that he has been dogged by deep depression his whole life,” Sammon said. “He calls it &#39;the black dog,&#39; which is what Churchill called it.” (Scott&#39;s fashion and music-video division is called Black Dog Films.) “He says, &#39;If I stop, I find myself sinking.&#39; ”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Napoleon was just forty-five at the Battle of Waterloo, but David Scarpa, the screenwriter, sees him as a man battling against time. “This sense of infinite possibility that he had when he was younger is gone,” he said. Napoleon died six years later, banished and broken.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In 2014, Scott told &lt;em>;Variety&lt;/em>; that he found his brother&#39;s suicide “inexplicable.” At his offices in LA, I asked if he still found it so. He didn&#39;t. Tony, he explained, was a serious mountain climber. “He&#39;d done El Capitan twice. He would go to the Dolomites. And the operation meant he couldn&#39;t climb again. I think climbing was his enthusiasm. It was his mojo.” He pointed to a photo on the wall, showing a youngish Tony sitting on a craggy mountaintop, a cliff yawning behind him.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Then Scott drifted into a memory: When Tony was sixteen and Scott was twenty-two, Tony took him climbing in the Yorkshire Dales. “I said, &#39;Why?&#39; He said, &#39;Let&#39;s see what you&#39;re made of.&#39; ” The Dales were wet and windy and grim. Scott recalled, “I think, Why am I here? And he&#39;s looking around, going, &#39;Isn&#39;t it fantastic?&#39; ” Tony tied a rope and scaled up an eighty-foot granite rockface, then called down to his brother, “All right. You come up.” Scott started climbing, as Tony clutched the rope from above. “I&#39;m saying, &#39;This is a bad idea.&#39; He&#39;s going, &#39;Oh, no, I&#39;ve got you!&#39; In the fog, I said, &#39;My arms are going!&#39; He said, &#39;That&#39;s because you&#39;re holding on too strong.&#39; ”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Scott felt himself losing his grip on the rockface. “Tony said, &#39;Don&#39;t peel off!&#39; I said, &#39;I can&#39;t help it!&#39; ” Scott let go and spun on the rope, “like a dead spider hanging on the wall,” he recalled. As a movie played in his mind of his younger self dangling in midair, all his battles ahead of him, Scott gave a wicked, staccato laugh. “This sixteen-year-old is going, &#39;I&#39;ve got you. I&#39;ve got you.&#39; And then he lowered me down, with his hands burning.” ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 06 Nov 2023 20:06:01 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Clare Sestanovich on Routine and Rupture]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.newyorker.com/books/this-week-in-fiction/clare-sestanovich-11-13-23]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-06T11:00:00.000Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/63c9c64a7fe53bdf045871e3/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/TWIF-Sestanovich.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;article >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attribute-verso-pattern=&quot;article-body&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;ArticlePageChunks&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;In “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/11/13/our-time-is-up-fiction-clare-sestanovich&quot;>;Our Time Is Up&lt;/a>;,” your story in this week&#39;s issue, a woman named Angela faces the wrenching topic of whether her aging parents should leave their house and move into a retirement community. Angela is both close and not close to her mother—but she has a habit, encouraged by her mother, of comparing them at similar ages. The narrator likens this to trying on a dress that&#39;s been forgotten at the back of the closet. How does this shape Angela&#39;s thoughts about her life?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Maybe we should think of this as a coming-of-middle-age story. Angela is almost forty—statistically, the halfway point of her (expected) life—and she&#39;s preoccupied by big, existential questions.她是谁？ Whom does she want to become? If these sound like adolescent questions, that&#39;s sort of the point: you don&#39;t need to be an actual teen-ager to experience the angst of developmental transitions. (Angela&#39;s mother, surveying life from the precipice of old age, has her own moody-teen thing going on.) Answering these questions is hard—judging by their cyclical recurrence, perhaps even impossible—and comparison offers a tempting shortcut: far easier to size up the dimensions of your own life if it&#39;s lined up next to someone else&#39;s.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;You&#39;re right to note that this is a “habit” of Angela&#39;s, something she does almost reflexively. She measures herself against her mother, but also against total strangers. Stuck in traffic, she asks herself if the driver in the next lane is more or less attractive than she is. For better and for worse, habits can become substitutes for choices; if you always do the same thing, you aren&#39;t exactly deciding to do it, or thinking about whether you really want to do it. In Angela&#39;s case, wondering whether she&#39;s as worthy as her mother is more palatable than wondering about her own intrinsic worth—and certainly more manageable than actually trying to become worthier.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;All this makes me think about the many mirrors in this story. Angela isn&#39;t the only character who tries to avoid them. I wonder now if one reason might be that mirrors make comparison a much starker, much more uncomfortable task: you have no one to look at but yourself, nothing to compare except your idea of yourself and the image of yourself.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;Angela and her husband, Will, are in couples therapy, where they spend a lot of time talking about attraction and satisfaction, and the nature of desire. (They&#39;re ostensibly there to talk about whether to have kids.) Is this the fate of a couple that&#39;s been together for a long time, or is Angela searching for something specific?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Couples therapy is another comparative framework, come to think of it. I&#39;m sure most therapists would urge their clients to think otherwise—it&#39;s not a competition!—but, unlike on the solitary couch, where no one can call you on your bullshit, things inevitably change when there are two narratives in the room. I think Angela both fears and craves this adversarial arrangement. In the face of her husband&#39;s agreeable, constructive approach to therapy—if it &lt;em>;were&lt;/em>; a competition, he&#39;d be winning the most points with their therapist—she often winds up feeling like the bad guy. Maybe even the loser. But, toward the end of the story, she finds herself fantasizing about even more overt confrontation, the kind of clash that might definitively settle the score. So I, too, wonder what Angela is really after. Does she want to vindicate herself—to be the winner at last? Or would she be happy with any outcome, so long as it puts an end to the game? In her ambivalent relationships with her mother and her husband, defeat might have a certain clarity: at least she&#39;d finally understand what it is she stands to lose.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;I&#39;m really indulging the extended sports metaphor here, but it&#39;s relevant to the story. Visiting her childhood home, Angela finds herself sorting through old trophies that testify to her athletic past. Angela doesn&#39;t remember very much about her heyday on the softball field, and that&#39;s arguably part of a much bigger problem for her. Amid the ongoing tally of “W”s and “L”s in life, she not only doubts her own talents; she seems to sometimes wonder if she&#39;s even a player at all. One of the trophies she finds in her mother&#39;s extensive collection is the least impressive sort, awarded simply for participation.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;But this is where the therapist would beg to interrupt: on any given team—a softball roster, a family, a marriage—does anything else matter if you don&#39;t show up?&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;After Angela&#39;s father breaks his wrist, Angela and Will travel from California to Phoenix, to help clean up her parents&#39; house and to take them on a tour of a retirement community. At the house, there are plastic bags stored in shirtsleeves, and towers of dishwashered takeout containers, with an underlying layer of mold. There are also mementos of Angela&#39;s childhood, which her mother has saved and tells her are her “history.” How does Angela feel about this kind of history?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;ics0c5&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;suqlee&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;This history is mostly personal history, the sedimentary layers of junk that fossilize a family&#39;s past. But Angela is also trying to excavate a broader, feminist history—partly, I think, in the hope that it might help diagnose her distress. She pegs her therapist as a “second-waver.” She puzzles over how gendered dynamics have shaped her mother. She struggles to make sense of why, even in her supposedly “empowered” life, certain symbols of conventional femininity seem impossible to escape: cleaning supplies, baby showers, mascara.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;For someone drawn, as Angela is, to a “vague and impersonal” scale of thinking, historical schematizing has an obvious allure. Again and again in this story, things that are seen up close are hard to apprehend: the person sitting next to Angela on an airplane, visible only in her peripheral vision; the parts of Angela&#39;s own body that are impossible for her to see straight on. So it&#39;s understandable that Angela would want to put her trust in the big picture. Step back, zoom out, stop clinging to your measly private past. But perhaps the simplest lesson to be found in Angela&#39;s mother&#39;s house is that no matter the scale—no matter how carefully organized or thoroughly washed or mercilessly cleaned out—history is always a big mess.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;They return to California with nothing resolved—her parents haven&#39;t decided whether to leave their house, and Angela and Will haven&#39;t decided whether to have kids. There&#39;s a kind of stasis that masquerades as movement—but, in your story, is it movement masquerading as stasis?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The therapist would love this question. Unless she&#39;d hate it!&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Near the end of the story, Angela has a sex dream. Like most dreams, it doesn&#39;t make much sense. I&#39;ll leave it to readers to interpret the details (in fiction, we&#39;re all licensed to analyze the subconscious), but one important feature of the dream is the way it scrambles causality, blurring the line between past and present, youth and age, before and after. Nothing really happens and yet everything is turned on its head. I admit that waking life is not usually quite so mystifying—except when it is. The last scene of the story contains both routine and rupture. Cause and effect hang in a strange, uncertain relation: something momentous has occurred, but may not be understood for a long time. There&#39;s a dream logic to it all that I hope feels powerfully, paradoxically real. ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;3js2pt&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 06 Nov 2023 20:06:01 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[A New Comb-over for an Old Woolly Mammoth]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/11/13/a-new-combover-for-an-old-woolly-mammoth]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-06T11:00:00.000Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65457955a22be28803560cab/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/231113_r43356illuweb-site.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;article >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attribute-verso-pattern=&quot;article-body&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;ArticlePageChunks&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Statistically speaking, most of the really cool animals have already died. Certainly, almost all of the big ones have. &lt;em>;Megatherium&lt;/em>;, the twelve-foot-tall sloth? Goner. &lt;em>;Titanoboa&lt;/em>;, the snake as heavy as a Honda Civic? Last seen fifty-six million years ago. The cat-size dragonfly, the double-decker-bus-size rhino, the capybara that could dunk a basketball? Expired, departed, no more. A few years ago, a team of scientists launched an effort to “de-extinct” the woolly mammoth by altering elephant DNA. Should they? “I&#39;ve gone back and forth,” Ross MacPhee, a paleomammalogist at the American Museum of Natural History, said. “I think my fundamental position is: What&#39;s the point, really?”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The other day, up in the museum&#39;s fifth-floor studio, MacPhee was inspecting a mammoth of his own creation. He is curating an exhibition, “The Secret World of Elephants,” that called for the construction of a life-size mammoth model. (It was sculpted of steel, foam, and polyester resin by two museum preparators, Beck Meah and Jason Broughan.) MacPhee, who has brown-and-silver hair and a matter-of-fact disposition, had come to check on one of the trickiest parts of the installation: the hair. Another preparator, Celeste Carballo, who wore a blue jumpsuit, was applying hairy tufts with a hot-glue gun.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The studio looked like an old shop classroom, with high ceilings, a skylight, and heavy machinery. Drills buzzed. Workers came in and out carrying glass eyeballs. Two dogs barked, unseen. The model was on a rolling platform. So far, Carballo had covered most of the legs, which were about as tall as she was. The mammoth, naked from the midriff up, looked as though he were headed to the pool. Do the models get names? “People always ask us that,” Carballo said. Officially, no. Unofficially, Martin. “As in Martin Gore from Depeche Mode,” Carballo said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The hair was the centerpiece of their design. “A lot of illustrations of Ice Age mammals make them as dowdy as possible,” MacPhee said. “They say, &#39;Since we don&#39;t know, it&#39;s safe to just make them all brown.&#39; I don&#39;t think that&#39;s realistic.” MacPhee and Carballo wanted more color. Their edgiest decision was to show the mammoth shedding its winter qiviut coat; for some reason, you never see a woolly mammoth depicted with its wool. MacPhee walked over to an inspiration board. He pointed. “This is obviously not a mammoth—this is a musk ox,” he said. “But it&#39;s a good animal. In shedding time, they look like a badly made bed.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Carballo had found her raw materials at a synthetic-hair company in Massachusetts that did the costumes for “The Grinch,” the 2005 “King Kong,” Chewbacca, and “Where the Wild Things Are.” She held up a thatch, frizzy and tough. “I&#39;m pretty sure we&#39;ve bought hair from them before, for some sort of prehistoric gorilla,” she said.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;“&lt;em>;Gigantopithecus!&lt;/em>; ” MacPhee said. “A huge extinct orang.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Carballo did the dye job herself. “I pretty much spent the summer painting hair, cutting hair, prepping hair, and separating hair,” she said. She&#39;d arranged the shades on carts, a hirsute painter&#39;s palette: Conan orange, Beyoncé ombré, Gosling dirty blond. “I would show them to Ross, and he would help me edit and figure out, like, this tone is right, this is not, this is too Trumpy,” she said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“The mammoths were not any one color,” MacPhee said. “There was even an indication that some must have been close to blond.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The legs still looked too neat—a well-made bed. Carballo planned to rub the mammoth with dirt once she&#39;d applied everything. “A little less Pantene,” she said. Then she&#39;d add the qiviut. She inspected a reference photo of musk-ox eyelashes—thick, kinked shafts, like undone paper clips. She had once used broom bristles, while making a featherlike coat for relatives of a &lt;em>;T. rex&lt;/em>;. “There&#39;s no material you can buy that&#39;s &#39;dinosaur feathers,&#39; ” she said. “You have to figure it out.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Carballo is a painter by training. Years ago, working for a gallery, she assisted on a show of Dieter Roth busts made from chocolate. “Some of my co-workers would eat it,” she said. “I refused to touch it for months. I didn&#39;t want to ruin it for myself.” Her first project at the museum was a diorama of an Aztec marketplace. “I spent a long time painting chayote,” she said. She has since lavished time on other gigantic goners. A megalodon model, from a recent shark exhibit, was so big that she could fit entirely within its jaws.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;She applied another tuft, then headed toward her private workspace, in the rafters. On a desk, she had cotton samples that she was matting to replicate the wool. “I just go like this,” she said, stabbing one with a pointy metal object. On another desk was an unusually luscious hair patch. “When Ross told me to look at musk ox, I actually got ahold of real musk ox,” she said.如何？ “Oh, you know,” she explained. “The Internet helps you find things sometimes.” It felt scratchy. “It sheds,” she said. ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;inq14a&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;yjvjt&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 06 Nov 2023 20:06:01 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Lee Miller’s Surrealist Lunch]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/11/13/lee-millers-surrealist-lunch]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-06T11:00:00.000Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65457a136157b68cd841418a/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/231113_r43359illuweb-site.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;article >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attribute-verso-pattern=&quot;article-body&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;ArticlePageChunks&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Lee Miller is known as one of the great models, muses, and photographers of the twentieth century, a status soon to be affirmed by the movie “Lee,” starring Kate Winslet, and a major show at Gagosian, “Seeing Is Believing: Lee Miller and Friends,” which will hang her work alongside that of Man Ray, Max Ernst, and more. But after the Second World War, shattered by what she&#39;d witnessed as a combat photographer, Miller hid her photos in the attic of Farley Farm—the centuries-old house in Sussex where she lived with her last husband, the Surrealist artist and curator Roland Penrose—and suppressed her undiagnosed post-traumatic stress disorder in an orgy of entertaining and cooking. Some sample dishes: Cauliflower Breasts (cauliflower heads in pink mayonnaise and caviar), Gold Chicken (a bird covered with gold leaf), and Penroses (mushrooms topped with pale-pink foie-gras blossoms). &lt;em>;Vogue&lt;/em>; once termed her food “Surrealist cuisine.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The other day, three people held a Zoom meeting to discuss the opening party for the Gagosian show, which will re-create one of Miller&#39;s farmhouse lunches in a Fifth Avenue mansion. Michael Moore, the gallery&#39;s global-events director, joined Alice Garretti, of Acquolina Catering, and Ami Bouhassane, Miller&#39;s granddaughter, who was beaming in from her Farley Farm office, formerly a guest room where her grandparents had put up friends like Picasso.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Alice, do you want to talk about food first or design first?” Moore asked.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Maybe start with design,” Garretti said. A native of Milan, she perched before the screen in a sleek black jumpsuit. “We need to start sourcing all the pieces for displaying the food and the furniture and whatnot. I just wanted to make sure that I correctly interpreted the book.” She and Moore had been sharing a copy of Bouhassane&#39;s hard-to-find book “Lee Miller: A Life with Food, Friends &amp;amp; Recipes.” It&#39;s filled with photographs of the Penroses&#39; visitors, including the chef James Beard, who once called the couple “the maddest people in the whole world.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Garretti raced through her ideas: wooden kitchen tables piled with cookbooks (Miller owned more than two thousand), jars of preserved vegetables, and mid-century cooking gadgets. To create “that Surrealist component,” she said, she had sourced Toby jugs, decorative ceramics, and candles shaped like French pastries. For serveware, Garretti was considering “slipwork pottery and traditional Victorian ceramics, and then maybe some very ornate silver.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Bouhassane nixed the Victoriana. “She didn&#39;t really use Victorian plates,” she said. “It was more artist slipware and Picasso plates.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;“OK, let me try to get my hands on &lt;em>;those&lt;/em>;,” Garretti joked.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The silver was problematic, too. “The only silverware that she had on her table was the silver King Kong,” Bouhassane said, referring to a plastic toy that Miller had covered in silver and sometimes displayed in a vitrine.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;But Bouhassane was on board with much of the rest, including the pastry candles and a duck-shaped tureen. “The duck is brilliant!”她说。 “I love him! That would be completely her thing! He is super cute.” She added, “Not so much the pumpkin.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Even though it has a little rabbit foot coming out of it?”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“I think that&#39;s just a little bit kind of too trying-a-bit-too-hard, if you know what I mean,” Bouhassane said, keeping her long-dead grandmother&#39;s vision on track. “She&#39;s more subtle than that.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;They turned to the menu. Garretti suggested dishes that Miller typically served for Sunday lunch—smoked fish with horseradish; trifle; green chicken, stewed in celery, leeks, parsley, and peas. “I could use the soup tureen, the duck, to ladle out from,” she ventured. Bouhassane approved.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;There would also be Gold Chicken, Penroses, and food inspired by Miller&#39;s time in Cairo in the mid-nineteen-thirties—when she was married to a wealthy Egyptian engineer—including a dessert called Persian Carpet, in which caramelized oranges are strewn with colorful syrups and crystallized flowers.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;“That sounds brilliant!” Bouhassane said. “But what are you thinking of serving the Persian Carpet &lt;em>;on&lt;/em>;?”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Garretti hadn&#39;t thought that through.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Well, that&#39;s the only thing that she used to serve on a silver platter,” Bouhassane said. “But the silver platter was a plate that she stole from Hitler&#39;s apartment. It&#39;s got his initials on it. In the recipe book, there&#39;s a photograph.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;At the end of the war, Miller and one of her lovers, the &lt;em>;Life&lt;/em>; photographer David Scherman, had joined in looting Hitler&#39;s lair in the Bavarian Alps. They&#39;d recently documented the liberation of Buchenwald and Dachau. Back in England with Penrose, she also used her trophy for serving drinks. Miller noted at the bottom of the recipe, “It has Hitler&#39;s initials and an ugly eagle on it. No one notices.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“I was thinking it was just like a regular silver tray,” Garretti said. “We could also &lt;em>;not&lt;/em>; do that.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“It&#39;d be nice to do it,” Bouhassane said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Alice, I think we should go steal one somewhere,” Moore said, “and use it in the spirit of Lee.” ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;nu8di&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;39y7pw&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 06 Nov 2023 20:06:01 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
