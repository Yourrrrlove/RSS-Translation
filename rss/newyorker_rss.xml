&lt;em>;接收我们每周两次的新闻和新闻政治时事通讯。&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>;&lt;hr />;&lt;p>;克拉伦斯·托马斯法官再次成为人们关注的焦点——这次是因为房车贷款被免除。十九世纪九十年代，一位富有的朋友借给托马斯超过一百万美元来购买一辆四十英尺的大客车。参议院调查现已发现托马斯的贷款后来被免除；这一发现引发了人们对这笔交易的道德问题的质疑。多年来，民主党和共和党总统任命的大法官的行为一直受到质疑，特约撰稿人&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/contributors/jane-mayer&quot;>;Jane Mayer&lt;/a >; 解释说，“但没有什么能与克拉伦斯·托马斯所获得的好处相比”：如果托马斯“在政府的任何其他部门工作，他将永远无法继续担任该职位。”参议院司法委员会的民主党人正在寻求传唤三名与涉及最高法院法官的礼物和旅行有关的保守派捐助者和活动人士。为什么司法部门能够自我监管这么久，谁有责任清理？ 《纽约客》特约撰稿人 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/contributors/susan-b-glasser&quot;>;Susan B.

house on specific Jewish holidays, would seem really nostalgic and familiar to you,” Eli Sussman, one of the owners, said. “And, conversely, would be appealing even if you had no interest in Jewish cuisine.” The result transcends expectations you might have for a neighborhood restaurant while also resisting gimmickry. The half chicken is brined, cleverly, in dill-pickle juice before it&#39;s roasted. The excellent hamburger is sandwiched on a tall, shiny braided challah roll, which can also be ordered on its own, with a schmear of duck butter. All entrées, including a beautiful whole trout—stuffed with lemon rounds and showered with chopped green olives and herbs—come with a choice of fries, greens, or latkes. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/09/11/burgers-with-latkes-and-a-seder-plate-margarita-at-gertrudes&quot;>;&lt;em>;Read the full review »&lt;/em>;&lt;/a>;&lt;/p>;&lt;hr />;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;Two people hold bowls of Noona Noodles ramen.&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65416363f6fb6ae1a2e9179b/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/8_Noona%2520Noodles_Heami%2520Lee_003.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65416363f6fb6ae1a2e9179b/master/w_120,c_limit/8_Noona%20Noodles_Heami%20Lee_003.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65416363f6fb6ae1a2e9179b/master/w_240,c_limit/8_Noona%20Noodles_Heami%20Lee_003.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65416363f6fb6ae1a2e9179b/master/w_320,c_limit/8_Noona%20Noodles_Heami%20Lee_003.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65416363f6fb6ae1a2e9179b/master/w_640,c_limit/8_Noona%20Noodles_Heami%20Lee_003.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65416363f6fb6ae1a2e9179b/master/w_960,c_limit/8_Noona%20Noodles_Heami%20Lee_003.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65416363f6fb6ae1a2e9179b/master/w_1280,c_limit/8_Noona%20Noodles_Heami%20Lee_003.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65416363f6fb6ae1a2e9179b/master/w_1600,c_limit/8_Noona%20Noodles_Heami%20Lee_003.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;Photograph by Jutharat Pinyodoonyachet for The New Yorker&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;div role=&quot;heading&quot; aria-level=&quot;3&quot; >;Noona Noodles&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;&lt;em >;Korean&lt;/em>; | &lt;em >;Koreatown&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;p8g61&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;I can think of no better summer meal than a bowl of &lt;em>;naengmyeon&lt;/em>;, a cold Korean noodle soup traditionally eaten after a meal of barbecue. &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.noonanoodles.com/&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.noonanoodles.com/&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.noonanoodles.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;Noona Noodles&lt;/a>;, a stall run by a mother-daughter duo in a food court in Manhattan&#39;s Koreatown, offers two varieties: &lt;em>;mul&lt;/em>; and &lt;em>;bibim&lt;/em>;, rebranded as Icy and Icy Spicy. Both feature an intensely flavorful broth, made by boiling brisket with fresh pineapple, Asian pear, apple, lemon, daikon, and assorted alliums, and are finished with big hunks of slushy ice, which soak up the sweet, sour, savory liquid like snow cones. In the center of each bowl is a pile of skinny, chewy, glassy noodles, plus lightly pickled daikon, cucumber, and a couple slices of brisket. The Icy Spicy also includes a thick layer of gochujang, to be stirred in; the Icy, which contains more broth, comes with pink vinegar (left over from pickling radishes) and hot mustard, for adding a subtler kick. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/05/29/noona-noodles-restaurant-review&quot;>;&lt;em>;Read the full review »&lt;/em>;&lt;/a>;&lt;/p>;&lt;hr />;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;Man eating a sandwich in a booth at a restaurant.&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65416365b773c4082cdf6208/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/9_S&amp;amp;P_Cole%2520Wilson_223.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65416365b773c4082cdf6208/master/w_120,c_limit/9_S&amp;amp;P_Cole%20Wilson_223.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65416365b773c4082cdf6208/master/w_240,c_limit/9_S&amp;amp;P_Cole%20Wilson_223.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65416365b773c4082cdf6208/master/w_320,c_limit/9_S&amp;amp;P_Cole%20Wilson_223.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65416365b773c4082cdf6208/master/w_640,c_limit/9_S&amp;amp;P_Cole%20Wilson_223.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65416365b773c4082cdf6208/master/w_960,c_limit/9_S&amp;amp;P_Cole%20Wilson_223.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65416365b773c4082cdf6208/master/w_1280,c_limit/9_S&amp;amp;P_Cole%20Wilson_223.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65416365b773c4082cdf6208/master/w_1600,c_limit/9_S&amp;amp;P_Cole%20Wilson_223.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;Photograph by Cole Wilson for The New Yorker&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;div role=&quot;heading&quot; aria-level=&quot;3&quot; >;S&amp;amp;P Lunch&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;&lt;em >;Diner&lt;/em>; | &lt;em >;Flatiron&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Eric Finkelstein and Matt Ross, the sandwich experts and playful nostalgists behind Court Street Grocers and the HiHi Room, have taken over &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.sandwich.place/&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.sandwich.place/&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.sandwich.place/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;the restaurant&lt;/a>; formerly known as Eisenberg&#39;s, a Jewish-style lunch counter near the Flatiron Building, and proved themselves to be gifted preservationists as well as savvy restaurateurs. The menu has been pared down, but it still feels encyclopedic in the tradition of a short-order diner, featuring roughly three dozen sandwiches, including hamburgers. The classics have not been updated so much as painstakingly honed. “It&#39;s like, in your brain, when you eat something, what you want it to taste like,” Ross told me. “That&#39;s our goal.” Some of my happiest moments of late have been spent marvelling at the glory of dishes I&#39;d taken for granted: a ripe half cantaloupe filled with cottage cheese, a bowl of iceberg lettuce topped with egg salad, cream cheese and chopped green olives (a surprisingly thrilling combination) on squishy white bread. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/11/21/playful-nostalgia-and-honed-classics-at-sp-lunch&quot;>;&lt;em>;Read the full review »&lt;/em>;&lt;/a>;&lt;/p>;&lt;hr />;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;Pintxo matrimonio plated at Ernesto&amp;#x27;s.&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6541635c082d4e92078a8c5f/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/10_Ernesto&amp;#x27;s_Tonje%2520Thilesen_DSC01372.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6541635c082d4e92078a8c5f/master/w_120,c_limit/10_Ernesto&amp;#x27;s_Tonje%20Thilesen_DSC01372.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6541635c082d4e92078a8c5f/master/w_240,c_limit/10_Ernesto&amp;#x27;s_Tonje%20Thilesen_DSC01372.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6541635c082d4e92078a8c5f/master/w_320,c_limit/10_Ernesto&amp;#x27;s_Tonje%20Thilesen_DSC01372.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6541635c082d4e92078a8c5f/master/w_640,c_limit/10_Ernesto&amp;#x27;s_Tonje%20Thilesen_DSC01372.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6541635c082d4e92078a8c5f/master/w_960,c_limit/10_Ernesto&amp;#x27;s_Tonje%20Thilesen_DSC01372.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6541635c082d4e92078a8c5f/master/w_1280,c_limit/10_Ernesto&amp;#x27;s_Tonje%20Thilesen_DSC01372.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6541635c082d4e92078a8c5f/master/w_1600,c_limit/10_Ernesto&amp;#x27;s_Tonje%20Thilesen_DSC01372.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;Photograph by Tonje Thilesen for The New Yorker&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;div role=&quot;heading&quot; aria-level=&quot;3&quot; >;Ernesto&#39;s&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;&lt;em >;Basque&lt;/em>; | &lt;em >;Lower East Side&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;vpi3e&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;If anyone objects to the union of two types of anchovies in the &lt;em>;pintxo matrimonio al ajillo&lt;/em>; at &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.ernestosnyc.com/&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.ernestosnyc.com/&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.ernestosnyc.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;Ernesto&#39;s&lt;/a>;, a Basque-leaning restaurant on the Lower East Side, speak now and I will eat yours for you.

Though the fillets are separated by a neat line of &lt;em>;ajillo&lt;/em>;, a zingy condiment of parsley and garlic, each bite brings them together in perfect harmony. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/04/11/the-romantic-basque-leaning-food-of-ernestos&quot;>;&lt;em>;Read the full review »&lt;/em>;&lt;/a>;&lt;/p>;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;feature-default&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;image&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:feature-default&quot;>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;My Favorite Restaurants in New York City&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/651dda2e573040966bd31a31/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/1200_03_Bronx.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/651dda2e573040966bd31a31/master/w_120,c_limit/1200_03_Bronx.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/651dda2e573040966bd31a31/master/w_240,c_limit/1200_03_Bronx.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/651dda2e573040966bd31a31/master/w_320,c_limit/1200_03_Bronx.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/651dda2e573040966bd31a31/master/w_640,c_limit/1200_03_Bronx.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/651dda2e573040966bd31a31/master/w_960,c_limit/1200_03_Bronx.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/651dda2e573040966bd31a31/master/w_1280,c_limit/1200_03_Bronx.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/651dda2e573040966bd31a31/master/w_1600,c_limit/1200_03_Bronx.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/inline-embed>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;GenericCallout&quot;>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;Several small Indian food dishes displayed along a wood counter.&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65416361d2bfaa5cda472f77/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/11_Dhamaka_Heami%2520Lee_092.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65416361d2bfaa5cda472f77/master/w_120,c_limit/11_Dhamaka_Heami%20Lee_092.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65416361d2bfaa5cda472f77/master/w_240,c_limit/11_Dhamaka_Heami%20Lee_092.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65416361d2bfaa5cda472f77/master/w_320,c_limit/11_Dhamaka_Heami%20Lee_092.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65416361d2bfaa5cda472f77/master/w_640,c_limit/11_Dhamaka_Heami%20Lee_092.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65416361d2bfaa5cda472f77/master/w_960,c_limit/11_Dhamaka_Heami%20Lee_092.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65416361d2bfaa5cda472f77/master/w_1280,c_limit/11_Dhamaka_Heami%20Lee_092.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65416361d2bfaa5cda472f77/master/w_1600,c_limit/11_Dhamaka_Heami%20Lee_092.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;Photograph by Heami Lee for The New Yorker&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div role=&quot;heading&quot; aria-level=&quot;3&quot; >;Dhamaka&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;&lt;em >;Indian&lt;/em>; | &lt;em >;Lower East Side&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;At &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.dhamaka.nyc/&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.dhamaka.nyc/&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dhamaka.nyc/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;Dhamaka&lt;/a>;, an Indian restaurant in Essex Market, on the Lower East Side, my dining companions and I took turns dragging our spoons through a hot metal pot of &lt;em>;gurda kapoora&lt;/em>;, searching for offal. Which morsels, we wondered, were the goat kidneys and which were the goat testicles? The one male in our group joked that, as the only person among us in possession of both organs, he was uniquely qualified to tell. He had eaten a lot of kidney as a child in Russia, and recognized it to be the firmer of the two organs—it was almost bouncy in texture, with a pronounced flavor that bloomed slowly and grew funkier. I preferred the testicle, meaty but mild, as supple as sweetbread, nearly spreadable. The vehicle for both was an outstanding gravy—built from a base of gelatinous lamb-trotter stock, fragrant and fiery with whole cardamom pods and green chilies, thick with melted tomato—to be spooned atop buttery, griddled halves of &lt;em>;pao&lt;/em>;, a fluffy slider-size roll introduced to India during the Portuguese occupation of Goa. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/07/05/learning-to-love-goat-kidneys-and-testicles-at-dhamaka&quot;>;&lt;em>;Read the full review »&lt;/em>;&lt;/a>;&lt;/p>;&lt;hr />;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;A person holds at plate of food at Mitica.&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65416361f6fb6ae1a2e91799/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/12_Mitica_Jeremy%2520Liebman_G8A6745.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65416361f6fb6ae1a2e91799/master/w_120,c_limit/12_Mitica_Jeremy%20Liebman_G8A6745.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65416361f6fb6ae1a2e91799/master/w_240,c_limit/12_Mitica_Jeremy%20Liebman_G8A6745.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65416361f6fb6ae1a2e91799/master/w_320,c_limit/12_Mitica_Jeremy%20Liebman_G8A6745.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65416361f6fb6ae1a2e91799/master/w_640,c_limit/12_Mitica_Jeremy%20Liebman_G8A6745.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65416361f6fb6ae1a2e91799/master/w_960,c_limit/12_Mitica_Jeremy%20Liebman_G8A6745.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65416361f6fb6ae1a2e91799/master/w_1280,c_limit/12_Mitica_Jeremy%20Liebman_G8A6745.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65416361f6fb6ae1a2e91799/master/w_1600,c_limit/12_Mitica_Jeremy%20Liebman_G8A6745.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;Photograph by Jeremy Liebman for The New Yorker&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;div role=&quot;heading&quot; aria-level=&quot;3&quot; >;Mitica&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;&lt;em >;Mexican&lt;/em>; | &lt;em >;Greenpoint&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;gy0np8&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;The menu at Mitica, an unassuming Mexican restaurant in Greenpoint, is small enough that I ate through it in just two visits, and found nary a misstep.

Meanwhile, fresh tortillas, still steaming, make for an embarrassment of riches when served with a perfectly cooked fillet of steelhead trout (topped with aioli, smoked and fresh fennel, crispy potatoes, and serrano chili) and with a beautiful rib eye, charred, carved into rosy slices, and finished with a sweet-and-sour pasilla-chili demi-glace, melty whole spring onions, and greens that have wilted in the heat of the meat. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/07/03/the-unassuming-exceptional-food-of-mitica&quot;>;&lt;em>;Read the full review »&lt;/em>;&lt;/a>;&lt;/p>;&lt;hr />;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;GenericCallout&quot;>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;A coffee and a pastry on two tables.&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65416361d2bfaa5cda472f76/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/13_Golden%2520Diner_Heami%2520Lee_r35197.jpeg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65416361d2bfaa5cda472f76/master/w_120,c_limit/13_Golden%20Diner_Heami%20Lee_r35197.jpeg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65416361d2bfaa5cda472f76/master/w_240,c_limit/13_Golden%20Diner_Heami%20Lee_r35197.jpeg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65416361d2bfaa5cda472f76/master/w_320,c_limit/13_Golden%20Diner_Heami%20Lee_r35197.jpeg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65416361d2bfaa5cda472f76/master/w_640,c_limit/13_Golden%20Diner_Heami%20Lee_r35197.jpeg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65416361d2bfaa5cda472f76/master/w_960,c_limit/13_Golden%20Diner_Heami%20Lee_r35197.jpeg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65416361d2bfaa5cda472f76/master/w_1280,c_limit/13_Golden%20Diner_Heami%20Lee_r35197.jpeg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65416361d2bfaa5cda472f76/master/w_1600,c_limit/13_Golden%20Diner_Heami%20Lee_r35197.jpeg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;Photograph by Heami Lee for The New Yorker&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div role=&quot;heading&quot; aria-level=&quot;3&quot; >;Golden Diner&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;&lt;em >;Diner&lt;/em>; | &lt;em >;Lower East Side&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.goldendinerny.com/&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.goldendinerny.com/&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.goldendinerny.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;Golden Diner&lt;/a>;, a Lower East Side greasy spoon that opened in 2019, is not a trendy restaurant posturing as a diner for the sake of nostalgia. It&#39;s a genuine catchall, in the mode of its forebears, but better. The matzo-ball soup is plainly excellent, no bells or whistles. Two eggs are indeed served, as the menu promises, “How you want &#39;em,” scrambled, fried, or folded into an omelette, and plated with a superlative crackly edged hash-brown patty rough-chopped into bite-size pieces. Just like at your local Athenian, you can order half a grapefruit; a side of bacon; a Diet Coke. Coffee refills are free. Unlike your local Athenian, Golden Diner tops its enormous, fluffy pancakes with salted honey-maple butter instead of syrup, in homage to a popular South Korean potato-chip flavor. Its chef, the Momofuku Ko alum Samuel Yoo, is Korean American and grew up in Bayside, Queens. Like a formal poet, he finds creativity within constraints, telling an enchantingly personal story without ever quite coloring outside the lines. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/10/28/golden-diner-updates-the-greasy-spoon-tradition&quot;>;&lt;em>;Read the full review »&lt;/em>;&lt;/a>;&lt;/p>;&lt;hr />;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;The Cha Siu McRib called McBonnies&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654163674a5ba2f5ff919802/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/14_Bonnie_Kyoko%2520Hamada_086.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654163674a5ba2f5ff919802/master/w_120,c_limit/14_Bonnie_Kyoko%20Hamada_086.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654163674a5ba2f5ff919802/master/w_240,c_limit/14_Bonnie_Kyoko%20Hamada_086.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654163674a5ba2f5ff919802/master/w_320,c_limit/14_Bonnie_Kyoko%20Hamada_086.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654163674a5ba2f5ff919802/master/w_640,c_limit/14_Bonnie_Kyoko%20Hamada_086.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654163674a5ba2f5ff919802/master/w_960,c_limit/14_Bonnie_Kyoko%20Hamada_086.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654163674a5ba2f5ff919802/master/w_1280,c_limit/14_Bonnie_Kyoko%20Hamada_086.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654163674a5ba2f5ff919802/master/w_1600,c_limit/14_Bonnie_Kyoko%20Hamada_086.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;Photograph by Kyoko Hamada for The New Yorker&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;div role=&quot;heading&quot; aria-level=&quot;3&quot; >;Bonnie&#39;s&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;&lt;em >;Cantonese&lt;/em>; | &lt;em >;Williamsburg&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;b3inek&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;At &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.bonniesbrooklyn.com/&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.bonniesbrooklyn.com/&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bonniesbrooklyn.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;Bonnie&#39;s&lt;/a>;, a Cantonese restaurant in Williamsburg, the poached half chicken, Bak Cheet Gai, comes with teacups of Gai Tong, or chicken broth, redolent of ginger and white pepper. “Sip it as you eat or dunk it to take away the chill,” my server suggested. “I love this liquid!” my dining companion announced as she sipped. I loved this liquid, too; on another evening I ordered a whole teapot of it. I used it as a palate cleanser between bites of long beans—delightfully sweet and shrivelled, positively clanging with garlic, and topped with croutons made from a kind of savory cruller often served with congee—and bites of scorching-hot Cheung Fun, seared rolled rice noodles that were sticky on the outside and custardy within, the concentrated fishiness of XO sauce (from dried scallops and shrimp) punctuated by notes of fennel seed. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/06/27/at-bonnies-msg-is-wielded-with-nuanced-artistry&quot;>;&lt;em>;Read the full review »&lt;/em>;&lt;/a>;&lt;/p>;&lt;hr />;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;GenericCallout&quot;>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;Takeout containers and vegetables on table.&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6541636895e3758c86ae286d/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/15_Jalsa_Kyoko%2520Hamada_r36237.jpeg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6541636895e3758c86ae286d/master/w_120,c_limit/15_Jalsa_Kyoko%20Hamada_r36237.jpeg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6541636895e3758c86ae286d/master/w_240,c_limit/15_Jalsa_Kyoko%20Hamada_r36237.jpeg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6541636895e3758c86ae286d/master/w_320,c_limit/15_Jalsa_Kyoko%20Hamada_r36237.jpeg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6541636895e3758c86ae286d/master/w_640,c_limit/15_Jalsa_Kyoko%20Hamada_r36237.jpeg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6541636895e3758c86ae286d/master/w_960,c_limit/15_Jalsa_Kyoko%20Hamada_r36237.jpeg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6541636895e3758c86ae286d/master/w_1280,c_limit/15_Jalsa_Kyoko%20Hamada_r36237.jpeg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6541636895e3758c86ae286d/master/w_1600,c_limit/15_Jalsa_Kyoko%20Hamada_r36237.jpeg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;Photograph by Kyoko Hamada for The New Yorker&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div role=&quot;heading&quot; aria-level=&quot;3&quot; >;Jalsa&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;&lt;em >;Indian&lt;/em>; | &lt;em >;Flatbush&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;“I&#39;m a chaat person,” Nowshin Ali explained, when we talked over FaceTime at the beginning of the pandemic.

Chaats, a signature dish of Lucknow, Ali&#39;s home town, are defined on Jalsa&#39;s menu as well as I&#39;ve ever seen: “crispy-crunchy-spicy-tangy Indian snacks.” In India, they&#39;re often sold on the street; in the US, they&#39;re treated like appetizers. Was I a chaat person before I tried Jalsa&#39;s iterations? I&#39;d always enjoyed them, but I don&#39;t remember ever crowing in pleasure the way I did after taking a bite of Shrivastava&#39;s palak chaat: a pile of spinach—lightly battered in chickpea flour, warm yet nearly raw, bright green and refreshing—tossed with glossy tamarind sauce, house-made chaat masala, crispy shards of lentil noodle, onion, tomato, and cilantro. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/04/20/an-indian-restaurant-in-little-pakistan-feeds-its-neighbors&quot;>;&lt;em>;Read the full review »&lt;/em>;&lt;/a>;&lt;/p>;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;feature-default&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;image&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:feature-default&quot;>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;My Favorite Restaurants in New York City&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/651dda2fc0cfacaf9a88b4d0/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/1200_04_Queens.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/651dda2fc0cfacaf9a88b4d0/master/w_120,c_limit/1200_04_Queens.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/651dda2fc0cfacaf9a88b4d0/master/w_240,c_limit/1200_04_Queens.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/651dda2fc0cfacaf9a88b4d0/master/w_320,c_limit/1200_04_Queens.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/651dda2fc0cfacaf9a88b4d0/master/w_640,c_limit/1200_04_Queens.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/651dda2fc0cfacaf9a88b4d0/master/w_960,c_limit/1200_04_Queens.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/651dda2fc0cfacaf9a88b4d0/master/w_1280,c_limit/1200_04_Queens.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/651dda2fc0cfacaf9a88b4d0/master/w_1600,c_limit/1200_04_Queens.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/inline-embed>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;Chef Kwame Onwuachi at Tatiana&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6541636a4b957cead1177913/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/16_Tatiana_Zachary%2520Zavislak.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6541636a4b957cead1177913/master/w_120,c_limit/16_Tatiana_Zachary%20Zavislak.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6541636a4b957cead1177913/master/w_240,c_limit/16_Tatiana_Zachary%20Zavislak.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6541636a4b957cead1177913/master/w_320,c_limit/16_Tatiana_Zachary%20Zavislak.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6541636a4b957cead1177913/master/w_640,c_limit/16_Tatiana_Zachary%20Zavislak.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6541636a4b957cead1177913/master/w_960,c_limit/16_Tatiana_Zachary%20Zavislak.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6541636a4b957cead1177913/master/w_1280,c_limit/16_Tatiana_Zachary%20Zavislak.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6541636a4b957cead1177913/master/w_1600,c_limit/16_Tatiana_Zachary%20Zavislak.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;Photograph by Zachary Zavislak for The New Yorker&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;div role=&quot;heading&quot; aria-level=&quot;3&quot; >;Tatiana&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;&lt;em >;Afro-Caribbean&lt;/em>; | &lt;em >;Lincoln Square&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;b76rh4&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;In recent years, the fairly staid and hallowed institution of Lincoln Center has done its best to evolve. &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.tatiananyc.com/&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.tatiananyc.com/&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.tatiananyc.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;Tatiana&lt;/a>;, Kwame Onwuachi&#39;s restaurant in the reopened David Geffen Hall, is a triumph in staying relevant while fitting into the broad category of performing arts: all restaurants are theatrical, of course, but eating here is like watching &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/10/09/kwame-onwuachis-cuisine-of-the-self&quot;>;Onwuachi&lt;/a>; deliver a controlled and electric autobiographical monologue. The menu traces a childhood spent in the Bronx and in Nigeria and a career that began in the galley of an oil-spill-response vessel off the coast of Louisiana (his mother&#39;s home state) before leading him to the Culinary Institute of America and then to Per Se, Eleven Madison Park, and the TV show “Top Chef.” The most obvious showpiece is the short-rib pastrami &lt;em>;suya&lt;/em>;, a single, hefty blackened rib, seasoned at the intersection of Jewish deli and northern-Nigerian barbecue, accompanied by caraway-coconut Parker House rolls. I preferred an abundant bowl of braised oxtails, as large and beefy as I&#39;ve ever seen, served with Thumbelina carrots, chayote squash, and rice and peas. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/01/16/kwame-onwuachis-electric-tatiana-at-lincoln-center&quot;>;&lt;em>;Read the full review »&lt;/em>;&lt;/a>;&lt;/p>;&lt;hr />;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;The vibe at Place des Fêtes&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6541636c4a5ba2f5ff919804/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/17_PlaceDesFetes_MengwenCao_001.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6541636c4a5ba2f5ff919804/master/w_120,c_limit/17_PlaceDesFetes_MengwenCao_001.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6541636c4a5ba2f5ff919804/master/w_240,c_limit/17_PlaceDesFetes_MengwenCao_001.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6541636c4a5ba2f5ff919804/master/w_320,c_limit/17_PlaceDesFetes_MengwenCao_001.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6541636c4a5ba2f5ff919804/master/w_640,c_limit/17_PlaceDesFetes_MengwenCao_001.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6541636c4a5ba2f5ff919804/master/w_960,c_limit/17_PlaceDesFetes_MengwenCao_001.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6541636c4a5ba2f5ff919804/master/w_1280,c_limit/17_PlaceDesFetes_MengwenCao_001.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6541636c4a5ba2f5ff919804/master/w_1600,c_limit/17_PlaceDesFetes_MengwenCao_001.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;Photograph by Mengwen Cao for The New Yorker&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;div role=&quot;heading&quot; aria-level=&quot;3&quot; >;Place des Fêtes&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;&lt;em >;Wine Bar&lt;/em>; | &lt;em >;Clinton Hill&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.pdfnyc.com/&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.pdfnyc.com/&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.pdfnyc.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;Place des Fêtes&lt;/a>;, the name of a plaza in the Nineteenth Arrondissement of Paris, translates to “party square.” Place des Fêtes, a wine bar and restaurant in Clinton Hill, with its buttery leather stools and whitewashed brick walls, would be perfect for a first date. The kitchen—overseen by the chef and co-owner Nico Russell, known previously for Oxalis, in Crown Heights—can make magic with whatever the season, or the pantry, presents. Fingerling potatoes, grilled low and slow until their skins turned thick and crisp and separated from their velvety flesh, smacked of a campfire, except for a luscious green gloss of savory sabayon. A plate of four skinny Don Bocarte anchovy fillets in olive oil, imported from Spain, seemed austere, but proved beguilingly unctuous. My favorite of the cocktails was also the lowest ABV, the Vermut and Soda, which the bartender accurately described as “almost like a Dr. Pepper,” though it&#39;s not nearly as sweet, and imparts the barest impression of smoke. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/07/04/making-magic-at-place-des-fetes&quot;>;&lt;em>;Read the full review »&lt;/em>;&lt;/a>;&lt;/p>;&lt;hr />;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;GenericCallout&quot;>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;A plate of oysters at Chez Ma Tante&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6541636a4615171c212602f4/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/18_Chez%2520Ma%2520Tante_David%2520Williams_180312_r31629.jpeg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6541636a4615171c212602f4/master/w_120,c_limit/18_Chez%20Ma%20Tante_David%20Williams_180312_r31629.jpeg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6541636a4615171c212602f4/master/w_240,c_limit/18_Chez%20Ma%20Tante_David%20Williams_180312_r31629.jpeg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6541636a4615171c212602f4/master/w_320,c_limit/18_Chez%20Ma%20Tante_David%20Williams_180312_r31629.jpeg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6541636a4615171c212602f4/master/w_640,c_limit/18_Chez%20Ma%20Tante_David%20Williams_180312_r31629.jpeg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6541636a4615171c212602f4/master/w_960,c_limit/18_Chez%20Ma%20Tante_David%20Williams_180312_r31629.jpeg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6541636a4615171c212602f4/master/w_1280,c_limit/18_Chez%20Ma%20Tante_David%20Williams_180312_r31629.jpeg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6541636a4615171c212602f4/master/w_1600,c_limit/18_Chez%20Ma%20Tante_David%20Williams_180312_r31629.jpeg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;Photograph by David Williams for The New Yorker&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div role=&quot;heading&quot; aria-level=&quot;3&quot; >;Chez Ma Tante&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;&lt;em >;European&lt;/em>; | &lt;em >;Greenpoint&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;ihiue8&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://chezmatantebk.com/&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://chezmatantebk.com/&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://chezmatantebk.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;Chez Ma Tante&lt;/a>;, in Greenpoint, doesn&#39;t bill itself as Québécois or even Canadian, but it strikes me as a restaurant made in the image of Montreal&#39;s dining scene. Its name, which translates to “At My Aunt&#39;s House,” comes from a beloved hot-dog stand in Montreal, and one of the two owners, the chef Aidan O&#39;Neal, spent time cooking there and at M. Wells, a Québécois bistro in Long Island City. The short menu shifts from season to season. When I visited, the chicken-liver pâté, whipped to the consistency of butter, was as nutty and pungent as an aged cheddar. Also excellent was the kedgeree, an Anglo-Indian classic, here featuring slippery flakes of poached cod and chopped egg nestled in delicately curried rice, all topped with a tousled salad of parsley, celery, and thinly sliced sweet onion. And a French fry is a French fry until you&#39;ve had the ones at Chez Ma Tante: enormous, creamy wedges of russet potatoes wearing crispy bronze armor that cracks easily between the teeth but holds up beautifully to thick, glassy, intensely garlicky aioli. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/03/12/an-unmistakable-taste-of-montreal-at-chez-ma-tante&quot;>;&lt;em>;Read the full review »&lt;/em>;&lt;/a>;&lt;/p>;&lt;hr />;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;One person passes a dish to another person over a table of plates.&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65416372082d4e92078a8c61/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/19_Torrisi_Caroline%2520Tompkins_0089.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65416372082d4e92078a8c61/master/w_120,c_limit/19_Torrisi_Caroline%20Tompkins_0089.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65416372082d4e92078a8c61/master/w_240,c_limit/19_Torrisi_Caroline%20Tompkins_0089.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65416372082d4e92078a8c61/master/w_320,c_limit/19_Torrisi_Caroline%20Tompkins_0089.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65416372082d4e92078a8c61/master/w_640,c_limit/19_Torrisi_Caroline%20Tompkins_0089.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65416372082d4e92078a8c61/master/w_960,c_limit/19_Torrisi_Caroline%20Tompkins_0089.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65416372082d4e92078a8c61/master/w_1280,c_limit/19_Torrisi_Caroline%20Tompkins_0089.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65416372082d4e92078a8c61/master/w_1600,c_limit/19_Torrisi_Caroline%20Tompkins_0089.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;Photograph by Caroline Tompkins for The New Yorker&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;div role=&quot;heading&quot; aria-level=&quot;3&quot; >;Torrisi&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;&lt;em >;Italian American&lt;/em>; | &lt;em >;Nolita&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Are we living in a Roaring Twenties redux, as was predicted when the pandemic began to wane?

Salt-cured ham, sliced in translucent sheets from enormous haunches displayed near the host stand, was served with a pyramid of crisp golden zeppole and pineapple mostarda. A special called Capellini Cantonese, featuring glossy angel hair tangled with garlic and jalapeño, was crowned with half of the most perfectly cooked lobster I&#39;ve ever had. My favorite course was the most inherently excessive: dessert. The staff pushes, rightly, the affogato, a coupe layered sexily with espresso granita, vanilla ice cream, mascarpone mousse, and hot fudge. But nothing beat the “frozen yogurt”: half a grapefruit hollowed out and filled with absurdly creamy, tart soft-serve, swirled with grapefruit-Campari jam and a grassy, green olive oil, accompanied by a tiny tureen of extra jam—a marvel of both luxury and restraint. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/05/08/torrisi-bar-and-restaurant-review&quot;>;&lt;em>;Read the full review »&lt;/em>;&lt;/a>;&lt;/p>;&lt;hr />;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;GenericCallout&quot;>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;A photograph of five colorful cocktails in a line against an olivegreen curtain.&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6541636f4a5ba2f5ff919806/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/20_Eyval_Cole%2520Wilson.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6541636f4a5ba2f5ff919806/master/w_120,c_limit/20_Eyval_Cole%20Wilson.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6541636f4a5ba2f5ff919806/master/w_240,c_limit/20_Eyval_Cole%20Wilson.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6541636f4a5ba2f5ff919806/master/w_320,c_limit/20_Eyval_Cole%20Wilson.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6541636f4a5ba2f5ff919806/master/w_640,c_limit/20_Eyval_Cole%20Wilson.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6541636f4a5ba2f5ff919806/master/w_960,c_limit/20_Eyval_Cole%20Wilson.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6541636f4a5ba2f5ff919806/master/w_1280,c_limit/20_Eyval_Cole%20Wilson.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6541636f4a5ba2f5ff919806/master/w_1600,c_limit/20_Eyval_Cole%20Wilson.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;Photograph by Cole Wilson for The New Yorker&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div role=&quot;heading&quot; aria-level=&quot;3&quot; >;Eyval&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;&lt;em >;Persian&lt;/em>; | &lt;em >;Bushwick&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;At this Persian restaurant in Bushwick, I couldn&#39;t help but steal sips of a friend&#39;s orange-blossom Negroni, a cold and viscous concoction that lingered on my tongue and in my memory (I can taste it now!).

>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Earlier this year, Ben Smith, the former editor-in-chief of BuzzFeed News and a onetime New York &lt;em>;Times&lt;/em>; columnist, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/05/15/traffic-ben-smith-book-review&quot;>;published&lt;/a>; a book, titled “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Traffic-Genius-Rivalry-Delusion-Billion-Dollar/dp/0593299752&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Traffic-Genius-Rivalry-Delusion-Billion-Dollar/dp/0593299752&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Traffic-Genius-Rivalry-Delusion-Billion-Dollar/dp/0593299752&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;Traffic: Genius, Rivalry, and Delusion in the Billion-Dollar Race to Go Viral&lt;/a>;.” It explores the creation of, and the competition between, well-funded news-and-culture Web sites—BuzzFeed News and the Huffington Post among them—that began in the early two-thousands, just as the professional blogosphere was getting going. One day after the book&#39;s May 2nd release, the &lt;em>;Times&lt;/em>; published a Smith-authored &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/03/opinion/jezebel-gawker-buzzfeed-ben-smith.html&quot;>;guest essay&lt;/a>;, titled “We&#39;re Watching the End of a Digital Media Age. It All Started with Jezebel.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Jezebel is an influential feminist Web site that I created in 2007. Smith had devoted an entire chapter of “Traffic” to the story of the site&#39;s creation, stumbles, and successes. He was complimentary, calling it “a new kind of cultural politics,” one that built “a community that rejected the old structures of gender and power, and tried to shape new ones.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;One could be forgiven for discerning a slight difference in tone between “Traffic” and the essay that appeared in the &lt;em>;Times&lt;/em>;. Smith&#39;s book took a deep look at the impact of a number of Web sites, but his &lt;em>;Times&lt;/em>; essay seemed to make the argument that Jezebel in particular reflected a “remarkable new openness” and “uncontrollable anger” on the Internet. As he put it, “What makes Jezebel feel so relevant now is that it was among the first places to crystallize the powerful forces that would define social media over the next decade: politics and identity.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I agreed that Jezebel embodied a “remarkable new openness,” and I was flattered by Smith&#39;s acknowledgment of the site&#39;s continued influence. But some of what he wrote gave me pause. His essay positioned the site as the start of an era that would culminate in the 2016 election of Donald Trump. I wanted nothing to do with it. As for “uncontrollable anger”? The phrase felt sexist and paternalistic.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I live in Los Angeles, so I wasn&#39;t immediately aware of the conversation about the essay. People started texting me around 7 &lt;em >;AM&lt;/em>; PST In the darkness of my cozy bedroom, I took a quick glance at the piece on my phone, admired the accompanying photo of me (it was a good photo, and I can be vain), rolled my eyes at a few of the conclusions, and then went back to bed.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;About half an hour later, I was awoken again, this time by a phone call from a friend. It appeared that a small backlash to the piece was brewing online—namely, on Twitter. Some readers felt that, by focussing his attention on Jezebel, Smith was blaming women for outrage culture. I read this with interest—after all, women get blamed for a lot of things and aren&#39;t credited enough for other things—but I also didn&#39;t have the energy to respond to it. I placed my phone on my bedside table and pulled the covers back over my head.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;I felt ambivalent. The essay had stirred up something from the past that I hadn&#39;t been able to work out: what part, if any, I might have played in the evolution of derisive online discourse. Smith wasn&#39;t purporting to answer this question—some of his language, perhaps deliberately, was a bit vague. But he did make a connection between Jezebel&#39;s often combative commenters and the eventual users of social-media platforms like Twitter, accusing the site of unleashing “searing online mobs.” Jezebel had been created years before the wide-scale adoption of social media, back when people were still going to blogs and then refreshing them to see what new posts had appeared. According to Smith, “The unmediated passions of social media took up where it left off.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Anger can be explosive. It can ignite social movements and chip away at calcified ideas about sex, gender, class, and race. It&#39;s also fair to say that when women express it—or are accused of expressing it—they&#39;re easily, sometimes viciously, mocked and derided. This is perhaps doubly true for women of color, who have to contend not only with sexist tropes but also with racial stereotypes and fearmongering around anger and tone. (Both my deputy editor at Jezebel, Dodai Stewart, and I are Black. The widely held assumption that the site was staffed only by white women possibly did us some sort of favor.)&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;But here&#39;s the thing about tone: in many cases, it &lt;em>;does&lt;/em>; matter. And though I was often politically and personally in agreement with our commenters, their over-the-top rhetoric could be alienating to me. I worried that this sort of rhetoric might offend new readers, and that it would be harmful to the new dialogue around gender politics that we were trying to influence and bring into the mainstream. Was there such a thing as “too much” anger? If so, who was I to determine what “too much” is? I felt torn, so I kept these questions mostly to myself.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;When Jezebel launched, I was thirty-three, about to turn thirty-four. The events that led to the site&#39;s creation have been written about many times before. So here&#39;s the short version: disillusioned by the state of American women&#39;s media, I was given the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to create and oversee a women&#39;s-media entity—in this case, a Web site. I imagined it as one with a lot of personality, with humor, with edge. I wanted it to combine wit, smarts, and anger, providing women—many of whom had been taught to believe that “feminism” was a bad word or one to be avoided—with a model of critical thinking around gender and race which felt accessible and entertaining. As one of my colleagues, Moe Tkacik, &lt;a href=&quot;https://jezebel.com/the-five-great-lies-of-womens-magazines-262130&quot;>;wrote&lt;/a>;, in an early post, “Jezebel is a blog for women that will attempt to take all the essentially meaningless but sweet stuff directed our way and give it a little more meaning, while taking [the more] serious stuff and making it more fun, or more personal, or at the very least the subject of our highly sophisticated brand of sex joke. Basically, we wanted to make the sort of women&#39;s magazine we&#39;d want to read.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Of course, feminist Web sites and blogs were already exploring a new kind of politics among young American women. But, unlike Jezebel, they rarely incorporated robust and sustained pop-culture analysis, and they existed on the periphery of the Internet. (They also didn&#39;t have the funding and other resources that my staff and I enjoyed.) These sites, independently owned, with names like Feministing, Feministe, Racialicious, and AngryBlackBitch, had cultivated devoted readerships, but their audiences were small, and their language was often academic.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Our audience, on the other hand, started off big and quickly got bigger, reaching more than ten million page views a month in the first year. (We had the benefit of being part of a larger blog network, anchored by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/gawker-was-a-great-place-to-become-a-journalist&quot;>;Gawker&lt;/a>;, which we would overtake in traffic in less than three years.) I was delighted, if a little taken aback, by our readers&#39; immediate passion and loyalty. Within two months of the site&#39;s launch, some readers were, unprompted, referring to themselves as “Jezebelles” or “Jezzies” in the comments sections of the site. Familiar screen names and avatars began to appear as regular readers populated the threads, talking with one another and, occasionally, with the site&#39;s writers.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The majority of our commenters were very good. Smart, observant, well-read, vibrant, and dizzyingly funny, they added context and nuance to the stories we published and pressed us to do better. Within a year of Jezebel&#39;s launch, they even &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/04/fashion/04jezebel-1.html&quot;>;attracted&lt;/a>; the attention of the New York &lt;em>;Times&lt;/em>;, which described them as meeting for drinks and renting vacation houses together. But sometimes they were bad: sarcastic, mean, intellectually dishonest, and bullying toward one another. And sometimes they were horrible, behaving like a twisted Greek chorus trying to upstage the main performers. (Years later, as comments on Web sites began to migrate to social media, I would come to realize that they &lt;em>;were&lt;/em>; the main performers.) “That&#39;s sort of the nature of having a commenting community,” Erin Ryan, an early commenter who became a writer for the site, told me. “People start feeling like they should have a say in what happens there. And really that&#39;s not how a publication works.” At one point, in 2009, I toyed with the idea of handing the site over to the commenters for a day, just to watch them fail.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;hoqrk9&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;l9yp34&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;At times we were accused of “tone-policing” our readers. And it&#39;s true: we &lt;em>;did&lt;/em>; tone-police, especially those commenters who were nasty or uncivil. We would take to the comments threads to warn readers about crossing some sort of line. When they derailed a thread, we&#39;d ask them to move the discussion into the comments of a daily anything-goes post that I pointedly named “Groupthink.” (Most of the commenters didn&#39;t seem to get the joke.) I could have, maybe should have, been tougher on them. My managing editor at the time counselled me to think of Jezebel as a virtual dinner party my writers and I were throwing. “You wouldn&#39;t allow someone to be that rude to other guests or hosts. You&#39;d kick them out,” he said. “Do the same thing in the comments.” But we rarely banned anyone outright. No one wanted to punish readers for being impassioned.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I like to think that, though the moderation was irritating to many commenters, it was also empowering. Readers knew that we were watching and that we cared about what they had to say. Someone once told me that the Jezebel commenters were so devoted, if often critical, because the community was made up of bright, ambitious young women who were underutilized and underappreciated at their day jobs. I thought that this was a fascinating, if depressing, observation.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I wondered, sometimes, whether my concerns about the comments were themselves sexist. Was I holding women to a standard of comportment? Complicating matters further was the fact that I&#39;d started Jezebel and shepherded it to success on the back of my own anger. Though that anger, as I&#39;ve explained, was legitimate and warranted—American women had been sold a bill of goods about who they were and what they wanted, or what they &lt;em>;should&lt;/em>; want—it was starting to define the site, for both readers and casual observers.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I remember one blogger, a woman named Susannah Breslin, who, sometime after the site&#39;s launch, accused its writers of “caterwauling about the patriarchy.” This made us laugh. Breslin&#39;s accusation that writers on Jezebel yelled a lot—er, caterwauled—made sense. We were not without mischievousness (our parent company encouraged a certain amount of snark), but we also leaned into our anger—about sexism, about racism, about the erosion of women&#39;s reproductive rights.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Other critics accused us of intentionally stoking readers&#39; outrage. In mid-2009, Slate&#39;s women&#39;s Web site, DoubleX, published, as one of its first posts, an article &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20090823044352/http:/www.doublex.com/section/news-politics/trouble-jezebel&quot;>;which claimed&lt;/a>; that Jezebel “is hurting women.” “It&#39;s staffed by bloggers who are expected to produce around 10 high-traffic posts a day,” the feminist scholar Linda Hirshman (who passed away this week) wrote. “It didn&#39;t take the bloggers long to realize that one way to attract a lot of traffic was to offer up outrageous behavior to the clicking public.” She recalled an evening in 2008 when two Jezebel writers got drunk during an onstage interview for the talk show “Thinking and Drinking” and made glib remarks about sexual assault. (These comments were then &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.huffpost.com/entry/jezebelism_b_110903&quot;>;posted&lt;/a>; on the Huffington Post for all to see.)&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I understood such hesitations—we had a big platform, and we were young and provocative and perhaps not ready for prime time—at the same time that I rejected them. In that instance, the outrageous behavior was not engineered, nor was the traffic welcomed. The entire staff was humiliated, and I was livid about it for months. Less of an embarrassment was &lt;a href=&quot;https://jezebel.com/ten-days-in-the-life-of-a-tampon-388226&quot;>;Tkacik&#39;s post&lt;/a>; titled “Ten Days in the Life of a Tampon.” (The headline about sums it up.) We were well aware that this sort of gross-out story might generate page views, but it was written not to attract outsized attention but to engage in a bit of truthtelling—in this case, about how women&#39;s bodies actually work. I didn&#39;t like it when feminists policed other feminists, though it had been happening for generations. And I wanted to think that we knew a little something about how to politicize a generation of young women—not by enforcement of doctrine but by example.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Still, a story about Jezebel was emerging: that we were deliberately provoking our readers. In July, 2010, the writer Emily Gould &lt;a href=&quot;https://slate.com/human-interest/2010/07/how-feminist-blogs-like-jezebel-gin-up-page-views.html&quot;>;published&lt;/a>; a piece titled “Outrage World,” also at DoubleX, in which she accused Jezebel and other feminist blogs of cynically causing “firestorms” in order to boost page views. Gould went on to attack the site for exploiting “women&#39;s worst tendencies” by pushing readers “to feel what the writers claim is righteously indignant rage but which is actually just petty jealousy, cleverly marketed as feminism.”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;mmb6q&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;When I look back at the piece, one thing is obvious to me: some of the firestorms that began on the site accompanied legitimately infuriating reporting. The main example of a provocative post was a June, 2010, story that Irin Carmon, who would go on to do groundbreaking work on sexual harassment and abortion rights, reported about sexism at “The Daily Show.” Carmon spoke to writers, staffers, and a former executive on the show, who painted a picture of a beloved, seemingly progressive media organization that was, in fact, a boys&#39; club. (In 2017, Jon Stewart admitted, during an interview with Howard Stern, that she was right.)&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The other thing I noticed was that Gould, like many of Jezebel&#39;s critics, saw the writers as &lt;em>;responsible&lt;/em>; for the commenters: if Carmon&#39;s post provoked readers, then that was part of some master plan; if the commenters were enraged or cruel, this, too, was engineered by the site&#39;s staff. During my time editing the site, I found these assumptions intensely frustrating. In reality, every day was a negotiation between trying to be fair to our commenters and insuring group civility. (Gould declined to comment for this piece.)&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;When writing this, I remembered a &lt;a href=&quot;https://jezebel.com/no-offense-1749221642&quot;>;2015 Jezebel piece&lt;/a>; by Jia Tolentino called “No Offense.” In it, Tolentino, who at the time was the deputy editor of the site (and now is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/contributors/jia-tolentino&quot;>;a &lt;em>;New Yorker&lt;/em>; staff writer&lt;/a>;), tries to tackle multiple things at once, including how anger works on the feminist Internet and the ways in which digital media blurs the distinctions between readers and writers, creators and consumers. “There&#39;s a large gap between &#39;this is bad&#39; and &#39;you should be offended&#39; that seems to vanish on the internet, and the harder we try to widen it on this website, the more we are constrained by that lingering expectation: that Jezebel exists, as some have always imagined it to, for the infantilizing purpose of telling women when they should get mad,” she wrote. Later, she added, “In theory, people still expect a feminist site to tell people what to be offended at; but what people seek from a feminist site is that the site itself will cause offense.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I&#39;m not sure that what people &lt;em>;seek&lt;/em>; from a feminist site is that it will cause offense. I think they look for community. But communities can be difficult—chaotic, contentious, cacophonous. I recently came across a two-hundred-plus-page &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.ideals.illinois.edu/items/113064&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.ideals.illinois.edu/items/113064&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.ideals.illinois.edu/items/113064&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;dissertation&lt;/a>;, published in 2019, called “Architecture and the Record: Negotiating Feminism in the Jezebel Comments.” It was . 。 。 a lot. The author, Melissa Forbes, accused the site (again!) of choosing to “cater to outraged feminists.” I thought that she wasn&#39;t giving the staffers, or our readers, much credit. But I was intrigued by Forbes&#39;s observation that the comments provided a corrective to the feminism of the site&#39;s writers. When the writers themselves were glib or cruel, she wrote, the commenters offered “a different kind of feminism from that practiced on the top half of the page.” I take issue with the idea that there are “different kinds” of feminism, though there are different “waves” of it. But I do believe that the commenters&#39; close reading of everything we did was how they forged community. They learned from one another, developed relationships, and discovered their own voices—and that was true even when they were (rightly or wrongly) angry with the editors and writers. As one commenter quoted by Forbes put it, “I have learned a lot from the kinds of articles you publish on this website, and even more from your regular commenters.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;That leaves the question of what, exactly, the Jezebel commenters had to do with the anger that exploded on social media. A few weeks ago, I spoke to the author and technologist Tobias Rose-Stockwell about his new book, “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Outrage-Machine-Amplifying-Discontent-Undermining/dp/0306923327&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Outrage-Machine-Amplifying-Discontent-Undermining/dp/0306923327&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Outrage-Machine-Amplifying-Discontent-Undermining/dp/0306923327&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;Outrage Machine: How Tech Amplifies Discontent, Disrupts Democracy—and What We Can Do About It&lt;/a>;,” which looks at the ways that enmity on the Internet is rewarded by social-media platforms, advertisers, and individuals. I told him about Smith&#39;s piece, and my ambivalence toward it. I explained that, though I detested accusations that we had used anger to manipulate readers, I wondered whether the outrage culture on social media had its roots in comments sections.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Rose-Stockwell was not particularly familiar with Jezebel. (In his defense, he was not part of its target audience.) But he echoed Smith&#39;s assertions, calling the early two-thousands comments sections of Web sites “proto-social media.” Sites like Jezebel, he said, were showing that it was “possible to bring people from passive consumers of news to engaged participants in the editorial process—something that was new for a media site.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;In 2007, when we launched Jezebel, Rose-Stockwell explained, reader remarks could not be easily boosted or reposted. Outrage or offense still occurred within the confines of communities. By 2009, however, social media—what he called “an opinion-serving machine”—was changing everything. That year, he said, “three key features: &lt;em>;algorithmic feeds&lt;/em>;, &lt;em>;social metrics&lt;/em>;, and &lt;em>;one-click sharing&lt;/em>; fundamentally upgraded the speed at which we spread knowledge, propelling us into the modern viral era.”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;35q9dq&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;u2nd&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;In his book, Rose-Stockwell points out that virality did not emerge by accident. Social-media technologists prioritize posts using emotional language. These posts, in turn, can start “trigger chains”—in which social-media users are encouraged to react to inflammatory comments and “pick sides on topics about which we would otherwise have few opinions”—and cause “emotional contagion,” in which a person expressing an emotion leads to the “reflexive production of the &lt;em>;same&lt;/em>; emotion by others in the same proximity.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;After I read this, I felt some measure of relief. The stories and topics we wrote about on Jezebel weren&#39;t being “served,” in some premeditated performance or attempt at manipulation. They were organic. &lt;em>;They were the point&lt;/em>;. And we were not abstract algorithms or “conflict entrepreneurs” (another useful phrase from Rose-Stockwell&#39;s book, describing people who create or stoke chaos online in order to boost their own profiles). We were young women with agency and points of view. We were also, I should add, pretty funny. “I think that people didn&#39;t give us credit for having a sense of humor,” Dodai Stewart, the former deputy editor, told me. “I don&#39;t want to discount some of the more serious things, but, from my perspective, our meetings weren&#39;t us sitting around with everyone red in the face, full of outrage and upset. We were having fun, mostly.” Erin Ryan, the former writer and commenter, took this a step further. “I don&#39;t want to rag on anger,” she told me. “I think anger can be great. It&#39;s the basis of a lot of great comedians and writers and opinion writers. I&#39;d say Jezebel was a passionate Web site. But the passion wasn&#39;t necessarily just outrage for the sake of outrage.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In our conversation, Rose-Stockwell explained that he&#39;s not trying to condemn outrage so much as look at it from a more systemic perspective. Outrage, online or off, allows us to understand the things that are wrong with society, and to work together to begin to fix them. It can unite people, he said, and help society to cohere around certain norms. In this sense, a lot of the outrage on Jezebel was, indeed, productive, contributing to a larger political and cultural project. I think that one can draw a straight line from the feminist Web sites of the early two-thousands to a growing mainstream discourse around gender politics and race and patriarchy, from Beyoncé performing in front of a sign that read “Feminist” at the 2014 MTV Video Music Awards to the Women&#39;s March in 2017 and the explosion of #MeToo that same year to the recent juggernaut that is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-front-row/barbie-is-brilliant-beautiful-and-fun-as-hell&quot;>;the Barbie movie&lt;/a>;. (Yes, the Barbie movie. One of my former colleagues jokingly described the film as making her feel “like I was trapped in the Jezebel comments.”)&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;A few weeks ago, I reached out to Smith and told him that I&#39;d been trying to sort out the discomfort I&#39;d been feeling in the wake of his piece. I explained that I needed him to clarify what he meant when he said that Jezebel was the start of a particular digital-media age. What age was that?&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;z6oef5&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;“Social media,” he said. “That&#39;s how I think about it.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I pressed him. Was he saying that Jezebel influenced the &lt;em>;tone&lt;/em>; on social media, the conversation, or both? Did the site augur something that was brand new, or reflect something that was already in process?&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;He replied that this was a question he&#39;d struggled with while writing his book. “I feel like when I was writing, the thing that I was always running up against was, Did X cause Y, or are X and Y being carried along in the same stream?” he said.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;I also wanted Smith to respond to my frustrations about that phrase “uncontrollable anger,” and the apparent ease with which he, knowingly or not, placed blame for the current political climate on outraged or opinionated women.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;He conceded that his phrasing might have been problematic or inartful. “I&#39;m not trying to invalidate women&#39;s anger at all, but it does seem like that was part of the mix, and powerful,” he told me.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“I think that anger was part of it, yes, but I don&#39;t think it was uncontrollable,” I replied. “I&#39;d say it was &lt;em>;very&lt;/em>; controlled, actually, because that was the way women learned they should express it.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I see Jezebel not as the beginning of the end of the digital-media era but as a moment—a spark—within an ongoing discussion about gender politics. That conversation has led to new realities around sexual assault and harassment, pay inequity, and cultural depictions of women. It also makes some people uncomfortable—in part because it involves women expressing their anger in public and sustained ways. “Every woman has a well-stocked arsenal of anger,” Audre Lorde wrote in 1981, which can act as a “powerful source of energy serving progress and change.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;If that&#39;s part of Jezebel&#39;s legacy, I&#39;ll take it. It&#39;s about everything I could have hoped for. ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;bhh62v&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 04 Nov 2023 19:06:01 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Why Antisemitism Led a DeSantis Ally to Jump to Trump]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.newyorker.com/news/q-and-a/why-antisemitism-led-a-desantis-ally-to-jump-to-trump]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-04T10:00:00.000Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654405d6f9309101ece468bb/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Chotiner-11-05-23-gradient.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;article >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attribute-verso-pattern=&quot;article-body&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;ArticlePageChunks&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Randy Fine is the only Jewish Republican in the Florida legislature, and has for several years been a strong supporter of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tag/ron-desantis&quot;>;Ron DeSantis&lt;/a>;, the state&#39;s governor. Fine served as DeSantis&#39;s Jewish outreach chair during the 2018 gubernatorial campaign, supported DeSantis&#39;s reëlection bid last year, and backed him for President. Then, two weeks ago, Fine decided to switch his support to former President Donald Trump. The reason? Antisemitism. In Fine&#39;s view, DeSantis has insufficiently addressed numerous neo-Nazi marches that have taken place in Florida in recent years. (The &lt;em>;Times&lt;/em>; reported last month that DeSantis&#39;s unwillingness to condemn the marches has concerned some Republican donors at a time when his campaign is already lagging well behind Trump&#39;s.) The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/dispatch/waking-to-an-attack-from-hamas&quot;>;Hamas attack on October 7th&lt;/a>; was the final straw.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I recently spoke by phone with Fine to try and understand DeSantis&#39;s behavior, and why Fine was now turning to a man with a long history of using antisemitic tropes, and all-around bigotry. Our conversation, edited for length and clarity, is below.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;A lot of people have come to support Donald Trump for different reasons over the years: the fact that he&#39;s a businessman, the economy, immigration. But you are supporting him in part because of your concerns about antisemitism. Can you talk a little about that?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Well, I was a big supporter of the President during his four years in office. I was at the Abraham Accords when they were signed. I was in the White House at least half a dozen times, so I was always a big fan of the work that he did. The fact that I had endorsed the Governor was not “I&#39;m against Donald Trump,” if that makes sense.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;Right, you had to choose, and so you chose, but you weren&#39;t—&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I had been very unhappy with the quietness around the rise of Nazism. And while I wasn&#39;t beating the Governor up publicly over it, I was very vocal privately, asking why we were not using the laws that are in place. Why aren&#39;t we taking this seriously? So were lots of his Jewish supporters.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;And what was his response?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Well, the response is what you hear. I think he&#39;s been very consistent. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s the truth, but what he says is he doesn&#39;t want to elevate them by talking about it. He questions whether they are real. He&#39;ll call them fake, and he thinks that they&#39;re doing it to make him look bad. And he has said that consistently for eighteen months.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;And you felt like you couldn&#39;t get through to him on that?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I couldn&#39;t, but the Nazis are one level of scary.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;They are a high level for sure.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Look, I don&#39;t worry about these neo-Nazis executing the Holocaust in America. It&#39;s bad and we need to do something about it. Don&#39;t get me wrong. But Hamas is a whole &#39;nother level. And so, while I had been unhappy in private, I changed as a person on October the 7th. And when I saw these protests break out within twenty-four hours in Florida, I knew that I had laid the groundwork by passing laws that could deal with this.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;Which protests are you talking about?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;There were pro-Hamas protests in Florida, in Tampa, and Fort Lauderdale. The other thing I came to realize was that, if Donald Trump had been President, October 7th wouldn&#39;t have happened. I would bet every dollar, because it didn&#39;t happen in his four years.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;It&#39;s possible that October 7th didn&#39;t have to do with Trump, no?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The world was afraid of him. The world was afraid of him. No one&#39;s afraid of Joe Biden unless you&#39;re the person cleaning the stairs. No one&#39;s afraid of him.&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;Wait, what&#39;s the stair joke?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;You know, he falls down the stairs.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;Oh, I see. That&#39;s a good one.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Yeah. I mean, no, it&#39;s fine. But people were afraid of Donald Trump. Iran would sit there and think, You know what? If we do this, he could nuke us. I&#39;m sure that went through people&#39;s minds because that&#39;s the kind of guy that he is. And so, I said, Look, I&#39;ve got DeSantis saying things but not acting, and I&#39;ve got Trump who acts.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;Kind of a Teddy Roosevelt thing. Talk softly, but carry a big stick.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Well, Trump doesn&#39;t talk softly. Trump talks loudly and carries a big stick but—&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;Better than Teddy Roosevelt.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I&#39;m not saying better; I&#39;m just saying different. I&#39;ve been the voice of my Jewish community in Florida for seven years. I&#39;m the only Jew in the legislature in the majority party. I am the one who advocates for these things. People look to me, and I also have to deal with them when they&#39;re unhappy, which they have been for two years because of the silence and the antisemitism. The New York &lt;em>;Times&lt;/em>; wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/28/us/politics/desantis-israel-antisemitism.html&quot;>;piece&lt;/a>; where they interviewed multiple donors of the Governor who said that they&#39;d called him and said, Do something about it. And he wouldn&#39;t do it.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;It&#39;s a little confusing why he wouldn&#39;t respond to people like you who are concerned about this. I have noticed that he often doesn&#39;t like to respond to criticism that requires him to criticize the right in turn&lt;/strong>;.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I don&#39;t know the reason. The one that I think is the most noble of all is he is very confident that he is right almost all of the time. And when he thinks he is right, he is very stubborn and maybe he believes what he&#39;s saying. And look, I understand the stubbornness. In many ways, as governor, he was stubborn, and he was right. Look at &lt;em >;COVID&lt;/em>;.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;3gx5x&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;1ga11v&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;Let me ask you about Donald Trump&#39;s response to this. His first public comments were to criticize the Prime Minister of Israel and to say that Hezbollah was very smart. How does that fit into what you&#39;re talking about?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I can vote for the governor who says all the right things or I can vote for the President who actually does them. I&#39;m focussed on the actions. I know what the world was like when he was President. He is the first American President to have a Jewish child and Jewish grandchildren, who I know that he cares about. And so, I know that he is not an antisemite.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;You mentioned neo-Nazis earlier. Trump very famously was not all that angry about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-battle-of-charlottesville&quot;>;a neo-Nazi march in Charlottesville&lt;/a>; where someone was killed. How does that fit into what you&#39;re talking about?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Well, that whole thing is a fiction.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;I see.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;No, no, no. If you listen to what he said, he didn&#39;t equivocate and say, Nazis are good. He didn&#39;t do that. But people were able to take a very narrow slice of what he did, of what he said, and make him look bad. Again, he did the Abraham Accords, and he moved the Embassy. He let them annex the Golan. So, look, I&#39;m also a little bit like Donald Trump. I&#39;m a retired businessman. I understand the need to be brash and blunt and to get what you want out of life.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;In both cases, do you think your ideas may stem from your business experience?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Maybe.我不知道。 But I think there&#39;s value in a little bit of uncertainty. I believe that a lot of these foreign powers were afraid of Donald Trump because they couldn&#39;t read him. China says, Well, man, if we invade Taiwan, he could nuke us and go to war.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;Trump has a long history of statements that people have thought played into antisemitic stereotypes. There&#39;s his friendship with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/kanye-wests-parler-games&quot;>;Kanye West&lt;/a>; who has made many antisemitic remarks. There&#39;s his talking about Jews and money all the time. There&#39;s talking about dual loyalty, all these things.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Yes, yes.是的。 I understand. Here&#39;s what I&#39;ll say. There&#39;s English, there&#39;s French, there&#39;s Spanish.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;Business-ese?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;And then there&#39;s Trump. I think a lot of times you have to say, What does he actually mean? Not, What is he actually saying? So I was there in 2016 or 2015 when he spoke to the Republican Jewish Coalition, and he said, None of you support me because I don&#39;t need your money, or something like that. And I didn&#39;t support him at the time. I remember thinking, That sounds terrible, but I understand what he&#39;s saying. And I also think people take him out of context. So, for example, he said, Hezbollah is smart. Well, smart doesn&#39;t equal good. And, by the way, as a business person, the No. 1 mistake you can make in business is assuming that your enemy is dumb.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;I think your words versus actions distinction is an important one, but, to me—&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;zii7yk&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;That&#39;s what this is all about.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;The reason I brought up Charlottesville is not just that Trump&#39;s words offended people but that to any sentient person watching him, it was very clear that he was annoyed to have to denounce neo-Nazis. Whether that&#39;s because they like him, or whether that&#39;s because he has sympathy with them, I can let you analyze.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;He doesn&#39;t have sympathy for them.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;Why do you think they like him?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I don&#39;t know that they do. I don&#39;t think they like DeSantis. People will say, Oh, they&#39;re holding up Trump signs and DeSantis signs. They hate DeSantis.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;We can stick to Trump.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;But I think it&#39;s the same for him. I don&#39;t think they actually do like either of them.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;They&#39;re sort of pretending to like him?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Look, I think he may not have wanted to say something. I remember what I said when it happened. They&#39;re marching around with their tiki torches saying, Jews won&#39;t replace us. That is their famous line. I was, like, “Guys, you got nothing to worry about: if you were doctors and lawyers and Nobel Prize winners, you might have something to worry about, but we&#39;re not interested in living at home with our parents, when we&#39;re in our forties, playing World of Warcraft all day. You&#39;re safe.” These people, to some degree, they are losers. If they weren&#39;t losers, they wouldn&#39;t do this. I mean, by definition, if you think this is a good idea, you&#39;re an idiot.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;Right, and, if there are people at some neo-Nazi rally who like Trump, it&#39;s not necessarily clear that they like him because of issues related to race or Jews. They could like him for the reason any normal person might like him, that he&#39;s a businessman, et cetera.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Yeah. But going back to Charlottesville, honestly, it&#39;s been so long—I can&#39;t remember what I ate for breakfast, let alone what happened six years ago. But I do remember that there was controversy. And there were people who weren&#39;t racists who said, Look, that is our history. We should not just discard it and melt these statues down. I think that&#39;s what he was getting at. I don&#39;t know where I fall on that, except I will say this: George Washington owned slaves. I mean, no one&#39;s perfect.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;He didn&#39;t go to war against the United States, which Robert E. Lee did, which is one distinction between those two.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I understand, but I don&#39;t think you can say that someone from Virginia who doesn&#39;t want to take down a Robert E. Lee statue is inherently a racist. They just want to preserve their heritage or what have you. I understand the other side as well. And, by the way, you can just go forward and say, Whoever owned slaves shouldn&#39;t be recognized for anything. They own slaves. It&#39;s beyond terrible.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;Do you think one reason Trump got into so much hot water around Charlottesville was because people thought, Well, it&#39;s not just about Charlottesville per se. It&#39;s that he said these things about Mexicans. He called Obama&#39;s birthplace into question. Things like that.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;nojx59&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;f7dzb&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Like I said, there&#39;s English, there&#39;s French, there&#39;s Spanish, and there&#39;s Trump. And look, I also think—I&#39;m not going to say fake news, fake news—but guys in your world were very hard on him. And, by the way, in many cases wrongly.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;Last question. When you thought about supporting DeSantis and now moving to Trump, did &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/american-chronicles/the-devastating-new-history-of-the-january-sixth-insurrection&quot;>;January 6th&lt;/a>; ever give you second thoughts, or have we sort of moved past that as a country?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;So I have an interesting view on January 6th.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;Uh oh.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I was a page. The most informative year of my life as a kid, I was a page for the US House of Representatives. I worked on the floor of the House for a year, and the desk that I got to use was pushed in front of the main doors to the chamber to keep people from coming up. And I cried that day. It&#39;s a very sad day for me. And the people who did it should be held accountable, but it was an epic clown show and a riot. It wasn&#39;t a coup attempt. What has been described is way more than it actually was. If you&#39;re going to do a coup, you show up with guns.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;Well, some of them had guns.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I know, but this was a mob riot gone mad. Well, people did bad things. I&#39;m not saying they didn&#39;t, and I&#39;m not saying they shouldn&#39;t be punished. I think they should, and I said so at the time. What they did was not OK, but it wasn&#39;t the end of the world.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;But when you said it wasn&#39;t a coup attempt, they did, on the House floor, try to throw out the results of the Presidential election.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;This was a clown show. That&#39;s what it was. I always think of a guy, the shaman-hat guy. [&lt;em>;Jacob Chansley, known as the QAnon Shaman, was sentenced to forty-one months in federal prison for his role in January 6th.&lt;/em>;] I mean, these were wackos.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;Is it worrisome that the former President was supportive of these wackos?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I don&#39;t think he was supportive of the wackos. So, no. I remember watching it that day, and he&#39;s like, Let&#39;s go to the Capitol, but be peaceful. And did he really understand? Sometimes people don&#39;t understand what&#39;s going on in real time. Oh, yeah. They&#39;re in the Capitol. There&#39;s the fog of war. In the middle of something, you don&#39;t actually have all the details of what was going on.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;Although you could say that business experience is the type of thing that allows people to see things right when they are happening&lt;/strong>;—&lt;strong>;to be ahead of the market?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;That&#39;s not necessarily true.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;Oh, OK&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In order to be ahead of the market, you still gather all the facts.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;If Trump had gotten all the facts on the day of, things might&#39;ve been different, I think.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I believe if the President had understood truly what was happening, I think he probably would&#39;ve acted differently. Yeah. ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;mt4rwl&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 04 Nov 2023 19:06:01 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[In the Middle East, Despair Is Not an Option]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/11/13/israel-gaza-hamas-war]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-04T10:00:00.000Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654595f03dcbffdb74c6fb34/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Remnick-Comment-Against-Despair-Social.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;article >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attribute-verso-pattern=&quot;article-body&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;ArticlePageChunks&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;In an era of darkness and blood, it is nearly impossible to remember that, from Moscow to Jerusalem, there was once a time of promise. Not resolution, not paradise, and certainly not the end of history––but promise. Between 1989 and 1995, the following things happened: the fall of the Berlin Wall and the liberation of Eastern and Central Europe; the collapse of Soviet Communism and the (seeming) end of the Cold War; the brief, but startling, appearance of a pro-democracy movement in Beijing and other Chinese cities; the end of South African apartheid; and the signing of the Oslo Accords by the Israeli leadership and the Palestine Liberation Organization.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In other words, in many nations, political leaders, dissidents, and social movements, having exhausted so many rotten ideas and endured so much oppression and tragedy, began to push the world in a direction of decency, democracy, and compromise. Of course, there is much that is oversimplified in that sentence—euphoria and triumphalism obscured some of the dark currents that persisted in those countries and in human nature itself—but the promise was real, and it ran deep.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Now we live in ominous times, with Vladimir Putin&#39;s Russia laying waste to whole cities and towns in Ukraine, and the death count mounting in the Middle East. Rarely a day passes when there is not a new threat of broader conflagration. Will Putin deploy the worst weapons in his arsenal or extend his forces to other former Soviet republics? Will the Middle East conflict expand to Lebanon, Syria, and Iran? Only the hard of heart do not mourn the loss of life and work to stop it; only a fool does not recognize the possibility of worse days to come. Yet despair, though a temptation, does not constitute a vision. In 2016, when a bigoted authoritarian won election as President in this country, despair was not an option. It is not an option now.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;It is almost a certainty, though, that, at least for some time, the forces of reaction, of furious radicalism, will persist. Two vivid examples among many: recently, a senior Hamas official, Ghazi Hamad, declared that Israel can expect “a second, a third, a fourth” attack, until it is eliminated from the map. “We must annihilate that country,” he said, “because for the Arab and Islamic world it constitutes a disaster.” In Hamad&#39;s view, there is no need to regret the brutalities of October 7th. “We did not want to harm civilians, but there were complications on the ground,” he told Lebanese television. “Everything we do is justified.” At the same time, in the Israeli parliament, Zvi Sukkot, a radical settler with a long record of disgraceful provocations against Palestinians in the West Bank, has been appointed to lead the subcommittee on West Bank issues. Israeli authorities were previously so wary of Sukkot that they deemed him unfit to serve in the Army. Merav Michaeli, the leader of the Labor Party, called him “one of the most dangerous people in Israel, a racist, pyromaniac, terror supporter,” capable of igniting a “second front” on the West Bank. (In the past, Sukkot was repeatedly arrested and expelled from the West Bank, on suspicion of committing arson and perpetrating violent attacks, which he denied.)&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;The forces of hatred extend well beyond the region. The director of the FBI, Christopher Wray, testified in the Senate that levels of antisemitism are at “historic levels” in the US and warned that extremists could “draw inspiration” from Hamas and assault Jews on American soil. Wray also said that Jews, despite representing just 2.4 per cent of the American public, are targets of “something like sixty per cent of all religious-based hate crimes.” The wave of antisemitism is arguably more pronounced in Europe, where the German President, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, was so alarmed that he told a rally at the Brandenburg Gate that it was “intolerable that Jewish people are today once again living in fear in our country, of all places.” And, as Rozina Ali writes in the &lt;em>;Times,&lt;/em>; fears of Islamophobic attacks in the Muslim American community are also on the rise; one of the more appalling examples is the recent stabbing death, in Illinois, of a six-year-old Palestinian American child, Wadea al-Fayoume, by his family&#39;s landlord, who, according to the boy&#39;s mother, shouted before attacking them, “You Muslims must die!”&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Israel was created precisely out of a sense that a tiny and persecuted population, following centuries of violence culminating in the Holocaust, could no longer endure the precarity of exile. More than any event in Israeli history, the massacre of October 7th shattered the country&#39;s sense of protection. At the same time, the Palestinians of Gaza, after years of Israeli siege and blockade, and immiserating misrule by Hamas, live in a state of excruciating loss and fear; the Palestinians of the West Bank continue to live under an unbearable occupation that has lately grown so intimidating and violent that there is frequent talk in the territories of a “second Nakba.” And any attempt to establish a landscape of security and human dignity will wither if the likes of Ghazi Hamad and Zvi Sukkot go on playing leading roles. Any world in which Hamas and an increasingly reactionary Israeli leadership dictate the policy and the temper of the region is doomed to more injustice, confrontation, and death.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;udoju&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;ek6yv&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;President Biden&#39;s challenges are immense. Facing a likely reëlection campaign against an increasingly manic Donald Trump as well as the Russian assault on Ukraine and the constant challenge of China, Biden must also find, day to day, ways to press for peace and security in the Middle East, while encouraging the positive participation of complicated regional powers, including the UAE, Qatar, Egypt, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia. The standard practice of embracing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in public and pressuring him in private has long proved to be a mug&#39;s game. He has been in the business of deceiving American Presidents since the nineteen-nineties. “I know what America is,” Netanyahu once said. “America is a thing you can move very easily.” Moreover, the man who advertised himself as “Mr. Security” presided over the biggest security failure in the history of the state.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;It may take years for a new political culture to take hold among the Palestinians and the Israelis. It may be many years before the psychic wounds heal. Right now, to most ears, talk of a “two-state solution” is nostalgic fantasy and a “one-state solution” a recipe for instant civil war. With all eyes blurred by rage and grief, an absence of vision is the reality. But, as the Palestinian academic Sari Nusseibeh put it to me recently, “People have to be shown or given options. We don&#39;t have the option of being pessimistic.” At least one source of inspiration is that era of history, not so distant, when leaders and movements, for all their flaws and failures, agreed to agree, and fought for the rights of ordinary human beings to live in freedom and without fear. That is a process that is never fully achieved anywhere, but it cannot be relinquished to a state of despair. ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;0qzhq4&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 04 Nov 2023 19:06:01 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[What Will It Take to Win Brooklyn’s First Majority-Asian District?]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-local-correspondents/what-will-it-take-to-win-brooklyns-first-majority-asian-district]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-04T10:00:00.000Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6543f34e75635ded66f5083f/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Lo-Alvarado_0698.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;article >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attribute-verso-pattern=&quot;article-body&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;ArticlePageChunks&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;On a Saturday in early fall, a sisterly crowd of political volunteers milled about in a community center in Sunset Park, Brooklyn. They were there to help elect a thirty-seven-year-old Democrat named Susan Zhuang as the City Council member for the borough&#39;s first-ever majority-Asian district, the recently redrawn Forty-third. The district, in the usual manner of these things, has a complicated outline, with several sharp turns. It roughly resembles a crowing rooster, with the top of its head touching Kai Feng Fu dumpling house, on Eighth Avenue, and its feet perched right around the Shore Parkway Jewish Center, in Bensonhurst.

She describes her introduction to local politics as almost accidental. A friend asked her to deliver a box of tea to a longtime assemblyman named William Colton; when she got to his office, she was struck by the number of people waiting for his help in dealing with various issues—housing, food stamps, Social Security. Zhuang, who has an MBA, volunteered to help low-income families and small businesses with their taxes. Eventually, she became Colton&#39;s chief of staff.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Zhuang arrived late at the community center, in a pink campaign T-shirt and sneakers; she had to stop on the way to see one of Colton&#39;s constituents, who was concerned about a dying sycamore tree. (“Potholes, street lights, or trees that need to be cut—anything—they come to our office,” she said.) The assembled volunteers were set to canvass the surrounding neighborhood, a challenging part of the district, where the predominantly Chinese residents had not exhibited much interest in local politics. “I want to get Asians to come out to vote, no matter if you vote for me or not,” Zhuang said. “Because the general public thinks Asians don&#39;t vote, that Asian voices don&#39;t matter. We need to make sure our voice matters.”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;GenericCallout&quot;>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;Susan Zhuang&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6543f34e7f0186339818578b/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Lo-Alvarado_1395.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6543f34e7f0186339818578b/master/w_120,c_limit/Lo-Alvarado_1395.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6543f34e7f0186339818578b/master/w_240,c_limit/Lo-Alvarado_1395.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6543f34e7f0186339818578b/master/w_320,c_limit/Lo-Alvarado_1395.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6543f34e7f0186339818578b/master/w_640,c_limit/Lo-Alvarado_1395.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6543f34e7f0186339818578b/master/w_960,c_limit/Lo-Alvarado_1395.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6543f34e7f0186339818578b/master/w_1280,c_limit/Lo-Alvarado_1395.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6543f34e7f0186339818578b/master/w_1600,c_limit/Lo-Alvarado_1395.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;Zhuang, who lives in Bensonhurst, grew up outside Shanghai, and came to the US when she was twenty.&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Seated at a table near the front of the room were three volunteers of high-school age. They were briefed by another volunteer, who wore a paisley dress above trench boots and had mala prayer beads on her wrist. “Everyone has to remember, Susan&#39;s No. 1 policy is public safety,” she told the teens. “She supports police officers and also wants to regulate electric scooters.” Zhuang chimed in: “Listen, they&#39;re not going to want to have a conversation with you for a long time. If they do, then you mention more. If they don&#39;t, tell them Susan is for public safety.” In 2014, not long after Zhuang began volunteering for Colton, a Chinese American police officer named Peter Liang shot and killed an unarmed Black man named Akai Gurley who was walking in a stairwell, with his daughter, at a housing project in East New York. Although Liang and the NYPD insisted that the shooting was accidental, Liang was convicted of second-degree manslaughter. (The conviction was later downgraded to criminally negligent homicide.) Many Asian Americans in the city, including Zhuang, believed that Liang had become a scapegoat for the larger problem of police violence. “Yes, he made a mistake,” Zhuang said, “but so many cops don&#39;t get indicted. When it&#39;s an Asian cop, they say he&#39;s a killer.”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;feature-large-callout&quot; >;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;Campaign volunteers call registered voters and remind them of the upcoming election for council district 43 in November...&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6543f34d7f01863398185789/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Lo-Alvarado_0819.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6543f34d7f01863398185789/master/w_120,c_limit/Lo-Alvarado_0819.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6543f34d7f01863398185789/master/w_240,c_limit/Lo-Alvarado_0819.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6543f34d7f01863398185789/master/w_320,c_limit/Lo-Alvarado_0819.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6543f34d7f01863398185789/master/w_640,c_limit/Lo-Alvarado_0819.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6543f34d7f01863398185789/master/w_960,c_limit/Lo-Alvarado_0819.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6543f34d7f01863398185789/master/w_1280,c_limit/Lo-Alvarado_0819.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6543f34d7f01863398185789/master/w_1600,c_limit/Lo-Alvarado_0819.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;Two young volunteers make calls for Susan Zhuang.&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;The volunteer in paisley assembled a canvassing group that included two teen-agers and two adults. The kids were both freshmen at so-called test schools: Joanna, bespectacled, attends Brooklyn Tech, and Anna, who wore a Snoopy sweater, goes to Stuyvesant. (One of the adults in the group was Anna&#39;s mom.) Despite Zhuang&#39;s emphasis on public safety, she may be best known as an advocate for preserving the Specialized High School Admissions Test as the sole criterion for entry into these schools. Asian American New Yorkers have punched above their weight on the test: more than half of the students who received offers to attend the schools this year were Asian. (Only three per cent were Black and around six per cent were Latino.) Joanna said that she needed to announce a major at the end of sophomore year and was considering math. She wanted to get into a good local college, such as Hunter. “I just want to not be in debt,” she said. It seemed like a lot to have contemplated by fourteen. “I feel like it&#39;s a waste of my time to not think about these things, when I still have time to think about it,” she said.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;GenericCallout&quot;>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;A candidate talks with a constituent on a stoop.&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6543f34e05eb91fba6e6b223/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Lo-Alvarado_1409.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6543f34e05eb91fba6e6b223/master/w_120,c_limit/Lo-Alvarado_1409.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6543f34e05eb91fba6e6b223/master/w_240,c_limit/Lo-Alvarado_1409.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6543f34e05eb91fba6e6b223/master/w_320,c_limit/Lo-Alvarado_1409.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6543f34e05eb91fba6e6b223/master/w_640,c_limit/Lo-Alvarado_1409.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6543f34e05eb91fba6e6b223/master/w_960,c_limit/Lo-Alvarado_1409.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6543f34e05eb91fba6e6b223/master/w_1280,c_limit/Lo-Alvarado_1409.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6543f34e05eb91fba6e6b223/master/w_1600,c_limit/Lo-Alvarado_1409.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;“I want to get Asians to come out to vote, no matter if you vote for me or not,” Zhuang said. “We need to make sure our voice matters.”&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Together, the group walked through the streets that thread Eighth Avenue. When the group arrived at their first door, Joanna volunteered to take the lead. But no one answered, so they were off to the next. On the way, Joanna asked Anna where she went to school, and her eyes widened when she heard Stuyvesant, which, along with Bronx Science, is perhaps the most prestigious of the test schools. The group spent three hours canvassing, and spoke to about a dozen people, but it was tough going. “Chinese people are so brutal,” Joanna said. “They just ignore you.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;About a month earlier, near the jutting wing of the district, around a hundred people filled half of the restaurant New Choi Fook, which has the best price for king crab in Bensonhurst, at least according to one reviewer. The crowd was there to raise money for Ying Tan, Zhuang&#39;s Republican opponent. The candidate, in a red dress and white heels, explained that her campaign could be traced to a moment five years earlier, when she began to look into schools for her oldest child, then three years old. “Has anyone noticed that schools lean toward being unfair for us?”她问。 “We can&#39;t let people think that, as Chinese people, we won&#39;t speak up.”&lt;/p>;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;feature-default&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;image&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:feature-default&quot;>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;Ying Tan&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6543f34c05224fc450603344/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Lo-Alvarado_0768.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6543f34c05224fc450603344/master/w_120,c_limit/Lo-Alvarado_0768.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6543f34c05224fc450603344/master/w_240,c_limit/Lo-Alvarado_0768.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6543f34c05224fc450603344/master/w_320,c_limit/Lo-Alvarado_0768.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6543f34c05224fc450603344/master/w_640,c_limit/Lo-Alvarado_0768.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6543f34c05224fc450603344/master/w_960,c_limit/Lo-Alvarado_0768.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6543f34c05224fc450603344/master/w_1280,c_limit/Lo-Alvarado_0768.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6543f34c05224fc450603344/master/w_1600,c_limit/Lo-Alvarado_0768.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;Tan, a member of the New York Young Republican Club, previously volunteered on the State Senate campaign of Vito LaBella.&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/inline-embed>;&lt;p >;Tan, who is thirty-two, grew up in Taishan, which has been called the “wellspring of the Chinese diaspora.” She now lives in Rego Park, in Queens, and volunteers at a senior-day-care center owned by her husband. Tan is a member of the New York &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/03/27/roger-stone-shakes-a-nixonian-martini&quot;>;Young Republican Club&lt;/a>;; last year, she volunteered on the State Senate campaign of Vito LaBella, a sixty-one-year-old ex-cop from Bay Ridge. He lost the race, narrowly. Afterward, both LaBella and Tan declared their candidacies for the City Council seat in the new Forty-third. Just eight hundred and thirty-eight people voted in the Republican primary; Tan won by thirty-one votes. But LaBella has stayed in the race, on the Conservative Party line, which may complicate Tan&#39;s path to victory. A political consultant working for Tan, George Sarantopoulos, told me he was frustrated by LaBella&#39;s decision. At a recent Republican gathering, Sarantopoulos pleaded with his fellow Party members to reach out “to the Chinese voters, to the Russian voters, to the religious Jewish voters,” adding, “I&#39;m sorry, if we want to be a party of 2023—our Italian friends are moving to Jersey, to North Carolina, they&#39;ve passed on.

Nick, who grew up in New Jersey, lives in Manhattan. “Democrats, especially the Asian ones, don&#39;t represent us,” he said. But, in the past two years, he went on, “the Asian community finally woke up, and made this very rightward shift.” Asian values are conservative at heart, he insisted. What did he think of Tan&#39;s Republican primary challenger, LaBella, staying in the race? “It&#39;s the voters who will control the Party,” he said, adding, “Will the Party bosses ever like us? Probably not.” But it was “the country-club Republicans who hold back the Yings of the world,” he said, and “they&#39;re going to be irrelevant. Asian Americans will be the new electorate of the Republican Party, and it will be a strong one.” What did he think of the night&#39;s speeches? “I forgot my Chinese a long time ago,” he said.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Across the table sat a constituent in her late thirties named Liz Yang, whose family came to New York from Guangzhou. Her mother-in-law went to Tan&#39;s senior-day-care center. “Growing up, I thought Republicans were for the rich, and Democrats—if it weren&#39;t for those government benefits, my parents would be struggling to raise us,” she said. But now, many of her friends are Republican, and her view of the two parties had changed. “They&#39;re not protecting the rich,” she said, of the GOP, “they&#39;re protecting the wealth for people who actually earn it. It&#39;s the Republican Party that wants to protect the middle class. Democrats want to keep us low-income.” She had friends who were moving from Section 8 housing into their own homes, and she had begun to feel that government assistance “makes people lazy,” she said. Also, it was too complicated. When she&#39;d been laid off, she applied for unemployment, but doing so felt like a full-time job. Plus, she was navigating health care for her father, who&#39;d had a stroke. “I really wish our health-care system was like the Canadian system,” she said. “The taxes are higher and it&#39;s equal opportunity, instead of ours.” Ying Tan, like most Republicans, seems skeptical of nationalized health care: “You always have to watch when the government manages seniors&#39; and retirees&#39; health insurance,” she has said.&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;After the fund-raiser, Rosanne Li stood outside the restaurant with her mother. Both were buzzing from the event. Democrats were ruining the city, they agreed. In the schools, for instance, children were being exposed to homosexuality, Li said. Later, she tried to explain what worried her about this. “You know how my mother and I have a good relationship with each other? I don&#39;t want schools to indoctrinate kids to be homosexuals—that would break the relationship between the kid and their parent. The home and the family would be broken,” she said. “When I hear that some people who don&#39;t have a good relationship with their parents, whatever it is that caused them not to have”—she paused to think of the term, then switched to Cantonese—“a stable family, I don&#39;t want indoctrination to rock that stability.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;The maître d&#39; of New Choi Fook popped his head out of the door. “If you&#39;re going to be chatting outside, you might as well just come in and have some tea,” he said in Cantonese. The Lis thanked him but explained that they were headed home.

There&#39;s certainly not a lot of other things an unemployed, six-foot-tall vagina-clown can do. Start a podcast? Launch a wellness app? Snatch (Becca Blackwell) and their dear friend Tainty McCracken (Amanda Duarte) experience a flicker of confusion, but then the right idea strikes like a period on a day you&#39;re wearing white pants: air a TV talk show called “It&#39;s That Time of the Month,” which mashes together the best of Conan O&#39;Brien, “Pee-wee&#39;s Playhouse,” and performance artist Carolee Schneemann in her “Interior Scroll” era.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Heretofore, the comic and experimental performer Blackwell&#39;s best-known work was “They, Themself and Schmerm,” an immensely funny standup piece about their transition, which somehow got laughs out of stories about, among other things, childhood molestation. (“Schmerm” is the garbled sound a person might make when trying to say several pronouns at once.) Right before the pandemic shutdown—like, two days before—I saw Blackwell&#39;s chilled-out show “Schmermie&#39;s Choice,” at Joe&#39;s Pub, another autobiographical, standup-flavored set, which explored the giddiness of sex on testosterone, and the ways that various tab A&#39;s fit into various slot B&#39;s. Their latest work, “Snatch Adams &amp;amp; Tainty McCracken Present It&#39;s That Time of the Month,” at SoHo Rep, retains some of Blackwell&#39;s earlier shaggy-dog, low-fi vibe, but here the imagination and the glitz factor have been dialed up to &lt;em>;Versailles&lt;/em>;. This, at last, is Blackwell&#39;s magnum opus, or, to give the collaboratively devised piece its proper due, Blackwell and Duarte&#39;s magnum o-pussy.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Every Johnny needs an Ed, every Conan an Andy, so our host, Snatch—wearing a shell-pink yonic body-taco, complete with sequinned mucus membranes—bounces thoughts off Tainty, a crass, gonadal sidekick, who wears a mustache, two large, pendulous balls that dangle around his shoulders, and, on his head, an anus that resembles a ruched sofa cushion. (Amanda Villalobos did the original design for both of our leading genitalia.) The bantering pair sit at matching desks, though Snatch sometimes wanders into the crowd for some affirmative consent-style participation. The show feels loose and seemingly unscripted, though Blackwell and Duarte are credited as writers, and it was directed, thrillingly, by Jess Barbagallo. The trio&#39;s combined strength lies in creating and controlling a gently permissive queer mayhem, with Blackwell&#39;s soft-spoken diffidence giving way to Duarte&#39;s joke-swinging insult comedy. (Their respective affects are reminiscent of Big Bird and Oscar the Grouch.) “Oh, sure, let&#39;s make it about you,” Snatch said kindly, the night I saw it, when Tainty interrupted with comments about his temporarily missing penis. It wasn&#39;t mean, or even passive-aggressive; Snatch just loves to listen.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Snatch and Tainty&#39;s wonderful fake television show doesn&#39;t &lt;em>;air&lt;/em>;, exactly, so much as gestate inside a gorgeously baroque, pink-and-gilt set, designed by Greg Corbino, which features a chapel-size model of a lower body, with a throbbing, door-like vagina dead center, bracketed by huge golden legs. When guests on “It&#39;s That Time of the Month” visit with Snatch, they sit in ovary-shaped chairs that detach from two elaborate fallopian tubes glued to the wall; and when audience members compete in games, as in a race to figure out how to fasten a sanitary belt, or the hit-Snatch-with-a-herpes-sore challenge, they might stand on helpfully provided silicone blood-clot mats. (The Pyramid Club has closed in the East Village, but its sweet, sticky, pharaonic-splendor-made-from-trash spirit lives on.)&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;And hey, why &lt;em>;is&lt;/em>; it so rare to talk about menstruation? That squeamishness in our still-puritan public sphere takes on a specific menace when one considers, for example, that Florida legislators have tried to ban discussion of menarche at school. You can trace a direct line from fear about periods to the desire to regulate bodies and the ways they express themselves. Everyone on set certainly knows about that line. There&#39;s pain in Snatch&#39;s voice during a ripped-from-Jay-Leno-style bit about so-called “funny headlines”; they read several that refer to the increasing number of anti-trans and anti-abortion bills—and are not actually funny at all.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;When Blackwell, their hair pulled back and wearing street clothes, arrives as a guest of Snatch&#39;s show (this requires a quick-change and some magic by the video designer Nicholas Zeig-Owens), the tone pivots from high camp to candor. Blackwell performs a little standup but mostly focusses on telling us what they&#39;ve learned from their transition. “I lived successfully as a woman, now I live successfully as a man,” Blackwell says. “And, you know what, they&#39;re the same. Because &lt;em>;I&#39;m&lt;/em>; the same.” Certainly, a few of the folks in the audience had to be coached through a few basics, like the exact location of the clitoris, but Snatch and Tainty insist that it&#39;s actually quite easy to understand one another&#39;s holes and non-holes, as long as we&#39;re willing to stop attaching so much shame to them. And, gosh, imagine if this is what our late-night shows had been telling us all along. We leave the theatre through a narrow pink tunnel—and it&#39;s enough to make you feel reborn.&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Speaking of seeming binaries that shift and melt, a revival of Brian Friel&#39;s “Translations,” the first offering in a season devoted to work by the Irish dramatist at the Irish Repertory Theatre, is all about permeable boundaries—the lines between eras, countries, languages, and constructions of mind and identity. Friel&#39;s beautifully modulated drama, from 1980, takes place in 1833, in an Irish hedge school in Baile Beag (or Ballybeg). Such informal institutions were common, prior to the full nationalization of schools, as a response to the repression of Catholic education. In the tiny community of Baile Beag, lessons bend to the hedge teacher&#39;s whim—and, in this case, the white-bearded schoolmaster Hugh (Seán McGinley) loves the classics. His students work out their sums in chalk, or study maps, but they&#39;re also catechized in Latin and Greek, and his star pupil, the eccentric Jimmy Jack (John Keating) seems to live deep in myth itself, dreaming of a “flashing-eyed Athene,” the goddess who might, he says—half-joking, half-sure—come share his loneliness.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;91ogwm&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;twkqdd&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;But, of course, change is coming. Friel is unsubtle about this: the famine will arrive in just a few years, and characters are already worried about the possibility of blight. British soldiers with red coats and cut-glass accents come stomping into the school, unable to understand the Irish-speaking locals, eager to ascertain certain property lines so that taxes can be more efficiently collected. Hugh&#39;s sons are neatly split by dramaturgical necessity: Manus (Owen Campbell) is a caretaker son, gentle and dedicated to tradition, whereas the prodigal one, Owen (Seth Numrich), has thrown his lot in with the colonizing English-speakers, aiding in their surveying work by giving new, Anglicized names to the local rills and roads.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;feature-large-callout&quot; >;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;Seven actors performing in the play “Translations.”&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6543c90091280ec09e07c719/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/shaw-translations.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6543c90091280ec09e07c719/master/w_120,c_limit/shaw-translations.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6543c90091280ec09e07c719/master/w_240,c_limit/shaw-translations.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6543c90091280ec09e07c719/master/w_320,c_limit/shaw-translations.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6543c90091280ec09e07c719/master/w_640,c_limit/shaw-translations.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6543c90091280ec09e07c719/master/w_960,c_limit/shaw-translations.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6543c90091280ec09e07c719/master/w_1280,c_limit/shaw-translations.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6543c90091280ec09e07c719/master/w_1600,c_limit/shaw-translations.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;The hedge school of “Translations.”&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Photograph courtesy Carol Rosegg&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;In an effort to maximize the romance and erudition of lost-in-time Baile Beag, Friel has us believe that the soldiers can&#39;t understand the Latin spoken to them, even when Lieutenant Yolland (dashing Raffi Barsoumian) very much wants to hear what the local beauty Maire (Mary Wiseman) has to say. But surely any officer in the King&#39;s army would have been force-fed Virgil at school? Friel&#39;s larger point—one about the way words can make a world but cannot make a welcome—is one he paints in more delicate colors. Just as you&#39;ve been lulled into believing you&#39;re watching a jolly clash-of-cultures romance, tragedy rears up. We should have known from hearing so much of the Aeneid in his characters&#39; mouths: violence and heartbreak happens in that story also.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Doug Hughes directs an exquisite production. Charlie Corcoran&#39;s set, which is mostly a stretch of sky above a low grass hill, shimmers like nacre; Michael Gottlieb&#39;s lighting design, particularly in the play&#39;s final, stunning moment with Hugh, is finely shaded, before plunging into a spotlit darkness reminiscent of Caravaggio. The theatre at the Irish Rep is quite small, and the director keeps his company in severe check, so that even a drunken scene (Owen and Yolland swill poteen together) never rises to the level of a shout. This leashed quality amplifies Friel&#39;s affectionate and sorrowful characterizations, as well as his extraordinary tension, for instance, in the lovely, foolish seduction scene at the end of the first act. Yolland, speaking English, and Maire, whose lines are in English but whom we perceive as speaking Irish, can barely say “sorry” to each other without misunderstanding. Their actual exchange of troth must happen in glances, and then, ruinously, they are understood in a different way, when they&#39;re seen by a girl on the hill. This choreography of looks requires a thick atmosphere, in the same way a light beam needs smoke to be visible. Hughes and his tremendous cast fill the room with that atmosphere, to the point that we can almost see thoughts darting between people—or, as poor, blithe, almost-mad Jimmy Jack might, Athena brandishing her spear in the gray air. ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;lxyuj&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 04 Nov 2023 05:06:01 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Donald Trump’s Sons Get Challenged on the Witness Stand]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/donald-trumps-sons-get-challenged-on-the-witness-stand]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-03T19:52:14.351Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6545313df7a240dd4220b4d0/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Cassidy-Trump-sons-testify-11-03-23.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;article >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attribute-verso-pattern=&quot;article-body&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;ArticlePageChunks&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Given that bad things tend to happen to virtually anyone who comes into Donald Trump&#39;s orbit, it was only a matter of time before his own family members got dragged into the mire. This week, Donald, Jr., and Eric, Trump&#39;s eldest sons, appeared as defendants in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/some-lasting-lessons-from-a-dramatic-week-at-trumps-civil-trial&quot;>;civil fraud trial&lt;/a>; brought by the office of New York Attorney General &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/breaking-down-new-yorks-long-awaited-fraud-lawsuit-against-donald-trump&quot;>;Letitia James&lt;/a>;, and both sons repeatedly had their credibility impeached on the stand.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In the early years covered by the government&#39;s case, the brothers had independent roles at the Trump Organization—Donald, Jr., focussed on leasing and licensing deals; Eric worked on operations and new developments. But the testimony showed how they were also drawn into the web of deceit needed to sustain the myth that their father was a multibillionaire, which centered on the annual production of a Statement of Financial Condition that grossly exaggerated the value of Trump properties. Along with the former President himself and two former Trump Organization executives, the brothers stand accused of, among other things, engaging in a fraudulent conspiracy to file false business documents and engage in insurance fraud.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Donald, Jr., who, at forty-five, is six years older than Eric, took the stand first, on Wednesday afternoon. Under questioning from Colleen Faherty, an assistant attorney general, his manner was breezy and jovial. When Faherty asked him if he was familiar with the legal document that laid out the charges against him and the other defendants, he replied, “Vaguely, yes.” He insisted he had nothing to do with the Statements of Financial Condition, which Judge Arthur F. Engoron has already ruled fraudulent. The task of compiling these statements was left to the outside accounting firm &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/new-york-attorney-general-letitia-james-is-increasing-the-legal-pressure-on-donald-trump&quot;>;Mazars&lt;/a>;, Donald, Jr., testified, saying, “These people had incredible intimate knowledge, and I relied on them.” His own knowledge of accounting was limited to an introductory course that he took at business school years ago, he added.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;A potential problem with this buck-passing strategy was immediately clear to anybody who has been following the trial. Donald Bender, a former partner at Mazars who was responsible for the Statements of Financial Condition, has already testified that his firm merely collated valuation estimates for individual properties that the Trump Organization supplied. On Thursday morning, Faherty duly produced several documents that Donald, Jr., himself signed in his role as a trustee for the trust that his father established to run the business after he entered the White House. The documents included a “management representation” letter to Mazars from 2017—which assured the accounting firm that the Trump Organization&#39;s valuation estimates were reasonable and contained no material inaccuracies. Donald, Jr., tried to brush off this document as a “cover-your-butt” letter, in his words, but the damage had been done.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Faherty also produced evidence that, shortly before signing this letter, Donald, Jr., had been alerted to the fact that the valuation estimates that underpinned the Statements of Financial Condition greatly exaggerated the size of his father&#39;s penthouse at Trump Tower. The defendant blithely insisted that he relied on the Trump Organization&#39;s own accountants to vouch for the accuracy of anything that he signed.&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Eric Trump, who took over as chief executive of the Trump Organization when his father entered the White House in 2017, testified later on Thursday, and on Friday morning. Initially, he, too, insisted that he didn&#39;t have anything to do with the annual Statements of Financial Condition. But Andrew Amer, another assistant attorney general, produced a 2013 e-mail to him from Jeff McConney, the former Trump employee who put together a spreadsheet that purported to justify the inflated figures, asking for help valuing a Trump-owned estate in Westchester called Seven Springs. “So, you did know about your father&#39;s annual financial statement, as of August 20, 2013, didn&#39;t you?” Amer said to Eric, who replied, “It appears that way, yes.” Eric went on to concede that he sent financial information to McConney, but claimed he didn&#39;t know it was to be used in a Statement of Financial Condition. “I just don&#39;t think it would have registered,” he told the court.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;At one point, Eric said: “I pour concrete. I operate properties. I don&#39;t focus on appraisals.” But Amer also raised a 2021 video conference call involving Eric, his brother, and two Trump employees about that year&#39;s Statement of Financial Condition and a change in the methodology used to value some of Trump&#39;s golf courses. Although the video conference took place only a couple of years ago, and Eric was the CEO at the time, he claimed he had no memory of it. When Eric returned to the stand on Friday morning, the grilling continued. Amer showed him financial statements that he&#39;d signed in 2020 and 2021 for loans from Deutsche Bank, which contained inflated valuations. Eric used the same defense as his brother. “I relied on our accounting office,” he said. “I relied on one of the biggest accounting firms in the country, and I relied on a great legal team.”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;bwwzwx&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;c8kv5m&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;“Unbelievable. Eric testified today and basically just lost the entire case,” Mary Trump, the former President&#39;s estranged niece, tweeted out shortly after the proceedings on Thursday. That was an exaggeration. The central issue in the case was decided before the trial started, when Judge Engoron found the defendants liable for fraud and cancelled some of the Trump Organization&#39;s business licenses. The proceeding now relates to further charges and possible penalties, including a fine of up to two hundred and fifty million dollars and an order barring any of the defendants from running a business in New York.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Since Trump is seventy-seven years old, such an order would have a more lasting impact on his sons than on him, and their testimony didn&#39;t help their cause. In a video commentary about the trial that she posted online, Attorney General Letitia James pointed out some of the inconsistencies in the brothers&#39; testimony, and, noting that Trump himself will testify next week, she said, “We will not be bullied out of uncovering the truth.” Alina Habba, one of Trump&#39;s lawyers, had a very different reading of how the trial was going. Speaking outside the courthouse on Thursday, she called the case “the biggest waste of New York taxpayer dollars I have ever seen.” When the proceedings resume on Monday, Trump will be in the witness box. His daughter Ivanka will testify on Wednesday. ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;70yktc&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot;

Sybrina Fulton, the mother of Trayvon Martin, talks with David Remnick about the nationwide outcry over the killings of unarmed Black and brown people. A group of experts wrestle with the complicated question of how Black Lives Matter changed policing in the ten years since its founding and whether racial disparities among victims of police violence have abated at all. And the writer Nicole Sealey explains how the Ferguson, Missouri, protests over the death of Michael Brown led her to a response in poetry.&lt;/p>;&lt;h2 >;Sybrina Fulton: “Trayvon Martin Could Have Been Anybody&#39;s Son”&lt;/h2>;&lt;figure data-testid=&quot;IframeEmbed&quot;
