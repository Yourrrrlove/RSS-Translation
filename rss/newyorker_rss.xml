href=&quot;https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1707565081750290910&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;看看到底发生了什么&lt;/a >;。”在一封电子邮件中，&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/09/18/elon-musk-walter-isaacson-book-review&quot;>;马斯克最新的传记作者&lt;/a>;沃尔特·艾萨克森告诉我，这次访问是这位亿万富翁“史诗英雄情结”的另一个例子：马斯克相信他的关注将成为解决我们国家、全球和星际挑战的重要组成部分。但是，尽管马斯克声称客观，但他只是阐述了一个极其复杂的故事的一方面。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;在访问之前的几周，马斯克通过发布有关美国及其他地区移民挑战的评论和新闻报道来吸引他的追随者。他还与共和党国会议员托尼·冈萨雷斯进行了交谈，他的选区沿着墨西哥与德克萨斯州的边界，包括伊格尔帕斯。与冈萨雷斯通电话三天后，马斯克降落时穿着的一套服装让他看起来像一个普通的边境警长，但又有所不同：黑色斯泰森毡帽、黑色靴子、镜面飞行员太阳镜、黑色牛仔裤和黑色死亡空间 T-衬衫。冈萨雷斯在机场接他，马斯克的手机摄像头开始转动。他发布了三个独立的视频，指责边境附近的微弱信号迫使他停止并重新开始直播。最长的是在边境附近的一座桥下拍摄的，持续了十五分钟，展示了他与冈萨雷斯的谈话；麦地那县警长兰迪·布朗（共和党人）；拉萨尔县警长安东尼·泽图什（民主党人）；以及伊格尔帕斯市市长小罗兰多·萨利纳斯 (Rolando Salinas, Jr.)，他是一名民主党人，一直批评拜登总统处理移民和边境问题的做法。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;许多媒体将马斯克对伊格尔帕斯的访问描述为“公民新闻、 “这个词是马斯克自己用过的。与马斯克所说的“传统媒体”相反，公民新闻承诺提供无中介的信息流，让每个人都能在公共话语中发表意见，并对重要和真实的事情做出自己的判断。 “所以，我们在伊格尔帕斯，”公民记者马斯克说，“我们将与负责边境的主要官员和执法部门会面，你会直接从他们那里听到消息。”视频的其余部分显示，这些官员轮流分享他们的观点，他们的随行人员和一群由穿制服的官员带领的移民出现在背景中。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;布朗描述了他所说的拜登政府的“开放边境政策”、“非法分子”在本国和美国犯下的罪行（劫持火车、盗窃汽车、破坏私人财产），以及他“坚守阵线”的努力。冈萨雷斯谈到了过境者的“历史数字”以及目前被关押在拘留中心的数千人。马斯克指出，移民不仅仅来自墨西哥，而且边境已经成为“地球上所有人的开放边界”。 Zertuche 说，他遇到过来自洪都拉斯、萨尔瓦多、厄瓜多尔和古巴的移民，但很少遇到来自墨西哥的移民。&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Zertuche 补充说，在任何特定时刻，只有 16 名警察在拉萨尔县 1500 平方英里的范围内巡逻。 ，让他的办公室感到“不知所措”。萨利纳斯市长表示，伊格尔帕斯的医院也人满为患，导致当地人无法总能获得所需的护理。马斯克透露了有关边界的预设，他告诉观众，“如果人们想知道伊格尔帕斯是否是一个破败的小镇，那么它实际上非常干净和漂亮。”&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt; /div>;&lt;p>;在视频的最后，马斯克问冈萨雷斯，每年跨越边境的数百万移民中有多少人被送回家。冈萨雷斯回答说，只讨论那些从德尔里奥地区进入并直接返回的人，该地区沿边境绵延 245 英里，并表示这个数字为零。 “零是一个相当小的数字，”马斯克说，“所以，基本上，没有遣返。疯了吧。”最后，他思考了脸上有泪珠纹身的拉丁美洲帮派成员，声称他们代表了他们杀死的人数。他称他们为“连环杀人犯”，并表示美国不仅成为穷人的避难所，而且成为“你可以逃避法律的地方。”&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div 角色=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;可以肯定的是，马斯克居住的边境场景——直播内容是真实的，视频中的民选官员陈述了自己的观点，并提供了数字作为证据。但这并不意味着观众看到了全部真相。事实上，一些有关开放政策和移民回国的说法是不正确的。白宫新闻秘书卡琳·让-皮埃尔 (Karine Jean-Pierre) 在 10 月 2 日的新闻发布会上表示，拜登“仅自 5 月 12 日以来就向边境部署了更多部队和联邦特工，并遣返或遣返了超过 25 万人”。 （&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-political-scene/the-disillusionment-of-a-young-biden-official&quot;>;被退回的跨界者人数&lt;/a >; 自拜登上任以来前往拉丁美洲的人数要高得多：截至 2023 年 8 月为 360 万。）马斯克视频中看到的联邦官员与联邦军队不负责边境治安的观点并不相符。而且，正如国土安全部的新闻稿明确指出的那样，特工有时会试图通过将移民转移到人流量较少的地区来缓解人流量大的地区的压力，如果他们确定没有理由留在美国的话，他们被安排乘坐离开该国的航班。这就是边界“减压”的原理。此外，白宫记录显示，拜登总统和副总统卡马拉·哈里斯讨论了&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/06/19/bidens-dilemma-at-the-border&quot;与危地马拉、墨西哥、哥斯达黎加和哥伦比亚总统的>;边境执法&lt;/a>;。 2022 年 6 月，在洛杉矶举行的第九届美洲峰会上，他们和其他十几个拉丁美洲国家的领导人承诺“为返回最近居住或原籍国提供便利”。今年 6 月，拜登政府重申了这一承诺。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;每一次构建问题的努力都意味着将某些东西排除在人们的视野之外，而在这种情况下，马斯克的框架只从表面上考虑了保守派的论点。福克斯新闻对马斯克访问的报道一开始就由主持人凯莉·麦肯尼 (Kayleigh McEnany) 声称，“主流媒体——我想说的是自由派媒体——民主党和总统都忽视了我们南部边境日益严重的危机。”评论员托米·拉伦(Tomi Lahren)赞扬了马斯克，她称马斯克不是保守派，也不是共和党人，她说：“他这么做对他来说是件好事。”在与媒体成员的 Zoom 通话中，冈萨雷斯将马斯克描述为“一个带着扩音器的关心公民”。不过，问题在于马斯克的扩音器。当记者问冈萨雷斯，马斯克的访问是否“起到了推动作用”时，他回答说，每当视频“获得一亿次观看次数，你就在推动作用。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;马斯克的视频重复了与过去几十年来，关于边界的争论陷入了困境：各党派坚持他们关于边界的真相，不愿找到共同点来通过全面改革。然而，在某一时刻，他说了一些与共和党路线不同的言论。尽管共和党人长期以来一直表示，在为美国移民找到留在这里的途径之前需要先进行执法，但来自南非的移民马斯克&lt;a data-offer-url =“https://twitter.com” com/elonmusk/status/1707525800830828619&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1707525800830828619&quot;}&quot; href =&quot;https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1707525800830828619&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;说&lt;/a>;，“我非常支持移民，我相信我们非常需要扩大合法移民制度，我们应该让国内任何勤奋、诚实、愿意为美国做出贡献的人。我们应该加快对属于这一类别的任何人的法律批准。但出于同样的原因，如果有人违法，我们也不应该允许他们进入该国。”在那里，他听起来更像是老式共和党人，如罗纳德·里根或乔治·W·布什，他们赞成更宽松的移民政策，而不是像今天的共和党限制主义者。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;除了那一刻，马斯克错过了深入研究的机会边界辩论的复杂性。如果马斯克愿意的话，他可以与那些不知疲倦地为客户辩护的移民律师交谈，尽管他知道他们的许多留在美国的申请将被拒绝。他本可以展示熙熙攘攘的边境城镇，其中最明显的过境者是进入墨西哥吃饭、看病或购买艺术品的美国公民，以及前往北方购物、工作和上学的墨西哥公民。他本可以展示无证农业和服装工人为我们的衣食而辛勤劳作，或者环境、政治和经济灾难导致移民做出艰难的决定，背井离乡，拆散家庭。这些也是关于边界的未经过滤的真相。它们不会削弱马斯克的观点，即存在一个需要解决的问题，但它们会让他的数百万追随者更好地了解手头任务的严重性。 ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot;

data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker. com/tag/donald-trump&quot;>;唐纳德·特朗普&lt;/a>;于周三下午离开纽约，飞往佛罗里达州纽约县法院，特朗普、他的两个儿子和他的两名前高管在那里受到指控&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/the-trump-legal-show-might-be-in-town-until-christmas&quot;>;民事欺诈案&lt;/a>;—平静多了。星期四早上，审判进入第四天，当我到达中央街 60 号时，外面只有一台电视摄像机；只有一台摄像机。此前，已有十多个。特朗普曾多次在 300 法庭外指责法官和检察官，称此案为“骗局”和“骗局”，但临时搭建的新闻笔却空无一人。法庭本身远未满员。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;特朗普并不是唯一值得注意的缺席者。那天早上，他的首席律师克里斯·基斯（Chris Kise）也不在场。但提起此案的纽约总检察长利蒂西亚·詹姆斯(Letitia James)坐在观众区的前排。连续第四天出庭的还有唐纳德·本德 (Donald Bender)，他最近从玛泽会计师事务所退休，该事务所多年来一直负责编制特朗普集团臭名昭著的年度“财务状况报表”，该报表据称显示了特朗普集团的财务状况。特朗普是一位真正的亿万富翁。在阿瑟·F·恩戈伦法官最终让本德下台后，特朗普集团前主计长杰弗里·麦康尼接替了他，他帮助整理了玛泽用来编制“SOFC”（法庭上所说的“SOFC”）的文件。 .&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;在审前裁决中，恩戈龙法官同意詹姆斯办公室的观点，即被告持续夸大特朗普资产的价值，并称根据纽约长期法规《行政法 63》，这构成欺诈。还有六项索赔需要法院裁决，包括伪造业务记录、发布虚假财务报表和保险欺诈。总检察长办公室还要求法院禁止特朗普及其儿子在纽约经营企业，并处以高达 2.5 亿美元的罚款。恩戈隆表示，为了让政府证明其余的主张，它必须证明两件事：被告的行为是有意图的，而且他们的行为是实质性的——他们的夸大其词很严重。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;在其他方面也就是说，仍有一些重大问题需要根据双方提供的证词和文件证据来决定。特朗普当然不想被赶出纽约或被处以巨额罚款，他的律师正在努力阻止这种情况发生。但是，即使在前总统缺席的情况下，审判仍在他利用审判达到政治目的以及攻击该国一些基本机构（包括刑事司法系统）的阴影下进行。周四，他在社交媒体网站 Truth Social 上发帖称：“这件荒谬的诉讼应该立即撤销。上诉部门应该进行调解。这些人，像杰克·史密斯一样，都疯了！”&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;麦康尼是下一个出庭作证的人，他被传唤为政府证人，但他也是该案的被告。他身材魁梧，肩膀宽阔，一头白发，一张红脸。他作证说，他于 1978 年毕业于巴鲁克学院，获得会计学位，并于 1987 年加入特朗普集团，一直工作到今年早些时候，带着 50 万美元的遣散费退休。总检察长办公室的律师安德鲁·阿梅尔（Andrew Amer）问他是否已经收到这笔钱。麦康尼说，他已经收到了三十七万五千美元，剩下的十二万五千美元还没有支付。阿梅尔不那么天真地问道，最终付款是否取决于什么。 “不，除了我还活着，”麦康尼回答道。&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt; /div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;在进一步询问下，麦康尼表示，SOFC 通常是在 10 月份准备的，并且根据特朗普集团银行贷款所附的契约，法律要求将它们提交给贷款人以年度为基础。阿米尔还让麦康尼同意，根据玛泽与特朗普集团订婚信的条款，特朗普有责任确保向会计师事务所提供的财务信息的准确性和完整性。在 2014 年 SOFC 草案中，麦康尼写下了“DJT 以获得最终审查”。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;随后，阿米尔详细询问了麦康尼关于特朗普大厦三层公寓 SOFC 估值的基础，该估值基础从 2011 年的 8000 万美元到 2012 年的 1.8 亿美元，再到 2013 年的 2 亿美元。麦康尼表示，在 2012 年的估值中，他使用另一座特朗普大楼的公寓要价 240 美元作为“补偿”。位于上西区的河滨大道，售价为七千五百万美元。 （它后来以三千万美元的价格售出。）阿米尔问麦康尼，使用售价而不是要价是否不是评估房地产价值的“正确方法”。黄濑在午休后重新出现，打着领结，他反对这个问题，称这道出了辩方案件的全部症结所在——没有一种正确的评估方法。恩戈隆法官驳回了这一反对意见，平静地说：“我认为高中生知道正确的方法。”当阿米尔再次问麦康尼这个问题时，他回答说：“不。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;尽管遭到拒绝，黄濑仍然反对这一连串的提问。有一次，他引起了阿米尔的愤怒反驳，阿米尔指责他试图用冗长的反对意见来教育证人。特朗普的律师是佛罗里达州前副检察长，有趣的是，他还是佛罗里达州州长罗恩·德桑蒂斯的前过渡顾问，他在周五早上宣布辩方将要求上诉法院停止审判，从而引发了另一场混乱。并维持恩戈伦关于特朗普及其同案被告应对欺诈负责的裁决。愤怒的阿梅尔表示，凯瑟没有向法院或政府充分通知这一举动。恩戈隆同意他的观点。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;上诉法院似乎不太可能在中途暂停由资深法官监督的审判，但特朗普的律师似乎有义务提出不太可能的动议。周四，代表前总统的律师约翰·劳罗 (John Lauro) 和托德·布兰奇 (Todd Blanche) 反对&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/the-mind-bending-world-of-trump -his-indictments-and-the-2024-election&quot;>;联邦指控他密谋阻止 2020 年大选后合法的权力移交，要求美国地区法官 Tanya Chutkan 驳回该案，理由是：特朗普的行为属于其总统职责范围，不能作为起诉的依据。如果查特坎的裁决对特朗普不利，他将不可避免地向他的顽固支持者提供进一步的证据，证明他是党派政治迫害的无辜受害者。这是特朗普正在玩的破坏性游戏，他的律师似乎很乐意（或至少愿意）配合它。周五早上，黄濑和他的同事向纽约上诉法院提交了动议。在恩戈伦法官的法庭上，麦康尼回到了证人席。 ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot;

The film pits morality against legality. Anne&#39;s breaches of trust and responsibility are grievous, but she is committing neither incest nor statutory rape; Théo is neither her biological child nor her adopted one, and he has reached the age of consent. The tale is set in an haut-bourgeois paradise that seems to be rotting from within. Anne lives in a lavish home in the Paris suburbs with her husband, Pierre (Olivier Rabourdin), a prosperous businessman whose business is facing an intrusive tax audit, and their two adoptive daughters. Théo has been living in Geneva with his mother, Pierre&#39;s ex-wife, but his parents move him to Paris after he is suspended from school for assaulting a teacher. The truculent and diffident teen-ager, all floppy hair and hormones, disruptively acts out his frustrations, while nonetheless becoming a good big brother to the two girls; meanwhile, his sparks of playful flirtation with Anne ignite an uncontrollable conflagration of desire. Anne, remorseful and fearful, swears Théo to secrecy, but the coverup quickly becomes the bigger and better drama: a conflict of terrifying intensity and bitter irony, taut with emotional violence and looming menace.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;In the French press, Breillat has been accused of &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.lesinrocks.com/cinema/pour-christine-angot-lete-dernier-de-catherine-breillat-presente-une-esthetisation-de-linceste-595057-22-09-2023/&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.lesinrocks.com/cinema/pour-christine-angot-lete-dernier-de-catherine-breillat-presente-une-esthetisation-de-linceste-595057-22-09-2023/&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.lesinrocks.com/cinema/pour-christine-angot-lete-dernier-de-catherine-breillat-presente-une-esthetisation-de-linceste-595057-22-09-2023/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;casting an approving eye&lt;/a>; on a quasi-incestuous relationship, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lemonde.fr/culture/article/2023/09/16/catherine-breillat-realisatrice-de-l-ete-dernier-je-n-ai-jamais-reussi-a-devenir-adulte-ca-m-ennuie-trop_6189675_3246.html&quot;>;her remarks&lt;/a>; in interviews confirm that she is vocal in her defense of consensual passions that defy conventional mores. But her remarks are beside the point. For a start, viewers shouldn&#39;t need any finger-wagging by Breillat, in drama or in statements, at her characters&#39; behavior in order to form their own view of the matter. More important, the anguish, the fury, and the deceit that the affair unleashes—and the pitiless precision with which Breillat films them—provide a surer and clearer judgment on the action. Indeed, the freedom of a movie to escape from its director&#39;s intentions is a prime mark of artistic inspiration.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;feature-large-callout&quot; >;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;A woman in the backseat of a black car.&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/652071fd72931f9be6060288/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Brody-A24_Priscilla_VeniceFinal.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/652071fd72931f9be6060288/master/w_120,c_limit/Brody-A24_Priscilla_VeniceFinal.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/652071fd72931f9be6060288/master/w_240,c_limit/Brody-A24_Priscilla_VeniceFinal.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/652071fd72931f9be6060288/master/w_320,c_limit/Brody-A24_Priscilla_VeniceFinal.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/652071fd72931f9be6060288/master/w_640,c_limit/Brody-A24_Priscilla_VeniceFinal.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/652071fd72931f9be6060288/master/w_960,c_limit/Brody-A24_Priscilla_VeniceFinal.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/652071fd72931f9be6060288/master/w_1280,c_limit/Brody-A24_Priscilla_VeniceFinal.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/652071fd72931f9be6060288/master/w_1600,c_limit/Brody-A24_Priscilla_VeniceFinal.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;“Priscilla.”&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Photograph courtesy A24&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Sofia Coppola&#39;s new film, “Priscilla,” screening tonight, October 8th, and October 15th, is a sombre and calmly indignant drama, a modern American follow-up to her 2006 film “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/the-front-row-marie-antoinette&quot;>;Marie Antoinette&lt;/a>;.” The differences between the films are in a way embedded in the drama and the style of the new one, which follows Priscilla Beaulieu (Cailee Spaeny) from her meeting—as a ninth-grader on a US Army base in Wiesbaden, in 1959—with Elvis Presley (Jacob Elordi) through their courtship, her move to Graceland, and their marriage, which ended in 1973. The fourteen-year-old Priscilla, though unsurprisingly starstruck, wasn&#39;t so much smitten with Elvis as bewildered by the intensity of the attachment that this world-famous man ten years her senior displayed. She was also desperately homesick for the US and thrilled by the exciting new world that the relationship opened up to her. Yet, far from liberating her, her entry into his vortex of fame merely transferred her from the control of her father (Ari Cohen), an Air Force officer, to the control of Elvis—and, when Elvis wasn&#39;t around, of his father, Vernon (Tim Post). Living in Graceland with Elvis and his entourage, she&#39;s seen to have even less freedom than an average teen. Elvis doesn&#39;t let her take a part-time job in a local boutique, declaring that she has to choose between him and her “career”: “When I call, I need you to be there for me.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Elvis quickly initiates Priscilla to pills—pills to stay awake, pills to sleep—and his nocturnal life, with its endless round of parties, leaves her little time or energy for school. Thus she doesn&#39;t get much of an education, and, as an adult, Priscilla also has less activity, less experience, and less first-hand knowledge of life at large than most people her age. All she has is “everything”: she can shop to her heart&#39;s content, but Elvis quashes and controls even her taste. The movie doesn&#39;t look hard at Elvis&#39;s music, because Priscilla doesn&#39;t, either—and because the one time she does try to express herself on the subject, he throws a heavy object at her. (The movie, written by Coppola and based on a memoir by Priscilla Presley, also emphasizes Elvis&#39;s frustrations—notably, his thwarted ambitions to study at the Actors Studio and seek a serious movie career akin to that of Marlon Brando or James Dean.)&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;When Coppola unleashes images of rarefied style, as in a melancholy zoom back that leaves Priscilla trapped in a window frame of the Graceland mansion, they hit hard, but, in general, “Priscilla” doesn&#39;t have the style of “Marie Antoinette.” And that is the point: Priscilla herself doesn&#39;t have the style of Marie Antoinette, and through no fault of her own. At least the Queen of France had a foundation of noblesse-oblige training on which to build her ruinous glories of high style and fashion. “Priscilla,” however, is a flat smack of a confrontation with a male-supremacist culture—abetted by a consumerist one—that produces an emptied-out life. The music that her husband performs and that brings him fame is inseparable from the hard-partying boys&#39; club of his entourage. This, too, is a preoccupation of “Priscilla” and a source of its overwhelming sense of loss. Who is the female Elvis? The fact that one has to even think about it is, in effect, the subject of Coppola&#39;s film. ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot;

Garcinuno / Getty&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;On August 16th, fifty-three years after his musical début in New York City, Rubén Blades filled Manhattan&#39;s fourth-largest theatre, the United Palace, in Washington Heights, with a concert that offered a retrospective of his career. What drove him through those fifty-three years is also the matter of his forthcoming autobiography, to be published by Knopf. Its tentative title is “Life Is Full of Surprises,” a line from his song “Pedro Navaja,” which is arguably the most popular salsa song of all time. The title seems appropriate: his life and work are surprisingly eclectic. But the biggest surprise of his long, prolific career is that Blades, a major figure of New York City&#39;s cultural life for more than half a century, who brought a New York-born musical style to the world at large, has still not been accepted into the American canon.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;A singer and songwriter, the winner of eleven Grammys and eleven Latin Grammys, Blades transformed salsa, the Afro-Caribbean dance music developed in New York City in the nineteen-sixties, by making it a vehicle for stories with a social-justice and anticolonial slant. Blades “is just as significant as Víctor Jara, Bob Dylan, Bob Marley in terms of writing about social-justice issues and where society needs to be better,” Félix Contreras, the co-creator and host of “Alt.Latino,” NPR&#39;s show on Latin music since 2010, told me. “In fact, he is probably even more powerful, because he is speaking for a whole continent.” “His songs captured the everyday life of New York Latinos and all Latin Americans,” Frances Aparicio, a former director of the Latina and Latino Studies program at Northwestern University and the author of “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Listening-Salsa-Popular-Cultures-Culture/dp/0819563080&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Listening-Salsa-Popular-Cultures-Culture/dp/0819563080&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Listening-Salsa-Popular-Cultures-Culture/dp/0819563080&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;Listening to Salsa&lt;/a>;,” told me. Blades is a major Latino cultural figure in New York City, where he has resided most of his life, and also a well-known political figure in his native country of Panama. And yet, Aparicio told me, “Anglo America doesn&#39;t see him.” In that sense, she said, he embodies Latinos&#39; “struggles to find success in this country.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The son of a Cuban mother, herself a singer and an actress, and a Colombian father (a detective who worked with the US Drug Enforcement Agency in Panama, according to his son), Blades was a student at Universidad Nacional de Panamá when a military coup shut down the school, in 1968. Blades has often told the story of how his mother, fearing that he&#39;d join an opposition movement, sent him to New York as a birthday present. His family didn&#39;t have the money for a ticket, but his brother, who worked for Pan American, got him on a plane at a discounted rate. And a Cuban singer who was a friend of the family provided him with a letter to take to the Edison Hotel, on West Forty-seventh Street, to get a cheap room.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In Panama City, Blades had met Pancho Cristal, a major Latin-music producer from New York, during a recording session. Blades, who began singing with local bands when he was in high school, was filling in for another singer. Impressed, Cristal suggested that Blades should look for him if he was ever in New York to record an album. Blades did, which led to his first album, “From Panama to New York.” Recorded in three weeks of 1969, when he was twenty-one, it was not a big hit. Still, it introduced the element that would make Blades one of the most influential figures in salsa. The first song, “Juan González,” tells of a military patrol in an unnamed country that comes into a town bearing news that they killed a guerrilla fighter during an ambush in a ravine. Salsa typically deals with subjects such as masculinity, poverty, and street crime—sometimes with humor. Songs written as short stories about the political struggles of Latin Americans were unheard of.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Blades went back to Panama, getting a degree in law and political science when the university reopened, but he settled in New York City in 1974, when it seemed headed toward bankruptcy. “It smelled of trash, tobacco, and diesel. It was a dangerous city,” Blades remembered. But it was also a vibrant center of “salsa and jazz, and the punk-rock movement was beginning to make its noise. It was a wonderful place to be. Also, it was cheap.” A Panamanian law degree was of no use, so he got a job in the mailroom at Fania Records, the label at the center of Latin music at the time. He took his guitar to work every day, hoping for a chance to impress somebody. He eventually met Ray Barreto, a leading figure in the early salsa scene, who was looking for a singer. Blades said that Barreto interrogated him “for an hour, trying to understand what a lawyer was doing in the mailroom.” Finally, he agreed to give him an audition, and Blades was hired as a singer. Not long afterward, Blades started a years-long collaboration with the trombonist and bandleader Willie Colón, another salsa pioneer, whose albums sold tens of thousands of copies. Colón&#39;s stardom offered Blades a platform solid enough to boldly break with the conventional. (They fell out in 2007 when Colón sued Blades for breach of contract; a legal battle followed, resulting in decisions in Blades&#39;s favor.)&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;A voracious reader since an early age, and a poet in high school, Blades had always seen himself as a storyteller. A storyteller is born, he told me, “when you are young and your mother asks you who broke the glass, and you don&#39;t tell the truth, you tell the story.” His characters “are just as vivid and powerful as those of any Latin American novelist,” Contreras told me. The song “Pablo Pueblo” (“Pablo the People”), for example, tells of a poor man who comes home feeling tired and defeated after a long day&#39;s work. The politicians who promised change had proved to be disappointments. “Until when?” will he have to live this way, he asks himself, before falling asleep hungry. “Pedro Navaja” is about a criminal who attacks a sex worker in the street; he stabs her, but she has a gun, and shoots him. They both die, and a drunk passerby takes the gun, the knife, and the “two pesos” they were carrying. The chorus is: “Life is full of surprises.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Blades has written songs about the materialism of society (“Plástico”), the murder of the Salvadoran Archbishop Óscar Romero (“El Padre Antonio y Su Monaguillo Andrés”), a white upper-class woman who falls in love with a Black working-class musician (“Ligia Elena”), the disappeared people of Latin America (“Desapariciones”), and US imperialism (“Tiburón,” or “Shark”). Some of his songs were banned by repressive regimes in Latin America (including in Panama) and by Cuban radio shows in Florida, where “Tiburón” was labelled as pro-Communist.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Blades said that he was aware that he was creating “something that did not exist at the time.” He saw the “incredible opportunity” of having two strangers close to each other on the dance floor (salsa is a contact dance) suddenly “sharing common ground.” So he told them stories that mattered, about their mother or their country, about politics, race, and their daily lives. Several of his songs were too long for the usual commercial requirements of radio: “Pablo Pueblo” is more than six minutes long; “Pedro Navaja,” more than seven. Fania agreed to release “Siembra” (1978), the album that “Pedro Navaja” is on, only because Colón played on it. They feared a flop; they said that it would be “Willie Colón&#39;s commercial death,” Blades said. Instead, it became one of the best-selling salsa albums of all time. For the past forty-five years, Blades has sung the songs from “Siembra” in stadiums and concert halls around the world; when he gets to the chorus of “Pedro Navaja,” the crowds sing, “Life is full of surprises.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Earlier this year, Lin-Manuel Miranda talked to &lt;em>;Rolling Stone&lt;/em>; about the impact of hearing Blades&#39;s songs for the first time. He realized that “you can write a tasty hook, you can write incredibly complex rhythms, and you can be telling a story all at the same time. I really don&#39;t know of any other Latin writers who staked out so much territory for what can be a song. It&#39;s like if you listen to pop music on the radio your whole life, and then you hear Randy Newman and go, &#39;Oh, my God, it can also be &lt;em>;that&lt;/em>;.&#39; ”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;9zb8w&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;w1qwfp&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Just as Blades didn&#39;t feel constrained by the conventions of salsa, he never felt limited by genre or language. In 1988, he released an album, “Nothing But the Truth,” his only entirely in English, that included two songs with Lou Reed, two with Elvis Costello, and one with Sting. He also recorded a beautiful, up-tempo version of the Beatles&#39; “Baby&#39;s in Black” (on the 1992 album “Amor y Control.”) He&#39;s had a long and fruitful collaboration with jazz musicians, and has recorded songs popularized by Frank Sinatra and Tony Bennett. “I wanted to do something that would make them smile and go, &#39;Oh, that&#39;s a nice switch,&#39; ” he told me. He rearranged a few of their songs, changing some of the lyrics, and recorded them with Roberto Delgado and his (salsa) Orchestra for an album released in 2021 called “Salswing!” It features, Blades said, “The best version of “Pennies from Heaven” that I&#39;ve ever heard.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;And yet, in spite of all these efforts, Blades has never been entirely accepted by Anglo audiences in the United States. A main obstacle has been language. “Given the central role of his songs as sites for storytelling,” Aparicio told me, “monolingual Anglo listeners clearly miss the rich social content and references of his songs, with which Latinos and Latin Americans identify strongly. In the nineteen-seventies and eighties, Spanish was still considered a domestic language, to be used at home within the intimate spaces of family, friends, and community, but not appropriate for the larger public spaces in urban areas.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In search of different types of recognition, perhaps, Blades graduated from Harvard Law School in 1985, and he also began acting. He has appeared in about forty movies, including “The Milagro Beanfield War” (1988), “Mo&#39; Better Blues” (1990), “The Super” (1991), “Once Upon a Time in Mexico” (2003), “Safe House” (2012), “The Counselor” (2013), and “Hands of Stone” (2016), working with directors such as Robert Redford, Robert Rodríguez, and Spike Lee, and actors including Antonio Banderas, Denzel Washington, Sonia Braga, and Penélope Cruz.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;His attempts to reach different audiences were not without tensions. “He really struggled with crossover,” Aparicio said. “His own individual figure did not always follow the expectation of working-class musicians in New York. He was Panamanian, white, Harvard-educated. He opened the doors of salsa to be more accepted by all kinds of classes in Latin America. And, at the same time, he connects with the working-class Latino New York.” Interestingly, one of Blades&#39;s first movies, “Crossover Dreams” (1985), tells the story of Rudy Veloz, whom the &lt;em>;Times&lt;/em>; described as “a popular singer from East Harlem who tries and fails to &#39;cross over&#39; from the Latin music market into the mainstream of American pop.” Veloz abandons his barrio and his girlfriend to pursue his ambition, but fails, and returns to East Harlem and Latin music.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In between projects, Blades also spent years in Panama, where he ran for President in 1994. He told me he did it to send a message to young Panamanians, who didn&#39;t get involved in politics because it was corrupt: “It&#39;s corrupt because people like us don&#39;t participate,” he said. (“Pablo Pueblo” was one of his campaign songs.) He got seventeen per cent of the vote. Then, from 2004 to 2009, he served as the minister of tourism in the center-left administration of President Martín Torrijos. A few years later, wanting to come back into the spotlight—“people were asking, &#39;Is he dead?&#39; ” Blades said, with a laugh—he took a role in “Fear the Walking Dead,” a post-apocalyptic zombie show that streams on AMC. He played Daniel Salazar, a Salvadoran killer trained by the CIA The series has been broadcast worldwide, and has brought him another new audience. “All of a sudden, you have somebody in Nigeria who doesn&#39;t know about &#39;Pedro Navaja,&#39; who goes, &#39;Daniel Salazar sings!&#39; ” Blades said.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;At seventy-five, he&#39;s still making music, and collaborating with younger artists. Following an earlier project with the Puerto Rican group Calle 13 (“La Perla”), in the past couple of years he has recorded with the Mexican singer-songwriter Natalia Lafourcade (“Tú Sí Sabes Quererme”), and the Uruguayan Jorge Drexler, whose eclectic music is rooted in Río de la Plata rhythms (“El Plan Maestro”). In 2021, Blades heard about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-boys-making-beautiful-quarantine-songs-on-a-barcelona-rooftop&quot;>;three Spanish roommates who formed a trio&lt;/a>; during the first &lt;em >;COVID&lt;/em>; lockdown in that country. They called themselves Stay Homas, and recorded songs on their terrace in Barcelona, sometimes improvising with a glass bottle and a plastic bucket, then uploaded them to social media. Blades proposed a collaboration, and joined them from New York, via cellphone, to record “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=stay+homas+es+por+ti+ruben+blades&amp;amp;oq=stay+homas+es+por+ti+ruben+blades&amp;amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j33i160l2.4614j0j7&amp;amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8#fpstate=ive&amp;amp;vld=cid:7508d740,vid:L5UjgFSS0dM&quot;>;Es por Tí&lt;/a>;” in June, 2021. (Stay Homas has since released two albums and toured across Europe.)&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Blades says that he wants to make sure he spends his time “playing all kinds of music” and that he has “more and more time to be able to expand” on what he wants to play and to say. He wished concerts could be longer—the standard, he said, is ninety minutes. “I&#39;m always hoping that I get at least two hours,” he told me. His book manuscript is on the long side, too: more than four hundred pages, that end “with a question mark, because my life is not over.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;But these times are different. To begin with, the Latinx population is now almost twenty per cent of the country, up from five per cent when Blades started his career, in the seventies. The crossover from Latin music to mainstream seems much more likely—although Blades told me that he rejects that term, because “crossing over implies you have to leave something behind.” Aparicio noted that “today, the global popularity of Bad Bunny, Rosalía, J Balvin, and Maluma, among other reggaetoneros and pop singers who sing in Spanish, may be explained by the demographic growth of bilingual Latinx youth.” Contreras sees Blades as a pioneer. “I think time has caught up with him,” he told me. “Rosalía and Bad Bunny and everybody else have him to thank for making that stand and being popular.” ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;uk6qv2&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 07 Oct 2023 03:06:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Al Gore Doesn’t Say I Told You So]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.newyorker.com/news/q-and-a/al-gore-doesnt-say-i-told-you-so]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-06T19:00:00.000Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65200fc12cbf5c2898f490f8/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Remnick-Gore-BW.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;article >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attribute-verso-pattern=&quot;article-body&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;ArticlePageChunks&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;There was always the possibility that Al Gore, after making the hideously painful decision to concede the contested 2000 Presidential election to George W. Bush, would have to live out the remainder of his life as both a tragic loser and a tragic hero—someone who stood down in the name of the orderly transition of power. Gore resisted self-pity by projecting mordant good humor. “Hi, I&#39;m Al Gore,” he would tell audiences. “I used to be the next President of the United States.” Or, in slightly darker moods, he&#39;d say, “You know the old saying: you win some, you lose some—and then there&#39;s that little-known third category.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In the years to come, Gore made targeted criticisms of the Bush Administration—particularly of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tag/iraq-war&quot;>;war in Iraq&lt;/a>;—and became a kind of evangelist on the issue of climate change. His interest in ecological issues was evident as early as 1976, when he was elected to Congress as a young Democrat from Tennessee; in 1992, he published “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Earth-Balance-Ecology-Human-Spirit/dp/B0017U74TW&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Earth-Balance-Ecology-Human-Spirit/dp/B0017U74TW&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Earth-Balance-Ecology-Human-Spirit/dp/B0017U74TW&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;Earth in the Balance&lt;/a>;,” which called for a “Global Marshall Plan” to protect the environment.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In 2006, instead of seeking some other political office, he collaborated with the writer and director Davis Guggenheim on the film “An Inconvenient Truth,” delivering a kind of lecture-with-slides on the environmental disasters that the world would face if people and governments remained indifferent to the price of burning fossil fuels. In 2007, Gore and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change were together awarded the Nobel Prize for Peace, “for their efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man-made climate change.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Gore is an investor in green-technology businesses—a fact that regularly provokes criticism for alleged conflicts of interest—and he continues to write about the threat of climate change; promote the work of nonprofits, such as the Climate Reality Project and Climate &lt;em >;TRACE&lt;/em>;; and, generally, campaign for governments, institutions, and individuals to act to prevent the worst.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Recently, as the warmest summer in recorded history was coming to an end, I spoke with Gore, who was in New York while the UN General Assembly was meeting. During our conversation, which has been edited for length and clarity, the former Vice-President discussed the fossil-fuel industry&#39;s influence in politics, the UN&#39;s climate efforts, and his hopes for America&#39;s political will. Gore is seventy-five and lives in Nashville and also, as he put it, “on the road.” Our conversation also appears on &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://link.chtbl.com/qOucM248&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://link.chtbl.com/qOucM248&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://link.chtbl.com/qOucM248&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;The New Yorker Radio Hour&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;Well, here we are. The last time I saw you, you came to &lt;em>;The New Yorker&lt;/em>; and Condé Nast to talk about climate—this was probably ten years ago. And you were in the mode of warning, pushing, just as you had even years before, with “An Inconvenient Truth.” And now we&#39;re through the summer of 2023, and anybody has to recognize that this is not a matter of the future—this is a matter of now. The climate crisis is now. We&#39;re living in it. How do you assess what you saw—what we all saw—in the summer, all across the world?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Well, as you say, it now seems obvious to almost everyone that the severity of the crisis has reached a new level of intensity. Climate-related extreme events have become so common and so dangerous that people who wanted to dismiss it are now waking up to the reality that we&#39;re facing. And, of course, the underlying substance is shocking. We&#39;re still using the sky as an open sewer for the heat-trapping, gaseous pollution that we spew into it at the rate of a hundred and sixty-two million tons every single day. And we know how to solve it. We have the means to solve it. I&#39;ve used the metaphor of flipping a switch, and some people have objected to that. But, really, we have a switch we can flip.&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;Describe what the switch is, what the political means are, and what stands in the way.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The climate crisis is really a fossil-fuel crisis. There are other components of it, for sure, but eighty per cent of it is the burning of fossil fuels. And scientists now know—and this is a relatively new finding, a very firm understanding—that, once we stop net additions to the overburden of greenhouse gases, once we reach so-called net zero, then temperatures on Earth will stop going up almost immediately. The lag time is as little as three to five years. They used to think that temperatures would keep on worsening because of positive-feedback loops—and some things, tragically, will. The melting of the ice, for example, will continue, though we can moderate the pace of that; the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/05/20/climate-change-and-the-new-age-of-extinction&quot;>;extinction crisis&lt;/a>; will continue without other major changes. But we can stop temperatures from going up almost immediately, and that&#39;s the switch we need to flip. And then, if we can stay at true net zero, half of all human-caused greenhouse-gas pollution will fall out of the atmosphere in twenty-five to thirty years. So we can start the long and slow healing process almost immediately, if we act.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;What&#39;s required?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;We have to find a way to shift out of our dependence on fossil fuels: coal, oil, and gas. And, of course, the fossil-fuel industry, and the financial institutions that have grown codependent on them—&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;The banks—&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The banks and the other large lenders, and associated industries, have, for more than a hundred years, built up a legacy network of political and economic influence. Shockingly, they have managed to convert their economic power into political power with lobbying, and campaign contributions, and the revolving-door phenomenon—where fossil-fuel executives go into the government.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I mean, the last President of the United States made the CEO of ExxonMobil the Secretary of State. It&#39;s almost hard to believe, but that is a symbol of how fossil-fuel companies have penetrated governments around the world. When ExxonMobil or Chevron puts its ads on the air, the purpose is not for a husband and wife to say, “Oh, let&#39;s go down to the store and buy some motor oil.” The purpose is to condition the political space so that they have a continued license to keep producing and selling more and more fossil fuels.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;Well, you&#39;re not only an evangelist for climate change; you also are a politician, a seasoned politician.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I&#39;m a recovering politician.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;You&#39;re looking better already. Tell me, why is it impossible for politicians to run on this successfully? What are the barriers preventing a day-to-day politician, on the state or national level, from making this an effective electoral cause?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The polluters have gained a high degree of control over the processes of self-government. I&#39;ve often said that, in order to solve the crisis, we have to pay a lot of attention to the democracy crisis. Our representative democracy is not working very well. We have a dual hegemonic ideology called democratic capitalism, and the democracy part of our ideology has been cannibalized, to some extent, by economic actors, who have found ways to convert wealth into political influence. Wealth has always had its usefulness in the political sphere, but much more so in an era in which the candidate who raises the most money, and can buy the most media presence, almost always wins the election. And there&#39;s been kind of evolutionary pressure as to people who go into politics: people who don&#39;t want to put up with that kind of routine shy away from it now. Those who like it are more likely to run and get elected.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;0g7q9g&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;495kuu&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;It seems to me that, until alternative energy sources are cheap enough and ubiquitous enough to overcome the price and ubiquity of fossil fuels, you&#39;re always going to have a problem. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/essay/in-a-world-on-fire-stop-burning-things&quot;>;Bill McKibben&lt;/a>; will argue—as you do, I think—that those sources of energy are around, and, no matter what you may think of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/09/18/elon-musk-walter-isaacson-book-review&quot;>;Elon Musk&lt;/a>; as a matter of character, that electric cars are on their way. How far away are we, in technological and financial terms, from being able to overwhelm fossil fuels?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Well, we&#39;re getting closer and closer. I&#39;ll give you one statistic. If you were asked what percentage of the new electricity generation in the most populous country in the world—India—came from solar and wind last year, you might be surprised to hear that the answer was ninety-two per cent. Globally, eighty-eight per cent of all the new electricity generation last year was from renewables—eighty per cent from solar and wind. And yet we are still building more fossil-fuel facilities. There is now more money going into renewables than into fossil fuels, but the base of fossil-fuel generation is so large that it continues.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;And, yes, Elon Musk single-handedly advanced the distribution of electric vehicles by fifteen, twenty years. Really quite a remarkable story.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;You give him a lot of credit.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Oh, of course. As you said, whatever you think of him, he&#39;s done a lot of good things.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;But are you troubled by Elon Musk as a tribune for the cause?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Well, sure, sure. I mean, I have known him for a long time, and like some other of his longtime friends I have been puzzled and concerned by the U-turn he&#39;s taken on some very fundamental issues. But electric vehicles made up nearly twenty per cent of all the new vehicles sold last year, and all of the big auto companies have long since shifted their R. &amp;amp; D. budgets and their focus to trying to compete in the electric-vehicle space. It will be a bumpy transition, but it is well under way.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;So, how do you do that from the White House, from Congress? What do you want to see &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tag/joe-biden&quot;>;Joe Biden&lt;/a>; do? And can he do it—does he have the political and rhetorical capacity to do it effectively?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;What Joe Biden did last year, in passing the so-called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/the-democrats-finally-deliver&quot;>;Inflation Reduction Act&lt;/a>;, which is really a climate bill, was the most extraordinary legislative achievement of any head of state and any country in history. However, we are still permitting fossil-fuel production on public lands. What would be the political cost for him of bringing it to a halt on public lands? Significant—and it can&#39;t be blinked away, because of, again, the influence of the fossil-fuel industry. They have taken over one of our two major political parties, lock, stock, and oil barrel. It&#39;s really quite shocking. But, as someone wrote, Mother Nature is staging an intervention, and I think we&#39;re quite close to crossing a political tipping point.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Now, economists, to a person, will say that a carbon price is essential, whether in the form of a tax, or a fee, or whatever, but it&#39;s seen as a political—&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;Death.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Death. I have the scars to prove it. I succeeded in January, 1993, at persuading the incoming Clinton-Gore Administration to put a carbon tax in our first budget proposal. And it passed the House of Representatives, and then was killed in the Senate. A decade and more later, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tag/barack-obama&quot;>;Barack Obama&lt;/a>; succeeded in getting a so-called cap and trade, which is an indirect price on carbon, passed by the House, and again it died in the Senate.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;But we now have seen the European Union innovate, and come to something called the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism, which has appeal in the US as well. It can be a back door to a more global carbon price. There are seventy-three jurisdictions around the world that have already enacted a form of a carbon tax. Most of them are too small and too weak, but they can be scaled up. I think we&#39;re close to seeing a carbon tax. Look, at the African Climate Summit, the first ever, the leaders in Africa said, We need to have a carbon tax. And we need to devote the money to helping developing countries gain access to private capital markets so that they can participate in this clean-energy revolution; they&#39;ve been walled off from it.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;Yet another climate summit is coming up, this time in the Middle East. It seems odd who is leading it. How do you feel about that?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Yeah, it&#39;s absurd. This year, the annual United Nations Climate Conference is in the United Arab Emirates, and they have named the head of their national oil company, Sultan al-Jaber, as the president of the conference. I think it&#39;s—&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;[&lt;em>;Laughs&lt;/em>;.] What does that portend?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Well, I think that it takes off a disguise that has masked the reality for quite some time. It&#39;s absurd to put the CEO of one of the largest and, by many measures, least responsible oil and gas companies in the world in charge of the climate conference. At last year&#39;s conference, in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-midterm-results-bring-an-air-of-relief-to-the-cop27-climate-summit&quot;>;Sharm el-Sheikh&lt;/a>;, Egypt, the delegates from oil and gas companies outnumbered the combined delegations of the ten most climate-affected nations. The year before, in Glasgow, the fossil-fuel delegates outnumbered the largest national delegation. They have dominated this UN process the same way they&#39;ve dominated so many state governments in the US, and the national government much of the time.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;9nlat&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;It goes back to the weakness of the United Nations as an institution. It has been that way since its creation. It&#39;s the best we&#39;ve got, so we have to make the best of it. &lt;em >;COP&lt;/em>;1, the first of these annual conferences, took place three years after the Earth Summit, in Berlin. The young environment minister of Germany, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/angela-merkel-leaves-politics-on-her-own-terms&quot;>;Angela Merkel&lt;/a>;, was the president of &lt;em >;COP&lt;/em>;1. The first order of business was to adopt the rules, including for how the world was going to make decisions. The default procedure was something called consensus, which is the same as unanimity, unless the president of the &lt;em >;COP&lt;/em>; recognizes someone who is trying to object.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;And so the petrostates—and in effect the fossil-fuel industry—have had a veto over anything the world community tried to do on fossil fuels. Even the great Paris agreement, which was a genuine achievement, could not use the phrase “fossil fuels.” Last year, there was a movement by the European Union and others to phase out fossil fuels—to begin the phaseout. And Saudi Arabia said, No, I&#39;m sorry, we won&#39;t permit that—you have to have our permission, and we will not grant you our permission. Sorry, world. We can&#39;t even talk about fossil fuels.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;It&#39;s insane.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;It&#39;s insane. It&#39;s utterly insane. Now, we can change those rules. Three-quarters of the nations could vote to change the rules and give a supermajority the political power to adopt binding resolutions. It&#39;s a tough challenge, for sure. But we have to do it, and we have to find a way to do it. You&#39;re right that, even if a supermajority of the nations gained the ability to pass binding resolutions, they&#39;re not really binding if nations like Russia or Saudi Arabia—or the US—want to just ignore them. But we can establish the so-called direction of travel. We can establish a new and strong consensus in the world that in order to save humanity&#39;s future we have to phase out fossil fuels. I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s easy. It&#39;s not easy. It&#39;s the toughest thing humanity has ever tried to do.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;Aren&#39;t we losing the race miserably?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I would define it in different terms. Yes, we are. The crisis is still getting worse, faster than we are implementing the solutions. However, we are gaining momentum, and we&#39;re gaining momentum so rapidly that I&#39;m convinced we will soon be gaining on the crisis itself.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;Is that your natural optimism speaking, or is it the facts? Do they back you up?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Well, I am temperamentally optimistic.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;If I ask Elizabeth Kolbert, I get quite a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/its-earth-day-and-the-news-isnt-good&quot;>;different answer&lt;/a>;. She does everything she can to prevent despair, which is the unforgivable sin, but it creeps in.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Well, the old cliché “Denial ain&#39;t just a river in Egypt” should be joined by “Despair ain&#39;t just a tire in the trunk.” Despair is just another form of climate denial. We don&#39;t have time for it. The stakes are so high.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Just look at the climate migrants. There are many examples of this already. People from Central America coming through Mexico to the southern border of the US—that&#39;s driven by climate. You&#39;ve got Viktor Orbán, and you&#39;ve got ultranationalism rising in so many places. The Lancet Commission, which is widely respected, says that in this century we may have one billion climate migrants crossing international borders. That could threaten our capacity for self-governance.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;So we have to act. We have no choice, really. There are obstacles to move out of the way. It&#39;s not fair, perhaps, to ask the fossil-fuel companies to solve this crisis. They&#39;re incentivized to keep on burning more fossil fuels. But it &lt;em>;is&lt;/em>; fair to ask them to stop disrupting and blocking the efforts of everyone else to solve it.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;You mentioned democracy early on. It is well known, at least to people of a certain age, that after challenging the results in 2000 you painfully, elegantly, and with grace conceded. We saw what we saw with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tag/capitol-riot&quot;>;January 6th&lt;/a>;. And now we face the possibility of that being a permanent condition, something that could happen over and over again, the way we&#39;re now seeing impeachment as a kind of political weapon being used in the Republican House. You were prescient about the environmental crisis. Did the crisis of democracy take you by surprise?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;No. Well, I wrote a book called “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Assault-Reason-Al-Gore/dp/1594201226&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Assault-Reason-Al-Gore/dp/1594201226&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Assault-Reason-Al-Gore/dp/1594201226&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;The Assault on Reason&lt;/a>;,” in 2007. It began with a notation that many Americans were asking the question, What has happened to America? It has been building for quite some time. But I think that the love people have for freedom, for self-determination, and for self-government is reawakening, and people are—&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;You think it&#39;ll prevail?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I do. Again, I&#39;m temperamentally optimistic. We don&#39;t have time to wallow in despair. We&#39;ve got work to do, and the stakes have never been higher. It&#39;s hard to find words adequate to this challenge. I wish, so deeply, that I could find the words to inspire in others the burning passion for saving our country and making it, in Lincoln&#39;s phrase, “the last best hope”; and revivifying the promise that America has always held for the world, with all of our contradictions and weaknesses and failures. But it relies upon the willingness of the American people to wake up, and fight to save our democracy, and to save the future of humanity. This all sounds so dire—but it is. ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;ockc93&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot;

The problem, as Gore sees it, is that a powerful legacy network of political and financial spheres of influence are stubbornly standing in the way. “When ExxonMobil or Chevron put their ads on the air, the purpose is not for a husband and wife to say, &#39;Oh, let&#39;s go down to the store and buy some motor oil.&#39; The purpose is to condition the political space so that they have a continued license to keep producing and selling more and more fossil fuels,” Gore says. He notes that the upcoming United Nations climate conference is presided over by an oil executive. And yet Gore remains cautiously optimistic.

The theatre was small and dark, without a stage, and the scenery was minimal: a large illuminated rock in the middle, some scattered trees, and the audience members, many of whom were seated in folding chairs ringed around the rock. A trumpeter entered first, blowing long, melancholy notes, followed by a young man. The man explained that he had gone for a drive and, when his car had stalled, he had wandered into the woods. It grew darker and colder, and the audience heard the voices of an older man and an older woman speak about the young man, expressing their distress at the direction his life had taken. Then, without warning, a young woman appeared.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;GenericCallout&quot;>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;external-link-embed--inline&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;a aria-label=&quot;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Jon Fosse&#39;s Search for Peace&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-new-yorker-interview/jon-fosses-search-for-peace&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-new-yorker-interview/jon-fosses-search-for-peace&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;&lt;span >;&lt;strong>;Jon Fosse&#39;s Search for Peace&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/a>;&lt;p >;&lt;em>;The author speaks with Merve Emre on where his body of work comes from.&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;She was called a younger woman in the script, but it would have been better to describe her as a presence—or, to borrow the title of Fosse&#39;s new novel, “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Shining-Jon-Fosse/dp/1945492775&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Shining-Jon-Fosse/dp/1945492775&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Shining-Jon-Fosse/dp/1945492775&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;Kvitleik&lt;/a>;,” a shining. She was a modern angel, a peroxide blonde with stern cheekbones, in a glittering white slip dress and a white fur stole. Her hair was cropped. Her feet were bare and beautiful and caught the light from the rock with each step. She spoke to the man, urging him to return home. As he roamed the theatre, trembling, followed by her voice and the trumpet, he stopped right next to the chairs of the audience members to argue, to plead, although it was not always clear for what. “My own shame is bigger than myself,” he screamed. I watched the faces of the audience; most of them remained impassive, stony. They looked down at their hands or feet and away from his stricken face. In their withdrawal, they seemed no different from the trees that surrounded them.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The play was performed in Norwegian, and, although I had read the English translation of the script, by May-Brit Akerholt, beforehand, I did not understand the words as they were being spoken. It was strange to realize how little this mattered. The light, the trumpet, the sweat and the shame of the young man, the profound indifference of the world to him—all of it exceeded language. His characters seemed to know this as well as I did. “But there&#39;s something there,” the older man said to the older woman. “Yes, larger than life, or at least something else other than life. But can you say something like that?” “No, not really,” she responded. “For everything just becomes words.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;When the Swedish Academy awarded the 2023 Nobel Prize in Literature to Fosse yesterday, they described his colossal, genre-spanning body of work as giving “voice to the unsayable.” What I think the Academy meant is that, across his forty-odd plays, his novels, his essays, and his children&#39;s books, what is unsayable—the absolute depths of abandonment, shame, love, and grace—is felt without needing to be named, surpassing the mere arrangement of words on a page.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;It is easiest to see in the light and music of Fosse&#39;s plays, more of which I hope will make their way to English-language audiences in the coming years. But we see it, too, in the lines that open Fosse&#39;s seven-book masterpiece, “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Other-Name-Septology-I-II/dp/1945492406&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Other-Name-Septology-I-II/dp/1945492406&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Other-Name-Septology-I-II/dp/1945492406&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;Septology&lt;/a>;,” translated into English by Damion Searls. “And I see myself standing and looking at the picture with the two lines that cross in the middle, one purple line, one brown line, it&#39;s a painting wider than it is high and I see that I&#39;ve painted the lines slowly,” Asle, the narrator of the series, thinks. He knows that the essence of a painting is its ability to create a convincing illusion of depth, and that one looks at it to find some elaborate meaning behind appearances. The illusion is created by the dripping lines of the painting, its representation of the cross of St. Andrew. But it is also created by the space that surrounds these lines—the flatness and the forbidding blankness of the canvas—that is everything that the painting is not. Together, what is absent and what is present create the painting&#39;s sense of wholeness, the totality of its form.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;If a man stands in front of a painting what can he understand about the essence of what he sees? That there exists “an emptiness? a nothingness? a distance? yes, maybe yes, yes maybe it&#39;s a distance,” Asle thinks. The image of the cross reminds him of how far he is from divinity. The only way for him to believe that divinity might exist somewhere within the painting is by committing to the reality of what he cannot see, hear, or touch; of what remains invisible, ineffable, and unfathomable; of what he knows to exist only by virtue of its absence from the worldly limits of our perception. This absent presence is perceived by Asle as the “soft invisible light” that emanates from the painting. This light is an extension or an emissary of God, the light that emanates from the dark in the writings of the medieval German theologian Meister Eckhart, which Asle reads and recites throughout “Septology.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;The soft invisible light assures Asle that the painting bears the possibility of transcendence. The painting is vaster and more varied than its surface suggests, and suffused with a meaning that cannot be explained or captured by any of our tools. We cannot point to or photograph the soft invisible light. We cannot pin it down or imprison it, the way that children catch fireflies in glass jars. We cannot study it by measuring its frequency in either broken particles or unbroken waves. We cannot know it. We can only sense it, and, sensing it, believe in it.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Paradoxically, the reality to which Asle must commit is a form of unreality, at least according to our empiricist standards of knowledge. But, if we believe in the integrity of our belief, then the distance between illusion and reality shrinks to nothing. What we gain in the process is an astonishing freedom from the rational world. Some might describe the faith that one has in unreality as the belief in God. Others might call it the art of fiction. I do not think Jon Fosse would mind what you or I call this faith, so long as we allow for the possibility that it exists. ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>; &lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/ div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;div>;&lt;div>;&lt;div>;&lt;div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt; /div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 07 Oct 2023 01:06:01 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“Reservation Dogs” Redefines the Coming-of-Age Story]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/10/16/reservation-dogs-redefines-the-coming-of-age-story]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-06T14:00:00.000Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/651dfce6fa8a289df5226179/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/231016_r43176.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;article >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attribute-verso-pattern=&quot;article-body&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;ArticlePageChunks&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;In American pop culture, coming of age tends to be a solo endeavor. Adolescence is when we start to define ourselves against our parents, our peers, and the forces that structure our worlds; Hollywood often distills that grappling for identity into a lone hero&#39;s journey. But, for the teen-age quartet at the heart of the FX series “Reservation Dogs,” which just concluded its three-season run on Hulu, it&#39;s an inherently communal experience. Early on, the foursome—Bear (D&#39;Pharaoh Woon-A-Tai), Elora (Devery Jacobs), Cheese (Lane Factor), and Willie Jack (Paulina Alexis)—resist that revelation, convinced that their home town of Okern, Oklahoma, killed the fifth member of their group, Daniel (Dalton Cramer), who had dreamed of ditching their Muscogee rez for California beaches. Grieving for their friend a year after his suicide, the teens couldn&#39;t see what the audience could: that dusty Okern was alive with oddballs, artists, helpers, and ways to heal. The showrunner, Sterlin Harjo, who created the series with Taika Waititi, continued expanding this mosaic for the next two seasons, in a mode spearheaded by Louis CK&#39;s “Louie” and brought to its apex by Donald Glover&#39;s “Atlanta”: the formally and tonally mercurial, auteur-driven, detour-prone, impressionistic half-hour dramedy. (Call it “the FX mood piece.”) The result can be easier to admire than to get lost in.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;If Harjo owes a debt to predecessors like Glover, he&#39;s also made the form his own through his emphasis on the collective. (The dialogue, peppered with Native slang and its own all-purpose curse word, “shitass,” is just as distinctive.) By the third season, Okern has come to encompass the spiritual, the folkloric, and the historical, effectively redefining what community can be. Alongside the single moms, aunties, and grandmothers anchoring the protagonists are a nineteenth-century warrior spirit (Dallas Goldtooth) who pushes Bear to soul-search; Elora&#39;s dead mother, the forever-twenty Cookie (JaNae Collins); and the vengeance-fuelled Deer Lady (Kaniehtiio Horn), an ageless wanderer with hooves hidden under her disco-era denim jumpsuit.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Harjo&#39;s project—a foulmouthed, art-house-inspired tribute to the endurance of Native communities, as well as an earnest call to insure their persistence—had no analogue on television. His mission is reflected in the special attention the show pays to rez elders, many of them played by celebrated Indigenous character actors. “Reservation Dogs” displays a reverence for the cultural wealth these figures stand to offer the next generation—but also insists, crucially, on their fallibility and humanity. Every member of this wizened circle has his quirks: the artist Bucky (Wes Studi) attempts to ward off disease with his mysterious figurines; the medicine man Fixico (Richard Ray Whitman) peddles “real medicine” outside the Indian health clinic; and the tribal cop Big (Zahn McClarnon) would rather chase down Bigfoot than go after juvenile delinquents. Though they&#39;re eager to pass on traditional knowledge, they&#39;re less forthcoming about the personal traumas that have shaped them. The most pivotal installment of the new season, “House Made of Bongs,” shows the elders as high schoolers during the Ford Administration. Like the modern-day Rez Dogs, they were a rude, tight-knit crew on the cusp of political consciousness, more interested in getting high than in attending class. While coming down from an acid trip, the teen-age Bucky mutters what may well be the thesis of the series: “How beautiful to never search for who you are. Everything you need is here in the millenniums of certainty living in your mirror.” Then Maximus—the Daniel of their group, an orphan who&#39;s visited for the first time that night by either extraterrestrial kin or schizophrenic hallucinations—complicates this assertion of cosmic cohesion by slipping out of his friends&#39; grasp. When Bear encounters a grizzled Maximus (Graham Greene) by chance, decades later, the older man&#39;s exile from Okern functions as a cautionary tale.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Harjo&#39;s intense, even anxious focus on intergenerational bonds gradually exposes some of the series&#39; shortcomings. The writing has become more didactic, and, by continuing to zoom out further and further, “Reservation Dogs” cedes some of its more visceral pleasures: namely, hang time with the gang. Their low-key jaunts about town—to their catfish joint, the health center, or the homes of various elders—give way to sometimes meandering one-on-one scenes that lend several episodes the musty air of a chamber play.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;The finale sends Bear, Elora, Cheese, and Willie Jack into adulthood with a newfound appreciation for their cultural inheritance, bringing a sense of closure to a series that many have argued is departing too soon. But where the idiosyncrasies of life in Okern have been rendered in loving detail, the teens themselves remain archetypes, and not wholly persuasive ones—partly because of how divorced they are from the rest of their cohort. (The core group only interacts with other kids after literally being ambushed by them.) The Rez Dogs seem to pay little heed to conventional milestones like birthdays, dances, or graduation—their most meaningful social gatherings are the funerals of elders. And though we know that Bear and Elora are the children of teen moms, the crew treats sex like a foreign concept; even crushes are rare. The absence of these “all-American” goalposts of adolescence, which are less universal than Hollywood would have us believe, can be refreshing. And yet there&#39;s something unconvincingly childlike—perhaps defensively wholesome—about this depiction, too. After all this time, the gang&#39;s ties to one another are still montage-level deep. Apart from reminiscing about Daniel, I can&#39;t say I know what they would talk about in the quiet moments that make up life.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Toward the end of the show, we see what “Reservation Dogs” can accomplish when it decenters the teens from their own story. In a superb episode titled “Wahoo!,” Bear&#39;s mom, Rita (Sarah Podemski), receives a visit from her deceased friend Cookie, just as the soon-to-be empty-nester is contemplating the possibilities that might open up once she no longer has to put her son first. Cookie asks Rita to check in on Elora, and the arc concludes with a moving ceremony that lets the spirit know that she no longer has to keep such close tabs on her daughter; the aunties vow to do so in her stead, allowing Cookie to rest in peace.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;But the final season also features underdeveloped story lines and characters who suffer for Harjo&#39;s preoccupation with the big picture. The deliberate obfuscation of the conflict between the estranged cousins Maximus and Fixico, for example, makes their long-awaited reunion less poignant than expected. The revelation of Deer Lady&#39;s childhood in an Indian boarding school feels thinly sketched, as does Elora&#39;s encounter with her white father (Ethan Hawke), a man she&#39;d assumed died years ago. “I didn&#39;t want to take you away from all that. 。 。 。 From your family, from your people,” he tells her, explaining why he had stayed away when she was younger. He knows her world well enough—he invokes her grandmother, her basketball coach, even the Okern epithet “shitass.” But he realizes, painfully, that he knows precious little about &lt;em>;her&lt;/em>;. Even after three years in Elora&#39;s company, some viewers might feel the same. ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;is3aa9&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;aw3yjp&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 06 Oct 2023 23:06:01 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“Anatomy of a Fall,” Reviewed]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/the-current-cinema/10/16/anatomy-of-a-fall-movie-review]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-06T10:04:32.877Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/651d9c0c98d3cdbde1212afd/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/231016_r43177_rd.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;article >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attribute-verso-pattern=&quot;article-body&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;ArticlePageChunks&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;The first question that is asked in “Anatomy of a Fall,” a new film from the French director Justine Triet, is a simple one: “What do you want to know?” The line, which could stand as a motto for the whole movie, is spoken by a writer, Sandra Voyter (Sandra Hüller), in a chalet in the Alps. She is being interviewed by a graduate student, Zoé (Camille Rutherford), although their conversation is soon drowned out by a rumpus from above—specifically, an instrumental version of “PIMP,” by 50 Cent, played with a thunderous boom by Sandra&#39;s husband, Samuel Maleski (Samuel Theis), who is also a writer. Either he&#39;s deliberately sabotaging the interview or he wants to trigger an avalanche.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Of Samuel himself we see no sign, for the moment, and that matters. It foreshadows how the story will unfold. So much in “Anatomy of a Fall” is overheard, heard but not seen, seen but misunderstood, misremembered, conjured out of conjecture, or unwisely taken on trust. When we &lt;em>;do&lt;/em>; catch sight of Samuel, he&#39;s dead—sprawled in the snow beside the chalet, with a deep cranial wound and a trail of blood. So, did he tumble over a balcony or was he shoved? Did he hit his head on the edge of the shed below, or had the blow already been struck? Did he perish by his own hand, or at Sandra&#39;s? Is 50 Cent a suspect? The puzzles proliferate. Warning: Do not expect them all to be solved.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Sandra and Samuel have a son, Daniel, aged eleven, who is played by Milo Machado Graner with a fine blend of frailty and determination. Daniel&#39;s border collie, Snoop, is played—in an equally striking performance—by Messi, whose skill would be the envy of his namesake. Snoop is not just Daniel&#39;s companion but his helpmate, because Daniel was hurt in an accident, when he was four, and left with severe visual impairment. (Typically, the details of that event, and its long aftermath, take a while to emerge. Triet is a specialist in the slow leak.) It&#39;s he who returns from a walk with Snoop, discovers his father&#39;s body, and cries out to Sandra. The music is still blasting forth, but she hears the cry. How come?&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;We have yet to reach the opening credits, and Triet has got us where she wants us. This is not a sleuthing movie; there are cops, but they mill around the fringes of the plot, and there&#39;s no Poirot to slalom in from a nearby valley, brush the snow from his mustache, and address the case. Instead, &lt;em>;we&lt;/em>; become the detectives—reading every rune, probing for holes, and testing the evidence as if we were treading on ice. “I have to understand,” Daniel says, and his compulsion is infectious. What demands clarification is not only the crime, if crime it was, but the state of his parents&#39; marriage, which has been cracking and melting for some time. According to Sandra, it was based on “intellectual stimulation.” So much for love.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;There is almost no aspect of this tale that doesn&#39;t feel slippery to the touch. Sandra is German but came to live here in France, where Samuel grew up, and is clearly unsettled on what she calls his turf. Speaking largely in English, the language in which—as a compromise, or in search of common ground—they raised Daniel, she is a mother with no use for her mother tongue. She admits to sleeping with other people while she was married, and now, to add to the tangle, she acquires the services of a louche lawyer, Vincent Renzi (Swann Arlaud), with whom she was once involved. He&#39;s badly needed, too, because Sandra is charged with Samuel&#39;s murder. “I did not kill him!” she exclaims to Vincent, urgently answering a question that he hasn&#39;t even asked—maybe the most startling irruption in the film. Regardless of what Vincent privately believes, however, his plan, for the defense, is to claim that Samuel committed suicide. And so to trial.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;“Anatomy of a Fall,” which won the Palme d&#39;Or at this year&#39;s Cannes Film Festival, has been widely referred to as a courtroom drama. Yes, much of the second half is set in court, in Grenoble, but you seldom get the impression that Triet—who wrote the screenplay with her partner, Arthur Harari—is enmeshed in the machinery of the law. Indeed, fans of legal shows, on TV, or of Otto Preminger&#39;s crisply organized “Anatomy of a Murder” (1959) will be taken aback by the free-form nature of the proceedings in Triet&#39;s movie. Lawyers, witnesses, and a “spatter analyst” or two seem to interrupt one another at will, or at random, often from a seated position. The prosecutor (Antoine Reinartz), a shaven-headed smirker, roams around snapping and snarling, and I, for one, would toss him out of a high window without a second&#39;s hesitation. What the setting most resembles is a brasserie full of squabbling law students, and you half expect the clerk of the court to arrive with bowls of onion soup.&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;The most telling sequence focusses on Daniel, as he stands there being quizzed, by both the defense and the prosecution, on his testimony. The camera swivels from side to side, hardening the sense of his being under siege, and the movement prompts two thoughts. One, can a child be cross-questioned, whatever the jurisdiction, in this hostile manner, and, if so, why should the evidence be ruled admissible? Two, has Triet worked on us to such mischievous effect that we no longer care about what is plausible, and crave only the tussle of wills at the movie&#39;s heart? This is less of a courtroom drama, I reckon, and more of a discordant, highly strung character clash with legal bells and whistles tacked on. Notice how we finally get wind of the verdict: not in court, in a formal announcement, but via a television reporter outside who hears an excited hubbub swelling behind her. Truth is not crystalline and clear. It lies in pieces, and you have to pick them up as best you can.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;A practical tip: “Anatomy of a Fall” is formidable stuff, and you should arrange to watch it at the cinema with your most captious friends, preferably at six o&#39;clock, so that you can thrash things out over dinner—fondue, I&#39;d suggest, for that handy whiff of bubbling Alpine chaos. Notwithstanding the verdict that is delivered in Grenoble, it&#39;s perfectly possible that you will remain uncertain as to whether Sandra is guilty, and here&#39;s the kicker: even the person playing her doesn&#39;t know for sure. Hüller has revealed that, during the making of the film, she repeatedly asked Triet if Sandra did or did not do the deed. Triet refused to squeal.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The miracle is that such uncertainty renders Hüller&#39;s performance sharper rather than vaguer. It is as though Sandra, reportedly described by her husband—an enfeebled soul, and a less successful writer—as “quite castrating,” had armed herself against all eventualities and foes. With her flustered froideur, she needs no cross-examination to make her bristle, and our response is to marvel at the depths of her discomfort, and perhaps her guile. When she stands outside on a frosty night, drinking and flirting with her lawyer, is she grabbing a rare chance to relax, or subtly swaying him yet further to her cause? How much we like or dislike Sandra is of no consequence. What&#39;s unnerving is that we can&#39;t decide, from one scene to the next, how secure we are in wanting to root for her.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Hüller was in an earlier and less coherent film by Triet, “Sibyl” (2019), which, weirdly, features a guy named Maleski, like Samuel, &lt;em>;and&lt;/em>; a vulnerable boy named Daniel. In both films, moreover, conversations are surreptitiously recorded. In “Sibyl,” a shrink tapes the outpourings of a patient; now, in “Anatomy of a Fall,” we learn that Samuel taped a tempestuous argument that he had with Sandra, not long before his demise. The result is played aloud in court, and, along the way, Triet transforms it into a flashback, meaning that we see as well as hear the marital storm—a privilege denied to the judge and the jurors. (The irony is that the spareness of the audio version makes a greater impact.) Is that a smooth creative sleight of hand, or is the movie cheating on us? Might it be that Triet is following the crafty lead of her own heroine?&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The fact that such doubts and reservations encircle this film is not a mark against it. On the contrary, they honor its capacity to provoke. That is why Daniel carries such moral weight. When he confesses, “I got mixed up,” he is being honest—more so than any of the adults—about the nature of confusion. Looking at the veiled gaze of his troubled eyes, which both see and fail to see, we can&#39;t help wondering: when, and under what emotional pressure, does a memory shift from being a reliable account of something to a story that we tell ourselves about what we wish had occurred? It&#39;s no surprise that Daniel should be prey to that slippage; after all, he&#39;s the son of two writers, and he listens as the prosecutor reads out menacing passages from one of Sandra&#39;s books in a bid to incriminate her. (Nice try, &lt;em>;Maître&lt;/em>;. Pursue that line and you&#39;d have prisons crawling with novelists.) Forget the clever tricks, though. If you really want to find out what happened that fateful day at the chalet, there&#39;s only one course of action.

Outside are white-tablecloth four-tops convenient for surveying the expensively heeled clacking down the leafy street. Inside are gray leather banquettes, glistening brass, and a brilliant chandelier of upside-down tulip petals which would not look out of place on Carrie or Emily, as a bag—or a hat.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In a way, Justine&#39;s—named for its proprietor, the daughter of the famous Upper East Side wine importer Neal Rosenthal—harks to a different era, when the economy was a little more flush and overt extravagance a touch less gauche. But, then again, in 2023 even an upscale bistro where bottles average around a hundred and fifty dollars feels, well, very 2023. On a recent evening, a genial if slightly harried-looking waiter apologized that there&#39;s no longer a sommelier on staff and that the cheapest wine by the glass (a fifteen-dollar rosé) had just run out.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Items on the Filipino-French menu rotate seasonally. Of the seven appetizers the other night, the least glamorous turned out to be the most winning. A cucumber carpaccio, mixed with caramelized pumpkin seeds and basil, was the perfectly calibrated, autumnally inflected farewell to summer my palate didn&#39;t know it needed. Ubiquitous heirloom tomatoes were given new, luminous life with herb-salted slices of plum and tossed with ginseng vinegar. “When I was little, my mother was obsessed with everything ginseng in the Chinese grocery stores in New Jersey,” Jeanne Jordan, the restaurant&#39;s thirty-four-year-old Filipino American chef, told me with a grin. “So I guess the ginseng vinegar drizzled down to me.”&lt;/p>;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;feature-default&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;image&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:feature-default&quot;>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;A pile of buttery shrimp atop a piece of toast garnished with a lemon.&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/651c9445c0cfacaf9a88b427/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/231016_r43184.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/651c9445c0cfacaf9a88b427/master/w_120,c_limit/231016_r43184.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/651c9445c0cfacaf9a88b427/master/w_240,c_limit/231016_r43184.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/651c9445c0cfacaf9a88b427/master/w_320,c_limit/231016_r43184.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/651c9445c0cfacaf9a88b427/master/w_640,c_limit/231016_r43184.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/651c9445c0cfacaf9a88b427/master/w_960,c_limit/231016_r43184.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/651c9445c0cfacaf9a88b427/master/w_1280,c_limit/231016_r43184.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/651c9445c0cfacaf9a88b427/master/w_1600,c_limit/231016_r43184.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;Shrimp toast is bathed in butter, Gruyère, and bacon.&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/inline-embed>;&lt;p >;Occasionally, the commendable jeu d&#39;esprit gets away from Jordan. The shrimp toast, delightful on the first bite, became edgeless too fast with its opulent bath of butter, Gruyère, and bacon. Similarly, the flavorful pork chop—probably the most traditionally Filipino item on the menu—slathered in a creamy Billi Bi sauce, liberally spangled with mussels, and showered in trout roe, could have removed at least one piece of jewelry before departing the kitchen.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Jordan&#39;s finest creation is the spicy crab spaghetti, inspired by the crab fried rice she ate growing up. “It&#39;s the one item we don&#39;t take off the menu,” she said with pride. The light, bouncy noodles, coupled with silky crab meat, are almost slurpable, and the sauce, an elusive mélange of red-pepper pistou, garlic purée, aged Parmesan, and crushed pepper flakes, brings a seductive, flickering heat. “If you like this, you should have tried it when we used crab roe. It was very, very good,” Jordan remarked. “But it was also very, very expensive.” (&lt;em>;Dishes $23-$46.&lt;/em>;) ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 06 Oct 2023 18:06:01 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
