data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;整个周末，在媒体的无数评论中，在痛苦的电话中与以色列的朋友通电话，进行类比，不可避免地试图理解难以理解的事情。许多人说，哈马斯从加沙地带发起的对以色列南部的血腥袭击——阿克萨洪水行动是自 1973 年赎罪日战争以来最可怕的国家悲剧。也有人说这是珍珠港事件。或者“以色列 9/11”。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;这次袭击的大胆和残酷与其秘密性一样令人震惊。 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/dispatch/waking-to-an-attack-from-hamas&quot;>;周六早上&lt;/a>;，哈马斯向以色列发射了两千多枚导弹，推土机和战士轻易冲破了埃雷兹十字路口附近的安全围栏。部分原因是以色列向北派遣了如此多的军队到约旦河西岸，以应对那里因定居点扩张和定居者暴力而引发的骚乱，哈马斯在前往以色列南部的城镇和基布兹屠杀平民并占领以色列时几乎没有遇到任何抵抗。许多&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/as-told-to/a-father-reckons-with-the-hostage-takeing-of-his-family-in-southern-israel&quot; >;人质&lt;/a>;尽可能。我在以色列的同事露丝·玛格丽特 (Ruth Margalit) 报道了黎明前的情况，网址为 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/dispatch/when-massacre-came-to-a-music-festival-in -以色列&quot;>;雷伊姆基布兹附近的新星音乐节&lt;/a>;，当警察高喊“红色！”——即将到来的火箭弹发射的代码时，哈马斯武装分子开着皮卡车和摩托车袭击了一群年轻人。仅在节日就有两百多人被杀。据新闻报道，在短短几天内，被杀的以色列人人数已增至八百多人；至少一百五十名以色列妇女、男子和儿童被抓获并带回加沙作为人质。恐惧与流血、狂喜的袭击与抓捕的画面，注定了2023年10月7日将成为犹太历史上不可磨灭的悲剧。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;安谢尔·普费弗，政治专栏作家、《比比》的作者，以色列总理本杰明·内塔尼亚胡的传记是我采访过的人之一，他们认为闪电行动最贴切的类比是春节攻势，越共和北越军队在这次攻势中发动了突然袭击，但没有赢得战争战场上，却成功挫伤了美国及其南越盟友的斗志，削弱了美国对这场战争的支持。当然，最大的区别在于，春节攻势是大多数美国人在安全的地方观看的八千多英里外的电视上播放着他们客厅的画面。在加沙和以色列，冲突十分激烈。每个人都在家里战斗。恐惧是普遍存在的。没有距离，没有逃避。&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/ div>;&lt;p>;左倾报纸《国土报》的主编阿鲁夫·本 (Aluf Benn) 追溯了更久远的历史。 “这是以色列自 1948 年建国以来所面临的最严重的灾难，”他在特拉维夫的办公室里用沙哑而疲惫的声音说道。本回忆起 1903 年在基希讷乌发生的俄罗斯犹太人大屠杀，不过他补充道，“这些人不是哥萨克人。这是 2023 年的火力。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;对于以色列顶尖调查记者之一、12 频道节目“Uvda”的主持人伊拉娜·达扬 (Ilana Dayan) 来说，脆弱感是独一无二的。 “以色列人经历过如此多的战争、危机和起义，但我们从未经历过国家的缺席，”她告诉我。 “即使在 1948 年，至少还有神话般的社区 &lt;em>;yishuv&lt;/em>; 的存在和保护，后来总是有军队。我们始终相信这个无所不能的以色列“我们”就在那里。现在我们看到人们在这个基布兹或那个城镇呼喊救命。人们躲在壁橱里，对着手机呼救，却没有人过来。人们装死是为了自救。这些是来自贫民窟的故事。这是我们还没有开始理解的创伤。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;许多以色列人唤起了赎罪日战争的记忆。 1973年10月，在犹太历最神圣的一天，整个国家被封锁，街道上空无一人，许多人都在犹太教堂里，埃及和叙利亚开始进攻西奈半岛和戈兰高地。以色列军队在战争的最初几天遭受了惨重的损失，然后才发动了成功的反击。尽管战斗在不到三周后就结束了，但以色列人回忆起那场战争是一场灾难，是一个关于脆弱性和不准备的警示故事。考虑到这一象征意义，哈马斯几乎在五十年后才开始了行动。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“不过，这没有合适的类比，”一位前以色列国家安全官员告诉我。 “这是敌对势力第一次像&lt;em>;伊斯兰国&lt;/em>;一样，以激进的方式渗透到以色列领土并袭击&lt;em>;平民&lt;/em>;目标，杀害妇女、儿童、士兵、老年人。 ”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;在攻击发生后的几个小时内，我收到了大量 WhatsApp 消息，其中没有一条包含历史记录类比，都带有关于损失、不确定性和绝望的报告。仅来自一位朋友：&lt;/p>;&lt;blockquote >;&lt;div >;&lt;p>;一位朋友的女儿——失踪。仍然不知道是被绑架到加沙还是在南部的聚会上被杀。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;一位朋友的兄弟在聚会中被杀。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;一位朋友的妹妹在基布兹贝埃里失踪，下方南。目前还没有人知道是否遭到绑架或杀害。&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/blockquote>;&lt;p>;在南部、发生袭击的城镇和基布兹，悲伤和脆弱感最为强烈。 “人们从特拉维夫和其他地方来到这些南部城镇定居，是为了那里的生活质量，”以色列著名历史学家安妮塔·夏皮拉告诉我。 “以色列花园的地方变成了恐怖的景象。”但现在这个国家的每个人都生活在火箭、空袭警报中，夜晚都在避难所和安全室里度过。社交媒体上充斥着同胞被枪杀和绑架的图片；房屋和汽车着火；一名八十多岁的白发妇女被绑架者用高尔夫球车带走，大概是去加沙；音乐节上，一名年轻得多的女子尖叫着求饶，被扔到摩托车上。一位以色列朋友称其为“鼻烟片”。然而，他说，“对于某些人来说，这是了解他们的朋友或亲戚是生还是死的唯一方法。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;未来几天，愤怒和悲伤只会变得更加严重。死亡人数一直在上升。在这个人人都认识的小国里，将会有数百场葬礼，许多葬礼都会通过电视转播。以色列著名左翼律师迈克尔·斯法德（Michael Sfard）曾代表约旦河西岸的巴勒斯坦人和多个人权组织，他对袭击的野蛮行径感到震惊。他在社交媒体上写道：“当你看到纯粹的邪恶时，很难理解人类有能力做到这一点。”&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;以色列的反应从对加沙的空袭开始，将会毫不松懈。那里的死亡人数已经达到数百人，而这仅仅是开始。超过两百万巴勒斯坦人居住在加沙。以色列国防部长宣布该地区的电力、食品和燃料将被切断；对加沙的空袭正在进行中。内塔尼亚胡已警告居民撤离。但自从2007年哈马斯上台以来，加沙地带就被封锁了。 “以色列在埃及的帮助下，将加沙变成了露天监狱，”人权观察组织以色列和巴勒斯坦主任奥马尔·沙基尔表示。究竟如何撤离？&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;直到最新一届以色列政府崛起，&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/in-israel-以色列历史上最反动的一瞥，就连内塔尼亚胡的一些最激烈的批评者也表示，与许多右翼人士相比，他相对不愿意使用压倒性的武力。 “但随着这个恐怖政府的到来，这种情况发生了变化，”《国土报》编辑阿鲁夫·本 (Aluf Benn) 说道，他指的是利库德集团目前与 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine&quot; 的议会联盟。 /2023/02/27/itamar-ben-gvir-israels-minister-of-chaos&quot;>;以色列境内的极右翼政党&lt;/a>;。在针对右翼司法“改革”的&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/letter-from-jerusalem/israels-transformative-protest-movement&quot;>;每周一次的大规模抗议&lt;/a>;中，几乎迷失了方向，”政府支持西岸定居点建设的迅速增加。一些右翼部长甚至公开支持吞并。定居者侮辱或攻击巴勒斯坦人以及巴勒斯坦人反击的事件已发生多起。政府领导人支持犹太人来到阿克萨清真寺，他们知道那里会引发火灾。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;哈马斯以外的一些巴勒斯坦人在不支持流血事件的情况下向媒体坚称，数十年的占领和贫困导致了巴勒斯坦人的死亡。到了这个悲惨的地步。巴勒斯坦立法委员会成员、巴勒斯坦民族倡议秘书长穆斯塔法·巴尔古提（Mustafa Barghouti）也表示，此次袭击是“现代历史上持续时间最长的占领的直接结果”。他告诉美国有线电视新闻网 (CNN) 的法里德·扎卡里亚 (Fareed Zakaria)，只有“结束这种非法占领”并接受巴勒斯坦人“作为平等的人”，暴力才会停止。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;毫无疑问，加沙充满了人类苦难。这是一个在强制隔离的条件下存在的贫穷、拥挤、就业不足的痛苦景象；它的内部由一个腐败的神权政权统治，该政权已经十七年没有举行过选举了。尽管加沙人民陷入困境，世界也将注意力转向其他地方，但最近的以色列政府却实行了一种极简主义战略，用安全术语来说就是“缩小冲突”。以色列领导层认为，它不需要解决与加沙巴勒斯坦人的冲突，只需偶尔采取适度的经济激励措施来改善生活条件即可。它的战略本质上是试图让巴勒斯坦人隐形。哈马斯袭击发生后，《国土报》的一篇社论将其描述为以“吞并和剥夺”为重点、“忽视巴勒斯坦人的存在和权利”的外交政策的结果。&lt;/p>;&lt;不过，袭击的时机表明其动机超出了以色列-巴勒斯坦冲突的范围。以色列官员指责伊朗帮助策划了这次袭击。据《华尔街日报》报道，伊朗伊斯兰革命卫队军官自八月以来一直与哈马斯合作，为此次行动进行训练，然后于上周一在黎巴嫩“开了绿灯”。伊朗领导人对沙特与以色列建立更密切关系的前景深感担忧。他们担心，两国之间的和解可能会导致美国增加对利雅得的援助，包括核技术；西方增加了对哈马斯在西岸的竞争对手巴勒斯坦权力机构及其八十七岁领导人马哈茂德·阿巴斯的经济支持；以及耶路撒冷的更安全的右翼政府。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;哈马斯和伊朗领导人可能也从以色列社会的深刻分歧以及一些以色列官员的警告中看到了机会，其中包括前以色列国防军前高级官员丹·哈雷尔 (Dan Harel)。以色列国防部长表示，军事准备状态处于降低状态。他们感觉到内塔尼亚胡内阁成员的行为和言论削弱了西方对以色列的支持。&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;伊朗和以色列哈马斯官员否认伊朗政权参与了此次袭击，但德黑兰长期以来一直是哈马斯和黎巴嫩南部真主党的重要支持者和武器供应商。到目前为止，真主党尚未全力投入冲突。它的导弹武器库规模庞大，而且比哈马斯或伊斯兰圣战组织（另一个规模较小的激进组织）所拥有的任何导弹都要复杂得多。升级为更广泛的战争可能是灾难性的。正如作家兼记者阿里·沙维特告诉我的那样，“如果真主党介入，那就是世界末日。特拉维夫可能会受到严重打击。他们的导弹精度足以击中发电厂和本古里安机场。”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height :auto&quot;

data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;在行动层面上，哈马斯入侵的关键结果可以说不是他们留下的尸体。加沙附近的城镇都是以色列人，无论是活着的还是死了的，他们都把他们带回来作为赏金。哈马斯领导人还记得十七年前发生的事情，当时他们俘虏了一名以色列士兵吉拉德·沙利特；在接下来的五年里，这成为以色列的痴迷，直到他最终被释放，以换取一千多名巴勒斯坦囚犯。其中一名被释放的囚犯叶海亚·辛瓦尔 (Yahya Sinwar) 现在是哈马斯的第二号人物，仅次于伊斯梅尔·哈尼亚 (Ismail Haniyeh)。&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“哈马斯之所以这么做，是因为他们眼中的战利品是劫持数十名以色列人质， “安谢尔·普费弗告诉我。 “在他们看来，他们现在已经拥有了下金蛋的鹅。这将成为促使以色列释放五千名巴勒斯坦囚犯的杠杆。这是巴勒斯坦斗争的最终象征：如果你强迫以色列这样做，你就是巴勒斯坦运动无可争议的领导人。这使得阿巴斯和他的政党法塔赫变得无关紧要。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;这是怎么发生的？ “每个人都在问：从情报的角度来看，为什么会出现如此完全的失明？”调查记者伊拉娜·达扬说道。与美国不同的是，以色列的安全战略越来越少地依赖陆军，而更多地依赖空军、特种部队，以及最重要的情报收集。然而哈马斯却成功地发动了一场毁灭性的、残酷的突然袭击。 “有数百甚至数千人参与了哈马斯的行动，”达扬继续说道，“以色列这个网络超级大国为何拥有世界上所谓最好的情报行动，能够准确地告诉你在哪里？一个哈马斯武装分子会见他的情妇，什么时间，或者一个民兵指挥官住在哪个公寓，他的床在哪里——为什么他们对这个计划一无所知？这是一场情报惨败。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;普费弗表示，多年来，尽管以色列政界人士与哈马斯和伊斯兰圣战组织的武装分子定期发生暴力冲突，但他们仍将加沙地带置于他们关注的边缘。安全机构相信，其无人机、信号情报、电话监控、地面线人、边境围栏、地下传感器，尤其是铁穹导弹防御系统等武器库将控制加沙。&lt;/ p>;&lt;p>;当我到达特拉维夫家中的历史学家夏皮拉时，她对以色列领导层的愤怒显而易见。 Shapira is the biographer of David Ben-Gurion, Berl Katznelson, and other pivotal figures in the founding of the state. So long as Israel remains focussed on war, she said, criticism of the security services and the government will be generally restrained. But there will almost certainly be a reckoning—as there had been for Golda Meir and Moshe Dayan, who shouldered much of the blame for the way Israel was caught by surprise in 1973.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“I hope they won&#39;t concentrate on the military leadership but will accuse Bibi himself,” she said. “Bibi is to blame for the fact that the Army was less prepared than it should have been. Bibi for the last ten years cultivated Hamas against the Ramallah government”—the Palestinian Authority and Mahmoud Abbas—“because this was his way to disrupt the possibility that the Palestinians would unite and maybe get a better deal.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Even before the attack, Shapira, who is in her eighties, had already spoken about her worries about Israel&#39;s future. An outspoken liberal, she had, a week earlier, told &lt;em>;Haaretz&lt;/em>; that she saw a rise of messianism and the diminishment of democratic values and institutions. “I always have days,” she said, “when I think about how to get a European passport”—not for her, “it&#39;s already a lost cause, but for my children and grandchildren.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Toward the end of our conversation, with the airwaves filled with images of destruction, Shapira told me that two of her grandsons, both in their early twenties, were stationed with the IDF in southern Israel. As a reader of her work, I&#39;ve always found it to be imbued with a sense of scholarly authority and confidence. But now when I asked her what might be ahead, she struggled: “People are so outraged that they are willing to give the Army almost carte blanche in Gaza. On the other hand, what will happen to everyone? What about the captives? Babies and mothers, girls, and old people. This is a situation that we have never seen before.” ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;dbwouv&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 10 Oct 2023 07:06:01 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Why the Internet Isn’t Fun Anymore]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.newyorker.com/culture/infinite-scroll/why-the-internet-isnt-fun-anymore]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-09T21:17:03.393Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/652058958ddd02a889a30583/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Chayka_Internet_still.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;article >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attribute-verso-pattern=&quot;article-body&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;ArticlePageChunks&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Lately on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, my timeline is filled with vapid posts orbiting the same few topics like water whirlpooling down a drain. Last week, for instance, the chatter was dominated by talk of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/sports/sporting-scene/kelce-swift-is-a-dream-pairing-for-the-nfl&quot;>;Taylor Swift&#39;s romance with the football player Travis Kelce&lt;/a>;. If you tried to talk about anything else, the platform&#39;s algorithmic feed seemed to sweep you into irrelevance. Users who pay for Elon Musk&#39;s blue-check verification system now dominate the platform, often with far-right-wing commentary and outright disinformation; Musk rewards these users monetarily based on the engagement that their posts drive, regardless of their veracity. The decay of the system is apparent in the spread of fake news and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/elon-musk-twitter-war-gaza-b2426241.html&quot;>;mislabelled videos&lt;/a>; related to Hamas&#39;s attack on Israel.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Elsewhere online, things are similarly bleak. Instagram&#39;s feed pushes months-old posts and product ads instead of photos from friends. Google search is cluttered with junky results, and SEO hackers have ruined the &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://twitter.com/Austen/status/1708530123610468854&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://twitter.com/Austen/status/1708530123610468854&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Austen/status/1708530123610468854&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;trick&lt;/a>; of adding “Reddit” to searches to find human-generated answers. Meanwhile, Facebook&#39;s parent company, Meta, in its latest bid for relevance, is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/meta-ai-chatbot-younger-users-dab6cb32&quot;>;reportedly developing&lt;/a>; artificial-intelligence chatbots with various “sassy” personalities that will be added to its apps, including a role-playing D. &amp;amp; D. Dungeon Master based on Snoop Dogg. The prospect of interacting with such a character sounds about as appealing as texting with one of those spam bots that asks you if they have the right number.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The social-media Web as we knew it, a place where we consumed the posts of our fellow-humans and posted in return, appears to be over. The precipitous decline of X is the bellwether for a new era of the Internet that simply feels less fun than it used to be. Remember having fun online? It meant stumbling onto a Web site you&#39;d never imagined existed, receiving a meme you hadn&#39;t already seen regurgitated a dozen times, and maybe even playing a little video game in your browser. These experiences don&#39;t seem as readily available now as they were a decade ago. In large part, this is because a handful of giant social networks have taken over the open space of the Internet, centralizing and homogenizing our experiences through their own opaque and shifting content-sorting systems. When those platforms decay, as Twitter has under &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/08/28/elon-musks-shadow-rule&quot;>;Elon Musk&lt;/a>;, there is no other comparable platform in the ecosystem to replace them. A few alternative sites, including Bluesky and Discord, have sought to absorb disaffected Twitter users. But like sproutlings on the rain-forest floor, blocked by the canopy, online spaces that offer fresh experiences lack much room to grow.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;One Twitter friend told me, of the platform&#39;s current condition, “I&#39;ve actually experienced quite a lot of grief over it.” It may seem strange to feel such wistfulness about a site that users habitually referred to as a “hellsite.” But I&#39;ve heard the same from many others who once considered Twitter, for all its shortcomings, a vital social landscape. Some of them still tweet regularly, but their messages are less likely to surface in my Swift-heavy feed. Musk &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://twitter.com/sarafischer/status/1709250682211987518&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://twitter.com/sarafischer/status/1709250682211987518&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/sarafischer/status/1709250682211987518&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;recently tweeted&lt;/a>; that the company&#39;s algorithm “tries to optimize time spent on X” by, say, boosting reply chains and downplaying links that might send people away from the platform. The new paradigm benefits tech-industry “thread guys,” prompt posts in the “what&#39;s your favorite Marvel movie” vein, and single-topic commentators like Derek Guy, who tweets endlessly about menswear. Algorithmic recommendations make already popular accounts and subjects even more so, shutting out the smaller, more magpie-ish voices that made the old version of Twitter such a lively destination. (Guy, meanwhile, has received so much algorithmic promotion under Musk that he accumulated more than half a million followers.)&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The Internet today feels emptier, like an echoing hallway, even as it is filled with more content than ever. It also feels less casually informative. Twitter in its heyday was a source of real-time information, the first place to catch wind of developments that only later were reported in the press. Blog posts and TV news channels aggregated tweets to demonstrate prevailing cultural trends or debates. Today, they do the same with TikTok posts—see the many local-news reports of dangerous and possibly fake “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.wsoctv.com/news/local/teens-may-be-running-away-home-get-likes-tiktok-trend-deputies-say/DRJTW73PDRACHNU5PHTW2L7P7A/&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.wsoctv.com/news/local/teens-may-be-running-away-home-get-likes-tiktok-trend-deputies-say/DRJTW73PDRACHNU5PHTW2L7P7A/&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.wsoctv.com/news/local/teens-may-be-running-away-home-get-likes-tiktok-trend-deputies-say/DRJTW73PDRACHNU5PHTW2L7P7A/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;TikTok trends&lt;/a>;”—but the TikTok feed actively dampens news and political content, in part because its parent company is beholden to the Chinese government&#39;s censorship policies. Instead, the app pushes us to scroll through another dozen videos of cooking demonstrations or funny animals. In the guise of fostering social community and user-generated creativity, it impedes direct interaction and discovery.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;According to Eleanor Stern, a TikTok video essayist with nearly a hundred thousand followers, part of the problem is that social media is more hierarchical than it used to be. “There&#39;s this divide that wasn&#39;t there before, between audiences and creators,” Stern said. The platforms that have the most traction with young users today—YouTube, TikTok, and Twitch—function like broadcast stations, with one creator posting a video for her millions of followers; what the followers have to say to one another doesn&#39;t matter the way it did on the old Facebook or Twitter. Social media “used to be more of a place for conversation and reciprocity,” Stern said. Now conversation isn&#39;t strictly necessary, only watching and listening.&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Posting on social media might be a less casual act these days, as well, because we&#39;ve seen the ramifications of blurring the border between physical and digital lives. Instagram ushered in the age of self-commodification online—it was the platform of the selfie—but TikTok and Twitch have turbocharged it. Selfies are no longer enough; video-based platforms showcase your body, your speech and mannerisms, and the room you&#39;re in, perhaps even in real time. Everyone is forced to perform the role of an influencer. The barrier to entry is higher and the pressure to conform stronger. It&#39;s no surprise, in this environment, that fewer people take the risk of posting and more settle into roles as passive consumers.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The patterns of life offscreen affect the makeup of the digital world, too. Having fun online was something that we used to do while idling in office jobs: stuck in front of computers all day, we had to find something on our screens to fill the down time. An earlier generation of blogs such as the Awl and Gawker seemed designed for aimless Internet surfing, delivering intermittent gossip, amusing videos, and personal essays curated by editors with quirky and individuated tastes. (When the Awl closed, in 2017, Jia Tolentino &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/the-end-of-the-awl-and-the-vanishing-of-freedom-and-fun-from-the-internet&quot;>;lamented the demise&lt;/a>; of “online freedom and fun.”) Now, in the aftermath of the pandemic, amid ongoing work-from-home policies, office workers are less tethered to their computers, and perhaps thus less inclined to chase likes on social media. They can walk away from their desks and take care of their children, walk their dog, or put their laundry in. This might have a salutary effect on individuals, but it means that fewer Internet-obsessed people are furiously creating posts for the rest of us to consume. The user growth rate of social platforms over all has slowed over the past several years; according to &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.insiderintelligence.com/insights/social-media-forecasts-worldwide&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.insiderintelligence.com/insights/social-media-forecasts-worldwide&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.insiderintelligence.com/insights/social-media-forecasts-worldwide&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;one estimate&lt;/a>;, it is down to 2.4 per cent in 2023.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;That earlier generation of blogs once performed the task of aggregating news and stories from across the Internet. For a while, it seemed as though social-media feeds could fulfill that same function. Now it&#39;s clear that the tech companies have little interest in directing users to material outside of their feeds. According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.axios.com/2023/06/27/social-media-news-consumption-slows-globally&quot;>;Axios&lt;/a>;, the top news and media sites have seen “organic referrals” from social media drop by more than half over the past three years. As of last week, X no longer displays the headlines for articles that users link to. The decline in referral traffic disrupts media business models, further degrading the quality of original content online. The proliferation of cheap, instant AI-generated content promises to make the problem worse.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;rhrg5n&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;p22ok5&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Choire Sicha, the co-founder of the Awl and now an editor at &lt;em>;New York&lt;/em>;, told me that he traces the seeds of social media&#39;s degradation back a decade. “If I had a time machine I&#39;d go back and assassinate 2014,” he said. That was the year of viral phenomena such as Gamergate, when a digital mob of disaffected video-game fans targeted journalists and game developers on social media; Ellen DeGeneres&#39;s selfie with a gaggle of celebrities at the Oscars, which got retweeted millions of times; and the brief, wondrous fame of Alex, a random teen retail worker from Texas who won attention for his boy-next-door appearance. In those events, we can see some of the nascent forces that would solidify in subsequent years: the tyranny of the loudest voices; the entrenchment of traditional fame on new platforms; the looming emptiness of the content that gets most furiously shared and promoted. But at that point they still seemed like exceptions rather than the rule.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I have been trying to recall the times I&#39;ve had fun online unencumbered by anonymous trolling, automated recommendations, or runaway monetization schemes. It was a long time ago, before social networks became the dominant highways of the Internet. What comes to mind is a Web site called Orisinal that hosted games made with Flash, the late interactive animation software that formed a significant part of the kitschy Internet of the two-thousands, before everyone began posting into the same platform content holes. The games on the site were cartoonish, cute, and pastel-colored, involving activities like controlling a rabbit jumping on stars into the sky or helping mice make a cup of tea. Orisinal was there for anyone to stumble upon, without the distraction of follower counts or sponsored content. You could e-mail the site to a friend, but otherwise there was nothing to share. That old version of the Internet is still there, but it&#39;s been eclipsed by the modes of engagement that the social networks have incentivized. Through Reddit, I recently dug up an emulator of all the Orisinal games and quickly got absorbed into one involving assisting deer leaping across a woodland gap. My only reward was a personal high score. But it was more satisfying, and less lonely, than the experience these days on X. ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;zy0oqb&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 10 Oct 2023 06:06:01 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Israel May Decimate Hamas, but Can It “Win” This War?]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/israel-may-decimate-hamas-but-can-it-win-this-war]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-09T21:30:14.035Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/652409873247af83769ada72/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Wright-Israel-Palestine.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;article >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attribute-verso-pattern=&quot;article-body&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;ArticlePageChunks&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;I landed in the Middle East for the first time on October 6, 1973. In the Beirut airport terminal, a woman turned to me and whispered in an anxious panic, “The Egyptians have just crossed the Suez Canal!” In a surprise offensive, code-named &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.wilsoncenter.org/article/the-islamists-turmoil-and-transformation-0&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.wilsoncenter.org/article/the-islamists-turmoil-and-transformation-0&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.wilsoncenter.org/article/the-islamists-turmoil-and-transformation-0&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;Operation Badr&lt;/a>;, after the Prophet Muhammad&#39;s first military victory in the seventh century, Syria and Egypt had invaded Israel on two opposite fronts. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/wendell-steavenson/egypt-remembering-the-6th-of-october&quot;>;Yom Kippur War&lt;/a>; lasted almost three weeks. The Arabs lost militarily, but believed they had won psychologically and politically—forcing Israel to recognize that it was vulnerable and eventually would have to make peace with its enemies. Fifty years later, Hamas is a third-rate militia compared with Syrian and Egyptian forces, let alone Israel&#39;s sophisticated Army and arsenal. Yet the conflict that erupted this weekend feels more ominous. “Powerful, centrifugal forces have been unleashed that have rewritten the rules for the entire region,” Bruce Hoffman, the senior fellow for counterterrorism at the Council on Foreign Relations, told me. Unlike confrontations in previous decades which followed a pattern of death, destruction, and negotiated ceasefires, this war is “completely unpredictable,” Hoffman said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Even a decisive Israeli military victory is unlikely to end the country&#39;s increasingly perilous security challenges. It&#39;s not even clear what “winning” means. “There&#39;s no question Israel can inflict tremendous damage on Gaza—on its infrastructure and on its people—and can also target Hamas leaders,” Dan Kurtzer, a former US Ambassador to Israel, told me. But movements regenerate, and “sometimes the next leadership turns out to be more radical, more extreme, than the one that was beheaded,” Kurtzer said. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tag/al-qaeda&quot;>;Al Qaeda&lt;/a>; of Iraq, for example, &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://counterterrorismethics.tudelft.nl/terrorist-group-isis/#:~:text=Though%20the%20Islamic%20State%20finds,caliph%2C%20Abu%20Bakr%20al%20Baghdadi.&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://counterterrorismethics.tudelft.nl/terrorist-group-isis/#:~:text=Though%20the%20Islamic%20State%20finds,caliph%2C%20Abu%20Bakr%20al%20Baghdadi.&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://counterterrorismethics.tudelft.nl/terrorist-group-isis/#:~:text=Though%20the%20Islamic%20State%20finds,caliph%2C%20Abu%20Bakr%20al%20Baghdadi.&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;evolved&lt;/a>; into the Islamic State of Iraq and then, after a US air strike &lt;a href=&quot;https://dod.defense.gov/OIR/gallery/igphoto/2001244730/&quot;>;killed&lt;/a>; its founder in 2006, into &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/topics/isis&quot;>;&lt;em >;ISIS&lt;/em>;&lt;/a>; in 2013.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Hamas has already achieved some of its objectives in terrorizing Israelis and stunning a country that long seemed almost invincible in the region. “If the war stopped today, or even after Gaza looks like another war zone, Hamas has effectively won,” Kurtzer told me. Their immediate goals “have been achieved or are achievable.” The conflict has also, at least for now, almost certainly scuttled US diplomacy to broker formal rapprochement between Saudi Arabia and Israel, a pivotal step for Israel to gain recognition from a long-standing adversary. Over the weekend, Saudi Arabia &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.arabnews.com/node/2386901/middle-east&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.arabnews.com/node/2386901/middle-east&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.arabnews.com/node/2386901/middle-east&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;condemned&lt;/a>; the “continued occupation, the deprivation of the Palestinian people of their legitimate rights, and the repetition of systematic provocations against its sanctities.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Hamas&#39;s brazen operation—missiles fired as far as Tel Aviv; murder, mayhem, and hostage-taking on the ground; fighters infiltrating Israel on paragliders—has generated fears of a wider conflagration involving other militias and potentially other nations, including Iran and the United States, directly or indirectly. “We suspect Iranian hands behind the scenes,” the Israeli Ambassador Michael Herzog said on “Face the Nation,” on Sunday. The US pushed back. On “Meet the Press,” Secretary of State Antony Blinken said, “We don&#39;t have anything that shows us that Iran was directly involved in this attack, in planning it or in carrying it out, but that&#39;s something we&#39;re looking at very carefully.” But he acknowledged that “Hamas wouldn&#39;t be Hamas without the support it&#39;s had for many years from Iran.” Later on Sunday, the &lt;em>;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em>; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/world/middle-east/iran-israel-hamas-strike-planning-bbe07b25&quot;>;reported&lt;/a>; that the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps had green-lighted the attack.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Tehran has long been the primary source of arms, financial aid, and military training for Hamas, which makes no secret of the alliance. In remarks following the last major war between Israel and Hamas, in 2021, Yahya Sinwar, the head of Hamas in Gaza, said, “All the thanks goes to the Islamic Republic in Iran that hasn&#39;t been stingy with us over the years.” The US has sanctioned more than four hundred Iranian individuals and companies for providing support to Hamas. The potential for a wider war could be “seismic” in the Middle East, Hoffman said.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;The tension is now tangible. On Saturday, as Hamas fighters rampaged across southern Israel, President Joe Biden issued a warning: “This is not a moment for any party hostile to Israel to exploit these attacks to seek advantage.” Over the weekend, the Administration reinforced that message in conversations with allies, surely hoping that they would emphasize the point to Iran and its well-armed proxies in Lebanon, Syria, and Iraq. On Sunday, the Pentagon ordered a carrier group of warships to the region. It also announced plans to “augment” US warplane squadrons “to address the risks of any party seeking to expand the conflict,” General Michael Kurilla, the Central Command chief, said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Iran has expressed voluble support for Hamas since the war began. Over the weekend, President Ebrahim Raisi &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://en.mehrnews.com/news/206885/Raeisi-holds-phone-calls-with-Islamic-Jihad-Hamas-chiefs&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://en.mehrnews.com/news/206885/Raeisi-holds-phone-calls-with-Islamic-Jihad-Hamas-chiefs&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://en.mehrnews.com/news/206885/Raeisi-holds-phone-calls-with-Islamic-Jihad-Hamas-chiefs&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;spoke&lt;/a>; with leaders of Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad, according to Iranian media. In a public message, he called on Muslim governments worldwide to support the Palestinian people. Since the nineteen-eighties, Iran has created an unofficial alliance of militias in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, and Yemen—known as the Axis of Resistance—under the tutelage of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. They all now have missiles, rockets, and drones capable of hitting Israel. Hezbollah&#39;s arsenal, which is estimated to include at least a hundred and fifty thousand missiles and rockets, is far larger than the Hamas armory.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Since the Yom Kippur War, Israel&#39;s wars have all been with militias. It fought the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/another-summer-another-siege-israels-war-plo&quot;>;Palestine Liberation Organization&lt;/a>;, in Lebanon, in 1982; Hezbollah in 2006; and Hamas in 2008, 2014, and 2021. Defeating non-state actors is a lot more complicated than warring or making peace with a state. As Blinken noted on “Meet the Press,” unlike the 1973 war, the new Hamas offensive is a “massive terrorist attack targeting Israeli civilians.” The United States learned the challenges of engaging with non-state actors in long wars against the poorly armed &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/q-and-a/how-america-failed-in-afghanistan&quot;>;Taliban in Afghanistan&lt;/a>; and the abysmally trained &lt;em >;ISIS&lt;/em>; fighters in Iraq—at great expense.&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;The prospects of a temporary ceasefire, as has happened in the past, appear remote. Hamas now seems all-in on its &lt;a href=&quot;https://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/hamas.asp&quot;>;covenant&lt;/a>; to obliterate Israel, Hoffman said. Hamas, however, is also fragmented, politically and physically, Kurtzer noted. It has a diehard military wing inside Gaza, a diaspora leadership in Palestinian-refugee camps in Lebanon, and political leaders based in Qatar. “I don&#39;t know what Hamas is,” he told me. Its representatives in Doha engage with the outside world, he added, but “what about these guys who spent their lives digging tunnels, crafting weapons out of telephone poles and then integrating them with whatever they could smuggle in from Iran and other places? Those guys, they want to fight.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Ironically, Israel bears responsibility for the early growth of Hamas. In the mid-eighties, it supported the coalescence of nascent Islamist groups as an alternative to the PLO “because they were religious and not nationalistic,” Kurtzer said. Looking back, Israel has also ignored the regional trend of rag-tag militias challenging powerful states. Kurtzer noted that the mujahideen confronted the Soviet Union in Afghanistan and Hezbollah took on Israel in Lebanon. (Both militias prevailed.) The US contributed to the political rise of Hamas in 2006 by insisting on democratic elections to solidify a Palestinian government willing to back a peace agreement with Israel. Hamas won a majority of the seats in the parliament. It eventually wrested control of Gaza away from Fatah, which was willing to engage diplomatically with Israel. That split the Palestinian government into two parts—in the West Bank and Gaza—and effectively doomed the peace process. After the election, then Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice mused, “Certainly, I&#39;ve asked why nobody saw it coming, and I hope that we will take a hard look, because it does say something about perhaps not having had a good enough pulse on the Palestinian population.” The words are haunting, once again, today. ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;0zfs0n&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;bvpi2a&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 10 Oct 2023 06:06:01 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Remembering Terence Davies, the Greatest British Director]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-front-row/remembering-terence-davies-the-greatest-british-director]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-09T21:30:36.836Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65241aad1e13d90b65f6fbdc/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Brody-Terence-Davies-Postscript.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;article >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attribute-verso-pattern=&quot;article-body&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;ArticlePageChunks&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;There&#39;s a special pain to the news of the death of the British filmmaker Terence Davies on Saturday at the age of seventy-seven: his career, filled with some of the greatest movies of the past forty years, has always seemed just to be getting started, and, to the end, he kept the exuberant bearing of youth. He was past forty when he made his first feature, “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/goings-on-about-town/movies/distant-voices-still-lives&quot;>;Distant Voices, Still Lives&lt;/a>;” (1988)—one of the most original of all début features—and he only made eight more, not because he worked slowly but because the money was slow in coming. Although Davies was among the most accomplished of filmmakers, he remained a perpetual beginner, always on the verge of breaking out but never quite getting there. He reached old age with too few films made—a grievous loss to the history of cinema—but with the ardor, the urgency, and the curiosity of youth unabated. He never made a “late” film; no work of his suggests a detached philosophical overview or a foot in the beyond. The paradoxes and complexities of his character run through his output and his life—and they were also very much on the surface, on public display.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I had the honor and the pleasure of meeting Davies on several occasions (including onstage, in 2016, at The New Yorker Festival). In person, he was hearty and vigorous, wryly and effervescently humorous, a trait that spilled over into his cinematic taste: he expressed unflagging enthusiasm for classic Hollywood musicals at every chance he got, whether &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/terence-davies-here-and-now&quot;>;in front of an audience at &lt;em >;MOMA&lt;/em>;&lt;/a>;, about a decade ago, or in his ballot for the 2022 &lt;em>;Sight and Sound&lt;/em>; poll. Yet his own films were marked by a keen sense of ambient tragedy and often scarred by the horrors of war. The American experience of the Second World War shapes “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-front-row/weekend-streaming-the-neon-bible-a-coming-of-age-tale-set-amid-music-and-horror&quot;>;The Neon Bible&lt;/a>;,” and the British experience of it shapes “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/what-to-see-this-weekend-the-deep-blue-sea-and-more&quot;>;The Deep Blue Sea&lt;/a>;.” (A scene of Londoners seeking shelter in an Underground station during a German bombing raid is one of his most spectacular creations.) The Civil War is an important part of his Emily Dickinson bio-pic “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/terence-daviess-truthful-fictions-about-emily-dickinson&quot;>;A Quiet Passion&lt;/a>;,” and the First World War is decisive in “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/02/22/terence-daviess-sunset-song&quot;>;Sunset Song&lt;/a>;.” It is also the very heart of his last film, “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-front-row/benediction-reviewed-the-bio-pic-as-radical-melodrama&quot;>;Benediction&lt;/a>;,” a bio-pic about the poet Siegfried Sassoon.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Davies was one of the prime historical filmmakers, never making a dramatic feature set in the present day. But his sense of history wasn&#39;t staid or academic; it was intensely personal. Having started late—he worked an office job for a dozen years before attending drama school and beginning to make movies—he unleashed a backlog of pent-up experience and emotion in his first two features, “Distant Voices, Still Lives” and “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/goings-on-about-town/movies/the-long-day-closes&quot;>;The Long Day Closes&lt;/a>;” (1992), two of the most passionate and formally original autobiographical childhood dramas. Both are set in his home town of Liverpool, in families that, like his own, are Catholic. The first shows a young boy enduring paternal brutality; the second shows an older boy nicknamed (like Davies) Bud, in adolescence, experiencing bullying and trying (again, like Davies) to reconcile the realization of his homosexuality with harsh Church doctrine. For all their severity, both movies are musicals—musical tragedies, as are most of Davies&#39;s films—and his innovative way of filming music is integral to his dramatic artistry. The boy&#39;s family circle, the friends and neighbors who gather at his house and at the pub, musicalize the movies with their a cappella renditions of popular ballads, jukebox hits, and gems from the Great American Songbook. In “The Long Day Closes,” the maturing Bud has become a denizen of the movie theatre, where he experiences the exhilarations of Hollywood musicals and also the power of Hollywood tragedy—including in Orson Welles&#39;s masterwork of the ravages of time and history, “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/goings-on-about-town/movies/magnificent-ambersons&quot;>;The Magnificent Ambersons&lt;/a>;.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;The world that surrounds Davies&#39;s alter ego in both films—the music and movies, the fashions, the manners, the joys and heartbreaks—is his aesthetic education, and this apprenticeship in style and soulfulness comes largely from women of grand character in constraining circumstances. The five features that followed these first two all revolved around free-spirited women, heroines whose audacity caused scandal and got them into trouble but also graced their worlds with an evanescent beauty that Davies indelibly enshrined. Four of them—“The Neon Bible” (1995), “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/goings-on-about-town/movies/the-house-of-mirth&quot;>;The House of Mirth&lt;/a>;” (2000), “The Deep Blue Sea” (2011), and “Sunset Song” (2015)—were literary adaptations, and the last and most exalted of them, “A Quiet Passion,” from 2016, was an agonized yet comic bio-pic of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2008/08/04/her-own-society&quot;>;Emily Dickinson&lt;/a>;, a sort of screwball tragedy, which Davies called his “most autobiographical” film. (Dickinson&#39;s poetry itself, recited on the soundtrack, also functions as a sort of verbal score, a culmination of Davies&#39;s ever more daring ways to film music.)&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Davies was the great cinematic poet of memory, and thus of loss and regret. He didn&#39;t live in the past, but, rather, the past—personal, social, artistic—lived in him. The outward differences of former times mattered little to Davies. He experienced his characters&#39; passions in the present tense and filmed them with immediacy, intensity, and a sense of style that is central to his artistry. Costumes and décor were exquisitely expressive, and he was fervently attentive to actors&#39; diction and gesture. Above all, Davies&#39;s cinematic inventiveness fused meticulously detailed recreations of the past with breathtaking flourishes of brazen artifice. (It&#39;s because of this sense of style, and his intense identification with the heroine of “The House of Mirth,” that I prize his Edith Wharton adaptation over Martin Scorsese&#39;s “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/goings-on-about-town/movies/the-age-of-innocence&quot;>;The Age of Innocence&lt;/a>;.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Unmoored, by the power of his imaginative sympathy, from the mere incidentals of the present tense, Davies was impatient with the clamorous demands of the current day, and his indifference to modern fashions and trends jeopardized his career. In 2008, after years of frustration trying to get financing for dramas, he made a personal documentary, “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/goings-on-about-town/movies/of-time-and-the-city-2&quot;>;Of Time and the City&lt;/a>;,” about Liverpool, the home town that, as he says, he&#39;d not only left but also lost. He decries the changes that the city has endured—the collapse of industry, urban transformations, and the resulting end to the tight community life that he&#39;d depicted in his first features. (There is also a well-aimed barb at the city&#39;s most famous musical export.) Davies laments the spirit of modernity as hollow, not least, because he was hardly a beneficiary of it.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Davies left the Catholic Church, but its strictures continued to shape his life as a gay man. Afflicted with an enduring sense of fear, shame, and guilt, he remained mostly celibate, he said, and this experience informed the feature that turned out to be his last, his Sassoon bio-pic, “Benediction.” In the First World War, the protagonist finds his literary voice and both gains and loses the love of his life, the poet Wilfred Owen. After a string of reckless same-sex relationships, he seeks an escape from despair in traditional marriage and family, but his life becomes loveless and embittered, prompting a late conversion to Catholicism. Turning away from the diminished realities of his later years, he grows ever more deeply absorbed in the past, and his aestheticized inner reanimation of his best, lost times is realized in the movie&#39;s final scene, as an overwhelming, music-drenched cinematic experience. This wasn&#39;t meant to be Davies&#39;s last movie; he was ready to shoot an adaptation of Stefan Zweig&#39;s “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Post-Office-Girl-Review-Books-Classics/dp/1590172620&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Post-Office-Girl-Review-Books-Classics/dp/1590172620&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Post-Office-Girl-Review-Books-Classics/dp/1590172620&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;The Post-Office Girl&lt;/a>;,” but the funding didn&#39;t come through. Nonetheless, it&#39;s a spectacular and fitting ending to the career of the greatest of all British filmmakers. ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot;

In 2010, when Tesla was losing money and making commercial lenders wary, the Department of Energy lent the company more than four hundred million dollars to build its first real factory. And SpaceX started getting &lt;em >;NASA&lt;/em>; contracts only after Obama-era officials defied the Republican senator Richard Shelby, who wanted the government to continue giving no-bid contracts to the Marshall Space Flight Center and its suppliers. Government money contributed enormously to the success of many high-tech businesses; ultimately, it also helped to create billionaires who, like Musk, spread the myth that they did everything on their own.&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;&lt;em>;Victor Yodaiken&lt;/em>;&lt;br/>;&lt;em>;Austin, Texas&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h2 >;Finding a Home&lt;/h2>;&lt;p >;I appreciated Jennifer Egan&#39;s article about a new supportive-housing building in Dumbo (“Off the Street,” September 18th). Her portraits of its residents were candid and beautiful. I wish, however, that she had discussed in greater detail the plight of domestic-violence victims. Because eligibility requirements for affordable housing in New York City are narrow, this group faces unique challenges when looking for a place to live. At present, domestic-violence victims can spend approximately six months in specialized shelters, but after that they must seek other options. Those with children have more choices than those without, but in both cases victims can end up in general shelters, where, as Egan&#39;s reporting attests, people who have already experienced traumas might be especially vulnerable. Supportive housing is an option only for people who have been diagnosed with mental illness or a substance-abuse disorder. But the special circumstances that apply to survivors, along with the limited options they have, amount to a strong case that access should be expanded to include them.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;em>;Rebecca Chun&lt;/em>;&lt;br/>;&lt;em>;New York, NY&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h2 >;Betty Friedan&#39;s Past&lt;/h2>;&lt;p >;Moira Donegan, in her review of new books about Betty Friedan, describes the feminist pioneer as finding “her first political identity,” as a Communist, in her college years (Books, September 18th). As the author of a biography of Friedan that was published by the University of Massachusetts Press in 1998, I would argue that Friedan already had a left-wing political identity before that time. It would be more precise to describe her during college as belonging to the American Popular Front, and committed to a range of issues, including antifascism, unions, and equality for women.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The notion that Friedan later gave up a prestigious fellowship “so as not to emasculate” her boyfriend is also dubious. Friedan wrote something to this effect in “The Feminine Mystique,” twenty years after the period in question. But the claim is difficult to verify. At one point, Friedan dated David Bohm, a theoretical physicist who studied under J. Robert Oppenheimer; she also dated Robert Loevinger, another of his students. (Oppenheimer wanted Bohm to join him at Los Alamos, but Bohm&#39;s appointment was blocked for political reasons. Loevinger did go to Los Alamos.) Ultimately, historians do not know much with certainty about Friedan&#39;s relationships at this time, so we cannot establish that a fear of emasculation played a role in any of them.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;&lt;em>;Daniel Horowitz&lt;/em>;&lt;br/>;&lt;em>;Professor Emeritus, American Studies&lt;/em>;&lt;br/>;&lt;em>;Smith College&lt;/em>;&lt;br/>;&lt;em>;Cambridge, Mass.&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;align-center&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:align-center&quot;>;&lt;p >;•&lt;/p>;&lt;/inline-embed>;&lt;p >;&lt;em>;Letters should be sent with the writer&#39;s name, address, and daytime phone number via e-mail to &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:themail@newyorker.com?Subject=Letters&quot;>;themail@newyorker.com&lt;/a>;.

As the two teams were warming up, a contact lens fell to the court from the eye of a Princeton player. He bent over to pick it up but couldn&#39;t see it. Teammates stopped their drills and came to help. They got down on their hands and knees and grovelled, crawled like bugs. Some went completely prone and squinted down along the floorboards. No one saw the lens. Princeton&#39;s Bill Bradley, who happened to be on the sideline talking to his coach, watched with a curiosity that evolved toward impatience as five minutes went by. People in the stands were clapping in unison. Bradley had enough. Leaving the sideline, he walked to mid-court, stopped, bent forward, and pointed at the lens.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Focus like that is an obvious asset in the central vision of a basketball player, and so is peripheral vision, which adds so much to court sense. When Bill was in high school, in Crystal City, Missouri, he would walk down the streets with blinders on his eyes to see if he could read the signs in shopwindows on either side. Nonsense? Court sense. In early December of his senior year at Princeton, I persuaded him to go with me to an ophthalmologist, who plotted his peripheral vision within circles on a graph, and we found that Bill could see as much as twenty-three degrees more than most people. Bill could practically see out the back of his head, let alone a bit of plastic on a floor.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I described these optical scenes in a &lt;em>;New Yorker&lt;/em>; Profile in January, 1965. Princeton went to the Final Four that season, an extracurricular distraction that left Bradley with an intensified deadline for his senior thesis. He was a history major, and his subject—for which he had completed all interviews and other research—was Harry Truman&#39;s second senatorial campaign. Back in Princeton from the Final Four, where he had scored fifty-eight points in his last college game, he was getting so much press attention that he needed a place to hide, a place to write. He hid for a couple of weeks in my house. My wife and I had gone to Florida to begin the research for a piece on oranges, and our children went off with grandparents. We lived in a rural setting. Bill, alone, spooked in the night, heard ghosts. Goblins. Ghouls. Writing day and night about Harry Truman, he sat at my typing table. There was a rug of great value beneath the table. Wearing shoes with sharp leather heels, as nervous as a professional writer, he fidgeted with his feet, scuffing as he wrote, and destroyed the rug, leaving behind a bundle of Persian shreds.&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;Bill Bradley outside his garage in 1965.&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/651dd2e1573040966bd31a26/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/231016_r43185.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/651dd2e1573040966bd31a26/master/w_120,c_limit/231016_r43185.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/651dd2e1573040966bd31a26/master/w_240,c_limit/231016_r43185.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/651dd2e1573040966bd31a26/master/w_320,c_limit/231016_r43185.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/651dd2e1573040966bd31a26/master/w_640,c_limit/231016_r43185.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/651dd2e1573040966bd31a26/master/w_960,c_limit/231016_r43185.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/651dd2e1573040966bd31a26/master/w_1280,c_limit/231016_r43185.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/651dd2e1573040966bd31a26/master/w_1600,c_limit/231016_r43185.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;Outside the author&#39;s garage, in 1965.&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Photograph by John McPhee&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;p >;I had not met him until 1964, although I had watched him since he was a freshman, when he set some sort of record by making fifty-seven consecutive free throws. As a junior, he agreed to the &lt;em>;New Yorker&lt;/em>; piece, although he wondered why I wasn&#39;t doing it for &lt;em>;Time&lt;/em>;, where I was employed. He spent a large part of that summer in Princeton, reading for his thesis, and he was also in the gym a lot, often just with me feeding basketballs to him, as he kept his edge for the upcoming Tokyo Olympic Games. When he went home to Crystal City, I went with him. His mother put me in a bedroom that looked out on Taylor Avenue and Grace Presbyterian Church, their church. We ran a couple of miles each day on a high-school track. And one day we went to Don Bosco, a basketball camp ten miles west, where Bill introduced me to Ed Macauley.&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Macauley ran the camp and Bradley was a featured guest. Macauley had also worked for the St. Louis Hawks, as their star center, and had been an All-American at Saint Louis University. He was known as Easy Ed, for the time it took him to come up the floor. While his teammates ran a fast break, he trailed them almost at a walk. Easy Ed was six feet eight, Bill six-five. Nineteen years later, I accompanied Bill on a campaign visit to the boardwalk in Seaside Heights, New Jersey, where he bucked the currents of a human river behind a sign that read “&lt;em >;MEET SENATOR BRADLEY&lt;/em>;.” One potential voter he met said, “Man, are you tall. You looked small when you played for the Knicks.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“I &lt;em>;was&lt;/em>; small when I played for the Knicks,” the Senator said. Right enough. He was the small forward. And now, in 1964, at Camp Don Bosco, in Missouri, I was walking up a dirt road with Bill Bradley and Ed Macauley. The road consisted of deep parallel ruts with a grassy hump in the middle. Bradley was in one rut, Macauley in the other, and I was up on the hump between them. I am smaller than most people—about as small as Andrew Carnegie, James Madison, Vladimir Putin, Joseph Stalin, and Napoleon Bonaparte. Actually, I was five feet seven at my zenith and have lately condensed. The hump was a good foot higher than the ruts. Nonetheless, the three of us in outline formed the letter M.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Bill spent the early days of his senior year in Tokyo, winning a gold medal. Other Princeton people were there, too—Lesley Bush, a platform diver, who was in her fourth year at Princeton High School; Jed Graef, a backstroker, who had just graduated from the university; and my father, the head physician for the US team. All three athletes were gold medallists. There was withal a matter of yen. If athletes wanted to watch competition in a sport other than their own, they had to pay to get in. Jed wanted to watch the basketball. Bill found a spare equipment bag, added some costume touches, and marched Jed into the arena as a member of the American team. At this point in this narrative, I cannot resist flashing forward to 2003, when Jed&#39;s daughter Dana was a sophomore in my Princeton writing class. One of her essays was about her childhood in western New York. Her mother is a Buddhist priest. Dana said in the essay:&lt;/p>;&lt;blockquote >;&lt;div >;&lt;p>;I played in the snow, cut tulips from our neighbors&#39; yard, and stole cookies year round. I ate crepes for Easter, latkes for Channukah, and chocolate almost every day. I hid our guests&#39; keys when I wanted them to stay, and rode home from preschool on my father&#39;s shoulders. I wore a white lace dress for my mother&#39;s ordination, a gray satin dress for her sanctioning, and a green dress for my father&#39;s inauguration into the Swimming Hall of Fame.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/blockquote>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;qy78h&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;When Bill Bradley was young, his mother signed him up for enough swimming lessons to improve a bluefin tuna. She was an athlete, a golf-club champion. Bill never took to golf. Tennis lessons produced neither an overhead nor a backhand down the line. But he was somewhat impressed by his competence as a swimmer. For seven years in the nineteen-seventies, my family spent July at a house beside a lake in northern New Hampshire. Actually, we were two merged families, with lots of kids, but we had enough canoes and Rangeley boats to go around. When Bill and his wife, Ernestine, first visited us there, Bill stepped off the dock and into a canoe. He chose a place quite close to one end of the canoe. The other end shot up into the air, pointed at the sky, while Bill&#39;s end penetrated the lake with him in it. I had never heard him mention canoeing lessons. This was in the middle of his ten years as a Knick. The next summer, he announced on arrival that ABC, for its program “The Superstars,” had invited him to Florida with other professional athletes to compete in various sports other than their own. Bill would be competing as a swimmer. So he wanted to take advantage of our lake to prepare to race on television. I had competed in swimming only as a boy at summer camp, but I didn&#39;t lose a race in ten years. For what else it may be worth, I had also been an American Red Cross water-safety instructor during summers in my college years.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I gestured toward a diving raft that was forty or fifty yards from the dock. I said I would be pleased to help him train for television and would race him from the dock to the raft. The look on his face was not exactly contemptuous; it would be interpretive to call it a smirk. There was some of that, but mainly he was concealing amusement, and doing his best not to be insulting, not even to seem indulgent. It was clear, though, that he thought my offer absurd.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Three, two, one, go! When Bill reached the raft, I was waiting for him there. We had a telephone on the porch of the lakeside house. Bill swam back to the dock, climbed out, went to the telephone dripping, touched a bunch of buttons, got ABC on the phone, and cancelled his trip to Florida.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;In fact, he was acting, pantomiming, faking a phone call to Florida. He was connected to no one at ABC or anywhere else. There is more clown in him than most people have had a chance to discern. He went to Florida, he was on the show, and he won something.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The swimming race was unimagined and ten years in the future when &lt;em>;The&lt;/em>; &lt;em>;New Yorker&lt;/em>; published my Profile of Bill Bradley. My participation in the process occurred in William Shawn&#39;s office, where he had checking proofs, copy-editor proofs, and every other kind of proof, including his own, none of which he showed to me as he brought up point after point and discussed them with me. &lt;em>;The New Yorker&#39;s&lt;/em>; criterion was that the writer be satisfied, and in that criterion I was immersed for the first time.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;As I wrote in 2017 in my book “Draft No. 4”:&lt;/p>;&lt;blockquote >;&lt;div >;&lt;p>;Shawn edited the piece himself, as he routinely did with new writers of long fact, breaking them in, so to speak, but not exactly like a horse, more like a baseball mitt. For a week or so before the press date, we met each day and went through galleys from comma to comma, with an extra beat for a semicolon. 。 。 。 Now and again, Mr. Shawn said things that were most encouraging to a fretful, not to say neurotic, unconfident writer. He had had a lot of practice.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/blockquote>;&lt;p >;He made me feel entirely comfortable in his presence, so comfortable that when the &lt;em>;Daily Princetonian&lt;/em>; published its annual Joke Issue two days after &lt;em>;The&lt;/em>; &lt;em>;New Yorker&lt;/em>; published the Bradley Profile, I took a copy of the Joke Issue to West Forty-third Street to show to Mr. Shawn. A big, bold, wall-to-wall headline said:&lt;/p>;&lt;blockquote >;&lt;div >;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;align-center&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:align-center&quot;>;&lt;p>;BRADLEY BOOTED-OUT!&lt;br/>;Olympian Took Dope,&lt;br/>;Threw Cornell Game&lt;/p>;&lt;/inline-embed>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/blockquote>;&lt;p >;A front-page sidebar contained the reaction of Harry Truman, a quote begun by chaste symbols—?!*%#—meant to suggest unprintable words. “I never did trust that boy,” Harry said. Elsewhere on the front page was a photograph of Grant Wood&#39;s “American Gothic,” under the words “Parents Receive News Stoically.” Without explanation, I handed the Joke Issue to Shawn, thinking that he would get it immediately and laugh. He didn&#39;t get it, and he didn&#39;t laugh. His face reddened. He looked stricken. I spluttered explanation. I wasn&#39;t ninety-two then, as I am at this writing. I was thirty-three going on thirteen. I desperately hoped to join the &lt;em>;New Yorker&lt;/em>; staff. This, in a crowded field, is the dumbest thing I ever did.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;xf03pg&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;When Bill was at Oxford, studying PPE (Politics, Philosophy, and Economics) as a Rhodes Scholar, he not only played basketball for the university but also flew to Italy to play professionally for a Milanese meatpacker called Simmenthal. In his second Oxford year, he wrote to me asking that I go to Trenton and buy from the state government a book titled “New Jersey Civil Practice Laws and Rules.” I sent it to Oxford. Widely predicted to be a future governor of Missouri, Bill was weaving the first threads of a carpetbag.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;The Knicks had drafted him, and after he returned from Oxford, in 1967, he had his first tryout with the team, at the Knicks&#39; training center, in Farmingdale, on Long Island. Red Holzman, the coach, studied Bill in the company of the team&#39;s best players, among them Dick Barnett, Walt Frazier, and Willis Reed. Willis, six-ten, was the Knickerbockers&#39; franchise player, the team captain, its leading scorer. Like planets, the others orbited around him. And off they went in full-court scrimmage in Farmingdale. Bill was an exceptional passer, a pinpoint passer, but his first pass to Willis connected with nothing and bounced away, hitting the base of the empty stands. A minute or two later, after Willis set a pick, as he had before, Bill ran his defender into the pick, again expecting Willis to roll suddenly away from his defender, coming open for a bounce pass, in this classic set piece of basketball. Again, the pass went bouncing off on its own. Holzman blew his whistle and stepped onto the court to tell Bill, “Willis doesn&#39;t roll.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;This flat statement made a deep entry into the comic wit of Robert Bingham, the &lt;em>;New Yorker&lt;/em>; fact editor to whom Mr. Shawn assigned me after my first two Profiles. Bingham was my editor for sixteen years, before he died, in his fifties. He dragged my confidence past numerous barriers, and he treated my manuscripts as if they were mine, looking up now and again from some hot-dog line I&#39;d written and saying, “Willis doesn&#39;t roll.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Bill, meanwhile, got off to a slow, discouraging start with the Knicks, not getting much game time, and even being booed in Madison Square Garden because of irrationally high expectations, not to mention a widespread skepticism prompted by the size of his signing bonus, for which he had been given the nickname Dollar Bill. I had admired him and what I heard about him since he was a freshman in college, and he would become a friend forever, but there would be no era in which I thought more highly of him than when he was struggling to make it with the Knicks, playing three minutes a game, or something of the kind, and surely feeling the threat of a depression the like of which he&#39;d never experienced.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;After basketball games in the Garden, he would go to dinner and the basketball did not go with him. His best asset, I had long thought, was his ability to compartmentalize the factors in his life, and never let his concentration on one thing spill over into others. When he went to dinner, with a variety of people, he dwelt on subjects that had nothing to do with his job. He was like that then, and he is like that now.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;By February, 1969, he was faring better. When the Knicks showed up in Milwaukee to play the Bucks, I happened to be nearby, spending a week as a writer-in-residence at Lake Forest Academy, in Illinois. I went to the game. The Knicks won. Bill had a standout game, and was confronted afterward by a man with a microphone asking for his pithiest analysis of the contest. Stepping into this cliché encounter, Bill took the microphone and analyzed the action, then reanalyzed the action, and gave a third and a fourth analysis, and was not about to give back the microphone. Changing the subject, he talked on, and on, and on, until the TV control room threw a switch.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;On Christmas Eve that year, in a New York movie theatre where continuous screenings ran far into the night, Bill stayed up late with me, watching Robert Redford in “Downhill Racer.” Since early summer, my wife and I had been separated, and therefore came Christmas without my daughters. Apart from a family death, if there is a lower moment in a physically healthy life I can&#39;t imagine it.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The Knicks&#39; season was in full flow. They beat the Detroit Pistons 112–111 that Christmas Day and lost to the Lakers the following night. They would see more of the Lakers and the Lakers would see more of them. The Lakers were Wilt Chamberlain. The Knicks were Dave DeBusschere, Bradley, Barnett, Frazier, and Captain Willis Reed. They were on a roll (but not that one). In June, they beat the Lakers in the NBA finals. It was the Knicks&#39; first championship. They won their second, also against the Lakers, in 1973, and at this writing the Knicks have yet to win another.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;His political ruminations notwithstanding, Bill thought about other futures, other professions, and one of these was photography. He bought a Nikon with multiple lenses and went at the challenge with the same dedication he had given to no-look passes and peripheral vision. One of his first artistic themes was life on the road, life on the run, the quotidian experience of a professional athlete, forever in airplanes, in unfamiliar cities, checking into and out of hotels. One example of this genre is on display in a fishing cabin owned by me and my family on the upper Delaware River. Made in Los Angeles, the picture is a point-blank view of a hotel under construction, shot from a room in a neighboring hotel so close that the picture shows no roofline or other defining edges, just twenty half-finished hotel rooms, full of building materials, and looking like a grotesque checkerboard, the itinerant athlete&#39;s total view. DeBusschere, Bill&#39;s roommate on the road, slept through most of that.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Fifty-eight years ago, I took an outdoor picture of Bill with our garage in the background. He was twenty-two. In more recent years, he has used that photograph in two of his books and in a long video he describes as “a performative autobiography.” In professional compensation, I have yet to see one red cent, let alone a dollar bill.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Bill had been a Knick for seven years when West Germany and the Netherlands reached the finals of the World Cup, in Munich. Bill was married now, and his wife—as smart a person as I have ever met, apart from nuclear scientists and geophysicists—had grown up Ernestine Misslbeck, in Ingolstadt, Bavaria, fifty miles from Munich. The Misslbecks wanted to attend the Cup final, a tough ticket if ever there was one. The match would occur on the seventh of July. Could Bill do something for his in-laws? He called the Milanese meatpacker he had played for when he was at Oxford. The company said it would obtain the tickets if Bill would fly to Italy and play one exhibition game for the meatpacker. He went.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;He was elected a US senator from New Jersey in 1978. His home was in Denville then, in Morris County. Earlier, when he had first planned to run for office in the state, I had sought and found a carpetbag, filled it up with New Jersey road maps, and given it to him. It hung on a peg high inside his front door for twenty years. It is now in the possession of Ernestine and Bill&#39;s daughter, Theresa Anne. She is my goddaughter. When Bill was in his early Senate days and had not yet bought a house in Washington, he borrowed the apartment of Carl Bernstein and Nora Ephron, who were somewhere else at the time. For a week or so, I was in Washington working on my geology project at the Smithsonian and at the US Geological Survey, nearby in Virginia. I stayed with Bill. Coming through the door, you faced a curvilinear wall with an Italian bicycle hanging on it like a work of art, which it was. It was worth more than a car. And it was not the most arresting sight there. The apartment was filled with Pat and Dick Nixon figurines, a Pat salt shaker with a Dick pepper shaker, Pat and Dick ceramics of every ilk, five years after Deep Throat and Woodward and Bernstein&#39;s reportage on Watergate.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;sb4tha&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Bill&#39;s new presence in the Senate gave rise to a trivia question that lasted for eighteen years around Princeton. People with nothing better to do entertained one another with this question: What Princeton basketball player became a Rhodes Scholar and later a United States senator? Answer: Paul Sarbanes, Princeton 1954. Sarbanes, from Maryland, served in the US Senate for thirty years, which included Bill Bradley&#39;s eighteen.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In 1970, on vacation in Maine, Bill began writing a book he called “Life on the Run.” His ten-year career in pro basketball was still not far from its beginning, but his theme was clear to him and was in part the theme expressed in the photograph he made in the Los Angeles hotel. Since my own first book had been about Bill, it was assumed by some that I had had a hand in Bill&#39;s first book. If you want to know the truth, he sent me the manuscript, asking me to vet it. I did, and wrote to him, saying, among other things, “Abandon the project, you&#39;ll embarrass yourself.” He still has the letter. He claims that—twenty years after “Life on the Run”—I suggested that he abandon the manuscript of his third book, “Time Present, Time Past.” He has also stored in his memory, and conceivably his alone, some magazine&#39;s list of “The 10 Best Sports Books of All Time.” “Life on the Run” was No. 4. “A Sense of Where You Are,” my book about him, No. 6. Not that it is relevant, but my book about him says, “He is everything his parents think he is.” Anybody with enough angst to destroy a rug while trying to write is a writer.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;When I was preparing this piece, Bill&#39;s daughter surprised me with a letter I had written to Bill fifty-eight years ago—a few days before he graduated from Princeton:&lt;/p>;&lt;blockquote >;&lt;div >;&lt;p>;We&#39;ve spent so much time talking together that I&#39;m going to miss it quite a bit. 。 。 。 There was always some sort of purpose, something to be accomplished . 。 。 but the thing I learned that impressed me most was that, although your discipline is justly celebrated, you know how to waste time every bit as much as I do, which means that you&#39;re a champion at it. For every hour in which something got done, two went out the window. The best two went out the window.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;At Drake&#39;s Corner Road, you will be missed by Laura, Sarah, and Jenny. 。 。 。 Martha will have to live down the disappointment of not having been old enough when you were here. Even the older children have no standards by which to judge you except what you&#39;re like when you&#39;re dealing with them, and all of them start acting as if Ringling Brothers is in town whenever you come up the driveway.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;. 。 。 I hope that you will be coming up the driveway for years and years. Come to think of it, that is what we&#39;re all going to miss most: the explosive sound of the tires biting into the red gravel; the after-burner cutting in when you reached the big poplar; and, as the car came into view, the impressionistic blur against the green of the trees; then, finally, the relieving sight of the arresting parachute opening out to the rear.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/blockquote>;&lt;p >;When Yolanda Whitman and I were married, fifty-plus years ago now, the mayor of Princeton officiated on the Princeton campus. We were five in all, and the two others—the witnesses—were my mother and Bill. He is the younger brother I never had, and I am the brother he never had. “Bro” is how he has signed his e-mails to me since soon after e-mail was introduced. ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 09 Oct 2023 19:06:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Jake Sullivan’s Trial by Combat]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/10/16/trial-by-combat]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-09T10:00:00.000Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/651dcf7d98d3cdbde1212c2e/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/231016_r43166.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;article >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attribute-verso-pattern=&quot;article-body&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;ArticlePageChunks&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;figure data-testid=&quot;IframeEmbed&quot; >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;IframeEmbedContainer&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;iframe height=&quot;90&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; sandbox=&quot;allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups&quot; title=&quot;Embedded Frame&quot; data-src=&quot;https://audm.herokuapp.com/player-embed?pub=newyorker&amp;amp;articleID=651d80ba6814f7b281e47dc0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay *; encrypted-media *; clipboard-write; autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture&quot;>;&lt;/iframe>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;p >;On a Monday afternoon in August, when President Joe Biden was on vacation and the West Wing felt like a ghost town, his national-security adviser, Jake Sullivan, sat down to discuss America&#39;s involvement in the war in Ukraine. Sullivan had agreed to an interview “with trepidation,” as he had told me, but now, in the White House&#39;s Roosevelt Room, steps from the Oval Office, he seemed surprisingly relaxed for a congenital worrier. (“It&#39;s my job to worry,” he once told an interviewer. “So I worry about literally everything.”) When I asked about reports that, at a recent &lt;em >;NATO&lt;/em>; summit, he had been furious during negotiations over whether to issue Ukraine a formal “invitation” to join the Western alliance, he said, only half jokingly, “First of all, I&#39;m, like, the most rational human being on the planet.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;But, when it came to the subject of the war itself, and why Biden has staked so much on helping Ukraine fight it, Sullivan struck an unusually impassioned note. “As a child of the eighties and &#39;Rocky&#39; and &#39;Red Dawn,&#39; I believe in freedom fighters and I believe in righteous causes, and I believe the Ukrainians have one,” he said. “There are very few conflicts that I have seen—maybe none—in the post-Cold War era . 。 。 where there&#39;s such a clear good guy and bad guy. And we&#39;re on the side of the good guy, and we have to do a lot for that person.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;There&#39;s no question that the United States has done a lot: American assistance to Ukraine, totalling seventy-six billion dollars, with more than forty-three billion for security aid, is the largest such effort since the Second World War. In the aftermath of the February 24, 2022, Russian invasion, the US has delivered more than two thousand Stinger anti-aircraft missiles, more than ten thousand Javelin antitank weapons, and more than two million 155-millimetre artillery rounds. It has sent Patriot missiles for air defense and High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems—known as &lt;em >;HIMARS&lt;/em>;—to give Ukraine longer-range strike capability; sophisticated Ghost drones and small hand-launched Puma drones; Stryker armored personnel carriers, Bradley fighting vehicles, and M1A1 Abrams tanks.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Biden has framed the conflict in sweeping, nearly civilizational terms, vowing to stick with Ukraine for “as long as it takes” to defeat the invaders, who—despite an estimated hundred and twenty thousand dead and a hundred and eighty thousand injured—still hold nearly twenty per cent of the country&#39;s territory. But at nearly every stage the Administration has faced sharp questions about the nature and the durability of the US commitment. Beyond the inevitable tensions with Ukraine&#39;s President, Volodymyr Zelensky, there are jostling Washington bureaucracies, restive European allies, and a growing Trumpist faction in the Republican-controlled House of Representatives, which is opposed to the bipartisan congressional bills that have, up until now, funded the war. A vocal peace camp, meanwhile, is demanding negotiations with Vladimir Putin to end the conflict, even as Secretary of State Antony Blinken has said there is currently little prospect for “meaningful diplomacy.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The task of leading the White House through such treacherous politics has fallen to Sullivan, who, when he was appointed, at the age of forty-four, was the youngest national-security adviser since McGeorge Bundy held the job, during the Vietnam War. “It&#39;s really Jake,” Ivo Daalder, a former US Ambassador to &lt;em >;NATO&lt;/em>;, who has consulted regularly with the National Security Council since the Russian invasion, told me. “He&#39;s the quartermaster of the war—and everything else.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Sullivan is lean, with wispy blond hair, a tendency to blush bright red, and a workaholic intensity unusual even by Washington&#39;s standards. (One night a few months ago, Sullivan discovered an intruder who had broken into his home at around 3 &lt;em >;am&lt;/em>;, because he was still up working.) In his office, there is a chart—updated frequently—showing countries&#39; current stocks of ammunition that might go to Ukraine. This spring, during the battle of Bakhmut, he knew the status of the fighting down to the city block. He often speaks with his counterpart in Kyiv, Zelensky&#39;s chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, two or three times a week, and has taken charge of everything from lobbying South Korea for artillery shells to running an emergency operation to get Ukraine additional power generators. Earlier this year, when Germany balked at sending Leopard tanks to Ukraine, Sullivan spent days in intensive talks with the German national-security adviser to secure them; in exchange, the US agreed to provide M1A1 Abrams tanks, a move that the Pentagon had long opposed. The NSC, in other words, has gone operational, with Sullivan personally overseeing the effort while also doing the rest of his job, which, in recent months, has taken him to secret meetings with a top Chinese official in Vienna and Malta and to complicated negotiations in the Middle East.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;In contrast to the epic feuds between George W. Bush&#39;s Pentagon and the State Department over Iraq, or the vicious infighting in Donald Trump&#39;s turnover-ridden national-security team, the Biden White House&#39;s approach to the war has been notably drama-free. Disagreements among advisers, while at times robust and protracted, have barely surfaced in the press. Blinken, a confidant of Biden for more than two decades, has been perhaps the most visible salesman for the Administration&#39;s strategy and a key conduit to European allies. Lloyd Austin, the congenial and low-profile Secretary of Defense, has overseen the military relationship with Kyiv. Sullivan is more of an inside player, the relentless wonk at Biden&#39;s side. In an interview, Blinken called him “the hub,” an “honest broker” who has refereed the team&#39;s differences, which the Secretary acknowledged to me but described as largely “tactical, rarely fundamental in nature.” The fact that they have “a friendship, partnership, and real complicity in working together for many years,” he added, has also made for an unusually consensus-minded group.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;At the same time, the Administration&#39;s policy hasn&#39;t always been clear. “A pledge to support Ukraine &#39;for as long as it takes&#39; is not a strategy,” the top Republicans on the House and Senate foreign-affairs committees wrote in a letter this month to the White House. A major complaint from Ukraine supporters in both parties is that the White House delayed too long in providing urgently needed weapons. The term “self-deterrence” is popular among those who subscribe to this view. So is “incrementalism.” John Herbst, a former US Ambassador to Ukraine, called it “world-class ad-hoc-ery.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In some sense, the President&#39;s instructions have been clear from the beginning: No US boots on the ground; no supplying weapons for the purpose of attacking Russian territory; and avoid giving Putin grounds for nuclear escalation. In practice, however, it&#39;s fallen to Sullivan and Biden&#39;s other advisers to oversee a series of one-off decisions about which weapons systems to provide to keep Ukraine in the fight. “I don&#39;t necessarily think that they went in thinking, Oh, we&#39;re going to boil this frog slowly, because that&#39;s the best way to avoid escalation,” Andrea Kendall-Taylor, a former national-intelligence officer who worked on the Biden transition team for the NSC, said. “They stumbled into it.”&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot;

Kennan, the Kremlinologist and the architect of containment. Sullivan, in his early thirties, was already a Washington prodigy, with a dazzling résumé and a reputation as a Midwestern nice guy. When Biden named him national-security adviser, he called him a “once-in-a-generation intellect.” Clinton has referred to him as a “once-in-a-generation talent.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Sullivan grew up in a large Irish Catholic family in Minneapolis, one of five children of a high-school guidance counsellor and a college journalism professor who once studied to become a Jesuit priest. At Yale, Sullivan was the editor-in-chief of the &lt;em>;Yale Daily News&lt;/em>; and a nationally ranked college debater; once a week, he commuted to New York to intern at the Council on Foreign Relations. During his senior year, he scored a rare trifecta—“the academic equivalent of horse racing&#39;s Triple Crown,” as the &lt;em>;Yale Bulletin&lt;/em>; put it—winning all three of the most prestigious fellowships available to American undergraduates: the Rhodes, the Marshall, and the Truman. Sullivan opted for the Rhodes, earned a master&#39;s in international relations at Oxford, and took time out to compete in the world collegiate debate championships in Sydney, finishing second. He then went to Yale Law School and, after graduating, secured a Supreme Court clerkship with Justice Stephen Breyer.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;t5yf66&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Sullivan began his political career as an aide to another bright Minnesotan with a Yale degree: the Democratic senator Amy Klobuchar, who connected him with Clinton to run debate prep for her 2008 primary against Barack Obama. Sullivan quickly proved indispensable to the former First Lady, and, when Clinton became Obama&#39;s Secretary of State, Sullivan went with her. “Jake did everything for her,” one of Obama&#39;s senior aides told the authors Jonathan Allen and Amie Parnes. “Whatever was the front-burner issue of the day, you could go to Jake.” Eventually, Clinton and Sullivan travelled to a hundred and twelve countries.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Biden and his national-security team have often been portrayed, with some justification, as a sort of second coming of the Obama Administration, a reunion of the old gang, albeit with younger aides, such as Blinken and Sullivan, moving into principal positions. When Sullivan got married, in 2015, to Maggie Goodlander, who would go on to serve as counsel to Attorney General Merrick Garland, attendees at the wedding, which was held on Yale&#39;s campus, included not only Clinton, who read a Bible verse in the ceremony, but also Blinken and William Burns, Biden&#39;s future CIA director. (During Obama&#39;s Presidency, Sullivan and Burns, at that time the Deputy Secretary of State, were secretly dispatched to Oman to begin talks with Iran, which ultimately produced the Iran nuclear deal.) Tom Sullivan, the groom&#39;s younger brother, is now Blinken&#39;s deputy chief of staff.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Many of the figures who are ascendant in the Biden Administration—including Biden himself—had also been occasional critics of Obama&#39;s policy toward Russia. In 2009, when Obama sought to repair relations with Russia despite its recent invasion of Georgia, Clinton gamely handed Russia&#39;s Foreign Minister, Sergey Lavrov, an oversized “reset” button—incorrectly translated into Russian, as it turned out—to symbolize the new policy. But internally she was skeptical. When she left the Obama Administration, in 2013, one of her last acts was to submit a harshly worded memo warning the President about Putin. “Don&#39;t appear too eager to work together,” she told Obama, according to her memoir. “Don&#39;t flatter Putin with high-level attention. Decline his invitation for a presidential-level summit.” The first draft of the memo was written by Sullivan. “It was significantly darker” than the final product, he told me—so much so that “some of the Russia hands in the State Department” had said, “That&#39;s over the top, that&#39;s too far.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;After Clinton&#39;s departure, Sullivan succeeded Blinken as Biden&#39;s Vice-Presidential national-security adviser. The following year, Putin launched a surprise takeover of the Crimean Peninsula and backed a separatist war in eastern Ukraine. In response, Biden and others in the White House urged Obama to provide lethal assistance to Kyiv, such as Javelin antitank weapons, but Obama refused. Blinken and Sullivan disagreed with the decision. “Biden was generally the one that was much more forward-leaning in wanting to take more steps,” one of their NSC colleagues at the time recalled. The same was true of his advisers—“the people,” as the colleague put it, “who are now in the driver&#39;s seat.” Another colleague from the Obama years added, “These are the people from the Obama Administration who thought there were real mistakes.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Sullivan left the White House to serve as the chief policy adviser for Clinton&#39;s 2016 campaign. The morning after her loss, when Clinton stoically spoke of the need to accept Trump&#39;s win—in a speech that Sullivan had stayed up all night writing—he sat in the front row and cried. “There&#39;s nothing I don&#39;t second-guess about 2016,” he told me.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The experience convinced Sullivan that liberal internationalists like himself were an endangered species unless they could reorient their thinking. During the Trump years, he launched a think-tank project with the self-appointed mission of developing a “foreign policy for the middle class.” He emerged notably more skeptical about the benefits of unfettered globalization and free trade, a new position that he stressed as Biden&#39;s top policy adviser during the 2020 campaign.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Biden won the 2020 election not wanting to talk so much about Russia. America&#39;s growing rivalry with China, Blinken said, in an early speech as Secretary of State, now looked to be “the biggest geopolitical test” that the US would face this century. As for Russia, another reset was impossible after Putin&#39;s meddling in the 2016 Presidential election and four years of Trump&#39;s open sycophancy. Instead, Biden&#39;s team settled on a new formula, pinning their hopes on a “stable and predictable” relationship. The word “guardrails” came up often in their planning, according to a former official who was involved in the talks.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In the spring of 2021, when Russia began an ominous military buildup along its border with Ukraine, Biden invited Putin to meet in Geneva. But, by the time of the summit, in June, the threat to Ukraine seemed to have ebbed and Biden focussed on warning Putin against launching further cyberattacks on the US After the meeting, Biden insisted that there was a “genuine prospect” for better relations.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;By then, a more pressing problem was unfolding. In April, Biden had announced the end of the two-decade-long US military presence in Afghanistan, setting a September deadline for all remaining US troops to exit the country. In August, however, the US-backed government in Kabul collapsed. The Biden Administration, believing that such a possibility was months away, had failed to evacuate Afghans who had assisted the US during the conflict. Thousands descended upon the Kabul airport, where the US military organized an emergency airlift. The operation ultimately rescued some hundred and twenty-five thousand people, but only after horrific scenes of chaos and a terrorist attack at the airport&#39;s Abbey Gate, in which thirteen US service members and at least a hundred and seventy Afghans died.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Sullivan came under criticism for the botched withdrawal, with some people calling for him to be fired. Brett Bruen, the director of global engagement for the Obama White House, argued in an op-ed that Sullivan and others were responsible for “the most unnecessarily embarrassing day in the history of the National Security Council.” Sullivan kept his job, but colleagues told me that he had taken this “trial by fire,” as one put it, deeply personally. An after-action report by the State Department chided the Administration for succumbing to groupthink and for its failure to plan adequately for “worst-case scenarios.” “This definitely weighed on Jake very heavily,” Ron Klain, Biden&#39;s first White House chief of staff, told the author Chris Whipple. “Did he give the right advice? Did he push back on the military enough?”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The first secret US intelligence reports about Russia&#39;s plans to invade Ukraine came only a few weeks after the withdrawal from Afghanistan, in early October, 2021. A month later, in a speech to an Australian think tank, Sullivan again spoke about “striving for a more stable, more predictable relationship” with Russia.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;In fact, the stable-and-predictable policy was already dead. A week before the speech, Biden had dispatched Burns, his CIA director, on a secret mission to Moscow. Burns notified the Kremlin that the United States was aware of its intentions and warned of serious consequences if Putin followed through. He returned to Washington convinced that the invasion was going to happen.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Biden&#39;s NSC team was haunted by both the recent catastrophe in Afghanistan and the recollection of Putin&#39;s 2014 takeover of Crimea. “In Crimea, [Russia] created a &lt;em>;fait accompli&lt;/em>; before the world had really fully woken up to what they had done,” Sullivan recalled, in an oral history for Politico. “We wanted to make sure the world was wide awake.” He compared the situation to a scene from the first “Austin Powers” movie, in which “there&#39;s a steamroller on the far side of the room, and a guy standing there, holding up his hand, and shouting, &#39;No!&#39; Then they zoom out, and the steamroller is moving incredibly slowly and is really far away.” He added, “I was determined that we were not going to be that guy—just waiting for the steamroller to roll over Ukraine. We were going to act.”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;u70hd4&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Prewar estimates suggested that Ukraine&#39;s military could hold out against the Russians for no more than a few days. A “tiger team” assembled by Sullivan and his deputy national-security adviser, Jon Finer, met to game out possibilities. “A lot of our planning was worst-case scenario planning,” Sullivan told Politico, “which always psychologically puts one in a tough space.”&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot;

The White House was suddenly improvising a strategy for a long war. But Putin&#39;s increasingly explicit nuclear sabre-rattling meant that the early months of the conflict were spent in arguments over what might or might not cross Russia&#39;s red line. In the spring of 2022, a debate raged in Washington over whether to give Ukraine the precision medium-range missile system known as &lt;em >;HIMARS&lt;/em>;. When Nancy Pelosi, the House Speaker, led a congressional delegation to Kyiv to meet with Zelensky, the Ukrainian President&#39;s “main ask” was for the &lt;em >;HIMARS&lt;/em>;, according to Jason Crow, a House Democrat and a military veteran. Eventually, Biden approved the delivery, with the proviso that the &lt;em >;HIMARS&lt;/em>; not be used to hit targets inside Russia. “I felt like we dragged our feet,” a Democratic senator told me. Ukraine, meanwhile, moved on to the next items on its list. Arguments ensued over tanks, F-16 fighter jets, and longer-range missiles known as &lt;em >;ATACMS&lt;/em>;.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Sullivan, characteristically, knew every side of each issue. “Jake&#39;s a master debater,” one of his former NSC colleagues said. “He constantly wants to test his own propositions.” Advocates of talks with Russia have had an open line to Sullivan and his staff, as have former officials who believe that such talks are akin to selling out Ukraine. “One of the things I genuinely admire about Jake is his willingness to take criticism and input, his willingness to double-check and to ask,” Senator Chris Coons, a Biden confidant from Delaware and a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, told me.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Even officials in the Administration who have, at times, been frustrated with Sullivan told me that they appreciated his openness. “He&#39;s a really good listener, and it can be a strength,” a senior official said. “He wants a real debate, and he fosters that. But the weakness of that is that sometimes he can blow in the wind, and you just get these shocks to the system, like, &#39;Wait, what? We&#39;re doing what now?&#39; ”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Sullivan also studiously avoids any daylight between himself and Biden. “He is very careful not to contradict him,” a former official who worked with Sullivan during the Obama Administration said. “He can guide him, but he can&#39;t contradict him. That&#39;s what a national-security adviser has to do, and Jake has always been very conscious, like frankly any good Washington staffer, of never getting afoul of his principal, and he never does.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Sullivan&#39;s methodical, hyperanalytical style fits with Biden&#39;s career-long tendency to hold on to a decision, to wait and test the angles and find a way to the political center of gravity. But the downside of that approach is evident, too. “There&#39;s a real tendency to paralysis by analysis,” Eric Edelman, a former Under-Secretary of Defense in the Bush Administration, said. “Jake likes to look at every facet of a problem and wants to understand everything. That&#39;s the tragedy of government—you have to make decisions behind a veil of irreducible ignorance.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;By February of this year, it was clear that the war would not be ending anytime soon. Biden decided to travel to Kyiv, in a risky and secret trip, to commemorate the first anniversary of the invasion. During an overnight train ride from the Polish border town of Przemyśl to the Ukrainian capital, Biden and Sullivan sat alone together in a wood-panelled car, with the curtains drawn for security, working on the contours of a longer-term strategy to discuss with Zelensky. Since the previous fall, when Ukraine took back key cities such as Kherson and Kharkiv, the question was not so much whether the Administration had failed to anticipate disaster, as in Afghanistan, but what more it could do to make winning possible. Biden and Sullivan were focussed on two converging challenges—how best to supply Ukraine for a planned spring counter-offensive and how to prepare for the &lt;em >;NATO&lt;/em>; summit in July, in Vilnius, Lithuania, where Zelensky would push for a definitive answer to when Ukraine would be allowed to join the alliance.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Biden was immovable in his opposition to granting &lt;em >;NATO&lt;/em>; membership to Ukraine while the war was ongoing. But, during the ten-hour trip into the war zone, he and Sullivan discussed what they planned to offer Zelensky instead: long-term security guarantees and military assistance akin to what the US has provided to Israel since the nineteen-eighties. Sullivan told me, “We had a long conversation about this in which the President said he wanted to use the meeting in Kyiv to lay out for Zelensky his view that there is a pathway to &lt;em >;NATO&lt;/em>;—it&#39;s not for now, it&#39;s for later—and the bridge to &lt;em >;NATO&lt;/em>; is the Israel model.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;The idea had been germinating in the NSC since mid-January. The arrangement with Israel has been codified and sustained going back to the Reagan Administration by a series of formal memorandums of understanding, which commit the US to providing a certain amount of military aid and weapons over a ten-year period in order to give Israel a “qualitative military edge” in the region. Unlike &lt;em >;NATO&lt;/em>;&#39;s Article 5 commitment, which states that an attack on any one member is an attack on all, there has been no explicit pledge obliging the US to fight on Israel&#39;s behalf if it is attacked.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Such an arrangement would nevertheless send a message to Putin—and to everybody else—that the United States would not abandon Ukraine. The next morning, in a meeting with Zelensky, Biden proposed the “Israel model” for the first time. Later, when he and the Ukrainian President met with the press, Biden framed the trip as a rebuke to Putin. “Putin thought Ukraine was weak and the West was divided,” Biden said. “He thought he could outlast us. I don&#39;t think he&#39;s thinking that right now.” Then he and Zelensky took a stroll through Kyiv, as air-raid sirens blared.&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot;

In May, when Biden travelled to a G-7 summit in Japan, Sullivan pitched Yermak and other national-security advisers on a joint statement of principles outlining a long-term security commitment to Ukraine. The idea was that each country, including the US, would then negotiate its own bilateral memorandum of understanding with Ukraine. (Blinken told me that the US ultimately enlisted twenty-eight other countries.) “We negotiated the hell out of that document,” a senior Administration official said. The White House and some allies, such as Germany, wanted to insure that the statement came from the G-7, and not &lt;em >;NATO&lt;/em>;, “because &lt;em >;NATO&lt;/em>;, we continue to feel, should be kept out of this conflict,” a senior European official told me.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Zelensky, however, continued to lobby for full &lt;em >;NATO&lt;/em>; membership. Otherwise, he believed, even if Ukraine won the war it would exist in a security gray zone, vulnerable to future attack by Russia. A number of &lt;em >;NATO&lt;/em>; allies, especially among the former Soviet-bloc countries, agreed. “The bigger issue is he wanted to make clear throughout that this was not one hundred per cent a substitute for &lt;em >;NATO&lt;/em>;,” the senior Administration official recalled. “Zelensky didn&#39;t want to be told, &#39;That&#39;s it, the door is now closed on you. You&#39;re down an entirely different path and you can never get back on this other path.&#39; ”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Inside the Administration, there was disagreement about how to handle this brewing problem. Some State Department officials prodded the White House to offer more to Ukraine. During a &lt;em >;NATO&lt;/em>; meeting of foreign ministers in early June, in Oslo, Blinken called Biden and Sullivan with the message that the US, along with Germany, risked being perceived as an isolated holdout. “The strong majority felt that it was important that the summit take steps forward on advancing the proposition of Ukraine&#39;s membership and that we could not simply sit on the status quo,” Blinken told me. “And so I reported that back.” &lt;em >;NATO&lt;/em>;&#39;s Secretary-General, Jens Stoltenberg, floated a proposal for what the alliance might offer Ukraine: not yet membership, but a faster track to getting there, in which Ukraine would not be required to first fulfill an elaborate Membership Action Plan, a condition that &lt;em >;NATO&lt;/em>; had imposed on other former Soviet states. When Stoltenberg came to Washington in mid-June, Biden reluctantly agreed to skip the &lt;em >;MAP&lt;/em>;.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;xfl8ji&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Privately, the Ukrainians were hardly thrilled with the proposal. Zelensky was still holding out hope for a concrete commitment to let Ukraine join &lt;em >;NATO&lt;/em>;. A senior diplomatic source told me that the Americans were disappointed by Ukraine&#39;s reaction to the lifting of the &lt;em >;MAP&lt;/em>;: “Like, &#39;What, you don&#39;t see that as a win?&#39; It was so frustrating.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Ukraine&#39;s long-awaited spring offensive began, in June, with high expectations. Publicly, the Administration emphasized what the Pentagon called the “mountain of steel” it had sent to bolster the Ukrainian Army. But Russia had built three lines of defense in key places along the front. The fighting would hark back to the awful trench warfare of the First World War. The Ukrainians, in fact, were expending artillery shells at an unheard-of rate. In the White House, Sullivan and others worried that a shortage would stall the counter-offensive before it could succeed.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Sullivan had warned about this scenario for months. In January, the Ukrainians had worked with the Pentagon on an extensive war game in Wiesbaden to assess their needs. The conclusion was not good: the counter-offensive would require more 155-millimetre rounds than the Pentagon had to offer. By February, Sullivan began to speak of this as the war&#39;s “math problem.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;As Sullivan saw it, there were three potential solutions: dramatically ramp up production; look for additional sources of ammunition around the world; or send Ukraine some of the large stocks of phased-out cluster munitions held in storage by the Pentagon. But the White House learned that it would take months to sufficiently increase production of artillery shells—too late for the counter-offensive. And the State Department was opposed to sending cluster munitions, known as &lt;em >;DPICM&lt;/em>;s, which are outlawed by more than a hundred countries, including many US allies in Europe, because of the civilian casualties they often leave in their wake. That left the hunt for more munitions. Austin and Sullivan began calling leaders across the globe, including in countries, such as South Korea and Israel, that had not been particularly supportive of the war effort. “The decision was made to make a real run at the South Koreans, because they were the allies that had the biggest stockpile,” a senior Pentagon official recalled. Leaked documents revealed that the NSC proposed various creative ways of getting around South Korea&#39;s prohibition on directly selling arms to fuel the conflict; one of these involved having Poland or the US buy the munitions and then send them on to Ukraine.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;But by early summer a secret report from the Pentagon warned that Ukraine risked running out of ammunition sooner than expected and again recommended sending cluster munitions. “We&#39;d reached the end of the road,” the senior Administration official recalled. “Like, if we want to make sure there is not a significant disruption in supply, we have to make this decision right now.” The State Department finally lifted its objections—it was a “very stark choice,” Blinken told me, and the Pentagon&#39;s dire warning was “dispositive”—and the NSC convened a meeting to ratify the decision. “They had to go back to the President and say, Option A is the Ukrainians run out of ammo and the counter-offensive stops, or Option B is you provide &lt;em >;DPICM&lt;/em>;s,” the senior Pentagon official said. In early July, Biden announced the move, which he called “difficult.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In an interview that same day, I asked Sullivan about the Administration&#39;s cycle of “no-no-no-yes” decisions on sending various kinds of military assistance to Ukraine. By this point, even some inside the Administration found the pattern hard to understand. “It&#39;s like the boy who cried wolf,” a senior official had told me. “I just don&#39;t know what to believe anymore. When they say, &#39;No way, we would never look at the &lt;em >;ATACMS&lt;/em>;,&#39; I say, &#39;Is that true?&#39; I do feel I just keep seeing the same movie over and over again.”&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot;

I see the through line you guys are all drawing on the no-no-no-yes thing, but actually each of these has their own distinct logic to them.” To him, the Abrams-tank decision was “about sustaining unity” with Germany. Sometimes the State Department objected, as in the case of the cluster munitions. Sometimes it was the Pentagon or the President personally, as with the &lt;em >;ATACMS&lt;/em>;.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The &lt;em >;ATACMs&lt;/em>; had become a particular sore point. In 2022, Biden had rejected sending them, arguing that, to Putin, they would constitute an unacceptable escalation, since their range, up to a hundred and ninety miles, meant that they could hit targets inside Russia. “Another key goal is to insure that we do not end up in a circumstance where we are heading down the road towards a Third World War,” Sullivan said that summer. But once the British began providing similar missiles, in the spring of 2023, the argument no longer seemed to apply. “What has held us back,” the senior Pentagon official told me this summer, was that doing so would “deplete our stocks at a time when we require those missiles for our own contingencies, whether that be Iran or North Korea or China.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Members of Congress in both parties objected to that reasoning. In June, the House Foreign Affairs Committee passed a bipartisan resolution saying that &lt;em >;ATACMS&lt;/em>; should “immediately” be offered. When officials had told Crow, the Democratic congressman, that sending the &lt;em >;ATACMS&lt;/em>; would affect the Pentagon&#39;s Operations Plan, his response, he said, was “Well, for what future war? The war in Europe is now, and it is being fought by the Ukrainians. So change the goddam &lt;em >;OPLAN&lt;/em>;.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;More broadly, some of Ukraine&#39;s supporters feared that the protracted deliberations had negatively affected the counter-offensive, which, by midsummer, had failed to produce the hoped-for breaches in the Russian lines. “Think about where we might be if things like &lt;em >;HIMARS&lt;/em>;, Stingers, F-16s, &lt;em >;ATACMs&lt;/em>; were over there a year ago,” Dan Sullivan, a senior Republican senator on the Armed Services Committee, told me. “That&#39;s the really big flaw in the execution of their strategy, and it does start to undermine support when people don&#39;t think they&#39;re in it to win it.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;For his part, the national-security adviser seemed to chafe at the view, circulating widely in Washington, that he was the holdup and that others, including Blinken, were more “forward-leaning.” In recent months, Sullivan had taken to saying that, despite all the attention paid to high-tech weapons and fighter jets, there were only two things that Ukraine could not do without: artillery and air defense. This, he said, was why he had been among the loudest voices pushing to approve the cluster munitions, which, he told colleagues, were the most important single assistance the US could give. “He&#39;s frustrated with this perception that he&#39;s the problem,” a former senior US official told me. “It&#39;s completely wrong.”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;0xzpjg&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Blinken told me that the criticism stemmed from a misunderstanding of Sullivan&#39;s role. “I&#39;ve been forward-leaning in advocating to get the Ukrainians different things at different times, but it&#39;s imperative that that be part of a rigorous process,” the Secretary said. “It&#39;s never been, at all, Jake is a brake on this—it&#39;s Jake doing the job the way it&#39;s supposed to be done.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;The former official said that, by December of 2022, Sullivan was trying to get the President to use the threat of sending &lt;em >;atacms&lt;/em>; as leverage with the Russians. “He was pushing Biden: Why don&#39;t we at least say we will send &lt;em >;ATACMS&lt;/em>; unless you stop firing on cities?” the former official told me. “So he&#39;s been making that argument for at least six months now, and the President was not willing to do it. At some point, the President is the President.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Another former senior US official recalled a conversation with Sullivan about whether the US would agree to send F-16s to Ukraine. Sullivan indicated that he was supportive. But, in early 2023, Biden publicly ruled out doing so, at least in the short term. Months later, several European allies agreed, with Biden&#39;s approval, to supply F-16s to Ukraine. It wasn&#39;t until the summer, however, that the US signed off on a plan to train Ukrainian pilots on the fighter jets. The former official told me he had concluded, “The biggest drag on the speed of responding to Ukrainian requests has been the President, not Lloyd Austin, not Tony, not Jake—not the Administration, but the President. Jake is trying to play the role of honest broker, because he&#39;s with the President every day.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Martin Indyk, who served as Obama&#39;s chief Mideast peace negotiator, argued that Biden&#39;s equivocation had real consequences. “They made a big mistake,” he told me. “They self-deterred. That affected every move—that cautious incrementalism which we can now see with the benefit of hindsight was unnecessary.” Indyk, who wrote a book about Henry Kissinger&#39;s Mideast diplomacy, recalled a key moment in the Yom Kippur War, in 1973, when Kissinger, the national-security adviser, was hesitating to send more than three C-5a transport aircraft to Israel. “Nixon famously said, &#39;You know, Henry, we&#39;re going to get blamed and criticized if we send thirty or if we send three,&#39; ” Indyk told me. “So he said, &#39;Send everything that flies. And get on with it.&#39; ” The problem today is that Biden has been more Kissinger than Nixon, Indyk said: “We need him to tell Jake, &#39;Send everything that flies, goddammit, and get on with it.&#39; I think it would have changed the course of the war.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;em >;NATO&lt;/em>; summits are usually staid affairs, with almost everything haggled over and approved in advance. But two things happened in the weeks leading up to the Vilnius summit which disrupted hopes for a smooth rollout. First, in late June, came explosive news from inside Russia: Putin&#39;s mercenary Yevgeny Prigozhin had launched a mutiny. Sullivan cancelled a trip to Denmark to monitor the situation from Washington; he and Biden had just helicoptered to Camp David and arrived at their cabins when word came that Prigozhin had been persuaded to stand down.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Then, a few days later, a phone call between Biden and the German Chancellor, Olaf Scholz, threatened to derail negotiations over the summit&#39;s final communiqué, which would show where &lt;em >;NATO&lt;/em>; stood on the divisive matter of Ukraine&#39;s quest for membership. Scholz, according to four sources with whom I spoke, made clear that he was adamantly opposed to a statement that included a specific “invitation” for Ukraine to join &lt;em >;NATO&lt;/em>;. He also told Biden that he was skeptical of letting Ukraine out of the Membership Action Plan requirement. On that point, Biden refused—he had already agreed to it.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Biden, who prizes his closeness to Scholz—the senior European official described the “extremely warm, brothers-in-arms feeling” between them—agreed to present a joint front with the Germans on the idea of extending a formal invitation to Ukraine. As Scholz saw it, lifting the &lt;em >;MAP&lt;/em>; would be a significant enough show of progress for Ukraine. The senior Administration official recalled, “Biden basically said to Scholz, &#39;Look, I will make sure that, as we go through these negotiations, we aren&#39;t on a kind of a pure slippery slope.&#39; ”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The issue had still not been resolved by the weekend before the summit. That Monday, Sullivan and Blinken signed off on a compromise—an awkward, American-drafted sentence offering an unspecified future “invitation” but nothing to explain how or when Ukraine could obtain it. Another breakthrough came that night, when Turkey&#39;s leader, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, agreed to drop his objections to Sweden&#39;s &lt;em >;NATO&lt;/em>; membership, which he had been stalling almost single-handedly for more than a year.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;But on the morning of Tuesday, July 11th, when leaders were to formally gather in Vilnius, Sullivan sensed trouble during a phone call with Yermak, the Ukrainian chief of staff. Sullivan turned beet red as Yermak told him that the hard-fought language in the communiqué was not enough. After Yermak informed Sullivan that he and Zelensky would soon land in Vilnius and hoped to negotiate final wording, Sullivan responded sharply: this was &lt;em >;NATO&lt;/em>;&#39;s communiqué, he said, not Ukraine&#39;s.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Things soon got worse. Zelensky sent out a tweet blasting the draft for placing “unprecedented and absurd” conditions on Ukraine. He also suggested that the allies were holding out to use Ukraine&#39;s &lt;em >;NATO&lt;/em>; status as a bargaining chip in future negotiations with Russia. Sullivan, who was stunned by the tone of the tweet, left a meeting that Biden was holding with a bipartisan group of senators to call Yermak again. “We literally did this sentence to make them happy,” a senior US official recalled of the moment. Maybe, Sullivan said to Biden, they should remove or replace the carefully negotiated wording. What was the point if the Ukrainians didn&#39;t like it? “I was, like, this whole summit&#39;s going to come crashing down,” the senior diplomatic source said. “I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever seen Jake that angry.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;By that evening, after hours of talks, both Biden and Emmanuel Macron, the French President, among others, objected to making any revisions, and the statement was finalized exactly as it had been before the hours of embarrassingly public discord. For a summit meant to project “unity and zeal” on Ukraine&#39;s behalf, as Sullivan had put it days earlier, it was a mess. The senior European official said the dustup was consistent with the “track record of President Zelensky asking for things which he knows he cannot get,” thus “creating his own disappointment.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The Americans, the senior Administration official told me, went back to the Ukrainians with one last pitch: “Guys, the play&#39;s the same, and it&#39;s a good one for you,” with a promise of &lt;em >;NATO&lt;/em>; membership in the future and bilateral security commitments in the meantime. Zelensky got the message. The next day, he appeared alongside Biden and praised the summit as a “success” for Ukraine.

event. Daria Kaleniuk, one of Ukraine&#39;s best-known anti-corruption activists, rose to ask him a question. Wearing a dusty-pink blazer over a black T-shirt emblazoned with the slogan “#Ukraine &lt;em >;NATO&lt;/em>; now,” she confronted Sullivan in starkly personal terms. She had left her eleven-year-old son behind in Kyiv, “sleeping in the corridor because of the air raids,” she said. “Jake, please advise me, what should I tell my son?” Was Biden refusing to allow Ukraine to join &lt;em >;NATO&lt;/em>; “because he is afraid of Russia”? Or because he was engaged in “back-channel communications with the Kremlin,” preparing to sell out Ukraine to Putin?&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;8f2wjc&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Sullivan, looking exhausted, began by talking about the “bravery and courage” of the Ukrainians and how the United States would be there for them “as long as it takes.” But his tone sharpened as he responded to Kaleniuk&#39;s speculation about Biden&#39;s motives, which he called “unfounded and unjustified” and “a lot of conspiracy theorizing that simply is not based on any reality whatsoever.” What&#39;s more, he added, “I think the American people do deserve a degree of gratitude” for their support of Ukraine.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;An audience member told me that there were audible gasps in the room—you don&#39;t tell a mother who&#39;s left her child sheltering from Russian bombs to express more gratitude. Hours later, Sullivan ran into Oleksiy Goncharenko, a member of Ukraine&#39;s parliament, and heatedly complained about the “unfair and unfounded” question.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Kaleniuk, for her part, had no regrets. Sullivan had been described to her as the most important Biden adviser on the war—and also as a “very, very cautious” brake on the advanced weapons, assistance, and &lt;em >;NATO&lt;/em>; membership that Ukraine needed. “It&#39;s just important for Jake to understand it&#39;s not the craziest thing, that actually there are thousands of Ukrainians who have the same perception of how America treats us,” she told me when I reached her in Kyiv. Her biggest fear, she added, was that Washington, despite its support, has no plan for how to insure that Ukraine wins. The &lt;em >;NATO&lt;/em>; summit had only reinforced this concern. “The White House doesn&#39;t have a clear end-game scenario and end-game strategy for this war,” she said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Early on, the Biden team had settled on a response to the inevitable question of how and when there might be a negotiated end to the war: “Nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine.” There would be no separate deal with Russia, they promised. But many Ukrainians, like Kaleniuk, continue to worry that that is exactly where things will end up, with the two nuclear superpowers at the table, settling their country&#39;s fate once again.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Shortly before the Vilnius summit, NBC News reported that Lavrov, the Russian Foreign Minister, had held a secret meeting in New York with former US officials, including Richard Haass, president emeritus of the Council on Foreign Relations. At the time, Sullivan and the Americans were trying to ease Ukraine&#39;s disappointment about &lt;em >;NATO&lt;/em>; membership, and they denied having anything to do with the meeting or with any other secret negotiations with Russia.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Still, a former US official who has met with the Russians during the war told me that the NSC was “fully briefed” both before and after the conversation. I was also told, in June, of an intermediary who was going to the White House with a message from the Kremlin. “The White House wants to see these people,” a former official who has participated in unofficial discussions with the Russians told me. “They want to understand what the Russians are thinking.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;There is little doubt that the Biden Administration has actively considered ways to get Russia to the negotiating table. Last fall, Mark Milley, then the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, publicly expressed his view that the war would likely not be ended on the battlefield. Privately, Sullivan has had extensive discussions about what a peace deal might look like. “My conversations with him all the way through have been about what can you do to eventually bring this war to an end,” an informal adviser of Sullivan&#39;s told me. “There are massive risks that are attendant with continuing to fight a hot war via proxy with the Russians. And the risks aren&#39;t going down. They&#39;re probably going up. So they want to find a way to eventually get to a freeze, to eventually get to a negotiated settlement. But it has to be something that keeps &lt;em >;NATO&lt;/em>; together. It has to be something that doesn&#39;t isolate the Ukrainians or have them go off and undermine everything that&#39;s been done. That&#39;s a hard square to circle.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Talks, if they do occur, are likely to raise tensions further between the US and Ukraine. “The Administration&#39;s policy up to now has been close to unconditional support for Ukraine and essentially a real reluctance to be seen to be at cross-purposes with Ukraine,” Haass told me. “But that policy endures only if there is identity of interests between the United States and Ukraine, and if that were to be the case that would be without historical precedent. If you look at the history—whether the US with South Vietnam, or the US with Israel, or the US with Britain and France during Suez—history is about how you manage disagreement with your allies.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In September, shortly before Zelensky made his second visit to Washington since the invasion, Biden approved sending &lt;em >;ATACMS&lt;/em>; to Ukraine, after nearly a year of resisting the idea. American officials, meanwhile, have held two rounds of formal negotiations with Ukraine over the terms of a memorandum of understanding—Sullivan&#39;s “Israel model.” With Trump barrelling toward the Republican nomination, however, the political support that had once seemed so strong and bipartisan for Ukraine in Washington has been quickly eroding.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;On September 30th, the House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, facing a rebellion from a group of hard-right Trumpists, stripped Ukraine funding from a resolution to temporarily keep the government open. A few days later, Biden asked European leaders, on a call, “not to read too much into it,” Blinken told me, but, within hours, McCarthy was ousted as Speaker by the anti-Ukraine rebels. Now the fate of Ukraine aid, including a White House request for another twenty-four billion dollars, is entirely up in the air. Zelensky, during his recent visit, warned members of the US Senate about the consequences of a cutoff: “If we don&#39;t get the aid, we will lose the war.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Sullivan clearly has profound worries about how this will all play out. Months into the counter-offensive, Ukraine has yet to reclaim much more of its territory; the Administration has been telling members of Congress that the conflict could last three to five years. A grinding war of attrition would be a disaster for both Ukraine and its allies, but a negotiated settlement does not seem possible as long as Putin remains in power. Putin, of course, has every incentive to keep fighting through next year&#39;s US election, with its possibility of a Trump return. And it&#39;s hard to imagine Zelensky going for a deal with Putin, either, given all that Ukraine has sacrificed. Even a Ukrainian victory would present challenges for American foreign policy, since it would “threaten the integrity of the Russian state and the Russian regime and create instability throughout Eurasia,” as one of the former US officials put it to me. Ukraine&#39;s desire to take back occupied Crimea has been a particular concern for Sullivan, who has privately noted the Administration&#39;s assessment that this scenario carries the highest risk of Putin following through on his nuclear threats. In other words, there are few good options.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;khj96&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;“The reason they&#39;ve been so hesitant about escalation is not exactly because they see Russian reprisal as a likely problem,” the former official said. “It&#39;s not like they think, Oh, we&#39;re going to give them &lt;em >;ATACMS&lt;/em>; and then Russia is going to launch an attack against &lt;em >;NATO&lt;/em>;. It&#39;s because they recognize that it&#39;s not going anywhere—that they are fighting a war they can&#39;t afford either to win or lose.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I read this quote to Sullivan during our interview in the Roosevelt Room. “That&#39;s kind of the rap on us,” he acknowledged. “I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a fair one. We&#39;re not fighting for a draw here.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Then he proceeded, once again, to raise and attempt to demolish all the by now familiar arguments. “To be paralyzed by escalation would be terrible, and we have not been paralyzed—we have provided tens of billions of dollars of advanced weapons, intelligence, training, capacity, that has had enormous lethal effect,” he said. “But to be completely cavalier about escalation, to say that to even raise the question makes you a coward, that&#39;s easy to do from the outside, but when you sit in this seat you can&#39;t do that. You have an obligation to the American people to consider worst-case scenarios. That&#39;s our job.” ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 09 Oct 2023 19:06:02 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
