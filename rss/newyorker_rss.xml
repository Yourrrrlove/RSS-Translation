aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>; &lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;以色列的道路几乎和赎罪日一样空旷。唯一可能让你放慢脚步的是警报声，警告说有一枚火箭正从加沙向北飞向特拉维夫和其他城市。这种情况一天发生多次。大家都知道的规定是，你把车停在路边，下车，平躺在路上，捂住头，等几分钟再继续前进。我到乡下还不到三个小时，就在 20 号高速公路的立交桥下等待。高速公路沿线常见的商业标志似乎一夜之间就发生了变化。没有零可乐，就没有丰田。现在，广告牌上高喊着团结的宣言——“团结一致，我们会赢”——并呼吁归还人质。他们的照片到处都是。当天早些时候，美国总统抵达会见以色列总理。总统在传达了热烈支持的信息后，还夹杂着警告，不要被愤怒吞噬，不要犯下美国在 9/11 事件后所犯的灾难性错误。华盛顿。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;前一天晚上，在特拉维夫的一个朋友家吃晚饭时，我收到了莫萨布·阿布·托哈 (Mosab Abu Toha) 发来的一系列 WhatsApp 消息，他是一位 30 岁的诗人，与妻子和孩子住在拜特拉希亚 (Beit Lahia)，位于加沙北部。最近，他一直住在约一英里半外的贾巴利亚难民营的亲戚家中。他出生于加沙城的沙蒂难民营，四年前第一次离开加沙地带。他最终在雪城大学攻读诗歌美术硕士学位。现在，莫萨布用一句话爆料说，位于加沙市南部地区泽图恩的阿赫利阿拉伯医院遭到了以色列战机的轰炸：“上帝保佑我们。”他发送了图像——首先是一座燃烧的建筑物和一名倒在街上的男子，可能已经死亡——然后他转达了死亡人数报告：&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“有 200 到 300 人被杀。”&lt;/p>;&lt; p>;然后：“超过 500 人在医院死亡。”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;然后：“超过 800 人。” &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;然后：“现在有 1,115 人在加沙医院的爆炸中丧生。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;他并没有声称拥有权威或靠近医院，而是在自己的社交媒体上传达了警报网络。随后，莫萨布发来了一张医务人员戴着手套的手中抱着死去婴儿的照片。 “很抱歉发送此信息，”他在标题中补充道，“但这是医院大屠杀中的一名受害者。”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid =&quot;RowWrapper&quot;

data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;很快餐桌上的每个人都收到了推送警报——来自以色列媒体、来自电线、来自 CNN、BBC、&lt;em>;泰晤士报&lt;/em>;。谈话的声调非常高。当我们吃饭时，就像一夜又一夜一样，传来隆隆的回声：来自加沙的火箭弹。人们停下来，听了一会儿，然后继续吃饭。他们清楚地判断，这些火箭不值得前往楼下的加固安全室&lt;em>;mamad&lt;/em>;。是否寻求庇护长期以来一直是一个专业知识和常规问题。后来，一些人离开餐桌，在以色列电视的 12 和 13 频道之间切换。新闻主播现在正在分享以色列政府消息来源的声明，否认以色列在医院附近的任何地方发射了导弹或投掷了炸弹；他们说，事实上，这场灾难的责任在于巴勒斯坦伊斯兰圣战组织，该组织规模比哈马斯小，但好战程度不亚于哈马斯。他们说，这是一次失败的火箭发射。几个小时后，美国情报机构宣布他们的信息与以色列的评估一致。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;当我问莫萨布对这些否认的看法时，他回答说：“没有人相信他们。”他批评拜登总统暗示以色列不负有责任的声明是“不公平的”，并补充说，“好吧，如果是的话呢？” WhatsApp 消息让我的手机一直震动。 “它对过去发生的学校大屠杀负有责任，”莫萨布写道。 “美国政府做了什么回应？”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data -node-id=&quot;tx1467&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper &quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;像每个同龄的加沙人一样，莫萨布经历过无数次空袭。有一天，当他八岁的时候，他出去买晚饭，抬头看到一架阿帕奇直升机冲向一座高层建筑。那是 2000 年第二次起义开始时。从那时起，他失去了朋友和亲人；他失去了家人和朋友。葬礼和瓦砾是他和邻居们生活的常态。当他十六岁的时候，在以色列人所谓的“铸铅行动”中，他的头部、颈部和肩膀在一次爆炸中被弹片击中。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;莫萨布不愿意听从情报。正如以色列官员倾向于接受有关封锁加沙和占领西岸的讨论作为南部大屠杀的“背景”一样。当然，有事实——其中许多是未知的——但叙述是第一位的，所有这些都充满了历史和反历史、不满和五十种愤怒，所有这些都以社交媒体的速度涌入。人们会相信他们需要相信的事情。因此，虽然以色列人和他们的盟友因伊斯兰圣战组织灾难性失火的情报报告而松了一口气，但巴勒斯坦人和大多数阿拉伯世界却没有感受到这一点。葬礼继续进行。以色列对加沙的轰炸愈演愈烈，造成数千人死亡，医院濒临倒塌，基础设施摇摇欲坠。以色列地面进攻的动员也是如此。以色列和真主党在以色列与黎巴嫩边境发生小规模冲突，伊朗阿亚图拉的威胁，美国军舰在东地中海的威胁。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;出租车把我送到拉马特阿维夫的以色列国防军大院。警卫亭里的一名士兵推开一个装有外卖通心粉的铝制容器，检查了我的护照，然后带我上了二楼。我走进一间宽敞的开放式房间，里面挤满了年轻军官和年轻士兵，他们聚精会神地用手机和笔记本电脑工作，向世界各地的媒体传达以色列的立场。一周以来，他们的首要任务是确保每个人都了解奥特夫·阿扎的暴行。现在的任务是公布有关医院爆炸事件的情报，同样重要的是抨击外国媒体，这些媒体早期的推送警报和头条新闻都指责以色列。 “在过去的十天里，我们不断被问及儿童是否被斩首，而不仅仅是被谋杀，”一名预备役军人、前总理亚伊尔·拉皮德的外交顾问亚伊尔·齐万告诉我。 “昨天，这些新闻媒体一刻也不犹豫地报道以色列对医院爆炸事件负有责任。这是从哪里来的？”&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot;

>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;然而谁能阻止另一场愚蠢的行进呢？总理本杰明·内塔尼亚胡一直幻想自己是本国的丘吉尔，并在办公桌旁放置了一幅英国战时领导人的镶框肖像，旁边是现代犹太复国主义创始人西奥多·赫茨尔的肖像。在反对绥靖政策的演讲中，内塔尼亚胡引用了他的英雄的话“人类确实是不可教的”。但丘吉尔尽管有种种缺点，他并没有将一群救世主狂热分子带入内阁；他在受到刑事起诉时并没有领导一个国家；他没有让国家安全容易受到推土机和骑摩托车的武装人员的攻击。&lt;​​/p>;&lt;p>;内塔尼亚胡受到预备役军人的质问和媒体的诽谤。大屠杀六天后，《Ma&#39;ariv》报纸上发表的一项民意调查显示，48% 的以色列人更喜欢本尼·甘茨 (Benny Gantz)，他是一位冷漠的退役陆军将军，也是一位中间派政治家，他被带入了新的政权。团结政府，领导国家；只有百分之二十九的人更喜欢内塔尼亚胡。同一份报纸还报道说，百分之八十的以色列人希望内塔尼亚胡对 10 月 7 日的安全失败承担责任，就像以色列国防军和该国内部安全部门辛贝特领导人所做的那样。内塔尼亚胡无法忍受对其政府的失败表示忏悔或遗憾，甚至无法对死者家属表示同情（许多以色列人指出，拜登能够做到这一点），他不太可能下台或后退。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;哈雷尔-​​费什说这段视频令人震惊。会有大量跟踪、枪击、绑架、烧毁房屋、烧毁尸体、受惊的儿童、死去的儿童、死去的婴儿、残害、欢腾的片段。在观看开始之前，谢夫勒想强调最后一点。他刚刚从美国回来，在哈佛大学肯尼迪政府学院学习。他说，他发现同学们在讨论以色列-巴勒斯坦问题时“愣住了”，不敢了解历史，以免讨论出现偏差。但他继续说道，尽管灰色阴影很重要，但有时“有些东西是黑色的，有些东西是白色的。”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;

data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;谢夫勒告辞离开了房间。哈雷尔-费什关掉了灯。他轻敲笔记本电脑上的一个键，恐怖表演就开始了。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;六天前从肯尼迪机场飞往本古里安机场的夜间航班挤满了人。在以色列航空公司的值机柜台上，即使在正常情况下，安检程序也很复杂，我后面的乘客是一位中年男子，他的手提箱上放着一把似乎是收缩包装的机枪。我不再担心随身携带的牙膏管了。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“你在以色列做什么？”保安人员问道。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;周五，我及时降落在特拉维夫郊外与朋友共进晚餐。那天晚上晚些时候，来自卡法阿扎基布兹的三个孩子的父亲阿维猜·布罗杜奇 (Avichai Brodutch) 试图在特拉维夫南部父母的公寓里睡觉。布罗杜奇今年四十二岁，是一位极其谦虚的人，是一名菠萝种植者，后来转而学习护理。那天晚上，在黑暗的房间里，他盯着天花板。正如他第二天告诉我的那样，他的思绪“天旋地转”。他服用了半片 Klonopin。这对他没有好处。他的妻子夏甲和孩子们——奥弗里、尤瓦尔和乌利亚——在加沙地带成为人质。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;10 月 7 日清晨，哈马斯武装分子涌入卡法阿扎郁郁葱葱的土地。根据以色列国防军找到的文件，他们携带了准确的目标地图和详细的作战计划：“下属部队与保障部队一起前进。 。 。 。他们必须击落尽可能多的受害者，劫持人质，并使用各种汽车将其中一些人带到加沙地带。”经过大约两年的策划，由努赫巴人（Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades 的精锐部队）成员领导的武装分子冲破了加沙周围的边界围栏，其中超过 1500 人迅速冲向基布兹，摩托车、装有机枪的皮卡车。有些人乘坐滑翔伞越过边境围栏。穿过卡法阿扎的黄色大门后，他们挨家挨户地往窗户里看，试探着门。他们的步伐很有条理。为了将人们从安全室中熏出来，他们点燃了备用轮胎。为了防止逃跑，他们烧毁了汽车。然后真正的杀戮开始了。&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot;

>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;现在，在他失眠的情况下，他需要做点什么，任何事情，以确保他的妻子和孩子没有被忘记。他起身，洗了个澡，穿上了捐赠的衣服：短裤、T 恤和洞洞鞋。他带着他的狗罗德尼，一只巧克力棕色的脊背犬，开车前往特拉维夫，在卡普兰街的以色列国防军总部基里亚下车。自一月份以来，每周都有数万名以色列人聚集在这里，抗议内塔尼亚胡政府削弱最高法院权威的计划。三点左右，他坐在一张塑料椅子上，旁边有一个牌子，上面写着“&lt;em>;HaMishpacha Sheli Be&#39;aza&lt;/em>;”：“我的家人在加沙。”布罗杜奇的兄弟从加拿大来访，贴出了一张他的照片并将其发送到他们的 WhatsApp 群组。白天，一小群人聚集在他周围。上午晚些时候，当我到达时，已经有数百人，其中许多人高呼口号，要求内塔尼亚胡辞职。另一个口号是“&lt;em>;Hayom！&lt;/em>;”“今天！”就像“今天把人质带回来”一样。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;哈马斯袭击的受害者——死者、幸存者、被绑架者——不是定居者或狂热分子；他们是被绑架的人。他们基本上是以色列的自由主义者，这个民族仍然谈论（带有警告和细微差别）和平和两国人民的两个国家。他们往往厌恶内塔尼亚胡，因为他的傲慢和腐败、对巴勒斯坦人的蔑视、削弱最高法院的企图，以及他与国家安全部长伊塔马尔·本-格维尔和财政部长贝扎雷尔等可怕的反动派结盟。斯莫特里奇。一些幸存者并不特别关心政治。有些人参加了之前的卡普兰街示威活动。他们加入了像“兄弟连”这样的团体，这些团体是反对内塔尼亚胡的预备役军人。 10 月 7 日之后，他们搁置了对救援工作的抗议。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;布罗杜奇和我坐在长凳上交谈，但每隔几分钟就会有人上来拥抱他，用力拥抱他，因为悲伤和愤怒而颤抖。人们不断给他送衣服、饮料、食物：库格尔、蒸粗麦粉、一堆肉丸。布罗杜奇既感动又尴尬，但即使心怀感激，他也吃不下饭。为了取悦一位访客，他吃了一茶匙石榴籽。他的笑容很羞怯，眼睛里充满了受伤，尽管他无法像他想的那样哭泣。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“我不知道我的心态是什么，”他说。 “有这么多的悲伤，有这么多的爱。”袭击发生前一天晚上，他的大孩子奥弗里在基布兹附近的一家餐馆庆祝了她的十岁生日。 “我们本来打算在周六吃生日蛋糕，”布罗杜奇告诉我。 “它可能还在冰箱里。”&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot;

Brodutch recognized him immediately. On their rampage, Hamas fighters had not only managed to blind the Army&#39;s surveillance systems and break through the forty-mile-long border fence at more than twenty points; they also stormed at least eight military bases and killed dozens of soldiers who might have been able to beat back the onslaught. Buhadana was among the reservists who made it to Kfar Aza that day, first to hunt for remaining terrorists, then to search for survivors. Now he, too, was shaking with emotion. After a while, he wiped the sweat from his head and the tears from his face, and sat down. “If you are speaking by proportion, this is way worse than 9/11,” he said. “The world should know how cruel these people are.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The scene outside the IDF headquarters was an open-air shiva, part of a &lt;em>;national&lt;/em>; shiva. So many well-wishers were descending on Brodutch that he finally asked to take a break, and headed off with his brother. When we met again, a short while later, Brodutch made it clear that he wanted to deliver a message that was out of keeping with the dominant emotions of the day—the hunger for vengeance, the outrage at the failure of the Israeli government to protect its citizens. Brodutch allowed that the state had failed: “This is a colossal disaster that will be investigated in years to come.” But he was painstakingly deliberate in his comments about his family&#39;s kidnappers. His wife and his children were in the hands of Hamas, and Hamas was keenly aware of what was being written and said about the organization abroad, including in Israel. Every time Israel dropped a bomb, he worried that it might kill his family. “I have to hope that there is someone watching over them,” he said. “It was overkill by Hamas. I don&#39;t think they thought things would go that far. At least, I want to believe that. Their religion is peaceful. No religion can be successful for long if it is not peaceful.”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;44agck&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;He was terrified by the prospect of a ground war. “We are going the wrong way,” he said. “We&#39;ve had a sign from God, and if we read it as a sign to go to war that is one thing. We should be sending humanitarian aid to women, children, and the elderly. Hamas believes that women, children, and the elderly should not be attacked, but something on their side went very wrong. I don&#39;t think they thought this attack would be so easy, and they just &lt;em>;lost&lt;/em>; it.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Uriah, his youngest, is four and a half. Brodutch said that he imagined his son would be “causing havoc wherever he is,” and that, maybe for that reason, Hamas would lose patience and let him be the first one released. “I&#39;ve seen military conflict for years and years,” he said, “and it solves nothing.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;On a trip to Gaza during the second intifada, I met one of the founders of Hamas, a former surgeon named Mahmoud al-Zahar. This was 2001, and al-Zahar was fifty-seven. “ &#39;David,&#39; ” he said. “That&#39;s a Jewish name, isn&#39;t it?” Hamas, a radical, religious rival to the Palestine Liberation Organization, was determined to free “the whole of Palestine.” Hamas might consider a two-state solution, but only as a &lt;em>;hudna&lt;/em>;, a ceasefire. The ultimate goal, al-Zahar said, “is to establish an Islamic state in Palestine, in Egypt, in Lebanon, in Saudi Arabia—everywhere under a single caliphate.” Certain conclusions followed from this: “We will not tolerate a non-Islamic state on Islamic lands.”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;GenericCallout&quot;>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;A view of a rocket in the sky.

In those days, many Israelis shopped in Gaza City or went to the beach nearby; tens of thousands of Gazans commuted regularly to jobs inside Israel, a practice that Yassin feared would be corrosive to the moral values of young Muslims. He stressed &lt;em>;da&#39;wa,&lt;/em>; the call to God. But, as a way of keeping militants within the fold and of keeping pace with the PLO as a force of resistance, Yassin sanctioned the import of arms and the formation of nascent militia groups. In 1987, when the first intifada began, in a Gaza refugee camp, Hamas—an acronym for Harakat al-Muqawama al-Islamiyya, the Islamic Resistance Movement—was born. Four years later, Hamas established its military wing, the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades. Led today by Mohammed Deif, who was born in a refugee camp in Khan Yunis, in southern Gaza, the Brigades have been behind countless military operations against Israel over the years, from car bombs to suicide attacks, though never anything as tactically intricate or as ambitious as Operation Al-Aqsa Flood. Among the stated objectives of the massacre, a Hamas leader said, was to free Palestinian prisoners in Israel and to protect the Al-Aqsa Mosque from desecration, but many suspected ambitions that were wider in scope, including scuttling a rapprochement between Israel and Saudi Arabia.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;The original Hamas charter, or covenant, was a nine-thousand-word treatise adopted shortly after the group&#39;s founding. It was filled with antisemitic conspiracy theories, all the traditional tropes of cunning, greed, and world domination: the Jews started the First World War, it asserted, in a scheme to topple the Islamic Caliphate, and they started the Second World War in order to make “huge profits from trading war materiel.” The Zionists, who had replaced “the state of truth” with “the state of evil,” aspire to “expand from the Nile to the Euphrates,” while Hamas “strives to raise the banner of Allah over every inch of Palestine.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Hamas, in its first decade, established no caliphate, but it did help propel the ascent of the right in Israeli politics. After Israel and the PLO signed the Oslo Accords, in Washington, in 1993; in Cairo, in 1994; and in Taba, Egypt, in 1995, Hamas tried to undermine progress toward a binding two-state resolution. The organization, which condemned the PLO for having recognized the state of Israel, backed a string of suicide bombings in Jerusalem, Tel Aviv, and elsewhere. Israeli militants, too, sought to sabotage the accords, and in 1995 a young right-wing zealot assassinated Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin. Israeli voters at first seemed likely to turn to a candidate from Rabin&#39;s Labor Party, Shimon Peres, who had received a Nobel Peace Prize, along with Rabin and Yasir Arafat, for his role in conceiving the Oslo agreements. Hamas, in a sense, was the spoiler. Playing on the fears of the people, Netanyahu and his Likud Party won with the support of conservatives, settlers, the ultra-Orthodox, and the Mizrachi, Jews with origins in the Middle East and North Africa. During the campaign, he made sure to be overheard when he told a spiritual leader of the Sephardim, Rabbi Yitzhak Kaduri, “Leftists have forgotten what it is to be Jewish. They think they will put security in the hands of the Arabs—that Arabs will look out for us.” He won the election, and though he has spent occasional periods in the wilderness, he has now been Prime Minister for a total of sixteen years, longer even than David Ben-Gurion.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In Netanyahu&#39;s first term, I spoke at length with him in Jerusalem, and even interviewed his father, Benzion, a reclusive scholar of the Spanish Inquisition whose sense that Jewish history is in perpetual danger of coming to an end exerted a powerful influence on his son. “The Jewish people have had a history unlike any other people&#39;s because they lacked the elements of national survival,” the Prime Minister told me. “On the other hand, they didn&#39;t perish completely. They perished &lt;em>;mostly&lt;/em>;. They were about ten per cent of the Roman Empire at the time of the birth of Christ, so by any calculation they should be about a hundred and twenty million and not twelve million. 。 。 。 What happened after the worst catastrophe in our history is that we somehow amassed the national will to reforge a vital center for Jewish life here in Israel.” Netanyahu&#39;s sense of the state and of himself as its unillusioned guardian was clear: “You have to protect yourself. This is what the Jews didn&#39;t have. They didn&#39;t have the means to protect themselves against evil, the baser impulses of mankind. And they paid a price unlike any other people. We now have the means to protect ourselves.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In 2005, Ariel Sharon, a Likud Prime Minister known as the Bulldozer, defied much of his right-wing constituency by evacuating the Israeli settlements in Gaza. The aim of disengagement was to yield a rough peace and make Israel more secure, but the following year Hamas rose to power, winning legislative elections and, after a military confrontation, ousting the Palestinian Authority from the Gaza Strip. There have been no elections since.&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;a data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a26735&amp;quot;}&quot;

In December, 2008, following a period of Qassam rockets and counterraids, Israel launched Operation Cast Lead, which killed at least a thousand Palestinians, devastated civic infrastructure in Gaza City, and left many thousands homeless. In 2012, Israel responded to Hamas rocket fire with eight days of air strikes; at least eighty-seven Palestinian civilians were killed. In 2014, after Hamas abducted and murdered three Israeli teen-agers, Israel commenced a seven-week assault, killing more than fourteen hundred Palestinian civilians.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;v8jwde&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;In 2017, Hamas toned down its rhetoric. Despite its authoritarian rule in the Strip—its suppression of the Palestinian Authority and any other rival for power—the group asserted in Article 28 of its updated manifesto that “Hamas believes in, and adheres to, managing its Palestinian relations on the basis of pluralism, democracy, national partnership, acceptance of the other and the adoption of dialogue.” The new document said that Hamas&#39;s fight was with Zionism, not with the Jewish people as such, but it unhesitatingly reaffirmed its ultimate ambition of eliminating the “Zionist entity.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;As the Israeli right solidified its hold on power, some in the country came to view its draconian anti-Palestinian policies with repugnance. Yair Golan is a retired Army general in his early sixties; he is graying yet as trim as a blade. He was an infantry commander during the second intifada, and then led the Judea and Samaria division, in the West Bank. But he grew increasingly disgusted with the military&#39;s treatment of Palestinians, and he did not keep his views to himself. A speech that he delivered seven years ago at a Holocaust Remembrance Day ceremony at Kibbutz Tel Yitzhak caused a furor. Golan, who was then the deputy chief of staff of the IDF, warned that Israeli society had grown callous to “the other,” and said, “If there is something that frightens me in the memory of the Holocaust, it is identifying horrifying processes that occurred in Europe, particularly in Germany, seventy, eighty, and ninety years ago, and finding evidence of their existence here in our midst today, in 2016.” He referred to an incident in Hebron in which an IDF sergeant was filmed shooting a Palestinian who had stabbed an Israeli soldier but had already been subdued and was prostrate. “There is nothing easier and simpler,” Golan said, “than behaving like a beast, becoming morally corrupt, and sanctimonious.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Although Isaac Herzog, now Israel&#39;s President, praised Golan for his “morality and responsibility,” Netanyahu blasted Golan&#39;s reference to the Holocaust as “outrageous,” and there were countless calls for the general&#39;s resignation. In the end, he walked back his comments somewhat, but his disenchantment was such that he joined Meretz, a political party to the left of Labor, vowing to battle the annexation of the West Bank.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I ran into Golan at the studios of Channel 13, near Jerusalem. He was there to tell the story about what he did on the morning of the massacre. As a reservist, he threw on his uniform, got his gun, drove to a military outpost in the city of Ramle, and asked to be an “envoy.” He made his way south and started getting calls from people whose friends or family were in the area, some of them at the Nova festival, in Re&#39;im. The calls came first from his sister and from a reporter at &lt;em>;Haaretz&lt;/em>;—both of whom had relatives hiding from the attackers—and then from others. He rescued them all, pulling them from behind bushes and trees and shuttling them to safety. Suddenly, he was all over the news.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;GenericCallout&quot;>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;A medical worker holds a deceased toddler.&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653c17d86e205727eb768723/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/231106_r43324.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653c17d86e205727eb768723/master/w_120,c_limit/231106_r43324.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653c17d86e205727eb768723/master/w_240,c_limit/231106_r43324.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653c17d86e205727eb768723/master/w_320,c_limit/231106_r43324.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653c17d86e205727eb768723/master/w_640,c_limit/231106_r43324.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653c17d86e205727eb768723/master/w_960,c_limit/231106_r43324.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653c17d86e205727eb768723/master/w_1280,c_limit/231106_r43324.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653c17d86e205727eb768723/master/w_1600,c_limit/231106_r43324.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;On October 21st, in southern Gaza, a medical worker cradled a victim of an air strike, one of many air assaults on Gaza in the previous two weeks.&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Photograph by Fatima Shbair / AP&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;As we sat together, Golan talked about the depths of the Israeli failure. About officials who thought that by “shrinking the conflict” they could maintain the status quo indefinitely. About the complacency engendered by high fences and a security system overly reliant on “startup nation” technologies and the Special Forces. About the failure of Netanyahu and his intelligence and military bureaucracies to heed warnings of imminent danger, in Gaza and beyond. About the moral deficits of a government obsessed with protecting its Prime Minister from criminal prosecution and indifferent to the corrosive effects of the blockade of Gaza and the occupation of the West Bank. All these factors helped open the way to the October 7th massacre, he believed, and to a war being led by an untrustworthy leader.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;“When you have a crisis, like Pearl Harbor or September 11th, it is a multidimensional crisis, a multidimensional failure,” Golan said. Netanyahu, who in 2009 was elected for the second time, after Operation Cast Lead, “made a terrible strategic mistake,” Golan went on. “He wanted quiet. So, while Hamas was relatively quiet, Netanyahu saw no need to have a vision for the larger Palestinian question. And since he needed the support of the settlers and the ultra-Orthodox, he appeased them. He created a situation in which, so long as the Palestinian Authority was weak, he could create the over-all perception that the best thing to do was to annex the West Bank. We weakened the very institution that we could have worked with, and strengthened Hamas.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Golan was referring to a strategy of Netanyahu&#39;s, deployed over the past fourteen years, that is known as the “conception.” Its aim was to weaken the Palestinian Authority, which sought territorial compromise, by bolstering its enemy Hamas. While refusing to engage the PA and its leader, Mahmoud Abbas, in any serious negotiations, the government permitted hundreds of millions of dollars from Qatar to stream into Hamas&#39;s coffers and increased the flow of work permits for Gazans with jobs inside Israel. It wasn&#39;t that Netanyahu cared one way or another about the poor of Gaza; it was, in his view, a matter of strategic guile. But, as Golan&#39;s old boss Gadi Eisenkot, a former IDF chief of staff, told &lt;em>;Ma&#39;ariv&lt;/em>; last year, Netanyahu carried out this strategy “in total opposition to the national assessment of the National Security Council, which determined that there was a need to disconnect from the Palestinians and establish two states.”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;GenericCallout&quot;>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;Seven people praying outside of a mosque.

The last decade in which I led Israel was the safest decade in Israel&#39;s history. But not only safe and secure for Israelis, also safe and secure for the Palestinians.” It was a litany of bad faith, deception, and delusion, with disastrous consequences.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“I commanded Judea and Samaria from 2005 to 2007,” Golan told me, referring to the West Bank. “The most frustrating thing to me is the inability of anyone to envision how these two peoples can live together. We are not going anywhere. And they are not going anywhere. Occupation is not a solution. Our peoples should both be led by sensible majorities, but both peoples are being led by their extremists. This is the challenge of Israel.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In the meantime, there was the spectre of a land war. Golan argued that this could not be avoided: “To recover our villages and kibbutzim in the south, we need one-hundred-per-cent security in the area. To do that, you need to make the military of Hamas irrelevant. There will be an ongoing operation, attacks all the time. In the next few days, you will see only the first stage of that war.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Before he hurried off to his next appointment, I asked him about the prospects of a multifront war: with Hamas, in Gaza; with Hezbollah, on the border with Lebanon; with Iranian proxy militias coming from Syria and Iraq; even with Iran itself. He put the chances at “ten or fifteen per cent.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In school or beyond, nearly every Israeli encounters Hayim Nahman Bialik&#39;s 1904 poem “In the City of Killing,” written in Hebrew just after the pogrom in Kishinev, in the Russian Empire&#39;s Pale of Settlement. After a local antisemitic newspaper published reports that Jews had murdered a Christian child in the area to use his blood for Passover matzo, mobs led by priests went on a rampage, with cries of “Kill the Jews!” A historical commission, in Odesa, assigned Bialik, a young Hebrew teacher, to travel to Kishinev and interview survivors for a kind of oral history. The poem became a rallying cry against the tsar and the Russian Empire, and, eventually, for Jewish national pride. Inspired by Bialik&#39;s words, many Russian Jews left for Europe, the United States, and Palestine.&lt;/p>;&lt;blockquote >;&lt;div >;&lt;p>;Get up and walk through the city of the massacre&lt;br/>;And with your hand touch and lock your eyes&lt;br/>;On the cooled brain and clots of blood&lt;br/>;Dried on tree trunks, rocks, and fences; it is they.&lt;br/>;Go to the ruins, to the gaping breaches.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/blockquote>;&lt;p >;Forty-nine Jews were massacred by the mob in Kishinev. It is hard to know what the fourteen hundred killed in a single day in Otef Aza will mean. Unlike the Jews in the Pale, Israel is hardly defenseless. But it is vulnerable, and it was plain that this massacre would influence the collective psyche—and the politics—of Israel for years to come.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;A week after the events of October 7th, an Israeli journalist and friend arranged for us to travel about an hour south from Tel Aviv to Kibbutz Kfar Aza. Once we passed the coastal cities of Ashdod and Ashkelon, we veered east, away from Gaza and into an area heavily guarded by IDF soldiers. In the fields near Gaza, troops, tanks, and armored personnel had started to establish positions for the planned ground invasion.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;An IDF press officer gave us bulletproof vests and Kevlar helmets. There had been no exchanges of gunfire in a few days, no evidence that Hamas fighters remained in the area, but an officer cautioned, “This is an active scene.” Founded in 1951, Kfar Aza was a prosperous kibbutz with two businesses on the site, one that made a dye for plastics, another that provided lighting and sound systems for events. Around seven hundred and fifty people lived there, with kindergartens, a gym, a swimming pool, and a cemetery. Now most of the houses were bullet-pocked ruins, caved in, blown up, torched. Earlier that day, the grounds had been cleared of the last cadavers, but the stench of death lingered. We were told there had been so many corpses, often burned or mutilated, that the young IDF soldiers could not bear the work and called in &lt;em >;Zaka&lt;/em>;, an organization of religious volunteers who, with meticulous care, collect bodies, body parts, and even blood, and give the dead a proper burial according to Jewish law. I&#39;d seen a video in which a volunteer poured cold water on one of the burned corpses. I asked why.

In a long career, he had gone on missions in the wake of all manner of disasters, in Haiti, Brazil, the Philippines, and Surfside, Florida. In February, following the earthquake in southern Turkey that left more than forty-five thousand dead, Vach and his team pulled nineteen people from the rubble, and received a commendation from the President, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. Vach, a lithe, purposeful man in his late forties, led us from house to ruined house, describing the battles fought by local security, soldiers, and police who, though under-armed and outmanned, had raced to Kfar Aza and rescued whomever they could until the Army arrived in force. That took many agonizing hours, and, for long periods, the Hamas fighters were able to take their time, killing, burning, collecting hostages.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;fd8p6i&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Vach led us into one ruin and described two women who&#39;d been found there, both naked, their hands bound behind their backs, shot in the head. Elsewhere, he said, he had found butcher knives, a decapitated soldier. He pointed to scraps of Hamas gear on the ground: a singed Kalashnikov clip, an abandoned battle vest, a paraglider. He was getting accustomed to questions about a dead baby he had carried out of a house. “People ask me why I didn&#39;t take a picture,” he said. “I said, &#39;I&#39;m sorry, I, too, have my limits.&#39; ”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Then, unprompted, he took out his phone and started showing me photographs he did take, one corpse after another. “Wait,” he said, swiping. “You will see the pile. They brought gasoline with them. Their intention was to burn.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In some parts of the world, I said, people will say it&#39;s all fake, it&#39;s all &lt;em>;hasbara,&lt;/em>; government propaganda. Vach looked at me unblinking. “Some people say that the Holocaust didn&#39;t exist, right? How do you respond to such people?”他说。 “I have pictures. But unless those people will be here and see with their own eyes, I guess they will not believe. But these people also, if they would see it with their own eyes, they would say that we faked the situation. So it doesn&#39;t matter.” His shoulders slumped. His hands slapped to his sides, and he looked around once more at the ruins. “This is evil.” In the near distance, from Gaza, we could hear rockets, Iron Dome interceptions, and Israeli jets.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;GenericCallout&quot;>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;Medical staff attend to an injured child.&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653c17d9150b105565237333/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/231106_r43326.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653c17d9150b105565237333/master/w_120,c_limit/231106_r43326.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653c17d9150b105565237333/master/w_240,c_limit/231106_r43326.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653c17d9150b105565237333/master/w_320,c_limit/231106_r43326.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653c17d9150b105565237333/master/w_640,c_limit/231106_r43326.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653c17d9150b105565237333/master/w_960,c_limit/231106_r43326.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653c17d9150b105565237333/master/w_1280,c_limit/231106_r43326.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653c17d9150b105565237333/master/w_1600,c_limit/231106_r43326.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;In a hospital in Khan Yunis, in southern Gaza, medical staff treat a boy&#39;s injuries.&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Photograph by Samar Abu Elouf / NYT / Redux&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Most of the evacuees from Kfar Aza were taken to a hotel on the grounds of Kibbutz Shefayim, on the Mediterranean coast, north of Tel Aviv. I arrived one afternoon to see yet another mass shiva—a sombre picnic taking place on the lawn, families huddled together, eating, carefully eying their kids kicking a soccer ball, playing tag.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Inside, in a conference room off the lobby, a woman from Kfar Aza named Yael Felus had helped set up what she called a “war room.” A dozen people were there, working phones and laptops, to arrange psychiatric care, to organize buses for funerals, to distribute clothes and food. Felus had grown up in Sderot, a coastal city about a half mile from Gaza. “I needed a quieter place,” she told me. “So I went to Kfar Aza. It seemed like a good place to raise my kids.” Now, she said, she would go back only “if they flatten Gaza and they go to live in Egypt.” She knew how that sounded and didn&#39;t seem to care. How could she go back? Before sending me to meet survivors from the kibbutz who were milling around the lobby, she said, “Most of my friends are dead.” She tried to count them all on her fingers, then gave up.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I met a woman named Roni Stahl Lupo, who was born at Kfar Aza in 1972; she knew nearly everyone who had died there. She, too, could not give an accurate count. She and her husband have three children and run a small business, designing industrial kitchens. Her sister, Ziv Stahl, is the executive director of Yesh Din (There Is Law), a human-rights group. Her family had barely escaped Kfar Aza alive. Before her daughter and her boyfriend fled the kibbutz grounds, Hamas gunmen shot at them, hitting the boyfriend twice in the hand. Lupo had lived through countless rocket attacks over the years, but now she was unsure whether she would stay in Israel at all.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;“During the demonstrations against this government, I began to feel that I&#39;m no longer part of the majority of this country,” she said. “Morally, socially, this is not my Israel. I&#39;m left-wing, Ashkenazi, a kibbutznik, and secular, and this is not the identity of Israel any longer. My contract with this country is over. It&#39;s broken.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;She was both enraged at Hamas and deeply anxious about the bombing of Gaza and the ground incursion taking shape near her old home. “I keep thinking that these operations will happen because of me, someone will be killed because of me,” she said. “And I cannot live with that.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;One morning, I visited Sari Nusseibeh, in East Jerusalem. A scholar of early Islamic philosophy who had been an informal adviser to Yasir Arafat, Nusseibeh was born in Damascus and lives in Sheikh Jarrah, a Jerusalem neighborhood that has been under assault and encroachment by settlers and the Israeli government for years. His family is distinguished in the extreme. For centuries, the Nusseibehs have been Muslim custodians of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, in the Old City. Nusseibeh&#39;s father, Anwar, was the governor of Jerusalem and Amman&#39;s Ambassador to the Court of St. James&#39;s. Nusseibeh, who is seventy-four, has always been a distinctly moderate voice in Palestinian public life, with friends all over the scholarly world. He is uncompromising in his insistence on Palestinian rights, and, in his books, he evinces sympathy with Jewish history and Israeli anxiety. At the same time, his disapproval of violence—whether perpetrated by Israeli settlers or Palestinian suicide bombers—is absolute.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Nusseibeh&#39;s weariness and apprehension as we sat down were palpable. “We have made so many advances—in technology, AI, medicine, everything except human relations,” he said. “I knew there would be constant explosions for as many years as it takes for people to finally learn that there has to be another way, but not a confrontation like this.” He shrugged. “No matter what, we will end up where we started, with the Palestinians and the Israelis living here together and needing to find a proper formula.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;On the morning of October 7th, Nusseibeh had just returned home from dropping off his wife and his daughter at the airport when he heard sirens. “My first reaction was &#39;Hmm, interesting.&#39; This happens every now and again, but then there were more sirens, then thuds, and the house actually shook. I thought, This might be serious.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;At first, he sensed great pride among many in his East Jerusalem community as the news broke. Palestinians on motorcycles, in pickup trucks, and on hang gliders had managed something that not even foreign armies had done. In 1973, the Egyptian Army surprised Israel in the western Sinai and the Syrians wiped out Israeli tanks in the Golan Heights, but, for the most part, they did not get close to Israeli population centers. Many Palestinians initially celebrated the Hamas attack as a blow to Israel&#39;s sense of invulnerability. But then, as the evidence of atrocities became common knowledge, Nusseibeh said, that elation curdled. Some even spoke of the incursion as a conspiracy, a guarantee that Israel would now turn so far to the right that the Palestinians would &lt;em>;never&lt;/em>; get statehood. The images were shocking. One detail that struck Nusseibeh was more banal: ordinary Gazans trailing the armed terrorists into Israel and looting. In one video, I saw a Gazan calmly walking with a guitar he had stolen; others took flat-screen TVs and carried them back into Gaza. “It&#39;s like in the wars in the Middle Ages,” Nusseibeh said. “People come behind the fighting to steal.”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;GenericCallout&quot;>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;People selling vegetables near destroyed buildings.&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653c17d9d67d6e6f5e40c493/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/231106_r43332.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653c17d9d67d6e6f5e40c493/master/w_120,c_limit/231106_r43332.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653c17d9d67d6e6f5e40c493/master/w_240,c_limit/231106_r43332.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653c17d9d67d6e6f5e40c493/master/w_320,c_limit/231106_r43332.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653c17d9d67d6e6f5e40c493/master/w_640,c_limit/231106_r43332.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653c17d9d67d6e6f5e40c493/master/w_960,c_limit/231106_r43332.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653c17d9d67d6e6f5e40c493/master/w_1280,c_limit/231106_r43332.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653c17d9d67d6e6f5e40c493/master/w_1600,c_limit/231106_r43332.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;In the Nuseirat market, in the Gaza Strip, people sell vegetables near buildings destroyed by Israeli air strikes.

But he is also convinced that Hamas and violent extremism, in general, will not recede without a political resolution. “It&#39;s a mistake to think that Hamas is an alien being—it is part of the national tapestry,” he said. “It grows bigger or smaller depending on other factors. You can eliminate the guys running Hamas now, but you cannot eliminate it entirely. It will stay as a way of thinking, as an idea, so long as there is a Palestinian-Israeli conflict.” He went on, “People say there is more support for Hamas in the West Bank than in Gaza and the reverse is true in Gaza, that there is more support for the PA And it has to do with governance.” In fact, a survey taken shortly before the October 7th attack showed widespread disaffection with Hamas among Gazans. Both entities are riddled with corruption and plagued by a lack of basic competence. And they were crippled, above all, by the circumstances of occupation and siege. The PA was no more capable of taking care of the needs of Ramallah and Jenin, Nusseibeh argued, than Hamas was able to cope with the burdens of daily life in Rafah, Khan Yunis, and Gaza City.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;497cxv&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Before we went our separate ways, Nusseibeh said he thought that Arab rulers, despite it all, had no taste for a multifront war, one that might pull in the United States. This was not the mid-century, when many Arab leaders still thought of Israel as temporary. But he was hardly optimistic—not in the short run, anyway. “I think people are crazy,” he told me. “Especially people in positions of power. They are crazier than the average person and can easily lead populations to war.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;On August 10, 2006, three Israeli novelists—David Grossman, Amos Oz, and AB Yehoshua—called on the Israeli government to accept a ceasefire proposal to end the Second Lebanon War. Two days later, Grossman&#39;s son Uri, a twenty-year-old staff sergeant in an Israeli tank brigade, was killed in a battle with Hezbollah. Grossman had been a peace activist for much of his adult life, speaking at demonstrations and publishing essays, alternately fierce and soulful, that were intended to pierce the indifference of his compatriots. “The Yellow Wind,” from 1987, was a collection of reported essays about the occupation (some of them published in these pages) which startled Israeli readers. When it was uncommon to do so, Grossman visited refugee camps and classrooms in the West Bank. While reporting on proceedings against Palestinians in an Israeli military court in Nablus, Grossman quoted the essay “Shooting an Elephant,” in which George Orwell wrote of an imperial police officer in Burma, “He wears a mask, and his face grows to fit it.” The theme is common to both writers: in enforcing injustice, the colonist deceives, and destroys, himself. “To the End of the Land,” a 2008 novel imbued with the loss of Grossman&#39;s son, is his masterpiece. I asked Grossman, who lives in Mevaseret Zion, in the hills outside Jerusalem, about his reaction to the events of October 7th.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Of course, we felt something was wrong with the whole management of the country,” he said. “We felt that our Prime Minister invests all his time in his trials and doesn&#39;t have enough time to take care of the country. But no one could anticipate &lt;em>;this&lt;/em>;.” He went on, “We saw a process that could have led to Hamas taking over Tel Aviv. We don&#39;t ever want to think about catastrophe, but thinking about catastrophe is my profession, and we were very close to that. I will tell you frankly, when I am confronted with such evil, pure evil, I don&#39;t want to live in such a world that allows such monstrosities. Just to be exposed to such things, to see the murder of children, women, pregnant women, babies—it is impossible to absorb it. The fifty-six years of occupation is terrible. I&#39;ve spent my entire life writing and acting against it, and I see some friends at American universities and elsewhere trying to achieve some sort of balance. But evils cannot always be compared. Sometimes, I tell my friends, objectivity is a nice way to cover up cowardice, to say, &#39;We are bad and they are bad.&#39; By doing so, you spare yourself, you refuse to expose yourself to the atrocities in front of you.”&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot;

of killing, it just feels different. Hamas made a major mistake in 2005, when we evacuated. Around ten thousand settlers were uprooted. If, after our withdrawal, the Palestinians had started to build in Gaza using the financial support they were promised, if they had made Gaza a kind of test case on how to build a life again, if Gaza had become, if not the &#39;Singapore of the Middle East,&#39; then at least a place where life could be developed, the next withdrawal would have come quickly. Instead, they chose another path. There were thousands of missiles aimed at us from Gaza in the next two years. And now, after they have done this, you start to think, Well, if you have such a neighbor, you had better be well equipped and suspicious all the time.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;In his view, the prospects for Israel, which just celebrated its seventy-fifth anniversary of existence, were grave. “I think the task of being an Israeli will be harder now,” he said. “The need to protect this country will be an even more serious issue. We thought this was all behind us after signing agreements with various Arab countries and the Abraham Accords. But you cannot have an Abraham Accord and ignore the Palestinians. We shall see now how exhausting it is to be an Israeli, to be all the time on the alert for surprise and violence. Once more, we will have to be both Athens and Sparta. We will try to be tolerant and decent to our neighbors, not racist but pluralist, liberal, yet at the same time very tough militarily.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In reality, Grossman knew, the political temper of the country was likely to grow increasingly distant from his view of the world. “I guess that Israel will become more and more right-wing, more and more religious,” he went on. “Jewish identity will be narrowed to self-defense. There will be more and more adoration of the Army, even though the Army has failed. My cry out to my Prime Minister is this: You have Israel in your hands, this precious thing. You are responsible for this unique country. If this country fails, will history be generous again?”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Sam Bahour is an American-born Palestinian who moved from Ohio to the West Bank in the wake of the Oslo Accords, a generation ago. Thinking he was building a future state, he helped establish the Palestine Telecommunications Company, travelling frequently between the West Bank and Gaza. He lives in Al-Bireh, the West Bank town his father came from, and when we spoke he was furious about the way that settler harassment and violence and seemingly random arrests of Palestinians were rising fast. “We turn on the radio every morning and we don&#39;t hear about the weather,” he said. “We hear about arrests.” Even more alarming, there were reports that dozens of Palestinians in the West Bank had been killed since the Hamas attack, some by settlers.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;For Bahour, there was nothing utopian about demanding a political solution; it was only its denial that was impractical, as well as unjust. “We don&#39;t ask for the moon,” he said. “We ask for a military occupation of fifty-six years to end. My fear is that this round, as much as it&#39;s doing tremendous damage, physical damage, to Gaza and to the people of Gaza, it is also exposing the hypocrisy of the West and the international community. And, if we go on doing that, it&#39;s a free-for-all.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In the West Bank and elsewhere, Bahour told me, “all the attention now is focussed on stopping the bombing in a small, intensely overcrowded place that is fifty per cent children. The entire civilian infrastructure is being torn up. I don&#39;t know how anyone—an Israeli or a Jewish American or anyone—thinks this assault will make Israel safer. They are doing just the opposite. Ironically, what Hamas did could have the effect of saving Netanyahu, of keeping him in power. Everyone knows that the day that this war stops he will be out of government. So now he is someone with nothing to lose, much like the people in Gaza. And people with nothing to lose lash out.”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;GenericCallout&quot;>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;Two people stand outside of a shipping container that holds multiple corpses in bodybags.&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653c17d97cf57774149d3624/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/231106_r43333.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653c17d97cf57774149d3624/master/w_120,c_limit/231106_r43333.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653c17d97cf57774149d3624/master/w_240,c_limit/231106_r43333.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653c17d97cf57774149d3624/master/w_320,c_limit/231106_r43333.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653c17d97cf57774149d3624/master/w_640,c_limit/231106_r43333.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653c17d97cf57774149d3624/master/w_960,c_limit/231106_r43333.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653c17d97cf57774149d3624/master/w_1280,c_limit/231106_r43333.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653c17d97cf57774149d3624/master/w_1600,c_limit/231106_r43333.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;At the Shura Military Base, in Israel, the bodies of victims of the October 7th attacks are still being identified.&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Photograph by Peter van Agtmael / Magnum for The New Yorker&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;The scenes of Hamas fighters standing in triumph over the dead, taking selfies and shouting “&lt;em>;Allahu akbar!&lt;/em>;,” recalled, for some, Frantz Fanon&#39;s line that “the colonized is the persecuted person who is always dreaming of becoming the persecutor.” Now those scenes were giving way to scenes of a devastated Gaza. Like Nusseibeh, and like Grossman, too, Bahour was unequivocally opposed to the killing of civilians. At the same time, he said, “we have to be wise, wise enough to hold multiple thoughts in our heads. There is the thought that Gazans would breach the fence and break out of their open-air prison—that is one thing. But it is another thing that they went into villages and killed civilians the way they did. It is a horrific act and must be condemned. But I also can&#39;t just have a knee-jerk reaction and think this is a story that started October 7th.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The task of holding in one&#39;s head multiple thoughts—multiple facts—was nearly impossible, particularly in the face of sloganeering and the allure of militancy. There is the thought that Israeli settlers, many of them armed, have stepped up their daily violence against Palestinian villagers, egged on by ministers in the Netanyahu government. That, though Israel is well armed and has powerful allies, it is also the size of New Jersey and faces multiple enemies—Hamas, Hezbollah, and Iran—whose leaders speak regularly of the elimination of “the Zionist entity.” That the unemployment rate in Gaza is forty-five per cent, the water barely potable, electricity and food in short supply, the health-care system in ruins. That antisemitism has, yet again, grown in breadth, intensity, and violence. That contempt for Palestinians is practically a norm in the current Israeli government, as when Smotrich, the finance minister, spoke at a memorial service in France and, standing in front of a map with Gaza, the West Bank, and Jordan melded into “Greater Israel,” declared, “There is no Palestinian history,” or when Ben-Gvir, the national-security minister, told journalists, “My right, my wife&#39;s, my children&#39;s, to roam the roads of Judea and Samaria are more important than the right of movement of the Arabs.” That many thousands of Palestinians have already been killed in the recent air strikes and well over a million have been internally displaced. There will be no end to it anytime soon: the funerals, the recriminations, the threats, the fear, the assaults.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;There was also the grim fact that Hamas had, in the most brutal fashion, shattered the illusion that a state could provide Israelis the guarantee of security. As Yonit Levi, the news anchor of Channel 12 put it to me, “Every single Jewish nightmare came true.” And so what would come in return? The air strikes on Gaza were proceeding at an unprecedented pace every night—lethal and incessant—and a ground incursion could lead to a hellscape of urban warfare, another Fallujah. It was a familiar nightmare, reminiscent of what followed 9/11, in which a stronger nation pursues a policy that, while trying to defeat an enemy for carrying out an unspeakable massacre, kills countless civilians and ultimately inflicts untold and lasting damage on itself.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The day after my visit to Kfar Aza, I took a cab to the town of Gan Yavne, twenty miles from Gaza, to attend the funeral of all five members of the Kutz family. Livnat and Aviv Kutz had been found dead together on a bed with their children, Rotem, Yonatan, and Yiftach. Throughout Israel, everyone seemed to know the story, that they had been discovered in a kind of final family embrace. Few knew that, over the wall, in Khan Yunis, nine members of the al-Bashiti family were reported to have been killed in an air strike. Killing was the common condition.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;At Gan Yavne, mourners stared at the five graves, deep and sharply dug. As people gathered under and around the perimeter of a white tent that blocked the hard afternoon sun, a volunteer from &lt;em >;Zaka&lt;/em>;, a man of astonishing industry and fitness, kept hopping in and out of the graves, preparing them, lining up sacks of dirt, ordering things according to Jewish law. Pressing forward to get a little closer to the service, I spotted Mia Kraus, a teen-ager and an evacuee from Kfar Aza whom I&#39;d spoken with at Kibbutz Shefayim. I reintroduced myself. “I remember you,” she said shyly. Like everyone at Kfar Aza, she knew the Kutz family well.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;More teen-agers from the kibbutz squeezed past the surrounding headstones and gathered tightly together, arm in arm with Mia in the first row behind the family&#39;s relatives. Her mind was here and &lt;em>;there:&lt;/em>; one of her friends was kidnapped and later found dead. Mia was sixteen, the same age, I recalled, that the poet Mosab Abu Toha had been when he was nearly killed on the streets of Gaza. In Mosab&#39;s poem “The Wounds,” he writes:&lt;/p>;&lt;blockquote >;&lt;div >;&lt;p>;If, when the rocket fell, I had moved my head a bit&lt;br/>;to watch a bird on a tree or to count&lt;br/>;the clouds coming from the west side,&lt;br/>;the shrapnel might have cut through my throat.&lt;br/>;I wouldn&#39;t be married to my wife,&lt;br/>;father of three kids, one born in America. 。 。 .&lt;br/>;I look around me, relatives circle my bed.&lt;br/>;I watch them as they chat. I imagine them praying round my coffin.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/blockquote>;&lt;p >;The funeral service began. When Mia and I had spoken at Kibbutz Shefayim, she told me that she could no longer be in a room with the door closed, not even the bathroom. It brought back the memory of hiding in her house for twenty hours with Hamas gunmen outside her door. Through a partially open window, she could hear their conversations. Somehow, the gunmen never came in. Her family survived. Yet she regularly found herself overtaken by crippling waves of fear.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The coffins were carried in and the names were read: one by one by one by one by one. At first, there was silence, but now a great communal lamentation convulsed the assembled. I have never heard such weeping as I did that afternoon. There would be many more funerals to come, many more convulsions of grief. But the sounds of lamentation never carry as far as those of rockets, missiles, artillery, bombs. As I was finishing this piece, Mosab messaged me, describing the nightly bombings in his neighborhood. A ground assault was imminent. “Any moment I may not be in this world,” he said. ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 28 Oct 2023 19:06:01 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Will the U.A.W.

Local 12 is the largest amalgamated union in the country, representing more than ten thousand people, including nearly six thousand at a Jeep factory in town. Typically, the monthly meeting attracts a far smaller crowd, but word of a possible strike had been circulating among UAW membership. The union&#39;s contract was set to expire three weeks later, at midnight, and negotiations between the union and representatives of the Big Three—General Motors, Ford, and Stellantis (Chrysler and Jeep&#39;s parent company)—were going nowhere. Bruce Baumhower, who is sixty-eight years old and has been president of the local for more than three decades, got up to the lectern. He has wisps of reddish-gray hair and the large forearms of a former assembly-line worker. He described how, not long ago, the union had given up hard-won wages and benefits to help save the industry in a period of crisis. Those compromises had been exploited by corporate greed, he said; close to a third of the unit still earned less than sixteen dollars an hour. The starting rate had barely budged in fourteen years. “That&#39;s all going to change now,” Baumhower said. “Now it&#39;s our time!”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The crowd exploded, applauding and yelling. Mike Sawaya, whose family has worked at the plant for three generations, was leaning against the wall behind the lectern. He was eight years old when he first met Baumhower, in the same auditorium; he&#39;d been so nervous that he spilled two plates of chili mac onto his lap. “Bruce let it rip,” Sawaya said. “This is what he&#39;s known for.” Baumhower told me later, in his office, “It probably wasn&#39;t a very professional speech—I just said the scam&#39;s up.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;On September 14th, the UAW&#39;s new president, Shawn Fain, called the first simultaneous strike against all Big Three companies in the union&#39;s history. He deployed a new tactic—the “stand-up strike”—which initially called for only one assembly plant from each company to walk out. The name was a reference to the sit-down strikes of the nineteen-thirties, in which workers occupied plants to prevent management or strikebreakers from operating the machinery. The stand-up tactic, as opposed to walking out all at once, would allow the UAW to stretch its eight-hundred-and-twenty-five-million-dollar strike fund, so that the strike could go longer and wider if progress wasn&#39;t made.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Baumhower, who started at Jeep in 1972, told me that he was pleased his plant was one of the first. “We &lt;em>;wanted&lt;/em>; to be the target,” he said. “We think we have the most injustice going on at the shop floor.” The plant&#39;s percentage of “supplemental,” or temporary part-time, employees—some of whom have been working that way for five or six years, with no guaranteed path to full-time employment—is one of the highest in the country, he said. A member&#39;s son recently came to see Baumhower about getting a job. Baumhower assured him that it would be no problem—the company needed more than a hundred new workers. “The kid goes, &#39;Yeah, how much?&#39; ” Baumhower recalled. “I said, &#39;Fifteen seventy-eight.&#39; He says, &#39;Oh.&#39; I said, &#39;What&#39;s the matter?&#39; He said, &#39;I&#39;m working at Arby&#39;s dropping fries for seventeen dollars. So I can drop transmissions in a car for fifteen or drop fries into a basket for seventeen?&#39; He&#39;s still at Arby&#39;s. Pretty smart kid.”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;GenericCallout&quot;>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;GroupCalloutWrapper&quot;>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;Black and white photograph of a tower at an industrial plant in Toledo Ohio&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653ace0968e701fce6dfdeba/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/231106_r43309.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653ace0968e701fce6dfdeba/master/w_120,c_limit/231106_r43309.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653ace0968e701fce6dfdeba/master/w_240,c_limit/231106_r43309.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653ace0968e701fce6dfdeba/master/w_320,c_limit/231106_r43309.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653ace0968e701fce6dfdeba/master/w_640,c_limit/231106_r43309.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653ace0968e701fce6dfdeba/master/w_960,c_limit/231106_r43309.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653ace0968e701fce6dfdeba/master/w_1280,c_limit/231106_r43309.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653ace0968e701fce6dfdeba/master/w_1600,c_limit/231106_r43309.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;Sherry Lee Linkon, a professor at Georgetown University, coined the phrase “the half-life of deindustrialization” to describe the long ripple effects of factory and mill closures.&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;Black and white photograph of UAW leader Bruce Baumhower sitting at his desk&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653ace111174d1e90a592358/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/231106_r43310.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653ace111174d1e90a592358/master/w_120,c_limit/231106_r43310.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653ace111174d1e90a592358/master/w_240,c_limit/231106_r43310.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653ace111174d1e90a592358/master/w_320,c_limit/231106_r43310.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653ace111174d1e90a592358/master/w_640,c_limit/231106_r43310.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653ace111174d1e90a592358/master/w_960,c_limit/231106_r43310.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653ace111174d1e90a592358/master/w_1280,c_limit/231106_r43310.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653ace111174d1e90a592358/master/w_1600,c_limit/231106_r43310.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;Bruce Baumhower, the president of Local 12, said that he was pleased his plant was one of the first to go on strike. “We &lt;em>;wanted&lt;/em>; to be the target,” he said.&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;The 2007-08 financial crisis was followed by a government bailout and a supervised restructuring of Chrysler and GM, which forced UAW workers across the Big Three to make major concessions to keep their jobs—and to keep the companies solvent. Gone was the annual cost-of-living adjustment and the health insurance for retirees, many of whom are not old enough to qualify for Medicare. Even break time was reduced from six minutes to five. Most significant was the introduction of a two-tiered pay system, under which new hires would start at half of what existing workers made. New hires also would not receive a pension.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Since the crash, average hourly wages for workers in vehicle manufacturing, adjusted for inflation, have fallen by nearly twenty per cent, according to a recent study by the Economic Policy Institute. The automakers, meanwhile, have seen enormous financial success. By 2013, the Treasury Department had sold its last stakes in Chrysler and GM and lifted restrictions on executive compensation. In the past decade, profits at the Big Three have almost doubled. The companies have spent billions on stock buybacks, and CEO pay has gone up by forty per cent; Mary Barra, the CEO of GM, earned twenty-nine million dollars last year.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;The Big Three aren&#39;t a monolith. Last Wednesday, Ford, which is reputed to have the best relationship with its workers, reached a tentative agreement to end the strike at its factories. The terms included a twenty-five-per-cent raise over a four-and-a-half-year contract, an end to wage tiers, and a right-to-strike provision over plant closures, a first for the UAW An agreement with one company generally pressures the other two to settle along similar lines.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The strike comes amid a wider revival of labor. Though union membership is at a historic low, in the past few years the number of striking workers has reached its highest level in decades. Recent walkouts by members of &lt;em >;SAG&lt;/em>;-&lt;em >;AFTRA&lt;/em>; and the Writers Guild and by workers at Kaiser Permanente have enjoyed broad public approval. According to a Gallup poll, sixty-seven per cent of Americans now support labor unions, nineteen points higher than in 2009. Moreover, the poll showed that seventy-five per cent sided with the UAW in its battle with the auto companies. Still, there have been pockets of antipathy. Jim Cramer, an analyst at CNBC, implied that Fain was a Trotskyite and encouraged the auto companies to move their entire production process to Mexico.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Recently, at Baumhower&#39;s striking Jeep plant, a group of workers from the Wrangler paint line were marching in front of one of the main entrances of the three-and-a-half-million-square-foot complex. The mood was defiant. They chanted, “No justice, no Jeeps!” and shouted as drivers on Interstate 75 zipped past, honking. Earlier, someone had incinerated a copy of the old UAW contract in a burn barrel. Todd Gibson, the strike captain on duty, kept the workers walking, back and forth, for six hours. Semi trucks were still making deliveries to the plant, slowly nosing forward through the picket.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Thirty-eight years in jail,” Gibson said with a laugh, when I asked how long he&#39;d worked at the plant. “Not everybody is molded to be a factory worker. You have to be able to handle the long-term, repetitive nature, let your mind go into a different place.” This was the first time during his tenure that the plant had been on strike.发生了什么变化？ He pointed to Amy Jo Luedtke, a middle-aged woman with bleached-blond hair. Luedtke was in elementary school when she decided that she wanted to work at the plant one day, after driving in a friend&#39;s parents&#39; “naked” Jeep (no doors, no top). She&#39;d been on the paint line for four years, as a supplemental. “I&#39;m here doing the same thing they&#39;re doing,” she said, glancing at her co-workers. “I should get the same thing they&#39;re getting.” Gibson told me, “See, I&#39;m on the end of this show, right? These guys are just starting it. I want to make it &lt;em>;good&lt;/em>; for them.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;On Halloween night, 2021, Jennifer Fultz went trick-or-treating with her seven-year-old daughter, Aria, and her ten-year-old son, Jordan, in her home town of Rockford, Illinois. The kids were both dressed as Pikachu. Fultz, who has long chestnut hair, hazel eyes, and thick glasses, had to finish the rounds early. She brought the kids home, hugged and kissed them goodbye, packed up her car, and, with her mother and her two cats, began the six-hour drive to Toledo. The next day, she was starting a new job at the Jeep plant there. Though the children would soon join her, she was nervous and heartsick. “I worried that, if something were to go wrong, it was just me and my mom in a brand-new city,” she said. “I was praying to God that I had made the right decision.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;For years, Fultz had worked at a Stellantis plant outside Rockford, building Jeep Cherokees. The company laid people off in waves, then idled the plant completely, eliminating the remaining thirteen hundred jobs. The next line of Cherokees would reportedly be built in Toluca, Mexico, making the plant another casualty of the North American Free Trade Agreement. Since &lt;em >;NAFTA&lt;/em>; went into effect, in 1994, it has cost the United States nearly a million jobs, a significant percentage of them in vehicle and parts manufacturing, according to a study by Robert Scott, a recently retired economist at the Economic Policy Institute. &lt;em >;NAFTA&lt;/em>; paved the way for other similar agreements, most notably one that established permanent normal trade relations with China, facilitating its entry into the World Trade Organization, in 2001. Scott estimates that the ensuing trade deficit cost the United States nearly four million jobs, most of them in manufacturing, which tended to be more heavily unionized than other industries. Even the spectre of outsourcing has provided corporations with a powerful cudgel: Stellantis recently threatened to move production of its Ram 1500 to Mexico, too, according to one of the UAW&#39;s lead negotiators. (In a statement, Stellantis said, “We are not commenting on production sites for future products.”)&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;In the past twenty years, the Big Three have closed more than sixty American plants. Fultz told me that her previous plant had been a “melting pot” of autoworkers from shuttered factories in New York, Maryland, and Missouri. Before getting hired by Stellantis, she had worked three other jobs—at Kohl&#39;s, at Papa John&#39;s, and at Subway, as a supervisor—and still could not afford to move out of her mother&#39;s house. “There are not a lot of good jobs back home,” she said. “Once Stellantis pulled the plug, that was it for the whole community.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Fultz works ten-hour shifts, six or seven days a week. The long hours have taken a toll on her physical health. A “little gremlin,” she said, lives on her shoulder. (Fultz spent a year and a half in the body shop, where she lifted and pulled heavy parts all day.) “I can&#39;t hold my daughter, who is light as a feather, for more than five seconds, because my hands go numb,” she told me. Last year, her mother was diagnosed with lung cancer. Fultz takes care of her but is guilt-stricken that the rest of her mother&#39;s family and friends are so far away. “I know that my family is suffering because I brought them here,” Fultz told me, as tears started to stream down her face.&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot;

I don&#39;t have a pension. I don&#39;t have health care when I retire. I&#39;m thirty-three, and my body is broken down already. That&#39;s not the American dream. The American dream isn&#39;t to work sixty, seventy hours a week in a factory, making a billionaire more billions, while I neglect time with my kids, time with my mother, time with my mister—just time. Then for the billionaires to say, &#39;You&#39;re being greedy&#39;—am I?”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;In late September, President Joe Biden announced that he would visit a picket line in Michigan. Fultz met him there. “We fist-bumped,” she recalled. “I told him, &#39;Please keep jobs in America, Mr. Biden.&#39; His response was &#39;That is why we need EVs&#39; ” Biden wants electric vehicles to make up two-thirds of the domestic market for passenger cars by 2032. He has also declared his intention to be the “most pro-union President in American history.” The UAW&#39;s strike, in part, aims to push him to fulfill both promises, to enact what the union calls a “just transition.”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;snynhw&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;The Biden Administration has called for tens of billions of dollars to support electric-vehicle manufacturing. Various federal laws and programs have established incentives for companies to build EVs and their batteries in America and to staff those plants with union workers. (The House version of the Inflation Reduction Act, passed last year, included a forty-five-hundred-dollar tax credit for buying union-built EVs, but it was stripped from the Senate version at the behest of Joe Manchin.) “If our tax dollars are going to finance this transition, then labor can&#39;t be left behind,” Fain said recently, on “Face the Nation.” Some prominent Democrats and political commentators have suggested otherwise. “If climate change is a central problem, we should want climate-change technologies produced as inexpensively as possible,” Lawrence Summers, the Treasury Secretary under Bill Clinton, said last month.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In 2022, GM partnered with a Korean electronics company to form a new venture called Ultium Cells, which opened a non-union battery plant behind a shuttered assembly complex in Lordstown, Ohio. The companies received two and a half billion dollars in low-interest federal loans. But the starting pay at Ultium was only $16.50 an hour. (In September, it was raised to twenty dollars.) So far, one worker has died from injuries sustained at the plant. Others have been hospitalized for electric shock and for possible chemical exposure; there have also been reports of dizziness, nausea, vomiting, and burns. (A technician had to be wheeled out on a gurney after being “sprayed in the face with toxic electrolyte.”)&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In December, workers at the plant voted overwhelmingly to unionize, but have so far been unable to secure a contract. According to a UAW safety report, there were twenty-two injuries reported to &lt;em >;OSHA&lt;/em>; in the first five months of 2023. A few weeks ago, federal regulators announced their intention to fine the company nearly three hundred thousand dollars. “It&#39;s a dangerous facility, much more than Lordstown,” Dave Green, a UAW regional director, who worked on the assembly line at the old complex, said. The UAW found a fifty-per-cent-higher incidence of &lt;em >;OSHA&lt;/em>; violations there than in traditional GM plants. (A spokesperson for Ultium said, “All safety concerns are taken seriously, investigated, and addressed promptly.”)&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Last year, Jim Farley, Ford&#39;s CEO, predicted that fewer workers will be needed to manufacture electric vehicles, given that their power trains don&#39;t require engines and thus have significantly fewer moving parts. Other experts disagree. A study last year by researchers at Carnegie Mellon University, for example, estimated that producing electric vehicles will actually require more jobs in the short and medium term, because the necessary components are more complicated to make, even if there are fewer of them. In any event, most of the newly announced battery plants will be built in Southern states that are hostile to labor. In June, the federal government awarded Ford and a partner company a nine-billion-dollar loan to build three battery plants in Kentucky and Tennessee. Fain criticized the Biden Administration for failing to pressure the companies to commit to using union labor.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Fultz and I walked out to the parking lot of Local 12, so she could show me her bright-blue Wrangler. Its dashboard, like those of several other Jeeps in the lot, was lined with toy ducks—tokens of good will that fellow Jeep owners give to one another, in a practice known as Jeep ducking. “I have a love-hate relationship with Stellantis,” Fultz said. “I need them to stay financially successful. But even if they were to close their doors today—and I hope they never do—I would probably go to GM or Ford. As crazy and unstable as the automobile industry is, there&#39;s something about knowing that a family is sitting in a car I could have built.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The day after Biden&#39;s visit to the Michigan picket line, Donald Trump showed up at Drake Enterprises, a non-union automotive-parts manufacturer in Macomb County, forty miles away. A lectern was set up in front of a row of enormous shelving units piled high with gear-shift levers and other transmission parts. Secret Service officers shared security responsibilities with heavily tattooed, bearded men wearing black gloves and olive-green shirts. Campaign volunteers passed out signs that read “&lt;em >;Union Members for Trump&lt;/em>;” to anyone who would take them.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Tony Brouckaert, a self-employed tool-and-die maker, was standing by himself in the crowded room. He used to work in a hydraulic-tool factory, which has a union. He&#39;d tried to get rid of it. “I&#39;m a firm believer that, if you&#39;re a hardworking employee, you don&#39;t need the union,” he told me. Nevertheless, most of his political grievances were economic, and rooted in the disappearance of benefits that unions once reliably provided. His job has left him with a bad shoulder, but Obamacare is too expensive, so he is waiting until he&#39;s sixty-five and on Medicare to have it treated.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;After several hours, Trump entered to Lee Greenwood&#39;s “God Bless the USA” and an ecstatic standing ovation. His speech, at turns fluid, deceptive, and frightening, called for a “revival of economic nationalism” and stoked rising economic anxieties. “I put everything on the line to fight for you,” he said. “I have risked it all to defend the working class from the corrupt political class.” He fixated on &lt;em >;NAFTA&lt;/em>;, a persistent theme of his campaigns, especially during stops in Rust Belt states, whose political swings have determined the winners of the past two Presidential elections. Trump called &lt;em >;NAFTA&lt;/em>; “the worst trade deal ever made” and boasted about having renegotiated it in 2018. (The new deal preserved much of the original one; it has been called &lt;em >;NAFTA&lt;/em>; 2.0.) He repeatedly emphasized the threat of electric vehicles. “For autoworkers, Biden&#39;s forced transition is a transition to hell,” he said. “It&#39;s a transition to unemployment.” The current strike was meaningless, he added, because “under Biden&#39;s mandate the entire car industry will be packed up and shipped to China.” Though not many UAW members were present, he implored the crowd to lobby Shawn Fain to endorse him.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;GenericCallout&quot;>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;Black and white photograph of UAW President Shawn Fain climbing onto the bed of a pickup truck and being handed a microphone&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653ace1968e701fce6dfdebc/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/231106_r43311.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653ace1968e701fce6dfdebc/master/w_120,c_limit/231106_r43311.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653ace1968e701fce6dfdebc/master/w_240,c_limit/231106_r43311.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653ace1968e701fce6dfdebc/master/w_320,c_limit/231106_r43311.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653ace1968e701fce6dfdebc/master/w_640,c_limit/231106_r43311.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653ace1968e701fce6dfdebc/master/w_960,c_limit/231106_r43311.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653ace1968e701fce6dfdebc/master/w_1280,c_limit/231106_r43311.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653ace1968e701fce6dfdebc/master/w_1600,c_limit/231106_r43311.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;During a speech in Detroit, Shawn Fain, the president of the UAW, framed the union as part of an “arsenal of democracy” fighting corporate greed.&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;In 2016, exit polls showed that Trump won two-thirds of voters who believe trade with foreign countries takes away American jobs; this helped him flip Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania, which he carried by fewer than eighty thousand total votes. Fultz told me that she felt she had “the most job security when Trump was in office.” But Trump&#39;s political career has been marked by intense hostility toward labor. In 2015, when campaigning for President, he told the Detroit &lt;em>;News&lt;/em>; that automakers should pursue a kind of intra-national &lt;em >;NAFTA&lt;/em>;, moving plants out of Michigan to parts of the US where labor was cheaper, and then returning to the state after workers there had become desperate enough to accept lower wages. “You can go to different parts of the United States, and then ultimately you&#39;d do full circle,” he said. “We can do the rotation in the United States—it doesn&#39;t have to be in Mexico.”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;7ec8s&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;During Trump&#39;s Presidency, the country lost a hundred and seventy thousand manufacturing jobs and close to seven thousand factories. In 2017, Trump appointed Peter Robb, a management-side lawyer, as general counsel to the National Labor Relations Board. Robb had served as Ronald Reagan&#39;s lead attorney when Reagan fired more than eleven thousand air-traffic controllers, effectively breaking their union and igniting a decades-long attack on labor by the right.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;When Trump finished his speech, it was pouring outside. Standing in the rain, waiting to wave on the motorcade, was Isaiah Goddard, a UAW member who works at a Ford parts plant. “I think it was a very beautiful speech, from the heart,” he said. “It shows that he cares about us autoworkers.” Goddard was eager to take up Trump&#39;s challenge: “I&#39;m going to do everything I can to talk to Shawn Fain and try to get him to endorse Donald Trump.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Two days later, a “solidarity convoy” of Broncos, Jeeps, and Colorados gathered in the parking lot of Local 51, on Detroit&#39;s East Side. The procession cruised toward the city&#39;s downtown, honking to diverse approval: a Black man walking along a deindustrialized artery raised his fist; in tony Indian Village, two white joggers stopped to applaud. Union members had already convened in the parking lot of Solidarity House, the convoy&#39;s destination and the headquarters of the UAW Built in 1951, the low-slung modernist structure is situated on a site along the Detroit River which once contained Edsel Ford&#39;s mansion, orchard, and garden. Loudspeakers in the parking lot blasted DJ Khaled&#39;s “All I Do Is Win” as a group of workers began dancing wildly.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Fain grabbed a microphone and jumped onto the bed of a Ram pickup. He has short-cropped gray hair and wears glasses; he looks a bit like a high-school shop teacher. He began by talking, in a measured drawl, about a plan conceived by Walter Reuther, a former president of the UAW, to use excess capacity at Detroit&#39;s auto factories to make military equipment during the Second World War—to create what came to be called an “arsenal of democracy.” Elements of the plan were adopted by Franklin D. Roosevelt, turning Detroit into an unrivalled industrial powerhouse; a single Chrysler plant produced half the country&#39;s tanks. “Eighty years later, we find ourselves again as a part of the arsenal of democracy,” Fain said. “It&#39;s different this time. The enemy is not a foreign power, across an ocean. The enemy is right here among us—it&#39;s corporate greed.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Fain, who is fifty-four, was raised in Kokomo, Indiana, a city of sixty thousand. Kokomo has five Stellantis power-train plants, which together employ more than seven thousand people.

They had grown up during the Depression, in deep poverty in Tennessee and Kentucky; one grandmother was abandoned with her siblings at an orphanage. Fain&#39;s paternal grandfather was hired by Chrysler in 1937, the year it was organized by the UAW “He was so proud of that job,” Fain said. His grandfather saved every one of his pay stubs for the next thirty-five years. “He kept them in a box until the day he died,” Fain continued. “Before he passed, he was asking his grandkids if there was anything we wanted.” Fain asked for the stubs. “Honestly, I didn&#39;t even know why,” he said. “But those have become a treasure to me.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In 1994, Fain was hired by Chrysler as an electrician. Like many autoworkers, he recalls his first day with a mixture of awe and terror. “They took us out on the shop floor,” he said. “The die-casting plant where I worked was very hot in the summertime—it could reach a hundred thirty degrees.” Overhead cranes carried molten aluminum on a monorail. Sirens went off constantly. “I thought, What the hell did I get myself into?” he told me.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Two years earlier, Fain had voted for Ross Perot over Bill Clinton and George H. W. Bush in the Presidential election. “Pretty simple,” Perot said, in a debate that year. “If you&#39;re paying twelve, thirteen dollars, fourteen dollars an hour for factory workers, and you can move your factory south of the border, pay a dollar an hour for labor . 。 。 have no environmental controls, no pollution controls, and no retirement, and you don&#39;t care about anything but making money, there will be a giant sucking sound going south.” “That resonated with me,” Fain said. “He was the only candidate saying that.”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;GenericCallout&quot;>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;GroupCalloutWrapper&quot;>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;Black and white photograph of a person sitting in the backseat of a Jeep.

They are no different from my family.” Despite his fear that workers will be left out of the green transition, he has little patience for Republican politicians, including Trump, who rebuke it as liberal pandering. Fain notes that Reuther, one of his heroes, was an early proponent of environmentalism; it was part of his broad political vision for the union. He lobbied for the Clean Air Act against opposition from the major American auto companies, and wrote the first check for the first Earth Day, in 1970, to which the UAW became the largest contributor. He once asked, “What good is another week&#39;s vacation if the lake you used to go to is polluted and you can&#39;t swim in it and your kids can&#39;t play in it?”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Walter Reuther was born in 1907 in Wheeling, West Virginia. His father, Valentine, a union organizer, drove a horse-drawn beer wagon and ran for state legislature on the Socialist Party ticket. In 1919, when Eugene Debs was in prison in West Virginia, Valentine took Walter to meet him. (Debs was convicted of violating the Espionage Act for opposing America&#39;s involvement in the First World War.) Walter became a Socialist, too, dropped out of high school, and started working as an apprentice tool-and-die maker at Wheeling Steel. (A four-hundred-pound die landed on his foot, costing him a toe.) He later moved to Detroit, where wages were better, and got a job at a Ford plant while attending what became Wayne State University. In 1932, Reuther left Ford, claiming that he was forced out because of his political activities. He withdrew a chunk of his savings and went to Europe with his brother Victor. They travelled through ten countries, mostly by bicycle, before ending up in the Soviet Union, where they worked for a year and a half at a new automotive plant. The food was unfamiliar—each brother lost about twenty pounds—but Walter found the atmosphere in the plant&#39;s cafeteria “absorbing,” and praised “the wonderful spirit” found among the workers, who sometimes strummed guitars and danced at lunch.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Reuther returned to Detroit in 1935, the year Roosevelt signed the Wagner Act, which guaranteed the right to collectively bargain—and to strike. At the time, conditions in automobile plants were appalling. During a heat wave, hundreds of autoworkers died in plants in Michigan. Autoworkers earned an average of nine hundred dollars a year; the government estimated that a family of four needed nearly double that, at a minimum, to survive. Meanwhile, General Motors was employing a Ku Klux Klan offshoot called the Black Legion to break up union-organizing efforts.&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot;

He participated in the Flint Sit-Down Strike, a violent forty-four-day battle that led to the unionization of GM A similar tactic was used to unionize Chrysler. During the Battle of the Overpass, in which UAW organizers were savagely beaten by Henry Ford&#39;s private security guards outside an assembly plant in Dearborn, Reuther was kicked in the face and thrown down two flights of stairs. Finally, in 1941, after a ten-day strike, the union succeeded in organizing Ford, too.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;During the Second World War, with factories running around the clock, there was a tremendous demand for workers. Hundreds of thousands of them, Black and white, migrated to the city, especially from the South. In June, 1941, Roosevelt issued an executive order banning discriminatory employment practices in the defense industry, the first Presidential civil-rights order since Reconstruction. White workers, sometimes stoked by management, responded with so-called hate strikes—in 1943, twenty-five thousand walked out from Packard after it promoted three Black people to the aircraft assembly line. R. J. Thomas, the UAW president at the time, suspended thirty of the ringleaders, and, with help from government agencies, brought the rest of the strikers back to work. “We will not retreat,” Thomas said. “If we take any other position, our organization is lost.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Reuther was elected president of the UAW in 1946. In a speech that year, he argued that the labor movement should not focus solely on economic gains for its members but instead must “fight for the welfare of the public at large.” Two years later, a hit man nearly assassinated him in his kitchen. Afterward, his renown grew; there was speculation that he would run for President of the US His social-democratic vision came to encompass a variety of causes—nuclear disarmament, environmentalism, and, especially, civil rights. When Martin Luther King, Jr., and dozens of other demonstrators were arrested in Birmingham, in 1963, Reuther sent two deputies with a hundred and sixty thousand dollars in cash to bail them out. He was the only prominently featured white speaker at the March on Washington.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In 1970, Reuther died in a plane crash en route to Black Lake, Michigan, where he was building a thousand-acre labor-education retreat. Not long afterward, real wages for non-college-educated workers began to decline. Oil shocks, deregulation, high interest rates, and globalization increasingly shifted industrial jobs first to the non-union South and then to low-wage foreign countries. By that point, the UAW&#39;s membership had peaked, at one and a half million.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;feature-large-callout&quot; >;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;Black and white photograph of people attending a Donald Trump event holding signs that say Union Members for Trump and...&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653ace4a5b9aced69685b661/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/231106_r43314.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653ace4a5b9aced69685b661/master/w_120,c_limit/231106_r43314.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653ace4a5b9aced69685b661/master/w_240,c_limit/231106_r43314.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653ace4a5b9aced69685b661/master/w_320,c_limit/231106_r43314.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653ace4a5b9aced69685b661/master/w_640,c_limit/231106_r43314.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653ace4a5b9aced69685b661/master/w_960,c_limit/231106_r43314.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653ace4a5b9aced69685b661/master/w_1280,c_limit/231106_r43314.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653ace4a5b9aced69685b661/master/w_1600,c_limit/231106_r43314.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;In September, Donald Trump announced that he would travel to Michigan to support striking autoworkers; the event was held at a non-union manufacturer.&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;The UAW got weaker. Fain traces this downswing in part to the creation of “joint programs”—management-labor partnerships that he believes undermined the union&#39;s independence. Forty years of what Fain calls “company unionism” contributed to a series of bad contracts and laid the foundation for a corruption scandal that broke in 2017, after a federal probe, and led to seventeen convictions, including of two past UAW presidents, in 2021, and three former Chrysler executives. The executives had paid more than three and a half million dollars in bribes to UAW officials, partly through credit cards issued by one of the company&#39;s joint training centers, in Detroit. Union officials also spent more than a million dollars of members&#39; money on golf, steak dinners, cigars, and booze. Earlier this year, Fain narrowly won the UAW presidency, on a promise to restore the union to its Reuther-era militancy. (The UAW is still under a court-appointed monitor.)&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;sztc5w&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Today, the union has three hundred and eighty thousand active members; less than half are employed by the Big Three. (In the seventies, the UAW organized administrative staff at Wayne State; more than a quarter of the union&#39;s members now work in higher education.) The accumulated troubles have driven Fain to take an aggressive approach to the current negotiations—he needs the deal to be good enough to woo workers in the burgeoning electric-vehicle industry, where many competitors, including Toyota and Tesla, are not unionized. Fain told me that there was little to distinguish non-union jobs from many of the positions that the Big Three were offering. He added, “It&#39;s hard to grow a movement when people can&#39;t see the difference.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Two weeks into the strike, the kitchen at Local 12 was buzzing. Doris Jones and a few assistants were making a hundred breakfasts to bring to the picket line. Jones, who is fifty-five years old and has long braids, poured gallons of eggs onto a griddle next to piles of turkey sausage. She had been arriving at the hall at six in the morning every day since the strike started and staying until midnight, sometimes later. “I&#39;m a twenty-four-hour time bomb,” she told me. She has worked at the Jeep plant for more than two decades. Shortly before the strike, she&#39;d placed boxes around the plant to collect donations for the union&#39;s food pantry. It was now stacked with diapers, one of the most coveted commodities, and with packaged food, including rice and instant mashed potatoes, which she gave to any member who came in, along with whatever fresh food—plums, peaches—she could get hold of.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Twenty-four years ago, Jones was in nursing school in Toledo when a counsellor offered her an application for a position at the Chrysler Jeep plant. Two weeks later, she was working in the body shop. “I was using weld guns, connecting stuff like the fenders, hoods, the doors,” she told me. “I was getting burned up—my hair, my body, my clothes—and would go home crying. I said, &#39;I&#39;m not going back.&#39; But as the days went by I knew I had a good job, enough money to take care of my family.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;GenericCallout&quot;>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;Black and white photograph of a person holding a small child they are photographed from behind.

She earns about thirty-three dollars an hour, and in six years will be eligible for a pension. Several members of her family have worked at the plant, too, including one of her three sons, who was a supplemental employee, earning half of what his mother made. He told me, of the strike, “It&#39;s hurting a lot of people who need the money.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;By late September, the number of people coming into the food pantry had increased. Striking plants have gummed up entire supply chains, causing thousands of layoffs in other factories. Those workers do not receive five hundred dollars a week in strike pay from the union, though they can file for unemployment insurance, which, in Ohio, is half a worker&#39;s average weekly wage. One day, as I was leaving the pantry, a middle-aged Black woman wearing tinted glasses walked in. She had been laid off from a Chrysler supplier that shut down because of the strike, and she was still waiting for her first unemployment check. She wrote her name in a ledger, and Jones handed her a bag of food. “I&#39;m very, very thankful,” the woman said quietly, as she slipped out the door.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Marcy Kaptur, the Democratic representative for Ohio&#39;s Ninth District, which includes part of Toledo, describes herself as a “daughter of the UAW” Her mother, who worked at Champion, the spark-plug company, was on the union&#39;s first organizing committee there; her father worked at the Jeep plant for a decade. She believes that this strike is historic. “The conditions have become so untenable in these plants,” she said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In the early nineties, in the House of Representatives, Kaptur led the fight against &lt;em >;NAFTA&lt;/em>;, which nonetheless passed, 234–200. It was a bipartisan bill; a hundred and two Democrats and a hundred and thirty-two Republicans supported it. On the night of the vote, Kaptur said, corporate lobbyists were given a Ways and Means Committee room as an improvised headquarters from which to whip up last-minute support. At one point, she saw John Sweeney, who would soon be elected president of the AFL-CIO, come in through a side door to the Capitol. No one paid attention to him. He held his raincoat over his arm, and walked up the stairs to the gallery, alone.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;After &lt;em >;NAFTA&lt;/em>; passed, Kaptur visited the &lt;em>;maquiladoras&lt;/em>;, mostly electronics and car-part factories just south of the US-Mexico border. The workers there, who had no independent trade unions, were making as little as a dollar an hour. Many of them, she said, lived in “hard paper shacks, if you could call them that,” and had no fresh water. “I&#39;m for free trade among free people,” she went on. “When people are not free, they become exploited by their own governments.” She blamed &lt;em >;NAFTA&lt;/em>; for other deleterious outcomes, such as allowing American agribusinesses to flood Mexico with cheap corn, wiping out much of the country&#39;s subsistence farming. Studies estimate that some two million Mexican farmers lost their livelihoods as a result. Many of them immigrated to the United States; others stayed behind and replaced corn with opium poppies, for producing heroin.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The over-all national income is higher in the United States with free trade, but the majority of people are worse off. According to research by Josh Bivens, of the Economic Policy Institute, trade with low-wage countries costs American workers without a college degree—roughly sixty per cent of the population—twenty-three hundred dollars a year in lost wages, even after accounting for the lower prices of consumer goods. Since 1998, the US has lost more than seventy thousand plants and five million manufacturing jobs, many of them in the Rust Belt. Sherry Lee Linkon, who teaches working-class studies at Georgetown University, coined the phrase “the half-life of deindustrialization” to describe how the ripple effects of factory and mill closures can last for generations. Last month, Anne Case and Angus Deaton, economists at Princeton, published new research showing that life expectancy for Americans without a college degree peaked around 2010 and has been falling ever since. By 2021, not having graduated from college meant eight and a half fewer years of life.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;GenericCallout&quot;>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;GroupCalloutWrapper&quot;>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;Black and white photograph of a plane flying against a cloudy sky towing a banner that reads TRUMP SOLD US OUT&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653ace52042a0d0fdf299d9c/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/231106_r43316.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653ace52042a0d0fdf299d9c/master/w_120,c_limit/231106_r43316.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653ace52042a0d0fdf299d9c/master/w_240,c_limit/231106_r43316.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653ace52042a0d0fdf299d9c/master/w_320,c_limit/231106_r43316.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653ace52042a0d0fdf299d9c/master/w_640,c_limit/231106_r43316.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653ace52042a0d0fdf299d9c/master/w_960,c_limit/231106_r43316.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653ace52042a0d0fdf299d9c/master/w_1280,c_limit/231106_r43316.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653ace52042a0d0fdf299d9c/master/w_1600,c_limit/231106_r43316.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;Despite Trump&#39;s hostility toward labor, he has made criticism of NAFTA, which he calls “the worst trade deal ever made,” a centerpiece of his political career.&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;Black and white photograph of former US President Donald Trump in a crowd of people looking down&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653ace5676baabf44ad3a2a6/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/231106_r43317.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653ace5676baabf44ad3a2a6/master/w_120,c_limit/231106_r43317.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653ace5676baabf44ad3a2a6/master/w_240,c_limit/231106_r43317.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653ace5676baabf44ad3a2a6/master/w_320,c_limit/231106_r43317.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653ace5676baabf44ad3a2a6/master/w_640,c_limit/231106_r43317.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653ace5676baabf44ad3a2a6/master/w_960,c_limit/231106_r43317.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653ace5676baabf44ad3a2a6/master/w_1280,c_limit/231106_r43317.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653ace5676baabf44ad3a2a6/master/w_1600,c_limit/231106_r43317.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;The current strike was meaningless, Trump said, because “under Biden&#39;s mandate the entire car industry will be packed up and shipped to China.”&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Bill Clinton and Barack Obama each won Ohio twice, but neither arrested the economic decline of the state&#39;s working class, which is particularly acute in the traditionally Democratic northern corridor. (During Obama&#39;s first Presidential campaign, he called &lt;em >;NAFTA&lt;/em>; “devastating” and “a big mistake”; in office, he pushed for the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a free-trade deal with eleven countries.) “As deindustrialization occurred, especially in steel-making places like Youngstown, those areas became increasingly redder,” John Russo, an emeritus professor of working-class studies at Youngstown State University, told me. “The reason for that, as much as any other, is the Democrats couldn&#39;t—or wouldn&#39;t—protect those places from what was happening.” In Kaptur&#39;s view, Trump seized on this opening. “He&#39;s like the last brass ring on the merry-go-round,” she said. “He expresses, in his rather demented way, the angst that people feel, the uncertainty that people feel—and he expresses their rage.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The Democrats, meanwhile, are in thrall to the coasts. (The Party&#39;s House leaders are all from coastal states.) “We have to fight like hell for this part of the country, because we&#39;re ignored,” Kaptur said. She noted that the most recent Amtrak appropriations contained “nothing” for rail in the Midwest and twelve billion dollars for the Northeast Corridor. In 2021, Republicans in the Ohio state legislature redrew her district to include more conservative areas, in a clear attempt to oust her, yet she was reëlected, defying expectations. That victory, and those of Senator Sherrod Brown, who has also vigorously opposed free-trade agreements, reflects the salience of the issue. Kaptur is worried about 2024, and beyond. “The Democrats are very fortunate to have many educated people in the Party,” she said. “But, when you start losing the working people of America, you&#39;re in big trouble—and they are.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;A recent New York &lt;em>;Times&lt;/em>;/Siena poll showed Biden slipping badly with working-class voters of all races; his lead among nonwhite, non-college-educated voters has fallen to just sixteen points, down from forty-eight in 2020. Meanwhile, the UAW strike has become something of a cause célèbre for aspiring right-wing populists. In September, the Republican senator Josh Hawley joined a GM picket line in Wentzville, Missouri, despite his previous support for a right-to-work bill, which would have weakened the finances and the bargaining power of the state&#39;s unions. Soon afterward, the Republican senator JD Vance, who had a previous career in venture capital, joined Kaptur on the Jeep picket line. “First time here?” she asked him.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The union&#39;s stand-up-strike strategy is paying off. In late September, minutes before a 10 &lt;em >;AM&lt;/em>; deadline at which more plants would go offline, Stellantis agreed to reinstate its cost-of-living adjustment. After the UAW threatened to strike at a lucrative General Motors plant that makes Cadillac SUVs, the company committed to placing new battery plants under its master agreement with the union. (Later, that plant went on strike anyway.) “We&#39;ve been told the EV future must be a race to the bottom,” Fain, wearing an “Eat the Rich” T-shirt, said in a video announcement. “Now we&#39;ve called their bluff.” By late October, he had expanded the strike to include more than forty-five thousand workers across twenty-two states, and the most profitable facilities for each of the three automakers.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Then came the breakthrough: the tentative agreement with Ford. Fain instructed his members there to get back to work, so that the company could start building and selling cars again as quickly as possible, which would further pressure General Motors and Stellantis to settle. According to the Anderson Economic Group, the Big Three have lost more than four billion dollars since the strike began.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The economic pain has also been deepening for the workers still on strike. After speaking to the convoy in Detroit, Fain paid a visit to the Jeep picket line in Toledo. He was received with adulation, but also drew notes of skepticism. “How long do you think before we start struggling?,” one worker, who was holding his young daughter, asked. Another said, “Some of us are struggling already. Like, is that a discussion?” (For most workers, strike pay is less than half a weekly paycheck.) Fain nodded. “It sucks,” he said. “We don&#39;t want to be out here. But at the end of the day the company&#39;s put us in this position. It&#39;s a choice: Do we strike? Or do we continue to go backward?”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;feature-large-callout&quot; >;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;Black and white photograph of people marching in a picket line with a large road in the background&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653ace5a68e701fce6dfdebe/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/231106_r43318.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653ace5a68e701fce6dfdebe/master/w_120,c_limit/231106_r43318.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653ace5a68e701fce6dfdebe/master/w_240,c_limit/231106_r43318.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653ace5a68e701fce6dfdebe/master/w_320,c_limit/231106_r43318.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653ace5a68e701fce6dfdebe/master/w_640,c_limit/231106_r43318.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653ace5a68e701fce6dfdebe/master/w_960,c_limit/231106_r43318.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653ace5a68e701fce6dfdebe/master/w_1280,c_limit/231106_r43318.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653ace5a68e701fce6dfdebe/master/w_1600,c_limit/231106_r43318.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;For most workers, strike pay is less than half a weekly paycheck. “It sucks,” Fain said. “The company&#39;s put us in this position.

Toledo appeared to be in somewhat better shape than other Rust Belt cities where I had spent time—Racine, Youngstown, River Rouge—but the emptiness was unmooring. The United States has destroyed its industrial base more deeply than other Western countries have. Given that both Democrats and Republicans had a hand in the destruction, the political fallout has been unpredictable. Many workers I met seemed to view the upcoming Presidential race with distance and cynicism. They were more animated by the visceral, immediate politics of the strike.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;By the time I got back to the hall, it was getting dark. I saw Jones bustling around. It had been another long day; she looked exhausted but also content. Someone had donated trays of fried chicken, and she was going to the picket to deliver them. We walked out to her white Jeep and she opened the back door. The smell was enticing, and she insisted I take a piece. I asked what she had thought of Fain&#39;s visit. She answered slowly and deliberately. “He spoke the truth,” she said. Anxiety about the strike was rising among the door-line-crew members, but Fain had managed to calm them. “I saw them being a little more at ease, listening to the words he was saying,” she said. “He was reassuring them that they&#39;re going to be great.” She shut the door, waved goodbye, and drove back to the line. ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 28 Oct 2023 19:06:01 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[My Grandmother and the Canine Detective]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-weekend-essay/my-grandmother-and-the-canine-detective]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-28T10:00:00.000Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653c3039150b1055652375c2/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Zhou_Inspector_Rex_4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;article >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attribute-verso-pattern=&quot;article-body&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;ArticlePageChunks&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;My grandmother, who is ninety-two, has moved three times in her life. She was born in a small town in the province of Shandong, China, and, when she was twenty-three, she took a boat to Shanghai. When she was sixty-three, she moved to Sydney, Australia—where I was born—and then, when she was eighty-five, came with me and my mother to New York. There are a few similarities across these places: all three are port cities—populous, but not the capital—that grew fat off the trade of an eastern coast. Another constant in her life, at least in the past twenty or so years, has been the Austrian police-procedural television show “Inspector Rex,” which is about a crime-fighting dog.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Rex” débuted in 1994, the year I was born, and ran for eighteen seasons over the course of twenty-one years. A standard episode takes forty-five minutes and follows the titular dog, Rex, who is part of a crack homicide unit in Vienna. (The show was originally filmed in German.) Rex&#39;s colleagues include a lead detective who changes every three to four seasons; an earnest deputy; and a bumbling third guy who stays at the station. Supposedly a family program, the show blends an earnest nineties sensibility—there is a running joke in which Rex finds new ways to steal ham rolls from one of the lesser detectives—with an occasionally macabre flourish. People are killed with poisons, stabbed, thrown from the balcony of a museum, hit over the head with a large wrench. In one typical episode, the lead detective, Moser, investigates a murder in which a woman has been hypnotized into stabbing her boyfriend. As the villain is about to kill Moser with a motorbike, Rex launches out of a bush and tackles him.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;My grandmother is a big fan of the show, and many people around the world evidently share her disposition. It was immensely popular in its native Austria and Germany, across Europe, and in Australia, where it ran during prime time on the Special Broadcasting Service, a government-funded multicultural broadcaster. When “Rex” was cancelled by its Austrian channel after ten years, in 2004, the Italian national broadcaster, &lt;em >;RAI&lt;/em>;, bought the rights and moved Rex to Rome, such was the nation&#39;s love for the dog. From the streets of Vienna, he now frolicked along the Fountain of Neptune, in the Piazza Navona, with a handsome new Italian human partner named Fabbri. The show has also been remade in Poland (“Komisarz Alex”), Portugal (“Inspetor Max”), Lithuania (“Inspektorius Mažylis”), Slovakia (“Rex”), and Canada (“Hudson &amp;amp; Rex”).&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;This level of intercontinental popularity can be attributed to two factors. One is the show&#39;s reliable villain-of-the-week structure. The second is its star—a stately German shepherd who is clearly and visibly intelligent in a way that transcends language. My school years in Australia coincided with a kind of Rex-mania. I remembered news stories about how pet owners would put the show on for their dogs, who would bark and gleefully wag their tails at the screen. Pope Benedict XVI, who was German, was reportedly a fan, and watched it with his brother Georg, who claimed to be friends with a man from the Bavarian city of Regensburg who owned one of the dogs that played Rex. We didn&#39;t have a dog. In our house, the show was for my grandmother and for me. My mother raised me alone, and sometimes worked late. Looking after me became my grandmother&#39;s responsibility, and, in a way, vice versa. Many nights, we would watch “Rex” together while we waited for my mother to come home.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;For an elderly woman originally from Shandong, then naturalized in Shanghai, a mostly kinetic show in German about a charismatic, industrious dog was perfect. Unlike me, she couldn&#39;t read the English subtitles. But nobody was under any illusion that that mattered. In Rex, my grandmother and I had a being of pure legibility, one who wordlessly told us exactly what he was doing. (The plots, of course, were finagled so that each case could be solved by something a dog could do.) My grandmother watched with a rather flat affect—the humans sparked very little reaction from her, but when the dog appeared she would always point and make sure I was watching, and remark to me or herself about how smart dogs are.&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;There is a phrase we like to say to each other when we watch “Inspector Rex.” It&#39;s a construction in Shanghainese, whose elegance and full power can only be glimpsingly translated into English. It&#39;s four words, or, more accurately, characters. Written in simplified Chinese, it is 狗出来了; transcribed phonetically, in our accent, it&#39;s something like &lt;em>;Gou tse leh le&lt;/em>;. Literally, it means “The dog [&lt;em>;gou&lt;/em>;] has come out [&lt;em>;tse leh le&lt;/em>;].” Parsed into more fluid English, you&#39;d say, “The dog is here,” or, most perfectly, something like “There he is.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;What people would consider the default language of China, Standard Chinese‚ which English speakers colloquially call Mandarin—was only made official in the nineteen-fifties. (Standard Chinese is based on Mandarin, but the two are not the same.) Shanghainese, which is the language that my family speaks at home, is often called a dialect. There is a common misconception that Mandarin and Cantonese are the only two stars in the Chinese language—and that all people speak one or the other. But the history of China is really that of hundreds of languages: Shanghainese and other regional “dialects,” like Fujianese, Hokkien, and Hunanese, are hundreds of years old, have millions of speakers, and developed independently of and even before Standard Chinese, which is based on the dialect of Northern China, where Beijing is situated.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Linguists have tried to draw hard boundaries around what is and isn&#39;t a dialect, but nobody can. Looking at the constituent parts—speech, intelligibility—many “dialects” have the same level of similarity or difference with one another as “languages” do. In 1945, the sociolinguist Max Weinreich popularized the saying that “a language is a dialect with an army and a navy.” Which is to say, a “dialect” becomes a language when it is spoken by the people in power.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;During the Qing Dynasty—which lasted, shockingly, until 1911—the imperial language of China was Manchu, a now-endangered language from a region in the northeast that overlaps with modern-day Russia. Cantonese, from the city of Guangzhou, on the Pearl River Delta, in China&#39;s south, was in many ways the dominant language of the early years of global commerce and the first stages of migration into China. Now, in mainland China, Standard Chinese reigns through the hard mechanism of the modern Chinese state, post-1949, when Beijing was remade as the capital, and its local accent rolled out across the country.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Shanghainese, which is part of the Wu language group, originating near the Yangtze River, is thousands of years old. (Wu Chinese has about eighty million native speakers—more than Italian and almost as many as German—making it one of the most spoken native languages in the world.) It&#39;s common for people in China to still speak their local language with family and friends, but to learn Standard Chinese at school, hear it on TV, and speak it at work. Satellite TV channels in China are banned, by law, from broadcasting in local dialects; ethnic minorities, including the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-uyghurs-forced-to-process-the-worlds-fish&quot;>;Uyghurs&lt;/a>;, are made to learn Standard Chinese. In Hong Kong, Cantonese has become a de-facto language of protest, especially during the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/12/16/hong-kongs-protest-movement-and-the-fight-for-the-citys-soul&quot;>;2019 pro-democracy demonstrations&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Neither Shanghainese nor Standard Chinese is my grandmother&#39;s original language; she grew up speaking the Shandong dialect. But in our family we have always spoken to one another in Shanghainese, which is my mother&#39;s first language, the bridge. My grandmother learned it when she moved to Shanghai as a young woman; I learned it as a child in Sydney. This is undoubtedly a case of confirmation bias, but I find it wonderfully easy to speak. It is slangy and pliable, lacks as rigid a tone structure as other Chinese languages, and has sounds that are forgiving and easy to make. There is a Chinese idiom about how soft Shanghainese sounds on the ear: people call it “the tender speech of Wu.” Sometimes, to me, it sounds more similar to Korean than to Standard Chinese—the Korean island of Jeju is only three hundred miles away—lower, open vowels, a rapid firing of soft consonants.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Many people my grandmother&#39;s age and older struggle to speak Standard Chinese. (The countrywide push to make it the national language only happened midway through the twentieth century, later than the country&#39;s adoption of the radio.) My grandmother can, but does so with an intense northern accent, which to a lot of younger Chinese-born people makes it impenetrable. She was on the phone recently, with a health-insurance company. They patched a translator onto the line. But something as simple as her address sounds so heavily different that the translator couldn&#39;t understand. “I&#39;m sorry, she has a very strong accent,” the translator said to the phone operator. My mother and I have to keep reminding my grandmother to speak &lt;em>;putonghua&lt;/em>;, the Chinese name for Standard Chinese, which means the common tongue.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;To say, then, in English, “There he is,” is good—but still incomplete. The emergence of this Austrian (and later Italian) dog lives, to me, in Shanghainese. Translators butt up against this problem all the time: how to replicate the elegance of a phrase in one language to another. In Shanghainese, the fact that &lt;em>;gou&lt;/em>; (“dog”) comes first is perfect. (Articles are rarely used in Chinese.) Linguistically, &lt;em>;Gou tse leh le&lt;/em>; replicates the sensation of how the &lt;em>;gou tse leh le&lt;/em>;. That -&lt;em>;ou&lt;/em>; sounds, to me, like the first second of a bark—the dog is there, sticking his nose out before the verb, the preposition. And &lt;em>;tse leh le&lt;/em>; is a figurative coming-out, existing beyond time markers, nothing as stodgy as “he has emerged.” (Chinese verbs do not have tenses, let alone the past perfect.) What is he coming out from? It&#39;s a bit metaphysical—the dog is emerging from the absence of dog. It&#39;s like what you&#39;d say when the curtain rises and the dancers pour out, something more like “voilà!”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I love this—the things formed in the unique nooks of a language. It&#39;s not like the words for “dog” or “come out” don&#39;t exist in English—it&#39;s that the grammar itself, or the rules of word order, don&#39;t let you express it to the same effect. Roland Kelts once noted in this magazine, on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/lost-in-translation&quot;>;the difficulty of translating Haruki Murakami&lt;/a>;, that Japanese frequently allows for sentences not to have subjects, giving many of Murakami&#39;s lines a wonderful vagueness that is crushed in English; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/a-lifetime-of-lessons-in-mrs-dalloway&quot;>;Virginia Woolf&lt;/a>; once wrote that it is “useless . 。 。 to read Greek in translation,” because “we can never hope to get the whole fling of a sentence” the same.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;There are other blunt, beautiful phrases my grandmother says to me, in Shanghainese, that are hard to say to others. She often says something that means, in its bare bones, that she only loves three people: me, my mother, and my aunt. My Shanghainese is mostly confined to the domestic monosyllabism of childhood—asking whether she has eaten or what to watch on TV, telling her that I love her. When asked by friends how my grandmother spends her days, I often feel a bit embarrassed to relay the truth—that she watches a TV show about a dog in a language she can&#39;t understand. I feel even more embarrassed that my grandmother and I, even though we live together and talk every day, are unable to hold a moderately complex conversation.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In April, 2020, early in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tag/coronavirus&quot;>;pandemic&lt;/a>;, my grandmother contracted &lt;em >;COVID&lt;/em>;-19. She had to go to the hospital alone. They had no translator for her, to tell her what was happening and where she was going. They wrote her name down wrong in the computer—that classic mixup of Chinese last name and first name—which meant she was not searchable for many hours. When I finally got her on the hospital phone, I could not properly tell her how long, or why, she had to be there. I did not know how to say “trust,” which broke my heart. &lt;em >;COVID&lt;/em>; was a new disease, and I did not know how to explain it in Chinese, either. Eventually, one doctor, who spoke Chinese, told her she had a disease in her lungs. Her symptoms were mild and we didn&#39;t want to worry her. We were lucky, and she recovered.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;People born now in mainland China increasingly do not speak their regional language. In her old age, and her more solitary life, my grandmother has slipped more and more into Shanghainese. Her Chinese is peppered with it; she is even forgetting her original Shandong dialect. I am learning Standard Chinese, but when I practice with her, she often doesn&#39;t understand. In a way, this means the two of us, with our inability to communicate in more common tongues, have a whole language that we use mostly to speak to each other. The category of things we both understand—our TV shows, our overlapping Shanghainese—is narrow, but deep.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;A few years ago, we took in a dog, a foster greyhound with a sweet disposition. My grandmother loved him. She would often greet him, and me, with a full-mouthed pantomime frown, and tell me almost instantly, before saying hello or anything else, that the dog was hungry, and that I should feed him. This would happen, of course, regardless of when he had last eaten. I was surprised to be hit with this full-bore cannon of doting and guilt, a treatment I thought she reserved for my mother, not me.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;My grandmother spoke to the dog in Shanghainese. She told him, looking directly into his brown eyes, that she loved him. And, as we scuttled around the house trying to open doors without letting the dog out, we got to say our phrase—&lt;em>;gou tse leh le&lt;/em>;—for real this time. ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 28 Oct 2023 19:06:01 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[A Student Handbook for the School from Your Nightmares]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.newyorker.com/humor/daily-shouts/a-student-handbook-for-the-school-from-your-nightmares]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-28T10:00:00.000Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653a9d01763674b88ec88c95/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Shouts-Hakala-Student-Nightmares.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;article >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attribute-verso-pattern=&quot;article-body&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;ArticlePageChunks&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;School Mission&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The mission of this nightmare school is to challenge students and prepare them for a role in a society in which everything is also terrible.

First, House Republicans elevated Representative Mike Johnson of Louisiana, who was formerly almost unknown on the national level, to be Speaker of the House. Johnson is a creationist and a climate-change denier, and he was a key figure in the effort to keep Trump in power—which certainly helped in his bid for leadership this week. On the other hand, as some of the former President&#39;s most loyal associates have faced the threat of jail time in Georgia, they have renounced their false election theories. “You have to lie about the election to rise in power if you&#39;re a Republican in the House,” the staff writer &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/contributors/jane-mayer&quot;>;Jane Mayer&lt;/a>; says, “but when you face potential sentencing in a court yourself, the truth finally comes out.” Mayer joins the &lt;em>;New Yorker&lt;/em>; staff writers &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/contributors/susan-b-glasser&quot;>;Susan B. Glasser&lt;/a>; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/contributors/evan-osnos&quot;>;Evan Osnos&lt;/a>; to look at the current dynamics of election denialism in Republican politics.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;ldrf9s&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;z7iv3c&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 28 Oct 2023 09:06:01 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[An International Student on Lockdown During the Shooting in Lewiston, Maine]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.newyorker.com/news/as-told-to/an-international-student-on-lockdown-during-the-shooting-in-lewiston-maine]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-27T19:51:39.311Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653bd425d67d6e6f5e40c340/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Lasarte-Bates%20College%20Student.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;article >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attribute-verso-pattern=&quot;article-body&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;ArticlePageChunks&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Alan Wang, a twenty-one-year-old from the Henan Province of central China, had never seen a gun before he moved to the United States—not even one attached to a police officer.当他离开家去缅因州刘易斯顿的一所文科学校贝茨学院上学时，他的祖母警告他周末不要出去；他的祖母警告他周末不要出去。她一直在阅读有关美国大规模枪击事件增加的报道，并担心他会被枪杀。 He told her that the US was safe, and that Chinese state media was exaggerating the gun-violence problem to make America look bad.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Two days ago, the worst mass shooting in Maine&#39;s history—and the deadliest in the United States this year—occurred in Lewiston, when a gunman opened fire at a local bowling alley, and then a bar, killing eighteen people and injuring thirteen more.枪击事件距离贝茨校园仅几英里，学校与安德罗斯科金县其他地区一起进入封锁状态。嫌疑人罗伯特·卡德（Robert Card）尚未被捕，当地和州警察、联邦特工和海岸警卫队参与的搜捕行动正在进行中。 As of Friday afternoon, county residents and Bates students are still sheltering in place.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Wang, a political-science major, who is now a senior, was at a campus political forum when the lockdown orders came in. He told me about his experience as an international student encountering a uniquely American phenomenon—a mass-shooter alert. His account has been condensed and edited.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“I learned about the shooting around 8 &lt;em >;PM&lt;/em>; on Wednesday.我正前往佩滕吉尔大厅，这是我们最大的学术建筑之一。在地下室，贝茨学院的民主党人计划接待一些当地的民主党候选人，参加即将举行的市长、学校委员会和市议会选举。计划是让候选人来到学校并与学生交谈。 I had been planning to ask the mayor some questions about gun violence, because I saw him address the issue in an &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://thebatesstudent.com/24771/news/a-conversation-with-lewiston-mayor-carl-sheline/&quot;

as part of their first-year orientation forms.)&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Last night, I was preparing to walk outside the academic building, feeling like the alert was no big deal, when American students stopped me and told me to stay indoors.我意识到在这种情况下我所受的教育和训练是多么不足。作为一名国际学生，我从未被教导过正确的反应，即逃跑、躲藏和战斗。直到昨晚我才知道这一点。 When I saw how my American peers reacted and how I reacted, the contrast just blows my mind.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“After deciding to go to college in the US, people in China would say to me, &#39;Why are you risking your life going to this country?&#39;美国在中国媒体的印象中是一个疯狂的地方，每天都有大规模枪击事件，政府几乎没有控制和干预。我总是告诉人们‘不，这只是一种刻板印象和误解，你知道吗？我很好。我的生命没有危险。我们很安全。别再担心我了。别担心我去一个看起来不安全的国家，因为根据个人经验，那里是安全的。”但现在，我不太确定了。” ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot;

&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;On the morning of October 7th, as Hamas militants paraglided over Israel&#39;s razor-wire fence to carry out a mass killing, Yahav Winner was waking up to his newborn daughter, Shaya, in his family&#39;s home, in an idyllic desert community with fields of sunflowers and rows of palm trees. Winner and his wife, Shaylee Atary, both filmmakers, had started their family where Winner grew up, in the Kfar Aza kibbutz, a village of some seven hundred residents, just a few kilometres from the border that separates Israel and Gaza. That morning, she described, seventy &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/israels-calamity-and-after&quot;>;Hamas militants&lt;/a>; surrounded Winner and Atary&#39;s home. When a Hamas fighter&#39;s arm burst through their bedroom window, Winner seemed to grasp that the entire family couldn&#39;t survive. He fought off the intruders, and flashed a hand signal for his wife to flee. Atary, who has a disability that affects her left leg, limped out the door with their sleeping daughter in her arms. Outside in a courtyard, the militants were going from house to house—Atary could hear the muffled whistles of gunshots through silencers. She found refuge in a garden shed, and hid among empty pots and topsoil. After what seemed like an hour, her sleeping baby woke and began to cry. Sucking on Atary&#39;s pinky didn&#39;t quiet the infant. So Atary ran again, trying each house, until she found refuge for herself and Shaya in the safe room of some family friends. When they emerged, twenty-seven hours later, Atary found the village in ruins, and her husband missing. She hoped that he was among the more than two hundred hostages taken by Hamas to Gaza. She found out while being interviewed on live TV that he had, in fact, been killed. “He gave his life, I feel, to love me,” Atary told me. “I&#39;ll miss him for the rest of my life.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The violence of the Israel-Palestine conflict marked Winner&#39;s life early. During a previous round of fighting, in 2008, when Winner was in his twenties, he was working in the garden with his best friend&#39;s father when a Hamas-fired rocket landed and blew the other man to pieces. Atary says the experience shaped Winner&#39;s life: “His soul broke,” Atary told me, when we spoke. “His trauma started there.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Trauma became the preoccupation of his work. It&#39;s at the center of Winner&#39;s final film, “The Boy,” a hauntingly beautiful short that captures the dissonance of life along the Israel-Gaza border. The film&#39;s main character, Barak, a young adult in Kfar Aza, is unable to ignore the reality of life for his Palestinian neighbors. While his father, Avinoam, works in the fields, Barak is fixated on the distant echo of shooting in Gaza. As he intensely watches the news about the latest round of violence, his aloof brother badgers him to change the channel to a reality show: “ &#39;Ninja&#39; &#39;s on, I don&#39;t want to watch your crap.” Barak is clearheaded about the tragic context of his surroundings. That clarity takes a toll; we see him feel anxious, and sometimes clash with family members. Barak offers a poignant example of recognizing the humanity of others. “The main character is very heartbroken about the fact that he knows people are like him on the other side of the fence,” Atary said, of her husband&#39;s film.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Atary and Winner met thirteen years ago, as creative collaborators in Tel Aviv, where both were part of the tight-knit arts scene. Much like his character, Winner struggled with PTSD And, yet, friends describe him as open, generous, and funny—“a true sweetheart,” as one old colleague put it. The couple decided to start a family together. Kfar Aza, with its communal living, old-fashioned atmosphere, and beautiful natural surroundings, offered an oasis—even with the occasional rocket fire. “Our doors are always open,” Atary said. “This is how much we felt community.” They hoped the stories they created together there could make the political situation a little better.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Israel&#39;s filmmakers have long been a moral conscience for the country. Films like “The Gatekeepers” and “5 Broken Cameras” exposed global audiences to the harsh reality that Palestinians face under occupation, and many such films were supported by a state ministry, in what some considered to be a sign of the country&#39;s democratic strength. Under the now entrenched power of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/netanyahus-government-takes-a-turn-toward-theocracy&quot;>;Netanyahu&#39;s right-wing Likud government&lt;/a>;, however, public funds for projects deemed to be pro-Palestinian have been harder to find, and many directors have gravitated toward more apolitical themes.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In “The Boy,” Winner offers a commentary on life along that Israel-Gaza border that&#39;s subtle but unflinching. Halfway through the film, an alarm roars, “RED ALERT,” to warn of an incoming rocket from Gaza. The kibbutz residents, familiar with this aspect of life on the border, rush to the nearest bomb shelter. Barak stays put in the cafeteria. He is grappling with an idea that his fellow community members would rather ignore: as long as the two million residents of nearby Gaza aren&#39;t able to live in safety, too, then life can come crashing down with one errant rocket.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Samuel Maoz, one of Israel&#39;s most celebrated directors, was a mentor of Winner, and his yellow-glazed films, like “Lebanon,” clearly inspired the younger director&#39;s work. I spoke to Maoz after he returned home from Winner&#39;s funeral, which was delayed by a week because of the many bodies that had to be identified and buried. Maoz shuffled through their old texts on WhatsApp and noticed that his last message checking in on Winner was never received. “I guess he was already dead,” Maoz said with a sigh. Winner had gone to Maoz for guidance early in the development of “The Boy,” but the elder director said that he had learned from Winner, too. “Working with [Yahav] made me a better director,” said Maoz, who has won top prizes at some of the world&#39;s major film festivals. “All that remains now is his direct, honest, naïve, and bare look—floating in the air.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Some traces do remain. When he died, Winner was in production on his début feature film, this one starring himself and his wife, and set in his beloved Kfar Aza. Half of the film&#39;s subjects are now dead. In one scene, Winner kisses his then pregnant wife, as she lies on their bed and ponders their life ahead as a family. “She&#39;s grown,” Winner says, stroking Atary&#39;s belly. In that same room several months later, Winner would fight to save their lives.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“I hope I will see the light,” Atary said, reflecting on their decade creating art together. “We always, always in life try to look for the little light.”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 27 Oct 2023 21:06:01 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Some Lasting Lessons from a Dramatic Week at Trump’s Civil Trial]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/some-lasting-lessons-from-a-dramatic-week-at-trumps-civil-trial]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-27T10:00:00.000Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653ad760150b105565237111/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/cassidy-trump%20and%20cohen.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;article >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attribute-verso-pattern=&quot;article-body&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;ArticlePageChunks&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;On Thursday morning, a day after being fined ten thousand dollars for violating a gag order at his New York civil trial, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tag/donald-trump&quot;>;Donald Trump&lt;/a>; was back home in Florida doing precisely what got him sanctioned in the first place: ranting away on social media. He stated that the judge who fined him, Arthur F. Engoron, “HAS GONE CRAZY IN HIS HATRED OF &#39;TRUMP.&#39; ” And he gloated about his lawyers tripping up his nemesis Michael Cohen on the witness stand, commenting, “It was like watching the end of the best Petty Mason episode, where the defendant breaks down and cries, &#39;Yes, I did it, I did it, I did it.&#39; ”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The actual defendants in the case are Trump, two of his sons, and a pair of former senior executives in the Trump Organization. In a pretrial judgment late last month, Engoron decided the key issue in the case, ruling that the defendants committed fraud by inflating the value of Trump&#39;s properties on financial-disclosure forms that they submitted to banks and other institutions. The trial, now nearing the end of its fourth week, is proceeding on additional counts and possible penalties, for which Letitia James, the New York attorney general, is seeking a fine of up to two hundred and fifty million dollars and a lifetime ban on Trump serving as an officer or director of any business in New York. Wednesday&#39;s proceedings, which featured a punishing cross-examination of Cohen by Trump&#39;s lawyers, made for the most dramatic day of the trial so far. With the former President also facing much more consequential criminal trials,, it also conveyed three larger lessons for the months ahead.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The most important one is that Trump is utterly incorrigible. As his other cases proceed, he will most certainly continue to treat the courts, and the entire legal process, with disdain and contempt until—and unless—someone imposes a sanction on him that is a lot stiffer than fines of five thousand or ten thousand dollars.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Last week, Engoron issued Trump a five-thousand-dollar fine for failing to remove a social-media post that showed a picture of one of Engoron&#39;s law clerks with Chuck Schumer and claimed that she was the “girlfriend” of the Senate Minority Leader. The post violated a previous order from Engoron not to post or speak publicly about the clerk, who sits alongside him on the bench, or other court staff. (Engoron himself remains fair game—just not the people who work for him.) Apparently oblivious to the prior fine as he stood outside the courtroom on Wednesday, Trump stopped at the crowded media pen and described Engoron as “a very partisan judge, with a person who&#39;s very partisan sitting alongside of him, perhaps even much more partisan than he is”—presumably referring to the law clerk again.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Engoron addressed Trump&#39;s statement as soon as he got to the bench. Noting the “overheated environment” in which the proceeding was taking place, he said, “I don&#39;t want anyone killed.” He also asked Trump&#39;s lawyers why he shouldn&#39;t impose “severe sanctions for this blatant, dangerous disavowal of a court order.” Trump&#39;s lead attorney, Chris Kise, insisted, with a straight face, that Trump had been referring to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tag/michael-cohen&quot;>;Michael Cohen&lt;/a>;, a testifying witness that day, rather than the law clerk. Engoron pointed out that Cohen, unlike the clerk, wasn&#39;t sitting directly alongside him, but he said that he&#39;d take the matter under advisement.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;After a lunch break, Engoron raised the issue again and called Trump himself to the witness stand. After the former President was sworn in, the judge asked him whom he had been referring to in his statement. “You and Cohen,” Trump replied. Engoron wasn&#39;t buying it. After a bit more back-and-forth about the previous social-media post, he dismissed Trump, who walked quietly back to the defense table. Engoran then said, “The witness is not credible,” and imposed a ten-thousand-dollar fine, to be paid within thirty days. At least for now, that was that. Trump may not be nearly as rich as he claims, but he can surely afford ten grand (or his campaign donors can).&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;The second lesson of the day is specifically for prosecutors: don&#39;t put very much faith in Michael Cohen. On Tuesday, Cohen told the court about how Trump would “direct” him and Allen Weisselberg, the former chief financial officer of the Trump Organization, to rework valuations on a Trump net-worth statement until they reached an arbitrary level that Trump had decided on—say, six billion dollars. After Cohen and Weisselberg had carried out this task, they would return to Trump, “demonstrating that we achieved—or close to—the number he was seeking,” Cohen testified.&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;On Wednesday, under aggressive questioning from two Trump lawyers, Alina Habba and Cliff Robert, Cohen appeared to wilt. Habba, after taking the former fixer through some of the glowing things he told the media about Trump before 2018—“He&#39;s going to be an amazing President,” “The family is fantastic”—got him to say that he had significant animosity toward Trump, that he had “made a career” out of criticizing him, and that he had lied under oath in congressional testimony in February, 2019, when he said that Trump didn&#39;t order him to inflate the value of his assets. After Roberts took over from Habba, Cohen confirmed that he lied on another occasion: to a federal judge, in his December, 2018, sentencing hearing. Then he disavowed his statement to Habba that he had lied in his congressional testimony. “So Mr. Trump never asked you to inflate the numbers on his financial l statement,” Robert said. “Correct,” Cohen replied, as Trump and Habba threw up their arms.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Under redirection from Colleen Faherty, a lawyer for the New York attorney general&#39;s office, Cohen sought to resolve his clashing statements. Trump “did not specifically state, &#39;Michael, go inflate the numbers,&#39; ” Cohen said. “Donald Trump speaks like a Mob boss, and what he does is he tells you what he wants without specifically telling you. So when he said to me, &#39;I&#39;m worth more than five million. I&#39;m actually worth maybe six, maybe seven, could be eight,&#39; we understood what he wanted.” This was a perfectly reasonable explanation, and it jibes with everything we know about Trump, who also avoids sending incriminating e-mails and written notes. But it&#39;s never good for a prosecution when one of its witnesses appears to flip-flop or says that he lied to another judge. After Wednesday&#39;s session, James evidently felt a bit of cleanup was necessary. Speaking to reporters outside the courthouse, she said that it was “important to know that Michael Cohen is not the main witness.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The final lesson from the Trump-Cohen showdown is one that has been clear from the start of this proceeding, and from Trump&#39;s pretrial comments in his other cases. As he confronts his accusers, Trump&#39;s legal tactics are secondary to his political strategy of discrediting the court and the prosecution in the eyes of his supporters. Only he knows his ultimate goals. But they seem to include raising doubts in advance about any guilty verdicts and planting the idea that such verdicts would be so outrageous that they would lead to unrest and violence. Almost certainly, he&#39;s also trying to prepare the ground for a self-pardon in the event of a conviction on the federal charges against him if he gets reëlected.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;As he pursues these ends, Trump&#39;s court appearances are primarily media events, where he delivers his message to Trump-supporting platforms that amplify it and whip up the &lt;em >;MAGA&lt;/em>; faithful. This couldn&#39;t have been clearer when, after blithely defying Engoron&#39;s gag order, he rose from his seat and walked out of the courtroom after Engoron rejected a request from his lawyers to dismiss the case because of Cohen&#39;s testimony. With Trump absent, Engoron explained that there was “no way, no how” he was going to issue such a ruling because of an “arguably equivocal statement” from a single witness that he didn&#39;t consider key. “There&#39;s enough evidence to fill this courtroom,” Engoron said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Of course, the judge&#39;s statement didn&#39;t get nearly as much publicity as Trump “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2023/10/25/trump-courtroom-new-york-trial-cohen-vpx.cnn&quot;>;storming out of court&lt;/a>;,” which is how many media outlets described Trump&#39;s abrupt exit from the courtroom. Directly outside, he stopped to tell the media pen, falsely, that Cohen had “admitted that we won the trial.” It was a carefully staged bit of theatre, but the ex-President storming out of his own trial is a better story. ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;gopcj9&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;5q2ng9&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 27 Oct 2023 19:06:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Marie NDiaye’s Drama of Exclusion and Revenge]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.newyorker.com/books/under-review/marie-ndiayes-drama-of-exclusion-and-revenge]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-27T10:00:00.000Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6536d19991891e12fe97d418/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Wilson-Vengeance-Is_mine.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;article >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attribute-verso-pattern=&quot;article-body&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;ArticlePageChunks&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;On January 5, 2019, a group of people began breaking down the front door of a ministry building on the Rue de Grenelle in central Paris. Security rushed the government spokesperson at the time, Benjamin Griveaux, out through a side exit soon after the intruders took apart the wooden entrance using a commandeered forklift. Their use of heavy machinery had a touch of symbolism. Among the perpetrators were members of France&#39;s &lt;em>;gilets jaunes&lt;/em>; (“yellow vest”) movement, named for the high-visibility vests typically worn by construction workers. Demonstrators had donned the reflective neon garments in a show of working-class pride. January 5th had marked the eighth week of protests against &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/07/01/can-emmanuel-macron-stem-the-populist-tide&quot;>;Emmanuel Macron&lt;/a>;&#39;s economic policies; across the country that day, fifty thousand &lt;em>;gilets jaunes&lt;/em>; took to the streets, facing off against tear gas, water cannons, and other dispersal tactics employed by French riot police. Griveaux, who had earlier called the idea of meeting the protesters&#39; demands “unthinkable,” said on French television about the break-in, “It wasn&#39;t me who was attacked, it was the republic.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I learned about the Rue de Grenelle incident after Googling “France, January 5, 2019,” the date on which “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Vengeance-Mine-novel-Marie-NDiaye/dp/0593534247&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Vengeance-Mine-novel-Marie-NDiaye/dp/0593534247&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Vengeance-Mine-novel-Marie-NDiaye/dp/0593534247&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;Vengeance Is Mine&lt;/a>;,” the new novel by the French writer Marie NDiaye, begins. NDiaye&#39;s latest tale, a story of class conflict embedded within a psychological thriller, is scattered with interpretive hints, clues to the crimes of contemporary French society. Though it starts with a date on the calendar, the story works like a map. The novel is dotted with coördinates around Bordeaux—neighborhood and street names—which NDiaye drops into the story like pins, marking the poor sections of the city where domestic workers live and the rich ones where they work. By the last page, I was newly fluent in the social geography of Bordeaux and its environs, well traversed in the French city&#39;s throughways of privilege and its dead ends of precarity.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The novel, translated from the French by Jordan Stump, opens on that January day—with another tense office visit. A man walks into the struggling law practice of Maître (as attorneys are known in France) Susane. He looks familiar to her, and so he should. His name is Gilles Principaux. He is known throughout Bordeaux as the husband of Marlyne Principaux, a woman in jail for drowning her three small children in a bathtub in the couple&#39;s home in the affluent suburb of Le Bouscat. The case is all over the news. Yet Maître Susane suspects she knows Gilles, who wants to hire her to defend his wife, from somewhere else. She is almost certain that he is the son of a wealthy family who once employed her mother to iron their laundry. She recalls being “enraptured” by the teen-age boy, who had invited her into his bedroom, leaving her “at once dazed at the honor and anxious to prove herself worthy of that distinction.” Why, then, upon seeing him again, thirty-two years later, “did she feel as if her life were in danger?”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;When Sasha, the protagonist of “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Good-Morning-Midnight-Jean-Rhys/dp/0393303942&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Good-Morning-Midnight-Jean-Rhys/dp/0393303942&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Good-Morning-Midnight-Jean-Rhys/dp/0393303942&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;Good Morning, Midnight&lt;/a>;,” Jean Rhys&#39;s novel from the nineteen-thirties, is offered a “beautiful” room in a hotel in Paris, she scoffs at the qualifier, thinking to herself, “Never tell the truth about this business of rooms, because it would bust the roof off everything and undermine the whole social system. All rooms are the same. All rooms have four walls, a door, a window or two, a bed, a chair and perhaps a bidet. A room is a place where you hide from the wolves outside and that&#39;s all any room is.” In “Vengeance Is Mine,” rubbing shoulders with the rich means sharing a room with wolves—in Maître Susane&#39;s case, with one wolf in particular. Her memories of what exactly happened inside that bedroom are cloudy, but she recalls the rich teen-aged boy asking her what she thought of the house, rebuking her for any slips in grammar, any inelegantly formed turns of phrase. In turn, “she pulled out all the most insightful, the cleverest, the most beguiling, the most artful things her mind contained,” trying to speak with the confidence of the class whose space she had suddenly breached.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The image of that home, in the exclusive enclave of Caudéran, has stayed with Maître Susane all her life. The visit “put a spell” on her, one that took the magic out of everything else. She had always considered her parents&#39; modest home “enchanted.” But now, at just ten, she knew that “other houses were enchanted abodes, and enchanted far more intensely.” Even when the novel hints that Gilles might have abused her, she tells herself that she must be grateful to him for teaching her to want more. She even insists that the encounter inspired her to become an attorney. “He made me understand the pleasures I enjoyed and the talent I probably had for arguing and expounding,” she thinks, recalling “the boy who&#39;d initiated her, illuminated her!” NDiaye&#39;s delicately placed exclamation point suggests that Maître Susane is shouting at herself, trying to drown out the truth.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Suspense supplies the forward motion of “Vengeance Is Mine.” We are on edge when Maître Susane turns the corners of streets and the corners of her own mind, scared of what she might remember about Gilles, or the boy who might have been Gilles. After she agrees to take Marlyne Principaux&#39;s case, the gaps in her own story start to fill in. She sees that she and her client have led parallel lives. Both are the daughters of working-class strivers who pushed their children to want to be in better rooms than the ones they were born into, leaving them to deal with the consequences of whatever happened inside. In this elegantly layered tale of social stratification, NDiaye takes us through a maze of alleyways, backstreets, and elegant foyers, until we are dizzy from trying to chart the course of upward mobility and eager for a place to rest—a way out rather than in.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;NDiaye was born in 1967, the daughter of a Senegalese father and French mother. The latter raised her alone in a housing development in a suburb south of Paris. NDiaye was a prodigy who published her first novel at seventeen, and later won France&#39;s most prestigious literary award, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/11/07/the-goncourt-prize-gets-americanized&quot;>;Prix Goncourt&lt;/a>;, in 2009, for “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Three-Strong-Women-Marie-NDiaye/dp/0307741338&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Three-Strong-Women-Marie-NDiaye/dp/0307741338&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Three-Strong-Women-Marie-NDiaye/dp/0307741338&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;Three Strong Women&lt;/a>;,” a novel of interlocking tales set between France and Senegal. Success has not made NDiaye unfeeling toward the insidious injuries of class aspiration. If anything, across her work, she examines the wounds it leaves behind. “Vengeance Is Mine” shares some architectural features with NDiaye&#39;s previous novel, “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Cheffe-Cooks-Novel-Marie-NDiaye/dp/0525520473&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Cheffe-Cooks-Novel-Marie-NDiaye/dp/0525520473&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Cheffe-Cooks-Novel-Marie-NDiaye/dp/0525520473&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;The Cheffe&lt;/a>;,” in which a young girl from a poor family of farmworkers is sent to work in the home of greedy, well-off gourmands, where she becomes a cook. Like Maître Susane, she is referred to only by her job title, a sign that she has allowed herself to be defined by, or, rather, reduced to, her prestigious line of work. The Cheffe&#39;s education in cuisine is also an education in the insatiable appetites of the rich, and in the soul-hollowing experience of feeding them.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Maître Susane hires her own cook, Sharon, a Mauritian woman who also cleans her house, but her foothold in the middle class is precarious. (She only hires Sharon, who is undocumented, “as an act of militancy.”) At forty-two, she is still, by her own assessment, a “novice” in the law. She&#39;s had only a handful of clients, including Sharon, whose immigration case she has taken pro bono, and someone who wants his name changed, believing it to be that “of a slave trader.” Though her apartment, in central Bordeaux, is “grand in its appointments” with “herringbone parquet floors, seventeenth-century fireplace, tall windows with little panes,” it is barely large enough for one person. To her parents&#39; shame, she drives an old low-cost car. Her mother, “her naïve, madly loving mother,” lives in fear that Maître Susane might fall back to what she “most dreaded and so heavy-handedly endeavored to protect her [daughter] from: the abandonment of lofty aspirations, the retreat to a mediocre way of life.” The case will bring in much needed work, but she struggles to imagine what Gilles hopes to achieve. As he leaves her office after his initial visit, he asks her, “You&#39;ll get us out of this nightmare, won&#39;t you?” What would it mean to win a case when the accused has committed infanticide against their own child? “The dead were not going to extract themselves from his bad dream and be born a second time,” she thinks.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;The Medea theme has been on NDiaye&#39;s mind. She co-wrote the screenplay for “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/01/16/an-anatomy-of-a-murder-in-saint-omer&quot;>;Saint Omer&lt;/a>;,” directed and co-written by Alice Diop. The 2022 film was based on the true story of Fabienne Kabou, a French Senegalese woman who was convicted of the murder of her daughter, after the baby was found drowned on a northern French beach in 2013. In the film, the mother&#39;s name is Laurence Coly, and she has left Senegal to pursue a philosophy degree at the Sorbonne. “I wanted to leave my mark,” she tells the judge, and, indeed, the highly publicized trial allows her to achieve the kind of notoriety she craved before her ambitions were thwarted by the racist barriers laid down by French society. Asked to explain why she killed her infant daughter, she can only tell the judge, “I hope this trial will give me the answer.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;As in “Saint Omer,” NDiaye is interested in the elusiveness of motive in crimes committed by mothers, who, she suggests, are at the mercy of an insanity-inducing chorus of voices from all corners of society telling them what to do and how to behave. When Maître Susane meets Marlyne for the first time, in the visitor&#39;s room at the prison, Marlyne talks into the recorder for several pages uninterrupted, speaking of her deceased children in an almost incomprehensible stream of consciousness:&lt;/p>;&lt;blockquote >;&lt;div >;&lt;p>;But I don&#39;t miss them, no. But I&#39;ve brought them back inside me, they&#39;re tiny, in my brain. But in my belly they were all three big babies, but they were born after term, but beautiful children, heavy and long. But my God, how substantial they were! But now they&#39;re teeny-tiny in my brain.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/blockquote>;&lt;p >;She is lucid only when she begs that Gilles not be allowed to visit her. The reason for her actions remains a mystery, likely even to herself—a disorienting mix of isolation and perfectionism inside a mind shattered by expectations and the failure to meet them. Like Laurence Coly, Marlyne Principaux was a woman of great promise. On the day she murders her children, police officers find her “wearing a voluminous T-shirt with the insignia of the Sorbonne.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Reality is a slippery thing in NDiaye&#39;s novels. In the tradition of French Surrealism, she aims to get at the truth by distancing herself from it. In “Vengeance Is Mine,” Maître Susane&#39;s psyche breaks down as she works on Marlyne&#39;s case, resulting in a narrative fractured by the trauma of its protagonist. She invents details and fills in the case file with her own projections. She expresses admiration for Marlyne&#39;s mother (who reminds her of her own) for pushing her daughters to succeed in school, but that is a detail that Susane, not the family, has provided. She imagines that Gilles chose a poor girl to marry in order to manipulate her. Marlyne, she supposes, “complied with all the spoken or unspoken injunctions of that Principaux man who&#39;d been clever enough, on that score at least (the sisters and mother told themselves, according to M&lt;sup>;e&lt;/sup>; Susane), to marry a social inferior.” There is no evidence of such scheming on Gilles&#39;s part, certainly none that will stand up in court.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;But Maître Susane&#39;s proximity to Marlyne helps her approach a solution to her own mystery: of what happened in that bedroom and why she cannot put it to rest. After some time on the case, she works up the courage to ask Gilles if the two have met before. He deflects, and accuses Maître Susane of acting strange. She replies, “I turned strange when I was ten years old.” Sometimes, NDiaye reminds us, the hardest person to extract a confession from is the victim.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In a 2021 &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.thewhitereview.org/feature/interview-with-marie-ndiaye/&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.thewhitereview.org/feature/interview-with-marie-ndiaye/&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.thewhitereview.org/feature/interview-with-marie-ndiaye/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;interview&lt;/a>; with &lt;em>;The White Review&lt;/em>;, NDiaye said she never wants her books to be “described with words ending in &#39;-ist&#39;, whether that be humanist, feminist, socialist,” adding, “I can be all of those things as a citizen, but not as an artist.” NDiaye treats politics and the material conditions it creates as forces that create unpredictable, idiosyncratic outcomes. She never lets her characters be flattened to make a point. A lesser author might stage the interplay between Marlyne and Maître Susane as the contest between a mother and a professional, the novel becoming a stage for the drama of women&#39;s choices to play out. NDiaye transforms them instead into versions of a single person—two women raised to court the rich, to do whatever it took to be let into their houses, even if it meant they would never be at home in their own skin.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Maître Susane&#39;s revenge against Gilles, and everyone like him, will be to give Marlyne a defense that indicts the ruling class and its tools of exclusion. The setting will be where it all began, the home of Gilles Principaux—but, this time, Maître Susane does not ask to be let in. The novel ends with what appears to be her opening statement at trial. In her remarks, she takes the jury into the rooms of the house where Marlyne was made a recluse. “The house confesses, the house that collaborates in the crime, it confesses, it says: I was that man&#39;s accomplice,” she declares, breaking the front door down. ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;xc2n8a&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;bbof1f&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 27 Oct 2023 19:06:02 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
