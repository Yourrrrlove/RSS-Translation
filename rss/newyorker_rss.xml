data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;网站 Stack Overflow 于 2008 年创建，是程序员互相回答问题的地方。当时，网络上高质量的技术信息很少。如果你在编码时遇到困难并且需要帮助，那么你最好的选择是旧的、分散的论坛帖子，这些帖子通常不会有任何结果。杰夫·阿特伍德 (Jeff Atwood) 和乔尔·斯波尔斯基 (Joel Spolsky) 是两位著名的软件开发人员，他们试图通过将编程问题转变为问题来解决这个问题。 A. 变成一种多人游戏。在 Stack Overflow 上——这个名字指的是程序崩溃的一种常见方式——人们可以通过发布热门问题并留下有用的答案来赚取积分。积分获得徽章和特权；用户会受到利他主义和荣耀的混合动力。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;在其成立的三年内，Stack Overflow 已经成为程序员们不可或缺的一部分，他们每天都会查阅它。 Stack Overflow 的页面主导了编程搜索结果；该网站每月的独立访问者数量超过 1600 万，而全球估计有 900 万程序员。其中几乎百分之九十是通过谷歌到达的。同样的故事也在网络上上演：这是“Web 2.0”时代，能够从人们头脑中提取知识并为他人组织起来的网站正在蓬勃发展。 Yelp、Reddit、Flickr、Goodreads、Tumblr 和 Stack Overflow 都在几年内相继推出，而当时谷歌正经历着自己非凡的发展。 Web 2.0 和 Google 相互促进：通过对这些众包知识项目建立索引，Google 可以免费获得庞大而密集的高质量信息存储库，而这些网站也可以通过 Google 获得用户和贡献者。这家搜索公司对他人数据的贪婪追求是可以被原谅的，因为它驱使用户访问它所获取的内容。在那些日子里，谷歌甚至部分地通过用户离开搜索页面的速度来衡量其成功：短暂停留意味着用户已经找到了他们正在寻找的东西。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;几乎一旦它已经开始了。大约在那个时候，谷歌推出了单一框（OneBox），这一功能可以在搜索结果上方为搜索者提供即时答案。 （搜索电影时间，您可以在单一框中找到它们，位于电影院链接列表上方。）该功能从使其成为可能的网站中吸取了流量。 Yelp 是一个很有启发性的案例：谷歌想要在“本地”市场竞争，但没有自己的餐厅和小型企业评论库。 Yelp 前公共政策负责人 Luther Lowe 最近告诉我，谷歌想尽一切办法来闯入，从许可 Yelp 的数据（Yelp 拒绝了）到鼓励自己的用户撰写评论（当时没有人愿意贡献） ）甚至直接购买 Yelp（它再次下降）。 “一旦这些策略失败——许可、竞争、购买内容——他们还剩下什么？”洛说。 “他们必须偷它。” Lowe 表示，2010 年和 2011 年，Yelp 发现 Google 在没有注明出处的情况下抓取了他们的内容。这些数据为谷歌提供了足够的动力来启动自己的评论产品。当 Yelp 公开指责谷歌窃取其数据时，该公司停止了行动，但损害已经造成。 （类似的事情发生在我曾经工作过的一家名为 Genius 的公司。我们起诉 Google 将我们数据库中的歌词复制到 OneBox 中；我通过使用撇号模式将隐藏信息嵌入到歌词中来帮助证明这种情况正在发生用莫尔斯电码拼写为“&lt;em>;RED HANDED&lt;/em>;”。Google 在第二巡回上诉法院获胜。Genius 请求最高法院审理此案，但遭到法院拒绝。）&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2012 年，Google 对 OneBox 进行了重新设计，不再强调指向外部网站的经典蓝色链接，转而支持 Google 自己的产品，例如购物和地图，以及从维基百科等网站中挑选的即时答案。这使得谷歌变得更加方便和强大，但也导致了网络用户的匮乏：比方说，搜索不会引导你进入维基百科页面，在那里你可能会加入最终做出贡献的一小部分访问者，你“直接从 Google 获取答案。 Lowe 表示，在采用新设计的搜索结果页面上，多达百分之八十的搜索者会在没有点击链接的情况下离开。许多 Web 2.0 宠儿，充斥着用户生成的内容，但访客数量却出现了下降。正是在这个时候，从某种意义上说，整个网络的质量开始下降，除了少数设法生存下来的众包知识项目之外。在搜索词中添加“reddit”或“wiki”已经成为一种不可或缺的生产力黑客，这是有原因的：在垃圾邮件发送者和内容农场泛滥成灾的空心网络中，这些已经成为真正的、知识渊博的人类最后闲逛的地方.&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;今天，大型语言模型，如 OpenAI 的 ChatGPT 和 Google 的 Bard，正在完成由 OneBox 开始的过程：它们的目标是全面吸收网络，以至于网络根本不存在。问题是这种方法是否可持续。法学硕士的智力依赖于人类写作的巨大存储库——&lt;em>;我们&lt;/em>;智力的产物。他们尤其依赖于信息密集的来源。在创建 ChatGPT 时，维基百科是 OpenAI 最重要的数据集，其次是 Reddit；大约 22% 的 GPT-3 训练数据包含链接到 Reddit 用户并由 Reddit 用户投票的网页。 ChatGPT 是一个如此优秀的程序员，以至于我认识的精明的开发人员不再使用 Stack Overflow，但正是通过研究 Stack Overflow，ChatGPT 才成为如此优秀的程序员。最近，一组研究人员估计，自 ChatGPT 推出以来，Stack Overflow 上的新帖子数量减少了 16%。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;我不是 Stack Overflow 高级用户，但我是一名程序员，十多年来我一直依赖该网站。我已经向 GitHub（一个开源代码网站）提交了项目，在 Reddit 上发布，并编辑了维基百科页面。与此同时，我多年来一直在我的网站上发布博客文章和代码。和其他人一样，我并不怀疑自己在生产 GPT 饲料；如果我知道的话，我可能会要求一些回报，甚至扣留我的捐款。今年 4 月，Reddit 首席执行官宣布，从那时起，任何需要从其网站获取大规模数据的公司都必须为此付费。 （由于此举威胁到其他非人工智能相关的应用程序，Reddit 用户的反应是“屏蔽”该网站的大片区域，强调该公司的财富依赖于无偿的社区贡献。）Stack Overflow 也发布了类似的声明。&lt;/ p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;也许众包网站会设法隔离他们的内容。但这可能并不重要。高质量的数据不一定是可再生资源，特别是如果您将其视为一个可供您使用的巨大原始油田。推动聊天机器人发挥作用的网站就像知识经济一样，使用各种货币（积分、赏金、徽章、奖金）将信息传递到最需要的地方，而聊天机器人已经在削弱这些市场的需求面，让人们感到饥饿。首先创造知识的人类引擎。当然，这对我们来说是一个问题：我们都受益于人力网络。但这对人工智能来说也是一个问题。人工智能可能只能一次占领整个网络。如果他们要继续变得更聪明，他们将需要新的知识库。它从哪里来？&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;人工智能公司已经将注意力转向一个可能的来源：聊天。任何使用 Bard 或 ChatGPT 等聊天机器人的人都在参加大规模的培训练习。事实上，免费提供这些机器人的原因之一可能是用户的数据比她的钱更有价值：您在聊天机器人文本框中输入的所有内容都是其模型的基础。此外，我们不仅仅是打字，而是粘贴——电子邮件、文档、代码、手册、合同等等。我们经常要求机器人总结这些材料，然后提出有关它的尖锐问题，进行一种精读研讨会。目前，您可以粘贴到机器人输入框中的数据量是有限的，但是我们可以一次性向它们提供的新数据量只会增加。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;不久之后，许多我们还开始将我们最私人的文档批量导入到这些模型中。聊天机器人尚未要求我授予其访问我的电子邮件档案或我的文本、日历、笔记和文件的权限。但是，为了换取一个强大的人工智能个人助理，我可能会忍不住牺牲自己的隐私。个人助理机器人可能会促使我安装一个浏览器扩展程序，该扩展程序可以跟踪我在网络上的位置，以便它可以从我的详细搜索和浏览模式中学习。 ChatGPT 及其同类产品很快将变得“多模式”，能够流畅地混合和生成文本、图像、视频和声音。大多数语言实际上是口头的而不是书面的，因此机器人会通过转录我们的会议和电话，甚至我们的日常互动来帮助我们。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;在 GPT-3.5 和 GPT-4 等模型出现之前在进入面向用户的 ChatGPT 产品时，他们使用 OpenAI 所谓的“根据人类反馈进行强化学习”（RLHF）进行调整。本质上，OpenAI 付费给人类测试人员与原始模型进行对话并评估其回复的质量；该模型从这些评级中学习，使其响应更加符合我们的意图。正是因为 RLHF，ChatGPT 才能出奇地擅长准确理解您的问题以及一个好的答案应该是什么样子。这个过程可能很昂贵。但现在 RLHF 可以通过与现实世界用户的对话，在更大的范围内免费获得。即使您没有点击聊天记录底部的“赞成”、“反对”或“这很有帮助”之类的按钮，情况也是如此。 GPT-4 非常擅长解释文字，它可以检查聊天记录并自行决定它是否为您提供了良好的服务。一个模型的对话甚至可以引导另一个模型的对话：据称，ChatGPT 的竞争对手（例如 Google Bard）通过使用在线发布的 ChatGPT 记录来完成训练。 （谷歌否认了这一点。）&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;使用聊天机器人来评估和训练其他聊天机器人，为实现将人类完全排除在循环之外的最终目标指明了道路。也许当今大型语言模型最根本的限制是它们依赖于人们生成的知识。当机器人能够为自己生成知识时，将会发生翻天覆地的变化。一种可能的途径涉及所谓的合成数据。很长一段时间以来，人工智能研究人员理所当然地填充了他们的数据集：例如，在图像上训练的神经网络可能会经历一个预处理步骤，其中每个图像被旋转九十度，或缩小，或镜像，创建每张图片有八个或十六个变体。但治疗的复杂性远不止于此。在自动驾驶汽车研究中，捕获真实世界的驾驶数据非常昂贵，因为你必须为真实的汽车配备传感器并驾​​驶它行驶；建造一辆模拟汽车并在具有模拟道路和天气条件的虚拟环境中运行它要便宜得多。现在，训练最先进的自动驾驶人工智能的典型方法是在道路上行驶数百万英里并进行数十亿次模拟。&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;4f4dj&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/podcast/political-scene/the -creator-of-chatgpt-on-the-rise-of-artificial-intelligence&quot;>;OpenAI 首席执行官 Sam Altman&lt;/a>; 表示，在法学硕士的训练中，合成数据可能很快就会取代真实数据。我们的想法是让一个类似 GPT 的模型生成文档、对话以及对这些对话如何进行的评估，然后让另一个模型（可能只是第一个模型的副本）来摄取它们。希望进入类似于&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/science/elements/how-the-artificial-intelligence-program-alphazero-mastered-its-games&quot;>;的训练制度人工智能专为国际象棋和围棋等游戏而设计，这些游戏主要通过“自我对弈”来学习。在训练的每一步中，人工智能都会通过与完全平等的对手进行比赛来学习一些关于游戏的知识；根据这次经验，它只改进了一点点，然后机器人的稍微好一点的版本与它稍微好一点的自我相比较，并再次改进。它不断上升。通过与完美匹配的对手（本身）进行比赛，人工智能甚至可以进入游戏深处的有趣位置，以人类从未做过的方式在现有知识的前沿探索游戏世界。这一策略非常有效：玩游戏的人工智能 AlphaZero 在除了国际象棋规则之外一无所知的情况下开始训练，四个小时后，它超越了有史以来的所有玩家，无论是人类还是机器。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;奥特曼看好合成数据，但也有理由持怀疑态度，其中一个显而易见的事实是，无论你多么聪明，你都无法通过回顾已知的知识来了解世界的新事实。在最近的一项研究中，研究人员使用生成的合成图像训练了人工智能模型；然后他们使用生成的模型来生成更多的训练数据。每一代模型的质量实际上都会下降。只有当再次引入新鲜、真实的图像时，情况才会有所改善。按理说，有些任务比其他任务更适合合成数据：国际象棋和围棋需要智力，但发生在规则永远不会改变的封闭世界中。致力于人工智能“课程设计”的研究人员试图找出如何用一些刚刚达到其能力极限的任务来挑战他们的系统，就像一个好的教练那样；在国际象棋和围棋中，自我对弈可以实现这种渐进式的改进。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;但人工智能如何通过“自我对弈”获得新想法或更微妙的欣赏似乎还不太清楚。语言。人类不会仅仅通过阅读自己的作品，或者纯粹通过练习写我们发现越来越有趣的句子来成为更好的作家。我们的“课程”涉及其他智慧的成果和现实世界经验的积累。这个课程是精心设计的，当然是老师们精心设计的，也是我们自己精心设计的。当我们寻求知识时，我们不会盲目地消耗越来越大的数据集。相反，我们有我们想知道的事情。泰勒·贝克 (Taylor Beck)，一位神经科学家出身的教师，曾经向我指出，人工智能可能是你发现真正无动机学习的唯一环境：机器只是摄取大量无差别的文本，而它并不关心其中的任何内容。相比之下，自然智力几乎总是伴随着某种需求，或者至少是一个目标——无论是寻找快乐的幼儿，还是因为“想要”吃东西而执行复杂计算来测量快乐的大肠杆菌。其环境中的化学梯度。在这种智力观中，驱动力是首要的。像 ChatGPT 这样的法学硕士没有驱动器之类的东西；他们只是吸收和综合信息。在这方面，它们与 AlphaZero 等寻求胜利的系统有着根本的不同。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;当法学硕士开始显得好奇或无聊时，人工智能的重大飞跃可能就会到来。好奇心和无聊听起来像是属于有机思维，但它们在人工智能中可能是这样产生的。一般来说，今天的聊天机器人有一种自信地编造东西的倾向，或者正如一些研究人员所说，“产生幻觉”。这些幻觉的根源在于无法反省：人工智能不知道自己在做什么，也不知道自己在做什么。当研究人员开始解决让模型表达自信并引用消息来源的问题时，他们不仅会让聊天机器人变得更加可信，还将让它们具备基本的自我认知。人工智能将能够从大量自己的聊天记录中观察到它在某个特定区域容易产生幻觉；让这种趋势引导其吸收进一步的训练数据是很自然的。该模型将把自己引导到涉及它最不了解的主题的来源——最基本形式的好奇心。&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;如果找不到正确类型的训练数据，聊天机器人可能会请求它。我想象与 ChatGPT 未来版本的对话，在一段时间不活动后，它开始问我问题。也许，在观察了我自己的问题和后续行动之后，它会对我所知道的事情产生一个想法。 “你是一名程序员和作家，不是吗？”它可能会对我说。当然，我会回应。 “我是这么想的！我正在努力提高技术写作水平。我想知道你能否帮我决定以下哪句话最好？”这样的人工智能可能会向我在建筑公司工作的姐姐询问当地木材市场的情况；它可以询问我从事癌症研究的医生朋友，他是否可以澄清最近的《自然》论文中的某些内容。这样的系统就像 Stack Overflow、维基百科和 Reddit 的结合体，只不过知识不是被存放在公共领域，而是在一个不断成长的天才的头脑中私下积累。观察网络以这种方式崩溃成一个巨大的聊天机器人有点像观察星系旋入黑洞。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;如果一台好奇的机器得到其设计者的充分授权，它可能不仅仅是一个聊天机器人。它不仅可以在自己的聊天界面中向我们提问，还可以向人们发送电子邮件，或者使用语音合成和识别技术来打电话给他们，就像记者那样。如果它足够聪明，它可能会写一篇论文，提出一项新的物理实验，并将其提交给物理学家，要求他们执行。如今，人工智能已经使用 API（应用程序编程接口）与控制现实世界机械的计算机系统进行交互。也许好奇的人工智能可以在机器人控制的生物实验室中申请空间。在过去的几年里，我们已经从一个人工智能仅仅重新包装人类知识的世界发展到了一个综合和巩固人类知识的世界。在学会从我们身上汲取新知识后，它可以开始产生一些自己的知识。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;这一切的可怕之处在于它所代表的权力的巨大集中。早在 20 世纪 20 年代初期，当谷歌考虑在图书馆终端免费提供谷歌图书中的每一本绝版图书时，该公司就受到了观察家的批评，他们认为谷歌正在寻求成为世界图书的唯一管理者。文学。但巴德和 ChatGPT 让 Google 图书的雄心壮志显得有些古怪。这些模型正在吞噬整个网络，并且会越来越渴求所写、所说或发送的每一个字；他们的目标是获取所有这些知识并将其隐藏在定义神经网络的巨大的不透明权重矩阵中。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;这个过程将把我们带到哪里？ Stack Overflow 之所以特别，是因为它汲取了迄今为止只存在于程序员大脑中的实用知识。它浓缩并组织了这些知识，以便每个人都能看到并从中受益。聊天机器人会慢慢地将流量从 Stack Overflow 等网站上吸走，这显然会威胁到这一过程。但他们也可能以不同的形式更新它。好奇地探索新数据源（包括与工作程序员直接对话）的人工智能可能能够比 Stack Overflow 获得更多的原始知识。这些知识所采用的神谕形式可能不像旧网络那样具有公益性，但它也可能更有用。在他的小说“&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Diamond-Age-Neal-Stephenson/dp/0553573314&quot;

rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;钻石时代&lt;/a>;”，Neal Stephenson 想象了一本人工智能书籍，名为《一位年轻女士的图解入门》；实际上，它是一个聊天机器人，专门用来教主角她需要知道的一切，课程总是以正确的水平进行，并适应她的好奇心和反馈——换句话说，这是一个设计完美的课程。 p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot;

while gallivanting backstage at Fashion Week or on the set of a photo shoot. In one scene, a young Moss smokes a cigarette and sips what appears to be champagne while having her hair done. In another, the women sway to the music in a dark night club, grinning in bliss. When Turlington checks into a hotel in Milan, she peers out the window. “&lt;em>;See?&lt;/em>; You don&#39;t get that view at the Savoy,” she says.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;At the time, “Catwalk” was panned by critics who dismissed its vapidness. “The models spend long hours admiring their reflections,” wrote Janet Maslin in the &lt;em>;Times&lt;/em>;. “The Greeks had a word for this, but they never saw narcissism carried to the extremes that Mr. Leacock&#39;s camera captures.” And yet even such a gauzy, allegedly two-dimensional film as “Catwalk” manages to hint, albeit lightly, at the internal conflict that seems to have plagued most models throughout history: a desire to be seen for more than just physical beauty. At one point, Turlington&#39;s Italian driver is pictured complaining about the irrational power that supermodels hold. “Something is wrong in this society, that&#39;s what I think,” he says, dismayed. In another moment, a woman asks Turlington if she&#39;d rather be complimented on her intelligence or her physical appearance. “I think women should be all of [those qualities],” she says. “It&#39;s nicer to be complimented on your whole person.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In September, AppleTV+ released “The Super Models,” a four-part documentary series about the women who dominated the fashion industry during its early-nineties heyday, including Turlington. It&#39;s a project designed with the express purpose of complimenting models on their whole personhood. Executive-produced by the subjects themselves, the slick series focusses on a core group of women who were responsible for defining the shift from simply “model” to “supermodel.” These four women—Turlington, Campbell, Cindy Crawford, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/photo-booth/linda-evangelista-and-the-canny-eye-of-steven-meisel&quot;>;Linda Evangelista&lt;/a>;—are now in their fifties, and they are the latest cultural figures to enter the fray of the celebrity-documentary industrial complex. Here, they&#39;ve ostensibly been given a platform through which to reclaim their images and ruminate on the blizzard of cultural forces that drove them to the top. “The Super Models” is an attempt to humanize, and to add texture to, a group of women whose success was built on untouchability.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;It&#39;s a task that winds up being rather difficult to achieve, as the models and the filmmakers unblinkingly slip into clichéd Cinderella narratives that might make you crave the mindless pleasures in “Catwalk.” In the first episode of the series, which is loosely dedicated to the theme of “The Look,” the directors Roger Ross Williams and Larissa Bills lay out the women&#39;s humble beginnings, none of which foretold the extravagant world that they&#39;d eventually join: we hear, via the women&#39;s voices, and witness, in the archival footage, the tales of Midwestern innocence, strict immigrant parents, and of serendipitous run-ins with photographers and agents. We hear of dubious adversities like the ones faced by Crawford as a teen-ager: she was tall and gangly at a time when the petite-cheerleader type was in fashion; she once felt “traumatized” by a hair stylist who lopped off her ponytail without permission.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“The Super Models” demonstrates that these women&#39;s cultural power was often much more interesting than whatever struggles the series tries to explore in the name of image enhancement. Part of the reason we are so perennially nostalgic for the nineties is that we long for a recent past when celebrity was loud and clear, and icons were undeniable. No genre of nineties celebrity was more striking, perhaps, than the supermodel, in particular the “fab four” celebrated in this series. The four women, who would quickly begin to cross paths on fashion sets and forge lifelong friendships, would eventually create a paradigm shift that brought models to life. They stepped out of catalogues and editorials and onto runways; they hosted shows on MTV; they helped launch young new designers with the Midas touch of their interest and attention. Their star power is so palpable in the archival material of “The Super Models” that the constant exposition of the various talking heads is hardly necessary.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Of course, since these seemingly uncomplicated glory days, the very idea of modelling has been clouded with concerns about unsavory or unethical practices. Blue-chip fashion photographers such as Bruce Weber, Mario Testino, and Terry Richardson have been accused of sexual abuse. (All three men have denied the allegations against them.) Mistreatment of models has been so commonplace that many laws have been proposed aiming to protect young models from the routine exploitation and trafficking they&#39;ve long experienced; beauty standards have become so scrutinized that “no-dels” (not-models) are now being cast on runways and in campaigns alongside agency-stamped glamazons.&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;And so any documentary dedicated to the subject of modelling would necessarily have some dark clouds looming in the distance. Viewers will spend most of the four or so hours of “The Super Models” waiting for the other stiletto to drop. And it does, meekly. The series includes a few brief turns toward the unpleasant. In a sequence about unethical modelling agents, Linda Evangelista—perhaps the most tortured-seeming of all the women featured—explains that, at the age of twenty-two, she married her own agent, who would later be accused of serial sexual abuse of women. (The agent has strongly denied the allegations.) “He felt like a great guy,” she says in an interview. Later, the docuseries breezes over the dissolution of their marriage: “I learned that maybe I was in the wrong relationship,” Evangelista explains. “It&#39;s easier said than done to leave an abusive relationship. I understand that concept because I lived it.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;And yet elsewhere there is often a scene or an anecdote that demonstrates how much these women were protected by, rather than exploited for, their rarefied status. At one point, Campbell tells the story of her relationship with the designer Azzedine Alaïa, who took on a paternal role in her life and protected her from handsy men. When Turlington reflects on the occasions when she was housed in the Paris home of modelling agent and alleged sexual predator Jean-Luc Brunel, she can only express relief. “Most of the time he wasn&#39;t really even there,” she remembers. “I can&#39;t believe that I&#39;m OK”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;These women became so powerful that the backlash soon arrived. The documentary quickly scans over what could be considered, in some alternate film not produced by the models themselves, the “downfall” period: the days when grunge infiltrated fashion and cast doubts on the women&#39;s staying power; the aftermath of Naomi Wolf&#39;s “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Beauty-Myth-Images-Against-Women/dp/0060512180&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Beauty-Myth-Images-Against-Women/dp/0060512180&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Beauty-Myth-Images-Against-Women/dp/0060512180&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;The Beauty Myth&lt;/a>;,” when readers began questioning unreasonable beauty standards. This section of the series discusses the murder of Gianni Versace and the press war between Naomi Campbell and her agent, John Casablancas, who accused her of being abusive in a public battle that “messed [her] work up for many, many years.” Meanwhile, the emerging popularity of the waif threatened to undermine the supermodels&#39; status. Everything, it seemed, was stacked against these women: even Anna Wintour was ready to knock them down a peg. “The whole sort of supermodel thing . 。 。 it certainly got a little bit out of control,” she is filmed saying at one Fashion Week in the nineties.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;It&#39;s the sort of sentiment that someone like Wintour might not be caught expressing on camera today. (In fact, Wintour&#39;s present-day voice is not featured in “The Super Models.”) The series itself is such an adoring affirmation of the persistent privilege of celebrity, and in particular these women, that any attempts to enrich the narrative with strife or hardship fall flat. The models have, somehow, retained their superpowers. ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;rludw4&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;pll1v5&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 06 Oct 2023 01:06:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[How a New Approach to Public Defense Is Overcoming Mass Incarceration]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/how-a-new-approach-to-public-defense-is-overcoming-mass-incarceration]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-05T13:16:44.053Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/651c6be12da7af2d70dfc0a1/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Halpern-legal-nonprofit.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;article >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attribute-verso-pattern=&quot;article-body&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;ArticlePageChunks&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;June 15th should have been one of the best days of Mohammed Sanogo&#39;s life. An honors student with a perfect GPA, he had just walked across the stage at his high-school graduation, in Delaware, and was looking forward to attending the University of Maryland Honors College to study aerospace engineering. Before he left the parking lot at the University of Delaware, where the ceremony was held, Sanogo, a Muslim, stopped to pray with a few friends. For reasons that are in dispute, a few minutes later, as Sanogo was driving away, campus police stopped his vehicle, demanded that he get out of the car, and, after he did, picked him up and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2023/07/15/mohammed-sanogo-delaware-university-arrest-video/70416346007/&quot;>;threw him&lt;/a>; to the ground. Video shot by students at the scene shows officers kneeling on his back to cuff him, as Sanogo struggles to get out of their grip and shouts that he has a “condition”—asthma. He was arrested, charged with reckless driving and resisting arrest, and jailed. The future that he&#39;d been imagining for himself just hours earlier—studying at Maryland, working for &lt;em >;NASA&lt;/em>;—was replaced by the prospect of becoming yet another incarcerated young Black man.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;But that is not what happened, after Sanogo&#39;s case was assigned to the Delaware public defender&#39;s office, in Wilmington. Five years ago, that office became one of two two-year pilot programs for Partners for Justice (PFJ), a scrappy nonprofit with an improbable mission: to transform the public criminal-defense system. (The other pilot program was in Alameda County, California, which includes the city of Oakland; both offices are still in operation.) Then as now, public defenders represent eighty per cent of all people charged with a crime, and they typically work in offices that are underfunded and understaffed. Their clients are primarily poor people of color who are often in need of health care, housing, transportation, addiction treatment, child care, and a host of other services. According to a &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.prisonpolicy.org/reports/pie2023.html#:~:text=At%20least%201%20in%204,Slideshow%202.&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.prisonpolicy.org/reports/pie2023.html#:~:text=At%20least%201%20in%204,Slideshow%202.&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.prisonpolicy.org/reports/pie2023.html#:~:text=At%20least%201%20in%204,Slideshow%202.&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;report&lt;/a>; from the Prison Policy Initiative, “At least 1 in 4 people who go to jail will be arrested again within the same year—often those dealing with poverty, mental illness, and substance use disorders, whose problems only worsen with incarceration.” But lawyers are not social workers; they do not have the time or the skills to help their clients deal with those problems, even if those problems contributed to their criminal behavior in the first place and may do so again in the future.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;As a public defender in Santa Clara County, California, and in the Bronx, Emily Galvin-Almanza, PFJ&#39;s co-founder and co-executive director, with Rebecca Solow, witnessed this problem firsthand. “If you are a defender practicing in an office where there are only criminal-defense attorneys, it&#39;s like being in a hospital with no nurses,” Galvin-Almanza told me. The way to change this dynamic, she believed, was to embed a cohort of advocates in each office to take on tasks that would boost a client&#39;s chances for a good outcome, not just in court but in life. The advocates would be trained in storytelling so they could write a persuasive account of a defendant&#39;s circumstances, and would help them navigate social services, find housing, enroll in benefits programs, and in other ways stabilize their lives. PFJ calls this approach “collaborative defense,” because the accused are working alongside the advocates and the legal team.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In Sanogo&#39;s case, as soon as he was assigned a public defender, an advocate in Wilmington got to work. In less than a week, the advocate collected more than forty letters attesting to Sanogo&#39;s good character. The advocate also wrote what his attorney, Misty Seemans, said was the best narrative about a client she had ever read, highlighting Sanogo&#39;s accomplishments and explaining that he was the sort of young person who normally would have never got caught up in the criminal-justice system. After the prosecutor reviewed this “mitigation package,” the charges were dropped. Sanogo matriculated at Maryland this fall. (The University of Delaware maintains that the police officers acted appropriately, but said in a statement that it “will continue its review of this situation to look for learning opportunities.”)&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In a way, providing this kind of support is not new. In 1990, the Vera Institute of Justice (where I once worked) opened the Neighborhood Defender Service in Harlem, a law office staffed with social-work interns, immigration experts, and client advocates, in addition to lawyers who specialized in a variety of practice areas. Seven years later, the Bronx Defenders was created by a group of lawyers and advocates who aimed to do something similar in the South Bronx; Galvin-Almanza worked there for a number of years. Both organizations have been remarkably successful in demonstrating that a holistic approach to criminal defense benefits the accused, their families, the community, and the public at large. A &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.themarshallproject.org/2018/11/12/the-courts-see-a-crime-these-lawyers-see-a-whole-life&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.themarshallproject.org/2018/11/12/the-courts-see-a-crime-these-lawyers-see-a-whole-life&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.themarshallproject.org/2018/11/12/the-courts-see-a-crime-these-lawyers-see-a-whole-life&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;study&lt;/a>; by researchers at the University of Pennsylvania Law School and the &lt;em >;RAND&lt;/em>; Corporation found that, over ten years, defendants represented by the Bronx Defenders spent more than a million fewer days behind bars, and well more than four thousand people avoided jail time entirely.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;But what worked in New York City, Galvin-Almanza realized, was not necessarily transferrable to other municipalities. “Every public defender has their own culture and political context and challenges and community,” she told me. “And, if you just show them a New York City defender and say, &#39;Hey, do this,&#39; they think, Oh, my God, I could never do that. I don&#39;t know where to start.” But, she added, “If you say, &#39;OK, we&#39;re going to take one element of this, and we&#39;re going to bring it to your practice, and we&#39;re going to build it for you, and we&#39;re going to give you all the training you need to utilize it,&#39; we can get more defenders getting the results of a holistic defender.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;The right of a criminal defendant to “Assistance of Counsel for his defence” was established in the Sixth Amendment, which was ratified in 1791, though that assistance was limited to federal crimes. Not quite eighty years later, the Fourteenth Amendment insured that “nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.” But those were just words, as Clara Shortridge Foltz, an early proponent of public defenders, noted in a &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://speakingwhilefemale.co/law-foltz/&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://speakingwhilefemale.co/law-foltz/&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://speakingwhilefemale.co/law-foltz/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;speech&lt;/a>; delivered at the World&#39;s Congress Auxiliary on Jurisprudence and Law Reform, in Chicago, in 1893. “For the conviction of the accused every weapon is provided and used, even those poisoned by wrong and injustice,” she said. “But what machinery is provided for the defense of the innocent? None. Absolutely none. For its lesser duty of convicting the guilty it has equipped and maintains an array and gives access to the public funds; for the higher one of defense of the innocent there is neither counsel nor ofﬁcer nor money.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;It wasn&#39;t until the unanimous 1963 Supreme Court decision in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.uscourts.gov/educational-resources/educational-activities/facts-and-case-summary-gideon-v-wainwright&quot;>;Gideon v. Wainwright&lt;/a>; that the Court established that anyone charged with a crime has the right to a lawyer, even if they cannot pay for one. “Reason and reflection require us to recognize that in our adversary system of criminal justice, any person haled into court, who is too poor to hire a lawyer, cannot be assured a fair trial unless counsel is provided for him,” Justice Hugo Black wrote in the Court&#39;s opinion, adding that a fair trial “cannot be realized if the poor man charged with crime has to face his accusers without a lawyer to assist him.” But the Court did not determine how this was to be achieved.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Though the Gideon decision resulted in the proliferation of public-defender offices across the country, more often than not they were—and continue to be—afforded fewer resources than those who represent the government.

Consequently, public defenders are not only underpaid but saddled with enormous caseloads. Lawyers in Washington, Nebraska, Rhode Island, New York, and Maryland have reported that they are assigned around a thousand cases a year; a 2017 study estimated that in &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;http://lpdb.la.gov/Supporting%20Practitioners/Standards/txtfiles/pdfs/Louisiana%20Project%20Report.pdf&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;http://lpdb.la.gov/Supporting%20Practitioners/Standards/txtfiles/pdfs/Louisiana%20Project%20Report.pdf&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;http://lpdb.la.gov/Supporting%20Practitioners/Standards/txtfiles/pdfs/Louisiana%20Project%20Report.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;Louisiana&lt;/a>; approximately 3,679,792 hours of work would be required for attorneys to meet the annual public-defense caseload. And, with around ninety-seven per cent of federal cases and ninety-four per cent of state cases dispatched by plea bargains—many of them coerced when a prosecutor tacks on additional charges that threaten long jail sentences if the plea is not taken—it is no wonder that nearly &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.prisonpolicy.org/reports/pie2023.html&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.prisonpolicy.org/reports/pie2023.html&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.prisonpolicy.org/reports/pie2023.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;two million people&lt;/a>; are incarcerated in the United States, which has more people jailed per capita than any other nation.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In 2019, then Senator Kamala Harris, a career prosecutor, introduced the Ensuring Quality Access to Legal Defense (&lt;em >;EQUAL&lt;/em>;) Act, a bill that would, among other things, establish workload limits for public defenders and make their salaries commensurate with those of prosecutors. It went nowhere. The bill was reintroduced in 2021 and again failed to gain traction. It was revived once more this year in the House, where it is still pending, as is a comparable bill, introduced in March by the senators Cory Booker and Dick Durbin, to mark the sixtieth anniversary of Gideon v. Wainwright. GovTrack.us, a Web site that follows the trail of congressional legislation, gives the new Senate bill an &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/118/s850&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/118/s850&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/118/s850&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;eight-per-cent&lt;/a>; chance of adoption.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;cq7zp&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;j186mm&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Even if Congress does not act anytime soon, PFJ&#39;s successes suggest that some of the most pernicious structural impediments to due process are surmountable. Mohammed Sanogo may be an exceptional young person, but the outcome of his case was not. Galvin-Almanza told me that, in Delaware, in nearly ninety per cent of the cases in which a mitigation memo was submitted, PFJ clients receive no jail or prison time, and more than seventy per cent have their charges dropped. As a consequence, she estimates that PJF has prevented six hundred years of incarceration in the state. (This is calculated from clients&#39; actual outcomes subtracted from their potential maximum sentences.) The pilot project was so beneficial that client advocates are now embedded in every county in Delaware, and the program, which was initially supported by philanthropic dollars, is now funded with public monies.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Delaware, of course, is a small state, and even Oakland, the site of the other pilot, has just about half the population of San Francisco, across the bay. But, even before the two-year demonstration projects had concluded, Galvin-Almanza and Solow were fielding calls from public-defender offices around the country. There are now PFJ-trained advocates in twenty-four locations as diverse as the Flathead Indian Reservation in Montana and the urban centers of Houston and Miami. By one estimate, they have prevented five thousand years of jail and prison time and, since this program reduces incarceration, it creates the option for jurisdictions to reduce their spending on jails. Every dollar spent on the PFJ program, then, creates the possibility of saving three to six dollars from the cost of operating a facility.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“We really, really want to live in a world where by 2030 you can&#39;t find a public-defense agency that&#39;s only doing criminal defense—where everybody has these capabilities to problem-solve and address the underlying drivers of crime and also help their clients avoid incarceration and find better opportunities,” Galvin-Almanza told me. She added, “I became a public defender because I couldn&#39;t imagine myself waking up in the morning knowing there&#39;s somebody sitting in jail, and I&#39;m in a position to do something that could help bring them home. How could I not do this?” ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;x425bv&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot;

On this episode of Critics at Large, the staff writers Vinson Cunningham, Naomi Fry, and Alexandra Schwartz make sense of how Swift has managed to harness our collective attention in the midst of a fractured cultural landscape. They are joined by their fellow-critic Amanda Petrusich, who &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/06/19/taylor-swift-eras-tour-review&quot;>;wrote about&lt;/a>; the Eras Tour earlier this year. “When she would address the crowd, it almost felt like I was getting hypnotized,” Petrusich says. She talks about what she calls Swift&#39;s “you guys” energy—the chatty, intimate tone Swift uses to address her fans. Together, the critics discuss the ins and outs of Swiftie fandom, the way that Swift herself savvily turns online censure into content, and whether the success of the Eras Tour—alongside recent maximalist collective events like Beyoncé&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/08/15/beyonces-renaissance-shocks-some-life-into-a-culture-gone-inert&quot;>;Renaissance&lt;/a>; Tour and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/07/31/oppenheimer-movie-review-barbie&quot;>;Barbenheimer&lt;/a>;—marks a new golden age of the mainstream.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;New episodes drop every Thursday.

But there&#39;s one I&#39;ve had in the forefront of my mind—and of my enthusiasm—since I saw it nearly a year ago: Dwayne LeBlanc&#39;s “Civic.” I&#39;ve seen it many times, starting when it was on YouTube and continuing to its current, richly deserved appearance on the Criterion Channel, and I&#39;m unfailingly enthralled by its display of inventiveness, its dramatic scope, and its beauty—in other words, by its union of concept, substance, and style. It is LeBlanc&#39;s first film—he wrote the story and co-wrote the script with Nicole Otero—and it gives a boldly modernist form to the classic tale of the prodigal&#39;s return. A young man named Booker (Barrington Darius) shows up in his home neighborhood of South Central Los Angeles (where LeBlanc is also from) after an unspecified number of years away and attempts to reconnect with people he left behind.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The title is a play on words that conjures the film&#39;s rich duality and its distinctive form, suggesting both the public sphere and an automobile. The film is shot entirely from within Booker&#39;s car (not a Honda Civic, actually, but a 1981 Toyota); most of the action takes place inside it, and everything else is filmed through its windshield, windows, and open doors. Booker&#39;s stated reason for returning is to see his mother, and his main encounters are with two longtime friends he&#39;s fallen out of touch with: Tee (Maurice Powell), a gifted artist from high-school days who teases him about the old car and his new looks, and Harmonie (Courtney Gabrielle Williams), a nurse who&#39;s on her way home. LeBlanc doesn&#39;t go into detail about Booker&#39;s activities, but it seems that he left home to fulfill his ambitions and vanished from his friends&#39; lives.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Booker&#39;s encounters, fraught with memory and burdened by the years of silence, resound with the shock of their suddenness. The conversations, stressful enough as they are, gain a heightened intensity from the imposed proximity of the car&#39;s front seat. They are roiled by questions unanswered, frustrations unresolved, dreams stifled, struggles endured. The cast&#39;s performances, vigorous yet pensive, embody this poised complexity, and the movie suggests mighty currents of memory and emotion that emerge as much from its visual aesthetic as from its acting and script. The constraint of filming solely from inside the car presents a challenge that LeBlanc and his cinematographer, Andrew Yuyi Truong, meet by means of a tightly controlled but freely imaginative repertory of images, which cut into and out of Booker&#39;s point of view. Sometimes tensely static and sometimes in roving motion, the shots play craftily with focus and with the car&#39;s own architecture: like proscenium arches, the doors, windows, dashboard, and seats create frames within frames.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;“Civic” is cinematic chamber music for voices. There are duets, trios, reflective and poignant solos, and even a jaunty quartet, all organized and harmonized by means of images and sounds that parse the dialogue and expand the encounters. The shots run long, long enough to savor the documentary essence of the automotive life—the pleasure of motion, the allure of city lights, the drama of possibilities, the lure of escape. The movie pays special attention to the vehicle&#39;s sensory details: lights that go on and off, chimes that alert, latches that snap, windows that hum as they glide open and closed all serve to punctuate the talk and the action.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The movie, with its vivid evocation of Booker&#39;s inner life, is intimate and personal, but LeBlanc also fulfills the wider social implications of its title. Without any explicit reference to political issues, “Civic” evokes—in hints, symbols, and overtones—the sense of a community under pressure, of residents in a tense and unsteady connection to the city at large. As Booker drives toward South Central, he faces, on freeways, a strange, overdeveloped, Alphaville-like city of futuristic interconnections and communication overload, but on arrival he encounters a neighborhood on the human scale—albeit a neighborhood under glass, scrutinized from the outside and surrounded by invisible barriers. A chance encounter with an engaging stranger (Starla Caldwell) occurs as a result of a breakdown of public transportation, a sign of more general failures of governance. The relationships that Booker rekindles all reflect the community&#39;s tight bonds and common purpose, the inseparability of individual activity and collective well-being. This sense of rootedness in the virtual village piercingly sharpens the drama and places an onus of reconciliation on Booker: the gap left by his departure has been filled in by time and habit, and his return is a conspicuous curiosity, even a dubious intrusion.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The large-scale reverberance of LeBlanc&#39;s film brings to mind the famous, and perhaps apocryphal &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/cinephile-follies&quot;>;remark by Martin Scorsese&lt;/a>;: “Cinema is a matter of what&#39;s in the frame and what&#39;s out.” I agree: a movie is much more than what&#39;s onscreen; the entire world offscreen is an essential part of cinema. It&#39;s the part that&#39;s hardest for directors to encompass in their work because it comes not from the camera but from themselves. LeBlanc brings to bear on “Civic” his alert observations, serious reflections, and depth of feeling, making it reverberate far beyond the confines of one vehicle and far further than the limits of its mere nineteen minutes. ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;smptc19&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;4rmacv&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 05 Oct 2023 07:06:01 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Michael Lewis’s Big Contrarian Bet]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.newyorker.com/books/under-review/michael-lewiss-big-contrarian-bet]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-04T21:59:25.143Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/651da014573040966bd31999/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/GLK-SBF-Oct-2023.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;article >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attribute-verso-pattern=&quot;article-body&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;ArticlePageChunks&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Almost immediately after &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/sam-bankman-fried-and-the-long-road-to-taking-crypto-mainstream&quot;>;the cryptocurrency exchange FTX&lt;/a>; imploded last November, an agent e-mailed Hollywood buyers to reveal that the writer Michael Lewis just happened to have spent the previous six months hanging around &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/annals-of-inquiry/sam-bankman-fried-effective-altruism-and-the-question-of-complicity&quot;>;Sam Bankman-Fried&lt;/a>;. Lewis, the agent noted, “hadn&#39;t written anything yet,” but the recent developments had provided “a dramatic surprise ending to the story.” Nobody would have argued that point. But Lewis didn&#39;t appear to regard this unexpected climax the way everyone else did. According to the agent, the writer had likened Bankman-Fried&#39;s archrival, Changpeng Zhao—who had helped set in motion the bank run that brought FTX down—to “the Darth Vader of crypto” and Bankman-Fried to Luke Skywalker. This might not have been a particularly weird thing to say a month earlier. But it was a &lt;em>;very&lt;/em>; weird thing to say at a moment when Bankman-Fried&#39;s alleged misdeeds had made him not simply the “main character” on Twitter but in much of the actual world. Bankman-Fried stood accused of having defrauded his exchange&#39;s customers of something like eight billion dollars, which he had apparently used to prop up his flailing crypto-trading firm, Alameda Research. Furthermore, he had funnelled, or attempted to funnel, his illicit gains into all sorts of nonsense: naming rights to stadiums, Bahamian luxury real estate, a Pacific island where his confederates might ride out one minor apocalypse or another.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Bankman-Fried, the son of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/10/02/inside-sam-bankman-frieds-family-bubble&quot;>;two Stanford Law School professors&lt;/a>;, seemed to have walked out of a cave one day and become one of the richest people in the world: according to Forbes, which at one point conservatively estimated his fortune at about twenty-six billion dollars, he was second only to Mark Zuckerberg in the speed of his wealth accumulation. His overnight fame was due in part to the candor and alacrity with which he conceded that crypto was mostly a scam; as an advocate for clear government regulations, he positioned himself as an unlikely grownup in the industry. And it was due in part to his charitable donations—as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/08/15/the-reluctant-prophet-of-effective-altruism&quot;>;an effective altruist&lt;/a>;, he planned to give all his money away. In November of last year, the trade publication CoinDesk published a leaked balance sheet that indicated all was not well inside the house of Bankman-Fried. After Zhao, the head of the crypto exchange Binance, tweeted his readiness to dump his financial stake in FTX, customers rushed to withdraw whatever remained of their funds. In about a week, Bankman-Fried was forced to declare bankruptcy. A month later, he was extradited from the Bahamas, where he was indicted on multiple counts of fraud. He has consistently maintained that the whole thing was more or less an accounting mishap, and has pleaded not guilty. During his trial, Bankman-Fried&#39;s lawyer told the court, “It&#39;s not a crime to run a business in good faith that ends up going through a storm.” If convicted, he could face more than a century in prison.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Until the collapse of the Bankman-Fried empire, he seemed like an archetypal character for Lewis—the good kind of barbarian at the gate. Then all of a sudden he appeared less of a Jim Clark, the founder of Netscape and an early figure in the Lewis pantheon, and more of a Michael Milken, who made a dubious fortune on junk bonds. Lewis, however, has never seemed particularly invested in villains, and, over the past eleven months or so, speculation about his new book, “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Going-Infinite-Rise-Fall-Tycoon/dp/1324074337&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Going-Infinite-Rise-Fall-Tycoon/dp/1324074337&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Going-Infinite-Rise-Fall-Tycoon/dp/1324074337&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;Going Infinite&lt;/a>;,” has become a parlor game among journalists. The representative Lewis subject—Billy Beane in “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Moneyball-Art-Winning-Unfair-Game/dp/0393324818&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Moneyball-Art-Winning-Unfair-Game/dp/0393324818&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Moneyball-Art-Winning-Unfair-Game/dp/0393324818&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;Moneyball&lt;/a>;,” Michael Burry in “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Big-Short-Inside-Doomsday-Machine-ebook/dp/B003LSTK8G&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Big-Short-Inside-Doomsday-Machine-ebook/dp/B003LSTK8G&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Big-Short-Inside-Doomsday-Machine-ebook/dp/B003LSTK8G&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;The Big Short&lt;/a>;”—is a winning contrarian, someone with the brilliance and confidence to see something no one else could, and to wager on it. This might have seemed an apt description of Bankman-Fried when Lewis began following him, in the spring of 2022; in Zeke Faux&#39;s new book about the crypto frolic, “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Number-Go-Up-Cryptos-Staggering-ebook/dp/B0BYV2Y3XT&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Number-Go-Up-Cryptos-Staggering-ebook/dp/B0BYV2Y3XT&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Number-Go-Up-Cryptos-Staggering-ebook/dp/B0BYV2Y3XT&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;Number Go Up&lt;/a>;,” he witnesses Lewis interview Bankman-Fried at a conference in the Bahamas, where “the author&#39;s questions were so fawning they seemed inappropriate for a journalist.” The consensus, six months later, was that Bankman-Fried was less of an unkempt prophet than an oafish charlatan. Was Lewis prepared to pivot from an admiring account to a skeptical one? Was he interested in telling this kind of story, or even capable of it?&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In the run-up to the book&#39;s publication, which was set to coincide with the first day of Bankman-Fried&#39;s trial, it started to look as though Lewis had not pivoted at all. On Sunday night, when Lewis appeared on “60 Minutes” to discuss the book, he came out as willing to entertain the possibility that Bankman-Fried had genuinely just lost track of the customer money—that, although he was obviously guilty of egregious mismanagement, it was not clear to Lewis that he had knowingly committed fraud. CoinDesk wrote an editorial called “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/10/02/is-michael-lewis-throwing-out-his-reputation-to-defend-sam-bankman-fried/&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/10/02/is-michael-lewis-throwing-out-his-reputation-to-defend-sam-bankman-fried/&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/10/02/is-michael-lewis-throwing-out-his-reputation-to-defend-sam-bankman-fried/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;Is Michael Lewis Throwing Out His Reputation to Defend Sam Bankman-Fried?&lt;/a>;,” arguing that the interview “all but solidified the idea that &#39;Going Infinite&#39; (Lewis&#39; 21st book), will be a hagiography of Sam Bankman-Fried.” The book is not, as it turns out, a hagiography. Bankman-Fried is not portrayed as a hero. But he isn&#39;t portrayed as an antihero, either. The book&#39;s tone is one of tender beguilement, with the occasional flash of remonstrance; Lewis isn&#39;t sympathetic, exactly, but he is defiantly open to evidence of Bankman-Fried&#39;s innocence. Bankman-Fried does come off as a recognizable contrarian. But perhaps the most relevant contrarian subject in this magnificently ambiguous book is Lewis himself. Lewis likes to write about figures who survey the informational landscape, weigh the probabilities, and, under conditions of uncertainty, take expensive gambles—which is exactly what Lewis himself has done.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Lewis&#39;s affections have never been limited to iconoclasts. He also puts a premium on the category of “people who do their job well”—as in “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Fifth-Risk-Michael-Lewis/dp/1324002646&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Fifth-Risk-Michael-Lewis/dp/1324002646&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Fifth-Risk-Michael-Lewis/dp/1324002646&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;The Fifth Risk&lt;/a>;,” the best of his recent books, about the uncredited foot soldiers of the civil service—and the category of “children.” Some of his child subjects don&#39;t behave like children: in a famous piece from the early dot-com era, he profiled a teen-ager who became one of the most sought-after advisers on a forum for legal consultations. He wrote a sentimental book about fatherhood. Sometimes the children he&#39;s written about are children only in a metaphorical sense: a running thread of “The Big Short” is that the financial crisis happened because there weren&#39;t enough adults in the room. What he admires in a child is a useful kind of naïveté, which allows them to see through an adult world of pretense and convention.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Bankman-Fried is, in Lewis&#39;s account, someone who both never had a real childhood to speak of—his parents began to talk to him as an adult at the age of eight, and he is nearly incapable of producing any character witnesses from before the age of eighteen—and who remains a child. Bankman-Fried is bored by a certain kind of adult stupidity; he has no patience for academia, which he describes as “one long canned talk, created mainly for narrow career purposes.” He is scornful of what he sees as inherited truisms: Shakespeare, it seemed to him by high school, “relies on, simultaneously, one-dimensional and unrealistic characters, illogical plots and obvious endings.” People who believed otherwise just weren&#39;t thinking logically—which, for Bankman-Fried, meant focussing on the underlying statistics. As he asked in a blog post as a college sophomore, “What are the odds that the greatest writer would have been born in 1564?” Even once he is no longer technically a child, he still acts like one. Lewis often seems conflicted about Bankman-Fried&#39;s disregard for the statutes of manhood. On the one hand, why should Bankman-Fried wear anything other than rumpled cargo shorts to fancy Hollywood parties? On the other hand, people who testify before Congress should bother to tie their shoes.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;When it comes to the kind of adulthood Lewis respects, Bankman-Fried acquits himself poorly. Lewis is committed to professional standards, and emphasizes that Bankman-Fried seems exceptionally bad at the aspects of his job that involve scruples or responsibility. As an aspiring corporate mogul in his late twenties, he steadfastly refuses anything like orderly supervision—no org chart, no compliance, no human resources, no oversight at all. Lewis&#39;s best-selling début, “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Liars-Poker-RIsing-Through-Wreckage/dp/B09QY1QV4X&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Liars-Poker-RIsing-Through-Wreckage/dp/B09QY1QV4X&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Liars-Poker-RIsing-Through-Wreckage/dp/B09QY1QV4X&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;Liar&#39;s Poker&lt;/a>;,” introduced him as something of a Pharisee—the antics of eighties bond traders struck him as vulgar. But that life had its crude satisfactions as well, and one way to read the arc of his career is to suggest that Lewis has spent the past two decades wondering whether success should be measured by principle or by consequence. Michael Burry made a lot of money by betting on an outcome that would cause a lot of human misery, but he was also right about subprime mortgages. Lewis is, in other words, a moralist who has dedicated his career to an exploration of pragmatism.&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;The first part of “Going Infinite” is dedicated to an examination of what Bankman-Fried is not. He doesn&#39;t much care about people one way or the other, and he admits to feeling no emotion. Perpetually bored, he requires constant entertainment—most often in the form of complex games, like “Magic: The Gathering,” in which the players are routinely wrong-footed by shifting rules. He makes commitments not out of any sense of emotional conviction but on the basis of mathematics and logic: his veganism, for example, has nothing to do with an affection for animals, about which he couldn&#39;t care less, but with a detached ability to compute the sum of their suffering. His acceptance of effective altruism, a movement devoted to the rational improvement of our lives, as an “intellectually coherent sense of purpose” is similarly bloodless. He feels permanently misunderstood but lacks most if not all the things the rest of us might call desires.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;He does, however, like to win. It&#39;s not until the end of his time at MIT, where he half-heartedly studied physics and served as the “Commander” of his nerd frat, that he at last comes to ascertain what makes him special. In an interview for a job at Jane Street, a trading firm, he&#39;s put through a day of slantwise games. What he discovers, in Lewis&#39;s telling, is that he&#39;s preternaturally well suited to pressurized environments where high-stakes decisions must be made in haste and with limited or occluded information. He also learns that an adversary who proposes a bet is providing you with information encoded in the bet itself. When one interviewer asks him what the odds are that the interviewer himself has a relative who plays professional baseball, Bankman-Fried does the relevant math—how many professional baseball players exist, how many relatives most people tend to have—and figures that the answer is about one in one thousand. But then he stops himself—was the question chosen at random, or was it chosen because the interviewer had some personal connection to it? Bankman-Fried dramatically increases his proposed odds. He gets a job, and thrives as a trader.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Bankman-Fried&#39;s greatest talent, Lewis believes, is his ability to appraise the expected value of a bet on the basis of a roughly grasped probability distribution. This isn&#39;t just about money—although Bankman-Fried goes on to make an ungodly amount of it in a very short time. He leaves Jane Street to found his own proprietary crypto trading firm, Alameda Research, with lavish (and, hypocritically, usurious) funding from wealthy effective altruists. The firm makes big gains on complex arbitrage trades, but at one point it&#39;s also losing half a million dollars a day. Within a few months, Alameda falls apart, and half of the senior staff leaves. A hazy picture of what became known as “the schism” has circulated in the effective-altruist community since then, but Lewis for the first time provides a detailed version of the story: with only a shoddy system to track the firm&#39;s assets, about four million dollars of cryptocurrency went missing. Bankman-Fried didn&#39;t worry too much about it, but his colleagues did; some of them thought that he&#39;d perhaps stolen it, and they told other members of the community that Bankman-Fried was ethically bankrupt. If he could blithely lose track of four million dollars—money that was in theory earmarked to save thousands of lives—how could he possibly position himself as a movement steward? Lewis writes, “At least some of his fellow effective altruists aimed to bankrupt Sam, almost as a service to humanity, so that he might never be allowed to trade again.” Lewis writes, of this internecine struggle, that you might have reasonably assumed that the putative owner of money slated for donations wouldn&#39;t matter: “You would be wrong: in their financial dealings with each other, the effective altruists were more ruthless than Russian oligarchs.” Many people, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/annals-of-inquiry/sam-bankman-fried-effective-altruism-and-the-question-of-complicity&quot;>;myself included&lt;/a>;, felt that even the sketchy lineaments of this story should have forced the EA movement to reckon with Bankman-Fried&#39;s slipperiness sooner. And Bankman-Fried, in his relationships with his erstwhile colleagues, could be monstrous. In this as in basically all other instances, Lewis makes it clear that he acted like an asshole.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;zva6rh&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;kw5gcd&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Lewis spends considerable time on this episode insofar as it prefigures, perhaps needless to say, the much more consequential disappearance of significantly more money a few years later. By way of analysis, Lewis describes a thought experiment that means a lot to Bankman-Fried. He tells Lewis to imagine that he has a close friend called Bob: “He&#39;s great. You love him. Bob is at a house party where someone gets murdered. No one knows who the murderer is. There are twenty people there. None are criminals. But Bob is less likely in your mind than anyone else to have killed someone. But you can&#39;t say that there is zero chance Bob killed someone. Someone got killed, no one knows who did it. You now think there&#39;s like a one percent chance Bob did it. How do you see Bob now? What is Bob to you?” As Lewis glosses the thought experiment, “One answer was that you should never go near Bob again. There might be a 99 percent chance that Bob is the saint you always thought him to be, but if you&#39;re wrong, you&#39;re dead. Treating Bob&#39;s character as a matter of probability felt problematic. Bob was either a cold-blooded killer or he wasn&#39;t. Whatever probability you assigned before you found out the truth about Bob would appear, after the fact, unfair and absurd.” But where Lewis, like most people, reaches by instinct to make some judgment, Bankman-Fried is content to keep Bob&#39;s entire probability distribution in his head. “There is no way to deal with Bob right now that is just,” Bankman-Fried says. It&#39;s not entirely clear what this means—would Bankman-Fried hang out with Bob or not?—but Bankman-Fried seems to be endorsing a wait-and-see approach. He extends the analogy to the missing funds: “We&#39;d either get it back or not.” The money, for its part, ultimately showed up, trapped in the netherworld of a Korean cryptocurrency exchange. There&#39;s no question that Alameda would have been better served by a more conventional, or even any, approach to accounting. Bankman-Fried, however, was right that the missing funds were probably going to show up sooner or later. The post-schism company, Lewis writes, was “no longer a random assortment of effective altruists. They were a small team who had endured an alarming drama and now trusted Sam. He&#39;d been right all along!”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;For what it&#39;s worth, “Going Infinite” is a stupefyingly pleasurable book to read. It&#39;s perfectly paced, extremely funny, and fills in many gaps in a story that has been subjected to an unholy amount of reporting. In the first chapter Bankman-Fried stands up Anna Wintour at the Met Ball. Later, Caroline Ellison, Bankman-Fried&#39;s on-and-off girlfriend—one can&#39;t really call her a “romantic interest,” given that Bankman-Fried by his own account has no real concept of “romance” or “interests”—sends him bullet-point memos about her hopes for a real relationship; as Lewis puts it, “She clearly wanted to be heard, and equally clearly sensed that her intended audience was likely to be playing a video game as he half listened.” Apparently unable to deal with this memo, Bankman-Fried decides not to return from a trip to Hong Kong, and abruptly moves the whole operation there. The financial atmosphere there seemed to suit Bankman-Fried&#39;s affinity for total instability; Lewis compares it to “a chessboard with a voice embedded in it to shout rule changes in the middle of every game.” A few years later, when Ellison tries her hand at another memo, practically begging that he acknowledge their relationship, he gets a one-way ticket to the Bahamas. (“Sam wanted to do whatever at any given moment offered the highest expected value, and his estimate of her expected value seemed to peak right before they had sex and plummet immediately after.”)&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;He spends huge amounts of money on unbelievably stupid things, like a fifteen-million-dollar endorsement deal with a third-tier Shark Tank influencer that required virtually nothing in return aside from a few autographs. Some of Bankman-Fried&#39;s political donations seem not only corrupt but dopey. He wants to pay Donald Trump to not run for reëlection, and that&#39;s one of his better ideas. The campaign allegedly requested five billion dollars, a little steep for even Bankman-Fried. (When contacted by &lt;em>;The New Yorker&lt;/em>; about this claim, a spokesperson for the Trump campaign responded, “Isn&#39;t Sam Bankman-Fried a liar who has been outed as a fraudster and someone that can&#39;t be trusted? Sounds like Sam Bankman-Fried is back to his conning ways and trying to deceive people.”) Almost all the ways Bankman-Fried spends money are inane, especially for a purported effective altruist: he puts a quarter of a million dollars into a fourteen-inch, two-thousand-pound tungsten cube for no reason. He lives in a penthouse with a private beach where he never sets foot. Bankman-Fried isn&#39;t a true believer in anything, really, but he definitely wasn&#39;t a true believer in crypto or its apostles: after he meets Zhao, at a conference, he observes, “CZ sort of just says things. They aren&#39;t dumb. They aren&#39;t smart.” Bankman-Fried seems interested in crypto primarily because it&#39;s a market of dummies with hundred-dollar bills lying all over the ground. But, Lewis writes, “Sam shared an important trait with the crypto religionists: a dissatisfaction with the world as he found it. He did not have any particular hostility toward governments or banks. He just thought grown-ups were pointless.” The main requirement for his board members—the other two of whom he was unable to name—was that “they don&#39;t mind DocuSigning at three am DocuSigning is the main job.”At various points, Lewis describes Bankman-Fried&#39;s relationship to pedestrian reality as that of a Martian to earthlings.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In any Michael Lewis book, the immense satisfactions of narrative and detail are the table stakes. What differentiates this one—which may one day be regarded as either the pinnacle or the nadir of his career—is his personal exposure in the reputational market. Pretty much every sentient being aside from Bankman-Fried&#39;s parents and his lawyers is convinced that he is guilty of one of the greatest financial frauds of all time. As Lewis notes, the odds of an acquittal in federal court are about half of one per cent. Three of his top lieutenants, two of whom fled the Bahamas in panic for the safety of their parents&#39; houses, have turned government&#39;s witness. In a speech Ellison gave to the Hong Kong office in the wake of the bank run, she seemed to have admitted that Alameda had deliberately siphoned customer funds from FTX. The government has more than six million pages of documents in evidence.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Lewis doesn&#39;t fully give Bankman-Fried the benefit of the doubt. He reports two conversations that Bankman-Fried took part in, at a despoiled Bahamas penthouse, that seem to support the charge of malfeasance. He implies that Bankman-Fried&#39;s effective-altruist pledges were largely notional, a convenient vehicle for his will to power. He does ignore some of the most persuasive evidence—he leaves out, for example, the allegation, which Bankman-Fried denies, that he exploited a backdoor in the code that allowed him and his confederates to move customer funds out of FTX—and in general seems to rely on the idea that, as an author, he might skip lightly over a government case that ought to be largely familiar to his readers. But he concludes that there is still an outside chance that Bankman-Fried did not move customer funds. Bankman-Fried&#39;s version of the story is that other people, especially Ellison, messed up while he wasn&#39;t paying attention. Of the missing funds, Lewis writes, “The $8.8 billion dollars that should not have been inside Alameda Research was not exactly a rounding error. But it was, possibly, not enough to worry about. As Sam put it: &#39;I didn&#39;t ask, like, “How many dollars do we have?” It felt to us that Alameda had infinity dollars.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The final chapters of the book are dedicated to an evaluation of Bankman-Fried&#39;s story that stops just short of credulity. The fact that FTX&#39;s famous liquidation engine, which allowed the exchange to close out leveraged positions once the trader ran out of collateral, did not apply to Alameda Research&#39;s trades? It makes sense, Lewis writes, that the exchange&#39;s primary market maker had been allowed, at least early on, to lose some money. The obscure fiat@ account with almost nine billion dollars of customer funds? Lewis finds it not wholly implausible that this was, in fact, a gigantic accounting error explained by FTX&#39;s difficulties securing bank accounts. As Lewis concludes, “His story, implausible as it sounded, remained irritatingly difficult to disprove.” And Lewis very gently insinuates that Ellison, in over her head, might have made some very bad decisions. Lewis&#39;s trademark is an easygoing, wry serenity, but he reserves an unusual contempt for John Ray, the expert brought in to oversee the bankruptcy, for a variety of purported forensic errors. And he concludes the book with the suspicion that the mystery of the missing funds might not be a mystery at all—it seems possible, he writes, that the bankruptcy proceedings thus far have in fact accounted for all of it. Bankman-Fried&#39;s insistence that the whole thing was a series of accounting and management errors seems, to most people who have been following this for the last year, ridiculous on its face. But Lewis&#39;s “Bayesian prior,” a term Bankman-Fried and his ilk use loosely to describe one&#39;s best estimate of an event&#39;s likelihood before further evidence emerges, is informed by the fact that the four million dollars that inspired “the schism” had been, in the end, simply misplaced.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In a thoughtful &lt;em>;Guardian&lt;/em>; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/oct/03/michael-lewis-sam-bankman-fried-crypto-going-infinite&quot;>;profile&lt;/a>; that appeared on Tuesday, Lewis addressed the criticism that he&#39;d gotten too involved with his subject to price him fairly. Lewis said, “I do hear it in the air—around Walter Isaacson&#39;s book [on Elon Musk] and probably around mine—this kind of suspicion-slash-hostility towards the journalist who really gets to know their subject, that it&#39;s access journalism, or you got too close or whatever.” But this was the cost, Lewis told the reporter, of “immersive reporting”—which he had always associated with a “pure joy” he feared had deserted him after his daughter Dixie died in a car accident in 2021. (The book is dedicated to her.) I think that he&#39;s underselling his project, which is marked in this book by a willingness not only to get close to a bewildering and often unpleasant subject but to take something from him. What he began with “Moneyball” has come into full flower with “Going Infinite.” Lewis has surveyed a landscape taken by convention as settled and found it destabilized, at least here and there, by uneven and unreliable information. As Lewis writes, of the aftermath of the implosion, “All these people inside FTX suddenly wanted to seem to know less than they did, and all these people outside FTX thought that they knew more than they actually did. On Twitter, in the blink of an eye, a rumor became a fact, the fact became a story, and the story became an explanation.” Lewis can&#39;t bring himself to grasp at any easy certainty beyond the fact that Bankman-Fried had no business running a vast network of companies as if it were his private fiefdom, even if the public narrative seems overwhelmingly warranted. He has accepted, as Bankman-Fried would put it, that we aren&#39;t merely the average of our behavior but our own probability distributions. He has assessed the expected values, and, like Bankman-Fried, has elected the option of highest risk and highest reward. He&#39;s taking a highly contrarian position on the margin, and he hasn&#39;t done all that much to hedge the trade. The trial will make him look like a fool or it will make him look like a genius. But if there&#39;s even a minimal chance that Bob committed not murder but merely negligent homicide, Lewis will not bring himself to write off his friend. Perhaps Lewis&#39;s book should encourage an update, however minuscule, in our own priors. New information is imminent. We will all wait and see. ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;6dn4pv&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot;

>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;The overthrow began, on Monday evening, with a fittingly juvenile exchange of public taunts. “Bring it on,” House Speaker Kevin McCarthy posted, at 7:31 &lt;em >;PM&lt;/em>; “Just did,” Representative &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/04/19/the-gops-matt-gaetz-problem&quot;>;Matt Gaetz&lt;/a>; replied. Gaetz is the latest in a series of increasingly confrontational Republican members of Congress who have, during the past dozen years, made the job of Speaker in a GOP-controlled Congress one of the capital&#39;s most impossible positions. (See: Boehner, John; Ryan, Paul.) This, however, turned out not to be just another episode of the House Republicans&#39; rolling soap opera of dysfunction but an assault by a punk from Florida serious enough to go down in the history books. Gaetz, an acolyte of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tag/donald-trump&quot;>;Donald Trump&lt;/a>;, followed through on months of threats on Tuesday, using the weapon that McCarthy himself had provided back in January to win the speakership in the first place, when he agreed to a rule allowing a single member to force a vote on a motion to vacate the chair. This was akin to giving Gaetz a loaded gun; it was inevitable that he would pull the trigger. The last time there was a vote on a motion to vacate was in 1910; Joseph Cannon survived and went on to become one of Congress&#39;s legendary figures, an iron-fisted ruler whose name today adorns one of the House&#39;s three main office buildings. No one, it&#39;s safe to conjecture, will be naming any buildings for Kevin McCarthy.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Before the vote on Tuesday afternoon, it seemed possible that McCarthy could win outright, or lose but survive after more rounds of voting failed to produce a viable alternative. But no one had any idea what would happen if he lost and bowed out. Much would hinge on what the Democrats decided: Would they bail out the Speaker, who, with a mere five-seat House majority and more than five Republicans prepared to vote against him, suddenly needed their votes to remain in power? The answer, Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said in a letter that he released shortly before the floor drama began, was no. This was a “Republican Civil War” that Republicans themselves would have to resolve. Other Democrats were even more adamant about rejecting an agreement with McCarthy, whom they reviled not only for years of toadying up to Trump but for breaking his word in recent months to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tag/joe-biden&quot;>;President Biden&lt;/a>;. How, after all, do you compromise with a man whom Abigail Spanberger, a moderate Democrat from Virginia, called “likely the most unprincipled person to ever be Speaker of the House”? Then again, this was Washington, so the possibility of a deal with Democrats could not be entirely ruled out.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The rebellion, such as it was, consisted of Gaetz and his small coterie of allies ranting about McCarthy&#39;s sins. Much of their immediate anger concerned McCarthy&#39;s decision, on Saturday, to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/how-kevin-mccarthy-defied-the-freedom-caucus-and-averted-a-shutdown&quot;>;avert a government shutdown&lt;/a>;, by passing a forty-five-day continuing resolution that would temporarily keep the US open for business while Congress worked to pass the rest of its annual spending bills. Such last-minute maneuvers are commonplace on Capitol Hill and hardly a reason to take the unprecedented step of removing a Speaker. McCarthy&#39;s capital sin, according to Gaetz, was working with Democrats, which gave the proceedings an especially absurd flair, given that Gaetz would be relying on Democratic votes to oust McCarthy and was himself making this point from the Democratic side of the aisle, having been blocked by McCarthy&#39;s allies from speaking from any of the Republican-controlled microphones. As for the Democrats, they stayed silent for the entirety of the debate, adhering to the wise political rule that when your opponents are busy shooting themselves in the foot, it&#39;s best to give them room to do it.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In the end, it took only around two hours and a mere eight members of the Republican conference to render McCarthy the shortest-serving Speaker of the House since 1876, when Michael Kerr died of tuberculosis after only nine months in office. By 7:30 &lt;em >;PM&lt;/em>;, McCarthy was holding a press conference that sounded a lot like a eulogy for himself—long on self-praise, short on self-examination. As for what comes next, an election for a new Speaker is currently scheduled for next Wednesday, but, the truth is, no one really knows what will happen. The US House has ceased to function. Republicans have an ungovernable majority and a small minority bent on obstruction. Gaetz and company are rebels without a real cause, except that of chaos itself.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The political-obituary writers will not be as kind to McCarthy as he was to himself. The fifty-fifth Speaker of the House turned out to be one of the weakest America has ever had, a man whose overriding ambition seemed merely to have been obtaining the job itself and whose willingness to make a bad deal to get it proved to be his predictable undoing.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;By nature &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/12/26/what-kevin-mccarthy-will-do-to-gain-power&quot;>;an accommodationist&lt;/a>;, McCarthy was brought down by the surging Trumpist forces within his caucus that he had sought for years to placate. His humiliation, in that sense, is the Republican Party&#39;s writ large—the humiliation of bowing to Trump again and again, only to be met with more and more outrageous demands. McCarthy is modern proof that appeasement doesn&#39;t work.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;The record of his suck-uppery to Trump and the Trumpists is too long to recount in full. Perhaps it&#39;s enough to recall that Trump nicknamed him “my Kevin,” and that, during Trump&#39;s Presidency, McCarthy was reported to have sent over to the White House a jar of Trump&#39;s favorite Starbursts, carefully culled of all but his favorite red and pink candies. It was McCarthy&#39;s egregious behavior in the aftermath of the January 6th attack on the US Capitol by a pro-Trump mob, however, that really proved him to be a hopeless stooge.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;McCarthy was reportedly enraged by the events of the day, calling Trump in a fury and blaming him for the rampage. He continued to criticize Trump, in public and private, during the following days—“I&#39;ve had it with this guy,” he huffed, on tape, as it turned out, to fellow Republican leaders. And yet he voted, along with a large majority of his conference, to go along with Trump&#39;s campaign of lies about nonexistent voter fraud and refused to certify Biden&#39;s election. Within weeks, McCarthy was flying to Mar-a-Lago to pose with the defeated ex-President—a visual that spoke to the Republican Party&#39;s decision not to exorcise Trump once and for all but to stick with him.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;And yet, for all that McCarthy did for Trump, it was no surprise that Trump declined to step in and do anything to save McCarthy&#39;s tenuous speakership. On the contrary, Trump publicly cheered on those like Gaetz, who were pushing for a government shutdown over McCarthy&#39;s frantic efforts to stop it. As the coup unfolded, Gaetz gleefully told reporters that he had spoken with the ex-President.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The damage that McCarthy did to the House in his vain attempts to stay in power will not be measured only in abstractions. His concessions were all too real. Take, for example, the flip-flop he did last month in opening an impeachment inquiry into Biden, based on years of unproven allegations that Biden might have benefitted from the dubious foreign business dealings of his son &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tag/hunter-biden&quot;>;Hunter&lt;/a>;. This had long been one of the main demands of Trump and his most vocal supporters in the House. But McCarthy had promised not to take such a step without a vote of the full House, and then, when he did not have the votes, did so unilaterally anyway. The inquiry will not just magically disappear now that McCarthy is gone. On the contrary, one of its main proponents—the Ohio Republican &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-political-scene/jim-jordans-singular-pursuit-of-justice&quot;>;Jim Jordan&lt;/a>;—on Wednesday became the first declared candidate to replace McCarthy as Speaker.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The same is true of McCarthy&#39;s dangerous brinkmanship with funding for the war in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tag/ukraine&quot;>;Ukraine&lt;/a>;. He claims to be a strong supporter of Ukraine&#39;s, but faced with rising opposition to continued financial support for Ukraine within his conference—again, fuelled by Trump—he stripped out the Ukraine dollars that were in the continuing resolution proposed by the Senate to avert the shutdown. He also refused to act on a supplemental appropriation of twenty-four billion dollars for Ukraine that the Biden Administration sent to Congress in August.

Evangelista is not a pundit. She was a police reporter working for Rappler, an independent Web site co-founded by Maria Ressa, who was a co-winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, in 2021. Every night, Evangelista went into the streets and alleyways of Manila to see the wreckage of Duterte&#39;s state-sanctioned violence, the bullet-riddled bodies cooling in the gutter, the bored cops muttering uselessly into their radios. She wrote down the names, the histories, taking care to get the details right—her way of honoring the dead and their families. In her news reports, and in her longer investigations, Evangelista was, in essence, recording the “achievements” of an elected tyrant who had fulfilled his campaign promises. His was an honesty written in blood. A Duterte-era vigilante gave Evangelista her title: “I&#39;m really not a bad guy,” he said. “Some people need killing.” According to human-rights organizations, Duterte&#39;s extralegal rampage killed more than ten thousand people.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Over time, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tag/donald-trump&quot;>;Donald Trump&lt;/a>; has been no less truthful about his intentions than Rodrigo Duterte. (In fact, Trump is an admirer; in 2017, he congratulated Duterte for “the unbelievable job” he was doing “on the drug problem.” Trump was also undoubtedly delighted that Duterte had referred to Barack Obama as “the son of a whore.”) In recent weeks, Trump has made it plain that his plans for a second term are no less unbelievable than Duterte&#39;s, no less vengeful or unhinged. We should listen. These are campaign promises. For many years, Trump has hidden in plain sight—he makes no effort to conceal his bigotries, his lawlessness, his will to authoritarian power; to the contrary, he advertises it, and, most disturbing of all, this deepens his appeal. What&#39;s more, there is no question that Trump has so normalized calls to violence as an instrument of politics that it has inflamed countless people to perverse action. Trump has always delighted in the way he could arouse a crowd with implicit or explicit calls to vengeance, from his admonition to “Lock her up!” to his smirking at a protester at one of his rallies, “I&#39;d like to punch him in the face.” He was the inspiration for Charlottesville. The insurrection of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/american-chronicles/the-devastating-new-history-of-the-january-sixth-insurrection&quot;>;January 6th&lt;/a>; was a direct response to his callout to his supporters: “Be there, will be wild!” During the protests that followed the murder of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/07/12/derek-chauvins-trial-and-george-floyds-city&quot;>;George Floyd&lt;/a>;, Trump asked his advisers, according to the former Defense Secretary Mark Esper, “Can&#39;t you just shoot them? Just shoot them in the legs or something?” According to a recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/24/us/politics/trump-prosecutions-threats-violence.html&quot;>;report&lt;/a>; in the &lt;em>;Times&lt;/em>;, since the legal search of Mar-a-Lago last year and the subsequent confiscation of confidential documents there, which caused Trump to vent his rage against federal authorities, threats against FBI personnel and facilities have skyrocketed by more than three hundred per cent.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Now Trump has intensified the rhetoric. There is nothing he will not say. Suggesting that Mark Milley, the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, was guilty of a “treasonous act,” he has suggested that the best sanction would be execution. (“This is an act so egregious that, in times gone by, the punishment would have been &lt;em >;DEATH&lt;/em>;!”)&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;At a recent speech in Anaheim, California, Trump explained how, if reëlected, he would approach the problem of shoplifting: “Very simply: If you rob a store, you can fully expect to be shot as you are leaving that store.” Trump added, “The word that they shoot you will get out within minutes, and our nation, in one day, will be an entirely different place. There must be retribution for theft and destruction and the ruination of our country.” This is consistent with Trump&#39;s general view of law enforcement: he has raised the prospect of shooting migrants attempting to cross the border. (Migrants are “poisoning the blood of our country,” he has said, which is a particularly fascistic formulation.)&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Trump&#39;s reëlection campaign is, by necessity, being conducted as much in and around various courtrooms as it is on traditional podiums. The once and future autocrat has decided to make his legal jeopardy a virtue, to portray himself as the persecuted Everyman standing up to a prosecutorial system riddled with hypocrisy. In August, one day after a federal magistrate judge in Trump&#39;s 2020 election-interference case in Washington warned him not to threaten or intimidate witnesses, he went online to post this: “&lt;em >;IF YOU GO AFTER ME, I&#39;M COMING AFTER YOU&lt;/em>;!” In New York, the judge in Trump&#39;s civil fraud case, Arthur Engoron, had to issue a gag order after the former President baselessly branded a court clerk as “Schumer&#39;s girlfriend” and added, “How disgraceful! This case should be dismissed immediately!!” Engoron ordered Trump to take down the post, though, of course, the damage was done: the word was out, and the court clerk could expect endless harassment online and worse.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Trump reveals his troubled mind even in his casual asides. Speaking to Republicans in California, he railed against “crazy” Nancy Pelosi “who ruined San Francisco.” He then grinned and improvised: “How&#39;s her husband doing, by the way? Anybody know?” (The reference, of course, was to Paul Pelosi, who had been attacked and badly wounded last year by a hammer-wielding man who broke into the Pelosis&#39; house.) The laughter of the crowd was as disturbing as the speaker, from whom we expect nothing less.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;These are not mere anecdotes, “colorful” moments of unscripted temper from a familiar source. (“Just Donald being Donald!”) No, these moments are the essence of Trump and his campaign. In the coming year, you will rarely, if ever, hear discussion of policy from Trump. You will hear expressions of rage and impulse. It is tempting to ignore them, to dismiss them as inconsequential, repetitious, corrosive. They are so painful to listen to, both in their hatefulness and in their frequency, that some have argued the media should ignore them entirely, the better to avoid elevating them. But ignoring them will not make them go away. They are the center of a candidacy that is polling very highly and that threatens so much of what is decent or promising about our politics. Trump&#39;s rage is the inspiration for everything from the Proud Boys to the mailing of pipe bombs to political targets, to say nothing of the deranged behavior of much of the Republican caucus in the House of Representatives. In the meantime, the gaggle of Republicans who are ostensibly Trump&#39;s rivals for the nomination barely criticize him. In their moral cowardice, they run for attention, for branding purposes, or, perhaps, for a spot in a new Trump Administration.&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;At the same time, careful attention needs to be paid to a contrasting temperament and set of values. This past week, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tag/joe-biden&quot;>;Joe Biden&lt;/a>; delivered a stark and important speech in Arizona that focussed not on his considerable achievements in economic, domestic, and foreign policy but on the threat to democratic ideals and institutions posed by his likely 2024 opponent and his followers. Trump, he said directly, derived his inspiration not from the Constitution or human decency but from “vengeance and vindictiveness.” No less worrying to Biden was the reaction—or lack of it—to Trump&#39;s incessant threats. The general silence following Trump&#39;s comments about Milley, he said, was “deafening.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;“We should all remember: democracies don&#39;t have to die at the end of a rifle,” Biden said. “They can die when people are silent, when they fail to stand up.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Biden may utter this in a less-than-booming voice. Age has taken the high notes off his delivery. But what he said, the stakes he is describing, demand amplification.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In 2016, when Rodrigo Duterte was running for the Presidency in the Philippines, he spoke in the familiar voice of strongmen everywhere: “Forget the laws on human rights. 。 。 。 You drug pushers, hold-up men, and do-nothings . 。 。 I&#39;ll dump all of you into Manila Bay and fatten all the fish there.” Were he or his security forces ever to face prosecution, he said, he would issue letters of immunity: “Pardon given to Rodrigo Duterte for the crime of multiple murder, signed Rodrigo Duterte.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;This is the mental universe, the sensibility of Donald Trump, who seems like a lock to win the Republican nomination and has an excellent chance of returning to the White House. So much—the rule of law, global and national security, the fate of the environment—depends on whether Americans reject his rage or endorse it and thus transform this country beyond recognition. Patricia Evangelista describes herself in her book as a “citizen of a nation I cannot recognize as my own.” Are we prepared to feel the same? ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;p1o6g6&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;8u34g5&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 05 Oct 2023 02:06:01 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
