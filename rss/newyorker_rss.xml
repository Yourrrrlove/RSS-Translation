data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;二十年来的大部分时间里，莎莉·斯诺曼 (Sally Snowman) 一直在崎岖不平的小布鲁斯特岛上生活和工作。波士顿外港的一片光秃秃的岩石、马唐草、混凝土和破旧的建筑物。在海岸警卫队的支持下，她担任波士顿之光的守护者和历史学家。该灯塔于 1716 年 9 月开放，是美洲殖民地的第一座灯塔，斯诺曼是美国最后一位官方看守者。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;灯塔是一座白色塔楼，高八十九英尺，东窗面向北大西洋，面向大约三千英里外的英国海岸。斯诺曼是一位说话直率的新英格兰人，拥有三个世纪前的水手血统，在执勤时保持着干脆利落的正式举止。但有时，站在灯笼室里，她会想象乘坐一艘商人的大帆船前往新世界的航行是什么感觉——这艘大帆船是用橡木、绳子、焦油和亚麻布手工制作的。除了剧烈晕船之外，乘客还患有发烧、痢疾、疖子、坏血病、口腔腐烂、老鼠咬伤和虱子，虱子多到可以从身上刮下来。一位移民写道，当大风肆虐时，人们“最可怜地哭泣和祈祷”，“每个人都相信船会沉入海底”。在那条渡口上，一名妇女因分娩停滞而丧失了行动能力，被从舷窗推入海中。 “这是一次可怕的旅行，”斯诺曼说。 “想象一下他们看到灯光时的感受。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;八月的一天早上，我们在北韦茅斯的一个码头相约去灯塔游览，斯诺曼在那里停着一艘破旧的海上小船。 “带上雨具，”她在电子邮件中写道。 “下雨的可能性为 40%。海 2 英尺。 。可能会有点颠簸。”她是一位身材瘦小的女人，有着晒黑的脸，友善，她穿着海岸警卫队的蓝色衣服在舷梯上迎接我：棒球帽、羊毛衫和速干工装裤。船员们——她的姐夫杰克·理查森和她的丈夫杰伊·汤姆森——正在准备出发。斯诺曼于 1993 年认识了汤姆森，当时汤姆森参加了她为海岸警卫队辅助部队（该部队的志愿者部队）主持的高级训练课程。他的 T 恤上写着白色字体：“&lt;em>;守护者的丈夫&lt;/em>;。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;当我们穿过葡萄岛和斯莱特岛之间的一条水域时，波士顿之光的闪光闪烁着。在地平线上。这座塔现在是一个历史性的地标，是在马萨诸塞州商人的紧急游说后建造的，他们对港口的许多浅滩和岛屿上的船只、货物和“陛下的臣民”的损失感到震惊。马萨诸塞湾殖民地的经济依赖于国际贸易，因此大会迅速批准了“一盏扫浪灯”，两侧都暴露在风和开阔的海洋中，并有一个“必须始终小心、勤奋地履行职责”的看守人。 ”&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;在 Nantasket道路——通往港口的狭窄、危险重重的历史主干道——我们经过了数十处早期沉船遗址。渐渐地，一幅经典的画面映入眼帘：一座逐渐变细的石塔、一座绿色装饰的白色隔板看守人的房子、一座小船库。当我们上岸时，斯诺曼警告说：“小心海鸥粪便。海鸥已经接管了。”与沿途森林覆盖的岛屿不同，小布鲁斯特没有树木——可能是很久以前就被砍伐的，用于建筑材料和燃料。草坪上竖起了霓虹橙色的“禁止入内”标志，船库空无一人。水老鼠已经在下面挖洞了。雪人打开了看门人的房子，该房子建于 1884 年，靠近水边。门厅里有一块木牌，上面画着一座闪闪发光的灯塔，上面写着“我们将为您留灯。”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data- testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot;

data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;这不是给定的。美国目前约有八百五十座灯塔，其中只有一半充当活跃的“航标”。其余的已经被 GPS 淘汰，或者由于日益恶劣的天气造成的损坏而变得昂贵得难以忍受。活跃的使用自动电灯。 2018 年，波士顿之光号未能通过安全检查，海岸警卫队进行了斯诺曼所说的“现实检查”。她所带领的岛屿之旅被停止，她在那里的存在仅限于风暴季节以外的维护旅行。 12 月 30 日，当她​​七十二岁退休时，该站将“无人值守”，或者用她的话说，“无人”，而灯塔看守人的职业也将走上破布收集者的道路。 &lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;波士顿之光以及其后建造的灯塔为一个不断发展的国家提供了至关重要的服务。在《权利法案》颁布后不久，美国国会通过的第九项法律设立了一个机构来监督它们。随着它们越来越被新技术取代，它们的崇拜者努力保护它们，将它们视为民族精神的象征。 1986 年，参议员泰德·肯尼迪 (Ted Kennedy) 在为玛莎葡萄园岛灯塔筹款的活动中宣称，“当我们保护灯塔时，我们就是在保护我们自己的一部分。”肯尼迪属于一个由忠诚的水手组成的沿海家族，他引用了他哥哥约翰的话：“我们所有人的血管中的盐分含量与海洋中的盐分含量完全相同。”&lt;/p>;&lt;商船飞行员往往都是头脑冷静的，这是必然的，但即使他们说灯塔仍然有一席之地。布莱恩·福尼尔船长在波士顿港作为拖船操作员学习了自己的职业。 “波士顿之光是我的后院，”他告诉我。如今，他通常在缅因州驾驶油轮，并且像其他使用 GPS 的专业航海家一样，他更喜欢依靠眼睛的证据和悠久传统的保证。在能见度较低的情况下，福尼尔说：“我正在寻找浮标的闪光，灯塔的闪光。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;北美与灯塔的浪漫始于一次可怕的事故。 1718 年，波士顿灯塔的第一位守护者、养羊户和船舶驾驶员乔治·沃西莱克 (George Worthylake) 带着妻子和女儿到这座城市进行了一次短暂的旅行，将灯塔和两个年幼的孩子留给了他的奴隶沙德威尔 (S​​hadwell) 和迪娜 (Dina) 照顾。回来后，沃西莱克将船停泊在近海，沙德威尔划船去接这群人。当年幼的孩子们在岛上观看时，划艇翻了，所有人都淹死了。这场悲剧激发了 12 岁的本杰明·富兰克林创作一首诗的灵感，也激发了饱受折磨的清教徒牧师科顿·马瑟的葬礼演说。马瑟在他的讲道“上帝的维护和崇拜”中指示哀悼者思考孩子们“难以形容的恐惧”，因为他们“看到了父母和妹妹的致命痛苦”。下一任守门员罗伯特·桑德斯在上任后不到两周就溺水身亡。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;即使除了这些不幸之外，这份工作也没什么值得推荐的：每天二十四小时，七——每周每天都保持警惕，最低工资（相当于今天的年薪一万一千美元），以及需要钟表匠的精确度和蛮力的职责。必须仔细保养灯。据斯诺曼介绍，早年波士顿之光的灯需要充满鲸油或鲱鱼油，并且不断修剪灯芯以避免冒烟。 1852 年，新成立的美国灯塔委员会向“wickies”（看守者被称为“wickies”）发出了 20 条挑剔的指示。反光镜必须用精确比例的酒和胭脂粉擦拭干净。灯笼的通风器要定期打开以吸入新鲜空气。但要避免突然的水流；灯笼偶尔会被吹倒，导致塔楼着火。当发现划船者遇到麻烦时，管理员跳进了车站的汽艇，绝望地希望能够挽救他们的生命并饶恕自己。&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;被分配到被认为对其家人来说太危险的岛屿的人员谈到难以忍受的孤独，雾号的呻吟声和海浪的不断拍击加剧了这种孤独。但即使是陪伴也不能总是抵御疯狂。 1897 年，一名饲养员来到纳拉甘西特码头的救生站，他几乎赤身裸体，背部受伤流血。他解释说，他的助手醉酒后用屠刀袭击了他，然后在他乘船逃跑时追赶他，并大喊：“哦，我要杀了你！”第二天晚上，助理被发现在灯塔里疯狂跳舞，并将炊具扔进海里。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;斯诺曼承认，看守人的生活“并不适合所有人”。但从十岁起，当她第一次踏上小布鲁斯特岛时，她就被迷住了。在与她的父亲（一名海洋工程师和海岸警卫队辅助人员）野餐时，她抬头凝视着灯塔，宣布有一天她会在那里结婚。 （1994年，她和汤姆森在塔附近举行了一场小型婚礼。）后来，她还发现了一个有吸引力的榜样：艾比·伯吉斯，缅因州一位灯塔看守人的女儿。 1856年，艾比16岁时，她的父亲前往大陆取货，留下她负责。东北风来临时，艾比和她的姐妹们把生病的母亲搬进了塔楼，随后海浪冲走了她们的房子。经过长达一周的磨难后，艾比写信给一位朋友，“虽然有时我因劳动而精疲力尽，但灯光从未熄灭过。”随着时间的推移，数百名妇女成为了饲养员，其中大部分是通过从父亲或丈夫那里继承工作。艾达·刘易斯 (Ida Lewis) 在纽波特的 Lime Rock Light 工作了 50 多年，拯救了至少 18 条生命，并在媒体报道中被称为“美国最勇敢的女性”。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;斯诺曼从未想过她会成为受雇管理波士顿之光。她在学校里成绩很差，每年都勉强通过。尽管如此，她还是在布里奇沃特州立学院获得了学士学位，在库里学院获得了教育学硕士学位。她在库里教日托所的幼儿、老年护理所的老人、有学习障碍的学生和有抱负的教育工作者。她获得了博士学位。在在线大学瓦尔登湖获得神经语言学博士学位——“因为我想找出为什么我的大脑如此混乱。”三十六岁时，她被诊断患有阅读障碍和注意力缺陷障碍。&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >; &lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;n3sy9l&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;1976 年，她跟随父亲进入海岸警卫队辅助部队，最终她要求轮换小布鲁斯特担任助理管理员。 1994 年，她和普利茅斯镇土木工程师汤姆森在岛上度过了他们的第一个夜晚，这次经历让他们开始探索波士顿之光的历史。五年后，他们自行出版了一本有关灯塔的书。&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;在斯诺曼看来，灯塔是一个未被充分重视的地方独立战争英雄——反抗英国暴政的场所。托利党控制了城市和港口，灯塔为他们提供了安全通道。 1775 年 7 月 20 日，约瑟夫·沃斯少校和 60 名大陆军士兵乘坐灵活的捕鲸船登上了小布鲁斯特岛。革命者烧毁了灯笼室，并抢走了他们能携带的所有东西，包括一门大炮——岛上的第一个雾信号。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;英国人修复了塔楼，但乔治·华盛顿指挥官下令进行第二次攻击。 7 月 30 日晚，一支大约 300 人的大陆军轻松地制服了守卫，一位英国海军陆战队员指出，其中许多人“喝了酒，完全不适合服役”。 1776 年，当保守党被迫撤离波士顿时，他们的一些人在塔楼留下了一桶火药。爆炸后，只剩下了底座。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;在我们参观期间，斯诺曼向我展示了原来底座的不规则“碎石”，以及标志着1783年重建部分的矩形块。二十年后，她说，铁缆围绕塔的中部间隔放置，以“控制凸起”，防止水渗入外部砖石。大多数灯塔都有鲜明的特征，对于认识它们的人来说，就像孩子的胎记一样熟悉。波士顿灯塔上的带子仍然充当着进入港口的船只的标记。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;随着越来越多的灯塔实现自动化以及人员的撤离，波士顿灯塔越来越成为一个异类。到 1991 年，它是唯一仍然有人值班的海岸警卫队站。但保护主义运动正在联合起来。肯尼迪参议员在访问小布鲁斯特后，发起了一项立法，以保留该站的工作人员。随后，他与海岸警卫队合作，用文职看守人员取代军事人员，并向游客开放该岛。&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot;

>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Boston Light 的菲涅耳透镜是美国仅有的 50 个功能齐全的原创透镜之一在塔内，我们沿着铁制螺旋楼梯走七十六级台阶，然后爬上梯子到达装备室，那里的发条机构呼呼作响，发出咔哒声，转动着镜头。斯诺曼指出，在 1998 年灯塔实现自动化之前，看守人必须每四个小时给它上一次发条。现在，随着不断的运转，青铜滚轮逐渐磨损。她指着房间里每个表面上覆盖的细小雪花，提醒自己在下次旅行时将它们除去。&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;穿着救生衣的莎莉·雪人在船头。” src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653be73f7cf57774149d355f/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/231106_r43306_rd.jpg&quot;

Graves had been bought by Dave Waller, the fifty-year-old co-owner of a special-effects company in Boston, Brickyard VFX, and his wife, Lynn, a graphic designer who runs a neon-sign shop. Snowman ignored the headlines about their winning bid (close to a million dollars, the highest ever paid for a lighthouse), and some muttering about self-indulgent one-per-centers. “These beautiful icons need to be constantly maintained, according to strict regulations,” she said. “The Coast Guard doesn&#39;t have the expertise. Its duty is to save lives. More good can be done for the future of lighthouses through nonprofits, and people like Dave Waller.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Graves Light, an unpainted granite obelisk built on jagged rock, sounded like the kind of desolate place where keepers lost their minds. On Waller&#39;s Web site, he warns boaters and divers, “The ledges are dangerous. Stay away,” adding that the sea swells “can smash a boat on the rocks or crush and sink a boat under the dock.” After Snowman led our tour of Boston Light, we motored out to Graves Ledge. As we gazed up at the tower, Thomson said that more than a hundred years of coal dust and grime had been sandblasted off. He pointed out a storehouse, which Waller calls Shanty No. 2. “The first one washed away,” Thomson said. “On the security camera, you can see—house, then wave, then no house.”&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;Sally Snowman standing by the Fresnel lens of Boston Light.&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653ae5ba7cf57774149d3460/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/231106_r43308.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653ae5ba7cf57774149d3460/master/w_120,c_limit/231106_r43308.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653ae5ba7cf57774149d3460/master/w_240,c_limit/231106_r43308.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653ae5ba7cf57774149d3460/master/w_320,c_limit/231106_r43308.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653ae5ba7cf57774149d3460/master/w_640,c_limit/231106_r43308.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653ae5ba7cf57774149d3460/master/w_960,c_limit/231106_r43308.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653ae5ba7cf57774149d3460/master/w_1280,c_limit/231106_r43308.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653ae5ba7cf57774149d3460/master/w_1600,c_limit/231106_r43308.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;The Fresnel lens, a complex assemblage of hundreds of prisms, can extend flashes of light dozens of miles out to sea.&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;p >;When the station was automated, in 1975, its Fresnel lens was given to the Smithsonian, where it sits in a warehouse. Unable to find another, Waller set out to Frankenstein one, with help from his sons, a young machinist, and a lighthouse-restoration engineer in Australia. The process was consuming, Snowman said: “Dave&#39;s accumulation of pieces from all over the world took nine years.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;It wouldn&#39;t have been possible without a large cohort of supporters—volunteers and paid locals, descendants of Graves Light keepers, and military authorities. In early September, the Coast Guard helicoptered a new lens base—two eleven-hundred-pound pieces, swinging from a cable—to the foot of the tower. A private pilot hoisted them to the catwalk outside the lantern room, where Waller&#39;s crew snagged them with boat hooks, then guided the pilot by radio to set them in place. When the Fresnel was assembled, Snowman took her boat out to Graves to see it. She told me, “The splendor of the lens touched my heart.”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;qodjim&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Soon afterward, I met Waller at a marina in Boston Harbor for a trip to Graves. Snowman and Thomson were to meet us there, but the weather was growing worse—Tropical Storm Ophelia, which had blasted North Carolina with seventy-mile-an-hour winds, was making its way up the coast. Shortly before we were set to depart, Snowman e-mailed, “NO-GO for me &amp;amp; Jay.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Waller assured me that his decommissioned Coast Guard Response Boat had handled worse: “We go out in all kinds of shitty weather.” After a head-snapping ride, he tied the boat to a buoy several hundred feet from Graves Ledge and winched a rubber dinghy down into the water. We had set off toward the light in the dinghy when Waller abruptly said, “Fuck!” He&#39;d left one of our oars in the response boat, and we were helplessly bobbing out to sea. “This is bad,” he said. “This is really bad.” As I entertained flashbacks of the Worthylake drownings, Waller tore off his shoes, pants, and glasses, and dove into the water, sidestroking to the boat through choppy waves. Some minutes later, he motored up, dripping wet, a bleeding gash on his leg. The oar retrieved, his glasses broken, he briskly rowed us to the landing.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The Coast Guard hadn&#39;t yet installed the lamp in the Fresnel, so we were able to step inside. It felt like entering a geodesic dome: a three-and-a-half-ton rotating assembly of glass. Waller stood on the supply reservoir for a five-wick oil lamp—an eBay acquisition—as he made some final adjustments. The modern lamp, refracted and reflected through fifteen antique bull&#39;s-eye panes, will be powered by solar panels on the boathouse roof and a small wind turbine outside. “That lens is stunning,” Jeremy D&#39;Entremont, the historian for the US Lighthouse Society, told me, after his own pilgrimage to Graves. “It&#39;s crazy. The old has become new again.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Snowman, assured by these kinds of preservation efforts, wasn&#39;t overly concerned about the future of Boston Light. Still, she admitted that she&#39;ll miss the work, and the place—its solitude and appalling winter weather even more than its sun-drenched summer days: “I can&#39;t get enough of it.” When she&#39;s on Little Brewster, she likes to climb to the lighthouse gear room and open an Alice in Wonderland-size door that leads onto the catwalk. She sits there, dangling her legs over the edge, struck by how people from earliest antiquity have tended lights, “for the purpose of guiding vessels safely into harbor, or as warnings to stay away from hazards. This, to me, is a kind of miracle.” ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 30 Oct 2023 18:06:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[The Woman Restoring Basquiat’s Forgotten Ferris Wheel]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/11/06/the-woman-restoring-basquiats-forgotten-ferris-wheel]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-30T10:00:00.000Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653c2a9c68e701fce6dfe4e0/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/231106_r43291illuweb-site.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;article >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attribute-verso-pattern=&quot;article-body&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;ArticlePageChunks&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;In terms of disasters, Rosa Lowinger prefers fires to earthquakes and anything to hurricanes. “When you walk into a hurricane damage site, that water is not just water,” she says. “That water is full of dead snakes and animals and oil slicks.

The brainchild of an Austrian artist and impresario, Luna Luna had been presented at a fairground in Hamburg in the summer of 1987, then sat, disassembled and forgotten, for decades, before ending up in shipping containers in East Texas. (Litigation!) In 2022, the musician Drake, as part of a group of investors, bought the shipping containers, contents unseen. Inside were carnival rides and attractions designed by more than thirty of the previous century&#39;s geniuses, from Salvador Dalí to David Hockney to Roy Lichtenstein.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“There were, like, schmutzy schmear marks all over various things,” Lowinger said—but not the pile of rust she&#39;d have expected. The mandate from her employers was minimalist; with plans to put the objects on display again, they wanted to preserve their history. “You&#39;ll see the signs of wear, a little bit of abrasion, where somebody might have scuffed it or kicked it. We didn&#39;t remove that,” she said.&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;She walked past a Ferris wheel—a Basquiat. The gondolas, shaped like skulls, were painted with phrases like “Skeezix” and “Rid of You.” Hanging from the rafters was a gigantic Keith Haring banner of dancing figures with dogs&#39; heads, which Lowinger had carefully de-grimed; it accompanied a Haring merry-go-round. In the back corner, there were screen-printed panels by Joseph Beuys. When Lowinger first saw them, they were besmirched with orange gunk: “I said, &#39;Well, let me just try and see if I can clean it.&#39; ” She did.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Dalí&#39;s contribution to Luna Luna was a geodesic dome made of mirrors and plastic panels with fried eggs painted on them. Lowinger hadn&#39;t got around to cleaning the eggs yet. She ran her pinky—least greasy of the fingers—across the white part, which was beginning to crack and detach from the surface. “A lot of times you get clients that go, &#39;Oh, that can&#39;t be saved,&#39; ” she said. “And it&#39;s, like, don&#39;t say to me what can be saved. &lt;em>;Ask&lt;/em>; me if something can be saved.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In her memoir, “Dwell Time,” which came out in early October, Lowinger describes a childhood punctuated by bomb blasts, upheaval, and the frequent rages of her mother, a great beauty, who had been traumatized by poverty and instability. When restoring art, Lowinger writes, “it helps to have the psyche of a fleeing exile, or someone whose parent can flash like a wildfire. 。 。 。 Entropy is always around the next corner.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;She stopped at a caddy loaded with her cleaning supplies: makeup sponges, horse-washing soap, denatured alcohol, acetone, and a solvent gel, for the deepest stains. Her mother—ninety-one years old and still immaculately turned out—had other hopes for her only daughter&#39;s career. “I know for a fact she would so much rather me be an aesthetician than a conservator,” Lowinger said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Northridge, Port-au-Prince, Katrina, arson at Mission San Gabriel, wildfires in Napa and Bel Air: Lowinger has worked them all. Then there are the softer assaults, from salt air and bronze disease and inherent vice—the baked-in flaws in objects that sometimes take years to manifest. “Damage isn&#39;t even an aberration,” she said. “It&#39;s part of the natural course of things.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Lowinger wandered to the far side of the warehouse to inspect her fix on a painting of a cartoonish butterfly wearing red high-heeled pumps. It was made by Kenny Scharf, as part of a fantastical swing ride. Securing a flake of paint, she said, required an elaborate process of applying glue to the back of the flake, letting it dry, and then re-melting it, before tacking it down. “ &#39;Cause if you just try to put an adhesive in, and push it to set, the memory of the flake coming up will pull it back out,” she said. She took a step back. There was a small spot where the paint had come off entirely. That was fine. “In this project,” she said, “you don&#39;t fill in the hole.” ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;c4riyy&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;1syams&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 30 Oct 2023 18:06:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Ladies, Start Your Engines!]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/11/06/ladies-start-your-engines]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-30T10:00:00.000Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653c2aea6e205727eb7689c0/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/231106_r43293illuweb-site.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;article >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attribute-verso-pattern=&quot;article-body&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;ArticlePageChunks&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Recently, four European race-car drivers were squeezed into the back of a New York taxi headed to an unofficial race event in New Jersey—a showdown at a suburban go-kart track. Their first test of endurance? American traffic. “They&#39;re using their horn a lot, but it&#39;s not helping,” Michelle Gatting, of Denmark, said. Sarah Bovy, of Belgium, chuckled. Doriane Pin, who hails from France, said nothing. Pin, nineteen, is a rabbitlike five feet two with dirty-blond hair. Despite being barely old enough for a driver&#39;s license in most European countries, she was last year&#39;s Ferrari Challenge Europe champion.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Pin races with Gatting, Bovy, and Rahel Frey, of Switzerland, as the Iron Dames, the only all-female endurance-racing team in the world. Race-car driving is one of the few sports in which men and women compete professionally side by side. In this year&#39;s Le Mans, the crème de la crème of endurance events, their hot-pink car came in fourth. (They would have taken third if not for a weary brake.)&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;As they traversed the Lincoln Tunnel, the Iron Dames were peppered with questions by a novice racer. Team mascot? “I vote for a topless Abercrombie model,” Bovy said. “For years, &lt;em>;years&lt;/em>;, it was just female models standing there and being cute.” Celebrity run-ins? “I mean, Dory met LeBron,” Bovy said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Pin nodded. “He was so big,” she said. Favorite pro racers? Someone mentioned Lella Lombardi, the only woman ever to have scored in a Formula 1 world championship. (She scored half a point in 1975.)&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The conversation turned to go-karting. Pin explained that, because she was so tiny as a kid, she had to wait until she was nine years old to start racing. By twelve, she was competing in national championships; at fifteen, she won the French national in the female category. Frey started “late,” at the age of twelve, and immediately fell in love with the sport, which she claims is harder than endurance racing. “It&#39;s more aggressive—everything happens quicker,” she said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The cab pulled up to a gray hangar, outside Jersey City. “It&#39;s funny how a go-kart track looks the same everywhere in the world,” Bovy said. Inside, the racers took in the two-story course, amid the flashing lights and clangs of a jumbo arcade. It was smaller than they&#39;d expected.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;“Dory&#39;s going to have an advantage because she&#39;s light,” Gatting proclaimed.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Oh, come on!” Pin shot back. There was talk of walking the track to survey the route, but then Gatting found a leather recliner and sank into it.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Sarah, do you want to mentally prepare a bit more?” she said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Bovy was distracted. “We have to wear &lt;em>;seat belts&lt;/em>;,” she moaned. After the team watched a mandatory safety video, they grabbed the bespoke helmets that they&#39;d brought along, decorated with inspirational quotes. (“Go fast and never ever give up!”) The novice joined them for the race (previous experience: a 2006 birthday party), in her own go-kart. “You can follow me for the first loop,” Pin offered. Frey&#39;s advice was to cut inside the curves and then out again. She mimicked a wavy line with her hands.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;The pros shot ahead, an elegant fleet skidding in tandem like Santa&#39;s reindeer. The novice lagged behind, on empty track. After the first round, Gatting approached a track mechanic and asked the question on everyone&#39;s mind: “Can it go any faster?” (The Dames race at a hundred and ninety miles per hour.) He gave a firm headshake: No.&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;The next round began. Several dizzying minutes later, the final scores showed an upset: Pin wasn&#39;t in the top three. “I had some problems with the go-kart,” she mumbled.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Nonetheless, the mechanic was impressed. “I haven&#39;t raced in a while, but when I saw you guys dicing it up . 。 。 !” he said. He held out his phone to show old pictures of himself in a racing suit. A group of boys under the age of ten replaced the Dames in the karts. Nearby, Gatting and Bovy, who&#39;d taken first and second place, mounted kid-size motorbikes affixed to a stationary rumble strip. Bovy eagerly pushed forward and cast a side glance at Gatting: “I&#39;m not finishing another race behind Michi.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Frey had found a leather couch to sprawl on. “We feel the jet lag,” she said.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;A quiet fell over the team on the ride back to town. Bovy observed that rental go-karting is tamer in America than in Europe. “It&#39;s really a leisure activity,” she said. She noted that their fastest times that day had been about thirty-two seconds per lap. “The go-kart track I raced at when I was thirteen was twenty-three seconds.” Gatting chimed in to say that in Europe they use real tarmac.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;As they exited the West Side Highway, a loud crunch was heard outside. Pin craned her neck to look: one vehicle had scraped another. The racers groaned. “Good contact,” someone said. ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;volg3p&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;k82838&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 30 Oct 2023 18:06:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Briefly Noted Book Reviews]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/11/06/some-people-need-killing-the-boy-from-kyiv-wound-and-this-is-salvaged]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-30T10:00:00.000Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653810faa3abbf23fe071764/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/231106_r43284web-tout.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;article >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attribute-verso-pattern=&quot;article-body&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;ArticlePageChunks&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;Some People Need Killing by Patricia Evangelista.&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653810a96d5fb099a570e146/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/231106_r43282web.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653810a96d5fb099a570e146/master/w_120,c_limit/231106_r43282web.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653810a96d5fb099a570e146/master/w_240,c_limit/231106_r43282web.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653810a96d5fb099a570e146/master/w_320,c_limit/231106_r43282web.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653810a96d5fb099a570e146/master/w_640,c_limit/231106_r43282web.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653810a96d5fb099a570e146/master/w_960,c_limit/231106_r43282web.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653810a96d5fb099a570e146/master/w_1280,c_limit/231106_r43282web.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653810a96d5fb099a570e146/master/w_1600,c_limit/231106_r43282web.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;Some People Need Killing&lt;/strong>;&lt;em>;, by Patricia Evangelista (Random House)&lt;/em>;. In 2016, Rodrigo Duterte was elected President of the Philippines after campaigning on the promise of slaughtering three million drug addicts. In this unflinching account of the ensuing violence, a Filipina trauma journalist narrates six years of the country&#39;s drug war, during which she spent her evenings “in the mechanical absorption of organized killing.” The book, conceived as a record of extrajudicial deaths, interweaves snippets of memoir that chart Evangelista&#39;s personal evolution alongside that of her country under Duterte. In this period, she became “a citizen of a nation I cannot recognize as my own.”&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;The Boy From Kyiv Alexei Ratmansky&amp;#x27;s Life in Ballet by Marina Harss.&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653810aa2d1401d5fde68e49/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/231106_r43283web.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653810aa2d1401d5fde68e49/master/w_120,c_limit/231106_r43283web.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653810aa2d1401d5fde68e49/master/w_240,c_limit/231106_r43283web.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653810aa2d1401d5fde68e49/master/w_320,c_limit/231106_r43283web.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653810aa2d1401d5fde68e49/master/w_640,c_limit/231106_r43283web.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653810aa2d1401d5fde68e49/master/w_960,c_limit/231106_r43283web.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653810aa2d1401d5fde68e49/master/w_1280,c_limit/231106_r43283web.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653810aa2d1401d5fde68e49/master/w_1600,c_limit/231106_r43283web.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;The Boy from Kyiv&lt;/strong>;&lt;em>;, by Marina Harss (Farrar, Straus &amp;amp; Giroux)&lt;/em>;. This deft, intimate biography traces the career of Alexei Ratmansky—arguably the preëminent ballet choreographer of our time, currently in residence at New York City Ballet—and examines the tensions between traditionalism and innovation within his field. Born in St. Petersburg (then Leningrad), raised in Kyiv, and trained at the Bolshoi, Ratmansky danced with the National Ballet of Ukraine during perestroika. After the Soviet Union&#39;s dissolution, he ventured abroad to join companies in the West before eventually returning to the Bolshoi as its director. His eclectic, erudite œuvre includes a variety of original pieces—narrative, abstract, satirical—and reconstructions of classics, like “The Sleeping Beauty,” that make radical use of century-old dance notation. Harss&#39;s insightful portrait of a prolific creator highlights how Ratmansky&#39;s art reflects the frictions and the liberations of a changing world.&lt;/p>;&lt;hr />;&lt;h2 >;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/best-books-2023&quot;>;The Best Books of 2023&lt;/a>;&lt;/h2>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;Briefly Noted Book Reviews&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/63d16763c44837936a5fb854/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/bestbooks-header-2023-desktop.png&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/63d16763c44837936a5fb854/master/w_120,c_limit/bestbooks-header-2023-desktop.png 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/63d16763c44837936a5fb854/master/w_240,c_limit/bestbooks-header-2023-desktop.png 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/63d16763c44837936a5fb854/master/w_320,c_limit/bestbooks-header-2023-desktop.png 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/63d16763c44837936a5fb854/master/w_640,c_limit/bestbooks-header-2023-desktop.png 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/63d16763c44837936a5fb854/master/w_960,c_limit/bestbooks-header-2023-desktop.png 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/63d16763c44837936a5fb854/master/w_1280,c_limit/bestbooks-header-2023-desktop.png 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/63d16763c44837936a5fb854/master/w_1600,c_limit/bestbooks-header-2023-desktop.png 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;p >;&lt;em>;Read our reviews of the year&#39;s notable new fiction and nonfiction.&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>;&lt;hr />;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;Wound by Oksana Vasyakina.&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653810acd4286d891311e77d/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/231106_r43284web.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653810acd4286d891311e77d/master/w_120,c_limit/231106_r43284web.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653810acd4286d891311e77d/master/w_240,c_limit/231106_r43284web.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653810acd4286d891311e77d/master/w_320,c_limit/231106_r43284web.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653810acd4286d891311e77d/master/w_640,c_limit/231106_r43284web.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653810acd4286d891311e77d/master/w_960,c_limit/231106_r43284web.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653810acd4286d891311e77d/master/w_1280,c_limit/231106_r43284web.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653810acd4286d891311e77d/master/w_1600,c_limit/231106_r43284web.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;ko60f&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;bcb44&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;Wound&lt;/strong>;&lt;em>;, by Oksana Vasyakina, translated from the Russian by Elina Alter (Catapult)&lt;/em>;. In this affecting début novel, a narrator who resembles the author grapples with the death of her mother—her “integral wound”—and with her mother&#39;s disapproval of her lesbianism. She makes a pilgrimage through Russia, carrying her mother&#39;s ashes in an urn to be buried in their home town, in Siberia, but her grief is continually punctured by the bureaucracy of dealing with death. Drawing from Siberian legend and Greek mythology and from modern works by artists like Louise Bourgeois and Annie Leibovitz, Vasyakina meditates on time, womanhood, and sexuality, using the novel to make sense of the parent she has lost. “I feel that she is looking at the world through me,” Vasyakina writes. “I feel her inside me all the time.”&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;This is Salvaged by Vauhini Vara.&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653810add4286d891311e77f/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/231106_r43285web.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653810add4286d891311e77f/master/w_120,c_limit/231106_r43285web.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653810add4286d891311e77f/master/w_240,c_limit/231106_r43285web.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653810add4286d891311e77f/master/w_320,c_limit/231106_r43285web.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653810add4286d891311e77f/master/w_640,c_limit/231106_r43285web.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653810add4286d891311e77f/master/w_960,c_limit/231106_r43285web.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653810add4286d891311e77f/master/w_1280,c_limit/231106_r43285web.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653810add4286d891311e77f/master/w_1600,c_limit/231106_r43285web.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;This Is Salvaged&lt;/strong>;&lt;em>;, by Vauhini Vara (Norton)&lt;/em>;. The narrator of the title story in this collection is an unappreciated artist who beholds a warming planet and wishes to express that the precariousness of life is, among other things, darkly funny. This thesis propels the stories that follow. A teen-age girl avoids processing her brother&#39;s death while working above her favorite eggroll shop at an operation that sells everything from phone sex to gardening magazines. A boy who doesn&#39;t fret about technological advancements that pose a risk of alienation fantasizes about owning a car in a driverless future. The exuberant optimism of Vara&#39;s characters allows the author to approach heavy topics—predatory bosses, globalization, class difference—with levity.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;oj664&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 30 Oct 2023 18:06:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Jorge Colombo’s “Astor Place”]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cover-story/cover-story-2023-11-06]]><description>&lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-30T10:00:00.000Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653c1f796e205727eb7687cb/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/CoverStory-promo_colombo_cube.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;article >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attribute-verso-pattern=&quot;article-body&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;ArticlePageChunks&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p>;In a city as densely constructed as New York, open plazas and courtyards create havens of space—places to gather, to people-watch. And some public art works, like Tony Rosenthal&#39;s “Alamo,” anchor such spaces, providing landmarks that become synonymous with neighborhoods. The Cube, as it is affectionately called by locals and tourists alike, was placed at Lafayette and Eighth Streets in 1967, as part of an art installation intended to last only six months. Residents of the neighborhood petitioned to keep it, and—aside from brief absences—it has lent its solidity and precarious poise to the Astor Place crossroads ever since. In May, 2023, the Cube was briefly removed to be refurbished off-site, but it was returned to its position this August. I talked to Jorge Colombo, who drew the sculpture for the cover of the November 6, 2023, issue, about community, the city, and the joy of a strong sense of place.&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;What is your connection to the Astor Place neighborhood?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In 1999, when Ted Keller, the &lt;em>;Village Voice&#39;s&lt;/em>; design director, asked me to illustrate Lynn Yaeger&#39;s Street Style column, my first assignment was to draw fashion observations gleaned from watching passersby around the Cube. I was new to the city, and creating pen-and-watercolor pictures of New Yorkers made me feel like I belonged, like I was getting the details of my new place right. I lived nearby, and some of my regular spots—Other Music, St. Mark&#39;s Bookshop, Tower Records—were right there. St. Mark&#39;s was one of the East Village&#39;s liveliest venues. Astor Place has changed a lot since, yet it remains an epicenter of my personal New York.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;You now live out in the country. Do you experience fall differently?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I live on the main street of a small town. Traffic abounds, so it still feels somewhat urban. But there&#39;s one thing I don&#39;t get: that sense of fall migration, when Astor Place fills up with flocks of young people. Every fall, I would look at the crowds: different people, same wonderment. You just know that, for many of them, it&#39;s their first season in New York, and everything feels like a discovery, an adventure.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;You&#39;ve instituted drawing and photography workshops in your own town. Can you tell me more about them?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I hardly spent any time in art school myself. I know what I missed out on, but I also believe that persistence, curiosity, and enthusiasm can take you far. Even if you just introduce somebody to art or ideas they have never encountered before, that makes a difference. Mentoring can help unlock the skill and potential people have within themselves. One of the activities we do at the 108, my studio barn in Narrowsburg, New York, is drawing sessions, with models, open to people in the town. Some have art training, many of them have none at all, and the mix is invigorating. And I also love drawing on iPads with local kids. The learning curve is lightning fast: children who grew up with touch screens grasp the process very quickly, so we can move to what to do, rather than struggling with the how-to part.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;You have now two small kittens, including one who is recovering from surgery. Does caring for them affect your work at all?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The sisters Inky and Sharpie are great alarm clocks. They make sure I am at my desk at regular hours, even if that&#39;s not exactly why they wake me up so early. Fortunately, they sleep most of the day, so I still get productive stretches.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;em>;For more covers about the city, see below:&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;feature-default&quot;

The key to a successful academic career in the social sciences has long been to conduct clever, headline-grabbing, laboratory-based experiments. This type of research—especially when its results support popular theories—has near-total dominance in academic publishing, not to mention in tenure and promotion decisions. Unfortunately, as the article points out, it has little relevance to the real world. Until the academy reckons with its overvaluation of celebrity status and its elevation of certain kinds of knowledge production over others, the data-analysis group Data Colada will be plenty busy.&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;&lt;em>;Elizabeth Soliday&lt;/em>;&lt;br/>;&lt;em>;Vancouver, Wash.&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Lewis-Kraus&#39;s piece was a brilliant testament to why people like me and many of my colleagues avoid the hypercompetitive world of academic publishing. I did, however, want to quibble with his contention that “one of the confounding things about the social sciences is that observational evidence can produce only correlations.” Research based on correlational results from observational data is not unique to the social sciences. In fact, many of the physical sciences—such as astronomy and particle physics—rely on it as well, and can also suffer from replication difficulties. Observation and description are the bases of all scientific inquiry; they are, for example, how we know that the Earth orbits the sun and that smoking causes cancer in humans.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;em>;Lorin Mueller&lt;/em>;&lt;br/>;&lt;em>;Arlington, Va.&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;As the editor of a scientific journal, I was mortified to read the claims laid out in Lewis-Kraus&#39;s article. But readers should know that some areas of the behavioral and cognitive sciences have been instituting concrete reforms to make our research as transparent as possible. For example, the &lt;em>;Journal of Memory &amp;amp; Language&lt;/em>;, which I edit, requires that both raw data and analysis code be made publicly available at the time that a manuscript is submitted, and remain available in perpetuity. We encourage replication studies, and last year devoted an entire special issue to evaluating the replicability of influential findings in the areas we cover. Other journals in cognitive science have moved in the same direction in recent years.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;em>;Adrian Staub&lt;/em>;&lt;br/>;&lt;em>;Leeds, Mass. 1&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h2 >;Woman of Science?&lt;/h2>;&lt;p >;Discussing CE McGill&#39;s “Our Hideous Progeny,” Ruth Franklin notes that the novel&#39;s protagonist, a British woman interested in fossils, feels out of place because her “world has no language for a female scientist” (Books, October 9th). A word did exist, however, to describe a woman with an interest in fossils, or chemistry, or astronomy. In 1834, William Whewell, of Cambridge University, wrote about Mary Somerville, a Scottish-born researcher who brought together mathematics, astronomy, geology, chemistry, and physics into texts that became the foundation of the university&#39;s science curriculum, and he coined the word “scientist” to refer to a cultivator of science in general. Whewell noted that the phrase “man of science” seemed inappropriate in Somerville&#39;s case, not only because she was a woman but because her work was interdisciplinary in nature. Whewell wanted a word that actively celebrated what he described as “the peculiar illumination of the female mind”—the ability to synthesize separate fields into a single discipline.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;em>;Henry H.

The story starts in 1980, when Yunior is an eleven-year-old in New Jersey, having emigrated from the Dominican Republic. Why did you want to return to this time in Yunior&#39;s life?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I&#39;ve always been struck by James Baldwin&#39;s oft-quoted claim that “every writer has only one tale to tell, and he has to find a way of telling it until the meaning becomes clearer and clearer, until the story becomes at once more narrow and larger, more and more precise, more and more reverberating.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Whether this is true of me only time will tell, but there&#39;s no question that throughout my writing “career” I&#39;ve returned again and again to the eighties—a lonely, turbulent decade for me personally, and a historically important decade to boot. Who among us is not haunted by a particular time in our lives? Well, maybe some people aren&#39;t, but I am powerfully haunted by the eighties for so many damn reasons.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;On the one hand, I suffered a lot of desolation and dislocations in the eighties for reasons that are too numerous to get into here, but, by visiting versions of these agonies onto Yunior, I&#39;m able to think them through in ways that are generative to me as a person and an artist. Claude Lévi-Strauss insisted that animals are good to think with. Well, literature is also good to think with—and, more vitally, to feel with.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I also wanted to return to Yunior&#39;s stay on what he thinks of as cancer planet because I feel as though I ain&#39;t done justice to this gutting experience. No matter how often I write about that time, something of that harrowing period escapes me. In Yunior&#39;s fictional biography, his stay on cancer planet was on one hand calamitous, marred by a complete dissolution of his family: his father&#39;s departure, his brother&#39;s cancer death. In other words, his deepest losses. And yet cancer planet was also the beginning of Yunior&#39;s grownup life, his moving away from his family/neighborhood crater and into the wider US world of books, of college, of his first artistic stirrings.&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;A lot to untangle and, therefore, the compulsive revisiting.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;The political background in the Dominican Republic enters the story almost immediately. Yunior is listening to the news on the radio with his mother, or hearing his father respond to what he&#39;s reading or watching. His father is a supporter of the DR&#39;s various right-wing regimes. His uncle—his mother&#39;s brother—was a radical leftist who was killed shortly after the family moved to the US How much does Yunior grasp about the situation in the DR? What do you want the reader to understand?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Growing up, I had a lot more awareness of the political situation in the DR than Yunior does. He has no interest in the DR, really, just wants to become a white American as quickly as possible. But it&#39;s amazing what we pick up through our relations, whether we want to or not, and Yunior&#39;s bond with his mother insures that he cannot simply turn the page on the DR, that he cannot white it out and, by extension, he cannot white-out what&#39;s happening throughout Latin America and the Caribbean.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The eighties were turbulent times in the lower hemisphere, to put it mildly. We had US-backed torture regimes and civil wars and guerrilla insurgencies and right-wing counter-insurgencies and political strife of every kind. Sure, the eighties also saw the rebirth of democracy throughout the region, but what a slow, agonizing, incomplete gestation that was. The aftershocks from those &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Last-Colonial-Massacre-America-Updated/dp/0226306909&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Last-Colonial-Massacre-America-Updated/dp/0226306909&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Last-Colonial-Massacre-America-Updated/dp/0226306909&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;last colonial massacres&lt;/a>; were still fucking everything up in the eighties (not that those tremors have subsided much).&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;For a lot of the kids I grew up with, the eighties were MTV and John Hughes movies and Atari and “Miami Vice,” but for those of us who came out of the open veins of Latin America and the Caribbean our vision of the eighties was a lot more messed up, a lot more horrifying. What I heard on Spanish-language news was a world away from what English-language news was showing.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;This is part of what I was trying to depict in the story. Yunior might be desperate to be an American cyclops, to shut his homeward eye and focus only on the country he&#39;s desperate to be accepted by, but he is too immigrant for such a cognitive blinkering (too sensitive, too). In spite of his acculturation fantasies, Yunior&#39;s contact with his Colombian neighbor, and his experiences with his father&#39;s cruelties and his revolutionary uncle&#39;s death, means that the hemispheric imaginary, the ghost-colonial imaginary, possesses him, for better or worse.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;On February 27, 1980, a group of Colombian guerrillas seized the Dominican Embassy, which was throwing a party to celebrate Dominican Independence Day, and took the attendees hostage. Yunior becomes obsessed by what&#39;s happening in Colombia, and by the guerrillas themselves. When did you first think that this situation might form the precipitating event for a story?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I learned about the siege on Spanish-language news the very day it started. For Dominican news, it was &lt;em>;the&lt;/em>; story. I was more obsessed with the Iran hostage crisis at the time because that was an American problem and I was desperate to be in conversation with America, not with the Dominican Republic or Colombia. But, because I was a curious kid and because the whole thing lasted for two months, I ended up learning more about what was happening in Colombia than I might have otherwise. I was really struck by the fact that there were female revolutionaries in the mix and asked one of my teachers about it. For the life of me I cannot remember what her answer was, but sometimes the fact of the question is as important as the answer.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Anyway, that Embassy siege stayed with me. In fact, when I wrote my novel “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Brief-Wondrous-Life-Oscar-Wao/dp/1594483299&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Brief-Wondrous-Life-Oscar-Wao/dp/1594483299&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Brief-Wondrous-Life-Oscar-Wao/dp/1594483299&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;Oscar Wao&lt;/a>;,” I kept trying to wedge that in, along with Trujillo&#39;s rumored attempt to assassinate the President of Venezuela. Never worked out—until now.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;The family has a Colombian neighbor, Mr. Longo. A few years later, his brother Wilson—or Mr. Wilson, as Yunior&#39;s mother calls him—joins him, together with his son, Alberto. It&#39;s the year that Yunior&#39;s older brother is being treated for cancer, his father is mostly absent, and his mother is worried and distracted, but she becomes close to Mr. Wilson, who had been a teacher in Colombia. When you started writing the story, did you know that this friendship would blossom between the characters? Did you want to write a love story, of sorts, for Yunior&#39;s mother?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;9q4p7s&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;2gy1w&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;You hit upon the key ignition point. My own mother is nothing like the mother in my stories, but growing up there were a lot of Dominican moms of that particular generation who married once, disastrously, and then spent the rest of their lives single, without another consolatory or redemptive romance—a type of &lt;em>;viejamona&lt;/em>;. I always wondered what it would be like for someone like that to take even the most tentative steps toward romantic intimacy. And it was only when I combined that idea with the Embassy siege that everything really took off.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Side note: while I was working on the story, I listened to a lot of the albums and singers popular in the Dominican diaspora during the fifties and sixties. Songs of love and heartbreak for a generation who often knew too little about the former and too much about the latter.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;One night, Mr. Wilson drunkenly mistakes Yunior&#39;s house for his own. Yunior and his brother, fearing a burglar, confront him, with Yunior&#39;s brother brandishing one of the guns their father had left behind. How hard was it to orchestrate that scene—did you know who would end up where? Did you always know there&#39;d be a gun?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I grew up in the DR and the US, two countries that suffer no aversion to firearms. Truth is, among the many inaccuracies in my fiction are how few firearms I actually depict.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;When I started charting out the story, I was desperate for a scene in which Longo incorporates himself into Yunior&#39;s household in the worst way possible. Unconsciously, maladroitly. And I wanted the sons to react to this intrusion in the worst possible way, which would then bring out what is hidden in Longo.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The gun became a shortcut, a way of manifesting that particular history of suffering.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;That&#39;s the sorcery of guns; they can summon all the repressed and obscure violence of their users&#39; pasts. It is through our weapons that our unhealed wounds speak their hideous demotics most fluently.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;And, in a story about oppressive government violence, the appearance of a gun seemed inevitable.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;It isn&#39;t until partway through the story that we find out the significance of the title. Gloria Lara de Echeverri was a Colombian politician who, in 1982, was kidnapped and eventually murdered. In the story, investigators believe that a leftist group Mr. Wilson had once supported was involved. Yunior doesn&#39;t learn the full details until years later, long after Mr. Wilson has left the neighborhood, and the country. He&#39;s never been able to forget the sound of Mr. Wilson&#39;s scream. Do you think it&#39;s ever possible to forget the trauma of being tortured? Will Mr. Wilson&#39;s life—and even his son&#39;s—always be marked by this?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In truth, I don&#39;t know what to say. The optimistic part of me wants to believe that all who have suffered such tremendous violation can regain themselves, can heal, if only in part, by beauty, communion, compassion, bearing witness, justice, love. The legendary resilience of the African diaspora to which I belong gives me hope. My friendship with the writer Thomas Kennedy (rest in peace, my brother) gives me hope—he worked for a very long time with Rehabilitation and Research Centre for Torture Victims (RCT) in Copenhagen, which is now called the Danish Institute Against Torture (&lt;em >;DIGNITY&lt;/em>;), a collaboration that inspired his finest novel, “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Company-Angels-Novel-Thomas-Kennedy/dp/B004G09484&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Company-Angels-Novel-Thomas-Kennedy/dp/B004G09484&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Company-Angels-Novel-Thomas-Kennedy/dp/B004G09484&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;In the Company of Angels&lt;/a>;,” about a torture survivor seeking to reclaim himself. The courageous efforts of the Colombian Truth Commission, which helped inspire this story, give me hope. And, of course, my extended family, which includes a victim of torture, gives me hope.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;But I also know that our societies have not made it easy for those who have suffered torture to attain the necessary help they need, much less provided the space for them to bear witness to what they have suffered. Inge Genefke (the founder of the RCT) once said, “Half the world&#39;s population . 。 。 live in countries where the governments condone torture.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;The emotional impact of the polarized and bloody politics of the Dominican Republic and Colombia during the sixties, seventies, and eighties is felt thousands of miles away, in New Jersey. Was that always your intention in writing the story?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I&#39;m sure you&#39;re familiar with Elaine Scarry&#39;s work on torture. She writes, “It is the intense pain that destroys a person&#39;s self and world, a destruction experienced spatially as either the contraction of the universe down to the immediate vicinity of the body or as the body swelling to fill the entire universe.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Torture, Scarry argues, unmakes the individual. Under torture, time and space and self collapse. One might argue that the same happens to societies which are haunted by legacies of torture. There is nowhere and no when that is safe from that trauma, from this terrible time-travelling, universe-crossing horror. You might leave the country behind, you might not even know the relevant history, and yet the ghosts of those crimes will find you nevertheless.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;You recently started a Substack, called &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://junot.substack.com/&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://junot.substack.com/&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://junot.substack.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;StoryWorlds&lt;/a>;, which you describe as “Reflections on fiction and worldbuilding, on diasporas and elsewhere.” How often are you posting?

I&#39;m a private person by nature, never had a blog, never felt tempted by the compulsive confessionalism of our social-media moment. And yet I keep being asked by people who cannot take writing workshops with me to share some of my insights about writing. Given how little I write and how often I fail at writing, I am surprised anyone would ask me about writing, but people continue to do so.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;65sec&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Important context: I&#39;ve been a teacher for nearly thirty years and despite having had opportunities to focus on my super-slow writing I&#39;ve never been able to do only that.为什么？ I guess I am possessed by the Maya Angelou imperative: when you learn, teach. Slow writer or not, the truth is that I do know a few things about writing, and recently it dawned on me that I&#39;m fifty-four—if I&#39;m going to share what little I&#39;ve learned, now is the time. And so I&#39;ve been on the &#39;Stack talking about my odd writing techniques and philosophies in the hope that they will help somebody—that at least one person might feel accompanied in this lonely journey we call writing.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I recently noted in a post that writing is a faith-based initiative. So, equally, is teaching. I might not have a lot of books to my name, but for the time being I do have faith—in literature, in reading, in learning, in my African diasporic communities, in justice—and my Substack page is the tabernacle where my faith expresses itself, and where I wrestle with its limitations. Perhaps this experiment will amount to little more than a bunch of bizarre scribbles signifying nothing, or perhaps it will be a record of my covenant with the word and the world. ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;axwc1r&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 30 Oct 2023 18:06:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[The Twilight of Prestige Television]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/11/06/the-twilight-of-prestige-television]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-30T10:00:00.000Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65393ba1df440a683d0eb619/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/231106_r43281.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;article >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attribute-verso-pattern=&quot;article-body&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;ArticlePageChunks&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;When did “prestige TV” jump the shark, or maybe just get chomped up in its jaws? Flip around for something to watch, and you&#39;ll find star-crammed absurdities (“The Morning Show,” “Only Murders in the Building”), IP-brand extensions (“Wednesday,” “Obi-Wan Kenobi”), “Yellowstone” spinoffs, or, under the banner of the once genre-busting HBO, rehashes of better shows (“House of the Dragon,” “And Just Like That . . .”). When a worthy new series breaks out (“Reservation Dogs,” “The Bear”), it feels like an anomaly, and just as many get prematurely cancelled (“A League of Their Own,” “Winning Time”). Many streaming services are cutting costs and curbing output while casting around for the broadest possible audience. We used to say that twenty-first-century TV was like the nineteenth-century novel—instead of staring at the idiot box, we were communing with Dickens or Zola!—but at some point that stopped seeming true.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;What happened? One answer is what always happens: golden ages never last. Just look at the New Hollywood of the late nineteen-sixties and seventies, which gave us such boundary-pushing classics as “Midnight Cowboy,” “The Godfather,” and “Taxi Driver.” “At its most ambitious, the New Hollywood was a movement intended to cut film free of its evil twin, commerce, enabling it to fly high through the thin air of art,” Peter Biskind writes in “Easy Riders, Raging Bulls: How the Sex-Drugs-and-Rock &#39;n&#39; Roll Generation Saved Hollywood” (1998), his rollicking overview of the era. In the late sixties, Biskind recounts, the crumbling studios were held in the “rigor-mortis-like grip” of aging moguls who had no idea how to speak to a young audience. That left an opening for counterculture hits like “Bonnie and Clyde” and “Easy Rider,” Dennis Hopper&#39;s hippie motorcycle odyssey, which made sixty million dollars on a six-figure budget. Upstart auteurs—Martin Scorsese, Robert Altman, Francis Ford Coppola—had the run of the town. Bewildered executives were suddenly barking, “Get me the next &#39;Godfather&#39;!”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Then, as Biskind tells us, the “movie brats” Steven Spielberg and George Lucas came along with “Jaws” and “Star Wars,” which restored the reign of commerce, complete with sequels and Luke Skywalker action figures. Of course, commerce had never really left; it had just lost its footing, except in the case of a few producers—Bert Schneider, Robert Evans—hip enough to bottle the counterculture. In the late seventies, the business reoriented itself, with the rise of the mega-agencies ICM and CAA and of a new breed of executive (Michael Eisner, Barry Diller). Many of the renegade directors self-destructed in a blaze of coke and ego, or joined the counter-revolution of the blockbuster eighties.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;GenericCallout&quot;>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;external-link-embed--inline&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;a aria-label=&quot;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;The Best Books We Read This Week&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.newyorker.com/best-books-2023&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/best-books-2023&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;&lt;span >;&lt;strong>;The Best Books We Read This Week&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/a>;&lt;p >;&lt;em>;Read our reviews of notable new fiction and nonfiction, updated every Wednesday.&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;a aria-label=&quot;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;The Best Books We Read This Week&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.newyorker.com/best-books-2023&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/best-books-2023&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/63c800e4e99d89b838ada996/1:1/w_200%2Cc_limit/undefined&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/63c800e4e99d89b838ada996/1:1/w_120,c_limit/undefined 120w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/a>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Biskind, a longtime contributor to &lt;em>;Vanity Fair&lt;/em>; and one of Hollywood&#39;s shrewdest chroniclers, followed “Easy Riders, Raging Bulls” with “Down and Dirty Pictures: Miramax, Sundance, and the Rise of Independent Film” (2004), another panorama of a short-lived creative efflorescence. In the late eighties, Steven Soderbergh&#39;s “Sex, Lies, and Videotape” came out of the US Film Festival (the future Sundance) and kick-started a movement of grungy, low-budget indies that counterbalanced Hollywood bloat. Harvey Weinstein&#39;s Miramax acquired the film and used it, along with Gen X hits like Kevin Smith&#39;s “Clerks,” to break out of the “art-house ghetto.” The big money followed: Disney acquired Miramax for sixty million dollars; “Pulp Fiction” became the first indie to pass the hundred-million mark; and “Indiewood” was born, with Fox Searchlight and Sony Pictures Classics competing on the film-festival circuit. (“Get me the next &#39;Pulp Fiction&#39;!”) By the turn of the millennium, Miramax was spending big on middlebrow fare like “The Cider House Rules” and “Kate &amp;amp; Leopold,” the kind of stuff the studios made. As Soderbergh laments to Biskind, “The independent film movement, as we knew it, just doesn&#39;t exist anymore.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Like many Hollywood sagas, Biskind&#39;s turns out to be a trilogy. His latest book, “Pandora&#39;s Box: How Guts, Guile, and Greed Upended TV” (William Morrow), explains, in punchy, propulsive prose, how we went from Tony Soprano to Ted Lasso. Biskind&#39;s turn to television is telling: the movies, he sighs, are stuck in “superhero monoculture.” Soderbergh, who directed the Cinemax series “The Knick,” reappears to complain, “The audience for the kinds of movies I grew up liking has migrated to television.” Not network television, mind you—Biskind dismisses it, somewhat ungenerously, as “a measureless tract of hard, cracked soil, inhospitable to intelligent life”—but the other kind, starting with HBO.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Michael Fuchs, who joined the pay-cable company in 1976 and was fired in 1995, tells Biskind that he set out to produce counterprogramming to the stuff put out by the “homogenized, fake” broadcast networks. Freed of the standards-and-practices departments that kept the networks neutered, he put on boxing matches and risqué docuseries such as “Real Sex,” all geared toward men. “HBO was an insurgency,” Fuchs says. By the mid-nineties, it was expanding into edgy original series, including “Oz,” a prison drama whose pilot ends with a main character getting burned alive—not exactly “Touched by an Angel.” “Oz” primed audiences for “The Sopranos,” which premièred in 1999 and completed HBO&#39;s metamorphosis, as Biskind writes, “from a fighting-and-fondling irritant to the networks into the Rolls-Royce of cable.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;We meet the three HBO Davids: Chase, Simon, and Milch—the headstrong, high-strung men who reinvented the Mob drama (“The Sopranos”), the crime procedural (“The Wire”), and the Western (“Deadwood”), respectively. Biskind is skilled at the quick character sketch. Chase, he writes, “is a slender man, with deep-set eyes, a broad expanse of forehead, and a mouth that alternates between wry amusement and a frown, as if he has bitten into a lemon.” With “The Sopranos,” Chase ushered in a serialized format that prized moral ambiguity and rewarded patient viewing. “On network, everybody says exactly what they&#39;re thinking,” he tells Biskind. “I wanted my characters to be telling lies.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;The “Sopranos” writers&#39; room could reflect the sort of scheming that defined its onscreen characters; Biskind calls it “a hellhole of competitiveness and backbiting.” Midway through the sixth season, Chase abruptly fired the writer Robin Green, like Tony whacking Big Pussy. In “Deadwood,” Milch projected himself onto the Old West impresario Jack Langrishe (Brian Cox), “who was supposed to illustrate the power of the artist over the power of the capitalist,” Biskind writes. Of course, the talent-versus-suits morality tale that undergirds Biskind&#39;s books is never that clean. HBO cancelled “Deadwood” after three seasons, citing its high budget, but Cox recalls someone describing its demise as a “Jewish pissing contest” between the volatile Milch and HBO&#39;s chairman and CEO, Chris Albrecht. If the rising television auteurs were the new Coppolas and Altmans, they could be just as power-mad and self-immolating. The shows of HBO&#39;s golden age offered stories of brutal patriarchies headed by charismatic antiheroes, which is what HBO was, too. In May, 2007, Albrecht was arrested for choking his girlfriend in the parking lot of a Las Vegas hotel, and resigned. (Three years later, he was running Starz.)&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;HBO, meanwhile, was flush with money, top-heavy with executives, and the envy of Hollywood. (“Get me the next &#39;Sopranos&#39;!”) After “The Sopranos” ended, in 2007, HBO had a dearth of juggernauts; Milch followed up “Deadwood” with the disastrous “John from Cincinnati.” The drought ended in 2011, with the arrival of “Game of Thrones.” But rivals were already filling the void. Showtime realized that women could be antiheroes, and put out “Weeds” and “Homeland.” Basic cable had entered the fray. FX had the tough guys of “The Shield” and “Justified.” AMC, which had been a second-rate Turner Classic Movies, picked up “Mad Men” after HBO passed on Matthew Weiner&#39;s pilot, and then followed it with Vince Gilligan&#39;s “Breaking Bad.” For a time, AMC was hot—until it zombified itself into a “Walking Dead” spinoff factory.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;HBO, defending its turf, scooped up big-name authors and directors, among them Margaret Atwood and Noah Baumbach, in what the industry terms “schmuck insurance”; the development deals meant that HBO wouldn&#39;t see a project it rejected being peddled elsewhere and possibly becoming a hit. The risk-taking era was receding. Albrecht&#39;s successor Richard Plepler tells Biskind, “We were under tremendous pressure to deliver more and more money to an earnings-based corporation that prevented us from expanding our programming, and that was just the reality of being part of Time Warner.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The story of these turbulent masterminds and their antihero doubles has been told in any number of books, including, ten years ago, Brett Martin&#39;s “Difficult Men,” which critics compared to “Easy Riders, Raging Bulls.” Biskind has the benefit of having waited to see the other side of Peak TV&#39;s peak. In retrospect, a pivotal moment came in 2011, when David Fincher was shopping around “House of Cards,” about another seductive antihero: a devious congressman who plots his way into the Oval Office—and who, in his first scene, kills a dog. “I don&#39;t spend any time in DC, but I spend a lot of time in Hollywood,” Fincher would tell people. “If you&#39;re talking about hubris and venality, they&#39;re not that different.” The show&#39;s natural home was HBO, which offered to shoot the pilot and see. Fincher had lined up big stars, Kevin Spacey and Robin Wright, and wanted a thirteen-episode commitment. That wasn&#39;t the way business was done, certainly not at HBO, which was mired, Biskind says, in “internecine warfare, bad calls, and overdevelopment.” Then Fincher got an offer that blew HBO out of the water: a hundred million dollars for not one but two full seasons. It came from Netflix.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;The company was founded in the late nineties, by the computer scientist Reed Hastings and the entrepreneur Marc Rudolph. Hastings, according to Rudolph, wanted to create “the Amazon.com of something.” Rudolph suggested home video. Netflix amassed subscribers by mailing out DVDs. It began streaming in 2007. Hastings, convinced that he could mine user data to pinpoint what customers wanted to watch, started researching “taste clusters.” He spent one family ski vacation holed up in a Park City chalet, tinkering with his algorithm. The studios kept licensing out content, thinking little of it. David Zaslav, now the CEO of Warner Bros. Discovery, tells Biskind, “They fed Netflix when Netflix looked like a harmless animal. And then they were stuck having to continue to feed it, when it was clear that Netflix was a beast.” In 2010, Jeff Bewkes, the CEO of HBO&#39;s parent company, Time Warner, made one of those deathless “We&#39;ll be greeted as liberators” statements when he said, of Netflix, “Is the Albanian Army going to take over the world? I don&#39;t think so.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;With “House of Cards,” which premièred in early 2013, Netflix established itself as a purveyor of original series to rival HBO&#39;s. Jenji Kohan&#39;s “Orange Is the New Black” came later that year, helping to boost Netflix&#39;s stock price five hundred and sixty-six per cent. For both shows, Netflix dropped the entire first season at once, creating a model of viewership known as binge-watching. The Albanian Army had arrived. Showrunners flocked to this newfound haven of creative freedom, which seemed willing to throw money at something weird or dark. “Before you knew it, you had a revolution within the revolution,” Biskind writes.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In Peak TV terms, consider the opening map from “Game of Thrones”: HBO was the arrogant Lannister clan of King&#39;s Landing; FX and AMC were the brooding Starks of the North; and Netflix was the Targaryens, invading from across the sea with the help of a fire-breathing dragon—Hastings&#39;s algorithm. Now Big Tech got in the game: Amazon premièred “Transparent” on its streaming service in 2014; Apple launched Apple TV+ in 2019, bearing “The Morning Show.” The tech giants “flooded the streaming space with money,” Biskind writes. But, as the FX chief John Landgraf, who coined the term “Peak TV,” tells him, “you don&#39;t make art just by throwing money at it.” The legacy studios sprinted into the streaming wars, with Disney+, Paramount+, and Peacock. WarnerMedia funnelled HBO—along with DC superheroes and other properties—into HBO Max, designed to reach a broader audience than the premium-cable mother ship. The merger of Warner Bros. and Discovery, in 2022, turned Zaslav into a Hollywood power player. In a twist that the author of “Easy Riders, Raging Bulls” might have found a little on the nose, Zaslav had acquired the storied home from which Robert Evans ran Paramount during its New Hollywood renaissance.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Zaslav lacked his predecessor&#39;s palate, though. His streaming outlet, renamed Max, is now the place, Biskind laments, “where you go to watch Batman spinoffs” or reruns of “Gossip Girl.” Fuchs delivers the eulogy. “This is a fifty-year-old company,” he told Biskind last year. “I consider that it died at fifty. There&#39;s no longer an HBO.” But all the outlets were getting more cautious. In the spring of 2022, Netflix told its investors that it had lost two hundred thousand subscribers in the year&#39;s first quarter, and its value plummeted. The “Great Netflix Correction” effectively ended streaming&#39;s roll-the-dice era, and although Netflix itself recovered, its debt-saddled competitors were running scared. Hungry for subscribers, the streamers developed an “allergy to risk,” Biskind observes, leaning harder on preëxisting IP, movie stars, and comfort viewing. Netflix and Amazon recruited executives from network TV, with the goal, in Biskind&#39;s words, of “reaching as big an audience as cheaply as possible.” Now the algorithm rules us all.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Pandora&#39;s Box” is as unsparing as “Easy Riders, Raging Bulls,” and the thesis of the two books is the same: Hollywood&#39;s golden ages don&#39;t arise from the miraculous congregation of geniuses. The industry&#39;s default setting is for crap. Occasionally, the incentives change just enough to allow a cascade of innovation, but those incentives inevitably shift back to the norm. Many streamers, including Netflix, are now launching ad-supported tiers, meaning that they&#39;ll be answerable to the same sponsors that propped up the networks. We&#39;ve come full circle. “The post-network streaming world could turn out to look very much like the pre-streaming broadcast world,” Biskind concludes. “Instead of the Big Four networks, we might see Big Five Streamers.” Fewer protagonists are likely to murder a dog.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Then again, what if something else has been happening, something not cyclical but transformative? Midway through “Pandora&#39;s Box,” the shows under discussion signal a vibe shift. “The Sopranos” and its progeny of ruthless male antiheroes give way to “Orange Is the New Black,” “Girls,” “Insecure,” “Transparent,” and “I May Destroy You”—shows that empowered female, queer, and Black creators and offered complicated protagonists reflecting a wider range of identities.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;This, too, tracked a change in the marketplace: suddenly, it was seen as good business to diversify the screen, even if C-suites stayed demographically stagnant. Amid the backstabbing boys&#39; clubs, “Pandora&#39;s Box” is littered with talented female executives who were unceremoniously ousted, including Carolyn Strauss at HBO, Cindy Holland at Netflix, and Christina Wayne at AMC. “It was the most devastating thing that had ever happened to me,” Wayne recalls of her firing, in 2009. “And may they rot in hell, is all I can say.” Matthew Weiner was also appalled at Wayne&#39;s dismissal. According to Wayne, he lambasted the male executives at a black-tie event for “Mad Men,” saying, “You just didn&#39;t want her there because your penises are too small.”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;8bzmq9&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;jgfmmp&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Not that Weiner himself comes off well. “There was often drinking and getting high after five or six, and I really felt like he was recapitulating the atmosphere of the show,” the writer Marti Noxon tells Biskind. “He wanted to be Don Draper, and he&#39;s not. The women just fell into Don Draper&#39;s arms, but with Matt it was manipulation and power, targeting people about their bodies and their sexuality day in, day out, and an assumption that you have to play to his good side.” In late 2017, another “Mad Men” writer, Kater Gordon, accused Weiner of sexual harassment, a claim he denied.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;In “Pandora&#39;s Box,” the #MeToo movement is a passing plot development. But it&#39;s the engine behind Maureen Ryan&#39;s galvanizing “Burn It Down: Power, Complicity, and a Call for Change in Hollywood” (Mariner). In her view, “a lot of beliefs and norms still enshrouding Hollywood are in dire need of reboots,” first and foremost the notion that “creative people are &#39;temperamental,&#39; and that that word—along with &#39;passionate,&#39; &#39;driven,&#39; and &#39;difficult&#39;—automatically encompasses some terrible things.” Ryan reports on a variety of “toxic” workplaces, among them the producer Scott Rudin&#39;s office and the writers&#39; room for “Lost,” unveiling a horror show of “nightmare narcissists, well-connected incompetents, and garden-variety abusers,” along with the corporate instinct to silence victims and maintain business as usual.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Ryan—like Biskind, a longtime entertainment reporter and a &lt;em>;Vanity Fair&lt;/em>; contributor—focusses less on the machinations of high-powered monsters than on the assistants and junior writers who endured their misbehavior. She says that hearing about Hollywood&#39;s abuses for years left her in a “haze of exhaustion and fear.” Aaron Sorkin&#39;s half-hearted response to Rudin&#39;s alleged workplace bullying gave her “rage migraines.” But she&#39;s had enough, and now she&#39;s lighting a match.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Among the myths that Ryan wishes to torch is “the Myth of a Golden Age.” “The vast majority of the most buzzed-about Golden Age shows featured heterosexual white dudes at the center of their sagas, which was, honestly, just a continuation of what Hollywood had been doing forever,” she writes. In 2014, as a TV critic for the Huffington Post, she wrote a piece titled “Who Creates Drama at HBO? Very Few Women or People of Color.” A high-level executive from the company e-mailed her, saying that the headline was unfair and asking her to change it. She refused.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In a section on “Toxic Myths Around Creativity,” Ryan takes on “Easy Riders, Raging Bulls” itself. “Throughout the book, women (and some men) sigh at a wide array of Creative Guy antics like these, many of which were fueled by insecurity and rivalry, not to mention drugs and alcohol,” she writes. “I have talked to so many people who have encountered various flavors of miserable-prick energy throughout their industry careers, and they are, in a word, &lt;em>;tired&lt;/em>;.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;To be fair, “Easy Riders, Raging Bulls” doesn&#39;t set out to glamorize the misbehavior of the New Hollywood, but no doubt some of its readers—especially aspirants who go to LA planning to be the next Dennis Hopper—see what they want to see. In that sense, Biskind has something in common with David Chase, who viewed “The Sopranos” as a show “about evil” and was disturbed by the subset of fans who wanted “less yakking, more whacking.” If Biskind, like Chase, lays out a sprawling, amoral ecosystem with the dispassion of an omniscient narrator, Ryan is more akin to Michaela Coel, the creator and star of “I May Destroy You”: personal, indignant, and unimpressed by “big-swinging-dick” behavior. Ryan is also more hopeful, despite the rage migraines. Where “Pandora&#39;s Box” mourns the end of an era, Ryan sees “the beginning stages of the entertainment industry&#39;s shift to better models.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Both books bring Hollywood&#39;s recent history to the precipice of the double strike of the writers&#39; and actors&#39; guilds. For Biskind, whose book goes up to the start of the writers&#39; strike, in May, the picket lines are one more sign of the devolution of Peak TV. Ryan&#39;s book went to press earlier, and it only hints at the labor clash to come. But she&#39;s attuned to the conditions that led to it: “The shred of hope that many used to nurture—that a job on a twenty-two-episode show might provide a measure of job security—is, for many, pretty much gone.” Maybe a Hollywood that&#39;s more equitable and less in thrall to “temperamental geniuses” will bring its own kind of golden age. “I want to burn Hollywood down some days, I really do,” Ryan writes. “And then I fall in love with a TV show or a movie and I want to know everything about it.” ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;qsjyes&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 30 Oct 2023 18:06:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Rebuilding Maui in the Aftermath of the Fire]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/11/06/maui-wildfire-response-recovery]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-30T10:00:00.000Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653abeae763674b88ec88cad/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/231106_r43275.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;article >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attribute-verso-pattern=&quot;article-body&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;ArticlePageChunks&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;At 4 &lt;em >;PM&lt;/em>;. on August 8th, Shaun Saribay&#39;s family begged him to get in their car and leave the town of Lahaina, on the Hawaiian island of Maui. The wind was howling, and large clouds of smoke were approaching from the dry hills above the neighborhood. But Saribay—a tattooist, a contractor, and a landlord, who goes by the nickname Buge—told his family that he was staying to guard their house, which had been in the family for generations. “This thing just gonna pass that way, downwind,” Saribay said. At 4:05 &lt;em >;PM&lt;/em>;., one of his daughters texted from the car, “Daddy please be safe.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Within ten minutes, it became clear that the fire had not passed downwind. Instead, towering flames were galloping toward Saribay&#39;s house. He got in his truck and drove to Front Street—Lahaina&#39;s historic waterfront drag—and found gridlock traffic. Saribay, a stocky forty-two-year-old man with a tattoo covering the left side of his face, texted his daughters. “Don&#39;t worry. Dad&#39;s coming,” he wrote. Then he lost cell service. At 4:41 &lt;em >;PM&lt;/em>;., he pulled into the one large open space he could find, a parking lot behind the Lahaina United Methodist Church, which had just started to burn.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Saribay had recently built a closet at the church, so he knew where all the water spigots were. He filled buckets and water bottles and scrambled to find neighbors&#39; garden hoses. With the help of three other men who had retreated to the lot, he soaked the church, again and again, fighting a three-story ball of fire with the equivalent of a water gun. At times, the men were stomping, even peeing, on sparking debris. Saribay recorded a video for his kids: “It&#39;s bad. All around—crazy,” he said, panning the hellscape behind him. “Remember what Dad said, eh? I&#39;ll come back.” Almost as if to reassure himself, he added, softly, “I know you guys safe.”&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;Shaun Saribay a tattooist and landlord lost three houses his tattoo parlor and his boat in the fire.

He has become a hero in the community, after he helped keep the neighborhood of Leiali&#39;i from burning down.&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;p >;Saribay recorded videos throughout the night as he fought the fire. Despite his efforts, flames consumed the church. Well after midnight, the men tried to save a neighboring preschool, but that caught fire, too. When the sun rose and the wind began to ebb, Saribay got on an old bike and rode around town looking for other survivors. “I&#39;m seeing fucking bodies every fucking way,” he recalled. “I&#39;m pedalling through charcoal bodies and bodies that didn&#39;t have one speck of burn—they just died from inhalation of black smoke. I felt like I was the only fucking human on earth.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The wildfire in Lahaina was the deadliest in the United States in more than a century. Ninety-nine people have been confirmed deceased, although for weeks the death toll was thought to be even higher, with police reporting that more than a hundred bodies had been recovered. In a town of nearly thirteen thousand people, at least seventy-two hundred were displaced. Twenty-two hundred structures were damaged or destroyed, and the estimated cost to rebuild is five and a half billion dollars. “I have been to most major disasters in the United States in the past decade. This is unprecedented,” Brad Kieserman, a senior official with the American Red Cross, said. “The speed of the fire, the level of fatality and physical destruction, the level of trauma to those who survived—it&#39;s unspeakable.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The destruction may have been unprecedented, but the fire itself was not. Public-safety officials, scientists, and activists had warned for years of the wildfire risks in Maui, owing to the growing population and the dryness of the island. “It was a ticking time bomb,” Willy Carter, a conservationist who studies native Hawaiian ecosystems, said. “The bomb went off.” Weeks before the disaster, conditions in parts of the state had been categorized as “severe drought,” and on August 4th the National Weather Service warned of hazardous fire conditions in the coming days. With a high-pressure system north of Hawaii and Hurricane Dora spinning hundreds of miles to the south, forecasters predicted that strong winds would be blowing, allowing flames to spread fast.&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;At 12:22 &lt;em >;AM&lt;/em>;. on August 8th, a brush fire ignited in Olinda, in the mountains of Central Maui, prompting evacuations. At 6:37 &lt;em >;AM&lt;/em>;., thirty-six miles away, another brush fire ignited, in a bone-dry field bordering Lahaina Intermediate School. Hard winds had toppled utility poles, and flying sparks from downed power lines likely started the blaze. (The official cause is still under investigation, according to the Maui Fire Department.) Nearby residents were ordered to evacuate within three minutes. By 10 &lt;em >;AM&lt;/em>;, the county announced, via Facebook, that the Lahaina fire was “100% contained,” but that a main road was closed.&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot;

With the wind gusting more than seventy miles per hour, the fire had flared up again in the same area. During the next hour, the fire hit “crossover”—a term used to describe a moment when the relative humidity drops below the temperature in Celsius. This allowed the blaze to tumble freely and grow exponentially faster, exceeding firefighters&#39; capabilities. All they could do was try to save lives.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;It would be difficult to overstate the horror of these hours, the disorientation of the hazy twilight caused by toxic smoke, the searing wind and glowing ash, the stark terror of being surrounded by tall flames, the suffocation. At various times, Maui police, in coördination with the power company, closed most of the roads out of town, because of tangles of downed lines and branches, but also because of a fear that some of those roads would direct people into the fire. Evacuees were herded onto Front Street, where traffic was at a standstill. Some people abandoned their vehicles and hurled themselves into the ocean. The water&#39;s surface itself seemed to be smoking, making it hard to breathe. One group held on to wreckage that had fallen in the water; others waded for hours, trying to dodge or douse the embers falling on their heads.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;By 7 &lt;em >;PM&lt;/em>;., the docks and boats in the harbor were lit up as if in a coal-fired oven, the roar of the flames broken by a staccato of exploding propane tanks. In the ocean, the current was pulling weaker swimmers out to sea. Coast Guard boats were crisscrossing the water, barely able to see through the smoke. They ultimately rescued seventeen people from the water and forty from the shore, and recovered one body the next day.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;During the fire, the county&#39;s command-and-communication system fell apart. The county sent one emergency cell-phone evacuation alert at 4:16 &lt;em >;PM&lt;/em>;., after the fire was already moving through town, but the order was just for a single neighborhood. At 6:03 &lt;em >;PM&lt;/em>;., while the fire was incinerating Front Street, and while people were struggling in the sea, Maui County&#39;s mayor, Richard Bissen, appeared on a local news broadcast, calmly sitting in his office on the other side of the island. “I&#39;m happy to report that the road is open to and from Lahaina,” he said, seemingly unaware of the inferno under way. The county did not issue online evacuation orders for other parts of town until 9:45 &lt;em >;PM&lt;/em>;. The winds finally subsided at dawn.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Maui was formed by two shield volcanoes about two million years ago, becoming the second-largest island in the Hawaiian archipelago, the most remote chain of inhabited islands on earth. Lahaina, which means “cruel sun,” sits on the leeward side of Maui, below the western mountains, Mauna Kahālāwai, which roughly translates to “house of water.” The highest peak is one of the wettest places in the world, historically receiving about three hundred and sixty-six inches of rain per year.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Hawaiians built their communities around the watershed. Their word for water, &lt;em>;wai&lt;/em>;, has many meanings: blood, passion, life. Lahaina—even though it was relatively hot and dry—became, because of its water supply, a cornucopia, replete with irrigated breadfruit, banana, and sugarcane crops, terraced taro patches, and fishponds. In the early nineteenth century, Lahaina was the capital of the Hawaiian Kingdom. The king lived in a coral-block palace on an island in the middle of a pond. Residents could paddle around town.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;GenericCallout&quot;>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;GroupCalloutWrapper&quot;>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;An empty white plastic chair sits on a lawn.&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653abef2763674b88ec88caf/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/231106_r43296.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653abef2763674b88ec88caf/master/w_120,c_limit/231106_r43296.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653abef2763674b88ec88caf/master/w_240,c_limit/231106_r43296.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653abef2763674b88ec88caf/master/w_320,c_limit/231106_r43296.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653abef2763674b88ec88caf/master/w_640,c_limit/231106_r43296.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653abef2763674b88ec88caf/master/w_960,c_limit/231106_r43296.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653abef2763674b88ec88caf/master/w_1280,c_limit/231106_r43296.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653abef2763674b88ec88caf/master/w_1600,c_limit/231106_r43296.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;Alfredo Galinato, a seventy-nine-year-old Filipino immigrant, died in the fire.

But sugarcane is a thirsty crop. One ton of sugar requires a million gallons of water. To meet that demand, private companies producing sugar (and, later, pineapples) rerouted the flow from Maui&#39;s watersheds, building concrete ditches, tunnels, pipes, flumes, siphons, and trestles across the island. European ranchers introduced non-native, drought-resistant African grasses—guinea, molasses, and buffel—for grazing livestock. In less than five decades, the island&#39;s landscape and ecology were dramatically altered.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Agriculture declined in the late twentieth century, and plantation owners abandoned vast swaths of farmland, allowing the non-native grasses to proliferate. Instead of restoring the steep mountain streams, they left their diversions in place—in some cases, dumping water into dry gulches, or directly into the ocean—or used them to develop beachfront resorts, with lush gardens, swimming pools, and golf courses. By 1996, as Carol Wilcox writes in her chronicle “Sugar Water,” “competition for water had met the limits of the resource in Lahaina.” That same year, the newly formed West Maui Land Company started buying abandoned plantations (and their valuable irrigation systems) and creating new subdivisions.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Natural wildfire on Maui used to be rare. The high-elevation endemic forest acted like a sponge—capturing fog and rain, recharging aquifers, and releasing water downstream. But land development and the encroachment of invasive species are shrinking this ecosystem. “Towns are now, instead, surrounded by tinder-dry invasive grasses that just go up in an instant,” Carter told me.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In the past decade, Maui has faced periods of severe drought, exacerbated by climate change. Parts of the island got so dry during the past two years that the county limited residential water use. Hotels did not face restrictions. Fodor&#39;s Travel included Maui on its 2023 “No List,” which warns against visiting regions that are suffering from environmental threats. And yet tourism in Maui remained steady.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;1isfx&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Native-Hawaiian-sovereignty groups have long been fighting for stream restoration and more water control. According to the state constitution and a series of landmark court cases, Hawaii&#39;s water must be held in a public trust for the people&#39;s benefit, which includes the use of water for traditional and customary practices, such as taro farming. Private developers are required to follow streamflow standards, and must get approvals from the state&#39;s Commission on Water Resource Management if they want to divert more water than their usual allotment.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;On August 10th, as fires in Olinda continued to burn, the governor, Josh Green, suspended the water code. The same day, Glenn Tremble, a partner at the West Maui Land Company, wrote a letter to the water commission stating that on August 8th he had asked to divert stream water to the company&#39;s reservoirs, south of Lahaina, to help put out the flames. A water commission deputy director named M. Kaleo Manuel delayed the diversion until that evening, explaining that Tremble first needed to check with a downstream taro farmer who relied on the stream to fight fire on his property.&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;Josue Garcia Vargas leans against a tree overlooking the water.&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653abefbf925b1d500f53349/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/231106_r43298.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653abefbf925b1d500f53349/master/w_120,c_limit/231106_r43298.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653abefbf925b1d500f53349/master/w_240,c_limit/231106_r43298.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653abefbf925b1d500f53349/master/w_320,c_limit/231106_r43298.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653abefbf925b1d500f53349/master/w_640,c_limit/231106_r43298.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653abefbf925b1d500f53349/master/w_960,c_limit/231106_r43298.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653abefbf925b1d500f53349/master/w_1280,c_limit/231106_r43298.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653abefbf925b1d500f53349/master/w_1600,c_limit/231106_r43298.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;Three children died in the Lahaina fire. Josue Garcia Vargas, pictured above, lost his brother, fourteen-year-old Keyiro Fuentes, who was at home, asleep with the family dog, when the blaze swept onto the street.&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;p >;That stream is not connected to the county&#39;s water network, which supplies Lahaina&#39;s fire-hydrant system. Moreover, the day&#39;s heavy winds meant that helicopters could not use those reservoirs to fill water bombs (known as Bambi Buckets)—they could not fly at all. Still, many were eager to blame the Native Hawaiian water deputy and, by extension, the water code. (A headline in the New York &lt;em>;Post&lt;/em>; read, “Hawaii official concerned with &#39;equity&#39; delayed releasing water for more than 5 hours as wildfires raged.”) Manuel was reassigned to another department.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Peter Martin, West Maui Land&#39;s co-founder and CEO, told me that protecting water for Native Hawaiian cultural practices was “a crock of shit,” and that invasive grasses and “this stupid climate-change thing” had “nothing to do with the fire.” He felt unfairly demonized by activists: “They&#39;re trying to paint this picture that I&#39;m a colonialist.” The real problem, he said, was the water commission and its code, which was so overbearing that it prevented him from replacing dry grassland with irrigated, landscaped parcels, or even small hobby farms. Maui&#39;s lands, he added, “weren&#39;t being used as God intended.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Sixteen days after the fire, Maui County, with help from the FBI, released a list of three hundred and eighty-eight missing people. This was a distillation of a larger list, with more than a thousand names, that had been assembled from potentially unreliable sources—online groups, anonymous calls—and contained redundancies and errors. (Many individuals had the strange experience of seeing the list and learning that the FBI thought they were missing.) The estimated death toll had remained the same since August 21st, when the police announced that they had recovered a hundred and fifteen bodies.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Two blocks from Saribay&#39;s house, Alfredo Galinato, a seventy-nine-year-old Filipino immigrant, had lived with his wife, Virginia, and their son James, who is mentally disabled. When the fire approached, Galinato told James to run to Safeway, where Virginia worked. Then Galinato climbed onto his roof with a hose to soak the house, just as he had done during previous fires. Virginia and James survived, but Galinato was now among the missing. His two other sons, Joshua and John, who were not in Lahaina on August 8th, went to the burn zone to look for their father. “Everything was burned to dust,” Joshua told me. After searching for seventy-two hours, they heard that authorities were collecting DNA samples from people with missing relatives, and they went to a community center to get their cheeks swabbed.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Following the fire, forensic anthropologists, dentists, pathologists, and fingerprint and X-ray technicians flew to Maui, to aid the overwhelmed coroner&#39;s office. Urban search-and-rescue teams, deployed by &lt;em >;FEMA&lt;/em>;, started working with cadaver dogs across the five and a half square miles that had burned.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The Lahaina fire reached temperatures more than a thousand degrees hotter than the temperature on Venus. Four thousand vehicles were caught in the flames, and almost none of them were left with tire rims. “There were rivers of melted aluminum down the streets,” Stephen Bjune, the spokesperson for &lt;em >;FEMA&lt;/em>;&#39;s Urban Search and Rescue Team, told me. But the fire also moved in mysterious ways. A truck on Front Street had been full of glass bottles for recycling, all of which melted. Five feet away, a single silver minivan was unmarred, as if it were still sitting in traffic.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;It was so hot in the burn zone that the dogs could work only in quarter-hour shifts. About fifteen per cent of the discovered remains were intact enough to obtain fingerprints from—that is generally the quickest route to identification. In another thirteen per cent, forensic dentists were able to identify people from their teeth. In two per cent, medical hardware—such as a pacemaker—was used to make identifications. But, for about seventy per cent of the victims, the experts needed DNA. In the majority of those cases, there were still significant amounts of tissue. In a few cases—the most difficult ones—there were only ashes and small fragments of bone.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;feature-large-callout&quot; >;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;A person holding a baby carries an air purifier through the dark.&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653abf05763674b88ec88cb1/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/231106_r43299.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653abf05763674b88ec88cb1/master/w_120,c_limit/231106_r43299.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653abf05763674b88ec88cb1/master/w_240,c_limit/231106_r43299.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653abf05763674b88ec88cb1/master/w_320,c_limit/231106_r43299.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653abf05763674b88ec88cb1/master/w_640,c_limit/231106_r43299.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653abf05763674b88ec88cb1/master/w_960,c_limit/231106_r43299.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653abf05763674b88ec88cb1/master/w_1280,c_limit/231106_r43299.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653abf05763674b88ec88cb1/master/w_1600,c_limit/231106_r43299.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;A resident picks up an air purifier from outside Archie Kalepa&#39;s house, in Leiali&#39;i.

It can analyze five samples at a time—drops of blood, pinhead-size bits of liver, or fragments of bone. Richard Selden, the company&#39;s founder and chief scientific officer, said that he and his team initially developed the instrument for the United States military&#39;s counterterrorism operations in the Middle East, so it was designed to be portable and rugged.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;The DNA fingerprints were compared with reference samples that families, like the Galinato brothers, had provided. The problem was that many family members were not submitting samples. Some authorities attributed this to a lack of trust between residents and the government, which went back more than a century, to colonization. Officials launched a publicity campaign emphasizing that the DNA samples would be used only by &lt;em >;ANDE&lt;/em>;, and would not be used by the government for tracking people.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;me9is&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Alfredo Galinato was one of the first victims to be identified using the rapid-DNA machine. He had worked as a groundsman at the Westin, near Lahaina, for twenty-five years, and loved taking care of the hotel&#39;s parrots. I met his family across the island, at the house of his son John&#39;s fiancée, about a week after they received confirmation of his death. John, a carpenter, looked just like his father—with a gentle, open face and the strong, scrappy build of a former high-school state wrestling champion. He said that he felt blessed to have found out about his dad relatively quickly, compared with all those who were still searching.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Later, as I was driving back to Lahaina, John sent me a text, written as if his father were still alive. “Idk if I mentioned. My dad is a hard working man, dependable,” he wrote. “I can count on him.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;A strange scale of tragedy had developed on Maui. Those who hadn&#39;t lost loved ones might still have lost everything they owned. And yet some said they felt lucky. “Just material things,” one person told me. A woman named Michele Pigott, who had lived in Lahaina since 2011, said that this was the third house she had lost to a fire. (The first two were in California.) She was almost immune to being displaced again. “Piece of cake,” she told me. “There&#39;s not a goddam thing you can do.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;But anger was pulsing under the surface. As one mother said to me of the disaster response, “How could so many people fail at their job at the same time?” Among the first failures were the warning sirens. Although Maui has eighty of them, none were activated when the fire began. A week after the disaster, Herman Andaya, the administrator of the Maui Emergency Management Agency, defended his decision not to use the sirens, saying that they were primarily for tsunamis—even though the agency&#39;s Web site lists brush fires as one of the reasons for the “all-hazard siren system” to go off. Andaya said he had been concerned that the sirens would send people fleeing to higher ground, into the flames. He also said he was afraid that people wouldn&#39;t even hear the sirens, because almost all of them are along the coastline, and that he did not regret his decision. The following day he resigned, citing health reasons.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Another problem was the lack of firefighters. The Maui Fire Department has long been short-staffed and underfunded. Despite the vast increase in wildfire country on the island, the last time a new station was built was in 2003. West Maui&#39;s population has grown from roughly eighteen thousand to twenty-eight thousand over that span, and is serviced by two stations and three trucks. No more than sixteen firefighters were initially on duty in Lahaina on the afternoon of August 8th. “They did an extraordinary job,” Bobby Lee, the president of the Hawaii Fire Fighters Association, told me—“before they ran out of water.” County water levels were already low, and then the fire hydrants lost too much pressure. Some ran dry. The fire&#39;s extreme heat had caused water lines to break, something that also happened in a catastrophic urban fire in Fort McMurray, Canada, in 2016.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Many survivors have said that they received no evacuation orders from the police. When Mayor Bissen was later asked why, he said that, in fact, police officers had driven the streets, calling from loudspeakers. But that had happened later in the evening, near where fires were still burning on Lahaina&#39;s north end. After a local reporter pressed him on the failure, Bissen said, “You can decide what the reason was, whether it was somebody did something on purpose, or somebody did something out of negligence, or somebody did something out of necessity. There are probably a lot of reasons you can apply to why we do what we do as human beings.”&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;a data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a26023&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a26023&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;“Im afraid its true sire.

He said, “There was always a way out, if people were willing to go that way. Nobody was barred from going out of Lahaina town.” He continued, “We were encouraging everybody to get out, but it just depends on the dynamic. It may not have been the way that they maybe wanted to go.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The nature of the disaster, and the chaos and information void in the aftermath, lent itself to rumor and conspiracy theories. Selden, the &lt;em >;ANDE&lt;/em>; scientist, told me that there are two kinds of disasters: open and closed. A plane crash is the latter—there is one site of wreckage and a manifest listing who was on board. Lahaina is open. There is no list of people who were in town that day, and the burn area is large and unfixed. Speculation about the demographics of the victims was rampant. Because school was not starting until August 9th, people thought a lot of children might have been home. As of late August, only two families had reported the loss of a child; the police had not confirmed their deaths or identities.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Keyiro Fuentes, who was fourteen years old, was at home, asleep with the family dog, when the fire swept onto his street. His mother came back from work to get him, but the police blocked her, saying that they had already cleared the area. Days later, the family found Fuentes&#39;s body in the house. His father wrapped the body in a tarp and, with his older son&#39;s help, drove Fuentes to a police station. “ The first thing I said was, &#39;Mr. Officer, I have a body and it&#39;s that of my little brother,&#39; ” Josue Garcia Vargas, Fuentes&#39;s twenty-year-old brother, recalled. One officer at the station seemed to be in shock. “His hands were shaking,” Vargas said. “I kept telling him the name, and he kept saying, &#39;What? What?&#39; ”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In mid-September, the police confirmed Fuentes&#39;s death. The identification was delayed because Fuentes was adopted, and the police had to obtain DNA samples from his biological family, in Mexico, to confirm that he was who the Vargas family said he was. But the Vargases had already held a memorial. A week after the fire, when Fuentes would have turned fifteen, his mother threw him a birthday party.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Months earlier, Fuentes had told Vargas about a girl he had a crush on in his class. She hadn&#39;t seemed interested, so Vargas suggested that Fuentes flirt with the girl&#39;s cousin to make her jealous. Both girls had attended the memorial. “They were both crying, man,” Vargas told me when we met, tears rolling down his face, although he was smiling. “He made them cry. That made me happy.” Fuentes had been a tough, fiery, and sweet little kid, who loved mixed martial arts. “He wanted to be a police officer,” Vargas reminisced. “He saw when my mom got screamed at by one of our neighbors and he got mad and said, &#39;I&#39;m going to be an officer so this will never happen to you.&#39; ”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;7fah2gd&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;When the family had found Fuentes, Vargas added, their dog&#39;s remains were there, too. “We think they were hugging each other,” he said, now hugging himself, struggling to speak. He reminisced, of his brother, “He was always there, making his presence known, saying &#39;Wassup, bro!&#39; ” He paused. “It&#39;s hard for me to accept the reality of what happened.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;On August 29th, Pelletier announced that recovery crews had completed ninety-nine per cent of their land search in Lahaina. More than three hundred people remained unaccounted for, but the estimated number of deaths had not changed. The Galinatos&#39; neighbor, a forty-three-year-old EMT named Tony Simpson, was still missing. The day of the fire, Simpson&#39;s parents were at home in Belize, his sister Nichol was in Thailand, his other sister, Nova, was in Connecticut, and his brother was in New York. After a couple of days, none of them had heard from Simpson, and they started to panic. They made dozens of calls—to his employer, to the Red Cross, to the FBI, to the police. Nichol posted Simpson&#39;s photo in a Maui-disaster-relief Facebook group. Nova filed a missing-persons report and submitted a DNA sample to an FBI office in Connecticut.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The family had agreed that it made sense to do what they could from a distance, rather than get in the way of the authorities. But, after two weeks, Nichol and her husband, Angel Priest, made the forty-hour journey from Thailand to Maui. Their first stop was the Family Assistance Center, which was housed in a Hyatt Regency hotel. The complex was full of displaced people wandering a maze of courtyards, shuttered shops, and gardens. Nichol sat to give a DNA sample; &lt;em >;ANDE&lt;/em>; had an instrument on-site. She asked if her sister Nova&#39;s DNA was already in their system. The workers didn&#39;t know.&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;Nichol Simpson holding a missingpersons flyer for her brother Tony who was unaccounted for in the weeks after the fire.&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653abf0ab068c4008052aaec/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/231106_r43300.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653abf0ab068c4008052aaec/master/w_120,c_limit/231106_r43300.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653abf0ab068c4008052aaec/master/w_240,c_limit/231106_r43300.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653abf0ab068c4008052aaec/master/w_320,c_limit/231106_r43300.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653abf0ab068c4008052aaec/master/w_640,c_limit/231106_r43300.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653abf0ab068c4008052aaec/master/w_960,c_limit/231106_r43300.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653abf0ab068c4008052aaec/master/w_1280,c_limit/231106_r43300.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653abf0ab068c4008052aaec/master/w_1600,c_limit/231106_r43300.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;Nichol Simpson, holding a missing-persons flyer for her brother Tony, who was unaccounted for in the weeks after the fire.&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;p >;Nichol soon learned that a large percentage of victims were recovered within a few blocks of Simpson&#39;s home. When she told other families on the island where her brother lived, they&#39;d offer condolences. Nichol tried to visit Simpson&#39;s house in the burn zone but was stopped by the National Guard and told she needed an official escort. She called the police, and a receptionist suggested that she call the EOC When Nichol asked what the EOC was, the receptionist didn&#39;t know. (EOC is the Emergency Operations Center.) Nichol reached a person at the EOC, but learned that she could not, in fact, get an official escort into the burn zone. She was also told, by a field worker, that the residential area had been fully searched. That is, except for multistory buildings. This only confused her more. Simpson&#39;s house was two stories. Had it been searched? Unclear.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Nichol and Priest talked to unsheltered people in encampments. Simpson had a strong tie to that community; he had moved to Maui with a friend who chose to live outside. “We&#39;re literally stopping people on the street and asking them, &#39;Do you live here? Can you help us find a place to go search?&#39; ” Nichol told me. “Tomorrow we&#39;re going to find some random cave somebody suggested.” I asked if they really believed that Simpson was hiding out somewhere. “Absolutely,” Nichol said. Simpson had led an eclectic life. He lived off the grid for two years, “on mangoes, basically, like a friggin&#39; fruitarian.” She added, “We could just see him showing up later with some crazy story.” Like he&#39;d been living in a cave for two weeks. “Maybe he can make a big Hollywood movie about it,” she said, letting out a belly laugh. “Actually, he would hate that.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;After ten days, Nichol and Priest decided to fly to Belize to be with her parents. Before they left, they drove to the Lahaina post office to get Simpson&#39;s mail forwarded to them. “We were really grasping at straws for small things that I could take back to my family,” she told me. “Because we have nothing of his.” This was true of many victims&#39; families. The Galinatos had lost most of Alfredo&#39;s belongings, although his wedding ring had been recovered by search-and-rescue workers.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;On the way to the post office, Nichol received a call from the Maui PD The police had matched her DNA with her brother&#39;s remains, which they had found on August 11th—twenty-one days earlier—in a burned structure near his house, along with the remains of several others. As people had sought shelter, they landed in others&#39; homes, businesses, or cars, and in some cases died together. The location and commingling of remains delayed the processing of samples, and comparisons with the families&#39; DNA. This situation also resulted in an initial overcount of victims; two different body bags might later have been found to contain one person.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Nichol was not only heartbroken by her brother&#39;s death but frustrated by the lack of clear communication from the authorities. “We&#39;re thinking, They&#39;ve recovered a hundred and fifteen bodies. They&#39;ve recovered no more in several weeks. We don&#39;t match any of those bodies, so Tony must still be missing,” she told me. “It brought us a lot of false hope.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The morning after the fire, when Saribay was leaving the church parking lot, he saw smoke in the direction of a house belonging to his kids&#39; grandparents, in a neighborhood called Leiali&#39;i. He drove there and found his brother, who told him that another house, bordering their friend Archie Kalepa&#39;s property, was smoldering. The fire department had already been there, but the fire had flared back up.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Saribay and his brother ran across neighbors&#39; gardens, grabbing more hoses. They broke Kalepa&#39;s fence and soaked his yard. Saribay&#39;s shirt had melted the night before, but he&#39;d found a backpack containing women&#39;s clothes that he had changed into. Saribay has a mischievous streak, which, despite what he had been through, hadn&#39;t gone away. “I fucking fought that motherfucker while I was in a red fuckin&#39; blouse,” he said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;They extinguished the fire. Leiali&#39;i had been built seventeen years ago, as part of the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act, which allots homesteads to people who have at least fifty per cent Hawaiian blood. And the neighborhood was saved. Of its hundred and four houses, only two burned down. “At 10:30 &lt;em >;PM&lt;/em>;., when I evacuated, the flames were as high as the trees right behind my house. I thought it&#39;d be gone,” Rodney Pa&#39;ahana, the president of the Leiali&#39;i Association, a community group, told me. “We were astounded,” he continued. “God put a finger on us, as if to say, The Hawaiian people need to stay and rebuild.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Kalepa had been in California during the fire, but he came home on the first flight he could. When he arrived, Saribay apologized for breaking his fence. “Fuck my fence!” Kalepa told him. “You&#39;re the guy who saved my house!” Within forty-eight hours, that house became one of Maui&#39;s first community-organized emergency hubs. Kalepa told me that the donations, which ranged from money to food and supplies, had been overwhelming. People were sending poi—a traditional Hawaiian staple consisting of paste made from ground taro—from four islands away. Lahaina residents started calling the house “the local Costco.”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;GenericCallout&quot;>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;GroupCalloutWrapper&quot;>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;A road sign reads Lahaina Town Next Rights.&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653abf16271aeb458dbc973e/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/231106_r43301.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653abf16271aeb458dbc973e/master/w_120,c_limit/231106_r43301.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653abf16271aeb458dbc973e/master/w_240,c_limit/231106_r43301.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653abf16271aeb458dbc973e/master/w_320,c_limit/231106_r43301.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653abf16271aeb458dbc973e/master/w_640,c_limit/231106_r43301.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653abf16271aeb458dbc973e/master/w_960,c_limit/231106_r43301.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653abf16271aeb458dbc973e/master/w_1280,c_limit/231106_r43301.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653abf16271aeb458dbc973e/master/w_1600,c_limit/231106_r43301.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;The cost to rebuild Lahaina will be an estimated five and a half billion dollars.&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;Archie Kalepa sits in a folding chair.&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653abf1cf299b00d884a6e77/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/231106_r43302.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653abf1cf299b00d884a6e77/master/w_120,c_limit/231106_r43302.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653abf1cf299b00d884a6e77/master/w_240,c_limit/231106_r43302.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653abf1cf299b00d884a6e77/master/w_320,c_limit/231106_r43302.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653abf1cf299b00d884a6e77/master/w_640,c_limit/231106_r43302.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653abf1cf299b00d884a6e77/master/w_960,c_limit/231106_r43302.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653abf1cf299b00d884a6e77/master/w_1280,c_limit/231106_r43302.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653abf1cf299b00d884a6e77/master/w_1600,c_limit/231106_r43302.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;“We have one chance of fixing this,” Archie Kalepa said, of the rebuilding process. “And, if we get it wrong, all of Hawaii&#39;s going to fail.

There were more than two dozen coolers, towers of water bottles, Clorox wipes, a bleeping Starlink router (for Internet), and a machine that converted moisture from the air into water. Friends and volunteers were lugging boxes and ice, setting up rooftop solar panels, and peeling bananas to make banana bread.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Kalepa asked if I wanted to see the line where Saribay had held off the fire, gesturing toward the back yard. It all seemed fairly normal. But at the edge—beyond the grass, palm fans, magenta stalks, and yellow frangipani flowers with pink centers—there was a gap where the fence had been. On the other side of that gap, the world was suddenly black-and-white. A foundation of scorched cinder blocks suggested the ghost of a house. Rusted rebar poked the air. There was a shovel, bent like a bow tie. A hollowed pickup truck was snapped in half. The air was stagnant with the lingering, acrid smell of smoke, rot, and death.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;ytndov&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Kalepa, a ninth-generation Hawaiian, recently turned sixty. He is a former lifeguard and big-wave surfer who provides ocean training to Navy &lt;em >;seal&lt;/em>;s. In the weeks since the fire, he has become one of Maui&#39;s most prominent community leaders. “I never wanted to be in this position,” he told me. “I was really enjoying my life.” He is now serving on Mayor Bissen&#39;s five-member Lahaina Advisory Team, which will consult on the town&#39;s rebuilding. “We have one chance at fixing this,” Kalepa said. “And, if we get it wrong, all of Hawaii&#39;s going to fail. Not just Lahaina.” One of the community&#39;s biggest fears is that the process will favor developers, tourists, and the wealthy. Kalepa, other activists, and water-rights groups have been strenuously advocating for the local community. On September 8th, Governor Green announced that he was reinstating the state&#39;s water code. Several weeks later, the water deputy, M. Kaleo Manuel, was returned to his post.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;An organization called the Fire Safety Research Institute has been selected to investigate the government&#39;s response to the catastrophe. Initial findings are expected by December. But responsibility for the fire falls in many places, on many individuals, across the decades. “For the last hundred and fifty years,” Kalepa said, “Hawaii&#39;s gone in the wrong direction. This situation we&#39;re in right now? It brought that to light.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;People often view disaster survivors&#39; stories as they would an apocalypse film—a frightening but faraway and anomalous event, witnessed from a safe place. But these stories are missives from our immediate future—postcards from what, one day, might be your circumstance, in this era that some climate-change experts now call the Pyrocene. Record-breaking wildfires are happening more frequently all over the world, with studies directly linking climate change to the increase in fire duration, size, and severity. Wildfires in the US caused more than eighty billion dollars in damage from 2017 to 2021, a nearly tenfold increase from the previous five years.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Hawaii has made gestures at addressing climate change; in 2015, it was the first state to pledge to convert entirely to renewable energy by 2045. And yet critics have jumped to blame the power company, Hawaiian Electric, for focussing on renewables, claiming that it was doing so at the expense of maintenance that could have prevented the West Maui fire. Similar debates are playing out all over the country, where the same funds required for infrastructure maintenance and improvements, in this hot new world, are also needed for the green-energy transition.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Hawaiian Electric&#39;s CEO, Shelee Kimura, testified at a congressional hearing that thousands of aging utility poles had not been tested for termites or rot since 2013, but she also said that power lines had been de-energized for more than six hours before the afternoon fire began, and that the company was therefore not responsible. Her assertion, and the fire&#39;s true cause of ignition, are under investigation, and the company now faces more than a dozen lawsuits, including one filed by Maui County.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;On October 8th, the two-month anniversary of the fire, Governor Green welcomed tourists back to parts of West Maui. Many community members were outraged; they felt that they weren&#39;t near ready. Just a few days later, more human remains were found in Lahaina. Six people are still missing, and there is one body that has not yet been identified. “Imagine what happens when you gotta live in temporary housing, surrounded by ash, and go to work back in those hotels,” Nā&#39;ālehu Anthony, a filmmaker and an activist, told me. “People just hit this wall where they&#39;re saying, &#39;We&#39;re not going to do that anymore.&#39; ”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Even though returning to work was hard to stomach, it was crucial to Maui&#39;s economy, which is heavily reliant on tourism, and necessary for residents, who were struggling with bills and insurance. Many residents were worried about their mortgage payments, which are still due even after your house burns down. “For what, a piece of dirt?” Saribay said. His kids were OK, which was “all that matters,” he said, but he had lost three of his houses, his tattoo parlor, and his boat. He was living in his kids&#39; grandparents&#39; house in Leiali&#39;i. Saribay told me that he had taken a forty-hour course to obtain a hazmat certification, so that he could be part of the effort to clear the rubble from Lahaina. But the idea had become a nightmare. “I just don&#39;t want to be &lt;em>;in&lt;/em>; &lt;em>;there&lt;/em>; right now,” he said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Fifty to sixty per cent of the people that passed away was from my neighborhood,” Saribay told me. He has been dealing with trauma: “My nights are a fucking question mark,” he said. “I&#39;m so tired. My mind races.” He has thought about leaving Hawaii altogether, and has felt financial pressure to sell his land—a common experience among homeowners, some of whom reported receiving calls from real-estate investors just days after the fire. “I could just be outta here and say, &#39;Fuck Hawaii,&#39; ” Saribay continued. “I&#39;m not gonna, but fuck.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;He has had delays with his &lt;em >;FEMA&lt;/em>; relief application—he still doesn&#39;t know how much money or what kind of housing assistance he will get.“Everything will be OK if the government really helps us, but they&#39;re not,” he said. “It&#39;s the people of Maui who&#39;s helping each other.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;One Friday evening, I attended a community meeting at Kalepa&#39;s house, which had become a weekly event. People offered advice, consolation, ideas. One man discussed new air purifiers that had been donated by a nonprofit, which residents could take home with them. Pa&#39;ahana, the Leiali&#39;i Association president, gave a teary speech arguing that Lahaina should be rebuilt as a giant beach park, with all the shops and homes staying up near the highway. “I know I&#39;m gonna get a lot of flak from the billionaires and businesses,” he said. “But, if we do this right, they will thank us when we&#39;re not here anymore.” As he spoke, fat raindrops started falling. Kalepa told the crowd, “The blessings are pouring out for us.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Many Hawaiians want to make this moment an opportunity. “It&#39;s very rare to have people plan a new town after hundreds of years of history,” Pa&#39;ahana told me. “But we get a chance.” The tropical shower stopped as suddenly as it had started. A line of volunteers carried platters of opakapaka, venison, coconut, and poi to folding tables set up in the cul-de-sac. Saribay was bopping around, taking pictures of the food and cracking jokes. “He&#39;s so full of life,” Kalepa said, grinning in his friend&#39;s direction. As it got dark, kids sat on the asphalt playing duck-duck-goose. Anthony, the filmmaker, told me, “The reason Archie Kalepa stood this up is because his community needed help, and because the idea of aloha is not how much you can keep. It&#39;s how much you can give away.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The first week and a half after the fire, apart from the machinery and the dogs, Lahaina was silent. No birds or bugs were alive. But even among the ashes there is virescence. The oldest banyan tree in Lahaina, planted a century and a half ago, beaten and blackened by fire, has sprouted green buds. They appear to glow against the surrounding moonscape, like time travellers from our once and future planet. ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot;

&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;p >;Before that year, I knew nothing about Colombia—nothing real. I was eleven and too focussed on the Dominican Republic I&#39;d left behind and on my own immigrant bullshit to worry about anywhere else. If I&#39;d had my way, I wouldn&#39;t ever have thought about the DR, but in my household there was no escaping it. Those were the early years of our immigration, when my mother still kept up with the news back home. Every morning without fail, before I even had a chance to brush my teeth, she had me tune my father&#39;s beloved radio to the Spanish stations. And, because I was the curious kid I was, I listened, and, because I couldn&#39;t help myself, I learned.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Maybe it was the stations we were tuning in to, but they made it sound like the DR was on a rocket to hell. Nothing was going right: nobody had jobs and there were strikes every day and food shortages and super-sensational murders and politicians accusing one another of all sorts of lunacies. As if that weren&#39;t apocalypse enough, this was a few months after Hurricane David more or less dropped the island on its fucking head, leaving thousands dead, hundreds of thousands homeless, and entire neighborhoods blown to splinters. Forty-plus years later and you still have Domos who can&#39;t hear the name David without breaking out in hives.&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Here was the weirdness: it didn&#39;t matter whether the radio was talking about the annihilation of David or some grisly-ass twenty-person bus collision, my mother never reacted. Not with her face or with her words. Just kept folding clothes or washing peas, her thin I-starved-throughout-my-childhood face pinched inward. It was a kind of passivity that I didn&#39;t understand. Why was she listening to the news if she wasn&#39;t going to react?&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;GenericCallout&quot;>;&lt;p >;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/books/this-week-in-fiction/junot-diaz-11-06-23&quot;>;Junot Díaz on writing as an act of faith.&lt;/a>;&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;My father, for example, was more prototypically Dominican. When he listened to the radio or watched the news or read the paper—or breathed—he always let the world know what he was thinking. A horrible traffic accident? Dominicans drive like monkeys. Political malfeasance? Dominicans are corrupt por naturaleza. Hurricane David? Trujillo would have cleaned that up in two weeks tops. Ex-President Balaguer? The greatest intellectual in the entire history of the Dominican Republic.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The other contenders? He never said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Your average Dominican eleven-year-old wouldn&#39;t have known Balaguer from a hole in the ground, but my father was an avowed balaguerista and often preached the gospel of Balaguer to me and my older brother—how, after our dictator-for-life Trujillo was assassinated by traitors and maricones, it was Balaguer who restored order. Balaguer was the only reason, he explained, that we weren&#39;t all comunistas or maricones, which seemed interchangeable to him.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Here&#39;s what was interesting: on the many occasions when my father waxed nostalgic about Balaguer and his mano dura against the subversives, you would have thought my mom didn&#39;t even speak Spanish, that&#39;s how indifferent she was. But God forbid the radio mentioned Balaguer&#39;s name when my father wasn&#39;t around—then it was &lt;em>;on&lt;/em>;. Her mask cracked. She&#39;d shake whatever she was holding, her eyes would flash, and she&#39;d invariably hiss a variation of Ese pedazo de mierda.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;My mother was a conservative woman—Dominican-campesina conservative—and by rights should have been pulling for both Trujillo and Balaguer, but she hated Balaguer, a hatred that extended backward to Trujillo, who&#39;d trained him and taught him his dictatorial ways. Her loathing was not some partisan abstraction, either; it was profoundly &lt;em>;personal&lt;/em>;. A few months after we left the DR, her favorite cousin was murdered, gunned down on the street, and she blamed Balaguer.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;This was my uncle Renato, who for as long as I can remember had been our family&#39;s one and only comunista. (You already see where this is going.) I&#39;d never met him in person, knew him only through fotographs; when we were still in the DR, he was always either in hiding or in exile abroad. But all us kids knew one thing about Uncle Renato: that my mother adored him. He&#39;d been something of an older brother to her, the one she never had, an ultra-Catholic, too, until he&#39;d gone to the capital to study—where instead of becoming an engineer he became a Communist.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;GenericCallout&quot;>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;Podcast: The Writer&#39;s Voice&lt;/strong>;&lt;br/>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/podcast/the-writers-voice/junot-diaz-reads-the-ghosts-of-gloria-lare&quot;>;&lt;em>;Listen to Junot Díaz read “The Ghosts of Gloria Lara.”&lt;/em>;&lt;/a>;&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;I knew from the stories I&#39;d overheard that Renato had fought against the Americans when they invaded—my military father had fought &lt;em>;for&lt;/em>; them—had gone to prison for agitating against Balaguer and been tortured there something horrible, and in 1970 he&#39;d washed up in Romania, part of that movement of Latin American radicals who found shelter in the Soviet bloc.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;He should have stayed in Romania, but he was too much the revolutionary, and in 1975, the year we finally secured our visas to join our father in the US, he returned to the DR My mother begged him to stay in Romania, find a nice girl; he wouldn&#39;t listen. He was committed to overthrowing Balaguer and turning the DR into the next Cuba.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Overthrow Balaguer? Maybe during his first year in office, when he was on shaky ground, but in his ninth? Like the egg trying to fight the rock. By 1975, President Balaguer had the military, the élites, the police, the campesinos, the Church, and even the US secret services under his little heel. 1975 was just about the worst year for this kind of thing. A couple of years earlier, some of Renato&#39;s comrades had attempted to overthrow Balaguer and got themselves massacred, and ever since the old lich had turned up the heat. He had the Trujillo apparatus running around the clock and anyone with the slightest whiff of red on them was getting bodied by the death squads.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;My uncle lasted seven months, most of it on the run, darting from one safe house to the next. My mother went to see him twice during that time, right before we left the country. She didn&#39;t take us kids because it was too dangerous. Both times she brought him his favorite food, a pastelón; he ate, asked about the family, and then sent her on her way before anything happened. She didn&#39;t tell him that we were going to the US The only thing he hated more than Balaguer was the US&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Why don&#39;t you go back to Romania? she asked.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;He smiled—she remembered that smile. &lt;em>;Because the future is for the revolutionaries&lt;/em>;.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The day he died he was waiting in the Parque Independencia to board a bus bound for Azua and then the border. Maybe planning to visit relatives or maybe heading into exile via Haiti. No one really knows. My mother hadn&#39;t heard from him in weeks.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;8rf7ei&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Before he could set foot on the bus, a never described or identified man walked up, levelled a revolver, and shot him clean out of his left Florsheim.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;A murder in broad daylight at a crowded bus stop, and no one saw anything, heard anything, thought anything, but somehow everyone knew it was Balaguer&#39;s totally not official death squad, the Banda Colorá, that had done it. One bystander was kind enough to place my uncle&#39;s loose shoe on his birdlike chest. A foto of the murder scene was printed in a newspaper (I never found out which one) and a worn clipping of said foto found its way to my mother in the US&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;No matter how hard I try I&#39;ll never fully capture my mother in words, but know this, at least: she was the sort of woman who kept a torn-out newspaper foto of her dead cousin in the drawer where she stored all our passports.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;It was a cruel thing that they did. Killing him and then taking that foto. For a long time that was my vision of the Dominican Republic: a Florsheim stamping down on the breastplate of my uncle—forever.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;So that was the scene—me, my mother, my dead uncle folded up in a passport, my dad&#39;s radio, an occasional mention of Balaguer—when February 27, 1980, rolled around. February 27th was Dominican Independence Day, which we didn&#39;t celebrate in my household. My father loved himself some dictator types, but national holidays? Couldn&#39;t be bothered and neither, really, could my mother, but for different reasons, I&#39;m sure.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;On that particular Independence Day, a group of Colombian guerrillas seized the Dominican Embassy in Bogotá, of all places (which I had to look up in our school&#39;s atlas). At the time of the attack, the Embassy was hosting a big ol&#39; Independence celebration for the entire diplomatic community, which meant the guerrillas not only captured the Dominican Ambassador, they also bagged the Austrian, Brazilian, Costa Rican, Egyptian, Guatemalan, Haitian, Israeli, Mexican, Swiss, Uruguayan, Venezuelan, and US Ambassadors as well! Plus the papal nuncio, whoever the fuck that was.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Must have been quite a party—until it wasn&#39;t.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Compared with the Iranian hostage crisis—day a hundred and fifteen!—it seemed like no big deal to me, but my mother had a very different reaction. From the moment she heard the first report, she tuned in like a woman obsessed. And because I wanted my mother to like me, and because I didn&#39;t have any real friends at the time, I started following along, too. She not only listened to the news on the regular radio, she had me messing around with my dad&#39;s shortwave to see if we could pick up any broadcasts direct from Bogotá (we couldn&#39;t), and every day she sent me up to the Parlin Pathmark to check both the English and the Spanish newspapers and if I found any mention of the siege I had to buy the papers and bring them home.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The Spanish articles she read very slowly, two fingers pressing down on each word as though it might up and bolt, but the English articles I had to translate word for word out loud. At school, I started looking up Colombia in the encyclopedias to try and understand what in the world was going on. Not a lot of information in our elementary-school library, but there was more down at Sayreville Public Library. Before long, I knew more about Colombia and the Movimiento 19 de Abril than I did about the Dominican Republic. It was exactly the kind of outfit my uncle would have approved of. A guerrilla movement fighting an oppressive government.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;My mother was entranced—her version of entranced. She still listened passively, mutely, but there was a shift, something in the quality of listening that was different; she didn&#39;t busy herself with chores, held herself immobile, almost as though she had family in that mess.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;My father wasn&#39;t fixated in the same way, but he followed the coverage like probably every other Dominican was doing, and, as a former military officer of the pro-Trujillo variety, he shared his opinions, of course. He couldn&#39;t believe that the Colombians were negotiating with the guerrillas, whose demands included money to continue their revolution and the release of hundreds of their comrades. My father screamed at the TV, Give them hot juicy bullets! During our meals, he offered expert advice on how the Colombians might retake the Embassy, with helpful diagrams on the back of my notebooks, bringing out his various firearms to lend his argument extra authority. My older brother watched this all with open amusement, encouraged him with questions like: How exactly would you kill a terrorist through a locked door? My mother never responded to these planning sessions, but as the weeks went on I noticed something in her expression that baffled me. Until it dawned on me that—duh—she was, in fact, rooting &lt;em>;for&lt;/em>; the guerrillas, something that at the time made no sense to me, reared as I was to think of revolutionaries and Communists as Satans of a lesser order.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The siege lasted sixty-one days and my mother followed every little turn, every release, every near-settlement. By the end, the M-19 leaders—Comandante Uno, Comandante María, and La Chiqui (the female guerrilla negotiator I fell in love with and whose real name was Carmenza Cardona Londoño)—had become part of our idiolect, the secret language that my mother and I shared.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Not that anyone else in the family noticed. My father was oblivious of how closely we were following the Colombian crisis—he had his girlfriends to worry about—and my brother was even more indifferent. My mother and I could have been on fire and I doubt my brother would have given a flying fuck, much less thrown us a wet towel.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The Colombian siege was our thing, really, the one and only time my mother and I had ever done anything &lt;em>;together&lt;/em>; as a unit. We were never close, you see. My mother preferred my brother, openly, flagrantly; me she just tolerated. It took many years for me to realize that it wasn&#39;t personal. That was the way she was. She just didn&#39;t have it in her heart to love more than she was already loving. She had loved the two almost-sons, the ones she had miscarried before we were born—the first in a sugarcane field and the second during the American invasion, in the back of a burning truck—and the fact that she had any love for anyone after all she&#39;d gone through was pretty miraculous.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;srpldv&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;At the time I didn&#39;t brood on it. Every parent I knew up close had their favorites; figured that was the way shit was. Didn&#39;t mean I wasn&#39;t hungry for her affection. Which was why I fetched the newspapers without complaint and turned on the radio when she commanded, looked up what I could about Colombia to share with her, and tried to chat up our one Colombian neighbor in London Terrace, Mr. Longo, without much success—but more than anything I just sat with her and we listened to the radio together.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;And then on day sixty-one it all ended. The guerrillas left the Embassy shielded by the last of their hostages (the Dominican Ambassador had already been released, but not the American one) and flew to Cuba, where Fidel was waiting for them with open arms. My father watched the recap on the news that night with almost comical fury. Just shoot them already! he cried. When the news played a clip of La Chiqui&#39;s fuego speech in Havana, my father couldn&#39;t take it; he left the apartment without a word, off to visit one of his other women, no doubt.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;My mother watched him go, waved for me to turn off the TV. But, if it wasn&#39;t triumph I sensed radiating through the heartbreak, I don&#39;t know what it was.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;When you&#39;re poor or a Colombian revolutionary, triumphs don&#39;t last. A year later, La Chiqui was dead. Like my uncle Renato, she had refused to stay on the sidelines in Cuba and had returned to Colombia to continue la guerra revolucionaria and this time the military finished her.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;My father, alas, wasn&#39;t around to celebrate. Not long after the Embassy siege, he had run off with one of his girlfriends—the ugly one, my mother called her, with her usual incisiveness—and not two months after that bit of ridiculousness my brother was diagnosed with the cancer that would eat him up. He&#39;d spend the final years of his life pretending that he was fine and absolutely nothing was wrong––an act of such sustained bald-faced denial that even now, four decades later, I have trouble grokking.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;As for me and my mother, the end of the Colombian siege was a goodbye of sorts for us as well. Last time we ever did anything like that, anything together. Also: the last time I cared about what was happening to Dominicans for years and years.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;And yet, in spite of everything, something of that Colombia moment remained alive in me, remained alive in my mother, too. Lingered the way the radioactivity from my brother&#39;s treatments lingered in his bones.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;A shadow, you might say—an echo. Whenever Colombia got mentioned, even in the depths of my Turn White obsession, I noticed. And anytime I saw Mr. Longo, who lived across the parking lot, I was reminded of those sixty-one days. If Mr. Longo and I happened to be waiting on line together at the Pathmark, for example, I always asked him how it was going in Colombia. The motherfucker answered the same way every time: Jodido.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Sometimes I still found myself looking at books in the library, or staring at the country in atlases.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;All of this explains, at least to me, what happened in 1985.&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot;

The year Wilson Longo fell in love with my mother and the year I got my second huge dose of true terror (the first dose I&#39;ll get to later).&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;If I&#39;m going to talk about Wilson Longo, first I need to say something about his older brother.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The elder Longo had moved into Building 4 a few years before the Embassy fiasco, and about the only thing that made him stand out—besides the fact that he was Colombian—was that he had a massive Charles Bronson mustache and drove a 1970 Charger that everyone whistled over. That was it, nothing else to report. Elder Longo was semi-invisible and didn&#39;t talk to anyone, his apartment so quiet you could never tell when he was home and when he wasn&#39;t. Dude was all work or all Charger. On nights that I couldn&#39;t sleep, I caught sight of him in his coveralls heading off to whatever garage he worked at. Even though we were the only ones up and about at 5 &lt;em >;am&lt;/em>;, I didn&#39;t wave at him and he didn&#39;t wave at me. He didn&#39;t seem like a top-of-the-morning type.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;As for Wilson and his son, Alberto—one day they weren&#39;t, the next day they were. Typical shit in my neighborhood. Folks appeared and disappeared without warning all the time; families doubled in size, immigrant mitosis, or whittled down to nothing, like it was the most normal thing in the world. Or someone you thought was just visiting was actually staying, or at least trying to stay—which was the case with Wilson Longo and his son.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Wilson Longo—or Mr. Wilson, as my mother called him—was neither handsome nor ugly, wasn&#39;t anything, really. A bland tan face with a wide nose and wavy Adam Clayton Powell, Jr., hair. As anonymous as his brother except that Mr. Wilson was the hairiest man I&#39;d ever seen, some straight Chewbacca shit, hair bursting up from his collar like follicle flame, one half-moon away from werewolf. Even when he shaved he looked beard-imminent. I guess the other thing was that he had giant fucking calves—the kind of calves you climb the Matterhorn with.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;He arrived from Colombia looking rough, like he&#39;d got a beating on the flight and then another one at immigration, and that whaled-on look never left him the whole time he lived among us.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;We followed his progress, less out of curiosity than out of habit—newcomers were always objects of suspicion until they weren&#39;t. He joined his brother at the garage for a few weeks but that didn&#39;t take. He had a fistfight with another worker, and that became the pattern for him. He had trouble keeping any gig for long; there was always some blowup or another. Ended up at home a lot, drinking and playing Colombian music—Lucho Bermúdez and the rest—and listening to soccer matches non-fucking-stop. On certain weekend days, he&#39;d chase a soccer ball around the parking lot, drunkenly. Which seemed to me one of the most embarrassing things an adult could do.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Under normal circumstances, I doubt I would have paid too much attention to either Mr. Wilson or his son, but these were definitely not normal circumstances. 1985 was my family&#39;s annus horribilis, the last year of my brother&#39;s life. He had entered his final gyre and was talking to none of us, just sprawled his skeletal ass in his room, waiting for the inevitable end. He had visitors, mostly girls, and not just from around the way, caballotas from all over New Jersey, even some gringas. Don&#39;t know how in the world he had met them all, this was way before the Internet, but good-looking brothers have their ways, I guess. All beautiful, all magnificently teary-eyed, they would sit with him for hours, watching TV or doing whatever they did in that closed room, before heading out. My mother never said a word about the visitors and never offered these girls more than water, either, unless they spoke to her in Spanish. De donde tu eres? she&#39;d ask, and if they answered respectfully she&#39;d offer them coffee and pan caliente and wait to see if they washed their own saucer or not.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;My mother had lost nearly as much weight as my brother and gone just as quiet. Her eyes, so Mesopotamian, now overwhelmed her famished face. She no longer cried over my nowhere-in-sight father. She no longer cried over my brother, either. Every ounce of her seemed bent on holding back the tides of reality, keeping the cancer at bay.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Dios doesn&#39;t want tears, I heard her telling our neighbor Doña Agpangan. He wants devotion.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;She gave Him plenty of that. Went to Mass every single morning, which was a big change from her old secular days; beseeching Dios, San Lazaro, and la Virgen de la Altagracia for the miracle that never came. When she wasn&#39;t praying, she worked cleaning houses in the Brunswicks (some of her customers would soon be my professors at Rutgers), and spent the rest of her time taking care of my brother at home or in the hospital.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;udv6h5&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;By then all her friends had pulled back. I&#39;ve said it before and I&#39;ll say it again: cancer is a planet that no one wants to visit for long. Only Doña Agpangan, our short cigarette-addicted Pinay neighbor, still came around, praying with my mother and bringing over empanadas that I always ended up eating.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;None of us in the family talked much anymore, but when my mother did open her mouth it was only ever to tear chunks out of me over whatever I&#39;d done wrong at school or at home. And, because I was no longer the mamito I&#39;d been, I&#39;d tear chunks out of her right back. Tu si eres bruto, she&#39;d spit, and I would say, Hijo de bruta.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;She wasn&#39;t wrong to get at me. By our annus horribilis I was so depressed I had trouble doing much of anything at school. Even multiple-choice quizzes were too much and a lot of the time I didn&#39;t bother going to school, just walked to the library and pretended to read books until it was time to walk home. My depression had me thinking some typically dark shit. We had a lot of firearms in our house (Chekhov alert) which my father had left behind, and about the only thing that my brother could bring himself to do in those hideous months was to keep them all clean and ready to rock. In the midst of those funereal days, I took to sleeping with my father&#39;s monstrous Astra .44 under my bed, fully fucking loaded. My reason? Just in case my brother decided in his last days to go for me. Once or twice he had mentioned something about shooting me in the face before he went, a farewell makeover. And also just in case I had the sudden urge to put a bullet right up through my nasal cavity.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Such were my thoughts.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I don&#39;t know if it was my mother&#39;s unhappiness or Wilson Longo&#39;s unhappiness or just the gravity of two lost Latin types in proximity, but the pair of them ended up connecting. He&#39;d wave to her every chance he got, and when she saw him sitting out on his front stoop alone she&#39;d invite him for a cup of coffee. They were both old school and talked to each other decorously, usted this usted that, and he had a gentle two-handed way of handing back the mug as though he feared for its safety.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Anyway, that&#39;s how it started. Over coffee, usually while my brother was at the hospital and she had nothing else to do.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;And Mr. Wilson, happy to find a sympathetic soul in an alien country, started coming around a lot. Stood on the stoop and talked to her in that beautiful Colombian accent of his. And my mother talked back. A lot. I don&#39;t think my mother had ever talked so much in her life—the neighborhood, her first year in the States, who might have a job for him, the news of the day. Maybe that was who she&#39;d been before my father and all those miscarriages changed her. Mr. Wilson started walking her to daily Mass, would wait outside smoking cigarettes until she&#39;d finished with her prayers, and then walk her back from St. Bernadette.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Church is for fools, he liked to say, teasing her, but she never took the bait.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Church is for the hopeful.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Some immigrants-slash-refugees hold on to their secrets for life, but whether it was in Mr. Wilson&#39;s nature to be forthcoming or whether something about my mother encouraged him, he opened up to her really quickly. Explained that in Colombia he&#39;d been a teacher who&#39;d had the misfortune to get caught up completely por casualidad in a horrendous case involving the kidnapping and murder of a prominent política for which the authorities had arrested him.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;This was, of course, the notorious Gloria Lara de Echeverri case, which I didn&#39;t learn about until years later, and it was only thanks to dumb luck that Mr. Wilson had got out of jail alive. Not knowing if he&#39;d be rearrested, he&#39;d done the smart thing and gone into exile, dragging his son with him. As for the boy&#39;s mother, she was in Europe, remarried; not much help there.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;What&#39;s the difference between immigration and exile? I asked my brother.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;What&#39;s the difference between assholes? my brother said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;When I asked my mother, she gave a weary look. Isn&#39;t that what you have your teachers for?&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I had never seen anyone so into my mother. Mr. Wilson would talk to her for as long as she&#39;d have him, sometimes letting night fall around them, until even his son had to call him home in embarrassment. He even tried to help her improve her English—he was far from fluent but compared with Mom he was a veritable Herman Melville.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;It was some wild Romeo shit. My own father had never shown my mother an ounce of affection, so this was a brand-new experience for me.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;My brother seemed to think the whole thing was a hoot.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Maybe you can bring my coffin to the wedding, he said to my mother.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Don&#39;t be ridiculous. Es un amigo. Nada mas.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Un amigo. That word has so many resonances in English and in Spanish, especially when it&#39;s one&#39;s mother uttering it.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Truth is, I never could decide if my mother liked Mr. Wilson or not. I&#39;m not sure she knew herself, not at that point. So what was it between them?&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Basic loneliness? Pity? Her need to fix something, anything?&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;She&#39;d catch sight of him lumbering after the soccer ball in the parking lot, going until he was tripping and sagging over himself, and she would shake her head. She took to sending meals over to the Longo household, heaping plates of locrio or Dominican lasagna that I had to deliver, and it always pissed me off, but what could I do?&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;What is it? Alberto would always say when he answered the door. If there was anyone in the world more unhappy than I was, it was Alberto.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Poison, I&#39;d say, and leave him to it.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;If my mother wanted to feel sorry for anybody, it should have been Mr. Wilson&#39;s son. Alberto had a rough time of it in London Terrace.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;First off, you never wanted to be any kind of immigrant in a neighborhood like mine. Tolerant and open-armed we were not. Second, that was about the worst time to be Colombian. “Scarface” was out, so everyone asked Alberto where he was keeping the cocaine and called him Tony Montana, which was stupid since Tony Montana was Cuban not Colombian, but when has geographical accuracy ever got in the way of cruelty?&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Alberto was a tall kid—Pentecostal-looking, if you know what I mean—with bags under his eyes that looked eerie on a ninth grader. Dude hunched and had a square box haircut so of course his other nickname was Lurch. I like to think that had any kids known what he had endured before arriving—the arrest of his father, the full-out media demonization of all the suspects in the case, the months of terror wondering whether he&#39;d be arrested and tortured, too—they might have gone easier on him, but I seriously doubt they would have fucking cared.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;He was an awkward-looking doof who didn&#39;t speak English and whose clothes and haircut were extra corny, who showed up at the bus stop that first month with a soccer ball under one of his long arms. Probably hoping the ball would help him make friends. Didn&#39;t work. He was, as they say, scheduled for destruction. After the first week the idiots asked to see the ball and like a dope he let one hold it, and Idiot No. 1 kicked said ball over into the next parking lot just as the bus pulled up and I watched Alberto trying to decide: bus or ball, bus or ball. In the end, the bus won.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;dt94f&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Don&#39;t worry, Tony, Idiot No. 1 said. It will be there when you get back.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Of course it wasn&#39;t.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Any sane person would expect the bullshit to stop after a month or two, but a sane person didn&#39;t know neighborhoods like ours. Kids just never let up. &lt;em>;The oppressed&lt;/em>;, &lt;em>;instead of striving for liberation&lt;/em>;, &lt;em>;tend themselves to become oppressors&lt;/em>;. Freire didn&#39;t know the half of it.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I remember the one time I made friendly with Alberto. This was early on. After school I showed him around the neighborhood—nothing much to see. I took him up to Honda Hill and down to the landfill. I showed him where the sanitation workers piled discarded books—it was from these castoffs that I had built my little library. He looked at everything without the slightest trace of interest and the more indifferent he seemed the harder I tried to sell—what, precisely? Our shitty neighborhood? Our stinking landfill? Me?&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;It wasn&#39;t until I showed him the issue of &lt;em>;Dragon&lt;/em>; magazine I&#39;d recently bought that he brightened up.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I have those magazines, he said in Spanish.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;You do?&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;He nodded.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Which ones? I asked.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;All of them, he said proudly.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Now, you have to understand that in those days I was into Dungeons and Dragons the way Americans are into money, had stacks of modules and cans full of dice. Role-playing games kept me alive when everything else was telling me to shoot myself. So when Alberto said he had all the &lt;em>;Dragon&lt;/em>; magazines, I could barely contain myself.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Could I see them? I asked.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Of course, he said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I waited a day, a week, a month, but he never showed them to me. The excuses were endless—claimed he was reading them (“All of them?” I asked incredulously); claimed no one was allowed into his apartment; claimed his father wouldn&#39;t let him take the magazines out of the house. What was funny was that even though I knew better I kept holding out hope that Alberto was telling the truth, that he really had all those &lt;em>;Dragon&lt;/em>; back issues. I kept waiting and waiting and such was the nature of my hope, of my longing, that it was only after he left for Europe that I finally allowed myself to accept that I had been had.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Alberto and the States ended just about how you would expect. One day the craziest of the local kids said some shit to Alberto in half-Spanish and Alberto said some shit back in full-Spanish, and when the kid tried to knock Alberto down, Alberto punched him straight in the mouth, so the kid pulled a knife. At that point, any other motherfucker would have run, but Alberto must have had enough of all the bullshit because he made a play for the blade. I wasn&#39;t there, but from what I hear the cuts on his palms were ghastly as fuck. There was still blood on the sidewalk the next day, everyone pointing it out to me. Looked like a murder scene.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Alberto stayed out of school for the rest of the quarter; I saw him kicking his soccer ball around with his bandaged hand, and then, without warning, he was gone. He had wanted to return to Colombia but that was impossible, so he went off to live with his moms in Austria. All this my mother learned from Mr. Wilson, who kept her up past her bedtime talking on the porch. He wanted Alberto with him, his only son, but what could he do? He&#39;d already made the boy suffer enough.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;It wasn&#39;t you, my mother said. It was them.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;He sighed so loudly I could hear him from the couch.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Later that night my mother asked me to show her Austria on a map.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;She ran a finger over the strange names. And what do they speak there?&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Hitler, my brother offered from the sofa.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;At the end of April, my brother collapsed at a slot machine in Atlantic City and ended up back in Beth Israel and my mother went with him. I think she came home twice that month, and both times I was either in school or out. Left me a note with my name misspelled and a huge pot of moro.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Mr. Wilson often stopped by to ask after her and then he&#39;d sit on our stoop smoking cigarette after cigarette, as though hoping she might suddenly show up.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;On one of those nights, I cadged a cigarette and we smoked quietly for a while.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;My mother says you are a teacher.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I was a teacher. He pretended to write on a chalkboard with great flourish.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Was it a good school?&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;He nodded. My son was really happy there.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I can&#39;t imagine you as a teacher.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;He said something to me. Do you recognize the language?&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I shook my head.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;He spelled out the words: Aegrescit medendo.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;After a while he threw his cigarette away and walked back to his apartment.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;When my brother and mother finally returned to London Terrace, my brother looked like a very handsome cadaver; he had nasty open sores on his arms from where the chemo had leaked out and burned him and I could have circled his wrist with my thumb and index finger. Ready for my closeup or what? my brother said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;You don&#39;t look so good.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;He laughed. I&#39;m going to look a whole lot worse.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;My mother had changed, too. She came back from that final round of chemo with zero patience—everything was wrong, from the water pressure to the noise outside, and she blew up at me at the slightest thing, called me a malcriado, a malparido, a desgraciado. She started attending Mass twice a day and invited some of the local women over at bizarre hours to pray for my brother&#39;s eternal soul. A couple of them even tried to pray over me but by then I didn&#39;t give a fuck about anything and walked right on by.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Mr. Wilson still came around but things weren&#39;t the same as before. My mother never talked to him for long, as though afraid that any shift in her attention might send my brother&#39;s health spiralling.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;How&#39;s your English? he asked in English.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;It good, she replied in an exaggerated way that made them both laugh.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;We all should learn the universal language, he said. El ingles mal hablado.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Mr. Wilson had never been very grounded, but without his son or my mother around he seemed to flounder. Stopped looking for real work altogether, and when he needed money he&#39;d wash dishes at the Peter Pan diner or pump gas up on Route 9 for a few hours. He and his brother were arguing, too, real intense; you could hear them across the parking lot and whether it was because of these spats or everything else, Mr. Wilson started running off to NYC a lot, visiting some Colombians he&#39;d met, staying on their couches until they had enough of him and sent his ass back to NJ&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;ibk74&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;It was on one of those nights that Mr. Wilson broke into our apartment.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;It was, I guess, an honest mistake. Our apartments were mirrors of each other, just on opposite sides of the parking lot. It was three in the morning and dude was mas borracho que el diablo and he tried his key in our door and when that didn&#39;t work he must have decided in a fit of inebriated industry to slide open our kitchen window and wriggle through head first and because he was drunk out of his mind and no ninja, dude face-planted on some dishes and then crashed on the floor, with broken dishes in pursuit.&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot;

My dying brother with his CZ 75, me in my tighty-whities with a baseball bat, and my mother in her bata fumbling with her glasses.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;When we realized that the mumbling mess on the linoleum was Mr. Wilson, relief all around. He&#39;s drunk, my mother announced, and my brother snapped, Se nota.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Come on, let&#39;s go, my brother said. Let&#39;s &lt;em>;go&lt;/em>;.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;But Mr. Wilson refused to budge. This is my house. &lt;em>;You&lt;/em>; get out.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Listen to this motherfucker, my brother said. Pick him up.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I put the bat down, hesitated, and that&#39;s when the whole thing went fucking sideways. One second Mr. Wilson was wallowing on the floor amid the broken dishes and the next second he leaped up like a fucking cobra.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Smashed his entire weight against my skeletal brother, pinning him against the fridge, trying to grab at the CZ 75. If you&#39;ve been to the firing range as often as me and my brother had, you know exactly how dangerous that was. I didn&#39;t have time to think; all I could see was my mother&#39;s big eyes and my brother&#39;s bald head, and I jumped in and grabbed Mr. Wilson&#39;s arm and he fell back, classic judo move, and brought us all down onto the floor.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;We landed on my brother hard, which sucked, but what really sucked was that my brother had his hand on the pistol, Mr. Wilson had his hand on the pistol, I had my hand on the pistol, and somehow in that lucha libre the barrel ended up pointed straight at my eye and no matter how hard I tried I couldn&#39;t pull away or redirect it. Everyone was fighting wildly for the pistol, my brother included, with no regard for my face, and the barrel just got bigger and bigger and everything in me went cold because I knew, in a prophetic out-of-body way, that the CZ 75 was about to cavitate my brains all over the kitchen.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I figured that was it for me, bye-bye, but then my mother shouted &lt;em>;Wilson&lt;/em>;, &lt;em>;estop&lt;/em>;, &lt;em>;estop&lt;/em>;, &lt;em>;estop&lt;/em>; and it was the craziest shit I ever heard, my mom trying to speak English, but he must have heard her because I felt him loosen his grip and with one final twist my brother wrenched the gun away and the black devouring eye of the barrel released me and I dropped back to the real world, to life, in a huge heart-bursting rush.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Put that away, my mother whispered. The police are here.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Our upstairs neighbors, hearing all the commotion, had called them.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;At first it looked like everything was OK The cops didn&#39;t charge in with weapons drawn or shoot my mother or anything crazy like that, but when they tried to herd Mr. Wilson out of our apartment, it was round fucking two. Dude started another fight, but this was even more berserk than the first. Where the fuck did he find the energy? Shouting and kicking and contorting and crying for his son and even those two massive white cops had a hard time controlling him and they all broke just about everything in the kitchen.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;The cops finally pinned him to the ground and the older one jammed the cuffs on, and that was when Mr. Wilson started really screaming. And when I say screaming, I mean &lt;em>;screaming&lt;/em>;. A scream that must have reached to Madison Park, to South Amboy, to New York fucking City. The kind of scream that I never want to hear again as long as I live. You would have thought that someone had plunged a red-hot dagger straight into Mr. Wilson&#39;s heart. My mother, who had been watching the battle in stunned silence, crumpled like she&#39;d been poleaxed.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Remember how I said I experienced my second blast of pure terror because of Mr. Wilson? You might have thought it was the whole pistol-in-the-face moment, which was fucking scary—but it was that scream. That horrible, horrible scream.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Real story: During my first year in the US, my first year with my father, he liked to take my brother and me down to the basement and make us look at a collection of fotos he had. In order to toughen us up, to make us dique soldiers. These were from his good old days back on the island: fotos of men and women handcuffed naked to the same metal chair in what must have been a cuartel, probably the one he&#39;d been assigned to. Some of the people were alive; some of them weren&#39;t. During these toughening-up sessions, if either my brother or I looked away my father slapped us, hard, so of course we didn&#39;t look away. We saw.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;My mother must have found out, because a short time later those sessions ended. Still, those fotos and the whole ghoulish ritual of being summoned to the basement became once and forever the definition of terror for me, and I still have nightmares even now that I&#39;m in my fifties and live a cosseted middle-class immigrant life.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Foto after foto of young dead Dominicans. But you know what? Mr. Wilson&#39;s scream, if you can believe it, was worse.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In Colombia he&#39;d been tortured for seven weeks straight. They beat him with clubs, water-tortured him until his lungs just about burst, put electric shocks on his legs, arms, chest, and, of course, genitals—and forced him to watch others being tortured. The brigada, into whose hands he had fallen, were convinced that he had something to do with the kidnapping and murder of Gloria Lara—who was from una familia muy rica y poderosa, a política so important she had represented Colombia at the UN—but Mr. Wilson&#39;s only crime had been to support a campesino group when he was a young teacher, and since they were the ones who supposedly killed Gloria Lara, the military bashed down his door one night while he was having a beer with his parents.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;All of this he told my mother many years later on the phone.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;This was after he left London Terrace without saying goodbye.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;After he kicked around in NYC for a few years and then immigrated to Austria to be closer to his son.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;After he left Austria because he hated Austria, hated its racism, and because his son barely talked to him anymore, and migrated to Copenhagen at the suggestion of a Colombian acquaintance.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;After he decided that Copenhagen wasn&#39;t for him, either, what with the police stopping him on the tram every day to check his ID to the point where there were days when he could barely leave his apartment.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;He was thinking maybe of returning to Colombia, if he could find the courage, or maybe moving in with a Danish woman he knew who lived in Sweden up near the border with Finland.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Next time I call it might be from the North Pole, he joked.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;New Jersey is warmer, she said, and that was the closest she came, I think, to asking him to return.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;That was the last time he and my mother spoke.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;By then my mother&#39;s hair was all white and she visited my brother&#39;s grave only twice a month as opposed to three or four times a week. She lived in Ridgefield Park, in a house I&#39;d helped her buy.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Do you think he went back to Colombia? I asked her. We were watching one of the Colombian crime dramas that were all the rage on the Spanish-language channels.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I don&#39;t know, she said.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Did you love him?&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;She removed her glasses, rubbed her eyes. Don&#39;t be ridiculous.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;My mother who hadn&#39;t dated anyone after my father left.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Did you at least &lt;em>;like&lt;/em>; him?&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Yes, I &lt;em>;liked&lt;/em>; him, but I never had luck with men.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Do you even remember what he looks like? she asked.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Of course I do, I said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;But the truth was, I didn&#39;t. There were no fotographs of him and no one else in the neighborhood remembered Wilson and Alberto Longo and of course my brother wasn&#39;t around to corroborate.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Sometimes I dream about him, she offered.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Really?&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;She nodded. In the dreams he speaks to me in English and I understand.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;When I dreamed of Mr. Wilson, he often looked like my father or my brother. The dreams didn&#39;t change much. We were in a cuartel or my basement or a classroom and Mr. Wilson would stare at me with an impossible distress until I couldn&#39;t take it anymore and then I&#39;d beg him, in Spanish, Please don&#39;t.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;He never listened. He opened his mouth as wide as you can imagine.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;And I&#39;d brace myself for the scream that never came. ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 30 Oct 2023 18:06:01 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“The Woman in Me,” Reviewed: What Britney Spears’s Memoir Has to Say]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/what-britney-spearss-memoir-has-to-say]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-29T19:33:11.275Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653bed43042a0d0fdf29a02d/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/lmj-britney%20spears.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;article >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attribute-verso-pattern=&quot;article-body&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;ArticlePageChunks&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Our era runs on biography. Stories—in film adaptations, novels, and pop songs alike—are received as the clarion calls of so many “voices.” The myth of an unencumbered, &lt;em>;authentic&lt;/em>; voice persists. Even if it&#39;s never quite found, we find value in the searching. It was foreseeable, then, that readers would make much of a new memoir from the pop star &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/american-chronicles/britney-spears-conservatorship-nightmare&quot;>;Britney Spears&lt;/a>;, whose prevailing story for much of her adult life has been one of silencing.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;We know the story by now. In 2008, after a series of messy public episodes, zealously documented by the tabloid press, Spears was hospitalized in a psychiatric facility and her father successfully petitioned a California court for a conservatorship, deeming Spears unfit to make personal and financial decisions on her own behalf. But Spears did not disappear from public life. What happened instead was somehow eerier. She continued to release mega-selling albums. She graced the small screen, covered magazines, and performed onstage many, many, many, many, many times, including during a four-year residency in Las Vegas. But her fans sensed something sinister at work beneath her industriousness, and they took up a rallying cry: “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-online-movement-to-freebritney&quot;>;Free Britney&lt;/a>;.” By 2021, a swell in media coverage, including original reporting by this magazine, created a broad awareness that Spears had been severely stripped of her personal autonomy and forced to work against her will. But reporting is not direct testimony. Neither is music, even if it&#39;s often mined for hidden messages. With Spears keeping mum about her situation, onlookers instead became scholars of her Instagram account, interpreting every dance video and emoji-laden caption as evidence of her stifled condition.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“There was so much guessing about what I must have thought or felt,” Spears recalls of that time in “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Woman-Me-Britney-Spears/dp/1668009048&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Woman-Me-Britney-Spears/dp/1668009048&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Woman-Me-Britney-Spears/dp/1668009048&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;The Woman in Me&lt;/a>;.” She finally spoke on an afternoon in June, 2021, during a hearing at a Los Angeles probate court that was made public at her request. “My voice. It was everywhere, all over the world—on the radio, on television, on the internet—but there were so many parts of me that had been suppressed,” Spears writes in the book. “The Woman in Me” is Spears&#39;s most substantial address to the public outside of social media since she was released from the conservatorship, in 2021. Physically, it is a slight object—two hundred and eighty-eight pages, with plenty of white space therein—and as I read I wondered how it could possibly withstand the enormity of expectations. The memoir arrives at a time when patience for Spears&#39;s behavior is waning once again. With varying measures of good faith, fans and other gawkers have been wringing their hands over, for instance, a video that Spears recently posted online showing her dancing with a pair of chef&#39;s knives. (The Los Angeles &lt;em>;Times&lt;/em>; reported that after seeing the video someone close to Spears called the police for a “wellness check.”) In an unsettling echo of the two-thousands, pop-culture prognosticators are back to reading the tea leaves—the cup is Instagram—and asking, &lt;em>;Is Britney OK&lt;/em>;?&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;That is to say, there is the sense that this memoir must answer to, if not for, quite a lot. Meanwhile, before the book had even hit shelves, it was being combed for salacious sound bites, which circulated on blogs naked of context, intensifying the sense that a major revelation was afoot. Readers taken in by the frenzy may find themselves disappointed. “The Woman in Me” (written with the assistance of the journalist Sam Lansky) is not the last word. It is not even a tell-all. Spears, too, is still searching.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Britney Jean Spears was raised up in the country town of Kentwood, Louisiana. Her life was, for a time, quintessentially Southern, flanked by the twin pillars of family and faith. A child did not speak unless spoken to, and whatever traumas haunted the Spears familial line were crystallized into a familial truism: “It was said that the Spears men tended to be bad news,” she writes. Her paternal grandfather, one of Baton Rouge&#39;s boys in blue, was, as Spears puts it plainly, “abusive.” His wife, Jean, died, by suicide, when Spears&#39;s father, Jamie, was thirteen, leaving a middle name to the granddaughter she never got to meet. Jamie channelled the hell of his childhood into the little family that he eventually made. During Britney&#39;s childhood, he was “reckless, cold, and mean,” and a nasty drunkard. He and Spears&#39;s mother, Lynne, fought for hours into the night, well after, as far as Spears could tell, her father was coherent enough to participate, a routine that, she admits, embittered her toward her mother. “Isn&#39;t that awful?” she writes. “He was the one who was drunk.” (Representatives for Jamie Spears did not respond to a request for comment.)&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Still, Spears depicts her home town with golden fondness. Their home was a “zoo,” but it was also, “for lack of a better word, the cool house,” a gathering place for friends and gossipy moms. Spears charts the beginnings of a normal adolescence—a first cigarette, illicit Daiquiris, cutting class, sex with a high-school senior who also happened to be the best friend of her older brother. Even as show biz began to intervene, the gravity of home remained potent. “For a minute, I had to let normalcy win,” Spears writes.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;One imagines that Spears might have lived her best and died in Kentwood if not for gospel music. The Spearses were “very poor,” but, before the drink took hold, Jamie had a couple of businesses that did well enough that the family could hire help from time to time. One day, Spears overheard their housekeeper singing gospel, and it was, she recalls, “an awakening to a whole new world,” a place where Spears could “communicate purely.” She writes, “When I sing, I own who I am.” Spears, who came to be seen as a lip-synching foil to Christina Aguilera&#39;s big voice, is rarely classed as a vocalist, but she and her onetime rival—who is treated gently in the memoir in spite of their rumored bad blood—are more alike than not in the origins of their craft. Like Aguilera and their generation of stars, Spears was enchanted by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-complexities-of-whitney-houston-in-whitney&quot;>;Whitney Houston&lt;/a>;, by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-elusive-mariah-careys-new-memoir&quot;>;Mariah Carey&lt;/a>;, by, as Spears calls it in a 1999 documentary, “soulful” music. She also loved to dance—and shoot hoops—but singing was the thing. Singing beckoned God. It also beckoned fame.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Time moves swiftly in “The Woman in Me.” In one chapter, Spears is four years old, singing “What Child Is This?” in white tights for the Christmas program at her mother&#39;s workplace. Not ten pages later, she is eight, auditioning for the All New Mickey Mouse Club alongside “a beautiful girl from California” named Keri Russell and “a girl from Pennsylvania,” Aguilera. Soon thereafter, Spears is competing on “Star Search,” losing to “a bolo-tie-wearing boy with a lot of hair spray,” and then understudying for an Off Broadway musical beside “a talented young actress named Natalie Portman.” The producer Max Martin, whose collaborations with Britney helped clinch his status as the No. 1 go-to for pop girls, strolls into the story at fifty pages on the dot.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;One interpretation of the narrative&#39;s breakneck pace might be that life is frenetic for anyone who becomes as famous as Spears did before her eighteenth birthday. Spears sketches, briefly but tellingly, the story of “ . 。 。 Baby One More Time,” her smash-hit first single. She&#39;d purposefully stayed awake late the night before recording in order to effect the “fried,” “gravelly” timbre that became her vocal signature. More important, “Max listened to me,” she writes. “When I said I wanted more R&amp;amp;B in my voice, less straight pop, he knew what I meant and he made it happen.” She similarly recounts her experience working with Nigel Dick, who directed the song&#39;s music video. The school setting, the uniforms, cueing the start of choreography with the ringing of the school bell: these were all her ideas. She recalls that time as “probably the moment in my life when I had the most passion for music.” But what happened next she sums up dispassionately. “On January 12, 1999, the album came out and sold over ten million copies very quickly. I debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 chart in the US,” Spears writes, adding, “I didn&#39;t have to perform in malls anymore.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;An interesting discrepancy develops in the text. It becomes clear that Spears has limited interest in some of what we onlookers might consider the touchstones of her career. Max Martin, with whom she has collaborated on four albums, is never mentioned in the book again. Spears devotes a small shrug of a paragraph to the notorious &lt;em>;Rolling Stone&lt;/em>; cover shot by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/photo-booth/what-can-david-lachapelles-celebrity-fuelled-fantasias-tell-us-now&quot;>;David LaChapelle&lt;/a>;, showing Spears styled as what might be described as a sexy baby: “My mother seemed concerned, but I knew that I wanted to work with David LaChapelle again.” By contrast, Spears lingers over her chance meetings with the singer-songwriters Paula Cole and Mariah Carey—“And no, I can&#39;t say just her first name. To me she is always going to be &lt;em>;Mariah Carey&lt;/em>;.” Of her own star power at that time, she writes, mechanically, “Meanwhile, I was breaking records, becoming one of the best-selling female artists of all time. People kept calling me the Princess of Pop.” If memoir serves as a living postmortem of sorts, in “The Woman in Me,” Spears sees no need to probe the innards of her stardom.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Instead, Spears&#39;s most reflective passages, peppered with clusters of queries for a sympathetic reader, are reserved for her most wounding personal relationships, and the way that, rather than buffer the onslaught of the world, those closest to her accelerated the rate and severity of her overexposure. Take, for instance, that charlatan &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tag/justin-timberlake&quot;>;Justin Timberlake&lt;/a>;. (Already I&#39;m betraying more ire toward him than she does.) After connecting as fellow-Mouseketeers and charting their respective paths to radio ubiquity—he as a member of the boy band &#39;N Sync—they bonded over their parallel experiences of pop stardom. Spears fell “so in love with him it was pathetic,” she confesses. She is gushy about their romance and only a tad chagrined by the strength of her former feeling. Spears&#39;s account of what took place during that relationship has already provided grist for a million headlines in recent days. She depicts Timberlake&#39;s wigger antics in dialogue (“Oh yeah, fo shiz fo shiz . . . what&#39;s up homie?”) that turns hilariously farcical on “The Woman in Me” &#39;s audiobook, which is narrated by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tag/michelle-williams&quot;>;Michelle Williams&lt;/a>; (the white one). Spears writes that she got pregnant and felt pressured by Timberlake to get an abortion, and, in one almost surreal passage, how the pain from the pills left her sobbing in pain on the bathroom floor as Timberlake tries to soothe her by strumming his guitar. For some readers, the book will add to a distaste for Timberlake that has ballooned in recent years as the public reëvaluates his early career triumphs and the women, such as Spears and Janet Jackson, who served as collateral. Even at a time when skuzzy men seem poised to make a comeback, he has been unable to escape the whiff of calculated misogyny. (Representatives for Timberlake did not respond to a request for comment.)&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;g8uzy&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;srpluo&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;But these are the public&#39;s grievances. Spears didn&#39;t mind, the way we might mind, when Timberlake disclosed details of their sex life to the press. (“Why did my managers work so hard to claim I was some kind of young-girl virgin even into my twenties?”) Spears writes that Timberlake cheated, he bragged, he lied; he broke up with her via text message while she was at work. Yet his greatest offense, in Spears&#39;s portrayal, was misrepresenting the inner sanctum of their relationship in his music. His solo album “Justified,” released months after their breakup, was anchored by the single “Cry Me a River,” the well-produced whine of a betrayed lover. The music video featured a Spears lookalike on the prowl while Timberlake “wanders around sad in the rain,” as Spears puts it. His aestheticized spin on things was permitted to become the accepted truth.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Everyone, it seemed, including Diane Sawyer, expected the twenty-one-year-old to atone for breaking a dear boy&#39;s heart. “I see how men are encouraged to talk trash about women in order to become famous and powerful,” Spears writes. “But I was shattered.” The “but” is conspicuous, as though Spears were apologizing for being undone by a conventional form of sexism that had been bearable when she still had &lt;em>;him&lt;/em>;. Spears writes that the breakup and the ensuing circus caused her to feel as though her public pillorying were somehow karmic, deserved. She felt isolated and drifted unnoticed back home in Kentwood like a “ghost child,” or disappeared for interminable stretches into her four-story apartment—Cher&#39;s old place—in NoHo. After an interview with Sawyer, sprung by her team without notice, Spears “felt something dark come over my body.” That mood becomes the book&#39;s new atmosphere.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;What follows are the exploits of a twentysomething on the rebound: the Vegas nights with Paris Hilton, the Vegas wedding to a childhood friend. They can be encapsulated in two words: &lt;em>;“Hello, alcohol!”&lt;/em>; The dumbassery is so benign—or, at the very least, so ordinary—that it barely qualifies as rebellion. But the more Spears was treated like a child, the more she felt like one, and she diminished herself in kind, even as her family members—her father, mother, brother, sister, and, soon, her new husband, Kevin Federline—benefitted from her largesse. On a rare reprieve from work, owing to another knee injury, she and Federline, a backup dancer at the time, met in the back of a Hollywood club. They ended up in a swimming pool, where Federline held Spears—“and I mean held me”—for hours. In Spears&#39;s telling, Federline represented no more or less than the promise of any romance, the hope that another person might carry you. “I&#39;m sorry, I know it sounds regressive,” Spears apologizes. But the desire to submit to someone is also, Spears ventures, “a human impulse.” It&#39;s a shame that she, “like a lot of women,” would be punished for it.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The second half of the memoir charts Spears&#39;s life from the lead-up of the thirteen-year conservatorship to its aftermath. Here the intricate work of being a pop star recedes even further as she recounts the work of being a person—though it&#39;s worth noting the volume of her labor as a performer during this time. In 2007, she released “Blackout,” an experiment in electronic genres and vocal play (and arguably her best album), which she calls “one of the easiest and most satisfying albums I ever made.” The studio was a reprieve, but only barely. “Blackout,” Spears explains, was made in thirty-minute stints, while the paparazzi accumulated outside the door. She and Federline had two sons, Sean and Jayden, but Spears felt that Federline, another white man in homeboy&#39;s clothing, was not much interested in fatherhood. What he wanted was fame, and proximity to Spears was enough to attract it. “When most people—especially men—get that type of attention, it&#39;s all over,” she warns. (Representatives for Federline did not respond to a request for comment.) As Spears tells it, parenting Sean and Jayden was left to her, and she struggled even as she loved mothering. “I think I knew then that I&#39;d become weird,” Spears admits, recalling the two months when she refused to let her mother hold Jayden. Only later, and perhaps only recently, did Spears realize that her psychological difficulties postpartum might be clinical problems worthy of a diagnosis.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;As it does with other women who strain against patriarchy in public, the instinct to generalize exerts a strong pull on Spears. How many women lose their personal and economic independence precisely when children enter the story? Spears converts her memories into broad messages. She implores mothers in distress to “get help early.” Reflecting on the Timberlake saga, she muses that “there&#39;s always been more leeway in Hollywood for men than for women.” Her writing can also veer into the sort of hammy foreshadowing one might find in a middle grade novel:&lt;/p>;&lt;blockquote >;&lt;div >;&lt;p>;Things are going to change around here! I thought excitedly.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/blockquote>;&lt;p >;And then they did.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;But there is still value in the specifics that this memoir collects. As chilling as the previous reporting has been, Spears&#39;s interior account of the conservatorship is a visceral view of the methodical means by which her family endeavored to eclipse her. Her physical self had never been entirely hers—“Whether it was strangers in the media or within my own family, people seemed to experience my body as public property,” Spears recalls—but the conservatorship gave her father license to formalize his ownership, down to controlling his daughter&#39;s diet, Spears writes. Nor was Spears&#39;s art hers any longer. During her Vegas show, she was barred from giving input, and any ideas that might have revitalized her old work were dismissed, as though a bland show was worth it to undermine her artistic standing.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;l0s0k&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Spears writes that when, during one rehearsal, she declined to do a difficult dance move, her father mobilized the medical establishment to have his daughter committed yet again. “Three months into my confinement, I started to believe that my little heart, whatever made me Britney, was no longer inside my body anymore,” Spears writes. Her mother said, “I don&#39;t know, I don&#39;t know . 。 。 ,” she remembers. She recalls that her younger sister, Jamie Lynn, sent a text: “There&#39;s nothing you can do about it, so stop fighting it.” Her father told her, “I can&#39;t help you at all.” (Spears writes that, later, she learned that he could have initiated her release at any time.) Spears wonders, with apologies to the reader for sounding paranoid, whether her family was actually trying to end her life. A reader can&#39;t help but imagine, with sickening clarity, what kind of narrative might have been fed to the public if her life &lt;em>;had&lt;/em>; ended there.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Even if Spears wants “The Woman in Me” to offer lessons for her readers, the truth is that she was not an everywoman. She is an artist who has experienced a level of success that only a handful of people in the history of the world can claim. At the same time, Spears was not “OK,” and she may never be OK in a prescriptive sense of the word. But proper comportment should not be a prerequisite for human dignity. (Nothing should be.) Toward the end of the memoir, on the other side of her conservatorship—and in the midst of another short-lived marriage, to the personal trainer Sam Asghari—she likens her newfound freedom to a rebirth. Writing a book is often an exercise in putting down what needs to be said in order to liberate oneself to do something else. In Spears&#39;s case, it is also an attempt to become someone else. “It&#39;s time to actually find myself,” she writes. On Instagram, per usual, she is more effusive. “I have moved on and it&#39;s a beautiful clean slate from here !!!” she wrote, even as she teased a volume two. I see no harm in taking her at her word. ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;8z910e&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 30 Oct 2023 04:06:02 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
