data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;推翻于周一晚上开始，伴随着一个恰如其分的少年交换公开嘲讽。 “来吧，”众议院议长凯文·麦卡锡 (Kevin McCarthy) 在下午 7 点 31 分发帖称，“就这么做了，”众议员 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/04 /19/the-gops-matt-gaetz-problem&quot;>;马特·盖茨&lt;/a>;回复道。盖茨是一系列日益对抗的共和党国会议员中的最新成员，在过去的十几年里，他们使共和党控制的国会议长一职成为首都最不可能的职位之一。 （参见：约翰·博纳；保罗·瑞安。）然而，这不仅仅是众议院共和党人不断播放的功能障碍肥皂剧的又一集，而是来自佛罗里达的朋克的袭击，严重程度足以载入史册。图书。盖茨是唐纳德·特朗普的助手，周二，他使用了麦卡锡本人拥有的武器，兑现了数月的威胁。一月份，他首先获得了议长席位，当时他同意一项规则，允许一名议员强制对罢免主席的动议进行投票。这就像给盖茨一把上了膛的枪；他扣动扳​​机是不可避免的。上一次对退出动议进行投票是在 1910 年。约瑟夫·坎农（Joseph Cannon）幸存下来，并成为国会的传奇人物之一，一位铁腕统治者，他的名字今天装饰着众议院三座主要办公楼之一。可以肯定地推测，没有人会为凯文·麦卡锡命名任何建筑物。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;在周二下午的投票之前，麦卡锡似乎有可能彻底获胜，或者在更多轮投票失败后失败但幸存下来产生一个可行的替代方案。但没有人知道如果他输了并退出会发生什么。很大程度上取决于民主党的决定：他们是否会救助议长，因为议长在众议院仅拥有五个席位，而超过五名共和党人准备投票反对他，突然需要他们的选票才能继续掌权？少数党领袖哈基姆·杰弗里斯在这出戏剧开始前不久发布的一封信中说，答案是否定的。这是共和党人必须自己解决的“共和党内战”。其他民主党人则更加坚决地拒绝与麦卡锡达成协议，他们不仅斥责麦卡锡多年来对特朗普的谄媚，而且在最近几个月违背了他的诺言。 /乔-拜登&quot;>;拜登总统&lt;/a>;。毕竟，你如何与一个被弗吉尼亚州温和派民主党人阿比盖尔·斯潘伯格称为“可能是有史以来最没有原则的众议院议长”的人妥协呢？话又说回来，这里是华盛顿，所以不能完全排除与民主党达成协议的可能性。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;这次叛乱是由盖茨和他的一小群盟友组成的，他们对麦卡锡的罪行大肆咆哮。 。他们的直接愤怒大多与麦卡锡周六的决定有关。避免政府关闭&lt;/a>;，通过一项为期四十五天的持续决议，该决议将暂时保持美国商业开放，同时国会努力通过其余的年度支出法案。这种最后一刻的举动在国会山很常见，很难成为采取史无前例的罢免议长的理由。根据盖茨的说法，麦卡锡的罪魁祸首是与民主党合作，这给整个诉讼程序带来了特别荒谬的感觉，因为盖茨将依靠民主党选票来罢免麦卡锡，而且他本人也是从民主党阵营中提出这一点的。麦卡锡的盟友阻止他使用共和党控制的麦克风发表讲话。至于民主党，他们在整个辩论中保持沉默，恪守明智的政治规则，即当你的对手忙着搬起石头砸自己的脚时，最好给他们空间。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;最终，仅用了大约两个小时，共和党会议的八名成员就使麦卡锡成为自 1876 年以来任期最短的众议院议长，当时迈克尔·克尔在任职仅九个月后就因肺结核去世。晚上 7 点 30 分，麦卡锡召开了一场新闻发布会，听起来很像是为自己写的悼词——长篇大论，短篇自省。至于接下来会发生什么，目前定于下周三举行新议长选举，但事实是，没有人真正知道会发生什么。美国众议院已停止运作。共和党占多数，难以控制，少数则一意孤行。盖茨和他的同伴是没有真正原因的反叛者，除了混乱本身。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;政治讣告作者不会像麦卡锡对待自己那样善待他。事实证明，第五十五任众议院议长是美国历史上最软弱的人之一，他的首要野心似乎只是为了获得这份工作本身，而事实证明，他愿意达成一项糟糕的协议来获得这份工作。可预测的毁灭。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;本质上&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/12/26/what-kevin-mccarthy-will-do-to-gain-power作为一名妥协主义者，麦卡锡被他多年来一直试图安抚的党团内不断壮大的特朗普势力打倒了。从这个意义上说，他的耻辱就是共和党的耻辱——一次又一次向特朗普低头，却遭到越来越多无理要求的耻辱。麦卡锡是绥靖政策行不通的现代证明。&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;他对特朗普和特朗普派的拍马屁记录太长，无法完整叙述。也许只要回想起特朗普给他起了个绰号“我的凯文”就足够了，据报道，在特朗普担任总统期间，麦卡锡向白宫寄了一罐特朗普最喜欢的星爆糖果，其中除了他最喜欢的红色和粉色糖果之外，都被精心挑选出来。然而，1 月 6 日支持特朗普的暴徒袭击美国国会大厦后，麦卡锡的恶劣行为才真正证明他是一个无可救药的走狗。&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=据报道，麦卡锡对当天发生的事件感到愤怒，愤怒地打电话给特朗普，并指责他应对暴行负责。在接下来的几天里，他继续在公开场合和私下批评特朗普——“我已经受够了这个人了，”他在录音中对共和党领导人同僚怒气冲冲地说道。然而，他和会议上的绝大多数人一起投票支持特朗普关于不存在的选民欺诈的谎言运动​​，并拒绝证明拜登的当选。几周之内，麦卡锡飞往海湖庄园与落败的前总统合影——这一视觉效果表明共和党决定不会一劳永逸地驱除特朗普，而是会继续支持他。&lt;/p>;&lt;p然而，尽管麦卡锡为特朗普所做的一切，特朗普拒绝介入并采取任何措施来挽救麦卡锡脆弱的议长职位也就不足为奇了。相反，特朗普公开为盖茨等人欢呼，他们因麦卡锡疯狂的努力而推动政府关门。随着政变的展开，盖茨兴高采烈地告诉记者，他已经与前总统进行了交谈。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;麦卡锡徒劳地试图继续掌权，对众议院造成的损害不能仅用抽象来衡量。他的让步实在是太真实了。举例来说，他上个月突然对拜登展开弹劾调查，调查的依据是多年来未经证实的指控，即拜登可能从他儿子可疑的外国商业交易中受益&lt;a href=&quot;https:// www.newyorker.com/tag/hunter-biden&quot;>;猎人&lt;/a>;。长期以来，这一直是特朗普及其在众议院最直言不讳的支持者的主要要求之一。但麦卡锡曾承诺，未经众议院全体投票，不会采取这样的步骤，然后，当他没有获得选票时，无论如何还是单方面这样做了。既然麦卡锡走了，调查不会神奇地消失。相反，其主要支持者之一——俄亥俄州共和党人吉姆乔丹&lt;/a>;——周三成为第一位宣布取代麦卡锡议长的候选人。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;麦卡锡在为战争提供资金方面采取的危险边缘政策也是如此。 .newyorker.com/tag/ukraine&quot;>;乌克兰&lt;/a>;。他声称自己是乌克兰的坚定支持者，但在他的会议上，面对对继续向乌克兰提供财政支持的反对声不断增加——再次是在特朗普的推动下——他取消了参议院提出的持续决议中的乌克兰美元，以避免乌克兰的经济崩溃。关闭。他还拒绝就拜登政府8月份向国会提交的240亿美元乌克兰补充拨款采取行动。新议长真的会想通过支持乌克兰来对抗叛军吗？&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;这都是麦卡锡混乱的一部分。不要相信任何说清理很容易的人。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;麦卡锡本人在告别新闻发布会上被问到他对新议长有什么建议。 “改变规则，”他微笑着说。像那么简单就好了。 ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot;

政权罗德里戈·杜特尔特(Rodrigo Duterte)，赢得总统职位的省长，承诺在不经过审判甚至逮捕的情况下处决吸毒者或任何他认为威胁公共秩序的人。伊万杰利斯塔不是专家。她是 Rappler 的一名警察记者，该网站是由 2021 年诺贝尔和平奖共同获得者玛丽亚·雷萨 (Maria Ressa) 共同创立的独立网站。每天晚上，伊万格丽斯塔都会走进马尼拉的大街小巷，看看杜特尔特国家批准的暴力行为的残骸，布满弹孔的尸体在阴沟里冷却，无聊的警察对着收音机无用地嘀咕着。她写下了名字、历史，并注意细节的正确性——这是她纪念死者及其家人的方式。在她的新闻报道和长期调查中，伊万格丽斯塔本质上是在记录一位当选的暴君兑现了竞选承诺的“成就”。他的诚实是用血写成的。杜特尔特时代的一位义务警员给伊万杰利斯塔起了这样的称号：“我真的不是一个坏人，”他说。 “有些人需要杀戮。”据人权组织称，杜特尔特的法外暴行导致一万人死亡。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;随着时间的推移，&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tag/donald-trump&quot;>;唐纳德特朗普对于自己的意图的诚实程度不亚于罗德里戈·杜特尔特。 （事实上​​，特朗普是一位崇拜者；2017年，他祝贺杜特尔特在“毒品问题”上所做的“令人难以置信的工作”。毫无疑问，特朗普也很高兴杜特尔特将巴拉克·奥巴马称为“妓女的儿子” ”）最近几周，特朗普明确表示，他的第二任期计划与杜特尔特的计划一样令人难以置信，同样具有报复性或精神错乱。我们应该听。这些是竞选承诺。多年来，特朗普一直隐藏在众目睽睽之下——他毫不掩饰自己的偏执、无法无天、追求独裁权力的意志；相反，他为其做广告，最令人不安的是，这加深了他的吸引力。更重要的是，毫无疑问，特朗普将暴力呼吁正常化为政治工具，以至于激怒了无数人采取不正当行动。特朗普一直很高兴他能够通过含蓄或明确的复仇呼吁来激起群众的兴趣，从他的警告“把她关起来！”在一次集会上，他对一名抗议者傻笑，“我真想打他的脸。”他是夏洛茨维尔的灵感来源。 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/american-chronicles/the-devastating-new-history-of-the-january-sixth-insurrection&quot;>;1 月 6 日&lt;/a>;的起义是这是对他对支持者的呼吁的直接回应：“在那里，将会很疯狂！”在乔治·弗洛伊德被谋杀后的抗议活动中根据前国防部长马克·埃斯珀的说法，特朗普问他的顾问，“你不能直接开枪射击他们吗？直接朝他们的腿开枪什么的？”根据最近的一份&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/24/us/politics/trump-prosecutions-threats-violence.html&quot;>;报告&lt;/a>;&lt;em>;自去年对海湖庄园的合法搜查以及随后没收那里的机密文件导致特朗普向联邦当局发泄愤怒以来，针对联邦调查局人员和设施的威胁猛增了三倍以上百分之百。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;现在特朗普的言辞变本加厉。没有什么他不会说的。他暗示前参谋长联席会议主席马克·米利犯有“叛国罪”，并表示最好的制裁就是处决。 （“这种行为如此恶劣，在过去，惩罚会是&lt;em>;死亡&lt;/em>;！”）&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;最近在加利福尼亚州阿纳海姆的一次演讲中，特朗普解释了如何如果再次当选，他将解决入店行窃问题：“非常简单：如果你抢劫一家商店，你完全可以预料到在离开那家商店时会被枪杀。”特朗普补充道，“他们向你开枪的消息将在几分钟之内传出，有一天，我们的国家将变成一个完全不同的地方。盗窃、破坏和破坏我们国家必须受到报应。”这与特朗普对执法的总体看法是一致的：他提出了射杀试图越境的移民的可能性。 （他说，移民正在“毒害我们国家的血液”，这是一种特别法西斯主义的说法。）&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;特朗普的连任竞选活动不可避免地在各个法庭及其周围进行。是在传统的讲台上。这位曾经和未来的独裁者决定将自己的法律风险作为一种美德，将自己描绘成一个受迫害的普通人，勇敢地面对充满虚伪的检察系统。 8 月，在华盛顿处理特朗普 2020 年选举干涉案的一名联邦治安法官警告他不要威胁或恐吓证人的一天后，他在网上发布了这样的内容：“&lt;em>;如果你追我，我也会追你”你！”在纽约，特朗普民事欺诈案的法官阿瑟·恩戈伦(Arthur Engoron)不得不发布禁言令，因为这位前总统毫无根据地将一名法庭书记员称为“舒默的女朋友”，并补充道，“多么可耻！这个案子应该立即驳回！！”恩戈隆命令特朗普删除该帖子，不过，当然，损害已经造成：消息传出后，法院书记员可能会面临无休止的网上骚扰，甚至更糟。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;特朗普即使在他随意的旁白。他在加利福尼亚州对共和党人发表讲话时，谴责“疯狂的”南希·佩洛西“毁了旧金山”。然后他咧嘴一笑，即兴说道：“顺便问一下，她丈夫怎么样了？有人知道吗？ （当然，这里指的是保罗·佩洛西，他去年被一名闯入佩洛西家的挥舞着锤子的男子袭击并受重伤。）人群的笑声和演讲者一样令人不安。我们对此充满期待。&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;这些不仅仅是轶事，也不是来自熟悉来源的即兴脾气的“多彩”时刻。 （“唐纳德就是唐纳德！”）不，这些时刻才是特朗普及其竞选活动的精髓。在接下来的一年里，你将很少（如果有的话）听到特朗普对政策的讨论。你会听到愤怒和冲动的表情。人们很容易忽视它们，认为它们无关紧要、重复且具有腐蚀性。无论是在仇恨中还是在频率上，听这些话都让人感到痛苦，以至于一些人认为媒体应该完全忽视它们，最​​好避免抬高它们。但忽视它们并不会让它们消失。他们是候选人的核心，民意调查结果非常高，并且威胁到了我们政治中的许多正派或有前途的东西。特朗普的愤怒是一切事情的灵感来源，从“骄傲男孩”到向政治目标邮寄管状炸弹，更不用说众议院共和党核心小组中大部分人的疯狂行为了。与此同时，一群表面上是特朗普提名竞争对手的共和党人几乎没有批评他。由于道德上的怯懦，他们竞选是为了获得关注，为了品牌目的，或者也许是为了在新的特朗普政府中获得一席之地。&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt; div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;同时，需要特别注意对比鲜明的气质和价值观。上周，&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tag/joe-biden&quot;>;乔·拜登&lt;/a>;在亚利桑那州发表了一次鲜明而重要的演讲，重点不是他在经济、国内和外交政策，但他可能的2024年对手及其追随者对民主理想和制度构成的威胁。他直接表示，特朗普的灵感不是来自宪法或人类尊严，而是来自“复仇和报复”。同样令拜登担忧的是对特朗普不断威胁的反应（或缺乏反应）。他说，特朗普对米利发表评论后，普遍的沉默“震耳欲聋”。&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;“我们都应该记住：民主国家不必死在步枪的末端，”拜登说。 “当人们保持沉默时，当他们无法站起来时，他们就会死。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;拜登可能会用不太洪亮的声音说出这句话。年龄已经削弱了他的演讲的高调。但他所说的、他所描述的利害关系，需要放大。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;2016 年，当罗德里戈·杜特尔特 (Rodrigo Duterte) 竞选菲律宾总统时，他用世界各地强人熟悉的声音说道：“忘记法律吧关于人权。 。 。 。你们这些毒贩、劫匪、无所事事的人。 。 。我会把你们全都扔进马尼拉湾，然后把那里的鱼都养肥。”他说，如果他或他的安全部队面临起诉，他将签发豁免书：“罗德里戈·杜特尔特因多项谋杀罪而获得赦免，签署为罗德里戈·杜特尔特。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;这是精神上的表现唐纳德·特朗普的敏感度似乎是赢得共和党提名的锁定之手，并且很有可能重返白宫。法治、全球和国家安全、环境的命运在很大程度上取决于美国人是拒绝他的愤怒还是支持他的愤怒，从而使这个国家面目全非。帕特里夏·伊万格丽斯塔在她的书中将自己描述为“一个我无法承认是我自己国家的公民”。我们准备好有同样的感觉了吗？ ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot;

>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;When it first opened in theatres, in the fall of 1984, “Stop Making Sense,” directed by Jonathan Demme and starring the rock group Talking Heads, was quickly recognized as one of the finest concert films ever made. Reviewer after reviewer settled on the word “exhilarating” to describe the experience of watching an expanded nine-member iteration of the four-piece group perform sixteen of their best-known songs in an uninterrupted sequence of dynamically staged and photographed musical vignettes. In the pages of this magazine, Pauline Kael &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1984/11/26/three-cheers-2&quot;>;praised&lt;/a>; the film as “close to perfection,” and described the Heads front man, David Byrne, as “a stupefying performer.” “He&#39;s so white he&#39;s almost mock-white,” Kael wrote, “and so are his jerky, long-necked, mechanical-man movements. He seems fleshless, bloodless; he might &lt;em>;almost&lt;/em>; be a Black man&#39;s parody of how a clean-cut white man moves. But Byrne himself is the parodist, and he commands the stage by his hollow-eyed, frosty verve.” Similarly effusive sentiments were echoed by critics across the country. If such a thing as Rotten Tomatoes had existed at the time, “Stop Making Sense” would surely have ranked in the high nineties.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Based on the band&#39;s insistence that the film be seen only in theatres, they initially refused permission for it to be made available on videotape or shown on cable TV. In the decades since, each release of “Stop Making Sense” on a new medium––VHS, DVD, Blu-ray, and streaming––has been greeted with fresh praise from succeeding generations of viewers and critics. Now, in anticipation of the film&#39;s fortieth anniversary, the original negative has been reprocessed in a high-resolution 4K format, and reissued, once again, for theatrical release. In the interests of promoting the film they collectively own, the four former Talking Heads––Byrne, Jerry Harrison, Tina Weymouth, and Chris Frantz––have taken part in a series of panel discussions and media events at screenings in Toronto, New York, and Los Angeles. This marks the first time that the band has appeared together in public since 2002, when the group, which officially dissolved under contentious circumstances in 1991, was inducted into the Rock &amp;amp; Roll Hall of Fame.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The New York-based film director &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-loss-of-jonathan-demme&quot;>;Jonathan Demme&lt;/a>;, who died in 2017, was forty years old at the time that he made “Stop Making Sense.” He had been an avid fan of Talking Heads since he first saw the band perform at Wollman Rink, in Central Park, in the summer of 1979. (“The four of them stood there like statues on this platform,” he recalled.) The following year, Demme achieved his breakthrough as a director with “Melvin and Howard,” a bittersweet comedy about a chance encounter in the Nevada desert between an unemployed factory worker and the eccentric billionaire Howard Hughes. He next saw Talking Heads perform in Los Angeles in the summer of 1983, and was stunned by the change in the band. The four former statues had turned into a dynamic, interracial troupe of singers, dancers, and instrumentalists performing exuberantly arranged and choreographed versions of their songs. He quickly contacted the group through a mutual friend and pitched the idea of filming their show. As fans of “Melvin and Howard,” the Heads agreed to work with Demme after hearing his thoughts about how––and how &lt;em>;not&lt;/em>;––to present them onscreen. On the advice of their manager, Gary Kurfirst, the group financed the film themselves, with the help of an advance from their record label, in order to retain ownership and full creative control.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;For his part, Demme made it clear that he wanted to focus the whole production solely on the band&#39;s performance. Unexceptional as this might sound, it was a departure from the way that rock concerts had previously been presented on film, from Richard Lester&#39;s mock-documentary “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/dvd-of-the-week-a-hard-days-night&quot;>;A Hard Day&#39;s Night&lt;/a>;” to Martin Scorsese&#39;s “The Last Waltz,” by dispensing with a “backstory” of the musicians coming and going; the logistics of staging the show; interviews with the band members, promoters, and fans; and the fervent response of the crowd. Instead, Demme proposed to simply film the band onstage, expertly, while avoiding the rhythmic, fast-paced, jump-cut style of editing associated with the music videos being shown on the recently established platform MTV. The apparent austerity of this approach conformed to the minimalist art-school aesthetic that Talking Heads had embraced since they first emerged as the albino in the herd of ragtag bands that got their starts in the mid-seventies at CBGB, the dive bar on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/personal-history/the-two-sides-of-the-bowery&quot;>;the Bowery&lt;/a>; that served, for a few brief years, as the breeding ground of punk. In those days, surrounded by posturing rock romantics such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/contributors/patti-smith&quot;>;Patti Smith&lt;/a>;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-new-yorker-interview/how-richard-hell-found-his-vocation&quot;>;Television&lt;/a>;, and the Ramones, the Heads sought to make a virtue of their musical and theatrical limitations by adopting a performance style that was initially “defined by [its] negatives,” as Byrne described it, consisting of “no rock moves or poses, no pomp or drama, no rock hair, no rock lights . 。 。 no rehearsed stage patter,” and, perhaps most telling, “no singing like a Black man.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;By 1983, Talking Heads had come a long way, musically and otherwise, from the austere, frozen tableau they&#39;d presented during their incubation at CBGB and their early concerts. They added a capable fourth member on keyboards and guitar, Jerry Harrison (whose Harvard degree burnished their highbrow reputation), achieved a hard-earned proficiency on their instruments, and recorded five critically acclaimed and commercially profitable studio albums, three of them made under the aesthetic spell of the polymath British producer &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/07/07/ambient-genius&quot;>;Brian Eno&lt;/a>;. In the course of that evolution, they jettisoned many of the musical and theatrical restrictions they had originally placed on themselves, beginning with the proscription on singing like a Black man, which yielded to a brilliantly understated rendition of Al Green&#39;s “Take Me to the River” that earned them a Top Forty hit and revealed their musical affinity for the stately, churchy backbeats of Memphis soul.&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;The expanded version of Talking Heads that appears in the film was the culmination of a process that began in the fall of 1980, following the release of the band&#39;s fourth album, “Remain in Light,” when Byrne and Harrison realized that the densely layered arrangements on the record, many of which reflected the polyrhythmic influence of Afro-pop artists like Fela Kuti and King Sunny Adé, could not be reproduced in concert by a four-piece group. This led to the addition, on short notice, of five additional members—Adrian Belew on guitar, Bernie Worrell on keyboards, Steve Scales on percussion, Busta Jones on bass, and Dolette McDonald on backing vocals—all but one of whom were African American. This gave the band a biracial composition that was highly unusual at the end of a decade when the audience for popular music in the United States had become substantially resegregated into the tribes of white punk and hard rock on the one hand, Black funk and disco on the other. The expanded Heads toured the US and Europe that fall to an enthusiastic reception.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;They then took a year-long sabbatical, during which Byrne burrowed deeper into the downtown avant-garde by collaborating with the choreographer &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-new-yorker-interview/twyla-tharp-never-stops&quot;>;Twyla Tharp&lt;/a>; on a dance piece called “The Catherine Wheel,” Harrison recorded a solo album, and Frantz and Weymouth formed a band of their own called Tom Tom Club, whose willfully inane single “Genius of Love” became a dance-club standard and radio hit. Talking Heads reunited with slightly different personnel in 1982 to tour in Japan, Europe, and the States, after which they recorded their first self-produced album, “Speaking in Tongues,” which spun off their first and only Top Ten single, “Burning Down the House.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;The 1983 tour documented in “Stop Making Sense” began in August and ran through the end of the year. The four original Heads were joined by two mainstays of the expanded band, the keyboardist Worrell and the percussionist Scales, along with an ebullient new guitarist, Alex Weir, and a pair of backup singers, Lynn Mabry and Ednah Holt, who added a fresh jolt of kinetic energy to the group. But the most dramatic change was the transformation in David Byrne, who drew on the lessons that he had learned in his work with Tharp and the choreographer Toni Basil (with whom he had made a number of music videos) to turn the songs in the band&#39;s live show into a series of individual set pieces, each with its own distinct choreography, lighting, and, in one spectacular instance, costume design. Byrne then arranged these songs into three half-hour segments, tracing a loose narrative arc that reflected the formation and artistic evolution of the band.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The film begins with Byrne alone on an empty stage with a solo version of what he considered the first “real” song he ever wrote, “Psycho Killer,” sung to the accompaniment of a boom-box rhythm track. A throwback to the calmly deranged persona with which he entered the musical world, this signature number is followed by a series of selections from the Head&#39;s early repertoire, each one accompanied by the addition of one or two band members and the stage risers that hold their instruments, culminating in a thunderous full-band arrangement of their biggest hit, “Burning Down the House.” Byrne then unstraps his guitar, loosens the top buttons on his shirt, and launches into “Life During Wartime,” a paranoid political fantasy whose aerobics-class choreography mocks the self-importance of the song&#39;s lyrics and ends with Byrne circling the stage at a dead run, as if in orbit around the band.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;pc7jcd&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;kcm8h9&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;After the introduction of its full cast of characters, the midsection of the film begins with the sexy, lighthearted groove of “Making Flippy Floppy,” and goes on to present a series of stylized vignettes. This includes a soaring, up-lit production of “What a Day That Was,” a song from “The Catherine Wheel”; a heartfelt rendition of “This Must Be the Place,” the Heads&#39; equivalent of “Home Sweet Home,” featuring a pas de deux with a floor lamp that&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=faN0kPOQykM&quot;>;lifted from Fred Astaire&lt;/a>;; and a transcendent reprise of Byrne&#39;s music-video impersonation of a televangelist in “Once in a Lifetime,” whose rapturous synthesizer coda lifts the roof right off the song. Byrne then leaves the stage while a radiant Weymouth minces her way through the funky fantasia of “Genius of Love,” only to return for the show&#39;s finale encased in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/david-byrnes-gray-suits-from-stop-making-sense-to-american-utopia&quot;>;Big Suit&lt;/a>;, as it came to be known, a vast expanse of creamy off-white fabric, ten or more sizes too large, that turns him into a cartoonish, two-dimensional box of a character who proceeds to sing a boastful number about his supposedly hot girlfriend that includes the film&#39;s title line: “As we get older and stop making sense / You won&#39;t find her waiting long.” Having tested the limits of romantic absurdity, Byrne then wades into the metaphorical water to join Mabry and Holt on an upbeat, full-gospel version of “Take Me to the River,” in the course of which he removes his suit jacket to reveal his sixty-inch waist, shake his sixty-inch hips, and introduces the members of the band by name. Finally, with their singer restored to his original size and shape, the Heads end with the delirious Afro-funk of “Crosseyed and Painless.” “Lost my shape, trying to act casual,” it begins, as the cameras at long last turn around to offer glimpses of the audience, and then of the crew, as they join the band onstage.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;What no one could have imagined in 1984 was that “Stop Making Sense” represented not only the culmination but also the conclusion of Talking Heads&#39; nine-year career as a performing band. That same year, Byrne wrote the music for “The Knee Plays,” an experimental theatre piece by the director &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/09/17/slow-man&quot;>;Robert Wilson&lt;/a>;, and Talking Heads reverted to their original four-piece configuration to record “Little Creatures,” an album of tightly arranged, brightly melodic songs that cried out to be performed live. Yet Byrne showed no interest in touring, choosing instead to try his hand at writing, directing, and starring in a feature film, “True Stories,” which is set in a small Texas town and presents, with an uncertain degree of irony, a distinctly lower-Manhattan perspective on middle-American life. The soundtrack includes nine songs that Byrne sang with Talking Heads, but were written to be performed by the actors in the film, which made the band&#39;s seventh album something of an afterthought. Both the film and its soundtrack proved to be critical and commercial disappointments.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In the long run, Byrne&#39;s celebrity in the burgeoning New York arts scene would erode the last vestiges of camaraderie in a band whose members, now in their mid-thirties, were otherwise settling down with families of their own. Talking Heads had always been absolute darlings of the press, but Byrne&#39;s extreme shyness and eccentricity had once served to inhibit him as an interview subject. Now that the shyness was abating, he responded to the glare of media attention with a kind of unbridled delight. In 1985, to the consternation of his bandmates, the New York &lt;em>;Times Magazine&lt;/em>; focussed on Byrne alone in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/1985/05/05/magazine/the-creative-mind-david-byrne-thinking-man-s-rock-star.html&quot;>;feature story&lt;/a>; titled “David Byrne: Thinking Man&#39;s Rock Star.” &lt;em>;Time&lt;/em>; magazine followed a year later by celebrating Byrne on its cover as “Rock&#39;s Renaissance Man.” And, in 1987, when &lt;em>;Rolling Stone&lt;/em>; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/are-four-talking-heads-better-than-one-102029/&quot;>;finally got around&lt;/a>; to putting all four Talking Heads on its cover, the subhead read: “The world&#39;s smartest rock group talks about confronting the David Byrne media blitz.” The band&#39;s last album, “Naked,” was released in 1988. Recorded in Paris and New York with a cadre of African musicians and Latin American horn players, it includes some of the most enthralling and ominous music they had ever made. The popularity of the record matched those of their previous albums, but the absence of tour support or a hit single caused it to have less impact than their comparable earlier work.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Both the Beatles and the Band established the principle that great rock groups don&#39;t always end well, and Talking Heads was no exception. It was not until three years later, in December, 1991, that Byrne offhandedly told a pop columnist for the Los Angeles &lt;em>;Times&lt;/em>; that the band had “broken up, or call it whatever you like.” By that time, his furtive, noncommittal behavior regarding the future of the group had thoroughly frustrated and infuriated his bandmates. This led Weymouth, in particular, to issue a number of statements over the years that amounted to a revisionist history of the group, according to which she and her husband, Frantz, had effectively nursed Byrne out of his shell into becoming the extraordinarily distinctive singer, songwriter, and performer the world had come to know. Weymouth and Frantz&#39;s sense of grievance was amply reflected in the memoir that Frantz published in 2020, “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Remain-Love-Talking-Heads-Club/dp/1250209226&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Remain-Love-Talking-Heads-Club/dp/1250209226&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Remain-Love-Talking-Heads-Club/dp/1250209226&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;Remain in Love&lt;/a>;,” in which he rarely misses an opportunity to point out instances of Byrne&#39;s awkwardness, obtuseness, aloofness, and grandiosity.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;59cm57&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;All of this turned the announcement that the four former Heads had agreed to appear together to promote the reissue of their film into a source of both anticipation and trepidation among their devoted fans. The recent screening at the Brooklyn Academy of Music affirmed that the new 4K restoration is indeed a wonder to behold, and the soundtrack, which was exceptional to begin with, has gained a new depth and clarity that lends even greater force to the rhythmic foundation of the band. Throughout the film, there was a certain amount of dancing in the aisles, and clapping at the ends of songs. But the sheer visual power of the performances also tended to keep most people, in the best sense, on the edge of their seats, captivated by the images onscreen.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;The panel discussion that followed the film was, for the most part, an anticlimax, thanks to the fanboy ravings of the moderator, the political journalist John Heilemann, who talked more than the four Talking Heads put together. In response to Heilemann&#39;s questions, Weymouth was notably gracious in expressing what a “riveting front man” Byrne had been, Frantz was profusely grateful for the release of the film, and Harrison was philosophical about the way things worked out in the end. Byrne seemed considerably more guarded than he&#39;s been in his many public appearances of late, perhaps reverting, like a family member at a reunion, to his former self. (Byrne stopped doing press interviews with the rest of the group in 1979.) He may have been anticipating the one subject that Heilemann couldn&#39;t resist bringing up, ending a delightful evening on its one sour note by first asking, and then imploring, the four of them about the possibility that they might perform together again. Each member of the group responded by deflecting or ignoring the question. But, in a way that acknowledged the integrity and the finality of the band&#39;s remarkable legacy, Byrne had already provided a definitive answer many years ago, when he remarked, “It&#39;s like being told, &#39;You should get back with your first wife––you guys were good together.&#39; Well, I think most people would pass on an offer like that.” ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;to6mix&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 04 Oct 2023 22:06:01 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[What Your Airplane-Seat Choice Says About You]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.newyorker.com/humor/daily-shouts/what-your-airplane-seat-choice-says-about-you]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-04T10:00:00.000Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/651c19a0302e2c28dcd4c9cf/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Shouts-Harrold-Airplane-Seats.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;article >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attribute-verso-pattern=&quot;article-body&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;ArticlePageChunks&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p>;Whether you gladly fork up the extra cash to secure control of the window shade, or are just a plain psycho who doesn&#39;t mind being nestled between two complete strangers on a red-eye flight, here are some things that your airplane-seat choice says about you.&lt;/p>;&lt;div role=&quot;heading&quot; aria-level=&quot;4&quot; >;Aisle&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;You have to pee right now as you&#39;re reading this.&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;You want to be in and out of this aircraft ASAP&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Your last relationship ended because you wouldn&#39;t move in, and now, late at night, you lie awake wracked with the profound certainty that they&#39;re the one who got away.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;You have a perfect view of the TV screen of the person watching the rom-com “About Time” across the aisle, one row up, and you cannot for the life of you peel your eyes off of it, even though you can&#39;t hear any of the dialogue.

When the documentary filmmaker Billy Miossi saw Goldrainer perform at a local festival, several years ago, he was “not prepared” for what he saw. Goldrainer, or Goldie, as he is affectionately known, gave an especially energized performance, “doing the splits and kicking balloons, constantly doing costume changes.” Soon thereafter, Miossi found out that, starting in 2015, Goldrainer had taken on another kind of gig—one to which the singer brings the same commitment but plays in a very different setting. Miossi&#39;s film “Goldie” shows Goldrainer giving concerts in local nursing homes.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Miossi was taken by the idea of such a wild, exuberant performer spending time in front of much smaller, quieter audiences. He tracked Goldrainer down after the festival and learned that the singer lived in a house behind his own. “He just walked through my back yard, and he was at my front door in, like, five minutes,” the filmmaker said. Before long, Miossi attended his first Goldie show, as Goldrainer&#39;s nursing home performances are known. “When he starts, the audience is sort of unsure, like, &#39;What is he doing?&#39; He&#39;s joking with them and he really interacts,” Miossi said, but “he gets up close and sings,” and soon they&#39;re hooked.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;GenericCallout&quot;>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;external-link-embed--inline&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;a aria-label=&quot;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;The New Yorker Documentary&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-new-yorker-documentary/watch-the-new-yorker-documentary&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-new-yorker-documentary/watch-the-new-yorker-documentary&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;&lt;span >;&lt;strong>;The New Yorker Documentary&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/a>;&lt;p >;&lt;em>;View the latest or submit your own film.&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;a aria-label=&quot;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;The New Yorker Documentary&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-new-yorker-documentary/watch-the-new-yorker-documentary&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-new-yorker-documentary/watch-the-new-yorker-documentary&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5daf63ccaae3dd0008e7fd38/1:1/w_200%2Cc_limit/undefined&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5daf63ccaae3dd0008e7fd38/1:1/w_120,c_limit/undefined 120w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/a>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;In Miossi&#39;s film, Goldrainer walks into one facility where he&#39;s going to put on a Goldie show, a woman working at the front desk announces that she has a bone to pick with him, because he&#39;s made her mother, who is cared for at a different living facility, fall in love with him. It&#39;s easy to see how this might happen. Goldrainer doesn&#39;t dip into his trove of whimsical costumes for his Goldie shows—he doesn&#39;t need to. In one scene, he skips over to an elderly woman sitting in the first row who surrenders a girlish grin and begins to sing along while Goldrainer belts out Frank Sinatra&#39;s rendition of “I&#39;ve Got You Under My Skin.” He then singles out another audience member to gift her with a pink rose, after which he jokes that he&#39;s “gonna need that back.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Goldrainer admits that he never planned on performing for the elderly. “Come on, man, give me a break. I sing in a rock band—I&#39;m not ready for the seniors tour yet,” he remembers saying, when his wife suggested it as a daytime pursuit. But, when Goldrainer&#39;s mother developed dementia and had to be admitted to the nursing home at which she&#39;d worked, he&#39;d visit her frequently and started getting to know the other seniors. He&#39;d pop into their rooms to sing a song. When he saw their reactions, he recalls in the film, his “whole perspective changed.” Goldrainer decided to “go a hundred miles an hour with this,” because “why would they not deserve it?”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;While working with Goldrainer, Miossi watched in awe as some seniors would go from looking bored or uninterested to completely enchanted by Goldie&#39;s songs and stage patter. “Music is so nostalgic. It&#39;s, like, the most nostalgic thing there is,” Miossi told me. “So, if you hear Frank Sinatra, or hear Nat King Cole . 。 。 it immediately transports you, and that&#39;s got to be good for the soul.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Throughout the film, it&#39;s clear that Goldrainer is being transported to a place of exhilarating joy as much as he&#39;s providing an escape for the seniors in his Goldie audiences. “Whether it be with the Menus in front of thousands of people or a nursing home,” the way he plays music for others is ruled by a piece of advice his father once gave him: “Ten or ten thousand people, give them the same show. Give them the best show you possibly can.”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 04 Oct 2023 19:06:01 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[How Do We Survive the Constitution?]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.newyorker.com/books/under-review/how-do-we-survive-the-constitution]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-04T10:00:00.000Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/651c7cd92f185c153d5c8bd8/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Robin_Constitution_3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;article >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attribute-verso-pattern=&quot;article-body&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;ArticlePageChunks&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Donald Trump caught academics off guard. Historians and social scientists had long studied the American right, amassing a vast library on its relationship to race, gender, sex, the media, the Cold War, religion, and big and small business. Less explored was the role of the Constitution, which has always been more friend than foe to the American way of repression. This gap in the literature left the field wide open for experts in authoritarianism abroad and scholars of authoritarianism past.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The most important contribution to this genre was “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/dp/1524762946&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/dp/1524762946&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/dp/1524762946&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;How Democracies Die&lt;/a>;,” by the Harvard political scientists Steven Levitsky and Daniel Ziblatt. Studying how democracy was undermined elsewhere, Levitsky and Ziblatt defined the threat of Trumpism as an attack on the Constitution, the rule of law, and institutions. They also claimed that these pillars were less sturdy than people supposed. The Constitution was riddled with holes. Restrictions on Presidential prerogatives were not written down. Institutions designed to check extremists, whether specified in the text (a bicameral legislature) or not (political parties), were vulnerable to extremists.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Most worrisome of all, the ligaments joining these parts, what Levitsky and Ziblatt called “norms,” were frayed. Two norms in particular—tolerance of one&#39;s opponents and forbearance in the exercise of power—were foundational to constitutional democracy. But since 1965, 1994, or 2010 (Levitsky and Ziblatt never settled on a date), those norms had been eroding. Traditionally, élite “gatekeepers” had been the custodians of norms, exercising “peer review” over norm eroders such as Charles Lindbergh and George Wallace. But, in the wake of reforms initiated by the Democrats after 1968 (another date), and later copied by the Republicans, ordinary voters, rather than insider élites, were empowered to choose the Presidential ticket of each party. For a while, the establishment held the line against outsiders. Then came 2016, when Republican leaders failed to stop Trump and rallied behind him.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Within a month of its publication, in January, 2018, “How Democracies Die” &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/books/best-sellers/2018/02/04/combined-print-and-e-book-nonfiction/&quot;>;hit&lt;/a>; the &lt;em>;Times&lt;/em>; best-seller list.很容易看出原因。 The book gave voice to liberals who felt betrayed not by their country but by its voters, the gate-crashers who put Trump into power. Levitsky and Ziblatt&#39;s readers believed in norms, trusted élites, and valued institutions, particularly the Supreme Court. They revered the Constitution. The problem was the half of the country that didn&#39;t.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;But spring came, as it does, and a new wind began to blow on the left. After the confirmation of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/letter-from-trumps-washington/none-of-this-was-fair-the-kavanaugh-nomination-marks-the-triumph-of-trumpism-on-capitol-hill-susan-collins&quot;>;Brett Kavanaugh&lt;/a>;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/benjamin-wallace-wells/neil-gorsuch-makes-the-case-for-his-own-independence&quot;>;Neil Gorsuch&lt;/a>;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/02/14/amy-coney-barretts-long-game&quot;>;Amy Coney Barrett&lt;/a>;, progressives started seeing the Court less as a counter to Trumpism than as its conduit. “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtS3M_paWhI&quot;>;Defend institutions&lt;/a>;” may have made sense at the beginning of Trump&#39;s reign. By the end, it sounded like a call to protect the Electoral College and other struts of the right. In 2018, Levitsky and Ziblatt had recommended building coalitions with “red-state Republicans,” abandoning abortion as a litmus test for candidates, and making unnamed but “tough” concessions to moderate voters. Now liberals were ready to play hardball: abolish the filibuster, pack the Court, admit new states to increase Democratic votes in the Senate, and stop all coöperation with the GOP&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;None of this agenda has been enacted, but its pressures are felt throughout “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/dp/0593443071&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/dp/0593443071&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/dp/0593443071&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;Tyranny of the Minority&lt;/a>;,” Levitsky and Ziblatt&#39;s follow-up to “How Democracies Die.” There&#39;s little talk of norms in the new volume. Instead, Levitsky and Ziblatt reaffirm the call to end the filibuster and remake the Court, norm-eroding measures they previously cautioned against. More surprising is their revised view of democracy itself. The primary threat to the system is no longer demagogues; it&#39;s the very institutions that Levitsky and Ziblatt once rallied readers to protect. If the United States is to remain—really, become—a democracy, Americans must stop treating its founding text “as if it were a sacred document.” The Constitution, the deepest norm in American politics, must be eroded.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In 1857, the British historian and statesman Thomas Macaulay &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/1860/03/24/archives/macaulay-on-democracy-curious-letter-from-lord-macaulay-on-american.html&quot;>;set out&lt;/a>; a grim forecast for the United States. In Britain, political power was safely tucked away in the pockets of élites, who were “deeply interested in the security of property.” America had foolishly handed power to the “discontented” masses. For now, there was land for them to settle in the West. But, when that safety valve failed, the working classes, “none of whom has had more than half a breakfast, or expects to have more than half a dinner,” would vote to strip the minority of their wealth. The Constitution wouldn&#39;t stop them. It was “all sail and no anchor.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;For much of American history, it&#39;s been the reverse: all anchor, no sail. The most influential authors of the Constitution were terrified of democratic majorities. They devised a government with a sluice of filters—at least six, which Levitsky and Ziblatt note is “an unusually large number”—to push majorities to the side. More than two centuries later, we still have this “uniquely counter-majoritarian democracy,” which is hardly a democracy at all.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Congress has two of the filters. A bicameral legislature is one; the Senate is the other. Many countries have learned that, in a real democracy, upper chambers either don&#39;t exist or have highly limited powers. The US Senate doesn&#39;t just have power equal to (and, in some cases, greater than) the House; it also represents states rather than individuals. Wyoming, with a population of about five hundred and eighty thousand, has as many votes as California, which has nearly forty million people. There&#39;s a reason that most democracies don&#39;t operate in this way: it&#39;s undemocratic. This has been apparent for centuries. All of the antislavery bills that passed the House between 1800 and 1860 were killed by the minoritarian Senate.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;If the House and the Senate agree on a bill, they still need the approval of the President, who&#39;s elected not by the voters but by the Electoral College. That&#39;s the third filter. With a bias toward smaller states and a winner-take-all structure, the Electoral College can send the loser of the popular vote to the White House. In this century alone, that&#39;s happened twice.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Even if the elected branches agree on a bill, the Supreme Court can strike it down. Justices are put on the bench by the Senate and the President, so we can have a Supreme Court majority, like the one we have now, created by a combination of Presidents who lost the popular vote and senators who represent a minority of the voters. That&#39;s the fourth filter, a creature of the preceding three.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Meanwhile, another course runs parallel to the national one. Our federal system, the fifth filter, grants states tremendous power, including the right to design electoral rules—how district lines are drawn, who can access the ballot, how elections are conducted, and so on—that privilege minorities over majorities. Between 1968 and 2016, the party with fewer votes has won a state house a hundred and twenty-one times and a state senate a hundred and forty-six times. Those legislatures, in turn, can gerrymander federal election districts, turning the putatively majoritarian House into another counter-majoritarian chamber. They also can pass laws, such as bans on abortion, that abridge the most basic freedoms of the people.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Many nations entered the twentieth century saddled with the yoke of counter-majoritarianism. They got rid of it. We haven&#39;t, thanks to our mega-counter-majoritarian requirement for constitutional change, which is the sixth and most important filter. Two-thirds of both houses in Congress propose an amendment, and three-fourths of the states must then ratify it. According to Levitsky and Ziblatt, a political scientist has devised something called the Index of Difficulty to measure how hard it is to change a country&#39;s constitution. Ours tops the list, by a wide margin.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;This news comes at a bad time. Today&#39;s Republicans—many of them white and living in rural areas—hold fast to the Constitution for protection against Democratic majorities. Those majorities increasingly live in large cities, where the jobs are, and many of those cities are in highly populated, Democratic states. The combination of these factors leaves blue voters vulnerable to malapportionment in the states, where they needlessly pile up their votes in cities, and in the Senate and Electoral College. A minority of voters can now inflict a legislative wallop of racism, sexism, nativism, homophobia, transphobia, and economic misery on the rest of us—and never have to pay for it at the polls.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;This is the “tyranny of the minority” that Levitsky and Ziblatt rightly fear. No lawless strongman or populist autocracy, it&#39;s a product of the very Constitution that we have been taught to admire.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Once we set aside the compass of the Constitution, where should we look for our North Star? Levitsky and Ziblatt point to “multiracial democracy.” Either we become a multiracial democracy or we cease to “be a democracy at all.” The battle, in other words, is existential.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Yet Levitsky and Ziblatt aren&#39;t equipped for war. Like many analysts, they believe that today&#39;s right is driven by a primitive fear. Conservative voters fear the simple fact of demographic change. As immigrants, people of color, women, and sexual and gender minorities assume greater visibility, dominant groups—straight, white, cis, native-born men—fear a loss of status. That fear of erasure fuels the GOP&#39;s “turn to authoritarianism.” Holding on to government power is an “existential” imperative for the Party and the groups it represents.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;This argument, now ubiquitous on the left, has come to seem like a natural law of the political universe, describing our most elemental drives of identity and anxiety. It makes sense that conservatives would believe it, as they&#39;ve been pushing it since the French Revolution. But it poses a problem for the left, and for Levitsky and Ziblatt, in particular.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;njcz7f&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;wx9lut&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;If dominant groups can get members of subordinate groups to identify with them, they may not need minoritarian tyranny to stay in power. That scenario is not as far-fetched as it may sound. Until recently, that was the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674057401&quot;>;story&lt;/a>; of the American right, whose foot soldiers created large voting majorities and cultivated explicit support for big business from the ranks of its victims. Whiteness is insidiously capacious, forever incorporating new arrivals into its enveloping fold. Small &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/05/upshot/biden-trump-black-hispanic-voters.html&quot;>;shifts&lt;/a>; of nonwhite voters away from Democrats and the rise in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/11/us/politics/republicans-house-black-latino-asian.html&quot;>;number&lt;/a>; of Republican candidates of color suggest that this phenomenon remains salient, even in the age of Trump. In today&#39;s environment, where elections are won at the margin, the effects can be lethal.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;More important, if the laws of identity and anxiety are as primal and potent as many progressives believe, resisting those laws risks turning the left&#39;s project into a purely moral crusade, an exhortatory ought against the right&#39;s is. Levitsky and Ziblatt call themselves political realists, yet they often resort to an earnest moralism to explain the world. What makes politicians capitulate to authoritarians in their midst? The absence of courage. How will multiracial democracy be advanced? By “loving America with a broken heart.” “History is calling again,” and “future generations will hold us to account.” More than a lapse in style, platitudes like these, stacked one on top of the other, reveal how difficult it has been for progressives, of all stripes, to mount a political argument for democracy.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Levitsky and Ziblatt are refreshingly clear that only a popular movement can create the constitutional reforms that democracy needs. But they define democracy narrowly, as “a political system with regular, free, and fair elections in which adult citizens of all ethnic groups possess the right to vote” and “enjoy equal protection of democratic and civil rights.” Quoting the political scientist Adam Przeworski, they add that it is “a system in which parties lose elections.” Given this straitened sense of what a democracy can do, it&#39;s not clear why any contemporary movement would take on the task of creating it. It&#39;s probably no accident that, thus far, none really has.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;It wasn&#39;t always so. The United States has seen many movements for democracy. The successful ones have treated the Constitution not simply as a document of constraint, weaponized by the courts and politicians, but as a charter of expanding freedom, wielded by and for the people. As Joseph Fishkin and William Forbath detail in their wonderfully counterintuitive book, “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/dp/0674295544&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/dp/0674295544&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/dp/0674295544&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;The Anti-Oligarchy Constitution&lt;/a>;,” the very document that Levitsky and Ziblatt are so dissatisfied with is annotated with statements of astonishing democratic vision, penned by the great social movements of the past.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;From the earliest days of the Republic, those movements insisted that the greatest threat to democracy is not the tyranny of one man but the oligarchic rule of wealth. Poor citizens, at the mercy of richer ones, could not be full citizens. More than a moral or political argument, this is a foundational claim about the Constitution and the economy, or what we might call the political constitution of the economy. When we think of the Constitution today, our minds drift to civil rights or to the obstacle course described by Levitsky and Ziblatt. Historically, Fishkin and Forbath remind us, Americans have thought of the Constitution as a weapon in the struggle for economic equality, as a real presence in their material lives.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Among the most successful movements against oligarchy were the Populists and Progressives, who used the document to treat the disabling economy of &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Age-Acquiescence-American-Resistance-Organized/dp/0465097790&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Age-Acquiescence-American-Resistance-Organized/dp/0465097790&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Age-Acquiescence-American-Resistance-Organized/dp/0465097790&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;the Gilded Age&lt;/a>;. At the end of the nineteenth century, land promised to farmers in the West was gobbled up by banks, railroads, speculators, and cattle companies. Suddenly jobless, a new proletariat scuttled back East, praying for work in factories and cities. “Unemployment” appeared as a census category for the first time. Vagrants shattered store windows to get a bed for the night in jail. Meanwhile, the top one per cent owned half of the wealth.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;When the United States was an agricultural society, distribution of property seemed like the fount of equality. But, as Macaulay anticipated, industrial capitalism—with its wrenching shift to wage labor, complex production lines, and corporate behemoths—had rendered that vision moot. The Populists and Progressives realized that they needed a new conception of democracy, one tied less to physical notions of land and labor than to the social facts of economic combination and coöperation. Mass parties, labor unions, public schools, strikes and boycotts, social insurance, minimum-wage laws, state banks and currency reform, antitrust regulation, income taxes, even economic planning: these were the new priorities, the material resources of freedom. They deserved all the constitutional fervor and protection that once attached to yeoman land.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In their quest to enact these changes, the Populists and Progressives hit a familiar wall—the Senate and the courts. The Senate was “a paradise of millionaires,” one critic cried. Edgar Lee Masters, the author of “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/dp/0486272753&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/dp/0486272753&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/dp/0486272753&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;Spoon River Anthology&lt;/a>;,” wrote that “plutocracy appoints the federal judges.” After Grover Cleveland sent in the troops to crush the Pullman Strike, which was organized by thousands of railroad workers, Illinois&#39;s governor declared that “never before were the United States government and the corporations of the country so blended.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Instead of accepting oligarchy as the inevitable consequence of the Constitution, the Populists and Progressives looked for alternatives in the text. Through a close reading of James Madison&#39;s notes and papers, they uncovered an argument for the national government&#39;s design and regulation of the economy. In the commerce clause, they found a tool for Congress to “secure the Blessings of Liberty,” which later proved critical to the passage of the Wagner Act—the cornerstone of workers&#39; right to organize unions—and the Civil Rights Act. The Gold Standard, which enriched bankers and burdened farmers, was deemed a violation of the equal-protection clause. And, in a brilliant marriage of substance and strategy, the Progressives joined forces with the feminist movement, arguing that women voters would help strengthen child-labor laws, health and safety protections, and so on.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;By insisting that “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/progressive-party-platform-1912&quot;>;the people are the masters of their Constitution&lt;/a>;,” these armies plowed through Levitsky and Ziblatt&#39;s sixth filter. In rapid succession, the country adopted the Sixteenth Amendment (1913), which gave the government the power to enact an income tax; the Seventeenth Amendment (1913), which established direct election of senators; and the Nineteenth Amendment (1920), which secured for white women the right to vote. The amendments were linked. A democratically elected Senate would lead to income taxes that, by the middle of the twentieth century, were the envy of social democracies across the globe. The right to vote would empower women in the household economy, overturning what Susan B. Anthony had called the most “hateful oligarchy” of all, the “oligarchy of sex.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Fishkin and Forbath also push against the reductive identitarianism of today&#39;s defenders of democracy. Any movement of constitutional reform requires racial and gender equality, and vice versa. But the laws and norms of race and sex are part of the economy, from the distribution and rewards of labor, in the household and the workplace, to the operations of finance and the regulation of marriage and inheritance. To overcome oligarchy—and Levitsky and Ziblatt&#39;s tyranny of the minority—that political economy must be remade.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Reconstruction and the New Deal offer instructive examples. “By building up a ruling and dominant class,” the congressional Joint Committee on Reconstruction declared, slavery “produced a spirit of oligarchy averse to republican institutions.” Slaveholders had accumulated vast wealth and power, not just through enslavement but by forcing wage workers, Black and white, in the North and South, to accept harsh conditions on the ground that they weren&#39;t as bad as slavery. The slaveholders also thwarted a much-needed land-grant bill for public colleges and universities, fearing that any exercise of federal power might be turned against them.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Because the slaveholders&#39; power derived from a racial caste system, labor exploitation, and a privileged position in government, the leaders of Reconstruction vowed to destroy all three. Like the amendments of the Gilded Age, the Reconstruction amendments linked profound changes in political economy (the end of enslaved labor and an extensive expropriation of private property, in the case of the Thirteenth Amendment) to a democratization of the political process (the right to vote for Black men, in the case of the Fifteenth Amendment). The Fourteenth Amendment—which included the citizenship clause, the equal-protection clause, and the due-process clause—transformed the standing of many Americans, and each amendment gave Congress the unprecedented power to take “appropriate” action to insure its enforcement.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;5oioun&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Leaders of the New Deal followed a similar course. “A small group,” Franklin Delano Roosevelt announced in 1936, had “concentrated into their own hands an almost complete control over other people&#39;s property, other people&#39;s money, other people&#39;s labor—other people&#39;s lives.” Now the enemy was a coalition of pro-business Republicans and white-supremacist Democrats, whose power depended on stifling a multiracial social democracy. Advocates of the New Deal saw it as the continuation of Reconstruction. The Thirteenth Amendment became the rallying cry of organized labor, inspiring half a million Black workers to join the ranks of the newly formed Congress of Industrial Organizations. New Deal officials, the NAACP, labor organizers, and Communist Party activists fanned out across the South to rally Black workers and tenant farmers. Summarizing the movement&#39;s credo in 1945, the Black legal theorist Pauli Murray &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/books/edition/California_Law_Review/qUkhAQAAIAAJ?hl=en&amp;amp;gbpv=1&amp;amp;bsq=%22it+is+obvious,+however,+that+job+discrimination+based+upon+racial+or+religious+prejudice%22&amp;amp;dq=%22it+is+obvious,+however,+that+job+discrimination+based+upon+racial+or+religious+prejudice%22&amp;amp;printsec=frontcover&quot;>;wrote&lt;/a>; that the only way to end racial discrimination in the workplace was to create a full-employment economy for all. Civil rights meant social democracy.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;We&#39;ve come to think that Reconstruction and the New Deal were defeated by racism and violence in the factories, fields, and streets. But the higher reaches of reaction took a different form: severing race from class and class from race. If overthrowing oligarchy required racial equality in the economy, the oligarchs could best maintain their position by hiving off civil rights from economic issues. Beginning in the eighteen-seventies, reactionary courts and liberal politicians narrowed the meaning of the Reconstruction amendments, applying them to Black Americans only, rather than to workers as a whole. Freedom from economic domination had no friend in the Constitution; with time, neither did Black America.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In the wake of multiple defeats in the late nineteen-forties and early fifties, the New Dealers reached a different settlement. Hoping to end decades of judicial activism on behalf of big business, they agreed that economic questions would be left to Congress and the President. Meanwhile, the Court, assuming sole custody of the Constitution, would tackle racial (and, later, gender and queer) equality. That settlement came to haunt the left, as Republican Presidents appointed more and more conservative Justices.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;This is the real story of the Constitution. A document of and for the people has become, for one half of the country, a structural support, and, for the other, an imperilled instrument of the marginalized. The choice seems clear. Return it to the people or scrap the whole damn thing. ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;tf0y3d&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 04 Oct 2023 19:06:01 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Why Obama’s “Car Czar” Thinks Biden Should Stay Out of the U.A.W.

Biden was the first American President to ever appear on a picket line, a signal that the Democratic Party, under his Administration, is increasingly willing to embrace labor unions, which in the past several years have reached their highest &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.gallup.com/poll/510281/unions-strengthening.aspx&quot;>;levels of popularity&lt;/a>; in more than half a century. (The next day, former President Donald Trump also travelled to Michigan, and gave a speech castigating the Biden Administration at a non-union manufacturing shop.)&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Biden&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/inflation-is-obscuring-bidens-pro-labor-achievements&quot;>;support for unions&lt;/a>;, especially compared with other recent Presidents, has not been met with universal approval within the Democratic Party. Steve Rattner, a former economics journalist and investor who became the “car czar” in the Obama Administration, criticized the move, telling NBC News, “For [Biden] to be going to a picket line is outrageous.” I recently spoke by phone with Rattner, who is currently the chairman and CEO of Willett Advisors, LLC, which manages the personal and philanthropic assets of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tag/michael-bloomberg&quot;>;Michael Bloomberg&lt;/a>;. During our conversation, which has been edited for length and clarity, we discussed his worries about the strike, why CEO pay has grown so rapidly, and his critique of the Biden Administration.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;In a recent &lt;em>;Times&lt;/em>; op-ed, you &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/20/opinion/uaw-strike-economy-biden.html&quot;>;wrote&lt;/a>;, “I&#39;m all for the auto workers getting paid more–they have legitimate concerns.” What do you see as their legitimate concerns?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The legitimate concerns are that the auto workers in general and the workers at the Detroit Three in particular have seen declines in their after-inflation wages in recent years as a combination of relatively modest nominal wage increases combined with high inflation.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;Yes, you wrote, “When I headed President Barack Obama&#39;s auto task force in 2009, we &lt;a href=&quot;https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/realitycheck/the-press-office/fact-sheet-obama-administration-auto-restructuring-initiative-general-motors&quot;>;restructured&lt;/a>; General Motors and Chrysler (now Stellantis) and asked the UAW to make significant sacrifices, including to their generous benefits packages. The UAW agreed. Since then, the automakers have seen their fortunes rebound, yet average real wages for workers have been flat more than three decades.”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Right. Correct.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;I was curious about this because a decade ago you made comments that indicated that workers should have actually been asked to take more of a pay cut during the auto-industry bailout.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Look, these are difficult balancing acts, and the yin and the yang of this is that there&amp;#x27;s some degree of trade-off between wages and jobs. We can certainly pay the workers more, but you&#39;re going to then see more jobs going to non-unionized manufacturers in the South or to Mexico or to other parts of the world. It&#39;s a tough situation. There is a fundamental difference between the service-sector industries, which today comprise the vast, vast majority of our jobs, and manufacturing jobs or other jobs where there can be global competition. You have to think about the market for workers in what we call a tradable industry as being a global market. If wages in one place are too high, then workers in other places with more modest wages will end up getting more work and vice versa. That&#39;s very fundamentally different from something like UPS drivers or LA hotel workers or whatever. Those jobs really can&#39;t move, and so there&#39;s more leeway to pay those people more. It comes out in a bit more inflation, a bit lower profits, but that&#39;s all fine. There is not nearly the same trade-off as with manufacturing.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;A good portion, in my opinion, of the reason wages in the auto sector in general and in manufacturing in particular have been flat to declining on a real basis for a while now is because of this phenomenon of global competition. The only way US companies in many cases have been competitive is by holding down wages. It&#39;s a very different picture if you look at what&#39;s happened to wages in the manufacturing sectors versus wages in the service sector.&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;Right, in 2011, you told the Detroit Economic Club, essentially, “We should have asked the UAW to do more. We did not ask any UAW members to take a cut in their pay.” Now you&#39;re saying, given that their wages have been declining in real terms for three decades, that in fact they do have some grievance about how much they&#39;ve been making?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;They have very legitimate grievances about what&#39;s happened to their after-inflation wages. Unfortunately, it is not completely within the power of the companies to solve those problems, for the competitive reasons that I discussed. We did not ask the workers to take a cut in their actual cash pay, but by holding their wage increases down, in effect, they took a pay cut because of inflation.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;You say in the &lt;em>;Times&lt;/em>; op-ed that wages are not a huge part of the budgets of these companies. I think that wages are actually under five per cent of total expenses, right?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;It depends how you count because there are wages that are incurred by their suppliers and other parts of their supply chain and so forth. It is absolutely a relatively small number, but I think it&#39;s hard to pin it down precisely. Their profit margins are also quite thin. And again, sure, could they afford to pay these workers more and not go bankrupt? Yeah, they could afford to pay them more and not go bankrupt. But there are two issues, one that I&#39;ve already discussed, which is the fact that these jobs will move, and the other is that at some point, if you cut into the profits of these companies enough, they won&#39;t have the capital or see the rate of return they need to invest in EVs and other products of the future, and then they&#39;re going to be right back where they were, potentially, in 2008.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;At the end of your piece, you write, “The UAW and its allies also argue with considerable justification that the gap between workers&#39; pay and that of senior executives has widened to appalling levels. That, however, has much to do with exploding top level compensation (a phenomenon that has occurred, of course, across virtually all corporate America). From &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/1978/04/15/archives/gm-ford-chiefs-get-modest-raises-gm-and-ford-chiefs-get-modest.html&quot;>;$975,000 in 1978&lt;/a>;, roughly 60 times the auto industry&#39;s average pay at the time, the compensation package of the chief executive officer of General Motors rose to $29 million last year, more than 400 times the average autoworker&#39;s annual pay.” Just because it&#39;s happened in all kinds of industries across corporate America is not really an answer to a striking worker who&#39;s making less than they think they should, right? Or do you see it differently?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Well, one of the very justifiable grievances that workers in many companies and many industries have is how big the differential has gotten between pay in the so-called C-suites and pay at the factory-shop level. And I get that. That problem can arise for two reasons. One potential reason is because workers are paid too little, and the other is because CEOs are paid too much. All I&#39;m trying to point out is that CEO pay, generally speaking across corporate America, has gone up at an astronomical rate for several decades now, and that is why you see these enormous disparities.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;Do you think it&#39;s a sign that workers aren&#39;t paid enough or that CEOs are paid too much, or both?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;zuqmn5&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;bf7o8l&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;I think it is mostly a problem at the CEO level because if you look across different companies and different industries where workers have done better than they&#39;ve been able to do in the auto industry for the reasons we just talked about, you&#39;ll see the same widening of the gap. It&#39;s occurred all across corporate America, and it&#39;s occurred principally because CEO pay has gone up so fast. The rate of increase has been exceptionally rapid.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;How do we as a society address that, do you think?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;This may get off the topic of today&#39;s conversation.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;I&#39;m just curious.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I think we have a corporate-governance problem in America. There are too many cases where boards of directors, even if they are much better than they used to be in terms of independence, in terms of the quality of their work, in terms of attentiveness, are still far from perfect, and you still have too many compensation committees that are not willing to be sufficiently rigorous with their C-suite folks. It&#39;s like that game of leapfrog where some CEO goes to the comp committee and says, “Well, I&#39;m getting paid less than all these other guys, so I should get paid what they get paid.” And so he or she gets a pay increase, and then somebody else goes to their comp committee and says, “Well, I&#39;m now getting paid less than those guys, so I should get paid more.” It&amp;#x27;s kind of a phony act of benchmarking that goes on to set executive pay these days.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;No other country in the world that I&#39;m aware of pays its CEOs the way we do. And, in fact, there are examples of companies moving their headquarters or their country of incorporation from Europe to here because European CEOs get paid a fraction of what USCEOs get paid, often for doing the same job. You&#39;d be hard-pressed to find many twenty-six-million-dollar pay packages among CEOs in European companies.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;Going back to your op-ed argument, you say, about the workers, “The problem is that in their zeal, they are asking for too much.” Can you explain what you think they&#39;re asking for that&#39;s too much and why you think it&#39;s problematic?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Yeah. Look, on the core issue of pay, the gap has been narrowing in the course of these negotiations. We&amp;#x27;re talking about a four-year contract. The last number I saw from the companies was something like twenty per cent. The unions had started out at forty per cent, then went to thirty-five per cent. I think I saw something that suggests that they might now be at thirty per cent. That should be a solvable gap. That&#39;s just splitting differences until you get to a place that both sides can accept. And I think a lot of these asks are aspirational rather than what they really expect to get. Where the asks get very hard to see is around the idea of forty hours of pay for thirty-two hours of work. Another way that they describe this is a personal day off per week for every worker.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Going back to defined-benefit pension plans is a wonderful idea. But that&#39;s just not where reality is today. There&#39;s no company I know of that&#39;s instituting a new defined-benefit pension plan. [&lt;em>;Defined-benefit pension plans stipulate precisely how much a worker will make in retirement. The UAW agreed to eliminate those plans, and retiree health care, as part of the auto-industry bailout during the 2007-08 financial crisis.&lt;/em>;] There were limitations put on retiree health care around 2008 or 2009, when the auto companies changed their benefits plan. What we did was to come up with a funding plan that the companies could handle. I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any real scope to go back to unlimited retiree health care. It sounds like a joke but I was told, as a matter of fact, in 2009, that General Motors was the largest buyer of Viagra in the world. I&#39;m not sure these companies need to be providing unlimited supplies of Viagra for every retiree.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;Presumably in a bargaining session both sides are going to have their first ask whittled down in the course of negotiations. It doesn&#39;t necessarily suggest anything bad on the part of the union to ask for more than it may end up with, right?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;No, there&#39;s absolutely nothing wrong with asking, but usually in a good negotiation, a couple of things happen. First, it&#39;s traditional in this industry that these negotiations happen in private, not in the press. And having them happen in the press, which you might enjoy, makes it always tougher to reach a resolution because one side or the other has to climb down from positions that they&#39;ve in effect taken publicly.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I&#39;ve done deals for forty years and whether it&#39;s a corporate deal or a labor negotiation, deals are deals. And yes, both sides will always come to the table, either offering less than they expect to have to give or asking for more than they expect to get. But what the UAW came in with this time is really just so far from the middle of the fairway that it probably is not fully productive for them to have done it and made it so public, too.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;You write, “I know the automakers won&#39;t give all of this. Because they can&#39;t.” It seems to me that almost any argument for a strike has some merit to it in any company where the top executive pay is so high.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;h9n9cc&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Yes and no. The gap is way too wide, as I hope I&#39;ve made very clear. But there are two ways to close the gap, and there is a problem with closing the gap the way I think you&#39;re suggesting we might close the gap. You could take all the dollars that get paid to the senior executives at any of these companies and add them up, and they&#39;re going to come to a relatively small number of millions of dollars compared to what the workers need. So, you can cut the CEO pay in half, you can cut it by seventy-five per cent. It&#39;s not going to create enough dollars to meaningfully improve what you can offer the workers. Now, I&#39;m in favor of cutting the CEO pay, but let&#39;s not kid ourselves that that&#39;s going to release some pot of money that can then provide thirty- or forty-per-cent wage increases.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;No, no, of course not. I meant that, as a starting point, it&#39;s not hard to understand why workers are upset and feel like they could be making more.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I totally get why the workers are upset in both respects. I get why they&#39;re upset in an absolute sense, in that their purchasing power has been declining, and I get why they&#39;re unhappy in a relative sense, in that the gap in pay from top to bottom has gotten obscenely wide. I get both of those things, but in these worldwide industries with flexible labor, I don&#39;t have a great solution other than, shit, what we called during the auto bailout “shared sacrifice.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;Recently, you said “For [Biden] to go to a picket line is outrageous. There&#39;s no precedent for it. The tradition of the President is to stay neutral in these things. I get the politics. The progressives all said, &#39;We don&#39;t want a mediator; we want an advocate.&#39; And he bowed to the progressives, and how he&#39;s going out there to put his thumb on the scale. And it&#39;s wrong.” Can you talk a little bit more why you thought this was a mistake?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Well, first, let&#39;s talk about tradition. Traditionally, the government stays out of these private-sector negotiations, except in cases where it can be an actual mediator. And the recent history here is that the President was going to send two of his top aides to help facilitate or mediate or whatever you want to call it. And there were, as I understand it, objections from the union that they should not come out as mediators; they should come out as advocates. And so then the President decided to come. I suspect he decided to come in part because Donald Trump went, as you know, although not on behalf of the UAW specifically. He wasn&#39;t even at a union plant. Nonetheless, the political pressure on the President—which I&#39;m sympathetic to, and I&#39;m a supporter of Biden—was enormous. But I don&#39;t think this is constructive. It just simply will take a group of folks who are already pretty exercised for all the reasons we just were talking about and get them more exercised and probably impede rather than facilitate a solution.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;Or it could help them get to the solution they want, right?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;We don&#39;t know, but you can&#39;t get blood from a stone, and there&#39;s only so much blood in the stone of the auto companies. There&#39;s just so much they can do. And beyond that, as you can see, look, they&#39;re taking a strike. It&#39;s not good for the companies, either, but they didn&#39;t feel they had a choice.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;You said there was no precedent for it. There clearly is no precedent for a President joining a picket line, but there is a precedent for a President weighing in on a labor dispute. Biden signed a bill to block a strike by railroad workers earlier in his Presidency. That was weighing in in a way that a lot of union people did not like. So it does seem like there&#39;s precedent for a President not to stay neutral. It&#39;s just a different side.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Look, there are many precedents for the government stepping in on strikes that are deemed to be antithetical to the national interests, whether it&#39;s railroads or teachers. I&#39;m trying to think of another example.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-cost-of-defying-the-president&quot;>;Air-traffic controllers&lt;/a>;.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;There are many precedents, and indeed, it&#39;s entirely appropriate for the government to have set policies on labor relations. We have a National Labor Relations Board that sets policies on labor relations, and that board is appointed by the President. I have no problem with any of that. It&#39;s getting involved in a strike of this sort that does not bring into play any national security or broader national interests that I don&#39;t know the precedent for.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;Do you think it would&#39;ve been OK for Biden to weigh in on the other side? I mean, would it be OK for Biden to say, “I&#39;m actually worried about the strike causing damage to the economy, and workers need to make sure that they don&#39;t do something that drives the economy into a ditch”?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I don&#39;t see why a President should be getting involved in labor actions of companies that, as I just discussed, are not central to the function of the economy. If you look back at what President Barack Obama was saying in 2009, in his various speeches on the subject, he always talked about shared sacrifice, about everybody giving up something in order to keep these companies alive. He didn&#39;t put his thumb on the scale one way or another. He just told us to go do what was right for the industry, and that&#39;s what we did. ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;xt7mkd&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 04 Oct 2023 05:06:01 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[The F.T.C.

In 2017, while she was still a student at Yale Law School, she published a &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.yalelawjournal.org/note/amazons-antitrust-paradox&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.yalelawjournal.org/note/amazons-antitrust-paradox&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.yalelawjournal.org/note/amazons-antitrust-paradox&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;paper&lt;/a>; titled “Amazon&#39;s Antitrust Paradox,” which argued that the accepted paradigm for analyzing antitrust violations was outdated. In the nineteen-seventies, American antitrust enforcement increasingly prioritized the so-called “consumer welfare” standard, which centered on the idea that consumer prices were the most important factor in judging whether a firm was engaged in anticompetitive behavior.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Khan&#39;s argument against the dominance of the consumer-welfare standard rested on an analysis of the business practices of Amazon—which she called “the titan of twenty-first century commerce,” and which now, according to some estimates, controls about half of the US&#39;s online-shopping market. Despite the fact that Amazon offered low prices, she wrote, its dominance was still detrimental to the economy. Amazon would sell products near or below cost in order to gain market share, making it more difficult for smaller businesses to compete, thereby reducing choices for consumers. In the era of the Internet, a framework that analyzed the benefits to consumers primarily through the metric of cost was no longer realistic, because, among other reasons, companies could use huge amounts of data to fine-tune what they charged particular shoppers for particular items. Even if the cost of goods wasn&#39;t immediately going up, she wrote, companies like Amazon posed longer-term threats that needed to be taken seriously.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In 2021, Khan took up the post of chair of the FTC, and since then observers have anticipated a case that the agency would bring against Amazon under her leadership. Last Tuesday, it finally did. The case, which was filed in conjunction with seventeen states, accuses the company of using its monopoly position in online retail to suppress competition.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The case makes various requests of the court, including preventing Amazon from engaging in particular practices and seeking “structural relief”—legal jargon for requiring the company to make structural changes to its business, including selling off parts of it. It also echoes some of the arguments that Khan made in another influential &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://columbialawreview.org/content/the-separation-of-platforms-and-commerce/&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://columbialawreview.org/content/the-separation-of-platforms-and-commerce/&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://columbialawreview.org/content/the-separation-of-platforms-and-commerce/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;paper&lt;/a>;, published in the &lt;em>;Columbia Law Review&lt;/em>; in 2019, titled “The Separation of Platforms and Commerce.” There, Khan focussed on the economic threats posed by tech companies&#39; spread into multiple lines of business. By operating platforms that were ostensibly marketplaces while also offering their own goods and services on those marketplaces, she wrote, companies such as Alphabet (which EU antitrust officials fined in 2017 for favoring its own services over its competitors&#39; in Google&#39;s search results, a ruling the company disputed but ultimately lost) and Apple (which EU officials have accused of disadvantaging music-streaming apps like Spotify in its app store, in order to promote Apple Music, charges that Apple says are without merit), could use the power that they already had to give themselves an unfair edge in new markets. These companies effectively placed themselves “in direct competition with some of the businesses that depend on them, creating a conflict of interest that platforms can exploit to further entrench their dominance, thwart competition, and stifle innovation.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In the FTC&#39;s almost two-hundred-page-long &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ftc.gov/legal-library/browse/cases-proceedings/amazoncom-inc&quot;>;complaint&lt;/a>;, the agency raises alarms about two particular aspects of Amazon&#39;s business practices related to this sort of consolidation. First, it accuses the company of preventing sellers from offering lower prices on other retail sites by burying their products if it catches them doing so. Until 2019, Amazon required sellers to sign contracts promising that they would not offer cheaper deals elsewhere; although no longer a formal policy, the regulators allege that the company has continued to enact this requirement through indirect means, with the result of artificially raising prices and preventing other retail sites from growing their market share. Secondly, Amazon coerces sellers who want to list their products under Amazon&#39;s free-shipping program, Amazon Prime—the subscribers of which constitute a market of some two hundred million shoppers—into using Amazon&#39;s own fulfillment service. This, the government alleges, allows Amazon to unfairly advantage its own warehousing and shipping services because, in order to fully access Amazon&#39;s enormous base of potential consumers, sellers can&#39;t choose a different option. The FTC also argues that this prevents other delivery-fulfillment-service companies from growing, because Amazon has locked up a large proportion of the sellers that they would need to develop a robust customer base. As one seller cited in the lawsuit put it, “we have nowhere else to go and Amazon knows it.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Amazon quickly refuted the government&#39;s charges, releasing a &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/company-news/amazon-response-to-ftc-antitrust-lawsuit&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/company-news/amazon-response-to-ftc-antitrust-lawsuit&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/company-news/amazon-response-to-ftc-antitrust-lawsuit&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;statement&lt;/a>; on the day that the case was filed, in which its general counsel, David Zapolsky, painted a dire picture of a government win. “If the FTC gets its way, the result would be fewer products to choose from, higher prices, slower deliveries for consumers, and reduced options for small businesses,” he wrote, calling the lawsuit “wrong on the facts and the law.” At the moment, Amazon is contesting that the FTC&#39;s account of the details of its business are accurate. The case might ultimately be settled, but, if it reaches a trial, which could take several years if it follows the pace of similar cases, the government&#39;s success could depend, among other things, on how much it can persuade the court to recognize the deficiencies of the prevailing antitrust framework.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Amazon is the third major tech company to face monopolization accusations by the government in the past three years—many also think its case will be the hardest for the government to successfully argue. In 2021, the FTC filed an amended complaint against Meta (then known as Facebook), after an earlier one had been dismissed for failing to make a strong enough argument that Facebook had become a monopoly. The revised case alleges, in greater detail, that the company bought competitors to eliminate threats to its business, and is proceeding toward a trial. (Meta has said that its purchases of WhatsApp and Instagram were ultimately good for competition, and made those companies “into what they are today.”) Google is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-real-stakes-of-the-google-antitrust-trial&quot;>;currently defending itself&lt;/a>; against charges filed by the Justice Department, which accused it of making anticompetitive deals in order to remain the world&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/infinite-scroll/what-google-search-isnt-showing-you&quot;>;dominant search engine&lt;/a>;.

Although this campaign has many supporters, it also carries political risks—especially when targeting Amazon. A Harvard poll conducted in 2021 found that Americans viewed Amazon more favorably than any of the other seventeen institutions that the survey asked about, except the US military. Battling Big Tech has the potential to alienate voters who see Amazon as a source of not just life-changing convenience but also jobs, and who may not be preoccupied by the more complex effects it has on the economy.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Rebecca Haw Allensworth, a professor at Vanderbilt Law School, told me that, like Google, Amazon is likely to base its defense on the argument that its decisions have legitimate business justifications, and that its size simply results from its customers&#39; satisfaction. “Amazon&#39;s going to say, &#39;These practices give the lowest prices to our consumers,&#39; ” Allensworth told me. The FTC&#39;s claim that Amazon&#39;s requirement that sellers listed under Prime also use its fulfillment services would be particularly difficult to spin as anticompetitive, she went on, because antitrust laws give businesses deference to decide how to make, produce, and deliver their products. “They&#39;ll say, &#39;We have to be able to stand by it and say it&#39;s going to be delivered on time.&#39; And that&#39;s a powerful story.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;George Hay, who is a professor of law and economics at Cornell and a former Justice Department antitrust official, noted that “Amazon has had years—at least since Lina Khan came to the FTC—to think about this lawsuit and how they&#39;re going to defend against it.” He also emphasized that litigation drains resources; in legal battles, companies like Amazon, with large budgets, have myriad advantages. “I have the greatest respect for the government lawyers, but they are at an operating disadvantage, and that&#39;s going to show,” he said. “Amazon&#39;s going to have two dozen people scrutinizing the government&#39;s witnesses. The government can&#39;t do that.” ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;nte29f&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;3s4hhk&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 04 Oct 2023 05:06:01 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
