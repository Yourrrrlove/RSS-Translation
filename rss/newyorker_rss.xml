说，“但是当你自己在法庭上面临可能的判决时，真相最终会大白。”梅耶尔加入《纽约客》特约撰稿人 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/contributors/susan-b-glasser&quot;>;Susan B.

data-event-click=&quot;{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://thebatesstudent.com/24771/news/a-conversation- with-lewiston-mayor-carl-sheline/&amp;quot;}&quot;

作为他们一年级迎新表格的一部分。）&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“昨晚，我正准备走出教学楼，感觉警报没什么大不了的，这时美国学生拦住了我并告诉我呆在室内。我意识到在这种情况下我所受的教育和训练是多么不足。作为一名国际学生，我从未被教导过正确的反应，即逃跑、躲藏和战斗。直到昨晚我才知道这一点。当我看到美国同龄人的反应以及我的反应时，这种反差让我大吃一惊。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“决定去美国上大学后，中国人会对我说，‘你为什么冒着生命危险去这个国家？美国在中国媒体的印象中是一个疯狂的地方，每天都有大规模枪击事件，政府几乎没有控制和干预。我总是告诉人们‘不，这只是一种刻板印象和误解，你知道吗？我很好。我的生命没有危险。我们很安全。别再担心我了。别担心我去一个看起来不安全的国家，因为根据个人经验，那里是安全的。”但现在，我不太确定了。” ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot;

data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;10 月 7 日上午，如哈马斯武装分子滑翔伞越过以色列的铁丝网进行大规模杀戮，亚哈夫·温纳 (Yahav Winner) 醒来时发现自己刚出生的女儿沙亚 (Shaya) 在家中，那是一个田园诗般的沙漠社区，那里有向日葵田和成排的棕榈树。温纳和他的妻子谢莉·阿塔里 (Shaylee Atary) 都是电影制片人，他们在温纳长大的卡法阿扎基布兹 (Kfar Aza kibbutz) 组建了自己的家庭，这是一个约有 700 名居民的村庄，距离以色列和加沙边境仅几公里。她描述说，那天早上，七十名&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/israels-calamity-and-after&quot;>;哈马斯武装分子&lt;/a>;包围了温纳和阿塔里的家。当一名哈马斯战士的手臂冲破他们卧室的窗户时，温纳似乎意识到整个家庭都无法生存。他击退了入侵者，并向他的妻子做出了手势，要求他逃跑。阿塔里左腿有残疾，她抱着熟睡的女儿一瘸一拐地走出门。外面的庭院里，武装分子正在挨家挨户地走动——阿塔里可以通过消音器听到低沉的枪声。她在花园的棚屋里找到了避难所，并躲在空盆和表土中。大约一个小时后，她熟睡的婴儿醒来并开始哭泣。吮吸 Atary 的小指并不能让婴儿安静下来。于是阿塔里又跑了，尝试了每一栋房子，直到她和沙雅在一些家人朋友的安全房间里找到了避难所。二十七小时后，当他们出现时，阿塔里发现村庄已成废墟，而她的丈夫却失踪了。她希望他是哈马斯在加沙劫持的两百多名人质之一。她在接受电视直播采访时发现他实际上已经被杀了。 “我觉得，他献出了自己的生命来爱我，”阿塔里告诉我。 “我会终生想念他。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;以巴冲突的暴力在温纳的一生中留下了深刻的烙印。 2008年，在上一轮战斗中，当时温纳二十多岁，当时他正在花园里和他最好朋友的父亲干活，一枚哈马斯发射的火箭弹落地，将另一个人炸成了碎片。阿塔里说，这段经历塑造了温纳的生活：“他的灵魂崩溃了，”我们交谈时，阿塔里告诉我。 “他的创伤从那里开始。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;创伤成为他工作的重点。它是温纳最后一部电影《男孩》的中心内容，这是一部令人难以忘怀的美丽短片，捕捉了以色列-加沙边境生活的不和谐。影片的主角巴拉克是卡法阿扎的一名年轻人，他无法忽视巴勒斯坦邻居的现实生活。当他的父亲阿维诺姆（Avinoam）在田里干活时，巴拉克则专注于远处加沙枪击事件的回声。当他全神贯注地观看最新一轮暴力事件的新闻时，他冷漠的哥哥缠着他把频道换成真人秀：“《忍者》开播了，我不想看你的废话。”巴拉克对周围的悲惨背景有着清醒的认识。这种清晰度会带来损失；我们看到他感到焦虑，有时与家人发生冲突。巴拉克提供了一个认识他人人性的令人心酸的例子。 “主角非常心碎，因为他知道栅栏另一边的人们和他一样，”阿塔里在谈到她丈夫的电影时说道。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;阿塔里和温纳在十三年前相识，因为特拉维夫的创意合作者，两人都是当地紧密结合的艺术界的一部分。 Much like his character, Winner struggled with PTSD And, yet, friends describe him as open, generous, and funny—“a true sweetheart,” as one old colleague put it. The couple decided to start a family together. Kfar Aza, with its communal living, old-fashioned atmosphere, and beautiful natural surroundings, offered an oasis—even with the occasional rocket fire. “Our doors are always open,” Atary said. “This is how much we felt community.” They hoped the stories they created together there could make the political situation a little better.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Israel&#39;s filmmakers have long been a moral conscience for the country. Films like “The Gatekeepers” and “5 Broken Cameras” exposed global audiences to the harsh reality that Palestinians face under occupation, and many such films were supported by a state ministry, in what some considered to be a sign of the country&#39;s democratic strength. Under the now entrenched power of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/netanyahus-government-takes-a-turn-toward-theocracy&quot;>;Netanyahu&#39;s right-wing Likud government&lt;/a>;, however, public funds for projects deemed to be pro-Palestinian have been harder to find, and many directors have gravitated toward more apolitical themes.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In “The Boy,” Winner offers a commentary on life along that Israel-Gaza border that&#39;s subtle but unflinching. Halfway through the film, an alarm roars, “RED ALERT,” to warn of an incoming rocket from Gaza. The kibbutz residents, familiar with this aspect of life on the border, rush to the nearest bomb shelter. Barak stays put in the cafeteria. He is grappling with an idea that his fellow community members would rather ignore: as long as the two million residents of nearby Gaza aren&#39;t able to live in safety, too, then life can come crashing down with one errant rocket.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Samuel Maoz, one of Israel&#39;s most celebrated directors, was a mentor of Winner, and his yellow-glazed films, like “Lebanon,” clearly inspired the younger director&#39;s work. I spoke to Maoz after he returned home from Winner&#39;s funeral, which was delayed by a week because of the many bodies that had to be identified and buried. Maoz shuffled through their old texts on WhatsApp and noticed that his last message checking in on Winner was never received. “I guess he was already dead,” Maoz said with a sigh. Winner had gone to Maoz for guidance early in the development of “The Boy,” but the elder director said that he had learned from Winner, too. “Working with [Yahav] made me a better director,” said Maoz, who has won top prizes at some of the world&#39;s major film festivals. “All that remains now is his direct, honest, naïve, and bare look—floating in the air.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Some traces do remain. When he died, Winner was in production on his début feature film, this one starring himself and his wife, and set in his beloved Kfar Aza. Half of the film&#39;s subjects are now dead. In one scene, Winner kisses his then pregnant wife, as she lies on their bed and ponders their life ahead as a family. “She&#39;s grown,” Winner says, stroking Atary&#39;s belly. In that same room several months later, Winner would fight to save their lives.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“I hope I will see the light,” Atary said, reflecting on their decade creating art together. “We always, always in life try to look for the little light.”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 27 Oct 2023 21:06:01 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Some Lasting Lessons from a Dramatic Week at Trump’s Civil Trial]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/some-lasting-lessons-from-a-dramatic-week-at-trumps-civil-trial]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-27T10:00:00.000Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653ad760150b105565237111/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/cassidy-trump%20and%20cohen.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;article >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attribute-verso-pattern=&quot;article-body&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;ArticlePageChunks&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;On Thursday morning, a day after being fined ten thousand dollars for violating a gag order at his New York civil trial, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tag/donald-trump&quot;>;Donald Trump&lt;/a>; was back home in Florida doing precisely what got him sanctioned in the first place: ranting away on social media. He stated that the judge who fined him, Arthur F. Engoron, “HAS GONE CRAZY IN HIS HATRED OF &#39;TRUMP.&#39; ” And he gloated about his lawyers tripping up his nemesis Michael Cohen on the witness stand, commenting, “It was like watching the end of the best Petty Mason episode, where the defendant breaks down and cries, &#39;Yes, I did it, I did it, I did it.&#39; ”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The actual defendants in the case are Trump, two of his sons, and a pair of former senior executives in the Trump Organization. In a pretrial judgment late last month, Engoron decided the key issue in the case, ruling that the defendants committed fraud by inflating the value of Trump&#39;s properties on financial-disclosure forms that they submitted to banks and other institutions. The trial, now nearing the end of its fourth week, is proceeding on additional counts and possible penalties, for which Letitia James, the New York attorney general, is seeking a fine of up to two hundred and fifty million dollars and a lifetime ban on Trump serving as an officer or director of any business in New York. Wednesday&#39;s proceedings, which featured a punishing cross-examination of Cohen by Trump&#39;s lawyers, made for the most dramatic day of the trial so far. With the former President also facing much more consequential criminal trials,, it also conveyed three larger lessons for the months ahead.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The most important one is that Trump is utterly incorrigible. As his other cases proceed, he will most certainly continue to treat the courts, and the entire legal process, with disdain and contempt until—and unless—someone imposes a sanction on him that is a lot stiffer than fines of five thousand or ten thousand dollars.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Last week, Engoron issued Trump a five-thousand-dollar fine for failing to remove a social-media post that showed a picture of one of Engoron&#39;s law clerks with Chuck Schumer and claimed that she was the “girlfriend” of the Senate Minority Leader. The post violated a previous order from Engoron not to post or speak publicly about the clerk, who sits alongside him on the bench, or other court staff. (Engoron himself remains fair game—just not the people who work for him.) Apparently oblivious to the prior fine as he stood outside the courtroom on Wednesday, Trump stopped at the crowded media pen and described Engoron as “a very partisan judge, with a person who&#39;s very partisan sitting alongside of him, perhaps even much more partisan than he is”—presumably referring to the law clerk again.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Engoron addressed Trump&#39;s statement as soon as he got to the bench. Noting the “overheated environment” in which the proceeding was taking place, he said, “I don&#39;t want anyone killed.” He also asked Trump&#39;s lawyers why he shouldn&#39;t impose “severe sanctions for this blatant, dangerous disavowal of a court order.” Trump&#39;s lead attorney, Chris Kise, insisted, with a straight face, that Trump had been referring to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tag/michael-cohen&quot;>;Michael Cohen&lt;/a>;, a testifying witness that day, rather than the law clerk. Engoron pointed out that Cohen, unlike the clerk, wasn&#39;t sitting directly alongside him, but he said that he&#39;d take the matter under advisement.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;After a lunch break, Engoron raised the issue again and called Trump himself to the witness stand. After the former President was sworn in, the judge asked him whom he had been referring to in his statement. “You and Cohen,” Trump replied. Engoron wasn&#39;t buying it. After a bit more back-and-forth about the previous social-media post, he dismissed Trump, who walked quietly back to the defense table. Engoran then said, “The witness is not credible,” and imposed a ten-thousand-dollar fine, to be paid within thirty days. At least for now, that was that. Trump may not be nearly as rich as he claims, but he can surely afford ten grand (or his campaign donors can).&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;The second lesson of the day is specifically for prosecutors: don&#39;t put very much faith in Michael Cohen. On Tuesday, Cohen told the court about how Trump would “direct” him and Allen Weisselberg, the former chief financial officer of the Trump Organization, to rework valuations on a Trump net-worth statement until they reached an arbitrary level that Trump had decided on—say, six billion dollars. After Cohen and Weisselberg had carried out this task, they would return to Trump, “demonstrating that we achieved—or close to—the number he was seeking,” Cohen testified.&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;On Wednesday, under aggressive questioning from two Trump lawyers, Alina Habba and Cliff Robert, Cohen appeared to wilt. Habba, after taking the former fixer through some of the glowing things he told the media about Trump before 2018—“He&#39;s going to be an amazing President,” “The family is fantastic”—got him to say that he had significant animosity toward Trump, that he had “made a career” out of criticizing him, and that he had lied under oath in congressional testimony in February, 2019, when he said that Trump didn&#39;t order him to inflate the value of his assets. After Roberts took over from Habba, Cohen confirmed that he lied on another occasion: to a federal judge, in his December, 2018, sentencing hearing. Then he disavowed his statement to Habba that he had lied in his congressional testimony. “So Mr. Trump never asked you to inflate the numbers on his financial l statement,” Robert said. “Correct,” Cohen replied, as Trump and Habba threw up their arms.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Under redirection from Colleen Faherty, a lawyer for the New York attorney general&#39;s office, Cohen sought to resolve his clashing statements. Trump “did not specifically state, &#39;Michael, go inflate the numbers,&#39; ” Cohen said. “Donald Trump speaks like a Mob boss, and what he does is he tells you what he wants without specifically telling you. So when he said to me, &#39;I&#39;m worth more than five million. I&#39;m actually worth maybe six, maybe seven, could be eight,&#39; we understood what he wanted.” This was a perfectly reasonable explanation, and it jibes with everything we know about Trump, who also avoids sending incriminating e-mails and written notes. But it&#39;s never good for a prosecution when one of its witnesses appears to flip-flop or says that he lied to another judge. After Wednesday&#39;s session, James evidently felt a bit of cleanup was necessary. Speaking to reporters outside the courthouse, she said that it was “important to know that Michael Cohen is not the main witness.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The final lesson from the Trump-Cohen showdown is one that has been clear from the start of this proceeding, and from Trump&#39;s pretrial comments in his other cases. As he confronts his accusers, Trump&#39;s legal tactics are secondary to his political strategy of discrediting the court and the prosecution in the eyes of his supporters. Only he knows his ultimate goals. But they seem to include raising doubts in advance about any guilty verdicts and planting the idea that such verdicts would be so outrageous that they would lead to unrest and violence. Almost certainly, he&#39;s also trying to prepare the ground for a self-pardon in the event of a conviction on the federal charges against him if he gets reëlected.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;As he pursues these ends, Trump&#39;s court appearances are primarily media events, where he delivers his message to Trump-supporting platforms that amplify it and whip up the &lt;em >;MAGA&lt;/em>; faithful. This couldn&#39;t have been clearer when, after blithely defying Engoron&#39;s gag order, he rose from his seat and walked out of the courtroom after Engoron rejected a request from his lawyers to dismiss the case because of Cohen&#39;s testimony. With Trump absent, Engoron explained that there was “no way, no how” he was going to issue such a ruling because of an “arguably equivocal statement” from a single witness that he didn&#39;t consider key. “There&#39;s enough evidence to fill this courtroom,” Engoron said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Of course, the judge&#39;s statement didn&#39;t get nearly as much publicity as Trump “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2023/10/25/trump-courtroom-new-york-trial-cohen-vpx.cnn&quot;>;storming out of court&lt;/a>;,” which is how many media outlets described Trump&#39;s abrupt exit from the courtroom. Directly outside, he stopped to tell the media pen, falsely, that Cohen had “admitted that we won the trial.” It was a carefully staged bit of theatre, but the ex-President storming out of his own trial is a better story. ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;gopcj9&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;5q2ng9&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 27 Oct 2023 19:06:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Marie NDiaye’s Drama of Exclusion and Revenge]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.newyorker.com/books/under-review/marie-ndiayes-drama-of-exclusion-and-revenge]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-27T10:00:00.000Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6536d19991891e12fe97d418/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Wilson-Vengeance-Is_mine.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;article >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attribute-verso-pattern=&quot;article-body&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;ArticlePageChunks&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;On January 5, 2019, a group of people began breaking down the front door of a ministry building on the Rue de Grenelle in central Paris. Security rushed the government spokesperson at the time, Benjamin Griveaux, out through a side exit soon after the intruders took apart the wooden entrance using a commandeered forklift. Their use of heavy machinery had a touch of symbolism. Among the perpetrators were members of France&#39;s &lt;em>;gilets jaunes&lt;/em>; (“yellow vest”) movement, named for the high-visibility vests typically worn by construction workers. Demonstrators had donned the reflective neon garments in a show of working-class pride. January 5th had marked the eighth week of protests against &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/07/01/can-emmanuel-macron-stem-the-populist-tide&quot;>;Emmanuel Macron&lt;/a>;&#39;s economic policies; across the country that day, fifty thousand &lt;em>;gilets jaunes&lt;/em>; took to the streets, facing off against tear gas, water cannons, and other dispersal tactics employed by French riot police. Griveaux, who had earlier called the idea of meeting the protesters&#39; demands “unthinkable,” said on French television about the break-in, “It wasn&#39;t me who was attacked, it was the republic.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I learned about the Rue de Grenelle incident after Googling “France, January 5, 2019,” the date on which “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Vengeance-Mine-novel-Marie-NDiaye/dp/0593534247&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Vengeance-Mine-novel-Marie-NDiaye/dp/0593534247&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Vengeance-Mine-novel-Marie-NDiaye/dp/0593534247&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;Vengeance Is Mine&lt;/a>;,” the new novel by the French writer Marie NDiaye, begins. NDiaye&#39;s latest tale, a story of class conflict embedded within a psychological thriller, is scattered with interpretive hints, clues to the crimes of contemporary French society. Though it starts with a date on the calendar, the story works like a map. The novel is dotted with coördinates around Bordeaux—neighborhood and street names—which NDiaye drops into the story like pins, marking the poor sections of the city where domestic workers live and the rich ones where they work. By the last page, I was newly fluent in the social geography of Bordeaux and its environs, well traversed in the French city&#39;s throughways of privilege and its dead ends of precarity.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The novel, translated from the French by Jordan Stump, opens on that January day—with another tense office visit. A man walks into the struggling law practice of Maître (as attorneys are known in France) Susane. He looks familiar to her, and so he should. His name is Gilles Principaux. He is known throughout Bordeaux as the husband of Marlyne Principaux, a woman in jail for drowning her three small children in a bathtub in the couple&#39;s home in the affluent suburb of Le Bouscat. The case is all over the news. Yet Maître Susane suspects she knows Gilles, who wants to hire her to defend his wife, from somewhere else. She is almost certain that he is the son of a wealthy family who once employed her mother to iron their laundry. She recalls being “enraptured” by the teen-age boy, who had invited her into his bedroom, leaving her “at once dazed at the honor and anxious to prove herself worthy of that distinction.” Why, then, upon seeing him again, thirty-two years later, “did she feel as if her life were in danger?”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;When Sasha, the protagonist of “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Good-Morning-Midnight-Jean-Rhys/dp/0393303942&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Good-Morning-Midnight-Jean-Rhys/dp/0393303942&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Good-Morning-Midnight-Jean-Rhys/dp/0393303942&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;Good Morning, Midnight&lt;/a>;,” Jean Rhys&#39;s novel from the nineteen-thirties, is offered a “beautiful” room in a hotel in Paris, she scoffs at the qualifier, thinking to herself, “Never tell the truth about this business of rooms, because it would bust the roof off everything and undermine the whole social system. All rooms are the same. All rooms have four walls, a door, a window or two, a bed, a chair and perhaps a bidet. A room is a place where you hide from the wolves outside and that&#39;s all any room is.” In “Vengeance Is Mine,” rubbing shoulders with the rich means sharing a room with wolves—in Maître Susane&#39;s case, with one wolf in particular. Her memories of what exactly happened inside that bedroom are cloudy, but she recalls the rich teen-aged boy asking her what she thought of the house, rebuking her for any slips in grammar, any inelegantly formed turns of phrase. In turn, “she pulled out all the most insightful, the cleverest, the most beguiling, the most artful things her mind contained,” trying to speak with the confidence of the class whose space she had suddenly breached.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The image of that home, in the exclusive enclave of Caudéran, has stayed with Maître Susane all her life. The visit “put a spell” on her, one that took the magic out of everything else. She had always considered her parents&#39; modest home “enchanted.” But now, at just ten, she knew that “other houses were enchanted abodes, and enchanted far more intensely.” Even when the novel hints that Gilles might have abused her, she tells herself that she must be grateful to him for teaching her to want more. She even insists that the encounter inspired her to become an attorney. “He made me understand the pleasures I enjoyed and the talent I probably had for arguing and expounding,” she thinks, recalling “the boy who&#39;d initiated her, illuminated her!” NDiaye&#39;s delicately placed exclamation point suggests that Maître Susane is shouting at herself, trying to drown out the truth.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Suspense supplies the forward motion of “Vengeance Is Mine.” We are on edge when Maître Susane turns the corners of streets and the corners of her own mind, scared of what she might remember about Gilles, or the boy who might have been Gilles. After she agrees to take Marlyne Principaux&#39;s case, the gaps in her own story start to fill in. She sees that she and her client have led parallel lives. Both are the daughters of working-class strivers who pushed their children to want to be in better rooms than the ones they were born into, leaving them to deal with the consequences of whatever happened inside. In this elegantly layered tale of social stratification, NDiaye takes us through a maze of alleyways, backstreets, and elegant foyers, until we are dizzy from trying to chart the course of upward mobility and eager for a place to rest—a way out rather than in.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;NDiaye was born in 1967, the daughter of a Senegalese father and French mother. The latter raised her alone in a housing development in a suburb south of Paris. NDiaye was a prodigy who published her first novel at seventeen, and later won France&#39;s most prestigious literary award, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/11/07/the-goncourt-prize-gets-americanized&quot;>;Prix Goncourt&lt;/a>;, in 2009, for “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Three-Strong-Women-Marie-NDiaye/dp/0307741338&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Three-Strong-Women-Marie-NDiaye/dp/0307741338&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Three-Strong-Women-Marie-NDiaye/dp/0307741338&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;Three Strong Women&lt;/a>;,” a novel of interlocking tales set between France and Senegal. Success has not made NDiaye unfeeling toward the insidious injuries of class aspiration. If anything, across her work, she examines the wounds it leaves behind. “Vengeance Is Mine” shares some architectural features with NDiaye&#39;s previous novel, “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Cheffe-Cooks-Novel-Marie-NDiaye/dp/0525520473&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Cheffe-Cooks-Novel-Marie-NDiaye/dp/0525520473&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Cheffe-Cooks-Novel-Marie-NDiaye/dp/0525520473&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;The Cheffe&lt;/a>;,” in which a young girl from a poor family of farmworkers is sent to work in the home of greedy, well-off gourmands, where she becomes a cook. Like Maître Susane, she is referred to only by her job title, a sign that she has allowed herself to be defined by, or, rather, reduced to, her prestigious line of work. The Cheffe&#39;s education in cuisine is also an education in the insatiable appetites of the rich, and in the soul-hollowing experience of feeding them.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Maître Susane hires her own cook, Sharon, a Mauritian woman who also cleans her house, but her foothold in the middle class is precarious. (She only hires Sharon, who is undocumented, “as an act of militancy.”) At forty-two, she is still, by her own assessment, a “novice” in the law. She&#39;s had only a handful of clients, including Sharon, whose immigration case she has taken pro bono, and someone who wants his name changed, believing it to be that “of a slave trader.” Though her apartment, in central Bordeaux, is “grand in its appointments” with “herringbone parquet floors, seventeenth-century fireplace, tall windows with little panes,” it is barely large enough for one person. To her parents&#39; shame, she drives an old low-cost car. Her mother, “her naïve, madly loving mother,” lives in fear that Maître Susane might fall back to what she “most dreaded and so heavy-handedly endeavored to protect her [daughter] from: the abandonment of lofty aspirations, the retreat to a mediocre way of life.” The case will bring in much needed work, but she struggles to imagine what Gilles hopes to achieve. As he leaves her office after his initial visit, he asks her, “You&#39;ll get us out of this nightmare, won&#39;t you?” What would it mean to win a case when the accused has committed infanticide against their own child? “The dead were not going to extract themselves from his bad dream and be born a second time,” she thinks.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;The Medea theme has been on NDiaye&#39;s mind. She co-wrote the screenplay for “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/01/16/an-anatomy-of-a-murder-in-saint-omer&quot;>;Saint Omer&lt;/a>;,” directed and co-written by Alice Diop. The 2022 film was based on the true story of Fabienne Kabou, a French Senegalese woman who was convicted of the murder of her daughter, after the baby was found drowned on a northern French beach in 2013. In the film, the mother&#39;s name is Laurence Coly, and she has left Senegal to pursue a philosophy degree at the Sorbonne. “I wanted to leave my mark,” she tells the judge, and, indeed, the highly publicized trial allows her to achieve the kind of notoriety she craved before her ambitions were thwarted by the racist barriers laid down by French society. Asked to explain why she killed her infant daughter, she can only tell the judge, “I hope this trial will give me the answer.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;As in “Saint Omer,” NDiaye is interested in the elusiveness of motive in crimes committed by mothers, who, she suggests, are at the mercy of an insanity-inducing chorus of voices from all corners of society telling them what to do and how to behave. When Maître Susane meets Marlyne for the first time, in the visitor&#39;s room at the prison, Marlyne talks into the recorder for several pages uninterrupted, speaking of her deceased children in an almost incomprehensible stream of consciousness:&lt;/p>;&lt;blockquote >;&lt;div >;&lt;p>;But I don&#39;t miss them, no. But I&#39;ve brought them back inside me, they&#39;re tiny, in my brain. But in my belly they were all three big babies, but they were born after term, but beautiful children, heavy and long. But my God, how substantial they were! But now they&#39;re teeny-tiny in my brain.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/blockquote>;&lt;p >;She is lucid only when she begs that Gilles not be allowed to visit her. The reason for her actions remains a mystery, likely even to herself—a disorienting mix of isolation and perfectionism inside a mind shattered by expectations and the failure to meet them. Like Laurence Coly, Marlyne Principaux was a woman of great promise. On the day she murders her children, police officers find her “wearing a voluminous T-shirt with the insignia of the Sorbonne.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Reality is a slippery thing in NDiaye&#39;s novels. In the tradition of French Surrealism, she aims to get at the truth by distancing herself from it. In “Vengeance Is Mine,” Maître Susane&#39;s psyche breaks down as she works on Marlyne&#39;s case, resulting in a narrative fractured by the trauma of its protagonist. She invents details and fills in the case file with her own projections. She expresses admiration for Marlyne&#39;s mother (who reminds her of her own) for pushing her daughters to succeed in school, but that is a detail that Susane, not the family, has provided. She imagines that Gilles chose a poor girl to marry in order to manipulate her. Marlyne, she supposes, “complied with all the spoken or unspoken injunctions of that Principaux man who&#39;d been clever enough, on that score at least (the sisters and mother told themselves, according to M&lt;sup>;e&lt;/sup>; Susane), to marry a social inferior.” There is no evidence of such scheming on Gilles&#39;s part, certainly none that will stand up in court.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;But Maître Susane&#39;s proximity to Marlyne helps her approach a solution to her own mystery: of what happened in that bedroom and why she cannot put it to rest. After some time on the case, she works up the courage to ask Gilles if the two have met before. He deflects, and accuses Maître Susane of acting strange. She replies, “I turned strange when I was ten years old.” Sometimes, NDiaye reminds us, the hardest person to extract a confession from is the victim.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In a 2021 &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.thewhitereview.org/feature/interview-with-marie-ndiaye/&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.thewhitereview.org/feature/interview-with-marie-ndiaye/&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.thewhitereview.org/feature/interview-with-marie-ndiaye/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;interview&lt;/a>; with &lt;em>;The White Review&lt;/em>;, NDiaye said she never wants her books to be “described with words ending in &#39;-ist&#39;, whether that be humanist, feminist, socialist,” adding, “I can be all of those things as a citizen, but not as an artist.” NDiaye treats politics and the material conditions it creates as forces that create unpredictable, idiosyncratic outcomes. She never lets her characters be flattened to make a point. A lesser author might stage the interplay between Marlyne and Maître Susane as the contest between a mother and a professional, the novel becoming a stage for the drama of women&#39;s choices to play out. NDiaye transforms them instead into versions of a single person—two women raised to court the rich, to do whatever it took to be let into their houses, even if it meant they would never be at home in their own skin.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Maître Susane&#39;s revenge against Gilles, and everyone like him, will be to give Marlyne a defense that indicts the ruling class and its tools of exclusion. The setting will be where it all began, the home of Gilles Principaux—but, this time, Maître Susane does not ask to be let in. The novel ends with what appears to be her opening statement at trial. In her remarks, she takes the jury into the rooms of the house where Marlyne was made a recluse. “The house confesses, the house that collaborates in the crime, it confesses, it says: I was that man&#39;s accomplice,” she declares, breaking the front door down. ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;xc2n8a&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;bbof1f&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 27 Oct 2023 19:06:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Dear Pepper: All Work and No Play]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.newyorker.com/humor/daily-shouts/dear-pepper-all-work-and-no-play]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-27T10:00:00.000Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653aae03e3e379bb6e22b75d/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/O01.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;article >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attribute-verso-pattern=&quot;article-body&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;ArticlePageChunks&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p>;&lt;em>;Dear Pepper is a monthly advice-column comic by Liana Finck.

If by spending our days writing cheeky ad copy for unnecessary startups and buying and selling physical and mental clutter—and even by doing more meaningful work—we are burying our heads in the sand. There are great reasons to do these things—feeding our families, for one—but, man. Ignoring the obvious will wear on you. As will the heat, and the floods, and the smoke.&lt;/p>;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;feature-default&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;image&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:feature-default&quot;>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;Large sun beating down on person working on laptop.&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653aae03763674b88ec88c97/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/O06.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653aae03763674b88ec88c97/master/w_120,c_limit/O06.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653aae03763674b88ec88c97/master/w_240,c_limit/O06.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653aae03763674b88ec88c97/master/w_320,c_limit/O06.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653aae03763674b88ec88c97/master/w_640,c_limit/O06.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653aae03763674b88ec88c97/master/w_960,c_limit/O06.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653aae03763674b88ec88c97/master/w_1280,c_limit/O06.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653aae03763674b88ec88c97/master/w_1600,c_limit/O06.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/inline-embed>;&lt;p >;How to fake it?&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I feel like you don&#39;t need to fake it.

death, in 2021, the legendary composer has remained a steady presence on Broadway: a gender-flipped “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/12/20/two-musicals-on-the-perils-of-aging&quot;>;Company&lt;/a>;” was succeeded by a spare but magnificent “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/08/08/the-fraught-fantasies-of-into-the-woods-and-hamlet&quot;>;Into the Woods&lt;/a>;,” a baroque “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/04/10/sweeney-todd-theatre-review-broadway&quot;>;Sweeney Todd&lt;/a>;,” and, most recently, a transfer of &lt;strong>;“&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/12/26/merrily-we-roll-along-and-some-like-it-hot-bring-blockbuster-energy-to-the-stage&quot;>;Merrily We Roll Along&lt;/a>;,”&lt;/strong>; starring Jonathan Groff, Daniel Radcliffe, and Lindsay Mendez. This latest—a revival of Sondheim&#39;s notoriously troubled work from 1981—is a triumph of chemistry and empathy. The show follows a trio of friends in reverse, from lonely middle-aged successes back to the tight-knit strivers they were in their twenties. Franklin Shepard (Groff) has the farthest to fall: he&#39;s the one who abandoned his friends to make his fortune in Hollywood. But &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/09/25/merrily-we-roll-along-again&quot;>;Maria Friedman&#39;s&lt;/a>; production takes seriously the competing desires and compromises that got him there, capturing something real about the way a life sneaks up on you. The rapport between the leads makes the dissolution of their bond as wrenching as it is believable.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;GenericCallout&quot;>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;Photo from musical Here We Are by Stephen Sondheim&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653815ae6d5fb099a570e148/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Here%2520We%2520Are_Emilio%2520Madrid_3976_resized.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653815ae6d5fb099a570e148/master/w_120,c_limit/Here%20We%20Are_Emilio%20Madrid_3976_resized.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653815ae6d5fb099a570e148/master/w_240,c_limit/Here%20We%20Are_Emilio%20Madrid_3976_resized.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653815ae6d5fb099a570e148/master/w_320,c_limit/Here%20We%20Are_Emilio%20Madrid_3976_resized.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653815ae6d5fb099a570e148/master/w_640,c_limit/Here%20We%20Are_Emilio%20Madrid_3976_resized.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653815ae6d5fb099a570e148/master/w_960,c_limit/Here%20We%20Are_Emilio%20Madrid_3976_resized.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653815ae6d5fb099a570e148/master/w_1280,c_limit/Here%20We%20Are_Emilio%20Madrid_3976_resized.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653815ae6d5fb099a570e148/master/w_1600,c_limit/Here%20We%20Are_Emilio%20Madrid_3976_resized.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;Photograph by Emilio Madrid&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Friedman had known Sondheim for decades, first as an actor in and then as a director of his shows; another longtime collaborator, Joe Mantello, midwifed &lt;strong>;“Here We Are”&lt;/strong>; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/11/06/here-we-are-theatre-review&quot;>;reviewed this week by Helen Shaw&lt;/a>;), Sondheim&#39;s final musical, which opened this week, at the Shed, in a state that might generously be called unfinished. The first act follows a group of wealthy friends who are continually stymied in their efforts to eat brunch; the second, which bears almost no trace of Sondheim, finds them all at a meal they&#39;re mysteriously unable to leave. Light satire is supplanted by a descent into Hell: infidelities are uncovered, a man confesses to a murder, and the world outside, it&#39;s implied, has literally ended. None of these plot machinations matter—the characters emerge cheerfully unchanged—and, with no songs to smooth the tonal whiplash or to distract from David Ives&#39;s disjointed book, I started to feel trapped, too. (By the time someone decides a human sacrifice is required to get them out of the room, I was prepared to volunteer.) Seeing this uneven experiment on the heels of “Merrily,” whose problems were solved by years of tinkering, only underscored the loss. I couldn&#39;t help wishing that Sondheim had had more time.&lt;/p>;&lt;hr />;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;align-center&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:align-center&quot;>;&lt;h2 >;Spotlight&lt;/h2>;&lt;/inline-embed>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;GenericCallout&quot;>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;Goings On Samphas Ornate NeoSoul&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65382e7bece2f1517663d541/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/231106_r43272.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65382e7bece2f1517663d541/master/w_120,c_limit/231106_r43272.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65382e7bece2f1517663d541/master/w_240,c_limit/231106_r43272.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65382e7bece2f1517663d541/master/w_320,c_limit/231106_r43272.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65382e7bece2f1517663d541/master/w_640,c_limit/231106_r43272.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65382e7bece2f1517663d541/master/w_960,c_limit/231106_r43272.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65382e7bece2f1517663d541/master/w_1280,c_limit/231106_r43272.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65382e7bece2f1517663d541/master/w_1600,c_limit/231106_r43272.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;Illustration by Jamiel Law&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;heading&quot; aria-level=&quot;6&quot; >;Neo-Soul&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;Sampha&lt;/strong>; loves to take his time, making him a special commodity in an age of instant gratification. The English singer-songwriter&#39;s early collaborations—with an impressive list of auteurs, including Beyoncé, Drake, and Frank Ocean—treated his vocals like ornate flourishes to upgrade a song&#39;s architecture. Some of his outsourcing felt like a personal delay: Sampha tinkering with and trying to perfect his own sound. His stunning, experimental début, “Process,” from 2017, rewarded those waiting with a methodical album that blended electronic music with neo-soul as the singer grappled with losing his parents. After another extended hiatus, Sampha returns with the even more deeply considered “Lahai,” finding inspiration in new fatherhood for vital music that ruminates on progress.—&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/contributors/sheldon-pearce&quot;>;&lt;em>;Sheldon Pearce&lt;/em>;&lt;/a>; &lt;em>;(Webster Hall; Nov. 7-9.)&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>;&lt;hr />;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;GenericCallout&quot;>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;An illustration of the New York City skyline.&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64ad7fea3f0ea61101b7b5aa/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/header-2023.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64ad7fea3f0ea61101b7b5aa/master/w_120,c_limit/header-2023.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64ad7fea3f0ea61101b7b5aa/master/w_240,c_limit/header-2023.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64ad7fea3f0ea61101b7b5aa/master/w_320,c_limit/header-2023.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64ad7fea3f0ea61101b7b5aa/master/w_640,c_limit/header-2023.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64ad7fea3f0ea61101b7b5aa/master/w_960,c_limit/header-2023.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64ad7fea3f0ea61101b7b5aa/master/w_1280,c_limit/header-2023.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64ad7fea3f0ea61101b7b5aa/master/w_1600,c_limit/header-2023.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/div>;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;align-center&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:align-center&quot;>;&lt;h2 >;About Town&lt;/h2>;&lt;/inline-embed>;&lt;div role=&quot;heading&quot; aria-level=&quot;6&quot; >;Opera&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Anthony Davis&#39;s &lt;strong>;“X: The Life and Times of Malcolm X”&lt;/strong>; had its première in 1986, but, despite favorable reviews, it went largely unrevived for decades. Now this poetic musical biography of one of the twentieth century&#39;s great civil-rights orators arrives at the Met for the first time. With a mix of minimalism, atonality, and jazz, the opera transforms Malcolm&#39;s confrontational declamations into something more mesmeric, like incantations, as in a potent Act I aria in which Malcolm (Will Liverman) sings, “You want the truth, but you don&#39;t want to know.” Robert O&#39;Hara&#39;s production, originally staged in Detroit, has stops in Seattle and Chicago—so it seems that companies are finally ready to listen.—&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/contributors/oussama-zahr&quot;>;&lt;em>;Oussama Zahr&lt;/em>;&lt;/a>; &lt;em>;(Metropolitan Opera House; select dates Nov. 3-Dec. 2.)&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>;&lt;hr />;&lt;div role=&quot;heading&quot; aria-level=&quot;6&quot; >;Dance&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;With its lists of compliments and come-ons, the Song of Songs is one of the most sensually suggestive parts of the Bible. “Song of Songs,” a dance-theatre work by &lt;strong>;Pam Tanowitz&lt;/strong>; and &lt;strong>;David Lang,&lt;/strong>; is ardent but chaste. Lang&#39;s compositions analyze fragments of the scriptural text in limpid vocal harmony. Tanowitz&#39;s choreography is classical and largely indirect, with touches of folk dance and only hints of erotic pursuit and longing. In its formal beauty, “Song of Songs” resembles her earlier pieces “New Work for Goldberg Variations” and “Four Quartets,” though it&#39;s a little paler. Here, both music and dance, refined in their repetitions, emphasize choral expression, communal love.—&lt;em>;Brian Seibert (New York City Center; Nov. 9-11.)&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>;&lt;hr />;&lt;div role=&quot;heading&quot; aria-level=&quot;6&quot; >;Off Broadway&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;GenericCallout&quot;>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;Scene from David Adjmis production “Stereophonic” with Chris Stack and Tom Pecinka&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65383aedad11909755d07209/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Stereophonic_0970_resized.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65383aedad11909755d07209/master/w_120,c_limit/Stereophonic_0970_resized.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65383aedad11909755d07209/master/w_240,c_limit/Stereophonic_0970_resized.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65383aedad11909755d07209/master/w_320,c_limit/Stereophonic_0970_resized.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65383aedad11909755d07209/master/w_640,c_limit/Stereophonic_0970_resized.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65383aedad11909755d07209/master/w_960,c_limit/Stereophonic_0970_resized.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65383aedad11909755d07209/master/w_1280,c_limit/Stereophonic_0970_resized.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65383aedad11909755d07209/master/w_1600,c_limit/Stereophonic_0970_resized.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;Photograph by Chelcie Parry&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;The exquisitely designed world-première production of David Adjmi&#39;s &lt;strong>;“Stereophonic”&lt;/strong>; plunks viewers into a nineteen-seventies California recording studio, where, between snorts of cocaine and screaming matches, an up-and-coming rock band grinds away at an album. Seated behind the mixing board, the audience gazes into a glass-walled booth where the band lays down tracks (written—though you&#39;d never guess it from how period-perfect they sound—by Will Butler, formerly of Arcade Fire). Sessions are continually delayed by Peter (Tom Pecinka), the band&#39;s perfectionist guitarist, who offers nonstop ideas (sometimes good) and feedback (never good), usually to the lead singer, Diana (Sarah Pidgeon, a standout in a strong ensemble), his long-suffering girlfriend. Adjmi and the director, Daniel Aukin, never soft-pedal the electric drama, but, as with some seventies rock classics, you may wish that it had been trimmed.—&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/contributors/dan-stahl&quot;>;&lt;em>;Dan Stahl&lt;/em>;&lt;/a>; &lt;em>;(Playwrights Horizons; through Nov. 26.)&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>;&lt;hr />;&lt;div role=&quot;heading&quot; aria-level=&quot;6&quot; >;Indie Rock&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;The Chicago-based indie-rock band &lt;strong>;Slow Pulp&lt;/strong>; exists in a near-constant state of dazed soul-searching. Across its two albums, the group has made a fuzzy kind of dream pop that scratches the brain with its muted textures. Emily Massey, the lead singer, has a gauzy voice that dissolves into quietly lush guitar beds, and Slow Pulp&#39;s clouded sound is mirrored by her lyrics, which navigate self-doubt. The band&#39;s 2020 début, “Moveys,” proceeds briskly through its songs; this year&#39;s follow-up, “Yard,” is mellower in its pursuit of introspection and fulfillment. Its closer, “Fishes,” marks an important turn in Slow Pulp&#39;s evolution: toward greater trust in the self.—&lt;em>;Sheldon Pearce (Bowery Ballroom on Nov. 1 and Nov. 4; Le Poisson Rouge on Nov. 2.)&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>;&lt;hr />;&lt;div role=&quot;heading&quot; aria-level=&quot;6&quot; >;Art&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;gcli7&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;Henry Taylor the dress ain&amp;#x27;t me 2011&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653834f1ad11909755d07207/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/RS73760_TAYLH112837_resized.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653834f1ad11909755d07207/master/w_120,c_limit/RS73760_TAYLH112837_resized.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653834f1ad11909755d07207/master/w_240,c_limit/RS73760_TAYLH112837_resized.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653834f1ad11909755d07207/master/w_320,c_limit/RS73760_TAYLH112837_resized.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653834f1ad11909755d07207/master/w_640,c_limit/RS73760_TAYLH112837_resized.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653834f1ad11909755d07207/master/w_960,c_limit/RS73760_TAYLH112837_resized.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653834f1ad11909755d07207/master/w_1280,c_limit/RS73760_TAYLH112837_resized.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653834f1ad11909755d07207/master/w_1600,c_limit/RS73760_TAYLH112837_resized.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;“the dress, ain&#39;t me,” 2011&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Art work © Henry Taylor / Courtesy the artist / Hauser &amp;amp; Wirth; Photograph by Serge Hasenböhler&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;p >;Henry Taylor, the sixty-five-year-old subject of &lt;strong>;“Henry Taylor: B Side,”&lt;/strong>; has lived in Los Angeles for years, and sometimes seems to have painted everyone who&#39;s spent any time there at all, from panhandlers and music moguls to his siblings and the Obamas. The richness of Black American community and the indignities of Black American life, in particular the violence of law enforcement, are his recurring themes. There&#39;s also an undeniable strain of impishness and amoral weirdness in his images: after a friend of his, the artist Noah Davis, died of cancer, Taylor painted the man as an adolescent (or a man trapped in an adolescent&#39;s body).

Opening night was six weeks away and his thoughts were crowded with technical and ideological uncertainties. Beijing Renyi, as the People&#39;s Theatre was popularly known, was the country&#39;s most prestigious modern-drama institution, but, all the same, sound effects and music had to be produced with a decades-old East German tape recorder, the set designer was obliged to make a cardboard box stand in for a refrigerator, and the lights would go dim during daytime rehearsals, because the whole city&#39;s voltage dropped when factories were in operation. Miller, who did not speak any Chinese, would be entirely reliant on an interpreter as he directed, and he worried, too, about what else might be lost in translation: could a society long removed from commercial life make sense of a man like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1999/01/25/making-willy-loman&quot;>;Willy Loman&lt;/a>;, whose dreams and crises were so bound up in nineteen-forties American materialism?&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The encounter between Miller and the members of Beijing Renyi is the subject of a new play at the Connelly Theatre, in the East Village, “Salesman之死,” by Jeremy Tiang. As the title hints—pronounced “Salesman zhīsǐ,” it simply means “death of a salesman”—the play flows bilingually back and forth between Mandarin and English. It is surtitled in both languages, and all the roles, including that of Miller himself, are played by a cast of six Asian women, five of whom are Chinese-speaking immigrants. Often making use of Miller&#39;s book about the episode—“&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Salesman-Beijing-Arthur-Miller/dp/067061601X&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Salesman-Beijing-Arthur-Miller/dp/067061601X&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Salesman-Beijing-Arthur-Miller/dp/067061601X&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;Salesman in Beijing&lt;/a>;”—the play dramatizes the misunderstandings and sudden connections of the rehearsal process, weaving them into a larger consideration of the distances and intimacies between the two countries and cultures.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Miller had been curious about the Chinese Revolution for years. In 1973, he wrote to the Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai pleading for a visa but got no response. Finally, in the fall of 1978, two years after the death of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tag/mao-zedong&quot;>;Mao Zedong&lt;/a>;, the Chinese People&#39;s Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries brought Miller to China for a visit of several weeks. During the visit, Miller met with various Chinese dramatists and directors, including the playwright Cao Yu, who was also the head of Beijing Renyi, and the famous actor-director Ying Ruocheng. The two of them later invited him to come back and direct “Salesman.” Meanwhile, Miller&#39;s wife, the Magnum photographer Inge Morath, who had been studying Chinese for years, set about recording what she saw on film. The country &lt;a href=&quot;https://cdn.theatlantic.com/media/archives/1979/03/243-3/132638042.pdf&quot;>;she photographed&lt;/a>; had only just emerged from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/02/01/what-are-the-cultural-revolutions-lessons-for-our-current-moment&quot;>;Cultural Revolution&lt;/a>;, and its quotidian realities were almost unknown to the outside world. As he watched her at work, Miller noted, “The ability to be surprised is a virtue.” “Salesman之死” finds humor in such cross-cultural surprises. When one character explains the concept of life-insurance policies—“people get money for dying”—another nods and says, “Oh, like revolutionary martyrs!”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Tiang, who was born in Singapore, developed the play alongside its director, Michael Leibenluft, who speaks Chinese and has directed plays in China. For the central character of their play, they picked not Miller but rather his interpreter, a twentysomething academic named Shen Huihui. Shen had written her graduate thesis on Arthur Miller and was a rising star at Peking University when she was approached by Ying, the actor-director Miller had met on his previous visit. Ying, now best known in the West for an appearance in Bernardo Bertolucci&#39;s “The Last Emperor,” played Willy Loman in the Beijing production and translated the text. He was ensconced in China&#39;s intellectual élite. His father was a famous educator and his paternal grandfather had married into the Qing royal family and founded a newspaper, &lt;em>;Ta Kung Pao&lt;/em>;, that is still in circulation. Ying had read “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Death-Salesman-Conversations-Twentieth-Century-Classics/dp/0141180978&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Death-Salesman-Conversations-Twentieth-Century-Classics/dp/0141180978&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Death-Salesman-Conversations-Twentieth-Century-Classics/dp/0141180978&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;Death of a Salesman&lt;/a>;” in December, 1949, the same year it premièred in America, and just weeks after the People&#39;s Republic of China was founded. For most of his life, performing it in China would have been an impossibility. In Tiang&#39;s play, Ying is exasperated when Shen, worried about neglecting her academic work, hesitates to take on the task of interpreting for Miller. The project “will clear a path for us to step out into the world,” he says. “Do you know how many decades I&#39;ve been waiting for the chance?”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;For decades before the Communists came to power, modern realist drama had flourished in China. Cao Yu, whom Miller met in 1978, was one of its star playwrights. But, after the Cultural Revolution began, in 1966, Beijing Renyi&#39;s rehearsal rooms were repurposed to house hundreds of Red Guards, and Cao went from being a cultural gatekeeper to an actual one—charged with directing cars to park in an alley by the theatre that he&#39;d previously managed. In a courtyard nearby, another of the theatre&#39;s most famous dramatists, Lao She, was taunted and abused by a group of Red Guards, and later found dead. In 1968, Ying and his wife were imprisoned, and later they were exiled to a reëducation center in the countryside, working on a rice farm. As it happened, Jiang Qing, Mao&#39;s powerful wife, was a former actress, and she promoted eight so-called model plays, which used the traditional forms of Beijing opera to convey revolutionary messages. Characters in such plays were either good or bad—there was no room for such a thing as a conflicted inner life.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Miller&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1996/10/21/why-i-wrote-the-crucible&quot;>;experiences&lt;/a>; with the House Un-American Activities Committee surely helped him relate to what his Beijing cast had been through. (In 1957, a congressman from Ohio had asked him, “Why do you write so sadly?”) During rehearsals Miller patiently worked with the actors to find common ground between their vastly different experiences. Ying, playing Willy Loman, found it hard to understand the character&#39;s delusional behaviors, as when he holds out hope for a business loan even after his son Biff has told him that it won&#39;t happen. Miller asked the actors to search their own lives for situations that they could neither bear nor adapt to, leaving self-deceiving hope as the only way forward. Ying laughed, immediately seeing the point. “It&#39;s as Chinese as hell,” he said. “It&#39;s our whole history.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Away from the rehearsal room, Miller and Morath took hours-long bike rides around town. “The tourist mind presses attention outward, but living in a place lets things in,” Miller wrote. They saw a city “intimate with itself”: in open spaces, men played checkers games and grandmas beat quilts. Miller and Morath could see early signs of Deng Xiaoping&#39;s market reforms. To counter youth unemployment, the government had begun to encourage small businesses. On the street, skilled laborers repaired bikes and made furniture. The atmosphere made Miller think of the tenements of the Lower East Side, the world in which his immigrant father had been a young man—“the philosophers congregating on the stoops, the future gangsters and judges and songwriters yelling across the areaways.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Part of Miller&#39;s struggle was to situate the 1983 production in a place that felt specific, without being necessarily Chinese or American. Early on, he was startled to find his cast in whiteface, wearing light-colored wigs, walking with an exaggeratedly “Western” gait. “Act yourself,” he urged them. Tiang&#39;s play often teases out the issues of identity latent in such moments. At one point, Ying&#39;s wife, a literary translator, refers to the author Bette Bao Lord, famous in the eighties for her best-selling novel “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Spring-Moon-Bette-Bao-Lord/dp/0060599758&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Spring-Moon-Bette-Bao-Lord/dp/0060599758&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Spring-Moon-Bette-Bao-Lord/dp/0060599758&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;Spring Moon&lt;/a>;,” as being “both Chinese and American, if such a thing is possible.” What makes the line so striking is not just that a cultural fusion so unthinkable to a nineteen-eighties Beijinger (and probably to many nineteen-eighties Americans) is now commonplace. More than that, the entire production with its cross-cultural, multinational, multilingual cast, writer, and director exists in this previously unimaginable hybrid space.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;There is a kind of cultural vertigo involved in seeing how deftly the actresses transform themselves as they switch between roles, or as they represent Chinese people representing Americans. Some of the mannerisms are unmistakably old Beijing: a working-class man spreading his legs and cursing, a cadre tapping his mug of tea when he&#39;s impatient. At other times, it feels as if nationality has almost evaporated. When Biff, wearing a baseball cap, exclaims in a perfect Beijing accent, “Pop, I&#39;m nothing! I&#39;m nothing, Pop! Can&#39;t you understand that?,” there is no sense of splintered identity, only a young person, put down by the world. He&#39;s angry at suffocating parental expectations but, at the same time, pained by his anger. The moment is a kind of fruition of Miller&#39;s own aspiration to create “something not quite American or Chinese but a pure style springing from the heart of the play itself—the play as a nonnational event, that is, a human circumstance.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Miller&#39;s show in Beijing was a success. People applauded ceaselessly. Lingering viewers missed the last bus. One professor walked eleven miles back home so he could ponder more. Miller soon left China, but the production ran for some fifty performances. As for Shen, the reluctant interpreter, toward the end of “Salesman之死,” we learn that she was so transformed by the experience that she decided to go to the US as a visiting scholar. “The door is open,” she says. “I don&#39;t know when it will shut again, but right now, I can walk through it.” Ying, a mentor figure by now, encourages her, borrowing the line that Willy often says to Biff—“the door of your life is wide open.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Shen is now in her late sixties and lives in Vancouver, and Tiang and Leibenluft interviewed her while developing the play. The play ends with projected footage of her speaking and, because she is speaking mostly Mandarin, the cast members take it in turns to translate what she says—the interpreter herself interpreted. The thing that stuck in Shen&#39;s mind, she says, was not the triumph of the production or the famous people she met, but a quiet moment one night, after rehearsal. It was nine or ten, and she took the tram to Chang&#39;an Street, in downtown Beijing. The street lamps emitted a warm light. “It felt as if everyone was resting, and I was the only one still at work, doing something very meaningful,” she says. “I was the chosen one.” As the six actresses translate her story, the projection of Shen blankets the stage. She smiles and nods, as if passing on the blessing Ying gave her forty years ago to the six actresses, younger versions of herself. ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;86wxu&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;a11m7o&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 27 Oct 2023 19:06:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“Fellow Travelers” Shows Another Side of Gay History]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/11/06/fellow-travelers-tv-review-showtime]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-27T10:00:00.000Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653950a9bca6913fb19e8249/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/231106_r43287.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;article >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attribute-verso-pattern=&quot;article-body&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;ArticlePageChunks&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Joseph McCarthy, whose pursuit of national purity exposed his own moral degradation, wasn&#39;t the sort to grant dignity to his enemies. “If you want to be against McCarthy,” he reportedly told the press, “you&#39;ve got to be either a Communist or a cocksucker.” The Wisconsin senator&#39;s right hand during his Red-baiting years was his chief counsel, Roy Cohn, who in turn recruited a pretty-boy hotel heir named David Schine. That the threesome spearheaded the Red Scare of the nineteen-fifties, as well as the accompanying Lavender Scare—which sought to rout gay men and lesbians from government service—didn&#39;t stop rumors from circulating about their own sexual inclinations; the playwright Lillian Hellman dubbed the trio of bachelors “Bonnie, Bonnie, and Clyde.” By the time Cohn died, from complications of &lt;em >;AIDS&lt;/em>;, in 1986, he was nearly as infamous for denying his own queerness as he was for his prosecutorial viciousness. McCarthy, too, was the subject of whispers—he was no stranger, allegedly, to Milwaukee&#39;s gay bars. They wouldn&#39;t be the last men to persecute their peers to deflect from their own apparent proximity to the closet, but they may have been the only ones to do so in such flamboyant fashion.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;McCarthy and Cohn are secondary characters in the remarkable new period drama “Fellow Travelers,” on Showtime, a generation-spanning romance between two ambitious men who first find each other amid the hunt for “subversives and deviants” in Washington. (The title derives from the real-life McCarthy&#39;s term for Communist sympathizers.) When Hawkins “Hawk” Fuller (Matt Bomer), a mid-level State Department official with a Bronze Star to attest to his manliness, meets the milk-sipping, charmingly priggish Tim Laughlin (Jonathan Bailey) at an Election Night party, the attraction is immediate. Unlike Hawk, who aspires to climb the ranks and cap a respectable if undistinguished career with a luxurious posting abroad, Tim is yet another young idealist who&#39;s come to DC to make a difference. Hawk, though far from a McCarthy ally, gets Tim a position in the Senator&#39;s office—a staggering opportunity for the devoutly religious young man, who excuses his hero&#39;s “rough tactics” as necessary for the greater good. It&#39;s not long before Tim learns that Hawk&#39;s gifts are always meant to be repaid.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The series&#39; creator, Ron Nyswaner, who adapted Thomas Mallon&#39;s 2007 novel of the same name, jumps between time lines, deftly weaving together Hawk and Tim&#39;s decades-long ardor with the historical events that follow: the Vietnam War, the assassination of Harvey Milk, and the &lt;em >;AIDS&lt;/em>; crisis, as the federal government&#39;s treatment of the LGBTQ community shifts from targeted hostility to malicious neglect. But it&#39;s during the Eisenhower era that “Fellow Travelers” is at its most absorbing, when the DC gay scene is functionally segregated, and solidarity is contingent at best. Constant surveillance heightens the risks of intimacy—and the furtive thrills of bathroom hookups. As much as Hawk despises McCarthy and Cohn, he&#39;s just as prepared to betray his associates to keep his own image clean; the difference between their mode of self-preservation and his is only a matter of scale. It doesn&#39;t seem to occur to him, until he meets Tim, that other men are available not only for cruising but also for love. Throughout the series, people in Hawk and Tim&#39;s orbit grapple with what queerness means, and what it can be. A lesbian friend, Mary (Erin Neufer), advises Tim that “hiding a part of yourself and killing it are two different things.” Marcus (Jelani Alladin), a Black man burdened by his father&#39;s dream for him to become the “Jackie Robinson of journalism,” distances himself from the gay movement—and elides his sexuality in his writing—in order to focus on race. His skittishness is a chronic disappointment to his on-again, off-again boyfriend, the drag queen Frankie (Noah J. Ricketts), who has no desire to pass as straight the way Marcus does. Tim comes to embrace the word “gay”; Hawk insists on “homosexual.” Each individual&#39;s relationship to his identity is both a question of philosophical sweep and one of brute survival.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The eight-part miniseries benefits from its fairly novel (and thematically complex) historical backdrop, but it develops into one of the year&#39;s best dramas through its rich characterizations. The casting of the leads is a particular achievement. Bomer, with his broad-shouldered athleticism and blandly handsome matinée-idol looks, channels Don Draper, whose besuited virility was all the more beguiling for his stoic unknowability. (For Hawk, like the “Mad Men” protagonist, the faultless masculine surface is all performance—though Draper never kept his heart rate down during a polygraph test by picturing Mamie Eisenhower.) But Bailey is the showstopper as Tim, a born zealot who&#39;s at ease only when armed with a clear sense of purpose. As young men, Hawk and Tim tell themselves that, however much they love each other, they want other things more. Hawk&#39;s cynicism and his desire for a traditional family life, including a wife and children, put him at odds with Tim, whose need to belong, if not to surrender, to something greater than himself can be met only temporarily with sex. The latter&#39;s yearning for the sublime undergirds his tortured relationship to Catholicism; with his willowy frame, floppy hair, and bespectacled visage, he has the makings of a modern martyr. It&#39;s no surprise that, as he grows older, he flips from the radical right to the activist left. The most compelling question the series asks is who, or what, will finally consume Tim in the way that he craves.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Tim and Hawk&#39;s affair is both satisfyingly unpredictable and magnificently erotic, their trysts tinged with mid-century camp. (The heat between Bomer and Bailey, stoked in part by the gleeful creativity of the sex scenes, certainly helps.) During one of their early meetings, when Tim announces that he&#39;s departing for noontime Mass, Hawk makes his interest explicit by leaning in and half-whispering, “I&#39;ll spend the rest of the afternoon picturing you kneeling in prayer.” Tim&#39;s answering smile says it all. Once the complications of reality set in, the push-pull dynamic becomes irresistible not because you&#39;re rooting for them to be together but because it&#39;s impossible to decide whether they should stay that way. Unlike most great onscreen love stories, this is a romance in which one person is fundamentally unworthy of the other—and yet it&#39;s undeniable that they&#39;re each other&#39;s best chance at happiness.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The supporting cast is nearly as strong, though the time-line hopping and the old-age makeup don&#39;t always work to their advantage. Allison Williams, who plays Hawk&#39;s wife, Lucy, is out of her depth as the gray-haired society matron who is finally forced to confront Tim&#39;s indelible role in her husband&#39;s life. The historical figures are among the most impressive, even if the series&#39; investment in their contradictions is perhaps more than they deserve. Will Brill embodies Roy Cohn brilliantly, full of the wounded, howling humanity implied by the epitaph on Cohn&#39;s eventual &lt;em >;AIDS&lt;/em>;-quilt panel: “Bully. Coward. Victim.” Chris Bauer is unrecognizable under heavy prosthetics, save for his bald pate and bulldog growl, but he manages to get at the oblique flirtations that McCarthy allowed himself with unsuspecting staffers. It&#39;s in those fleeting moments of stolen pleasure that you can see what might have been, if these men had been motivated by anything other than fear. ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;ypz4lj&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;hc0bph&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 27 Oct 2023 19:06:02 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
