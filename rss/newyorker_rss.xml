aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;在接下来的三十年里，德哈德在多篇论文和两本书中详细阐述了他的观点，“&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Divine-Milieu-Newly-revised-Translation -Cowell/dp/1903900581&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Divine-Milieu-Newly-revised- Translation-Cowell/dp/1903900581&amp;quot;}&quot;

rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;人类现象&lt;/a>;。”梵蒂冈和他的耶稣会上级禁止他出版任何神学著作，但他仍然是一名忠实的天主教徒和服从的耶稣会士。 1948 年访问美国后，他在纽约市的一处耶稣会住所定居，并于 1955 年复活节周日去世，并开始出版他的作品。在 1962 年首次召开的第二届梵蒂冈大公会议期间，对他的作品的批评有所缓和，他的著作成为进步神学家的标准文本，直到在传统主义教皇约翰·保罗二世和&lt;a href=&quot;https」的领导下，它们再次失宠。 ://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/benedict-xvis-most-powerful-influence-on-the-catholic-church-came-before-he-was-pope&quot;>;本笃十六世&lt;/a>; ，即使他们时不时地亲自热情地谈论他。&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;然而，这位教皇强调以德哈德为榜样。从 2015 年开始，他关于气候问题的里程碑式通谕《愿你受赞颂》（Laudato Si）中（预计他将在下个月发布另一本通谕）中，他引用了德哈德的灵感。在蒙古庆祝主日弥撒后，方济各热情地谈到了德哈德，以及他在那里庆祝的弥撒一百周年。 “这位经常被误解的牧师，”他说，“凭直觉认为‘圣体圣事总是以某种方式在世界的祭坛上庆祝。’” ” 教皇正在将神父从边缘地带带回来，并加入他自己的亚洲之旅，前往德哈德。&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;方济各的商标其话语风格是发表即兴评论，显然是站在进步一边，但对如何实现进步却含糊其辞，这种倾向最近也引发了争议。 8 月 25 日，教宗方济各与年轻的俄罗斯天主教徒进行了视频通话，敦促他们与“圣徒、统治者的大俄罗斯、彼得一世、叶卡捷琳娜二世的大俄罗斯、那个伟大、开明、伟大的文化和伟大的人性”，乌克兰希腊天主教会领袖斯维亚托斯拉夫·舍夫丘克大主教立即谴责教皇庆祝过去和现在的俄罗斯帝国主义。随后，耶稣会杂志&lt;em>;La Civiltà Cattolica&lt;/em>;发表了方济各在本月早些时候访问期间与葡萄牙耶稣会士的部分谈话记录。当有人问及包括主教在内的一些美国天主教徒对他的公开批评时，方济各详细地回答了。 “你们已经看到，美国的情况并不容易：反动态度非常强烈。它是有组织的，塑造了人们的归属方式，甚至是情感上的归属方式，”他说。 “我想提醒那些人，&lt;em>;独立主义&lt;/em>;”——落后——“是没有用的，我们需要明白，对信仰问题的理解有一个适当的演变。”他后来补充道，“你谈论的那些美国团体如此封闭，正在孤立自己。他们不是靠教义生活，不是靠总是发展和结出果实的真正教义生活，而是靠意识形态生活。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;每个人都想知道，方济各在谈论哪些美国团体？在&lt;em>;泰晤士报&lt;/em>;中，美国保护传统、家庭和财产协会的 C. Preston Noell III（一个位于宾夕法尼亚州的一个巴西团体的分支，成立于 1960 年，旨在抵制所谓的共产主义影响）教会）指出，方济各在美国担任教皇还不到一周，这表明他对这里教会的生活知之甚少。 《华盛顿邮报》刊登了一份嫌疑人档案，其中包括阿拉巴马州传统天主教有线电视网络 EWTN 的主持人雷蒙德·阿罗约 (Raymond Arroyo)，他是该网络反对方济各的化身。其他人则提到红衣主教雷蒙德·伯克(Raymond Burke)，他曾担任圣路易斯大主教，后来担任梵蒂冈官员，直到2014年被免职，并于今年早些时候被另一职位取代。在 &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Synodal-Process-Pandoras-Box-Questions/dp/1877905771&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&quot;element&quot; 的前言中， ：“ExternalLink”、“outgoingURL”：“https://www.amazon.com/Synodal-Process-Pandoras-Box-Questions/dp/1877905771”}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon. com/Synodal-Process-Pandoras-Box-Questions/dp/1877905771&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;新书&lt;/a>;，伯克写道，十月会议将造成“混乱和错误”并导致“对许多灵魂造成严重伤害”。该书已由保护传统、家庭和财产协会以八种语言出版，该协会已向主教和神职人员发送了副本，其中一些人将成为主教会议的代表。&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt; /div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node- id=&quot;a16dn&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;nxwq5 &quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;很可能这些人是方济各在葡萄牙与耶稣会士交谈时想到的一些人。但从美国天主教在全球天主教近代史上的地位来审视他的言论也许更具启发性。这就是“一切崛起必汇聚”这一观念的恰当之处。一个世纪前，“现代主义”和“美国主义”在天主教罗马人眼中是同义词。梵蒂冈二世对宗教自由原则的肯定植根于美国耶稣会政治哲学家约翰·考特尼·默里的著作。 1965 年 10 月，教皇保罗六世访问纽约，在圣帕特里克大教堂发表讲话，在华尔道夫酒店会见约翰逊总统，在联合国大会上发表讲话，在洋基体育场举行弥撒，并参观了世界博览会在一天之内举行——可以说是他任期内的顶峰。梵蒂冈二世之后的乡土礼仪、现代棱角分明的教堂建筑、强调与其他基督教会和其他信仰的友好关系，都非常适合人口众多、影响力大、灵活且繁荣的美国教会。 1978 年 10 月当选的约翰·保罗二世在早期两次访问美国时获得了标志性的地位，并受到罗纳德·里根总统的推崇。约翰·保罗在美国天主教徒中仍然非常受欢迎，尽管许多人不同意或远离他所采取的特定立场。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;约翰·保罗和他的副手红衣主教约瑟夫·拉辛格也重塑了美国神职人员和等级制度。他们的形象，宣扬极端正统、坚决反对同性恋和堕胎的男性。美国红衣主教——约翰·奥康纳，纽约；伯纳德·劳，波士顿； &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/what-the-new-vatican-report-shows-about-the-churchs-failure-to-address- Sex-abuse&quot;>;住在纽瓦克和华盛顿特区的西奥多·麦卡里克（Theodore McCarrick）享有与教皇的特殊接触。当拉辛格接替约翰·保罗，成为本笃十六世时，纽约的蒂莫西·多兰、费城的查尔斯·查普特和洛杉矶的何塞·戈麦斯接替了他们，他们在梵蒂冈的地位赋予了他们在美国教会的地位，而副总统反之亦然。随着天主教在欧洲和拉丁美洲失去影响力，在美国，它对公共政策的影响力却越来越大，这一发展最终导致&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tag/roe- v-韦德&quot;>;罗伊诉韦德&lt;/a>;。想象一位美国人可能当选教皇并不夸张，比如红衣主教多兰，他的名字出现在 2013 年本笃辞职后的候选名单上。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;相反，布宜诺斯艾利斯的耶稣会红衣主教是当选。这位来自美洲的第一位教皇不仅没有表现出对美国的特别尊重，而且还没有表现出对美国的尊重。美国教会已经成为阻碍方济各和他的天主教愿景的教会。这一愿景致力于穷人和决心走向世界边缘的人，致力于“近在咫尺”的上帝，相信，正如德哈德所说，“上帝离我们并不遥远。他是我的笔、我的镐、我的画笔、我的针——还有我的心和我的思想。”也就是说，传统主义美国天主教的崛起遇到了进步的拉丁美洲教皇的崛起，他的愿景集中在南半球。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;所有这一切都是下个月即将到来的清算的前奏。会议。人们熟悉的说法是，方济各的年龄——他将在十二月满八十七岁——使得他迫切需要努力促进教会的进步。但美国传统主义者的老龄化也同样重要。红衣主教大主教（大城市总教区的负责人）必须在年满七十五岁时提交辞呈，而那些被允许留下来的人一旦年满八十就不能再在红衣主教团中投票选举新教皇。伯克红衣主教七十五岁；红衣主教多兰将作为主教会议的代表，现年七十三岁。传统主义者有理由担心方济各将带领教会进入九十多岁（如果不是本笃十六世在八十五岁时意外退休，他可能会这样做），然后将教皇职位让给他所任命的年轻红衣主教选出的继任者。任命。对于传统主义者来说，这次会议就像是最后一站，刚刚过去的两位教皇的遗产将与现任教皇的决心融合在一起。 ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;q5sq0c&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt; div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-隐藏=“true”>;&lt;div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/ div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;div>;&lt;div>;&lt;div>;&lt;div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 19 Sep 2023 01:06:01 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Jeremy O.

aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;哈里斯是很高，很瘦，以即兴的精确度处理自己的身体，非正式中夹杂着正式，就像休息日在商场里的舞者一样。从肩膀开始的动作总是在指尖结束。当他在句子之间摸索思想时，他会用手在空中画出形状。他有着白皙的雪松皮肤和一张活泼的大嘴。当他处于中性情绪时，他的眼睛平静且低垂，但当他讲故事或表达紧急（通常是反对）意见时，他的眼睛睁得大大的。故事有时会促使他站起来，对关键的动作段落进行哑剧表演。在写作之前，他的第一个梦想就是行动。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;当第三杯咖啡端上来时，他终于正确地坐在靠窗的沙发上，点燃了一支香烟。他说，尽管致命的呼吸道疾病在全球范围内蔓延，他认识的很多人又开始吸烟了：“我们的肺部随时可能衰竭，而我们只是，你知道，去他妈的。”&lt;/p >;&lt;p>;咖啡和美国精神，窗外的白光——他在阳光下醒来的本能得到了证实。白天的公寓很舒适。一面墙上挂着一幅巨大的抽象画，颜色为黄褐色和酒红色，涂着明亮的口红。楼上是一间卧室，他与新男友阿万德·科斯拉维 (Arvand Khosravi) 合住，阿万德·科斯拉维是​​一名影视主管。楼梯顶部有一扇玻璃门，通向屋顶上的一个浅壁架，哈里斯经常去那里拍摄 TikTok 视频——大多是对经典戏剧场景的罂粟花、快节奏的即兴重复——他几乎每天都会发布这些视频。其中一个标题为“&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://twitter.com/jeremyoharris/status/1246604978346754049&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot; ：“https://twitter.com/jeremyoharris/status/1246604978346754049”}&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jeremyoharris/status/1246604978346754049&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;泰特斯·安德洛尼克斯第五幕&lt;/a>;”，他穿着四种不同的服装，假唱电视节目《鲶鱼》中的对话；它有九秒长。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;哈里斯玩 TikTok 是为了好玩；几周来，它们是他创造性表达的唯一途径。但他们也毫不隐晦地讽刺了他最近获得名声的职业。 TikTok 植根于戏剧的历史和经典剧目，但戏剧性地与超当前的节奏、态度和风格结合在一起，证明哈里斯可以做到大型艺术机构无法做到的事情——跟上。他想，当他们陷入困境时，他的手机就能继续演出。他将自己经常更新的 Twitter 帐户上的简介更改为剧院的墓志铭：“我在昏迷中花了 20 多岁的时间致力于一门手艺。”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline -recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;舞台处处漆黑；剧院公司和非营利组织都在争先恐后。在他们的公开声明和与剧作家的私人谈话中，他们都表现出乐观的态度，好像他们的业务将在夏季结束前启动并运行。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“就像，不，伙计们！”哈里斯描述了他的挫败感。 “我们必须重新发明这个或重新创造这个，否则六个月后，当你们浪费资源试图走正常的道路时，这将对艺术家更加不利。” “爸爸”仍然在英国陷入困境，他还有另一部戏剧，“男孩公司出品：‘告诉我，如果我伤害了你’”——他版本的詹姆士一世时期的复仇剧，基于一次特别糟糕的分手——预定于5 月在纽约 Playwrights Horizo​​ns 首次亮相。没有人会正式承认——或者也许让自己相信——接下来的几季不会发生，但哈里斯已经在哀悼新剧了，就像他哀悼“爸爸”一样。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;他的愤怒尽管如此，思考和谈论他所在行业的失败似乎让他充满活力——几乎让他感到平静——而他在网上的抱怨很快就引起了更广泛的情绪的共鸣。随着疫情最初的冲击逐渐被对种族和其他社会安排的重新评估所取代，哈里斯成为了他的艺术家同行所感受到的长期且突然的严重动荡的代言人。这个时刻非常适合哈里斯对制度批评的自然倾向，尽管有些矛盾。他是一个快乐的优雅沉默的颠覆者，尽管如此，他还是通过娱乐界一些最稳重的前哨基地制定了一条职业和个人道路：耶鲁大学戏剧学院;他为 Gucci 担任模特；洛杉矶各个好莱坞毗邻的街区；现在，最引人注目的是白色大道。去年秋天，哈里斯在纽约上演的第一部作品《奴隶戏剧》在市中心著名的纽约剧院工作室进行了长时间的演出后，转移到了百老汇的黄金剧院。&lt;/p>;&lt; 《奴隶游戏》讲述了三对跨种族夫妇接受“战前性行为治疗”的故事，大概是为了修复因种族问题而破裂的关系。在第一幕中，在观众进入现场之前，一对身着十九世纪服装的夫妇，作为主人和奴隶，参与了各种变态的性场景，这些场景旨在在对种族和性别敏感的美国人心中引发绊脚石。第二幕是真正的治疗发生，非常有趣。第三首是一对夫妇（一名黑人妇女和她的白人丈夫）之间的超现实且令人恐惧的二重唱。 《奴隶游戏》一遍又一遍地质疑性同意的真实参数，并试图从主奴强奸的残酷历史中汲取当今的宣泄情绪。&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;一些角落——包括这本杂志，在&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/12/24/black-and-white-in-slave-play-and-to-kill- a-mockingbird&quot;>;我写的评论&lt;/a>;——哈里斯因其极其严谨的视野和独创性的声音而受到称赞。该剧的巨大成功是他现在享受许多奢侈品的先决条件：伦敦公寓、欧洲参与、他最近与 HBO 签署的为期两年的开发协议。与此同时，“奴隶游戏”是一种恶搞工作，其目的是让他所属的不同群体——种族、性别、制度、职业——感到不安，甚至可能激怒。哈里斯一定知道这部剧会产生这样的效果；他似乎陶醉于它所留下的混乱局面。甚至在大流行之前，他就已经赢得了“可怕的孩子”的名声，这种称号只有通过接近才能获得。你必须离大房子相当近才能考虑扔石头。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“我一直想知道什么时候我才能培养出受影响的黑人知识分子的声音，”哈里斯说那年夏天，依然滞留在伦敦。他正在反思一些他最喜欢的老一代作家和艺术家，以及他们的谈话和他们的作品一样努力风格化的方式。他一直在考虑&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1994/11/07/andre-leon-talley-vogue-the-only-one&quot;>;André Leon Talley&lt;/a >;，这位时尚作家和编辑，其高调的措辞和巴洛克式的句法成为了他风格的标志，而且，这似乎是在以白人为主的环境中维护自己归属感的一种方式。去年去世的塔利和哈里斯一样，都是一位来自南方的高个子、奇怪的、爱说话的黑人。他与白人同事、老板和捐助者之间复杂的、有时甚至是痛苦的关系网与《奴隶游戏》中描绘的动态相一致，甚至可能影响了这一动态。哈里斯毫不掩饰地研究其他艺术家的角色。 “我对个人风格、人际关系和阶层非常感兴趣——如果不是阶层提升，那就是阶层交往，”他说。 “只是某些人轻快的声音。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;谈论那个声音——我不用问就知道哈里斯的意思——让我想到了我自己的声音，也许有点防御性。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>; “你有一点，”他说，证实了我大声说出的恐惧。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;不过，我们一致认为，我们粗壮的年龄组——哈里斯三十四岁——的声音很特别。哈里斯心目中的那种千禧一代黑人作家并不是那种会运用詹姆斯·鲍德温温文尔雅的串联句子的人。相反，这个假设的三十多岁的人，渴望展示流行文化的随和性和平等主义的谦逊，以及展示来之不易的言语敏锐度，会使用充满尖刻的“喜欢”和“嗯”的措辞，再加上一点声音炸裂，具有虚假自嘲色彩的微妙音调：具有高级学位的山谷女孩。&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot;

&lt;div >;&lt;p >;哈里斯以焦躁的男高音说话，机车的爆发与深思熟虑的停顿交替出现；他的声音明亮、微咸、温暖。他不断地谈论电影、戏剧、衣服和人们的身体。他的句子经常以“你看见了吗？”开头。或“你读过吗？”除非他已经从你的作品中知道你已经看过或读过它，以及你对它的看法，并准备好温和地争论。当他听到自己同意的事情时，他会鼓励地说“是”，但没有过多强调，从不说“是”。他经常使用的两个词是“表面上”和“精神病”。&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;哈里斯在弗吉尼亚州马丁斯维尔长大，那些以身体为生的人，其中许多人在工厂工作。他的说话方式使他与众不同。他的母亲维罗妮卡·法里什 (Veronica Farrish) 拒绝让家人与他使用儿语。他自学读书，很快就成为了那种过早不为所动的孩子，发现与老师交朋友比与同学交朋友更容易。哈里斯说，当哈里斯八岁的时候，他最喜欢的消遣之一就是与母亲交换关于琼贝妮特·拉姆齐（JonBenét Ramsey）的遭遇的理论，这位六岁的选美选手的谋杀案在九十年代末引起了小报的轰动：“我，就像，“好吧，我看了这份文件。” ”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;他早期对真实犯罪的兴趣短暂地让他相信他想成为一名律师——这是早熟健谈的人的备用愿望。但在参加中学制作的《窈窕淑女》后，他意识到自己可能只是想在电视上扮演一名律师。大约在同一时间，哈里斯意识到自己是同性恋，或者至少是不同的——这种差异是他还无法用言语表达的罕见情况。另一个不舒服的地方是他的家庭生活不稳定。直到九岁或十岁时，他才见到了自己的亲生父亲。他的母亲在哈里斯四岁时与另一个男人结婚，在哈里斯上中学时离婚，然后开始了另一段短暂的婚姻，嫁给了一名驻扎在当时的北卡罗来纳州布拉格堡的军人。哈里斯和他的母亲搬到那里并在一所新学校就读。 “我非常沮丧，”他说。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;哈里斯在私立基督教学校度过了童年的大部分时间，并得到了经济援助。结果，他适应了在一个主要富裕的白人环境中作为一个贫穷的黑人孩子所带来的令人不安的紧张感。然后，在十年级时，他获得了马丁斯维尔预科学校卡莱尔的奖学金。走廊里挂着每个毕业生的照片。哈里斯回忆道，直到九十年代中期，学校成立了一支篮球队，黑人面孔才开始出现在照片中。 “每个人都希望我打篮球，”哈里斯说。 “我当时想，不。我非常讨厌那样。我当时想，我永远不会那样做。”相反，他开始游泳和跳舞。他继续与老师交朋友的做法。 “坎迪斯和保拉在中学教书，”他回忆道，“放学后我会和他们一起喝咖啡，他们是我的朋友。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;此时，哈里斯决心成为一个演员。他参演了戏剧和音乐剧，并执导了莫伊塞斯·考夫曼的纪录片《拉勒米计划》，该剧讲述了怀俄明大学同性恋学生马修·谢泼德被杀的后果。他的咖啡馆朋友坎迪斯·欧文·威廉姆斯（Candace Owen-Williams）在卡莱尔教授戏剧，他让他把学校后面的一辆空拖车改造成一个黑匣子剧院，他和其他一些朋友在那里上演实验节目。他的毕业论文是华莱士·肖恩 (Wallace Shawn) 的《狂热》(The Fever) 的一人制作。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;在大学期间，哈里斯 (Harris) 进入了芝加哥德保罗大学 (DePaul University) 的表演学院。该项目的结构很残酷：大一结束后，只有一半的学生被允许继续参加表演班；其他人则被裁掉，如果他们想留在学校，就必须选择不同的学习领域。哈里斯发现第一年——本质上是一场旷日持久的试镜——令人迷失方向。 “我的很多老师都说我的智力会妨碍我成为一名真正的演员，”他说。 “我总是会导演或重写场景的情况，以适应我想要玩的情感状态，使其对我来说更有趣。”他说，部分问题在于许多角色和场景都是针对白人演员的。但他内化了这样的信息：“如果你很聪明，你就必须隐藏它，”他说。 “我仍然坚持我的所有选择，”他补充道，“因为，在某些方面，我当时制作的剧院比现在制作的更酷。”为了进行“自动戏剧”练习，他在舞台上放置了二十盏不同形状和大小的灯。灯光是演出中唯一的光源。每一个都代表了一个与父亲形象相关的故事。当时和现在一样，哈里斯一直在寻找，有时甚至是找到一些掩盖的方式来描述他亲生父亲留下的缺席。在每道灯光的辉光中，他讲述了一段记忆的版本。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;第一学期结束后，哈里斯剪掉了长发，担心老师会如何看待他。第二年夏天，当该计划被削减时，他给他的朋友兼同学埃里卡·J·辛普森 (Erika J. Simpson) 打电话。两人都没有进去，安静了很长时间。&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt; div data-node-id=&quot;alua1&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid= “BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;那是六月——芝加哥的美好月份，但对于刚满十九岁的哈里斯来说，这是一个不确定时期的严峻开始。他打电话给他的一位老师询问他被解雇的原因；她说他要到三十多岁才能“成为一名演员”，并滔滔不绝地列出了一系列理由，对他来说，这些理由就像是“同性恋编码的狗屎”。他告诉我，“我们这一年有四个黑人男孩，被淘汰的两个是那些感觉最女性化的人。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;他开始收集《芝加哥读者》的问题&lt;em>;&lt; /em>;，一份免费的另类报纸，他在其页面上搜寻代理通知。在试镜时，他崩溃了，哭泣并颤抖。他向制片人解释了自己的情况——有些人去了德保罗；有些人去了德保罗；有些人去了德保罗。他们明白了——他们告诉他，他可以暂时走出房间，让自己平静下来，然后再试一次。相反，他只是离开了。&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;最终，哈里斯在城市的小场馆中获得了微薄的角色。他主修英语，并短暂地想象过写诗。他对艾未未的作品很感兴趣，艾未未是一位来自亚利桑那州的混血女性，她糟糕的成长经历让哈里斯想起了自己。艾未未于 2010 年去世，她的诗中充满了坚韧、狡猾、脆弱的工人阶级的声音，他们在冷漠且常常充满敌意的背景下维护自己的尊严，或者至少是某种时髦而巧妙的反抗。世界。 “你说你想要这个故事/用我自己的话来说，/但你不会按照我的方式讲述，”她的诗“&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/browse?volume=151&amp;amp ;issue=1&amp;amp;page=14&quot;>;采访警察&lt;/a>;”，从 1987 年开始。她的作品影响了哈里斯对独白可能性的理解。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;但是哈里斯并没有长期担任英语专业或德保罗大学的学生。他退学了，一年后搬到了洛杉矶。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;在第一个大流行夏天结束时，哈里斯和科斯拉维离开了伦敦的公寓，开着一辆装满他们东西的汽车环游欧洲。 。科斯拉维觉得自己被困在公寓里太久了，但哈里斯拒绝搬回美国，“这就是为什么和我约会太糟糕了，”他说。十月中旬，两人在意大利那不勒斯通过直播宣布了托尼提名。意大利已是傍晚时分。哈里斯与他的妈妈、侄女和侄子通过 FaceTime 通话，这样他就可以和他们一起观看。他不得不放弃大约四项提名，因为他妈妈正在观看的直播比他的要早，而且在他看到新闻之前她一直在尖叫。最终，《奴隶戏》获得了十二项提名，比以往任何非音乐作品的提名都要多。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;《奴隶戏》是一部真正困难的作品，是一次刻意的挑衅。在一场秀后问答中A.，一名白人妇女对哈里斯大喊，她“不想听到白人一直是他妈的问题”。一些黑人观众坚持认为该剧面向“白人凝视”，是对奴隶制和强奸相互交织的主题的愤世嫉俗的利用。这两股强烈反对的浪潮或多或少都是可以预见的。十几项提名似乎表明，哈里斯可以在戏剧界的客厅里发起一场食物大战，但仍然会被邀请坐在餐桌旁。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“这让我更有勇气更直率地表达我的观点以及如何我对这个世界有感觉，因为，如果我他妈的关心机构实际上对我说什么，那么获得十二项提名的《奴隶戏剧》就不会是获得十二项提名的《奴隶戏剧》，”他说。 “这将是一个更愚蠢的戏剧，一个不那么复杂的戏剧，一个不那么杰里米的戏剧。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;但这种机构的认可也提出了一种创造性的挑战。 “我认为我正在努力克服的事情是其他人对我的兴奋，去年我一直在努力解决这个问题，”哈里斯说。 “当我从‘这些人不够相信我’这样的地方写作时，我会更容易写作。”当我有东西要证明时，我可以写得更好。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;自从在洛杉矶工作以来，如果不是之前的话，哈里斯就已经将自己定义为与周围的人相对立——或者至少是那些与他有关系的人。力量。他最初并不是在专业场合，而是在更自由流动的深夜场景中取得了自己的成功。在芝加哥，他开始认识到自己的性格和体态是一种天赋。他身高六英尺五英寸，很有趣，很快乐。人们被他吸引并希望他参加他们的聚会。他在&lt;em>;AKIRA&lt;/em>;柳条公园的一家时尚女装精品店找到了一份工作，在那里他帮助客户寻找外出服装。通常，这些客户会邀请他去俱乐部。很快，他就成了夜生活中的常客。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“我是第一个会告诉你我讨厌同性恋酒吧的人，因为我在那里没有那么大的权力，”他告诉我。 “黑人、瘦骨嶙峋、魅力四射——在异性恋酒吧里，你比在同性恋酒吧里更有权力。我并没有威胁那里的直男。我也是夜总会的一个奇怪的蜜罐，因为所有这些有趣的女孩都想呆更长时间去闲逛，也想买更多的酒。”夜生活是一种翻腾的经济，对大多数人来说只是部分可见，是一个隐藏在面纱后面的系统。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;他在洛杉矶开辟了一个类似的空间，找到了一份白天的工作，在那里，那些很酷、有联系的人肯定会买衣服——这次是巴尼斯百货——并成为俱乐部的常客。他结交了一些朋友，其中一些是演艺界的朋友，他四处询问如何在这个行业找到自己的出路。他在聚会上交谈的人中有一些未来的重要合作者：作家兼导演萨姆·莱文森（Sam Levinson）、电影制片人贾尼扎·布拉沃（Janicza Bravo）。 “我认为我的语言能力帮助我驾驭这个领域，”他说。 “还有我的风格。我有良好到体面的风格。”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;哈里斯获得了小型表演机会：他主演了一部执导的短片由演员詹姆斯·弗兰科执导；他在泰伦斯·马利克的电影《Song to Song》中短暂露面。但他讨厌受到看门人的摆布，因为像他在德保罗的老师一样，他们可能会给他贴上不可铸造的标签。 2012 年春天，当莉娜·杜纳姆 (Lena Dunham) 的节目《女孩》在 HBO 首播时，他将她视为志趣相投的人，也是榜样。观看《都市女孩》时，他想，“这太完美了，而且我认为我能做到。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;就像邓纳姆一样，也像《大城》中的伊拉娜·格雷泽和艾比·雅各布森一样，这是另一个灵感来源—Harris 和他来自德保罗的朋友 Erika Simpson 制作了一个网络系列节目“#NightStrife”，并将其上传到 YouTube。 “这是两个二十多岁的年轻人试图出名，”辛普森在第一集中解释道。他们只制作了几集，并没有被广泛观看，尽管一个名为“黑人女孩拉屎”的半开玩笑的系列宣传片已经被观看了近八万次。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;哈里斯对好莱坞感到厌倦；他不再演戏，也不再称自己为演员。他开始称自己为剧作家，尽管他还没有写过剧本。他四处寻找想法，但没有成功，直到他与一位色情明星约会，他的故事为哈里斯的第一部戏剧“Xander Xyst，龙：1”提供了素材，这是一部以网络名人为主题的幻想曲。凭借这部由他在洛杉矶结识的另一位朋友《佛罗伦萨与机器》中的伊莎贝拉·萨默斯 (Isabella Summers) 创作的音乐，他赢得了 2014 年塞缪尔·法国外外百老汇短剧节的参赛资格。在那里，他遇到了一位一群与他同时代的年轻剧作家：威尔·阿伯里 (Will Arbery)、马丁娜·马约克 (Martyna Majok)、莉亚·纳纳科·温克勒 (Leah Nanako Winkler)、埃莉诺·伯吉斯 (Eleanor Burgess)。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;后来，他申请了麦克道尔艺术家驻地的奖学金，当他等待时-列出后，他每天都给政府打电话，直到有人告诉他可以。在麦克道尔，他遇到了剧作家艾米·赫尔佐格，艾米·赫尔佐格鼓励他申请耶鲁大学。他已经完成了《爸爸》的草稿，并将其连同一篇衷心的论文提交给了戏剧学校的招生委员会。 “我对童年最清晰的记忆是优雅地上演的，”他写道。 “它巧妙地移动到了电影和戏剧之间的境界：一扇打开的纱门通向一条宽阔的走廊，灯光亮起，我的母亲（30岁出头）在台下的一个房间里走到另一个房间，对着无绳电话低声尖酸刻薄，舞台外更远的地方，我们可以听到一个年轻女孩哭泣的声音，在舞台后面的侧面，我背靠背坐着（12），提着一个大手提箱，不时地向敞开的门外望去。 。 。 。突然，哭声停止了，取而代之的是“指针姐妹”，我母亲抱着我妹妹站在大厅中央，泪水、微笑和鼻涕在她脸上舞动，“他不会来了。”来吧宝贝，我们跳舞吧，”她说。所以我们做到了。”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot; 6a1t4b&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;哈里斯开始将《爸爸》视为一部通过寻求像耶鲁这样的机构可以提供的机会和资源来进一步发展自己的职业生涯的戏剧。 “去耶鲁大学是我决定嫁给山上的一个白人，以便有时间和空间来完成我的工作，”他 &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.ssense.com/ en-us/editorial/culture/oh-jeremy&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.ssense.com/en-us /editorial/culture/oh-jeremy&quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.ssense.com/en-us/editorial/culture/oh-jeremy&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;告诉&lt; /a>; 一名面试官。在其他地方，他&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vice.com/en/article/8qgm9g/decolonizing-my-desire&quot;>;描述&lt;/a>;这部剧是一次尝试“解析我被摇篮的方式” ，被白人机构宠爱和收集，以及我如何依次收集和使用它们。”他曾经写道，他睁着眼睛来到耶鲁大学，“相信我能从这个地方得到的比他们从我身上得到的更多。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;2021 年初，哈里斯仍然相当年轻的名声的要求终于得到满足叫他回纽约。 &lt;em>;城镇与Country 计划用多页跨页展示他新设计的家庭办公室，该办公室由别致的设计公司 Green River Project 提供家具。一月份一个寒冷、白镴天空的早晨，哈里斯坐在公司所有者之一亚伦·奥吉拉 (Aaron Aujla) 的工作室里，工作室位于布鲁克林一个不起眼的前仓库里，准备拍照。有人照顾他的头发，这始终是他为杂志封面和红地毯打造的造型中最受关注的点。工作室亮绿色的地板上散落着一簇簇羽毛般的小胡子。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“我想我只想要一个小胡子，”哈里斯说。他来拍摄时，手机里已经准备好了几张日本作家三岛由纪夫的照片。他拿出一张：三岛在他的办公室里，桌子后面，两侧是书，对着镜头凶狠地撅着嘴，黑眉毛扭动着。这位作家的颓废、隐约性感的目光确实带有某种孤独的小胡子的味道。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;哈里斯经常眨眨眼——尽管三岛由纪夫的政治观点是反动的——称三岛是他最喜欢的作家。几个月前，他在推特上写道：“好吧，伙计们，为了对抗季节性/流行性抑郁症，以及我的生活节奏我的身体无法跟上的感觉，我决定每天锻炼身体最喜欢的作家三岛由纪夫。他通过锻炼和失败的政变对抗抑郁和恐惧。” 1970 年，三岛由纪夫和他组建的民兵组织的几名成员试图接管日本的一个军事基地，希望煽动推翻该国宪法。在一番激烈的演讲后，沉迷于外表美和好战活力的三岛用剑自杀了。 “我讨厌法西斯吗？”哈里斯在另一条推文中写道。 “是的。我爱三岛吗？是的。我是双子座。可以坚持两个真理。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Aujla 缓慢地进出工作室，微笑着，没有多说什么。他的妻子是时装设计师 Emily Bode，她以针织男装而闻名。她和奥吉拉是哈里斯在唐人街的邻居，并成为了他的朋友。她带来了一架衣服供哈里斯挑选。偶尔，他会消失在窗帘后面，然后穿着流畅的裤子、蕾丝上衣或酒红色西装走出来，让人想起三岛由纪夫。 （他选择了这套西装作为他的服装之一。）当有什么东西让他发痒时，他让他的声音变得高亢，烟熏味十足的咯咯笑。 “这太糟糕了，”他有时会这样说。在更换服装的间隙，他聊起了最近的电影，尤其是一部新的成人独立电影，似乎每个人都喜欢，但他却无法观看。&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor= &quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;“阿凡德因此讨厌我，”哈里斯在谈到他的好莱坞执行男友时说道，“但我无法忍受这种狗屎。”他继续说道，“总是同样的事情：‘我在这里，边缘化的小孩——黑人、移民、同性恋，等等——这里是&lt;em>;广阔&lt;/em>;，&lt;em>;广阔的世界&lt;/em>;。 &#39;现在他正在表演原型，弯腰驼背，表现出孩子气的惊奇，眼睛睁得大大的，充满恐惧，双手紧握。 “现在有大麻烦了”——他恐惧地畏缩——“还有内心的冲突”——他焦急地颤抖着——“但是很快”——现在他的脸上露出了微笑——“我克服了。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>; “我一开始就知道这部电影会是什么，我当时想，不，谢谢，”他说。博德有着一张瘦削的脸，周围是两层黑发，说话的声音柔和而乐于助人，就像一位昂贵的治疗师的声音，她笑得脸变成粉红色。&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >; &lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;a data-event-click=&quot;{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/ cartoon/a27607&amp;quot;}&quot;

He edits the magazine &lt;em>;MATTE&lt;/em>;, makes photo books, and teaches workshops across the country. They met because of Harris&#39;s insistence, in New Haven, on spreading his presence far beyond the confines of the drama school: he was known to drop in on photography critique sessions and to speak up, offering references and suggestions. “A lot of people thought he was part of the photo program,” John Pilson, one of the program&#39;s longest-serving faculty members, said. “By the end, we all expected to see him every week.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Harris had arrived at Yale in 2016. Several of his classmates were far beyond him professionally: they&#39;d had shows produced, they had agents. He was eager to catch up, but soon found himself at odds with the institution. The curriculum was too conservative for his taste; he felt that his instructors were dismissive of his interest in more experimental work. He started taking classes in Black studies and poetry. He also began work on “Slave Play,” which he says “poured out” of him almost whole. He was assigned a faculty adviser, the acclaimed playwright and director &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/11/03/real-gone-girl&quot;>;Young Jean Lee&lt;/a>;, who would help shepherd a student production.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Lee is a longtime downtown experimentalist, and many of her work&#39;s subjects—race, class, the body—are also crucial to Harris; he was excited to work with her. But she had extensive notes on “Slave Play,” which Harris mostly declined to take. She objected strongly to the final act, set in the bedroom of a Black woman named Kaneisha and her white British husband, Jim. Their therapy has been a disaster, largely because of Jim&#39;s refusal to go along with goofily degrading role-play. Kaneisha calls Jim a “virus,” and connects their relationship to the brutalities of the past; Jim gets back into character, as a slave master, and gives Kaneisha the abasement she seems to have been asking for.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;This sequence, the most hotly debated part of “Slave Play,” stayed in the show, even after the move to Broadway. When Lee saw it in a dress rehearsal, she was horrified; later, she told Harris that it took her more than an hour to calm down enough to give him feedback. The two then exchanged lengthy text messages. “I hope that no one has ever spoken that violently to you about work that so deeply intersects with your being, and if they have I&#39;m sorry,” Harris wrote. Lee replied, “If you&#39;re that irresponsible about putting a rape of a female body onstage, I&#39;m going to call you out on it in no uncertain terms. To turn it around and call me the violent one is a classic move that has been done to me many times, and I&#39;ve never fallen for it, and I&#39;m not falling for it now.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Their dispute culminated in a formal complaint process, presided over by Tarell Alvin McCraney, who leads the drama school&#39;s playwriting program. Harris used transcripts from those meetings in “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.nplusonemag.com/issue-38/fiction-drama/yell-a-documentary-of-my-time-here/&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.nplusonemag.com/issue-38/fiction-drama/yell-a-documentary-of-my-time-here/&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nplusonemag.com/issue-38/fiction-drama/yell-a-documentary-of-my-time-here/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;Yell: A &#39;Documentary&#39; of My Time Here&lt;/a>;,” his senior thesis play. I went to see it, in New Haven, in 2019. By then, Harris had already staged “Slave Play” and “Daddy” Off Broadway, but he still had something to prove to his teachers. The most constant formal structure in “Yell” is repeated acts of onstage defecation. Fake shit was everywhere at Yale&#39;s Iseman Theatre that day.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;frvuov&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Harris has said that “Yell” was inspired by the radical 1967 essay “The Student as Nigger,” by Jerry Farber, which compares the relationship between American students and their professors to that of slaves and masters. In June, 2020, at the height of the George Floyd protests, Harris shared “Yell” online, and wrote a long accompanying Twitter &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://twitter.com/jeremyoharris/status/1270447515570233350&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://twitter.com/jeremyoharris/status/1270447515570233350&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jeremyoharris/status/1270447515570233350&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;thread&lt;/a>; in which he posted screenshots of his text exchange with Lee, who declined to comment for this story. “EVERY DAY THEY TREATED ME LIKE A NIGGA THAT NEEDED TO BE TAMED AND IT MADE ME FEEL CRAZY,” he wrote.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In September, 2021, Harris sat in a chair in a bathroom at a ritzy hotel in New York. The Tonys were finally being awarded that night, and he&#39;d booked a suite nearby, where he could get ready. Also in the bathroom were his hairdresser, Latisha Chong, and a woman tending to his makeup and nails. He sat stock-still, never wincing as Chong pulled through his Afro and started to braid. The three of them, mutually devoted to the task of flashy beauty, calmly chatted about people they knew in common.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Everybody who knows him thinks he&#39;s gay,” Harris said. “But, I&#39;m telling you, he&#39;s straight.” Both women disbelievingly harrumphed. “Bone straight,” he said.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;The bathroom was a center of calm in the otherwise hectic suite. Harris occasionally got up to take a Polaroid of the room—an editor at &lt;em>;Vogue&lt;/em>; had commissioned him to keep a photo diary. Also milling around were two camerapeople shooting footage for a “Slave Play” documentary that Harris had promised to deliver to HBO. They swanned around the room, sometimes going out on the balcony to capture views of downtown and the West Side. Beyond and between the buildings, you could see the Hudson quietly snaking along.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Harris&#39;s assistant kept running out of the room, collecting bouquets of flowers and other gifts that were arriving in a steady stream. Harris had recently interviewed the young gay rapper Lil Nas X for a &lt;em>;GQ&lt;/em>; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gq.com/story/lil-nas-x-musician-of-the-year-2021&quot;>;profile&lt;/a>;. “Montero—he&#39;s brilliant,” he said, using the rapper&#39;s given name. “The interview felt kind of like a first date.” He asked his assistant to put on a song from Lil Nas X&#39;s new album, a catchy single called “Industry Baby.” “This one is gonna be huge,” Harris said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Friends continually appeared, at his invitation. His mother and niece were getting their makeup done in a neighboring room. Candace Owen-Williams, his old teacher, was there, too, in a sparkly gown. Harris pointed her out to each new arrival and repeated the story of how she made him feel less alone at school.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;This is how Harris relaxes—sitting somewhere near the center of a crowd that he&#39;s convened. Antwaun Sargent, an art critic and a gallerist with Gagosian, walked over to the ledge where Harris&#39;s gold accessories, custom-made for him by the haute-couture house Schiaparelli, sat gleaming. There were chunky rings and cufflinks, a necklace with a pendant made from a cast of Harris&#39;s ear, a “Phantom of the Opera”-style mask modelled after a swooping section of his face.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;As the sun began to set and the light in the room darkened, Harris asked everyone to leave so that he could ready himself for the show. That night, in a surprise to prognosticators, “Slave Play” was completely shut out—twelve nominations, nothing to bring home. The next day, the online edition of Page Six carried the headline “Jeremy O. Harris celebrates Tony snubs with two afterparties.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Early last year, Harris tweeted a casual swipe at the state of television. “I write tv for people who have an intellect for theatre since tv is hollow,” he wrote. “Bc the funny thing is the reason so many filmmakers and theatre makers were asked to make television is bc the medium hit a wall. That&#39;s why almost all the best tv, of late, has been made by exciting practitioners of other forms.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Stung TV writers and irritated critics noted that Harris now made much of his living from television, and not always in its most rarefied corners. In 2021, he&#39;d done a cameo, as himself, on the reboot of “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2008/03/10/advanced-placement&quot;>;Gossip Girl&lt;/a>;.” (The script called for a play within the show, which Harris wrote; later, he got it commissioned by the Public Theatre.) Then he was cast, as a fashion designer, in the second season of “Emily in Paris,” Darren Starr&#39;s critically maligned Netflix series about an American influencer who gets a job in France. The show&#39;s producers told Harris that they were looking for someone reminiscent of a young André Leon Talley.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Sharper observers of Harris&#39;s commentary noticed that he was playing a familiar role. “I support Jeremy O Harris being snotty about TV,” the &lt;em>;Times&lt;/em>; critic Jason Zinoman wrote. “Playwrights used to be like this all the time. It&#39;s a glorious tradition.” The path from New York theatre to a career in Hollywood—where the money and the weather are better, and the audiences are bigger—has been traversed by writers for almost a century. And Harris seemed to be giving television a dose of his usual medicine: let me in and I&#39;ll give you a piece of my mind.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;But on his winding path to playwriting, Harris had made the kinds of friends you would make if you were aiming for the screen all along. When Harris was still at Yale, Sam Levinson made him a consultant for his notoriously lurid HBO teen drama “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/on-television/the-addictive-chills-and-thrills-of-euphoria&quot;>;Euphoria&lt;/a>;.” (Harris is now a producer on the series.) Janicza Bravo got Harris hired as the co-writer for her movie “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-front-row/zola-reviewed-a-twitter-thread-takes-an-ingenious-and-audacious-cinematic-form&quot;>;Zola&lt;/a>;,” adapted from a riotous series of tweets.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;His steadiest Hollywood employment came in the form of the HBO deal that he signed in 2020. The following year, the network announced that he would adapt the novel “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Vanishing-Half-Novel-Brit-Bennett/dp/0525536965&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Vanishing-Half-Novel-Brit-Bennett/dp/0525536965&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Vanishing-Half-Novel-Brit-Bennett/dp/0525536965&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;The Vanishing Half&lt;/a>;,” by Brit Bennett, along with the playwright Aziza Barnes, a friend of his. The novel tells the story of twin sisters whose fates diverge: one dissolves into the American mainstream, passing as white; the other anchors herself in Black community. Harris and Barnes assembled a writers&#39; room to produce a pilot and a “show bible,” outlining the plot of the first season. They led the writers on a research trip to New Orleans, where much of “The Vanishing Half” is set. As the weeks passed, Harris was often airborne, travelling to fashion gigs, conducting interviews for magazines. When he signed the HBO deal, he&#39;d insisted that his contract contain an annual fund for supporting theatre, and he&#39;d used some of that money to create a fellowship for emerging writers. He was always &lt;em>;working&lt;/em>;. He just wasn&#39;t always writing.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Then, the following June, the Daily Beast &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thedailybeast.com/jeremy-o-harris-let-go-from-hbos-the-vanishing-half&quot;>;reported&lt;/a>; that Harris and Barnes were no longer working on the show. The article cited two sources who claimed that Harris “was let go after having trouble meeting script deadlines.” HBO insisted that he had not been fired. There had simply been creative differences, which were “part of the normal development process.” Harris, HBO added, “is a valued collaborator, and we currently have other projects in development with him.” (He is no longer on an exclusive deal with HBO but continues to work with the network.)&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I visited Harris, at his apartment, a couple of weeks later. It was a bright July day, hot in the sun but buoyed by a breeze. He answered the door wearing a long green terry-cloth robe, with dark polish on his fingernails. His young nephew had been wanting to paint his nails and was getting grief about it in his Southern milieu, Harris said, so he had painted his in solidarity. “Sometimes I think people don&#39;t want him to be a &#39;punk&#39; like Uncle Jeremy,” he said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The Daily Beast hadn&#39;t reported any details about Harris&#39;s approach to the “Vanishing Half” adaptation, but I had heard, from several friends, about a proposed scene in which a lot of feces is flung around. It sounded preposterous but not entirely unlikely. Harris, in his work, likes to explain drastic external action by way of uncomfortable, abject, and often lewd interior depths. His characters earn their brief glories after trudging through lots of shame; his people get splattered.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Harris seemed surprised that I&#39;d heard about the scene in such detail, but was happy to discuss it. He loved Bennett&#39;s book, but wanted to interpret it freely, even radically, something TV writers don&#39;t do enough, he said. One addition he and the writers envisioned was a surrealistic quasi-dream sequence that would send a character&#39;s consciousness “skipping like a stone across the waters of time,” as Harris put it in the show bible. The character would witness a “depraved ritual” meant to cleanse a small town of its communal sins, and the dark bacchanal would include “blackface masks, buffoonery and flying mud and feces.” It would end with “infidelities, thefts and dark family secrets ushered from the shadows into the light.”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;fcy98w&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Harris was less annoyed by people gossiping about his work than by the suggestion, in the Daily Beast and elsewhere, that he wasn&#39;t a hard worker. “I&#39;m actually really insecure about that,” he said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;He was about to go abroad, and he wanted a new swimsuit for the summer trip; he&#39;d asked Emily Bode to design one for him. We walked to her small tailoring shop in Chinatown, where a board high up on a brownish wall announced the prices for alterations. Half-done garments hung on faceless mannequins.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;A tailor silently took Harris&#39;s measurements, then gave him the swimsuit that Bode had left for him to try on: a lime-green one-piece with thin tank-top straps and tight shorts. He had seemed sedate and almost tired in the apartment, but now his mood lifted. He retreated behind a curtain, then came out wearing the suit, hugging his thin body. It fit. He looked into a mirror and spread his arms. He was already smiling.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;One night last October, Harris went to the Brooklyn Academy of Music to see the renowned Belgian theatre director Ivo van Hove&#39;s adaptation of the novel “A Little Life,” by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/01/17/hanya-yanagiharas-audience-of-one&quot;>;Hanya Yanagihara&lt;/a>;. Harris is friendly with Yanagihara—he&#39;d spoken with her about acting in a possible TV adaptation of the book. He attended the play with an old roommate from his Yale days, Michael Breslin, who co-founded the theatre collective Fake Friends. Harris has co-produced two of the collective&#39;s shows: “Circle Jerk,” a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize for drama, and “This American Wife,” a harrowing parody of Bravo&#39;s “Real Housewives” franchise.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“A Little Life” centers on a group of friends in New York, one of whom, a saintly character named Jude, is repeatedly flayed by acts of unspeakable violence. Like “Slave Play,” the novel was dogged by accusations of sadism. After the show, Harris, who has cited the Marquis de Sade as a formative influence, chatted with his friends. They all agreed that some of the show&#39;s most excruciating scenes, which had provoked gasps in the audience, could have been, in keeping with the book, a bit more graphic.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Harris took a car home, stopping for a drink at a bar near his apartment. Writers—a species always overrunning those blocks, which have come to be called Dimes Square—spilled out of restaurants and sidewalk sheds. For a few minutes, cradling his drink, Harris argued amiably with a pop-music critic about the recently released movie “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-front-row/tar-reviewed-regressive-ideas-to-match-regressive-aesthetics&quot;>;Tár&lt;/a>;,” which Harris hated.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Back at his apartment, he ate and paced and talked—softly, because a friend, one in a rotating series of medium-term guests, was sleeping in the next room. Soon, Khosravi came home. Like Harris, he is tall and slender and demonstrative; subtle streaks of gray run through the ringlets of his hair. Unlike Harris, he seldom seems excited to argue. Before Khosravi, Harris had a boyfriend who broke up with him in part, Harris says, because of his sudden fame. “Arvand doesn&#39;t mind that I&#39;m a star,” he once told me.&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;a data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a24982&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a24982&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;“Take care out there today hon.

They were flying in the morning to a gala in Bentonville, Arkansas, at the Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art. Harris didn&#39;t seem stressed.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The next day, at the museum, as Harris wandered a room with paintings by Kehinde Wiley, Amy Sherald, and Kerry James Marshall, Khosravi surprised him by getting on one knee and proposing marriage. He&#39;d had a ring designed by a pair of jewellers who lived across the street from them in London and had become their friends. And he&#39;d asked the playwright &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/02/12/adrienne-kennedys-startling-body-of-work&quot;>;Adrienne Kennedy&lt;/a>;—a hero of Harris&#39;s, and now a frequent e-mail correspondent of his—to write a benediction, to be etched on the inside. It reads, “Happiness. Is. To me. Greatest Thing.” Harris said yes.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;A day later, he giddily recounted the proposal on Twitter, adding a pinch of social critique. “But someone, I guess I will?, needs to write about how cringe it is to be proposed to when you haven&#39;t been socialized to be waiting for it,” he wrote. “It&#39;s a really violent trap we set for both parties where you&#39;re asked to be in a play you know the script to and if you deviate from it 💔.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Harris&#39;s doomsaying in 2020—his sense that the gatekeepers were not doing enough to reimagine and thus preserve the world of theatre—has arguably been validated, in the worst way, in the three years since then. A wave of closures and layoffs has prompted a rash of op-eds about the future of the medium. Harris, as contrarian as ever, is not abandoning the theatre but, rather, becoming something of a gatekeeper himself: he has lately been, almost above all else, a facilitator of other people&#39;s work.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;He is currently the presiding playwright for the Yale Drama Series, a role that involves judging the program&#39;s annual prize. After he took the position, last year, he began conceiving a writers&#39; retreat for some of the prize&#39;s finalists—inspired, in part, by his experience at MacDowell. In March, he announced the inaugural Substratum fellows: four young playwrights who would spend a month at a medieval house, part of the hotel Monteverdi Tuscany, which, along with Gucci, would help cover the expenses.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;He was in Italy with the fellows when he got a text from the actress Rachel Brosnahan, who, along with Oscar Isaac, was starring in a revival of Lorraine Hansberry&#39;s 1964 play “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/03/13/sign-in-sidney-brusteins-window-theatre-review&quot;>;The Sign in Sidney Brustein&#39;s Window&lt;/a>;,” at &lt;em >;BAM&lt;/em>;. She hoped he&#39;d come see it. He said he was abroad, and asked if the play might be extended or transferred; she didn&#39;t think so. “I&#39;m going to get you to Broadway,” he replied. He phoned producer friends, and together they engineered a brief transfer to the James Earl Jones Theatre—another play set to open there had seen its financing collapse. The Hansberry revival wouldn&#39;t run long enough to turn a profit, but it would get a wider audience for a work by another of Harris&#39;s playwriting heroes. And the quick transfer suggested a different approach, perhaps, for Broadway: If space opens up, why not take a few chances?&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In August, Harris went to the Berkshires to spend two weeks acting in a movie directed by Pete Ohs, who edited the “Slave Play” documentary. Ohs makes largely improvised movies for twenty thousand dollars or less; the tiny budget meant that he could shoot without breaking the rules of the Writers Guild of America strike, which had begun in the spring and showed no signs of ending. The film was a country-house nightmare about contracting disease from deer ticks.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;The cast was staying at the house, which belonged to the actress Callie Hernandez, one of Ohs&#39;s collaborators. In the brightness of the afternoon, a wall of trees outside was variously green: dark pine, mild maple, vivid oak. Inside, James Cusati-Moyer, who was in “Slave Play”—his character, a gay man, refuses to describe himself as white—stood at the kitchen counter, mixing flaxseed, honey, psyllium husk, and cranberries in a steel bowl. He was making gluten-free bread, from a TikTok recipe. “You want a kind of cakey texture,” he said. “The woman in the video is incredibly annoying, but the bread is great.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The movie would begin shooting that night. Harris changed into a white linen caftan and went into town for groceries—he&#39;d volunteered to make dinner, for the second day in a row. He drives with a country boy&#39;s ease; he learned at fourteen, when his mother realized how impossible it would be for her to chauffeur him to all of his activities. He&#39;d already acclimated somewhat to the roads of the Berkshires and to the local lore. “Birthplace of WEB DuBois,” he said. “They can&#39;t shut up about it—he&#39;s, like, the only Black guy they know.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Loping through the aisles at the grocery store, he picked up ears of corn with stringy husks and a pack of what he called “white-people aluminum foil,” packaged in a recyclable-looking brown paper box. He&#39;d begun writing a novel about a Black writer beset by deadlines and grief. Harris was very close with his mother&#39;s parents, who have both died in the past few years—his grandfather, Golden, died two weeks before “Slave Play” débuted on Broadway. “Writing isn&#39;t fun,” he said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;At lunch, in a small bakery across the street from a general store, he told me that his cash flow was slowing down as a result of the strike. “The other day, my niece asked me for a new phone, and I had to say no,” he said. “I told her, &#39;I&#39;m not trying to be mean—I&#39;m broke.&#39; ” He pays private-school tuition for her and his nephew; he bought a home, in Virginia, for his mom. He was worried about falling behind on payments.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;tls7&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Back at the house, he enlisted his castmates as sous-chefs—chopping herbs, buttering corn—and began to cook. People were trying on clothes and critiquing the outfits. Would this work for the character? What else did it need? Cusati-Moyer was in a loose crop top. Harris loved it.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“I feel bloated from the bread,” Cusati-Moyer said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“You are,” Harris said, grinning.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“This is what he was like,” Cusati-Moyer told the others. “He builds you up and then he breaks you back down!”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Harris called his mom to ask her advice on the meal—pork chops, roasted corn, fried apples, all callbacks to his childhood. Should he melt the butter, put the apples in the cast iron, and &lt;em>;then&lt;/em>; pour the sugar in?&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“I don&#39;t know if you know this,” he told her, “but there&#39;s a white way to make this, where you don&#39;t just pour sugar.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Yeah, well, we make it the Black way,” his mom said. They talked about Harris&#39;s niece, and about the patterns his mom had begun to notice in her romantic life, and about literature. They sounded like siblings who take turns being in control.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;She said that she wanted to write a book about her life. “The best way to write is to read really good things,” Harris said. “You have to read this book by a French woman named &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/11/21/annie-ernaux-turns-memory-into-art&quot;>;Annie Ernaux&lt;/a>;. &#39;Happening.&#39; You&#39;ll really like it.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;He sat in the kitchen, with food in the oven and on the stove, steeling himself quietly for work later on, chatting with his mother. For a moment, his life seemed almost normal. ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot;

The family ranch occupied a hard, dry, largely featureless corner of north-central Texas, and was perched on a rise known as Idiot Ridge. McMurtry&#39;s three siblings appeared better adapted to their environment—one of his sisters was named rodeo queen; his brother cowboyed for a while—but Larry, the eldest, was afraid of shrubbery, and of poultry. His father, Jeff Mac, ran hundreds of cows, which he knew individually, by their markings; Larry&#39;s eyesight was so poor that he had a hard time spotting a herd on the horizon. When his cowboy uncles were young, they sat on the roof of a barn and watched the last cattle drives set out on the long trek north. McMurtry lay under the ranch-house roof and listened to the hum of the highway, as eighteen-wheelers headed toward Fort Worth, Dallas, or beyond—anywhere bigger, and far away. Many years later, the London-born Simon &amp;amp; Schuster editor Michael Korda, a rodeo enthusiast, wore a Stetson and a bolo tie to his first meeting with McMurtry. He was surprised, and perhaps a bit disappointed, to find the young writer dressed “like a graduate student,” in slacks and a sports coat. “He did not share my enthusiasm for horses, either,” Korda recalled.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The mismatch between a glamorized West and the grimmer, starker reality was McMurtry&#39;s great subject across the dozens of novels, nonfiction books, and screenplays that he wrote or co-wrote before his death, at eighty-four, in 2021, from congestive heart failure. In “Larry McMurtry: A Life,” a new biography by Tracy Daugherty, the author of well-received books about Joseph Heller, Joan Didion, and Donald Barthelme, McMurtry emerges as a perpetually ambivalent figure, one who eventually became a part of the mythology that he insisted he was attempting to dismantle.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Although McMurtry spent decades living in Washington, DC, and Tucson, and wrote books set in Los Angeles and Las Vegas, he was always conscious of himself as a Texas writer. It was an identity imposed from both without and within; some part of McMurtry always remained stuck on Idiot Ridge, looking out toward the horizon. In his early thirties, with a handful of novels to his name, he published an essay condemning the state of Texas letters as woefully backward. More than a decade later, he wrote another, even harsher assessment, claiming that “Texas has produced no major writers or major books.” But even McMurtry&#39;s repudiations have a funny way of reaffirming Texas chauvinism. (“One must ask: What has Nevada done for literature lately? Who&#39;s the Alaskan Tennyson?” Barthelme wrote, for &lt;em>;Texas Monthly&lt;/em>;, in an archly mocking response to McMurtry&#39;s later essay. “We&#39;ve done at least as well as Rhode Island, we&#39;re pushing Wyoming to the wall.”) With “Lonesome Dove,” the best-selling cattle-drive epic that won him a Pulitzer in 1986, McMurtry believed that he had written a book “permeated with criticism of the West from start to finish.” Instead, it reinvigorated the Western as a genre. Daugherty quotes the late Don Graham, who was a professor of English at the University of Texas at Austin: “ &#39;The Godfather&#39; was supposed to de-mythologize the mob, too, but we all wanted to be gangsters after we saw it, right?”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;GenericCallout&quot;>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;external-link-embed--inline&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;a aria-label=&quot;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;The Best Books We Read This Week&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.newyorker.com/best-books-2023&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/best-books-2023&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;&lt;span >;&lt;strong>;The Best Books We Read This Week&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/a>;&lt;p >;&lt;em>;Read our reviews of notable new fiction and nonfiction, updated every Wednesday.&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;a aria-label=&quot;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;The Best Books We Read This Week&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.newyorker.com/best-books-2023&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/best-books-2023&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/63c800e4e99d89b838ada996/1:1/w_200%2Cc_limit/undefined&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/63c800e4e99d89b838ada996/1:1/w_120,c_limit/undefined 120w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/a>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;McMurtry was born in 1936, into a way of life that was already on its way out. Small-scale cattle ranching was a dying industry, one that McMurtry missed out on “only by the width of a generation,” he wrote, and “as I was growing up, heard the whistle of its departure.” His father was a stoic man who thought that ice water was an indulgence; his mother, Hazel, was cripplingly fearful. The family was in thrall to Jeff Mac&#39;s parents—among the first white people to settle in Archer County—who seemed to expect subsequent generations to double down on their sacrifice. From a young age, McMurtry sensed that this was a bad bargain. His uncles lived in broken bodies, sustaining themselves on remembered, or imagined, glory days—they were brilliant storytellers but also cautionary tales. Drought, urbanization, and oil were reshaping the Texas economy. Corporate operations were squeezing out small farms, and cowboys were moving to the suburbs. But being a McMurtry meant sticking with an enterprise long after it made sense. One uncle, debilitated by age and hard living, took to tying himself to his horse with baling wire—a “lunatic thing to do considering the roughness of the country and the temperament of most of the horses he rode,” McMurtry wrote. Any mourning for a lost era was tempered by McMurtry&#39;s understanding that the good old days were never that good to begin with. His characters are often uneasy in the present moment, filled with a longing for something that they can&#39;t quite name.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;When McMurtry was a second grader, the family moved to Archer City, a one-stoplight town about eighteen miles from the ranch. In high school, he was an officer in the 4-H club, a trombone player in the band, and the third-tallest member of a basketball team that once lost a game 106–4. Even though he grew up in a largely bookless town, “reading very quickly came to seem what I was meant to do,” McMurtry wrote. The few books that he got his hands on assumed an almost totemic importance: Grosset &amp;amp; Dunlap pulps, inherited from a cousin going off to war; a truck-flattened history of the Creeks, found in the parking lot of a livestock auction. “I shall almost certainly make some weird combination of writer-rancher-professor out of myself,” he wrote in his application essay to North Texas State. He wasn&#39;t yet twenty-one years old and had already amassed a library of six hundred volumes. (McMurtry&#39;s collecting was not a purely intellectual enterprise; he eventually amassed enough vintage pornography to fill a small room.)&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;As a Stegner Fellow at Stanford University, McMurtry supplemented his stipend by buying and selling used books; meanwhile, his friend and classmate Ken Kesey made extra money being dosed with LSD for scientific experiments. The sixties were kicking up, and McMurtry toggled between working on an anonymous radical publication and writing stories about stolid, repressed cattle ranchers. The youth culture in evidence in his early novels is distinctly Texan and rural (and white): Cadillacs and roughnecks, Hank Williams songs on the jukebox at the pool hall, aimless drives down empty streets. In McMurtry&#39;s depictions of small-town America in the fifties, there&#39;s little to be nostalgic for, apart from the jukeboxes—life is cramped and strangled, suffused with boredom that threatens to tip into menace. Violent impulses are enacted on women, animals, and weaker boys. In “The Last Picture Show,” from 1966, teen-agers gleefully rape a “skinny, quivering” blind heifer whose “frightened breath raised little puffs of dust from the sandy lot.” “To Mom and Daddy,” McMurtry wrote in a copy of the novel he sent to his parents. “You probably won&#39;t like it. Love, Larry.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;McMurtry&#39;s novels translated well to the movies, where the sweep of the settings helped to mute the stories&#39; cynicism. His first novel, “Horseman, Pass By” became “Hud,” starring a callous, smoldering Paul Newman; “The Last Picture Show,” according to Daugherty, sold nine hundred copies in hardcover upon its initial printing, but Peter Bogdanovich&#39;s 1971 film became an immediate sensation, winning two Oscars. (The heifer-rape scene did not make it into the movie.) McMurtry&#39;s home town was already wary of him, and the scandal-plagued filming of “The Last Picture Show” didn&#39;t improve his local reputation. (Bogdanovich&#39;s marriage to his wife and collaborator, Polly Platt, collapsed after he began an on-set affair with the film&#39;s twenty-year-old star, Cybill Shepherd.) The &lt;em>;Archer County News&lt;/em>; ran an angry letter about “the further degradation and decay of the morals and attitudes we foist upon our youth in this county”; according to Daugherty, McMurtry, incensed by such attacks, responded by challenging his fellow-citizens to a public debate about the town&#39;s true nature. Around that time, he decided that the future of Texas, and Texas writing, was urban, and he went on to write a suite of novels featuring graduate students, entertaining but uneven books that swing from slapstick to pathos. McMurtry was particularly good at capturing the charms of Houston—steamy, dank, violent, fun.&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;When Daugherty told the art critic Dave Hickey that he was writing a book about McMurtry, Hickey replied, “Knowing Larry, it&#39;s going to be a real episodic book.” McMurtry was an inveterate road tripper who collected friends like he collected books, and Daugherty&#39;s biography is full of entertaining cameos: McMurtry hosts Kesey&#39;s bus of zonked-out Merry Pranksters, dines on caviar with Susan Sontag, goes flea-market shopping with Diane Keaton, and attends a state dinner for Prince Charles and Princess Diana hosted by Ronald Reagan. But the anecdotes, many of them drawn from McMurtry&#39;s own writing about his life, can feel like a shield. A deeper sense of McMurtry remains elusive throughout the biography; he comes across as a hard man to get to know well. (In “Pastures of the Empty Page: Fellow Writers on the Life and Legacy of Larry McMurtry,” edited by the writer George Getschow, the difficulty of approaching and engaging with McMurtry is a recurrent theme.)&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;McMurtry was often lauded for his skill at writing female characters, which seems to boil down to the simple fact that he found women interesting, and not merely in terms of their relationships with men. In McMurtry&#39;s books, characters who don&#39;t get what they want tend to have the richest interiority. His female characters, less able to force their environments to conform to their egos, tend to see the world more clearly. In “Terms of Endearment,” men are either underwhelming or comic. The novel is more interested in relationships among a constellation of women: Emma Horton, a young mother with unrealized literary ambitions; her friend Patsy; her vexing, charismatic mother, Aurora; and Aurora&#39;s put-upon housekeeper, Rosie. When Emma is dying, Aurora and Patsy circle her hospital bed, discussing her children&#39;s futures. Flap, Emma&#39;s husband, “was there too,” but “he was not relevant.”&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;a data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a27864-rd&amp;quot;}&quot;

After an early marriage and divorce, he embarked on a series of long-running, overlapping, ambiguously intimate friendships with a number of women, including Keaton and the novelist Leslie Marmon Silko; he managed to come away from the filming of “The Last Picture Show” close to both Platt and Shepherd. McMurtry spoke with his female friends regularly on the phone, wrote them letters, brought them flowers, and slept with some of them. Having raised his son, James, more or less on his own, he seemed to have an appreciation for single mothers. “He was, physically, one of the least attractive men imaginable, but as a friend he was everything I wanted,” Shepherd wrote in her memoir. “A renaissance cowboy, an earthy intellectual, a Pulitzer Prize winner who could take pleasure in a dive that served two-dollar tacos.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Even as McMurtry urged other Texas writers to root their stories in the present, and in cities—“Why are there still cows to be milked and chickens to be fed in every other Texas book that comes along? When is enough going to be enough?”—he was working on his nineteenth-century cattle-drive epic. “Lonesome Dove” originated as an idea for a screenplay, tossed around by Bogdanovich and McMurtry after the success of “The Last Picture Show.” The plan was to cast John Wayne, Jimmy Stewart, and Henry Fonda in a story about aging cowboys. “I said it needed to be a trek: They start somewhere, they go somewhere,” Bogdanovich recalled, years later. “He said we might as well start at the Rio Grande and go north.” One of the characters would be called Augustus, they decided, because they enjoyed imagining how Stewart would pronounce the name. The film never worked out; according to McMurtry, Stewart and Fonda weren&#39;t keen on their last cowboy movie being “a dim moral victory.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;A decade later, McMurtry repurposed the material into a novel about a group of men, led by the ex-Texas Rangers Augustus McCrae and Woodrow Call, who become the first people to drive a herd of cattle from Texas to Montana. The cattle drive proved to be an ideal subject for McMurtry. Though he never seemed much interested in plot architecture, he was an excellent writer of episodes; along the trail, the Hat Creek outfit is beset by locusts, bandits, and all manner of weather. Years earlier, McMurtry&#39;s novel “All My Friends Are Going to Be Strangers” had portrayed a pair of Texas Rangers as violent buffoons. In “Lonesome Dove,” Call and McCrae are essentially noble, if emotionally stunted.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;el1uw&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;ihn2ap&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Despite McMurtry&#39;s evident affection for the characters, there&#39;s a pervasive sense of something sour about their quest. In the novel&#39;s first major set piece, the crew carries out a nighttime raid across the Rio Grande into Mexico to steal a herd of horses to take on the northward journey. “Evidently, if you crossed the river to do it, it stopped being a crime and became a game,” a teen-age apprentice learns; the more seasoned hands accept the robbery as a matter of course. This initial crime echoes a more shameful and consequential theft that reverberates throughout the novel: white settlers&#39; expropriation of the Great Plains and the attempted eradication of their Indigenous inhabitants. The novel is haunted by the aftereffects of those actions: a small band of starving Native Americans, slaughtering horses for food; an old man with a dirty beard pushing a wheelbarrow of buffalo bones across the high plains. Viewed from the ground, the cattle drive is thrilling, but seen from any greater distance it&#39;s devastating. McCrae, the novel&#39;s romantic cynic, periodically lays bare what all the episodic heroism has been for: “That&#39;s what we done, you know. Kilt the dern Indians so they wouldn&#39;t bother the bankers.” McMurtry well knew the ecological devastation wrought by the expansion of the cattle industry, and the fact that it contained the seeds of its own collapse. Overgrazing degraded the rangelands, and mesquite and creosote bushes crowded out native grasses. Just a few generations after the events of “Lonesome Dove,” McMurtry&#39;s father was embroiled in an endless, futile war to eradicate mesquite from his ranch. “We killed the right animal, the buffalo, and brought in the wrong animal, wetland cattle. And it didn&#39;t work,” McMurtry said in 2010.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Lonesome Dove” is a deeply ambivalent book, though, to McMurtry&#39;s chagrin, it wasn&#39;t always recognized as such. Adapted into a beloved 1989 miniseries, starring Robert Duvall and Tommy Lee Jones as McCrae and Call, it further established the ex-Rangers as sentimental heroes. McMurtry began comparing his most popular book to “Gone with the Wind”; he didn&#39;t mean it as a compliment. Still, he went on to write sequels and prequels, spinning out an extended universe that was, on the whole, more rote and less complex than the original.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;For all his mixed feelings about “Lonesome Dove,” McMurtry appreciated the rewards that the book and other projects brought him. “Movie money is just the kind of unreal money I like to spend,” he once wrote to his agent. On road trips, in rented Cadillacs, he sent his dirty clothes home via FedEx; he became such a regular at Petrossian, the caviar spot in midtown Manhattan, that the restaurant installed a brass plaque with his name at his favorite table. But his biggest indulgence was books. As independent bookstores across the country closed, McMurtry bought up their stock and moved it to Archer City, where he was busy converting downtown buildings into bookstores. “Leaving a million or so in Archer City is as good a legacy as I can think of for that region and indeed for the West,” McMurtry wrote. The town, having endured a major oil bust, was at last ready to embrace its wayward son. Visitors to Archer City could now stay at the Lonesome Dove Inn and pay their respects to a small McMurtry shrine at the Dairy Queen. When Sontag came to visit, she told McMurtry that it seemed as though he was living inside his own theme park.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The final third of Daugherty&#39;s book makes for bleak reading. McMurtry had a heart attack in 1991, and quadruple-bypass surgery left him feeling “largely posthumous,” as he put it, a condition from which he seems to have never fully recovered. His closest partnership around this time was with Diana Ossana, a Tucson paralegal. Daugherty is never quite able to explain the nature of their relationship—was she his girlfriend, his friend, his writing partner, his manager, or some combination of all four? Whatever their dynamic, Ossana was a key source of support. During the worst of his post-surgery years, a period when McMurtry was suffering from depression, he lived with her. For a while, he still approached writing as if it were farm chores, something to be tackled first thing in the morning, seven days a week, without fail. But after the publication of “Streets of Laredo,” in 1993, he stopped. Ossana eventually coaxed him back to the typewriter, and soon she was editing, and sometimes rewriting, his work. In 2011, McMurtry married Faye Kesey, Ken&#39;s widow, after a six-week courtship; the couple lived with Ossana, an arrangement that apparently suited everyone well enough.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In 2006, McMurtry and Ossana won the Golden Globe for Best Screenplay for adapting Annie Proulx&#39;s “Brokeback Mountain”; McMurtry thanked his typewriter in his acceptance speech. At the Oscars, to which he wore bluejeans and boots, he thanked “all the booksellers of the world.” But Archer City never became the literary destination that he&#39;d hoped, and his store, Booked Up, struggled financially. In 2012, McMurtry auctioned off hundreds of thousands of books. “This was his dream, to turn Archer City into a book town,” Getschow, a friend of McMurtry&#39;s, said at the time. “Now this is the end of the dream. There is just no way around it.” McMurtry had followed the family tradition after all, lashing himself to a dying industry and getting his heart broken in the process. After his death, the Texas legislature passed a resolution honoring his memory; two years later, a state representative said that schools “might need to ban &#39;Lonesome Dove&#39; ” for being too sexually explicit.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;McMurtry can seem like a figure from another era. He came of age in a literary economy that allowed for the slow building of a career. Until the breakout success of “Lonesome Dove,” he described himself, with characteristic understatement, as a “midlist writer” and a “minor regional novelist.” (A friend once had those words emblazoned on a T-shirt for him.) He wrote about a Texas that was majority white, with agrarian roots and a preoccupation with its pioneer past. The version of the state which had such a hold on McMurtry, the one he alternately rebelled against and embraced, no longer feels so central—there are plenty of other Texas stories to tell. (For another take on the rollicking nineteenth-century epic, try “Texas: The Great Theft,” by Carmen Boullosa.)&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Last year, the &lt;em>;Archer County News&lt;/em>; reported that Booked Up had been purchased by another Texas celebrity: Chip Gaines, the telegenically scruffy co-star of “Fixer Upper,” the home-renovation show that&#39;s been credited (or blamed) for the spread of the “farmhouse chic” aesthetic. Gaines, who spent summers as a child in Archer City, said that he and his wife had gone through McMurtry&#39;s collection and, with an eye for beautiful bindings, picked out books to be showcased in a new hotel that they&#39;re opening in Waco this fall; the fate of the others is unclear, but the couple say that they plan to donate a large portion back to Archer City. Gaines told me that he identified with McMurtry&#39;s late-in-life return to small-town Texas. “He chose to go back to his roots, back to simple beginnings,” he said. “I just hope I make him proud.” ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;80bl2j&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 18 Sep 2023 19:06:01 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Briefly Noted Book Reviews]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/09/25/the-stealthy-power-of-pockets]]><description>&lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-18T10:00:00.000Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64ff7b0814e4136b38297dc4/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/230925_r42983web-tout.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;article >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attribute-verso-pattern=&quot;article-body&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;ArticlePageChunks&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;Beyond the Door of No Return by David Diop.&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64ff7a87b2c041bb9127dc71/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/230925_r42983web.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64ff7a87b2c041bb9127dc71/master/w_120,c_limit/230925_r42983web.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64ff7a87b2c041bb9127dc71/master/w_240,c_limit/230925_r42983web.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64ff7a87b2c041bb9127dc71/master/w_320,c_limit/230925_r42983web.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64ff7a87b2c041bb9127dc71/master/w_640,c_limit/230925_r42983web.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64ff7a87b2c041bb9127dc71/master/w_960,c_limit/230925_r42983web.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64ff7a87b2c041bb9127dc71/master/w_1280,c_limit/230925_r42983web.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64ff7a87b2c041bb9127dc71/master/w_1600,c_limit/230925_r42983web.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;p >;&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Beyond-Door-No-Return-Novel/dp/0374606773&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Beyond-Door-No-Return-Novel/dp/0374606773&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Beyond-Door-No-Return-Novel/dp/0374606773&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Beyond the Door of No Return&lt;/strong>;&lt;/a>;&lt;em>;, by David Diop, translated from the French by Sam Taylor (Farrar, Straus &amp;amp; Giroux)&lt;/em>;. This metafictional historical novel centers on the recollections of an eighteenth-century French botanist, whose voyage to Senegal is irrevocably altered by his fascination with a young woman who has escaped from a slave ship. His account—gleaned from notebooks discovered by his daughter—begins as a travelogue and then transforms into a record of the escapee&#39;s ordeal, which she recounts to the botanist in the course of one long night: a mesmerizing tale of capture, getaway, and revenge. Diop&#39;s novel, which culminates in a terrifying sequence of events, is a testament to fiction&#39;s ability to uncover our self-deceptions, leaving them “as if exposed to the African sun at its zenith.”&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;I&amp;#x27;ma Fan by Sheena Patel.&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64ff7aa16f174aef5e392efc/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/230925_r42984web.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64ff7aa16f174aef5e392efc/master/w_120,c_limit/230925_r42984web.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64ff7aa16f174aef5e392efc/master/w_240,c_limit/230925_r42984web.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64ff7aa16f174aef5e392efc/master/w_320,c_limit/230925_r42984web.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64ff7aa16f174aef5e392efc/master/w_640,c_limit/230925_r42984web.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64ff7aa16f174aef5e392efc/master/w_960,c_limit/230925_r42984web.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64ff7aa16f174aef5e392efc/master/w_1280,c_limit/230925_r42984web.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64ff7aa16f174aef5e392efc/master/w_1600,c_limit/230925_r42984web.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;p >;&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Im-Fan-Novel-Sheena-Patel/dp/1644452456&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Im-Fan-Novel-Sheena-Patel/dp/1644452456&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Im-Fan-Novel-Sheena-Patel/dp/1644452456&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;&lt;strong>;I&#39;m a Fan&lt;/strong>;&lt;/a>;&lt;em>;, by Sheena Patel (Graywolf)&lt;/em>;. The corrosive logic of one-sided relationships is the subject of this dryly funny polemical novel, told from the perspective of a young woman obsessed with her married lover and his ex-girlfriend. The narrator provokes the lover in various ways, in the hope that he&#39;ll end his other love affairs, despite her being aware of her delusion. Surveilling the ex-girlfriend on Instagram, the narrator reacts to the woman&#39;s expensive purchases, which she broadcasts to a sizable following, with a mixture of loathing and desire. This woman “lives with real life art that I can&#39;t afford and wouldn&#39;t know how to get,” she thinks, “and I put posters up with Blu Tack like I&#39;m still fifteen years old. Like a fan.”&lt;/p>;&lt;hr />;&lt;h2 >;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/best-books-2023&quot;>;The Best Books of 2023&lt;/a>;&lt;/h2>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;Briefly Noted Book Reviews&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/63d16763c44837936a5fb854/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/bestbooks-header-2023-desktop.png&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/63d16763c44837936a5fb854/master/w_120,c_limit/bestbooks-header-2023-desktop.png 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/63d16763c44837936a5fb854/master/w_240,c_limit/bestbooks-header-2023-desktop.png 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/63d16763c44837936a5fb854/master/w_320,c_limit/bestbooks-header-2023-desktop.png 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/63d16763c44837936a5fb854/master/w_640,c_limit/bestbooks-header-2023-desktop.png 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/63d16763c44837936a5fb854/master/w_960,c_limit/bestbooks-header-2023-desktop.png 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/63d16763c44837936a5fb854/master/w_1280,c_limit/bestbooks-header-2023-desktop.png 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/63d16763c44837936a5fb854/master/w_1600,c_limit/bestbooks-header-2023-desktop.png 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;p >;&lt;em>;Read our reviews of the year&#39;s notable new fiction and nonfiction.&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>;&lt;hr />;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;Young Queens by Leah Redmond Chang.&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64ff7a8afbe5b1290e51ceee/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/230925_r42985web.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64ff7a8afbe5b1290e51ceee/master/w_120,c_limit/230925_r42985web.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64ff7a8afbe5b1290e51ceee/master/w_240,c_limit/230925_r42985web.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64ff7a8afbe5b1290e51ceee/master/w_320,c_limit/230925_r42985web.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64ff7a8afbe5b1290e51ceee/master/w_640,c_limit/230925_r42985web.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64ff7a8afbe5b1290e51ceee/master/w_960,c_limit/230925_r42985web.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64ff7a8afbe5b1290e51ceee/master/w_1280,c_limit/230925_r42985web.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64ff7a8afbe5b1290e51ceee/master/w_1600,c_limit/230925_r42985web.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;edtay&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;r67ac8&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Young-Queens-Three-Renaissance-Women/dp/0374294488&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Young-Queens-Three-Renaissance-Women/dp/0374294488&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Young-Queens-Three-Renaissance-Women/dp/0374294488&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Young Queens&lt;/strong>;&lt;/a>;&lt;em>;, by Leah Redmond Chang (Farrar, Straus &amp;amp; Giroux)&lt;/em>;. In this triple biography, the dynamics of Renaissance Europe are illustrated through the lives and the politically motivated marriages of Catherine de&#39; Medici, Elisabeth de Valois, and Mary, Queen of Scots. Catherine, who married into the French royal family, leveraged her maternal qualities to win the right to govern on behalf of her young sons. Her daughter Elisabeth married Philip II of Spain to seal an unsteady peace between their two countries. Mary&#39;s strongest loyalty was to her French relatives—leading her to underestimate a dissatisfied Scottish nobility. In an era of empire-hungry monarchs and religious violence, these women, while fulfilling their obligations as wives and mothers, forged diplomatic connections through family ties.&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;Anansi&amp;#x27;s Gold by Yepoka Yeebo.&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64ff7a8cfbe5b1290e51cef0/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/230925_r42986web.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64ff7a8cfbe5b1290e51cef0/master/w_120,c_limit/230925_r42986web.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64ff7a8cfbe5b1290e51cef0/master/w_240,c_limit/230925_r42986web.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64ff7a8cfbe5b1290e51cef0/master/w_320,c_limit/230925_r42986web.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64ff7a8cfbe5b1290e51cef0/master/w_640,c_limit/230925_r42986web.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64ff7a8cfbe5b1290e51cef0/master/w_960,c_limit/230925_r42986web.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64ff7a8cfbe5b1290e51cef0/master/w_1280,c_limit/230925_r42986web.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64ff7a8cfbe5b1290e51cef0/master/w_1600,c_limit/230925_r42986web.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;p >;&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Anansis-Gold-Outfoxed-Washington-Swindled/dp/1635574730&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Anansis-Gold-Outfoxed-Washington-Swindled/dp/1635574730&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Anansis-Gold-Outfoxed-Washington-Swindled/dp/1635574730&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Anansi&#39;s Gold&lt;/strong>;&lt;/a>;&lt;em>;, by Yepoka Yeebo (Bloomsbury)&lt;/em>;. For two decades, beginning in the late nineteen-sixties, a Ghanaian man named John Ackah Blay-Miezah carried out an astonishingly successful scam by pretending to have inherited billions of dollars from Kwame Nkrumah, Ghana&#39;s first President. Though the inheritance was a fiction, propped up by forged documents and opportunistic coöperators looking to capitalize on political instability, Blay-Miezah swindled his marks out of millions by convincing them that he needed money to access the fund, and used his newfound wealth to become one of the country&#39;s most powerful people. Yeebo, a journalist, skillfully interweaves archival material, FBI records, and interviews to recount the saga of the con man&#39;s career, and to reflect on how lies can be leveraged in the creation of national histories.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;yxf0pk&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 18 Sep 2023 19:06:01 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Jeremy O.

Harris) 住在伦敦的一套两层公寓里。他前往那里拍摄自己的戏剧《爸爸》，该剧讲述了一位年轻的黑人艺术家被一位年长的白人所奴役的故事。《爸爸》一年前在百老汇外首演，原定于 2020 年 3 月底在阿尔梅达剧院上演；这将是哈里斯在海外的首次专业演出。但演出没有开演，哈里斯一直滞留在伦敦几个星期，然后，最终，几个月。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;对这部戏感到悲伤，对这个世界感到害怕，他在最初的几周里没有写作——尽管许多截止日期，他生活中不变的同伴，都徘徊在边缘自高中以来，哈里斯就利用深夜和清晨作为工作、聚会以及与朋友谈论艺术的时间；现在他狂看动漫，听 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/03/23/fiona-apples-art-of-radical-sensitivity&quot;>;Fiona Apple&lt;/a>; 和开始阅读 Audre Lorde 的“&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Sister-Outsider-Speeches-Crossing-Feminist/dp/1580911862/&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot ;:“ExternalLink”、“outgoingURL”：“https://www.amazon.com/Sister-Outsider-Speeches-Crossing-Feminist/dp/1580911862/”}&quot;

aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;哈里斯是很高，很瘦，以即兴的精确度处理自己的身体，非正式中夹杂着正式，就像休息日在商场里的舞者一样。从肩膀开始的动作总是在指尖结束。当他在句子之间摸索思想时，他会用手在空中画出形状。他有着白皙的雪松皮肤和一张活泼的大嘴。当他处于中性情绪时，他的眼睛平静且低垂，但当他讲故事或表达紧急（通常是反对）意见时，他的眼睛睁得大大的。故事有时会促使他站起来，对关键的动作段落进行哑剧表演。在写作之前，他的第一个梦想就是行动。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;当第三杯咖啡端上来时，他终于正确地坐在靠窗的沙发上，点燃了一支香烟。他说，尽管致命的呼吸道疾病在全球范围内蔓延，他认识的很多人又开始吸烟了：“我们的肺部随时可能衰竭，而我们只是，你知道，去他妈的。”&lt;/p >;&lt;p>;咖啡和美国精神，窗外的白光——他在阳光下醒来的本能得到了证实。白天的公寓很舒适。一面墙上挂着一幅巨大的抽象画，颜色为黄褐色和酒红色，涂着明亮的口红。楼上是一间卧室，他与新男友阿万德·科斯拉维 (Arvand Khosravi) 合住，阿万德·科斯拉维是​​一名影视主管。楼梯顶部有一扇玻璃门，通向屋顶上的一个浅壁架，哈里斯经常去那里拍摄 TikTok 视频——大多是对经典戏剧场景的罂粟花、快节奏的即兴重复——他几乎每天都会发布这些视频。其中一个标题为“&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://twitter.com/jeremyoharris/status/1246604978346754049&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot; ：“https://twitter.com/jeremyoharris/status/1246604978346754049”}&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jeremyoharris/status/1246604978346754049&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;泰特斯·安德洛尼克斯第五幕&lt;/a>;”，他穿着四种不同的服装，假唱电视节目《鲶鱼》中的对话；它有九秒长。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;哈里斯玩 TikTok 是为了好玩；几周来，它们是他创造性表达的唯一途径。但他们也毫不隐晦地讽刺了他最近获得名声的职业。 TikTok 植根于戏剧的历史和经典剧目，但戏剧性地与超当前的节奏、态度和风格结合在一起，证明哈里斯可以做到大型艺术机构无法做到的事情——跟上。他想，当他们陷入困境时，他的手机就能继续演出。他将自己经常更新的 Twitter 帐户上的简介更改为剧院的墓志铭：“我在昏迷中花了 20 多岁的时间致力于一门手艺。”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline -recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;舞台处处漆黑；剧院公司和非营利组织都在争先恐后。在他们的公开声明和与剧作家的私人谈话中，他们都表现出乐观的态度，好像他们的业务将在夏季结束前启动并运行。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“就像，不，伙计们！”哈里斯描述了他的挫败感。 “我们必须重新发明这个或重新创造这个，否则六个月后，当你们浪费资源试图走正常的道路时，这将对艺术家更加不利。” “爸爸”仍然在英国陷入困境，他还有另一部戏剧，“男孩公司出品：‘告诉我，如果我伤害了你’”——他版本的詹姆士一世时期的复仇剧，基于一次特别糟糕的分手——预定于5 月在纽约 Playwrights Horizo​​ns 首次亮相。没有人会正式承认——或者也许让自己相信——接下来的几季不会发生，但哈里斯已经在哀悼新剧了，就像他哀悼“爸爸”一样。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;他的愤怒尽管如此，思考和谈论他所在行业的失败似乎让他充满活力——几乎让他感到平静——而他在网上的抱怨很快就引起了更广泛的情绪的共鸣。随着疫情最初的冲击逐渐被对种族和其他社会安排的重新评估所取代，哈里斯成为了他的艺术家同行所感受到的长期且突然的严重动荡的代言人。这个时刻非常适合哈里斯对制度批评的自然倾向，尽管有些矛盾。他是一个快乐的优雅沉默的颠覆者，尽管如此，他还是通过娱乐界一些最稳重的前哨基地制定了一条职业和个人道路：耶鲁大学戏剧学院;他为 Gucci 担任模特；洛杉矶各个好莱坞毗邻的街区；现在，最引人注目的是白色大道。去年秋天，哈里斯在纽约上演的第一部作品《奴隶戏剧》在市中心著名的纽约剧院工作室进行了长时间的演出后，转移到了百老汇的黄金剧院。&lt;/p>;&lt; 《奴隶游戏》讲述了三对跨种族夫妇接受“战前性行为治疗”的故事，大概是为了修复因种族问题而破裂的关系。在第一幕中，在观众进入现场之前，一对身着十九世纪服装的夫妇，作为主人和奴隶，参与了各种变态的性场景，这些场景旨在在对种族和性别敏感的美国人心中引发绊脚石。第二幕是真正的治疗发生，非常有趣。第三首是一对夫妇（一名黑人妇女和她的白人丈夫）之间的超现实且令人恐惧的二重唱。 《奴隶游戏》一遍又一遍地质疑性同意的真实参数，并试图从主奴强奸的残酷历史中汲取当今的宣泄情绪。&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;一些角落——包括这本杂志，在&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/12/24/black-and-white-in-slave-play-and-to-kill- a-mockingbird&quot;>;我写的评论&lt;/a>;——哈里斯因其极其严谨的视野和独创性的声音而受到称赞。该剧的巨大成功是他现在享受许多奢侈品的先决条件：伦敦公寓、欧洲参与、他最近与 HBO 签署的为期两年的开发协议。与此同时，“奴隶游戏”是一种恶搞工作，其目的是让他所属的不同群体——种族、性别、制度、职业——感到不安，甚至可能激怒。哈里斯一定知道这部剧会产生这样的效果；他似乎陶醉于它所留下的混乱局面。甚至在大流行之前，他就已经赢得了“可怕的孩子”的名声，这种称号只有通过接近才能获得。你必须离大房子相当近才能考虑扔石头。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“我一直想知道什么时候我才能培养出受影响的黑人知识分子的声音，”哈里斯说那年夏天，依然滞留在伦敦。他正在反思一些他最喜欢的老一代作家和艺术家，以及他们的谈话和他们的作品一样努力风格化的方式。他一直在考虑&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1994/11/07/andre-leon-talley-vogue-the-only-one&quot;>;André Leon Talley&lt;/a >;，这位时尚作家和编辑，其高调的措辞和巴洛克式的句法成为了他风格的标志，而且，这似乎是在以白人为主的环境中维护自己归属感的一种方式。去年去世的塔利和哈里斯一样，都是一位来自南方的高个子、奇怪的、爱说话的黑人。他与白人同事、老板和捐助者之间复杂的、有时甚至是痛苦的关系网与《奴隶游戏》中描绘的动态相一致，甚至可能影响了这一动态。哈里斯毫不掩饰地研究其他艺术家的角色。 “我对个人风格、人际关系和阶层非常感兴趣——如果不是阶层提升，那就是阶层交往，”他说。 “只是某些人轻快的声音。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;谈论那个声音——我不用问就知道哈里斯的意思——让我想到了我自己的声音，也许有点防御性。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>; “你有一点，”他说，证实了我大声说出的恐惧。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;不过，我们一致认为，我们粗壮的年龄组——哈里斯三十四岁——的声音很特别。哈里斯心目中的那种千禧一代黑人作家并不是那种会运用詹姆斯·鲍德温温文尔雅的串联句子的人。相反，这个假设的三十多岁的人，渴望展示流行文化的随和性和平等主义的谦逊，以及展示来之不易的言语敏锐度，会使用充满尖刻的“喜欢”和“嗯”的措辞，再加上一点声音炸裂，具有虚假自嘲色彩的微妙音调：具有高级学位的山谷女孩。&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot;

data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Harris speaks in a restless tenor, alternating locomotive bursts with considered pauses;他的声音明亮、微咸、温暖。他不断地谈论电影、戏剧、衣服和人们的身体。他的句子经常以“你看见了吗？”开头。或“你读过吗？”除非他已经从你的作品中知道你已经看过或读过它，以及你对它的看法，并准备好温和地争论。当他听到自己同意的事情时，他会鼓励地说“是”，但没有过多强调，从不说“是”。他经常使用的两个词是“表面上”和“精神病”。&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;哈里斯在弗吉尼亚州马丁斯维尔长大，那些以身体为生的人，其中许多人在工厂工作。他的说话方式使他与众不同。他的母亲维罗妮卡·法里什 (Veronica Farrish) 拒绝让家人与他使用儿语。他自学读书，很快就成为了那种过早不为所动的孩子，发现与老师交朋友比与同学交朋友更容易。哈里斯说，当哈里斯八岁的时候，他最喜欢的消遣之一就是与母亲交换关于琼贝妮特·拉姆齐（JonBenét Ramsey）的遭遇的理论，这位六岁的选美选手的谋杀案在九十年代末引起了小报的轰动：“我，就像，“好吧，我看了这份文件。” ”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;他早期对真实犯罪的兴趣短暂地让他相信他想成为一名律师——这是早熟健谈的人的备用愿望。但在参加中学制作的《窈窕淑女》后，他意识到自己可能只是想在电视上扮演一名律师。大约在同一时间，哈里斯意识到自己是同性恋，或者至少是不同的——这种差异是他还无法用言语表达的罕见情况。另一个不舒服的地方是他的家庭生活不稳定。直到九岁或十岁时，他才见到了自己的亲生父亲。他的母亲在哈里斯四岁时与另一个男人结婚，在哈里斯上中学时离婚，然后开始了另一段短暂的婚姻，嫁给了一名驻扎在当时的北卡罗来纳州布拉格堡的军人。哈里斯和他的母亲搬到那里并在一所新学校就读。 “我非常沮丧，”他说。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;哈里斯在私立基督教学校度过了童年的大部分时间，并得到了经济援助。结果，他适应了在一个主要富裕的白人环境中作为一个贫穷的黑人孩子所带来的令人不安的紧张感。然后，在十年级时，他获得了马丁斯维尔预科学校卡莱尔的奖学金。走廊里挂着每个毕业生的照片。哈里斯回忆道，直到九十年代中期，学校成立了一支篮球队，黑人面孔才开始出现在照片中。 “每个人都希望我打篮球，”哈里斯说。 “我当时想，不。我非常讨厌那样。我当时想，我永远不会那样做。”相反，他开始游泳和跳舞。他继续与老师交朋友的做法。 “坎迪斯和保拉在中学教书，”他回忆道，“放学后我会和他们一起喝咖啡，他们是我的朋友。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;此时，哈里斯决心成为一个演员。他参演了戏剧和音乐剧，并执导了莫伊塞斯·考夫曼的纪录片《拉勒米计划》，该剧讲述了怀俄明大学同性恋学生马修·谢泼德被杀的后果。他的咖啡馆朋友坎迪斯·欧文·威廉姆斯（Candace Owen-Williams）在卡莱尔教授戏剧，他让他把学校后面的一辆空拖车改造成一个黑匣子剧院，他和其他一些朋友在那里上演实验节目。他的毕业论文是华莱士·肖恩 (Wallace Shawn) 的《狂热》(The Fever) 的一人制作。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;在大学期间，哈里斯 (Harris) 进入了芝加哥德保罗大学 (DePaul University) 的表演学院。该项目的结构很残酷：大一结束后，只有一半的学生被允许继续参加表演班；其他人则被裁掉，如果他们想留在学校，就必须选择不同的学习领域。哈里斯发现第一年——本质上是一场旷日持久的试镜——令人迷失方向。 “我的很多老师都说我的智力会妨碍我成为一名真正的演员，”他说。 “我总是会导演或重写场景的情况，以适应我想要玩的情感状态，使其对我来说更有趣。”他说，部分问题在于许多角色和场景都是针对白人演员的。但他内化了这样的信息：“如果你很聪明，你就必须隐藏它，”他说。 “我仍然坚持我的所有选择，”他补充道，“因为，在某些方面，我当时制作的剧院比现在制作的更酷。”为了进行“自动戏剧”练习，他在舞台上放置了二十盏不同形状和大小的灯。灯光是演出中唯一的光源。每一个都代表了一个与父亲形象相关的故事。当时和现在一样，哈里斯一直在寻找，有时甚至是找到一些掩盖的方式来描述他亲生父亲留下的缺席。在每道灯光的辉光中，他讲述了一段记忆的版本。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;第一学期结束后，哈里斯剪掉了长发，担心老师会如何看待他。第二年夏天，当该计划被削减时，他给他的朋友兼同学埃里卡·J·辛普森 (Erika J. Simpson) 打电话。 Neither had got in. They were quiet for a long time.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;1uw3i&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;It was June—a beautiful month in Chicago but, for Harris, who had just turned nineteen, the grim beginning of an uncertain period.他打电话给他的一位老师询问他被解雇的原因；她说他要到三十多岁才能“成为一名演员”，并滔滔不绝地列出了一系列理由，对他来说，这些理由就像是“同性恋编码的狗屎”。他告诉我，“我们这一年有四个黑人男孩，被淘汰的两个是那些感觉最女性化的人。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;他开始收集《芝加哥读者》的问题&lt;em>;&lt; /em>;，一份免费的另类报纸，他在其页面上搜寻代理通知。在试镜时，他崩溃了，哭泣并颤抖。他向制片人解释了自己的情况——有些人去了德保罗；有些人去了德保罗；有些人去了德保罗。他们明白了——他们告诉他，他可以暂时走出房间，让自己平静下来，然后再试一次。相反，他只是离开了。&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;最终，哈里斯在城市的小场馆中获得了微薄的角色。他主修英语，并短暂地想象过写诗。他对艾未未的作品很感兴趣，艾未未是一位来自亚利桑那州的混血女性，她糟糕的成长经历让哈里斯想起了自己。艾未未于 2010 年去世，她的诗中充满了坚韧、狡猾、脆弱的工人阶级的声音，他们在冷漠且常常充满敌意的背景下维护自己的尊严，或者至少是某种时髦而巧妙的反抗。世界。 “你说你想要这个故事/用我自己的话来说，/但你不会按照我的方式讲述，”她的诗“&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/browse?volume=151&amp;amp ;issue=1&amp;amp;page=14&quot;>;采访警察&lt;/a>;”，从 1987 年开始。她的作品影响了哈里斯对独白可能性的理解。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;但是哈里斯并没有长期担任英语专业或德保罗大学的学生。他退学了，一年后搬到了洛杉矶。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;在第一个大流行夏天结束时，哈里斯和科斯拉维离开了伦敦的公寓，开着一辆装满他们东西的汽车环游欧洲。 。科斯拉维觉得自己被困在公寓里太久了，但哈里斯拒绝搬回美国，“这就是为什么和我约会太糟糕了，”他说。十月中旬，两人在意大利那不勒斯通过直播宣布了托尼提名。意大利已是傍晚时分。哈里斯与他的妈妈、侄女和侄子通过 FaceTime 通话，这样他就可以和他们一起观看。他不得不放弃大约四项提名，因为他妈妈正在观看的直播比他的要早，而且在他看到新闻之前她一直在尖叫。最终，《奴隶戏》获得了十二项提名，比以往任何非音乐作品的提名都要多。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;《奴隶戏》是一部真正困难的作品，是一次刻意的挑衅。在一场秀后问答中A.，一名白人妇女对哈里斯大喊，她“不想听到白人一直是他妈的问题”。一些黑人观众坚持认为该剧面向“白人凝视”，是对奴隶制和强奸相互交织的主题的愤世嫉俗的利用。这两股强烈反对的浪潮或多或少都是可以预见的。十几项提名似乎表明，哈里斯可以在戏剧界的客厅里发起一场食物大战，但仍然会被邀请坐在餐桌旁。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“这让我更有勇气更直率地表达我的观点以及如何我对这个世界有感觉，因为，如果我他妈的关心机构实际上对我说什么，那么获得十二项提名的《奴隶戏剧》就不会是获得十二项提名的《奴隶戏剧》，”他说。 “这将是一个更愚蠢的戏剧，一个不那么复杂的戏剧，一个不那么杰里米的戏剧。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;但这种机构的认可也提出了一种创造性的挑战。 “我认为我正在努力克服的事情是其他人对我的兴奋，去年我一直在努力解决这个问题，”哈里斯说。 “当我从‘这些人不够相信我’这样的地方写作时，我会更容易写作。”当我有东西要证明时，我可以写得更好。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;自从在洛杉矶工作以来，如果不是之前的话，哈里斯就已经将自己定义为与周围的人相对立——或者至少是那些与他有关系的人。力量。他最初并不是在专业场合，而是在更自由流动的深夜场景中取得了自己的成功。在芝加哥，他开始认识到自己的性格和体态是一种天赋。他身高六英尺五英寸，很有趣，很快乐。人们被他吸引并希望他参加他们的聚会。他在&lt;em>;AKIRA&lt;/em>;柳条公园的一家时尚女装精品店找到了一份工作，在那里他帮助客户寻找外出服装。通常，这些客户会邀请他去俱乐部。很快，他就成了夜生活中的常客。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“我是第一个会告诉你我讨厌同性恋酒吧的人，因为我在那里没有那么大的权力，”他告诉我。 “黑人、瘦骨嶙峋、魅力四射——在异性恋酒吧里，你比在同性恋酒吧里更有权力。我并没有威胁那里的直男。我也是夜总会的一个奇怪的蜜罐，因为所有这些有趣的女孩都想呆更长时间去闲逛，也想买更多的酒。”夜生活是一种翻腾的经济，对大多数人来说只是部分可见，是一个隐藏在面纱后面的系统。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;他在洛杉矶开辟了一个类似的空间，找到了一份白天的工作，在那里，那些很酷、有联系的人肯定会买衣服——这次是巴尼斯百货——并成为俱乐部的常客。他结交了一些朋友，其中一些是演艺界的朋友，他四处询问如何在这个行业找到自己的出路。他在聚会上交谈的人中有一些未来的重要合作者：作家兼导演萨姆·莱文森（Sam Levinson）、电影制片人贾尼扎·布拉沃（Janicza Bravo）。 “我认为我的语言能力帮助我驾驭这个领域，”他说。 “还有我的风格。 I have good-to-decent style.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Harris got small acting gigs: he starred in a short film directed by the actor James Franco; he appeared, very briefly, in the Terrence Malick movie “Song to Song.” But he hated the idea of being at the mercy of gatekeepers, who, like his teachers at DePaul, might label him uncastable. When Lena Dunham&#39;s show “Girls” débuted on HBO, in the spring of 2012, he saw her as a kindred spirit, and a role model. Watching “Girls,” he thought, “This is so perfect, and also I think I could do it.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Like Dunham—and like Ilana Glazer and Abbi Jacobson, of “Broad City,” another inspiration—Harris and Erika Simpson, his friend from DePaul, created a Web series, “#NightStrife,” and uploaded it to YouTube. “It&#39;s two twentysomethings trying to get famous,” Simpson says, by way of explanation, in the first episode. They made only a few episodes, which were not widely seen, though a tongue-in-cheek series promo of sorts, titled “Black Girl Takes a Shit,” has been watched nearly eighty thousand times.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Harris became jaded about Hollywood; he stopped acting, and stopped referring to himself as an actor. He started to call himself a playwright, though he had yet to write a play. He cast about for ideas, unsuccessfully, until he went on a date with a porn star, whose stories yielded the material for Harris&#39;s first play, “Xander Xyst, Dragon: 1,” a kind of fantasia on the theme of online celebrity. With the play—which featured music by Isabella Summers, of Florence and the Machine, another friend he&#39;d made in LA—he won a spot at the Samuel French Off-Off Broadway Short Play Festival, in 2014. There, he met a group of young playwrights who are now his contemporaries: Will Arbery, Martyna Majok, Leah Nanako Winkler, Eleanor Burgess.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Afterward, he applied for a fellowship at the MacDowell artists&#39; residency—and, when he was wait-listed, he called the administration every day until someone told him yes. At MacDowell, he met the playwright Amy Herzog, who encouraged him to apply to Yale. He&#39;d already finished a draft of “Daddy,” and he submitted it to the drama school&#39;s admissions board, along with a heartfelt essay. “The clearest memory I have of my childhood is elegantly staged,” he wrote. “Delicately, it moves in a realm between the cinematic and the theatrical: lights up on an open screen door leading into a wide hallway, my mother (early 30s) downstage paces from one off stage room to another whispering vitriol into a cordless phone, somewhere further off stage we can hear the sounds of a young girl crying, and upstage in profile I sit (12) back to back with a large suitcase looking out of the open door periodically. 。 。 。 Suddenly the crying stops replaced by The Pointer Sisters and my mother is standing with my sister in her arms in the middle of the hall tears, a smile and snot dancing on her face, &#39;He&#39;s not coming. Come on baby, let&#39;s dance,&#39; she said. So we did.”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;xd9qbr&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Harris has come to see “Daddy” as a play about furthering his career by seeking the opportunity and resources that an institution like Yale can provide. “Going to Yale was me deciding to marry a white guy on a hill and in order to have the time and space to make my work,” he &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.ssense.com/en-us/editorial/culture/oh-jeremy&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.ssense.com/en-us/editorial/culture/oh-jeremy&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.ssense.com/en-us/editorial/culture/oh-jeremy&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;told&lt;/a>; one interviewer. Elsewhere, he has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vice.com/en/article/8qgm9g/decolonizing-my-desire&quot;>;described&lt;/a>; the play as an attempt “to parse the ways I was cradled, coddled and collected by white institutions and how I&#39;ve collected and used them in turn.” He once wrote that he went to Yale with eyes open, “believing that I could take more from this place than they would take from me.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In early 2021, the demands of Harris&#39;s still fairly young renown finally called him back to New York. &lt;em>;Town &amp;amp; Country&lt;/em>; had planned a multi-page spread to showcase his newly designed home office, which had been furnished by the chic design firm Green River Project. On a cold, pewter-sky morning in January, Harris sat in a studio belonging to Aaron Aujla, one of the firm&#39;s owners, at a nondescript former warehouse in Brooklyn, getting ready to have his picture taken. Someone tended to his hair, always a foremost point of interest in the looks he puts together for magazine covers and red carpets. There were small, feathery tufts of it strewn about the studio&#39;s bright-green floor.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“I think I want just a mustache,” Harris said. He&#39;d come to the shoot with several pictures of the Japanese writer Yukio Mishima at the ready on his phone. He pulled one up: Mishima in his office, behind a desk and flanked by books, pouting fiercely at the camera, his dark brows writhing. The writer&#39;s louche, vaguely sexual gaze did have something of the solitary mustache about it.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Harris has often, with a bit of a wink—and in spite of Mishima&#39;s reactionary politics—called Mishima his favorite writer. A few months earlier, he had tweeted, “Ok guys so to combat seasonal / pandemic depression and the sense that my life moves at a pace my body can&#39;t keep up with I&#39;ve decided to do a workout every day a la my favorite writer YUKIO MISHIMA. Who combatted depression and dread w/ workouts and a failed coup d&#39;état.” In 1970, Mishima and several members of a militia that he had formed attempted to take over a Japanese military base, in the hope of inspiring an overthrow of the country&#39;s constitution. After a fiery speech, Mishima—obsessed with physical beauty and warlike vigor—killed himself with a sword. “Do I hate fascists?” Harris wrote, in another tweet. “Yes. Do I love Mishima?是的。 I&#39;m a Gemini. Two truths can be held.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Aujla puttered in and out of the studio, smiling and not saying much. He is married to the fashion designer Emily Bode, known for her knit menswear; she and Aujla are neighbors of Harris&#39;s, in Chinatown, and have become his friends. She&#39;d brought a rack of clothes for Harris to choose from. Once in a while, he&#39;d disappear behind a curtain and come out wearing a pair of fluid trousers or a lacy top or a burgundy suit, evocative of Mishima. (He selected the suit as one of his outfits.) When something tickled him, he let his voice rise to a high, smoky giggle. “That&#39;s cunt,” he sometimes said. Between costume changes, he chatted about recent movies, especially a new coming-of-age indie film that everybody seemed to like but that he couldn&#39;t bring himself to watch.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;“Arvand hates me for this,” Harris said, referring to his Hollywood-exec boyfriend, “but I can&#39;t stand this kind of shit.” He went on, “It&#39;s always that same thing: &#39;Here I am, marginalized little kid—Black, immigrant, gay, whatever—and here&#39;s the &lt;em>;wide&lt;/em>;, &lt;em>;wide world&lt;/em>;.&#39; ” By now he was acting out the archetype, hunched into a pantomime of childish wonder, his eyes big with fear, his hands clasped. “And now there&#39;s big trouble”—he cowered in terror—“and inner strife”—he anxiously trembled—“but soon”—now he let a smile spread across his face—“I overcome.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“I knew exactly what that movie was gonna be the moment it started, and I was, like, No, thank you,” he said. Bode, who has a slim face framed by twin curtains of dark hair and speaks in a soft, helpful voice, like that of an expensive therapist, laughed until her face turned pink.&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;a data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a27607&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a27607&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;Jeremy O.

Like Harris, Leifheit went to Yale for graduate school and is the entrepreneurial, self-sustaining center of his own career. He edits the magazine &lt;em>;MATTE&lt;/em>;, makes photo books, and teaches workshops across the country. They met because of Harris&#39;s insistence, in New Haven, on spreading his presence far beyond the confines of the drama school: he was known to drop in on photography critique sessions and to speak up, offering references and suggestions. “A lot of people thought he was part of the photo program,” John Pilson, one of the program&#39;s longest-serving faculty members, said. “By the end, we all expected to see him every week.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Harris had arrived at Yale in 2016. Several of his classmates were far beyond him professionally: they&#39;d had shows produced, they had agents. He was eager to catch up, but soon found himself at odds with the institution. The curriculum was too conservative for his taste; he felt that his instructors were dismissive of his interest in more experimental work. He started taking classes in Black studies and poetry. He also began work on “Slave Play,” which he says “poured out” of him almost whole. He was assigned a faculty adviser, the acclaimed playwright and director &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/11/03/real-gone-girl&quot;>;Young Jean Lee&lt;/a>;, who would help shepherd a student production.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Lee is a longtime downtown experimentalist, and many of her work&#39;s subjects—race, class, the body—are also crucial to Harris; he was excited to work with her. But she had extensive notes on “Slave Play,” which Harris mostly declined to take. She objected strongly to the final act, set in the bedroom of a Black woman named Kaneisha and her white British husband, Jim. Their therapy has been a disaster, largely because of Jim&#39;s refusal to go along with goofily degrading role-play. Kaneisha calls Jim a “virus,” and connects their relationship to the brutalities of the past; Jim gets back into character, as a slave master, and gives Kaneisha the abasement she seems to have been asking for.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;This sequence, the most hotly debated part of “Slave Play,” stayed in the show, even after the move to Broadway. When Lee saw it in a dress rehearsal, she was horrified; later, she told Harris that it took her more than an hour to calm down enough to give him feedback. The two then exchanged lengthy text messages. “I hope that no one has ever spoken that violently to you about work that so deeply intersects with your being, and if they have I&#39;m sorry,” Harris wrote. Lee replied, “If you&#39;re that irresponsible about putting a rape of a female body onstage, I&#39;m going to call you out on it in no uncertain terms. To turn it around and call me the violent one is a classic move that has been done to me many times, and I&#39;ve never fallen for it, and I&#39;m not falling for it now.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Their dispute culminated in a formal complaint process, presided over by Tarell Alvin McCraney, who leads the drama school&#39;s playwriting program. Harris used transcripts from those meetings in “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.nplusonemag.com/issue-38/fiction-drama/yell-a-documentary-of-my-time-here/&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.nplusonemag.com/issue-38/fiction-drama/yell-a-documentary-of-my-time-here/&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nplusonemag.com/issue-38/fiction-drama/yell-a-documentary-of-my-time-here/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;Yell: A &#39;Documentary&#39; of My Time Here&lt;/a>;,” his senior thesis play. I went to see it, in New Haven, in 2019. By then, Harris had already staged “Slave Play” and “Daddy” Off Broadway, but he still had something to prove to his teachers. The most constant formal structure in “Yell” is repeated acts of onstage defecation. Fake shit was everywhere at Yale&#39;s Iseman Theatre that day.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;p49xk&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Harris has said that “Yell” was inspired by the radical 1967 essay “The Student as Nigger,” by Jerry Farber, which compares the relationship between American students and their professors to that of slaves and masters. In June, 2020, at the height of the George Floyd protests, Harris shared “Yell” online, and wrote a long accompanying Twitter &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://twitter.com/jeremyoharris/status/1270447515570233350&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://twitter.com/jeremyoharris/status/1270447515570233350&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jeremyoharris/status/1270447515570233350&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;thread&lt;/a>; in which he posted screenshots of his text exchange with Lee, who declined to comment for this story. “EVERY DAY THEY TREATED ME LIKE A NIGGA THAT NEEDED TO BE TAMED AND IT MADE ME FEEL CRAZY,” he wrote.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In September, 2021, Harris sat in a chair in a bathroom at a ritzy hotel in New York. The Tonys were finally being awarded that night, and he&#39;d booked a suite nearby, where he could get ready. Also in the bathroom were his hairdresser, Latisha Chong, and a woman tending to his makeup and nails. He sat stock-still, never wincing as Chong pulled through his Afro and started to braid. The three of them, mutually devoted to the task of flashy beauty, calmly chatted about people they knew in common.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Everybody who knows him thinks he&#39;s gay,” Harris said. “But, I&#39;m telling you, he&#39;s straight.” Both women disbelievingly harrumphed. “Bone straight,” he said.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;The bathroom was a center of calm in the otherwise hectic suite. Harris occasionally got up to take a Polaroid of the room—an editor at &lt;em>;Vogue&lt;/em>; had commissioned him to keep a photo diary. Also milling around were two camerapeople shooting footage for a “Slave Play” documentary that Harris had promised to deliver to HBO. They swanned around the room, sometimes going out on the balcony to capture views of downtown and the West Side. Beyond and between the buildings, you could see the Hudson quietly snaking along.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Harris&#39;s assistant kept running out of the room, collecting bouquets of flowers and other gifts that were arriving in a steady stream. Harris had recently interviewed the young gay rapper Lil Nas X for a &lt;em>;GQ&lt;/em>; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gq.com/story/lil-nas-x-musician-of-the-year-2021&quot;>;profile&lt;/a>;. “Montero—he&#39;s brilliant,” he said, using the rapper&#39;s given name. “The interview felt kind of like a first date.” He asked his assistant to put on a song from Lil Nas X&#39;s new album, a catchy single called “Industry Baby.” “This one is gonna be huge,” Harris said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Friends continually appeared, at his invitation. His mother and niece were getting their makeup done in a neighboring room. Candace Owen-Williams, his old teacher, was there, too, in a sparkly gown. Harris pointed her out to each new arrival and repeated the story of how she made him feel less alone at school.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;This is how Harris relaxes—sitting somewhere near the center of a crowd that he&#39;s convened. Antwaun Sargent, an art critic and a gallerist with Gagosian, walked over to the ledge where Harris&#39;s gold accessories, custom-made for him by the haute-couture house Schiaparelli, sat gleaming. There were chunky rings and cufflinks, a necklace with a pendant made from a cast of Harris&#39;s ear, a “Phantom of the Opera”-style mask modelled after a swooping section of his face.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;As the sun began to set and the light in the room darkened, Harris asked everyone to leave so that he could ready himself for the show. That night, in a surprise to prognosticators, “Slave Play” was completely shut out—twelve nominations, nothing to bring home. The next day, the online edition of Page Six carried the headline “Jeremy O. Harris celebrates Tony snubs with two afterparties.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Early last year, Harris tweeted a casual swipe at the state of television. “I write tv for people who have an intellect for theatre since tv is hollow,” he wrote. “Bc the funny thing is the reason so many filmmakers and theatre makers were asked to make television is bc the medium hit a wall. That&#39;s why almost all the best tv, of late, has been made by exciting practitioners of other forms.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Stung TV writers and irritated critics noted that Harris now made much of his living from television, and not always in its most rarefied corners. In 2021, he&#39;d done a cameo, as himself, on the reboot of “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2008/03/10/advanced-placement&quot;>;Gossip Girl&lt;/a>;.” (The script called for a play within the show, which Harris wrote; later, he got it commissioned by the Public Theatre.) Then he was cast, as a fashion designer, in the second season of “Emily in Paris,” Darren Starr&#39;s critically maligned Netflix series about an American influencer who gets a job in France. The show&#39;s producers told Harris that they were looking for someone reminiscent of a young André Leon Talley.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Sharper observers of Harris&#39;s commentary noticed that he was playing a familiar role. “I support Jeremy O Harris being snotty about TV,” the &lt;em>;Times&lt;/em>; critic Jason Zinoman wrote. “Playwrights used to be like this all the time. It&#39;s a glorious tradition.” The path from New York theatre to a career in Hollywood—where the money and the weather are better, and the audiences are bigger—has been traversed by writers for almost a century. And Harris seemed to be giving television a dose of his usual medicine: let me in and I&#39;ll give you a piece of my mind.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;But on his winding path to playwriting, Harris had made the kinds of friends you would make if you were aiming for the screen all along. When Harris was still at Yale, Sam Levinson made him a consultant for his notoriously lurid HBO teen drama “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/on-television/the-addictive-chills-and-thrills-of-euphoria&quot;>;Euphoria&lt;/a>;.” (Harris is now a producer on the series.) Janicza Bravo got Harris hired as the co-writer for her movie “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-front-row/zola-reviewed-a-twitter-thread-takes-an-ingenious-and-audacious-cinematic-form&quot;>;Zola&lt;/a>;,” adapted from a riotous series of tweets.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;His steadiest Hollywood employment came in the form of the HBO deal that he signed in 2020. The following year, the network announced that he would adapt the novel “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Vanishing-Half-Novel-Brit-Bennett/dp/0525536965&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Vanishing-Half-Novel-Brit-Bennett/dp/0525536965&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Vanishing-Half-Novel-Brit-Bennett/dp/0525536965&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;The Vanishing Half&lt;/a>;,” by Brit Bennett, along with the playwright Aziza Barnes, a friend of his. The novel tells the story of twin sisters whose fates diverge: one dissolves into the American mainstream, passing as white; the other anchors herself in Black community. Harris and Barnes assembled a writers&#39; room to produce a pilot and a “show bible,” outlining the plot of the first season. They led the writers on a research trip to New Orleans, where much of “The Vanishing Half” is set. As the weeks passed, Harris was often airborne, travelling to fashion gigs, conducting interviews for magazines. When he signed the HBO deal, he&#39;d insisted that his contract contain an annual fund for supporting theatre, and he&#39;d used some of that money to create a fellowship for emerging writers. He was always &lt;em>;working&lt;/em>;. He just wasn&#39;t always writing.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Then, the following June, the Daily Beast &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thedailybeast.com/jeremy-o-harris-let-go-from-hbos-the-vanishing-half&quot;>;reported&lt;/a>; that Harris and Barnes were no longer working on the show. The article cited two sources who claimed that Harris “was let go after having trouble meeting script deadlines.” HBO insisted that he had not been fired. There had simply been creative differences, which were “part of the normal development process.” Harris, HBO added, “is a valued collaborator, and we currently have other projects in development with him.” (He is no longer on an exclusive deal with HBO but continues to work with the network.)&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I visited Harris, at his apartment, a couple of weeks later. It was a bright July day, hot in the sun but buoyed by a breeze. He answered the door wearing a long green terry-cloth robe, with dark polish on his fingernails. His young nephew had been wanting to paint his nails and was getting grief about it in his Southern milieu, Harris said, so he had painted his in solidarity. “Sometimes I think people don&#39;t want him to be a &#39;punk&#39; like Uncle Jeremy,” he said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The Daily Beast hadn&#39;t reported any details about Harris&#39;s approach to the “Vanishing Half” adaptation, but I had heard, from several friends, about a proposed scene in which a lot of feces is flung around. It sounded preposterous but not entirely unlikely. Harris, in his work, likes to explain drastic external action by way of uncomfortable, abject, and often lewd interior depths. His characters earn their brief glories after trudging through lots of shame; his people get splattered.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Harris seemed surprised that I&#39;d heard about the scene in such detail, but was happy to discuss it. He loved Bennett&#39;s book, but wanted to interpret it freely, even radically, something TV writers don&#39;t do enough, he said. One addition he and the writers envisioned was a surrealistic quasi-dream sequence that would send a character&#39;s consciousness “skipping like a stone across the waters of time,” as Harris put it in the show bible. The character would witness a “depraved ritual” meant to cleanse a small town of its communal sins, and the dark bacchanal would include “blackface masks, buffoonery and flying mud and feces.” It would end with “infidelities, thefts and dark family secrets ushered from the shadows into the light.”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;22nqj&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Harris was less annoyed by people gossiping about his work than by the suggestion, in the Daily Beast and elsewhere, that he wasn&#39;t a hard worker. “I&#39;m actually really insecure about that,” he said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;He was about to go abroad, and he wanted a new swimsuit for the summer trip; he&#39;d asked Emily Bode to design one for him. We walked to her small tailoring shop in Chinatown, where a board high up on a brownish wall announced the prices for alterations. Half-done garments hung on faceless mannequins.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;A tailor silently took Harris&#39;s measurements, then gave him the swimsuit that Bode had left for him to try on: a lime-green one-piece with thin tank-top straps and tight shorts. He had seemed sedate and almost tired in the apartment, but now his mood lifted. He retreated behind a curtain, then came out wearing the suit, hugging his thin body. It fit. He looked into a mirror and spread his arms. He was already smiling.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;One night last October, Harris went to the Brooklyn Academy of Music to see the renowned Belgian theatre director Ivo van Hove&#39;s adaptation of the novel “A Little Life,” by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/01/17/hanya-yanagiharas-audience-of-one&quot;>;Hanya Yanagihara&lt;/a>;. Harris is friendly with Yanagihara—he&#39;d spoken with her about acting in a possible TV adaptation of the book. He attended the play with an old roommate from his Yale days, Michael Breslin, who co-founded the theatre collective Fake Friends. Harris has co-produced two of the collective&#39;s shows: “Circle Jerk,” a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize for drama, and “This American Wife,” a harrowing parody of Bravo&#39;s “Real Housewives” franchise.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“A Little Life” centers on a group of friends in New York, one of whom, a saintly character named Jude, is repeatedly flayed by acts of unspeakable violence. Like “Slave Play,” the novel was dogged by accusations of sadism. After the show, Harris, who has cited the Marquis de Sade as a formative influence, chatted with his friends. They all agreed that some of the show&#39;s most excruciating scenes, which had provoked gasps in the audience, could have been, in keeping with the book, a bit more graphic.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Harris took a car home, stopping for a drink at a bar near his apartment. Writers—a species always overrunning those blocks, which have come to be called Dimes Square—spilled out of restaurants and sidewalk sheds. For a few minutes, cradling his drink, Harris argued amiably with a pop-music critic about the recently released movie “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-front-row/tar-reviewed-regressive-ideas-to-match-regressive-aesthetics&quot;>;Tár&lt;/a>;,” which Harris hated.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Back at his apartment, he ate and paced and talked—softly, because a friend, one in a rotating series of medium-term guests, was sleeping in the next room. Soon, Khosravi came home. Like Harris, he is tall and slender and demonstrative; subtle streaks of gray run through the ringlets of his hair. Unlike Harris, he seldom seems excited to argue. Before Khosravi, Harris had a boyfriend who broke up with him in part, Harris says, because of his sudden fame. “Arvand doesn&#39;t mind that I&#39;m a star,” he once told me.&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;a data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a24982&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a24982&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;“Take care out there today hon.

They were flying in the morning to a gala in Bentonville, Arkansas, at the Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art. Harris didn&#39;t seem stressed.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The next day, at the museum, as Harris wandered a room with paintings by Kehinde Wiley, Amy Sherald, and Kerry James Marshall, Khosravi surprised him by getting on one knee and proposing marriage. He&#39;d had a ring designed by a pair of jewellers who lived across the street from them in London and had become their friends. And he&#39;d asked the playwright &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/02/12/adrienne-kennedys-startling-body-of-work&quot;>;Adrienne Kennedy&lt;/a>;—a hero of Harris&#39;s, and now a frequent e-mail correspondent of his—to write a benediction, to be etched on the inside. It reads, “Happiness. Is. To me. Greatest Thing.” Harris said yes.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;A day later, he giddily recounted the proposal on Twitter, adding a pinch of social critique. “But someone, I guess I will?, needs to write about how cringe it is to be proposed to when you haven&#39;t been socialized to be waiting for it,” he wrote. “It&#39;s a really violent trap we set for both parties where you&#39;re asked to be in a play you know the script to and if you deviate from it 💔.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Harris&#39;s doomsaying in 2020—his sense that the gatekeepers were not doing enough to reimagine and thus preserve the world of theatre—has arguably been validated, in the worst way, in the three years since then. A wave of closures and layoffs has prompted a rash of op-eds about the future of the medium. Harris, as contrarian as ever, is not abandoning the theatre but, rather, becoming something of a gatekeeper himself: he has lately been, almost above all else, a facilitator of other people&#39;s work.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;He is currently the presiding playwright for the Yale Drama Series, a role that involves judging the program&#39;s annual prize. After he took the position, last year, he began conceiving a writers&#39; retreat for some of the prize&#39;s finalists—inspired, in part, by his experience at MacDowell. In March, he announced the inaugural Substratum fellows: four young playwrights who would spend a month at a medieval house, part of the hotel Monteverdi Tuscany, which, along with Gucci, would help cover the expenses.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;He was in Italy with the fellows when he got a text from the actress Rachel Brosnahan, who, along with Oscar Isaac, was starring in a revival of Lorraine Hansberry&#39;s 1964 play “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/03/13/sign-in-sidney-brusteins-window-theatre-review&quot;>;The Sign in Sidney Brustein&#39;s Window&lt;/a>;,” at &lt;em >;BAM&lt;/em>;. She hoped he&#39;d come see it. He said he was abroad, and asked if the play might be extended or transferred; she didn&#39;t think so. “I&#39;m going to get you to Broadway,” he replied. He phoned producer friends, and together they engineered a brief transfer to the James Earl Jones Theatre—another play set to open there had seen its financing collapse. The Hansberry revival wouldn&#39;t run long enough to turn a profit, but it would get a wider audience for a work by another of Harris&#39;s playwriting heroes. And the quick transfer suggested a different approach, perhaps, for Broadway: If space opens up, why not take a few chances?&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In August, Harris went to Great Barrington, Massachusetts, in the Berkshires, to spend two weeks acting in a movie directed by Pete Ohs, who edited the “Slave Play” documentary. Ohs makes largely improvised movies for twenty thousand dollars or less; the tiny budget meant that he could shoot without breaking the rules of the Writers Guild of America strike, which had begun in the spring and showed no signs of ending. The film was a country-house nightmare about contracting disease from deer ticks.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;The cast was staying at the house, which belonged to the actress Callie Hernandez, one of Ohs&#39;s collaborators. In the brightness of the afternoon, a wall of trees outside was variously green: dark pine, mild maple, vivid oak. Inside, James Cusati-Moyer, who was in “Slave Play”—his character, a gay man, refuses to describe himself as white—stood at the kitchen counter, mixing flaxseed, honey, psyllium husk, and cranberries in a steel bowl. He was making gluten-free bread, from a TikTok recipe. “You want a kind of cakey texture,” he said. “The woman in the video is incredibly annoying, but the bread is great.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The movie would begin shooting that night. Harris changed into a white linen caftan and went into town for groceries—he&#39;d volunteered to make dinner, for the second day in a row. He drives with a country boy&#39;s ease; he learned at fourteen, when his mother realized how impossible it would be for her to chauffeur him to all of his activities. He&#39;d already acclimated somewhat to the roads of Great Barrington, and to its local lore. “Birthplace of WEB DuBois,” he said. “They can&#39;t shut up about it—he&#39;s, like, the only Black guy they know.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Loping through the aisles at the grocery store, he picked up ears of corn with stringy husks and a pack of what he called “white-people aluminum foil,” packaged in a recyclable-looking brown paper box. He&#39;d begun writing a novel about a Black writer beset by deadlines and grief. Harris was very close with his mother&#39;s parents, who have both died in the past few years—his grandfather, Golden, died two weeks before “Slave Play” débuted on Broadway. “Writing isn&#39;t fun,” he said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;At lunch, in a small bakery across the street from a general store, he told me that his cash flow was slowing down as a result of the strike. “The other day, my niece asked me for a new phone, and I had to say no,” he said. “I told her, &#39;I&#39;m not trying to be mean—I&#39;m broke.&#39; ” He pays private-school tuition for her and his nephew; he bought a home, in Virginia, for his mom. He was worried about falling behind on payments.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;k3hwwg&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Back at the house, he enlisted his castmates as sous-chefs—chopping herbs, buttering corn—and began to cook. People were trying on clothes and critiquing the outfits. Would this work for the character? What else did it need? Cusati-Moyer was in a loose crop top. Harris loved it.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“I feel bloated from the bread,” Cusati-Moyer said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“You are,” Harris said, grinning.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“This is what he was like,” Cusati-Moyer told the others. “He builds you up and then he breaks you back down!”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Harris called his mom to ask her advice on the meal—pork chops, roasted corn, fried apples, all callbacks to his childhood. Should he melt the butter, put the apples in the cast iron, and &lt;em>;then&lt;/em>; pour the sugar in?&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“I don&#39;t know if you know this,” he told her, “but there&#39;s a white way to make this, where you don&#39;t just pour sugar.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Yeah, well, we make it the Black way,” his mom said. They talked about Harris&#39;s niece, and about the patterns his mom had begun to notice in her romantic life, and about literature. They sounded like siblings who take turns being in control.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;She said that she wanted to write a book about her life. “The best way to write is to read really good things,” Harris said. “You have to read this book by a French woman named &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/11/21/annie-ernaux-turns-memory-into-art&quot;>;Annie Ernaux&lt;/a>;. &#39;Happening.&#39; You&#39;ll really like it.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;He sat in the kitchen, with food in the oven and on the stove, steeling himself quietly for work later on, chatting with his mother. For a moment, his life seemed almost normal. ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 18 Sep 2023 19:06:01 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[How Thom Browne’s Gray Suit Conquered American Fashion]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/09/25/how-thom-brownes-gray-suit-conquered-american-fashion]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-18T10:00:00.000Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650367a2fd47431d5e50a6ab/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/230925_r43002.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;article >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attribute-verso-pattern=&quot;article-body&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;ArticlePageChunks&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Every new employee of the American fashion designer Thom Browne receives a “starter kit” of his brand&#39;s clothing worth some ten thousand dollars retail, including, among other items, two gray suits, five white oxford shirts, one gray wool tie, and one white pocket square. An eleven-page PDF lays out, through visual aids and bullet points, the rules for how to wear what Browne refers to as “uniform” (never “the uniform” or “a uniform”). Top buttons must remain undone. Shirts are not to be ironed. Neckties, a required accessory, should be tucked tightly into waistbands. Suit pants may be swapped out for a pleated skirt, regardless of one&#39;s gender; Browne, a proponent of androgynous dressing, has been putting men in skirts for more than a decade. Exceptions to the rules are doled out cautiously: the color navy is permitted Friday through Sunday but discouraged during the week; seersucker can be worn in the summer months, and white sneakers only on weekends.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;One afternoon in early July, I went to Avenue Montaigne, a luxury shopping promenade in Paris&#39;s Eighth Arrondissement, to visit Browne&#39;s French headquarters. In two days, Browne would, for the first time, present a runway show as part of Haute Couture Week. He was one of only a handful of American designers in the past fifty years to be invited to participate alongside such storied couture houses as Fendi, Chanel, and Schiaparelli. But the timing for a high-fashion pageant suddenly felt off. A few days earlier, a policeman had shot and killed an unarmed teen-ager of Algerian descent during a traffic stop in the Paris suburbs, sparking protests across the country. I had flown in on a red-eye expecting to find a city on edge. Yet on Avenue Montaigne the mood was serene. Pedestrians sauntered along a row of European flagship boutiques nestled in battlements of creamy limestone: Gucci, YSL, Prada, Louis Vuitton. At No. 30, Christian Dior occupied the same site where, more than seventy-five years ago, the designer unveiled his nipped-waist New Look silhouette. Browne&#39;s shop, at No. 17, is unmarked and open by appointment only, and when I saw the building, a blocky beige office tower that stood out from the elegant architecture like a bucktooth, I wondered if I was in the right place.&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;Thom Browne holding a ventriloquist&amp;#x27;s dummy.

One wore a suit paired with high-top lace-up brogues. Another was in seersucker shorts and a matching cinched waistcoat. The third had on a cropped cashmere vest over a sleeveless oxford shirt. The outfits were all variations on the archetypal Thom Browne ensemble: a “shrunken” gray suit with jacket sleeves that end above the wrists, lapels as thin and sharp as paring knives, and pant legs that are cut some three inches above the ankle, revealing what Browne likes to call “male cleavage.” (His preferred fabric is Super 120&#39;s wool twill in “medium gray,” a color that typically evokes the banal—pencil lead, gravel, wet cement.) The Thom Browne look has often been compared to Pee-wee Herman&#39;s archly nerdy costume or to Don Draper&#39;s office wear after a few rounds through the dryer, but it calls to my mind, too, some mischievous scamp out of a Roald Dahl book who is always conspiring to put a dead hamster in the headmistress&#39;s bed.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Browne, who is fifty-seven and launched his namesake ready-to-wear business twenty years ago, is hardly the first fashion designer to implement a dress code among employees—for decades, the Belgian designer Martin Margiela has required staff to wear long white coats, or &lt;em>;blouses blanches&lt;/em>;, at all times—nor is he the first to take a schematic approach to dressing his customers. Chanel&#39;s little black dress was, as &lt;em>;Vogue&lt;/em>; put it in 1926, a “uniform for all women of taste.” But, in an industry known for chasing novelty, Browne has built one of the most influential brands by iterating on a single idea. His deceptively humble goal is, as he regularly tells his staff, “to make the gray suit look interesting.” Once a menswear cult label, Thom Browne has in recent years become favored among celebrities who wish to signal that they&#39;re game for fashion risk-taking. In 2018—the same year the Italian textile juggernaut Zegna bought a majority stake in the brand, at a valuation of five hundred million dollars—LeBron James, a longtime fan, bought his Cleveland Cavaliers teammates matching Thom Browne suits to wear to playoff games. (The fashion critic Alexander Fury told me that Browne suits hold a special appeal among “big fucking straight men” who like the look of muscles bulging out of fine tailoring.) Browne has put the actor Oscar Isaac in a pleated skirt and the actress Christine Baranski in a corseted tuxedo. The members of boygenius, the queer-feminist supergroup, are currently channelling the early Beatles in custom Browne suits on their world tour. The musician Janelle Monáe, who identifies as nonbinary, attended this year&#39;s Met Gala in a Tim Burtonesque Thom Browne overcoat of black-and-white tweed that peeled off to reveal a giant sheer hoopskirt. Monáe told me, “In Thom&#39;s clothes I feel part of a species of people who are pushing culture forward.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;For the couture show, Browne had rented the Palais Garnier, the city&#39;s grand nineteenth-century opera house. His team had shipped the collection from New York in refrigerator boxes. On Avenue Montaigne, preparations were taking place in a temporary atelier two floors above Browne&#39;s permanent showroom. Fifty employees sat hunched over high tables covered in white cloth, furiously making final adjustments. Some were embellishing a blazer with hundreds of sequins no bigger than a freckle. Others worked on a long overcoat of dove-gray wool interlaced with rows of silver beads, mimicking the undulating texture of silk moiré. Across a hallway, in a makeshift photo studio and fitting room, a photographer was shooting a male model in a shale-colored “bell” gown. One of a dozen such looks in the collection, it had exaggerated mutton sleeves and a conical skirt; a three-piece suit was inlaid down the center of the garment, giving the impression of one outfit skin-grafted onto another. Every now and then, a muffled tinkling sounded from one corner, where Anna Scott, Browne&#39;s head of footwear, futzed with pairs of stilettos that featured brass bells on the heels.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;feature-large-callout&quot; >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;GroupCalloutWrapper&quot;>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;Every Thom Browne piece includes an accent of redwhiteandblue striped grosgrain as a nod to the ribbons on the medals...&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65039124ebce12b0b0432eed/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/230925_r43003_rd2.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65039124ebce12b0b0432eed/master/w_120,c_limit/230925_r43003_rd2.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65039124ebce12b0b0432eed/master/w_240,c_limit/230925_r43003_rd2.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65039124ebce12b0b0432eed/master/w_320,c_limit/230925_r43003_rd2.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65039124ebce12b0b0432eed/master/w_640,c_limit/230925_r43003_rd2.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65039124ebce12b0b0432eed/master/w_960,c_limit/230925_r43003_rd2.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65039124ebce12b0b0432eed/master/w_1280,c_limit/230925_r43003_rd2.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65039124ebce12b0b0432eed/master/w_1600,c_limit/230925_r43003_rd2.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;Every Thom Browne piece includes an accent of red-white-and-blue striped grosgrain, as a nod to the ribbons on the medals Browne won in his youth as a competitive swimmer.&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;A male ballet dancer wears a lavender sweater and skirt while balancing on the railing of a balcony.&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650368bc3731717dab8d71d2/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/230925_r43004.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650368bc3731717dab8d71d2/master/w_120,c_limit/230925_r43004.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650368bc3731717dab8d71d2/master/w_240,c_limit/230925_r43004.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650368bc3731717dab8d71d2/master/w_320,c_limit/230925_r43004.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650368bc3731717dab8d71d2/master/w_640,c_limit/230925_r43004.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650368bc3731717dab8d71d2/master/w_960,c_limit/230925_r43004.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650368bc3731717dab8d71d2/master/w_1280,c_limit/230925_r43004.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650368bc3731717dab8d71d2/master/w_1600,c_limit/230925_r43004.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;A look from Spring 2020.

I&#39;d worn shades of black and cream for my visit, but amid employees in uniform any color that wasn&#39;t gray seemed as obtrusive as flaming red. The British master milliner Stephen Jones, who makes headpieces for Browne&#39;s shows, noticed my baseball cap and asked, politely, if he might rid it of a smudge. Then he whisked it into another room to rub the brim down with a wet cloth.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Browne was standing in the middle of the fitting room, leaning against a marble table. He greeted me with a quick kiss on either cheek. Even in these surroundings, he stood out for the punctiliousness of his getup. He has a strong, square jaw and keeps his hair, now salt-and-pepper, in a tidy crewcut. He was wearing a tight sweater vest over his standard wrinkled oxford (“When everything is so well made, I think you need something that kind of throws it off a little bit so it&#39;s not so &lt;em>;precious&lt;/em>;,” he said of the wrinkles); on his muscular legs were snug wool shorts and a pair of Thom Browne knee socks. Browne&#39;s own approach to uniform is unvarying. A former swimmer, he runs eight miles a day; until a knee injury forced him to use a treadmill, he was known to jog around the Central Park reservoir in tailored shorts and a cashmere cardigan. Five years ago, he stopped wearing long pants altogether. He recalled that places like the Ritz in Paris and the Four Seasons in Milan used to give him a hard time for wearing shorts to dinner. “Now,” he said, “they always let me in.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Browne&#39;s runway presentations are known for their narrative sophistication, but his references, he told me, are often “more Bugs Bunny than Proust.” His settings are pulled from children&#39;s fables—an old-fashioned schoolhouse, an ice-skating rink, a pine forest filled with fake snow—often with a discomfiting twist. For his “Toy Story” collection, last year, he filled a room at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center with five hundred Steiff Teddy bears outfitted in his suits. A native of Allentown, Pennsylvania, Browne went to Catholic school until the seventh grade and served as an altar boy, and he has framed more than one collection around the theme of nuns and priests. For a show in 2012, he had his models emerge from coffins while a narrator told the audience that “they died for fashion.” Johnson Hartig, one of Browne&#39;s oldest friends and the founder of the fashion label Libertine, told me that although there is “something draconian and a little dystopian” about Browne&#39;s creative vision, “it&#39;s all done in a tongue-in-cheek, innocent kind of way.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;For the couture show, Browne had found inspiration in the opening lyrics of the song “Fade to Grey,” by the British New Wave band Visage: “One man on a lonely platform.” He described the show&#39;s protagonist, to be played by the Sudanese British supermodel Alek Wek, as “a girl who comes into a train station wearing a classic gray suit who is not so happy with her life.” The rest of the collection featured outfits representing various characters that the woman encounters on the railway platform, including luggage porters, gargoyles, a conductor, and a pair of high-fashion pigeons.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;One of the couture birds, played by a male model named Florian DesBiendras, wobbled in from the atelier in full costume, which included six-inch, heel-less cantilever shoes. Browne craned his neck. “God, you&#39;re so tall,” he said, giggling.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;For more than a decade, Browne has been in a relationship with Andrew Bolton, the head curator at the Metropolitan Museum&#39;s Costume Institute. When Browne was first developing the new collection, Bolton shared with him a time-honored rule of couture: garments should “look heavy and feel light.” The pigeon outfit consisted of a fitted turtleneck minidress made of a paillette fabric developed for Browne in Switzerland, and covered with hundreds of hand-tipped gray, green, and purple feathers. In a witty touch, a hand-felted skirt made to resemble a suit jacket was draped around the hips, with exaggerated shoulder pads that doubled as panniers.&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot;

Joining in, Browne put his hands behind his back and wiggled his fingers like tail feathers.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;mbq20g&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Later, Browne went over the show&#39;s soundtrack with his music supervisor. Along with the Visage song, the playlist included gloomy tracks from Björk and David Bowie and a pair of arias from the opera “Dido and Aeneas.” Browne likes to have his models walk slowly. Most fashion shows are under fifteen minutes; Browne&#39;s regularly go on for more than thirty. Critics sometimes complain about it, he said, “but I&#39;m, like, you know what? I spent so much on this. You&#39;re all gonna sit and enjoy it.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The music supervisor queued up the choo choo of a freight train, the clanging of an old-timey clock, and a chorus of pigeon coos. “Hey, I like to be cheesy sometimes,” Browne said. He had imagined sprinkling the stage at the Palais Garnier with handmade felt pigeon droppings—“They would have to be embroidered by Lesage,” Browne said, citing the legendary French needlework atelier—but had run out of time.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;It was &lt;em>;goûter&lt;/em>; hour in France. A publicist produced a spread that combined the glamorous and the mundane: a bottle of Dom Pérignon and a bag of plain potato chips. He poured the champagne into coupe glasses—Browne hates a flute—and the chips onto paper plates. Browne said that the idea for the combo had come from Marilyn Monroe&#39;s character in “The Seven Year Itch.” “Chips &lt;em>;always&lt;/em>; go with champagne,” he added, reaching for a plate.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Every Thom Browne piece includes a red-white-and-blue striped grosgrain ribbon as an accent, whether it&#39;s a tab hanging off the back of a collar or a ring encircling a shirt arm. It is meant as a throwback to the cheap ribbon necklaces on the sports medals that Browne won in his competitive-swimming days. The fourth of seven siblings from a tight-knit Irish-Italian family, Browne would wake up on school days as early as 4 &lt;em >;AM&lt;/em>;. to train. His younger sister Jeanmarie Wolfe recalled, “We all held each other accountable and we were all competitive, but we knew that Thom just had &lt;em>;it&lt;/em>;. We never worried about him. He always stayed the course.” (Today Wolfe, a lawyer in Allentown, wears head-to-toe Thom Browne to work nearly every day.) Browne became an all-American swimmer as a teen, and was recruited to Notre Dame&#39;s Division I team. “I grew up in a Speedo,” he recalled, when we met up in New York later in July, at Sant Ambroeus, an Italian café on Madison Avenue. “That regimen was always part of my day. I loved the organization of it, and the discipline.” Browne is still a creature of habit. Since he and Bolton moved to Sutton Place, on the far East Side, in 2021, he has gone to Sant Ambroeus each morning to pick up his to-go breakfast—a sugar croissant and an espresso. That day, he&#39;d agreed to dine in, at a red leather banquette. “This is new to me,” he said. His order remained the same.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Browne&#39;s father, James, a lawyer and accountant, worked at a financial-services firm and wore Brooks Brothers suits to the office. His mother, Bernice, who&#39;d met James in law school, stayed home with the kids and then, at fifty, passed the bar for a second time and went to work as a county solicitor. Browne thought he&#39;d follow a traditional corporate path. He graduated from college with a business degree and took a consulting job in New York City, but he hated it and quit in less than a year. Not long afterward, a friend, the British interior designer Paul Fortune, offered to let Browne stay in the guesthouse at his Los Angeles home. Browne took him up on the offer, and ended up living in LA for six years.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Fortune, who died in 2020, was known for his high-profile clientele—Sofia Coppola, Marc Jacobs, Aileen Getty—and for his patrician sense of style. Like Browne, he was a gay man who&#39;d gone to Catholic school. “He knew everybody,” Browne recalled. “And he had excellent taste. He was inspiring just to be around, to see how you could make your own life.” After two years, Browne moved into his own place, in Los Feliz. Many stories about Browne report that he spent his twenties as a “struggling actor,” but he laughed when I brought this up. He briefly studied with a drama coach and appeared in a few television ads. But he mostly supported himself as a production assistant and script reader. The one souvenir of Browne&#39;s short-lived show-business career, he says, is his British-seeming name. Because there was already a Tom Browne in the Screen Actors Guild, he started going by Thom.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Since his year in the corporate world, Browne had gravitated toward wearing suits—Brooks Brothers, like his dad. But in LA he began to develop a more distinctive personal style. He would scour vintage stores for classic men&#39;s pieces and have them altered at a local dry cleaner, raising the leg hems and truncating the sleeves. When asked about the inspiration for the look, Browne has cited memories of John F. Kennedy&#39;s slender suits. But in reality JFK often wore slouchy sack jackets and pants that broke over his shoelaces. The design “was this idea I had in my head, and I just had to get it out,” Browne said. He told me that he enjoyed the way his too-small suits “drove people crazy,” especially in laid-back LA He added, “I can&#39;t stand things that are very vanilla. I get bored by things that are just normal.”&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;A model poses in an elaborate blue gown while birds fly and perch around her.&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650368c2022245bfd87607b0/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/230925_r43009.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650368c2022245bfd87607b0/master/w_120,c_limit/230925_r43009.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650368c2022245bfd87607b0/master/w_240,c_limit/230925_r43009.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650368c2022245bfd87607b0/master/w_320,c_limit/230925_r43009.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650368c2022245bfd87607b0/master/w_640,c_limit/230925_r43009.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650368c2022245bfd87607b0/master/w_960,c_limit/230925_r43009.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650368c2022245bfd87607b0/master/w_1280,c_limit/230925_r43009.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650368c2022245bfd87607b0/master/w_1600,c_limit/230925_r43009.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;A “gargoyle” gown from Browne&#39;s couture collection features cascading layers of taffeta and satin.&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;p >;In 1997, he moved back to New York—“I had no money, and it was just scary,” he told me—and, through a friend, landed a job as a sales assistant at Giorgio Armani&#39;s wholesale showroom. Armani had revamped power suits in the eighties with loose, billowy silhouettes, and though the aesthetic wasn&#39;t to Browne&#39;s personal taste, he quickly became a top salesman. Around the same time, he befriended the designer Ralph Lauren&#39;s chief of staff and eventually met Lauren, who was looking for a new designer to develop menswear for his mid-level work-wear brand Club Monaco. Despite Browne&#39;s lack of training, Lauren hired him for the job. Browne tried to bring his own ideas to the brand—miniature cardigans, high-water pants—but “it wasn&#39;t right for them,” he recalled. “I couldn&#39;t give that stuff away. But I really loved it so much that I thought I should just be doing it myself.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Browne was not trained in sewing. To make suit prototypes for his own line, he needed to partner with an experienced tailor, but it was difficult to find one willing to use his bizarre specifications. After a stalled collaboration with a master tailor in Brooklyn, Browne connected with Rocco Ciccarelli, an old-school suit-maker in Queens, who agreed to make five sample suits (and went on to work as the head tailor for Browne until his retirement, in 2015). In 2001, at the age of thirty-five, Browne launched a made-to-measure business out of his one-bedroom apartment. He served as his own model, wearing the sample suits around town. He recalled that when he asked friends to purchase them “they were, like, &#39;Why would we want to buy something that doesn&#39;t even seem to fit &lt;em>;you&lt;/em>;?&#39; ”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Innovation in tailored menswear has historically taken place in what one critic described to me as “infinitesimal adjustments.” But by the turn of the millennium, with the rise in casual work wear, most men no longer had to buy a suit. The challenge was to make them &lt;em>;want&lt;/em>; to buy one, and designers were trying out increasingly daring ideas. Raf Simons, at his eponymous label, and then Hedi Slimane, at Dior Homme, produced sleek black suits that gave their wearers the look of louche indie rockers. Tom Ford, during his tenure at Gucci, introduced high-waisted velvet suits in sultry jewel tones. Browne&#39;s tapered design drew on codes of American conformity—the trope of the “man in the gray flannel suit”—but also quite literally undercut them. The result was something impish and a little bit kinky: all that male cleavage, out on display. Within the fashion world, Browne was initially considered an intriguing artist on the fringes. “It was &lt;em>;so&lt;/em>; small and &lt;em>;so&lt;/em>; custom and &lt;em>;so&lt;/em>; eccentric,” the veteran British fashion critic Tim Blanks recalled. “If somebody had told me this would be a half-a-billion-dollar business in twenty years, I would have laughed.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Browne gained an important ally when a friend introduced him to Miki Higasa, a brand strategist who&#39;d worked for Rei Kawakubo&#39;s avant-garde fashion house Comme des Garçons. Higasa had seen how a designer could make even the most challenging ideas legible to the public through repetition and persistence. She persuaded Browne to make a limited ready-to-wear collection in 2003, and soon afterward the operation moved into a small storefront in the meatpacking district. Higasa invited buyers to stop by, including Sarah Andelman, of the late trendsetting Paris boutique Colette, who placed an order for Browne&#39;s heavy oxford shirts and then, as she recalled, “had to keep reordering them.” A buyer from Bergdorf Goodman agreed to carry the collection. “They wanted to put it on the tailoring floor, and not on the third floor with the fashion,” Higasa recalled. “We said, &#39;This is not for the conventional guy.&#39; ”&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;a data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a27979-rd&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a27979-rd&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;“Hey its OK Frank.

He asked for a suit “exactly as I was wearing it, with no alterations,” Browne recalled; Bowie later donned it during a televised concert at Radio City Music Hall. Browne&#39;s look has since filtered into the mainstream. The rows of high-water pants in any Gap store owe a debt to his work, as does J. Crew&#39;s ubiquitous slim-cut Ludlow suit. Anna Wintour, the editor of &lt;em>;Vogue&lt;/em>; (and the global chief content officer of Condé Nast, the parent company of &lt;em>;The New Yorker&lt;/em>;), works closely with Bolton as the co-chair of the Met Gala and counts the couple among her good friends. She told me, of the Browne silhouette, “Now we accept it as being absolutely part of the fashion vocabulary. He completely changed the way we see.” One Browne staff member recalled that construction workers used to jeer at him when he walked down the street in his gray skirt. Today they just yell, “Hey, nice Thom Browne!”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;One of Browne&#39;s publicists had given me an official invitation to the couture show, which was printed on card stock as thick as a Wasa cracker and included a small square insert bearing the request “. 。 。 Please wear your best grey.” (Browne has a fondness for ellipses and prefers to spell “gray” the British way.) On the day of the event, the sky above the Palais Garnier&#39;s Beaux-Arts façade was a mottled, hazy apricot. Owing to the protests over the police shooting, armored guards stood around the building&#39;s perimeter. At the back entrance, I met one of Browne&#39;s lead publicists, Jonathon Zadrzynski—known as JZ—a skinny redhead wearing a full Thom Browne suit. I asked if he was roasting in the summer heat, and he shrugged. “We&#39;re used to it,” he said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Browne was inside in an airy rehearsal room with florid crown moldings and softly glowing globe lights. He stood quietly watching as two women added finishing touches to an ivory “gargoyle” gown that was hanging on a canvas dress form. There were two hours left until showtime.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;grat2t&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;“She wore gray!” Zadrzynski said to Browne, pointing to my outfit, a Rick Owens dress in a chalkboard hue.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;“And I thank you for that,” Browne said, flashing a smile. He walked over to another dress form to inspect a hulking trapezoidal blanket coat that his team had covered in ornate nautical embroidery—a sailboat, a lighthouse, conch shells, stalks of kelp. Sarah-Jane Wilde, a British American jewelry designer and former model, appeared suddenly from behind a rolling rack. “It&#39;s beautiful, Thom,” she said. A close friend and collaborator of Browne&#39;s, Wilde was wearing a custom black seersucker Thom Browne minidress with a matching cape. With her long black hair and her eyes painted with kohl and gold shimmer, she looked like a dapper Cleopatra.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“I&#39;m just here as a cheerleader,” Wilde said to me. “Thom kind of lives in his own world, of his own making. I call it the champagne bubble.” Glancing down at her outfit, she added, “That&#39;s why I&#39;d &lt;em>;never&lt;/em>; wear anything other than Thom. Why would you want to leave the bubble?”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Around the corner, in a hair-and-makeup room, the British makeup artist Isamaya Ffrench and her team were painting models&#39; faces with splotches of neon eyeshadow, inspired by Visage&#39;s New Romantic eighties look—the only pops of color in the show. Jordan Roth, a Broadway theatre producer and real-estate heir who had been cast as the other pigeon, sat in front of a vanity, sipping bottled water, as a makeup artist glued down his eyebrows. “The first piece Thom ever sent me was this exquisite &lt;em>;sculpture&lt;/em>;, with an hourglass shape and a codpiece,” he said. “The hyper-masculinized and hyper-feminized aspects went straight to my heart.” He swept one arm dramatically across the room. “It just makes sense that we are here now, because Thom is the &lt;em>;height&lt;/em>; of operatic fashion.”&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;A model dressed in red white and blue and holding an American flag emerges from a hole in the floor of an office.&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650368c83731717dab8d71d4/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/230925_r43008.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650368c83731717dab8d71d4/master/w_120,c_limit/230925_r43008.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650368c83731717dab8d71d4/master/w_240,c_limit/230925_r43008.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650368c83731717dab8d71d4/master/w_320,c_limit/230925_r43008.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650368c83731717dab8d71d4/master/w_640,c_limit/230925_r43008.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650368c83731717dab8d71d4/master/w_960,c_limit/230925_r43008.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650368c83731717dab8d71d4/master/w_1280,c_limit/230925_r43008.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650368c83731717dab8d71d4/master/w_1600,c_limit/230925_r43008.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;A look from Fall 2022. Browne&#39;s runway presentations are known for their narrative sophistication, but he describes his references as “more Bugs Bunny than Proust.”&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;p >;Guests had started to arrive, and some made their way backstage. Maisie Williams, a twenty-six-year-old British actress who played Arya Stark on “Game of Thrones,” carried an aquamarine Hector bag—one of Browne&#39;s most popular items, which is modelled on his eight-year-old dachshund of the same name and costs at least seventeen hundred dollars—and stroked it as if it were a real dog. Her outfit, a long pleated Wedgwood-blue skirt and boned corset, paired with a coördinating necktie, was the kind of thing a gentlewoman might once have worn to ride sidesaddle.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“I love the corset,” Williams said, placing a hand on her stomach, “because it&#39;s, like, nobody knows I just had a really big sandwich.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Browne had been calm through the previous days&#39; preparations, but as showtime drew nearer he seemed on edge. “Who is supposed to be watching you?” he asked a male model who was loitering out of formation in a bulky brocade jacket. He glanced at another model&#39;s latex thigh-highs, which were beginning to sag around the ankles. “Those don&#39;t look right,” he said. Wilde put her hands on my shoulders and gently steered me toward the exit.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Browne showed in Europe for the first time in 2009, at the venerated Pitti Immagine Uomo menswear exhibition, in Florence. During his presentation, which took place in the auditorium of a military school, forty men, all wearing cropped gray trousers and khaki trenchcoats and carrying black briefcases, walked out in single file and stood next to forty identical mid-century desks. A “boss” at the front of the room rang a bell, and the men sat down and began typing cacophonously on vintage Olivettis, calling to mind the opening scene of Billy Wilder&#39;s “The Apartment.” After several minutes, the men got up and each placed a red apple on the boss&#39;s desk.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Such imagery has led some observers to interpret Browne&#39;s collections as comments on American masculinity. Was Browne turning men into boys? Was he mocking the white-collar worker by making him look cramped in a suit he&#39;s on the verge of outgrowing? The fashion critic Cathy Horyn, writing about another of Browne&#39;s early runway shows, called him the “anti Ralph Lauren,” suggesting that whereas Lauren&#39;s vision of American life was expansive—Gatsbyesque gents in a classic roadster, a couple on a gleaming catamaran—Browne “seems to see a culture shrinking to the point of implosion.”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;feature-large-callout&quot; >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;GroupCalloutWrapper&quot;>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;A look from Spring 2020 features a starfish codpiece.&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6503912f107e3b742cc43d1d/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/230925_r43006_rd2.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6503912f107e3b742cc43d1d/master/w_120,c_limit/230925_r43006_rd2.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6503912f107e3b742cc43d1d/master/w_240,c_limit/230925_r43006_rd2.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6503912f107e3b742cc43d1d/master/w_320,c_limit/230925_r43006_rd2.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6503912f107e3b742cc43d1d/master/w_640,c_limit/230925_r43006_rd2.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6503912f107e3b742cc43d1d/master/w_960,c_limit/230925_r43006_rd2.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6503912f107e3b742cc43d1d/master/w_1280,c_limit/230925_r43006_rd2.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6503912f107e3b742cc43d1d/master/w_1600,c_limit/230925_r43006_rd2.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;A look from Spring 2020 features a starfish codpiece.&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;A model lies on the floor in a yellow beaded dress beside a large decorative swordfish.&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650368cd25274af116db7ff1/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/230925_r43007.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650368cd25274af116db7ff1/master/w_120,c_limit/230925_r43007.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650368cd25274af116db7ff1/master/w_240,c_limit/230925_r43007.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650368cd25274af116db7ff1/master/w_320,c_limit/230925_r43007.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650368cd25274af116db7ff1/master/w_640,c_limit/230925_r43007.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650368cd25274af116db7ff1/master/w_960,c_limit/230925_r43007.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650368cd25274af116db7ff1/master/w_1280,c_limit/230925_r43007.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650368cd25274af116db7ff1/master/w_1600,c_limit/230925_r43007.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;A gown from Spring 2019 evokes a mermaid with beaded shells at the bodice.&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Browne told me that he struggled, at first, to find a “balance between the conceptual and the commercial.” Menswear has experienced an “unprecedented boom” in recent years, according to Business of Fashion, an industry Web site. But by some estimates it constitutes only around thirty per cent of fashion-industry revenue. Menswear designers who want to expand their customer base—and who don&#39;t want to work for a legacy fashion house—often move into women&#39;s wear, accessories, fragrances, and other categories that make up a so-called life-style brand. Browne got a foothold in fashion&#39;s mainstream by collaborating with blue-blooded heritage labels. For five years, beginning in 2007, he designed a capsule collection at Brooks Brothers, called “Black Fleece.” The collection&#39;s suits, at around twenty-five hundred dollars, were almost double the price of the company&#39;s traditional suits (and about half the price of those made under Browne&#39;s own label). In 2009, Browne also designed a collection for the ski outfitter Moncler, featuring lapelled puffer coats and beanies in red, white, and blue. But in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis Browne&#39;s business almost collapsed, and he pivoted toward more traditional paths to financial stability. In 2011, with an investment from a Japanese wholesale distribution company, he launched his first women&#39;s line, with plaid skirt suits and grosgrain-trimmed capelets. His company now operates more than a hundred retail stores around the world.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Browne told me that he “hates trends,” but the ascendancy of his brand coincided with a revived interest in preppy style, spurred in part by the popularity of the TV shows “Gossip Girl” and “Mad Men.” Starting in the two-thousands, Polo Ralph Lauren and Lacoste saw a surge in sales, and J. Crew experienced a revitalization under the leadership of the designer Jenna Lyons (who wore Thom Browne to this year&#39;s Kentucky Derby). Like those brands, Thom Browne cannily drew upon the iconography of Ivy League style. From the beginning, as a nod to vintage varsity sweaters, Browne adorned many of his pieces with a trio of white stripes. When, in 2008, the sportswear giant Adidas sent him a cease-and-desist letter, accusing him of stealing its three-banded logo, Browne simply added a fourth stripe. (The problem seemed resolved until he launched a line of eight-hundred-dollar sweatpants and hoodies. Adidas sued for copyright infringement, in 2021, and lost a trial earlier this year. Browne made the news for wearing shorts every day to court.)&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;ma45hs&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Many wealthy consumers today have embraced “quiet luxury”; it is considered déclassé to use visible branding to prove that you paid thousands for your cashmere slacks. Thom Browne is as pricey as such understated brands as Loro Piana or Brunello Cucinelli, but Browne&#39;s designs are relatively aggressive about calling attention to themselves. Lauren Sherman, a fashion-industry correspondent for the media outlet Puck, told me that Browne&#39;s signatures have become as recognizable as the logos of far more profitable brands. “You know instantly when someone is wearing Thom Browne,” she said. The gray suit was once the ultimate cloak of anonymity. Browne has turned it into a badge of conspicuous consumption.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The couture show involved a clever bait and switch: guests were funnelled through the back door of the Palais Garnier and, unbeknownst to them, onto the main opera-house stage. The red velvet proscenium curtain was lowered. A large gray bell made of tulle and wrapped in red-white-and-blue grosgrain hung from the rafters, and several dozen felt pigeons were scattered around the felt-covered floor. On each seat lay a cigarette-size paper scroll, like the message a carrier pigeon might deliver, bearing the line “A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush . 。 .”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The actress Diane Keaton was seated in the front row, wearing a pale-gray Thom Browne three-piece with a matching bowler hat. (Later, in an e-mail, Keaton called the show “astonishing,” adding, “You know me, I love a man&#39;s suit.”) Emma Chamberlain, a Gen Z influencer, stood nearby in an écru Thom Browne laced corset, which she described as “not exactly comfortable.” She confessed that she was dying to take one of the stuffed birds home. “Pigeons are my favorite animal,” she said. “And rats.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;A few feet away, in a navy Thom Browne sheath dress, was the twenty-seven-year-old actress Ayo Edebiri, a star of the hit TV series “The Bear.” The show&#39;s creator, Christopher Storer, is a Browne devotee, and last season Edebiri&#39;s character, a professional cook, received a one-of-a-kind Thom Browne chef&#39;s jacket as a gift. Edebiri had told Browne how breathable it was underneath the hot lights of the set. “He thought that was really funny, because he was, like, &#39;I&#39;m not so known for making things that are functional,&#39; ” she recalled. (After the episode aired, Browne was flooded with requests for kitchen gear. “We&#39;re holding out for Jean-Georges,” he quipped.)&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The show was supposed to begin at five, but at twenty past guests were still milling about. A woman in uniform explained, “We&#39;re waiting for Cardi B. I guess she&#39;s stuck in traffic.” A few minutes later, Cardi made her entrance, wearing a tweed dress in a wiggle style and a foot-high gold filigree headdress. Soon the house lights dimmed. A swelling string overture played from the speakers, followed by a sound effect of thunderous applause. Then the curtain at the front of the room rose to reveal the two thousand red velvet seats of the opera house, each occupied by a cardboard cutout of a figure wearing sunglasses and a Thom Browne suit. The sea of deadpan faces was both spooky and hilarious—what better way to deliver a packed house than to print one? Audience members gasped and then began to applaud along with the soundtrack. Wintour told me later that she considered the stunt, which cost nearly a hundred thousand dollars, to be “one of the largest storytelling moments in Paris.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;During the next thirty minutes, more than fifty looks paraded down the runway. Alek Wek emerged first, wearing a plain Thom Browne suit and a head scarf. She sat onstage, on a piece of luggage, and remained there for the rest of the presentation, making eye contact with each model passing by. The collection was a kind of self-retrospective, but with Browne&#39;s usual motifs carried to elaborate extremes. A series of coats had a plaid pattern—a Browne staple—that was made not with preprinted fabric but by crisscrossing colored threads through tiny glass beads. His typically kitschy nautical themes were pushed into riskier, more grotesque territory. One striped blazer featured a puffy golden lobster whose embroidered claws came up over the shoulders, as if it were trying to drag the model underwater. Browne had strayed from his monochrome palette in previous collections—his 2022 styles included sumptuous evening jackets in mustard, lavender, emerald, and cantaloupe—but his couture looks were nearly all in shades of gray. The effect was to attune the eye to subtle contrasts—the way a gown juxtaposed shiny pewter satin with matte taffeta in a similar hue, or a pair of sequinned ombré trousers changed from charcoal at the hip to faintly ashen at the hem.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;feature-large-callout&quot; >;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;All Thom Browne employees must adhere to the persnickety dress code that Browne calls “uniform.”&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650368cf25274af116db7ff3/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/230925_r43005.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650368cf25274af116db7ff3/master/w_120,c_limit/230925_r43005.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650368cf25274af116db7ff3/master/w_240,c_limit/230925_r43005.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650368cf25274af116db7ff3/master/w_320,c_limit/230925_r43005.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650368cf25274af116db7ff3/master/w_640,c_limit/230925_r43005.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650368cf25274af116db7ff3/master/w_960,c_limit/230925_r43005.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650368cf25274af116db7ff3/master/w_1280,c_limit/230925_r43005.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650368cf25274af116db7ff3/master/w_1600,c_limit/230925_r43005.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;All Thom Browne employees must adhere to the persnickety dress code that Browne calls “uniform.”&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Couture shows traditionally end with the designer&#39;s take on a wedding gown. Browne&#39;s bride, the supermodel Grace Elizabeth, doubled as the train coming into the station. She glided down the center aisle, wearing a beaded, sheer white garment that looked like a tuxedo jacket whose hem was melting to the floor. Two men in swim caps carried the train of the dress. From far away, the piece shimmered as if made of shaved ice. Browne told me later that his team had worked eighteen-hour shifts for three straight weeks to finish it on time. In one hand, Elizabeth carried a large leather clutch in the shape of a steam locomotive. It was as if Browne were daring an overcooked gag—a train on a train on a train—to detract from the sombre mood of the proceedings. The fashion critic Amy Fine Collins told me afterward, “There are always moments in Thom&#39;s shows where you have to laugh. And typically you &lt;em>;never&lt;/em>; laugh at a fashion show.” (Browne told me that, beneath the gown, Elizabeth was wearing a pair of panties decorated with a bejewelled crab. “The joke is self-explanatory,” he said.)&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Some designers are interested in exalting the person wearing their creations. The late Alber Elbaz, who made elegantly draped women&#39;s gowns for Lanvin, said, “I&#39;m not trying to transform anyone, I&#39;m just trying to make everyone, as much as I can, a better version of themselves.” Browne, by contrast, has been criticized for his punishing demands on models—the impossibly high shoes, the agonizingly slow processions under heavy layers of wool. In the past, he has obscured models&#39; faces or tied their hands behind their backs. Browne told me, “Sometimes I like it when my clothes negate the person. Not because I don&#39;t respect the guy or girl wearing them. I do. But I really want to see a fully fleshed-out idea.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The morning after the show, Browne was back in his showroom on Avenue Montaigne to receive private clients. Compared with the lively makeshift atelier upstairs, the space was hushed and austere. Stepping off the elevator, guests were greeted with the scent of a single Thom Browne vetiver candle sitting on a teak desk. When I entered the display area, where the couture pieces had been artfully arranged on mannequins and rolling racks, an employee asked me if I wouldn&#39;t mind placing my handbag (gray, but not Thom Browne) in the back room.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;A man whom one employee called the brand&#39;s “biggest client in Mexico” came through, wearing a suit printed with a “Moby-Dick”-inspired toile, from the new fall ready-to-wear collection. Sharon Coplan Hurowitz, an art adviser and New York socialite, was there in jodhpurs, but the night before her ensemble had been more “Alice in Wonderland,” including a tilted-teacup headpiece by Jones balanced precariously atop her head.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Marisa Hunt, one of Browne&#39;s “client-relations managers,” arrived with Chris Sunahara, a thirtysomething Google executive and self-professed “Thom Browne obsessive” who was wearing a gray Browne suit with added tuxedo tails. Sunahara told me that he discovered Browne&#39;s suits after losing a significant amount of weight and feeling liberated to try new ways of dressing. “I remember thinking, OK, this stuff is expensive, maybe I&#39;ll buy a T-shirt,” he said. But the completeness of Browne&#39;s uniform can serve as a potent sales tactic. Doing it halfway would be more unfashionable than not doing it at all. “You have to have the shoes and the suit and the glasses—everything down to your feet,” Sunahara said. “That&#39;s how they get you.” In less than a year, he had bought more than sixty pieces.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Listen, as a gay male, you &lt;em>;dream&lt;/em>; of fashion, and I could never fit in this stuff,” he said, his voice growing shaky. “When you wear Thom Browne, you get so much attention, and it&#39;s kind of nice to give that energy when you walk down the street.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“That is making me feel all the feels,” Hunt said, handing Sunahara a coupe glass of champagne.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Sunahara approached an ivory gown that Browne had described to me as his “mermaid sashimi dress,” featuring metallic breasts and scales on the front and a jagged golden fish skeleton running down the back. I learned later that it was priced at sixty thousand dollars.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;51a6r5&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;“Oh, my God,” Sunahara said, passing his hand over the brocade. He asked if Browne might consider making a version for him with a six-pack instead of breasts. “Like a mer&lt;em>;man&lt;/em>;,” he added.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;He left the showroom empty-handed, but the next day he returned to order a new made-to-measure Thom Browne suit.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Despite living with an eminent fashion historian, Browne is not steeped in fashion history, and prefers it that way. He doesn&#39;t make mood boards for his collections, choosing instead to transmit his vision to his team through conversation. “Andrew approaches things very intellectually,” Browne told me. “I&#39;m more just instinctual.” At one point, remarking on the use of lobster imagery in his designs, I brought up Elsa Schiaparelli&#39;s famous 1937 lobster dinner dress. “I wish I didn&#39;t know about that,” Browne said, adding that he finds it “crippling” to be aware of what other designers have done.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Some critics have tried to dissect Browne&#39;s work in relation to his biography—his thigh-baring shorts as a queer statement, for example—but he resists such connections. “I love gay men, and straight men, and gay women, and straight women,” he told me. He tries to stay away from political debates as well. He dressed Michelle Obama for the 2013 Presidential Inauguration and said in 2018 that he would be equally open to working with Melania Trump. When I asked him about this comment, which provoked consternation at the time, he replied, “What I said was that I respect the office of the First Lady. I would hope most people are proud to be American.”&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;A plaid ensemble with feathered shorts from Fall 2011.&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650368d209d49c7c04e6daa1/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/230925_r43013.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650368d209d49c7c04e6daa1/master/w_120,c_limit/230925_r43013.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650368d209d49c7c04e6daa1/master/w_240,c_limit/230925_r43013.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650368d209d49c7c04e6daa1/master/w_320,c_limit/230925_r43013.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650368d209d49c7c04e6daa1/master/w_640,c_limit/230925_r43013.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650368d209d49c7c04e6daa1/master/w_960,c_limit/230925_r43013.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650368d209d49c7c04e6daa1/master/w_1280,c_limit/230925_r43013.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650368d209d49c7c04e6daa1/master/w_1600,c_limit/230925_r43013.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;A plaid ensemble with feathered shorts from Fall 2011.&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;p >;Browne&#39;s reticence can seem at odds with his growing public role in American fashion. Last January, he replaced Tom Ford as the chairman of the Council of Fashion Designers of America, the trade organization that represents four hundred US designers and oversees New York Fashion Week. When he first assumed his CFDA position, he sent out a note to his fellow-designers saying that although he supported their endeavors “in spirit,” he would not be attending any of their shows in person that season—he would be busy “challenging myself to create something memorable.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;One afternoon in August, I visited Browne and Bolton at their home, a Georgian-style mansion that was built a century ago for the heiress Anne Harriman Vanderbilt. I was greeted at the entrance by Browne and a fusillade of high-pitched barking from Hector, who was bounding around Browne&#39;s feet. The dog, who has his own Instagram account and often wears a miniature Thom Browne sweater, might be the most famous pet-muse in fashion since Karl Lagerfeld&#39;s cat Choupette.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“He&#39;s a real &lt;em>;schweetie&lt;/em>;,” Browne said, scooping him up and giving him a scratch on the chin.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Browne and Bolton&#39;s taste in décor is a mix of the ornate and the severe. When they renovated, they painted the bright-blue front door black. The foyer features a black-and-white marble checkerboard floor and a large bronze cupid sculpture by Augustus Saint-Gaudens. In the dimly lit dining room, paintings of Jesus and four decorative urns created the atmosphere of a rectory.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;We went out onto the back terrace, which overlooked an enormous lawn stretching down to the East River. From this angle, the water looked like a private lido. A publicist brought out several chilled mini-bottles of Perrier and crystal goblets engraved with the logo of the Ritz Paris.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Bolton, a native of Lancashire, England, is pale and trim, with floppy gray hair and angular cheekbones. His outfit had an air of après-tennis: a gray-and-white striped Thom Browne T-shirt with Browne sneakers and socks. As he sat down next to Browne, he noted, a bit sheepishly, that his shorts were Ralph Lauren. “I would say ninety per cent of my wardrobe is Thom,” Bolton said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Hey, I like the shorts,” Browne said. “I do think Andrew has good style. We reference it so often in the office—&#39;How would Andrew wear it?&#39; ”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Browne and Bolton first met at a fashion conference in 2005, but Bolton told me that he had been aware of Browne&#39;s work for some time before. “I was in London working on a project with Savile Row tailors, and I remember them being completely up in arms about him,” Bolton said. “I suppose the first I heard of Thom was as a travesty to tailoring.” He went on, “You know, I think that was sort of a homophobia, because at first it was so associated with fashionable gay men wearing this particular suit. Maybe it still is.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Like Browne, Bolton grew up middle class and had no education in fashion. He studied anthropology at the University of East Anglia and curated East Asian art at the Victoria &amp;amp; Albert Museum before arriving at the Met, two decades ago. More than one person I spoke to referred to Bolton and Browne as American fashion&#39;s reigning power couple, and it&#39;s clear that their positions reinforce each other; the Met Costume Institute&#39;s 2021 exhibition “In America: A Lexicon of Fashion,” curated by Bolton, included two Thom Browne suits in a pantheon of looks that have defined a national style. But the men told me that they still see themselves as industry outsiders and that their friends, for the most part, “are not fashion people.” They attend the Met Gala every year, but when I asked whom they like to entertain at home Bolton let out a small laugh. “No one,” he said. He recalled that when Wintour first came over she said, “Why did you buy such a pretentious house? You never have anybody over. It&#39;s just going to be you and Thom rattling around.” In their free time, the pair like to order in and watch old movies. (Neither likes to cook.)&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Many critics have seemed pessimistic lately about the state of the American fashion industry. Whereas New York was once a hub of global fashion—particularly in the eighties and nineties, when designers like Marc Jacobs, Donna Karan, Oscar de la Renta, and Calvin Klein were all showing in Manhattan—the industry&#39;s center of gravity has since shifted to Europe. The Row, New York&#39;s quintessential quiet-luxury brand, recently moved its production operations to Italy. Perhaps the buzziest show of the year, the American musician Pharrell Williams&#39;s début as the men&#39;s creative director for Louis Vuitton, took place on the Pont Neuf, in Paris. The US ecosystem “has taken a bit of a walloping,” Tim Blanks, the fashion critic, told me, adding, “When Thom first arrived on the scene, there was a real sense of dynamism, and I haven&#39;t felt that in some time.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Browne said that his goal with the CFDA was to guide young American designers toward thinking about “longevity,” as opposed to following flash-in-the-pan trends or the tides of social media. “The most important thing I can do is just lead by example,” he said, adding, “I didn&#39;t know how to sustain this business at the beginning, but then I did. And no one can really help you but yourself.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The two men showed me a forthcoming coffee-table book on Browne&#39;s work, edited by Bolton. He had spent a year pulling hundreds of looks from Browne&#39;s archive, and had written an introductory essay about the history of the color gray.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Andrew selected everything,” Browne said. “He said to me once, which I think is very true, that designers are the worst at curating their own work.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;He got up from the table, prompting Hector, who had been snoozing underfoot, to bolt upright.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Want to go out and bark, Hecky?” Browne said, moving toward the back door. “He&#39;s horribly trained.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“He &lt;em>;can&lt;/em>; be very friendly,” Bolton said. “When we are on the street, he always runs up to men in gray suits.” ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;feature-large-callout&quot;

>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;On a Saturday afternoon in August, while the Red Sox were trouncing the Yankees in the Bronx on the way to a series sweep, members of the Baseball Project, a supergroup that sings about baseball, were settling into the greenroom of the Sinclair, a small venue in Cambridge, Massachusetts, not too far from Fenway Park. The night before, they&#39;d performed in Brooklyn—Yankees territory, more or less. “They were yelling for &#39;The Yankee Flipper,&#39; ” Scott McCaughey, one of the band&#39;s guitarists and singers, said. He was referring to a ballad he wrote about the time Jack (Black Jack) McDowell, the former Yankees ace, got drunk with members of REM—including McCaughey and one of his Baseball Project bandmates, Mike Mills. “Sorry,” McCaughey joked in the greenroom. “We don&#39;t know how to play that anymore.” McCaughey is a Giants fan. “You get sick of hearing the Yankees doing so great all the time,” he said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“You don&#39;t have to worry anymore,” Linda Pitmon, a Yankees fan and the band&#39;s drummer, said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The Baseball Project also includes another former member of REM, Peter Buck, along with Steve Wynn, the singer and guitarist who leads the Dream Syndicate. The group was born at a party the night before REM was inducted into the Rock &amp;amp; Roll Hall of Fame, in 2007. Wynn recalled that he and Pitmon, who are married, met McCaughey there, and they started talking about their shared baseball obsession.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“I&#39;d met you before,” McCaughey interrupted.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“In the men&#39;s room in a Seattle club,” Wynn clarified.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Scott and I, each unbeknownst to the other, had the idea of someday writing a few songs or an entire album about baseball,” Wynn continued. They began to discuss it, and within a week they&#39;d swapped several songs. A few months later, they had a whole album, “Volume One: Frozen Ropes and Dying Quails.” That was fifteen years ago. In the meantime, REM broke up.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;The Baseball Project has just come out with its fourth album, “Grand Salami Time!,” produced by REM&#39;s old producer Mitch Easter and recorded at his compound in North Carolina. They play mostly on small stages, although they often throw out the first pitch or sing “The Star-Spangled Banner” before ballgames. When the group had a night off in Boston a few years ago, Josh Kantor, the organist at Fenway, who has toured with the band, took them behind the scenes of the Red Sox&#39; ancient bandbox. Pitmon rolled around in the warning-track dirt in front of the Green Monster.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“I was, like, &#39;Oh, man, what&#39;s it like to play at, you know, an eighty-thousand-seat football stadium?&#39; ” Kantor recalled asking Mills. “He&#39;s, like, &#39;What&#39;s it like to play at the World Series?&#39; And I was, like, &#39;Oh, right. That actually is really cool.&#39; ”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Mills once invited Kantor to join their fantasy team—they play in a league with other indie musicians, including Stephen Malkmus, from Pavement, and Ira Kaplan, of Yo La Tengo—but warned him that he would have to take it seriously. Kantor knew that Mills meant it, and declined.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;McCaughey usually wins the league, though every member of the band is competitive—except for Buck. “I&#39;ll be in the van back there, and it&#39;s like fantasy whatever—”&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;“Fantasy baseball,” McCaughey said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“ &#39;Oh, this guy has a &lt;em>;groin pull&lt;/em>;,&#39; ” Buck went on.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Buck doesn&#39;t follow sports. “He&#39;s our token non-baseball man,” Wynn said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“I like all these people and I like the songs,” Buck explained. He does appreciate what he calls baseball&#39;s “old characters”: “They were like Wild West gunfighters. They were weird, you know, in a way that&#39;s now impossible.” He went on, “They were like rockabilly stars or rhythm-and-blues stars, except that they were wearing a uniform and hitting a little ball.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;These days, the money is bigger and any weirdness is under wraps. The band doesn&#39;t shy away from the game as it is now—there&#39;s a song about Shohei Ohtani, and a sly take on doctored balls (“Just like Brylcreem, a little dab will do ya / I use that LA look to try and fool ya”)—but it can be a struggle to come up with material. “A lot of the current players are kind of boring,” McCaughey said. “They don&#39;t drink and carouse like they used to. I mean, probably for a good reason.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The big themes persist, in baseball and in music. Wynn was on a solo tour, staying in a run-down hotel outside Buffalo, when Buck sent him the music for the song “Journeyman.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“It was great music,” Wynn said. “I went, Yeah. A guy goes town to town, just does the best he can, and does something pretty well so he can keep working. And I can write a song like that.” ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;9wacu4&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;9vsaf&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 18 Sep 2023 19:06:01 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“Mom Rage,” Reviewed.]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/09/25/mom-rage-the-everyday-crisis-of-modern-motherhood-minna-dubin-book-review]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-18T10:00:00.000Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6500e99864406378c0ed5105/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/230925_r42988web-social.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;article >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attribute-verso-pattern=&quot;article-body&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;ArticlePageChunks&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;On September 13, 2019, Minna Dubin, a mother in Berkeley, California, published a brief, confessional &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/15/parenting/mother-rage.html&quot;>;essay&lt;/a>; in the &lt;em>;Times&lt;/em>;&#39; parenting section titled “&lt;em >;The Rage Mothers Don&#39;t Talk About&lt;/em>;.” Under the subtitle—“Mothers are supposed to be patient martyrs, so our rage festers beneath our shame”—there was a photograph, taken from behind, of a woman and a boy of two or three. They sat side by side on a shaded stoop, their arms linked, and seemed to be examining something in a shrub beside them. The boy was shirtless and had a small brown mark in the middle of his back. The top of his head was level with the woman&#39;s shoulder. Like many boys of his age, the bottom of his hair had grown longer and thicker than the rest of it, curling into a soft, wide triangle that sloped down his neck. At the moment the photograph was taken, he seemed to be readying himself to pull away—although it was impossible to know for sure.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The photograph, which Dubin supplied, was not in itself remarkable, but it gained a strange pathos from the essay that followed, which began: “The rage lives in my hands, rolls down my fingers clenching to fists. I want to hurt someone. I am tears and fury and violence.” These sentences were lurid, shocking in their directness and their extremity. What explained her rage? Her son would not get into the car, or eat the foods that she wanted him to eat, or let her brush his teeth. He bit other children. He ignored her. She yelled at him, threatened him, squeezed his arms, threw him in his crib, and wanted badly to hit him. She ate too many sweets and wandered the house, ashamed and lonely, whispering to stop herself from laying her hands on him: “Don&#39;t touch him, don&#39;t touch him, don&#39;t touch him.” But she was reluctant to speak to anyone, even her husband. “Mother rage is not &#39;appropriate,&#39; ” she wrote. “As if mother rage equals a lack of love. As if rage has never shared a border with love.” She sensed that her reactions were excessive, but she made no real effort to understand. Understanding was not the point of her essay. The point was to unleash the primal scream of a mother who had regressed—spectacularly, obscenely—into a tantrumming child, not unlike the three-year-old who had spurred her rage in the first place.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The tantrum had its desired effect; immediately, Dubin started to receive messages from mothers around the world. They confided that they, too, struggled with uncontrollable anger and that her story “made them feel less alone,” she reported. Her essay went viral when the &lt;em>;Times&lt;/em>; republished it, in April, 2020, weeks after the surge in &lt;em >;Covid&lt;/em>;-19 cases prompted many governments to close schools. Parents struggled to work from home and care for their children, who were suddenly underfoot all the time; households everywhere grew isolated yet overcrowded, overstimulated yet bored, and exceedingly agitated. “Between stay-at-home orders, &lt;em >;Covid&lt;/em>;-19 health concerns, financial instability (or fear of it), and police violence against Black people, it is no surprise that mothers are experiencing intensified rage,” Dubin wrote, in a follow-up essay that was published in the &lt;em>;Times&lt;/em>; on July 6, 2020, with the headline “ &#39;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/parenting/mom-rage-pandemic.html&quot;>;&lt;em>;I Am Going to Physically Explode&#39;: Mom Rage in a Pandemic&lt;/em>;&lt;/a>;.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;GenericCallout&quot;>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;external-link-embed--inline&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;a aria-label=&quot;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;The Best Books We Read This Week&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.newyorker.com/best-books-2023&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/best-books-2023&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;&lt;span >;&lt;strong>;The Best Books We Read This Week&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/a>;&lt;p >;&lt;em>;Read our reviews of notable new fiction and nonfiction, updated every Wednesday.&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;a aria-label=&quot;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;The Best Books We Read This Week&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.newyorker.com/best-books-2023&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/best-books-2023&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/63c800e4e99d89b838ada996/1:1/w_200%2Cc_limit/undefined&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/63c800e4e99d89b838ada996/1:1/w_120,c_limit/undefined 120w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/a>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;The artlessness of Dubin&#39;s essays made them tremendously gripping—so gripping as to deflect certain intellectual and ethical questions that readers might have asked of her central concept, “mom rage.” It was a term that Dubin had adapted from a 1998 essay by Anne Lamott, called “Mother Rage: Theory and Practice.” Whereas Lamott&#39;s essay was a self-deprecating, mock-scholarly comedy about parenting, Dubin presented mom rage as a solemn social diagnosis. But what was “mom rage,” exactly? How did it differ from related diagnoses, such as anger issues or impulse-control disorders? More sensitive questions suggested themselves, too. How reliable was Dubin as a narrator? Did the photograph on the stoop suggest that this tender moment was the prevailing reality of her life, and that her rage was secondary? Or was the rage hiding in plain sight, coursing beneath the surface of even this placid scene? And what about her son? The photograph showed two subjects, an Everymother and an Everychild, but in the essay only one could have a voice. The silence of the child was easy to overlook when the speaker insisted that it was her speech that had been silenced, and that her confession defied a powerful taboo. But who enforced this taboo? In the twenty-first century, in the city of Berkeley, California, who was it that expected a mother like Dubin to “say nothing” about her frustrations or to be “martyr-like” in her behavior?&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Melodramas of oppression and resistance do not brook much nuance, and, in any event, it can be difficult to insist on ethical complexity when faced with a story that resonated with many readers. The two essays seeded “mom rage” as a new idiom that parents, psychologists, educators, wellness coaches, bloggers, podcasters, and television personalities increasingly deploy to map the explosive emotional terrain of motherhood. “We Should Be Normalizing Mom Rage” insisted a 2022 headline on the Web site Parents.com, which defined mom rage as “the uncontrollable anger mothers can experience that leads to verbal and /or physical explosions” and attributed it to a “lack of self-care,” “little support,” and a “raging pandemic.” Other commentators were quick to agree: “Mom rage is a real thing”; “Mom rage is real”; “Mom Rage Is Not Your Fault”; “I&#39;m Raging, You&#39;re Raging.” In the slightly aggressive, slightly insecure posture of these essays, one could detect a plea for legitimacy that doubled as a plea for absolution. A bargain, it seemed, was being negotiated: If we, the readers, could accept the reality of “mom rage” as a phenomenon that originated somewhere outside of, or beyond, the individual&#39;s control, then they, the writers, the mothers who yelled and threatened and handled their children roughly, could be freed from their self-doubt and remorse.&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot;

The first half of “Mom Rage” squats at the intersection of these genres. The anger of mothers is overdetermined by the “white supremacist, homophobic, classist, ableist, xenophobic, transphobic, misogynistic, capitalist patriarchy,” Dubin writes. The capitalist patriarchy props up the ideology of “capital-M Motherhood,” which “tells mothers we must throw ourselves full throttle into our mothering job—researching, planning, contacting, scheduling, overseeing, washing, tidying, folding, driving, thanking, inviting, hosting, cooking, preparing, and sharing.” Rage is simultaneously “a natural reaction to being systematically stripped of one&#39;s power” and a source of “power in its potential for individual and cultural change.” The remedies Dubin proposes range from state-subsidized child care to communal parenting, art-making (“I recommend the transformative power of creative practice,” she writes), and non-normative sexual arrangements (“I also recommend queerness”).&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Dubin&#39;s claims and prescriptions are, by now, staples of pop-feminist nonfiction. Such personal essays and polemics are built on the foundational arguments of an earlier generation of feminists—among them, Silvia Federici, Mariarosa Dalla Costa, and Selma James—who, in the nineteen-seventies, argued that capitalism&#39;s emphasis on waged work outside the home occluded the unwaged work of housewives and mothers. It is a measure of how influential such theorizing has become that this proposition, once radical, is almost received opinion among a new crop of cultural critics. But, by the same token, the newer books—call them “feminish”—engage only sparingly with the original sources. Reading paraphrases of paraphrases of paraphrases, one starts to feel as if there is something a little hollow and shiftless about the ease with which phrases such as “white supremacist, homophobic, classist, ableist, xenophobic, transphobic, misogynistic, capitalist patriarchy” are trotted out. We get the right words, strung together like marquee lights, but not the structural analysis that puts them in relation to one another.&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;As in Dubin&#39;s first essay, much of “Mom Rage” is memoiristic, with long indignant riffs about her experiences living in the Bay Area with her husband, parenting their son (who is now nine) and their five-year-old daughter. Her story is bolstered by the testimony of fifty mothers whom she interviewed for the book and who all “identify as having mom rage.” They comprise a racially and economically diverse group—Frannie is a “bisexual Taiwanese Canadian mom of two tweens,” Ceci is “a Mexican American paralegal”—but they are troublingly homogenous from a methodological point of view. Dubin does not appear to have interviewed any mothers who do not claim to suffer from mom rage. Nor has she interviewed fathers, rageful or otherwise, a renegade pack of mansplaining, gaslighting, happy-go-lucky ne&#39;er-do-wells. “Fatherhood is a side gig,” she writes. “In Western culture, fathers get to be anything they want.” A tiny bit of feminist theory might have complicated this claim—after all, the exploitation of women in the home is bound up with the exploitation of men at work—but it plays little role in “Mom Rage,” despite brief cameos by Adrienne Rich and Audre Lorde. Nor does Dubin consider literature, in which tales of angry, ambivalent, thwarted, and narcissistic mothers constitute a formidable canon of their own, beginning in 431 BC, with Euripides&#39; Medea and extending to Elena Ferrante&#39;s Leda, in “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Lost-Daughter-Novel-Elena-Ferrante/dp/1609457692&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Lost-Daughter-Novel-Elena-Ferrante/dp/1609457692&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Lost-Daughter-Novel-Elena-Ferrante/dp/1609457692&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;The Lost Daughter&lt;/a>;,” the subject of a recent essay in the Cut (by another mother of two) titled “The Perpetual Rage of Motherhood. ”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Absent history or culture, every feeling in “Mom Rage” is negotiated on the terrain of power: who has it, who wants it, and who is denied it. Occasionally, power is rooted in a set of concrete practices and institutions, as in Dubin&#39;s spirited discussion of hospital-based maternal health care. More often it is an atmospheric phenomenon, a feature of abstract entities, such as “the powers that be (the white supremacist, capitalist patriarchy),” or metaphors, such as “Motherhood&#39;s PR team.” No doubt the patriarchy and capitalism have power, but how precisely that power results in the rage of mothers toward their children, as opposed to their husbands or their bosses, remains unclear. (The powerlessness of children relative to parents is never considered, but it is the anchor of Lamott&#39;s original article: “One reason I think we get so angry mad at our children is because we can. Who else can you talk to like this?”) No doubt, too, the ideology of Motherhood is diffuse and compelling; as Dubin points out, more than half of Americans believe children are better off when their mothers do not work outside the home, while only eight per cent believe the same about fathers. But what does it mean to claim that its “ideas are in the water we guzzle every day?” Water does not have any ideas swimming around in it, let alone the ideas filtered in by Motherhood&#39;s PR team, which, as Dubin acknowledges, also does not quite make sense, either literally or figuratively. “The PR team?” “What even &lt;em>;is&lt;/em>; that?” she asks at the end of the chapter devoted to explaining it.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;The imprecision of Dubin&#39;s language strands her argument on unstable ground. Often, one wonders if what is truly at stake for her is not a dramatic political battle between the oppressors and the oppressed but a quieter struggle between personal freedom and unfreedom:&lt;/p>;&lt;blockquote >;&lt;div >;&lt;p>;Pre-motherhood I was slippery, a thousand tiny, silver fish—a woman, a writer, a friend, an educator, a queer person, a performer, a Philly girl, a Bay Area transplant, a wife, a lefty Jew. With nothing to lose, no property, no fancy job, no kids, I was a flight risk. I could do or say anything. But now that I have children, I can&#39;t stray too far, mouth off too much. There are children to consider! To feed. To pick up from school. Mothers have obligations, schedules, other people to put first. My name has been erased, and I&#39;m reduced to one role, one thing.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/blockquote>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;a6gks5p&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;duith8&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;One of the difficulties of being a parent, as Dubin intuits, is that it orients you to others in a knotty, demanding way. There are moments when I fantasize that, one day, my children will ask me the question that Henry James&#39;s Isabel Archer asks Madame Merle, the woman who has puppeteered her into making the decisions Isabel believes she has made of her own free will: “What have you to do with me?” To which I would respond, as Madame Merle does, “Everything”—but also, “Nothing.” Your child is and is not an extension of yourself. He is both an intimate and a stranger. He imitates you and he rejects you, and it is not always possible to anticipate which gesture is more startling. You can attempt to control what he does, to a point, but you cannot control what the world does to him, or how he responds to it. What we learn from our children is nothing less than our own limitations—our passivity and our susceptibility when faced with what was once a part of us, but is, ultimately, other to us.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;From this baffling relationship between self and other there can emerge an ambient feeling of unfreedom. The great responsibility and the great vulnerability of being a parent can be unsettling for one&#39;s identity, in the past, present, and future. It can be difficult to recall with any certainty who you were before you spent so much of your time wondering, ruminating, fretting, or catastrophizing about another person. If, like Dubin, you are relatively privileged, you know that you have chosen your unfreedom. Yet you may still feel that you did not choose to bind yourself to these people, these intimate strangers, or to this whole life. By this logic, the entire atmosphere of parenthood, no matter how privileged it may appear from the outside, can come to feel like “a scam,” as Dubin puts it. And the decision not to make lunch can seem like the ultimate horizon of liberty.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Acceptance of the fact that parenthood necessitates the relinquishment of various freedoms would seem to be one of its central features. “Selfish,” one of my favorite stories by Lydia Davis, captures this peculiar state by evoking a parent who thinks, “The useful thing about being a selfish person is that when your children get hurt you don&#39;t mind so much because you yourself are alright.” The story is structured around a painful irony. Its narrator does not tell us that she is a selfish person, only that it would be useful for “you,” a parent, to be one. We sense that the narrator is not a selfish person and is not all right when her child gets hurt; that a selfish person would not possess the insight to write these lines in the first place. And we sense, too, that it would be foolish to believe that a parent could simply choose to be a selfish person—that as a state of being it exceeds conscious choice, just as it very likely exceeds all the cultural and social changes that might improve the conditions of mothers. A mother&#39;s vulnerability to her children cannot be redistributed with the same exactitude that her work can be. Neither free day care nor a night off from doing the dishes can inure her to how her child&#39;s pain can, by shaping his identity, shape hers.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Dubin is not really imagining the freedom to be more than “one thing” but the freedom to run away from this bind and into the arms of nothing—no fixed roles, no lasting responsibilities. This is a negative freedom that does not expand one&#39;s sense of self so much as shrink it to pure potentiality. But you cannot live in potentiality forever. If spouses and children do not get in the way, then time will. In its purest and most personal moments, Dubin&#39;s rage seems like grief for the future, which is available to her children in a way it will never again be available to her.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Although rage is the passion that gets top billing in the book, it is made to share the stage with another feeling: shame. Shame is simultaneously the cause and the effect of rage. “Society punishes angry women and shames mothers who step out of their domestic box of caregiving,” Dubin writes. If the shame of not living up to the ideals of capital-“M” Motherhood causes mothers to rage, then it also causes them to stay silent, lest they articulate a greater and deeper shame: that they really are a “bad mom.” “Shame” and its variants appear with greater frequency as “Mom Rage” shifts into its second half, which looks to the genre of self-help to break the “Mom Rage Cycle” and, with it, the “Shame Spiral.” “Self-isolation is a key component of the Shame Spiral for me,” Dubin writes. “I am so deep in my own sorrow and self-hatred after a rage, I have a hard time reaching out to friends.”&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot;

writes. Sedgwick, who was also one of the great theorists of shame, saw the relationship between mother and child as a model for the isolation (and, more surprisingly, the possibility of intimacy) that shame can produce. The hot blush or the averted gaze that arises when a mother shouts at her child are “semaphores of trouble,” the outward signs of a breach in their intimacy that has caused them to shrink from each other and into their innermost loneliness. At the same time, these visible responses are invitations for the mother and child to repair their relationship. They can make it anew with an apology or an embrace—and, in doing so, they can make themselves anew, with a deeper understanding of their identities as both linked and separable beings.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Shame is a peculiarly contagious emotion. Like secondhand smoke, it can cling to you from great distances, both literal and metaphoric; consider, for instance, the simultaneous urge to look and to look away that you might feel watching a mother yell at her child in the supermarket, even if the mother and child are completely unknown to you. “One of the strangest features of shame,” Sedgwick writes, “is the way bad treatment of someone else, bad treatment &lt;em>;by&lt;/em>; someone else, someone else&#39;s embarrassment, stigma, debility, bad smell, or strange behavior, seemingly having nothing to do with me can so readily flood me.” For Sedgwick, shame&#39;s capacity to disrupt our sense of identity, by filling us with feelings on behalf of another person, gives it a potentially political dimension. It can be a spur to altering conditions that are abject, embarrassing, and exploitative—not only for ourselves but for others. Attending to shame within the context of a parent-child relationship offers a model by which we may learn to relate to others by learning to perceive them as both similar to and different from ourselves.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Dubin deliberately foregrounds examples of her treatment of her son that may leave one feeling flooded by shame; when, for instance, he goes limp while they are crossing a busy intersection, and, once they reach the other side, she pushes him, causing him to hit his head on the sidewalk. Yet her insistence on not feeling shame short-circuits her acknowledgment of her son&#39;s discreteness from her and robs them both of the opportunity to remake their relationship. Indeed, a perplexing lack of intimacy characterizes her descriptions of her son. In her first &lt;em>;Times&lt;/em>; essay, he was nonspecific, a typically rambunctious three-year-old boy. “His behavior is age-appropriate,” Dubin reassured the reader (and herself). “All kids test limits.” In the book, her son has a name, Ollie, and he is no longer the Everychild she previously presented. Dubin introduces him through his diagnoses: a sensory-processing disorder, fine and gross motor delays, food rigidity, and autism-spectrum disorder. Once we learn this, her mom rage reads differently, as the reaction of a parent facing more than run-of-the-mill challenges. Alarmed by Ollie&#39;s uncomprehending reactions and emotional blankness—“His silence infuriated me,” she writes—she screams and tries to frighten him. Staging these scenes allows her to capture him through his physical responses to her. We learn about his “chubby, tear-streaked face” and the “doughy hugs” he offers to appease his mother. “Between genetics and autism, Ollie never really had a chance,” she writes, and, although the sentence is specific to his challenges with potty training, it is difficult not to hear in it a more general lament or judgment.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;j0pkr&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;“Moms of sick, disabled, or neurodivergent kids all have increased stress levels that make them more prone to mom rage,” Dubin observes. Such stress cannot be underestimated, but the specificity of Dubin&#39;s experience presents a problem for her thesis. Even if we accept her argument that “white supremacist, capitalist patriarchy” shapes the conditions of contemporary motherhood in profoundly unjust ways, it is clear that this is not the whole story of her rage. The book fails to universalize a particular predicament, and, in strenuously attempting to do so, turns into an exercise in ill-advised candor. There are times when one wants to shield both Dubin and her son from such exposure, and times, too, when one feels rage toward Seal Press, which should have used better editorial discretion with a first-time author. Aptly enough, the fortunes of Seal Press echo, in a way, the current mainstreaming of feminist theory in nonfiction publishing. Founded by two feminists in a Seattle garage in 1976, it has now, after a sequence of corporate acquisitions, ended up as an imprint of Hachette, one of the world&#39;s largest trade publishers, which is apparently happy to pass off the book as a “groundbreaking work of reportage” by dressing it up in the flimsiest fashions of pop feminism.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Whereas the photograph that ran with the essay showed us a nondescript still of tenderness, “Mom Rage” offers close-up footage of unstable moments; of reflexive action and reaction in the exhausting, relentless years of early parenthood; of panic dissolving into rage and shame, yes, but also into fear. “&lt;em>;No. No! This is&lt;/em>; &lt;em >;NOT&lt;/em>; &lt;em>;happening again!&lt;/em>;,_ _” Dubin thinks as she reads a letter from her son&#39;s preschool teacher informing her that the school is no longer a good fit for him. A similar emotion surfaces when she sends him to camp: “I could feel every inch of my skin prickle as the counselor spoke and the story of Ollie&#39;s behavior unfolded.” She is frightened for her son, who must learn to exist in a world in which his well-being means less to everyone else than it does to her. Every parent can understand this.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;There are scenes scattered throughout “Mom Rage” when Dubin&#39;s gaze widens beyond the mother&#39;s point of view. In one of them, Dubin&#39;s son and daughter have been tussling over the bathroom door, her on one side of it, him on the other. He pushes too hard, and she falls back and hits her head. Dubin is about to bellow but then stops. Instead, she looks closely at her son: “I recognize regret and sadness in his wet, almond eyes, mirror images of mine. I take a slow breath and see that his heart is just like my heart—full of self-punishment. I open my arms to him and say no words at all.” She closes the chapter by describing a piece of scrap paper with two sentences written on it that, for a time, she kept in her purse to remind her of this moment. The first sentence read, “Ollie is a four-year-old boy, and he is good.” The second read, “I am a thirty-five-year-old woman, and I am also good.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The mother and child&#39;s silent embrace is the ideal image of intimacy renewed. It is the closest Dubin comes in the book to the tender mood of the photograph, and it will soften even readers who have hardened to her extravagant performance. And yet it is difficult to accept it as proof of understanding. At such a pivotal moment, one would expect the language of recognition to be slightly more imaginative and precise, not his eyes are “mirror images of mine” or “his heart is just like my heart.” How clearly can a writer see anyone or anything—her children or the social and political contours of motherhood—when she perceives everything through the haze of moral cliché? “&lt;em>;My boy&lt;/em>; &lt;em >;IS&lt;/em>; &lt;em>;good!&lt;/em>; I wanted to scream. &lt;em>;He&#39;s&lt;/em>; &lt;em >;GOOD&lt;/em>;&lt;em>;!” “Please&lt;/em>; &lt;em >;SEE&lt;/em>; &lt;em>;him! See his good self&lt;/em>;,” Dubin pleads. It is wrenching to witness how much she needs others to affirm that both she and her son are good, instead of understanding how they can be good to, or good for, each other. And it is unsettling to realize that she is incapable of seeing him or herself clearly—that careless prose can narrow the terrain on which a person encounters others and interrogates her own desires.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Dubin never relinquishes the language of morality. She cannot; her book has promised universal absolution and universal absolution it must deliver. “&lt;em>;You are a good mom&lt;/em>;,” she assures the reader in the book&#39;s last line. But to liberate parents from shame like this is every bit as moralizing an act as scolding them would be. Both acts situate the writer on a plane of judgment above the reader, reducing the reader to an extension of the writer&#39;s values. The question “How can she be sure that I am a good mother?” can only be answered with another question: “Does she care who I am?” The writer gets to play out a fantasy of the infinitely benevolent mother by casting the reader in the role of the child, desperate for forgiveness. Yet what the reader really seeks from the writer, and what the child seeks from his mother, is not a moral sentence. It is an ethical point of view—the attentiveness and the curiosity borne of the clear-eyed recognition of both self and others. ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;h03fm&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 18 Sep 2023 19:06:01 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
