data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;在安妮·贝克 (Annie Baker) 于 2017 年创作的冷酷讽刺剧《The Antipodes》中，剧作家花了一些时间为电视，向我们展示了她版本的地狱。它看起来很像洛杉矶的作家室，一桌七名男人和一名经常被打断的女人通过转述自己生活中的亲密轶事来产生情节想法。娱乐业对叙事的胃口是无底洞的，随着编剧不断提供私人故事来满足这种胃口，自动蚕食开始出错。外面升起一场圣经风暴，现实裂开，就像贝克戏剧中有时会发生的那样，让不可思议的事情发生。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;贝克的最新喜剧，备受期待和大流行延迟的“无限生命，在大西洋，与《Antipodes》完全相反：干旱，2017 年的戏剧被洪水淹没；主角大多是女性，还有一个象征性的单身男性。这也是对她早期恐怖讽刺作品中关于艺术苦难的问题的令人惊讶的真诚甚至热情的回答。在旧金山北部的一家诊所，病人正在禁食，以阻止正在吞噬他们的疾病——癌症、慢性莱姆病。当他们挨饿时，他们的新陈代谢会减慢，对某些人来说，他们的症状会消退。 《对映体》和《无限生命》都是贝克思考苦难的起点，但是，尽管它提到了地狱之火般的痛苦，《无限生命》并不是地狱。没有任何东西可以生长，所以没有东西可以死亡。死亡率处于搁置状态。这家诊所对于病人来说是炼狱，但它也是一种奇异的伊甸园。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;并不是说它很茂盛。 “天堂”一词源自波斯语，意思是“有围墙的花园”，在詹姆斯·麦克唐纳的精美作品中，由集体点设计，重点是墙壁。一个摆满躺椅的砖砌露台靠在一条带有风格化花卉图案的混凝土砌块走廊上——让人想起六十年代的汽车旅馆和摩尔式庭院——而露台本身又靠着土坯墙。在《无限生命》的大部分时间里，我们都在看着五位女性在这些躺椅上等待接受治疗。 （人们可能会想起 2016 年卡里尔·丘吉尔 (Caryl Churchill) 执导的后世界末日电影《独自逃亡》(Escaped Alone) 中的一排坐着的女性，这部电影也是由麦克唐纳 (Macdonald) 执导。）她们拿着水瓶、几本书，以及随之而来的奇怪、滑稽的清晰度。几天没吃东西后。他们每个人都有一个看不见的伴侣——痛苦难以形容，他们只能谈论其他事情。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;四十七岁的索菲（克里斯蒂娜·柯克，声音中带着抱怨）正在直播。当戏剧开始时，她是禁食的第一天；当戏剧结束时，她将在演出结束后前往机场。由于她的经历是戏剧的时间框架，因此她还负责在时钟向前跳动时通知观众。 “二十分钟后，”索菲一边宣布，一边将目光转向我们。或“七小时后”，伊莎贝拉·伯德 (Isabella Byrd) 设计的灯光从接近黑暗的地方突然变成了炽热的早晨。其他女性都比她年长数十岁：知识渊博的退伍军人伊薇特（米娅·卡提巴克饰）、脆弱的艾琳（玛丽路易斯·伯克饰）、爱讽刺的吉妮（克里斯汀·尼尔森饰）和自信的伊莱恩（布伦达·普雷斯利饰）。&lt;/p>;&lt;在女人们杂乱无章、看似漫无目的的聊天中，主题出现了，包括身体不自觉的推拉（“我们的眼睛里也有微小的括约肌，”吉尼说，这是剧中对括约肌最不明确的提及），失去作为道德指导（索菲正在读乔治·艾略特的《丹尼尔·德隆达》，尽管她还没有到达女主人公成熟的部分），以及解释一种感觉是徒劳的，无论是痛苦、欲望还是恐惧。伊莱恩讲述了一个关于试图阻止丈夫对她大喊大叫的故事。他们选定了一个安全词“chimichanga”，有那么一会儿，她对他的喊叫感到害怕，但是，她告诉大家，“我会说 chimichanga，他会开始尖叫，你们不能说 chimichanga，否则你们知道不值得吃墨西哥卷饼。”&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;年长的女性可能已经经历了婚姻风暴，但索菲仍处于婚姻风暴之中。晚上，我们听到她给丈夫留下痛苦的信息（“我想我应该试着告诉你那是什么感觉，而不是仅仅说我很痛苦，我很痛苦，为我感到难过，皮特，我很痛苦”）以及给其他人发送肮脏的信息。我们意识到，她强烈的性欲也在折磨着她。然后诊所里孤独的人尼尔森（皮特·辛普森，做了一个非常有趣的硅谷优化兄弟的模仿），脱掉衬衫漫步到露台上，躺在躺椅上。克里斯汀·尼尔森 (Kristine Nielsen)，我们最精确的舞台喜剧演员之一，在为大家发言时，她的声音颤抖着降低了八度：“我们刚才在说什么？”如果有花园，就一定有诱惑。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;贝克是安妮·沃什伯恩和布兰登·雅各布斯-詹金斯等富有冒险精神的作家之一，他们利用表面现实主义来暗示更深层次、更不祥的潮流。 ：该学派认为，世界的大部分地区都是隐藏的。贝克作品的独特之处在于她的对话，她的对话自然而然地徘徊，就好像她无意中听到的一样，还有她的沉默，她说她在作曲时有节奏地数出沉默。学者们就贝克的沉默撰写了论文，试图理解他们如何将她的戏剧转向更大的自然主义（这是对话实际花费的时间）和更大的神秘感（沉默是间隙，间隙是门户，有时奇怪的东西会到来）通过门户）。她还利用沉默来确保她独特的喜剧时机充满活力，并在预期的尴尬和侧眼反应中保持平静。如果表演者说话，通常也是安静的。在贝克的戏剧表演中，观众总是非常安静。如果我们沙沙作响，我们可能会淹没某人。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;我记得在观看《对映体》时，我想，当贝克认真起来时，那会很可怕。她冰冷的目光是如此撕裂——如果她打开它怎么办，我不知道，我？她的戏剧《约翰》是存在主义的广阔而令人毛骨悚然的华丽。她凭借慢核杰作《电影》获得了普利策奖，该片在电影院工作的实时乏味中隐藏了道德悲剧。她的作品受到仔细观察，几乎具有宗教纪律，她在塑造舞台时间方面的创新使她成为当今最重要的戏剧作家之一。然而，尽管我很喜欢她的其他戏剧，但她有趣的讽刺总是与锋利的边缘保持安全距离。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;然而，“无限生命”是一把没有手柄的刀。贝克说，她是在经历了无法解决的痛苦之后才写下这本书的——“我知道我想写一部戏剧，但我只能在 Word 文档的顶部写下‘PAIN PAIN PAIN’，”她在 &lt;em>; 中说道。时尚。在这里，她显然不是通过让我们感到身体上的痛苦来传达不可言喻的，而是借给我们她的角色在极度饥饿使他们与身体分离时所经历的怪异悬念。贝克的影响让我们暂时与他们一起漂流。我们感觉时间在不可预知地流逝。她让我们感受到他们紧张的坚忍，这只是远离痛苦的一种感觉。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;奇怪的是，我发现这部干眼剧中最难以忍受的时刻出现在中间，当叙事视角短暂地从行动转向元评论。 “那天晚上你听到我尖叫，”艾琳平静地对索菲说。索菲和剧作家之间的界限变得模糊，特别是因为这个角色的造型看起来很像贝克——卷发、穿着袜子和凉鞋。伯克的声音颤抖而无力。 “我说过没有人应该尝试重现这一点。这是最纯粹形式的痛苦。一分钟就是无限。”等等，我想，贝克真的在诊所的某个地方看到过一个女人崩溃了吗？ “我说过永远不要告诉任何人你看到我这个样子，”艾琳然后对索菲说。 “你说：‘好吧。’ ” 贝克是在告诉我们这个场景侵犯了隐私吗？我还是不确定。在《对跖点》之后，我觉得我理解了贝克的信念，即把别人的痛苦写成文字是怪诞的。但是，在这个奇怪的、令人震惊的场景中，我意识到我错了。语言，就像痛苦一样，可能是一个不精确的信使。 ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot;

data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;2021 年 8 月一个温暖的早晨，一辆黑色道奇大篷车停在 Foxboro 小学在犹他州北盐湖城，伊莎贝拉·蒂奇诺 (Isabella Tichenor) 下了车，对开学第一天感到兴奋。伊莎贝拉（Isabella），绰号伊兹（Izzy），十岁，穿着膝盖处预先破洞的工装裤。她喜欢跳舞和玩四方格。在她母亲布列塔尼那天拍摄的一张照片中，伊兹和她七岁的妹妹艾迪生以及六岁的弟弟杰克森站在一起，他们都在笑。 “这是美好的一天，”布列塔尼告诉我。但是，新学年开始大约一周后，布列塔尼注意到伊兹变得安静了。她询问了伊兹的新老师。 “妈妈，我认为她不喜欢我，”伊兹说。她解释说，老师不会看她，而且她早上也不像其他学生那样向她打招呼。布列塔尼问伊兹是否是班上唯一的黑人学生。 “我想是的，”伊兹说。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;布列塔尼也在犹他州长大，那里的黑人人口不到百分之二。一年级时，同学们开始称她为“N字”。她患有抑郁症，有时甚至很难起床。高中毕业后，她倾向于那些能够奖励她数字天赋的工作——出纳工作，然后是会计工作。 Izzy 出生于 2011 年，是一段短暂恋情的产物。她有引人注目的眉毛，额头上有一颗痣。三四岁的时候，她开始在杂货店和其他公共场所无缘无故地无法安慰地尖叫。有时，她会因为焦虑而说不出话来，只能向布列塔尼拍手，试图把话说出来。布列塔尼认为这些迹象表明伊兹患有自闭症。艾迪生和杰克森出生后，布列塔尼搬到了盐湖地区，将孩子们安排在不同的学校，但对同样患有阅读障碍的伊兹的评估始终是一样的：她在数学、阅读和写作方面落后。在 2017 年进行的一项评估中，当时伊兹六岁，她的一年级老师指出她“孤僻”且“抑郁”。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;2018 年，布列塔尼嫁给了一位有兴趣帮助她抚养孩子的男人。她的孩子们。他们搬到了北盐湖城，2019 年，布列塔尼让她的孩子们在福克斯伯勒入学；工作人员早期的热情以及他们为帮助伊兹开始特殊教育计划所做的努力让她深受鼓舞。 “我认为这是一所好学校，”布列塔尼告诉我。 “每个人都很好。”但是，几个月后，&lt;em>;新冠肺炎&lt;/em>;-19 导致世界瘫痪，布列塔尼失去了工作；最终，一家人拖欠了房租。 2021 年，他们被逐出公寓。他们在俄亥俄州的一位亲戚那里住了几个月，然后回到盐湖地区，开始在空荡荡的停车场的货车里睡觉，并用毯子盖住窗户。 “这真是一种耻辱，”布列塔尼告诉我。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;那年八月，福克斯伯勒终于重新开放全日制面对面学习。布列塔尼带着孩子们去一家二手服装店，在那里他们挑选衣服，她在开学前一天晚上花了一大笔钱订了一家酒店，以便孩子们可以洗澡。但最初的几周很困难。伊兹抱怨她的老师后不久，她和艾迪生告诉母亲，另一名学生声称拥有枪，并威胁要用它向他们开枪。布列塔尼愤怒地给学校打电话。几天后，管理人员告诉她，他们查看了监控录像并搜查了学生的背包，但无法证实这一指控；不会有任何影响。 （负责监管福克斯伯勒的戴维斯学区拒绝对伊兹案件的细节发表评论。）“你能想象如果我的孩子带了枪吗？”布列塔尼问我。 “我的黑人孩子？”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;GenericCallout&quot;>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;external-link-embed--inline&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;a aria-label=&quot;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt ;获得支持&lt;/strong>;” data-event-click=&quot;{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;http://988lifeline.org/&quot;}&quot;

Brittany phoned the school immediately. The next morning, she received an e-mail from the principal, who wrote that she and her staff had reviewed footage and could not see the classmate touch Addison. And she said that two witnesses claimed they had not heard Addison and the student exchange words. But the principal told Brittany that she had come up with a solution: the Tichenor children and the other student could, by an intricate series of detours, avoid one another while at school. “This should ensure that they don&#39;t meet at any point,” the principal e-mailed, “if they each do what they&#39;ve been asked.” “This is out of control,” Brittany wrote back. “So basically it&#39;s okay for kids to call other kids [the N-word]!”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;If 2020 was the year of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-death-of-george-floyd-in-context&quot;>;George Floyd&lt;/a>; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tag/black-lives-matter&quot;>;Black Lives Matter&lt;/a>; movement, the years since have been characterized by a backlash. Much of it has centered on schools. Conservative politicians have taken aim at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/annals-of-inquiry/how-a-conservative-activist-invented-the-conflict-over-critical-race-theory&quot;>;critical race theory&lt;/a>;, a term now used to refer to virtually any discussion about race. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis called it “state-sanctioned racism” and signed a law banning instruction that makes students feel “guilt, anguish, or other forms of psychological distress because of actions . 。 。 committed in the past by members of the same race.” Using that law as a basis, the Florida Department of Education unanimously approved new standards encouraging lessons that suggest enslaved people enjoyed some “personal benefit.” Greg Abbott, the governor of Texas, signed a law that bars educators from implying a person can be “inherently racist, sexist, or oppressive.” Book bans have popped up across the country, striking works by writers including &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/02/03/toni-morrisons-profound-and-unrelenting-vision&quot;>;Toni Morrison&lt;/a>; and Maya Angelou from school libraries and curricula.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;These fights have extended to in-school harassment. Between October, 2021, and September, 2022, the Department of Education&#39;s Office for Civil Rights fielded eight hundred and ninety-nine allegations of racial bullying in schools, double the number of allegations from the year before. At a high school in Michigan, racial epithets and death threats were scrawled in the bathroom—“Kill all [N-word]s,” one read—and a Black doll hung from a noose on school grounds. In Minnesota, white students posted a video on social media goading a Black student to take her own life. “You can fucking rot in hell . 。 。 no one likes [N-word]s,” one says into the camera. “Fucking kill yourself right this time.” The increase in formal allegations may partially be the result of raised awareness—and a new way of speaking—about a kind of harassment that was present all along. But Christine Crawford, a child and adolescent psychiatrist at Boston Medical Center, believes that the political backlash also colors interactions among children. “They may be thinking that it&#39;s OK to talk this way about other groups of people,” she said. “ &#39;Dad is doing it. My mom is doing it.有什么问题？&#39; ” These interactions, in turn, become culture-war flash points. When the parents of a Black student at the Michigan school announced a lawsuit against the school district, the news prompted an outpouring of online anger. “I&#39;m so tired of the super woke, most intelligent, most free black people in the world acting like they went through slavery,” one commenter wrote. “YOU WERE BORN FREE! NOW WHATS YOUR EXCUSE.” Another added, “This is so fake.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Foxboro Elementary sits in Davis County, just north of Salt Lake City. Sixty-one per cent of the county voted for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/letter-from-bidens-washington/trumps-offense-against-democracy-itself&quot;>;Donald Trump&lt;/a>; in the 2020 election. “Let&#39;s Go Brandon” signs and Blue Lives Matter flags hang in front yards. In February, 2021, an elementary school in the Davis School District celebrated Black History Month with a hallway display about the ABCs of Black history (“P” for “protest”; “U” for “uplift”). Natalie Cline, a right-wing member of the Utah State Board of Education, argued that it pushed “an extremely controversial ideology,” and the decorations were removed. Months later, the district banned the display of all Black Lives Matter flags, along with LGBTQ pride flags, calling them too politically charged. “No flags fly in our schools except for the flag of the United States of America,” a district spokesperson told local media.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Black students in the area had long been targeted by racial bullying. Brynn Martindale, who graduated from a high school in the district in 2022, told me that, in preschool, another child said, “My dad doesn&#39;t like Black people, so I don&#39;t like Black people, either.” In middle school, a white classmate took to calling Martindale “Fat Black.” Her hair was touched by “teachers, students, church leaders, random adults, everyone.” Allison Schlichter, a white parent who adopted a Black daughter from Ethiopia, told me that a student in first grade told her daughter that her hair and skin color were “stupid.” When Schlichter complained, the principal waved the incident away, arguing that what the student said was equivalent to telling someone that their clothes are unfashionable. “I was in a total panic,” Schlichter told me. “I couldn&#39;t send my daughter back there again.” She pulled her daughter out of the school and enrolled her in another district for a year. Shauntel Black, another white parent of a Black child, told me that, when white students pushed her son Justus around on the elementary-school playground, and he defended himself, he was punished, and his attackers weren&#39;t. “He got told his skin looked like poop every single year,” Black said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Around 2018, Schlichter and another parent, Emily Furse, began collecting stories from fellow-parents, eventually amassing hundreds of pages&#39; worth. The following year, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/10/us/school-bus-driver-biracial-student-utah/index.html&quot;>;video footage&lt;/a>; emerged showing a white bus driver from the district clamping the bus doors shut on the backpack of a biracial student and dragging him for more than a hundred and fifty feet. The incident made national news. Schlichter and Furse&#39;s collection of stories went on to reach the Department of Justice.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;In June, 2019, two DOJ lawyers travelled to Utah to investigate whether the district was violating Title IV of the Civil Rights Act, which bars race-based discrimination. Black students told the attorneys that their white classmates routinely called them the N-word, or referred to them as “monkeys” or “apes,” and made monkey noises. White students touched and pulled Black students&#39; hair without permission, and told them to pick cotton. Some displayed or wore Confederate flags. Some often requested “N-word passes” from Black students, which they insisted allowed them to use the N-word without consequence; when refused this request, white students sometimes threatened or physically assaulted their Black classmates. They called Black students&#39; skin dirty, or said that it looked like feces, asking why they didn&#39;t wash it. Administrators knew of at least two hundred and twelve documented occasions in which Black students were called the N-word in the course of just three years. The DOJ attorneys found that the students who used the slurs were rarely disciplined. Some teachers who admitted to hearing the epithets said that they had simply told offenders to “watch their language”; staff explained away instigators&#39; behavior by saying they&#39;re “not trying to be racist.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In an interview with one of the DOJ lawyers, who is Black, a white assistant principal, quoting an exchange, repeatedly used the N-word, without censoring it. In another interview, a white staff member said that a student was, like the lawyer, “colored.” “I think we were all, everyone on the team, shocked and pretty appalled,” an attorney with the investigation told me. “It was really hard to hear the experiences these students had—and the general feelings of isolation, on top of that, and just having very few people to talk to and turn to. It was pretty heartbreaking.”&lt;/p>;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;feature-default&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;image&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:feature-default&quot;>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;A woman and two children stand under a tree.&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64f88e7e7a46ddac0dd6d3cc/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Gardner-Tichenor-03.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64f88e7e7a46ddac0dd6d3cc/master/w_120,c_limit/Gardner-Tichenor-03.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64f88e7e7a46ddac0dd6d3cc/master/w_240,c_limit/Gardner-Tichenor-03.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64f88e7e7a46ddac0dd6d3cc/master/w_320,c_limit/Gardner-Tichenor-03.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64f88e7e7a46ddac0dd6d3cc/master/w_640,c_limit/Gardner-Tichenor-03.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64f88e7e7a46ddac0dd6d3cc/master/w_960,c_limit/Gardner-Tichenor-03.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64f88e7e7a46ddac0dd6d3cc/master/w_1280,c_limit/Gardner-Tichenor-03.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64f88e7e7a46ddac0dd6d3cc/master/w_1600,c_limit/Gardner-Tichenor-03.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;From left, Addison, Brittany, and Jaxson, photographed outside their home.&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/inline-embed>;&lt;p >;By late September, 2021, Izzy and her family had been homeless for at least three months. Brittany would pick up the kids at Foxboro each afternoon and drive to a truck stop or city park for the night. In the mornings, they would find a bathroom at a rest stop or fast-food restaurant, clean up, and get dressed for school. Brittany worked far-flung cashier jobs, using gas that she bought with food stamps. Sometimes she scraped together enough money to treat the family to a night at a hotel, where they would blast the air-conditioning and order room service. Addison and Jaxson seemed to adjust to the situation, treating it like a camping trip, but Izzy had a harder time adapting. In class, Izzy&#39;s teacher seemingly struggled to relate to her. The teacher wrote in an assessment, “She doesn&#39;t seem to have much emotion, and I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s because she doesn&#39;t understand what is happening or doesn&#39;t care.” (The Davis School District declined to make Foxboro personnel available to comment for this piece. Izzy&#39;s teacher did not respond to requests for comment.) That fall, Brittany requested, for a second time, an evaluation to formally diagnose her daughter as having autism. (Brittany hadn&#39;t completed all the steps for an earlier attempt.) Her hope was that, if the school acknowledged the disability, Izzy would get the treatment she needed.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;One day, Brittany caught Izzy dousing herself with Febreze. When her mother asked why, Izzy told her that kids at school said she smelled bad. The teasing got worse after her teacher gave a talk to the class about the importance of taking showers and baths. Izzy felt that the lecture was directed at her. Brittany called to complain, asking that, in the future, the teacher discuss her daughter&#39;s hygiene with her, rather than in front of the other students. The teacher explained that personal hygiene is simply something that she regularly discusses with her class, and, in Brittany&#39;s recollection, asked her to calm down. “I said, &#39;You don&#39;t tell me to calm down,&#39; because that&#39;s what white people always say,” Brittany told me.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Later that fall, Brittany found a steadier job, working at a dollar store. She and her husband pooled their money, and some housing vouchers, and put a down payment on an apartment—a three-story, two-bedroom, town-house-style space with its own garage, granite countertops, and all-new appliances. When Brittany brought the kids there, in October, they were ecstatic. “Now we can cook!” Izzy said, running her hand along the counter. The apartment was outside of the Davis district, and Brittany hoped to enroll her children in a new school.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In the meantime, at Foxboro, the bullying got worse. Izzy said that students were focussing on her thick eyebrows, which had started to grow into a unibrow, and the “dot” on her forehead. She begged her mother, “I need you to cut my eyebrows. People are making fun of me.” Brittany tried to console her. “You&#39;re beautiful,” she said. On Tuesday, November 2nd, Brittany let her daughter skip school, to settle into the new house and to give her a break from her tormentors. That evening, as another school day loomed, Izzy became despondent and sequestered herself in her mother&#39;s bedroom. “She just laid on the ground in my room, in front of the closet,” Brittany told me. Brittany went downstairs to do some unpacking but reminded Izzy that she had a book-report poster to complete for the next day, for which they had bought new colored pencils. “When I come back upstairs, we&#39;re gonna do it,” she said. “Are you excited?” Izzy gave her a faint smile.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In the garage, Brittany and her husband rummaged through boxes of photos to mount around the house. Several minutes later, Addison and Jaxson burst in, and said that Izzy had tried to kill herself. They all ran to the top floor, and found Izzy. Brittany&#39;s husband called 911 and performed CPR. Izzy was rushed to the hospital. When Brittany came into her hospital room, Izzy had tubes in her mouth, and tears coming from her eyes. Brittany initially thought that this was a positive sign, but the staff explained that it was likely the work of involuntary reflexes. By that Friday, Izzy had been in a coma for three days. Doctors told Brittany that Izzy&#39;s condition would likely never improve. The following afternoon, she was taken off life support. She was pronounced dead on November 6th. “A part of me died,” Brittany said.&lt;/p>;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;feature-default&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;image&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:feature-default&quot;>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;A woman holds a photograph of a child.&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64f88e7e7a46ddac0dd6d3cb/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Gardner-Tichenor-05.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64f88e7e7a46ddac0dd6d3cb/master/w_120,c_limit/Gardner-Tichenor-05.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64f88e7e7a46ddac0dd6d3cb/master/w_240,c_limit/Gardner-Tichenor-05.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64f88e7e7a46ddac0dd6d3cb/master/w_320,c_limit/Gardner-Tichenor-05.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64f88e7e7a46ddac0dd6d3cb/master/w_640,c_limit/Gardner-Tichenor-05.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64f88e7e7a46ddac0dd6d3cb/master/w_960,c_limit/Gardner-Tichenor-05.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64f88e7e7a46ddac0dd6d3cb/master/w_1280,c_limit/Gardner-Tichenor-05.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64f88e7e7a46ddac0dd6d3cb/master/w_1600,c_limit/Gardner-Tichenor-05.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;Brittany holds a photograph of Izzy.&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/inline-embed>;&lt;p >;Izzy&#39;s suicide threw an already divided school district into crisis. The DOJ had just released the results of its investigation, finding that the district had compromised the rights of students of color by “responding in a clearly unreasonable manner to widespread, pervasive race-based harassment . 。 。 by both students and staff.” In a letter describing its findings, the DOJ reported prevalent use of the N-word, racial taunts, and physical threats. The district also subjected “Black students to harsher, more frequent discipline than white students who engaged in similar behavior.” In one case, a Black student was criminally charged. Kristen Clarke, who heads the DOJ&#39;s civil-rights division, told me that the findings are “a powerful reminder that we can&#39;t ignore the way in which hate manifests itself . 。 。 including inside of our schools.” The district agreed to a settlement, which included training for teachers and administrators on how to identify and report racial harassment, and the establishment of an electronic reporting system for families, students, and teachers to register complaints. Dan Linford, the superintendent of Davis, who was appointed after the report&#39;s release, told me that he was surprised by the severity of the racial harassment uncovered, and said that the behavior described in the findings was deplorable. “We cannot shrink from our responsibility to solve this,” he said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In the community, the DOJ&#39;s findings were divisive. Many Black locals welcomed the report. Martindale, the recent graduate from a high school in the district, told me that she was relieved that someone in power had listened. But some of her friends didn&#39;t buy it. “My white friends were, like, &#39;No, that does not happen. That&#39;s not a thing.&#39; ” Linford noted, “The initial wave of response was a lot of people just completely denying it.” Schlichter, one of the parents who collected stories about the treatment of Black students, told me that, because she was vocal about racial harassment, “I literally lost half of my friends and family members.” That November, at a Davis school-board meeting, one resident expressed fury about the settlement, saying, “You just . 。 。 invited the federal government into our schools to come in and police our children and police our teachers.” A speaker with a red “Keep America Great” baseball cap and a Utah Patriots T-shirt took the lectern and said, “I think it&#39;s nothing more than a big push to shove CRT, transgender, the gay—the whole movement—down our throats.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;It is, of course, difficult to know what causes a suicide. Crawford, the child psychiatrist, told me that surviving loved ones often reach for specific motives, but it&#39;s rarely that simple. “Everyone has their own reasons for doing so, and it is quite difficult to predict who will actually make an attempt,” she said. Suicide by children of color is even less well understood. A &lt;em>;JAMA Pediatrics&lt;/em>; &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2680952&quot;>;study&lt;/a>; published in 2018 found that, nationally, Black kids between the ages of five and twelve are twice as likely to kill themselves as white children. But we don&#39;t understand the role that particular forms of discrimination play in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/04/11/the-mystifying-rise-of-child-suicide&quot;>;that outcome&lt;/a>;. Eraka Bath, a child psychiatrist at University of California, Los Angeles, told me, when it comes to social behavioral research, “We have a science problem where ninety per cent of our studies are based on people”—Western, educated, rich—who only represent a fraction of the population. Izzy&#39;s circumstances were difficult in a number ways. She was poor, and had spent several months homeless. Her learning disabilities made school a struggle. Her mother had a history of depressive episodes, and at least one of Izzy&#39;s teachers had observed signs of depression in her, too.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;elscg&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;But Brittany came to believe that Izzy&#39;s suicide was primarily a result of being bullied, and that she had been targeted for her race and disability. The day after Izzy died, some friends put Brittany in touch with the Utah chapter of Black Lives Matter, which offered to handle press communications for her. “This was a ten-year-old girl,” Rae Duckworth, the organization&#39;s chairperson, told me. “This was a big loss.” The next day, Brittany sat in front of TV cameras, with Duckworth standing behind her, and told the story of Izzy&#39;s harassment at Foxboro. Nearly two hundred gathered for a candlelight vigil the following night. Before the tipoff of a Utah Jazz game, an announcer asked for a moment of silence for “Isabella Faith Tichenor, a child lost far too soon.” The Jazz donated fifty thousand dollars to a GoFundMe account set up for Brittany and her family. “The vague, nonspecific, but still pretty targeted and painful feedback that Izzy received,” from students, teachers, and administrators, “is textbook racism,” Kimberly Applewhite, a clinical psychologist and racial stress and trauma researcher in Utah, told me. “Anytime there&#39;s a stripping of humanity of Black people, we need to assume that something racist is occurring.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In response, the district commissioned an independent investigation into the allegations that Izzy was bullied on the basis of her race or disabilities. Conducted by a local attorney and two other panelists, the inquiry found that Addison, Izzy&#39;s sister, likely had been “the target of race-based bullying.” But the panelists said they couldn&#39;t find definitive evidence that Izzy&#39;s bullying had been racially motivated. “When a student told Izzy she needed to wash her hair,” they reported, “this comment could have been borne out of racial animus, could have been an innocuous observation, or could have been a cloaked insult about poverty.” When I spoke to John Zurbuchen, an assistant superintendent of the Davis School District, he didn&#39;t get into the details of the case, but he said he believed that the racial bullying outlined in the DOJ&#39;s findings and Izzy&#39;s suicide were unconnected. “The tragedy of Izzy&#39;s death and the timing of what we were doing with the DOJ were unfortunate, in the sense that it conflated the two issues,” he said. “The two pieces aren&#39;t related other than by consequence and by timing.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Regardless, the event exacerbated the fight over how to deal with race in schools. Utahans who felt that the DOJ report was fake news embraced the internal investigation of Izzy&#39;s death as proof that racism was being exaggerated. One commenter wrote, “So her mom cried racism and bullying with no evidence and people just ate it up?? Shocker.” Natalie Cline, the State Board of Education member who lobbied to remove the Black History Month display, saw a conspiracy. “Izzy&#39;s tragic death by suicide was exploited by school activists to bring the DOJ into Davis School District where they have now forced CRT policies, programs and curriculum onto students,” she posted online. “All of this to make white, straight, Christian students feel guilty for something they did not do.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Sandra Hollins, the only Black member of Utah&#39;s state legislature, sponsored Izzy&#39;s Bill—which adopted statewide some of the measures that appeared in the Davis settlement with the DOJ, including new training for school staff to help eliminate discrimination and harassment. The bill also proposed tracking demographic information on victims of bullying to determine whether students are being targeted for their race. The opposition argued that such tracking was an invasion of privacy, and, according to Hollins, insisted that “race shouldn&#39;t be a factor in all of this.” The bill ultimately passed, but Hollins had to remove all but one mention of the word “race.” Utah Parents United, which claims fifty thousand members, urged its followers to speak out against the law: “An extensive investigation was conducted on the suicide of Isabella Tichenor,” the group explained to followers on social media, “and the outcome document stated &#39;no direct evidence to support the claim that Izzy was bullied on the basis of race and/or disability.&#39; ” In November, 2022, Brittany&#39;s attorneys announced a lawsuit against the district. One of her lawyers is Milton Grimes, who represented &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/postscript-rodney-king-1965-2012&quot;>;Rodney King&lt;/a>; after his beating, in 1991, at the hands of the Los Angeles Police Department. The Utah chapter of Black Lives Matter announced another vigil, marking one year since Izzy had died. In response, it got an anonymous threat, which used the N-word, called the organizers “filthy,” and said that their time was up. “You will never see it coming,” the message read.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;feature-large-callout&quot; >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;GroupCalloutWrapper&quot;>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;A person kneels at a grave marker.&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64f88e7ee52c23d3134b62f2/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Gardner-Tichenor-01.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64f88e7ee52c23d3134b62f2/master/w_120,c_limit/Gardner-Tichenor-01.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64f88e7ee52c23d3134b62f2/master/w_240,c_limit/Gardner-Tichenor-01.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64f88e7ee52c23d3134b62f2/master/w_320,c_limit/Gardner-Tichenor-01.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64f88e7ee52c23d3134b62f2/master/w_640,c_limit/Gardner-Tichenor-01.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64f88e7ee52c23d3134b62f2/master/w_960,c_limit/Gardner-Tichenor-01.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64f88e7ee52c23d3134b62f2/master/w_1280,c_limit/Gardner-Tichenor-01.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64f88e7ee52c23d3134b62f2/master/w_1600,c_limit/Gardner-Tichenor-01.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;Brittany at Izzy&#39;s grave site.&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;A woman sits on the grass.&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64f88e7d072ea52e06e27d21/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Gardner-Tichenor-02.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64f88e7d072ea52e06e27d21/master/w_120,c_limit/Gardner-Tichenor-02.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64f88e7d072ea52e06e27d21/master/w_240,c_limit/Gardner-Tichenor-02.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64f88e7d072ea52e06e27d21/master/w_320,c_limit/Gardner-Tichenor-02.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64f88e7d072ea52e06e27d21/master/w_640,c_limit/Gardner-Tichenor-02.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64f88e7d072ea52e06e27d21/master/w_960,c_limit/Gardner-Tichenor-02.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64f88e7d072ea52e06e27d21/master/w_1280,c_limit/Gardner-Tichenor-02.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64f88e7d072ea52e06e27d21/master/w_1600,c_limit/Gardner-Tichenor-02.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;The cemetery where Izzy is buried sits in an affluent Salt Lake suburb. One afternoon last summer, I joined Brittany, Addison, and Jaxson on a visit to Izzy&#39;s grave. Some of Izzy&#39;s GoFundMe paid for the burial plot, casket, and funeral expenses, but cash ran out before the family could purchase a headstone. When we arrived, Addison and Jaxson burst from the car and ran toward the spot where they thought their older sister rested. They came upon a temporary plastic marker, but it wasn&#39;t Izzy&#39;s. Soon all three Tichenors were on their hands and knees, running their fingers through the grass, groping for Izzy&#39;s name. Finally, Brittany called out, “It&#39;s here!,” and the children came running.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The investigations into racial harassment didn&#39;t stop with the Davis School District. The US Department of Education&#39;s Office for Civil Rights lists pending cases of racial harassment in seven school districts in Utah. There are hundreds more around the nation. Last year, the Education Department reached a settlement with a district in Victorville, California, where school officials disciplined Black students more harshly than white students. And the DOJ reached a settlement with a Kentucky district where students used racial taunts and Confederate flags as intimidation. The Davis School District has been implementing the DOJ&#39;s recommendations, but some parents continue to fight them, and at least one withdrew her children from Davis as a result. This past June, Brittany&#39;s lawsuit against the district ended in a settlement. The district agreed to give her two million dollars and promised to erect an eighteen-inch statue of Izzy in the Foxboro Elementary library, and a plaque at district headquarters, commemorating her.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Back in the cemetery, Brittany sat cross-legged, her index finger over her daughter&#39;s grave marker. Jaxson and Addison placed their fingers over their sister&#39;s name, too, then ran off toward a patch of tree shade to make use of some art supplies. Brittany told me that grief had thrown her family into turmoil; she and her husband were in the middle of divorce proceedings. The media spotlight was also taking a toll. People expected her to be a model for how to mourn a dead child, but she didn&#39;t always deal with her despair well. She told me that she consumes alcohol more than she should. “I do drink . 。 。 to numb it,” she said. (She later said that she intended to enter rehab.) She told me that, the last night at home, before Izzy killed herself, she had broken out of her despondency to tell Brittany, “You&#39;re the best mom in the whole wide world.” Brittany believes that this was Izzy&#39;s way of saying goodbye. “Sometimes people say, &#39;Oh, I&#39;m doing great,&#39; or, &#39;Yeah, I&#39;m taking it one day at a time.&#39;我不是。 I&#39;m miserable.

After Putin launched a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/05/29/two-weeks-at-the-front-in-ukraine&quot;>;full-scale invasion&lt;/a>;, I began to correspond with some of those filmmakers, hoping to find a local perspective on the war. In March of 2022, I met Dmytro Sukholytkyy-Sobchuk, one of the country&#39;s most exciting young auteurs, in a glitchy Zoom meeting. He was signing on from western Ukraine, where he was volunteering with #Babylon&#39;13 to capture the events of the unfolding war. He told me about a group of religious sculptors he had met near Lviv who had been retrained to build defense barriers. We both felt that they would be fascinating subjects for a documentary. That idea became “Liturgy of Anti-Tank Obstacles,” an original film from &lt;em>;The New Yorker&lt;/em>;.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;From the start, Dmytro and I both knew that we wanted to make a war film without showing violence. The hope, instead, was to highlight the new reality of everyday Ukranians. Dmytro shot the documentary over three weeks, capturing the artists near Lviv in a transformative moment, one that resonates in the experiences of others throughout the country, as their lives are reshaped by the war and the national-defense effort. The resulting film has premièred at festivals, including Sundance and the Toronto International Film Festival (Dmytro was not able to get a visa to attend), and won first prize in the documentary contest at the Huesca International Film Festival, qualifying it for the 2024 Academy Awards. We recently spoke by Zoom about the making of “Liturgy of Anti-Tank Obstacles,” with Dmytro joining from his Kyiv apartment. The call came during a busy stretch for him; he&#39;s teaching filmmaking classes and touring with his début narrative feature, “Pamfir”—which centers on a man involved in criminal enterprises and is set against the backdrop of his village&#39;s annual carnival—all while the war grinds on.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;GenericCallout&quot;>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;external-link-embed--inline&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;a aria-label=&quot;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;The New Yorker Documentary&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-new-yorker-documentary/watch-the-new-yorker-documentary&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-new-yorker-documentary/watch-the-new-yorker-documentary&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;&lt;span >;&lt;strong>;The New Yorker Documentary&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/a>;&lt;p >;&lt;em>;View the latest or submit your own film.&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;a aria-label=&quot;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;The New Yorker Documentary&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-new-yorker-documentary/watch-the-new-yorker-documentary&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-new-yorker-documentary/watch-the-new-yorker-documentary&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5daf63ccaae3dd0008e7fd38/1:1/w_200%2Cc_limit/undefined&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5daf63ccaae3dd0008e7fd38/1:1/w_120,c_limit/undefined 120w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/a>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Though there is plenty of Eastern Orthodox religious imagery in the film, Dmytro himself is not a believer. (He told me there are three things in life that he considers purely personal: “Who you want to love; who you want to believe in; and what you want to eat. It&#39;s your private business.”) Ukraine is a secular country, and President &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tag/volodymyr-zelensky&quot;>;Zelensky&lt;/a>; is Jewish. What drew him to these artists was not their religiosity but their undertaking of a version of the same pragmatic pivot that he saw throughout the country. As the invasion began, the sculptors were making statues of the Virgin Mary or angels with beatific expressions. Just weeks later, they were building anti-tank obstacles. All over the country, Ukrainians were pivoting to the defense effort. “Whatever you were doing before the war, you start to find your capabilities,” Dmytro told me. “This change impressed me.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Dmytro had undergone a similar transformation himself. When the Russian forces invaded, he was in Kyiv with his wife. They live not far from the airport, and he remembers waking up from the bombing; a house nearby was damaged. Right away, he began shooting footage in the capital. He saw his responsibilities as a director overlapping with his responsibilities as a citizen, making films so that “you can see how people defend sovereignty, democracy, territory, and their own lives,” he told me.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;For “Liturgy of Anti-Tank Obstacles,” Dmytro took a patient, observational approach to storytelling. The film shows the artists at work, but it doesn&#39;t present their individual backstories or personalities. He doesn&#39;t mention that two of the three artists are now serving as soldiers in the war. When I asked him about the choice, he said he approached the film this way because of a pattern he had seen during the war: “Everybody in Ukraine, no matter where, they start to be like one person. Not a person. One piece. If you describe somebody&#39;s personality, they are unique, like fingerprints. But, if they unite together, they start to be a fist.” His idea was to show in the film the sense of unanimity and collectivism that he saw at work all around him: “They can be a huge fist who can knock out everybody who attacks them.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Dmytro told me about a recent trip to Paris, where he&#39;d travelled to finish his feature film, which showed how pervasive the reality of the invasion is for people in Ukraine. It was eleven o&#39;clock one night, and he realized that he&#39;d forgotten to buy water. He remembers thinking, Oh, damn, I forgot to buy the water, and I need to wait for the next day. His friends were confused, and reminded him that shops were open late. Oh, damn, he thought again: You don&#39;t have a curfew. That simple moment is a reminder of why it&#39;s so important for him to tell a story from his own perspective. No matter how empathetic an outsider may be, Dmytro told me, at the end of the day, “They go back to their reality. We go back to our reality.” ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot;

Gillespie peppers the dialogue with a handful of key terms—“selling short,” “short squeeze,” “margin account”—which the movie both depicts in action and invites viewers to research for themselves. He also neatly organizes the story into three distinct zones, which parse the abstractions all the more clearly: the small-time purchasers of shares in the video-game retailer GameStop, the Wall Street big shots whose wisdom the small-timers defy and whose businesses they threaten, and the lone individual who sparked the showdown: Keith Gill (Paul Dano). Gill was a social-media influencer who, under the pseudonym Roaring Kitty, advocated for the stock on his YouTube videocast. (He delivered the same message on Reddit under the pseudonym DeepFuckingValue.) At the time, he was working in an unglamorous backwater of financial services, as a broker at MassMutual, and he had an axe to grind with Wall Street. As the film&#39;s protagonist, Keith is the source of both its main strengths and its weaknesses: his exploits and passions give “Dumb Money” an appealing energy, even as his temperament and mind-set go largely unexamined.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The reason that the buying frenzy Keith had engendered caused trouble was that a number of institutional investors were selling GameStop short. Short selling is a way of betting that a stock price will fall: instead of buying shares in anticipation of eventually selling at a higher price, a short seller borrows stock and immediately sells it, contracting to buy it back at a later date; so long as the stock falls, this yields a profit. In “Dumb Money,” the short sellers are represented by perhaps the biggest and most brazen of them, Gabe Plotkin (Seth Rogen), the founder of a New York-based hedge fund called Melvin Capital. When the story starts, GameStop is trading at $3.85 per share; Gabe believes that it will go even lower, but then Keith begins his pushback to drive the price back up.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Gillespie contrasts Gabe&#39;s charmed life—during the pandemic, he decamped to Florida and bought two houses next door to each other, planning to demolish one and build a tennis court on the plot—with Keith&#39;s more modest circumstances. The son of a nurse (Kate Burton) and a truck driver (Clancy Brown), Keith grew up in Brockton, Massachusetts, and was the first in his family to graduate from college, a local one. He lives in an unremarkable house with his wife, Caroline (Shailene Woodley), and their infant daughter. After the markets close each day, he retreats to the family basement to produce his Roaring Kitty videos. In them, he displays his balance sheet and discusses, with a snarky and colloquial fervor, his assessment of GameStop and why he thinks that the big firms—despite the mighty resources that he knows they have at their disposal—are getting it wrong. (His main reason: the kind of people who work on Wall Street don&#39;t get gaming and gamers.) Keith is as much an entertainer as he is an expert, but he puts his money where his mouth is: he invests heavily in GameStop, and, once his followers buy in, too, the share price skyrockets.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;For a short seller like Gabe, this is a big problem. The worst that can happen with an ordinary stock purchase is that the price goes to zero and the investor loses her entire stake. But, as a TV-news commentator explains during the film, there&#39;s no limit to how high a stock can go, which means that a short seller&#39;s losses are potentially infinite. To avert disaster, short sellers who have made a bad bet may rush to buy back the borrowed stock when it rises. But this creates a further problem: these forced purchases increase demand, thus driving the price even higher and putting all remaining short sellers in an even deeper hole. This is what&#39;s known as a short squeeze, and Gabe&#39;s company is caught in a terrible one. At one point, he&#39;s losing a billion dollars a day and has to run hat in hand to even bigger shots—notably, a pair of hedge-fund CEOs, Steve Cohen (Vincent D&#39;Onofrio), the current owner of the Mets, and Ken Griffin (Nick Offerman). Keith is eating this up, of course.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Meanwhile, who are the regular investors buying GameStop? The movie, written by Lauren Schuker Blum and Rebecca Angelo (based on a &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Antisocial-Network-GameStop-Squeeze-Amateur/dp/1538707551&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Antisocial-Network-GameStop-Squeeze-Amateur/dp/1538707551&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Antisocial-Network-GameStop-Squeeze-Amateur/dp/1538707551&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;nonfiction book&lt;/a>; by Ben Mezrich), presents a few: a nurse named Jenny (America Ferrera), a GameStop sales clerk named Marcus (Anthony Ramos), and two University of Texas undergraduates, Riri (Myha&#39;la Herrold) and Harmony (Talia Ryder). The students are deep in debt, the nurse and the clerk are struggling to make ends meet, and when they, like many others, follow Keith into investing in GameStop they suddenly make lots of money, hundreds of thousands of dollars—at least on paper. That is to say, they can realize this profit only by selling their shares. And yet they don&#39;t sell. This is by far the most interesting and mysterious aspect of the whole story, but it&#39;s a mystery that neither Gillespie nor his screenwriters come close to illuminating.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Keith isn&#39;t selling his stock, either: being able to put the squeeze on Gabe and other Wall Street potentates is seemingly worth far more to him than a big payday. He encourages his followers, over whom he has an almost guru-like power, to see their collective buying frenzy as a sort of protest movement. The “smart money” of Wall Street regards small retail investors with derision—that&#39;s where the movie&#39;s title comes from—but now finds itself at their mercy. (Keith&#39;s followers gleefully burlesque their presumed unsophistication, brandishing misspelled signs reading “HODL THE LINE”—ie, don&#39;t sell.) By holding, they keep the price up, and even hope that others will join in and send it higher. (One of the students likens the run-up in the stock&#39;s price to a Ponzi scheme.) The four depicted investors risk not cashing out in time, and seeing their paper gains vanish when the stock plummets, all because of the “hodl” that Keith has over them. Yet the nature of this cultlike fervor remains utterly unexplored. The fact that Keith does eventually cash out, realizing a profit—unlike some of his followers, who waited too long—is relegated to a concluding title card.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The movie wastes time on setting up a few minor points of the followers&#39; personalities (the nurse wants a man in her life, the students are in a romantic relationship, the clerk is tired of his fussy boss) rather than probing the psychology of a mass movement with strong political overtones. What political points the movie does make are predictable and safe. The oblivious privilege of Wall Street is emphasized throughout, as in the way that Gabe, preparing to give testimony to Congress via Zoom, fails to grasp why appearing in front of his wine collection is a bad look. There&#39;s a passing mention, too, of the loosely linked collective&#39;s affinities with Occupy Wall Street, but it comes and goes in the blink of its utterance. (There&#39;s not even a hint that the anti-élite impulse could serve a Trumpist agenda just as readily as a leftist one.) The screenwriters are notably choosy about which acolytes they choose to dramatize; the presence of antisemitic comments on the group&#39;s subreddit briefly becomes a significant plot point, but the antisemites themselves are neither seen nor heard, and the topic is quickly dropped.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Above all, Keith is presented merely as a bundle of idiosyncrasies and remains a cipher. He&#39;s an obsessive runner who, when the going gets tough, heads to the track. He&#39;s contemptuous of institutions but dismayed, even shocked, when his employers threaten to fire him for his extracurricular financial-world activities. He displays an overt frugality in his personal habits but has a lavishly equipped basement studio. Dano&#39;s performance, abounding in nervous energy and revelling in puckish mannerisms, suggests a depth that&#39;s absent from anything in the script. How Keith got started, how he built a following, what drives him to center his identity on his videos and posts are all left blank. His laconic self-justification (“I like the stock”) is tantalizingly inscrutable: behind it surely lurks a perspective that amounts almost to an aesthetics of investing, but the movie is unwilling or unable to delve further.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Still, the mechanisms that “Dumb Money” ably exposes retain a cold, clinical fascination. If it doesn&#39;t come close to the achievement of “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/the-wild-brilliant-wolf-of-wall-street&quot;>;The Wolf of Wall Street&lt;/a>;”—whose intoxicating depiction of the will to power included profiteers getting their marks to share in the thrill—it nonetheless has an urgency that “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/12/14/hard-bargains&quot;>;The Big Short&lt;/a>;,” mired in the pride of its outrage and the vanity of its antics, never achieves. “Dumb Money,” touching on questions of the authority of personality and the importance of nonfinancial—even completely irrational—motives in the investment world, offers a gleeful romp through strange and treacherous territory that merits a closer, more careful look. ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;9lar61l&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;8zqsyl&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 13 Sep 2023 05:06:01 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Olivia Rodrigo’s Star-Making “Guts”]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.newyorker.com/culture/listening-booth/olivia-rodrigos-star-making-guts]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-12T19:23:55.213Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64ff29d07bca67afaf47e6bd/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Battan-GUTS-Review-Social.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;article >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attribute-verso-pattern=&quot;article-body&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;ArticlePageChunks&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Last month, &lt;em>;Billboard&lt;/em>; published a gloomy survey of record-label executive sentiment about the state of the music industry. Many of those interviewed lamented one unsettling shift in particular—a shift that the label executives themselves were no doubt complicit in creating. They noted that it had become near-impossible to “break” new stars. The sources explained that they could successfully sign loads of new talent and even create digital-era hits that generate millions—if not billions—of streams. The bigger challenge, though, was to find young artists who could break through the noise of the Internet and create the sort of genuine, lasting fandom that turns them into household names and sells out arenas. “Each person I talk to in the industry is more depressed than the person I talked to before them,” one manager said. Given the nature of streaming, and of the TikTok algorithm in particular, the music business has never seemed more gameable—but the ability to create &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/12/12/so-you-want-to-be-a-tiktok-star&quot;>;a viral smash on TikTok&lt;/a>; has also, perversely, led to an oversaturated landscape in which everything feels especially fleeting.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;One rare exception to this dispiriting paradigm shift is the twenty-year-old former Disney star and vocal powerhouse Olivia Rodrigo. Rodrigo became a bona-fide pandemic-era success with her début single “Drivers License,” from 2021, a piano power ballad that is both sweeping and finger-snappy, a post-breakup rumination rendered with unusual clarity. It&#39;s a song that deeply satisfies the core requirement of great pop music—and pop music&#39;s youthful fans—which is to make the mundane feel cinematic: “Yeah, today I drove through the suburbs / And pictured I was driving home to you,” Rodrigo sings.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The song quickly broke streaming records, clocking the single highest number of streams during a single day (holiday music excluded) on Spotify. Rodrigo followed up “Drivers License” with two more hit singles, and then a début album called “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/06/07/how-olivia-rodrigo-became-pops-brightest-new-star&quot;>;Sour&lt;/a>;,” released in the spring of 2021. “Sour” landed at No. 1 on the Billboard album chart and established Rodrigo as one of the finest purveyors of breakup songs in the modern era. (It also won her three Grammys.) Bolstered by her musical-theatre expressiveness, a dynamic soprano, and a sharp lyrical specificity, the eighteen-year-old became not a vanishing sensation but an emotional firebrand and a new generational avatar. She was seemingly anointed to lead the post-&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/on-solar-power-lorde-loves-the-beach&quot;>;Lorde&lt;/a>; and post-&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/billie-eilish-and-the-new-musical-consensus-at-the-grammys&quot;>;Billie Eilish&lt;/a>; wave of alternative-leaning female pop stars. Today, with hindsight, in such an evidently desperate moment for radio pop, “Sour” is being viewed not merely as a breakout star&#39;s début but as perhaps the final successful star-making endeavor in pop history.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;And so Rodrigo&#39;s new record, “Guts,” is loaded not only with the customary sophomore-album expectations but with ideas about the health of an entire industry. The young star, now twenty, has spoken about being paralyzed by these expectations, and feeling frozen as she sat down to write songs. But “Guts,” the new record, does not betray any of that trepidation. If “Sour” was a single-minded project designed to publicly nurse the specific wound from one romantic betrayal, “Guts” is a transitional record on which Rodrigo begins to turn the mirror away from her exes and playfully, brashly toward herself. Rodrigo is at her best, perhaps owing to her acting background, when delivering screeds in a kind of hyper-self-aware, spoken-word register. “Yes, I know that he&#39;s my ex, / But can&#39;t two people reconnect?” she poses with an almost audible wink on “Bad Idea Right?” a song on which she contemplates the self-destruction of rekindling an old romance. “I only see him as a friend / The biggest lie I ever said,” she adds, always shrewdly one step ahead of herself.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Novelty is a critical aspect of any pop sensation&#39;s rise. Part of what made Rodrigo feel fresh was that she was more indebted to various strains of rock music from the late nineties and two-thousands than to the hip-hop influences that had, for many years, become so enmeshed in the pop universe. Rodrigo cites the White Stripes&#39; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/03/13/jack-whites-infinite-imagination&quot;>;Jack White&lt;/a>; as one of her biggest inspirations, and her music is a canny fusion of piano balladry and retro pop-punk, layered with flavors of grunge and emo. It&#39;s a careful selection of styles that work harmoniously with the attitudinal thrust of her music, which sways between cheeky defiance and melodramatic longing. So much of her music sounds like the soundtrack to an early-two-thousands teen drama, each line delivered with an eye roll. And while her music, stylistically, is inherently nostalgic, Rodrigo is a quintessentially modern star in other ways. If pop stars of previous eras attempted to perform sexual maturity beyond their ages, Rodrigo is constantly offering reminders of her adolescent status—or, at least, the idea of adolescence—and revelling in juvenile poses. Lest anyone suspect that she has moved beyond normalcy, she paints a lucid image of bumbling teen-aged relatability: “I laughed at the wrong time, sat with the wrong guy,” she sings on “Ballad of a Homeschooled Girl.” “Searching &#39;how to start a conversation&#39; on a web site.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In the early days of her success, Rodrigo confessed to being the “biggest Swiftie in the world.” She had already indicated as much in April of 2020 when she recorded an impassioned, stripped-down piano cover of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/06/19/taylor-swift-eras-tour-review&quot;>;Taylor Swift&lt;/a>;&#39;s song “Cruel Summer.” Later, Rodrigo acknowledged that “Cruel Summer” had such an influence on her own single “Deja Vu” that Swift would be added to its credits as a co-writer. Swift&#39;s influence can certainly be heard throughout Rodrigo&#39;s work, particularly when she sings—as she almost always does—about romantic betrayal. Rodrigo, like Swift, has mastered the narrative art of dressing down her past loves while rendering herself equal parts victim and victor: “I wanna kiss his face with an uppercut,” she sings on “Get Him Back!,” the lively pop-rock centerpiece of “Guts,” a song with the sweet pep of Toni Basil&#39;s “Mickey” layered with a menacing, vengeful glower. “I wanna meet his mom / Just to tell her her son sucks,” Rodrigo utters, more spewing than singing.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;These days, Rodridgo&#39;s Swift worship has been complicated by professional rivalry, at least in the imagination of her listeners. (One major indicator that an artist has achieved a certain status is when rabid fans begin eagerly reading the tea leaves of their lyrics and concocting tales about them.) When Swift sang, quite piercingly on “Anti-Hero,” that, “Sometimes I feel like everybody is a sexy baby / And I&#39;m a monster on a hill,” some assumed she was taking aim at Rodrigo. With “Guts,” fans have feverishly speculated that a song called “The Grudge” was written with Swift in mind: “You have everything and you still want more,” Rodrigo sings on the bridge. Whether or not Swift is the target of the song, “The Grudge” is still, in one way, about Swift—Rodrigo has taken serious cues from Swift about cleverly infusing her music with cryptic tidbits designed to rouse gossip. It&#39;s a form of sacred cultural knowledge, being passed from one generation&#39;s biggest star to the next. ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot;

Immigration is high, and racism is rampant. Ah Sahm and Ah Toy are strolling through San Francisco&#39;s Chinatown, the only place where they can exist without trouble. This haven, along with most of San Francisco, would eventually be destroyed by the great earthquake of 1906. White architects would be hired to turn the ravaged area into a tourist destination, which is to say, an exotic fantasy—American-style buildings embellished with colorful pagodas, dragon motifs, and other elements of chinoiserie. It is in the original Chinatown, where hope and devastation are twofold, that the television series, based on the writings of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/02/10/exit-the-dragon&quot;>;Bruce Lee&lt;/a>;, takes place.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;For decades, Lee&#39;s TV show, originally called “The Warrior,” was essentially an urban legend. Lee wrote the initial scripts in the late sixties, and the series was teased on “The Pierre Berton Show” in 1971, but it didn&#39;t materialize before Lee&#39;s death in 1973. In 2007, the director Justin Lin, best known at the time for his Asian American coming-of-age film “Better Luck Tomorrow,” made a mockumentary called “Finishing the Game,” about another unfinished Lee project: “Game of Death,” the movie that Lee was working on when he died. A few years later, Lin, who had become steeped in Bruce Lee lore, contacted Lee&#39;s daughter, Shannon, and asked if she still had her father&#39;s pitch materials for “The Warrior.” She gave Lin a binder, which included Lee&#39;s original eight-page show proposal, along with a half-dozen drafts of sample episodes and scenes. Together, Lin and Shannon Lee, along with Jonathan Tropper, the creator of “Banshee,” expanded these materials into “Warrior,” which premièred in 2019, and recently concluded its third season.&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;At the start of the series, Ah Sahm, the show&#39;s protagonist, is standing in an immigration line, having just arrived from China. A fellow-migrant is getting pushed around by a trio of white immigration officers, and Ah Sahm jumps to protect him. An officer slaps Ah Sahm, who turns his head slowly and says, “I wouldn&#39;t do that again if I were you.” The fighting that follows is brutal and fast, belied by a funky bass that makes the protagonist&#39;s steps feel rhythmic. Even those who watch “Warrior” without knowing the series&#39; relation to Bruce Lee will notice that Ah Sahm moves like him. Kung-fu characters are heroic, suspended in the disbelief of a (sometimes cheesy) epic; they&#39;re the Greek mythology of East Asia. But if the hero has a believable swagger, as Ah Sahm does, one&#39;s mind instantly darts to Lee. During the fight, I half expected Ah Sahm to let out a shriek—an imitation of Lee&#39;s infamous battle cry, which defined the actor&#39;s singular presence in pop culture. Its use became commensurately racist for the generations of Asian Americans that followed: growing up, I only knew Lee as the minstrel performed at me. But Ah Sahm, who is played by a mixed-race British Japanese actor, is unmistakably modern, with his bravado manifesting in the smooth insults of a proficient English speaker. (“I didn&#39;t travel halfway across the world in that damn boat just to amuse a few fat white fucks,” he tells the officers.) The brawl, which Ah Sahm wins handily, is the kind of thing that a nonwhite person fantasizes about after being treated as subhuman—a kick-ass solution to a miasmic attack. Other television series have played on a similar impulse: in “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/12/09/the-incendiary-aims-of-hbos-watchmen&quot;>;Watchmen&lt;/a>;,” also on Max, a Black cop narrowly escapes a lynching but leaves the noose around his neck, as a form of battle garb, before stomping on a gathering of unhooded Klansmen.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Shortly after his run-in with the immigration officers, Ah Sahm is picked up by a fixer named Wang Chao (Hoon Lee), who brings him to a crime family known as the Hop Wei. Wang, the only character who maintains his Qing dynasty queue, speaks Cantonese. But, during Wang&#39;s introduction of Ah Sahm to the Hop Wei, the show uses a camera trick that Tropper refers to as “ &#39;&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.inverse.com/article/54713-bruce-lee-warrior-does-not-have-chinese-speak-cantonese&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.inverse.com/article/54713-bruce-lee-warrior-does-not-have-chinese-speak-cantonese&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.inverse.com/article/54713-bruce-lee-warrior-does-not-have-chinese-speak-cantonese&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;The Hunt for Red October&#39; transition&lt;/a>;.” The camera pans around Wang, and his speech suddenly changes from subtitled Cantonese to fluent American English, turning the audience into native speakers of his language. The camera trick serves as a kind of racist-vibes jammer—preventing viewers from otherizing Wang.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;But there&#39;s a cost to translation. The series nods to the Chinglish patois spoken in Chinatown, where words that have hard stops are pronounced instead with tones held as connective filler, the tenors of which can be expressions on their own. The “Ah” (&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;http://www.cantonese.sheik.co.uk/dictionary/characters/934/&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;http://www.cantonese.sheik.co.uk/dictionary/characters/934/&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;http://www.cantonese.sheik.co.uk/dictionary/characters/934/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;阿&lt;/a>;) in Ah Sahm is a word in Cantonese that, depending on the speaker&#39;s lilt, can sound like “Yo Sahm” or “Heyyy Sahm,” a familiar but non-gendered Sahm. And yet the complexity of Cantonese as a developed system of communicating familiarity (and of communicating insults) is lost by making the show so English-forward. “Warrior” compensates for this by infusing the dialogue with wit and attitude, which is perhaps the essence of Cantonese, and the essence of Bruce Lee himself.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Warrior” tells the story of two crime families—the Hop Wei, which Ah Sahm ultimately joins, and the Long Zii—who are embroiled in a conflict that&#39;s known as the Tong Wars. Lin has said that he was eager to develop a relegated history while also making mainstream entertainment. “I&#39;ve always felt like it&#39;s such an American story, but never told,” he explained, in a &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://nerdist.com/article/bruce-lees-warrior-is-finally-a-tv-show/&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://nerdist.com/article/bruce-lees-warrior-is-finally-a-tv-show/&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://nerdist.com/article/bruce-lees-warrior-is-finally-a-tv-show/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;2019 interview&lt;/a>;. “Warrior” expands our ideas of what constitutes “American history” by partly focussing on another competition—between the Irish and Chinese communities in San Francisco. The Irish community is led by Dylan Leary (Dean Jagger), a de-facto labor organizer who goes to extreme lengths to maim Chinese workers in sought-after jobs, negotiating with American robber barons and elected officials. Meanwhile, the Long Zii make a deal with a nativist deputy mayor, in exchange for opium and increased policing of the Hop Wei. The deputy, who aspires to become the next mayor of San Francisco, encourages disorder in Chinatown so that he can run on a platform that involves ejecting all Chinese residents from the city. But he&#39;s also interested in something more systematic: the creation of legislation to restrict immigration by targeting one specific ethnic group. Leary and the Long Zii both represent marginalized groups that have sold out for marginal power. It&#39;s a clear charter to respective destruction, for the Long Zii especially, since their turf war will inevitably end with an immigration ban that will last more than sixty years, followed by another twenty-plus years of restrictions.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;At times, “Warrior” can feel radical. It not only conjures figures who have rarely been centered on television before but also supplies these characters with rich inner lives. Still, there&#39;s an occasional narrowness, which might be attributed to the fact that the show was conceived in the nineteen-sixties, by an actor who was predominantly interested in documenting the Chinese experience in America. There are barely any Black characters present, aside from a drug dealer and a vixen bartender, and their story lines are bland, despite occurring in the period immediately following Reconstruction. Even if the show&#39;s focus is on Irish immigrants and Chinese people making a deal with whitey to tear one another down, it seems like there&#39;s still an opportunity to shift the camera to nearby &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://citypln-m-extnl.sfgov.org/SharedLinks.aspx?accesskey=6c9268a3b4e209f3b3b3b0c3e35af33442b2b16f87560e40c8ade03707223a23&amp;amp;VaultGUID=A4A7DACD-B0DC-4322-BD29-F6F07103C6E0&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://citypln-m-extnl.sfgov.org/SharedLinks.aspx?accesskey=6c9268a3b4e209f3b3b3b0c3e35af33442b2b16f87560e40c8ade03707223a23&amp;amp;VaultGUID=A4A7DACD-B0DC-4322-BD29-F6F07103C6E0&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://citypln-m-extnl.sfgov.org/SharedLinks.aspx?accesskey=6c9268a3b4e209f3b3b3b0c3e35af33442b2b16f87560e40c8ade03707223a23&amp;amp;VaultGUID=A4A7DACD-B0DC-4322-BD29-F6F07103C6E0&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;Stone Street&lt;/a>;, which was once the only Black enclave in San Francisco.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;It might feel nitpicky to criticize an Asian American show for overlooking the strife of other racial groups, but the absence is noticeable in an ambitious period piece that aims to depict America&#39;s forgotten histories, as well as the scourge of white supremacy. And it&#39;s especially noticeable in 2023, when the narrow focus of “Warrior” feels not unlike the politics of Asian parents whose calls for racial equality have helped bring about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/why-the-champions-of-affirmative-action-had-to-leave-asian-americans-behind&quot;>;the end of affirmative action&lt;/a>;. Siloing history has an unintended effect of tiering suffering. It also allows groups, driven by their own ethnocentric proclivities, to roll back the progress that others have made.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;When the three creators of “Warrior” sought to revive Lee&#39;s project, they focussed on shifting the proposal away from the adventure-of-the-week format that was popular in Lee&#39;s time and creating something more cinematic and prestige TV-like—the kind of thing that would feel at home on HBO. But, by leaving the rest intact, they inherited the blindspots of the classic kung-fu films to which “Warrior” is a loving tribute. Take, for example, the nineties film franchise “Once Upon a Time in China,” which starred Jet Li as a fictionalized Wong Fei-hung, a physician and fighter who defends the Chinese way of life in an ailing Qing dynasty from warlords. Or the “Ip Man” franchise, which follows the story of Bruce Lee&#39;s martial-arts instructor as he fights Japanese occupiers in Foshan during the Second World War, before his forced migration to Hong Kong. Both follow the standard format of kung-fu flicks, by supplying the hero with increasingly challenging opponents whom he must defeat. Each opponent has an advantage over the hero by being bigger and stronger or armed with a unique weapon. But the underdog hero prevails by being smart and remaining composed. These movies, kung-fu westerns, are loosely based around the imperialist scramble to carve up China, and yet it doesn&#39;t really matter what external or systemic factors are leading to societal disarray, as those mostly serve as a backdrop. The only thing that matters is the protagonist&#39;s journey of overcoming his personal challenges. It&#39;s an innocuous if not classic story, but what does prolonged exposure to fictionalized history—or a speculative reality—amount to?&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;aopv4xj&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;yfuf29&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;I&#39;ll call it kung-fu politics—a one-sided, regressive vision of the world, developed from action movies. Perhaps the best example is the actor Jackie Chan, who moved the dial in the genre from Qing dynasty kung-fu masters to hero cops. Chan, who won audience&#39;s hearts by playing a goofy and delightful protagonist, would eventually come to represent a singular force for good, both onscreen and in real life. But play the hero police officer too often, and it&#39;s easy to drift into authoritarian thinking. Over the years, Chan has made comments about how “we Chinese need to be controlled,” or else “we&#39;ll just do what we want.” Chan, along with Donnie Yen—the star of a revamped “Ip Man” film franchise—have opposed &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/12/16/hong-kongs-protest-movement-and-the-fight-for-the-citys-soul&quot;>;the pro-democracy protests&lt;/a>; in Hong Kong, with Chan signing a petition in support of the draconian Chinese security law that was passed to quash the dissent, and Yen calling the dissenters rioters.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Warrior” wishes to evolve the kung-fu genre, rather than challenge it outright. This is partly done through the show&#39;s fight scenes. In an interview several years ago, Ip Chun, the son of Ip Man, who is in his late nineties and has taken over as grand master for his father, spoke about the inevitability of martial arts moving away from Wing Chun, the style of fighting that his father helped Bruce Lee master. “My thought is that the future society that necessitates the need for violence to resolve an issue will be less and less,” he said. “Someone who emphasizes Wing Chun and relies on it for fighting—like one person fighting nine,” he added, “Well, I say it&#39;s of no help solving society&#39;s problems.” For him, Wing Chun is mostly a “health regimen”—a historically and symbolically rich version of Zumba.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In “Warrior,” martial arts is more than just a health regimen. (Bruce Lee himself, understanding the fantastical nature of action stories, said in 1971 that his show would have to be set in the West: “How else can you justify all this punching and kicking and violence?”) Ah Sahm, in his battles with the Long Zii, often fights alongside the Hop Wei prince, played by Jason Tobin, another mixed-race Chinese British actor, who was born in Hong Kong. Tobin&#39;s character—which is not unlike his character in “Better Luck Tomorrow”—might be best described as “stabby.” He is a stereotype of a kind of pent-up Chinese American aggression. Ah Sahm&#39;s fighting is more thoughtful, elegant, and deliberate. He is a master of Wing Chun, but, as the series goes on, he transitions to Jeet Kune Do, a more efficient and flexible form of mixed martial arts, invented by Lee. (It has been said that the style is the forerunner to the mixed martial arts that is used by today&#39;s UFC fighters.) His movements, a cadence of pulses through his upper torso, with bounces in his shoulders matched by misdirection from his arms and feet, can be reminiscent of a b-boy toprock, a callback to an origin of hip-hop dance.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In both fighting and dance, the body is the main vehicle of expression—ideas, emotions, and history are sublimated into movements that can be explosively deliberate or tranquil. Tropper has talked about how “Warrior” relies on its battle scenes for character development. “I get very into the weeds on the fights, as expressions of the characters and as expressions of what the story is,” he said, in an interview. “Every fight has to tell a story. It can&#39;t just be two guys duking it out.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;“Warrior” likes to switch between elevating action—using it as a way to express key themes—and explicitly nodding to the pulpy seduction of kung fu. It&#39;s a continuation of Bruce Lee&#39;s work: the actor was known for balancing heady ideas while still entertaining audiences with his sheer physicality. But it&#39;s a delicate balance, and, as the show progresses, it becomes harder for the characters to slip their warrior personas on and off. In the third season, a woman encounters Ah Sahm and sees him not as he sees himself—a benevolent outcast finding his path—but as the Hop Wei gangster he publicly presents as. He is practicing shirtless with nunchucks (another Bruce Lee tableau), and the woman sarcastically plays down his prowess. At the end of the scene, she leaves, blushing. Ah Sahm, a little confused, continues training. ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;tvxs2&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 12 Sep 2023 19:06:01 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[How to Decolonize the City]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/how-to-decolonize-the-city]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-12T10:00:00.000Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64f9fc78329a6c3c46f69dc0/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Hawthorne-Decolonization-New-Lead.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;article >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attribute-verso-pattern=&quot;article-body&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;ArticlePageChunks&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;What does it mean—what would it mean—to “decolonize the city”? As that phrase has become common among architects, artists, and activists in recent years, it has operated more like a slogan, a blunt exhortation, than a plan of action. A growing critique of the imperial and colonial legacies of Western powers, accelerating with the rise of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/03/14/where-is-black-lives-matter-headed&quot;>;Black Lives Matter&lt;/a>; movement, has cracked open the question of how European nations and the United States built the wealth that funded some of their greatest wonders of architecture, art, and urban form, and revealed the violence that supported it. Protesters took this critique into the streets by toppling, decapitating, or defacing dozens of statues honoring colonial and pro-slavery figures; cities, proactively, took down others. Scores of institutions with contested names chose new ones: Brooklyn&#39;s General Lee Avenue was renamed for the Black Army officer John Warren, killed in Vietnam at twenty-two; Junipero Serra High School, in San Diego, is now Canyon Hills High.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;But what comes next? How will cities grapple with the more difficult question of what to do with fraught landmarks that are more immovable than those statues—museums, train stations, and private houses, say—or whose connections to racism or slavery, while significant, are tougher to precisely trace? Perhaps, before we can get a clearer sense of what decolonizing the city will look like, we need to better understand how, and by what architectural means, it was colonized in the first place.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;One of the most compelling explorations I&#39;ve seen of where decolonization efforts might turn next was on view this summer at an architecture museum in Brussels called &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://civa.brussels/en&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://civa.brussels/en&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://civa.brussels/en&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;&lt;em >;CIVA&lt;/em>;&lt;/a>;, for Centre International pour la Ville et l&#39;Architecture. “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://civa.brussels/en/exhibitions-events/style-congo&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://civa.brussels/en/exhibitions-events/style-congo&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://civa.brussels/en/exhibitions-events/style-congo&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;Style Congo: Heritage &amp;amp; Heresy&lt;/a>;,” curated by Sammy Baloji, Silvia Franceschini, Nikolaus Hirsch, and Estelle Lecaille, was able to say something meaningful about the sprawling task of decolonization by focussing on the architectural by-products of a single imperial campaign: Belgium&#39;s violent and lucrative occupation and eventual colonization of Congo, under King Leopold II.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The style in “Style Congo” is Art Nouveau. Once understood primarily as an inventive but transitional movement that allowed the last embers of Victorian revivalism to burn themselves out, clearing the way for the streamlined abstraction of modernism, Art Nouveau found particularly vital expression in Belgium, in architecture by Victor Horta, Paul Hankar, and Henry van de Velde, and in art works by Philippe Wolfers and others. Crucially, Art Nouveau also emerged in Belgium around the same time that Leopold, in 1885, became the ruler of the new Congo Free State, which he operated as his personal fiefdom, pulling out its stores of rubber and ivory, until Congo became an official Belgian colony in 1908. What is now the Democratic Republic of the Congo gained independence in 1960, and was known as Zaire from 1971 to 1997.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Historians have long described Art Nouveau, with its fluid, snaking ornament, as “&lt;em>;le style coup de fouet&lt;/em>;”: the whiplash style. But it&#39;s only in recent years that scholars, looking more deeply into the connections between Art Nouveau and imperialism, have directly linked either phrase to the vast human toll Belgium exacted in Africa. The writer Adam Hochschild, whose 1998 book “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/King-Leopolds-Ghost-Heroism-Colonial/dp/0618001905&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/King-Leopolds-Ghost-Heroism-Colonial/dp/0618001905&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/King-Leopolds-Ghost-Heroism-Colonial/dp/0618001905&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;King Leopold&#39;s Ghost&lt;/a>;” first exposed a wide reading public to the history of Belgian imperialism in Africa, estimates that “toll of Holocaust dimensions” at ten million lives; others use somewhat lower, if still staggering, figures, which can range from five million to eight million Congolese deaths between 1885 and 1908.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Belgian Art Nouveau, as the UCLA art historian Debora Silverman put it in an incisive lecture at &lt;em >;CIVA&lt;/em>;, was “created from raw materials from the Congo and inspired by Congo motifs.” Even more striking, she has suggested that Art Nouveau was the specific means by which the violence carried out in Leopold&#39;s name in Congo snapped back and found its way, in abstracted or semi-abstracted form, into Belgian culture—allowing that small and geographically squeezed nation, its nineteenth-century ambitions largely thwarted at home, to indulge, through its art and architecture, in “a fantasy of domination.” Silverman sees not just natural and animal forms “embodied” in Art Nouveau&#39;s curves; she also sees the leather whips that Belgian forces used to bloody Congolese laborers.&lt;/p>;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;feature-default&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;image&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:feature-default&quot;>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;Art work by Daniela Ortiz depicting people on a hill crying with text in French above them&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64f8a5efe24859185f471c35/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Hawthorne-Decolonization-Lead.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64f8a5efe24859185f471c35/master/w_120,c_limit/Hawthorne-Decolonization-Lead.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64f8a5efe24859185f471c35/master/w_240,c_limit/Hawthorne-Decolonization-Lead.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64f8a5efe24859185f471c35/master/w_320,c_limit/Hawthorne-Decolonization-Lead.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64f8a5efe24859185f471c35/master/w_640,c_limit/Hawthorne-Decolonization-Lead.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64f8a5efe24859185f471c35/master/w_960,c_limit/Hawthorne-Decolonization-Lead.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64f8a5efe24859185f471c35/master/w_1280,c_limit/Hawthorne-Decolonization-Lead.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64f8a5efe24859185f471c35/master/w_1600,c_limit/Hawthorne-Decolonization-Lead.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;The Rebellion of the Roots (France).&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Art work by Daniele Ortiz / Kadist Collection Paris / Courtesy CIVA&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/inline-embed>;&lt;p >;The first thing visitors to “Style Congo” encountered was “Monument,” a 2005 work by the German artist Peggy Buth, that takes the form of an asymmetrical and empty black plinth. Though the art work predates the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-death-of-george-floyd-in-context&quot;>;murder of George Floyd&lt;/a>; and the Black Lives Matter movement, it succeeded here in pointing the way forward: Its placement in the museum&#39;s lobby suggested that “Style Congo” took the post-BLM world, with its toppled statues and vacated pedestals, as a given—an uncertain starting point.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Inside the exhibition galleries, the focus was on the way that Art Nouveau and representations of Congo overlapped and fed one another in a range of international expos and other colonial exhibitions between 1885 and 1958. (The expos essentially announced that Congo was open for business, so long as investors could strike the right deal with Leopold and his successors.) The centerpiece was a large installation by the Brussels collective Traumnovelle, a group described by its founders, the architects Léone Drapeaud, Manuel León Fanjul, and Johnny Leya, as a “militant faction.” On wire-metal walls that resemble screens used for archival shelving, Traumnovelle had hung scores of architectural drawings, photographs, brochures, newspaper clippings, and other materials reflecting the influence of Congo on Belgian architecture, from the founding of the Congo Free State through the Brussels World&#39;s Fair of 1958.&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Along the perimeter of the &lt;em >;CIVA&lt;/em>; galleries and in adjoining spaces, as if looking over the archival materials in the center in patient judgment, were works by another half-dozen architects, scholars, and contemporary artists, some newly commissioned by the curators. One was a series of portraits by the photographer Chrystel Mukeba of Congolese Belgians posing inside Art Nouveau landmarks, including the elaborately ornamented house that Victor Horta designed in the eighteen-nineties for Edmond van Eetvelde, who administered the Congo Free State for Leopold. Mukeba told a reporter for the Belgian &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.theparliamentmagazine.eu/news/article/art-nouveau-year-brussels&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.theparliamentmagazine.eu/news/article/art-nouveau-year-brussels&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.theparliamentmagazine.eu/news/article/art-nouveau-year-brussels&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;magazine&lt;/a>; &lt;em>;The Parliament&lt;/em>; that half of the building owners she approached never got back to her or turned her down: “A fashion shoot or something like that, there&#39;s no issue,” she said. “But as soon as you start to want to have people of African descent pose,” she added, “then it becomes a lot more complicated.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;This is hardly a surprise. By many accounts, Belgium has been slow to grapple with its Congolese legacy. Last year, a commission established in 2020 by the Belgian parliament &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.justiceinfo.net/en/111372-belgian-colonial-past-commission-fails-apology-to-victims.html&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.justiceinfo.net/en/111372-belgian-colonial-past-commission-fails-apology-to-victims.html&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.justiceinfo.net/en/111372-belgian-colonial-past-commission-fails-apology-to-victims.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;deadlocked&lt;/a>; on the basic question of whether the country should issue a formal apology for its colonial past, to say nothing of larger issues like reparations. But the dam had begun to break, or at least crack, by the late nineteen-nineties. “King Leopold&#39;s Ghost,” which became a worldwide best-seller, appeared in 1998, followed the next year by Ludo De Witte&#39;s “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Assassination-Lumumba-Ludo-Witte/dp/1859844103&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Assassination-Lumumba-Ludo-Witte/dp/1859844103&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Assassination-Lumumba-Ludo-Witte/dp/1859844103&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;The Assassination of Lumumba&lt;/a>;,” which examined the Belgian government&#39;s role, together with the CIA and the Belgian mining company Union Minière du Haut-Katanga, in the removal and assassination of Patrice Lumumba, the independent Congo&#39;s first Prime Minister, by his political rivals. After Lumumba&#39;s body was chopped into pieces, it was dissolved in a barrel of sulfuric acid supplied, according to De Witte, by Union Minière, which also provided the copper and tin for a statue of Leopold that still stands next to the royal palace in Brussels.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;In 2005, the Royal Museum for Central Africa, in Tervuren, formerly the Royal Museum of the Belgian Congo, mounted an exhibition called “La Mémoire du Congo: Le Temps Colonial.” Hochschild &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2005/10/06/in-the-heart-of-darkness/&quot;>;found&lt;/a>; the show “evasive”; Belgium still appeared to him to be struggling to wake from the century-long national amnesia that he has dubbed “the great forgetting.” Silverman similarly criticized the exhibition for a “tepid and reluctant revisionism.” She credits a decorative-arts survey the same year at a different institution, the Royal Museums of Art and History in Brussels, with making the depths of the connection between Art Nouveau and the Congo Free State apparent. The show included an art work from 1897 by Philippe Wolfers called “Civilization and Barbarism.” Made of Congolese ivory provided to the artist by Leopold, it features two figures in battle: a swan (to represent Belgium and the “civilization” of the title) against a dragon, standing in for “barbarism.” Silverman told me that seeing this work unmasked “the ideology propelling the project” of the Congo Free State and suggested just how deeply it was embedded within the most significant Belgian art works of the period. This same ideology helped give rise to the story Belgians sometimes told themselves about the nation&#39;s exploitation of Congo: that the occupation was driven in significant part by a desire to free or protect Africans from slavery.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;a7ot9&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;cp7lm&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Silverman told me that another part of her epiphany had to do with the US invasion and occupation of Iraq, which reminded her in certain ways of Belgium&#39;s campaigns in the Congo Free State. In both cases, “You had violence at a distance, and empire at a distance. The parallels there were very powerful. Violence that you can&#39;t see.” These insights seemed to demand a new look at Art Nouveau, one that she and a growing number of scholars have dedicated the intervening years to exploring.&lt;/p>;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;feature-default&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;image&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:feature-default&quot;>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;Person sitting in a chair in a room with green wallpaper&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64f8a5efbeacd4c1a93b9249/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Hawthorne-Decolonization-Secondary.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64f8a5efbeacd4c1a93b9249/master/w_120,c_limit/Hawthorne-Decolonization-Secondary.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64f8a5efbeacd4c1a93b9249/master/w_240,c_limit/Hawthorne-Decolonization-Secondary.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64f8a5efbeacd4c1a93b9249/master/w_320,c_limit/Hawthorne-Decolonization-Secondary.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64f8a5efbeacd4c1a93b9249/master/w_640,c_limit/Hawthorne-Decolonization-Secondary.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64f8a5efbeacd4c1a93b9249/master/w_960,c_limit/Hawthorne-Decolonization-Secondary.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64f8a5efbeacd4c1a93b9249/master/w_1280,c_limit/Hawthorne-Decolonization-Secondary.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64f8a5efbeacd4c1a93b9249/master/w_1600,c_limit/Hawthorne-Decolonization-Secondary.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;Leonie Ngoie, Hôtel van Eetvelde.&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Photograph by Chrystel Mukeba / Courtesy CIVA&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/inline-embed>;&lt;p >;Which brings us to the current moment. In a recent &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.e-flux.com/architecture/appropriations/536502/editorial/&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.e-flux.com/architecture/appropriations/536502/editorial/&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.e-flux.com/architecture/appropriations/536502/editorial/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;article&lt;/a>; (co-written with the editor Nick Axel), the “Style Congo” curators argue, “the protest, defacing, and at times removal of monuments in public space around the world has been a meaningful step. 。 。 。 But what about the buildings that colonialism built? What about the aesthetic experiences they are designed to instill—of beauty, of wonder, of fear, of pride? What about the language we have to understand the past and present, and to imagine the future? There is still much work to be done.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Some of that work, surely, includes a newfound focus on detail and nuance. The Belgian experience, for instance, doesn&#39;t fit at all neatly into narratives suggested by the phrase “settler colonialism,” which is sometimes used in academia as a catchall term, smoothing over important historical and political distinctions. What Belgium practiced in Africa in the Congo Free State period was not colonialism but imperialism—building an empire of extraction. For Leopold, who never set foot in Congo himself, an arms-length approach remained highly lucrative: estimates of his personal profit from Congo, in today&#39;s dollars, exceed a billion dollars.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;This focus on clarity, of task and historical precedent, may be helpful when it comes to answering the tricky question of what to do with buildings whose origins, architectural and otherwise, are inextricable from imperial or colonial violence. In Belgium&#39;s case, this will apply primarily to the fate of landmarks and other public works that were commissioned by Leopold and paid for directly with wealth earned via the Congo Free State. The scale and ambition of such projects marked a major shift for Belgium and its royal family, which before 1885 had been highly constrained in power and reach. These landmarks, which earned Leopold the nickname the Builder King, include, among many other examples, Antwerp&#39;s central railway station; the ceremonial avenue linking Brussels and Tervuren that Leopold built ahead of the Brussels International Exhibition in 1897; Brussels&#39;s massive triumphal arch, modelled on Rome&#39;s Arch of Constantine but far larger; and the Royal Galleries in the seaside resort town of Ostend.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;The station in Antwerp, designed by Louis Delacenserie in an eclectic brand of style, including Art Nouveau, and built between 1899 and 1905, is a representative case. It would be tough to find many Belgians who think it should be fundamentally altered, to say nothing of demolished, as it remains in operation and ranks as one of Antwerp&#39;s most recognizable works of architecture. It became a protected landmark in 1975. Yet it is nothing less than an architectural portrait of Belgium&#39;s imperial king, whose treasury was stuffed with wealth earned through violence and extraction in Congo.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In a very direct sense, what would be the appropriate decolonizing response to a building like that? Should signage be added explaining the connection between its architectural grandeur and Belgium&#39;s actions in Congo? Should something more dramatic be considered? What form might that take, and who would be responsible for approving it? Belgium&#39;s infamously fragmented and fractious political system, which helped sink the ambitions of the parliamentary commission, seems guaranteed to make this process complicated.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Brussels has declared 2023 “the Year of Art Nouveau.” In October, the city&#39;s Center for Fine Arts, known as Bozar, will open “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.bozar.be/en/calendar/victor-horta-and-grammar-art-nouveau&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.bozar.be/en/calendar/victor-horta-and-grammar-art-nouveau&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bozar.be/en/calendar/victor-horta-and-grammar-art-nouveau&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;Victor Horta and the Grammar of Art Nouveau&lt;/a>;,” which in exploring links between the architect&#39;s work and the Congo Free State will mark a significant step forward for the ninety-five-year-old museum, following the example set by the younger &lt;em >;CIVA&lt;/em>;, which was founded in 2016.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Are phrases like “decolonize the city” too broad or vague—or, as others would have it, too bluntly insistent—to win broad-based popular support? Such complaints strike me as short-sighted: Radically simple demands continue to succeed in slicing through hardened policy and conventional wisdom and opening up space for genuine reform. All the same, such language does need to give way, at a certain point, to the sustained work of more systematically disentangling the urban form of Western cities from their colonial and imperial roots. We need a methodology for this emerging mode of cultural policy: To decide which buildings and other objects that grew from those roots should stay and which should go—and which, beyond that too-simple equation, might be reimagined, redesigned, or otherwise recontextualized in unexpected ways (and how, and by whom).&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Style Congo” is a significant step in this direction. Art Nouveau turns out to be a particularly apt emblem of the insidious power of a world view that over many decades threaded its way into the foundations of twentieth-century Western architecture and urban design. As Silverman put it in her &lt;em >;CIVA&lt;/em>; lecture, Art Nouveau, with its vinelike curves, “laps over and latches on—it&#39;s an aggressive form of nature, and it cleaves, rips, and grips.” Effectively stripping our institutions, and our cities, of the most damaging of these clinging remnants will be the work of several generations. It will require advocacy not only of a patient but of a precise and imaginative kind. ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;wcqvzn&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 12 Sep 2023 19:06:01 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
