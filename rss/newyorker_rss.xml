Strohm 在格里菲斯去世前构思的。它现在作为一种音乐纪念馆。 Jarosz 演唱了《More Than a Whisper》中的第一首歌：一首温柔的民谣歌曲，翻唱自 Griffith 1982 年第二张专辑《Poet in My Window》中的民谣《You Can&#39;t Go Home Again》。 Jarosz 在德克萨斯州温伯利长大，距离格里菲斯的家乡奥斯汀不远，她告诉我，当她从格里菲斯的二十多张唱片的深厚目录中选择要翻唱的歌曲时，她选择了这首歌，因为她父母对这首歌的喜爱。格里菲斯以她最喜欢的作家之一托马斯·沃尔夫 (Thomas Wolfe) 于 1940 年出版的一本遗作小说命名了这首歌，她经常在专辑内注中感谢他。知道这一点后，雅罗斯的父母有一次带着一本小说去参加南奇·格里菲斯在奥斯汀仙人掌咖啡馆举行的音乐会，并恳求这位歌手在这本书上签名。格里菲斯在上面写道：“南奇，再次回家。”这本书成为了一种传家宝。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;这段铭文的一个讽刺之处在于，格里菲斯很少有宾至如归的感觉，无论是在德克萨斯州还是在音乐中，格里菲斯的唱片所捕捉到的怀旧的地方感也是如此。行业。她的长期制作人兼合作者吉姆·鲁尼在最近的一次电话中告诉我，“我认为她长期感到不受重视。”格里菲斯于 2021 年 8 月 13 日去世时，她正在田纳西州纳什维尔过着隐居的生活。她已经九年多没有录制专辑了，也有七年多没有演出了。她的管理层仅解释说，她死于“自然原因”，格里菲斯本人要求在她去世一周后才发表正式声明。一周过去了，没有任何进一步的声明出现。粉丝们纷纷猜测。她曾两次与癌症作斗争，据她自己承认，多年来她一直在与严重的抑郁症作斗争，正如她曾经告诉记者的那样，这种抑郁症有时会导致“酗酒、服用各种药片、做任何会让我情绪低落的事情”。离开那堵墙。”她在晚年的生活中一直在培养一种严格保护自己的隐私并培养一种疏离感。 “她身上有一种非常孤独的性格，”鲁尼说。 “这并不是因为其他人不喜欢她的工作。”他补充道，“这对我来说是她晚年最难处理的事情——这个信息似乎没有传达给她。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;鲁尼制作了出现在“”中的三首歌曲。不仅仅是耳语”，但在她去世后不久，他也发现自己承担了一个规模更大的格里菲斯项目。令他惊讶的是，格里菲斯给他留下了她前三张唱片的母版，以及一本未出版的小说《两个善良的心》的手稿，该小说讲述了一个来自德克萨斯州的女孩离开该州去寻找冒险的故事。八月，他自行出版了这本书，并通过 Craft Records 发行了格里菲斯前四张专辑的精美新盒装重新发行版：“There&#39;s a Light BeyondThese Woods”（1978）、“Poet in My Window”（1982） 、《千载难逢》(1985)和《最后的忠实信徒》(1986)。除了监督音频的忠实重制外，最初制作“蓝月亮”和“真正信徒”的鲁尼还整理了格里菲斯早年的广泛口述历史，以配合该收藏。通过一系列的采访，一个年轻、乐观、雄心勃勃、善于合作、善于交际的格里菲斯出现了——尽管她顽强的孤独从一开始就很明显。十九世纪七十年代末，格里菲斯从奥斯汀搬到休斯敦后不久，乔伊·勒沃伦 (Joy Lewallen) 与她当时的丈夫、歌手兼作曲家埃里克·泰勒 (Eric Taylor) 成了朋友。安德森博览会 (Anderson Fair) 的一张桌子，这家餐厅后来成为休斯顿民谣音乐的中心，汤斯·范·赞特 (Townes Van Zandt) 和露辛达·威廉姆斯 (Lucinda Williams) 等人经常光顾。 “南奇会在一个角落里，吃一盘意大利面，喝着 Shiner 或 Lone Star，创作一首歌，”勒瓦伦回忆道。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;鲁尼将重新发行的套装称为“在角落里工作，这也是格里菲斯二十八岁时发行的第二张专辑中的一首歌曲的标题。他告诉我，他的意思是这个标题充满希望，是对一位新兴艺术家的职业道德的认可。但他也表示，就像格里菲斯的同名曲子一样，它带有一丝忧郁的色彩。这首歌也许是她录制过的我最喜欢的歌曲，是一首优美的、精简的原声哀歌——只有格里菲斯和她的吉他，以及在空灵的甜美和喉音之间摇摆的声音。格里菲斯唱的是一位职业音乐家独自旅行，带着一杯威士忌和陌生人作为她唯一的同伴。这是音乐家在夜幕降临时，当离开酒吧的掉队者呼喊着再唱一首歌时，演奏的那种泪流满面的曲子。对我来说，它几乎总是能引起大哭。我最喜欢的诗句是最后一首，格里菲斯唱道：“早上五点的这些城市街道/我会停下来给你打电话/但我快到家了。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;在纸面上，当格里菲斯十二岁时第一次在奥斯汀咖啡馆唱歌时，她所取得的成就似乎是不可救药的牵强附会。她二十四岁时在独立厂牌 BF Deal 录制了她的第一张专辑，并在不到十年后与纳什维尔主要厂牌 MCA 签约。 1994 年，她凭借翻唱唱片《Other Voices, Other Rooms》荣获格莱美最佳当代民谣专辑奖。她与 Emmylou Harris、&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/postscript/john-prines-perfect-songs&quot;>;John Prine&lt;/a>;、Don McLean、&lt;a href =&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/03/28/retirement-the-margaritaville-way&quot;>;吉米·巴菲特&lt;/a>;、阿洛·格思里，甚至是她儿时的偶像之一，民谣歌手&lt; a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/how-odetta-revolutionized-folk-music&quot;>;奥德塔&lt;/a>;。尽管如此，格里菲斯常常对自己在音乐界的地位感到不安。她对一名记者说，一位马华高管告诉她，“我永远不会上电台，因为我的声音会伤害人们的耳朵。”尽管她是爱尔兰真正的明星，她 1987 年版本的朱莉·戈尔德 (Julie Gold) 的歌曲《From a Distance》在爱尔兰名列前十，但她有时也表示感觉自己被美国音乐界的其他艺术家所掩盖。贝蒂·米德勒最终使《From a Distance》在美国红极一时，格里菲斯允许崭露头角的乡村明星凯西·马蒂亚翻唱她的歌曲《Love at the Five and Dime》。两个版本于同一年发布；格里菲斯的原作没有上榜，而马蒂亚的则排名第三。格里菲斯可能对记者很敏感。 1998年，她给德克萨斯州的几家报纸写了一封愤怒的公开信，痛斥这些报纸的批评者，因为她认为德克萨斯州媒体普遍蔑视她的工作。她在信中写道：“我始终感到自豪，也知道伟大的事物来自我的祖国——很少有人能回到那里。”这封信刊登在《休斯敦纪事报》和《休斯敦纪事报》上。奥斯汀&lt;em>;纪事&lt;/em>;。 “毕竟，德克萨斯州是地球上唯一真正吃掉幼崽的地方。”格里菲斯在信中将自己与作家凯瑟琳·安妮·波特进行了比较，后者出生于德克萨斯州印第安河，但一生的大部分时间都在格林威治村、墨西哥和欧洲等地的波西米亚飞地中度过。格里菲斯在谈到波特时写道：“她也有摆脱困境的智慧。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;格里菲斯经历的部分原因是时机问题。她另类的、自我意识的艺术审美——更像是史蒂夫·尼克斯而不是塔米·怀内特——也许能让格里菲斯成为一名可行的流行歌星，但她搬到纳什维尔的时期正值音乐家史蒂夫·厄尔称之为“巨大的可信度恐慌”的时期。让威利·尼尔森和梅尔·哈格德成名的“都市牛仔”时代已经结束，许多乡村音乐巨星——肯尼·罗杰斯、琳达·朗斯塔特和阿拉巴马——正在跨入主流。纳什维尔的高管们不愿意因为流行电台而失去更多的艺术家，因此急于签下一批更坚韧、更锋芒毕露的艺术家，如厄尔、莱尔·洛维特、kd lang 和瑞奇·斯卡格斯。格里菲斯是乡村音乐界中一位善于交际的人，造就了许多这样的艺术家——在年轻的莱尔·洛维特为他的大学报纸采访了她之后，她邀请他在安德森博览会的舞台上表演——但她温柔的歌曲让她显得格格不入。与她的强硬的同龄人。她经常穿着碎花麻袋连衣裙和短袜，抱着或坐在她最喜欢的书之一（拉里·麦克默特里（Larry McMurtry）的《孤独的鸽子》、尤多拉·韦尔蒂（Eudora Welty）的《三角洲婚礼》）旁边，为专辑封面摆出姿势。她以大学新生的热情将自己的专辑献给作家和艺术家，并在专辑附注中感谢卡森·麦卡勒斯和杜鲁门·卡波特。在她的不止一张专辑中，她把巨大的母鹿眼睛向上倾斜，好像她在努力不哭。在 MCA，她开始在乡村部门录音，但最终转入流行部门，五年后退出。她的唱片公司和评论界似乎都不确定该把她的音乐放在哪里。在《德克萨斯月刊》的一篇长文中，迈克尔·霍尔写道，一些乡村音乐守门人认为她是“贺卡民谣”和“假天真”。&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>; &lt;p>;格里菲斯的疏离感被证明是她艺术的一个生成主题。 1982年她和泰勒离婚后，她再也没有结婚，没有孩子，在晚年的大部分时间里，她选择独自生活。在她 1991 年同名专辑中最著名的歌曲之一“Late Night Grande Hotel”中，格里菲斯用一种近乎令人陶醉的依恋感唱出了她有目的的孤独感：&lt;/p>;&lt;blockquote >;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;也许你在想&lt;br/>;你以为你很了解我&lt;br/>;但没有人知道别人的心&lt;br/>;在这家深夜的豪华酒店里我感觉自己像嘉宝&lt;br/ >;因为独自生活是我做得最好的事情。&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/blockquote>;&lt;p>;尽管格里菲斯表现出可爱的天真，但她写的歌词表明了深刻的自我意识。在一首歌中，她唱道：“你永远不会拥抱我/我不喜欢被拥抱。”另一个人写道：“半夜电话铃声响起/我把床单拉高/如果我开灯它会停止叫声吗？ /我害怕这里的这些阴影/因为我的过去真的很可怕。”她轻松活泼的风格可以给她歌词的悲伤带来一种偷偷摸摸的力量。她最朗朗上口的歌曲《听广播》讲述的是一个女人头也不回地开车离开家庭生活的故事，配上欢快的小酒馆低音线。 “当你找不到朋友时，”她以欢快的副歌唱道，“你仍然有收音机。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;迈克尔·霍尔 (Michael Hall) 在他 1999 年的文章中指出，她的批评者引用了她的日记写作风格，“在依赖真实性的体裁中看到虚假的东西。”我看到的是一位艺术家试图记录富有想象力的女孩的内心生活。事实上，她唱的歌曲讲述了迅速发展的友谊、蓝月亮的魔力以及迷失在廉价商店的小说中，这一事实并不让我觉得虚伪，而是让我感到振奋，超前于时代。格里菲斯的歌词可以被理解为泰勒·斯威夫特日记歌曲创作的先驱。斯威夫特 2009 年首张专辑中的《I&#39;m Only Me When I&#39;m With You》中唱到了她与密友躺在星空下的情景，这首歌曲的前身是《There&#39;s a Light BeyondThese Woods》（玛丽·玛格丽特） ”，这是格里菲斯首张唱片中一首令人难以忘怀的自传体歌曲。在歌曲中，格里菲斯唱到了她儿时最好的朋友，她和他一起在奥斯汀长大，幻想着成为音乐家并离开小镇。 “我们去纽约吧，玛格丽特！”她在唱歌。 “我们会躲在地铁里/喝诗人的酒。”然后玛格丽特与丈夫和家庭安定下来，格里菲斯必须把她抛在身后：&lt;/p>;&lt;blockquote >;&lt;div >;&lt;p>;那么我们十岁时，在我们的树林之外发出的光芒又如何呢？&lt; br/>;那时你是个漫步者。&lt;br/>;我们计划的幻想，好吧，玛吉，&lt;br/>;我现在正在实现它们。&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/blockquote>;&lt;p>;Sarah Jarosz告诉我她几乎考虑选择“There&#39;s a Light BeyondThese Woods (Mary Margaret)”作为她对致敬专辑的贡献。 “这首歌让我心碎，”她说。除了她珍贵的书铭文之外，促使她选择《你不能再回家》的原因还在于它的副歌——“这个老镇从来没有真正关心过我/我不知道为什么我总是来这里在我的梦中”——这呼应了雅罗斯自己对于从德克萨斯州搬到纳什维尔，以及作为一名试图在这个行业规划自己的道路的女性的矛盾感受。 “南奇是一位艺术家的典范，她无法被描述，也无法被归类，并且可以同时成为多种事物，”她说。&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;在重新发行的套装和致敬专辑之间——其中包括格里菲斯的同龄人，例如莱尔·洛维特 (Lyle Lovett)，&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/iris-dements-new-album-is-a-sutain-political-statement&quot;>;Iris DeMent&lt;/a>; 、艾米卢·哈里斯 (Emmylou Harris) 以及民间领域的年轻艺术家，包括亚伦·李·塔斯詹 (Aaron Lee Tasjan) 和莫莉·塔特尔 (Molly Tuttle)——我们正处于格里菲斯的复兴之中。她没能活着看到这一切，但她在死前确实听到了一首致敬歌曲。 2019 年 12 月，吉姆·鲁尼 (Jim Rooney) 到她家为她播放翻唱的《Love at the Five and Dime》，这首歌曲是他制作的约翰·普林 (John Prine) 与肯塔基州冉冉升起的歌手凯尔西·沃尔登 (Kelsey Waldon) 的二重唱。当天他拜访了普莱恩，给他播放了录音。这是鲁尼最后一次见到这两位艺术家。但令他感到鼓舞的是，格里菲斯可能是个难听的听众，但她似乎很喜欢她的老歌的新演绎。他告诉我，当普莱恩和沃尔登低吟着副歌时，“跳舞离我近一点，现在跳舞近一点/今晚跳舞近一点，”格里菲斯的脸上露出了微笑。 “在我看来，凯尔西让她想起了自己，”鲁尼说，“当她年轻的时候。” ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot;

rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;我爱俄罗斯&lt;/a>; ”，贝拉·沙耶维奇 (Bela Shayevich) 和伊洛娜·亚日宾·查瓦斯 (Ilona Yazhbin Chavasse) 翻译并于本月出版的回忆录和报告文学集。后来，十几岁的时候，科斯尤琴科在学校图书馆发现了报纸。 “我对它们着迷——这些图片没有改变，你可以一边阅读一边思考，”她写道。 “我决定去一份工作。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Kostyuchenko 最梦想工作的报纸是 &lt;em>;Novaya Gazeta&lt;/em>;，其中 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker .com/magazine/2009/03/23/the-accused&quot;>;安娜·波利特科夫斯卡娅&lt;/a>;，一位无所畏惧、受人尊敬的记者，提交的快件讲述了俄罗斯车臣战争的残酷真相。科斯尤琴科描述了看到波利特科夫斯卡娅文章的感受。 “我感觉自己发烧了，”她写道。 “结果我对我的国家一无所知。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;2005 年，科斯尤琴科开始在《新报》实习，蹑手蹑脚地走进波利特科夫斯卡娅的办公室，把苹果放在她身上桌子。 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tag/vladimir-putin&quot;>;弗拉基米尔·普京&lt;/a>;是新任总统，高油价推动了消费繁荣。但科斯秋琴科对冲锋陷阵的俄罗斯更感兴趣，而不是被抛在后面的俄罗斯，一个被创伤和迷失方向所定义的地方，或者更确切地说，一个民族，但也有坚韧和决心。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;对于早期的一篇作品，科斯秋琴科在路边的一家妓院“市场”闲逛了一晚，观察性工作者和她们的顾客如何争吵、纵容、讨好、对待——以及虐待——彼此。另一方面，她在莫斯科北郊一家未完工的医院废墟中徘徊，该医院已成为不合群的青少年和其他迷失或被抛弃的人的圣地。她描述了一位这样的流浪者，他来到这里寻找神秘的邂逅，结果却在空荡荡的电梯井里被头撞了。他气呼呼地离开，宣称：“灵魂拒绝了我。”对于科斯尤琴科来说，这是一个熟悉的俄罗斯，不复杂，不富有，也不强大，但正如她的书名所暗示的那样，她热爱——而且仍然如此。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“你知道你拥有什么样的爱为了你的手，或者你的腿，”科斯图琴科最近在柏林告诉我，她去年搬到了那里。 “或者为了你的家，或者你的家人。最重要的是，这种爱与依恋感和归属感有关。”她说，人们应该对这一事实既清醒又成熟。 “你要对属于你的东西负责。”她接着说：“我和生活在这片土地上的人们有着共同的命运。是的，这种命运并不总是幸福的，但它是我们的，我们所有人的。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;在普京的俄罗斯，揭露黑幕的新闻业已成为一项困难、报酬低、吃力不讨好的职业，而且常常是彻底危险的职业。 2006 年，科斯楚琴科在《新报》任职一年多后，波利特科夫斯卡娅在莫斯科公寓楼的电梯里被枪杀。她是过去二十年来被杀害的七名《新报》记者之一。科斯秋琴科描述了她的纪念照片挂在该报的会议室，旁边还有她被谋杀的同事的照片。 “每当一幅新的肖像出现时，我们都会尝试把它挂起来，这样墙上就没有更多的空间了，”她写道。 “当你无法保护自己或你的人民时，你就会变得迷信。”但是，她知道，“总有空间再容纳一个人。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;科斯尤琴科现在三十六岁，是俄罗斯最优秀的记者之一；她带着一种柔和的、近乎空灵的气质，掩盖着一种顽固、甚至激烈的报道能量。她可以感到愤怒、羞耻、厌恶，但她并不觉得自己和她笔下的俄罗斯有什么不同。 “我是俄国人。我出生在俄罗斯，”她写道。 “我的母亲是俄罗斯人，我的亲生父亲也是俄罗斯人。 。 。 。我的姓氏是乌克兰人，是我母亲第一次婚姻时的姓氏。我们的姓氏是马利舍夫。我有蓝眼睛和白皮肤，斯拉夫特征。我把长发编成辫子。我的母语是俄语，我说俄语时没有任何口音。在我的国家我从来没有觉得自己像个外国人。我属于这里。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;科斯尤琴科告诉我，这本书是个人的清算，试图弄清楚她是如何错过——或者更确切地说，未能对俄罗斯陷入法西斯主义做出充分反应的。这一轨迹导致了对乌克兰的入侵和一场持续了近两年的战争，但实际上开始得更早。对于科斯尤琴科来说，时钟从她达到公民意识时开始：也就是说，在普京巩固权力并构建独裁制度并最终对其邻国发动战争的那些年里。&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport -monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Kostyuchenko 是一名同性恋，她在二十多岁的时候就开始参与 LGBT 活动。她写道，当时，她认为，如果她和当时的女友参加莫斯科的骄傲游行（该游行被官方禁止），随着时间的推移，他们将能够冷静而令人信服地捍卫自己的权利。相反，她的太阳穴被打了一拳，她的女朋友也被捕了。 2013年，当俄罗斯杜马通过一项法律，禁止传播所谓的“非传统性关系宣传材料”时，她站在杜马前，亲吻了女友，以示抗议。东正教活动分子向他们投掷鸡蛋和粪便。 “法律很明确，”科斯图琴科告诉我。 “我们在社会上并不平等。这显然是法西斯主义的表述。”但是，她说，“这是一个令人不快的想法，我不想完全朝那个方向看。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;2021 年，科斯尤琴科在一所国营居民住宅内住了两周。患有精神和神经系统疾病。从这段经历中得出的文章是《我爱俄罗斯》的核心杰作，这是一篇令人心碎、发自肺腑的文本，几乎像是从页面上飘过：工业清洁用品；不新鲜的稀汤；脏床单。护士们在病房里走来走去，准备用装满镇静剂的注射器给任何造成问题的人注射。到外面散步，即使只是到有围墙围起来的庭院，也会被允许或拒绝，也有类似的反复无常。科斯尤琴科与两名妇女阿丽娜和维拉的遭遇令人心痛，她们的怀孕被强行终止，然后在未经同意的情况下被绝育。 “我要怎样才能脱离这个地狱呢？”维拉问道。&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;在 3-A 病房的一扇金属门后面，这里关押着最棘手的病例，科斯尤琴科遇到了蒂玛，一个瘦弱的赤身裸体的男人，嘴唇上挂着口水，臀部因反复注射而瘀青。当科斯尤琴科和一位名叫卡蒂亚的志愿者建议带他在院子里短暂散步时，负责泰玛病例的医生表现出了困惑的怀疑态度。但是，几天后，3-A 病房的护士们惊讶地发现，Tyoma 已经不再撕扯和咀嚼窗台碎片了。 “事实证明，在俄罗斯，我们有国家出资维持的集中营，”她告诉我。 “我们的税收让人们像动物一样被关起来，被剥夺权利。”&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >; &lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;科斯尤琴科还意识到，疗养院是其墙外更大的俄罗斯的特别残忍的表现。 “你独自一人，与国家面对面，”她说，“这就是它的样子，这就是国家的真实本质。”一个家长式国家自以为知道什么对它的指控是最好的，但它真正关心的是它自己的权威和便利。如果这意味着要向屁股注射一针镇定剂，那就这样吧。你最好的机会只是避免更糟糕的命运。 “如果你想保持安全，你必须脸上挂着微笑，或者至少保持中立，”科斯图琴科写道。 “对他们对你和你周围的人所做的事情漠不关心，温顺。”事后看来，科斯尤琴科告诉我，“我知道我的国家存在法西斯主义，同时相信如果我这样做我的工作，如果我描述这种法西斯主义，那就足够了。但这永远还不够。”尽管俄罗斯独立记者的生活并不轻松或光鲜亮丽，但它也有自己的舒适感、仪式感和满足感。有人报道了旅行和在剧院的夜晚，甚至深夜与同事在某人的厨房里喝酒。 “我喜欢我的生活，不想改变它，”她说。对于科斯尤琴科和她圈子里的其他人——非营利组织创始人、实验剧院导演、书店或咖啡馆老板——来说，用她的话说，这些“水晶小世界”似乎会不断扩大。有一天，这些小世界将合二为一，普京就没有立足之地了；这个俄罗斯不会属于他。但是，她告诉我，“2 月 24 日”——俄罗斯入侵的那一天——“这些世界破碎了，它们消失了。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;第二天深夜，科斯秋琴科越境进入乌克兰，成为一个极小的国家之一。成功从战区进行报道的俄罗斯记者人数。 （也就是说，从那些受到攻击的人的角度来看，大量官方媒体的记者参与了进行攻击的俄罗斯部队。）她从当时在俄罗斯占领下的敖德萨和赫尔松进行报道。她在前线偷偷进出；在赫尔松市内，她找到了俄罗斯军队对当地居民施以酷刑的大楼。她的文章由《Novaya Gazeta》发表，其编辑德米特里·穆拉托夫 (Dmitry Muratov) 荣获&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/the-nobel-peace -prize-acknowledges-a-dangerous-era-for-journalists&quot;>;代表论文获得 2021 年诺贝尔奖&lt;/a>;；但是，鉴于俄罗斯的战时审查制度，她和她的编辑们删除了某些单词和段落，并用括号或斜体注明文本已被删除。 “我们不想隐藏这种强制审查行为，而是想把它说清楚，”她告诉我。 “Plus, in Russian, you can tell well enough what is missing.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Her dispatch from the southern city of Mykolaiv, which Russian forces shelled relentlessly in the early days of the war, appears in its original form as the book&#39;s last chapter. The writing is bracing, painful in its clinical documentation, laced with a sense of guilt and the utter futility of that guilt. Kostyuchenko visits the Mykolaiv morgue. “The bodies in the cold storage are stacked up in layers,” she writes. “Two girls lie one on top of the other. They are sisters. The older one is seventeen. All I can see in the heap of bodies is her hand, her slim, long fingers with neat pink nail polish. The younger girl is three years old and lies on top of her sister. She is blond. Her jaw has been tied shut with gauze, her hands tied together to rest on her stomach. Little red wounds from the shrapnel cover her body. The girl looks alive.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In late March, Kostyuchenko was on her way to Mariupol, then the site of the most prolonged and brutal siege of the war, when she got a call from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/q-and-a/how-russias-nobel-winning-newspaper-is-covering-ukraine&quot;>;Muratov&lt;/a>;, &lt;em>;Novaya Gazeta&#39;s&lt;/em>; editor in Moscow. He had information that pro-Kremlin Chechen militants had orders to intercept Kostyuchenko at a checkpoint and kill her. Muratov said she had to leave Ukraine immediately; at first, Kostyuchenko resisted. “An entire city was destroyed along with tens of thousands of its inhabitants,” Kostyuchenko said of Mariupol. “This is a war crime at an incredible scale, and must be documented and recorded.” But she relented, and made plans to flee Ukraine. The sudden inability to fulfill this task weighed on her more acutely than the threat against her life. “I couldn&#39;t come to terms with my own helplessness,” she wrote in an essay for Meduza, an independent Russian news site based in Riga.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Kostyuchenko never returned to Moscow. She began an enervating &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/03/13/how-russian-journalists-in-exile-are-covering-the-war-in-ukraine&quot;>;exile&lt;/a>;—Venice, Prague, a village in Switzerland, a spell in the States—along with her girlfriend, Iana, a journalist and disability-rights activist. (They met when Iana showed up at &lt;em>;Novaya Gazeta&#39;s&lt;/em>; offices after Kostyuchenko published her article on care homes.) By then, &lt;em>;Novaya Gazeta&lt;/em>; was effectively shuttered. After multiple warnings from state regulators, and fearing criminal prosecution, its employees had voted to indefinitely suspend operations. Kostyuchenko disagreed with the decision but chose not to cast a vote—she was abroad, facing her own difficulties, but not those confronted by her colleagues who were still in Russia. “I didn&#39;t bear the risks of making a different decision,” she told me. “They did. And so I&#39;m not sure my opinion mattered much.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Kostyuchenko and Iana ultimately rented an apartment in Berlin. Kostyuchenko wanted to get back to work; in particular, she hoped to return to Ukraine, but that was no easy task, given that, after the invasion, Russian citizens needed approval, rarely granted, in order to enter the country. She travelled to the Ukrainian consulate in Munich to apply for a visa. On her way back to Berlin, she fell ill. The symptoms came in waves: stomach pain, nausea, swelling of her face, fingers, and toes. For two months, doctors had little clue what might be wrong with her. Finally, one of them suggested that she may have been poisoned. “It seemed too wild an idea,” she told a police detective. “I was in Europe. I felt that I was safe.” The detective answered harshly. “You come here and think you&#39;re on vacation,” he said. “We have political murders here. Russia&#39;s secret services are active in this country.” He chastised Kostyuchenko for what he said was a reckless and lackadaisical attitude to her own safety.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;eb4rhl&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;1at8de&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;She was admitted at Charité hospital in Berlin, where &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tag/alexey-navalny&quot;>;Alexey Navalny&lt;/a>; was treated after his poisoning in 2020. The prosecutor&#39;s office closed the investigation, then reopened it, but she hasn&#39;t heard anything further. When the Insider, an independent Russian site that often covers the security services, briefed a number of doctors and chemists on Kostyuchenko&#39;s case, all said her symptoms “cannot be explained by anything other than exogenous poisoning.” They named an organochlorine compound as the likely poison, and suggested it was ingested or absorbed through the skin.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;German police told Kostyuchenko to keep an unpredictable schedule, to move regularly, and to avoid repeating her routes or destinations. She and Iana moved out of their Berlin apartment and headed to a residency program in a remote, bucolic stretch of northern Scandinavia. From there, they began shuttling between friends&#39; houses and apartments in Europe. This fall, they plan to visit the US for Kostyuchenko&#39;s book launch. She recalled one of her early scares at &lt;em>;Novaya Gazeta&lt;/em>;, when she was investigating a ring of Moscow gangsters and corrupt police officers that killed people so as to steal and then sell their expensive cars. Kostyuchenko was followed, and someone tried to break into her apartment; some of the officers showed up at the paper&#39;s offices and made threats. She told me what a sympathetic police investigator had relayed to her: “If they are set on killing you, they will kill you. You can make this process longer and more costly for them. But it is impossible to guarantee your safety.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The alleged poisoning is an awkward subject for Kostyuchenko. She tries not to dwell on the inherent danger of her work. “There are various professions that carry a potential risk to your life,” she told me. “Police, rescue services, excuse me for the example, military.” That&#39;s just the nature of the job, she said. “It turns out that, in Russia, journalism is one of them. It doesn&#39;t make it more or less important. Of course, it&#39;s unfortunate to work in these conditions, but I&#39;ve been doing it for a very long time.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The more difficult thing, Kostyuchenko told me, is being separated from Russia. As the war drags on, and Russia continues to inflict suffering on Ukrainians and repress its own citizens, she has found it harder to maintain or profess her love for her country. Kostyuchenko doesn&#39;t subscribe to the illusion that her country is somehow trapped by Putin alone. “He is a symptom, let&#39;s say, the personification of all our shit,” she told me. “But he&#39;s not the root of all troubles.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Not long ago, in one of their regular phone calls, Muratov—who remains based in Moscow—offered a metaphor that Kostyuchenko found compelling. Putin and other top Kremlin officials, he told her, present themselves like priests who purport to mediate a believer&#39;s relationship to God. That is, they act as intermediaries in how Russians feel love, or anything at all, toward their country. “The state stands between us and our love for our country,” she told me, explaining the idea, “and tells us what is right, how we should feel, what we are obligated to do.” In her work, Kostyuchenko has tried, perhaps futilely, to challenge this idea. “Love does not require silence,” she told me. “It doesn&#39;t require lying. It doesn&#39;t require murder.” Rather, she said, love is an “active feeling.” She explained, “You see Russia&#39;s many shortcomings and name them. You try to stop the evil it commits, correct what you can, mourn what you can&#39;t, and find some purpose in this sorrow.” ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;dvgxfc&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 17 Oct 2023 04:06:01 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour” is Intimate, Colossal, and Slightly Disappointing]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-front-row/taylor-swift-the-eras-tour-is-intimate-colossal-and-slightly-disappointing]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-16T20:02:30.418Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/652d4cfca2dd76a04bfbc885/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Brody-Eras-Tour.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;article >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attribute-verso-pattern=&quot;article-body&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;ArticlePageChunks&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Like most people, I know some of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tag/taylor-swift&quot;>;Taylor Swift&lt;/a>;&#39;s songs by the mere fact of being alive, but it&#39;s one thing to hear music and another to listen to it. The prime virtue of her concert film, “Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour”—shot last August, during three performances at SoFi Stadium, in Inglewood, California—is to concentrate one&#39;s attention on her music, for two and three-quarter hours, as if in a listening booth. What it reveals about her artistry only heightens my appreciation for the substance and the imagination that goes into the making—indeed, the being—of this pop superstar. The concerts are megaspectacles, simultaneously intimate and colossal; Swift commands the stadium throughout, amid large-scale stage business. She&#39;s often alone, sometimes joined by a handful of dancers, occasionally backed by a brigade of them, as huge video screens and stage sets serve as elaborate backdrops adorned by light shows and smoke effects. (As for the band, it&#39;s kept far away, in a paddock of its own.) The film of this show puts her songwriting in the foreground, as if her music were a movie script, brought to dramatic life by her performance.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;There are film directors who manage to turn big-budget studio movies into personal works, and, as I watched, I felt that Swift commandeers the mighty mechanism of celebrity in a similar way. The concept of the concert is autobiographical: Swift looks back at her career, album by album, each of which she ascribes to a different “era” in her life and each of which constitutes a segment of the show. She writes in the first person, with telling detail and candor, but also locks into a mythology of modern American young womanhood in a manner that lends narrative richness to her self-portraiture: young romance and boyfriends, friends and frenemies, school and neighborhood and family. The songs reflect a headlong desire to live the passions of the moment fully and deeply, an awareness of the barriers to this posed by the conventions of daily life, and a sense of pushing past these by sheer force of emotion toward hard-won self-knowledge. Swift is a melodramatist in the best sense, finding heroic grandeur in ordinary lives and circumstances, conceiving her experiences as a form of naturalistic legend in which her audience, of girls and young women, find their own experiences taken seriously, as they deserve to be. The “Eras” concept notwithstanding, Swift&#39;s songs are curiously detached from their times: in expanding the specifics of her life to a quasi-universality, she filters out cultural specifics, as if inviting listeners to fill in the blanks with their personal set of references.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I found myself thinking of the romantic melodramas of Douglas Sirk, such as “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/movie-of-the-week-written-on-the-wind&quot;>;Written on the Wind&lt;/a>;,” and this notion was reinforced by Swift&#39;s performance of “the last great american dynasty,” a song from her album “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/taylor-swifts-new-album-folklore&quot;>;folklore&lt;/a>;,” in which she tells the story of the late socialite and arts patron Rebekah Harkness (whose Rhode Island mansion Swift bought in 2013). While she sings the song—about a “middle-class divorcée” who marries the heir to an industrial fortune and becomes the focus of scandal—she&#39;s accompanied not just by dancers but also by an actress who portrays Harkness clad in a glamorous fifties-style gown and elbow-length gloves. This number, a sort of impressionistic refraction of a glossy classic-era Hollywood romance, is the high point of the movie&#39;s staging, though not its most inventive sequence. (There is more immediately eye-catching allure to the staging of some songs early on, in front of a huge, abstractly geometrical cutaway diorama-like house, reminiscent of Jerry Lewis&#39;s “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/dvd-of-the-week-the-ladies-man&quot;>;The Ladies Man&lt;/a>;”—and of the &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://images.app.goo.gl/xcLCZNqR4a8Lq5zr8&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://images.app.goo.gl/xcLCZNqR4a8Lq5zr8&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://images.app.goo.gl/xcLCZNqR4a8Lq5zr8&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;Hollywood Squares&lt;/a>;.)&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The tour&#39;s concept—the “eras” of Swift&#39;s career—could easily seem self-aggrandizing, but it doesn&#39;t come off this way because of a core of authentic experience that it delivers. Swift has grown up in public, and her fans&#39; fervent response to each new facet of her work corresponds to the major life changes (inner and outer) that accompany her artistic development. (Let no one who contemplates John Coltrane&#39;s or Franz Schubert&#39;s year-by-year musical self-transformations cast the first stone.) The movie shows Swift&#39;s performance to be both artful and modest; she displays prodigious talent but not intimidating virtuosity. Though her dancing is adroit, she conveys far more with her theatrical repertoire of striding, gesturing, and glancing. Her singing is strong but not operatic, expressive but not flamboyant, perched at the border of a conversational or confessional tone. In effect, it&#39;s a voice made to fit the lyrics—neither overwhelming nor underwhelming, an intensification and distillation of what&#39;s extraordinary in ordinary life.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In short, the fascination of Swift&#39;s performance is personal. That&#39;s why the movie ultimately falls short of her aesthetic. Concert movies are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/13/movies/taylor-swift-eras-tour-concert-film.html&quot;>;rarely straightforward documentaries&lt;/a>;; rather, they generally build an image track to go along with a music track, somewhat like a music video, with the celebratory and promotional aspects to the fore. But this movie (directed by Sam Wrench) hardly adds another level of experience to the performances, because its visual composition, moment to moment, is burdened by convention and complacency. This doesn&#39;t get in the way of the music, but it disregards the authenticity of Swift&#39;s presence, the physical side of her performance.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;What&#39;s missing from the film is both a sense of proximity and a sense of time. “The Eras Tour” offers very few screen-filling closeups of Swift, and they go by in a flash. Indeed, the movie is almost entirely made up of very short shots, whether Swift is singing in motion while striding across the stage or in place when accompanying herself on guitar or piano, introducing songs with spoken commentary. The decision to film and edit the movie that way comes off as no mere concession to short attention spans and impatience with stasis. Short shots, chez Wrench or Sergei Eisenstein or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tag/ridley-scott&quot;>;Ridley Scott&lt;/a>;, serve one purpose: to insure that each image says exactly one thing, to reduce complexity to an instantly graspable unity. To turn such images into a complex whole requires virtuosic editing, but the editing of “The Eras Tour” doesn&#39;t rise to the challenge, providing little variety or contrast from image to image.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The impersonality of the filming is diametrically antithetical to Swift&#39;s artistry. The movie&#39;s visual monotony—its uninspired angles, its sameness of tempo, its obstinate cutting away from action—renders the cinematic experience wearying, even as one can see that the live performances were invigorating. Among the fascinations of Swift&#39;s stage presence is its apparent lack of spontaneity—the way the band is relegated to the sidelines, except in a few theatricalized moments in which guitarists briefly jam alongside her. But I say “apparent” because I don&#39;t believe it: for all the careful rehearsal that makes the numbers come off like clockwork, Swift is very much in the moment. The movie, however, catches this fervor only in glints and flashes, as if in still frames, never in motion. A freer and more creative directorial approach—longer and more urgent closeups, say, or more patient and more curious wide shots—would reveal the spontaneity and the immediacy and humanity of Swift&#39;s performances. Such a film would mirror her combination of concentration and abandon, thought and feeling, converging in the inner life of the artist at the center of the spectacle.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Instead, the movie is shot and edited like a commercial—and it&#39;s obviously an effective one, because it provides an opportunity for a cohort of middle-aged film critics, myself included, to fawn over her work in a way that risks doing it an injustice. Like so many parents, grandparents, aunts, and uncles, movie writers may coo, “She&#39;s such a nice girl,” as if implicitly differentiating her from edgier rockers and rappers, or from more reckless celebrities. And she may well be a nice person, but her art involves much more than that, and she gives much more than that to her art. To get to the passion and the power of Taylor Swift would require a much better movie; the one she deserves would show not just how she shakes it off but how she shakes it up. ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;ud33zh&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;mrdq87&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 17 Oct 2023 04:06:01 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Bearing Witness with My Daughter at the Church of Taylor Swift]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/bearing-witness-with-my-daughter-at-the-church-of-taylor-swift]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-16T18:23:48.562Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/652d39ad1bcbeea303da6cfb/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Winter-Taylor-Swift-Eras-Movie.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;article >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attribute-verso-pattern=&quot;article-body&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;ArticlePageChunks&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;I was struggling to sort fact, fiction, and rumor when it came to the Taylor Swift–Travis Kelce relationship. But then, on Friday night, I drove a group of fourth-grade girls to a Connecticut mall to see the movie “Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour,” which earned nearly a hundred million dollars at the North America weekend box office, becoming the highest-grossing concert film of all time. By eavesdropping on the back-seat chatter of my daughter and her fellow Swifties, and later asking my kid some follow-up questions, I learned that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/sports/sporting-scene/kelce-swift-is-a-dream-pairing-for-the-nfl&quot;>;Taylor and Travis&lt;/a>;, who is a “national football player,” are “just friends for now—&lt;em>;for now&lt;/em>;,” and that, while Taylor did “get all the people talking” about a purported romance to drum up publicity for the “Eras” movie, she and Kelce are indeed going to start dating “for real” very soon. And, sure enough, the very next night, after Swift and Kelce made separate cameos on “Saturday Night Live,” paparazzi caught them leaving the after-party hand in hand.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The girls&#39; analysis of Swift-Kelce distills key aspects of the junior-Swiftie mind-set, both in its chaste wish-casting (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuNIsY6JdUw&quot;>;flash back&lt;/a>; to circa-2009 Taylor, sitting on the bleachers awaiting her shot with the football star) and in its nuanced acknowledgment that Swift, as one of my passengers said, is the “greatest businesswoman”: a savvy, even sly architect of her brand, yes, but fundamentally an honest broker. Even the greenest Swifties know, on some intuitive level, that they are being played, and they are happy to play along—not least because they have so many friends to play with.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In the late summer, I moved with my family to a new town, where we don&#39;t know anybody, and, within a couple weeks of school starting, my daughter, until then a casual listener of “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/listening-booth/in-taylor-swifts-midnights-the-easter-eggs-arent-the-point&quot;>;Midnights&lt;/a>;,” had been recruited as a militant Swiftie. It was easy to see why. I had missed the deadline to sign the kids up for soccer. We don&#39;t go to church. The house of Swift offered scripture in the form of song lyrics and vestments in the form of concert merch and friendship bracelets; it provided the social glue of communal devotion. I could only give my kid a new home; I needed Taylor Swift to help her find her people.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Inside the movie-theatre lobby—where I purchased a ten-dollar “Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour” water cup for each of the girls and a thirteen-dollar “Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour” bucket of popcorn for them to share—we joined mothers and daughters, groups of women in their twenties, young gay couples, and one elderly straight couple who wanted our little squad to know that “Taylor writes all her own music.” The scene was a Swiftian Ren Faire: we saw approximations of the cheerleader outfit from the “Shake It Off” video, the Magic Markered-up T-shirt from “You Belong with Me,” the black sequined hoodie-leotard from the Reputation tour, and a plenitude of the shimmery, sparkly floor-length gowns that exemplify Swift&#39;s Rodarte-meets-Chasing Fireflies aesthetic. The filmgoers had drawn pink glitter hearts around their eyes in honor of the “Lover” promo art and stacked friendship bracelets up to their elbows in homage to a lyric in “You&#39;re on Your Own, Kid.” One woman mixed and matched her Swifts, pairing her frilly, moss-green “folklore” dress with the fuzzy jacket from the “Lavender Haze” video and underlining the &#39;fit with a pair of “Fearless”-vintage cowgirl boots. The costume, like the concert and the movie, moved deftly back and forth in Taylor time, in a spirit of fastidious reverence.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;My colleague Amanda Petrusich has written that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/06/19/taylor-swift-eras-tour-review&quot;>;Swift&#39;s fans connect with her so passionately&lt;/a>; in part because of the star&#39;s “ &#39;you guys&#39; energy, a chatty, ersatz intimacy.” The “Eras” movie bottles this exact vibe, presenting Swift much like a single gal out for her birthday, and she&#39;s invited seventy thousand of her closest friends, and it just happens to be her turn at the karaoke mike. She does a lot of the aw-shucks-who-&lt;em>;me&lt;/em>;?! shtick that she has been plying forever, which was charming when she was a teen-ager, became grating and fake within a few years, and now scans as impeccable commitment to the bit. After “Cruel Summer,” Swift—miming incredulity that all these &lt;em>;people&lt;/em>; are here to see &lt;em>;her&lt;/em>;, like, &lt;em>;what&lt;/em>;?!?—tells her audience that they make her feel “so powerful”; toward the end of the concert, she claims to feel a little guilty that her audience has to endure just one last song (OMG sorry!). During the “evermore” set, Swift—who, in the first months of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tag/coronavirus&quot;>;&lt;em >;COVID&lt;/em>;-19&lt;/a>; lockdowns, built a home studio, wrote and recorded an entire album, and starred in and directed an elaborate music video, all under rigorous safety restrictions—describes her pandemic-era state as “a lonely millennial woman covered in cat hair, spending seven hundred hours a day watching TV.” These feints at humility are ridiculous, and, at this point in Swift&#39;s career, they are &lt;em>;spectacularly&lt;/em>; ridiculous—grand and outlandish, which is to say, befitting of a megastar.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Swift&#39;s career went through an awkward puberty in the mid-twenty-tens, when she seemed trapped in a middle school of the mind; her underdog persona began to harden into a martyr complex. (My favorite episode from this period was when Tina Fey, hosting the Golden Globes, made an extremely mild joke about Swift&#39;s serial-dating tendencies, to which Swift responded, “There&#39;s a special place in hell for women who don&#39;t help other women.”) The “Eras” movie scarcely disavows any chapters from Swift&#39;s back pages that she might regret—or that she has simply outgrown—but at times it tempers its affectionate nostalgia with the faintest carefully calibrated sheepishness, as when Swift reincarnates the BPD villainess of “Blank Space” and “Look What You Made Me Do,” or the buttercream-frosting princess of “Enchanted.” Whether she&#39;s striding down the catwalk in a cadence of confrontational glam or swirling her arms in faux-balletic glissandos, she&#39;s doing it in air quotes, and the person she is quoting is the younger Swift, whom she has not quite left behind.&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;This measure of remove, I think, also helps to illustrate Swift&#39;s extraordinary command over tweens and teens. The kids, rehearsing for the grown-up world, are trying on looks and poses and beliefs to see how they might fit, while Swift, deep into adulthood at thirty-three, is revisiting her old selves with a measure of ironic hindsight; the artist and her fans, in approaching the material at a slight distance, end up meeting in the middle and holding each other tight. The Platonic middle, at least to judge from Friday night, might be “Red”: on songs such as “22” and “We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together,” a jaded chaperone could watch her younger betters experience an ecstatic dissolving of the self into song—a pure, whooping joy.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;It may feel churlish to object to any perceived excess of enthusiasm in this context. But there was one person in the audience whose Swiftian euphoria, letter-perfect in its recall of lyrics, was almost violent in its volume, inflammatory, shattering. She happened to be sitting directly behind my daughter and her friends, and her caterwauling gained in decibels and frequency as the movie proceeded. This girl was unreal—as if the drill sergeant from “Full Metal Jacket” were a Swiftie, or a colicky newborn, or a sentient jackhammer, or a Rangers fan. I tried to distract myself from all the screaming by thinking about screamy movies. (When she screamed, “I DON&#39;T LIKE YOU!” during “Look What You Made Me Do,” I wrote in my notebook, “Shelley Duvall in &#39;The Shining.&#39; ” When she screamed, “CHAMPAGNE! PROBLEMS!” during “champagne problems,” I wrote, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7lVAuXGEOo&quot;>;&#39;I&#39;m a &lt;em>;staaarrrrrrr&lt;/em>;.&#39;&lt;/a>; ”) The girls in my charge flinched from the onslaught, then wilted; they stopped dancing and slumped into their seats. One whispered that she had been hoping Taylor Swift would make a surprise appearance at this screening, but now she was hoping against it, because the girl behind them might become terribly ill.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Eventually, my daughter and her friends fled to the front of the theatre, between the first row and the screen, where they resumed dancing and singing along with every word. A few girls followed them, then dozens more. When I noticed the colicky drill sergeant coming down to the front, too, my heart sank. But there was nothing to worry about. She had evidently picked up on her community&#39;s signals and social codes and adjusted her voltage accordingly; she was dialled into the crowd now, and she was singing, not screaming, and she knew that her people could hear her. The girls milled around during some longueurs in the “Midnights” set, exchanging names and friendship bracelets. A high schooler had brought a whole tote bag of bracelets to hand out. One group of kids and then another held hands and danced in a circle, while others turned cartwheels around them. The music flowed through them and for them; they were more engrossed by one another than by anything on the screen, and Taylor beamed down at them from on high, half-forgotten for the moment, just another chaperone. ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;rwqi1j&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;e2pet8&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 17 Oct 2023 03:06:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Jim Jordan’s Speaker Bid in Jeopardy After He Accidentally Locks Himself in Bathroom]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.newyorker.com/humor/borowitz-report/jim-jordans-speaker-bid-in-jeopardy-after-he-accidentally-locks-himself-in-bathroom]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-16T16:55:23.586Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/652d67db58a4e8bc4ae07464/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Boro-Jim-Jordan-Sad-Social.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;article >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attribute-verso-pattern=&quot;article-body&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;ArticlePageChunks&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p>;WASHINGTON (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.newyorker.com/humor/borowitz-report&quot;>;The Borowitz Report&lt;/a>;)—Rep.

A Tuinal? Gimme it immediately.” That night, the band&#39;s set list included songs called “New Age” and “Beginning to See the Light,” but no one could have mistaken their etiolated din for the sweet harmonies and sweeter optimism of the nineteen-sixties. In this grimy oubliette, sex, drugs, and rock and roll do not herald the dawn of some airy utopia; the mood is new, and dark. Breakdown. Atomization. Serious narcotics. “Live at Max&#39;s” was recorded by Brigid Berlin, a onetime receptionist for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/06/08/untangling-andy-warhol&quot;>;Andy Warhol&lt;/a>; whose father was the president of the Hearst Corporation. Her Warhol family name was Brigid Polk, granted for her habit of randomly poking people with an amphetamine-filled syringe.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;That mingling of high and low society, penthouse and pavement, was a distinguishing mark of the surrounding scene, where there was a self-conscious glorying in things sleazy. “Scum” and “punk” were terms of approbation. Values upended, à la &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/08/11/enfants-terribles&quot;>;Genet&lt;/a>;: what straight society considers irredeemably low, raised on high. People disporting themselves like minor French nobility in the Versailles of Louis XVI, against a backdrop of shooting galleries and cruising strips. In the summer of 1970, the ambisexual look and sybaritic morals of this particular underground were set to go mainstream, to be hailed as something called glam rock. And &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/sasha-frere-jones/postscript-lou-reed&quot;>;Lou Reed&lt;/a>; was its ambiguous sovereign.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;He was born in Brooklyn but brought up in Freeport, Long Island. He had one sister, Margaret Ellen, who would later become a family therapist and change her name to Merrill. His parents, Toby and Sidney, were the children of Jewish immigrants who fled Eastern European antisemitism. Sidney&#39;s original surname was Rabinowitz; he changed it to Reed after being questioned by the FBI about a union that he&#39;d done some accounting work for. Lou, according to everyone except himself, had a basically normal and happy childhood up until his teens, or thereabouts. He was bar mitzvahed. He was popular at school, fond of sports and jukebox pop, and known as something of a makeout Don Juan.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Reed&#39;s single pop hit, “Walk on the Wild Side”—No. 16 on the Billboard Hot 100, in 1973—is all about people making a pilgrim&#39;s leap into New York to claim the lives they so far carry only in their heads. “A hustle here and a hustle there / New York city is the place where . 。 .” He made his own abbreviated version of this journey in his early twenties, eventually settling in a loft at 56 Ludlow Street, where he roomed with another beady émigré, from farther away: the saturnine, classically trained Welshman &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/01/30/john-cales-inventive-retrospection&quot;>;John Cale&lt;/a>;. Cale had arrived in America the year before, to study at the Tanglewood Music Center under the composer Aaron Copland. He had his fingers in various avant-garde pies, and he introduced Reed to the left-field music of John Cage and La Monte Young, plus off-piste filmmakers such as Piero Heliczer and Jack Smith.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The Velvet Underground—Reed, Cale, the drummer Moe Tucker, and the guitarist Sterling Morrison, later supplemented with the German singer &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/books/under-review/the-misunderstood-voice-of-nico&quot;>;Nico&lt;/a>;—became the house band for a scene that coalesced around Warhol, the band&#39;s de-facto manager: a jittery montage of experimental-film archivists and conceptual artists, hustlers and dealers, professional talkers, opera obsessives. Many hangers-on were so hip that the famous artists imitated them, not the other way around.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In performance, the Velvet Underground abided by tenets then unfamiliar to rock and roll. Don&#39;t look like you&#39;re trying too hard. Don&#39;t look like you&#39;re wearing stage clothes. Don&#39;t look as if you care whether your audience goes away impressed. Reed sang about scoring drugs and sexual experimentation, and his lyrics dealt in sharp detail, not blurry generalization, a technique he picked up from some of his favorite authors: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/02/03/the-outlaw&quot;>;William S. Burroughs&lt;/a>;, John Rechy, Hubert Selby. He also imbibed the spiky vernacular of Lenny Bruce, and found a mentor of sorts in the doomed New York poet &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/personal-history/delmore-schwartz-and-the-biographers-obsession&quot;>;Delmore Schwartz&lt;/a>;. (He and Schwartz first met in a bar; Reed later signed up for Schwartz&#39;s literature classes at Syracuse. Schwartz died in 1966, at the age of fifty-two, in a hotel in Times Square.) Songs like “Heroin,” “I&#39;m Waiting for the Man,” and “Venus in Furs” were celebrated for being more “real” than rock had ever dared to be.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Warhol gifted his coterie of self-identified “superstars”—&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/the-corrosive-appeal-of-warhols-factory&quot;>;Ondine&lt;/a>;, Ultra Violet, Candy Darling—a form of open-access stardom that was slippery, frail, volatile. Satellites from a different star system, orbiting his dry, dead moon. Add serious collective drug abuse into the mix and everyone&#39;s life tended to become a ragged, 24/7 acting-out. An existential dare—cool as a matter of life and death.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;What happens when mythmaking becomes part of your daily life? The difficulty for any Lou Reed biographer—including the latest, the rock critic Will Hermes, the author of a bulky new chronicle called “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Lou-Reed-King-New-York-ebook/dp/B0BQGK1K5D&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Lou-Reed-King-New-York-ebook/dp/B0BQGK1K5D&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Lou-Reed-King-New-York-ebook/dp/B0BQGK1K5D&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;Lou Reed: The King of New York&lt;/a>;”—is that sometimes Reed embraced his persona, and took it as far as it would go, and sometimes he talked as though he were merely its pained victim. In the seventies, coverage of Reed swung between binaries, sometimes in the same article: serious artist vs. sleazy hustler, brave truthteller vs. sly put-on merchant. “I mimic me probably better than anybody,” he told Lenny Kaye, in 1975, adding, “I created Lou Reed. I have nothing even faintly in common with that guy, but I can play him well.” Keith Richards has described Mick Jagger as a “nice bunch of guys”—updating a quip that the sax player Zoot Sims once made about Stan Getz—but Jagger was a determined social gadfly with his eye on very specific prizes. It&#39;s unclear, by contrast, just how much control Reed exerted over his own game of thrones, and how happy or unhappy it ever made him.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;How to get a critical bead on someone who could go from the delicately variegated “Berlin,” in 1973, to the scabrous live set “Take No Prisoners” five years later, or release the inhuman “Metal Machine Music” and the tender “Coney Island Baby” in the same year, 1975? For obsessives, such as the music writer Lester Bangs, Reed was half prophet, half clown. Bangs devoted a series of articles to Reed, and, whatever their flaws—including some remarkably offensive remarks about Rachel Humphreys, the trans woman with whom Reed lived and worked from 1973 to 1978—they offer a feel for the man that no one else has come near. Bangs paints a portrait of speed-freak jive in excelsis: three different justifications for one course of action may be proffered in a single night, each believed in the moment it&#39;s delivered. Were Reed&#39;s addictions fuelling the spiel, or was he madly doping himself to live up to the myth? One of the reasons his fans worshipped him was precisely this: that the gap between private self and projected image dissolved like pills in a spoon.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Most of the iconic images of Reed frame a certain unvarying look: his big, blank, granite face; leather; shades. Is this someone who can&#39;t feel, or who is frightened of feeling too much? Badass stare, or narcotized indifference? He was one of those people who carry the air of a child hurt so bad he never quite recovered. Always testing the bona fides of friends, like the hipster equivalent of a polygraph. The eggshells they once walked on they now make other people tread.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Reed&#39;s relationship with his father seems to have been key. Alas, in the biography, his childhood goes by in a blur—before we know it, he&#39;s dating girls, forming groups, scoring drugs. Right on the cusp of his eighteenth birthday, he suffers a major breakdown, which his parents are persuaded to treat with electroconvulsive therapy. Hermes&#39;s handling of this episode is a bit too wary; he lets a long quote from “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Bell-Jar-Modern-Classics/dp/0060837020&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Bell-Jar-Modern-Classics/dp/0060837020&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Bell-Jar-Modern-Classics/dp/0060837020&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;The Bell Jar&lt;/a>;” do a lot of heavy lifting. Reed later claimed that the aim of the ECT was to “cure” him of being gay, but his sister, who seems like one of the more reliable witnesses here, denies this, and there&#39;s no evidence to support it. Whatever the reasoning, the treatment became a defining moment in his life. Hermes describes it as “part of Reed&#39;s mythology.” Merrill, in an &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/cuepoint/a-family-in-peril-lou-reed-s-sister-sets-the-record-straight-about-his-childhood-20e8399f84a3&quot;>;essay&lt;/a>; published in 2015, wrote, “Our family was torn apart the day they began those wretched treatments.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Song is a gift for the stifled child, somewhere he can let emotions fly free. Rock and roll was born as explosive catharsis, but it also allowed something else, something new: young men, often from modest backgrounds, conjuring beauty out of thin air, tones mingled, harmonies askew. The crucible bond of Reed and Cale echoes other male partnerships of the period, including Lennon and McCartney, Jagger and Richards, Brian Wilson and his brothers, all the different voices of the Band. Reed&#39;s first musical love was doo-wop; as a teen-ager, he recorded with a nascent group called the Shades, playing guitar and singing backup. Doo-wop groups were often Black or Latino, and frequently all-women; the genre gloried in otherwise marginalized voices, its unique aesthetic equal parts sacred and profane. It was the opposite of braggadocio, a kind of brief, spectral reverie on 45. A key lesson for Reed, the aspirant songwriter, was that the softest song in the world might easily suggest the harshest truths.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Although best known for mapping extreme human states, some of Reed&#39;s most beloved songs—“I&#39;ll Be Your Mirror,” “Pale Blue Eyes,” “Candy Says,” “Perfect Day,” “Berlin”—are about as un-rock and roll as it is possible to be. They brush against your listening mood like a rueful ghost; they feel, at times, almost like prayer. Take “Perfect Day,” from the 1972 album “Transformer.” Gentle, hovering, entrancingly ambiguous, it could be about heroin addiction or domestic contentment or spoiled dreams or something else altogether. And it is all the more devastating for being delivered in something like a crooner&#39;s lilt from another era. (The precise and celestial arrangement by the English musician Mick Ronson helps.) Reed wrote it with Bettye Kronstad, whom he&#39;d met in 1968, when she was a nineteen-year-old undergraduate at Columbia. (They married and divorced the year after “Transformer” was released.) At first, the song was called “Just a Summer&#39;s Day,” but Reed&#39;s haunting coda, “You&#39;re going to reap / Just what you sow,” turns it into something far more unnerving. Reed had a saving economy with words; he often wrote like he was sending telegrams to a new lover.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;And yet, the one time I saw him perform live, in 1979, he reduced all those magical songs to a soulless workout—slick, armored, bombastic, and so overamplified the night became a grim endurance test. It felt unpleasant, like a private exercise in contempt and control. It was as if he didn&#39;t want us to receive any pleasure from his art.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The next year, Reed released an album called “Growing Up in Public,” something he had been doing for a while, at a time when the music business had no notion of anything like a “duty of care.” Self-medication is the phrase we now use for how people react to unbearable pressures, imposed both from within and without. (Bangs died from an apparently accidental overdose of pills, in 1982.) Hermes is vague on the extent to which Reed, for all his midlife attendance at AA meetings, did finally get clean and sober; late in the book, he notes, with jarring casualness, that Reed “still drank on occasion.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Reed&#39;s private life is spangled with contradictions, but one thing is clear: he never wanted to be a father. There was no desire to recast the family life he sprang from. (“But, Papa, I know that this visit&#39;s a mistake / There&#39;s nothing here we have in common, except our name,” he sings on “Families,” one of the great underrated Reed songs, from the 1979 album “The Bells.”) That he was dead set on not being a parent might warrant some reflection, but Hermes more or less dispenses with the fact in a half-joking aside about how Reed preferred to have pets. And you get only the faintest sense from the book of why anyone would put up with Reed as a domestic partner. Glimpses of life with Lou before his late-life marriage to the artist and musician Laurie Anderson: sullen, glowering, irascible, passed-out drunk or shooting up.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Both Kronstad and Humphreys, the romantic partner who succeeded her, feel more alive on the page than Reed, who, against their discernible human qualities, remains a locked trunk. To Hermes&#39;s credit, the section on Humphreys is one of the most vivid of the book. Reed was silent about why their relationship ended, but her desire to fully transition may have been decisive. Hermes doesn&#39;t dig too deep when it comes to Reed&#39;s sexuality, which is perhaps understandable; speculation about the intimate lives of others is difficult to pull off without undue prurience. But the book&#39;s reliance on more au-courant terms, such as “gender fluid” and “nonbinary,” can feel like decals applied to an opaque surface, with none of the silt or soil of real life. Reed claimed, at one point, that he was “one hundred per cent gay,” and, in a 1978 interview, he asserted, with seemingly deliberate innuendo, that he was gay from “top to bottom.” What he didn&#39;t mention was that he was then cohabiting with Sylvia Morales, who was about to become his second wife.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Hermes describes that interview on page 304, about two thirds of the way through the book. I made a worried notation in the margin: “We&#39;re still only in 1978.” The logging of details from the sixties and seventies takes up much of the biography, and that ground has been covered in other books—some of them very good, including Mary Woronov&#39;s “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Swimming-Underground-Years-Warhol-Factory/dp/1885203217&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Swimming-Underground-Years-Warhol-Factory/dp/1885203217&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Swimming-Underground-Years-Warhol-Factory/dp/1885203217&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;Swimming Underground&lt;/a>;” and Cale&#39;s memoir “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Whats-Welsh-Zen-Autobiography-John/dp/1582340684&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Whats-Welsh-Zen-Autobiography-John/dp/1582340684&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Whats-Welsh-Zen-Autobiography-John/dp/1582340684&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;What&#39;s Welsh for Zen&lt;/a>;.” Hermes quotes liberally from these and other works, and also from many other rock writers; it&#39;s generous but can give his own writing a slightly impersonal feel. The marshalling of facts that is de rigeur in this sort of biography is perhaps redundant in the age of Wikipedia, when set lists and equipment details and capsule bios of bit players can all be found online. Hermes builds a solid thoroughfare, but mysterious hollows in the passing landscape remain unexplored.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;begr2&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;7ft469&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;In the eighties, Reed shocked some fans by appearing in an ad for Honda scooters and licensing “Walk on the Wild Side” for use in the spot. Hermes describes the commercial as “the most aesthetically effective film presentation of Reed&#39;s music to date,” and notes that the move is not all that surprising for an artist who was mentored by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2010/01/11/top-of-the-pops&quot;>;Warhol&lt;/a>;. (Reed later cut a deal with American Express, too.) Reed&#39;s music was revitalized, early in the decade, by a partnership with the guitarist Robert Quine; at the end of the decade, Reed had a huge critical and commercial success with “New York,” his most suasively personal and political work in a long time. He seemed more open to the world and other people, less caught up in the coils of his own mythos. He reunited with Cale to record “Songs for Drella,” an intimate and affecting tribute to Warhol, who had died in 1987. This unlikely détente resulted in a tentative reformation of the original Velvet Underground lineup for a series of live shows, but, as happened so often with Reed and his collaborators—including Quine—things soured, became fractious, stalled. The other band members were gracious and discreet, but enough was said to leave the impression of a faintly aristocratic Reed who was graceless and intransigent.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Then he met Laurie Anderson, at an experimental-music festival. They were together for twenty-one years, the longest relationship of his life. Hermes struggles a bit here—domestic contentment is tougher to evoke on the page than logging one more abscess from shooting speed. Its tendrils are care and compromise and mutual respect; it is built, bartered, imagined into life. It is untidy, and there are no handy buzzwords to cover its rewards.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The late redemption arc with Anderson is heartening, but you do get the impression that Reed reserved his warm and fuzzy side for fellow art-world royalty, and only let Mr. Angry out on the menials. In his work, Reed was capable of dizzying feats of empathy and tenderness; in his life, not so much. He had a hair-trigger temper and a bad reputation for being rude and offhand with serving staff. Toward the end, he becomes one of those artists who fly around the world taking cameo roles in one another&#39;s big corporate-sponsored multimedia productions. He is revered and honored in Europe; he hangs out with an adoring &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/vaclav-havels-lessons-on-how-to-create-a-parallel-polis&quot;>;Václav Havel&lt;/a>; in Prague; he and Anderson play host at their local bistro to Nicolas Sarkozy “and the chanteuse Carla Bruni.” After dinner, they all go on to a wild night of jazz with Woody Allen at Café Carlyle.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The most vivid moment of Hermes&#39;s narrative comes at the beginning of the book, and the end of Reed&#39;s life. Two days before his death, in 2013, Reed was floating in the “pale blue water of the heated swimming pool behind his East Hampton home.” Terminally weak, and held up by the burly arms of his friend Julian Schnabel, Reed&#39;s thoughts drifted to his childhood on Long Island&#39;s South Shore. He told Schnabel about a moment when the family was at the beach and Reed affectionately made to hold his father&#39;s hand; he was repaid, he said, with a smack in the face. His sister disputes the scenario, saying their father never raised a hand to anyone. But this was the image in Reed&#39;s mind, as he lay dying, of liver disease, at the age of seventy-one.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;It&#39;s possible to see Reed as someone who tried out all manner of masks and roles in his life but essentially stayed the same. Knotted inside, the not-father—a core symptom ignored or played with but never shifted. In 2011, two years before his death from liver disease, he partnered with the heavy-metal band Metallica for the album “Lulu.” It was panned by many critics, and fans remain divided on it, but, as Hermes notes, the album has one inarguably wonderful track, its nineteen-minute closer, “Junior Dad.” Brooding, serpentine, blissed-out, it returns us to Reed&#39;s early-sixties meetings with Cale and La Monte Young and their time-altering experiments with musical drone. A sea chantey about the bardo or the afterlife, a circular mantra concerning fathers and sons and aging and love—it&#39;s like a crowning testament, and it is deeply moving. Was it only here, where the word “dad” is finally pronounced, that Reed loosened up inside, breathed out, swam free? That it was all uttered, in one glorious, oceanic song?&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I met Reed once, in 1996, for a forty-five-minute press interview on the occasion of his album “Set the Twilight Reeling.” I wasn&#39;t in the best of shape myself back then—you know things are bad when Lou Reed is healthier than you are—but what I remember most are his eyes. I got the sense that he was trying to rustle up one of his trademark badass glares but that his heart wasn&#39;t in it. How does it feel, I wondered, to have to navigate not only media obligations but ordinary social encounters as if you are alone in a jungle of adversaries? When a conversation looms up before you as something staked with boundary posts, barbed wire flecked with the fleece and blood from long-ago tussles? Now, years later, rerunning the film, with all I know about childhood hurt and addiction and recovery, it occurs to me that, under the bravado, he actually looked quite scared. ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;41ndl&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 16 Oct 2023 23:06:01 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[When a Novelist Carries On What Another Novelist Started]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/10/23/a-haunting-on-the-hill-elizabeth-hand-book-review]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-16T10:00:00.000Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6525be753ecac81f96238376/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/231023_r43206.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;article >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attribute-verso-pattern=&quot;article-body&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;ArticlePageChunks&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Elizabeth Hand&#39;s “A Haunting on the Hill” (Mulholland) is, the book jacket notes, “the first novel authorized to return to the world of Shirley Jackson&#39;s &lt;em>;The Haunting of Hill House&lt;/em>;.” Authorized—by whom? Not by Jackson, who died in 1965, but by her heirs. “A Haunting on the Hill” is, therefore, a ghost story conjured by representatives of a deceased author&#39;s estate. It all sounds a little uncanny.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Isn&#39;t that the case, though, whenever we try to resurrect dead writers? In the past decade, a resurgence of acclaim has fully established Shirley Jackson as the queen of dark literary fiction, and there is no surer sign of an author&#39;s success than the arrival of a new generation of writers eager to channel her spirit, rereading and reimagining her work. So much for the death of the author. These days, it seems, fan-fiction writers start posting their rewrites the moment a book leaves the printer—sometimes over the author&#39;s vociferous objections.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Yet not a few literary classics, too, are constructed as revisions of previous ones, typically works in the public domain. Think of how Jean Rhys revised Charlotte Brontë&#39;s “Jane Eyre” in “Wide Sargasso Sea,” excavating a Caribbean backstory for that madwoman in the attic. Or how JM Coetzee broke apart “Robinson Crusoe” and rearranged the pieces to write “Foe.” Or how Peter Carey pillaged Charles Dickens to create “Jack Maggs,” with its title character based on the escaped convict who, in “Great Expectations,” turns out to be Pip&#39;s secret benefactor.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;GenericCallout&quot;>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;external-link-embed--inline&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;a aria-label=&quot;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;The Best Books We Read This Week&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.newyorker.com/best-books-2023&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/best-books-2023&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;&lt;span >;&lt;strong>;The Best Books We Read This Week&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/a>;&lt;p >;&lt;em>;Read our reviews of notable new fiction and nonfiction, updated every Wednesday.&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;a aria-label=&quot;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;The Best Books We Read This Week&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.newyorker.com/best-books-2023&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/best-books-2023&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/63c800e4e99d89b838ada996/1:1/w_200%2Cc_limit/undefined&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/63c800e4e99d89b838ada996/1:1/w_120,c_limit/undefined 120w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/a>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Historically, though, such literary incursion into another writer&#39;s territory has involved competition, rebellion, even hostility. The connection to the earlier work can be oblique and entirely tacit, and it&#39;s notable that some of the greatest novels in the form have been written by authors bound to their predecessors in a post-colonial relation. In these cases, a defiance of authority is the literary catalyst. One can hardly imagine Chinua Achebe petitioning the heirs to the copyright to “Heart of Darkness” for permission to fill in the hazy areas on Joseph Conrad&#39;s map.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;By contrast, the more docile “authorized” novel has typically been reserved for juggernaut copyright-protected characters, like Ian Fleming&#39;s James Bond or Robert Ludlum&#39;s Jason Bourne—publishing ventures that have proved so profitable for so many people that it would be absurd to let the income stream be disrupted by a minor detail like a writer&#39;s death. The result can be disconcerting. I remember, as a teen-ager, plucking a VC Andrews novel off the “New Books” shelf at the library, and realizing, a few chapters in, that something was . 。 。 &lt;em>;off&lt;/em>;. I later discovered, in what felt like a very VC Andrews twist, that Andrews had died years before, and the book I&#39;d been reading had been written by someone else (a man!). If I&#39;d squinted, I could have seen that the name “VC Andrews” on the cover bore a tiny superscripted ®, for registered trademark. In a way, we&#39;d both been betrayed: I&#39;d been tricked by a cleverly packaged counterfeit, while she&#39;d been sold out by heirs who thought she could be replaced by someone else. To love someone, after all, is to believe that the person possesses some quality that makes her unique. That simulacrum Andrews novel left me feeling as if I were a kid bereft after the death of my puppy and my parents were blandly offering to buy a replacement.&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;These days, the more sophisticated literary estates may be less likely to hire ghostwriters to imitate a deceased writer&#39;s work; instead, they authorize established writers to continue the work (and share cover credit) under their own names. The premise of a seamless transition, in which the original author slips off into the afterlife unnoticed, has been replaced by a Frankenstein-like chimera of the living and the dead. In this vein, we get Sophie Hannah writing for Agatha Christie, Sebastian Faulks writing for Ian Fleming, Brandon Sanderson chosen by the heir of Robert Jordan to continue the unfinished fantasy series “The Wheel of Time.” (On a loftier plane, Sandra Newman&#39;s “Julia,” out this month, is an authorized “feminist retelling” of George Orwell&#39;s “1984.”) Such collaborations tend to be respectful, reasonably successful, and positively reviewed, but there often is, nonetheless, something unnervingly lifeless about them. Like all the undead, the books&#39; resurrected protagonists are free to perform only a few limited actions, shadowy repetitions of actions they took in life—solving mysteries, spying on behalf of England, channelling the One Power. It&#39;s hard to read them without imagining those unseen authorities peering over the writer&#39;s shoulder and wondering about the limits of their good will.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;The shiver that arises when creativity is touched by the cold finger of authority has nothing to do with the individuals involved. As a screenwriter working on an adaptation of a Shirley Jackson novel, I&#39;ve had some contact with the folks from the Jackson estate, and (I swear) they&#39;ve been great. But the creation of official sequels and spinoffs is inevitably haunted by questions of agency, power, and control. To join Elizabeth Hand on her journey to Hill House is to be reminded of the slippery dominance of genius, the way it both establishes and breaks its own rules, tempting then trapping those who dare to follow them. Faithfully adhering to the rules doesn&#39;t guarantee success, yet breaking them will inevitably invite accusations of failure and betrayal. Each reader who arrives at “A Haunting on the Hill” hoping to return to the original Hill House will feel disappointed in her own way, although the shape of her disappointment will speak more to the nature of her loyalty to Jackson than to the qualities of the new book. Perhaps unsurprisingly, “A Haunting on the Hill” is least successful when Hand directly imitates Jackson, most successful when she draws on her own talents—and becomes truly fascinating when Hand lets those anxious whispers about authority and influence take over the tale.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The premise of Jackson&#39;s “The Haunting of Hill House” is that four strangers come together in order to conduct a paranormal investigation of Hill House, which has a reputation for being haunted. The premise of Hand&#39;s “A Haunting on the Hill” is that four friends come together to rent Hill House in order to spend some time workshopping a play. The house is, unequivocally, the same one, as is clear from its name, its location (the town of Hillsdale), and its layout. That Hand can be so explicit about this is one of the privileges of full authorization—she doesn&#39;t need to waste any time filing off the serial numbers. The chronology, too, is the same. There are passing references to the events of “The Haunting of Hill House”: “The woman whose husband built the place was killed when her carriage ran into a tree. That was in 1880. Then another woman was killed about sixty years ago when her car ran into the same tree. Same thing happened again with another woman in the eighties. They finally cut the tree down.” The middle woman is Eleanor Vance, the protagonist of “The Haunting of Hill House”; by dispensing with her so swiftly, Hand establishes that the house is the real star of the show. But there is a palpable discomfort there, too, in how those events are waved away, sandwiched between two other deaths and then dismissed with a joke. “That doesn&#39;t sound haunted . 。 。 sounds like bad driveway design,” remarks the narrator, a fortysomething playwright named Holly Sherwin, who&#39;s hoping to revive her flatlined career with a spooky play titled “Witching Night.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;In Jackson&#39;s novel, Hill House is associated with so many deaths and disturbing occurrences that the only reason to spend the night there is that you seek to encounter a ghost. By the time Holly and her friends show up, decades later, the body count has only risen, which is why it&#39;s the perfect place to develop “Witching Night.” But then we run into that horror-movie dynamic wherein the people on the screen are oblivious of what&#39;s screamingly apparent to the people in the audience. Over and over, the characters encounter unambiguous horrors, and somehow dismiss them. “Haunted?” one character says. “No one has ever seen a ghost here, if that&#39;s what you mean.” Later, she says, “People project their own explanations onto it.

The strange flatness of the characters in these moments arises from the fact that they&#39;re operating in a world where the rules have been set by the departed. Characters can ask &lt;em>;whether&lt;/em>; they should go to Hill House and &lt;em>;why&lt;/em>; they should stay at Hill House and &lt;em>;how&lt;/em>; Hill House works the way it does, but it&#39;s an exercise in futility when they do. Those questions can&#39;t be answered within the novel, because the answer lies outside it, in the requirements of an authorized effort to haunt “The Haunting of Hill House.” Only when the characters take a break from those imponderables can they be free to act within Hand&#39;s imagination—and only then does the book come to life.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Hand has a gift for the sensuous, evocative detail, and her descriptions are often simultaneously seductive and spooky: small, wealthy upstate towns are populated by “people who distilled rare liqueurs from echinacea and comfrey, or made syrup out of white pine needles, or wove intricate rings and brooches from your own hair,” while a character with a flair for the gothic enjoys “psychotropic herbs, Victorian toy theaters, obscure Eastern European horror films, and social media accounts belonging to dead Hollywood starlets.” Hand deploys this descriptive talent to especially strong effect when she evokes Nisa, Holly Sherwin&#39;s girlfriend. Nisa is an actress and a singer; she&#39;s also crafty and duplicitous, eager not just to contribute to the workshopping of Holly&#39;s play but to claw credit away from Holly whenever she can. All the participants in the workshop are prone to moments of sharp-elbowed competition and jealousy, but Nisa in particular is a self-centered nightmare, a crisply drawn near-parody of a theatre kid, given to bursting into song whenever she is not the center of attention. Hungry for success, she continually subjects Holly to the pitiless assessments of the untried young.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Nisa&#39;s casual disregard for boundaries, and her slick contempt for anyone with the temerity to age or fail, make her a genuinely unsettling presence in the house. Shortly after the group arrives at Hill House, Nisa goes rummaging through the belongings of an older actress, appraising her wardrobe, sniffing her perfume, and putting on her lipstick. “Older women shouldn&#39;t wear dark lipstick, anyway,” she thinks, smiling at herself in the mirror and closing the tube. Later, the actress returns to her room and discovers that, mysteriously, the top of the lipstick has been bitten off: “She could clearly see the imprints of tiny teeth—a rat? A mouse? Too small for a person for sure, and who would bite off a lipstick? A child, maybe, but there were no children here.” That rat-like nibbling perfectly encapsulates Nisa&#39;s tiny, needling violations of those around her. The competition between older and younger women, and the high stakes of the battle for control of one&#39;s artistic territory, is a recurring theme in the book. Every time it arises, the story takes on a pleasurable metafictional richness. Hand brilliantly captures the discomfort of someone&#39;s being at once too close and too cruel to a vulnerable artistic project, the sense of violation that arises when someone moves too boldly into your creative space. One can almost hear Hand channelling Jackson&#39;s ghostly whisper, as the young woman blithely appropriates what belongs to the older woman: &lt;em>;What are you doing here&lt;/em>;? &lt;em>;Get out&lt;/em>;.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The authorized novel is far from the only way we try to resurrect the literary dead; adaptations for film and television surely count, too. (Mea culpa.) “The Haunting of Hill House” has been haunted before; five years ago, Netflix aired a very free adaptation of the novel in ten episodes, and previous decades saw two feature-film versions. Still, the stakes are different when a novel inhabits the world of another novel, while aiming to be a wholly freestanding work. That the new novel is tethered to an already cherished one is part of the appeal, and part of the problem. The tether can be a tourniquet.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;This theme takes center stage in the most frightening set piece in Hand&#39;s novel, the answer to the mystery of why Holly&#39;s playwriting career stalled. (All Hand&#39;s characters, it must be said, are burdened with backstory—part of the contortions required to keep them at Hill House.) The story is brief, bizarre, and electric, and almost seems torn from a different book. Jackson&#39;s particular skill was to suggest that, whatever she chose to depict, far darker horrors were lurking beyond the margins of the page. But Hand enjoys showing the monster, and this is the one section where she truly sets herself free.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;As a promising young playwright, we learn, Holly once spent the night with a woman named Macy-Lee, who, drunk, told her a story about sleeping with a ghost: “A real good-looking one . 。 。 real smooth skin, like a polished rock.” Nine months later, she gave birth to a ghost baby: “This slimy gray thing, cold as ice, but . 。 。 pulsing. 。 。 。 all these tiny wriggly fingers were wrapped around a kind of face. Only it had no eyes or nose—it was just a jelly blob with a mouth, and this ropy string attached.” With evident relish, Hand recounts the gruesome details of Macy-Lee&#39;s offspring, as it bites through its own umbilical cord, then slithers off into the woods. The scene itself is a kind of monstrous offspring; unlike the bulk of this mostly well-behaved book, it resembles nothing Jackson would ever have dreamed of writing.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;pgj3tm&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;ah9ff5&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Holly saw Macy-Lee&#39;s story for the brilliant monologue it is. She incorporated it into her play, and achieved overnight success—only for Macy-Lee to return, furious and vengeful, accusing her of exploitation and theft. The resulting scandal derailed Holly&#39;s career: “My long creative silence had been fueled by fear, that I wouldn&#39;t be able to write something as good as that one play—and also a subdued grief. For Macy-Lee, and also for myself, the young artist who&#39;d been so vulnerable, poised for a flight that never came.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;There is a bleakly compassionate acknowledgment here that no matter how much we may crave permission to cross the boundary into someone else&#39;s story, or reassurance that we can retain control over our own, the landscape of writing remains treacherous. Its rules are inchoate. Perfect obedience is impossible, but violation nonetheless results in pain and punishment. In that sense, no novel is ever truly authorized—the control of a story slips from every writer&#39;s hands, if only when her grip is loosened by death. Now that Hill House has joined the canon, some will enter with permission, while others will sneak in uninvited—but writers will always wander in and out of one another&#39;s stories, peering in the mirror, and running their fingers through the accumulated dust. ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;6fd0r6&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 16 Oct 2023 19:06:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“Arts &amp; Sciences,” by Traci Brimhall]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/10/23/arts-and-sciences-traci-brimhall-poem]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-16T10:00:00.000Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5d484da6e96fd10008359362/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/hp-poetryspots6.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;article >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attribute-verso-pattern=&quot;article-body&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;ArticlePageChunks&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;figure data-testid=&quot;IframeEmbed&quot; >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;IframeEmbedContainer&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;iframe height=&quot;60&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; sandbox=&quot;allow-scripts allow-same-origin&quot; title=&quot;Embedded Frame&quot; data-src=&quot;https://www.wnyc.org/widgets/ondemand_player/thenewyorker/#file=https://downloads.newyorker.com/mp3/231023_brimhall_audio.mp3&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay *; encrypted-media *; clipboard-write; autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture&quot;>;&lt;/iframe>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;p>;Read by the author.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;p >; &lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;What if this time I don&#39;t begin with a requiem&lt;br/>;or a memento mori with a split pomegranate&lt;br/>;and a harem of flies?

What if this time&lt;br/>;I think of Darwin, who saw a rare orchid&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;with a nectary a foot long and exclaimed&lt;br/>;&lt;em>;Good Heavens what insect can suck it&lt;/em>;. But he knew&lt;br/>;that anatomy could not exist unless a moth&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;evolved a tongue alongside it, some unknown&lt;br/>;species with a proboscis long enough to complete&lt;br/>;this union. No one believed because no one&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;had seen it. Victorian women used belladonna&lt;br/>;drops to widen their pupils—that Latin word&lt;br/>;for little doll—and make their gaze a black mirror&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;so lovers could see themselves. You push me&lt;br/>;back to study it, the best distance for beholding.&lt;br/>;Always you lament, torn by this choice of look&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;or touch, but it&#39;s time, you say, and close your eyes.&lt;br/>;I admit it&#39;s easy to spot a forgery with an X-ray—&lt;br/>;brushstrokes too quick, rendering too clean,&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;the first draft the final one. Behind a masterpiece—&lt;br/>;lavender swapped for gray, a lamb under the unicorn,&lt;br/>;a hundred mistakes proving how difficult it is to&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;become something. You joke I&#39;m the Isaac Newton&lt;br/>;of feelings. I can predict failure&#39;s orbital speed,&lt;br/>;can calculate the chess of silence and confession,&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;or even the path vines will take to injure the brick.&lt;br/>;It&#39;s a gift from my last love, who made a study&lt;br/>;of his wounds, made me balletic, a cat burglar&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;in a house of eggshells. But what if this time&lt;br/>;I can&#39;t see it all coming—not the coup dressed&lt;br/>;in Fahrenheit, not you dressed as Aphrodite,&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;not how I could ever trust your marble hands&lt;br/>;cooling the twin crescents of sweat beneath&lt;br/>;my breasts, marvelling at this wealth of apples.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;em>;This is drawn from “Love Prodigal.”&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;jfe4a8&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;swz8mi&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 16 Oct 2023 19:06:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Han Ong on Fathers, Sons, and Sad Sacks]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.newyorker.com/books/this-week-in-fiction/han-ong-10-23-23]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-16T10:00:00.000Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/63b5fc749a1485c25e919f77/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/TWIF_Ong.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;article >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attribute-verso-pattern=&quot;article-body&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;ArticlePageChunks&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;In your story “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/10/23/i-am-pizza-rat-fiction-han-ong&quot;>;I Am Pizza Rat&lt;/a>;,” a man in his early fifties, who is struggling to succeed as a writer in New York, goes home to California to help care for his widowed father after a fall. When you started writing the story, did you have just this premise in mind or did you already know where the story would go?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I took the basic outline of “I Am Pizza Rat” from an unproduced play of mine called “Great Lives,” written in 2016. In the play—which takes its title from the BBC podcast, which is also name-checked in the story—a middle-aged, failed writer moves home to the West Coast from New York City to take care of an ailing father. The father has dementia or Alzheimer&#39;s—it&#39;s not yet clear which; at any rate, it&#39;s his mind that&#39;s failing.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;That outline got me started. Almost all of the elements that followed—the Falling Naturally class, “The Mikado,” the Cameroonian nurse Bun, the son&#39;s pot smoking—were discoveries I made in the process of writing the story.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I should say that “I Am Pizza Rat” is an iteration of a kind of story that I wrote a lot when I was younger, but which I haven&#39;t attempted in many years: a tale of sad sacks. Like the characters of Barbara Pym (one of my two favorite novelists), these are people who are in retrenchment from the Great Flow of Life, and now stand to the side and simply make observations about Life&#39;s Major Characters. The narrator in “I Am Pizza Rat” has an “awakening” late in the story, when his writing ambitions are revived, but till then he&#39;s a pot smoker and a piddler-about.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;The father and the son have a somewhat difficult history together, and they each seem to have ambivalent feelings about the other. And yet the father asked the son to come—and is even paying him to be there, and paying his rent back in New York. Why? Was he hoping to improve their relationship? Was he trying to help his son without seeming to?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The father-son relationship in the story is probably a case of “who you&#39;re stuck with” or “the only person who will have you.” That said, it&#39;s interesting for me to discover, as a writer, that so much emotion and depth of feeling can be mined from what are essentially the becalmed energies of a story of rapprochement. When I teach, especially playwriting, I don&#39;t always resist peddling that hoariest of clichés: that a plot requires “conflict.” Though I do a soft-shoe around it by using other terms for what is essentially the same thing: “stress,” “heat,” “the color red,” “a heartbeat.” Still, it&#39;s useful to encourage beginning writers to avoid hemming and hawing, and to get—another hoary cliché—“right to the action.” In light of this, it&#39;s an unexpected pleasure to find that, as a writer, I can move the story many years past the “heat” and “the color red” of a tumultuous father-son relationship and still have vital elements to dramatize.&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;The story has a somewhat grim setup, but is full of humor—a shared humor between son and father (especially when it comes to Gilbert and Sullivan!). They don&#39;t speak a lot, but they communicate. How tough is it to convey the unspoken emotional subcurrents when writing a story like this?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;For me, not very tough. Gruff fathers and recalcitrant sons, grumpy old men and damaged young men: these are recurring characters for me. Even when I was a twentysomething, I was writing about grumpy old men. There are bedraggled, embittered fathers in two early plays of mine: one who deserts his family and is discovered, years later, having hanged himself in a flophouse, in “The Chang Fragments”; and an old Filipino who is traced by his abandoned son to a home for aged Jews, in “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Version-3-0-Contemporary-Asian-American/dp/1559363630&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Version-3-0-Contemporary-Asian-American/dp/1559363630&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Version-3-0-Contemporary-Asian-American/dp/1559363630&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;Swoony Planet&lt;/a>;.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;A note about “The Mikado”: it&#39;s my favorite Gilbert and Sullivan, as it is for the father in the story. For some time, I&#39;d held on to this idea—an Asian-American father and son who unrepentantly love the racially problematic operetta—as the main plot of a short story, but I lacked a second idea against which it would spark; I worried, also, that the subject was too on the nose. But as one small thread in a story, as it is in “I Am Pizza Rat,” I think it works.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;As for the humor, I credit it partly to a &lt;em>;Times&lt;/em>; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/02/world/europe/netherlands-falling-elderly.html&quot;>;article&lt;/a>; about Dutch seniors who are learning the “correct” way to fall, which was the inspiration for the Falling Naturally class in “I Am Pizza Rat.” Because that part of the world ably handles such issues as health care and senior care, the tone of the article was somewhat buoyant, though the subject matter was not. And the seniors profiled in the story were full of good cheer: this was instructive.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;This is the second story you&#39;ve published in the magazine that involves someone taking care of a stubborn, ailing older man. (In the other story, “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/09/13/the-monkey-who-speaks&quot;>;The Monkey Who Speaks&lt;/a>;,” it was a professional home health aide.) What draws you to this situation?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Not long ago, I worked as the assistant to a retired professor, a woman. I accompanied her to various doctors&#39; visits, and, though the term “patient advocate” was never used to describe my duties, I believed I was that for her. I asked the doctors questions about her medications, questions that she sometimes forgot to ask. I wrote notes summarizing what they said so that she could refer to them.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;This experience moved me more than I thought it would.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;Throughout the story, there&#39;s a motif of falling: falling has been the main sign of the father&#39;s failing health; his son takes him to a class on how to fall without hurting himself. Should we read something more metaphorical into that?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;On the one hand, per Samuel Beckett: “No symbols where none intended.” But, on the other, who am I to say, really? Knock yourselves out.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;Why is New York&#39;s infamous &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPXUG8q4jKU&quot;>;Pizza Rat&lt;/a>; in this story? How did a rat pulling a slice of pizza down some subway steps become the title figure in this narrative?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I love Pizza Rat. I &lt;em>;am&lt;/em>; Pizza Rat. There were a few years in the not-too-distant past when I was feeding myself entirely with leftovers from mixers at a university where I was an adjunct and a temp. I would go in with Ziploc bags after these events and shove any food that was available into them. Interestingly enough, a lot of these food items were slices of pizza. But that&#39;s not why I am Pizza Rat. Sometimes inhabiting a character helps me to feel the shamelessness necessary to pull off undesirable tasks. So my mantra on those food-hoarding days was: I am Pizza Rat, I am Pizza Rat. I would recite the line on a loop in my head. And, lo and behold—I didn&#39;t care who saw me walk away with bags of food, because would Pizza Rat care? And when it came time for an analogue and an avatar for the narrator in the story—who has the same underemployed, underpaid life that I did then—who should suggest himself but my old friend Pizza Rat? ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;9ihn98&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;xvmsa9&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 16 Oct 2023 19:06:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Can Happiness Be Taught?]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/10/23/build-the-life-you-want-the-art-and-science-of-getting-happier-oprah-winfrey-and-arthur-c-brooks-book-review]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-16T10:00:00.000Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65270976c259c2065944ab9e/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/231023_r43200web.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;article >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attribute-verso-pattern=&quot;article-body&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;ArticlePageChunks&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;figure data-testid=&quot;IframeEmbed&quot; >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;IframeEmbedContainer&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;iframe height=&quot;90&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; sandbox=&quot;allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups&quot; title=&quot;Embedded Frame&quot; data-src=&quot;https://audm.herokuapp.com/player-embed?pub=newyorker&amp;amp;articleID=652568ddb4c72cac9903c932&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay *; encrypted-media *; clipboard-write; autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture&quot;>;&lt;/iframe>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;p >;Staring into the mirror, on a Tuesday morning, you decide that your self needs all the help it can get. But where to turn? You were reading James Clear&#39;s “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Atomic-Habits-Proven-Build-Break/dp/0735211299/&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Atomic-Habits-Proven-Build-Break/dp/0735211299/&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Atomic-Habits-Proven-Build-Break/dp/0735211299/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;Atomic Habits: An Easy &amp;amp; Proven Way to Build Good Habits &amp;amp; Break Bad Ones&lt;/a>;” and doing well until you spilled half a bottle of Knob Creek over the last sixty pages. Now you&#39;ll never know how it ends. You tried listening to David Goggins&#39;s “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Cant-Hurt-Me-Master-Your/dp/1544512287&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Cant-Hurt-Me-Master-Your/dp/1544512287&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Cant-Hurt-Me-Master-Your/dp/1544512287&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;Can&#39;t Hurt Me: Master Your Mind and Defy the Odds&lt;/a>;,” on Audible, in your car, but so thrilling was Goggins&#39;s prose style that you stomped on the gas and rear-ended a Tesla. Do not despair, though. Succor is at hand. Roosting on Amazon&#39;s best-seller list is “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Build-Life-You-Want-Science/dp/0593545400&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Build-Life-You-Want-Science/dp/0593545400&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Build-Life-You-Want-Science/dp/0593545400&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;Build the Life You Want: The Art and Science of Getting Happier&lt;/a>;,” by Arthur C. Brooks and Oprah Winfrey (Portfolio).&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;At this point, your conscience rebels. By buying a book on Amazon, you tell yourself, you will be directly funding a new angora lining for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tag/jeff-bezos&quot;>;Jeff Bezos&lt;/a>;&#39;s monogrammed slippers in the master bedroom of his private yacht—not the main one but the backup vessel currently moored off Patmos. Quivering with righteousness, you close your laptop and stride to your nearest bookstore, only to bump into a dilemma: whereabouts in the store, exactly, can “Build the Life You Want” be found?&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;It is not an easy volume to place. You&#39;d assume that it belongs on the self-help table. Yet the title suggests home improvement or even civil engineering, and so ardently does Brooks insist on the “four big happiness pillars”—family, friendship, work, and faith—that readers of a nervous disposition may choose to wear a hard hat. On the other hand, Brooks is a professor of management practice at Harvard Business School, so he would slot into the business section with ease. Given that, as he says, “the macronutrients of happiness are enjoyment, satisfaction, and purpose,” there&#39;s an equally strong case for the cookery shelf. Or how about philosophy? Anyone who cites Marcus Aurelius, Thomas Aquinas, Kant, Mick Jagger, Epicurus, &lt;em>;and&lt;/em>; Epictetus, as Brooks does, would be totally stoked to hang out in such lofty company. No one, of course, is loftier than his co-author, and, if your bookstore is furnished with an Oprah wing, that is where the book must be displayed.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;GenericCallout&quot;>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;external-link-embed--inline&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;a aria-label=&quot;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;The Best Books We Read This Week&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.newyorker.com/best-books-2023&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/best-books-2023&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;&lt;span >;&lt;strong>;The Best Books We Read This Week&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/a>;&lt;p >;&lt;em>;Read our reviews of notable new fiction and nonfiction, updated every Wednesday.&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;a aria-label=&quot;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;The Best Books We Read This Week&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.newyorker.com/best-books-2023&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/best-books-2023&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/63c800e4e99d89b838ada996/1:1/w_200%2Cc_limit/undefined&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/63c800e4e99d89b838ada996/1:1/w_120,c_limit/undefined 120w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/a>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;When two writers join forces, it can be tricky to sort out who did what. Not in this case. Brooks is the principal player, and Oprah is his guest star. Only four times does she enter the action to offer “A Note from Oprah,” and the four notes, added together, take up less than fourteen pages in a book that is more than two hundred and forty pages long. What does she bring, then, apart from the humongous commercial clout of her blessing? Well, she reveals that “The Oprah Winfrey Show” was “always at heart a classroom. I was curious about so many things, from the intricacies of the digestive system to the meaning of life.” (Had she been French, of course, those two items would have been the same.) Near the start of the book, ever alert to her audience, she scrunches what she considers Brooks&#39;s most valuable lesson into “words you should tape to your refrigerator,” and, for extra clarity, accelerates into italics: “&lt;em>;Your emotions are only signals. And you get to decide how you&#39;ll respond to them&lt;/em>;.” One more scrunch, and Oprah has the mantra she wants: “&lt;em>;Feel the feel, then take the wheel&lt;/em>;.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;What&#39;s interesting about this advice is that far behind it, dimly discernible, is another speeding vehicle, fuelled by allegorical intent: the chariot drawn by a pair of winged horses and deployed by Socrates, in Plato&#39;s Phaedrus, to illustrate the motions of the soul. One horse, representing our nobler instincts, is “upright in frame and well jointed,” whereas the other is a hell of a nag, “a crooked great jumble of limbs,” forever dragging us down toward the lower desires. All in all, chariot-driving is what Socrates calls “a painfully difficult business,” as is being alive, and the task that Brooks and Oprah set for themselves, in their affable and optimistic fashion, is the age-old one of turning us into better charioteers. Our feelings urge us this way and that, and we should learn when to yank on the reins and when—steady now—to try a touch of the whip.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Whether Brooks has an actual chariot, Massachusetts traffic laws being what they are, I cannot say. Heaven knows what Oprah keeps in her stables. But it&#39;s charming to note the confidence with which Brooks, for one, presents his credentials as a successful whipster. He experimented on his own routines and began teaching a class on happiness at Harvard, not to mention composing a regular column for &lt;em>;The&lt;/em>; &lt;em>;Atlantic&lt;/em>; on the same topic. By his account, “I saw more and more progress in my life.” Onward and upward he flew:&lt;/p>;&lt;blockquote >;&lt;div >;&lt;p>;In the years since I made this life change, my own well-being has risen &lt;em>;a lot&lt;/em>;. People notice and remark that I smile more, and I look like I&#39;m having more fun in my work. My relationships are better than they were.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/blockquote>;&lt;p >;We&#39;re so happy that you&#39;re happy, Professor! Far be it from me to point out that such protestations of improvement, sincere as they are, have a whiff of the travelling salesman—you know, the guy who puts a foot in the door and says, “Believe me, Ma&#39;am, I&#39;ve been using this very same vacuum cleaner in my own home for three months now, and the effect of that heightened suck power is just tremendous. My dust has all but vanished. My carpets look brand new.” To anyone browsing “Build the Life You Want” and books of a similar ilk, it soon becomes clear that the care and maintenance of the self is no longer a branch of the social sciences, if it ever was, or an offshoot of popular psychology. Restructuring your inward being, and increasing its turnover, is now akin to running a company. Personhood, like religion and politics, is a business.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;It doesn&#39;t take long for Brooks to get the business going. He proudly inducts us into the thrill of the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule, or &lt;em >;PANAS&lt;/em>;, which gauges “your natural happy-unhappy mix.” This gives us a list of twenty emotions, such as “6. Guilty 7. Scared 8. Hostile 9. Enthusiastic.” (A perfect guide, as it happens, to the average day of a movie critic.) You note down how keenly you feel the feel, as Oprah would say, grading each emotion for intensity, then calculate your final score. This, in turn, shows where you belong on a pretty diagram, reproduced on page 16 of “Build the Life You Want,” that divides &lt;em>;Homo sapiens&lt;/em>; cleanly into four basic types: Cheerleader, Mad Scientist, Judge, and Poet. Really? Imagine asking J. Robert Oppenheimer to nominate which one of those he thought he was. He would have exploded.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;You&#39;ve got to love the &lt;em >;PANAS&lt;/em>; test. It means almost nothing, yet it gives you the bracing impression that you&#39;re down on the factory floor, tinkering away on the unique machine that is you. It is, to use Oprah&#39;s splendidly honest term, “science-y,” right down to the vague, if benign, laboratory conditions that Brooks dictates. “To take the test, find a time when you feel relatively neutral about life—say, right after lunch,” he writes. But what sort of lunch? If it&#39;s three o&#39;clock in the afternoon and you&#39;re lingering over coffee and gazing out across the Bay of Naples, you will give thanks for the wonders of creation. Conversely, if you just blew seven dollars and twenty-nine cents on a Subway footlong, you will hold your fellow-humans in contempt and assume, naturally, that the world is an overcooked meatball hung in a meaningless void.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Undaunted, Brooks forges onward, and makes further encouraging claims about his methods. Eager to prove that even negative feelings, if shrewdly handled, can have a positive outcome, he ventures into the realms of the book-y. He even gets arts-y on our ass. Quoting a line from Keats&#39;s letters—“Do you not see how necessary a World of Pains and troubles is to school an Intelligence and make it a soul?”—Brooks adds, “Scientists have found that Keats was right.” If only all literary criticism could be as brisk as that. Moreover, according to a study cited by Brooks, “The research found that among great composers like Beethoven, a 37 percent increase in sadness led to, on average, one extra major composition.” That sentence makes me twenty-four per cent less sad, and eighty-one per cent more inclined to giggle, than anything I have read this year.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Brooks is scarcely the first to propose that our happiness, and its opposite, can and should be quantified as precisely as barometric pressure. In “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Principles-Legislation-Philosophical-Classics/dp/0486454525&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Principles-Legislation-Philosophical-Classics/dp/0486454525&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Principles-Legislation-Philosophical-Classics/dp/0486454525&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;An Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation&lt;/a>;” (published, by a murky coincidence, in the year of the French Revolution), the philosopher Jeremy Bentham, clinging fast to his utilitarian creed, devised what came to be known as the felicific calculus. In theory, this allowed you to evaluate any given act in terms of its ensuing pain or pleasure, which could be graded according to various criteria: intensity, duration, certainty, propinquity, fecundity, purity, and extent. In practice, the last of these—which sounds tame, and which refers to the number of people who will be affected by the act—is probably the most morally ticklish, as any secondhand smoker can confirm.&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot;

worth of medical probing behind him, Brooks can boldly go where Bentham was unable to go before and lead us to the particular neighborhoods where pain and pleasure hang out. “Build the Life You Want” plays peekaboo with the reader, affording sneaky little glimpses of the hypothalamus, the insula, and the adrenal glands. Are we genuinely expected to master this material, though, or is it designed purely to reassure us that we are in safe hands? When Brooks, analyzing our reaction to fear, writes, “Your periaqueductal gray, which also receives a note from your amygdala, tells your body to move,” the prosaic image of the note—plucked from our everyday lives—is what sticks and stays. To be told that our internal mail system is like that of a well-run office comes as quite a relief. Then, there is metacognition, a buzzword that hums throughout the book and entails “experiencing your emotions consciously” and “refusing to be controlled by them.” Brooks expounds:&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;hpf0m&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;ojp3gd&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;blockquote >;&lt;div >;&lt;p>;You might compare it to the process of taking petroleum from the well (your limbic system) to a gas refinery (the prefrontal cortex), where it can be made into something you can use purposively.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/blockquote>;&lt;p >;It&#39;s not the greenest analogy I&#39;ve ever seen, but, hey, it does the job. Such is the tactic by which Brooks and the other sovereigns of self-help, with considerable skill and a pinch of cunning, advance their cause. They borrow difficult concepts from the realms of neurology and behavioral science, among others, and couch them in a patois that we recognize. Few of us may have read a paper from a 2013 issue of &lt;em>;Depression and Anxiety&lt;/em>;—think &lt;em>;The World of Interiors&lt;/em>; without the cashmere throws—titled “Reports of Drinking to Self-Medicate Anxiety Symptoms: Longitudinal Assessment for Subgroups of Individuals with Alcohol Dependence.” But Brooks &lt;em>;has&lt;/em>; read it, and has filtered its findings into his thoughts on addiction. (The paper, I couldn&#39;t help noticing, had eleven authors. I trust that they ganged up and got pie-eyed on Zombies to celebrate publication.)&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Homework, though, is not the nub of Brooks&#39;s enterprise. The nub is that he&#39;s required, by the panic-stricken temper of the times, to insist that we can and must get better at being who we are. It could be argued that so positive an outlook is, and always has been, a by-product of any inquiry into the conduct of our earthly existence, although a self-help book by Schopenhauer would, perhaps, flummox more readers than it would assist. On the other hand, if anything yokes together the philosophers cited by Brooks, it is the willingness, or the unavoidable compulsion, to worry away at one moral conundrum after the next, like dogs unearthing a bone to have another go at the marrow. You could spend a lifetime, say, stubbornly chewing on what Aristotle, in the Ethics, means by &lt;em>;eudaemonia&lt;/em>;. “Happiness” alone won&#39;t suffice. Aristotle himself, treading carefully, writes, “We have practically defined happiness as a sort of living and faring well.” I am partial to the modesty of “human flourishing.” Others prefer something like “the activity of a rational soul in accordance with virtue”—a daunting ideal that held sway for twenty-five hundred years, until it was roundly rebuffed by the creators of “Jackass.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Whether there is still a place for the steady intellectual grind is open to question. Readers and publishers alike are worried by all that worrying. Understandably, their quest is for books that promise results, primed to beef up one&#39;s &lt;em>;eudaemonia&lt;/em>; levels like a shot of Vitamin B&lt;sub>;12&lt;/sub>;. Hence the speed with which the mood of Brooks&#39;s book, grammatical and tonal, is set within the title: not “How to Build” but “Build.” Thereafter, the imperative reigns supreme. “Start by working on your toughness.” No sweat. “Take your grand vision of improvement and humble ambition to be part of it in a specific way and execute accordingly.” Check. “Rebel against your shame.” Done. “Widen your conflict-resolution repertoire.” Ka-pow! “Treat your walks, prayer time, and gym sessions as if they were meetings with the president.” Which President? “Journal your experiences and feelings over the course of the day.” Since when did “journal” turn into a transitive verb? “Dig into the extensive and growing technology and literature on mindfulness.” Sorry, I was miles away, what? Above all, “Remember: &lt;em>;You are your own CEO&lt;/em>;.” Holy moly. Do I have to wear a suit to brush my teeth? Is my dog a shareholder? Were last year&#39;s migraines tax-deductible? Can I be fired by me?&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The problem with imperatives is that the more frequent they become, or the more impassioned, the harder it is to obey them and to predict what the fallout from their implementation might be. When Judy Garland, in a tux and black tights, belted out “Get Happy” in “Summer Stock” (1950), you bowed to her command, even if you knew that her life off camera lay in ruins. When she sang the song thirteen years later, on TV, it was intertwined with “Happy Days Are Here Again,” sung by Barbra Streisand, who sat beside her: a rending mashup of two American anthems, delivered at a slow and stricken tempo, as if to acknowledge that the getting of happiness exacted too high a price. And, once it was got, then what?&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;You hear that fear again in the voice of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1975/07/14/cary-grant-profile-pauline-kael&quot;>;Cary Grant&lt;/a>; in “Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House” (1948). He plays an advertising man, hitherto squashed into a small New York apartment with his family, who buys a wreck in Connecticut, has it torn down, puts up a new place, and gets pushed to the brink. “Anybody who builds a house today is crazy. The minute you start, they put you on the list. The All-American Sucker list. You start out to build a home and you wind up in the poorhouse,” he cries. “What about the kids who just got married and want a home of their own? It&#39;s a conspiracy, I tell you, a conspiracy against every boy and girl who were ever in love.” The movie is a light comedy, but, this being Grant, the shadow of desperation is never far away, and what maddens Mr. Blandings is not just the practical chaos and the financial waste but the expense of spirit. He has been sold on his own dream.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I thought of Mr. Blandings often as I plowed through “Build the Life You Want.” Brooks radiates decency and good will; if you yearn to do up your life, like somebody who knocks down a wall and repaints the kitchen, he will lend you the tools. There is almost nothing that he will not undertake to fix. He has a stirring chapter on friendship, for which he has a proper Aristotelian reverence. (Even Bentham, no party animal, recommended “the pleasures of amity.”) So kindly is his disposition, indeed, that he has faith in the gentle resolving of ideological differences. The trick, apparently, is to reserve judgment: “You will find yourself not weighing in on political debates and giving fewer opinions; this will keep you calmer and in a greater state of inner peace.” It&#39;s wonderful to reflect on the millions of people who will heed that advice and maintain a monastic silence as we enter an election year.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Here and there, however, as you browse the book, you catch murmurs of disquiet. They tend to arise in casual comments, such as “Taking negativity personally can lead to rumination.” Heaven forfend! A ruminator on the loose! At other times, a plain recitation of statistics can freak you out, as when Brooks adduces an academic study from 2007:&lt;/p>;&lt;blockquote >;&lt;div >;&lt;p>;The researchers then examined a data set from another study that rated incoming college freshmen&#39;s “cheerfulness” and tracked their income nearly two decades later. They found that the most cheerful in 1976 were not the highest earners in 1995; that distinction once again went to the second-highest group, which rated their cheerfulness as “above average” but not in the highest 10 percent.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/blockquote>;&lt;p >;Where to begin with this? With the assumption that cheerfulness is a measurable quality and that, more to the point, a person is guaranteed to be the most reliable assessor of her or his own cheer? Or with the uncontested idea that a rising income conveys you ever closer to the summum bonum? It might have been pertinent, at this juncture, if Brooks had directed inquisitive readers to the Easterlin paradox—that is, to a controversial paper of 1974, “Does Economic Growth Improve the Human Lot? Some Empirical Evidence,” by the economist Richard A. Easterlin. The link between earnings and contentment, Easterlin claimed, was not as firm as might be expected, especially when one compared a variation in earnings inside a single country with a variation &lt;em>;between&lt;/em>; two separate countries. The fun part came in a chart that laid out the “Personal Happiness Rating” of thirteen nations, as recorded in the late fifties and early sixties. The lucky winners were the United States and Cuba.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;How most of us would rate our personal happiness these days, even without the Bay of Pigs to look forward to, is not something that Arthur C. Brooks and Oprah Winfrey presume to plot on a graph. I suspect, however, that in their view most of us are weltering in a woe of our own devising, and that, unlike Beethoven, we can&#39;t even get a decent symphony out of it. Hence Brooks&#39;s most provoking sentence of all, which is tucked away in parentheses, lest it disturb our equanimity. “(Unhappy people make great consumers),” he writes. And there we arrive at the heart of the matter. “Build the Life You Want” is the pure product of a liberal capitalist democracy: First World fretting, one might say, politely disguised as universal wisdom. It both springs from and speaks to an unmistakable patch of the planet, and, with the aid of muscular marketing and the imprimatur of Oprah, it will be ingested by those whose dolor, to their bewilderment, has been aggravated rather than soothed by mass consumption. “Turn off self-view on Zoom. Don&#39;t take any selfies,” we read, in this rousing hymn to self-help. Round and round we go. ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;qozs89&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 16 Oct 2023 19:06:02 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
