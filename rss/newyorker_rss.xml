data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;当它出现时，我正在努力对事实、虚构和谣言进行分类泰勒·斯威夫特和特拉维斯·凯尔斯的关系。但随后，周五晚上，我开车带着一群四年级的女孩去康涅狄格州的一家购物中心看电影《泰勒·斯威夫特：时代之旅》，该片在北美周末票房收入近亿美元，成为北美周末票房收入近亿美元的电影。有史以来票房最高的音乐会电影。通过偷听我女儿和她的 Swifties 同伴在后座的闲聊，然后问我的孩子一些后续问题，我了解到 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/sports/sporting-scene /kelce-swift-is-a-dream-pairing-for-the-nfl&quot;>;泰勒和“国家橄榄球运动员”特拉维斯&lt;/a>;“暂时只是朋友——&lt;em>;暂时&lt; /em>;”，尽管泰勒确实“让所有人都在谈论”一段所谓的浪漫史，为《时代》电影宣传，但她和凯尔斯确实很快就会开始“真正”约会。果然，就在第二天晚上，斯威夫特和凯尔斯在《周六夜现场》中分别客串后，狗仔队发现他们手拉手离开派对结束。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;女孩们对斯威夫特的分析——凯尔斯提炼了初级 Swiftie 心态的关键方面，无论是在其纯洁的愿望铸造中（&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuNIsY6JdUw&quot;>;闪回&lt;/a>;大约在 2009 年，泰勒坐在看台上等待与这位足球明星的射门），正如我的一位乘客所说，斯威夫特是“最伟大的女商人”：是的，她是一个精明、甚至狡猾的品牌设计师，但本质上是一个诚实的经纪人。即使是最新手的 Swifties，在某种直觉层面上也知道他们正在被玩，并且他们很乐意一起玩 - 尤其是因为他们有很多朋友可以一起玩。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;在夏末，我我和家人搬到了一个新城镇，在那里我们谁也不认识，开学几周后，我的女儿就成了《&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker. com/culture/listening-booth/in-taylor-swifts-midnights-the-easter-eggs-arent-the-point&quot;>;午夜&lt;/a>;”被招募为激进的斯威夫特。很容易看出原因。我错过了为孩子们报名参加足球比赛的最后期限。我们不去教堂。斯威夫特之家以歌词的形式提供经文，以音乐会商品和友谊手镯的形式提供法衣；它提供了共同奉献的社会粘合剂。我只能给孩子一个新家；我需要泰勒·斯威夫特帮助她找到她的人。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;在电影院大厅内，我为每个女孩购买了一个 10 美元的“泰勒·斯威夫特：时代之旅”水杯和 13 个女孩-一桶价值一美元的“泰勒·斯威夫特：时代之旅”爆米花供他们分享——我们加入了母亲和女儿、一群二十多岁的女性、年轻的同性恋夫妇和一对老年异性恋夫妇，他们希望我们的小队知道“泰勒·斯威夫特：时代之旅”所有的音乐都是她自己写的。”这个场景是 Swiftian Ren Faire 的场景：我们看到了《Shake It Off》视频中的啦啦队服装、《You Belong with Me》中的魔术标记 T 恤、《Reputation》巡演中的黑色亮片连帽紧身连衣裤以及大量闪闪发光的及地长礼服，体现了斯威夫特的罗达特与追逐萤火虫的美学。电影观众在眼睛周围画了粉色闪光的心形，以纪念《情人》的宣传艺术，并将友谊手镯叠到肘部，以致敬《孩子，你靠自己》中的一句歌词。一位女士将她的雨燕鞋混合搭配，将她的褶边苔绿色“民俗”连衣裙与“Lavender Haze”视频中的毛茸茸夹克搭配，并搭配一双“Fearless”复古女牛仔靴，强调“合身”。服装就像音乐会和电影一样，在泰勒时代巧妙地来回移动，本着一丝不苟的崇敬精神。&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;我的同事阿曼达·彼得鲁西奇 (Amanda Petrusich) 写道&lt;a href =&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/06/19/taylor-swift-eras-tour-review&quot;>;斯威夫特的粉丝如此热情地与她联系&lt;/a>;，部分原因是这位明星的“ ”你们充满活力，一种健谈的、虚假的亲密关系。” 《Eras》电影恰恰体现了这种氛围，把斯威夫特表现得就像一个单身女孩出去庆祝生日，她邀请了七万名她最亲密的朋友，而这恰好轮到她在卡拉 OK 麦克风前。她做了很多“哎呀谁-我”的事情？！她一直在演戏，这在她十几岁的时候很迷人，几年后就变得刺耳和虚伪，现在看起来像是对这一点无可挑剔的承诺。在《残酷的夏天》之后，斯威夫特假装难以置信，所有这些&lt;em>;人&lt;/em>;都来这里看&lt;em>;她&lt;/em>;，就像，&lt;em>;什么&lt;/em>;？！？ - 告诉她观众认为他们让她感觉“如此强大”；音乐会快结束时，她声称对观众不得不忍受最后一首歌曲感到有点内疚（天哪，抱歉！）。在“永远”期间，斯威夫特——在&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tag/coronavirus&quot;>;&lt;em>;COVID&lt;/em>;-19&lt;/a的头几个月里>; 封锁，建立了一个家庭录音室，创作并录制了整张专辑，并主演并导演了一部精心制作的音乐视频，所有这些都在严格的安全限制下进行——将她在大流行时代的状态描述为“一个孤独的千禧一代，全身覆盖着猫毛，花了七年的时间每天看一百小时电视。”这些假装谦虚的行为是荒谬的，而且在斯威夫特职业生涯的这个阶段，它们是&lt;em>;极其&lt;/em>;可笑的——宏伟而古怪，也就是说，适合一个超级巨星。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;斯威夫特二十多岁的时候，她的事业经历了一段尴尬的青春期，当时她似乎陷入了思想的中学阶段。她的失败者形象开始变得坚强，成为烈士情结。 （这段时期我最喜欢的一集是金球奖主持人蒂娜·菲对斯威夫特的连续约会倾向开了一个极其温和的玩笑，斯威夫特对此回应道：“地狱里有一个特殊的地方，专门为那些不帮助其他女性的女性准备的。” ”）《时代》电影几乎没有否认斯威夫特的后页中任何她可能会后悔的章节——或者她只是已经长大了——但有时它会用最微弱的精心校准的羞怯来缓和其深情的怀旧之情，就像当斯威夫特转世为 BPD 恶棍时那样《空白》和《看看你让我做了什么》，或者《魔法奇缘》中的奶油糖霜公主。无论她是在充满对抗性的华丽节奏中大步走在T台上，还是在假芭蕾舞般的滑奏中旋转双臂，她都是在空中引用，而她引用的人就是年轻的斯威夫特，她并没有完全把她抛在后面。 p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;此删除措施，我认为，这也有助于说明斯威夫特对青少年的非凡指挥力。孩子们正在为成人的世界进行排练，他们正在尝试着外表、姿势和信仰，看看自己是否适合自己，而斯威夫特，在三十三岁的成年期，正在以一种讽刺的事后诸葛亮的态度重新审视她过去的自己；艺术家和她的粉丝在稍微接近材料时，最终在中间相遇并紧紧地抱在一起。至少从周五晚上来看，柏拉图式的中间部分可能是“红色”的：在诸如“22”和“We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together”之类的歌曲中，一个疲惫不堪的陪伴者可以看到她比她年轻的人经历着一种欣喜若狂的溶解自我融入歌曲——一种纯粹的、令人兴奋的快乐。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;在这种情况下反对任何被认为过度的热情可能会让人觉得无礼。但观众中有一个人的斯威夫特式的欣快感，在歌词的记忆中完美无瑕，在音量上几乎是暴力的、煽动性的、令人震惊的。她恰好坐在我女儿和她朋友的正后方，随着电影的进行，她的叫声分贝和频率都增加了。这个女孩是不真实的——就好像《全金属外壳》中的教官是一个斯威夫特，或者是一个绞痛的新生儿，或者是一个有知觉的手提钻，或者是流浪者队的球迷。我试图通过思考尖叫电影来分散自己的注意力。 （当她在“看看你让我做了什么”期间尖叫“我不喜欢你！”时，我在笔记本上写道，“《闪灵》中的雪莱·杜瓦尔。”当她尖叫时，“香槟！问题！”在“香槟问题”期间，我写道，&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7lVAuXGEOo&quot;>;“我是一个&lt;em>;staaarrrrrrr&lt;/em>;。”&lt;/a>; ”）我负责的女孩们在猛烈的攻击下退缩了，然后萎靡不振；他们停止跳舞，倒在座位上。有人低声说，她一直希望泰勒·斯威夫特能在这次放映中惊喜亮相，但现在她不抱希望了，因为他们背后的女孩可能会病得很重。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;最终，我的女儿和她的朋友们他们逃到剧院前面，第一排和银幕之间，在那里他们又开始跟着每句话跳舞和唱歌。几个女孩跟着他们，然后还有几十个。当我注意到那位肠绞痛的教官也来到前线时，我的心沉了下去。但没有什么可担心的。显然，她已经了解了社区的信号和社会规范，并相应地调整了电压；她现在被拨入人群，她在唱歌，而不是尖叫，她知道她的人民可以听到她的声音。在“午夜”场景中，女孩们在闲聊中闲逛，交换名字和友谊手镯。一名高中生带来了一整袋手镯来分发。一群孩子和另一群孩子手拉着手围成一圈跳舞，而其他孩子则围着他们翻滚。音乐流淌在他们身上，也为他们而流淌；他们比屏幕上的任何东西都更全神贯注地看着彼此，泰勒从高处向他们微笑，一时半被遗忘，只是另一位陪伴者。 ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot;

data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;关于 Velvet Underground 官方盗版歌曲“Live at Max&#39;s Kansas City”，录制于 8 月 23 日，1970 年，您可以在某一时刻听到作者和市中心的面孔&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2010/12/06/off-the-rim&quot;>;吉姆·卡罗尔&lt;/ a>;，在观众席上，请某人去给他拿一杯“双倍保乐力加”，然后与路过的毒贩互动。 “你有沮丧吗？”他说。 “它是什么？图纳尔？赶紧给我。”那天晚上，乐队的曲目单包括“New Age”和“Beginning to See the Light”等歌曲，但没有人会把他们苍白的喧嚣误认为是十九世纪六十年代甜美的和声和更甜美的乐观情绪。在这个肮脏的密室里，性、毒品和摇滚乐并不预示着某个空灵的乌托邦的黎明；相反，它是一个充满希望的地方。气氛是新的、黑暗的。分解。雾化。严重的麻醉品。 《Live at Max&#39;s》由 Brigid Berlin 录制，她曾是&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/06/08/untangling-andy-warhol&quot;>;安迪·沃霍尔&lt;/a >; 他的父亲是赫斯特公司的总裁。她的沃霍尔姓氏是布里吉德·波尔克 (Brigid Polk)，因她习惯用装有安非他明的注射器随意戳人而得名。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;上流社会和下流社会、顶层公寓和人行道的混合，是周围场景的显着标志，那里有一种对低俗事物的自觉的自豪感。 “人渣”和“朋克”是褒义词。价值观被颠覆，就像&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/08/11/enfants-terribles&quot;>;Genet&lt;/a>;：正直社会认为无可救药的低级，却被抬高。人们在路易十六的凡尔赛宫里以射击场和游轮为背景，像法国小贵族一样尽情玩乐。 1970 年夏天，这个特殊地下乐队的双性恋外表和奢侈道德即将成为主流，被誉为“魅力摇滚”。 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/sasha-frere-jones/postscript-lou-reed&quot;>;卢·里德&lt;/a>;是其模棱两可的君主。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;他出生于布鲁克林，但在长岛弗里波特长大。他有一个妹妹，玛格丽特·艾伦，后来成为一名家庭治疗师，并改名为梅里尔。他的父母托比和西德尼是逃离东欧反犹太主义的犹太移民的孩子。西德尼的原姓是拉比诺维茨（Rabinowitz）；在联邦调查局询问他曾为一个工会做过一些会计工作后，他将其改为里德。据除了他自己之外的每个人说，卢一直有一个基本正常而快乐的童年，直到他十几岁或十几岁左右。他受过成人礼。他在学校很受欢迎，喜欢运动和自动点唱机流行音乐，并被称为“化妆唐璜”。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;里德的单曲流行歌曲“Walk on the Wild Side”——排名第一。 1973 年，《告示牌》百强单曲榜上排名第 16 位——讲述的是人们像朝圣者一样跃入纽约，夺取迄今为止只存在于脑海中的生活的故事。 “这里喧嚣，那里喧嚣/纽约市是……的地方。 。 ”。他在二十出头的时候对这段旅程进行了自己的简化版本，最终在勒德洛街 56 号的一间阁楼里定居下来，在那里他与另一位来自更远地方的流亡者住在一起：这位阴郁的、受过古典训练的威尔士人 &lt;a href=&quot;https:/ /www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/01/30/john-cales-inventive-retrospection&quot;>;约翰·卡尔&lt;/a>;。卡尔一年前抵达美国，在坦格尔伍德音乐中心师从作曲家亚伦·科普兰学习。他涉足各种前卫派，并向里德介绍了约翰·凯奇和拉蒙特·扬的左场音乐，以及皮耶罗·赫利泽和杰克·史密斯等越野电影制作人。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>; Velvet Underground——Reed、Cale、鼓手 Moe Tucker 和吉他手 Sterling Morrison，后来又补充了德国歌手 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/books/under-review/the-misunderstood-voice -of-nico&quot;>;Nico&lt;/a>;——成为了一个以沃霍尔为中心的场景的室内乐队，沃霍尔是乐队事实上的经理：实验电影档案管理员和概念艺术家、骗子和经销商、专业演讲者的紧张蒙太奇，歌剧迷。许多追随者是如此时髦，以至于著名艺术家纷纷模仿他们，而不是相反。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;在表演中，地下丝绒乐队恪守着当时对摇滚乐不熟悉的原则。别显得你太努力了。不要看起来像穿着舞台服装。不要表现得好像你关心观众离开时是否留下​​深刻印象。里德唱的是关于毒品和性实验的歌曲，他的歌词处理了尖锐的细节，而不是模糊的概括，这是他从他最喜欢的一些作家那里学到的技巧：&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/ 2014/02/03/the-outlaw&quot;>;威廉·S·巴勒斯&lt;/a>;、约翰·雷奇、休伯特·塞尔比。他还吸收了伦尼·布鲁斯尖锐的方言，并在注定失败的纽约诗人身上找到了某种导师&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/personal-history/delmore-schwartz-and-the -传记作者-痴迷&quot;>;德尔莫·施瓦茨&lt;/a>;。 （他和施瓦茨第一次见面是在一家酒吧；里德后来报名参加了施瓦茨在雪城大学的文学课程。施瓦茨于 1966 年在时代广场的一家酒店去世，享年 52 岁。） 《m Waiting for the Man》和《Venus in Furs》因比摇滚乐更“真实”而受到赞誉。&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >; &lt;/div>;&lt;p>;沃霍尔向他的小圈子赠送了自我认定的“超级明星”——&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/the-tropic-appeal-of-warhols-工厂&quot;>;Ondine&lt;/a>;、Ultra Violet、Candy Darling——一种开放获取的明星形象，但又不稳定、脆弱、不稳定。来自不同恒星系统的卫星绕着他干燥、死气沉沉的卫星运行。再加上严重的集体滥用药物，每个人的生活都变得衣衫褴褛、全天候（24/7）。一场存在主义的冒险——酷到生死攸关。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;当神话成为你日常生活的一部分时会发生什么？对于卢·里德 (Lou Reed) 的任何传记作者来说，这都是一个难题，包括最新的摇滚评论家威尔·赫尔墨斯 (Will Hermes)，他是一本名为“&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Lou-Reed-”的大型新编年史的作者。 King-New-York-ebook/dp/B0BQGK1K5D&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Lou-Reed -King-New-York-ebook/dp/B0BQGK1K5D&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Lou-Reed-King-New-York-ebook/dp/B0BQGK1K5D&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;卢·里德：纽约之王&lt;/a>;”——有时里德拥抱他的角色，并尽可能地发挥它，有时他说话时就好像他只是其痛苦的受害者。七十年代，对里德的报道在二元论之间摇摆不定，有时在同一篇文章中：严肃的艺术家与卑鄙的骗子，勇敢的说真话者与狡猾的商人。 1975 年，他告诉 Lenny Kaye：“我可能比任何人都模​​仿得更好，”他补充道，“我创造了卢·里德 (Lou Reed)。我和那个家伙没有任何共同点，但我可以很好地扮演他。”基思·理查兹 (Keith Richards) 将米克·贾格尔 (Mick Jagger) 描述为“一群好人”——更新了萨克斯演奏家祖特·西姆斯 (Zoot Sims) 曾经对斯坦·盖茨 (Stan Getz) 的俏皮话——但贾格尔是一位意志坚定的社交牛虻，他的目标是非常具体的奖品。相比之下，我们不清楚里德对自己的权力游戏施加了多大的控制，以及这让他快乐或不快乐。 1973 年斑斓的《柏林》，到五年后粗糙的现场演出《Take No Prisoners》，还是同年 1975 年推出不人道的《金属机器音乐》和温柔的《康尼岛宝贝》？对于音乐作家莱斯特·邦斯（Lester Bangs）等痴迷者来说，里德一半是先知，一半是小丑。邦斯专门为里德撰写了一系列文章，无论它们有什么缺陷——包括对瑞秋·汉弗莱斯（Rachel Humphreys）的一些非常冒犯的言论，瑞秋·汉弗莱斯是里德在 1973 年至 1978 年间与她一起生活和工作的跨性别女性——但它们为这个男人提供了一种其他人没有的感觉。走近一点。邦斯以卓越的表现描绘了一幅速度狂人的肖像：一个行动方针的三种不同理由可能会在一个晚上提出，每一种理由都在它提出的那一刻被相信。是里德的毒瘾助长了这场演讲，还是他疯狂地服用兴奋剂以实现神话？他的粉丝崇拜他的原因之一正是：私人自我和投射形象之间的差距就像勺子里的药丸一样消失了。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;里德的大多数标志性形象都呈现出某种不变的外观：他的大，毛坯，花岗岩面；皮革;色调。这是一个没有感觉的人，还是一个害怕感觉太多的人？凶狠的眼神，还是麻醉般的冷漠？他是那些带着孩子气的人之一，他受到了严重的伤害，以至于从未完全康复。总是测试朋友的诚意，就像时髦的测谎仪一样。他们曾经踩在蛋壳上的东西现在让其他人踩在上面。&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;里德与父亲的关系似乎是关键。唉，在传记中，他的童年在我们不知不觉中就过去了——在我们意识到之前，他正在和女孩约会，组建团体，吸毒。就在他十八岁生日即将到来之际，他遭受了严重的精神崩溃，他的父母被说服用电休克疗法来治疗。赫尔墨斯对这一事件的处理有点过于谨慎；他引用了一段很长的话：“&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Bell-Jar-Modern-Classics/dp/0060837020&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot; :&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Bell-Jar-Modern-Classics/dp/0060837020&quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/ Bell-Jar-Modern-Classics/dp/0060837020&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;钟形罩&lt;/a>;”做了很多繁重的工作。里德后来声称 ECT 的目的是“治愈”他的同性恋倾向，但他的妹妹（似乎是这里更可靠的证人之一）否认了这一点，并且没有证据支持这一点。无论出于何种原因，这次治疗成为他一生中的决定性时刻。赫尔墨斯将其描述为“里德神话的一部分”。梅里尔，在&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/cuepoint/a-family-in-peril-lou-reed-s-sister-sets-the-record-straight-about-his-childhood-20e8399f84a3 &quot;>;2015 年发表的文章&lt;/a>;写道，“从开始那些悲惨的治疗那天起，我们的家庭就四分五裂了。”&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>; &lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;歌曲是给压抑的孩子的一份礼物，让他可以让情感自由飞翔。摇滚乐的诞生是一种爆炸​​性的宣泄，但它也带来了其他的东西，一些新的东西：年轻人，通常来自朴素的背景，凭空变出美丽，音调混合，和谐。里德和凯尔的严酷关系与当时其他男性伙伴的关系相呼应，包括列侬和麦卡特尼、贾格尔和理查兹、布莱恩·威尔逊和他的兄弟，这些都是乐队的不同声音。里德最初喜爱的音乐是 doo-wop。十几岁的时候，他与一个名为“Shades”的新兴乐队一起录制唱片，弹吉他并伴唱。 Doo-wop 团体通常是黑人或拉丁裔，而且通常都是女性。这一流派以其他边缘化的声音而自豪，其独特的审美既神圣又亵渎。这与自夸相反，是对 45 的一种简短的、幽灵般的遐想。对于有抱负的词曲作者里德来说，一个重要的教训是，世界上最柔和的歌曲可能很容易暗示最残酷的事实。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;尽管如此best known for mapping extreme human states, some of Reed&#39;s most beloved songs—“I&#39;ll Be Your Mirror,” “Pale Blue Eyes,” “Candy Says,” “Perfect Day,” “Berlin”—are about as un-rock and roll as it is possible to be. They brush against your listening mood like a rueful ghost; they feel, at times, almost like prayer. Take “Perfect Day,” from the 1972 album “Transformer.” Gentle, hovering, entrancingly ambiguous, it could be about heroin addiction or domestic contentment or spoiled dreams or something else altogether. And it is all the more devastating for being delivered in something like a crooner&#39;s lilt from another era. (The precise and celestial arrangement by the English musician Mick Ronson helps.) Reed wrote it with Bettye Kronstad, whom he&#39;d met in 1968, when she was a nineteen-year-old undergraduate at Columbia. (They married and divorced the year after “Transformer” was released.) At first, the song was called “Just a Summer&#39;s Day,” but Reed&#39;s haunting coda, “You&#39;re going to reap / Just what you sow,” turns it into something far more unnerving. Reed had a saving economy with words; he often wrote like he was sending telegrams to a new lover.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;And yet, the one time I saw him perform live, in 1979, he reduced all those magical songs to a soulless workout—slick, armored, bombastic, and so overamplified the night became a grim endurance test. It felt unpleasant, like a private exercise in contempt and control. It was as if he didn&#39;t want us to receive any pleasure from his art.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The next year, Reed released an album called “Growing Up in Public,” something he had been doing for a while, at a time when the music business had no notion of anything like a “duty of care.” Self-medication is the phrase we now use for how people react to unbearable pressures, imposed both from within and without. (Bangs died from an apparently accidental overdose of pills, in 1982.) Hermes is vague on the extent to which Reed, for all his midlife attendance at AA meetings, did finally get clean and sober; late in the book, he notes, with jarring casualness, that Reed “still drank on occasion.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Reed&#39;s private life is spangled with contradictions, but one thing is clear: he never wanted to be a father. There was no desire to recast the family life he sprang from. (“But, Papa, I know that this visit&#39;s a mistake / There&#39;s nothing here we have in common, except our name,” he sings on “Families,” one of the great underrated Reed songs, from the 1979 album “The Bells.”) That he was dead set on not being a parent might warrant some reflection, but Hermes more or less dispenses with the fact in a half-joking aside about how Reed preferred to have pets. And you get only the faintest sense from the book of why anyone would put up with Reed as a domestic partner. Glimpses of life with Lou before his late-life marriage to the artist and musician Laurie Anderson: sullen, glowering, irascible, passed-out drunk or shooting up.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Both Kronstad and Humphreys, the romantic partner who succeeded her, feel more alive on the page than Reed, who, against their discernible human qualities, remains a locked trunk. To Hermes&#39;s credit, the section on Humphreys is one of the most vivid of the book. Reed was silent about why their relationship ended, but her desire to fully transition may have been decisive. Hermes doesn&#39;t dig too deep when it comes to Reed&#39;s sexuality, which is perhaps understandable; speculation about the intimate lives of others is difficult to pull off without undue prurience. But the book&#39;s reliance on more au-courant terms, such as “gender fluid” and “nonbinary,” can feel like decals applied to an opaque surface, with none of the silt or soil of real life. Reed claimed, at one point, that he was “one hundred per cent gay,” and, in a 1978 interview, he asserted, with seemingly deliberate innuendo, that he was gay from “top to bottom.” What he didn&#39;t mention was that he was then cohabiting with Sylvia Morales, who was about to become his second wife.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Hermes describes that interview on page 304, about two thirds of the way through the book. I made a worried notation in the margin: “We&#39;re still only in 1978.” The logging of details from the sixties and seventies takes up much of the biography, and that ground has been covered in other books—some of them very good, including Mary Woronov&#39;s “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Swimming-Underground-Years-Warhol-Factory/dp/1885203217&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Swimming-Underground-Years-Warhol-Factory/dp/1885203217&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Swimming-Underground-Years-Warhol-Factory/dp/1885203217&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;Swimming Underground&lt;/a>;” and Cale&#39;s memoir “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Whats-Welsh-Zen-Autobiography-John/dp/1582340684&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Whats-Welsh-Zen-Autobiography-John/dp/1582340684&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Whats-Welsh-Zen-Autobiography-John/dp/1582340684&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;What&#39;s Welsh for Zen&lt;/a>;.” Hermes quotes liberally from these and other works, and also from many other rock writers; it&#39;s generous but can give his own writing a slightly impersonal feel. The marshalling of facts that is de rigeur in this sort of biography is perhaps redundant in the age of Wikipedia, when set lists and equipment details and capsule bios of bit players can all be found online. Hermes builds a solid thoroughfare, but mysterious hollows in the passing landscape remain unexplored.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;begr2&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;7ft469&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;In the eighties, Reed shocked some fans by appearing in an ad for Honda scooters and licensing “Walk on the Wild Side” for use in the spot. Hermes describes the commercial as “the most aesthetically effective film presentation of Reed&#39;s music to date,” and notes that the move is not all that surprising for an artist who was mentored by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2010/01/11/top-of-the-pops&quot;>;Warhol&lt;/a>;. (Reed later cut a deal with American Express, too.) Reed&#39;s music was revitalized, early in the decade, by a partnership with the guitarist Robert Quine; at the end of the decade, Reed had a huge critical and commercial success with “New York,” his most suasively personal and political work in a long time. He seemed more open to the world and other people, less caught up in the coils of his own mythos. He reunited with Cale to record “Songs for Drella,” an intimate and affecting tribute to Warhol, who had died in 1987. This unlikely détente resulted in a tentative reformation of the original Velvet Underground lineup for a series of live shows, but, as happened so often with Reed and his collaborators—including Quine—things soured, became fractious, stalled. The other band members were gracious and discreet, but enough was said to leave the impression of a faintly aristocratic Reed who was graceless and intransigent.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Then he met Laurie Anderson, at an experimental-music festival. They were together for twenty-one years, the longest relationship of his life. Hermes struggles a bit here—domestic contentment is tougher to evoke on the page than logging one more abscess from shooting speed. Its tendrils are care and compromise and mutual respect; it is built, bartered, imagined into life. It is untidy, and there are no handy buzzwords to cover its rewards.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The late redemption arc with Anderson is heartening, but you do get the impression that Reed reserved his warm and fuzzy side for fellow art-world royalty, and only let Mr. Angry out on the menials. In his work, Reed was capable of dizzying feats of empathy and tenderness; in his life, not so much. He had a hair-trigger temper and a bad reputation for being rude and offhand with serving staff. Toward the end, he becomes one of those artists who fly around the world taking cameo roles in one another&#39;s big corporate-sponsored multimedia productions. He is revered and honored in Europe; he hangs out with an adoring &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/vaclav-havels-lessons-on-how-to-create-a-parallel-polis&quot;>;Václav Havel&lt;/a>; in Prague; he and Anderson play host at their local bistro to Nicolas Sarkozy “and the chanteuse Carla Bruni.” After dinner, they all go on to a wild night of jazz with Woody Allen at Café Carlyle.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The most vivid moment of Hermes&#39;s narrative comes at the beginning of the book, and the end of Reed&#39;s life. Two days before his death, in 2013, Reed was floating in the “pale blue water of the heated swimming pool behind his East Hampton home.” Terminally weak, and held up by the burly arms of his friend Julian Schnabel, Reed&#39;s thoughts drifted to his childhood on Long Island&#39;s South Shore. He told Schnabel about a moment when the family was at the beach and Reed affectionately made to hold his father&#39;s hand; he was repaid, he said, with a smack in the face. His sister disputes the scenario, saying their father never raised a hand to anyone. But this was the image in Reed&#39;s mind, as he lay dying, of liver disease, at the age of seventy-one.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;It&#39;s possible to see Reed as someone who tried out all manner of masks and roles in his life but essentially stayed the same. Knotted inside, the not-father—a core symptom ignored or played with but never shifted. In 2011, two years before his death from liver disease, he partnered with the heavy-metal band Metallica for the album “Lulu.” It was panned by many critics, and fans remain divided on it, but, as Hermes notes, the album has one inarguably wonderful track, its nineteen-minute closer, “Junior Dad.” Brooding, serpentine, blissed-out, it returns us to Reed&#39;s early-sixties meetings with Cale and La Monte Young and their time-altering experiments with musical drone. A sea chantey about the bardo or the afterlife, a circular mantra concerning fathers and sons and aging and love—it&#39;s like a crowning testament, and it is deeply moving. Was it only here, where the word “dad” is finally pronounced, that Reed loosened up inside, breathed out, swam free? That it was all uttered, in one glorious, oceanic song?&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I met Reed once, in 1996, for a forty-five-minute press interview on the occasion of his album “Set the Twilight Reeling.” I wasn&#39;t in the best of shape myself back then—you know things are bad when Lou Reed is healthier than you are—but what I remember most are his eyes. I got the sense that he was trying to rustle up one of his trademark badass glares but that his heart wasn&#39;t in it. How does it feel, I wondered, to have to navigate not only media obligations but ordinary social encounters as if you are alone in a jungle of adversaries? When a conversation looms up before you as something staked with boundary posts, barbed wire flecked with the fleece and blood from long-ago tussles? Now, years later, rerunning the film, with all I know about childhood hurt and addiction and recovery, it occurs to me that, under the bravado, he actually looked quite scared. ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;41ndl&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 16 Oct 2023 23:06:01 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[When a Novelist Carries On What Another Novelist Started]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/10/23/a-haunting-on-the-hill-elizabeth-hand-book-review]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-16T10:00:00.000Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6525be753ecac81f96238376/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/231023_r43206.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;article >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attribute-verso-pattern=&quot;article-body&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;ArticlePageChunks&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Elizabeth Hand&#39;s “A Haunting on the Hill” (Mulholland) is, the book jacket notes, “the first novel authorized to return to the world of Shirley Jackson&#39;s &lt;em>;The Haunting of Hill House&lt;/em>;.” Authorized—by whom? Not by Jackson, who died in 1965, but by her heirs. “A Haunting on the Hill” is, therefore, a ghost story conjured by representatives of a deceased author&#39;s estate. It all sounds a little uncanny.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Isn&#39;t that the case, though, whenever we try to resurrect dead writers? In the past decade, a resurgence of acclaim has fully established Shirley Jackson as the queen of dark literary fiction, and there is no surer sign of an author&#39;s success than the arrival of a new generation of writers eager to channel her spirit, rereading and reimagining her work. So much for the death of the author. These days, it seems, fan-fiction writers start posting their rewrites the moment a book leaves the printer—sometimes over the author&#39;s vociferous objections.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Yet not a few literary classics, too, are constructed as revisions of previous ones, typically works in the public domain. Think of how Jean Rhys revised Charlotte Brontë&#39;s “Jane Eyre” in “Wide Sargasso Sea,” excavating a Caribbean backstory for that madwoman in the attic. Or how JM Coetzee broke apart “Robinson Crusoe” and rearranged the pieces to write “Foe.” Or how Peter Carey pillaged Charles Dickens to create “Jack Maggs,” with its title character based on the escaped convict who, in “Great Expectations,” turns out to be Pip&#39;s secret benefactor.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;GenericCallout&quot;>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;external-link-embed--inline&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;a aria-label=&quot;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;The Best Books We Read This Week&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.newyorker.com/best-books-2023&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/best-books-2023&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;&lt;span >;&lt;strong>;The Best Books We Read This Week&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/a>;&lt;p >;&lt;em>;Read our reviews of notable new fiction and nonfiction, updated every Wednesday.&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;a aria-label=&quot;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;The Best Books We Read This Week&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.newyorker.com/best-books-2023&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/best-books-2023&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/63c800e4e99d89b838ada996/1:1/w_200%2Cc_limit/undefined&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/63c800e4e99d89b838ada996/1:1/w_120,c_limit/undefined 120w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/a>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Historically, though, such literary incursion into another writer&#39;s territory has involved competition, rebellion, even hostility. The connection to the earlier work can be oblique and entirely tacit, and it&#39;s notable that some of the greatest novels in the form have been written by authors bound to their predecessors in a post-colonial relation. In these cases, a defiance of authority is the literary catalyst. One can hardly imagine Chinua Achebe petitioning the heirs to the copyright to “Heart of Darkness” for permission to fill in the hazy areas on Joseph Conrad&#39;s map.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;By contrast, the more docile “authorized” novel has typically been reserved for juggernaut copyright-protected characters, like Ian Fleming&#39;s James Bond or Robert Ludlum&#39;s Jason Bourne—publishing ventures that have proved so profitable for so many people that it would be absurd to let the income stream be disrupted by a minor detail like a writer&#39;s death. The result can be disconcerting. I remember, as a teen-ager, plucking a VC Andrews novel off the “New Books” shelf at the library, and realizing, a few chapters in, that something was . 。 。 &lt;em>;off&lt;/em>;. I later discovered, in what felt like a very VC Andrews twist, that Andrews had died years before, and the book I&#39;d been reading had been written by someone else (a man!). If I&#39;d squinted, I could have seen that the name “VC Andrews” on the cover bore a tiny superscripted ®, for registered trademark. In a way, we&#39;d both been betrayed: I&#39;d been tricked by a cleverly packaged counterfeit, while she&#39;d been sold out by heirs who thought she could be replaced by someone else. To love someone, after all, is to believe that the person possesses some quality that makes her unique. That simulacrum Andrews novel left me feeling as if I were a kid bereft after the death of my puppy and my parents were blandly offering to buy a replacement.&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;These days, the more sophisticated literary estates may be less likely to hire ghostwriters to imitate a deceased writer&#39;s work; instead, they authorize established writers to continue the work (and share cover credit) under their own names. The premise of a seamless transition, in which the original author slips off into the afterlife unnoticed, has been replaced by a Frankenstein-like chimera of the living and the dead. In this vein, we get Sophie Hannah writing for Agatha Christie, Sebastian Faulks writing for Ian Fleming, Brandon Sanderson chosen by the heir of Robert Jordan to continue the unfinished fantasy series “The Wheel of Time.” (On a loftier plane, Sandra Newman&#39;s “Julia,” out this month, is an authorized “feminist retelling” of George Orwell&#39;s “1984.”) Such collaborations tend to be respectful, reasonably successful, and positively reviewed, but there often is, nonetheless, something unnervingly lifeless about them. Like all the undead, the books&#39; resurrected protagonists are free to perform only a few limited actions, shadowy repetitions of actions they took in life—solving mysteries, spying on behalf of England, channelling the One Power. It&#39;s hard to read them without imagining those unseen authorities peering over the writer&#39;s shoulder and wondering about the limits of their good will.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;The shiver that arises when creativity is touched by the cold finger of authority has nothing to do with the individuals involved. As a screenwriter working on an adaptation of a Shirley Jackson novel, I&#39;ve had some contact with the folks from the Jackson estate, and (I swear) they&#39;ve been great. But the creation of official sequels and spinoffs is inevitably haunted by questions of agency, power, and control. To join Elizabeth Hand on her journey to Hill House is to be reminded of the slippery dominance of genius, the way it both establishes and breaks its own rules, tempting then trapping those who dare to follow them. Faithfully adhering to the rules doesn&#39;t guarantee success, yet breaking them will inevitably invite accusations of failure and betrayal. Each reader who arrives at “A Haunting on the Hill” hoping to return to the original Hill House will feel disappointed in her own way, although the shape of her disappointment will speak more to the nature of her loyalty to Jackson than to the qualities of the new book. Perhaps unsurprisingly, “A Haunting on the Hill” is least successful when Hand directly imitates Jackson, most successful when she draws on her own talents—and becomes truly fascinating when Hand lets those anxious whispers about authority and influence take over the tale.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The premise of Jackson&#39;s “The Haunting of Hill House” is that four strangers come together in order to conduct a paranormal investigation of Hill House, which has a reputation for being haunted. The premise of Hand&#39;s “A Haunting on the Hill” is that four friends come together to rent Hill House in order to spend some time workshopping a play. The house is, unequivocally, the same one, as is clear from its name, its location (the town of Hillsdale), and its layout. That Hand can be so explicit about this is one of the privileges of full authorization—she doesn&#39;t need to waste any time filing off the serial numbers. The chronology, too, is the same. There are passing references to the events of “The Haunting of Hill House”: “The woman whose husband built the place was killed when her carriage ran into a tree. That was in 1880. Then another woman was killed about sixty years ago when her car ran into the same tree. Same thing happened again with another woman in the eighties. They finally cut the tree down.” The middle woman is Eleanor Vance, the protagonist of “The Haunting of Hill House”; by dispensing with her so swiftly, Hand establishes that the house is the real star of the show. But there is a palpable discomfort there, too, in how those events are waved away, sandwiched between two other deaths and then dismissed with a joke. “That doesn&#39;t sound haunted . 。 。 sounds like bad driveway design,” remarks the narrator, a fortysomething playwright named Holly Sherwin, who&#39;s hoping to revive her flatlined career with a spooky play titled “Witching Night.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;In Jackson&#39;s novel, Hill House is associated with so many deaths and disturbing occurrences that the only reason to spend the night there is that you seek to encounter a ghost. By the time Holly and her friends show up, decades later, the body count has only risen, which is why it&#39;s the perfect place to develop “Witching Night.” But then we run into that horror-movie dynamic wherein the people on the screen are oblivious of what&#39;s screamingly apparent to the people in the audience. Over and over, the characters encounter unambiguous horrors, and somehow dismiss them. “Haunted?” one character says. “No one has ever seen a ghost here, if that&#39;s what you mean.” Later, she says, “People project their own explanations onto it.

The strange flatness of the characters in these moments arises from the fact that they&#39;re operating in a world where the rules have been set by the departed. Characters can ask &lt;em>;whether&lt;/em>; they should go to Hill House and &lt;em>;why&lt;/em>; they should stay at Hill House and &lt;em>;how&lt;/em>; Hill House works the way it does, but it&#39;s an exercise in futility when they do. Those questions can&#39;t be answered within the novel, because the answer lies outside it, in the requirements of an authorized effort to haunt “The Haunting of Hill House.” Only when the characters take a break from those imponderables can they be free to act within Hand&#39;s imagination—and only then does the book come to life.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Hand has a gift for the sensuous, evocative detail, and her descriptions are often simultaneously seductive and spooky: small, wealthy upstate towns are populated by “people who distilled rare liqueurs from echinacea and comfrey, or made syrup out of white pine needles, or wove intricate rings and brooches from your own hair,” while a character with a flair for the gothic enjoys “psychotropic herbs, Victorian toy theaters, obscure Eastern European horror films, and social media accounts belonging to dead Hollywood starlets.” Hand deploys this descriptive talent to especially strong effect when she evokes Nisa, Holly Sherwin&#39;s girlfriend. Nisa is an actress and a singer; she&#39;s also crafty and duplicitous, eager not just to contribute to the workshopping of Holly&#39;s play but to claw credit away from Holly whenever she can. All the participants in the workshop are prone to moments of sharp-elbowed competition and jealousy, but Nisa in particular is a self-centered nightmare, a crisply drawn near-parody of a theatre kid, given to bursting into song whenever she is not the center of attention. Hungry for success, she continually subjects Holly to the pitiless assessments of the untried young.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Nisa&#39;s casual disregard for boundaries, and her slick contempt for anyone with the temerity to age or fail, make her a genuinely unsettling presence in the house. Shortly after the group arrives at Hill House, Nisa goes rummaging through the belongings of an older actress, appraising her wardrobe, sniffing her perfume, and putting on her lipstick. “Older women shouldn&#39;t wear dark lipstick, anyway,” she thinks, smiling at herself in the mirror and closing the tube. Later, the actress returns to her room and discovers that, mysteriously, the top of the lipstick has been bitten off: “She could clearly see the imprints of tiny teeth—a rat? A mouse? Too small for a person for sure, and who would bite off a lipstick? A child, maybe, but there were no children here.” That rat-like nibbling perfectly encapsulates Nisa&#39;s tiny, needling violations of those around her. The competition between older and younger women, and the high stakes of the battle for control of one&#39;s artistic territory, is a recurring theme in the book. Every time it arises, the story takes on a pleasurable metafictional richness. Hand brilliantly captures the discomfort of someone&#39;s being at once too close and too cruel to a vulnerable artistic project, the sense of violation that arises when someone moves too boldly into your creative space. One can almost hear Hand channelling Jackson&#39;s ghostly whisper, as the young woman blithely appropriates what belongs to the older woman: &lt;em>;What are you doing here&lt;/em>;? &lt;em>;Get out&lt;/em>;.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The authorized novel is far from the only way we try to resurrect the literary dead; adaptations for film and television surely count, too. (Mea culpa.) “The Haunting of Hill House” has been haunted before; five years ago, Netflix aired a very free adaptation of the novel in ten episodes, and previous decades saw two feature-film versions. Still, the stakes are different when a novel inhabits the world of another novel, while aiming to be a wholly freestanding work. That the new novel is tethered to an already cherished one is part of the appeal, and part of the problem. The tether can be a tourniquet.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;This theme takes center stage in the most frightening set piece in Hand&#39;s novel, the answer to the mystery of why Holly&#39;s playwriting career stalled. (All Hand&#39;s characters, it must be said, are burdened with backstory—part of the contortions required to keep them at Hill House.) The story is brief, bizarre, and electric, and almost seems torn from a different book. Jackson&#39;s particular skill was to suggest that, whatever she chose to depict, far darker horrors were lurking beyond the margins of the page. But Hand enjoys showing the monster, and this is the one section where she truly sets herself free.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;As a promising young playwright, we learn, Holly once spent the night with a woman named Macy-Lee, who, drunk, told her a story about sleeping with a ghost: “A real good-looking one . 。 。 real smooth skin, like a polished rock.” Nine months later, she gave birth to a ghost baby: “This slimy gray thing, cold as ice, but . 。 。 pulsing. 。 。 。 all these tiny wriggly fingers were wrapped around a kind of face. Only it had no eyes or nose—it was just a jelly blob with a mouth, and this ropy string attached.” With evident relish, Hand recounts the gruesome details of Macy-Lee&#39;s offspring, as it bites through its own umbilical cord, then slithers off into the woods. The scene itself is a kind of monstrous offspring; unlike the bulk of this mostly well-behaved book, it resembles nothing Jackson would ever have dreamed of writing.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;pgj3tm&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;ah9ff5&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Holly saw Macy-Lee&#39;s story for the brilliant monologue it is. She incorporated it into her play, and achieved overnight success—only for Macy-Lee to return, furious and vengeful, accusing her of exploitation and theft. The resulting scandal derailed Holly&#39;s career: “My long creative silence had been fueled by fear, that I wouldn&#39;t be able to write something as good as that one play—and also a subdued grief. For Macy-Lee, and also for myself, the young artist who&#39;d been so vulnerable, poised for a flight that never came.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;There is a bleakly compassionate acknowledgment here that no matter how much we may crave permission to cross the boundary into someone else&#39;s story, or reassurance that we can retain control over our own, the landscape of writing remains treacherous. Its rules are inchoate. Perfect obedience is impossible, but violation nonetheless results in pain and punishment. In that sense, no novel is ever truly authorized—the control of a story slips from every writer&#39;s hands, if only when her grip is loosened by death. Now that Hill House has joined the canon, some will enter with permission, while others will sneak in uninvited—but writers will always wander in and out of one another&#39;s stories, peering in the mirror, and running their fingers through the accumulated dust. ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;6fd0r6&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 16 Oct 2023 19:06:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“Arts &amp; Sciences,” by Traci Brimhall]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/10/23/arts-and-sciences-traci-brimhall-poem]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-16T10:00:00.000Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5d484da6e96fd10008359362/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/hp-poetryspots6.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;article >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attribute-verso-pattern=&quot;article-body&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;ArticlePageChunks&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;figure data-testid=&quot;IframeEmbed&quot; >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;IframeEmbedContainer&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;iframe height=&quot;60&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; sandbox=&quot;allow-scripts allow-same-origin&quot; title=&quot;Embedded Frame&quot; data-src=&quot;https://www.wnyc.org/widgets/ondemand_player/thenewyorker/#file=https://downloads.newyorker.com/mp3/231023_brimhall_audio.mp3&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay *; encrypted-media *; clipboard-write; autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture&quot;>;&lt;/iframe>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;p>;Read by the author.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;p >; &lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;What if this time I don&#39;t begin with a requiem&lt;br/>;or a memento mori with a split pomegranate&lt;br/>;and a harem of flies?

When you started writing the story, did you have just this premise in mind or did you already know where the story would go?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I took the basic outline of “I Am Pizza Rat” from an unproduced play of mine called “Great Lives,” written in 2016. In the play—which takes its title from the BBC podcast, which is also name-checked in the story—a middle-aged, failed writer moves home to the West Coast from New York City to take care of an ailing father. The father has dementia or Alzheimer&#39;s—it&#39;s not yet clear which; at any rate, it&#39;s his mind that&#39;s failing.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;That outline got me started. Almost all of the elements that followed—the Falling Naturally class, “The Mikado,” the Cameroonian nurse Bun, the son&#39;s pot smoking—were discoveries I made in the process of writing the story.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I should say that “I Am Pizza Rat” is an iteration of a kind of story that I wrote a lot when I was younger, but which I haven&#39;t attempted in many years: a tale of sad sacks. Like the characters of Barbara Pym (one of my two favorite novelists), these are people who are in retrenchment from the Great Flow of Life, and now stand to the side and simply make observations about Life&#39;s Major Characters. The narrator in “I Am Pizza Rat” has an “awakening” late in the story, when his writing ambitions are revived, but till then he&#39;s a pot smoker and a piddler-about.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;The father and the son have a somewhat difficult history together, and they each seem to have ambivalent feelings about the other. And yet the father asked the son to come—and is even paying him to be there, and paying his rent back in New York.为什么？ Was he hoping to improve their relationship? Was he trying to help his son without seeming to?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The father-son relationship in the story is probably a case of “who you&#39;re stuck with” or “the only person who will have you.” That said, it&#39;s interesting for me to discover, as a writer, that so much emotion and depth of feeling can be mined from what are essentially the becalmed energies of a story of rapprochement. When I teach, especially playwriting, I don&#39;t always resist peddling that hoariest of clichés: that a plot requires “conflict.” Though I do a soft-shoe around it by using other terms for what is essentially the same thing: “stress,” “heat,” “the color red,” “a heartbeat.” Still, it&#39;s useful to encourage beginning writers to avoid hemming and hawing, and to get—another hoary cliché—“right to the action.” In light of this, it&#39;s an unexpected pleasure to find that, as a writer, I can move the story many years past the “heat” and “the color red” of a tumultuous father-son relationship and still have vital elements to dramatize.&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;The story has a somewhat grim setup, but is full of humor—a shared humor between son and father (especially when it comes to Gilbert and Sullivan!). They don&#39;t speak a lot, but they communicate. How tough is it to convey the unspoken emotional subcurrents when writing a story like this?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;For me, not very tough. Gruff fathers and recalcitrant sons, grumpy old men and damaged young men: these are recurring characters for me. Even when I was a twentysomething, I was writing about grumpy old men. There are bedraggled, embittered fathers in two early plays of mine: one who deserts his family and is discovered, years later, having hanged himself in a flophouse, in “The Chang Fragments”; and an old Filipino who is traced by his abandoned son to a home for aged Jews, in “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Version-3-0-Contemporary-Asian-American/dp/1559363630&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Version-3-0-Contemporary-Asian-American/dp/1559363630&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Version-3-0-Contemporary-Asian-American/dp/1559363630&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;Swoony Planet&lt;/a>;.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;A note about “The Mikado”: it&#39;s my favorite Gilbert and Sullivan, as it is for the father in the story. For some time, I&#39;d held on to this idea—an Asian-American father and son who unrepentantly love the racially problematic operetta—as the main plot of a short story, but I lacked a second idea against which it would spark; I worried, also, that the subject was too on the nose. But as one small thread in a story, as it is in “I Am Pizza Rat,” I think it works.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;As for the humor, I credit it partly to a &lt;em>;Times&lt;/em>; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/02/world/europe/netherlands-falling-elderly.html&quot;>;article&lt;/a>; about Dutch seniors who are learning the “correct” way to fall, which was the inspiration for the Falling Naturally class in “I Am Pizza Rat.” Because that part of the world ably handles such issues as health care and senior care, the tone of the article was somewhat buoyant, though the subject matter was not. And the seniors profiled in the story were full of good cheer: this was instructive.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;This is the second story you&#39;ve published in the magazine that involves someone taking care of a stubborn, ailing older man. (In the other story, “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/09/13/the-monkey-who-speaks&quot;>;The Monkey Who Speaks&lt;/a>;,” it was a professional home health aide.) What draws you to this situation?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Not long ago, I worked as the assistant to a retired professor, a woman. I accompanied her to various doctors&#39; visits, and, though the term “patient advocate” was never used to describe my duties, I believed I was that for her. I asked the doctors questions about her medications, questions that she sometimes forgot to ask. I wrote notes summarizing what they said so that she could refer to them.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;This experience moved me more than I thought it would.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;Throughout the story, there&#39;s a motif of falling: falling has been the main sign of the father&#39;s failing health; his son takes him to a class on how to fall without hurting himself. Should we read something more metaphorical into that?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;On the one hand, per Samuel Beckett: “No symbols where none intended.” But, on the other, who am I to say, really? Knock yourselves out.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;Why is New York&#39;s infamous &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPXUG8q4jKU&quot;>;Pizza Rat&lt;/a>; in this story? How did a rat pulling a slice of pizza down some subway steps become the title figure in this narrative?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I love Pizza Rat. I &lt;em>;am&lt;/em>; Pizza Rat. There were a few years in the not-too-distant past when I was feeding myself entirely with leftovers from mixers at a university where I was an adjunct and a temp. I would go in with Ziploc bags after these events and shove any food that was available into them. Interestingly enough, a lot of these food items were slices of pizza. But that&#39;s not why I am Pizza Rat. Sometimes inhabiting a character helps me to feel the shamelessness necessary to pull off undesirable tasks. So my mantra on those food-hoarding days was: I am Pizza Rat, I am Pizza Rat. I would recite the line on a loop in my head. And, lo and behold—I didn&#39;t care who saw me walk away with bags of food, because would Pizza Rat care? And when it came time for an analogue and an avatar for the narrator in the story—who has the same underemployed, underpaid life that I did then—who should suggest himself but my old friend Pizza Rat? ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;9ihn98&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;xvmsa9&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 16 Oct 2023 19:06:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Can Happiness Be Taught?]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/10/23/build-the-life-you-want-the-art-and-science-of-getting-happier-oprah-winfrey-and-arthur-c-brooks-book-review]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-16T10:00:00.000Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65270976c259c2065944ab9e/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/231023_r43200web.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;article >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attribute-verso-pattern=&quot;article-body&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;ArticlePageChunks&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;figure data-testid=&quot;IframeEmbed&quot; >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;IframeEmbedContainer&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;iframe height=&quot;90&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; sandbox=&quot;allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups&quot; title=&quot;Embedded Frame&quot; data-src=&quot;https://audm.herokuapp.com/player-embed?pub=newyorker&amp;amp;articleID=652568ddb4c72cac9903c932&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay *; encrypted-media *; clipboard-write; autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture&quot;>;&lt;/iframe>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;p >;Staring into the mirror, on a Tuesday morning, you decide that your self needs all the help it can get. But where to turn? You were reading James Clear&#39;s “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Atomic-Habits-Proven-Build-Break/dp/0735211299/&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Atomic-Habits-Proven-Build-Break/dp/0735211299/&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Atomic-Habits-Proven-Build-Break/dp/0735211299/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;Atomic Habits: An Easy &amp;amp; Proven Way to Build Good Habits &amp;amp; Break Bad Ones&lt;/a>;” and doing well until you spilled half a bottle of Knob Creek over the last sixty pages. Now you&#39;ll never know how it ends. You tried listening to David Goggins&#39;s “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Cant-Hurt-Me-Master-Your/dp/1544512287&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Cant-Hurt-Me-Master-Your/dp/1544512287&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Cant-Hurt-Me-Master-Your/dp/1544512287&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;Can&#39;t Hurt Me: Master Your Mind and Defy the Odds&lt;/a>;,” on Audible, in your car, but so thrilling was Goggins&#39;s prose style that you stomped on the gas and rear-ended a Tesla. Do not despair, though. Succor is at hand. Roosting on Amazon&#39;s best-seller list is “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Build-Life-You-Want-Science/dp/0593545400&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Build-Life-You-Want-Science/dp/0593545400&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Build-Life-You-Want-Science/dp/0593545400&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;Build the Life You Want: The Art and Science of Getting Happier&lt;/a>;,” by Arthur C. Brooks and Oprah Winfrey (Portfolio).&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;At this point, your conscience rebels. By buying a book on Amazon, you tell yourself, you will be directly funding a new angora lining for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tag/jeff-bezos&quot;>;Jeff Bezos&lt;/a>;&#39;s monogrammed slippers in the master bedroom of his private yacht—not the main one but the backup vessel currently moored off Patmos. Quivering with righteousness, you close your laptop and stride to your nearest bookstore, only to bump into a dilemma: whereabouts in the store, exactly, can “Build the Life You Want” be found?&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;It is not an easy volume to place. You&#39;d assume that it belongs on the self-help table. Yet the title suggests home improvement or even civil engineering, and so ardently does Brooks insist on the “four big happiness pillars”—family, friendship, work, and faith—that readers of a nervous disposition may choose to wear a hard hat. On the other hand, Brooks is a professor of management practice at Harvard Business School, so he would slot into the business section with ease. Given that, as he says, “the macronutrients of happiness are enjoyment, satisfaction, and purpose,” there&#39;s an equally strong case for the cookery shelf. Or how about philosophy? Anyone who cites Marcus Aurelius, Thomas Aquinas, Kant, Mick Jagger, Epicurus, &lt;em>;and&lt;/em>; Epictetus, as Brooks does, would be totally stoked to hang out in such lofty company. No one, of course, is loftier than his co-author, and, if your bookstore is furnished with an Oprah wing, that is where the book must be displayed.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;GenericCallout&quot;>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;external-link-embed--inline&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;a aria-label=&quot;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;The Best Books We Read This Week&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.newyorker.com/best-books-2023&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/best-books-2023&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;&lt;span >;&lt;strong>;The Best Books We Read This Week&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/a>;&lt;p >;&lt;em>;Read our reviews of notable new fiction and nonfiction, updated every Wednesday.&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;a aria-label=&quot;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;The Best Books We Read This Week&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.newyorker.com/best-books-2023&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/best-books-2023&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/63c800e4e99d89b838ada996/1:1/w_200%2Cc_limit/undefined&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/63c800e4e99d89b838ada996/1:1/w_120,c_limit/undefined 120w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/a>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;When two writers join forces, it can be tricky to sort out who did what. Not in this case. Brooks is the principal player, and Oprah is his guest star. Only four times does she enter the action to offer “A Note from Oprah,” and the four notes, added together, take up less than fourteen pages in a book that is more than two hundred and forty pages long. What does she bring, then, apart from the humongous commercial clout of her blessing? Well, she reveals that “The Oprah Winfrey Show” was “always at heart a classroom. I was curious about so many things, from the intricacies of the digestive system to the meaning of life.” (Had she been French, of course, those two items would have been the same.) Near the start of the book, ever alert to her audience, she scrunches what she considers Brooks&#39;s most valuable lesson into “words you should tape to your refrigerator,” and, for extra clarity, accelerates into italics: “&lt;em>;Your emotions are only signals. And you get to decide how you&#39;ll respond to them&lt;/em>;.” One more scrunch, and Oprah has the mantra she wants: “&lt;em>;Feel the feel, then take the wheel&lt;/em>;.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;What&#39;s interesting about this advice is that far behind it, dimly discernible, is another speeding vehicle, fuelled by allegorical intent: the chariot drawn by a pair of winged horses and deployed by Socrates, in Plato&#39;s Phaedrus, to illustrate the motions of the soul. One horse, representing our nobler instincts, is “upright in frame and well jointed,” whereas the other is a hell of a nag, “a crooked great jumble of limbs,” forever dragging us down toward the lower desires. All in all, chariot-driving is what Socrates calls “a painfully difficult business,” as is being alive, and the task that Brooks and Oprah set for themselves, in their affable and optimistic fashion, is the age-old one of turning us into better charioteers. Our feelings urge us this way and that, and we should learn when to yank on the reins and when—steady now—to try a touch of the whip.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Whether Brooks has an actual chariot, Massachusetts traffic laws being what they are, I cannot say. Heaven knows what Oprah keeps in her stables. But it&#39;s charming to note the confidence with which Brooks, for one, presents his credentials as a successful whipster. He experimented on his own routines and began teaching a class on happiness at Harvard, not to mention composing a regular column for &lt;em>;The&lt;/em>; &lt;em>;Atlantic&lt;/em>; on the same topic. By his account, “I saw more and more progress in my life.” Onward and upward he flew:&lt;/p>;&lt;blockquote >;&lt;div >;&lt;p>;In the years since I made this life change, my own well-being has risen &lt;em>;a lot&lt;/em>;. People notice and remark that I smile more, and I look like I&#39;m having more fun in my work. My relationships are better than they were.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/blockquote>;&lt;p >;We&#39;re so happy that you&#39;re happy, Professor! Far be it from me to point out that such protestations of improvement, sincere as they are, have a whiff of the travelling salesman—you know, the guy who puts a foot in the door and says, “Believe me, Ma&#39;am, I&#39;ve been using this very same vacuum cleaner in my own home for three months now, and the effect of that heightened suck power is just tremendous. My dust has all but vanished. My carpets look brand new.” To anyone browsing “Build the Life You Want” and books of a similar ilk, it soon becomes clear that the care and maintenance of the self is no longer a branch of the social sciences, if it ever was, or an offshoot of popular psychology. Restructuring your inward being, and increasing its turnover, is now akin to running a company. Personhood, like religion and politics, is a business.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;It doesn&#39;t take long for Brooks to get the business going. He proudly inducts us into the thrill of the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule, or &lt;em >;PANAS&lt;/em>;, which gauges “your natural happy-unhappy mix.” This gives us a list of twenty emotions, such as “6. Guilty 7. Scared 8. Hostile 9. Enthusiastic.” (A perfect guide, as it happens, to the average day of a movie critic.) You note down how keenly you feel the feel, as Oprah would say, grading each emotion for intensity, then calculate your final score. This, in turn, shows where you belong on a pretty diagram, reproduced on page 16 of “Build the Life You Want,” that divides &lt;em>;Homo sapiens&lt;/em>; cleanly into four basic types: Cheerleader, Mad Scientist, Judge, and Poet. Really? Imagine asking J. Robert Oppenheimer to nominate which one of those he thought he was. He would have exploded.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;You&#39;ve got to love the &lt;em >;PANAS&lt;/em>; test. It means almost nothing, yet it gives you the bracing impression that you&#39;re down on the factory floor, tinkering away on the unique machine that is you. It is, to use Oprah&#39;s splendidly honest term, “science-y,” right down to the vague, if benign, laboratory conditions that Brooks dictates. “To take the test, find a time when you feel relatively neutral about life—say, right after lunch,” he writes. But what sort of lunch? If it&#39;s three o&#39;clock in the afternoon and you&#39;re lingering over coffee and gazing out across the Bay of Naples, you will give thanks for the wonders of creation. Conversely, if you just blew seven dollars and twenty-nine cents on a Subway footlong, you will hold your fellow-humans in contempt and assume, naturally, that the world is an overcooked meatball hung in a meaningless void.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Undaunted, Brooks forges onward, and makes further encouraging claims about his methods. Eager to prove that even negative feelings, if shrewdly handled, can have a positive outcome, he ventures into the realms of the book-y. He even gets arts-y on our ass. Quoting a line from Keats&#39;s letters—“Do you not see how necessary a World of Pains and troubles is to school an Intelligence and make it a soul?”—Brooks adds, “Scientists have found that Keats was right.” If only all literary criticism could be as brisk as that. Moreover, according to a study cited by Brooks, “The research found that among great composers like Beethoven, a 37 percent increase in sadness led to, on average, one extra major composition.” That sentence makes me twenty-four per cent less sad, and eighty-one per cent more inclined to giggle, than anything I have read this year.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Brooks is scarcely the first to propose that our happiness, and its opposite, can and should be quantified as precisely as barometric pressure. In “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Principles-Legislation-Philosophical-Classics/dp/0486454525&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Principles-Legislation-Philosophical-Classics/dp/0486454525&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Principles-Legislation-Philosophical-Classics/dp/0486454525&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;An Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation&lt;/a>;” (published, by a murky coincidence, in the year of the French Revolution), the philosopher Jeremy Bentham, clinging fast to his utilitarian creed, devised what came to be known as the felicific calculus. In theory, this allowed you to evaluate any given act in terms of its ensuing pain or pleasure, which could be graded according to various criteria: intensity, duration, certainty, propinquity, fecundity, purity, and extent. In practice, the last of these—which sounds tame, and which refers to the number of people who will be affected by the act—is probably the most morally ticklish, as any secondhand smoker can confirm.&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot;

worth of medical probing behind him, Brooks can boldly go where Bentham was unable to go before and lead us to the particular neighborhoods where pain and pleasure hang out. “Build the Life You Want” plays peekaboo with the reader, affording sneaky little glimpses of the hypothalamus, the insula, and the adrenal glands. Are we genuinely expected to master this material, though, or is it designed purely to reassure us that we are in safe hands? When Brooks, analyzing our reaction to fear, writes, “Your periaqueductal gray, which also receives a note from your amygdala, tells your body to move,” the prosaic image of the note—plucked from our everyday lives—is what sticks and stays. To be told that our internal mail system is like that of a well-run office comes as quite a relief. Then, there is metacognition, a buzzword that hums throughout the book and entails “experiencing your emotions consciously” and “refusing to be controlled by them.” Brooks expounds:&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;hpf0m&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;ojp3gd&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;blockquote >;&lt;div >;&lt;p>;You might compare it to the process of taking petroleum from the well (your limbic system) to a gas refinery (the prefrontal cortex), where it can be made into something you can use purposively.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/blockquote>;&lt;p >;It&#39;s not the greenest analogy I&#39;ve ever seen, but, hey, it does the job. Such is the tactic by which Brooks and the other sovereigns of self-help, with considerable skill and a pinch of cunning, advance their cause. They borrow difficult concepts from the realms of neurology and behavioral science, among others, and couch them in a patois that we recognize. Few of us may have read a paper from a 2013 issue of &lt;em>;Depression and Anxiety&lt;/em>;—think &lt;em>;The World of Interiors&lt;/em>; without the cashmere throws—titled “Reports of Drinking to Self-Medicate Anxiety Symptoms: Longitudinal Assessment for Subgroups of Individuals with Alcohol Dependence.” But Brooks &lt;em>;has&lt;/em>; read it, and has filtered its findings into his thoughts on addiction. (The paper, I couldn&#39;t help noticing, had eleven authors. I trust that they ganged up and got pie-eyed on Zombies to celebrate publication.)&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Homework, though, is not the nub of Brooks&#39;s enterprise. The nub is that he&#39;s required, by the panic-stricken temper of the times, to insist that we can and must get better at being who we are. It could be argued that so positive an outlook is, and always has been, a by-product of any inquiry into the conduct of our earthly existence, although a self-help book by Schopenhauer would, perhaps, flummox more readers than it would assist. On the other hand, if anything yokes together the philosophers cited by Brooks, it is the willingness, or the unavoidable compulsion, to worry away at one moral conundrum after the next, like dogs unearthing a bone to have another go at the marrow. You could spend a lifetime, say, stubbornly chewing on what Aristotle, in the Ethics, means by &lt;em>;eudaemonia&lt;/em>;. “Happiness” alone won&#39;t suffice. Aristotle himself, treading carefully, writes, “We have practically defined happiness as a sort of living and faring well.” I am partial to the modesty of “human flourishing.” Others prefer something like “the activity of a rational soul in accordance with virtue”—a daunting ideal that held sway for twenty-five hundred years, until it was roundly rebuffed by the creators of “Jackass.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Whether there is still a place for the steady intellectual grind is open to question. Readers and publishers alike are worried by all that worrying. Understandably, their quest is for books that promise results, primed to beef up one&#39;s &lt;em>;eudaemonia&lt;/em>; levels like a shot of Vitamin B&lt;sub>;12&lt;/sub>;. Hence the speed with which the mood of Brooks&#39;s book, grammatical and tonal, is set within the title: not “How to Build” but “Build.” Thereafter, the imperative reigns supreme. “Start by working on your toughness.” No sweat. “Take your grand vision of improvement and humble ambition to be part of it in a specific way and execute accordingly.” Check. “Rebel against your shame.” Done. “Widen your conflict-resolution repertoire.” Ka-pow! “Treat your walks, prayer time, and gym sessions as if they were meetings with the president.” Which President? “Journal your experiences and feelings over the course of the day.” Since when did “journal” turn into a transitive verb? “Dig into the extensive and growing technology and literature on mindfulness.” Sorry, I was miles away, what? Above all, “Remember: &lt;em>;You are your own CEO&lt;/em>;.” Holy moly. Do I have to wear a suit to brush my teeth? Is my dog a shareholder? Were last year&#39;s migraines tax-deductible? Can I be fired by me?&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The problem with imperatives is that the more frequent they become, or the more impassioned, the harder it is to obey them and to predict what the fallout from their implementation might be. When Judy Garland, in a tux and black tights, belted out “Get Happy” in “Summer Stock” (1950), you bowed to her command, even if you knew that her life off camera lay in ruins. When she sang the song thirteen years later, on TV, it was intertwined with “Happy Days Are Here Again,” sung by Barbra Streisand, who sat beside her: a rending mashup of two American anthems, delivered at a slow and stricken tempo, as if to acknowledge that the getting of happiness exacted too high a price. And, once it was got, then what?&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;You hear that fear again in the voice of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1975/07/14/cary-grant-profile-pauline-kael&quot;>;Cary Grant&lt;/a>; in “Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House” (1948). He plays an advertising man, hitherto squashed into a small New York apartment with his family, who buys a wreck in Connecticut, has it torn down, puts up a new place, and gets pushed to the brink. “Anybody who builds a house today is crazy. The minute you start, they put you on the list. The All-American Sucker list. You start out to build a home and you wind up in the poorhouse,” he cries. “What about the kids who just got married and want a home of their own? It&#39;s a conspiracy, I tell you, a conspiracy against every boy and girl who were ever in love.” The movie is a light comedy, but, this being Grant, the shadow of desperation is never far away, and what maddens Mr. Blandings is not just the practical chaos and the financial waste but the expense of spirit. He has been sold on his own dream.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I thought of Mr. Blandings often as I plowed through “Build the Life You Want.” Brooks radiates decency and good will; if you yearn to do up your life, like somebody who knocks down a wall and repaints the kitchen, he will lend you the tools. There is almost nothing that he will not undertake to fix. He has a stirring chapter on friendship, for which he has a proper Aristotelian reverence. (Even Bentham, no party animal, recommended “the pleasures of amity.”) So kindly is his disposition, indeed, that he has faith in the gentle resolving of ideological differences. The trick, apparently, is to reserve judgment: “You will find yourself not weighing in on political debates and giving fewer opinions; this will keep you calmer and in a greater state of inner peace.” It&#39;s wonderful to reflect on the millions of people who will heed that advice and maintain a monastic silence as we enter an election year.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Here and there, however, as you browse the book, you catch murmurs of disquiet. They tend to arise in casual comments, such as “Taking negativity personally can lead to rumination.” Heaven forfend! A ruminator on the loose! At other times, a plain recitation of statistics can freak you out, as when Brooks adduces an academic study from 2007:&lt;/p>;&lt;blockquote >;&lt;div >;&lt;p>;The researchers then examined a data set from another study that rated incoming college freshmen&#39;s “cheerfulness” and tracked their income nearly two decades later. They found that the most cheerful in 1976 were not the highest earners in 1995; that distinction once again went to the second-highest group, which rated their cheerfulness as “above average” but not in the highest 10 percent.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/blockquote>;&lt;p >;Where to begin with this? With the assumption that cheerfulness is a measurable quality and that, more to the point, a person is guaranteed to be the most reliable assessor of her or his own cheer? Or with the uncontested idea that a rising income conveys you ever closer to the summum bonum? It might have been pertinent, at this juncture, if Brooks had directed inquisitive readers to the Easterlin paradox—that is, to a controversial paper of 1974, “Does Economic Growth Improve the Human Lot? Some Empirical Evidence,” by the economist Richard A. Easterlin. The link between earnings and contentment, Easterlin claimed, was not as firm as might be expected, especially when one compared a variation in earnings inside a single country with a variation &lt;em>;between&lt;/em>; two separate countries. The fun part came in a chart that laid out the “Personal Happiness Rating” of thirteen nations, as recorded in the late fifties and early sixties. The lucky winners were the United States and Cuba.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;How most of us would rate our personal happiness these days, even without the Bay of Pigs to look forward to, is not something that Arthur C. Brooks and Oprah Winfrey presume to plot on a graph. I suspect, however, that in their view most of us are weltering in a woe of our own devising, and that, unlike Beethoven, we can&#39;t even get a decent symphony out of it. Hence Brooks&#39;s most provoking sentence of all, which is tucked away in parentheses, lest it disturb our equanimity. “(Unhappy people make great consumers),” he writes. And there we arrive at the heart of the matter. “Build the Life You Want” is the pure product of a liberal capitalist democracy: First World fretting, one might say, politely disguised as universal wisdom. It both springs from and speaks to an unmistakable patch of the planet, and, with the aid of muscular marketing and the imprimatur of Oprah, it will be ingested by those whose dolor, to their bewilderment, has been aggravated rather than soothed by mass consumption. “Turn off self-view on Zoom. Don&#39;t take any selfies,” we read, in this rousing hymn to self-help. Round and round we go. ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;qozs89&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 16 Oct 2023 19:06:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[What the Tokyo Trial Reveals About Empire, Memory, and Judgment]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/10/23/judgment-at-tokyo-world-war-ii-on-trial-and-the-making-of-modern-asia-gary-j-bass-book-review]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-16T10:00:00.000Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6525d47b3d0ece5bcea23d75/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/231023_r43201.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;article >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attribute-verso-pattern=&quot;article-body&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;ArticlePageChunks&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;In Nuremberg, in the fall of 1945, twenty-two high-ranking Nazis were put on trial before a group of judges from Allied nations. A year later, twelve of the defendants were sentenced to be hanged, and seven received prison sentences. Few people, even in Germany, felt particularly sorry for the condemned men, who had caused so much death and destruction all over Europe. But there were reservations about a trial in which the victors prosecuted the vanquished. Winston Churchill, for one, would have preferred to shoot the Nazi leaders and be done with it. (Stalin thought that killing fifty thousand Germans might do; even Churchill was a little put out by that.)&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Instead, the London Charter was created to try the top Nazis for crimes against humanity (a new concept) and crimes against peace (another new idea), along with conventional war crimes. Crimes against humanity meant murder, extermination, enslavement, and other such acts against a civilian population, or persecution on religious or racial grounds. Planning and waging a war of aggression counted as crimes against peace. The aim in creating these laws was to set norms for the future. But critics of the Nuremberg proceedings quickly objected to the use of retroactive justice—punishment by laws that hadn&#39;t existed when the crimes were committed. They also noted that, before Nuremberg, political leaders had not been held personally responsible for acts of state, however cruel and aggressive they may have been.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Hypocrisy was another issue raised by critics. German leaders were accused of killing large numbers of defenseless civilians, but what about the eradication of entire cities by Allied bombing? And how was one of Stalin&#39;s hanging judges, who presided over some of the bloodiest Soviet show trials, entitled to try Germans for crimes against humanity?&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;GenericCallout&quot;>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;external-link-embed--inline&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;a aria-label=&quot;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;The Best Books We Read This Week&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.newyorker.com/best-books-2023&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/best-books-2023&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;&lt;span >;&lt;strong>;The Best Books We Read This Week&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/a>;&lt;p >;&lt;em>;Read our reviews of notable new fiction and nonfiction, updated every Wednesday.&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;a aria-label=&quot;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;The Best Books We Read This Week&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.newyorker.com/best-books-2023&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/best-books-2023&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/63c800e4e99d89b838ada996/1:1/w_200%2Cc_limit/undefined&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/63c800e4e99d89b838ada996/1:1/w_120,c_limit/undefined 120w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/a>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;If the Nuremberg trial was questionable in some respects, the trial of Japanese wartime leaders in Tokyo (which resulted in seven men hanged, sixteen imprisoned) was far more dubious. John Dower, the finest American historian of modern Japan, called the Tokyo trial “a murky reflection of its German counterpart.” On a visit to Japan in 1946, the eminent US diplomat George Kennan dismissed the proceedings as “political trials.” Charles Willoughby, General Douglas MacArthur&#39;s intelligence chief in Tokyo, thought that the proceedings were “the worst hypocrisy in recorded history.” And Radhabinod Pal, the trial&#39;s Indian judge, didn&#39;t think that any of the defendants should be found guilty, because he viewed a trial conducted mostly by representatives of colonial powers as illegitimate.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The International Military Tribunal for the Far East, as the Tokyo trial was officially called, lasted longer than the trial in Nuremberg—it stretched from May, 1946, to November, 1948—and was on a far grander scale. Where the Nuremberg judges came from four countries, the Tokyo judges came from eleven: the United States, Canada, Australia, the United Kingdom, China, the Philippines, the Netherlands, France, New Zealand, India, and the Soviet Union. The Tokyo trial was also more of an American affair than the tribunal in Germany had been. Japan was under Allied occupation until 1952, but control was almost entirely in the hands of General MacArthur, the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers (&lt;em >;SCAP&lt;/em>;). And, if the ferocious Allied destruction of German cities was a point to be skirted in Nuremberg, the nuclear bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, not to mention the incendiary bombing of many other Japanese cities, cast even greater doubt on the legitimacy of Allied judgment of Japanese war crimes.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Illegitimate or not, as Gary J. Bass points out in his exhaustive and fascinating book “Judgment at Tokyo: World War II on Trial and the Making of Modern Asia” (Knopf), the Tokyo trial had serious consequences that continue to play out to this day. Placing the trial firmly in the context of colonialism, racial attitudes, the Cold War, and post-colonial Asian politics, Bass argues, quite rightly, that the trial “reveals some of the reasons why a liberal international order has not emerged in Asia.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;It is impossible to imagine a mainstream German politician openly disparaging the Nuremberg trial as mere foreign propaganda, or paying tribute to convicted war criminals in a place of worship. Yet several Japanese Prime Ministers have done just that with regard to the Tokyo trial. The late Shinzo Abe, for example, prayed at the imperialist Yasukuni Shrine, in Tokyo, where major war criminals are glorified and monuments set among elegant gardens honor such notorious wartime organizations as the Kempeitai, the rough Japanese equivalent of the Gestapo. One reason Abe and some of his predecessors have done so—provoking Japanese liberals as much as other Asians—is their desire to overturn what right-wing nationalists like to call the “Tokyo-trial version of history.” They believe that Allied propagandists, and the Japanese leftists who parroted them, imposed a “masochistic” view of the past on Japan, and unfairly accused the country of waging an aggressive war and committing worse atrocities than other nations.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;The version of history offered by the Tokyo trial &lt;em>;was&lt;/em>; a little skewed. The proceedings followed the example of Nuremberg, as though the war waged by Japan had been an Asian mirror image of that waged by Germany. Indeed, many Westerners at the time thought that the Japanese were even worse than the Nazis. Racial prejudice had something to do with this belief. Bass quotes an Australian newspaper: “The Jap has not a soul to think in terms of decency.” But the attack on Pearl Harbor also contributed, as did the treatment of Western prisoners of war, which was more severe than the usual German handling of POWs (as long as they weren&#39;t Soviet soldiers). Bass quotes some startling statistics. In 1944, a third of Americans wanted Japan to be “destroyed as a political entity”; thirteen per cent thought all Japanese people should be killed.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;These were just the views of ordinary Americans responding to opinion polls. Henry L. Stimson—the wartime US War Secretary, who had blocked Jewish refugees from coming to the United States as late as 1944 and who, after the war, saw no reason to prosecute the Nazis for what they had done inside Germany—was appalled by the “horrible pictures of the way the Japanese are treating our poor Air Force boys when they get hold of them.” These boys, of course, had been killing hundreds of thousands of Japanese civilians from the air. General MacArthur, meanwhile, wanted the Tokyo trial to deal only with Pearl Harbor, and not with Japan&#39;s far greater war crimes committed against other Asians, especially the Chinese.&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot;

There was no Japanese equivalent of the Nazi Party, and no dictator like Hitler. Koki Hirota (who was sentenced to death by hanging), Shigenori Togo (twenty years in prison), and Mamoru Shigemitsu (seven years) were neither fanatics nor thugs but civilian politicians who served in a number of governments that were more and more dominated by military men. All three—Hirota as Prime Minister and foreign minister, Togo and Shigemitsu as foreign ministers—had tried at different times to stop the militarists from going to war.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;They failed. But the prosecutors&#39; allegation that these men were part of a “conspiracy to wage a war of aggression” was never plausible. There were too many disagreements inside various Japanese cabinets for that. Conspiracy to commit a crime, in any case, wasn&#39;t a Japanese judicial concept; it was a peculiarly Anglo-American one.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;tyjpxg&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;brizt&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Many of the military leaders on trial were belligerent. General Hideki Tojo (hanged) certainly was. And they were unable or unwilling to stop their troops from raping and murdering countless civilians. Tojo also ordered POWs to do hard labor, which often killed them. Torture—especially at the hands of the dreaded Kempeitai, whose leaders, oddly enough, were not tried in Tokyo—was routinely practiced all over the Japanese Empire. But the defendants in Tokyo had not been driven by a genocidal ideology. Many of them may have been warmongers, but they weren&#39;t Nazis.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;As latecomers to the imperialist game, the Japanese had been fighting wars on the Asian continent since 1894. They colonized Korea, Taiwan, and islands in the South Pacific; conquered Manchuria (now northeast China) in 1931 and set it up as a puppet state; and invaded the rest of China in 1937. Much of this was done in the spirit of defensive jingoism. Japan wanted to protect what it saw as its legitimate interests in Asia by building its own empire, one that both opposed Western empires in the region and mimicked them. This Japanese enterprise was often vicious, frequently dishonest, and ultimately disastrous, but it was essentially an imperialist war, and did not include a systematic and ideological program of extermination.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Still, Bass is right to keep returning to the question of race. Tojo, who served as Japan&#39;s Prime Minister from 1941 to 1944, believed that his country needed to liberate Asians from Western imperialism and spread its “superior” culture “all over the world.” It was a brutal liberation that most Asians didn&#39;t much appreciate. But the Japanese leaders, Tojo among them, defended their mission by claiming to be fighting against white supremacy. In 1919, the Japanese demand for racial equality in the Covenant of the League of Nations had been denied. Some two decades later, Japan, in the view of Tojo and others, was forced into a war with the West—the invasion of China was harder to justify—because Western imperial powers had conspired against Japanese interests, cutting the country off from oil and other vital supplies. At the same time, the president of Japan&#39;s privy council warned the militarists against a war with the West, lest such a venture unite the Europeans and the Americans in a common “hatred of the yellow race.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Some anti-colonial Asian leaders in the nineteen-forties—including José Laurel in the Philippines and Sukarno in the Dutch East Indies—were prepared to view the Japanese as liberators and hoped that collaboration with Japan would rid them of their Western masters. It did, in the end, but not before Asians suffered a great many horrors at Japanese hands. Two of the three Asian judges on the Tokyo tribunal—Delfin Jaranilla, from the Philippines, and Mei Ruao, from China—were, Bass points out, harsher on the Japanese than the Western judges were. That shouldn&#39;t have been surprising, since Mei had suffered from Japanese bombing in Chongqing, the last wartime Chinese capital, and Jaranilla had been in the Bataan Death March, in 1942, which claimed the lives of as many as eighteen thousand Filipinos.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Justice Pal, on the other hand, an eloquent Bengali intellectual who had become a respected lawyer under the British Raj, agreed with Tojo and his colleagues in the dock in finding the idea of a Japanese conspiracy “preposterous.” Pal claimed that his fellow-judges from the West had a “bias created by racial or political factors.” Japan had been right to feel threatened in the nineteen-thirties, he thought, “with Nationalist China, Soviet Russia, and the race-conscious English-speaking peoples of the Pacific closing in on her.” And if Japanese education and propaganda had been a little racist, too, well: “I cannot condemn those of the Japanese leaders who might have thought of protecting their race by inculcating their racial superiority in the youthful mind.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;No wonder, then, that Justice Pal should have a monument all to himself at Yasukuni Shrine, bearing the words “When Time shall have softened passion and prejudice, when Reason shall have stripped the mask from misrepresentation, then Justice, holding evenly her scales, will require much of past censure and praise to change places.” Few of the Japanese nationalists who go to the shrine to pay their respects to the Indian judge will recognize that these words were spoken originally by Jefferson Davis, the Confederate leader, who mourned the lost cause of slavery.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Are the Japanese nationalists right? Was the Tokyo trial just a hypocritical piece of Western propaganda, taken up by Japanese leftists? The truth is far more complicated. Western bias can safely be assumed, since the trial was decided upon by the US and dominated by judges from the British Empire. The chief judge was an Australian, the chief prosecutor an American, and, aside from Jaranilla, Mei, and Pal, the judges representing Asian peoples were Dutch, British, and French. The Koreans, who had suffered from Japanese aggression longer than any other people, had no judge at all.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Nor is it a stretch to think that a sense of wounded imperialism might have colored the perspective of some of the European judges. Although Bass overstates the case when he says that Britain&#39;s postwar Labour government “embraced imperialism”—the independence of India and Burma, at least, had its approval—there&#39;s no doubt that the Prime Minister, Clement Attlee, and the Foreign Secretary, Ernest Bevin, still had an exalted view of British power in the world, which they sought to preserve through the Commonwealth, and through a global network of military bases. The Japanese invasions of European colonies were clearly experienced as a humiliation. Publicly abasing Western POWs had been a deliberate Japanese tactic to show other Asians how low the white man could be brought down, and to promote the mission of restoring Asia to Asians.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The legacy of the tribunal was certainly muddled by the lack of consensus among the judges about the legitimacy of the charges. Justice Pal was not the only one to challenge the idea of conspiracy to wage war. The charge of crimes against peace had been justified in Nuremberg by various prewar agreements to proscribe war, such as the Kellogg-Briand Pact of 1928. (In the wake of the First World War, the French foreign minister, Aristide Briand, suggested a Franco-US agreement to outlaw war between the two nations. When his US counterpart, Frank B. Kellogg, showed little interest in a bilateral arrangement, the idea was expanded to include most of the countries in the world, including Japan.) But international agreements are not criminal laws. Even the Australian jurist William Webb, the tribunal&#39;s chief judge, admitted that “international law, unlike the laws of many countries, does not expressly include a crime of naked conspiracy,” and that the creation of this crime was “nothing short of judicial legislation.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Natural law, based on religious and legal philosophies associated with such figures as the seventeenth-century Dutch statesman and jurist Hugo Grotius—and systematized earlier by Thomas Aquinas—was also invoked to condemn the Japanese. The Dutch judge, Bert Röling, was among those who dissented from the tribunal&#39;s rulings (much to the alarm of his government in The Hague), and he pointedly took issue with the effort to enlist natural law. Fully conscious of the Dutch colonial record in Asia, he wrote, “I hesitate to approach the Far East in our effort to determine the criminality of aggression with quotations from idealists and philosophers of the very period when our heroes and soldiers were conquering its territories in what could hardly be called a defensive war.” Röling wanted to limit the trial to conventional war crimes and crimes against humanity.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;e93ohn&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Meanwhile, Joseph Keenan, the American chief prosecutor, was prone to sonorous absurdities. He claimed that the Japanese aggressors had invaded countries in Asia intending to “destroy democracy and its essential basis—freedom and the respect of human personality.” These countries in Asia were, of course, European and US colonies. That Keenan was often drunk is no excuse. Even Asians who had loathed their Japanese oppressors would have been astonished by this delusional flourish of American idealism.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The Asian judges, apart from Pal, had no doubts about the court&#39;s jurisdiction. Bass is especially good on Mei, the Chinese judge, to whom too little attention has been paid in other books on the Tokyo trial. A man of considerable learning who had studied at Stanford University, Mei was perhaps the least cynical of the judges. He truly believed that the trial would create a more peaceful and democratic world order, and had the thankless task of promoting this idea even as his Nationalist government was being quickly overwhelmed by Mao Zedong&#39;s Communist revolutionaries. He also did his best to focus attention on Japanese atrocities in China. If MacArthur thought the attack on Pearl Harbor was a murderous war crime, Chinese claims were far more persuasive: as many as twenty million Chinese died in the war between 1937 and 1945.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The retreating Japanese had destroyed most of the documents attesting to their actions, but there was nonetheless sufficient evidence to shock Japanese public opinion. Various witnesses gave accounts of what they saw when the Nationalist capital, Nanjing, was ransacked in the course of six weeks in 1937 by Japanese Imperial Army troops, who raped countless women and killed tens of thousands and possibly even hundreds of thousands of people. A Japanese Army document produced at the trial showed that superior officers had either encouraged or ignored these crimes. “In the battlefield we think nothing of rape,” one soldier said. Chinese POWs were lined up and “killed to test the efficiency of the machine gun,” another recalled.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;The Japanese press reported these horrors at length, but Mei&#39;s noble intention to establish a thorough historical record of Japan&#39;s crimes was further hampered by the civil war in China. The Nationalist generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek tended to see trials against Japanese war criminals as a distraction from his struggle against the Communists. He even employed one of the most ruthless Japanese generals as his military adviser. The massacres perpetrated by this particular general had been directed mostly at Communist guerrillas, which didn&#39;t especially concern Chiang. The Communists, in turn, didn&#39;t bother much about the Nanjing Massacre until decades later, because its victims were governed by the Nationalists.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Other Japanese crimes were ignored at the Tokyo trial for equally cynical reasons. Japanese doctors and scientists in the notorious Unit 731, which was in charge of biological and chemical warfare, had conducted hideous experiments on Chinese and Russian prisoners, and deliberately infected large numbers of Chinese with fatal diseases, such as bubonic plague, just to see what would happen. The leader of this unit, Shiro Ishii, and his team received immunity from the Americans in exchange for their data, which were thought to be useful. Quite how useful the data proved has never been divulged.&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;a data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a25695&amp;quot;}&quot;

The wide-scale rape of local women had become a headache for the Army, since it provoked greater anti-Japanese resistance. To mitigate this problem, so-called comfort women were tricked or kidnapped and made to service Japanese soldiers. But their suffering wasn&#39;t on anyone&#39;s agenda in 1946. This enormity would become a serious issue only much later.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The extent to which the defendants in the Tokyo trial were personally responsible for the crimes in China, or in other parts of Asia, was hard to prove, so they were convicted for their failure to stop those crimes. But in the end it wasn&#39;t the Western powers that came down hardest on the Japanese. Justice Mei thought the final judgment had been too soft in some respects. The Chinese Communists were outraged that Tojo and other defendants had been allowed to make self-justifying speeches in court and to be defended by able US lawyers. The &lt;em>;People&#39;s Daily&lt;/em>; thundered, “MacArthur&#39;s protection and indulgence is the real reason why war criminals such as Tojo dare to be so arrogant.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In one important respect, the “Tokyo-trial version of history” was indeed utterly remiss. Emperor Hirohito, whose name was on many incriminating documents, was, for political reasons, neither prosecuted nor even called as a witness. When Tojo inadvertently let it slip that “no Japanese subject would go against the will of His Majesty,” he was swiftly reminded not to implicate the Emperor and stated that the Emperor had never had anything but peaceful intentions.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;MacArthur, as well as his advisers, decided in 1945 that if the Emperor did not remain on his throne there would be a nationwide revolt that would upset &lt;em >;SCAP&lt;/em>;&#39;s administration. Only a few days after the formal Japanese surrender, as Bass writes, “both the American occupiers and the Japanese authorities converged on a common line: the imperial court, so useful for a peaceful occupation, was not to be blamed for the war.” Bass might have stressed, however, that this was the view of MacArthur&#39;s most conservative advisers and the most reactionary Japanese authorities, and that many Japanese, including some of Hirohito&#39;s closest relatives, thought he should at least abdicate. It was the Americans who quashed that idea from the beginning.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Bass describes some of the rifts in the US Administration, in Tokyo as well as in Washington, DC At almost nine hundred pages, his book is already very long—“necessarily so,” in his opinion—but on the politics swirling around MacArthur&#39;s court he could have said more. There were New Dealers in his entourage who wanted a more radical transformation of Japan than did more conservative figures such as Henry Stimson, George Kennan, and Joseph Grew, the former Ambassador to Japan. Some of the conservatives around MacArthur were rather disreputable, to put it mildly. General Willoughby, his intelligence chief, born in Germany as Adolf Karl Weidenbach, was an admirer of Mussolini. MacArthur called Willoughby “my pet fascist.” The intelligence chief, who arranged for the protection of Shiro Ishii, from Unit 731, found allies among Japanese right-wingers, including some influential figures who had been arrested for war crimes and who sought to shape Japan according to their political wishes.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Bass calls the New Dealers “retributive” and “maximalist.” That&#39;s a little unfair; they were convinced that there was enough Japanese enthusiasm for civic rights to establish a more liberal democracy than had existed before, and to a large degree they were right. That Grew, Kennan, Stimson, and Willoughby were skeptical of the prospects for such a liberal democracy was partly a matter of cultural or racial prejudice. In Stimson&#39;s view, the Japanese were “an oriental people with an oriental mind and religion,” and thus incapable of governing themselves. Attempts to democratize Japan, in his view, would end up making “a hash of it.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;MacArthur himself, a martinet and a staunch Republican, was torn between his New Dealers and the conservatives. He compared the Japanese to “a boy of twelve” in terms of the “standards of modern civilization.” But he also had a rather grandiose idea of what he saw as his historic mission to establish a Christian democracy in Japan. This resulted in a liberal constitution, trade unions, land reforms, a free press, and women&#39;s suffrage, all of which were welcomed by most of the Japanese population. In the late nineteen-forties, however, when the Communists were winning in China and the Cold War was warming up, the right-wing, anti-Communist views of people such as Willoughby gained strength. “Reds” in government jobs, trade unions, universities, and other institutions were purged. But almost all the men who had been indicted for war crimes were released as soon as the Tokyo trial was over, in 1948. One of them was Nobusuke Kishi, the wartime vice-minister of munitions and Shinzo Abe&#39;s grandfather, who escaped a prison sentence and became Prime Minister in 1957.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;nop3k&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;45ffnu&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;In short, the kind of Japanese who objected to the “Tokyo-trial version of history” soon returned to power with active American assistance, including large amounts of American cash that flowed into conservative coffers well into the nineteen-sixties. Some of the work of the New Dealers and the Japanese liberals was undone. There were no further efforts to hold the Japanese to account for waging aggressive wars and committing war crimes across Asia. Still, there was at least one aspect of the postwar Japanese constitution, written by American idealists, that could not be revised, and that was Article 9, whereby Japan was to “renounce war as a sovereign right of the nation and the threat or use of force as means of settling international disputes.” This was simply too popular in Japan to touch.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;But the right-wing nationalists—and, indeed, many American conservatives, such as Richard Nixon—deplored Article 9 as a big mistake. The nationalists continue to see Article 9 as a humiliating assault on Japanese sovereignty, while their liberal opponents continue to see pacifism as a necessary lesson to be drawn from Japan&#39;s dismal wartime record. As a result of this conflict, views on Japan&#39;s modern history have become hopelessly tangled up with postwar politics. The more liberals point to the Nanjing Massacre, or the destruction of Japan itself, as a warning not to change the constitution, the more nationalists wish to deny that there ever was such a massacre in Nanjing, or that Japan did anything to be particularly ashamed of. This has greatly muddled Japanese foreign policy, especially in Asia. Every time Japanese leaders issue formal apologies for Japan&#39;s dark past in other Asian countries, their efforts are undercut by right-wing politicians making a show of visiting the Yasukuni Shrine, or insisting that school textbooks should be more patriotic and omit references to the Nanjing Massacre and other war crimes.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;This is embarrassing, and makes it easier for China to stir up anti-Japanese sentiment. South Korea—given the increasing belligerence it faces from China, as well as from North Korea—should be a close ally of Japan&#39;s. But relations between the two countries remain troubled by Japanese right-wing denials that Korean women were forced to work in Japanese military brothels. Indeed, Japan&#39;s unresolved issues with the “Tokyo-trial version of history” get to the heart of what Bass identifies as the country&#39;s greatest dilemma today.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Japan&#39;s constitutional pacifism has always been predicated on the understanding that the US would guarantee its security. Amid an increasingly hostile environment and an erratic American politics (Donald Trump), growing numbers of Japanese believe that a constitutional revision should now at least be seriously discussed, so that Japan can do more to defend itself and its neighbors. But neither Japan&#39;s allies in South Korea and Southeast Asia nor its liberals at home will be reassured by such a move as long as the country&#39;s conservative leaders refuse to face up to its past, and seek to appeal the verdict of history. ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;kdnys&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot;

Politics newsletter.&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>;&lt;hr />;&lt;p >;When Rodrigo Duterte ran for the Presidency of the Philippines and won, in 2016, the Western press noted the similarities between this unconventional candidate and Donald Trump—who also liked to casually espouse violence on the campaign trail and beyond. Duterte used provocative and obscene language to tap into the country&#39;s fears about a real, albeit overstated, drug problem. “Every drug addict was a schizophrenic, hallucinatory, will rape your mother and butcher your father,” as the reporter Patricia Evangelista puts it, “and if he can&#39;t find a child to rape, he&#39;ll rape a goat.” But, unlike Donald Trump, Duterte made good on his promise of death. More than twenty thousand extrajudicial killings took place over the course of his six-year term in office, according to human-rights groups—and Duterte remained quite popular as bodies piled up in the streets. Reporting for the news site Rappler, Evangelista confronted the collateral damage when Durterte started to enact his “kill them all” policies. “I had to take accountability,” she tells David Remnick. Her book, “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Some-People-Need-Killing-Country/dp/0593133137&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Some-People-Need-Killing-Country/dp/0593133137&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Some-People-Need-Killing-Country/dp/0593133137&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;Some People Need Killing&lt;/a>;,” is published in the US this week, and Evangelista has left the Philippines because of the danger it puts her in. “I own the guilt,” Evangelista says. “How can I sit in New York, when the people whose stories I told, who took the risk to tell me their stories, are sitting in shanties across the country and might be at risk because of things they told me?”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;cujcx&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;jziow9&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 16 Oct 2023 19:06:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Daniel Clowes’s “Quiet Luxury”]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cover-story/cover-story-2023-10-23]]><description>&lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-16T10:00:00.000Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6529887c5a34a665fde30de4/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/cover-story-promo-clowes_money.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;article >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attribute-verso-pattern=&quot;article-body&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;ArticlePageChunks&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p>;For the cover of the Money Issue, the cartoonist Daniel Clowes evokes the lavish, concentrated wealth that governs our world. The true billionaires, rich beyond comprehension, hardly need to flaunt their affluence; Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos, for example, seem more devoted to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/09/18/elon-musk-walter-isaacson-book-review&quot;>;amassing power&lt;/a>; than to amassing stuff. Then again, billions of dollars—a nearly unimaginable sum—can buy more caviar and chandeliers than one person could possibly enjoy: why not &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/08/28/elon-musks-shadow-rule&quot;>;build a fleet of satellites instead&lt;/a>;? Meanwhile, former President Donald Trump, who has built his reputation upon ostentatious displays of fame and fortune, is being challenged in court &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/26/nyregion/trump-james-fraud-trial.html&quot;>;for inflating the value of his net worth&lt;/a>;. Money talks, but real money doesn&#39;t need to shout. For the October 23, 2023, issue, I talked to the cover artist about his new graphic novel, “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Monica-Daniel-Clowes/dp/1683968824/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=monica+clowes&amp;amp;qid=1697216967&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;sr=1-1&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Monica-Daniel-Clowes/dp/1683968824/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=monica+clowes&amp;amp;qid=1697216967&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;sr=1-1&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Monica-Daniel-Clowes/dp/1683968824/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=monica+clowes&amp;amp;qid=1697216967&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;sr=1-1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;Monica&lt;/a>;,” his thoughts about wealth, and the distorting influence of unfathomable riches.&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;Even though this image isn&#39;t based on any real living persons, did you have to do any research for it?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;To get started, I did a few image searches using terms like “ornate” and “filigree,” along with phrases like “world&#39;s most valuable cufflinks” and “horror vacui.” I found a few interesting results: for some reason, in-home pillars seem to be a good indicator of extreme wealth.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;What was your relationship to the idea of wealth when you were growing up, and has it evolved since?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I never knew any really wealthy people growing up, so my entire notion of how they lived came from “The Beverly Hillbillies” and the “Richie Rich” comics. As an adult, I&#39;ve had a few occasions to be in a room with rich people, while someone begged them for money to fund a movie or a museum show. I always find myself thinking that they could probably have me thrown in a dungeon or hunted for sport, and so I&#39;d better be on my best behavior.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;If you had a billion dollars, how would you make use of it?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;How dare you assume I don&#39;t already have a billion dollars!&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;You might as well ask me what I&#39;d do with some magic beans; I have no idea. All of us like to imagine we&#39;d feed the poor or fund initiatives to fight climate change, but when the money appears we wind up buying spaceships and starting private militias. I already have a shaky sense of self, and can&#39;t even imagine how profoundly something like that would rewire my brain.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;You&#39;re currently on a tour for your new book, “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/monica-a-guided-tour-through-daniel-clowess-mind-and-library&quot;>;Monica&lt;/a>;.” What are the best parts of the experience?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;The best part, as hokey as it may sound, is getting to meet the actual people who buy and read these books.
