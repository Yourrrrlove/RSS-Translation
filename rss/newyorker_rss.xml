aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;另一个风险因素是随着利率上升最终导致金融崩溃的可能性。 S.&amp;amp; P.500 指数的交易价格比大流行前的水平高出约三分之一，比 2020 年 3 月的低点高出百分之九十以上。最近几周，美联储无法控制的长期利率急剧上升。这一事态发展可能会给银行，特别是地区银行带来新的压力，这些银行持有大量国债，随着长期利率上升，这些证券的价值会下降。然后是商业房地产市场，向远程工作的转变在许多城市严重损害了商业房地产市场。&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;鲍威尔表示，美联储对地区银行的担忧保持警惕，他认为商业房地产的损失不会“带来更广泛的问题”。他更广泛的信息是，他和他的同事正在采取观察简报，这意味着他们不太可能在两周后的下一次会议上改变利率。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;美联储主席还强调，他所面临的政策挑战他和他的同事们面临的是经济实力增强而非经济疲软的后果。他指出，疫情发生以来，美国经济增速位居主要经济体之首，目前已回到疫情前的轨道。一年半多以来，失业率一直低于百分之四。而这一切都是在通货膨胀率大幅下降的情况下发生的。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;为什么这个成功故事没有反映在拜登的支持率中？部分原因是政治两极分化的结果。全国大约有三分之一甚至更多的人不会相信他的任何功劳。第二个影响因素可能是过去一年中有关可能出现经济衰退的所有媒体报道，但这种情况从未成为现实。现在，许多经济学家正忙着上调他们的增长预测，但这并没有引起媒体的足够关注。然后是挥之不去的价格冲击。尽管过去一年物价上涨速度大幅下降，但许多商品的实际价格仍远高于疫情前的水平。经过一代人的价格稳定，消费者还没有习惯。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;理论上，鲍威尔不必担心政治。然而，明年是选举年，美联储肯定更愿意在竞选期间远离聚光灯。考虑到政策紧缩何时结束的所有不确定性，以及如果无限期地保持高利率，真正可能导致问题的可能性，这次低调似乎不太可能是一个选择。 ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot;

p>;“听到外面恐怖分子的声音。”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/blockquote>;&lt;p>;科恩后来问一位朋友袭击者是什么样子。 “就像他们刚从健身房出来一样。他们的眼睛里充满了疯狂的喜悦，就像他们对某件事感到兴奋一样，”他被告知。哈马斯领导的部队挨家挨户地行动，谋杀居民或将他们扣为人质。&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;距离科恩的家只有几分钟路程房子里，一个长着娃娃脸的二十四岁男孩丹·阿隆和他的父母和兄弟一起蹲在他们自己的安全房间里。他回忆说，他们“没有电，天气很热，没有水，几乎没有空气”。几个小时过去了。然后他听到“真主至大”的呼喊声越来越近：武装分子就在他的房子里。很快，阿隆就听到有人敲安全室的门。当入侵者反击时，阿隆、他的兄弟和他们的父亲用力抵住门框。 “这是我们一生中最难忘的一场战争，”他回忆起父亲说的一句话。在他看来，过了几个小时之后，武装分子就撤退了。房间里充满了宽慰。但随后，阿隆说，他听到了“大火的呼啸声”。钢门摸起来很烫，而且越来越烫。这是武装分子使用的一种方法的一部分，事实证明，这种方法非常有效：当他们遇到打不开的安全室门时，他们会烧毁备用轮胎并将其推入室内，常常迫使家人逃离。阿隆和他的家人抓起放在房间里的毛巾，轮流在上面撒尿。然后他们将毛巾铺在地板上以阻挡火焰。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“不知何故，不知何故，火停了，”阿隆说。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;其他家庭就没那么幸运了。当房屋被烧毁时，许多人决定跳窗逃生。一对夫妇，Rinat 和 Chen Even，带着四个孩子从二楼跳下。他们安全着陆并躲进灌木丛中，但武装分子却埋伏在那里等待。这对夫妇和他们的两个十几岁的男孩被枪杀。他们用自己的身体保护了两个最小的孩子，他们设法活了下来。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;科恩听到了这两个孩子的哭声，并被他们所困扰。 “那些跳出来的人要么被杀，要么被扣为人质，”他告诉我。 “这都是有预谋的。”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot;

aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;&lt;p>;到那个星期六中午，托马斯·汉德已经决定，如果哈马斯枪手来抓他，他们不会发现他躲藏起来。六十三岁的汉德瘦瘦的，姜黄色的胡茬已经花白了。他出生于爱尔兰，1992 年抵达贝埃里三个月，“从那时起就一直住在这里，”他本周告诉我。农场生活适合他。他爱上了一个基布兹尼克女人。这对夫妇有两个孩子，虽然他们后来分居了，但汉德留下来，在印刷厂找到了一份工作。八年前，他第三次成为父亲，在女儿艾米丽的母亲因癌症去世后，他独自抚养女儿。&lt;​​/p>;&lt;p>;袭击当天，汉德独自在家。艾米丽在朋友家过夜，汉德无法联系到她。他给前妻打了电话。 “进入安全室，如果你听到他们的声音，请用双手握住门把手，”他告诉她。然后他拧开厨房窗户上的蚊帐，抓起他的9毫米手枪。 “我将一颗子弹放入弹膛，然后将其从安全处取出，这是你永远不会做的，”他说。 “我知道他们会抓住我，但至少我会干掉一些。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;他把枪指向外面，肘部放在厨房柜台上，凝视着窗外，等待着。他的整个身体都在颤抖。和科恩一样，他也收到短信：“军队在哪里？” “这已经是几个小时了！” “他们在我家里。”电力很快就断了——武装分子切断了电线。九个小时过去了。汉德一直认为他和艾米丽那时可能已经到达海法了。&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;有一次，他听到了一声微弱的刮擦声。他前妻的杜宾犬在他家门口大声叫嚷。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“炸肉排！”手向狗喊了一声，感谢它的陪伴。然后他意识到这不是一个好兆头。她绝不会允许狗离开安全室。&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot;

>;&lt;/div>; &lt;p>;另一个电话来自一个侄子，他当时正在沙漠里参加一场狂欢，当时有数十名枪手&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/dispatch/when-massacre-came-to- a-music-festival-in-israel&quot;>;充斥着该网站&lt;/a>;。他询问是否可以到基布兹寻求庇护。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“别来，”赫尔曼·沙拉比告诉他。她说，武装分子也占领了贝埃里。 （后来传来他被杀的消息。）&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;突然，安全室的门突然打开了。三名黑衣男子用阿拉伯语喊叫，要求家人出来。他们洗劫了房子，而沙拉比派则站在角落里，惊恐万状，一言不发。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“&lt;em>;萨亚拉，萨亚拉，&lt;/em>;”男人们说道，并做出拿着车钥匙的动作。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;赫尔曼·沙拉比不知道该如何回应。 “我该如何解释基布兹没有钥匙，我们共享一切？”她告诉我的。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;全家人穿着睡衣赤脚被带到外面，并让他们坐下。十七岁的大女儿只穿着短裤和运动胸罩，直到一名武装分子从晾衣绳上抓起一件 T 恤递给她。赫尔曼·沙拉比后来被告知，这些武装分子可能属于伊斯兰圣战组织，正如她所说，该组织对伊斯兰教的解释“更正确”。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“我们倒在了地上，这真是天堂的奇迹。”我们所做的，”她告诉我，她知道在基布兹的其他地方，其他武装人员团体也实施了强奸和酷刑行为。&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot;

Yossi Landau, an emergency worker, later recounted some of the harrowing sights he had witnessed in Be&#39;eri that day: the body of a pregnant woman whose belly had been cut open, her infant still inside; children burned alive; the bodies of a couple who had been handcuffed to each other and tortured in front of their children, with one of the man&#39;s eyes gouged out. Landau has spent more than thirty years recovering bodies after terrorist attacks. “I&#39;ve never seen anything like this level of abuse,” he said on Israeli television.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Outside, the suffocating smell of smoke mixed with the stench of death. With the electricity gone, it was hard to see anything. Still, the soldiers asked parents to shield their children&#39;s eyes as they led the families to the kibbutz&#39;s front gate, with gunfire continuing to blast in the background. Shani walked with her daughters, staring at the ground ahead of her. Walking beside her, Herman Sharabi covered her own daughters&#39; eyes, but she “couldn&#39;t help peeking,” she told me. Piles of bodies were strewn all over her neighbors&#39; lawns.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;GenericCallout&quot;>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;GroupCalloutWrapper&quot;>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;An entryway to a home with blood on a step.

They arrived there at 6:30 on Sunday morning—exactly twenty-four hours after the massacre began. The bodies of a hundred and eight kibbutz members were recovered from Be&#39;eri the following day. Among them was Thomas Hand&#39;s ex-wife, and his daughter Emily.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“I went, &#39;Thank God,&#39; ” Hand told me, sobbing. “I actually punched the air. It&#39;s a weird thing, in a normal world. But this isn&#39;t a normal world.” A quick death seemed a lesser evil, he explained, than what might occur in captivity.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Shani&#39;s teen-age son was one of an estimated two hundred people who were taken hostage. For her, that is the preferred option. “At least we have that hope that he&#39;s alive,” she said. Herman Sharabi&#39;s husband and her daughter&#39;s boyfriend were also taken captive. So were ten members of Shaked Haran&#39;s family, who disappeared from Be&#39;eri. What remains of their house is a charred skeleton; its red shutters are the only spot of color left. “But there was no blood, and that gives us hope,” Haran told me on Monday, her eyes bloodshot but her voice firm. Among the hostages were her parents, her sister, her brother-in-law, and her niece and nephew. On Wednesday, her father, Avshalom Haran, was declared dead.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;I met the survivors of Be&#39;eri at the Dead Sea hotel this week. They were wearing clothes donated by volunteers, and some were in too-big flip-flops. You could tell them apart from the hotel&#39;s other guests by the absent look in their eyes and the way they clung to their relatives. The sparkling sea outside was an almost obscene departure from the stories they carried with them, and will continue to carry.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;All of the people I spoke to said they wanted the hostages brought back at any cost. Speaking about Hamas, they repeated one phrase over and over: “It&#39;s either us or them.” But many also mentioned the pain of the Palestinian families living on the other side of the border—who are victims of Hamas rule and of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/q-and-a/the-humanitarian-catastrophe-in-gaza&quot;>;Israeli bombardments&lt;/a>;. One of the people taken hostage was Yarden Roman-Gat, a physiotherapist who spent years working in East Jerusalem, treating Palestinians. “We&#39;ll have to build something out of the wreckage of these two peoples,” her brother told me.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Only on the question of the future of the kibbutz did they hesitate and differ. Some said they would like to go back and rebuild their homes, but they were certain that this couldn&#39;t happen under the current security arrangements. For years, the Israeli government had neglected the southern communities, minimizing the threat from Hamas and ignoring the plight of Gaza. Now, many survivors have the sense that, as one put it, “Be&#39;eri is over.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Without his daughter, Hand cannot imagine going back home. But he fantasized that perhaps the survivors can all move elsewhere. “We can rebuild the kibbutz next to the sea somewhere,” he said. Smiling through tears, he added, “Get some motorboats, a Jet Ski. It&#39;s not the worst way to live.” ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;feature-large-callout&quot;

Amending it is difficult, but not nearly as difficult as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/annals-of-inquiry/the-united-states-unamendable-constitution&quot;>;amending&lt;/a>; the United States&#39;. Australians&#39; attitude to their constitution is less reverential; Patrick Keane, a former justice in Australia&#39;s highest court, called the document “a small brown bird,” something that was modest and mostly invisible. The mechanism by which it can be altered is so simple that it is taught in seventh grade: if a bill to change the constitution is passed by both houses of Parliament, it advances to a nationwide referendum. Voting in constitutional referendums is compulsory (as it is in all Australian elections), and the population is relatively accustomed to national conversations of this scope. Nearly twenty referendums have been presented in the past fifty years; in 1999, Australia voted on whether to remove the Queen as head of state (which lost), and, in 2017, it held a non-compulsory national survey on same-sex marriage (which won in a landslide, leading to legalization).&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The path to the latest question—whether to recognize Indigenous people in the constitution and give them a voice to parliament—which went to the people and lost, on Saturday, started more than half a decade ago, near the foot of Uluru, the enormous red-rock formation that stands at the center of the country. The site is sacred to Australia&#39;s Aboriginal people, who have lived on the continent for at least fifty thousand years, but have been dispossessed and discriminated against since European colonization began, in the eighteenth century. That history has left lasting inequalities; Indigenous Australians continue to experience higher rates of incarceration and poverty and a lower life expectancy than white and other non-Indigenous Australians. For decades, politicians and activists have floated the idea that mentioning Indigenous Australians in the constitution would be a meaningful step, and, in 2015, the government convened a council of public figures—Indigenous and not—to travel the country, meeting more than a thousand local leaders, to explore this possibility. Two years later, more than two hundred and fifty delegates gathered at Uluru for a constitutional convention. Negotiations began; some people walked out. The meetings emerged with one message, a twelve-paragraph pronouncement that fit on a single piece of paper, known as the Uluru Statement from the Heart.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://voice.gov.au/about-voice/uluru-statement&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://voice.gov.au/about-voice/uluru-statement&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://voice.gov.au/about-voice/uluru-statement&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;statement&lt;/a>; emphasized that the “ancestral tie” between Australia and its first inhabitants was never extinguished. “How could it be otherwise?” it asked. “This link is the basis of the ownership of the soil, or better, of sovereignty.” Its prime recommendation was to create a body of Indigenous representatives, called the Voice to Parliament, that would advise the government about laws affecting Indigenous Australians. The group would not have the power to veto proposed laws or to create new ones. It would be a form of recognition in the constitution, and would also, potentially, provide practical advice. The well-known Indigenous lawyer Noel Pearson, who was a key architect of the statement, called it a “safe and responsible middle path.” Pat Anderson, an Indigenous elder and longtime social-justice advocate, described it as an “invitation” to non-Indigenous Australians “to walk with us to a better future.” (Canada added recognition of their Indigenous peoples to its constitution in 1982, and British settlers of New Zealand signed a treaty to guide the relationship between the Crown and the Maori in 1840; Australia has no comparable national legal documentation.)&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In general, Indigenous issues are a larger part of the public consciousness in Australia than they are in the US, but progress toward redressing past wrongs has been uneven and marked, for long periods, by silence. For many, there was a sense that even asking the question of this year&#39;s referendum was overdue. Australia has previously used the constitution to drive change—in 1967, at the urging of Indigenous groups, the country held a referendum to alter a number of its discriminatory clauses. The proposal passed with a larger majority than any referendum in history. In a general election held last year, the Labor Party leader, Anthony Albanese, became the new Prime Minister and began his victory speech by declaring that he would “commit to the Uluru Statement from the Heart in full.” The party faithful cheered.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;For a time, the Voice was popular. In January, support for it was polling above sixty per cent. It was supported by four former Prime Ministers; the Business Council of Australia; the national airline; the mining company Rio Tinto, which had previously &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/26/rio-tinto-blasts-46000-year-old-aboriginal-site-to-expand-iron-ore-mine&quot;>;blown up&lt;/a>; a forty-six-thousand-year-old Aboriginal sacred site in order to expand an iron-ore mine; major sporting teams; several former High Court justices; and a barrage of celebrities, including Russell Crowe, Cate Blanchett, and Chris and Luke Hemsworth. Prominent writers framed the Voice as a much belated corrective. “For too long we have been at the mercy of a European/American imagination,” Richard Flanagan &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.themonthly.com.au/issue/2023/july/richard-flanagan/voice-and-our-inauthentic-heart#mtr&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.themonthly.com.au/issue/2023/july/richard-flanagan/voice-and-our-inauthentic-heart#mtr&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.themonthly.com.au/issue/2023/july/richard-flanagan/voice-and-our-inauthentic-heart#mtr&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;wrote&lt;/a>;; Peter Carey &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://writersforthevoice.com.au/testimonials&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://writersforthevoice.com.au/testimonials&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://writersforthevoice.com.au/testimonials&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;wrote&lt;/a>; that “the weak and guilty might block their ears but a democratic people knows that listening makes us stronger.” But, over months, polling support gradually dropped to the mid-forties. When the result came in on Saturday, it was met with a heavy, known resignation.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The failure of something presented as a “middle path” has been attributed to confusion, both genuine and purposeful, and to racialized lines of thinking about advantage and disadvantage that have long been part of Australia&#39;s political vocabulary. The center-right opposition, the Liberal-National Coalition, formally opposed the Voice, with its leader, Peter Dutton, saying that it would “permanently divide us by race”; in September, he published an op-ed arguing that the Voice would “confer a privilege” on Indigenous people. (Dutton, a former minister of immigration, is known for his hard-line policies around Australia&#39;s offshore detention of refugees.)&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Dutton also suggested that the Voice would lead to some form of reparations. Albanese denied this, but the idea that the Voice is part of a secret scheme to redistribute wealth or land remained a mainstay of the No campaign, with one campaign director declaring, baselessly, that white people will be “paying to live here” if the Voice won. Anti-government social-media pages that appeared during &lt;em >;COVID&lt;/em>; went on to broadcast anti-Voice messages and conspiracy theories (previously not a particularly deep-rooted feature of Australia&#39;s political landscape). One &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-10-05/united-nations-voice-conspiracy-misinformation-spread-revealed/102932852&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-10-05/united-nations-voice-conspiracy-misinformation-spread-revealed/102932852&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-10-05/united-nations-voice-conspiracy-misinformation-spread-revealed/102932852&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;video&lt;/a>; insisted that the Voice would allow the UN to “control all land.” During the campaign, two contradicting Facebook pages emerged: one, opposing the Voice from a conservative perspective, claimed that the body would be “radical,” “dangerous,” and completely change “the way our democratic parliamentary system functions”; another spotlighted progressives and said that the Voice would not do anything substantive—it was called Not Enough. An investigation by the &lt;em>;Guardian&lt;/em>; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jul/14/no-campaign-social-media-strategy-indigenous-voice-referendum&quot;>;revealed&lt;/a>; that a leading organization in the No campaign was running both pages.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;A majority of Indigenous people supported the Voice, but, as the vote drew near, a group of conservative Indigenous politicians said it was something that had been crafted by out-of-touch élites; a small share of Indigenous activists withdrew support from the progressive side, saying that the referendum did not go far enough. This year, the leading slogan of the No campaign was: “If you don&#39;t know, vote no.” But public confusion over the Voice can be primarily attributed to efforts from the highest levels of government to muddy its message from the start. The center-right governments that were in power from 2013 until Albanese&#39;s election rejected the Statement from the Heart when it was released, in 2017, with two Prime Ministers who served during that period describing it, inaccurately, as, effectively “a third chamber” of Parliament. The Yes campaign also had to contend with a period of high inflation and a cost-of-living “crisis,” which may have pulled the public&#39;s attention away, or made the referendum seem, to some, less urgent.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;On Saturday, Albanese acknowledged the vote&#39;s defeat at 9 &lt;em >;PM&lt;/em>;, in Canberra. In Perth, on the other side of the country, the sun was still up. The No campaign tried to be muted; the deputy leader of Dutton&#39;s party, Sussan Ley, said, “I take no joy,” of the result. The director of the Yes campaign, Dean Parkin, a former investment analyst who is a member of the Quandamooka peoples, held back tears toward the end of his concession speech. A &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://ulurustatement.org/a-statement-from-indigenous-australians-who-supported-the-voice-referendum/&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://ulurustatement.org/a-statement-from-indigenous-australians-who-supported-the-voice-referendum/&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://ulurustatement.org/a-statement-from-indigenous-australians-who-supported-the-voice-referendum/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;statement&lt;/a>; shared by numerous Indigenous community organizations declared, “Now is the time for silence, to mourn.” The Voice was only the Uluru Statement&#39;s first recommendation. It had also proposed a treaty-making process, which would create formal legal agreements between the government and Indigenous nations, and what it called “truth-telling”—facing up to Australia&#39;s past. “Understand that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have never wanted to take anything from you,” Parkin said, on Saturday. “All we have wanted to do was to join with you, our Indigenous story, our Indigenous culture.” At the start of his premiership, Albanese had hinted that he hoped to hold two referendums: the Indigenous Voice, in his first term, then another referendum, in his second, on removing the King and becoming a republic. It was a stark plan: two votes staring at Australia&#39;s colonial history and possible future. The Voice was supposed to be the first step. ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;vpdedg&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;3quixt&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 20 Oct 2023 02:06:01 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[These People Used to Live Here?]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.newyorker.com/culture/photo-booth/these-people-used-to-live-here]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-18T21:18:00.000Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6530061c3470a3c1f69d65e9/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Fry-Notarberardino_BRANDON%20OLSEN-001-SIGNED%20RELEASE.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;article >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attribute-verso-pattern=&quot;article-body&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;ArticlePageChunks&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Tony Notarberardino, a photographer from Melbourne, first arrived at the Chelsea Hotel in 1994. He was in his mid-thirties, and he had lived in Paris and London before deciding to try New York on for size. A friend who was staying at the Chelsea suggested that Notarberardino come and crash with him. “He was living with two other people in this tiny room,” the photographer told me, when we spoke on the phone recently. “I was, like, &#39;I&#39;m going to need my own space.&#39; ” The Chelsea, which is on West Twenty-third Street, was converted from an apartment building into a hotel in the early twentieth century, and has housed both long-term residents and temporary guests. Notarberardino thought that he would be one of the latter.

data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;For most of its history, the Chelsea has been known as a refuge for bohemians of all stripes. Its famous occupants have included Patti Smith and Robert Mapplethorpe, Dylan Thomas, Janis Joplin, Arthur C. Clarke, and, perhaps most notoriously, Sid Vicious, who was accused of murdering his girlfriend Nancy Spungen, in 1978, in Room 100. In a recent memoir, “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Dont-Call-Me-Home-Memoir/dp/0593299957&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Dont-Call-Me-Home-Memoir/dp/0593299957&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Dont-Call-Me-Home-Memoir/dp/0593299957&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;Don&#39;t Call Me Home&lt;/a>;,” Alexandra Auder—the daughter of Andy Warhol&#39;s muse Viva—recounts growing up at the Chelsea in the nineteen-eighties: “Along the halls were brown doors with brass knockers, and behind them were apartments: empty apartments, apartments with people passing through, and apartments with long-term residents who decorated their space so thoroughly that the interior bled out from the seams of their doors and into the hallways—turquoise paint, gold enamel, plants, stickers, and plastic toys.” Her mother, Auder continues, would often pop over to visit neighbors such as the composer George Kleinsinger, whose room was teeming with reptiles, or the experimental-film director Shirley Clarke, whose Felix the Cat-themed apartment was decorated entirely in black and white.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;When Notarberardino began living in the hotel a decade later, he was struck by the hodgepodge atmosphere, where a surprise seemingly lurked around every corner. “The Chelsea was run down, full of artists and people who couldn&#39;t afford to live anywhere else,” he told me. “It was like walking into a movie, like being on the set of &#39;Bad Lieutenant.&#39; ” Although he was immediately drawn to the hotel&#39;s louche environment and its unconventional residents, the photographer needed three years to get up the nerve to take pictures of them. One night, in the fall of 1997, he finally took the plunge and approached an aging drag queen he saw in the hotel elevator; she agreed to sit for a portrait in his room. With this, he embarked on a series that he would spend the next two decades pursuing. “I just saw all of these amazing people,” he told me. “And I couldn&#39;t not photograph them.”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot;

Some were celebrities—Blondie&#39;s Debbie Harry, the actor Stephen Baldwin—but most were unknowns, and over the years he photographed them all uniformly, standing against the same bare wall in his apartment. “It didn&#39;t matter if it was Sam Shepard or Sam the cleaner; it had the same importance to me,” he said. There is an anthropological quality to these images, not unlike that of August Sander&#39;s photographic series of Weimar Germans, though Notarberardino&#39;s project is more particular in its aims, seeking to document not an imagined idea of the universal but, rather, participants in a specific era of New York City that was on the verge of ending.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot;

Often, the portrait sessions would happen at night, reflecting the after-hours existence of many of the characters to whom Notarberardino was drawn—sex workers, performers, vagrants, club kids. The party promoter Susanne Bartsch, who lived in a unit above Notarberardino, was photographed in 2007, at 11:20 &lt;em >;PM&lt;/em>;, posing in garters, a feathered headdress, and a lace face covering, looking not unlike a gorgeous cockatoo. (“It took me a long time to get her to take a picture,” Notarberardino told me. “She always had a lot going on.”) In another image, titled simply “Rodrigo Snakeman,” which was taken at 3 &lt;em >;AM&lt;/em>; in the year 2000, a man wears only camo pants, and a snake is wrapped around his bare torso, gleaming in velvety black-and-white. In “Bonnie,” taken in 2006, at 9:30 &lt;em >;PM&lt;/em>;, we see an older woman smoking a cigarette. Wearing heavy makeup, a wig cap, and a revealing showgirl outfit, she makes no attempt to hide her body&#39;s age or supposed imperfections, instead staring forthrightly at the camera. There is an honesty to these pictures, despite the showmanship that many of the subjects are clearly used to. It&#39;s as if, posing in Notarberardino&#39;s apartment, they have been caught off the clock, with their guard a bit down.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;feature-large-callout&quot; >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;GroupCalloutWrapper&quot;>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;Grace Jones&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65300620ed0f4ae933f03485/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Fry-Notarberardino-GRACE%2520JONES-001.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65300620ed0f4ae933f03485/master/w_120,c_limit/Fry-Notarberardino-GRACE%20JONES-001.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65300620ed0f4ae933f03485/master/w_240,c_limit/Fry-Notarberardino-GRACE%20JONES-001.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65300620ed0f4ae933f03485/master/w_320,c_limit/Fry-Notarberardino-GRACE%20JONES-001.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65300620ed0f4ae933f03485/master/w_640,c_limit/Fry-Notarberardino-GRACE%20JONES-001.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65300620ed0f4ae933f03485/master/w_960,c_limit/Fry-Notarberardino-GRACE%20JONES-001.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65300620ed0f4ae933f03485/master/w_1280,c_limit/Fry-Notarberardino-GRACE%20JONES-001.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65300620ed0f4ae933f03485/master/w_1600,c_limit/Fry-Notarberardino-GRACE%20JONES-001.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;“Grace Jones, Wednesday, October 10, 2007, 4:45 &lt;em >;AM&lt;/em>;”&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;A priest holding up a cross.&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6530061c2decf96c1efd995d/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Fry-Notarberardino_FATHER%2520PETE%2520JACOBS-001-SIGNED%2520RELEASE.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6530061c2decf96c1efd995d/master/w_120,c_limit/Fry-Notarberardino_FATHER%20PETE%20JACOBS-001-SIGNED%20RELEASE.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6530061c2decf96c1efd995d/master/w_240,c_limit/Fry-Notarberardino_FATHER%20PETE%20JACOBS-001-SIGNED%20RELEASE.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6530061c2decf96c1efd995d/master/w_320,c_limit/Fry-Notarberardino_FATHER%20PETE%20JACOBS-001-SIGNED%20RELEASE.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6530061c2decf96c1efd995d/master/w_640,c_limit/Fry-Notarberardino_FATHER%20PETE%20JACOBS-001-SIGNED%20RELEASE.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6530061c2decf96c1efd995d/master/w_960,c_limit/Fry-Notarberardino_FATHER%20PETE%20JACOBS-001-SIGNED%20RELEASE.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6530061c2decf96c1efd995d/master/w_1280,c_limit/Fry-Notarberardino_FATHER%20PETE%20JACOBS-001-SIGNED%20RELEASE.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6530061c2decf96c1efd995d/master/w_1600,c_limit/Fry-Notarberardino_FATHER%20PETE%20JACOBS-001-SIGNED%20RELEASE.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;“Father Peter Jacobs, Thursday, August 9, 2007, 3:40 &lt;em >;PM&lt;/em>;”&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;In 2022, after more than a decade of renovations, the Chelsea reopened as a luxury hotel. Some long-term residents of rent-controlled units, like Notarberardino, were able to stay, after a lengthy renegotiation with the new owners. But the face of the Chelsea has changed. Its suites feature a “rainfall shower” and a “deep soaking tub,” and its bar serves eighteen-dollar artisanal cocktails. “It&#39;s all different now,” he told me. “It&#39;s like I&#39;m suddenly living in a five-star hotel.” The Chelsea that was shot by him for all those years, with its ragtag and colorful cast of characters, is no longer, and his body of work has become a historical document. “Now people look at these pictures, and they ask, &#39;Wow, these people used to live here?&#39;

>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;In the aftermath of Hamas&#39;s October 7th terrorist attack, Israel&#39;s military has been &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/q-and-a/the-humanitarian-catastrophe-in-gaza&quot;>;bombing the Gaza Strip&lt;/a>;, where it has killed more than three thousand Palestinians. Tensions are also mounting in the West Bank, where several dozen Palestinians have been killed since last week. While the media&#39;s focus has, understandably, been on the more than thirteen hundred Israeli victims of the initial attack, and on Palestinian civilians now facing siege and aggression in the occupied territories, there are two million Palestinians living inside Israel itself, making up approximately twenty per cent of the country&#39;s population.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I recently spoke by phone with Amjad Iraqi—an editor at +972 Magazine and a policy analyst at the think tank Al-Shabaka who comes from a family of Palestinian citizens of Israel—to discuss how Palestinian Israelis are reckoning with this month&#39;s events, and what the war may mean for their future. During our conversation, which has been edited for length and clarity, we also discussed the distinct forms of discrimination that Palestinian citizens of Israel face, how the relationship among different Palestinian communities has changed over time, and what Hamas&#39;s tactics mean for any future state that recognizes equal rights for its inhabitants.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;How would you describe the symbolic or practical relationship between Palestinians who are citizens of Israel and Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Most Palestinians—about seven hundred and fifty thousand—either fled or were expelled during the 1948 war. But, after the armistice lines were created between Israel and the surrounding Arab states, you still had about a hundred and fifty thousand Palestinians on the Israeli side of the border. And the state decided to grant these Palestinians citizenship, and their descendants to this day still have that Israeli citizenship. So, historically, we are part of the Palestinian people. We originated in historical Palestine as it was understood from the British Mandate period. And we&#39;re still part of that Palestinian society, but with this specific legal class and legal status.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;How do the rights of Arab or Palestinian citizens within Israel differ from the rights of Jews in Israel?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;From the early days of the state, up until 1966, Palestinians inside Israel were placed under military rule—the same infrastructure that we&#39;re familiar with in the West Bank. There were curfews and orders and even arrests. This entailed a lot of harsh restrictions on Palestinians, including on their political organizing, and social and cultural expression. But one of the most pivotal things was that Israel confiscated masses of land—not just from Palestinian refugees who were expelled or who fled but also from Palestinian citizens inside. My home town, Tira, shrank by about a third from its original size. Military rule was lifted in 1966, and since then you&#39;ve had this gradual progression, let&#39;s say, of Palestinian citizens&#39; rights.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;But, even to this day, there is an extensive legal infrastructure that inherently makes Palestinian citizens unequal to Jewish citizens. You can go all the way back to these laws that were used to appropriate land and property. But you also have things like the Law of Return, which allows Jews from anywhere around the world to come and get automatic citizenship. Meanwhile, family members of Palestinians, even those who are citizens of Israel and who originated from that land before 1948, are actively denied that right. The Citizenship and Entry Into Israel Law basically bans family unification between citizens of Israel and people in the occupied territories. This is one of the most racist laws because it is first and foremost about demographics. There is the Admissions Committees Law of 2011, which basically enables housing segregation. And these are not just ancient laws. Especially in the Netanyahu years, you had a huge proliferation of this very targeted discriminatory legislation, which inherently makes people second-class.&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;Do you feel that this situation has, broadly speaking, sparked camaraderie and solidarity between Palestinian communities within Israel and in the West Bank and Gaza? Or have the discrepancies between Palestinians who live in Israel and Palestinians who live in the occupied territories, for example, caused resentment instead?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;It has always ebbed and flowed. In the first twenty years of Israel&#39;s existence, Palestinian citizens inside the state were cut off from the Palestinian people. They were cut off from the rest of the Arab world. There was this enormous rupture. One second, they were part of a land that they were familiar with, and suddenly, within the space of one or two years, they became second- or third-class citizens. Their entire homeland was completely transformed and usurped.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;After 1967, there&#39;s this kind of irony that, when Israel began its occupation of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, although it came with its own horrors for Palestinians there, for Palestinian citizens of Israel it actually opened up the community. Suddenly they were able to connect with family and others in the West Bank and Gaza. People were able to cross the Green Line. This idea of a one-state reality is not a recent invention. It happened the moment soldiers set foot in the Jordan Valley and on the Gaza coast, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/reframing-the-1967-war&quot;>;in 1967&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Ever since, Palestinian citizens have been reviving and restoring connections both on the personal and the collective level. And you see this steady trajectory of Palestinian generations returning to their identity of Palestinian-ness, especially this younger generation. With every passing decade, those connections only get stronger. You have organizations, you have political parties, you have cultural centers. And, even now, social media. Of course, there&#39;s been a lot of repression and blockage, and inequality, but that was one of the openings.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;Can you talk a little bit about the 2021 protests, and what they represented along these lines?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The real source and spark began in Jerusalem. You had these two struggles that were going on. One was around Jerusalem, specifically Damascus Gate, and of course the holy sites, such as Al-Aqsa, where Israeli police were using restrictions and brutality against a lot of worshippers and protesters. And, at the same time, you had this parallel struggle where Jewish settlers were basically trying to force out Palestinians from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/sheikh-jarrah-and-the-renewed-israeli-palestinian-violence&quot;>;Sheikh Jarrah&lt;/a>; neighborhood.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;These two parallel struggles galvanized a lot of Palestinian society across borders. And, as these struggles intensified in Jerusalem, you then had Palestinian citizens of Israel coming out into the streets. You also had Hamas enter with rocket attacks under the pretext of defending Jerusalem. And this led to a war in Gaza as well. Those events then became dual dimensions of what Palestinians call the Unity Intifada or the Dignity Intifada. This restored a sense of pride, and there was a synchronized resistance to the regime.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;The flip side of that was also this violence which was being imposed by the state. You had the bombardment of Gaza. You had the brutality that was happening in Jerusalem and the threat of settler takeovers. Inside Israel, you had police brutality across Palestinian towns, and especially in mixed cities like Jaffa and Haifa, where there were some clashes between Jewish and Arab citizens. Though you had some violence on both sides, even inside the state there was a colossal asymmetry.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;fcdyh9&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;rmgjmm&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;Has the relationship between different Palestinian communities changed with the increasing sense, among some parties, that a one-state solution might be more realistic than two states?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Palestinian citizens of Israel defy the paradigm that everyone&#39;s been pushing for so many decades. So, yes, we&#39;re citizens of Israel. And, yes, especially since the Oslo Accords, Palestinian citizens, or at least their political leaders, have advocated for something like a two-state framework. But the reality is that we actually exist beyond the Green Line. We transcend it. There are people who go to the West Bank to shop on a regular basis. Or to see family members. There&#39;s a whole socioeconomic life that transcends the idea of “This side is Israel, this side is Palestine.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The underlying core consensus of the Palestinian community in Israel is full equality for all and an end to the occupation. If you want a two-state solution, that&#39;s fine. But we&#39;re not interested in living in a state that deems your race or your ethnicity a determinant of your rights. The Israeli response has been that this is calling for the destruction of the Jewish state. The way Zionism has become dominant today—it cannot fathom Jewish existence in historical Palestine without an ethno-national state. It needs a Jewish state. It needs this system that insures a higher Jewish class compared with non-Jews.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;So the issue is not necessarily whether you get a Palestinian state or not. The question is whether Palestinians on all sides of the Green Line are living in a system that insures that they&#39;re actually recognized as people who belong to the land, who are not having their rights conditioned on another group getting theirs first. Even the Zionist left still sees Jewish privilege and some form of Jewish supremacy as a requirement to any future solution. For Palestinian citizens, that&#39;s absolutely unacceptable.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;Broadly speaking, how did the Palestinian Israeli community feel about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/letter-from-jerusalem/israels-transformative-protest-movement&quot;>;judicial protests&lt;/a>; that we&#39;ve seen this year in Israel, which were obviously trying to oppose the Netanyahu government and essentially some more extreme forms of Zionism, but were fundamentally not challenging the occupation?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;There&#39;s a reason that hardly any Palestinian citizens came to these demonstrations. There&#39;s a lot of debate in the community about this, but there&#39;s a pretty core understanding that the premises of this huge fight in the Israeli political system and Israeli society is a clash of two myths. The far right and the people who are for this coup are saying that the courts have been too interventionist. The opposition, which isn&#39;t just from the Zionist left, but includes members of the Zionist right and center, is arguing that, actually, the court is crucial for democracy. Palestinian citizens are watching all this and they&#39;re asking, “What are these two camps talking about?” Because both are completely wrong. The Supreme Court and the Israeli judiciary have been active participants in and enablers of the Israeli state&#39;s worst policies. A lot of the discriminatory laws that were passed in the past ten, fifteen years—most were actually openly approved by the Supreme Court despite Palestinian citizens petitioning against them and trying to challenge them in all sorts of ways. And this is not even to mention most of the policies that are upheld in the occupied territories and that shield the military from accountability.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;How does Hamas view Palestinian citizens of Israel?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;There&#39;s an understanding among most Palestinian citizens, even those who don&#39;t support Hamas, that it is one manifestation of Palestinian politics and the Palestinian struggle. In regard to the past two weeks, I think a lot of Palestinian citizens were quite shocked by what happened. On one front, I think many of them saw the first phase of the Hamas attack, targeting military infrastructure, as this inspiring moment. But there is that other dimension: the horrors and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/dispatch/when-massacre-came-to-a-music-festival-in-israel&quot;>;massacres&lt;/a>; that happened in southern Israeli communities. And Palestinian citizens have this complex position because they know these places, they know some of these communities, and some of them work in these areas. They also are affected by rocket attacks that come from Gaza. So it&#39;s a very complex place to be in whereby they understand where Hamas is coming from and align themselves with the Palestinians who are trapped in that siege, but their politics is still much more about trying to play the system to try to change the status quo. Unfortunately, even nonviolent political movements are met with a lot of repression, and sometimes crushed in the same way that armed struggle is. And this is part of the dilemma that affects all Palestinians.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;I&#39;m curious how Hamas views people like you, though, because Palestinian citizens of Israel were also killed. This would imply that Hamas sees Palestinian citizens of Israel as acceptable collateral damage or, essentially, as part of the problem, because you somehow submit to a state that&#39;s occupying Palestinian territory.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I think it&#39;s more complicated. I assume they are targeting Jewish Israelis, but willing to think that there will be sacrifices that have to be made. Still, even if there are differences and disagreements between Palestinian citizens and Hamas, including the question of armed struggle, there&#39;s a core alignment about the protection of Palestinians as a whole, so there are issues that bind them despite any differences that they might have.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;If they are targeting Palestinian citizens of Israel, or they don&#39;t care about Palestinian citizens of Israel dying, that could tell us something about the movement which is more complex than that they&#39;re just interested in Palestinian liberation.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;0eqcu9&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/what-was-hamas-thinking&quot;>;Their tactics&lt;/a>;, especially in the past two weeks, have been brutal. And Palestinian citizens know Hamas&#39;s tactics can often come at a cost to them, and that their own communities aren&#39;t safe. Many Arab towns don&#39;t have bomb shelters to protect them from rocket attacks. But the difference is the political context. Even if they&#39;re horrified by the massacres and reject violence and call for a different kind of movement, they still understand why this is happening.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;One of the things that&#39;s been striking about the past ten days is how naïve a lot of people have been about colonial movements in history and how people have fought against them. At the same time, if you look at a lot of colonial movements, such as Nelson Mandela and the African National Congress: his vision of the future was a democratic South Africa where all people were treated the same. And Mandela, whatever his flaws when he eventually became President, tried to enact that vision. Hamas&#39;s goal is not a one-state solution of everyone living in peace together. What about criticizing their anti-colonial vision on that score?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I think that&#39;s right. With that said, Hamas is again just one stream of Palestinian thoughts and politics. There are other streams that go beyond that, and Palestinian citizens especially have tried to create these different understandings of what the future can look like. And so, yeah, I think a lot of people will critique Hamas&#39;s model for the future.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Palestinian citizens have this inside position to understand Jewish Israeli society in a way that the Palestinians in occupied territories can&#39;t, because also we see them as civilians, whereas in the occupied territories they see Israelis physically as settlers and soldiers. In any other country, the word “equality” would be the rallying cry, exactly as you mentioned about South Africa. The problem is that, in Israel-Palestine, that actually gets thrown out the window, even by people in the United States, because equality in the narrative of Israel and Zionism means the death of the Jewish state, which should tell you a lot about what the state is and what it actually desires to be. And this is not just some theoretical thing. At times, when Palestinian citizens have tried to offer so much as a bill or a political platform or even just alternate ideas, they have been arrested, they&#39;ve been demonized, their legislation is rejected, and they&#39;re called terrorists.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Hamas&#39;s tactics are brutal and violent. It is also an outcome of a wider regime that is trying to dictate how politics is conducted. Even in South Africa, the way that most people have understood the end of apartheid has been very much whitewashed and simplified. It wasn&#39;t just boycotts and sanctions. There was a huge military struggle. There was a huge civil-disobedience campaign that got very ugly. But Palestinians are not only being asked to wage the cleanest struggle in the world, they are being told not to ask for full equality. How can Israel be a democracy when, in reality, it&#39;s asking for an exception to be a Jewish state, where Jews still get some kind of privilege? This is an indictment not only of the state but also of the fact that the international community has such a warped understanding of the situation that it thinks equality and the Palestinian demand for equality will result in the death of a state.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;You&#39;re saying that, essentially, the Zionist project has a certain lack of equality written into it. That seems right to me, but a lot of Israelis and a lot of Jews would say that you need such a state because of the huge amount of antisemitism in the world. Whatever you think about that, it does seem to me that it&#39;s a challenge to the idea of one state living in peace if so much of the resistance to the current state, especially in the case of Hamas, entails clearly wanting to kill Jews.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The history of Zionism and the evolution of Zionism shows that it was never an inevitable trajectory, but the problem now is that everyone is saying that the only answer to Jewish safety is Zionism, and I think many Jews will be the first to tell you that that&#39;s not the case. If one of the answers to your security and safety is to have a heavily militarized state with authoritarian powers, I&#39;m not sure we&#39;re learning the lessons of history. I know there&#39;s a lot of debate, there&#39;s a lot of pushback, especially among American Jews. We&#39;re trying to say there&#39;s an alternative way to think about this, not only in terms of Jewish identity outside of Israel, that there is a place for Jews in the diaspora, but also for Israeli Jews—that if they can only envision their safety and security through dominance, then this in and of itself is a huge clash of values, even within Jewish society.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;There are very real historical and present reasons for Jewish society, transnationally, to be concerned, because antisemitism is still alive and well. And, yes, there are actors, including Hamas, who do have these attitudes, but this is not inevitable. This is not fate. There are other ideas that exist in Palestinian politics. But if Israel&#39;s regime over Palestinians, which is defined by violence even outside of war, if this apartheid is still active, that is what metastasizes Palestinian violence.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;19qlda&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;wnbdd&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;When a boycott-and-sanctions movement came to South Africa, it was praised all over the world. I grew up being told that nonviolence was the best way to go, but what Palestinians are finding is that, even when you try nonviolent tactics, you are deemed antisemitic. You are still being deemed a terrorist. You are being deemed someone who&#39;s seeking the destruction of the Jewish state. And Palestinian citizens see this literally when they use their right to vote to try to push alternate kinds of legislation, and they are deemed enemies, a fifth column.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;How much fear is there that there&#39;s going to be a backlash against Palestinians within Israel?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The dominant feeling right now among Palestinian citizens is fear. May, 2021, just gave a glimpse of how the Israeli state and society can react against Palestinian citizens in these moments. Jewish Israeli society has been growing more and more right-wing. It&#39;s not just the politicians: it&#39;s going all the way down, including to the media, including to universities, and to the streets—you feel that increasing racism, you feel that increasing hawkishness, including against the Arabs inside the country.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;And what we&#39;ve been seeing after these two weeks is Palestinian students on campuses being suspended or expelled by university administrations. You have universities sending out letters that threaten anyone who speaks out, saying that they could be fired or expelled. And they&#39;re targeting Palestinians specifically. I don&#39;t know what the numbers are now, but you have scores of citizens being arrested by the Israeli police as we speak. So we&#39;re seeing the state really try to stifle citizens from being able even to protest.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;We are watching this colossal bombardment of Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, and these are people we have direct family and social and national connections with. Palestinian citizens really fear the possibility of forced transfer. And, so, time will tell in the coming weeks and months how that&#39;s going to unfold. But now we are really just feeling the hostility, to the point that fear is really permeating.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I still think that we have a lot to offer to show Palestinians and Israelis and people abroad that there is a different way, but it begins by breaking some of the paradigms that everyone&#39;s been promoting, especially since the Oslo period. It begins with other nations learning to look at us as a community with all our imperfections, and realizing that we are trying to create a different kind of future, based on those principles of full equality and recognition of full national rights for everyone, in a shared society. ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;6zr9&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 20 Oct 2023 00:06:01 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“Beckham” Shows Us How David and Victoria Beckham See Themselves]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.newyorker.com/culture/on-television/beckham-shows-us-how-david-and-victoria-beckham-see-themselves]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-19T13:50:42.211Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/652da023c3a50683a2af3508/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Mead-Beckham.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;article >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attribute-verso-pattern=&quot;article-body&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;ArticlePageChunks&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;“They were the new Charles and Diana, in some ways,” Gary Neville, the former Manchester United player, says in the first episode of “Beckham,” a new, four-part documentary on Netflix. They, of course, are David Beckham, Neville&#39;s friend and onetime teammate, and Beckham&#39;s then girlfriend, Victoria Adams, aka Posh Spice. The period about which Neville is speaking is 1997—the height of the fame of the Spice Girls, the record-breaking girl group of which Adams was one sylphlike fifth, and the beginning of the ascendancy of Beckham as considerably more than just a very good footballer. (I, like the documentary, will stick with the globally preferred nomenclature of the game.)&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Posh and Becks, as the tabloids called them—nice short words, great big headlines—were a celebrity match made in heaven. They were also a match made in David&#39;s fantasies, it turns out, even before the couple&#39;s first encounter. He tells the documentary&#39;s director, Fisher Stevens, about seeing a Spice Girls video while he and Neville were idly watching TV one day. “I turned round to Gary, I went, &#39;See that one there? I&#39;m gonna marry that one,&#39; ” David remembers. (The documentary suggests—and forensic YouTubing confirms—that the video in question was for “Wannabe,” the group&#39;s multiplatinum début single, from 1996. It includes the characterization of Victoria as “Easy V. who doesn&#39;t come for free / She&#39;s a real lady,” and shows her sporting her signature look of disdain.) Neville tells Stevens, “I suppose that most blokes have done that in their life. Looked at a television set and said, &#39;I like her.&#39; They don&#39;t fucking end up with them.” But David was already attracting attention as a gifted, and good-looking, young player, and destiny took its course when Victoria attended a Manchester United game—an outing likely undertaken in her capacity as a Spice Girl rather than a civilian, because, as she firmly informs Stevens in one of numerous interviews he conducted with both of the Beckhams over two years, “I am &lt;em>;not&lt;/em>; into football. At all. I wasn&#39;t into football then, I am not into football now.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Even if you were not into football then and you are not into football now, “Beckham” makes for fascinating viewing—as a document of the late nineties and early two-thousands in the UK, with its Brit-pop and its Blairy optimism; as a record of a moment when the use of private jets and the acquisition of luxury goods by newly wealthy celebrities might have been regarded as crass but wasn&#39;t yet deemed ethically criminal; as a portrait, albeit a flatteringly partial one, of a long-enduring marriage between famous people who seem genuinely to enjoy and admire one another; as a reminder of the extent to which the tabloids and their guns-for-hire—metaphorical, this is Britain—went in pursuing their quarry. Among the many sometimes starry interviewees—they range from Ronaldo Nazário, Beckham&#39;s onetime teammate at Real Madrid, to Anna Wintour, in her capacity as the person who put the Spice Girls on the cover of &lt;em>;Vogue&lt;/em>;—two standouts are Eamonn and James Clarke, a pair of paparazzi brothers from Manchester. They wear matching beards and drink from matching coffee mugs, and, when asked how they feel about the photographs they took in 1999 of David cradling the Beckhams&#39; infant son, Brooklyn, in his arms as he carried him to a waiting vehicle, they have matching auras of shame: “You wouldn&#39;t do it now,” they offer, inadequately.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Commentators have pointed out that the series was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/family/life/david-beckham-interview-documentary-netflix-release/&quot;>;produced by Beckham&#39;s company&lt;/a>;, which may explain why it skirts some of the more questionable endeavors undertaken by the player, such as being an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-12347997/David-Beckham-defends-controversial-10m-Qatar-World-Cup-deal-insisting-engagement-way-making-change-faced-criticism-promoting-country-poor-human-rights-record-anti-gay-laws.html&quot;>;ambassador for Qatar&lt;/a>;, a country with a problematic human-rights record that controversially hosted the 2022 World Cup—a role for which he reportedly signed a multimillion-dollar deal. (Stevens says that he asked Beckham about it but his answer “wasn&#39;t brilliant enough to put in the film.”) It&#39;s possible to see the documentary&#39;s provenance as part of its strength: “Beckham” shows us how the Beckhams see themselves, and how they want to be seen. In this respect, the royal couple who come most readily to mind, as one watches the sometimes teary unspooling of intimate disclosures from handsome people sitting on expensive couches in covetable neo-rustic interiors, is not Charles and Diana but that other much misunderstood, oft-pilloried, fame-blasted couple, Harry and Meghan.&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;The Beckhams are not quite able to say, as the Duke and Duchess of Sussex did in their own Netflix docuseries, that this was their first opportunity to tell their story on their terms. Both have published books: among his, the dubiously named autobiography “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/David-Beckham-My-Side/dp/0007157339&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/David-Beckham-My-Side/dp/0007157339&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/David-Beckham-My-Side/dp/0007157339&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;My Side&lt;/a>;”; among hers, the more enticingly titled fashion-and-beauty guide “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/That-Extra-Half-Inch-Everything/dp/0061544493&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/That-Extra-Half-Inch-Everything/dp/0061544493&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/That-Extra-Half-Inch-Everything/dp/0061544493&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;That Extra Half an Inch: Hair, Heels and Everything in Between&lt;/a>;.” They have participated in countless other authorized media engagements, including one held to announce their own engagement, a press conference at a countryside spa. “I&#39;m with the man I know I&#39;m going to grow old and wrinkly with,” Victoria said at the time, trolling future generations of life-style journalists on the tweakment-detection beat. Then there was the million pounds they were paid by the magazine &lt;em>;OK!&lt;/em>; for access to their wedding in 1999, not long after Manchester United became the first-ever English team to win, in the same season, the Premier League, the FA Cup, and the Champions League; that last victory, over Bayern Munich, saw United struggling throughout the match&#39;s ninety minutes but securing a victory by scoring two goals in injury time. &lt;em>;OK!&lt;/em>; got its money&#39;s worth: the Beckhams&#39; nuptial extravaganza was held at a castle outside Dublin, with the couple wearing coördinating outfits in a lurid purple for their reception. This is a hue that, after spending decades in color-spectrum Siberia, was recently dignified when Pantone nominated Viva Magenta as 2023&#39;s Color of the Year—take that and stick it, stealth-wealth greige. Honestly, the pictures are fabulous, and the four-month-old Brooklyn in a matching purple Stetson and bib? Adorbs.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Like Harry and Meghan&#39;s series, “Beckham” does lay bare the at times intolerable experience of being one of the most famous people, and half of the most famous couple, in the world. Celebrity—who&#39;d want it? It could be argued that both Beckhams sought fame out, unlike Harry, at least, who had it thrust upon him by birth. They knew that every change of haircut would cause headlines, not to mention a run at the barbershop in the after-school hours. (The floppy fringe, the crewcut, the scuzzy mohawk—every grade-school classroom was once filled with them.) At least some of the time, making headlines seemed to be one of Posh and Becks&#39;s goals, leading to buzz-generating modelling shoots and lucrative endorsements. In the light of their overexposure, some less than fawning attention was inevitable and scrutiny of the couple was fair game, but only up to a point: no one deserves to sit in a football stadium, in support of their loved one, and listen to seventy-five thousand people, overwhelmingly men, chant, “Posh Spice takes it up the arse.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;The plausible solidity of the union between Posh and Becks is one of the heartwarmingest themes of “Beckham.” There&#39;s the cute way he calls her out when she talks about their shared working-class origins. (“Be honest—what car did your dad drive you to school in?” After some prevaricating, she admits, “In the eighties, my dad had a Rolls-Royce.”) There&#39;s the loving way she gets emotional recalling the most ignominious chapter of David&#39;s career—when, in a moment of petulance during a momentous match against Argentina in the 1998 World Cup, he kicked an opponent and was ejected from the game. England lost, and embittered fans subjected David to a months-long campaign of vilification, with everyone from the tabloids to Tony Blair suggesting he was responsible for the national loss. He was hanged in effigy outside one pub. His face was printed in the newspaper as a dartboard. “It pained me so much,” Victoria recalls. “I still want to kill these people.”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;1z8lpw&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;f2qtld&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;The Beckhams have each other&#39;s backs, the series suggests, apart from the period covered in the final episode, when Stevens addresses the allegations that David went behind Victoria&#39;s back with another woman. (Her name, Rebecca Loos, is discreetly cropped out of the documentary&#39;s images, and so is her role in its narrative: she was David&#39;s assistant and translator when he was first transferred to Real Madrid, in 2003.) The couple acknowledge that it was a very difficult period without quite confirming the veracity of the allegations. Their subsequent actions, though, bespeak the striking of a marital deal more binding than a watertight Premier League contract: David left one of the best teams in the world, in Spain, where Victoria was never happy, and joined one of the worst teams in the world, in Los Angeles, which Victoria loved. (He later joined Paris Saint-Germain and retired from the game in 2013.) To be fair, LA did suit them both, apart from the way David got confused by the placement of lines on the pitch left over from its use in what he calls American football. “LA is like rehab for famous people,” Victoria says—and who in their right mind thinks that rehab is a bad idea, even for famous people? Bless them in their bug-eye sunglasses and Ugg boots at the grocery store.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;In fact, the documentary could be understood to be implying that it was actually Victoria who should have been Public Enemy No. 1 after the World Cup loss. She tells Stevens that the night before the match against Argentina she phoned David from Brooklyn, where she was on tour with the Spice Girls, and informed him that she was pregnant with their first child. This is the kind of news that a person who was “into football” might consider saving until after a high-stakes game. The documentary reminds us that Victoria was blamed for other of David&#39;s failings on the pitch when they happened—not only by the tabloids but by Manchester United&#39;s manager, Sir Alex Ferguson. Sir Alex, or “the boss,” as David calls him, is another compelling presence throughout the series, a father figure whom David cannot help loving, in spite of the fact that Ferguson summarily fired him, in 2003, when the Beckham circus got wilder and the Beckham game got sloppier than the boss was willing to tolerate. The blaming of a wicked woman for distracting a good man from his game is, of course, a story as old as Eve, or at least as old as Yoko Ono. Still, the vitriolic criticism of Victoria is an ugly history to revisit. It&#39;s not just history, either. Victoria is, according to one female British columnist reviewing the series, “a charmless, empty gobshite,” who “mooed” that she was bullied at school—an odd choice of verb, given that one might assume the animal-based slur least likely to be lobbed at Posh would be a bovine one.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Funnily enough, Victoria was never credited when David did do something amazing—and the series shows a lot of occasions on which he does something amazing. Because there is also a lot of football in the four episodes—spectacular highlights of the sort to delight even a person who doesn&#39;t like football. At all. I won&#39;t attempt a full tally of the pantheon of grizzled footballing superstars whom Stevens shoots in closeup, to great effect, as they look directly into the camera while watching a replay of a celebrated game—so that we, the viewers on our own, non-luxury couches, can imagine ourselves to &lt;em>;be&lt;/em>; the famous penalty shootout or corner kick. Nor will I attempt to list all the times when David&#39;s right foot brought his team back from the brink or when his surging hopes were dashed at the last moment. I lost track of the number of sequences when a match was condensed into a few thrilling, orchestral-music-enhanced minutes, interrupted by David or some other participant saying something like, “And that&#39;s when everything changed”—which is not to say that I didn&#39;t love every one of them.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;There are, inevitably, some regrettable omissions in the series. Stevens might have included a quick minute on Chingford, the suburb on the northeastern fringe of London where David grew up, to allow the kind of granular class-based analysis that would make little sense to an American audience but is the kind of thing that can keep Brits at it for hours. (Can you be working class and drive a Rolls-Royce? Discuss.) A viewer might also want a little more interrogation of David&#39;s tattoos, which are legion, and seemed to proliferate in the course of the series. Was that little one between his ear and his sideburn there from the get-go, or is that just a trick of the very subtle lighting in the sprawling man cave of the Beckhams&#39; vast converted barn complex in the Cotswold countryside? If, as a teammate suggests in the final episode, football players are addicted to adrenaline, could the tats be David&#39;s substitute rush, a way to prolong the agony and the rewards of his relinquished calling—the game that, he believes, he loved “more than anyone has ever loved it,” and that he was so very good at?&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;But these are quibbles. The cumulative effect of the series is to suggest that, if David and Victoria were the old Harry and Meghan, they have come through decades of attention far from unscathed, but at least with some of their sense of humor intact. The Beckhams did not have final cut of “Beckham,” but they did get to preview the series, and one hopes that they were as amused as everyone else will be to see the inclusion, at the end of the second episode, of a video showing Neville—the documentary&#39;s sleeper star, by the way—giving a filthy best-man speech at their wedding: “David said that the Spice Girls requested that the Bayern Munich team be present today, and David was puzzled at this request and asked why. He said that the Spice Girls replied that they&#39;d love to meet any men that could stay on top for ninety minutes and still come second.” He shoots! He scores! ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;sjgesj&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 19 Oct 2023 22:06:01 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[A Tour of Vermont’s Autumnal Majesty (with Some Adjustments Necessitated by Climate Change)]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.newyorker.com/humor/daily-shouts/a-tour-of-vermonts-autumnal-majesty-with-some-adjustments-necessitated-by-climate-change]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-19T10:00:00.000Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6530020ac7b9fbe0a4ff29fb/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/shouts-brewer-vermont.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;article >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attribute-verso-pattern=&quot;article-body&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;ArticlePageChunks&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Welcome to the world&#39;s foremost autumnal experience—a jaunt through the iconic mountains and orchards of rural Vermont. You may notice a few unsettling changes this year, but we&#39;re determined to carry on and provide an excursion that is, in its own way, unforgettable. Buckle up, loosen that infinity scarf (it&#39;s eighty-one degrees here), and get ready to see some things you&#39;ll never be able to unsee.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Our first stop is Wistful Valley Orchard. Yes, it is taking longer than usual to get there—good observation. That&#39;s because flash floods opened up a sinkhole on Route 116 that we&#39;ve been calling the Crater to Hades.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Here we are, at the orchard, a ghostly wasteland with nary an apple in sight. As any Vermonter could tell you, back in May there was an infamous night of frost when there should have been spring warmth and gentle dew, and on that night all the apple blossoms were blasted from the bough.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I&#39;m sorry, what&#39;s that? You want your money back for the orchard portion of the tour? Well, we want our predictable weather patterns back. But instead we&#39;re getting one extreme-weather event after another, aren&#39;t we? I guess that&#39;s what happens when humanity heedlessly pumps carbon dioxide into the planet&#39;s atmosphere for decades, despite knowing all the while the deadly havoc that doing so would wreak.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Let&#39;s move on to the corn maze! Our apocalyptic rainfall has actually been fine for the corn, making this the only part of the tour that remains unscathed. But I&#39;m guessing you didn&#39;t fly here from Indiana to marvel at our corn.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;We&#39;re going to pause at this popular lookout point. Over thataway, through the sooty smog redolent with Canadian wildfire smoke, we can almost make out the Adirondacks. What a view. It&#39;s not for the faint of heart.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Hello, yes. I see that the Leaf Peepers have piped up. You will notice a handful of shrivelled and naked maple trees over yonder. Blame the floods again! Trees with waterlogged roots are more vulnerable to foliar pathogens and fungus. The leaves literally said “fuck this” and dipped.&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;But notwithstanding, many of our trees are, indeed, still green. Temperatures have not dropped enough to signal the biochemical process that transforms the mountainside into its usual kaleidoscope of pigmentation. It may as well be summer. And, with your knee-high boots, head-to-toe flannel, and that cursed infinity scarf, you&#39;re probably on the verge of heat stroke. I&#39;d recommend a swim in one of our famous gorges, except the floodwaters have churned up E. coli to levels unsafe for human contact.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Ah, there&#39;s nothing like the harvest. It sure does make you think, doesn&#39;t it? Makes you think about reaping. Makes you think about sowing. Doesn&#39;t it?&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The last stop on our tour was supposed to be the iconic hilltop above Restless Hollow Farm, but it&#39;s currently closed off owing to teeming crowds of annoying photographers. That one&#39;s not a climate-related issue, just something else we&#39;ve got going on here.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Still plenty of other things to photograph! Our red efts have grown fangs; our fawns are demonic; our usually woolly bears nude and smooth. Our glacial springs burble with the torpor and consistency of a melting pint of Phish Food ice cream. Our geese are confounded, and circle overhead with the vultures. That&#39;s probably nothing to worry about.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Well, we have some extra time since we had to cancel the pumpkin patch (gourd rot) and the soup festival (too hot for soup). We could either visit the corn maze again or spend a couple more hours among the devastated apple crops. You said you liked “spooky season”—what could be more haunting than the mournful cries of an influencer who came all this way for juicy snaps with Macs and Cortlands, but now stands before a fruitless valley in despair?&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;We hope you have not enjoyed this tour. We hope you have not enjoyed it so much that you devote the rest of your life to the cause of ecological activism, maybe even sue for climate justice. Either way, come back soon and check out our hiking tour, which, because the air-quality index is in the triple digits, takes place inside. ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;jml19v&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;fagun8&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 19 Oct 2023 19:06:01 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Dramatic and Moral Ambitions Clash in “Killers of the Flower Moon”]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/10/30/killers-of-the-flower-moon-movie-review]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-19T10:00:00.000Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653000e1a2f5fe5a23a6a9af/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/231030_r43255.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;article >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attribute-verso-pattern=&quot;article-body&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;ArticlePageChunks&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;For fans of James Dean, nothing beats the moment in “Giant” (1956) when an oil well erupts. Dean raises his arms and bathes in the rich rain. Clocking in at three hours and twenty-one minutes, “Giant” chimes with Martin Scorsese&#39;s latest movie, “Killers of the Flower Moon,” which, not to be outdone, is five minutes longer still. In an extraordinary sequence, near the start, we see men of the Osage Nation, stripped to the waist, dancing in slow motion, and in unfeigned joy, as a shower of oil falls upon them. It may be the one happy vision in the entire film. From here on, oil will take second place to another precious commodity that gushes with the aid of human know-how. There will be blood.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Written by Scorsese and Eric Roth, “Killers of the Flower Moon” is adapted from the nonfiction book of the same title by David Grann, a staff writer at this magazine. Grann explores the quest for oil under Osage country, in Oklahoma, in the springtime of the twentieth century, and the auctions at which leases for drilling were purchased from Osage landowners. (A single lease could cost more than a million dollars.) In 1920, one reporter, describing the newfound Osage wealth, proclaimed, “Something will have to be done about it.” What was done is soon revealed in the film, as vintage stills of the Osage, posed in their finery or in resplendent automobiles, make way for other images, composed by Scorsese with equal calm: dead bodies of the Osage, viewed from above, laid out on their beds. A voice-over gives their names and their ages, adding, “No investigation.” If they are being murdered, nobody seems to mind.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Grann ranges wider, in time and in territory, than Scorsese is able to do. The book arrives at the dire proposition that there was “a culture of killing,” with Osage victims numbering in the hundreds, many of them missing from official estimates. As often as not, they were slain for their “headrights,” shares in the mineral trust of the tribe. (Were an Osage woman to meet with an unfortunate accident, or succumb to a puzzling illness, her rights would pass to her nearest and dearest—a grieving white husband, say.) Grann homes in on a bunch of characters in and around the towns of Gray Horse and Fairfax, and Scorsese does the same. We meet an elderly Osage widow named Lizzie (Tantoo Cardinal) and her daughters, Mollie (Lily Gladstone), Minnie (Jillian Dion), Rita (Janae Collins), and Anna (Cara Jade Myers). Then, there is William Hale (Robert De Niro), a cattle owner, prosperous and genial; he cultivates warm relations with the Osage and speaks their language. No one could accuse him of modesty. “Call me King,” he declares. Hale has a nephew, Ernest Burkhart (Leonardo DiCaprio), who is not long back from the First World War. He served with distinction as a cook.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;You may be wondering who, of all these folk, will be the lodestone. For Grann, it&#39;s Tom White, who, in 1925, was sent by J. Edgar Hoover, of the Bureau of Investigation (the forerunner of the FBI), to delve into the Osage deaths. White cuts a genuinely heroic figure, upright and just, and his sleuthing guides us surely through the skeins of evidence. He shows up in the movie, too, but not for a long while, and—although he&#39;s well played, with a courteous tenacity, by Jesse Plemons—in no way does he bind events together onscreen as he does on the page. Instead, bewilderingly, it is Ernest Burkhart whose fortunes we are invited to follow. Huh? This dumb dolt, with bran for brains? Why should &lt;em>;he&lt;/em>; take center stage?&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Early in the film, Burkhart has a talk with his uncle, who asks whether he is fond of women. “That&#39;s my weakness,” Burkhart replies. “You like red?” Hale inquires, and we realize that he wants to marry Burkhart off to an Osage woman, like an aunt in Jane Austen trying to hitch an unpromising nephew to a local heiress. The slight difference is that very few aunts in Regency England, as a rule, arranged to have notable persons bumped off with poisoned hooch or shot in the back of the head. Hale doesn&#39;t merely hope for Osage lucre in the long run; he wants it now, by whatever means necessary. “If you&#39;re going to make trouble,” he says, “make it big.” Everything to come is foretold in this conversation. Burkhart does indeed court Mollie and make her his wife, to the satisfaction of his scheming uncle and to the detriment, I would argue, of suspense. Somehow the very appearance of De Niro, in a Scorsese film, is enough to give away the plot.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The loyalty of directors to their actors is a noble trait, and often a highly productive one. Think of the troupe that rotated around Ingmar Bergman, shifting between major and minor stints; in 1957, Max von Sydow was a medieval knight, bestriding “The Seventh Seal,” and then a gas-station attendant, in “Wild Strawberries.” No less faithful, Scorsese (who used von Sydow in 2010, in “Shutter Island”) has turned repeatedly to De Niro and DiCaprio, and some of the results have been stupendous.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;DiCaprio, however, is a curious specimen. The more agonized the roles into which Scorsese has plunged him, in films like “Gangs of New York” (2002) and “The Departed” (2006), the less DiCaprio has been at liberty to flourish his prime asset—namely, his boyishness. He strikes me as a perennial kid, adrift in a land of grownups, and only truly at ease when he can lark around. That&#39;s why his best and his most believable performance was back in 2002, in “Catch Me if You Can,” directed by Steven Spielberg, whose casting eye is unrivalled, and who spied the essential lightness in DiCaprio. Scorsese, on the other hand, has strained to drag him into the dark. If their happiest collaboration is in “The Wolf of Wall Street” (2013), it is because, for once, the actor&#39;s puckish vagaries are not reined in. Scorsese loosens the leash.&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;I would love to report that DiCaprio is rejuvenated by “Killers of the Flower Moon.” Sadly not. He does get to banter with De Niro, during a car ride, but listen to the topic under discussion: the killing of an Osage man, Henry Roan (William Belleau), which was meant to resemble a suicide but went awry. We can&#39;t help laughing along with Hale and Burkhart, as if they were two goons in a Scorsese Mob movie; meanwhile, the thought of poor Roan gets lost in the mix. Such is the dilemma that weighs upon this film. Although its moral ambition is to honor the tribulations of an Indigenous people, it keeps getting pulled back into the orbit—emotional, social, and eventually legal—of white men. Mollie is diabetic, and Burkhart gradually suspects that the insulin injections he is giving her may be doctored; yet the focus remains more on his clenched and frowning perplexity than on her wasting away.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;More than once, Mollie refers to herself as “incompetent.” This is not a joke but a formal term, which the film, for some reason, never bothers to define; many Osage were considered ill-suited to handling their own funds, which had to be administered by a white guardian. Yet it &lt;em>;is&lt;/em>; a joke, as dark as oil, because Lily Gladstone, as Mollie, is unmistakably the most compelling presence in the movie. Her gait is dignified and unrushed, her humor is vented in a high and lovely yelp, and her smile is deliciously knowing and slow—so knowing, in fact, that it&#39;s hard to imagine what Mollie sees in Burkhart, whom she calls a coyote. It&#39;s not as if she&#39;s blind to his basic motive. “Coyote wants money,” she says. All of her sisters make their mark; Myers, especially, does a wonderful job as Anna, who is handsome, wanton, fiery, and fatally drawn to the bottle. But Mollie is at the core of the family, and Scorsese, to be fair, does her proud with a scene in which a crowd of onlookers, gathered near a corpse that has been found by a river, parts in silent respect to let Mollie through. The camera takes the part of the bereaved.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;If you relish that kind of staging—people being shifted, smoothly or brutally, around the frame, the better to boost the narrative sway—then Scorsese, aged eighty, is still the guy you need. Check out the sequence, for example, in which a wanted man is arrested. He sits in a barber&#39;s chair, in the foreground; when lawmen enter from the street, behind him, we notice them well before he does. Even as they draw close, he stays put, making no effort to scuffle or scarper, and that simple quiescence proves that his hour of reckoning comes as no surprise. Hell, it might just be a relief.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Killers of the Flower Moon” is rife with such passages of action and inaction, in tune with its symphonic stateliness. Themes of oppression, vengeance, and resistance are developed and recapitulated throughout, and there&#39;s also a strange coda, in which Scorsese himself turns up. He plays an announcer on an old-school radio drama, which retells the saga of the Osage murders, complete with cheesy sound effects. Needless to say, the heroes of the show are Hoover&#39;s boys from the Bureau. Is Scorsese claiming that, in contrast to this low-rent travesty, he has reclaimed the original terrors of the case; or is he, more humbly, confessing that his film is just one more version of a tragedy that can never be fully fathomed or explained? Next time, perhaps, an Osage voice will tell the tale anew. ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;ibfj&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot;

From the 1949 screwball comedy “Adam&#39;s Rib,” in which a husband and wife&#39;s careers become a source of conflict, to the 1979 legal drama “Kramer vs. Kramer,” which reflected new cultural attitudes about divorce, fictional couples have long been tasked with working through the biggest social issues of the day. In the wake of the #MeToo movement, a different dynamic has emerged onscreen—one in which the woman holds the reins of the relationship. On this episode of Critics at Large, the staff writers Vinson Cunningham, Naomi Fry, and Alexandra Schwartz discuss two new films in which traditional gender roles are flipped: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-new-yorker-interview/the-problem-of-the-too-truthful-woman&quot;>;Justine Triet&lt;/a>;&#39;s “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/the-current-cinema/10/16/anatomy-of-a-fall-movie-review&quot;>;Anatomy of a Fall&lt;/a>;,” which won the Palme d&#39;Or at this year&#39;s Cannes Film Festival, and “Fair Play,” the début feature from the director Chloe Domont, now streaming on Netflix. The hosts consider the rise of the “good bad man”: a well-intentioned partner whose feminist politics collapse when real power is at stake. “This is a moment when people say they want equality, and they may even feel that they want equality,” Schwartz says. “But there is some kind of cultural consensus that men are not really able to do it, because they keep getting slammed in movies like this.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;New episodes drop every Thursday.
