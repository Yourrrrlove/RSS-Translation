的所在地maritozzi 奶油面包；Rimessa Roscioli，一家时尚的、以葡萄酒为主的餐厅。如果您曾到过这些地点中的任何一个朝圣，您很可能会遇到一大群其他游客遵循类似的建议。你们所有人都排在一起，追求被称为罗马最好的披萨、最好的萨鲁梅里亚、最好的意大利面。我从未去过罗马，所以我无法衡量这一努力的价值，但现在罗西奥利来到了纽约。尽管 Resy 上的牌桌竞争非常激烈，但该街区目前还没有人排队。&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;GenericCallout&quot;>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;Roscioli&lt;/strong>;&lt;br/>;43 MacDougal圣&lt;br/>;&lt;em>;品尝菜单 130 美元；单点菜肴 $8-$60&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;New York Roscioli 是 Rimessa Roscioli 的首席侍酒师 Alessandro Pepe 与纽约市侍酒师 Ariel Arce 的合作项目餐馆老板拥有提供葡萄酒的诀窍——这种技巧即使在最精彩的时候，也总是至少有百分之三十的乏味——以一种让人感觉紧迫和充满活力的方式。在她现已关闭的 SoHo 餐厅 Niche Niche 中，该餐厅占据了 Roscioli 现在的位置，Arce 坚持“晚餐派对”的形式，每晚为食客提供食物和葡萄酒搭配的套餐，价格极其实惠。 ，展示了特定的制作人、地区或主题。著名的侍酒师会过来展示稀有的精选酒，传奇的酒窖会因为周三而遭到搜查，而且这是纽约，为什么不呢？这酒很棒，但更重要的是，它是为你精心挑选的，这让它失去了恐吓的力量，剩下的只是纯粹的享受。 2021 年，Niche Niche 招待 Rimessa Roscioli 举办了为期一周的罗马主题晚餐，从那时起，双方的合作关系就诞生了。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;新 Roscioli 的楼下餐厅继续着整个葡萄酒浸泡的晚餐-派对氛围。当你到达餐桌时，服务员会立即递上一杯饮料，然后是一系列预定的菜肴，以及与之相配的意大利葡萄酒。 （每人一百三十美元，这仍然是一个几乎令人眼花缭乱的便宜货。）在最近的一次访问中，开场菜是panzanella——半烤的西红柿，将其味道浓缩成让人想起夏末酒神般的甜蜜。 。它和一堆切得很薄的熟香肠一起落在桌子上，还有一个盘子，上面有一块乳状的布拉塔奶酪，上面浇着金色的橄榄油，上面还镶嵌着更多的浓缩番茄。 “我们从普利亚空运布拉塔奶酪，”我的服务员一边说，一边放下一盘奶酪，然后笑了起来。 “不，说真的，你能想象碳足迹吗？”罗马时期的罗西奥利 (Roscioli) 是意大利富饶的圣殿。在纽约，由于进口限制和物流不切实际，人们必须关注质量而不是来源。布拉塔奶酪像呼吸一样温暖，在我的刀下绽放成一条甜奶油河。这款酒是叶黄色的 Asprinio di Aversa，口感卷曲而尖锐，就像最好的搭配一样，它让桌上的所有东西都变得更好、更明亮、更有活力。&lt;/p>;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;feature-default&quot;

data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;上周，有些时刻——如果不是为了第一次——唐纳德·特朗普似乎失控了。周一，在新罕布什尔州德里的一次集会上，他将自己比作纳尔逊·曼德拉；说他必须把国家从法西斯主义者、马克思主义者、共产党人和“病人”手中拯救出来；模仿了与乔·拜登的打斗场面（“噗！噗！噗！我直接打在他的假鼻子上！”）；并继续抱怨在华盛顿特区的街道上看到六个月前的麦当劳集装箱“从事房地产行业，”他说，“我总是保持房产干净，我喜欢干净、干净、经营良好，你知道，tippy-top，我们说tippy-top。我们希望他们保持尖尖的状态。好吧，我们的首都与tippy-top相反！两天后，法官阿瑟·恩戈伦 (Arthur Engoron) 拒绝在一桩民事案件中做出对他有利的中期判决，指控他存在欺诈行为，他跺着脚走出了纽约市的法庭。夸大了他的顶级房产的估值。在休息期间，他告诉记者，法官是一名党派人士，“他旁边坐着一个非常党派的人”。恩戈隆的职员坐在他旁边。在《Truth Social》节目中，特朗普将她描述为参议院多数党领袖查克·舒默的女朋友，这一点令人难以置信。那篇帖子导致了一项狭隘的禁言令。现在，在恩戈隆的要求下，特朗普声称他所提到的“非常有党派色彩”的人实际上是他的前经纪人迈克尔·科恩，他当天正在作证；恩戈隆告诉特朗普他不可信，并罚款他一万美元。这是特朗普在华盛顿特区、佛罗里达州、佐治亚州和纽约面临的四起刑事案件的不光彩和怪异的前奏——检方最近在这些案件中获得了他的同案被告的四项认罪。 （他否认有任何不当行为。）&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;但特朗普在上周三的另一次法庭休息期间发表的评论表明，从一方面来看，他的控制力很强。 “昨天这个时候，没有人想到迈克，”他指的是路易斯安那州共和党众议员迈克·约翰逊。 “然后我们宣布了这一消息，现在他是众议院议长。”这是一个公平的说法。特朗普在许多问题上都存在妄想，但约翰逊奇怪的崛起表明他对自己对国会共和党人的控制力很清醒。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;共和党众议院核心小组过去似乎处于无政府状态。几个星期。 10 月 3 日，在众议员马特·盖茨 (Matt Gaetz) 策划的一场政变中，凯文·麦卡锡 (Kevin McCarthy) 被选为议长，表面上是因为他与民主党合作以保持政府开放；但这一策略可能只是盖茨表现出的自恋的产物。 （尽管盖茨否认了这一点，但这也可能是对即将进行的道德调查的反应，他将其描述为出于政治动机。）他似乎不知道谁可能取代麦卡锡——必须是一个彻底的特朗普主义者。&lt; /p>;&lt;p>;接下来是多数党领袖史蒂夫·斯卡利斯和司法委员会主席吉姆·乔丹之间的斗争，两人都属于特朗普阵营。斯卡利斯的职位更高，但显然他有一个敌人麦卡锡，原因与每个人的野心有关。乔丹在 2020 年大选后深入参与了特朗普保住权力的努力，特朗普对他表示认可，这有助于挫败斯卡利斯的竞选。然而，一些共和党人对乔丹犹豫不决。 there was talk of his being a bit too January 6th-associated for swing districts, but the real problem seems to have been his loud style and the thuggish approach his allies took to lobbying for votes.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;By the time Jordan was voted down, the dysfunction was embarrassing. Congress&#39;s inability to move forward on any legislation in the absence of a Speaker was causing concern internationally, leaving further aid for Ukraine and Israel (and for civilians in Gaza) uncertain. The trouble was that the Republicans&#39; next candidate, Tom Emmer, while being a Trump supporter, had voted to certify the 2020 election. He tried to make up for that last week by abasing himself before Trump. After Trump informed reporters that Emmer had “called me yesterday and told me, &#39;I&#39;m your biggest fan,&#39; ” Emmer hurried to post a video of the remarks on X, adding, “Thank you, Mr. President.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;It wasn&#39;t good enough. On Truth Social, Trump wrote, “I believe he has now learned his lesson, because he is saying that he is Pro-Trump all the way, but who can ever be sure? Has he only changed because that&#39;s what it takes to win?,” and he dismissed Emmer as a “Globalist RINO.” Emmer dropped out within hours. The message was that it is not sufficient to pay homage to Trump—you have to really feel it.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Mike Johnson seems to really feel it. He was elected as a freshman in 2016 and gained a foothold in the House by championing Trump on matters ranging from the would-be “Muslim ban” to the first impeachment trial, in which he was part of Trump&#39;s defense team. He spoke ecstatically about the President returning his calls, and got to fly on Air Force One. He, too, was involved in Trump&#39;s strategizing after the 2020 election, which Johnson suggested had been rigged with the help of Dominion voting machines—a thoroughly discredited conspiracy theory. Johnson rallied a hundred and twenty-five colleagues to sign on to an amicus-curiae brief in a case brought by Texas to invalidate the electoral votes of Michigan, Georgia, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. (The Supreme Court declined to hear it.) If the 2024 election is contested, one can imagine how Trump might insist on Johnson using the Speaker&#39;s gavel to help him.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Before running for office, Johnson was a lawyer for conservative Christian causes, and has written that he views homosexual relationships as unnatural. The climate crisis, on the other hand, is something he has presented as natural—not chiefly to be blamed on human activity. On Thursday, he told Sean Hannity that the issue with mass shootings was “not guns.” Supposedly, the Party was willing to elect him without a single dissenting vote because he is very friendly. But Johnson&#39;s affability is just another version of Jordan&#39;s irascibility or Gaetz&#39;s awfulness: a personal factor that fuels or settles squabbles within a closed, Trumpist circle.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Despite the spectacle of infighting, there is a sense in which the GOP has rarely been so unified—behind Trump. He may be the only thing that brings the Party together, even as he imbues it with his own brand of nihilism. The Speakership race is not the only Republican contest he has been in control of. He was in New Hampshire the day of the rally to file his paperwork for that state&#39;s Presidential primary. He&#39;s still more than forty points ahead of any other Republican candidate in national polls. ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;mea9ak&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;xqf3g&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 29 Oct 2023 19:06:01 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Jeanette Winterson Has No Idea What Happens Next]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-new-yorker-interview/jeanette-winterson-has-no-idea-what-happens-next]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-29T10:00:00.000Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653bd599f3b0833cc1d1b953/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/sullivan-jeanette%20winterson.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;article >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attribute-verso-pattern=&quot;article-body&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;ArticlePageChunks&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Jeanette Winterson burst onto the literary scene in 1985 with the publication of her début novel, “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Oranges-Are-Not-Only-Fruit-ebook/dp/B007I7STHO&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Oranges-Are-Not-Only-Fruit-ebook/dp/B007I7STHO&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Oranges-Are-Not-Only-Fruit-ebook/dp/B007I7STHO&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;Oranges Are Not the Only Fruit&lt;/a>;,” a fictional “retelling” of her childhood in a working-class Pentecostal family. Winterson&#39;s parents, who adopted her, raised her to be a missionary, a charismatic mouthpiece for a God she feared. The prodigious Mrs. Winterson beat and berated her, attempted to wall her off from all culture save the Bible, and then, upon discovering that her daughter was sleeping with a woman, cast her out of the house at sixteen. Winterson supported herself as a mortician&#39;s assistant, ice-cream-van driver, and aide in a psychiatric hospital while studying for her A-levels. After earning a degree in English from St. Catherine&#39;s College, in Oxford, she moved to London, where she took on more odd jobs. (In 1997, she disclosed that one of those jobs was not sex work, exactly, but servicing married women in hotel rooms; the housewives expressed their thanks in Le Creuset saucepans.)&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Oranges,” which was followed by the experimental novels “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Passion-Jeanette-Winterson-ebook/dp/B07CN7X4J4&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Passion-Jeanette-Winterson-ebook/dp/B07CN7X4J4&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Passion-Jeanette-Winterson-ebook/dp/B07CN7X4J4&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;The Passion&lt;/a>;,” in 1987, and “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Sexing-Cherry-Winterson-Jeanette-ebook/dp/B007I7SU8W&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Sexing-Cherry-Winterson-Jeanette-ebook/dp/B007I7SU8W&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Sexing-Cherry-Winterson-Jeanette-ebook/dp/B007I7SU8W&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;Sexing the Cherry&lt;/a>;,” in 1989, made Winterson a literary celebrity, a nervy, young, female alternative to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2009/02/23/the-background-hum&quot;>;Ian McEwan&lt;/a>; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/martin-amis-remembered-by-writers&quot;>;Martin Amis&lt;/a>;. Critics praised her pyrotechnic language, her lyrical attention to desire and emotion, her imagination, her exuberance. The journalist Angela Lambert &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/essays/55558/jeanette-winterson&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/essays/55558/jeanette-winterson&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/essays/55558/jeanette-winterson&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;wrote&lt;/a>; that the experimental early books maintained a “high standard of captivating originality, using words so that they played and shimmered like dolphins in a sunlit sea.” But she took issue with Winterson&#39;s “condescending, even intimidating tone” on the ground that “few critics . 。 。 care to be patronised by a working class lesbian from Accrington.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;At times, Winterson seemed ill-equipped to handle her own meteoric rise. She blustered: during a late-night television interview, she proclaimed herself the natural heir to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tag/virginia-woolf&quot;>;Virginia Woolf&lt;/a>;. Asked by the press to choose a “book of the year,” she chose her own. Asked to name her favorite living author, she named herself. She told a newspaper that her rhapsodic novel “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Written-Vintage-International-Jeanette-Winterson-ebook/dp/B00C0ALZSO&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Written-Vintage-International-Jeanette-Winterson-ebook/dp/B00C0ALZSO&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Written-Vintage-International-Jeanette-Winterson-ebook/dp/B00C0ALZSO&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;Written on the Body&lt;/a>;” had been inspired by her own affair with her married agent—outing the woman in question. Reviewers began to accuse her of involution, pretension, and self-entrancement. “She cannot resist making metaphors out of molehills,” the &lt;em>;Independent&lt;/em>; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/dot-com-dominatrix-625758.html&quot;>;declared&lt;/a>;. Her writing “has itself become steadily more impaired by her self-regard and insularity,” the &lt;em>;Spectator&lt;/em>; chided. In the &lt;em>;Times Book Review&lt;/em>;, William H. Pritchard &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/26/books/say-my-name-and-you-say-sex.html&quot;>;suggested&lt;/a>; that “her recent public pronouncements raise the possibility that, like the now wholly faded Dame Edith Sitwell (who did her bit for magic poetic realism), Ms. Winterson may turn out to belong more to the history of publicity than of literature.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Winterson moved from the city to the country. She gathered her friends, including the crime writer Ruth Rendell, the literary agent Philippa Brewster, and the actor Vicky Licorish, around her. She kept writing—historical fiction, a Shakespeare adaptation, a renovation of the “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/02/12/the-strange-and-twisted-life-of-frankenstein&quot;>;Frankenstein&lt;/a>;” plot, children&#39;s literature, and essays about art and culture. “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/PowerBook-Jeanette-Winterson/dp/0375725059&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/PowerBook-Jeanette-Winterson/dp/0375725059&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/PowerBook-Jeanette-Winterson/dp/0375725059&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;The PowerBook&lt;/a>;,” which came out in 2000, spliced Winterson&#39;s perennial themes—language, gender, adultery—with curiosity about the dawn of the Internet. Two decades later, she would extend this inquiry still further with an essay collection, “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/12-Bytes-Here-Where-Might/dp/0802160360&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/12-Bytes-Here-Where-Might/dp/0802160360&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/12-Bytes-Here-Where-Might/dp/0802160360&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;12 Bytes: How AI Will Change the Way We Live and Love&lt;/a>;.” Winterson made what seems in retrospect like her official comeback in 2011, publishing a memoir revisiting her childhood, “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Why-Happy-When-Could-Normal/dp/0802120873&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Why-Happy-When-Could-Normal/dp/0802120873&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Why-Happy-When-Could-Normal/dp/0802120873&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;Why Be Happy When You Could Be Normal?&lt;/a>;,” to readers&#39; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/25/books/review/jeanette-wintersons-new-memoir.html&quot;>;delight&lt;/a>;. If “Oranges” transfigured her painful upbringing, the new book stared unblinkingly at it, submitting yet more alterations to the record. Winterson&#39;s latest book, “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Night-Side-River-Jeanette-Winterson/dp/0802161510&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Night-Side-River-Jeanette-Winterson/dp/0802161510&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Night-Side-River-Jeanette-Winterson/dp/0802161510&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;Night Side of the River&lt;/a>;,” a collection of ghost stories, is out in time for Halloween.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;On Zoom, Winterson, who has been teaching creative writing at the University of Manchester since 2012, appeared in a glorious square of sunlight and foliage that turned out to be a window. She was in her house in the Gloucestershire countryside. She wore a snow-white button-down shirt, on which the top several buttons were rakishly unbuttoned. I found her to be kind, generous, open, and very funny, with a refreshing lack of interest in being anyone other than herself. Our conversation has been condensed and edited.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;Why ghost stories?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Two years ago, Substack, the platform, asked me to write a story every week for a month, which is hard. But they paid well, and, as they wanted me for November, I said, “Let&#39;s start on Halloween, shall we? And let&#39;s do ghosts.” And, as I was writing them, I thought, You know, I&#39;m really enjoying this, and maybe I will make this into a proper book.&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;The beauty of choosing a theme for a collection of short stories is that you get a very pleasing shape. With shorter forms, because there isn&#39;t time to develop very far with character, you have to be smart about the insights that you can offer, the small details that show who people are. It&#39;s good discipline, too, because short stories have to deliver. They need a beginning, middle, and end.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The other thing I wanted to do is to separate the supernatural from horror, because lately all of that has become conflated. My favorite ghost story is “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Christmas-Carol-Charles-Dickens/dp/1503212831&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Christmas-Carol-Charles-Dickens/dp/1503212831&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Christmas-Carol-Charles-Dickens/dp/1503212831&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;A Christmas Carol&lt;/a>;.” That story&#39;s joyful openheartedness, its munificence, its beneficence just delight me. I mean, there&#39;s this thing that writers are meant to be miserable and suffer, but no—you can have a good time. Dickens is playing with the idea that a ghost will intervene on your behalf and stop you from walking under that bus. It&#39;s a very seductive idea, isn&#39;t it?&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;I loved that about the collection. “No Ghost Ghost Story” is a sweet story that imagines ghosts as loved ones who keep looking out for us. Other stories are more high gothic, with villainous ghosts and garments that try to strangle you. And then there are creepy futuristic stories that seem almost like warnings. Was there a particular flavor of ghost story that you especially liked writing?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I was intrigued by what AI might do with our notions of being haunted, and I was playing around with the idea of the metaverse. If we did inhabit a credible digital space, an alternative, non-biological world where we went around as our avatars, we&#39;d be starting to negotiate how to avoid the hard boundary of death, which is all humans really want to do. In the metaverse, there&#39;s no reason why you should die, if your loved ones wished to keep your digital twin going.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;In [the story] “Ghost in the Machine,” I wanted to play with the idea that you might start to have a real relationship with an entity that is a program but is much more interesting than anybody you know in your biological world. Where would that logically take you? It would logically take you toward your own death.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;It was striking to me how AI converged with the ghostly in your stories, because to me they seem very different. Ghosts are aligned with the past, whereas AI feels related to the future.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I was brought up in a very religious house. Religion is so deeply sunk into the self for me that it cannot be separated. And so I&#39;m intrigued that the religious notion of the biological self as a temporary condition is now finding a new home in science and tech. They&#39;re saying “Well, yeah, [the biological self] is a temporary condition that you&#39;ll be able to sidestep through the creation of a digital self.” That&#39;s the promise of technology, and it&#39;s also the promise of religion, the first disrupter of death. And it amuses me to see the separation from the biological self that religion has always promised and foretold coming into vogue, coming into fashion, through the agency of Big Tech.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;Has your relationship to ghosts changed over time? Your upbringing was so devout.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Well, this is the trouble. Of course I believed in ghosts growing up because in my deeply religious household we expected to continue after death. But what was strange in our household was that I lived with two generations of traumatized adults. They wouldn&#39;t have called themselves that because nobody “in the war” ever did. It was only much later in life I realized that my grandparents and my parents had been in separate wars.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;z727zm&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;They damaged one another. And of course they were going to pass on the damage to the next generation because no one talked about it except in a lighthearted way. But what was striking was that they and all of their friends, without exception, when I was a young person, all had stories from their separate wars about seeing or having seen something, seeing it very clearly, or feeling that they had been visited. And this was not for questioning. It was simply offered. My father&#39;s story was of being guided to the one house on the street where he could have safely spent the night during an air raid, the one house that wasn&#39;t bombed, and then finding out that the person who sent him there had died months earlier. My father was a very simple man. He could barely read because he left school at fourteen. He wasn&#39;t looked after or cared for as a human, but he was a good man. He wasn&#39;t a storyteller. This was just something he offered as one of his wartime experiences.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;I appreciated the line in your book: “There is a valve, a pressure release, that comes with being able to say: &#39;I can&#39;t explain this.&#39; ”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;It&#39;s good for people in this world to say “I don&#39;t know. I don&#39;t know the answer.” When it comes to things that we can&#39;t explain, it&#39;s better to keep an open mind.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;During the pandemic, there was a resurgence of interest in the supernatural. It may have been because, for the first time, lots of people were quiet. They were receptive and open in a way that modern life doesn&#39;t allow. Everything is busy, noisy, brightly lit; people&#39;s days are managed. In the pandemic, perhaps you had that time to walk down a quiet road and not see anyone. That puts your mind into a different condition. And perhaps the mind needs to be in a different condition in order to receive certain things. If you&#39;re doing creative work, you have to move your mind out of its habitual executive function, its administrative mode, and to allow other things to come in, to allow patterns to emerge, to connect things in ways that are simply impossible when we&#39;re just formatting stuff.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;My friend, when I told him I was interviewing you about ghosts, sent me an essay that differentiated between the aesthetics of the spooky and the scary. What do you make of that distinction?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I prefer the spooky. I want to disconnect the supernatural from where it is lodged in horror. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tag/stephen-king&quot;>;Stephen King&lt;/a>;&#39;s great, but—I suppose we&#39;re always scared by what we can&#39;t understand and what we feel we have no weapons against. Because what do you do with something that&#39;s not a dimensional being? It can disappear at any moment. You can&#39;t grasp it and you can&#39;t follow it. You are passive in the encounter, and humans hate that. Maybe our ancestors were less frightened because they were more accustomed to the idea that there was a space where they did not have control. In a religious setting, for a religious person, you accept that you must surrender. You accept that there are limits to the human condition, and you accept the idea that you cannot know. You can&#39;t do ghosts by metrics. There&#39;s a parallel here with shape-shifting legends and fairy tales, where the genies can fit into tiny bottles or be three hundred feet tall. Once you get into the non-biological realm, the metrics don&#39;t work at all.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;It really is like the Internet.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The parallels with the Internet are great! I love it that you&#39;ll be able to have an avatar, which is not necessarily human, not the same gender as you are, and that you can have a kind of playfulness, if they don&#39;t fuck it up and make it all about selling stuff—which they will.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;I was struck by the number of queer and trans ghosts in the collection. It made me realize that my literary diet has been weirdly lacking in gay and gender-nonconforming ghosts.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Why?为什么？ Why should all ghosts be heterosexual?&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;I don&#39;t know!&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;They can&#39;t possibly follow the binary after death because it&#39;s a human construct. So that has to go. Ghosts appear as male or female because they need us to recognize them. That&#39;s why they wear clothes, I&#39;m sure. It&#39;s for us, our limited senses, the narrow spectrum that we live in. Our senses are really crude: our auditory senses, our visual senses. We&#39;re very limited persons.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;What is your personal relationship to the Internet like? Do you use social media?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I don&#39;t like social media, and I&#39;m horrified at the way it&#39;s gone. But I wouldn&#39;t want a world without Google. I do think tech is neutral. We are in charge and it&#39;s a tool. All it&#39;s doing is showing us in this larger-than-life form our own grossness and inadequacy. Whenever we invent something incredible, we make it into a tool of oppression.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;The tech bros always get the words wrong. They say that the chatbots are “hallucinating” when they give the wrong answer to a query. The machines are not hallucinating. They&#39;re machine-splaining. Because they were created by men.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;I wanted to ask you about ghosts and writing. Is there a connection?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I think you have to be open, to be receptive, in order to write. It&#39;s this business we were talking about earlier, how you get yourself into the right state of mind to allow new patterns to form, to allow new ideas to emerge, and to not start putting a formula on your work or trying to steer it in a particular direction—all the things that humans do. I&#39;m always saying this to my students: stop trying to stamp it with an identity too soon. Let it be and let yourself be.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;7352o&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;People are frightened of not producing in this obsessed world of continuous work. And they think that it&#39;s better to produce something mediocre than to produce nothing. It takes time to learn whether you&#39;re just bottoming out or whether you need this time for things to emerge in a different way. It&#39;s hard in our world not to throttle your ideas to death.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;It&#39;s a large part of why I prefer to live in the country. There&#39;s no one around me here and at night it&#39;s completely dark. I am alone. I don&#39;t particularly like bright lights. In the evening, it&#39;s very meditative. You can read, you can think, you can let your mind settle into a better space.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;You told the &lt;em>;Guardian&lt;/em>; in an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/books/2000/sep/02/fiction.jeanettewinterson&quot;>;interview&lt;/a>;, “There is still that self-consciousness in women, that they are women, which is hampering. It&#39;s very difficult to do good work if you&#39;re self-conscious.” I wonder if self-consciousness has anything to do with the creative negotiations you&#39;re talking about.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I think it does. Women are always clearing up and tidying up and fixing it up for their families, for the men in their lives, for their bosses in the workplace. And, at the same time, women are always worrying about their appearance. The female subject now, thanks to the Internet—she&#39;s under relentless scrutiny on social media. It&#39;s horrible and very hard, I think, to be able to shut that out and just get on with your own self. To put that away and think, No, this is my time. I&#39;m going to do my work in my own way. I&#39;m not going to worry about any of that. There are hugely powerful assumptions about what a woman is, what a woman is for. It&#39;s like gravity keeping you in your place. If you don&#39;t have something with which to push back against those assumptions, then it&#39;s extremely difficult to have the kind of self-confidence that comes from being able to leave the self behind to some degree.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;You&#39;ve been a young, creative, rule-breaking person in the public eye. What was that like? Was self-consciousness an issue for you?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Well, look. If you&#39;re a woman who wants to do anything other than be an attractive doormat, you&#39;re going to break the rules. Any woman who wants to do something for herself is already in a transgressive state as far as society and certainly religion are concerned. So we start from there. Then, when you&#39;ve crashed around and broken enough of the entry-level rules, you might as well start breaking a few more. You realize that all these things are propositional; they were invented and not by you and not really for your well-being.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Yes, I was self-conscious. But there was no social media. There were only three TV channels. I live in England. Distractions were few. I was in a poor northern town. There was lots of time to think. I had the best life possible, I believe, for where I am now, in that it was intense, and it allowed a kind of dimensionality that wouldn&#39;t have been there otherwise. And it gave me—because I didn&#39;t feel I belonged, no adopted person ever does—a kind of resilience, and the determination to find out if I might belong somewhere or how I would make a world. Because clearly the one I was in was bonkers.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Being adopted is like coming into the show after the curtain goes up, it&#39;s like starting the book after the first chapter. You always feel that there&#39;s something missing, and that you might as well write the story yourself because the story you&#39;ve been given is so hopeless. That is a great driver forward. The most important thing that happened to me was a realization when I was sixteen that came out of nowhere as I was walking home one night from the library where I had to do all my reading because I couldn&#39;t take books home. And I thought, if I can read myself as fiction, as well as fact, then I can get out of here. Because I realized that I could rewrite it; it was as simple and as powerful as that. I thought, I don&#39;t have to be in their story. If I&#39;m fiction, I can be my own character, which is why I became my own character in my first novel, “Oranges Are Not the Only Fruit.” It was such a mistake [for reviewers] to see that as an autobiography. It wasn&#39;t. It was me writing myself out of where I had been and writing myself into a place where I could be. That was the huge freedom of it. If we understand that our self-state is actually provisional, changeable, and propositional—that we make it up as we go along—we have much more flexibility and much more freedom than we think we do.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;But then you went back, in 2011, and wrote an actual autobiography, “Why Be Happy When You Could Be Normal?”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I discovered some information I hadn&#39;t had before, about my biological mother. I needed to revisit the material in the light of where I was then, twenty-seven years later. I didn&#39;t know where I was going with it. I simply set off. And after two weeks I&#39;d written fifteen thousand words of “Why Be Happy,” which told me that there was enormous internal pressure to do this, a great geyser from inside. I didn&#39;t show it to anyone before I finished it. I had not expected to arrive there. That&#39;s why the last line of the book is “I have no idea what happens next.”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;7jmaup&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;My core belief is that we don&#39;t know what happens next. But we can take control of our narrative, which isn&#39;t about the kind of me-first individualism that has so marred our civic or communal life and that I abhor. It&#39;s not about unthinking, unreflecting selfishness. It is about how you know your own story at a deep level and how you then proceed to tell it, whether or not you ever publish a book. Are you somebody who likes to play it for laughs? Somebody who wants the audience, who wants the approval, who needs to dramatize your life at every turn? Or can you find the urtext of who you are and be at least the co-author of that, while recognizing the other voices that made you as a younger person?&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;And then the question becomes: What can you do? Can you treat your story as something that can be moved, that can be changed? I love working with texts and changing them, whether my own or other people&#39;s. That sense of liveliness that happens when the thing isn&#39;t fixed and it isn&#39;t final. It&#39;s so hideous, these ideas about the Bible or the Quran, that they are fixed and final texts. Fucking originalists. Give me a break. We&#39;re not where we were in 1787—is that when the US Constitution was written?&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;Nailed it.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;It was great for the time, and we get the spirit of it. But what&#39;s more important, the spirit or the letter? If you&#39;re doing creative work, you already know that it&#39;s the spirit, the thing that must move through and continue to refresh itself as humanity does.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;You&#39;re talking about writing for your life and about telling your own story as a kind of catharsis or liberation. But it strikes me that publishing your “corrected” version of yourself might be painful. You&#39;re giving the people you wished to convince an opportunity to push back or say that it wasn&#39;t like that.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Look, it&#39;s endless. One of the reasons that I&#39;ve come to this place of peace, relative peace, after nearly forty years is because I have been through all the possible cycles of rejection, rage, hostility, denial, personal attacks, and just mean-mindedness. Everything that you can possibly get thrown at you as a writer, I have had thrown at me. Some of it was about my sexuality, my gender, my class. Some of it was about my attitude. It was very vicious for a long time. But anybody who stands up and says “This is how I&#39;m going to tell it” is going to get hit. You have to accept that there will be disappointment and difficulty and that there will be misunderstanding. And it doesn&#39;t matter because hopefully, as you continue, you&#39;ll find that people have started to come to the work, different bits of it, and to find something for themselves to take away and use as a building block in their own work.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;Do you have any opinions about trends in contemporary literature that you would like to share?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;We&#39;ve had an upsurge of women writing about their experience. This is an excellent thing. It&#39;s necessary, and it is to be appreciated and applauded.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I find it quite boring. But that&#39;s only because I&#39;m most interested in a kind of imaginative response to the world, rather than a verbatim response. When I was a young reader, I gravitated much more toward the European tradition than the Anglo-American. “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Invisible-Cities-Italo-Calvino/dp/0156453800&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Invisible-Cities-Italo-Calvino/dp/0156453800&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Invisible-Cities-Italo-Calvino/dp/0156453800&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;Invisible Cities&lt;/a>;,” by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/03/06/the-worlds-of-italo-calvino&quot;>;Italo Calvino&lt;/a>;, is one of my favorite books, just as I love those stories that fold into other stories, like “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Arabian-Nights-New-Deluxe/dp/0393331660&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Arabian-Nights-New-Deluxe/dp/0393331660&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Arabian-Nights-New-Deluxe/dp/0393331660&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;The Arabian Nights&lt;/a>;,” more than what we might call social realism or the new realism. But I am not here to sit in judgment. I want to embrace and encourage anybody out there who has a particular way that they need to work. We&#39;re too critical in the wrong ways. I have a rule with book reviewing that, if I can&#39;t find more to say about the book than some carping about what I don&#39;t like, I just send it back. Someone else will do a better job. The writer deserves better. And I&#39;m probably missing the point.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;That&#39;s very gracious of you.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Because I was messing around in the supernatural, and because &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/10/17/the-haunted-mind-of-shirley-jackson&quot;>;Shirley Jackson&lt;/a>; has had such a renaissance, and because I hadn&#39;t read very much apart from “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Always-Castle-Penguin-Classics-Deluxe/dp/0143039970&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Always-Castle-Penguin-Classics-Deluxe/dp/0143039970&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Always-Castle-Penguin-Classics-Deluxe/dp/0143039970&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;We Have Always Lived in the Castle&lt;/a>;” and “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Haunting-Hill-House-Penguin-Classics/dp/0143039989&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Haunting-Hill-House-Penguin-Classics/dp/0143039989&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Haunting-Hill-House-Penguin-Classics/dp/0143039989&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;The Haunting of Hill House&lt;/a>;,” I thought that I&#39;d better go in there and have a look. I read it all and popped out the other side and I thought, This reëvaluation is not just. She is not very good. Then, lo and behold, I read &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2002/09/30/the-prophet-of-decline&quot;>;Harold Bloom&lt;/a>;, whom I kind of love, although he was maddening, and, bless him, he&#39;d decided to go on the same odyssey and had come to the same conclusion. There were so many tantalizing possibilities in her. If only she&#39;d been freer. Because some of the writing is gorgeous and she can&#39;t sustain it.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;When I do my courses with my students, I teach things that I don&#39;t particularly like or enjoy. I tell the kids “Read as widely as you can. Get as much inside you as you possibly can. Don&#39;t judge it too quickly. Learn why it interests you and why you get mad at something, why you get bored.”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;iygb67&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;For example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2007/08/20/blows-against-the-empire&quot;>;Philip K. Dick&lt;/a>; is a terrible writer, sentence by sentence. Something like that can be useful for students to see. We look at the sentence and we say, “Don&#39;t do that.” But then we look at the whole story and think, Yeah, but it works.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;That, too, is part of the creative process and part of what people have to offer. People come back up in time for a while and then they disappear into the waters again, into the darkness, because they&#39;re not relevant for a particular generation of readers, and then somebody else will find them. And that seems to me to be perfectly all right as well: that things should disappear, then return, be in vogue for a while, then off they go again.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;I&#39;ve read several interviews in which you describe yourself as “happy.” You&#39;ve cast it in the past as something integral or defining about your temperament. It surprised me because I don&#39;t think of “happy” as a stable characteristic.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I&#39;m an enthusiast. I&#39;m not at all a cool girl. There are very many earnest young women at the moment, because young women who are creative feel that they need to be earnest. And all I would like to say is that you don&#39;t. You&#39;re allowed to make jokes. Men don&#39;t worry about being funny or serious. They think they&#39;re always serious even when they&#39;re being funny and at the same time they always think they&#39;re being funny when they&#39;re not. But, as usual, women separate themselves off from many possibilities in order to be taken seriously.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;As for happiness, I think the Americans were nearly right about it being a pursuit. But it&#39;s not quite a pursuit. It&#39;s more like an emergent property, like consciousness, and it comes out of a sense of meaning. For me, that&#39;s very important. I have to feel—and it may be my religious background—I have to feel, above all, that this is a life of service. You build the things in your life that matter. It&#39;s like having a 3-D printer. You build it layer by layer, and in the end you&#39;ve got a rocket ship. It&#39;s incremental and you can make it out of mushroom fibre, if you&#39;d like.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;So you do it layer by layer and you don&#39;t worry so much about where it&#39;s going to lead. With friendships, you go on putting the work in—you try to be a good friend, you try to show up, and then gradually you realize that you&#39;re building something that is both high and deep. That is very sustaining. It&#39;s these really quite old-fashioned core values that I think allow for a level of happiness such that even when things are difficult, as they must be in every life, even when we&#39;re struggling either existentially or in a practical way, we still have these things that we have built ourselves and that are solid. We can find genuine comfort there, which is not escapism or a delusion.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Back to this business of rules, you don&#39;t have to play by anyone else&#39;s rules, but you do have to play by your own. And, when you&#39;ve worked out what they are, just stick with them. Then you have self-respect, which is not the same as being self-conscious or self-involved. And that really does matter. Self-respect gives you boundaries about what you will and won&#39;t do. It also allows you to be generous, allows you to say yes as well as no. And it means that, even if you do something that in the short term makes you deeply unhappy or that you find deeply difficult, you know why you&#39;ve done it—it might be getting out of a bad relationship or saying goodbye to a job that is actually destroying you.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;So often people imagine that when they make the right decision they will feel better. Ninety-nine times out of one hundred they will feel worse. When we do make these big changes, often it&#39;s really disorienting. There can be a rush of euphoria, and then it&#39;s hard, hard, hard. I think that&#39;s not often enough said. At that point, we can&#39;t look for happiness. We have to go back to the core values from which happiness will emerge again, in the fullness of time. ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 29 Oct 2023 19:06:01 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Grief and Rage in Israel and Gaza]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/11/06/israel-gaza-war-hamas]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-28T10:00:00.000Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653c17c3f3b0833cc1d1ba4a/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/231106_r43278.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;article >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attribute-verso-pattern=&quot;article-body&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;ArticlePageChunks&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;figure data-testid=&quot;IframeEmbed&quot; >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;IframeEmbedContainer&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;iframe height=&quot;90&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; sandbox=&quot;allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups&quot; title=&quot;Embedded Frame&quot; src=&quot;https://audm.herokuapp.com/player-embed?pub=newyorker&amp;amp;articleID=65393259bca6913fb19e8247&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay *;加密媒体*；剪贴板写入；自动播放;全屏; picture-in-picture&quot;>;&lt;/iframe>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;p >;The only way to tell this story is to try to tell it truthfully and to know that you will fail.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;On the evening of Wednesday, October 18th, with the entire Middle East in a state of mourning and outrage, I took a taxi to the information offices of the Israel Defense Forces, a heavily guarded compound in northwest Tel Aviv. Like many reporters, I&#39;d accepted an invitation to see video evidence of the worst massacre of Jews in generations, certainly in the history of Israel—Hamas&#39;s rampage through Kibbutz Kfar Aza, Kibbutz Be&#39;eri, and other communities near the Gaza Strip, extending to an outdoor electronic-music festival, Nova. At last count, the attack throughout what Israelis call Otef Aza—“the Gaza envelope”—had claimed some fourteen hundred lives; thousands were wounded, and around two hundred and twenty people had been kidnapped and taken to the Gaza Strip. Hamas gave the operation a name, the Al-Aqsa Flood.&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;The roads in Israel were nearly as empty as they are on Yom Kippur. The only thing that might slow you down was a siren, a warning that a rocket was headed north out of Gaza toward Tel Aviv and other cities. This happened multiple times a day. The protocol, known to everyone, was that you pull over, get out, lie flat on the road, cover your head, and wait a few minutes before moving on. I hadn&#39;t been in the country three hours before I was under an overpass on Highway 20, waiting it out. The usual commercial signage along the highway had been transformed, seemingly overnight. No Coke Zero, no Toyota. Now the billboards blared assertions of unity—“Together We&#39;ll Win”—and calls for the return of the hostages. Their photographs were everywhere. Earlier that day, the American President had arrived to meet with the Israeli Prime Minister. And, having delivered a message of ardent support flecked with notes of caution against being consumed with rage and making the kinds of catastrophic mistakes that the United States made in the wake of 9/11, the President was in the air again, headed back to Washington.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The night before, in Tel Aviv at a friend&#39;s house for dinner, I received a series of WhatsApp messages from Mosab Abu Toha, a thirty-year-old poet who lives with his wife and children in Beit Lahia, in northern Gaza. Lately, he&#39;s been staying with relatives in the Jabalia refugee camp, about a mile and a half away. Born in the Al-Shati refugee camp, in Gaza City, he left the Strip for the first time four years ago. He ended up studying for a master&#39;s of fine arts in poetry, at Syracuse University. Now Mosab, in one-sentence bursts, was saying that the Al-Ahli Arab Hospital, in Zeitoun, a southern district of Gaza City, had been bombed by Israeli warplanes: “God help us.” He sent images—first of a burning building and a prostrate man, presumably dead, in the street—and he relayed reports of body counts:&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Between 200 and 300 got killed.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Then: “More than 500 were killed in the hospital.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Then: “More than 800.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Then: “It&#39;s now 1,115 people killed in the bombing of the hospital in Gaza.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;He was not claiming authority or proximity to the hospital but conveying the alarm on his own social networks. Later, Mosab sent a photograph of a dead baby cradled in the gloved hands of a medical worker. “Sorry to send this,” he added as a caption, “but this is one victim in the hospital&#39;s massacre.”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;GenericCallout&quot;>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;The remains of a body lie on the ground near a destroyed residence.

The conversation went on at a very high pitch. As we ate, there were, as there had been night after night, echoing booms: rockets from Gaza. People paused, listened for a moment, and continued eating. These rockets, they had clearly judged, did not warrant a trip to the &lt;em>;mamad&lt;/em>;, the reinforced safe room downstairs. Whether to seek shelter has long been a matter of expertise and routine. Later, some people wandered from the table to flip between Channels 12 and 13 on Israeli television. News anchors were now sharing statements from Israeli government sources denying that Israel had fired a missile or dropped a bomb anywhere near the hospital; in fact, they said, the responsibility for the disaster lay with Palestinian Islamic Jihad, an armed group that is smaller than Hamas but no less militant. It was a failed rocket launch, they said. Hours later, American intelligence agencies declared that their information was in accord with the Israeli assessment.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;When I asked Mosab what he thought of the denials, he answered, “No one believes them.” He criticized as “unfair” President Biden&#39;s statement suggesting that Israel wasn&#39;t responsible, and added, “Well, what if it were?” WhatsApp messages kept my phone vibrating. “It was responsible for past massacres at schools,” Mosab wrote. “What did the American Administration do in response?”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;tx1467&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Like every Gazan his age, Mosab had lived through countless air assaults. One day when he was eight and out shopping for dinner, he looked up and saw an Apache helicopter fire into a high-rise. This was at the start of the second intifada, in 2000. Since then, he&#39;s lost friends and relatives; funerals and rubble are fixtures of life for him and his neighbors. When he was sixteen, in the midst of what the Israelis called Operation Cast Lead, he was hit in the head, neck, and shoulder with shrapnel during a bombing.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Mosab was not inclined to defer to the intelligence assessments of the Israelis, any more than Israeli officials were apt to accept discussions of the blockade of Gaza and the occupation of the West Bank as “context” for the massacres in the south. There were, of course, facts—many of them unknown—but the narratives came first, all infused with histories and counter-histories, grievances and fifty varieties of fury, all rushing in at the speed of social media. People were going to believe what they needed to believe. And so, while the Israelis and their allies were relieved by the intelligence reports of a disastrous misfire by Islamic Jihad, the Palestinians and most of the Arab world were having none of it. The funerals went on. The Israeli bombing of Gaza—with thousands dead, hospitals at the brink of collapse, infrastructure crumbling—intensified. So did the mobilization for an Israeli ground offensive. There were skirmishes between Israel and Hezbollah on Israel&#39;s border with Lebanon, threats from the ayatollahs in Iran, American warships in the eastern Mediterranean.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The cab dropped me off at the IDF compound in Ramat Aviv. A soldier in a guard booth shoved aside an aluminum container of takeout macaroni, inspected my passport, and took me up to the second floor. I entered a large open-plan room filled with young officers and younger soldiers working intently at their phones and laptops, delivering the Israeli position to media around the world. For a week, their priority had been to make sure that everyone knew about the atrocities in Otef Aza. Now the task was to put out intelligence on the hospital bombing and, no less essential, to slam the foreign media, whose early push alerts and headlines had blamed Israel. “For the last ten days, we have been continuously asked about whether children were beheaded, not only murdered,” one reservist, Yair Zivan, who is a diplomatic adviser to the former Prime Minister Yair Lapid, told me. “Yesterday, these same news outlets didn&#39;t wait for one moment before reporting that Israel was responsible for the bombing of the hospital. Where does that come from?”&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;a data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a27113&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a27113&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;“Whoa whoa Where do you two think youre going”&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/653c1817f3b0833cc1d1ba4c/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/231106_a27113.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/653c1817f3b0833cc1d1ba4c/master/w_120,c_limit/231106_a27113.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/653c1817f3b0833cc1d1ba4c/master/w_240,c_limit/231106_a27113.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/653c1817f3b0833cc1d1ba4c/master/w_320,c_limit/231106_a27113.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/653c1817f3b0833cc1d1ba4c/master/w_640,c_limit/231106_a27113.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/653c1817f3b0833cc1d1ba4c/master/w_960,c_limit/231106_a27113.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/653c1817f3b0833cc1d1ba4c/master/w_1280,c_limit/231106_a27113.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/653c1817f3b0833cc1d1ba4c/master/w_1600,c_limit/231106_a27113.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/a>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;“Whoa, whoa!

There were three bowls of snacks—peanuts, walnuts, and sugar cookies—and complimentary IDF notebooks. Across a table sat two men: Amnon Shefler, a lieutenant colonel and a senior IDF spokesman, and, hunched over a laptop, Mattan Harel-Fisch, who had compiled video of the massacre from closed-circuit security cameras, from GoPro cameras and cell phones that the Hamas gunmen used to record what they did, and from social-media clips posted by both Hamas and its Israeli victims. The compilation he was about to show was forty-three minutes long. But, Harel-Fisch said, there was endless material: “I am now making a second movie.” The video would be shown on a flat-screen on the wall to my right.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;The officers were more than aware that they would be accused of propagandizing. They did not much care. As Anshel Pfeffer, a columnist for &lt;em>;Haaretz&lt;/em>;, had written a few days before, what took place on the morning of the 7th was “the greatest massacre of any Jewish community in the historic Land of Israel since the Middle Ages.” Demands for vengeance were commonplace.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;And yet who would prevent another march of folly? Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had always fancied himself his country&#39;s Churchill and kept a framed portrait of Britain&#39;s wartime leader near his desk, next to one of Theodor Herzl, the founder of modern Zionism. In speeches against appeasement, Netanyahu quoted his hero on the “confirmed unteachability of mankind.” But Churchill, for all his flaws, did not bring a collection of messianic zealots into his cabinet; he did not lead a country while being under criminal indictment; he did not leave the security of the state vulnerable to bulldozers and armed men on motorcycles.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Netanyahu has been heckled by reservists and vilified in the press. A poll published in the newspaper &lt;em>;Ma&#39;ariv&lt;/em>; six days after the massacre showed that forty-eight per cent of Israelis preferred that Benny Gantz, a phlegmatic retired Army general and a centrist politician who was brought into a new unity government, lead the country; only twenty-nine per cent preferred Netanyahu. The same paper also reported that eighty per cent of Israelis wanted Netanyahu to take responsibility for the security failures on October 7th, as leaders of the IDF and the Shin Bet, the country&#39;s internal security service, had done. Netanyahu, who cannot bear to express repentance or regret for his government&#39;s failure, or even to show compassion for the bereaved—something that, many Israelis noted, Biden was able to do—is unlikely to step down or step back.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Harel-Fisch said that the footage was horrifying. There would be extended clips of stalking, shootings, abductions, torched houses, burned corpses, terrorized children, dead children, dead infants, mutilation, jubilation. Before the viewing started, Shefler wanted to make one last point. He had just come back from a stint in the US, studying at the Kennedy School of Government, at Harvard. He said that he found his fellow-students “frozen” when it came to discussing the Israeli-Palestinian issue, scared to get into its history lest the discussion go sideways. But while the shades of gray were important, he went on, there were times when “some things are black and some things are white.”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;ae63ti&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Shefler excused himself and left the room. Harel-Fisch turned out the lights. He tapped a key on his laptop and the horror show began.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The night flight from JFK to Ben Gurion Airport, six days earlier, was packed. On the El Al check-in line, a complicated security process even under normal circumstances, the passenger behind me, a man of late middle age, had perched on his suitcase what appeared to be a shrink-wrapped machine gun. I stopped worrying about the tube of toothpaste in my carry-on.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“What is your business in Israel?” the security person asked.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I landed in time for dinner with friends outside Tel Aviv on Friday. Later that night, Avichai Brodutch, a father of three, from Kibbutz Kfar Aza, was trying to sleep at his parents&#39; apartment south of Tel Aviv. Brodutch is forty-two, an exceedingly modest man, a grower of pineapples who had turned to studying nursing. In the dark of his room that night, he stared at the ceiling; as he told me the next day, his mind was “spinning.” He&#39;d taken half a Klonopin. It did him no good. His wife, Hagar, and his children—Ofri, Yuval, and Uriah—were hostages in the Gaza Strip.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Early on the morning of October 7th, Hamas fighters swarmed the lush grounds of Kfar Aza. According to documents recovered by the IDF, they carried accurate maps of their targets and detailed battle plans: “The subordinate cell advances with the securing forces. 。 。 。 They must shoot down as many victims as possible, take hostages and take some of them to the Gaza Strip using various cars.” After roughly two years of planning, the fighters—led by members of the Nukhba, élite forces of the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades—breached the border fence around Gaza, and more than fifteen hundred of them sped toward the kibbutzim, on motorcycles, in pickup trucks with mounted machine guns. Some went over the border fence on paragliders. After getting past the yellow gate of Kfar Aza, they went house to house, peeking in windows, testing doors. Their pace was methodical. To smoke people out of their safe rooms, they set fire to spare tires. To prevent escape, they torched cars.

Only hours later did he learn that they were missing. Soldiers sorted through the corpses strewn around the grounds—many of them burned and blackened. In the days after the massacre, Brodutch was told that the bodies of his wife and children had not been found, and that a witness had seen them being led away, presumably en route to Gaza. When Brodutch heard this, he recalled, “I felt like I&#39;d won the lottery.” His family was alive.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Now, in his sleeplessness, he needed to do something, anything, to make sure that his wife and children were not forgotten. He got up, showered, and dressed in donated clothes: shorts, a T-shirt, and Crocs. He collected his dog, Rodney, a chocolate-brown Ridgeback, and drove to Tel Aviv, getting out at the Kirya, the IDF&#39;s headquarters, on Kaplan Street. This was where, since January, tens of thousands of Israelis had assembled every week to protest the Netanyahu government&#39;s plan to reduce the authority of the Supreme Court. At around three, he sat down on a plastic chair next to a sign that he&#39;d drawn reading “&lt;em>;HaMishpacha Sheli Be&#39;aza&lt;/em>;”: “My Family Is in Gaza.” Brodutch&#39;s brother, who was visiting from Canada, posted a picture of him and sent it to their WhatsApp groups. By daylight, a small crowd had gathered around him. By late morning, when I arrived, there were hundreds of people, many of them chanting slogans calling for Netanyahu&#39;s resignation. Another slogan was “&lt;em>;Hayom!&lt;/em>; ” “Today!” As in, Bring the hostages back today.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The victims of the Hamas attack—the dead, the survivors, the kidnapped—were not settlers or fanatics; they were, in the main, the liberals of Israel, a breed that still speaks (with caveats and shades of difference) about peace and two states for two peoples. They tend to loathe Netanyahu for his hubris and corruption, his disdain for the Palestinians, his attempt to diminish the Supreme Court, and his alliance with such lurid reactionaries as his national-security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, and his finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich. Some of the survivors were not especially political; some had come to the previous Kaplan Street demonstrations. They joined groups like Achim Laneshek, or Brothers in Arms, reservists who marched against Netanyahu. After October 7th, they put aside protest for rescue work.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Brodutch sat down with me on a bench to talk, but every few minutes someone would come up and hug him, hard, shaking with grief and fury. People kept bringing him clothing, drinks, food: kugel, couscous, a pile of meatballs. Brodutch was touched and embarrassed, but, even in his gratitude, he could not eat. To please one visitor, he ate a teaspoonful of pomegranate seeds. His smile was sheepish, his eyes full of hurt, though he could not manage to cry, much as he wanted to.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“I don&#39;t know what my state of mind is,” he said. “There is so much grief, so much love.” The night before the attack, Ofri, his eldest child, had celebrated her tenth birthday at a restaurant near the kibbutz. “We were meant to have the birthday cake on Saturday,” Brodutch told me. “It&#39;s probably still in the fridge.”&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;a data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a27835&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a27835&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;“Thats an old wives tale.

Brodutch recognized him immediately. On their rampage, Hamas fighters had not only managed to blind the Army&#39;s surveillance systems and break through the forty-mile-long border fence at more than twenty points; they also stormed at least eight military bases and killed dozens of soldiers who might have been able to beat back the onslaught. Buhadana was among the reservists who made it to Kfar Aza that day, first to hunt for remaining terrorists, then to search for survivors. Now he, too, was shaking with emotion. After a while, he wiped the sweat from his head and the tears from his face, and sat down. “If you are speaking by proportion, this is way worse than 9/11,” he said. “The world should know how cruel these people are.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The scene outside the IDF headquarters was an open-air shiva, part of a &lt;em>;national&lt;/em>; shiva. So many well-wishers were descending on Brodutch that he finally asked to take a break, and headed off with his brother. When we met again, a short while later, Brodutch made it clear that he wanted to deliver a message that was out of keeping with the dominant emotions of the day—the hunger for vengeance, the outrage at the failure of the Israeli government to protect its citizens. Brodutch allowed that the state had failed: “This is a colossal disaster that will be investigated in years to come.” But he was painstakingly deliberate in his comments about his family&#39;s kidnappers. His wife and his children were in the hands of Hamas, and Hamas was keenly aware of what was being written and said about the organization abroad, including in Israel. Every time Israel dropped a bomb, he worried that it might kill his family. “I have to hope that there is someone watching over them,” he said. “It was overkill by Hamas. I don&#39;t think they thought things would go that far. At least, I want to believe that. Their religion is peaceful. No religion can be successful for long if it is not peaceful.”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;44agck&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;He was terrified by the prospect of a ground war. “We are going the wrong way,” he said. “We&#39;ve had a sign from God, and if we read it as a sign to go to war that is one thing. We should be sending humanitarian aid to women, children, and the elderly. Hamas believes that women, children, and the elderly should not be attacked, but something on their side went very wrong. I don&#39;t think they thought this attack would be so easy, and they just &lt;em>;lost&lt;/em>; it.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Uriah, his youngest, is four and a half. Brodutch said that he imagined his son would be “causing havoc wherever he is,” and that, maybe for that reason, Hamas would lose patience and let him be the first one released. “I&#39;ve seen military conflict for years and years,” he said, “and it solves nothing.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;On a trip to Gaza during the second intifada, I met one of the founders of Hamas, a former surgeon named Mahmoud al-Zahar. This was 2001, and al-Zahar was fifty-seven. “ &#39;David,&#39; ” he said. “That&#39;s a Jewish name, isn&#39;t it?” Hamas, a radical, religious rival to the Palestine Liberation Organization, was determined to free “the whole of Palestine.” Hamas might consider a two-state solution, but only as a &lt;em>;hudna&lt;/em>;, a ceasefire. The ultimate goal, al-Zahar said, “is to establish an Islamic state in Palestine, in Egypt, in Lebanon, in Saudi Arabia—everywhere under a single caliphate.” Certain conclusions followed from this: “We will not tolerate a non-Islamic state on Islamic lands.”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;GenericCallout&quot;>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;A view of a rocket in the sky.

In those days, many Israelis shopped in Gaza City or went to the beach nearby; tens of thousands of Gazans commuted regularly to jobs inside Israel, a practice that Yassin feared would be corrosive to the moral values of young Muslims. He stressed &lt;em>;da&#39;wa,&lt;/em>; the call to God. But, as a way of keeping militants within the fold and of keeping pace with the PLO as a force of resistance, Yassin sanctioned the import of arms and the formation of nascent militia groups. In 1987, when the first intifada began, in a Gaza refugee camp, Hamas—an acronym for Harakat al-Muqawama al-Islamiyya, the Islamic Resistance Movement—was born. Four years later, Hamas established its military wing, the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades. Led today by Mohammed Deif, who was born in a refugee camp in Khan Yunis, in southern Gaza, the Brigades have been behind countless military operations against Israel over the years, from car bombs to suicide attacks, though never anything as tactically intricate or as ambitious as Operation Al-Aqsa Flood. Among the stated objectives of the massacre, a Hamas leader said, was to free Palestinian prisoners in Israel and to protect the Al-Aqsa Mosque from desecration, but many suspected ambitions that were wider in scope, including scuttling a rapprochement between Israel and Saudi Arabia.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;The original Hamas charter, or covenant, was a nine-thousand-word treatise adopted shortly after the group&#39;s founding. It was filled with antisemitic conspiracy theories, all the traditional tropes of cunning, greed, and world domination: the Jews started the First World War, it asserted, in a scheme to topple the Islamic Caliphate, and they started the Second World War in order to make “huge profits from trading war materiel.” The Zionists, who had replaced “the state of truth” with “the state of evil,” aspire to “expand from the Nile to the Euphrates,” while Hamas “strives to raise the banner of Allah over every inch of Palestine.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Hamas, in its first decade, established no caliphate, but it did help propel the ascent of the right in Israeli politics. After Israel and the PLO signed the Oslo Accords, in Washington, in 1993; in Cairo, in 1994; and in Taba, Egypt, in 1995, Hamas tried to undermine progress toward a binding two-state resolution. The organization, which condemned the PLO for having recognized the state of Israel, backed a string of suicide bombings in Jerusalem, Tel Aviv, and elsewhere. Israeli militants, too, sought to sabotage the accords, and in 1995 a young right-wing zealot assassinated Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin. Israeli voters at first seemed likely to turn to a candidate from Rabin&#39;s Labor Party, Shimon Peres, who had received a Nobel Peace Prize, along with Rabin and Yasir Arafat, for his role in conceiving the Oslo agreements. Hamas, in a sense, was the spoiler. Playing on the fears of the people, Netanyahu and his Likud Party won with the support of conservatives, settlers, the ultra-Orthodox, and the Mizrachi, Jews with origins in the Middle East and North Africa. During the campaign, he made sure to be overheard when he told a spiritual leader of the Sephardim, Rabbi Yitzhak Kaduri, “Leftists have forgotten what it is to be Jewish. They think they will put security in the hands of the Arabs—that Arabs will look out for us.” He won the election, and though he has spent occasional periods in the wilderness, he has now been Prime Minister for a total of sixteen years, longer even than David Ben-Gurion.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In Netanyahu&#39;s first term, I spoke at length with him in Jerusalem, and even interviewed his father, Benzion, a reclusive scholar of the Spanish Inquisition whose sense that Jewish history is in perpetual danger of coming to an end exerted a powerful influence on his son. “The Jewish people have had a history unlike any other people&#39;s because they lacked the elements of national survival,” the Prime Minister told me. “On the other hand, they didn&#39;t perish completely. They perished &lt;em>;mostly&lt;/em>;. They were about ten per cent of the Roman Empire at the time of the birth of Christ, so by any calculation they should be about a hundred and twenty million and not twelve million. 。 。 。 What happened after the worst catastrophe in our history is that we somehow amassed the national will to reforge a vital center for Jewish life here in Israel.” Netanyahu&#39;s sense of the state and of himself as its unillusioned guardian was clear: “You have to protect yourself. This is what the Jews didn&#39;t have. They didn&#39;t have the means to protect themselves against evil, the baser impulses of mankind. And they paid a price unlike any other people. We now have the means to protect ourselves.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In 2005, Ariel Sharon, a Likud Prime Minister known as the Bulldozer, defied much of his right-wing constituency by evacuating the Israeli settlements in Gaza. The aim of disengagement was to yield a rough peace and make Israel more secure, but the following year Hamas rose to power, winning legislative elections and, after a military confrontation, ousting the Palestinian Authority from the Gaza Strip. There have been no elections since.&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;a data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a26735&amp;quot;}&quot;

In December, 2008, following a period of Qassam rockets and counterraids, Israel launched Operation Cast Lead, which killed at least a thousand Palestinians, devastated civic infrastructure in Gaza City, and left many thousands homeless. In 2012, Israel responded to Hamas rocket fire with eight days of air strikes; at least eighty-seven Palestinian civilians were killed. In 2014, after Hamas abducted and murdered three Israeli teen-agers, Israel commenced a seven-week assault, killing more than fourteen hundred Palestinian civilians.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;v8jwde&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;In 2017, Hamas toned down its rhetoric. Despite its authoritarian rule in the Strip—its suppression of the Palestinian Authority and any other rival for power—the group asserted in Article 28 of its updated manifesto that “Hamas believes in, and adheres to, managing its Palestinian relations on the basis of pluralism, democracy, national partnership, acceptance of the other and the adoption of dialogue.” The new document said that Hamas&#39;s fight was with Zionism, not with the Jewish people as such, but it unhesitatingly reaffirmed its ultimate ambition of eliminating the “Zionist entity.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;As the Israeli right solidified its hold on power, some in the country came to view its draconian anti-Palestinian policies with repugnance. Yair Golan is a retired Army general in his early sixties; he is graying yet as trim as a blade. He was an infantry commander during the second intifada, and then led the Judea and Samaria division, in the West Bank. But he grew increasingly disgusted with the military&#39;s treatment of Palestinians, and he did not keep his views to himself. A speech that he delivered seven years ago at a Holocaust Remembrance Day ceremony at Kibbutz Tel Yitzhak caused a furor. Golan, who was then the deputy chief of staff of the IDF, warned that Israeli society had grown callous to “the other,” and said, “If there is something that frightens me in the memory of the Holocaust, it is identifying horrifying processes that occurred in Europe, particularly in Germany, seventy, eighty, and ninety years ago, and finding evidence of their existence here in our midst today, in 2016.” He referred to an incident in Hebron in which an IDF sergeant was filmed shooting a Palestinian who had stabbed an Israeli soldier but had already been subdued and was prostrate. “There is nothing easier and simpler,” Golan said, “than behaving like a beast, becoming morally corrupt, and sanctimonious.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Although Isaac Herzog, now Israel&#39;s President, praised Golan for his “morality and responsibility,” Netanyahu blasted Golan&#39;s reference to the Holocaust as “outrageous,” and there were countless calls for the general&#39;s resignation. In the end, he walked back his comments somewhat, but his disenchantment was such that he joined Meretz, a political party to the left of Labor, vowing to battle the annexation of the West Bank.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I ran into Golan at the studios of Channel 13, near Jerusalem. He was there to tell the story about what he did on the morning of the massacre. As a reservist, he threw on his uniform, got his gun, drove to a military outpost in the city of Ramle, and asked to be an “envoy.” He made his way south and started getting calls from people whose friends or family were in the area, some of them at the Nova festival, in Re&#39;im.

About officials who thought that by “shrinking the conflict” they could maintain the status quo indefinitely. About the complacency engendered by high fences and a security system overly reliant on “startup nation” technologies and the Special Forces. About the failure of Netanyahu and his intelligence and military bureaucracies to heed warnings of imminent danger, in Gaza and beyond. About the moral deficits of a government obsessed with protecting its Prime Minister from criminal prosecution and indifferent to the corrosive effects of the blockade of Gaza and the occupation of the West Bank. All these factors helped open the way to the October 7th massacre, he believed, and to a war being led by an untrustworthy leader.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;“When you have a crisis, like Pearl Harbor or September 11th, it is a multidimensional crisis, a multidimensional failure,” Golan said. Netanyahu, who in 2009 was elected for the second time, after Operation Cast Lead, “made a terrible strategic mistake,” Golan went on. “He wanted quiet. So, while Hamas was relatively quiet, Netanyahu saw no need to have a vision for the larger Palestinian question. And since he needed the support of the settlers and the ultra-Orthodox, he appeased them. He created a situation in which, so long as the Palestinian Authority was weak, he could create the over-all perception that the best thing to do was to annex the West Bank. We weakened the very institution that we could have worked with, and strengthened Hamas.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Golan was referring to a strategy of Netanyahu&#39;s, deployed over the past fourteen years, that is known as the “conception.” Its aim was to weaken the Palestinian Authority, which sought territorial compromise, by bolstering its enemy Hamas. While refusing to engage the PA and its leader, Mahmoud Abbas, in any serious negotiations, the government permitted hundreds of millions of dollars from Qatar to stream into Hamas&#39;s coffers and increased the flow of work permits for Gazans with jobs inside Israel. It wasn&#39;t that Netanyahu cared one way or another about the poor of Gaza; it was, in his view, a matter of strategic guile. But, as Golan&#39;s old boss Gadi Eisenkot, a former IDF chief of staff, told &lt;em>;Ma&#39;ariv&lt;/em>; last year, Netanyahu carried out this strategy “in total opposition to the national assessment of the National Security Council, which determined that there was a need to disconnect from the Palestinians and establish two states.”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;GenericCallout&quot;>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;Seven people praying outside of a mosque.

The last decade in which I led Israel was the safest decade in Israel&#39;s history. But not only safe and secure for Israelis, also safe and secure for the Palestinians.” It was a litany of bad faith, deception, and delusion, with disastrous consequences.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“I commanded Judea and Samaria from 2005 to 2007,” Golan told me, referring to the West Bank. “The most frustrating thing to me is the inability of anyone to envision how these two peoples can live together. We are not going anywhere. And they are not going anywhere. Occupation is not a solution. Our peoples should both be led by sensible majorities, but both peoples are being led by their extremists. This is the challenge of Israel.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In the meantime, there was the spectre of a land war. Golan argued that this could not be avoided: “To recover our villages and kibbutzim in the south, we need one-hundred-per-cent security in the area. To do that, you need to make the military of Hamas irrelevant. There will be an ongoing operation, attacks all the time. In the next few days, you will see only the first stage of that war.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Before he hurried off to his next appointment, I asked him about the prospects of a multifront war: with Hamas, in Gaza; with Hezbollah, on the border with Lebanon; with Iranian proxy militias coming from Syria and Iraq; even with Iran itself. He put the chances at “ten or fifteen per cent.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In school or beyond, nearly every Israeli encounters Hayim Nahman Bialik&#39;s 1904 poem “In the City of Killing,” written in Hebrew just after the pogrom in Kishinev, in the Russian Empire&#39;s Pale of Settlement. After a local antisemitic newspaper published reports that Jews had murdered a Christian child in the area to use his blood for Passover matzo, mobs led by priests went on a rampage, with cries of “Kill the Jews!” A historical commission, in Odesa, assigned Bialik, a young Hebrew teacher, to travel to Kishinev and interview survivors for a kind of oral history. The poem became a rallying cry against the tsar and the Russian Empire, and, eventually, for Jewish national pride. Inspired by Bialik&#39;s words, many Russian Jews left for Europe, the United States, and Palestine.&lt;/p>;&lt;blockquote >;&lt;div >;&lt;p>;Get up and walk through the city of the massacre&lt;br/>;And with your hand touch and lock your eyes&lt;br/>;On the cooled brain and clots of blood&lt;br/>;Dried on tree trunks, rocks, and fences; it is they.&lt;br/>;Go to the ruins, to the gaping breaches.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/blockquote>;&lt;p >;Forty-nine Jews were massacred by the mob in Kishinev. It is hard to know what the fourteen hundred killed in a single day in Otef Aza will mean. Unlike the Jews in the Pale, Israel is hardly defenseless. But it is vulnerable, and it was plain that this massacre would influence the collective psyche—and the politics—of Israel for years to come.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;A week after the events of October 7th, an Israeli journalist and friend arranged for us to travel about an hour south from Tel Aviv to Kibbutz Kfar Aza. Once we passed the coastal cities of Ashdod and Ashkelon, we veered east, away from Gaza and into an area heavily guarded by IDF soldiers. In the fields near Gaza, troops, tanks, and armored personnel had started to establish positions for the planned ground invasion.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;An IDF press officer gave us bulletproof vests and Kevlar helmets. There had been no exchanges of gunfire in a few days, no evidence that Hamas fighters remained in the area, but an officer cautioned, “This is an active scene.” Founded in 1951, Kfar Aza was a prosperous kibbutz with two businesses on the site, one that made a dye for plastics, another that provided lighting and sound systems for events. Around seven hundred and fifty people lived there, with kindergartens, a gym, a swimming pool, and a cemetery. Now most of the houses were bullet-pocked ruins, caved in, blown up, torched. Earlier that day, the grounds had been cleared of the last cadavers, but the stench of death lingered. We were told there had been so many corpses, often burned or mutilated, that the young IDF soldiers could not bear the work and called in &lt;em >;Zaka&lt;/em>;, an organization of religious volunteers who, with meticulous care, collect bodies, body parts, and even blood, and give the dead a proper burial according to Jewish law. I&#39;d seen a video in which a volunteer poured cold water on one of the burned corpses. I asked why. To cool it off, I was told, so that when it is placed in a plastic collection bag the bag doesn&#39;t melt.&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;a data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a28046-rd&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a28046-rd&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;“One of these dollars is the first dollar I ever made.

He was getting accustomed to questions about a dead baby he had carried out of a house. “People ask me why I didn&#39;t take a picture,” he said. “I said, &#39;I&#39;m sorry, I, too, have my limits.&#39; ”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Then, unprompted, he took out his phone and started showing me photographs he did take, one corpse after another. “Wait,” he said, swiping. “You will see the pile. They brought gasoline with them. Their intention was to burn.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In some parts of the world, I said, people will say it&#39;s all fake, it&#39;s all &lt;em>;hasbara,&lt;/em>; government propaganda. Vach looked at me unblinking. “Some people say that the Holocaust didn&#39;t exist, right? How do you respond to such people?” he said. “I have pictures. But unless those people will be here and see with their own eyes, I guess they will not believe. But these people also, if they would see it with their own eyes, they would say that we faked the situation. So it doesn&#39;t matter.” His shoulders slumped. His hands slapped to his sides, and he looked around once more at the ruins. “This is evil.” In the near distance, from Gaza, we could hear rockets, Iron Dome interceptions, and Israeli jets.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;GenericCallout&quot;>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;Medical staff attend to an injured child.&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653c17d9150b105565237333/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/231106_r43326.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653c17d9150b105565237333/master/w_120,c_limit/231106_r43326.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653c17d9150b105565237333/master/w_240,c_limit/231106_r43326.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653c17d9150b105565237333/master/w_320,c_limit/231106_r43326.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653c17d9150b105565237333/master/w_640,c_limit/231106_r43326.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653c17d9150b105565237333/master/w_960,c_limit/231106_r43326.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653c17d9150b105565237333/master/w_1280,c_limit/231106_r43326.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653c17d9150b105565237333/master/w_1600,c_limit/231106_r43326.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;In a hospital in Khan Yunis, in southern Gaza, medical staff treat a boy&#39;s injuries.&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Photograph by Samar Abu Elouf / NYT / Redux&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Most of the evacuees from Kfar Aza were taken to a hotel on the grounds of Kibbutz Shefayim, on the Mediterranean coast, north of Tel Aviv. I arrived one afternoon to see yet another mass shiva—a sombre picnic taking place on the lawn, families huddled together, eating, carefully eying their kids kicking a soccer ball, playing tag.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Inside, in a conference room off the lobby, a woman from Kfar Aza named Yael Felus had helped set up what she called a “war room.” A dozen people were there, working phones and laptops, to arrange psychiatric care, to organize buses for funerals, to distribute clothes and food. Felus had grown up in Sderot, a coastal city about a half mile from Gaza. “I needed a quieter place,” she told me. “So I went to Kfar Aza. It seemed like a good place to raise my kids.” Now, she said, she would go back only “if they flatten Gaza and they go to live in Egypt.” She knew how that sounded and didn&#39;t seem to care. How could she go back? Before sending me to meet survivors from the kibbutz who were milling around the lobby, she said, “Most of my friends are dead.” She tried to count them all on her fingers, then gave up.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I met a woman named Roni Stahl Lupo, who was born at Kfar Aza in 1972; she knew nearly everyone who had died there. She, too, could not give an accurate count. She and her husband have three children and run a small business, designing industrial kitchens. Her sister, Ziv Stahl, is the executive director of Yesh Din (There Is Law), a human-rights group. Her family had barely escaped Kfar Aza alive. Before her daughter and her boyfriend fled the kibbutz grounds, Hamas gunmen shot at them, hitting the boyfriend twice in the hand. Lupo had lived through countless rocket attacks over the years, but now she was unsure whether she would stay in Israel at all.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;“During the demonstrations against this government, I began to feel that I&#39;m no longer part of the majority of this country,” she said. “Morally, socially, this is not my Israel. I&#39;m left-wing, Ashkenazi, a kibbutznik, and secular, and this is not the identity of Israel any longer. My contract with this country is over. It&#39;s broken.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;She was both enraged at Hamas and deeply anxious about the bombing of Gaza and the ground incursion taking shape near her old home. “I keep thinking that these operations will happen because of me, someone will be killed because of me,” she said. “And I cannot live with that.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;One morning, I visited Sari Nusseibeh, in East Jerusalem. A scholar of early Islamic philosophy who had been an informal adviser to Yasir Arafat, Nusseibeh was born in Damascus and lives in Sheikh Jarrah, a Jerusalem neighborhood that has been under assault and encroachment by settlers and the Israeli government for years. His family is distinguished in the extreme. For centuries, the Nusseibehs have been Muslim custodians of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, in the Old City. Nusseibeh&#39;s father, Anwar, was the governor of Jerusalem and Amman&#39;s Ambassador to the Court of St. James&#39;s. Nusseibeh, who is seventy-four, has always been a distinctly moderate voice in Palestinian public life, with friends all over the scholarly world. He is uncompromising in his insistence on Palestinian rights, and, in his books, he evinces sympathy with Jewish history and Israeli anxiety. At the same time, his disapproval of violence—whether perpetrated by Israeli settlers or Palestinian suicide bombers—is absolute.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Nusseibeh&#39;s weariness and apprehension as we sat down were palpable. “We have made so many advances—in technology, AI, medicine, everything except human relations,” he said. “I knew there would be constant explosions for as many years as it takes for people to finally learn that there has to be another way, but not a confrontation like this.” He shrugged. “No matter what, we will end up where we started, with the Palestinians and the Israelis living here together and needing to find a proper formula.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;On the morning of October 7th, Nusseibeh had just returned home from dropping off his wife and his daughter at the airport when he heard sirens. “My first reaction was &#39;Hmm, interesting.&#39; This happens every now and again, but then there were more sirens, then thuds, and the house actually shook. I thought, This might be serious.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;At first, he sensed great pride among many in his East Jerusalem community as the news broke. Palestinians on motorcycles, in pickup trucks, and on hang gliders had managed something that not even foreign armies had done. In 1973, the Egyptian Army surprised Israel in the western Sinai and the Syrians wiped out Israeli tanks in the Golan Heights, but, for the most part, they did not get close to Israeli population centers. Many Palestinians initially celebrated the Hamas attack as a blow to Israel&#39;s sense of invulnerability. But then, as the evidence of atrocities became common knowledge, Nusseibeh said, that elation curdled. Some even spoke of the incursion as a conspiracy, a guarantee that Israel would now turn so far to the right that the Palestinians would &lt;em>;never&lt;/em>; get statehood. The images were shocking. One detail that struck Nusseibeh was more banal: ordinary Gazans trailing the armed terrorists into Israel and looting. In one video, I saw a Gazan calmly walking with a guitar he had stolen; others took flat-screen TVs and carried them back into Gaza. “It&#39;s like in the wars in the Middle Ages,” Nusseibeh said. “People come behind the fighting to steal.”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;GenericCallout&quot;>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;People selling vegetables near destroyed buildings.&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653c17d9d67d6e6f5e40c493/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/231106_r43332.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653c17d9d67d6e6f5e40c493/master/w_120,c_limit/231106_r43332.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653c17d9d67d6e6f5e40c493/master/w_240,c_limit/231106_r43332.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653c17d9d67d6e6f5e40c493/master/w_320,c_limit/231106_r43332.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653c17d9d67d6e6f5e40c493/master/w_640,c_limit/231106_r43332.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653c17d9d67d6e6f5e40c493/master/w_960,c_limit/231106_r43332.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653c17d9d67d6e6f5e40c493/master/w_1280,c_limit/231106_r43332.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653c17d9d67d6e6f5e40c493/master/w_1600,c_limit/231106_r43332.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;In the Nuseirat market, in the Gaza Strip, people sell vegetables near buildings destroyed by Israeli air strikes.

But he is also convinced that Hamas and violent extremism, in general, will not recede without a political resolution. “It&#39;s a mistake to think that Hamas is an alien being—it is part of the national tapestry,” he said. “It grows bigger or smaller depending on other factors. You can eliminate the guys running Hamas now, but you cannot eliminate it entirely. It will stay as a way of thinking, as an idea, so long as there is a Palestinian-Israeli conflict.” He went on, “People say there is more support for Hamas in the West Bank than in Gaza and the reverse is true in Gaza, that there is more support for the PA And it has to do with governance.” In fact, a survey taken shortly before the October 7th attack showed widespread disaffection with Hamas among Gazans. Both entities are riddled with corruption and plagued by a lack of basic competence. And they were crippled, above all, by the circumstances of occupation and siege. The PA was no more capable of taking care of the needs of Ramallah and Jenin, Nusseibeh argued, than Hamas was able to cope with the burdens of daily life in Rafah, Khan Yunis, and Gaza City.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;497cxv&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Before we went our separate ways, Nusseibeh said he thought that Arab rulers, despite it all, had no taste for a multifront war, one that might pull in the United States. This was not the mid-century, when many Arab leaders still thought of Israel as temporary. But he was hardly optimistic—not in the short run, anyway. “I think people are crazy,” he told me. “Especially people in positions of power. They are crazier than the average person and can easily lead populations to war.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;On August 10, 2006, three Israeli novelists—David Grossman, Amos Oz, and AB Yehoshua—called on the Israeli government to accept a ceasefire proposal to end the Second Lebanon War. Two days later, Grossman&#39;s son Uri, a twenty-year-old staff sergeant in an Israeli tank brigade, was killed in a battle with Hezbollah. Grossman had been a peace activist for much of his adult life, speaking at demonstrations and publishing essays, alternately fierce and soulful, that were intended to pierce the indifference of his compatriots. “The Yellow Wind,” from 1987, was a collection of reported essays about the occupation (some of them published in these pages) which startled Israeli readers. When it was uncommon to do so, Grossman visited refugee camps and classrooms in the West Bank. While reporting on proceedings against Palestinians in an Israeli military court in Nablus, Grossman quoted the essay “Shooting an Elephant,” in which George Orwell wrote of an imperial police officer in Burma, “He wears a mask, and his face grows to fit it.” The theme is common to both writers: in enforcing injustice, the colonist deceives, and destroys, himself. “To the End of the Land,” a 2008 novel imbued with the loss of Grossman&#39;s son, is his masterpiece. I asked Grossman, who lives in Mevaseret Zion, in the hills outside Jerusalem, about his reaction to the events of October 7th.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Of course, we felt something was wrong with the whole management of the country,” he said. “We felt that our Prime Minister invests all his time in his trials and doesn&#39;t have enough time to take care of the country. But no one could anticipate &lt;em>;this&lt;/em>;.” He went on, “We saw a process that could have led to Hamas taking over Tel Aviv. We don&#39;t ever want to think about catastrophe, but thinking about catastrophe is my profession, and we were very close to that. I will tell you frankly, when I am confronted with such evil, pure evil, I don&#39;t want to live in such a world that allows such monstrosities. Just to be exposed to such things, to see the murder of children, women, pregnant women, babies—it is impossible to absorb it. The fifty-six years of occupation is terrible. I&#39;ve spent my entire life writing and acting against it, and I see some friends at American universities and elsewhere trying to achieve some sort of balance. But evils cannot always be compared. Sometimes, I tell my friends, objectivity is a nice way to cover up cowardice, to say, &#39;We are bad and they are bad.&#39; By doing so, you spare yourself, you refuse to expose yourself to the atrocities in front of you.”&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot;

of killing, it just feels different. Hamas made a major mistake in 2005, when we evacuated. Around ten thousand settlers were uprooted. If, after our withdrawal, the Palestinians had started to build in Gaza using the financial support they were promised, if they had made Gaza a kind of test case on how to build a life again, if Gaza had become, if not the &#39;Singapore of the Middle East,&#39; then at least a place where life could be developed, the next withdrawal would have come quickly. Instead, they chose another path. There were thousands of missiles aimed at us from Gaza in the next two years. And now, after they have done this, you start to think, Well, if you have such a neighbor, you had better be well equipped and suspicious all the time.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;In his view, the prospects for Israel, which just celebrated its seventy-fifth anniversary of existence, were grave. “I think the task of being an Israeli will be harder now,” he said. “The need to protect this country will be an even more serious issue. We thought this was all behind us after signing agreements with various Arab countries and the Abraham Accords. But you cannot have an Abraham Accord and ignore the Palestinians. We shall see now how exhausting it is to be an Israeli, to be all the time on the alert for surprise and violence. Once more, we will have to be both Athens and Sparta. We will try to be tolerant and decent to our neighbors, not racist but pluralist, liberal, yet at the same time very tough militarily.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In reality, Grossman knew, the political temper of the country was likely to grow increasingly distant from his view of the world. “I guess that Israel will become more and more right-wing, more and more religious,” he went on. “Jewish identity will be narrowed to self-defense. There will be more and more adoration of the Army, even though the Army has failed. My cry out to my Prime Minister is this: You have Israel in your hands, this precious thing. You are responsible for this unique country. If this country fails, will history be generous again?”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Sam Bahour is an American-born Palestinian who moved from Ohio to the West Bank in the wake of the Oslo Accords, a generation ago. Thinking he was building a future state, he helped establish the Palestine Telecommunications Company, travelling frequently between the West Bank and Gaza. He lives in Al-Bireh, the West Bank town his father came from, and when we spoke he was furious about the way that settler harassment and violence and seemingly random arrests of Palestinians were rising fast. “We turn on the radio every morning and we don&#39;t hear about the weather,” he said. “We hear about arrests.” Even more alarming, there were reports that dozens of Palestinians in the West Bank had been killed since the Hamas attack, some by settlers.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;For Bahour, there was nothing utopian about demanding a political solution; it was only its denial that was impractical, as well as unjust. “We don&#39;t ask for the moon,” he said. “We ask for a military occupation of fifty-six years to end. My fear is that this round, as much as it&#39;s doing tremendous damage, physical damage, to Gaza and to the people of Gaza, it is also exposing the hypocrisy of the West and the international community. And, if we go on doing that, it&#39;s a free-for-all.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In the West Bank and elsewhere, Bahour told me, “all the attention now is focussed on stopping the bombing in a small, intensely overcrowded place that is fifty per cent children. The entire civilian infrastructure is being torn up. I don&#39;t know how anyone—an Israeli or a Jewish American or anyone—thinks this assault will make Israel safer. They are doing just the opposite. Ironically, what Hamas did could have the effect of saving Netanyahu, of keeping him in power. Everyone knows that the day that this war stops he will be out of government. So now he is someone with nothing to lose, much like the people in Gaza. And people with nothing to lose lash out.”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;GenericCallout&quot;>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;Two people stand outside of a shipping container that holds multiple corpses in bodybags.&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653c17d97cf57774149d3624/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/231106_r43333.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653c17d97cf57774149d3624/master/w_120,c_limit/231106_r43333.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653c17d97cf57774149d3624/master/w_240,c_limit/231106_r43333.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653c17d97cf57774149d3624/master/w_320,c_limit/231106_r43333.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653c17d97cf57774149d3624/master/w_640,c_limit/231106_r43333.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653c17d97cf57774149d3624/master/w_960,c_limit/231106_r43333.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653c17d97cf57774149d3624/master/w_1280,c_limit/231106_r43333.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653c17d97cf57774149d3624/master/w_1600,c_limit/231106_r43333.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;At the Shura Military Base, in Israel, the bodies of victims of the October 7th attacks are still being identified.&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Photograph by Peter van Agtmael / Magnum for The New Yorker&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;The scenes of Hamas fighters standing in triumph over the dead, taking selfies and shouting “&lt;em>;Allahu akbar!&lt;/em>;,” recalled, for some, Frantz Fanon&#39;s line that “the colonized is the persecuted person who is always dreaming of becoming the persecutor.” Now those scenes were giving way to scenes of a devastated Gaza. Like Nusseibeh, and like Grossman, too, Bahour was unequivocally opposed to the killing of civilians. At the same time, he said, “we have to be wise, wise enough to hold multiple thoughts in our heads. There is the thought that Gazans would breach the fence and break out of their open-air prison—that is one thing. But it is another thing that they went into villages and killed civilians the way they did. It is a horrific act and must be condemned. But I also can&#39;t just have a knee-jerk reaction and think this is a story that started October 7th.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The task of holding in one&#39;s head multiple thoughts—multiple facts—was nearly impossible, particularly in the face of sloganeering and the allure of militancy. There is the thought that Israeli settlers, many of them armed, have stepped up their daily violence against Palestinian villagers, egged on by ministers in the Netanyahu government. That, though Israel is well armed and has powerful allies, it is also the size of New Jersey and faces multiple enemies—Hamas, Hezbollah, and Iran—whose leaders speak regularly of the elimination of “the Zionist entity.” That the unemployment rate in Gaza is forty-five per cent, the water barely potable, electricity and food in short supply, the health-care system in ruins. That antisemitism has, yet again, grown in breadth, intensity, and violence. That contempt for Palestinians is practically a norm in the current Israeli government, as when Smotrich, the finance minister, spoke at a memorial service in France and, standing in front of a map with Gaza, the West Bank, and Jordan melded into “Greater Israel,” declared, “There is no Palestinian history,” or when Ben-Gvir, the national-security minister, told journalists, “My right, my wife&#39;s, my children&#39;s, to roam the roads of Judea and Samaria are more important than the right of movement of the Arabs.” That many thousands of Palestinians have already been killed in the recent air strikes and well over a million have been internally displaced. There will be no end to it anytime soon: the funerals, the recriminations, the threats, the fear, the assaults.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;There was also the grim fact that Hamas had, in the most brutal fashion, shattered the illusion that a state could provide Israelis the guarantee of security. As Yonit Levi, the news anchor of Channel 12 put it to me, “Every single Jewish nightmare came true.” And so what would come in return? The air strikes on Gaza were proceeding at an unprecedented pace every night—lethal and incessant—and a ground incursion could lead to a hellscape of urban warfare, another Fallujah. It was a familiar nightmare, reminiscent of what followed 9/11, in which a stronger nation pursues a policy that, while trying to defeat an enemy for carrying out an unspeakable massacre, kills countless civilians and ultimately inflicts untold and lasting damage on itself.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The day after my visit to Kfar Aza, I took a cab to the town of Gan Yavne, twenty miles from Gaza, to attend the funeral of all five members of the Kutz family. Livnat and Aviv Kutz had been found dead together on a bed with their children, Rotem, Yonatan, and Yiftach. Throughout Israel, everyone seemed to know the story, that they had been discovered in a kind of final family embrace. Few knew that, over the wall, in Khan Yunis, nine members of the al-Bashiti family were reported to have been killed in an air strike. Killing was the common condition.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;At Gan Yavne, mourners stared at the five graves, deep and sharply dug. As people gathered under and around the perimeter of a white tent that blocked the hard afternoon sun, a volunteer from &lt;em >;Zaka&lt;/em>;, a man of astonishing industry and fitness, kept hopping in and out of the graves, preparing them, lining up sacks of dirt, ordering things according to Jewish law. Pressing forward to get a little closer to the service, I spotted Mia Kraus, a teen-ager and an evacuee from Kfar Aza whom I&#39;d spoken with at Kibbutz Shefayim. I reintroduced myself. “I remember you,” she said shyly. Like everyone at Kfar Aza, she knew the Kutz family well.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;More teen-agers from the kibbutz squeezed past the surrounding headstones and gathered tightly together, arm in arm with Mia in the first row behind the family&#39;s relatives. Her mind was here and &lt;em>;there:&lt;/em>; one of her friends was kidnapped and later found dead. Mia was sixteen, the same age, I recalled, that the poet Mosab Abu Toha had been when he was nearly killed on the streets of Gaza. In Mosab&#39;s poem “The Wounds,” he writes:&lt;/p>;&lt;blockquote >;&lt;div >;&lt;p>;If, when the rocket fell, I had moved my head a bit&lt;br/>;to watch a bird on a tree or to count&lt;br/>;the clouds coming from the west side,&lt;br/>;the shrapnel might have cut through my throat.&lt;br/>;I wouldn&#39;t be married to my wife,&lt;br/>;father of three kids, one born in America. 。 。 .&lt;br/>;I look around me, relatives circle my bed.&lt;br/>;I watch them as they chat. I imagine them praying round my coffin.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/blockquote>;&lt;p >;The funeral service began. When Mia and I had spoken at Kibbutz Shefayim, she told me that she could no longer be in a room with the door closed, not even the bathroom. It brought back the memory of hiding in her house for twenty hours with Hamas gunmen outside her door. Through a partially open window, she could hear their conversations. Somehow, the gunmen never came in. Her family survived. Yet she regularly found herself overtaken by crippling waves of fear.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The coffins were carried in and the names were read: one by one by one by one by one. At first, there was silence, but now a great communal lamentation convulsed the assembled. I have never heard such weeping as I did that afternoon. There would be many more funerals to come, many more convulsions of grief. But the sounds of lamentation never carry as far as those of rockets, missiles, artillery, bombs. As I was finishing this piece, Mosab messaged me, describing the nightly bombings in his neighborhood. A ground assault was imminent. “Any moment I may not be in this world,” he said. ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 28 Oct 2023 19:06:01 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Will the U.A.W.

Local 12 is the largest amalgamated union in the country, representing more than ten thousand people, including nearly six thousand at a Jeep factory in town. Typically, the monthly meeting attracts a far smaller crowd, but word of a possible strike had been circulating among UAW membership. The union&#39;s contract was set to expire three weeks later, at midnight, and negotiations between the union and representatives of the Big Three—General Motors, Ford, and Stellantis (Chrysler and Jeep&#39;s parent company)—were going nowhere. Bruce Baumhower, who is sixty-eight years old and has been president of the local for more than three decades, got up to the lectern. He has wisps of reddish-gray hair and the large forearms of a former assembly-line worker. He described how, not long ago, the union had given up hard-won wages and benefits to help save the industry in a period of crisis. Those compromises had been exploited by corporate greed, he said; close to a third of the unit still earned less than sixteen dollars an hour. The starting rate had barely budged in fourteen years. “That&#39;s all going to change now,” Baumhower said. “Now it&#39;s our time!”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The crowd exploded, applauding and yelling. Mike Sawaya, whose family has worked at the plant for three generations, was leaning against the wall behind the lectern. He was eight years old when he first met Baumhower, in the same auditorium; he&#39;d been so nervous that he spilled two plates of chili mac onto his lap. “Bruce let it rip,” Sawaya said. “This is what he&#39;s known for.” Baumhower told me later, in his office, “It probably wasn&#39;t a very professional speech—I just said the scam&#39;s up.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;On September 14th, the UAW&#39;s new president, Shawn Fain, called the first simultaneous strike against all Big Three companies in the union&#39;s history. He deployed a new tactic—the “stand-up strike”—which initially called for only one assembly plant from each company to walk out. The name was a reference to the sit-down strikes of the nineteen-thirties, in which workers occupied plants to prevent management or strikebreakers from operating the machinery. The stand-up tactic, as opposed to walking out all at once, would allow the UAW to stretch its eight-hundred-and-twenty-five-million-dollar strike fund, so that the strike could go longer and wider if progress wasn&#39;t made.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Baumhower, who started at Jeep in 1972, told me that he was pleased his plant was one of the first. “We &lt;em>;wanted&lt;/em>; to be the target,” he said. “We think we have the most injustice going on at the shop floor.” The plant&#39;s percentage of “supplemental,” or temporary part-time, employees—some of whom have been working that way for five or six years, with no guaranteed path to full-time employment—is one of the highest in the country, he said. A member&#39;s son recently came to see Baumhower about getting a job. Baumhower assured him that it would be no problem—the company needed more than a hundred new workers. “The kid goes, &#39;Yeah, how much?&#39; ” Baumhower recalled. “I said, &#39;Fifteen seventy-eight.&#39; He says, &#39;Oh.&#39; I said, &#39;What&#39;s the matter?&#39; He said, &#39;I&#39;m working at Arby&#39;s dropping fries for seventeen dollars.

Gone was the annual cost-of-living adjustment and the health insurance for retirees, many of whom are not old enough to qualify for Medicare. Even break time was reduced from six minutes to five. Most significant was the introduction of a two-tiered pay system, under which new hires would start at half of what existing workers made. New hires also would not receive a pension.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Since the crash, average hourly wages for workers in vehicle manufacturing, adjusted for inflation, have fallen by nearly twenty per cent, according to a recent study by the Economic Policy Institute. The automakers, meanwhile, have seen enormous financial success. By 2013, the Treasury Department had sold its last stakes in Chrysler and GM and lifted restrictions on executive compensation. In the past decade, profits at the Big Three have almost doubled. The companies have spent billions on stock buybacks, and CEO pay has gone up by forty per cent; Mary Barra, the CEO of GM, earned twenty-nine million dollars last year.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;The Big Three aren&#39;t a monolith. Last Wednesday, Ford, which is reputed to have the best relationship with its workers, reached a tentative agreement to end the strike at its factories. The terms included a twenty-five-per-cent raise over a four-and-a-half-year contract, an end to wage tiers, and a right-to-strike provision over plant closures, a first for the UAW An agreement with one company generally pressures the other two to settle along similar lines.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The strike comes amid a wider revival of labor. Though union membership is at a historic low, in the past few years the number of striking workers has reached its highest level in decades. Recent walkouts by members of &lt;em >;SAG&lt;/em>;-&lt;em >;AFTRA&lt;/em>; and the Writers Guild and by workers at Kaiser Permanente have enjoyed broad public approval. According to a Gallup poll, sixty-seven per cent of Americans now support labor unions, nineteen points higher than in 2009. Moreover, the poll showed that seventy-five per cent sided with the UAW in its battle with the auto companies. Still, there have been pockets of antipathy. Jim Cramer, an analyst at CNBC, implied that Fain was a Trotskyite and encouraged the auto companies to move their entire production process to Mexico.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Recently, at Baumhower&#39;s striking Jeep plant, a group of workers from the Wrangler paint line were marching in front of one of the main entrances of the three-and-a-half-million-square-foot complex. The mood was defiant. They chanted, “No justice, no Jeeps!” and shouted as drivers on Interstate 75 zipped past, honking. Earlier, someone had incinerated a copy of the old UAW contract in a burn barrel. Todd Gibson, the strike captain on duty, kept the workers walking, back and forth, for six hours. Semi trucks were still making deliveries to the plant, slowly nosing forward through the picket.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Thirty-eight years in jail,” Gibson said with a laugh, when I asked how long he&#39;d worked at the plant. “Not everybody is molded to be a factory worker. You have to be able to handle the long-term, repetitive nature, let your mind go into a different place.” This was the first time during his tenure that the plant had been on strike. What changed? He pointed to Amy Jo Luedtke, a middle-aged woman with bleached-blond hair. Luedtke was in elementary school when she decided that she wanted to work at the plant one day, after driving in a friend&#39;s parents&#39; “naked” Jeep (no doors, no top). She&#39;d been on the paint line for four years, as a supplemental. “I&#39;m here doing the same thing they&#39;re doing,” she said, glancing at her co-workers. “I should get the same thing they&#39;re getting.” Gibson told me, “See, I&#39;m on the end of this show, right? These guys are just starting it. I want to make it &lt;em>;good&lt;/em>; for them.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;On Halloween night, 2021, Jennifer Fultz went trick-or-treating with her seven-year-old daughter, Aria, and her ten-year-old son, Jordan, in her home town of Rockford, Illinois. The kids were both dressed as Pikachu. Fultz, who has long chestnut hair, hazel eyes, and thick glasses, had to finish the rounds early. She brought the kids home, hugged and kissed them goodbye, packed up her car, and, with her mother and her two cats, began the six-hour drive to Toledo. The next day, she was starting a new job at the Jeep plant there. Though the children would soon join her, she was nervous and heartsick. “I worried that, if something were to go wrong, it was just me and my mom in a brand-new city,” she said. “I was praying to God that I had made the right decision.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;For years, Fultz had worked at a Stellantis plant outside Rockford, building Jeep Cherokees. The company laid people off in waves, then idled the plant completely, eliminating the remaining thirteen hundred jobs. The next line of Cherokees would reportedly be built in Toluca, Mexico, making the plant another casualty of the North American Free Trade Agreement. Since &lt;em >;NAFTA&lt;/em>; went into effect, in 1994, it has cost the United States nearly a million jobs, a significant percentage of them in vehicle and parts manufacturing, according to a study by Robert Scott, a recently retired economist at the Economic Policy Institute. &lt;em >;NAFTA&lt;/em>; paved the way for other similar agreements, most notably one that established permanent normal trade relations with China, facilitating its entry into the World Trade Organization, in 2001. Scott estimates that the ensuing trade deficit cost the United States nearly four million jobs, most of them in manufacturing, which tended to be more heavily unionized than other industries. Even the spectre of outsourcing has provided corporations with a powerful cudgel: Stellantis recently threatened to move production of its Ram 1500 to Mexico, too, according to one of the UAW&#39;s lead negotiators. (In a statement, Stellantis said, “We are not commenting on production sites for future products.”)&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;In the past twenty years, the Big Three have closed more than sixty American plants. Fultz told me that her previous plant had been a “melting pot” of autoworkers from shuttered factories in New York, Maryland, and Missouri. Before getting hired by Stellantis, she had worked three other jobs—at Kohl&#39;s, at Papa John&#39;s, and at Subway, as a supervisor—and still could not afford to move out of her mother&#39;s house. “There are not a lot of good jobs back home,” she said. “Once Stellantis pulled the plug, that was it for the whole community.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Fultz works ten-hour shifts, six or seven days a week. The long hours have taken a toll on her physical health. A “little gremlin,” she said, lives on her shoulder. (Fultz spent a year and a half in the body shop, where she lifted and pulled heavy parts all day.) “I can&#39;t hold my daughter, who is light as a feather, for more than five seconds, because my hands go numb,” she told me. Last year, her mother was diagnosed with lung cancer. Fultz takes care of her but is guilt-stricken that the rest of her mother&#39;s family and friends are so far away. “I know that my family is suffering because I brought them here,” Fultz told me, as tears started to stream down her face.&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot;

Various federal laws and programs have established incentives for companies to build EVs and their batteries in America and to staff those plants with union workers. (The House version of the Inflation Reduction Act, passed last year, included a forty-five-hundred-dollar tax credit for buying union-built EVs, but it was stripped from the Senate version at the behest of Joe Manchin.) “If our tax dollars are going to finance this transition, then labor can&#39;t be left behind,” Fain said recently, on “Face the Nation.” Some prominent Democrats and political commentators have suggested otherwise. “If climate change is a central problem, we should want climate-change technologies produced as inexpensively as possible,” Lawrence Summers, the Treasury Secretary under Bill Clinton, said last month.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In 2022, GM partnered with a Korean electronics company to form a new venture called Ultium Cells, which opened a non-union battery plant behind a shuttered assembly complex in Lordstown, Ohio. The companies received two and a half billion dollars in low-interest federal loans. But the starting pay at Ultium was only $16.50 an hour. (In September, it was raised to twenty dollars.) So far, one worker has died from injuries sustained at the plant. Others have been hospitalized for electric shock and for possible chemical exposure; there have also been reports of dizziness, nausea, vomiting, and burns. (A technician had to be wheeled out on a gurney after being “sprayed in the face with toxic electrolyte.”)&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In December, workers at the plant voted overwhelmingly to unionize, but have so far been unable to secure a contract. According to a UAW safety report, there were twenty-two injuries reported to &lt;em >;OSHA&lt;/em>; in the first five months of 2023. A few weeks ago, federal regulators announced their intention to fine the company nearly three hundred thousand dollars. “It&#39;s a dangerous facility, much more than Lordstown,” Dave Green, a UAW regional director, who worked on the assembly line at the old complex, said. The UAW found a fifty-per-cent-higher incidence of &lt;em >;OSHA&lt;/em>; violations there than in traditional GM plants. (A spokesperson for Ultium said, “All safety concerns are taken seriously, investigated, and addressed promptly.”)&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Last year, Jim Farley, Ford&#39;s CEO, predicted that fewer workers will be needed to manufacture electric vehicles, given that their power trains don&#39;t require engines and thus have significantly fewer moving parts. Other experts disagree. A study last year by researchers at Carnegie Mellon University, for example, estimated that producing electric vehicles will actually require more jobs in the short and medium term, because the necessary components are more complicated to make, even if there are fewer of them. In any event, most of the newly announced battery plants will be built in Southern states that are hostile to labor. In June, the federal government awarded Ford and a partner company a nine-billion-dollar loan to build three battery plants in Kentucky and Tennessee. Fain criticized the Biden Administration for failing to pressure the companies to commit to using union labor.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Fultz and I walked out to the parking lot of Local 12, so she could show me her bright-blue Wrangler. Its dashboard, like those of several other Jeeps in the lot, was lined with toy ducks—tokens of good will that fellow Jeep owners give to one another, in a practice known as Jeep ducking. “I have a love-hate relationship with Stellantis,” Fultz said. “I need them to stay financially successful. But even if they were to close their doors today—and I hope they never do—I would probably go to GM or Ford. As crazy and unstable as the automobile industry is, there&#39;s something about knowing that a family is sitting in a car I could have built.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The day after Biden&#39;s visit to the Michigan picket line, Donald Trump showed up at Drake Enterprises, a non-union automotive-parts manufacturer in Macomb County, forty miles away. A lectern was set up in front of a row of enormous shelving units piled high with gear-shift levers and other transmission parts. Secret Service officers shared security responsibilities with heavily tattooed, bearded men wearing black gloves and olive-green shirts. Campaign volunteers passed out signs that read “&lt;em >;Union Members for Trump&lt;/em>;” to anyone who would take them.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Tony Brouckaert, a self-employed tool-and-die maker, was standing by himself in the crowded room. He used to work in a hydraulic-tool factory, which has a union. He&#39;d tried to get rid of it. “I&#39;m a firm believer that, if you&#39;re a hardworking employee, you don&#39;t need the union,” he told me. Nevertheless, most of his political grievances were economic, and rooted in the disappearance of benefits that unions once reliably provided. His job has left him with a bad shoulder, but Obamacare is too expensive, so he is waiting until he&#39;s sixty-five and on Medicare to have it treated.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;After several hours, Trump entered to Lee Greenwood&#39;s “God Bless the USA” and an ecstatic standing ovation. His speech, at turns fluid, deceptive, and frightening, called for a “revival of economic nationalism” and stoked rising economic anxieties. “I put everything on the line to fight for you,” he said. “I have risked it all to defend the working class from the corrupt political class.” He fixated on &lt;em >;NAFTA&lt;/em>;, a persistent theme of his campaigns, especially during stops in Rust Belt states, whose political swings have determined the winners of the past two Presidential elections. Trump called &lt;em >;NAFTA&lt;/em>; “the worst trade deal ever made” and boasted about having renegotiated it in 2018. (The new deal preserved much of the original one; it has been called &lt;em >;NAFTA&lt;/em>; 2.0.) He repeatedly emphasized the threat of electric vehicles. “For autoworkers, Biden&#39;s forced transition is a transition to hell,” he said. “It&#39;s a transition to unemployment.” The current strike was meaningless, he added, because “under Biden&#39;s mandate the entire car industry will be packed up and shipped to China.” Though not many UAW members were present, he implored the crowd to lobby Shawn Fain to endorse him.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;GenericCallout&quot;>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;Black and white photograph of UAW President Shawn Fain climbing onto the bed of a pickup truck and being handed a microphone&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653ace1968e701fce6dfdebc/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/231106_r43311.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653ace1968e701fce6dfdebc/master/w_120,c_limit/231106_r43311.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653ace1968e701fce6dfdebc/master/w_240,c_limit/231106_r43311.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653ace1968e701fce6dfdebc/master/w_320,c_limit/231106_r43311.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653ace1968e701fce6dfdebc/master/w_640,c_limit/231106_r43311.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653ace1968e701fce6dfdebc/master/w_960,c_limit/231106_r43311.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653ace1968e701fce6dfdebc/master/w_1280,c_limit/231106_r43311.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653ace1968e701fce6dfdebc/master/w_1600,c_limit/231106_r43311.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;During a speech in Detroit, Shawn Fain, the president of the UAW, framed the union as part of an “arsenal of democracy” fighting corporate greed.&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;In 2016, exit polls showed that Trump won two-thirds of voters who believe trade with foreign countries takes away American jobs; this helped him flip Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania, which he carried by fewer than eighty thousand total votes. Fultz told me that she felt she had “the most job security when Trump was in office.” But Trump&#39;s political career has been marked by intense hostility toward labor. In 2015, when campaigning for President, he told the Detroit &lt;em>;News&lt;/em>; that automakers should pursue a kind of intra-national &lt;em >;NAFTA&lt;/em>;, moving plants out of Michigan to parts of the US where labor was cheaper, and then returning to the state after workers there had become desperate enough to accept lower wages. “You can go to different parts of the United States, and then ultimately you&#39;d do full circle,” he said. “We can do the rotation in the United States—it doesn&#39;t have to be in Mexico.”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;7ec8s&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;During Trump&#39;s Presidency, the country lost a hundred and seventy thousand manufacturing jobs and close to seven thousand factories. In 2017, Trump appointed Peter Robb, a management-side lawyer, as general counsel to the National Labor Relations Board. Robb had served as Ronald Reagan&#39;s lead attorney when Reagan fired more than eleven thousand air-traffic controllers, effectively breaking their union and igniting a decades-long attack on labor by the right.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;When Trump finished his speech, it was pouring outside. Standing in the rain, waiting to wave on the motorcade, was Isaiah Goddard, a UAW member who works at a Ford parts plant. “I think it was a very beautiful speech, from the heart,” he said. “It shows that he cares about us autoworkers.” Goddard was eager to take up Trump&#39;s challenge: “I&#39;m going to do everything I can to talk to Shawn Fain and try to get him to endorse Donald Trump.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Two days later, a “solidarity convoy” of Broncos, Jeeps, and Colorados gathered in the parking lot of Local 51, on Detroit&#39;s East Side. The procession cruised toward the city&#39;s downtown, honking to diverse approval: a Black man walking along a deindustrialized artery raised his fist; in tony Indian Village, two white joggers stopped to applaud. Union members had already convened in the parking lot of Solidarity House, the convoy&#39;s destination and the headquarters of the UAW Built in 1951, the low-slung modernist structure is situated on a site along the Detroit River which once contained Edsel Ford&#39;s mansion, orchard, and garden. Loudspeakers in the parking lot blasted DJ Khaled&#39;s “All I Do Is Win” as a group of workers began dancing wildly.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Fain grabbed a microphone and jumped onto the bed of a Ram pickup. He has short-cropped gray hair and wears glasses; he looks a bit like a high-school shop teacher. He began by talking, in a measured drawl, about a plan conceived by Walter Reuther, a former president of the UAW, to use excess capacity at Detroit&#39;s auto factories to make military equipment during the Second World War—to create what came to be called an “arsenal of democracy.” Elements of the plan were adopted by Franklin D. Roosevelt, turning Detroit into an unrivalled industrial powerhouse; a single Chrysler plant produced half the country&#39;s tanks. “Eighty years later, we find ourselves again as a part of the arsenal of democracy,” Fain said. “It&#39;s different this time. The enemy is not a foreign power, across an ocean. The enemy is right here among us—it&#39;s corporate greed.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Fain, who is fifty-four, was raised in Kokomo, Indiana, a city of sixty thousand. Kokomo has five Stellantis power-train plants, which together employ more than seven thousand people. Fain&#39;s mother was a nurse; his father was the town&#39;s chief of police. “I was taught by my parents: Don&#39;t ever forget where you come from, no matter where you go or what you do,” he told me. “We came from destitution.”&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;a data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a23282&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a23282&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;“The doctor will see you shortly.

They had grown up during the Depression, in deep poverty in Tennessee and Kentucky; one grandmother was abandoned with her siblings at an orphanage. Fain&#39;s paternal grandfather was hired by Chrysler in 1937, the year it was organized by the UAW “He was so proud of that job,” Fain said. His grandfather saved every one of his pay stubs for the next thirty-five years. “He kept them in a box until the day he died,” Fain continued. “Before he passed, he was asking his grandkids if there was anything we wanted.” Fain asked for the stubs. “Honestly, I didn&#39;t even know why,” he said. “But those have become a treasure to me.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In 1994, Fain was hired by Chrysler as an electrician. Like many autoworkers, he recalls his first day with a mixture of awe and terror. “They took us out on the shop floor,” he said. “The die-casting plant where I worked was very hot in the summertime—it could reach a hundred thirty degrees.” Overhead cranes carried molten aluminum on a monorail. Sirens went off constantly. “I thought, What the hell did I get myself into?” he told me.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Two years earlier, Fain had voted for Ross Perot over Bill Clinton and George H. W. Bush in the Presidential election. “Pretty simple,” Perot said, in a debate that year. “If you&#39;re paying twelve, thirteen dollars, fourteen dollars an hour for factory workers, and you can move your factory south of the border, pay a dollar an hour for labor . 。 。 have no environmental controls, no pollution controls, and no retirement, and you don&#39;t care about anything but making money, there will be a giant sucking sound going south.” “That resonated with me,” Fain said. “He was the only candidate saying that.”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;GenericCallout&quot;>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;GroupCalloutWrapper&quot;>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;Black and white photograph of a person sitting in the backseat of a Jeep.

They are no different from my family.” Despite his fear that workers will be left out of the green transition, he has little patience for Republican politicians, including Trump, who rebuke it as liberal pandering. Fain notes that Reuther, one of his heroes, was an early proponent of environmentalism; it was part of his broad political vision for the union. He lobbied for the Clean Air Act against opposition from the major American auto companies, and wrote the first check for the first Earth Day, in 1970, to which the UAW became the largest contributor. He once asked, “What good is another week&#39;s vacation if the lake you used to go to is polluted and you can&#39;t swim in it and your kids can&#39;t play in it?”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Walter Reuther was born in 1907 in Wheeling, West Virginia. His father, Valentine, a union organizer, drove a horse-drawn beer wagon and ran for state legislature on the Socialist Party ticket. In 1919, when Eugene Debs was in prison in West Virginia, Valentine took Walter to meet him. (Debs was convicted of violating the Espionage Act for opposing America&#39;s involvement in the First World War.) Walter became a Socialist, too, dropped out of high school, and started working as an apprentice tool-and-die maker at Wheeling Steel. (A four-hundred-pound die landed on his foot, costing him a toe.) He later moved to Detroit, where wages were better, and got a job at a Ford plant while attending what became Wayne State University. In 1932, Reuther left Ford, claiming that he was forced out because of his political activities. He withdrew a chunk of his savings and went to Europe with his brother Victor. They travelled through ten countries, mostly by bicycle, before ending up in the Soviet Union, where they worked for a year and a half at a new automotive plant. The food was unfamiliar—each brother lost about twenty pounds—but Walter found the atmosphere in the plant&#39;s cafeteria “absorbing,” and praised “the wonderful spirit” found among the workers, who sometimes strummed guitars and danced at lunch.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Reuther returned to Detroit in 1935, the year Roosevelt signed the Wagner Act, which guaranteed the right to collectively bargain—and to strike. At the time, conditions in automobile plants were appalling. During a heat wave, hundreds of autoworkers died in plants in Michigan. Autoworkers earned an average of nine hundred dollars a year; the government estimated that a family of four needed nearly double that, at a minimum, to survive. Meanwhile, General Motors was employing a Ku Klux Klan offshoot called the Black Legion to break up union-organizing efforts.&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot;

He participated in the Flint Sit-Down Strike, a violent forty-four-day battle that led to the unionization of GM A similar tactic was used to unionize Chrysler. During the Battle of the Overpass, in which UAW organizers were savagely beaten by Henry Ford&#39;s private security guards outside an assembly plant in Dearborn, Reuther was kicked in the face and thrown down two flights of stairs. Finally, in 1941, after a ten-day strike, the union succeeded in organizing Ford, too.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;During the Second World War, with factories running around the clock, there was a tremendous demand for workers. Hundreds of thousands of them, Black and white, migrated to the city, especially from the South. In June, 1941, Roosevelt issued an executive order banning discriminatory employment practices in the defense industry, the first Presidential civil-rights order since Reconstruction. White workers, sometimes stoked by management, responded with so-called hate strikes—in 1943, twenty-five thousand walked out from Packard after it promoted three Black people to the aircraft assembly line. R. J. Thomas, the UAW president at the time, suspended thirty of the ringleaders, and, with help from government agencies, brought the rest of the strikers back to work. “We will not retreat,” Thomas said. “If we take any other position, our organization is lost.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Reuther was elected president of the UAW in 1946. In a speech that year, he argued that the labor movement should not focus solely on economic gains for its members but instead must “fight for the welfare of the public at large.” Two years later, a hit man nearly assassinated him in his kitchen. Afterward, his renown grew; there was speculation that he would run for President of the US His social-democratic vision came to encompass a variety of causes—nuclear disarmament, environmentalism, and, especially, civil rights. When Martin Luther King, Jr., and dozens of other demonstrators were arrested in Birmingham, in 1963, Reuther sent two deputies with a hundred and sixty thousand dollars in cash to bail them out. He was the only prominently featured white speaker at the March on Washington.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In 1970, Reuther died in a plane crash en route to Black Lake, Michigan, where he was building a thousand-acre labor-education retreat. Not long afterward, real wages for non-college-educated workers began to decline. Oil shocks, deregulation, high interest rates, and globalization increasingly shifted industrial jobs first to the non-union South and then to low-wage foreign countries. By that point, the UAW&#39;s membership had peaked, at one and a half million.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;feature-large-callout&quot; >;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;Black and white photograph of people attending a Donald Trump event holding signs that say Union Members for Trump and...&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653ace4a5b9aced69685b661/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/231106_r43314.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653ace4a5b9aced69685b661/master/w_120,c_limit/231106_r43314.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653ace4a5b9aced69685b661/master/w_240,c_limit/231106_r43314.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653ace4a5b9aced69685b661/master/w_320,c_limit/231106_r43314.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653ace4a5b9aced69685b661/master/w_640,c_limit/231106_r43314.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653ace4a5b9aced69685b661/master/w_960,c_limit/231106_r43314.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653ace4a5b9aced69685b661/master/w_1280,c_limit/231106_r43314.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653ace4a5b9aced69685b661/master/w_1600,c_limit/231106_r43314.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;In September, Donald Trump announced that he would travel to Michigan to support striking autoworkers; the event was held at a non-union manufacturer.&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;The UAW got weaker. Fain traces this downswing in part to the creation of “joint programs”—management-labor partnerships that he believes undermined the union&#39;s independence. Forty years of what Fain calls “company unionism” contributed to a series of bad contracts and laid the foundation for a corruption scandal that broke in 2017, after a federal probe, and led to seventeen convictions, including of two past UAW presidents, in 2021, and three former Chrysler executives. The executives had paid more than three and a half million dollars in bribes to UAW officials, partly through credit cards issued by one of the company&#39;s joint training centers, in Detroit. Union officials also spent more than a million dollars of members&#39; money on golf, steak dinners, cigars, and booze. Earlier this year, Fain narrowly won the UAW presidency, on a promise to restore the union to its Reuther-era militancy. (The UAW is still under a court-appointed monitor.)&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;sztc5w&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Today, the union has three hundred and eighty thousand active members; less than half are employed by the Big Three. (In the seventies, the UAW organized administrative staff at Wayne State; more than a quarter of the union&#39;s members now work in higher education.) The accumulated troubles have driven Fain to take an aggressive approach to the current negotiations—he needs the deal to be good enough to woo workers in the burgeoning electric-vehicle industry, where many competitors, including Toyota and Tesla, are not unionized. Fain told me that there was little to distinguish non-union jobs from many of the positions that the Big Three were offering. He added, “It&#39;s hard to grow a movement when people can&#39;t see the difference.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Two weeks into the strike, the kitchen at Local 12 was buzzing. Doris Jones and a few assistants were making a hundred breakfasts to bring to the picket line. Jones, who is fifty-five years old and has long braids, poured gallons of eggs onto a griddle next to piles of turkey sausage. She had been arriving at the hall at six in the morning every day since the strike started and staying until midnight, sometimes later. “I&#39;m a twenty-four-hour time bomb,” she told me. She has worked at the Jeep plant for more than two decades. Shortly before the strike, she&#39;d placed boxes around the plant to collect donations for the union&#39;s food pantry. It was now stacked with diapers, one of the most coveted commodities, and with packaged food, including rice and instant mashed potatoes, which she gave to any member who came in, along with whatever fresh food—plums, peaches—she could get hold of.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Twenty-four years ago, Jones was in nursing school in Toledo when a counsellor offered her an application for a position at the Chrysler Jeep plant. Two weeks later, she was working in the body shop. “I was using weld guns, connecting stuff like the fenders, hoods, the doors,” she told me. “I was getting burned up—my hair, my body, my clothes—and would go home crying. I said, &#39;I&#39;m not going back.&#39; But as the days went by I knew I had a good job, enough money to take care of my family.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;GenericCallout&quot;>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;Black and white photograph of a person holding a small child they are photographed from behind.

She earns about thirty-three dollars an hour, and in six years will be eligible for a pension. Several members of her family have worked at the plant, too, including one of her three sons, who was a supplemental employee, earning half of what his mother made. He told me, of the strike, “It&#39;s hurting a lot of people who need the money.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;By late September, the number of people coming into the food pantry had increased. Striking plants have gummed up entire supply chains, causing thousands of layoffs in other factories. Those workers do not receive five hundred dollars a week in strike pay from the union, though they can file for unemployment insurance, which, in Ohio, is half a worker&#39;s average weekly wage. One day, as I was leaving the pantry, a middle-aged Black woman wearing tinted glasses walked in. She had been laid off from a Chrysler supplier that shut down because of the strike, and she was still waiting for her first unemployment check. She wrote her name in a ledger, and Jones handed her a bag of food. “I&#39;m very, very thankful,” the woman said quietly, as she slipped out the door.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Marcy Kaptur, the Democratic representative for Ohio&#39;s Ninth District, which includes part of Toledo, describes herself as a “daughter of the UAW” Her mother, who worked at Champion, the spark-plug company, was on the union&#39;s first organizing committee there; her father worked at the Jeep plant for a decade. She believes that this strike is historic. “The conditions have become so untenable in these plants,” she said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In the early nineties, in the House of Representatives, Kaptur led the fight against &lt;em >;NAFTA&lt;/em>;, which nonetheless passed, 234–200. It was a bipartisan bill; a hundred and two Democrats and a hundred and thirty-two Republicans supported it. On the night of the vote, Kaptur said, corporate lobbyists were given a Ways and Means Committee room as an improvised headquarters from which to whip up last-minute support. At one point, she saw John Sweeney, who would soon be elected president of the AFL-CIO, come in through a side door to the Capitol. No one paid attention to him. He held his raincoat over his arm, and walked up the stairs to the gallery, alone.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;After &lt;em >;NAFTA&lt;/em>; passed, Kaptur visited the &lt;em>;maquiladoras&lt;/em>;, mostly electronics and car-part factories just south of the US-Mexico border. The workers there, who had no independent trade unions, were making as little as a dollar an hour. Many of them, she said, lived in “hard paper shacks, if you could call them that,” and had no fresh water. “I&#39;m for free trade among free people,” she went on. “When people are not free, they become exploited by their own governments.” She blamed &lt;em >;NAFTA&lt;/em>; for other deleterious outcomes, such as allowing American agribusinesses to flood Mexico with cheap corn, wiping out much of the country&#39;s subsistence farming. Studies estimate that some two million Mexican farmers lost their livelihoods as a result. Many of them immigrated to the United States; others stayed behind and replaced corn with opium poppies, for producing heroin.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The over-all national income is higher in the United States with free trade, but the majority of people are worse off. According to research by Josh Bivens, of the Economic Policy Institute, trade with low-wage countries costs American workers without a college degree—roughly sixty per cent of the population—twenty-three hundred dollars a year in lost wages, even after accounting for the lower prices of consumer goods. Since 1998, the US has lost more than seventy thousand plants and five million manufacturing jobs, many of them in the Rust Belt. Sherry Lee Linkon, who teaches working-class studies at Georgetown University, coined the phrase “the half-life of deindustrialization” to describe how the ripple effects of factory and mill closures can last for generations. Last month, Anne Case and Angus Deaton, economists at Princeton, published new research showing that life expectancy for Americans without a college degree peaked around 2010 and has been falling ever since. By 2021, not having graduated from college meant eight and a half fewer years of life.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;GenericCallout&quot;>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;GroupCalloutWrapper&quot;>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;Black and white photograph of a plane flying against a cloudy sky towing a banner that reads TRUMP SOLD US OUT&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653ace52042a0d0fdf299d9c/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/231106_r43316.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653ace52042a0d0fdf299d9c/master/w_120,c_limit/231106_r43316.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653ace52042a0d0fdf299d9c/master/w_240,c_limit/231106_r43316.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653ace52042a0d0fdf299d9c/master/w_320,c_limit/231106_r43316.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653ace52042a0d0fdf299d9c/master/w_640,c_limit/231106_r43316.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653ace52042a0d0fdf299d9c/master/w_960,c_limit/231106_r43316.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653ace52042a0d0fdf299d9c/master/w_1280,c_limit/231106_r43316.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653ace52042a0d0fdf299d9c/master/w_1600,c_limit/231106_r43316.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;Despite Trump&#39;s hostility toward labor, he has made criticism of NAFTA, which he calls “the worst trade deal ever made,” a centerpiece of his political career.&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;Black and white photograph of former US President Donald Trump in a crowd of people looking down&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653ace5676baabf44ad3a2a6/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/231106_r43317.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653ace5676baabf44ad3a2a6/master/w_120,c_limit/231106_r43317.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653ace5676baabf44ad3a2a6/master/w_240,c_limit/231106_r43317.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653ace5676baabf44ad3a2a6/master/w_320,c_limit/231106_r43317.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653ace5676baabf44ad3a2a6/master/w_640,c_limit/231106_r43317.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653ace5676baabf44ad3a2a6/master/w_960,c_limit/231106_r43317.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653ace5676baabf44ad3a2a6/master/w_1280,c_limit/231106_r43317.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653ace5676baabf44ad3a2a6/master/w_1600,c_limit/231106_r43317.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;The current strike was meaningless, Trump said, because “under Biden&#39;s mandate the entire car industry will be packed up and shipped to China.”&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Bill Clinton and Barack Obama each won Ohio twice, but neither arrested the economic decline of the state&#39;s working class, which is particularly acute in the traditionally Democratic northern corridor. (During Obama&#39;s first Presidential campaign, he called &lt;em >;NAFTA&lt;/em>; “devastating” and “a big mistake”; in office, he pushed for the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a free-trade deal with eleven countries.) “As deindustrialization occurred, especially in steel-making places like Youngstown, those areas became increasingly redder,” John Russo, an emeritus professor of working-class studies at Youngstown State University, told me. “The reason for that, as much as any other, is the Democrats couldn&#39;t—or wouldn&#39;t—protect those places from what was happening.” In Kaptur&#39;s view, Trump seized on this opening. “He&#39;s like the last brass ring on the merry-go-round,” she said. “He expresses, in his rather demented way, the angst that people feel, the uncertainty that people feel—and he expresses their rage.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The Democrats, meanwhile, are in thrall to the coasts. (The Party&#39;s House leaders are all from coastal states.) “We have to fight like hell for this part of the country, because we&#39;re ignored,” Kaptur said. She noted that the most recent Amtrak appropriations contained “nothing” for rail in the Midwest and twelve billion dollars for the Northeast Corridor. In 2021, Republicans in the Ohio state legislature redrew her district to include more conservative areas, in a clear attempt to oust her, yet she was reëlected, defying expectations. That victory, and those of Senator Sherrod Brown, who has also vigorously opposed free-trade agreements, reflects the salience of the issue. Kaptur is worried about 2024, and beyond. “The Democrats are very fortunate to have many educated people in the Party,” she said. “But, when you start losing the working people of America, you&#39;re in big trouble—and they are.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;A recent New York &lt;em>;Times&lt;/em>;/Siena poll showed Biden slipping badly with working-class voters of all races; his lead among nonwhite, non-college-educated voters has fallen to just sixteen points, down from forty-eight in 2020. Meanwhile, the UAW strike has become something of a cause célèbre for aspiring right-wing populists. In September, the Republican senator Josh Hawley joined a GM picket line in Wentzville, Missouri, despite his previous support for a right-to-work bill, which would have weakened the finances and the bargaining power of the state&#39;s unions. Soon afterward, the Republican senator JD Vance, who had a previous career in venture capital, joined Kaptur on the Jeep picket line. “First time here?” she asked him.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The union&#39;s stand-up-strike strategy is paying off. In late September, minutes before a 10 &lt;em >;AM&lt;/em>; deadline at which more plants would go offline, Stellantis agreed to reinstate its cost-of-living adjustment. After the UAW threatened to strike at a lucrative General Motors plant that makes Cadillac SUVs, the company committed to placing new battery plants under its master agreement with the union. (Later, that plant went on strike anyway.) “We&#39;ve been told the EV future must be a race to the bottom,” Fain, wearing an “Eat the Rich” T-shirt, said in a video announcement. “Now we&#39;ve called their bluff.” By late October, he had expanded the strike to include more than forty-five thousand workers across twenty-two states, and the most profitable facilities for each of the three automakers.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Then came the breakthrough: the tentative agreement with Ford. Fain instructed his members there to get back to work, so that the company could start building and selling cars again as quickly as possible, which would further pressure General Motors and Stellantis to settle. According to the Anderson Economic Group, the Big Three have lost more than four billion dollars since the strike began.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The economic pain has also been deepening for the workers still on strike. After speaking to the convoy in Detroit, Fain paid a visit to the Jeep picket line in Toledo. He was received with adulation, but also drew notes of skepticism. “How long do you think before we start struggling?,” one worker, who was holding his young daughter, asked. Another said, “Some of us are struggling already. Like, is that a discussion?” (For most workers, strike pay is less than half a weekly paycheck.) Fain nodded. “It sucks,” he said. “We don&#39;t want to be out here. But at the end of the day the company&#39;s put us in this position. It&#39;s a choice: Do we strike? Or do we continue to go backward?”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;feature-large-callout&quot; >;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;Black and white photograph of people marching in a picket line with a large road in the background&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653ace5a68e701fce6dfdebe/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/231106_r43318.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653ace5a68e701fce6dfdebe/master/w_120,c_limit/231106_r43318.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653ace5a68e701fce6dfdebe/master/w_240,c_limit/231106_r43318.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653ace5a68e701fce6dfdebe/master/w_320,c_limit/231106_r43318.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653ace5a68e701fce6dfdebe/master/w_640,c_limit/231106_r43318.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653ace5a68e701fce6dfdebe/master/w_960,c_limit/231106_r43318.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653ace5a68e701fce6dfdebe/master/w_1280,c_limit/231106_r43318.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653ace5a68e701fce6dfdebe/master/w_1600,c_limit/231106_r43318.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;For most workers, strike pay is less than half a weekly paycheck. “It sucks,” Fain said. “The company&#39;s put us in this position.

Toledo appeared to be in somewhat better shape than other Rust Belt cities where I had spent time—Racine, Youngstown, River Rouge—but the emptiness was unmooring. The United States has destroyed its industrial base more deeply than other Western countries have. Given that both Democrats and Republicans had a hand in the destruction, the political fallout has been unpredictable. Many workers I met seemed to view the upcoming Presidential race with distance and cynicism. They were more animated by the visceral, immediate politics of the strike.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;By the time I got back to the hall, it was getting dark. I saw Jones bustling around. It had been another long day; she looked exhausted but also content. Someone had donated trays of fried chicken, and she was going to the picket to deliver them. We walked out to her white Jeep and she opened the back door. The smell was enticing, and she insisted I take a piece. I asked what she had thought of Fain&#39;s visit. She answered slowly and deliberately. “He spoke the truth,” she said. Anxiety about the strike was rising among the door-line-crew members, but Fain had managed to calm them. “I saw them being a little more at ease, listening to the words he was saying,” she said. “He was reassuring them that they&#39;re going to be great.” She shut the door, waved goodbye, and drove back to the line. ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 28 Oct 2023 19:06:01 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[My Grandmother and the Canine Detective]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-weekend-essay/my-grandmother-and-the-canine-detective]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-28T10:00:00.000Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653c3039150b1055652375c2/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Zhou_Inspector_Rex_4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;article >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attribute-verso-pattern=&quot;article-body&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;ArticlePageChunks&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;My grandmother, who is ninety-two, has moved three times in her life. She was born in a small town in the province of Shandong, China, and, when she was twenty-three, she took a boat to Shanghai. When she was sixty-three, she moved to Sydney, Australia—where I was born—and then, when she was eighty-five, came with me and my mother to New York. There are a few similarities across these places: all three are port cities—populous, but not the capital—that grew fat off the trade of an eastern coast. Another constant in her life, at least in the past twenty or so years, has been the Austrian police-procedural television show “Inspector Rex,” which is about a crime-fighting dog.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Rex” débuted in 1994, the year I was born, and ran for eighteen seasons over the course of twenty-one years. A standard episode takes forty-five minutes and follows the titular dog, Rex, who is part of a crack homicide unit in Vienna. (The show was originally filmed in German.) Rex&#39;s colleagues include a lead detective who changes every three to four seasons; an earnest deputy; and a bumbling third guy who stays at the station. Supposedly a family program, the show blends an earnest nineties sensibility—there is a running joke in which Rex finds new ways to steal ham rolls from one of the lesser detectives—with an occasionally macabre flourish. People are killed with poisons, stabbed, thrown from the balcony of a museum, hit over the head with a large wrench. In one typical episode, the lead detective, Moser, investigates a murder in which a woman has been hypnotized into stabbing her boyfriend. As the villain is about to kill Moser with a motorbike, Rex launches out of a bush and tackles him.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;My grandmother is a big fan of the show, and many people around the world evidently share her disposition. It was immensely popular in its native Austria and Germany, across Europe, and in Australia, where it ran during prime time on the Special Broadcasting Service, a government-funded multicultural broadcaster. When “Rex” was cancelled by its Austrian channel after ten years, in 2004, the Italian national broadcaster, &lt;em >;RAI&lt;/em>;, bought the rights and moved Rex to Rome, such was the nation&#39;s love for the dog. From the streets of Vienna, he now frolicked along the Fountain of Neptune, in the Piazza Navona, with a handsome new Italian human partner named Fabbri. The show has also been remade in Poland (“Komisarz Alex”), Portugal (“Inspetor Max”), Lithuania (“Inspektorius Mažylis”), Slovakia (“Rex”), and Canada (“Hudson &amp;amp; Rex”).&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;This level of intercontinental popularity can be attributed to two factors. One is the show&#39;s reliable villain-of-the-week structure. The second is its star—a stately German shepherd who is clearly and visibly intelligent in a way that transcends language. My school years in Australia coincided with a kind of Rex-mania. I remembered news stories about how pet owners would put the show on for their dogs, who would bark and gleefully wag their tails at the screen. Pope Benedict XVI, who was German, was reportedly a fan, and watched it with his brother Georg, who claimed to be friends with a man from the Bavarian city of Regensburg who owned one of the dogs that played Rex. We didn&#39;t have a dog. In our house, the show was for my grandmother and for me. My mother raised me alone, and sometimes worked late. Looking after me became my grandmother&#39;s responsibility, and, in a way, vice versa. Many nights, we would watch “Rex” together while we waited for my mother to come home.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;For an elderly woman originally from Shandong, then naturalized in Shanghai, a mostly kinetic show in German about a charismatic, industrious dog was perfect. Unlike me, she couldn&#39;t read the English subtitles. But nobody was under any illusion that that mattered. In Rex, my grandmother and I had a being of pure legibility, one who wordlessly told us exactly what he was doing. (The plots, of course, were finagled so that each case could be solved by something a dog could do.) My grandmother watched with a rather flat affect—the humans sparked very little reaction from her, but when the dog appeared she would always point and make sure I was watching, and remark to me or herself about how smart dogs are.&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;There is a phrase we like to say to each other when we watch “Inspector Rex.” It&#39;s a construction in Shanghainese, whose elegance and full power can only be glimpsingly translated into English. It&#39;s four words, or, more accurately, characters. Written in simplified Chinese, it is 狗出来了; transcribed phonetically, in our accent, it&#39;s something like &lt;em>;Gou tse leh le&lt;/em>;. Literally, it means “The dog [&lt;em>;gou&lt;/em>;] has come out [&lt;em>;tse leh le&lt;/em>;].” Parsed into more fluid English, you&#39;d say, “The dog is here,” or, most perfectly, something like “There he is.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;What people would consider the default language of China, Standard Chinese‚ which English speakers colloquially call Mandarin—was only made official in the nineteen-fifties. (Standard Chinese is based on Mandarin, but the two are not the same.) Shanghainese, which is the language that my family speaks at home, is often called a dialect. There is a common misconception that Mandarin and Cantonese are the only two stars in the Chinese language—and that all people speak one or the other. But the history of China is really that of hundreds of languages: Shanghainese and other regional “dialects,” like Fujianese, Hokkien, and Hunanese, are hundreds of years old, have millions of speakers, and developed independently of and even before Standard Chinese, which is based on the dialect of Northern China, where Beijing is situated.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Linguists have tried to draw hard boundaries around what is and isn&#39;t a dialect, but nobody can. Looking at the constituent parts—speech, intelligibility—many “dialects” have the same level of similarity or difference with one another as “languages” do. In 1945, the sociolinguist Max Weinreich popularized the saying that “a language is a dialect with an army and a navy.” Which is to say, a “dialect” becomes a language when it is spoken by the people in power.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;During the Qing Dynasty—which lasted, shockingly, until 1911—the imperial language of China was Manchu, a now-endangered language from a region in the northeast that overlaps with modern-day Russia. Cantonese, from the city of Guangzhou, on the Pearl River Delta, in China&#39;s south, was in many ways the dominant language of the early years of global commerce and the first stages of migration into China. Now, in mainland China, Standard Chinese reigns through the hard mechanism of the modern Chinese state, post-1949, when Beijing was remade as the capital, and its local accent rolled out across the country.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Shanghainese, which is part of the Wu language group, originating near the Yangtze River, is thousands of years old. (Wu Chinese has about eighty million native speakers—more than Italian and almost as many as German—making it one of the most spoken native languages in the world.) It&#39;s common for people in China to still speak their local language with family and friends, but to learn Standard Chinese at school, hear it on TV, and speak it at work. Satellite TV channels in China are banned, by law, from broadcasting in local dialects; ethnic minorities, including the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-uyghurs-forced-to-process-the-worlds-fish&quot;>;Uyghurs&lt;/a>;, are made to learn Standard Chinese. In Hong Kong, Cantonese has become a de-facto language of protest, especially during the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/12/16/hong-kongs-protest-movement-and-the-fight-for-the-citys-soul&quot;>;2019 pro-democracy demonstrations&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Neither Shanghainese nor Standard Chinese is my grandmother&#39;s original language; she grew up speaking the Shandong dialect. But in our family we have always spoken to one another in Shanghainese, which is my mother&#39;s first language, the bridge. My grandmother learned it when she moved to Shanghai as a young woman; I learned it as a child in Sydney. This is undoubtedly a case of confirmation bias, but I find it wonderfully easy to speak. It is slangy and pliable, lacks as rigid a tone structure as other Chinese languages, and has sounds that are forgiving and easy to make. There is a Chinese idiom about how soft Shanghainese sounds on the ear: people call it “the tender speech of Wu.” Sometimes, to me, it sounds more similar to Korean than to Standard Chinese—the Korean island of Jeju is only three hundred miles away—lower, open vowels, a rapid firing of soft consonants.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Many people my grandmother&#39;s age and older struggle to speak Standard Chinese. (The countrywide push to make it the national language only happened midway through the twentieth century, later than the country&#39;s adoption of the radio.) My grandmother can, but does so with an intense northern accent, which to a lot of younger Chinese-born people makes it impenetrable. She was on the phone recently, with a health-insurance company. They patched a translator onto the line. But something as simple as her address sounds so heavily different that the translator couldn&#39;t understand. “I&#39;m sorry, she has a very strong accent,” the translator said to the phone operator. My mother and I have to keep reminding my grandmother to speak &lt;em>;putonghua&lt;/em>;, the Chinese name for Standard Chinese, which means the common tongue.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;To say, then, in English, “There he is,” is good—but still incomplete. The emergence of this Austrian (and later Italian) dog lives, to me, in Shanghainese. Translators butt up against this problem all the time: how to replicate the elegance of a phrase in one language to another. In Shanghainese, the fact that &lt;em>;gou&lt;/em>; (“dog”) comes first is perfect. (Articles are rarely used in Chinese.) Linguistically, &lt;em>;Gou tse leh le&lt;/em>; replicates the sensation of how the &lt;em>;gou tse leh le&lt;/em>;. That -&lt;em>;ou&lt;/em>; sounds, to me, like the first second of a bark—the dog is there, sticking his nose out before the verb, the preposition. And &lt;em>;tse leh le&lt;/em>; is a figurative coming-out, existing beyond time markers, nothing as stodgy as “he has emerged.” (Chinese verbs do not have tenses, let alone the past perfect.) What is he coming out from? It&#39;s a bit metaphysical—the dog is emerging from the absence of dog. It&#39;s like what you&#39;d say when the curtain rises and the dancers pour out, something more like “voilà!”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I love this—the things formed in the unique nooks of a language. It&#39;s not like the words for “dog” or “come out” don&#39;t exist in English—it&#39;s that the grammar itself, or the rules of word order, don&#39;t let you express it to the same effect. Roland Kelts once noted in this magazine, on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/lost-in-translation&quot;>;the difficulty of translating Haruki Murakami&lt;/a>;, that Japanese frequently allows for sentences not to have subjects, giving many of Murakami&#39;s lines a wonderful vagueness that is crushed in English; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/a-lifetime-of-lessons-in-mrs-dalloway&quot;>;Virginia Woolf&lt;/a>; once wrote that it is “useless . 。 。 to read Greek in translation,” because “we can never hope to get the whole fling of a sentence” the same.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;There are other blunt, beautiful phrases my grandmother says to me, in Shanghainese, that are hard to say to others. She often says something that means, in its bare bones, that she only loves three people: me, my mother, and my aunt. My Shanghainese is mostly confined to the domestic monosyllabism of childhood—asking whether she has eaten or what to watch on TV, telling her that I love her. When asked by friends how my grandmother spends her days, I often feel a bit embarrassed to relay the truth—that she watches a TV show about a dog in a language she can&#39;t understand. I feel even more embarrassed that my grandmother and I, even though we live together and talk every day, are unable to hold a moderately complex conversation.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In April, 2020, early in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tag/coronavirus&quot;>;pandemic&lt;/a>;, my grandmother contracted &lt;em >;COVID&lt;/em>;-19. She had to go to the hospital alone. They had no translator for her, to tell her what was happening and where she was going. They wrote her name down wrong in the computer—that classic mixup of Chinese last name and first name—which meant she was not searchable for many hours. When I finally got her on the hospital phone, I could not properly tell her how long, or why, she had to be there. I did not know how to say “trust,” which broke my heart. &lt;em >;COVID&lt;/em>; was a new disease, and I did not know how to explain it in Chinese, either. Eventually, one doctor, who spoke Chinese, told her she had a disease in her lungs. Her symptoms were mild and we didn&#39;t want to worry her. We were lucky, and she recovered.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;People born now in mainland China increasingly do not speak their regional language. In her old age, and her more solitary life, my grandmother has slipped more and more into Shanghainese. Her Chinese is peppered with it; she is even forgetting her original Shandong dialect. I am learning Standard Chinese, but when I practice with her, she often doesn&#39;t understand. In a way, this means the two of us, with our inability to communicate in more common tongues, have a whole language that we use mostly to speak to each other. The category of things we both understand—our TV shows, our overlapping Shanghainese—is narrow, but deep.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;A few years ago, we took in a dog, a foster greyhound with a sweet disposition. My grandmother loved him. She would often greet him, and me, with a full-mouthed pantomime frown, and tell me almost instantly, before saying hello or anything else, that the dog was hungry, and that I should feed him. This would happen, of course, regardless of when he had last eaten. I was surprised to be hit with this full-bore cannon of doting and guilt, a treatment I thought she reserved for my mother, not me.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;My grandmother spoke to the dog in Shanghainese. She told him, looking directly into his brown eyes, that she loved him. And, as we scuttled around the house trying to open doors without letting the dog out, we got to say our phrase—&lt;em>;gou tse leh le&lt;/em>;—for real this time. ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 28 Oct 2023 19:06:01 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[A Student Handbook for the School from Your Nightmares]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.newyorker.com/humor/daily-shouts/a-student-handbook-for-the-school-from-your-nightmares]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-28T10:00:00.000Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653a9d01763674b88ec88c95/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Shouts-Hakala-Student-Nightmares.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;article >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attribute-verso-pattern=&quot;article-body&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;ArticlePageChunks&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;School Mission&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The mission of this nightmare school is to challenge students and prepare them for a role in a society in which everything is also terrible.

data-event-click=&quot;{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://thebatesstudent.com/24771/news/a-conversation- with-lewiston-mayor-carl-sheline/&amp;quot;}&quot;

作为他们一年级迎新表格的一部分。）&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“昨晚，我正准备走出教学楼，感觉警报没什么大不了的，这时美国学生拦住了我并告诉我呆在室内。我意识到在这种情况下我所受的教育和训练是多么不足。作为一名国际学生，我从未被教导过正确的反应，即逃跑、躲藏和战斗。直到昨晚我才知道这一点。当我看到美国同龄人的反应以及我的反应时，这种反差让我大吃一惊。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“决定去美国上大学后，中国人会对我说，‘你为什么冒着生命危险去这个国家？美国在中国媒体的印象中是一个疯狂的地方，每天都有大规模枪击事件，政府几乎没有控制和干预。我总是告诉人们‘不，这只是一种刻板印象和误解，你知道吗？我很好。我的生命没有危险。我们很安全。别再担心我了。别担心我去一个看起来不安全的国家，因为根据个人经验，那里是安全的。”但现在，我不太确定了。” ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot;
