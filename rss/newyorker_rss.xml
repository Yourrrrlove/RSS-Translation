/a>;今年早些时候在该系列的最后一季。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;默多克，&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tag/fox-news&quot;>;福克斯新闻&lt;/ a>;《华尔街日报》和《纽约邮报》以及英国和澳大利亚保守派报纸的创始人和所有者，曾开玩笑说他坚信自己的不朽。 92 岁的他尽管多次遭受前列腺癌、新冠肺炎、2018 年在长子的超级游艇上摔倒导致椎骨骨折和脊髓血肿的困扰，但仍坚持不懈。默多克宣布，他将辞去福克斯公司和新闻集团这两家主要控股公司的董事长职务。默多克在给员工的一封信中写道，毫无疑问，这一声明将引发人们对他的福祉的新猜测：“我们的公司和我一样，身体健康。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;那么，他为什么要辞去公司职务呢？他在声明中只是说，“现在是我承担不同角色的时候了。”考虑到他的年龄，这一点很难反驳。但是，虽然洛根·罗伊在世时拒绝将权力交给他的任何一个孩子，但默多克也可能试图确保他的公司永久落入他选定的继承人的长子拉克兰手中。默多克在致员工的信中将拉克兰描述为“充满激情、有原则的领导者”。展望未来，这位52岁的接班人将成为拥有家族报纸的新闻集团的唯一董事长，并且他将继续担任拥有福克斯新闻频道的福克斯公司的首席执行官和执行主席。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;然而，表面上的权力交接并没有完全解决问题。默多克去世后，他两家公司的最终控制权将转移给一个家族信托，他的四个最大的孩子——普鲁登斯、拉克伦、詹姆斯和伊丽莎白——在该信托中每个人都拥有平等的投票权。 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/09/23/no-james-murdoch-doesnt-watch-succession&quot;>;James&lt;/a>;，在家族企业中担任高级职务在 2020 年辞职之前，他一直被视为默多克帝国的另类（且不那么保守）未来领导人，理由是“对公司新闻媒体发布的某些社论内容和某些其他战略决策存在分歧”。如果他能说服他的姐妹们支持他，理论上他可以驱逐拉克兰，并把它带向不同的方向，甚至卖掉它。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;所有这些都只是猜测。毫无争议的是，2023 年对于默多克和他的企业来说是极其艰难的一年。福克斯公司和新闻集团在 2013 年之前一直是一家公司的一部分，今年年初，其外部股东迫使默多克放弃了重组两​​家公司的努力。四月份，福克斯新闻&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/annals-of-communications/the-stunning-end-of-dominions-case-against-fox-news&quot;>;同意付款&lt;/a>; Dominion 投票系统 7.875 亿美元，以避免对 Dominion 的 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/annals-of-communications/what-dominion-has-to-prove-in- 进行审判it-case- against-fox-news&quot;>;声称&lt;/a>;有线新闻网络故意广播有关 2020 年总统选举结果的虚假信息，包括声称 Dominion 的投票机将选票从唐纳德·特朗普转向了乔·拜登。&lt;/a>; p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;巨额和解引发了人们对 2020 年大选后福克斯新闻的管理及其对自治领诉讼的处理的质疑。在审前证词中，默多克作证说，他相信选举是公平的，特朗普没有被欺骗而获胜。他还承认，福克斯新闻的一些评论员支持了选举被窃取的谎言。根据 &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/dp/1250879272&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot; https://www.amazon.com/dp/1250879272&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/dp/1250879272&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;一个新的全部在作家迈克尔·沃尔夫 (Michael Wolff) 的书中，默多克在 2022 年告诉朋友，这场诉讼可能会让福克斯损失 5000 万美元。在同意了近十六倍的财务和解后，福克斯解雇了其黄金时段主持人和最大的主持人塔克·卡尔森 (Tucker Carlson)。收视明星，不久前，他在广播中描述了&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/american-chronicles/the-devastating-new-history-of-the-january-sixth-叛乱&quot;>;1 月 6 日对国会大厦的袭击被称为“主要是和平的混乱”。但是，即使在与 Dominion 达成和解后，福克斯仍面临另一家投票技术公司 Smartmatic 提起的第二起可能代价高昂的诽谤诉讼。&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>; &lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;在另一次挫折中，默多克和福克斯新闻似乎在 2024 年共和党初选中支持佛罗里达州州长&lt;a href= “https://www.newyorker.com/tag/ron-desantis&quot;>;罗恩·德桑蒂斯&lt;/a>;，他的竞选活动已经失败。最近，福克斯的两名高管被迫前往特朗普位于新泽西州的高尔夫球场（这位前总统在那里度过了夏天），并呼吁他出现在该电视网的共和党电视辩论中。他们的请求遭到拒绝。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;卡尔森离开后，福克斯新闻的收视率急剧下降，但此后有所反弹。从更大的角度来看，默多克和所有旧媒体所有者一样，看到自己的资产和影响力受到互联网、社交媒体和流媒体崛起的挑战。也许他最明智的商业决策是在 2019 年做出的，当时他 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-hidden-succession-news-in-rupert-murdochs-sale-of-正当流媒体战争开始时，fox-entertainment-to disney&quot;>;将福克斯的许多&lt;/a>;电视和电影资产以 713 亿美元的价格出售给华特迪士尼公司。与迪士尼交易时，默多克刚刚年满 88 岁，可以想象，他本可以拿着这笔钱然后退休。但是，和洛根·罗伊一样，默多克也不想退出。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;即使在周四，他也热衷于平息有关他即将退休的猜测。福克斯公司和新闻集团宣布，他已被任命为两家公司的“名誉主席”。默多克在全球范围内流传的致员工的信中表示，他将继续“每天参与新闻和想法”，并补充道，“当我访问你们的国家和公司时，你们可以期待在很晚的时候在办公​​室见到我。”周五下午。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;默多克还明确表示，他的新闻运作的政治倾向将保持不变。在宣称自己是“自由”事业并表示拉克兰“绝对致力于”这一事业后，他攻击竞争对手的新闻机构“兜售政治叙事而不是追求真相”。当然，兜售政治叙事是福克斯新闻几十年来一直在做的事情。至少在这方面，周四的宣布后不会有任何改变。 ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot;

aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/ div>;&lt;div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;一季又一季，这条弧线成为了该剧的一大特色，女主角从家庭主妇到家庭主妇，从妈妈到妈妈博主，从选美皇后的旅程美容产品线的老板。随着该剧在2007-08年编剧罢工期间掀起电视真人秀节目过多的浪潮，它成为一本关于如何在经济衰退后不稳定的经济中赚钱的手册。它敦促女性重返工作岗位，即使不再有真正的工作。不幸的是，2008年我大学刚毕业。毕业前的一个学期，我和朋友们挤在宿舍公共休息室里看《纽约主妇》第一季。我几乎没有意识到一部关于财富的节目正在让我做好没有财富的生活的准备。我们这一代人默认成为了朱迪斯的女儿。和他们一样，我们从相信我们拥有某种社会安全网，到认识到我们必须自己拼凑出一张社会安全网。十五年后，我们都是家庭主妇，把我们的收入像碎布一样拼凑在一起，吸尘器吸走了我们安全和稳定的旧梦想，而我们却狼吞虎咽地吞下了一部关于女性做同样事情的节目。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;2005年斯科特·邓洛普 (Scott Dunlop) 是加利福尼亚州奥兰治县科托德卡萨 (Coto de Caza) 的居民，他正在寻找人选来出演一部关于他富裕邻居的纪录片式电视节目。他对那些在丈夫下班后“在‘牧场’里狂奔”的妻子们尤其着迷，邓洛普在这本书中告诉记者戴夫·奎因“&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https: //www.amazon.com/Not-All-Diamonds-Ros%C3%A9-Housewives/dp/1250898080&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot; ;https://www.amazon.com/Not-All-Diamonds-Ros%C3%A9-Housewives/dp/1250898080&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Not-All-Diamonds- Ros%C3%A9-Housewives/dp/1250898080&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;不是所有的钻石和桃红葡萄酒：来自住过它的人的真正家庭主妇的内幕&lt;/a>;”（2021 ）。对邓洛普的“孤独、无聊的家庭主妇”的照片很感兴趣。 。 。 Bravo 母公司 NBCUniversal 的高管根据他的宣传委托制作了一档真人秀。他们决定将节目命名为“奥兰治县的真实主妇”，希望另外两部讲述富人下流生活的有剧本的连续剧《绝望主妇》和《橘郡主妇》的受欢迎能够提高他们的真人秀节目的收视率.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;但该剧还必须符合 Bravo 目标观众的期望，高管们将其称为“威尔和格蕾丝”受众群体，指的是关于同性恋者威尔和他的女室友的流行情景喜剧， 优雅。换句话说，制片人正在寻找能够吸引生活在大城市的高收入男同性恋者和单身女性的节目，这些观众通过改头换面的节目《粉雄救兵》给电视网带来了最后的大热门。 《粉雄救兵》演员阵容中的五位男同性恋者是烹饪、室内设计和时尚方面的专家。 Bravo shows like “Top Chef” and “Project Runway” followed highly skilled competitors aiming for a leg up in their careers. “Our characters worked hard every day,” Lauren Zalaznick, the head of Bravo, told Quinn, and the Housewives were no different.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;To attract the viewers the network wanted, the show had to perform a careful balancing act. Their lives of leisure needed to be opulent enough to be aspirational, but never so fulfilling that not working seemed enviable. During the first two seasons of “Orange County,” audiences were introduced to Jo De La Rosa, twenty-four, the stay-at-home fiancée of Slade Smiley, thirty-six, a successful real-estate agent. Their story line centered on Slade, the traditionalist—“I would love to see Jo step up and become that housewife that I&#39;ve dreamed of”—trying to domesticate Jo, an independent, young woman who wanted bigger things than to lounge around Slade&#39;s Coto home all day in a velour tracksuit. Eventually, Jo left Slade to pursue a music career, resulting in the 2008 song “U Can&#39;t Control Me.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;In “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/What-Women-Watched-Daytime-Television/dp/0292706278&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/What-Women-Watched-Daytime-Television/dp/0292706278&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/What-Women-Watched-Daytime-Television/dp/0292706278&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;What Women Watched: Daytime Television in the 1950s&lt;/a>;” (2005), the scholar Marsha F. Cassidy argues that TV shows like “Queen for a Day” and “Strike It Rich” taught women how to fulfill their roles as thoughtful, even skilled consumers. The “Real Housewives” franchise has updated this model for the twenty-first century. The show&#39;s castmates are not producers, not only of their own story lines on the show but also of product lines off the show, which, in turn, can become story lines. (“I love how the insults they fling at one another now are about their businesses,” a friend and occasional watcher of the show observed.) If a mid-century housewife had dinner on the table every night, a Bravo Housewife is compiling the recipes into a cookbook that will hit the New York &lt;em>;Times&lt;/em>; best-seller list. Since the first episode of “RHOC” aired, Housewives have shilled scented candles, jewelry, vibrators, activewear, false eyelashes, shapewear, stun guns, and seemingly every variant of white wine. Even on the family-oriented “Real Housewives of New Jersey,” Melissa Gorga, who told the camera, “I was always told to be a cook in the kitchen, a lady in the parlor, and a whore in the bedroom,” tweaked those three clauses for the section titles in her book, “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Love-Italian-Style-Secrets-Marriage/dp/1250054931&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Love-Italian-Style-Secrets-Marriage/dp/1250054931&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Love-Italian-Style-Secrets-Marriage/dp/1250054931&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;Love Italian Style: The Secrets of My Hot and Happy Marriage&lt;/a>;” (2014).&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In the summer of 2020, I strained a muscle watching a Real Housewife—not one of the shows, but a yoga video made by Bethenny Frankel, an original cast member of “The Real Housewives of New York City” (“RHONYC”). Who better, I thought, to train me in flexibility? In the middle of a fight with her castmate Ramona Singer, on a strongly encouraged girls&#39; trip to the Berkshires, when Ramona shouted, “You were topless in a movie, you had sex on a waterbed, and you kissed another woman,” Bethenny un-pretzeled herself from a couch in seconds, lifted her legs wide open in the air, and yelled, “Mention it all!,” her vagina functioning as a physical manifestation of the exclamation point. “Mention it all,” Bethenny repeated, now standing in a kind of half forward-bend pose as she talked down to a still-seated Ramona, “because you know what—I fucking earn my own living.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Bethenny was referring to her wildly successful Skinnygirl brand, which includes low-calorie bottled cocktails, such as her marquee product, the Skinnygirl Margarita, and also sugar-free jams, five New York &lt;em>;Times&lt;/em>; best-selling books, and the yoga video I struggled to follow. Bethenny was the show&#39;s first hustler, outlining a blueprint for how to monetize wifedom and its adjacent states of being.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;She was “RHONYC” &#39;s striving single gal, living in a cramped one-bedroom apartment while her castmates played tennis in the Hamptons and shuffled their kids back and forth between Upper East Side condos and private schools. Bravo&#39;s scouts first spotted Bethenny, who wanted to be the Martha Stewart of health food, on the polo grounds at Bridgehampton. In his memoir “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Most-Talkative-Stories-Front-Culture/dp/125003146X&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Most-Talkative-Stories-Front-Culture/dp/125003146X&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Most-Talkative-Stories-Front-Culture/dp/125003146X&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;Most Talkative: Stories from the Front Lines of Pop Culture&lt;/a>;” (2012), Cohen writes that Bethenny was “searching for a photographer to take her picture, hoping that that picture might land somewhere and lead to something.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Bethenny quickly became a fan favorite, but her workaholic sensibility and tireless promotional activities were a source of perpetual friction with castmates. In Season 2, she drives to meet her castmate the Countess Luann de Lesseps—whose husband&#39;s family built the Panama and Suez canals—in a Skinnygirl-branded Volkswagen Beetle. “You drive that around town?” Luann laughs. Bethenny, annoyed, says, “If you can wear an Hermès belt, I can [drive] a Skinnygirl car.” Luann, confused, replies, “They&#39;re not paying me for the Hermès belt, though.” The show cuts to Bethenny in a confessional, declaring, “Exactly, you dumb drag queen. They&#39;re not paying you. That&#39;s the point.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;By later episodes, the jabs were getting sharper. When “RHONYC” &#39;s Jill Zarin, the wife of Bobby Zarin (of Zarin fabrics and upholstery), couldn&#39;t find time on her schedule for a tennis game, she found herself being criticized for, of all things, being a housewife. “What exactly does Jill do other than shop, eat lunch, and eat dinner, and go on trips?” someone asks. “Not much,” replies Ramona, who had started a Christian accessories company, in 2005, with her husband, Mario. Jill appears blindsided. Were shopping, lunching, and vacationing not the activities that Bravo wanted to film?&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;This exchange presaged what would become a major, franchise-defining showdown—Bethenny, the Skinnygirl mogul, versus Jill, the fat-cat housewife—sparked by a single word: “hobby.” Bethenny reportedly told Jill that she needed to get one. Jill let it be known that Bethenny had told her to find a hobby, “and you know what I did, and it wasn&#39;t hanging out with her anymore.” When Jill learns that Bethenny (and her fiancé, Jason) is set to get a spinoff, “Bethenny Ever After,” she tries to rally the other women to stop filming with Bethenny. “That&#39;s kind of my livelihood,” Bethenny tells her when it comes out at the reunion. Alex McCord, a relatively less affluent cast member who lost her job at Victoria&#39;s Secret during the recession, also confronts Jill over her behavior toward Bethenny. “You are in high school. You are a mean girl. And while you are in high school, I am in Brooklyn,” she fumes, announcing the borough&#39;s name like a death sentence, “trying to survive in this economy, working.”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;nx8fqh&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Disgusted by Jill, viewers wrote in to Bravo, and I, too, watching this season, felt a catharsis seeing this rich fabric maven called out for going after someone else&#39;s sole means to support herself. Jill was a made-for-TV villain for the Great Recession era. And Bethenny, with her brashness, her willingness to mention it all, her side hustles so numerous that it was impossible to identify her main income source, was a perfect hero. Watching her, you might think it was possible that you, too, could attain financial security by broadcasting your personal dramas to millions in order to stick a logo on sugar-free salad dressing.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;There is nothing remarkable about using a spot on a reality-TV show as a vehicle to advertise existing businesses or launch new ones. What makes the “Real Housewives” unique is its relationship to marriage, which allows it to brand the show&#39;s entrepreneurial imperative as a feminist project. The show, with scant exception, presents the institution as so archaic and repressive that you find yourself praying these women sell enough scented candles on Instagram to light it on fire.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In 2012, when a new Housewife was cast on Season 5 of “The Real Housewives of Atlanta,” the young and glamorous Porsha Stewart, wife of the Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Kordell Stewart, she described her ideal day as “calling my various girlfriends who don&#39;t work, going to have some lunch with them, and then coming home to my husband.” But it turns out she has no choice but to come home to her husband. She&#39;s on a short leash, as we learn when Porsha and the cast go on a strongly encouraged girls&#39; trip to Vegas. On a limo ride, Porsha becomes alarmed when she discovers that they&#39;re on their way to a strip club rather than the burlesque show she has been promised. Her husband, Porsha objects, would not be OK with her seeing strippers. In a limousine ride the next day, she tells the women that they should be glad she&#39;s there at all: “For him to let me on this girls&#39; trip, first of all, I&#39;m proud of him for real.” At the word “let,” the other women fell silent, their wallets filled with the money they had earned themselves, from their day jobs, product lines, and Donkey Booty workout videos. The spectre of Porsha&#39;s controlling husband—he later locks her out of the house when she returns home late one night—has the effect of softening any critique we might be tempted, in the moment at least, of levying at the Housewives and their unreflective embrace of capitalist feminism.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Porsha&#39;s insertion at this point in the show marks a common device on the “Real Housewives,” wherein the series starts over with a new Housewife who is still only a housewife. Porsha introduces herself as the granddaughter of the civil-rights activist Hosea Williams. When we meet her, she&#39;s volunteering for a charity established in his name: “It is the largest foundation of the South as far as feeding people who don&#39;t have any means of support for themselves because of the um, what—what is it? The um . 。 。 What are we in? A recession? Yeah.” By the end of the season, she has started a premium wig-and-hair-extension brand, a venture memorably characterized by the Housewife Kenya Moore as “ThreeDollarBundleHair.com.” Bundles do not, as Kenya implied, go for three dollars. Brazilian Wavy Bundle Deals, in fact, will run you a hundred and eighty-seven dollars.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The franchise dramatizes this transition over and over again on its various series: once most of the Housewives have become financially independent, a new cast member intent on cosplaying Betty Draper is interjected. Her housewifedom is soon revealed to be a mirage, but no fear, she has something real she can rely on: an assemblage of random gigs. The show needs these actual housewives to establish brand continuity but also to fulfill its pedagogical role in women&#39;s media. We wait for the lesson to be learned: you better work, bitch.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The way that the show presents the financially dependent woman as pathetic takes on a different hue when you learn just how much Bravo has expected new cast members to fend for themselves financially. Relative to traditional actors, the Housewives on the whole make less money, have less employment security, and are more vulnerable to harassment and exploitation. In the earliest contracts for the show, one Housewife received just seven thousand dollars to shoot her first season. Although some Housewives who are main characters on their franchises, such as Kandi Burruss of “RHOA,” are said to earn upward of two million dollars per season, the contracts vary widely. Bravo gets a percentage of all the deals that these women make. On an episode of Meghan Markle&#39;s podcast, “Archetypes,” Andy Cohen told the Duchess, a “Housewives” fan, that his tagline is: “I&#39;m a father of two, but a daddy to many.” But a sugar daddy he is not. Fans tend not to be sympathetic, feeling the pay is justified by the women&#39;s opportunity to monetize their appearance on the show. But the “Housewives” universe is littered with failed business ventures, tax liens, and bankruptcies. Not everyone can be Bethenny. I could barely keep up with her yoga video.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In this respect, the Housewives are not unusual. The lowercase housewife, as a cultural icon, has always been a mirage, an excuse to pay women less and deny them job protection. Mid-century executives at temp agencies took advantage of the housewife mythos to perpetuate the narrative that the women they hired just needed “pin money” and that this work was distinct from the real labor market. In 1958, the executive vice-president of the temp agency Kelly Girl described the “typical Kelly Girl” as someone who “doesn&#39;t want full-time work, but she&#39;s bored with strictly keeping house.” The feminine mystique has always been a mystification, and a useful one at that.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Feminist critiques of the show have tended to focus their ire on its trafficking in “drama,” code for screaming matches. For what it is worth, I defend the show on precisely these grounds. In my view, it has elevated the catfight to a literary form, showcasing a distinctly female unleashing of rage that relies on words rather than fists. If I had to pick my own table-flipping, weave-pulling, white-women-throwing-white-wine-at-one-another-style fight with the franchise, it would be in how perfectly it served up women like a cheese plate to the maw of the post-recession market, selling a fairy tale of entrepreneurial self-empowerment to viewers.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Fifteen years after I graduated into an unstable job market, the fantasy of the housewife as capitalist evangelist is becoming threadbare. The rebooted version of “The Real Housewives of New York City,” with its unrelenting celebration of branding and influencing, is punishing to watch. The new cast comprises powerful working moms—Lyons, de Silva, the fashion publicist Jessel Taank, the real-estate agent and interior designer Erin Lichy—or successful single women looking for someone to share their lives, but not necessarily bank accounts, with. Their husbands and romantic partners are sidelined. Wifedom is incidental to their identities. We see the women collaborating with brands as much if not more than with their partners. Even the women on the reboot seem frustrated by the omnipresence of branded content in their midst. The show has its moments, but it looks like a commercial for products I&#39;ve grown too tired to put in the extra hours to pay for.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The reboot can sometimes resemble “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tag/the-bachelorette&quot;>;The Bachelorette&lt;/a>;,” with the lesser-known Housewives competing for the affection of Lyons, whose life is presented as a fairy tale of girlboss feminism (when the girls&#39; partying in the Hamptons gets too loud, she flees to her own abode nearby). Sai, a fashion influencer, finds it overwhelming, complaining that all the “gifts” that Jenna offers them on camera seem to be from her friends&#39; product lines. When Jenna “gifts” Jessel, my favorite of the new Housewives, a green silk nightgown from a friend&#39;s lingerie company to wear on the show, Jessel cannot hide her distaste: “I look like a Christmas tree!” she shouts. The problem with the show was summed up by Bethenny herself on her podcast “ReWives,” in which she shares with special guests her thoughts on the “Housewives” and reality-TV extended universe. After the première of the reboot, Bethenny reunited with Jill to dish on the new season. “When we all started,” she tells Zarin, “we didn&#39;t have businesses. It felt like they cast this show based on what &#39;Real Housewives of New York&#39; became.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Meanwhile, inspired by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/notes-on-hollywood/scenes-from-hollywoods-hot-labor-summer&quot;>;&lt;em >;SAG-AFTRA&lt;/em>; strike&lt;/a>;, Bethenny has become an aspiring labor leader, outlining her first ten proposals on Instagram. She &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/Cu-BiXZJO_w/&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/Cu-BiXZJO_w/&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/Cu-BiXZJO_w/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;said&lt;/a>; that the terms were “subject to modification. I did not buy the Idiot&#39;s Guide to starting a union in 24-hours.” Five days after &lt;em >;SAG-AFTRA&lt;/em>; announced that they would be joining the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/notes-on-hollywood/why-are-tv-writers-so-miserable&quot;>;WGA&#39;s labor stoppage&lt;/a>;, Bethenny took to the social-media Web site, and, true to her reputation for mentioning it all, she did not hold back: “Reality stars are the stepchildren, the losers, the mules, the pack horses, the ones that the entertainment industry is going to rely on right now to carry the water and do the heavy lifting when &lt;em>;real&lt;/em>; stars, when &lt;em>;real&lt;/em>; A-List Hollywood is on strike,” she told her 3.3 million followers, referring to the industry&#39;s historic use of reality TV to fill airwaves while screenwriters are on strike. One of the main grievances behind the &lt;em >;SAG-AFTRA&lt;/em>; and WGA strikes are TV residuals, which have diminished severely in the streaming era. Reality stars like her also do not receive residuals, she explained, suggesting that they, too, go on strike.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;31my4i&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Other Housewives chimed in. “Totally agree! We should be getting residuals for all the times they have used our footage. I got paid $0 season 1,” Vicky wrote. Reality stars from other shows offered their support as well. Caroline d&#39;Amore, of MTV&#39;s “The Hills,” posted, “Everyone thinks everyone is getting rich when the only ones doing so are the studios.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;To the argument that the current system was fair because the show offered the women a platform to make money by other means, Bethenny was ready with an answer. “I got the same opportunities that hundreds of other people had to monetize it,” she said, referring to Housewives since, “who tried and failed.” It might sound like bragging, but I heard a tinge of guilt from Bethenny. She had paved a path that the rest of us were supposed to follow and could not. No one, she was saying, should have to juggle all the careers that she did, especially when they already had a job: Real Housewife. Bethenny is still recruiting more Housewives to her union, urging them to use the hashtag #imwithbethenny. “Maybe I&#39;m the one who needs to GET A HOBBY,” she wrote, “and maybe this will be it.” ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 22 Sep 2023 19:06:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Questions from Florida’s Newly Adopted Classic Learning Test]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.newyorker.com/humor/daily-shouts/questions-from-floridas-newly-adopted-classic-learning-test]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-22T10:00:00.000Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650b417e3931a56caf594a73/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/shouts_Stein_Questions%20from%20Florida%E2%80%99s%20Newly%20Adopted%20Classic%20Learning%20Test.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;article >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attribute-verso-pattern=&quot;article-body&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;ArticlePageChunks&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;blockquote >;&lt;div >;&lt;p>;Students applying to Florida&#39;s state universities will now be able to submit exam scores from a conservative and Christian-backed alternative to the SAT and ACT, known as the Classic Learning Test. —NPR&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/blockquote>;&lt;div role=&quot;heading&quot; aria-level=&quot;4&quot; >;Quantitative Reasoning&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Jim makes $50,000 a year.

of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/notes-on-hollywood/scenes-from-hollywoods-hot-labor-summer&quot;>;the ongoing labor disputes&lt;/a>; roiling Hollywood—and preventing many A-listers from promoting their movies—festival curators are getting creative. After a largely celebrity-free Venice, Cameron Bailey, the head of the Toronto International Film Festival, touted a lineup full of actor-directors and the calls he&#39;d made to insure their participation. But most of their projects were middling at best. &lt;strong>;“Poolman,”&lt;/strong>; Chris Pine&#39;s first feature, is a pale simulacrum of a noir comedy; on the day I attended, its clunky dialogue and incoherent plotting prompted multiple walkouts. Anna Kendrick&#39;s &lt;strong>;“Woman of the Hour,”&lt;/strong>; an attempt at true crime with a feminist twist, also falters in its execution. Refracting the story of a serial killer through those of his victims (and near-victims) is a clever device on paper, but in practice the film&#39;s tack of jumping from woman to woman gives almost all of them short shrift. Nor did the festival get the extra glamour it was hoping for: Pine and Kendrick both stayed home.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;GenericCallout&quot;>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;Adria Arjona and Glen Powell in Hit Man&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6509f96f86193e693afada5d/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Adria%2520Arjona%2520and%2520Glen%2520Powell%2520in%2520HIT%2520MAN_Courtesy%2520of%2520All%2520the%2520Hits%2C%2520LLC._2_.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6509f96f86193e693afada5d/master/w_120,c_limit/Adria%20Arjona%20and%20Glen%20Powell%20in%20HIT%20MAN_Courtesy%20of%20All%20the%20Hits,%20LLC._2_.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6509f96f86193e693afada5d/master/w_240,c_limit/Adria%20Arjona%20and%20Glen%20Powell%20in%20HIT%20MAN_Courtesy%20of%20All%20the%20Hits,%20LLC._2_.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6509f96f86193e693afada5d/master/w_320,c_limit/Adria%20Arjona%20and%20Glen%20Powell%20in%20HIT%20MAN_Courtesy%20of%20All%20the%20Hits,%20LLC._2_.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6509f96f86193e693afada5d/master/w_640,c_limit/Adria%20Arjona%20and%20Glen%20Powell%20in%20HIT%20MAN_Courtesy%20of%20All%20the%20Hits,%20LLC._2_.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6509f96f86193e693afada5d/master/w_960,c_limit/Adria%20Arjona%20and%20Glen%20Powell%20in%20HIT%20MAN_Courtesy%20of%20All%20the%20Hits,%20LLC._2_.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6509f96f86193e693afada5d/master/w_1280,c_limit/Adria%20Arjona%20and%20Glen%20Powell%20in%20HIT%20MAN_Courtesy%20of%20All%20the%20Hits,%20LLC._2_.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6509f96f86193e693afada5d/master/w_1600,c_limit/Adria%20Arjona%20and%20Glen%20Powell%20in%20HIT%20MAN_Courtesy%20of%20All%20the%20Hits,%20LLC._2_.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;Photograph courtesy All the Hits&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;If these experiments were unsuccessful, another multi-hyphenate was behind one of &lt;em >;TIFF&lt;/em>;&#39;s great crowd-pleasers. &lt;strong>;“Hit Man,”&lt;/strong>; a new movie from Richard Linklater, was co-written by its leading man, Glen Powell, and proved to be the perfect showcase for his charisma. Playing a philosophy professor turned fake assassin, Powell changes his costume, accent, and mien with joyful abandon, pulling the audience along as the stakes and absurdities continue to mount. (Partway through my screening, one bravura sequence elicited actual cheers.) The film, which will have its New York première next month, was acquired by Netflix for twenty million dollars—the biggest deal of the festival. Powell wasn&#39;t present in Toronto, either, but he didn&#39;t have to be: a red carpet isn&#39;t required to herald the arrival of a bona-fide star.&lt;/p>;&lt;hr />;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;align-center&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:align-center&quot;>;&lt;h2 >;Spotlight&lt;/h2>;&lt;/inline-embed>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;GenericCallout&quot;>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;The New York Film Festival Kicks Off&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650b1c589e2e343dc0a4639b/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/231002_r43087.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650b1c589e2e343dc0a4639b/master/w_120,c_limit/231002_r43087.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650b1c589e2e343dc0a4639b/master/w_240,c_limit/231002_r43087.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650b1c589e2e343dc0a4639b/master/w_320,c_limit/231002_r43087.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650b1c589e2e343dc0a4639b/master/w_640,c_limit/231002_r43087.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650b1c589e2e343dc0a4639b/master/w_960,c_limit/231002_r43087.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650b1c589e2e343dc0a4639b/master/w_1280,c_limit/231002_r43087.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650b1c589e2e343dc0a4639b/master/w_1600,c_limit/231002_r43087.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;Photograph courtesy A24&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;heading&quot; aria-level=&quot;6&quot; >;Movies&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;This year&#39;s edition of the &lt;strong>;New York Film Festival&lt;/strong>; offers a wide variety of international features, including Catherine Breillat&#39;s “Last Summer” and two new works by the prolific South Korean director Hong Sangsoo, as well as major films by such acclaimed Hollywood figures as Sofia Coppola (“Priscilla”) and Michael Mann (“Ferrari”), and even a hybrid—the Greek director Yorgos Lanthimos&#39;s “Poor Things,” starring Emma Stone. There are also a few American independent films; one of them, “All Dirt Roads Taste of Salt” (pictured), the first feature by Raven Jackson, is among the most impressive recent directorial débuts. It&#39;s a historical drama with the power of legend, centered on the tragic small-town romance of a young couple in nineteen-seventies Mississippi.—&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/contributors/richard-brody&quot;>;&lt;em>;Richard Brody&lt;/em>;&lt;/a>; &lt;em>;(Lincoln Center; Sept. 29-Oct. 15.)&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>;&lt;hr />;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;GenericCallout&quot;>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;An illustration of the New York City skyline.&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64ad7fea3f0ea61101b7b5aa/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/header-2023.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64ad7fea3f0ea61101b7b5aa/master/w_120,c_limit/header-2023.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64ad7fea3f0ea61101b7b5aa/master/w_240,c_limit/header-2023.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64ad7fea3f0ea61101b7b5aa/master/w_320,c_limit/header-2023.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64ad7fea3f0ea61101b7b5aa/master/w_640,c_limit/header-2023.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64ad7fea3f0ea61101b7b5aa/master/w_960,c_limit/header-2023.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64ad7fea3f0ea61101b7b5aa/master/w_1280,c_limit/header-2023.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64ad7fea3f0ea61101b7b5aa/master/w_1600,c_limit/header-2023.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/div>;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;align-center&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:align-center&quot;>;&lt;h2 >;About Town&lt;/h2>;&lt;/inline-embed>;&lt;div role=&quot;heading&quot; aria-level=&quot;6&quot; >;Theatre&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;“Prometheus Firebringer”&lt;/strong>; is a battle royale over how to create (apparent) meaning: in one corner, the theatre-maker Annie Dorsen lectures on the tragic dimensions of the ChatGPT-pocalypse; in the other, empty masks drone an AI-generated script for a lost Aeschylus play. Dorsen&#39;s human-fashioned speech consists of quotes by others (she provides attributions on a screen), whereas the AI language model composes doggerel via predictive text. Which do we prefer? Dorsen weights her gloves: the computer voices speak in a mind-numbing singsong; she is warm and thrilling. But her victory still counts. With phrases borrowed from the philosopher Bernard Stiegler, old Twitter posts, and even a guide for theatre students (“There is such a thing as a &#39;bad choice&#39; ”), she predicts the rise of the soulless art product—and handily demonstrates its defeat.—&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/contributors/helen-shaw&quot;>;&lt;em>;Helen Shaw&lt;/em>;&lt;/a>; &lt;em>;(Polonsky Shakespeare Center; through Oct. 1.)&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>;&lt;hr />;&lt;div role=&quot;heading&quot; aria-level=&quot;6&quot; >;Dance&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;In the twenty years of City Center&#39;s &lt;strong>;Fall for Dance Festival,&lt;/strong>; the ticket price has inched up alongside inflation. But twenty-dollar seats still qualify the event as a populist endeavor. The idea, from the start, was to lower the bar to entry and organize sampler programs, with a scattering of stars and premières, on the variety-show principle of “You may not love this, but how about that?” This year&#39;s five programs are typical both in the mix of genres (contemporary, hula, hip-hop) and in the jumbling of the reliable, the worrisome, and the wild-card. Among the dependable are the moonlighting ballet star Sara Mearns, the Odissi expert Bijayini Satpathy, and the tap dancers Caleb Teicher and Michelle Dorrance.—&lt;em>;Brian Seibert (New York City Center; Sept. 27-Oct. 8.)&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>;&lt;hr />;&lt;div role=&quot;heading&quot; aria-level=&quot;6&quot; >;Art&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;GenericCallout&quot;>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;Sunset Storm in Gransee photographed by Wolfgang Tillmans in 2022&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6509e7210193b76100b680f2/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/TILWO2324_resized.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6509e7210193b76100b680f2/master/w_120,c_limit/TILWO2324_resized.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6509e7210193b76100b680f2/master/w_240,c_limit/TILWO2324_resized.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6509e7210193b76100b680f2/master/w_320,c_limit/TILWO2324_resized.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6509e7210193b76100b680f2/master/w_640,c_limit/TILWO2324_resized.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6509e7210193b76100b680f2/master/w_960,c_limit/TILWO2324_resized.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6509e7210193b76100b680f2/master/w_1280,c_limit/TILWO2324_resized.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6509e7210193b76100b680f2/master/w_1600,c_limit/TILWO2324_resized.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;Tillmans&#39;s “Sunset Storm, Gransee” (2022)&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Photograph by Wolfgang Tillmans / Courtesy the artist / David Zwirner / Galerie Buchholz / Maureen Paley&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;The nineteen-nineties are over in “Fold Me,” a hypnotically glum exhibition of the photographer &lt;strong>;Wolfgang Tillmans&#39;s&lt;/strong>; recent portraits, cityscapes, and still-lifes. The seedy glamour of his early work, which brought him fame in the years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, is gone. Seediness alone dominates. Locations from Shenzhen to South Dakota are suffused with the same grayish haze, and even a video projection of Sirius, the brightest star in the night sky (Tillmans has a thing for astronomy), looks a tad faded. But every so often a proud face or a glowing building reminds you that this isn&#39;t such a bad time to be alive—and that, someday, people may miss the seediness of the twenty-twenties.—&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/contributors/jackson-arn&quot;>;&lt;em>;Jackson Arn&lt;/em>;&lt;/a>; &lt;em>;(Zwirner gallery; through Oct. 14.)&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>;&lt;hr />;&lt;div role=&quot;heading&quot; aria-level=&quot;6&quot; >;Classical Music&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;When the violinist &lt;strong>;Joshua Bell&lt;/strong>; came up with the idea for the new orchestral suite &lt;strong>;“The Elements,”&lt;/strong>; which he performs with the &lt;strong>;New York Philharmonic,&lt;/strong>; he found inspiration in a piece so obvious that it often escapes attention: Vivaldi&#39;s “The Four Seasons.” Bell has commissioned five composers to depict earth (Kevin Puts), water (Edgar Meyer), fire (Jake Heggie), air (Jennifer Higdon), and, in a bit of twenty-first-century revisionism, space (Jessie Montgomery). Surfacing themes of destruction and rebirth, the composers delve into our uneasy relationship with the natural world.—&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/contributors/oussama-zahr&quot;>;&lt;em>;Oussama Zahr&lt;/em>;&lt;/a>; &lt;em>;(David Geffen Hall; Sept. 29-Oct. 1.)&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>;&lt;hr />;&lt;div role=&quot;heading&quot; aria-level=&quot;6&quot; >;Folk Pop&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;yx13mo&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;Portrait of Joy Oladokun&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6508b1ca9e60c9605b88479e/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/joy_oladokun2_resized.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6508b1ca9e60c9605b88479e/master/w_120,c_limit/joy_oladokun2_resized.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6508b1ca9e60c9605b88479e/master/w_240,c_limit/joy_oladokun2_resized.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6508b1ca9e60c9605b88479e/master/w_320,c_limit/joy_oladokun2_resized.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6508b1ca9e60c9605b88479e/master/w_640,c_limit/joy_oladokun2_resized.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6508b1ca9e60c9605b88479e/master/w_960,c_limit/joy_oladokun2_resized.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6508b1ca9e60c9605b88479e/master/w_1280,c_limit/joy_oladokun2_resized.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6508b1ca9e60c9605b88479e/master/w_1600,c_limit/joy_oladokun2_resized.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;Photograph by Brian Higbee&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;p >;In April, the folk-pop singer-songwriter &lt;strong>;Joy Oladokun&lt;/strong>; expanded her scope with “Proof of Life,” a fortifying album about staying the course which straddles country, indie rock, and rap. Since 2016, she has been making subdued music about personal reckoning. Her previous record, “In Defense of My Own Happiness,” gathered heartrending dispatches from her Arizona upbringing as a queer Black child of immigrants who flees the church to nurture her creative identity. “Proof of Life” has a similar intimacy, but its music is more robust and Oladokun&#39;s voice is more resonant. The album seeks solidarity with others who have been marginalized in subtle songs about class struggle and revolution.

As the other two original members come onstage, followed by a quintet of recent recruits (including the P-Funk co-founder Bernie Worrell), Talking Heads becomes a jam band centered on Byrne&#39;s inspired and antic mannerisms, and Demme finds ever more incisive camera angles to display the musicians&#39; exuberant connections.—&lt;em>;Richard Brody (In limited release.)&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>;&lt;hr />;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;GenericCallout&quot;>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;The New York Film Festival Kicks Off&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64b58b3399c75b29bf38350d/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/GOAT-PickThree-web.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64b58b3399c75b29bf38350d/master/w_120,c_limit/GOAT-PickThree-web.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64b58b3399c75b29bf38350d/master/w_240,c_limit/GOAT-PickThree-web.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64b58b3399c75b29bf38350d/master/w_320,c_limit/GOAT-PickThree-web.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64b58b3399c75b29bf38350d/master/w_640,c_limit/GOAT-PickThree-web.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64b58b3399c75b29bf38350d/master/w_960,c_limit/GOAT-PickThree-web.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64b58b3399c75b29bf38350d/master/w_1280,c_limit/GOAT-PickThree-web.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64b58b3399c75b29bf38350d/master/w_1600,c_limit/GOAT-PickThree-web.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/div>;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;align-center&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:align-center&quot;>;&lt;h2 >;Pick Three&lt;/h2>;&lt;/inline-embed>;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;align-center&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:align-center&quot;>;&lt;p >;&lt;em>;The staff writer &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/contributors/alex-ross&quot;>;Alex Ross&lt;/a>; shares his current obsessions.&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>;&lt;/inline-embed>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;1.&lt;/strong>; Recently, in London, I called on the ninety-eight-year-old cellist, author, and Holocaust survivor &lt;strong>;Anita Lasker-Wallfisch,&lt;/strong>; one of the most remarkable people alive.

Primal to our mechanisms of speech and sustenance, they also embody a certain vulnerability, anxiety; memento mori, the nearest thing to our own skulls most of us ever see. Carl Jung claimed that, symbolically, losing teeth indicates a loss of “grip,” or control, “a fear of death or a somewhat dangerous communication with the unconscious.” This analysis, approaching but never naming the diagnosis of “hysteria,” connects dental disquiet with maternity and aging—threats, supposedly, to “psychic continuity.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;It makes a kind of sense, then, that the idea for the unnerving short film “AIRHOSTESS-737” came to its creator, Thanasis Neofotistos, in a dream. The film&#39;s protagonist, Vanina, struggles to perform her job as a flight attendant while enduring the pain and perceived humiliation of adult braces. Her discomfort is all the more palpable for her efforts to conceal it beneath red lipstick, a bright expression, coiffed hair, and a pressed uniform; she&#39;s the picture of professionally hospitable femininity, except that something is—off. Cheery music plays while she performs her work, the camera tightly fixed on her face, other characters mere shadows, interlopers, hovering at or just outside the edges of the frame. She demonstrates safety protocols, distributes snacks to passengers, and chats with a colleague, eventually revealing that her braces aren&#39;t the only problem; she and the plane are both carrying some extra cargo (emotional, in her case) that cannot be easily stowed away. As Vanina&#39;s agitation heightens, so does the air turbulence, finally forcing her to confront her trauma surrounding the death of her mother, who abandoned Vanina as a child.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Neofotistos considers “AIRHOSTESS-737” the last installment of a trilogy that also includes his shorts “Patision Avenue,” in which a woman&#39;s parental responsibilities and career aspirations clash, and “Route-3,” about a shy teen-ager afraid to act on his attraction to a fellow tram rider. All three films focus closely, almost claustrophobically, on single characters who are in transit and somewhat at the mercy of their environments; their internal conflicts culminate in moments of sensory overload, setting merging with subconscious to hallucinatory effect. Neofotistos told me that he sees each of these films as following a monomythic narrative structure—an adventure into the unknown, a victory or revelation, and a return bearing newly gained insight or power—and that, together, they represent his own artistic coming of age, his own personal hero&#39;s journey. He identifies especially with Vanina—her craving for maternal love, her experience of repression. For Neofotistos, who is gay and grew up navigating conservative societal expectations in his native Greece, making “AIRHOSTESS-737” felt like a necessary act of acceptance and reconciliation, with his mom and with himself—the end of one chapter and the beginning of another.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;That hard-won peace shines through the film&#39;s closing scene: its phantasmagoric climax, which reads as both a brush with death and a rebirth, leaves Vanina dishevelled, appearing finally at ease. She looks directly into the camera and, for the first time, really smiles.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 22 Sep 2023 19:06:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[House Republicans Refuse to Host Zelensky Because They’re Too Busy Fighting One Another]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.newyorker.com/news/letter-from-bidens-washington/house-republicans-refuse-to-host-zelensky-because-theyre-too-busy-fighting-one-another]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-22T00:03:06.574Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650cad0ca6ca2173f433e2ef/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Glasser-Zelensky-Senate.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;article >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attribute-verso-pattern=&quot;article-body&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;ArticlePageChunks&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;In an age when absolutely anything can be politicized, perhaps it was inevitable that the attire of John Fetterman would become a cause célèbre in the Republicans&#39; culture wars. The hulking Democratic senator from Pennsylvania, who suffered a campaign-season stroke during his 2022 race, has since then preferred to wear an unorthodox uniform of baggy gym shorts and hoodies, even in the august halls of the US Senate. After it was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.axios.com/2023/09/17/senate-drops-dress-code-schumer&quot;>;revealed this past weekend&lt;/a>; that Senate Majority Leader &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tag/chuck-schumer&quot;>;Chuck Schumer&lt;/a>; had quietly decided he would no longer enforce the chamber&#39;s long-standing but unofficial dress code, thus permitting Fetterman to vote on the floor and even preside over the Senate in his informal getup, numerous hyperventilating op-eds, tweets, and Fox News segments followed. (A sampling: “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/fetterman-dress-code-fail-begs-question-americas-steep-decline&quot;>;Fetterman dress code fail begs big question about America&#39;s deep decline&lt;/a>;”; “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nationalreview.com/the-morning-jolt/does-john-fetterman-really-want-to-be-a-senator&quot;>;Does John Fetterman really want to be a senator?&lt;/a>;”) Senator Susan Collins, of Maine, &lt;a href=&quot;https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/4212436-collins-pans-new-senate-dress-code-i-plan-to-wear-a-bikini-tomorrow/&quot;>;threatened&lt;/a>; to wear a bikini on the Senate floor in protest.

When Ron DeSantis, the Florida governor whose Republican Presidential campaign has been foundering in the polls, attacked Fetterman for “dumbing down” the country, the Pennsylvania senator &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://twitter.com/johnfetterman/status/1703853480761323677&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://twitter.com/johnfetterman/status/1703853480761323677&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/johnfetterman/status/1703853480761323677&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;clapped back&lt;/a>;: “I dress like he campaigns.” By Wednesday, Fetterman clearly was having too much fun to let the story die. In a tweet seemingly designed for maximum viral impact, Fetterman &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://twitter.com/senfettermanpa/status/1704517579795022038&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://twitter.com/senfettermanpa/status/1704517579795022038&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/senfettermanpa/status/1704517579795022038&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;made an offer&lt;/a>;: “If those jagoffs in the House stop trying to shut our government down, and fully support Ukraine,” he vowed, “then I will save democracy by wearing a suit on the Senate floor next week.” (A jagoff, according to Dictionary.com, is Pittsburgh slang, used to refer to “a jerk, idiot, or really any kind of irritating or unlikeable person.”)&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Putting aside what might be the first known use of the word in an official statement by a US senator, it seems safe to say that Fetterman probably won&#39;t have to put that suit on. But he sure had a point: it&#39;s silly season once again in Washington, as various nihilistic Republicans in the House of Representatives—Fetterman&#39;s jagoffs—careen the country toward a government shutdown when funding runs out at the end of September. Stopping US military aid to Ukraine is one of their central demands, and a twenty-four-billion-dollar supplemental-appropriation request from the Biden Administration to keep the weapons and assistance flowing has now become entangled in the government-shutdown fight.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The feckless House Speaker, Kevin McCarthy, has been trying to thwart them but with such notable ineffectiveness that by midweek the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2023/09/20/republicans-villains-government-shutdown-00117191&quot;>;inevitability of a shutdown&lt;/a>; had become conventional wisdom in Washington, the presumed political costs to Republicans notwithstanding. “We always get the blame,” Representative Mike Simpson of Idaho complained. But there&#39;s no surprise why: it&#39;s Republicans, not Democrats, who have tended to push for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/longest-government-shutdown/&quot;>;government shutdowns&lt;/a>; ever since Newt Gingrich embraced the tactic in 1995 as a blunt-force instrument to get their way in Washington&#39;s regular spending fights. When, late on Wednesday, McCarthy emerged from a House Republican Conference meeting optimistic about a prospective new plan to win over his hardest-right opponents, a new problem soon emerged: Donald Trump.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Within hours, the ex-President—on whose watch, in 2018 and early 2019, the longest government shutdown in history occurred, ending with Trump having achieved none of the goals he sought—publicly demanded that Republicans flout McCarthy and press ahead. “Republicans in Congress can and must defund all aspects of Crooked Joe Biden&#39;s weaponized Government,” &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-urges-government-shutdown-unlikely-bid-defund-his-criminal-prosecutions-2023-09-21/&quot;>;he said&lt;/a>;. Trump, who is facing two criminal cases brought by the Justice Department special counsel Jack Smith, framed the fight, as he does most things, in explicitly personal terms: “This is also the last chance to defund these political prosecutions against me and other Patriots.” To him, the House Republicans seeking to bring the operations of the US government to a halt are nothing more than an extension of his 2024 campaign to return to office and exact revenge on those who sought to hold him to account—his political Praetorian Guard.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;On Thursday, with McCarthy&#39;s would-be breakthrough stymied by his party&#39;s actual leader, his rebel caucus rebelled yet again, joining with Democrats to vote down for the second time a rule to govern floor consideration of the annual defense-appropriations bill. “This is a whole new concept of individuals that just want to burn the whole place down,” &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://twitter.com/accountablegop/status/1704891328243339683&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://twitter.com/accountablegop/status/1704891328243339683&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/accountablegop/status/1704891328243339683&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;the Speaker told reporters&lt;/a>; afterward. But, shortly after that, reporters for Punchbowl News &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://twitter.com/jakesherman/status/1704893927638131074&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://twitter.com/jakesherman/status/1704893927638131074&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jakesherman/status/1704893927638131074&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;revealed&lt;/a>; that McCarthy was considering caving in once more, this time by considering removing any Ukraine-related funding from the defense measure.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Politics is all about contrast. And one of the sharpest contrasts going in Washington has been exposed by the brewing opposition among House Republicans to Ukraine funding. It&#39;s a cause that many of Trump&#39;s loudest adherents on Capitol Hill have taken up with increasing fervor as polls have shown that the initial, strongly bipartisan support for assistance is ebbing and a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/politics/national-security/zelensky-ukraines-war-messenger-confronts-a-more-wary-washington-85134d73&quot;>;majority of the GOP electorate&lt;/a>; is now opposed to continuing to fund the war effort.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;President Biden has made backing Ukraine the signature foreign policy of his tenure, securing congressional approval for more than forty-five billion dollars in military aid and rallying &lt;em >;NATO&lt;/em>; allies against Vladimir Putin&#39;s war of aggression on its neighbor. On Tuesday, in his annual speech to the UN General Assembly, Biden framed support for Kyiv as a basic test of the international order: “If we allow Ukraine to be carved up,” &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2023/09/19/remarks-by-president-biden-before-the-78th-session-of-the-united-nations-general-assembly-new-york-ny/&quot;>;he said&lt;/a>;, “is the independence of any nation secure?” On Thursday, he hosted Ukraine&#39;s President, Volodymyr Zelensky, at the White House. “先生。 President, we&#39;re with you, and we&#39;re staying with you,” Biden promised.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Biden&#39;s steadfast defense of Zelensky, commitment to allies, and opposition to Putin are among his strongest claims to international leadership, not to mention the strongest possible contrast with Trump. Have we forgotten so soon Trump&#39;s excruciating &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vox.com/2019/9/25/20883928/trump-ukraine-zelensky-transcript-united-nations&quot;>;meeting with Zelensky&lt;/a>; in 2019, when the young Ukrainian leader squirmed like a hostage as he sat alongside Trump and awkwardly claimed that “nobody pushed” him to investigate Biden, hours after Trump released the transcript of his infamous phone call with Zelensky showing that he had done just that? When he was President, Trump rarely missed a chance to excoriate the nation&#39;s allies and praise its adversaries and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/26/politics/trump-putin-ukraine/index.html&quot;>;parroted&lt;/a>; Russian talking points on Ukraine. After the 2022 invasion, he even went so far as to laud Putin&#39;s strategic “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2022/02/23/trump-putin-ukraine-invasion-00010923&quot;>;genius&lt;/a>;.” Just a few days ago, Trump &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2023/09/17/donald-trump-vladimir-putin-praise-00116414&quot;>;revelled once again in praise&lt;/a>; from Putin, who has all but endorsed the former President&#39;s campaign to return to the White House in 2024.&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Meanwhile, on Capitol Hill this week, McCarthy bowed down to his Trump-inspired anti-Ukraine fringe—&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/which-house-republicans-voted-gaetz-end-military-aid-ukraine-2023-7&quot;>;seventy House Republicans&lt;/a>;, or one-third of the GOP conference voted to cut off aid in a vote earlier this summer—and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/20/us/politics/mccarthy-zelensky-republicans.html&quot;>;refused to agree to Zelensky&#39;s request&lt;/a>; to address a joint session of Congress, or to convene a meeting between Zelensky and all House members. McCarthy claimed that the chamber was too busy with spending negotiations, which, given the embarrassing chaos that swirled all day in the House after the defense appropriation rule was defeated, seemed like a particularly lame excuse. Once again, the contrast could not have been starker.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Over on the Senate side of the Capitol, where the Republican leader Mitch McConnell is an outspoken supporter of Ukraine, he and Majority Leader Chuck Schumer hosted Zelensky for a special session in the old Senate chamber, where the Ukrainian President received &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://twitter.com/chrismurphyct/status/1704864332696171003&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://twitter.com/chrismurphyct/status/1704864332696171003&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/chrismurphyct/status/1704864332696171003&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;two standing ovations&lt;/a>;. According to Schumer, Zelensky summed up the stakes of the present Washington debate with admirable succinctness: “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://twitter.com/sbg1/status/1704906946699297221&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://twitter.com/sbg1/status/1704906946699297221&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/sbg1/status/1704906946699297221&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;If we don&#39;t get the aid&lt;/a>;,” he told the senators, “we will lose the war.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Most of the seasoned Hill watchers I&#39;ve spoken with in recent weeks still believe that support for Ukraine is there, at least for now. The bigger problem is the American political calendar: 2024 looms, and, with it, the prospect of Trump—or another Republican taking his pro-Putin line—returning to power. No wonder the boss in the Kremlin is paying such close attention. ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;2rhkxn&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;ylqezp&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 22 Sep 2023 09:06:01 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Sikh Separatism and the Brewing Conflict Between Canada and India]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.newyorker.com/news/q-and-a/sikh-separatism-and-the-brewing-conflict-between-canada-and-india]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-21T21:30:08.307Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650b4603ec835e01de957992/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Chotiner-Singh.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;article >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attribute-verso-pattern=&quot;article-body&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;ArticlePageChunks&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;On Monday, Justin Trudeau, the Prime Minister of Canada, accused India&#39;s government of having a role in the murder of Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a Canadian citizen and Sikh separatist who was gunned down in Surrey, British Columbia, in June. Sikhs make up less than two per cent of the population of India, but are a majority in the northwestern state of Punjab. During the past half century, the struggle for a Sikh homeland—usually referred to as the Khalistan movement—has occasionally turned violent, and has been met by an equally violent response from the Indian authorities. But an assassination on foreign soil would constitute a serious escalation of the campaign against Sikh separatists.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;India&#39;s Ministry of External Affairs has denied having anything to do with the murder, but also said that Canada&#39;s approach to terrorism, which it characterized as laissez-faire, would “continue to threaten India&#39;s sovereignty and territorial integrity.” Trudeau&#39;s allegations coincide with an attempt by Narendra Modi, India&#39;s Prime Minister, to portray the country as an increasingly important player on the global stage; this era, in his words, marks “the first time the world has come to know that India can take a stand for herself.” The allegations also coincide with a general willingness by the Biden Administration to overlook India&#39;s worsening human-rights record during Modi&#39;s nearly decade-long premiership, in part because the US values India&#39;s role as a counterweight to China.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;To talk about the history of Sikh separatism and the Indian government&#39;s response to it, I recently spoke by phone with Gurharpal Singh, an emeritus professor at the University of London&#39;s School of Oriental and African Studies and the author of many books on the subcontinent, including “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Sikh-Nationalism-Approaches-Asian-History-ebook/dp/B09NRNQ27D/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=Gurharpal+Singh&amp;amp;qid=1695153812&amp;amp;sr=8-1&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Sikh-Nationalism-Approaches-Asian-History-ebook/dp/B09NRNQ27D/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=Gurharpal+Singh&amp;amp;qid=1695153812&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Sikh-Nationalism-Approaches-Asian-History-ebook/dp/B09NRNQ27D/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=Gurharpal+Singh&amp;amp;qid=1695153812&amp;amp;sr=8-1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;Sikh Nationalism: From a Dominant Minority to an Ethno-Religious Diaspora&lt;/a>;.” During our conversation, which has been edited for length and clarity, we discussed why the Indian government is so concerned about Sikh separatism, the development of Sikh political identity in the West, and whether Western governments are doing enough to protect their own citizens.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;How did there come to be large Sikh communities in countries such as Canada?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Sikhs have been migrating overseas in significant numbers since the late nineteenth century. As part of the imperial expansion of Britain, they were principally involved in the armed services and later in the security forces as policemen. So, wherever the Empire expanded, especially in the Far East—China, Singapore, Fiji, and Malaysia—and East Africa, that&#39;s where the Sikhs went. They started arriving in North America, and particularly the Pacific Coast, following Queen Victoria&#39;s Golden Jubilee, in 1887. Citizens of the Empire technically had the right to travel and settle throughout it. And since then there have been significant settlements of the Sikh community in British Columbia, California, and, of course, Britain, where they have been permanently settled since the nineteen-twenties in large numbers, and more since the Second World War.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;At the same time that Sikhs are migrating to different areas of the world, there is a huge Sikh community in the Indian state of Punjab, which was one of the two states split in half during Partition. There is a movement there for some sort of independent Sikh homeland. Can you talk about how that movement got started and what its role was in Indian politics after Partition?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;At Partition, the Sikh community saw itself as being very vulnerable. It was a small community in the united British Punjab—less than about fourteen per cent of the population. Sikhs tried to come up with various schemes to keep the community together, to keep Punjab together, but unfortunately that did not come to pass, as the British wanted to exit India and Punjab quickly. Thereafter, Indian states or provinces were organized along linguistic lines. One way the Sikh leadership thought that it could protect the community&#39;s rights and identity was to campaign for a Punjabi-speaking state. This led to a great deal of bitterness and resentment among the Punjabi-speaking Hindu community, who opted for Hindi as a way of opposing that demand. They thought that a Punjabi-speaking state would largely be a Sikh-dominated state.&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;After about two decades of campaigning, that demand was conceded in 1966, but reluctantly. There was another campaign, between 1973 and 1984, for greater economic and political autonomy for Punjab. And that eventually culminated with the Indian Army entering the Golden Temple, in Operation Blue Star, in 1984. That was a traumatic period, which then was followed by a decade-long troubles.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;Can you talk more about that event, which was followed by the assassination of the Indian Prime Minister, Indira Gandhi, also in 1984, and more broadly about how the push for Sikh autonomy became in some cases more violent?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;There was a prolonged period of negotiation between Sikh moderate leaders and Indira Gandhi and the Congress Party in Delhi between 1980 and 1982. However, the two sides were unable to reach an agreement on the demands, and gradually the militant element within the Sikh leadership outmaneuvered the more moderate members, leading to polarization between the Indian government and the militants. That eventually climaxed in Operation Blue Star, an operation to remove Sikh militants from the Golden Temple, the most sacred site in Sikhism, which was followed by the assassination of Indira Gandhi in October, 1984, and the killing of almost three thousand Sikhs in Delhi in the backlash that followed. That led to almost a decade of Sikh militancy and counterinsurgency operations, conducted by the Indian Armed Forces, which cost, on conservative estimates, around thirty thousand lives. These events cast a long shadow on the Punjab problem, which has continued to haunt all governments in Delhi since then.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;When did the Indian government begin to get so concerned about Sikhs on foreign soil advocating for Sikh issues in India?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;It has been monitoring the activities of overseas Indians on a regular basis. The first time it specifically started noting the activities of Sikh militants was in the early seventies, when Jagjit Singh Chohan, a Sikh political leader who left India, and who&#39;s often referred to as a father of Khalistan, started a quixotic campaign for a Sikh state. More specifically, it was in the early eighties, 1980 to 1984, when the government of India and the Congress Party in particular was very, very focussed on monitoring the activities of Sikh militants.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;Before we started the interview, you mentioned that you were interested in comparing Sikhs to the Jewish community. What did you mean by that?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Well, you&#39;ll see that the comparison comes in the sense that Sikhs are small, they&#39;re religious, and they&#39;re roughly the same size as the Jewish community. [&lt;em>;Worldwide, there are about twenty-five million Sikhs and fifteen million Jews.&lt;/em>;] They&#39;re both a diaspora and a nation and an ethnicity and can be read as such. They are a complex minority, which are often seen in terms of religion only, but seeing them just as a kind of dedicated religious community overlooks the more complex dimensions of the community. They have fought for autonomy and the right to govern themselves, and as a minority to have their identity rights safeguarded in the West. For example, Sikhs and Jews in Britain were the only two communities in England who were recognized as ethnic groups in legal proceedings following the Race Relations Act of 1976.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;How important is the push for a Sikh homeland to Sikh identity in many of the Western Sikh communities you study?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;8b07po&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;zfjvxj&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;It ebbs and flows. The idea of a Sikh homeland has not had many takers for most of the post-1947 period, but what happened in 1984 led to a reaction against the government of India, which enabled militant groups to come to the fore. And when the militancy in Punjab died away, the hold of these groups on Sikh organizations also dissipated. So, since the early two-thousands, and for most of the last decades, homeland issues have not been very much at the forefront for most of the Sikh diaspora. In fact, they have been largely focussed on host-country issues, especially after 9/11 and the targeting of many Sikhs who were often, particularly in America, identified with militant Islam.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;What&#39;s happened qualitatively in the last few years is the large outflow from Punjab of young people because of an economic crisis in the state and also because of the impact of protests by Indian farmers. Between 2020 and 2021, the state of Punjab in particular was very much the focus of the farmers&#39; agitation against the government of Narendra Modi and the BJP, which wanted to deregulate the farming sector. And that agitation created a groundswell of mobilization in the diaspora, which rekindled some of the old networks of militancy and homeland politics. But over all, in my recent work, I have suggested that the separatists do not command much more than about twenty-five per cent of the loyalties of the diaspora Sikhs. And that&#39;s the maximum and the most optimistic estimate.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;There are many examples of a political struggle by a community that tends to share the same religious faith. And the people who were the most hard-core fighters in those struggles tended to preach a very strict doctrine or vision of that religion. To what degree are the more violent elements of the push for a Sikh homeland connected to a harsh or strict interpretation of Sikhism itself?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;That&#39;s an interesting question, because in the eighties it was associated with the equivalent of religious fundamentalism that was pervasive throughout many of the faith traditions, especially after 1979. But in recent years, that relationship has, to some extent, broken down, because some of the hard-core faith groups have become, in some ways, apolitical. They&#39;ve become much more spiritually oriented. They are still there in the background, but not in any great strength.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;Do you think the Indian government has any legitimate case that there is Sikh militancy in Canada and that there are connections between that militancy and things going on in India? The Indian government claims that they sent Canada an extradition request for Nijjar, and have done so for others, and that those were ignored. Is the Indian government right to be frustrated by this?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I think the problem here arises from the fact that the arguments that are made for extradition by the government of India have to meet a certain threshold—judicial and legal—in the West. And these levels are often not met. This not only applies, for example, in the case of Sikhs and militancy but also in the efforts to extradite many leading businessmen and billionaires who have absconded with significant loans and funding in the last ten years and have not returned to India, partly because of judicial issues. So while countries have intergovernmental arrangements to extradite fugitives, in the case of demands for citizens of Canada who may or may not be involved in militancy in India, the onus of proof is on the Indian state.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;But no doubt in some cases the extradition requests are valid, and if it is the people they are requesting need to face executive and judicial actions. But there is also widespread fear, particularly since the period of counterinsurgency, of the Indian authorities using indiscriminate force to eliminate Sikh youth and also using the judicial and state processes arbitrarily. This is particularly the case with the Modi government when it comes to its domestic critics.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;Is there concern among Indian-origin communities in the West about surveillance being done in Western countries by the Indian government?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Certainly. Just to go back to the early eighties, when there was widespread concern that communities and groups were being monitored and people would face retribution, potentially, if they returned to India for family matters. And certainly now there is widespread fear and concern in Sikh communities, in Canada in particular, but also in certain areas in the UK, that they are being monitored.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I think this episode will bring into public domain the extent to which some Western governments are seeking to court the government of India, and how those actions are compromising citizen security. The desire to court India for defense and trade reasons comes at the expense of some elements of basic security for citizens who happen to be Sikhs.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;Certain Indian media sources have blamed Nijjar for the murder of a man in India that took place in 2021. What do we know about that case?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The life and times of militants are not without past histories of radicalism and engagement in violence. And it may well be that he was a party to it, but it may well also be that the case against him is fabricated. So I cannot comment with any confidence on that.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;Is your sense that Modi&#39;s government is more concerned about movements that threaten India&#39;s political future, such as the farmers&#39; protests, than it is about separatism?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;sl2irr&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;My own feeling is that the events that happened in Punjab this year are more connected to something else. In March, there was a wholesale mobilization in the state when Amritpal Singh, a separatist preacher, was on the run. He was eventually arrested, as were his followers, and there was a lockdown for almost two weeks. That was followed by a mobilization of groups in the diaspora. There were violent demonstrations outside the consulate in San Francisco, the High Commissions in Canada, and in the UK, which were then relayed back to the media in India. After that, I think they decided to take a tough line against separatists. We may now be seeing the outcome of those decisions.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;If the allegation that India was involved in the assassination in Canada is true, how much of a break would that seem to you from previous Indian policy regarding issues of Sikh separatism? As you said, thousands of people were killed in the eighties. So, in one sense, this seems like we&#39;re going back to an earlier time. But anything that occurs on foreign soil goes beyond that.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;I don&#39;t think it&#39;s much of a break. These things have happened before: the downing of the Air India flight off the coast of Ireland, in 1985, for example. There was a huge row between India and Canada that cast a shadow for nearly a decade and a half.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;This is when Canadian Sikh separatists were suspected of blowing up a passenger airplane, killing more than three hundred people?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Yeah. Compared to those events, what&#39;s happened recently is not as important or significant. But it comes at a time when the government in India is trying to project India as a global player and offering trade deals and negotiations on arms projects and so forth. So this could become a significant challenge if it turns into an issue of human rights and interference in the domestic affairs of other states. ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;4eifgo&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 22 Sep 2023 06:06:01 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Rishi Sunak’s Self-Serving Climate Retreat]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.newyorker.com/news/letter-from-the-uk/rishi-sunaks-self-serving-climate-retreat]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-21T18:44:38.853Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650c6111d266277376e66283/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Knight-Sunak-09-21-23.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;article >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attribute-verso-pattern=&quot;article-body&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;ArticlePageChunks&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Since &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/q-and-a/can-rishi-sunak-save-the-tories-from-total-collapse&quot;>;Rishi Sunak&lt;/a>; became Britain&#39;s Prime Minister, almost a year ago, in the middle of a national financial breakdown, his premiership has been defined by trying to make things go away. He wants inflation to halve. He wants the gigantic waiting lists for treatment on the National Health Service to shrink. He wants refugees to stop risking their lives by crossing the English Channel in unsafe inflatable boats. He wants to make &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tag/climate-change&quot;>;the climate crisis&lt;/a>; somebody else&#39;s problem. On Tuesday evening, the BBC reported that Sunak was preparing to either renounce, or soft-pedal, some of the country&#39;s most important policies to reduce its carbon emissions: a ban on the sale of new gas- and diesel-driven cars would slide to 2035, from 2030, while other plans to phase out gas-and-oil-fired boilers would be relaxed. In an unusual, late-night response to the leaked information, Sunak insisted that Britain was still committed to reaching “Net Zero by 2050 . 。 。 but doing so in a better, more proportionate way.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;If Sunak&#39;s track record on climate is anything to go by, then “proportionate” means new licenses for oil-and-gas exploration in the North Sea; Britain&#39;s first new deep coal mine for thirty years, which was approved last December; and the scrapping of a range of incentives to improve home insulation or to switch to electric vehicles, which Sunak oversaw as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tag/boris-johnson&quot;>;Boris Johnson&lt;/a>;&#39;s Chancellor of the Exchequer. Sunak has never seemed to take the future of the planet seriously. Johnson, to give him his due, brought his customary, shallow bluster. In 2021, Johnson treated the &lt;em >;COP&lt;/em>;26 climate-change summit, in Glasgow, to the joys of his egomania and manic charm. In 2022, weeks after becoming Prime Minister, Sunak had to be shamed by party colleagues and international criticism into attending &lt;em >;COP&lt;/em>;27, in Sharm el-Sheikh, at all.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Since Sunak took office, by default (there was no leadership contest, after the spontaneous political combustion of Prime Minister &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/a-humiliating-end-to-trussonomics&quot;>;Liz Truss&lt;/a>;), there has been a gradual, but angry, exodus of Conservative politicians or officials distressed by his administration&#39;s indifference to the climate crisis—an issue that commands a broad consensus among the British public. (According to the Office for National Statistics, a steady seventy-five per cent of Britons, over the age of sixteen, describe themselves as “very or somewhat” worried about climate change). In June, Lord Deben, the chairman of the UK&#39;s Climate Change Committee, an independent body that reports on the government&#39;s progress—or lack of—toward its climate commitments, warned Sunak that Britain had “lost its clear global climate leadership” and was falling behind the United States and Europe in its transition to a low-carbon economy. Deben is eighty-three and a former environment minister under &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/12/02/its-still-mrs-thatchers-britain&quot;>;Margaret Thatcher&lt;/a>;. “Our children will not forgive us if we leave them a world of withering heat and devastating storms where sea level rises and extreme temperatures force millions to move because their countries are no longer habitable,” he wrote in a public letter to Sunak. “None of us can avoid our responsibility. Delay is not an option.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;At first glance, Sunak&#39;s disregard for humanity&#39;s greatest political challenge is hard to fathom. Whatever damage it has done, looking after the environment and curbing greenhouse-gas emissions has figured into Conservative party policy as far back as the late eighties. In November, 1989, Thatcher, who trained as a research chemist, warned the United Nations General Assembly of the “insidious danger” of climate change and “the prospect of irretrievable damage to the atmosphere, to the oceans, to earth itself.” Sunak is a technocrat. His political brand, such as it is, is of a switched-on tech bro, scrolling his way through the &lt;em>;Financial Times.&lt;/em>; He is forty-three. He has an MBA from Stanford. He likes talking about AI&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;As the news broke on Tuesday night of Sunak&#39;s retreat from the government&#39;s climate ambitions, it was possible to sense the shock of financial institutions, manufacturers, climate scientists, and fellow-Conservatives feeling abandoned by one of their own. “I just came out of a meeting where a chunk of the British economy was assured by ministers that net zero was a top priority and that policy stability was crucial for investors,” Emma Pinchbeck, the chief executive of Energy UK, which represents the country&#39;s energy industry, told the &lt;em>;Guardian.&lt;/em>; “Now this.” Lisa Brankin, the chair of Ford UK, which has invested more than five hundred million dollars in its British car plants to meet the 2030 phaseout of new gas- and diesel-driven cars, expressed her dismay: “Our business needs three things from the UK government: ambition, commitment and consistency. A relaxation of 2030 would undermine all three.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The most plausible explanation for Sunak&#39;s decision is that it is shameful political posturing. One of the depressing parts of trying to explain contemporary British politics is being honest about quite how small-minded and contingent it is. In July, the Conservatives narrowly won a by-election in Uxbridge and South Ruislip, Johnson&#39;s former parliamentary seat, in West London. Although the party had held Uxbridge for more than fifty years, it was a rare electoral success for Sunak. (The Conservatives are some twenty points behind in the opinion polls and have lost a slew of similar contests since he took office.) The win in suburban Uxbridge was put down to vigorous local campaigning against London&#39;s Ultra Low Emission Zone, a daily levy on people driving older, polluting cars, which has recently expanded to cover the whole city. Sunak faces a general election, most likely next spring, which he is expected to lose. Tapping into public unease about the short-term costs of decarbonizing the economy (rather than attempting to do anything about that) is now a wedge issue that the Tories hope to exploit against Keir Starmer&#39;s Labour Party, which is timid and easily spooked about such things. Sunak&#39;s more nihilistic right-wing colleagues have swung in eagerly behind the policy shift. “We are not going to save the planet by bankrupting the British people,” Suella Braverman, the Home Secretary and moving spirit behind the government&#39;s inhumane new policies toward refugees, said on Wednesday morning. Jacob Rees-Mogg, the sonorous Brexiteer who served, briefly, as Truss&#39;s Business Secretary, said that his constituents did not want to be poor and cold. Rees-Mogg, who has an estimated net worth of more than a hundred million pounds, described net zero as “a scheme of the élite.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Sunak had planned to give a speech explaining his more proportionate approach to the climate emergency later in the week. But the news cycle, like a warming ocean, or a wildfire, does not always conform to a politician&#39;s plans. Instead, he was bounced into an emergency meeting of his cabinet and an address, in Downing Street, on Wednesday afternoon. “We&#39;ve stumbled into a consensus about the future of our country that no one seems to be happy with,” Sunak said, speaking from a lectern decorated with the slogan “Long-Term Decisions for a Brighter Future.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Sunak called for honesty about the costs of decarbonizing the economy and ruled out some scary-sounding policy ideas that nobody was seriously suggesting: punitively high taxes on air travel; compulsory carpooling; a special tax on meat. “This debate needs more clarity, not more emotion,” the Prime Minister said, not long after describing the UK—which in 2020 had higher carbon emissions per capita than France, Spain, or Sweden, and is Europe&#39;s second-largest extractor of fossil fuels—as “so far ahead of every country in the world.” Then he slipped in the good news: “We&#39;re going to ease the transition to electric vehicles,” along with the scrapping or dialling down of various other measures to improve the energy performance of Britain&#39;s generally old and poorly insulated housing stock. In the end, Sunak could argue that the changes aren&#39;t so dramatic. Delaying Britain&#39;s phaseout of gas- and diesel-driven cars to 2035 merely moves it out of the overachievers&#39; club of countries such as Singapore and Norway and into the company of Germany, Canada, and the state of New York. But there was the whisper of moral abdication in his words as well. “When our share of global emissions is less than one per cent, how can it be right that British citizens are now being told to sacrifice even more than others?” Sunak asked. Why, for that matter, sacrifice anything at all? That has always been the shameless argument of rich, polluting nations in the politics of climate change, and Sunak did not shrink from it at all. He wants more time. We all do. It doesn&#39;t mean he is going to get it. ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;o4v83v&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;v7azma&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 22 Sep 2023 03:06:01 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
