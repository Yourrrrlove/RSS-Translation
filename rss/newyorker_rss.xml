data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;保持运动活力是一项艰苦的工作——它们依靠志愿者的能量运行，并且可能会脱轨太多的成功、太多的失败、太多的内部冲突、太多的利益竞争。或者它们可能会受到一场流行病的阻碍，这场流行病在很大程度上使气候运动在 2019 年 9 月达到最大单日后几个月就陷入停滞，当时世界各地有数百万人&lt;a href=&quot;https://www. newyorker.com/culture/culture-comment/new-yorks-climate-strike-and-the-things-that-make-teen-agers-march&quot;>;他们中的大多数都很年轻&lt;/a>;，走上街头； &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/photo-booth/the-faces-of-young-protesters-at-new-york-citys-climate-strike&quot;>;纽约市&lt;/ a>;，据组织者称，其中有 25 万人加入了当时 16 岁的瑞典气候活动家 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/books/under-review/how-greta-thunberg-将存在主义恐惧转化为运动&quot;>;格蕾塔·桑伯格 (Greta Thunberg)&lt;/a>; 在电池区。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;周日的终结化石燃料游行规模并不大——代表亚历山大·奥卡西奥-科尔特斯 (Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez) 在当天结束时进行了激动人心的总结演讲，预计现场人数在五到七万人之间，组织者称有七万五千人，&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09 /17/climate/climate-protests-new-york.html&quot;>;&lt;em>;时代&lt;/em>;&lt;/a>;出现了“数万人”。但这并不重要——游行规模比组织者预期的要大得多，代表着气候活动人士真正重返街头。我沿着行军路线来回徘徊，从五十年代十字城的百老汇到联合国附近的第一大道；阳光明媚，情绪高昂，&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/children-lead-the-way-a-gallery-of-youth-made- Climate-strike-signs&quot;>;标志&lt;/a>;很聪明。 （“莱昂纳多·迪卡普里奥的女朋友应该有未来。”）&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;我认识领导游行的许多人：第三幕，我帮助成立的六十岁以上进步团体，从俄亥俄州、宾夕法尼亚州、佛蒙特州、康涅狄格州、新罕布什尔州、马萨诸塞州以及纽约各地；还有一些经验丰富的组织者，例如嘻哈核心小组的伦诺克斯·耶尔伍德牧师和&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-new-yorker-interview/naomi-klein-sees- uncanny-doubles-in-our-politics&quot;>;Naomi Klein&lt;/a>;，她从新书巡演中抽出时间参加新发布的“&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/ Doppelganger-Trip-into-Mirror-World/dp/0374610320&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Doppelganger -Trip-into-Mirror-World/dp/0374610320&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Doppelganger-Trip-into-Mirror-World/dp/0374610320&quot;

aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt; div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Ocasio-Cortez 代表&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbCIZebVUtY&quot;>;重复了这一主题&lt;/a>;昨天。 “这意味着一些事情，”她告诉游行者。 “我一直在华盛顿的房间里，人们都说他们对这个问题有承诺，但我们需要紧迫感。”她可能一直在想拜登总统，他将于周二在联合国大会上发表讲话。在会议过程中的不同时刻，观众在提到他的名字时发出嘘声，因为他为新的化石燃料项目授予了许可，但他们也为奥卡西奥-科尔特斯保留了最响亮的欢呼声，当然，他支持拜登连任;显然，人们至少对这场召唤活动的政治现实有一定的了解。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;我与游行者交谈过，他们认为，考虑到夏季的气温可能是一年中最高的，参加人数应该更高。十二万五千年来，加拿大野火烟雾弥漫在美国城市的天空中，以及在利比亚造成可怕伤亡的史诗般的洪水。但发展或重新发展运动需要时间，而这一运动的良好氛围将使下一个这样的日子更容易招募。当然，我们没有无尽的时间。但昨天是关键的、轻松的一步。世界再次前进。 ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot;

aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;在接下来的三十年里，德哈德在多篇论文和两本书中详细阐述了他的观点，“&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Divine-Milieu-Newly-revised-Translation -Cowell/dp/1903900581&quot;

，即使他们时不时地亲自热情地谈论他。&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;然而，这位教皇强调以德哈德为榜样。从 2015 年开始，他关于气候问题的里程碑式通谕《愿你受赞颂》（Laudato Si）中（预计他将在下个月发布另一本通谕）中，他引用了德哈德的灵感。在蒙古庆祝主日弥撒后，方济各热情地谈到了德哈德，以及他在那里庆祝的弥撒一百周年。 “这位经常被误解的牧师，”他说，“凭直觉认为‘圣体圣事总是以某种方式在世界的祭坛上庆祝。’” ” 教皇正在将神父从边缘地带带回来，并加入他自己的亚洲之旅，前往德哈德。&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;方济各的商标其话语风格是发表即兴评论，显然是站在进步一边，但对如何实现进步却含糊其辞，这种倾向最近也引发了争议。 8 月 25 日，教宗方济各与年轻的俄罗斯天主教徒进行了视频通话，敦促他们与“圣徒、统治者的大俄罗斯、彼得一世、叶卡捷琳娜二世的大俄罗斯、那个伟大、开明、伟大的文化和伟大的人性”，乌克兰希腊天主教会领袖斯维亚托斯拉夫·舍夫丘克大主教立即谴责教皇庆祝过去和现在的俄罗斯帝国主义。随后，耶稣会杂志&lt;em>;La Civiltà Cattolica&lt;/em>;发表了方济各在本月早些时候访问期间与葡萄牙耶稣会士的部分谈话记录。当有人问及包括主教在内的一些美国天主教徒对他的公开批评时，方济各详细地回答了。 “你已经看到，美国的情况并不容易：反动态度非常强烈。它是有组织的，塑造了人们的归属方式，甚至是情感上的归属方式，”他说。 “我想提醒那些人，&lt;em>;独立主义&lt;/em>;”——落后——“是没有用的，我们需要明白，对信仰问题的理解有一个适当的演变。”他后来补充道，“你谈论的那些美国团体如此封闭，正在孤立自己。他们不是靠教义生活，不是靠总是发展和结出果实的真正教义生活，而是靠意识形态生活。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;每个人都想知道，方济各在谈论哪些美国团体？在&lt;em>;泰晤士报&lt;/em>;中，美国保护传统、家庭和财产协会的 C. Preston Noell III（一个位于宾夕法尼亚州的一个巴西团体的分支，成立于 1960 年，旨在抵制所谓的共产主义影响）教会）指出，方济各在美国担任教皇还不到一周，这表明他对这里教会的生活知之甚少。 《华盛顿邮报》刊登了一份嫌疑人档案，其中包括阿拉巴马州传统天主教有线电视网络 EWTN 的主持人雷蒙德·阿罗约 (Raymond Arroyo)，他是该网络反对方济各的化身。其他人则提到红衣主教雷蒙德·伯克(Raymond Burke)，他曾担任圣路易斯大主教，后来担任梵蒂冈官员，直到2014年被免职，并于今年早些时候被另一职位取代。在 &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Synodal-Process-Pandoras-Box-Questions/dp/1877905771&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&quot;element&quot; 的前言中， ：“ExternalLink”、“outgoingURL”：“https://www.amazon.com/Synodal-Process-Pandoras-Box-Questions/dp/1877905771”}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon. com/Synodal-Process-Pandoras-Box-Questions/dp/1877905771&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;新书&lt;/a>;，伯克写道，十月会议将造成“混乱和错误”并导致“对许多灵魂造成严重伤害”。该书已由保护传统、家庭和财产协会以八种语言出版，该协会已向主教和神职人员发送了副本，其中一些人将成为主教会议的代表。&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt; /div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node- id=&quot;a16dn&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;nxwq5 &quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;很可能这些人是方济各在葡萄牙与耶稣会士交谈时想到的一些人。但从美国天主教在全球天主教近代史上的地位来审视他的言论也许更具启发性。这就是“一切崛起必汇聚”这一观念的恰当之处。一个世纪前，“现代主义”和“美国主义”在天主教罗马人眼中是同义词。梵蒂冈二世对宗教自由原则的肯定植根于美国耶稣会政治哲学家约翰·考特尼·默里的著作。 1965 年 10 月，教皇保罗六世访问纽约，在圣帕特里克大教堂发表讲话，在华尔道夫酒店会见约翰逊总统，在联合国大会上发表讲话，在洋基体育场举行弥撒，并参观了世界博览会在一天之内举行——可以说是他任期内的顶峰。梵蒂冈二世之后的乡土礼仪、现代棱角分明的教堂建筑、强调与其他基督教会和其他信仰的友好关系，都非常适合人口众多、影响力大、灵活且繁荣的美国教会。 1978 年 10 月当选的约翰·保罗二世在早期两次访问美国时获得了标志性的地位，并受到罗纳德·里根总统的推崇。约翰·保罗在美国天主教徒中仍然非常受欢迎，尽管许多人不同意或远离他所采取的特定立场。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;约翰·保罗和他的副手红衣主教约瑟夫·拉辛格也重塑了美国神职人员和等级制度。他们的形象，宣扬极端正统、坚决反对同性恋和堕胎的男性。美国红衣主教——约翰·奥康纳，纽约；伯纳德·劳，波士顿； &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/what-the-new-vatican-report-shows-about-the-churchs-failure-to-address- Sex-abuse&quot;>;居住在纽瓦克和华盛顿特区的西奥多·麦卡里克（Theodore McCarrick）享有与教皇的特殊接触。当拉辛格接替约翰·保罗，成为本笃十六世时，纽约的蒂莫西·多兰、费城的查尔斯·查普特和洛杉矶的何塞·戈麦斯接替了他们，他们在梵蒂冈的地位赋予了他们在美国教会的地位，而副总统反之亦然。随着天主教在欧洲和拉丁美洲失去影响力，在美国，它对公共政策的影响力却越来越大，这一发展最终导致&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tag/roe- v-韦德&quot;>;罗伊诉韦德&lt;/a>;。想象一位美国人可能当选教皇并不夸张——比如说红衣主教多兰，他的名字出现在 2013 年本笃辞职后的候选名单上。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;相反，布宜诺斯艾利斯的耶稣会红衣主教是当选。这位来自美洲的第一位教皇不仅没有表现出对美国的特别尊重，而且还没有表现出对美国的尊重。美国教会已经成为阻碍方济各和他的天主教愿景的教会。这一愿景致力于穷人和决心走向世界边缘的人，致力于“近在咫尺”的上帝，相信，正如德哈德所说，“上帝离我们并不遥远。他是我的笔、我的镐、我的画笔、我的针——还有我的心和我的思想。”也就是说，传统主义美国天主教的崛起遇到了进步的拉丁美洲教皇的崛起，他的愿景集中在南半球。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;所有这一切都是下个月即将到来的清算的前奏。会议。人们熟悉的说法是，方济各的年龄——他将在十二月满八十七岁——使得他迫切需要努力促进教会的进步。但美国传统主义者的老龄化也同样重要。红衣主教大主教（大城市总教区的负责人）必须在年满七十五岁时提交辞呈，而那些被允许留下来的人一旦年满八十就不能再在红衣主教团中投票选举新教皇。伯克红衣主教七十五岁；红衣主教多兰将作为主教会议的代表，现年七十三岁。传统主义者有理由担心方济各将带领教会进入九十多岁（如果不是本笃十六世在八十五岁时意外退休，他可能会这样做），然后将教皇职位让给他所任命的年轻红衣主教选出的继任者。任命。对于传统主义者来说，这次会议就像是最后一站，刚刚过去的两位教皇的遗产将与现任教皇的决心融合在一起。 ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;q5sq0c&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt; div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-隐藏=“true”>;&lt;div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/ div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;div>;&lt;div>;&lt;div>;&lt;div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 19 Sep 2023 01:06:01 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Jeremy O.

Harris) 住在伦敦的一套两层公寓里。他前往那里拍摄自己的戏剧《爸爸》，该剧讲述了一位年轻的黑人艺术家被一位年长的白人所奴役的故事。《爸爸》一年前在百老汇外首演，原定于 2020 年 3 月底在阿尔梅达剧院上演；这将是哈里斯在海外的首次专业演出。但演出没有开演，哈里斯一直滞留在伦敦几个星期，然后，最终，几个月。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;对这部戏感到悲伤，对这个世界感到害怕，他在最初的几周里没有写作——尽管许多截止日期，他生活中不变的同伴，都徘徊在边缘自高中以来，哈里斯就利用深夜和清晨作为工作、聚会以及与朋友谈论艺术的时间；现在他狂看动漫，听 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/03/23/fiona-apples-art-of-radical-sensitivity&quot;>;Fiona Apple&lt;/a>; 和开始阅读 Audre Lorde 的“&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Sister-Outsider-Speeches-Crossing-Feminist/dp/1580911862/&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot ;:“ExternalLink”、“outgoingURL”：“https://www.amazon.com/Sister-Outsider-Speeches-Crossing-Feminist/dp/1580911862/”}&quot; href=&quot;https://www .amazon.com/Sister-Outsider-Speeches-Crossing-Feminist/dp/1580911862/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;Sister Outsider&lt;/a>;”，他一直想去那里。几周过去了，他厌倦了自己的吸血鬼身份。 “我决定要更频繁地看到太阳，”四月的一个早晨，他说道，此时光束在公寓的墙壁上留下了明亮的矩形。正常时间起床意味着要处理行人的烦恼。他开始从附近的一家咖啡馆点咖啡，连续两次，虽然他点的是黑咖啡，但送来的是牛奶。 “这就好像，每个人都在看《反美国阴谋》，”他指的是根据菲利普·罗斯小说改编的 HBO 迷你剧，“这感觉非常像《反杰里米阴谋》。” ”&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;哈里斯是很高，很瘦，以即兴的精确度处理自己的身体，非正式中夹杂着正式，就像休息日在商场里的舞者一样。从肩膀开始的动作总是在指尖结束。当他在句子之间摸索思想时，他会用手在空中画出形状。他有着白皙的雪松皮肤和一张活泼的大嘴。当他处于中性情绪时，他的眼睛平静且低垂，但当他讲故事或表达紧急（通常是反对）意见时，他的眼睛睁得大大的。故事有时会促使他站起来，对关键的动作段落进行哑剧表演。在写作之前，他的第一个梦想就是行动。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;当第三杯咖啡端上来时，他终于正确地坐在靠窗的沙发上，点燃了一支香烟。他说，尽管致命的呼吸道疾病在全球范围内蔓延，他认识的很多人又开始吸烟了：“我们的肺部随时可能衰竭，而我们只是，你知道，去他妈的。”&lt;/p >;&lt;p>;咖啡和美国精神，窗外的白光——他在阳光下醒来的本能得到了证实。白天的公寓很舒适。一面墙上挂着一幅巨大的抽象画，颜色为黄褐色和酒红色，涂着明亮的口红。 Upstairs was a bedroom that he shared with his newish boyfriend, Arvand Khosravi, a film and television executive. At the top of the staircase was a glass door leading out to a shallow ledge on the roof, where Harris often went to film TikTok videos—mostly poppy, fast-paced riffs on scenes from classic plays—which he had been posting almost daily. In one, titled “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://twitter.com/jeremyoharris/status/1246604978346754049&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://twitter.com/jeremyoharris/status/1246604978346754049&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jeremyoharris/status/1246604978346754049&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;Titus Andronicus Act V&lt;/a>;,” he lip-synchs dialogue from the TV show “Catfish,” in four different costumes; it&#39;s nine seconds long.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Harris did the TikToks for fun; they were, for weeks, his sole avenue of creative expression. But they were also, not so subtly, a dig at the profession through which he had gained his recent fame. Rooted in the history and the canonical repertoire of theatre, but yoked dramaturgically to hyper-current rhythms and attitudes and styles, the TikToks showed that Harris could do what the big arts institutions couldn&#39;t—keep up. While they floundered, he figured, the show would go on from his phone. He had changed the bio on his frequently updated Twitter account to a kind of epitaph for the theatre: “I spent my 20s devoted to a craft in a coma.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Stages everywhere were dark; theatre companies and nonprofits were scrambling. In both their public statements and their private conversations with playwrights, they projected blithe optimism, as though their operations would be up and running by summer&#39;s end.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Like, no, guys!” Harris said, describing his frustration. “We have to reinvent this or re-create this, or else it&#39;s going to be even more detrimental to artists in six months, when you guys have wasted your resources trying to go the normal way.” “Daddy” was still in British limbo, and he had another play, “A Boy&#39;s Company Presents: &#39;Tell Me If I&#39;m Hurting You&#39; ”—his version of a Jacobean revenge drama, based on a particularly bad breakup—scheduled to début in May, at Playwrights Horizons, in New York. Nobody would officially admit—or, perhaps, allow themselves to believe—that the upcoming seasons wouldn&#39;t happen, but Harris was already mourning the new play, just as he was mourning “Daddy.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;His ire notwithstanding, thinking and talking about the failures of his industry seemed to energize him—almost to soothe him—and his online complaints soon came to echo a wider mood. As the initial shock of the pandemic gave way to a reëvaluation of racial and other societal arrangements, Harris became a kind of spokesman for the long-standing and suddenly stark unrest felt by his fellow-artists. It was a moment well suited to Harris&#39;s natural, if somewhat paradoxical, penchant for institutional critique. A happy disrupter of genteel silences, he has nonetheless, however rockily, charted a professional and personal path through some of the entertainment world&#39;s most staid establishment outposts: the Yale School of Drama; Gucci, for which he does modelling; various Hollywood-adjacent neighborhoods in Los Angeles; and now, most visibly, the Great White Way. The previous fall, “Slave Play,” the first of Harris&#39;s works to be staged in New York, had transferred to the Golden Theatre, on Broadway, after an extended run at the venerable New York Theatre Workshop, downtown.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Slave Play” tells the story of three interracial couples undergoing “antebellum sexual-performance therapy,” in order, presumably, to mend the edges of their relationships, which have been frayed by race. In the first act, before the audience is in on the premise, the couples—dressed in nineteenth-century garb, as masters and slaves—engage in various kinky sexual scenarios calibrated to set off trip wires in race- and sex-sensitive American minds. The second act, in which the actual therapy takes place, is straightforwardly funny. The third is a surreal, largely horrifying duet between one of the couples, a Black woman and her white husband. Over and over, “Slave Play” calls into question the true parameters of sexual consent and tries to wring current-day catharsis from the brutal history of master-slave rape.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;In some corners—including this magazine, in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/12/24/black-and-white-in-slave-play-and-to-kill-a-mockingbird&quot;>;review&lt;/a>; that I wrote—Harris was lauded for the wild rigor of his vision and the originality of his voice. And the play&#39;s overwhelming success was the precondition for many of the luxuries he now enjoyed: the London flat, the European engagement, a two-year development deal that he had recently signed with HBO. At the same time, “Slave Play” was a kind of troll job, perversely aimed at unsettling and possibly enraging the various constituencies—racial, sexual, institutional, professional—to which he belonged. Harris must have known that the play would have this effect; he seemed to revel in the discursive mess it left in its wake. Even before the pandemic, he had earned a reputation as an enfant terrible, the kind of designation that is made possible only by way of proximity. You&#39;ve got to be fairly close to the big house to even consider throwing stones.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Something I&#39;ve always wondered is when I&#39;m going to develop the affected-Black-intellectual voice,” Harris said that summer, still stuck in London. He was reflecting on some of his favorite writers and artists of an older generation, and the way that their talk was often as effortfully stylized as their work. He&#39;d been thinking about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1994/11/07/andre-leon-talley-vogue-the-only-one&quot;>;André Leon Talley&lt;/a>;, the fashion writer and editor whose high diction and baroque syntax became hallmarks of his style—and seemed, moreover, like a way of asserting his belonging in a largely white milieu. Talley, who died last year, was, like Harris, a tall, queer, highly verbal Black man from the South. His web of complex, sometimes tortured relationships with white co-workers, bosses, and benefactors was consonant with—and had possibly even influenced—the dynamics depicted in “Slave Play.” Harris is unabashed in his study of other artists&#39; personas. “I&#39;m so interested in personal style, and personal relationships, and class—if not class ascension, then class association,” he said. “Just the lilt of certain people.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Talk of that voice—I knew what Harris meant without having to ask—got me thinking, perhaps slightly defensively, of my own.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“You have it a little bit,” he said, confirming a fear I&#39;d spoken aloud.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;We agreed, though, that the voice of our rough age cohort—Harris is thirty-four—was particular. The sort of Black Millennial writer whom Harris had in mind was not someone who would deploy the suavely concatenated sentences of James Baldwin. Rather, this hypothetical thirtysomething, as eager to showcase pop-cultural with-it-ness and egalitarian humility as to display hard-won verbal acuity, would use locutions peppered with pointed “like”s and “um”s, plus a bit of vocal fry, for subtler tones of falsely self-deprecating color: a Valley Girl with an advanced degree.&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot;

” Harris said. “But also, partially, I think unconsciously, I did it so that my intellect wouldn&#39;t be intimidating to everyone around me. This is a part of my plays that was also a part of growing up—I&#39;ve always had to figure out how to translate stuff from the academy into language that my mom could understand, without asking her to take time from her life to read, like, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/10/26/how-saidiya-hartman-retells-the-history-of-black-life&quot;>;Saidiya Hartman&lt;/a>;.” A dramaturgical note for “Slave Play” quoted both Hartman and Hortense Spillers, another Black feminist scholar, but the play itself takes Rihanna as its primary muse. “I had to bring my learning into a different space of understanding, which is why it&#39;s so much more fun for me to write plays that are based in theory than it is for me to go, &#39;And then Jonathan wanted to get a divorce from Becca,&#39; or things like that.”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;dn7vnr&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Harris speaks in a restless tenor, alternating locomotive bursts with considered pauses; his voice is bright and brackish and warm. He talks about movies and plays and clothes and people&#39;s bodies constantly. His sentences often start with “Have you seen?” or “Have you read?” Unless he already knows, from your work—almost all his friends are artists or public people of one kind or another—that you&#39;ve seen it or read it, and what you think about it, and is prepared to gently argue. He says “yes,” encouragingly but without much emphasis, when he hears something he agrees with, never “yeah.” Two words he uses a lot are “ostensibly” and “psychotic.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Harris was raised in Martinsville, Virginia, among people who made their livings with their bodies, many of them in factories. His way with words marked him as different. His mother, Veronica Farrish, refused to let family members use baby talk with him. He taught himself to read, and was soon the kind of prematurely unimpressed kid who finds it easier to make friends with teachers than with classmates. When Harris was eight, one of his favorite pastimes, he said, was trading theories with his mother about what had happened to JonBenét Ramsey, the six-year-old pageant contestant whose murder was a tabloid bonanza in the late nineties: “I was, like, &#39;OK, I looked at this document.&#39; ”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;His early interest in true crime briefly convinced him that he wanted to be a lawyer—that standby aspiration for the precociously talkative. But after landing a part in his middle school&#39;s production of “My Fair Lady,” he realized that he possibly just wanted to play a lawyer on TV. Around the same time, Harris was realizing that he was gay, or at least different—this difference was the rare condition for which he didn&#39;t yet have the words. Another discomfort was the unsettled nature of his home life. He didn&#39;t meet his biological father until he was nine or ten; his mother married another man when Harris was four, got divorced when Harris was in middle school, then embarked on another short-lived marriage, to a military man stationed at what was then Fort Bragg, in North Carolina. Harris moved there with his mother and enrolled in a new school. “I was so upset,” he said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Harris spent much of his childhood in private Christian schools, helped by financial aid. As a result, he became comfortable with the discombobulating tension of being a poor Black kid in a largely rich, white environment. Then, in tenth grade, he got a scholarship to Carlisle, a prep school in Martinsville. In the hallways, there were pictures of each graduating class. As Harris recalls, Black faces didn&#39;t begin showing up in the photographs until the mid-nineties, when the school started a basketball team. “Everybody wanted me to play basketball,” Harris said. “And I was, like, No. I hated that so much. I was, like, I will &lt;em>;never&lt;/em>; do that.” Instead, he took up swimming and dance. He kept up his practice of befriending teachers. “Candace—and Paula, who taught in the middle school,” he recalled, “I would have coffee with them after school, and they were my friends.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;By this point, Harris was determined to be an actor. He got parts in plays and musicals and directed a production of “The Laramie Project,” Moisés Kaufman&#39;s documentary play about the aftermath of the killing of Matthew Shepard, a gay student at the University of Wyoming. His kaffeeklatsch pal Candace Owen-Williams, who taught drama at Carlisle, let him turn an empty trailer behind the school into a black-box theatre, where he and some other friends put on experimental shows. His senior thesis was a one-man production of Wallace Shawn&#39;s “The Fever.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;For college, Harris went to the acting conservatory at DePaul University, in Chicago. The program&#39;s structure was brutal: after freshman year, only half of the students were allowed to continue with the acting cohort; the others were cut, and had to pursue different fields of study if they wished to remain at the school. Harris found the first year—essentially a protracted audition—disorienting. “A lot of my teachers said that my intellect was going to get in the way of me being a real actor,” he said. “I always sort of directed or rewrote the circumstances of the scene to fit the emotional states that I wanted to play around in, to make it more interesting to me.” Part of the problem, he said, was that so many of the roles and scenes were geared toward white actors. But he internalized the message that “if you&#39;re smart, you have to hide it,” he said. “I still stand by all my choices,” he added, “because, in some ways, I made cooler theatre then than I&#39;m making now.” For an exercise in “auto-drama,” he put twenty lamps of different shapes and sizes onstage. The lamps were the only source of light in the show; each one represented a story connected to a father figure. Then, as now, Harris was seeking, and sometimes finding, masked ways to describe the absence left by his actual father. In the glow of each light, he told a version of a memory.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;After the first semester, Harris chopped his long hair, nervous about how his teachers might perceive him. When the program made its cuts, the following summer, he called his friend and classmate Erika J. Simpson. Neither had got in. They were quiet for a long time.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;alua1&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;It was June—a beautiful month in Chicago but, for Harris, who had just turned nineteen, the grim beginning of an uncertain period. He called one of his teachers to ask why he&#39;d been dismissed; she said that he wouldn&#39;t be “castable” as an actor until his thirties, and rattled off a list of reasons that felt, to him, like “gay-coded shit.” He told me, “There were four Black boys in our year, and the two that got cut were the ones that felt the femme-est.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;He started collecting issues of the Chicago &lt;em>;Reader&lt;/em>;, a free alternative newspaper whose pages he trawled for acting notices. At an audition, he broke down, crying and trembling. He explained himself to the producers—some of them had gone to DePaul; they understood—and they told him that he could step out of the room for a moment, compose himself, and try again. Instead, he just left.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Eventually, Harris got modest parts at small venues in the city. He became an English major, and briefly imagined writing poems. He was interested in the work of Ai, a mixed-race woman from Arizona whose poor upbringing reminded Harris of his own. In her poems, Ai, who died in 2010, inhabited the voices of tough, sly, vulnerable working-class people asserting their dignity—or, at least, some measure of hip and artful defiance—against the backdrop of an indifferent and often hostile world. “You say you want this story / in my own words, / but you won&#39;t tell it my way,” her poem “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/browse?volume=151&amp;amp;issue=1&amp;amp;page=14&quot;>;Interview with a Policeman&lt;/a>;,” from 1987, begins. Her work would come to influence Harris&#39;s understanding of the possibilities of monologue.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;But Harris didn&#39;t remain an English major, or a DePaul student, for long. He dropped out and, a year later, moved to Los Angeles.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;By the end of the first pandemic summer, Harris and Khosravi had left the London apartment and were driving around Europe in a car full of their stuff. Khosravi had felt too cooped up in their flat, but Harris refused to move back to the US “This is why it&#39;s hell to date me,” he said. The pair were in Naples, Italy, in mid-October, when Tony nominations were announced, on a live stream. It was evening in Italy; Harris got on FaceTime with his mom, nieces, and nephew, so that he could watch it with them. He had to hop off about four nominations in because the stream that his mom was watching was ahead of his, and she kept screaming before he&#39;d seen the news. In the end, “Slave Play” got twelve nominations, more than any non-musical production had before.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Slave Play” was a genuinely difficult piece of work, a deliberate provocation. At one post-show Q. &amp;amp; A., a white woman yelled at Harris that she didn&#39;t “want to hear that white people are the fucking problem all the time.” Some Black audience members insisted that the play was oriented toward a “white gaze,” and was a cynical exploitation of the intertwined subjects of slavery and rape. Both currents of backlash were more or less predictable. The dozen nominations seemed to indicate that Harris could start a food fight in the theatre world&#39;s living room and still be invited to sit at its dinner table.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“It emboldens me to be more forthright with my opinions and how I feel about the world, because, if I gave a fuck about what institutions were actually saying to me, the &#39;Slave Play&#39; that got twelve nominations would not be the &#39;Slave Play&#39; that got twelve nominations,” he said. “It would have been a dumber play, and a less complex play, and a less Jeremy play.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;But this institutional approbation also posed a kind of creative challenge. “I think the thing that I&#39;m trying to get over—and I&#39;ve been working on this a lot over the last year—is other people&#39;s excitement about me,” Harris said. “It&#39;s easier for me to write when I&#39;m writing from a place of, like, &#39;These people don&#39;t believe in me enough.&#39; When I have something to prove, I can write so much better.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Since his time in LA, if not before, Harris had defined himself in opposition to those around him—or, at least, those with power. He had initially made his way not in professional settings but in the more free-flowing dynamic of late-night scenes. In Chicago, he had begun to understand his personality and physical bearing as a kind of talent. He was funny and gay and six feet five; people gravitated toward him and wanted him to come to their parties. He got a job at a trendy women&#39;s boutique in Wicker Park, &lt;em >;AKIRA&lt;/em>;, where he helped clients find going-out outfits. Often, those clients would invite him to clubs. Soon, he was a night-life fixture.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“I am the No. 1 person who will tell you that I hate gay bars, because I don&#39;t have as much power there,” he told me. “Black and skinny and charismatic—it gives you much more power in a straight bar than in a gay bar. I wasn&#39;t threatening to the straight men there. And I was also a weird honeypot for the night clubs because all these fun girls would want to stick around longer to hang out, and buy more bottles, too.” Night life is a churning economy, only partially visible to most people, a system behind a veil.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;He carved out a similar space in LA, getting a day job where cool and connected people were sure to buy clothes—Barneys this time—and becoming a regular presence in the clubs. He made friends, some of them in show business, and asked around about how to find his way in the industry. Among the people he talked to at parties were important future collaborators: the writer and director Sam Levinson, the filmmaker Janicza Bravo. “I think that my verbal abilities helped me navigate the space,” he said. “And also my style. I have good-to-decent style.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Harris got small acting gigs: he starred in a short film directed by the actor James Franco; he appeared, very briefly, in the Terrence Malick movie “Song to Song.” But he hated the idea of being at the mercy of gatekeepers, who, like his teachers at DePaul, might label him uncastable. When Lena Dunham&#39;s show “Girls” débuted on HBO, in the spring of 2012, he saw her as a kindred spirit, and a role model. Watching “Girls,” he thought, “This is so perfect, and also I think I could do it.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Like Dunham—and like Ilana Glazer and Abbi Jacobson, of “Broad City,” another inspiration—Harris and Erika Simpson, his friend from DePaul, created a Web series, “#NightStrife,” and uploaded it to YouTube. “It&#39;s two twentysomethings trying to get famous,” Simpson says, by way of explanation, in the first episode. They made only a few episodes, which were not widely seen, though a tongue-in-cheek series promo of sorts, titled “Black Girl Takes a Shit,” has been watched nearly eighty thousand times.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Harris became jaded about Hollywood; he stopped acting, and stopped referring to himself as an actor. He started to call himself a playwright, though he had yet to write a play. He cast about for ideas, unsuccessfully, until he went on a date with a porn star, whose stories yielded the material for Harris&#39;s first play, “Xander Xyst, Dragon: 1,” a kind of fantasia on the theme of online celebrity. With the play—which featured music by Isabella Summers, of Florence and the Machine, another friend he&#39;d made in LA—he won a spot at the Samuel French Off-Off Broadway Short Play Festival, in 2014. There, he met a group of young playwrights who are now his contemporaries: Will Arbery, Martyna Majok, Leah Nanako Winkler, Eleanor Burgess.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Afterward, he applied for a fellowship at the MacDowell artists&#39; residency—and, when he was wait-listed, he called the administration every day until someone told him yes. At MacDowell, he met the playwright Amy Herzog, who encouraged him to apply to Yale. He&#39;d already finished a draft of “Daddy,” and he submitted it to the drama school&#39;s admissions board, along with a heartfelt essay. “The clearest memory I have of my childhood is elegantly staged,” he wrote. “Delicately, it moves in a realm between the cinematic and the theatrical: lights up on an open screen door leading into a wide hallway, my mother (early 30s) downstage paces from one off stage room to another whispering vitriol into a cordless phone, somewhere further off stage we can hear the sounds of a young girl crying, and upstage in profile I sit (12) back to back with a large suitcase looking out of the open door periodically. 。 。 。 Suddenly the crying stops replaced by The Pointer Sisters and my mother is standing with my sister in her arms in the middle of the hall tears, a smile and snot dancing on her face, &#39;He&#39;s not coming. Come on baby, let&#39;s dance,&#39; she said. So we did.”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;6a1t4b&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Harris has come to see “Daddy” as a play about furthering his career by seeking the opportunity and resources that an institution like Yale can provide. “Going to Yale was me deciding to marry a white guy on a hill and in order to have the time and space to make my work,” he &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.ssense.com/en-us/editorial/culture/oh-jeremy&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.ssense.com/en-us/editorial/culture/oh-jeremy&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.ssense.com/en-us/editorial/culture/oh-jeremy&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;told&lt;/a>; one interviewer. Elsewhere, he has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vice.com/en/article/8qgm9g/decolonizing-my-desire&quot;>;described&lt;/a>; the play as an attempt “to parse the ways I was cradled, coddled and collected by white institutions and how I&#39;ve collected and used them in turn.” He once wrote that he went to Yale with eyes open, “believing that I could take more from this place than they would take from me.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In early 2021, the demands of Harris&#39;s still fairly young renown finally called him back to New York. &lt;em>;Town &amp;amp; Country&lt;/em>; had planned a multi-page spread to showcase his newly designed home office, which had been furnished by the chic design firm Green River Project. On a cold, pewter-sky morning in January, Harris sat in a studio belonging to Aaron Aujla, one of the firm&#39;s owners, at a nondescript former warehouse in Brooklyn, getting ready to have his picture taken. Someone tended to his hair, always a foremost point of interest in the looks he puts together for magazine covers and red carpets. There were small, feathery tufts of it strewn about the studio&#39;s bright-green floor.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“I think I want just a mustache,” Harris said. He&#39;d come to the shoot with several pictures of the Japanese writer Yukio Mishima at the ready on his phone. He pulled one up: Mishima in his office, behind a desk and flanked by books, pouting fiercely at the camera, his dark brows writhing. The writer&#39;s louche, vaguely sexual gaze did have something of the solitary mustache about it.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Harris has often, with a bit of a wink—and in spite of Mishima&#39;s reactionary politics—called Mishima his favorite writer. A few months earlier, he had tweeted, “Ok guys so to combat seasonal / pandemic depression and the sense that my life moves at a pace my body can&#39;t keep up with I&#39;ve decided to do a workout every day a la my favorite writer YUKIO MISHIMA. Who combatted depression and dread w/ workouts and a failed coup d&#39;état.” In 1970, Mishima and several members of a militia that he had formed attempted to take over a Japanese military base, in the hope of inspiring an overthrow of the country&#39;s constitution. After a fiery speech, Mishima—obsessed with physical beauty and warlike vigor—killed himself with a sword. “Do I hate fascists?” Harris wrote, in another tweet. “Yes. Do I love Mishima?是的。 I&#39;m a Gemini. Two truths can be held.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Aujla puttered in and out of the studio, smiling and not saying much. He is married to the fashion designer Emily Bode, known for her knit menswear; she and Aujla are neighbors of Harris&#39;s, in Chinatown, and have become his friends. She&#39;d brought a rack of clothes for Harris to choose from. Once in a while, he&#39;d disappear behind a curtain and come out wearing a pair of fluid trousers or a lacy top or a burgundy suit, evocative of Mishima. (He selected the suit as one of his outfits.) When something tickled him, he let his voice rise to a high, smoky giggle. “That&#39;s cunt,” he sometimes said. Between costume changes, he chatted about recent movies, especially a new coming-of-age indie film that everybody seemed to like but that he couldn&#39;t bring himself to watch.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;“Arvand hates me for this,” Harris said, referring to his Hollywood-exec boyfriend, “but I can&#39;t stand this kind of shit.” He went on, “It&#39;s always that same thing: &#39;Here I am, marginalized little kid—Black, immigrant, gay, whatever—and here&#39;s the &lt;em>;wide&lt;/em>;, &lt;em>;wide world&lt;/em>;.&#39; ” By now he was acting out the archetype, hunched into a pantomime of childish wonder, his eyes big with fear, his hands clasped. “And now there&#39;s big trouble”—he cowered in terror—“and inner strife”—he anxiously trembled—“but soon”—now he let a smile spread across his face—“I overcome.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“I knew exactly what that movie was gonna be the moment it started, and I was, like, No, thank you,” he said. Bode, who has a slim face framed by twin curtains of dark hair and speaks in a soft, helpful voice, like that of an expensive therapist, laughed until her face turned pink.&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;a data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a27607&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a27607&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;Jeremy O.

Like Harris, Leifheit went to Yale for graduate school and is the entrepreneurial, self-sustaining center of his own career. He edits the magazine &lt;em>;MATTE&lt;/em>;, makes photo books, and teaches workshops across the country. They met because of Harris&#39;s insistence, in New Haven, on spreading his presence far beyond the confines of the drama school: he was known to drop in on photography critique sessions and to speak up, offering references and suggestions. “A lot of people thought he was part of the photo program,” John Pilson, one of the program&#39;s longest-serving faculty members, said. “By the end, we all expected to see him every week.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Harris had arrived at Yale in 2016. Several of his classmates were far beyond him professionally: they&#39;d had shows produced, they had agents. He was eager to catch up, but soon found himself at odds with the institution. The curriculum was too conservative for his taste; he felt that his instructors were dismissive of his interest in more experimental work. He started taking classes in Black studies and poetry. He also began work on “Slave Play,” which he says “poured out” of him almost whole. He was assigned a faculty adviser, the acclaimed playwright and director &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/11/03/real-gone-girl&quot;>;Young Jean Lee&lt;/a>;, who would help shepherd a student production.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Lee is a longtime downtown experimentalist, and many of her work&#39;s subjects—race, class, the body—are also crucial to Harris; he was excited to work with her. But she had extensive notes on “Slave Play,” which Harris mostly declined to take. She objected strongly to the final act, set in the bedroom of a Black woman named Kaneisha and her white British husband, Jim. Their therapy has been a disaster, largely because of Jim&#39;s refusal to go along with goofily degrading role-play. Kaneisha calls Jim a “virus,” and connects their relationship to the brutalities of the past; Jim gets back into character, as a slave master, and gives Kaneisha the abasement she seems to have been asking for.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;This sequence, the most hotly debated part of “Slave Play,” stayed in the show, even after the move to Broadway. When Lee saw it in a dress rehearsal, she was horrified; later, she told Harris that it took her more than an hour to calm down enough to give him feedback. The two then exchanged lengthy text messages. “I hope that no one has ever spoken that violently to you about work that so deeply intersects with your being, and if they have I&#39;m sorry,” Harris wrote. Lee replied, “If you&#39;re that irresponsible about putting a rape of a female body onstage, I&#39;m going to call you out on it in no uncertain terms. To turn it around and call me the violent one is a classic move that has been done to me many times, and I&#39;ve never fallen for it, and I&#39;m not falling for it now.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Their dispute culminated in a formal complaint process, presided over by Tarell Alvin McCraney, who leads the drama school&#39;s playwriting program. Harris used transcripts from those meetings in “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.nplusonemag.com/issue-38/fiction-drama/yell-a-documentary-of-my-time-here/&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.nplusonemag.com/issue-38/fiction-drama/yell-a-documentary-of-my-time-here/&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nplusonemag.com/issue-38/fiction-drama/yell-a-documentary-of-my-time-here/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;Yell: A &#39;Documentary&#39; of My Time Here&lt;/a>;,” his senior thesis play. I went to see it, in New Haven, in 2019. By then, Harris had already staged “Slave Play” and “Daddy” Off Broadway, but he still had something to prove to his teachers. The most constant formal structure in “Yell” is repeated acts of onstage defecation. Fake shit was everywhere at Yale&#39;s Iseman Theatre that day.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;frvuov&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Harris has said that “Yell” was inspired by the radical 1967 essay “The Student as Nigger,” by Jerry Farber, which compares the relationship between American students and their professors to that of slaves and masters. In June, 2020, at the height of the George Floyd protests, Harris shared “Yell” online, and wrote a long accompanying Twitter &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://twitter.com/jeremyoharris/status/1270447515570233350&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://twitter.com/jeremyoharris/status/1270447515570233350&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jeremyoharris/status/1270447515570233350&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;thread&lt;/a>; in which he posted screenshots of his text exchange with Lee, who declined to comment for this story. “EVERY DAY THEY TREATED ME LIKE A NIGGA THAT NEEDED TO BE TAMED AND IT MADE ME FEEL CRAZY,” he wrote.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In September, 2021, Harris sat in a chair in a bathroom at a ritzy hotel in New York. The Tonys were finally being awarded that night, and he&#39;d booked a suite nearby, where he could get ready. Also in the bathroom were his hairdresser, Latisha Chong, and a woman tending to his makeup and nails. He sat stock-still, never wincing as Chong pulled through his Afro and started to braid. The three of them, mutually devoted to the task of flashy beauty, calmly chatted about people they knew in common.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Everybody who knows him thinks he&#39;s gay,” Harris said. “But, I&#39;m telling you, he&#39;s straight.” Both women disbelievingly harrumphed. “Bone straight,” he said.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;The bathroom was a center of calm in the otherwise hectic suite. Harris occasionally got up to take a Polaroid of the room—an editor at &lt;em>;Vogue&lt;/em>; had commissioned him to keep a photo diary. Also milling around were two camerapeople shooting footage for a “Slave Play” documentary that Harris had promised to deliver to HBO. They swanned around the room, sometimes going out on the balcony to capture views of downtown and the West Side. Beyond and between the buildings, you could see the Hudson quietly snaking along.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Harris&#39;s assistant kept running out of the room, collecting bouquets of flowers and other gifts that were arriving in a steady stream. Harris had recently interviewed the young gay rapper Lil Nas X for a &lt;em>;GQ&lt;/em>; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gq.com/story/lil-nas-x-musician-of-the-year-2021&quot;>;profile&lt;/a>;. “Montero—he&#39;s brilliant,” he said, using the rapper&#39;s given name. “The interview felt kind of like a first date.” He asked his assistant to put on a song from Lil Nas X&#39;s new album, a catchy single called “Industry Baby.” “This one is gonna be huge,” Harris said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Friends continually appeared, at his invitation. His mother and niece were getting their makeup done in a neighboring room. Candace Owen-Williams, his old teacher, was there, too, in a sparkly gown. Harris pointed her out to each new arrival and repeated the story of how she made him feel less alone at school.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;This is how Harris relaxes—sitting somewhere near the center of a crowd that he&#39;s convened. Antwaun Sargent, an art critic and a gallerist with Gagosian, walked over to the ledge where Harris&#39;s gold accessories, custom-made for him by the haute-couture house Schiaparelli, sat gleaming. There were chunky rings and cufflinks, a necklace with a pendant made from a cast of Harris&#39;s ear, a “Phantom of the Opera”-style mask modelled after a swooping section of his face.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;As the sun began to set and the light in the room darkened, Harris asked everyone to leave so that he could ready himself for the show. That night, in a surprise to prognosticators, “Slave Play” was completely shut out—twelve nominations, nothing to bring home. The next day, the online edition of Page Six carried the headline “Jeremy O. Harris celebrates Tony snubs with two afterparties.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Early last year, Harris tweeted a casual swipe at the state of television. “I write tv for people who have an intellect for theatre since tv is hollow,” he wrote. “Bc the funny thing is the reason so many filmmakers and theatre makers were asked to make television is bc the medium hit a wall. That&#39;s why almost all the best tv, of late, has been made by exciting practitioners of other forms.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Stung TV writers and irritated critics noted that Harris now made much of his living from television, and not always in its most rarefied corners. In 2021, he&#39;d done a cameo, as himself, on the reboot of “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2008/03/10/advanced-placement&quot;>;Gossip Girl&lt;/a>;.” (The script called for a play within the show, which Harris wrote; later, he got it commissioned by the Public Theatre.) Then he was cast, as a fashion designer, in the second season of “Emily in Paris,” Darren Starr&#39;s critically maligned Netflix series about an American influencer who gets a job in France. The show&#39;s producers told Harris that they were looking for someone reminiscent of a young André Leon Talley.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Sharper observers of Harris&#39;s commentary noticed that he was playing a familiar role. “I support Jeremy O Harris being snotty about TV,” the &lt;em>;Times&lt;/em>; critic Jason Zinoman wrote. “Playwrights used to be like this all the time. It&#39;s a glorious tradition.” The path from New York theatre to a career in Hollywood—where the money and the weather are better, and the audiences are bigger—has been traversed by writers for almost a century. And Harris seemed to be giving television a dose of his usual medicine: let me in and I&#39;ll give you a piece of my mind.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;But on his winding path to playwriting, Harris had made the kinds of friends you would make if you were aiming for the screen all along. When Harris was still at Yale, Sam Levinson made him a consultant for his notoriously lurid HBO teen drama “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/on-television/the-addictive-chills-and-thrills-of-euphoria&quot;>;Euphoria&lt;/a>;.” (Harris is now a producer on the series.) Janicza Bravo got Harris hired as the co-writer for her movie “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-front-row/zola-reviewed-a-twitter-thread-takes-an-ingenious-and-audacious-cinematic-form&quot;>;Zola&lt;/a>;,” adapted from a riotous series of tweets.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;His steadiest Hollywood employment came in the form of the HBO deal that he signed in 2020. The following year, the network announced that he would adapt the novel “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Vanishing-Half-Novel-Brit-Bennett/dp/0525536965&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Vanishing-Half-Novel-Brit-Bennett/dp/0525536965&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Vanishing-Half-Novel-Brit-Bennett/dp/0525536965&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;The Vanishing Half&lt;/a>;,” by Brit Bennett, along with the playwright Aziza Barnes, a friend of his. The novel tells the story of twin sisters whose fates diverge: one dissolves into the American mainstream, passing as white; the other anchors herself in Black community. Harris and Barnes assembled a writers&#39; room to produce a pilot and a “show bible,” outlining the plot of the first season. They led the writers on a research trip to New Orleans, where much of “The Vanishing Half” is set. As the weeks passed, Harris was often airborne, travelling to fashion gigs, conducting interviews for magazines. When he signed the HBO deal, he&#39;d insisted that his contract contain an annual fund for supporting theatre, and he&#39;d used some of that money to create a fellowship for emerging writers. He was always &lt;em>;working&lt;/em>;. He just wasn&#39;t always writing.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Then, the following June, the Daily Beast &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thedailybeast.com/jeremy-o-harris-let-go-from-hbos-the-vanishing-half&quot;>;reported&lt;/a>; that Harris and Barnes were no longer working on the show. The article cited two sources who claimed that Harris “was let go after having trouble meeting script deadlines.” HBO insisted that he had not been fired. There had simply been creative differences, which were “part of the normal development process.” Harris, HBO added, “is a valued collaborator, and we currently have other projects in development with him.” (He is no longer on an exclusive deal with HBO but continues to work with the network.)&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I visited Harris, at his apartment, a couple of weeks later. It was a bright July day, hot in the sun but buoyed by a breeze. He answered the door wearing a long green terry-cloth robe, with dark polish on his fingernails. His young nephew had been wanting to paint his nails and was getting grief about it in his Southern milieu, Harris said, so he had painted his in solidarity. “Sometimes I think people don&#39;t want him to be a &#39;punk&#39; like Uncle Jeremy,” he said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The Daily Beast hadn&#39;t reported any details about Harris&#39;s approach to the “Vanishing Half” adaptation, but I had heard, from several friends, about a proposed scene in which a lot of feces is flung around. It sounded preposterous but not entirely unlikely. Harris, in his work, likes to explain drastic external action by way of uncomfortable, abject, and often lewd interior depths. His characters earn their brief glories after trudging through lots of shame; his people get splattered.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Harris seemed surprised that I&#39;d heard about the scene in such detail, but was happy to discuss it. He loved Bennett&#39;s book, but wanted to interpret it freely, even radically, something TV writers don&#39;t do enough, he said. One addition he and the writers envisioned was a surrealistic quasi-dream sequence that would send a character&#39;s consciousness “skipping like a stone across the waters of time,” as Harris put it in the show bible. The character would witness a “depraved ritual” meant to cleanse a small town of its communal sins, and the dark bacchanal would include “blackface masks, buffoonery and flying mud and feces.” It would end with “infidelities, thefts and dark family secrets ushered from the shadows into the light.”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;fcy98w&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Harris was less annoyed by people gossiping about his work than by the suggestion, in the Daily Beast and elsewhere, that he wasn&#39;t a hard worker. “I&#39;m actually really insecure about that,” he said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;He was about to go abroad, and he wanted a new swimsuit for the summer trip; he&#39;d asked Emily Bode to design one for him. We walked to her small tailoring shop in Chinatown, where a board high up on a brownish wall announced the prices for alterations. Half-done garments hung on faceless mannequins.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;A tailor silently took Harris&#39;s measurements, then gave him the swimsuit that Bode had left for him to try on: a lime-green one-piece with thin tank-top straps and tight shorts. He had seemed sedate and almost tired in the apartment, but now his mood lifted. He retreated behind a curtain, then came out wearing the suit, hugging his thin body. It fit. He looked into a mirror and spread his arms. He was already smiling.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;One night last October, Harris went to the Brooklyn Academy of Music to see the renowned Belgian theatre director Ivo van Hove&#39;s adaptation of the novel “A Little Life,” by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/01/17/hanya-yanagiharas-audience-of-one&quot;>;Hanya Yanagihara&lt;/a>;. Harris is friendly with Yanagihara—he&#39;d spoken with her about acting in a possible TV adaptation of the book. He attended the play with an old roommate from his Yale days, Michael Breslin, who co-founded the theatre collective Fake Friends. Harris has co-produced two of the collective&#39;s shows: “Circle Jerk,” a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize for drama, and “This American Wife,” a harrowing parody of Bravo&#39;s “Real Housewives” franchise.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“A Little Life” centers on a group of friends in New York, one of whom, a saintly character named Jude, is repeatedly flayed by acts of unspeakable violence. Like “Slave Play,” the novel was dogged by accusations of sadism. After the show, Harris, who has cited the Marquis de Sade as a formative influence, chatted with his friends. They all agreed that some of the show&#39;s most excruciating scenes, which had provoked gasps in the audience, could have been, in keeping with the book, a bit more graphic.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Harris took a car home, stopping for a drink at a bar near his apartment. Writers—a species always overrunning those blocks, which have come to be called Dimes Square—spilled out of restaurants and sidewalk sheds. For a few minutes, cradling his drink, Harris argued amiably with a pop-music critic about the recently released movie “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-front-row/tar-reviewed-regressive-ideas-to-match-regressive-aesthetics&quot;>;Tár&lt;/a>;,” which Harris hated.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Back at his apartment, he ate and paced and talked—softly, because a friend, one in a rotating series of medium-term guests, was sleeping in the next room. Soon, Khosravi came home. Like Harris, he is tall and slender and demonstrative; subtle streaks of gray run through the ringlets of his hair. Unlike Harris, he seldom seems excited to argue. Before Khosravi, Harris had a boyfriend who broke up with him in part, Harris says, because of his sudden fame. “Arvand doesn&#39;t mind that I&#39;m a star,” he once told me.&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;a data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a24982&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a24982&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;“Take care out there today hon.

They were flying in the morning to a gala in Bentonville, Arkansas, at the Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art. Harris didn&#39;t seem stressed.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The next day, at the museum, as Harris wandered a room with paintings by Kehinde Wiley, Amy Sherald, and Kerry James Marshall, Khosravi surprised him by getting on one knee and proposing marriage. He&#39;d had a ring designed by a pair of jewellers who lived across the street from them in London and had become their friends. And he&#39;d asked the playwright &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/02/12/adrienne-kennedys-startling-body-of-work&quot;>;Adrienne Kennedy&lt;/a>;—a hero of Harris&#39;s, and now a frequent e-mail correspondent of his—to write a benediction, to be etched on the inside. It reads, “Happiness.是。大部头书。 Greatest Thing.” Harris said yes.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;A day later, he giddily recounted the proposal on Twitter, adding a pinch of social critique. “But someone, I guess I will?, needs to write about how cringe it is to be proposed to when you haven&#39;t been socialized to be waiting for it,” he wrote. “It&#39;s a really violent trap we set for both parties where you&#39;re asked to be in a play you know the script to and if you deviate from it 💔.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Harris&#39;s doomsaying in 2020—his sense that the gatekeepers were not doing enough to reimagine and thus preserve the world of theatre—has arguably been validated, in the worst way, in the three years since then. A wave of closures and layoffs has prompted a rash of op-eds about the future of the medium. Harris, as contrarian as ever, is not abandoning the theatre but, rather, becoming something of a gatekeeper himself: he has lately been, almost above all else, a facilitator of other people&#39;s work.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;He is currently the presiding playwright for the Yale Drama Series, a role that involves judging the program&#39;s annual prize. After he took the position, last year, he began conceiving a writers&#39; retreat for some of the prize&#39;s finalists—inspired, in part, by his experience at MacDowell. In March, he announced the inaugural Substratum fellows: four young playwrights who would spend a month at a medieval house, part of the hotel Monteverdi Tuscany, which, along with Gucci, would help cover the expenses.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;He was in Italy with the fellows when he got a text from the actress Rachel Brosnahan, who, along with Oscar Isaac, was starring in a revival of Lorraine Hansberry&#39;s 1964 play “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/03/13/sign-in-sidney-brusteins-window-theatre-review&quot;>;The Sign in Sidney Brustein&#39;s Window&lt;/a>;,” at &lt;em >;BAM&lt;/em>;. She hoped he&#39;d come see it. He said he was abroad, and asked if the play might be extended or transferred; she didn&#39;t think so. “I&#39;m going to get you to Broadway,” he replied. He phoned producer friends, and together they engineered a brief transfer to the James Earl Jones Theatre—another play set to open there had seen its financing collapse. The Hansberry revival wouldn&#39;t run long enough to turn a profit, but it would get a wider audience for a work by another of Harris&#39;s playwriting heroes. And the quick transfer suggested a different approach, perhaps, for Broadway: If space opens up, why not take a few chances?&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In August, Harris went to the Berkshires to spend two weeks acting in a movie directed by Pete Ohs, who edited the “Slave Play” documentary. Ohs makes largely improvised movies for twenty thousand dollars or less; the tiny budget meant that he could shoot without breaking the rules of the Writers Guild of America strike, which had begun in the spring and showed no signs of ending. The film was a country-house nightmare about contracting disease from deer ticks.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;The cast was staying at the house, which belonged to the actress Callie Hernandez, one of Ohs&#39;s collaborators. In the brightness of the afternoon, a wall of trees outside was variously green: dark pine, mild maple, vivid oak. Inside, James Cusati-Moyer, who was in “Slave Play”—his character, a gay man, refuses to describe himself as white—stood at the kitchen counter, mixing flaxseed, honey, psyllium husk, and cranberries in a steel bowl. He was making gluten-free bread, from a TikTok recipe. “You want a kind of cakey texture,” he said. “The woman in the video is incredibly annoying, but the bread is great.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The movie would begin shooting that night. Harris changed into a white linen caftan and went into town for groceries—he&#39;d volunteered to make dinner, for the second day in a row. He drives with a country boy&#39;s ease; he learned at fourteen, when his mother realized how impossible it would be for her to chauffeur him to all of his activities. He&#39;d already acclimated somewhat to the roads of the Berkshires and to the local lore. “Birthplace of WEB DuBois,” he said. “They can&#39;t shut up about it—he&#39;s, like, the only Black guy they know.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Loping through the aisles at the grocery store, he picked up ears of corn with stringy husks and a pack of what he called “white-people aluminum foil,” packaged in a recyclable-looking brown paper box. He&#39;d begun writing a novel about a Black writer beset by deadlines and grief. Harris was very close with his mother&#39;s parents, who have both died in the past few years—his grandfather, Golden, died two weeks before “Slave Play” débuted on Broadway. “Writing isn&#39;t fun,” he said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;At lunch, in a small bakery across the street from a general store, he told me that his cash flow was slowing down as a result of the strike. “The other day, my niece asked me for a new phone, and I had to say no,” he said. “I told her, &#39;I&#39;m not trying to be mean—I&#39;m broke.&#39; ” He pays private-school tuition for her and his nephew; he bought a home, in Virginia, for his mom. He was worried about falling behind on payments.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;tls7&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Back at the house, he enlisted his castmates as sous-chefs—chopping herbs, buttering corn—and began to cook. People were trying on clothes and critiquing the outfits. Would this work for the character? What else did it need? Cusati-Moyer was in a loose crop top. Harris loved it.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“I feel bloated from the bread,” Cusati-Moyer said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“You are,” Harris said, grinning.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“This is what he was like,” Cusati-Moyer told the others. “He builds you up and then he breaks you back down!”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Harris called his mom to ask her advice on the meal—pork chops, roasted corn, fried apples, all callbacks to his childhood. Should he melt the butter, put the apples in the cast iron, and &lt;em>;then&lt;/em>; pour the sugar in?&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“I don&#39;t know if you know this,” he told her, “but there&#39;s a white way to make this, where you don&#39;t just pour sugar.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Yeah, well, we make it the Black way,” his mom said. They talked about Harris&#39;s niece, and about the patterns his mom had begun to notice in her romantic life, and about literature. They sounded like siblings who take turns being in control.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;She said that she wanted to write a book about her life. “The best way to write is to read really good things,” Harris said. “You have to read this book by a French woman named &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/11/21/annie-ernaux-turns-memory-into-art&quot;>;Annie Ernaux&lt;/a>;. &#39;Happening.&#39; You&#39;ll really like it.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;He sat in the kitchen, with food in the oven and on the stove, steeling himself quietly for work later on, chatting with his mother. For a moment, his life seemed almost normal. ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;

>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;麦克默特里的小说很好地转化为电影，场景的扫荡有助于消除故事的愤世嫉俗。他的第一部小说《骑士，路过》后来变成了《Hud》，由冷酷无情、闷闷不乐的保罗·纽曼主演。根据多尔蒂的说法，《最后一场电影》精装本刚印刷就卖出了 900 份，但彼得·博格丹诺维奇 1971 年的电影立即引起轰动，赢得了两项奥斯卡奖。 （强奸小母牛的场景没有出现在电影中。）麦克默特里的家乡已经对他保持警惕，丑闻缠身的《最后一场电影秀》的拍摄并没有提高他在当地的声誉。 （博格丹诺维奇与妻子兼合作者波莉·普拉特的婚姻在他与二十岁的电影明星西比尔·谢泼德在片场发生恋情后破裂。）《阿切尔县新闻》刊登了一封愤怒的信关于“我们强加给这个国家年轻人的道德和态度的进一步退化和腐化”；根据多尔蒂的说法，麦克默特里对此类袭击感到愤怒，他的回应是向他的同胞发起挑战，要求他们就该镇的真实本质进行公开辩论。大约在那个时候，他认为德克萨斯州和德克萨斯州写作的未来是城市的，他继续写了一套以研究生为主角的小说，有趣但参差不齐的书，从闹剧到悲情。麦克默特里特别擅长捕捉休斯顿的魅力——热气腾腾、潮湿、暴力、有趣。&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;当多尔蒂告诉艺术评论家戴夫·希基他正在写一本关于麦克默特里的书时，希基回答说：“了解拉里，这将是一本真正的情景书。”麦克默特里是一位狂热的公路旅行爱好者，他像收集书籍一样收集朋友，多尔蒂的传记中充满了有趣的客串：麦克默特里接待了凯西的巴士，里面满是昏昏欲睡的快乐恶作剧者，与苏珊·桑塔格一起吃鱼子酱，与黛安·基顿一起去跳蚤市场购物，并出席罗纳德·里根为查尔斯王子和戴安娜王妃举办的国宴。但这些轶事，其中许多取自麦克默特里自己写的关于他的生活的文章，可能会让人感觉像是一个盾牌。在整部传记中，对麦克默特里的更深层次的认识仍然难以捉摸。他给人的印象是一个很难深入了解的人。 （在作家乔治·格肖（George Getschow）编辑的《空页的牧场：拉里·麦克默特里的生活和遗产的作家们》中，接近和接触麦克默特里的困难是一个反复出现的主题。）&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;麦克默特里他经常因其创作女性角色的技巧而受到称赞，这似乎可以归结为一个简单的事实：他发现女性很有趣，而不仅仅是她们与男性的关系。在麦克默特里的书中，那些没有得到自己想要的东西的人物往往拥有最丰富的内心。他笔下的女性角色不太能够强迫环境符合她们的自我，她们往往能更清晰地看待世界。在《母女情深》中，男人要么平淡无奇，要么滑稽可笑。小说更感兴趣的是一群女性之间的关系：艾玛·霍顿，一位有着未实现的文学抱负的年轻母亲；她的朋友帕齐；她令人烦恼、魅力十足的母亲奥罗拉；还有奥罗拉（Aurora）受骗的管家罗西（Rosie）。艾玛生命垂危时，奥罗拉和帕西围着她的病床讨论她孩子们的未来。艾玛的丈夫弗莱普“也在那里”，但“他不相关。”&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot;

data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;尽管麦克默特里对这些角色有着明显的感情，但他们的追求却普遍存在一种酸涩的感觉。在小说的第一个主要场景中，剧组人员在夜间袭击格兰德河，进入墨西哥，偷走一群马匹，以便踏上向北的旅程。 “显然，如果你过河去做这件事，它就不再是犯罪，而是变成了游戏，”一名十几岁的学徒了解到；经验丰富的人会认为抢劫是理所当然的。这一最初的犯罪行为与贯穿整部小说的更可耻、更严重的盗窃行为相呼应：白人定居者侵占大平原并试图消灭其土著居民。小说中充斥着这些行为的后果：一小群饥饿的美洲原住民为了食物而宰杀马匹；一位留着肮脏胡须的老人推着一辆装满水牛骨头的独轮车穿过高原。从地面上看，赶牛是令人兴奋的，但从更远的距离看，它是毁灭性的。小说中的浪漫愤世嫉俗者麦克雷时不时地揭露所有情节英雄主义的目的：“这就是我们所做的，你知道。给现代印第安人穿短裙，这样他们就不会打扰银行家了。”麦克默特里深知养牛业扩张所造成的生态破坏，也深知养牛业自身也埋下了崩溃的种子。过度放牧导致牧场退化，豆科灌木和杂酚油灌木丛挤占了原生草丛。 “孤独的鸽子”事件发生后仅仅几代人，麦克默特里的父亲卷入了一场无休止、徒劳的战争，目的是从他的牧场上根除豆科灌木。 “我们杀死了正确的动物——水牛，却引入了错误的动物——湿地牛。但它并没有奏效。”麦克默特里在 2010 年说道。&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;《孤独的鸽子》是一本非常矛盾的书，但令麦克默特里懊恼的是，它并不总是得到这样的认可。该剧于 1989 年改编成广受欢迎的迷你剧，由罗伯特·杜瓦尔和汤米·李·琼斯饰演麦克雷和考尔，进一步确立了前流浪者队的感伤英雄形象。麦克默特里开始将他最受欢迎的书与《乱世佳人》进行比较。他的意思并不是恭维。尽管如此，他还是继续写了续集和前传，创造了一个扩展的宇宙，总体上来说，比原作更死记硬背，也不那么复杂。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;尽管他对《孤独的鸽子》有着复杂的感情，麦克默特里很感激这本书和其他项目给他带来的回报。 “电影钱就是我喜欢花的那种虚幻的钱，”他曾经写信给他的经纪人。在公路旅行中，他开着租来的凯迪拉克汽车，通过联邦快递将脏衣服寄回家；他成为曼哈顿市中心鱼子酱店 Petrossian 的常客，以至于餐厅在他最喜欢的餐桌上安装了一块刻有他名字的黄铜牌匾。但他最大的嗜好就是书籍。随着全国各地的独立书店关闭，麦克默特里买下了他们的股票并将其转移到阿彻城，在那里他正忙着将市中心的建筑物改造成书店。麦克默特里写道：“在阿切尔城留下大约一百万人，对于该地区乃至西部来说都是我所能想到的最好的遗产。”这个小镇在经历了一次重大的石油危机后，终于准备好拥抱它任性的儿子了。前往阿彻城的游客现在可以入住孤独鸽子旅馆 (Lonesome Dove Inn)，并前往乳品皇后 (Dairy Queen) 的麦克默特里 (McMurtry) 小神社表达敬意。当桑塔格来拜访时，她告诉麦克默特里，他似乎生活在自己的主题公园里。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;多尔蒂书的最后三分之一读起来很黯淡。麦克默特里于 1991 年心脏病发作，四重搭桥手术让他感觉“很大程度上是死后的”，用他的话来说，这种情况他似乎从未完全康复。在此期间，他最亲密的合作伙伴是图森律师助理戴安娜·奥萨纳 (Diana Ossana)。多尔蒂始终无法解释他们关系的本质——她是他的女朋友、他的朋友、他的写作伙伴、他的经理，还是这四者的某种组合？无论他们的动态如何，奥萨纳都是重要的支持来源。在手术后最糟糕的时期，也就是麦克默特里患有抑郁症的时期，他和她住在一起。有一段时间，他仍然把写作当作农活，每周 7 天早上第一件事就是处理这些事情，从不间断。但1993年《拉雷多的街道》出版后，他就停了下来。奥萨娜最终把他哄回打字机前，很快她就开始编辑，有时甚至重写他的作品。 2011年，经过六周的求爱后，麦克默特里与肯的遗孀费耶·凯西结婚。这对夫妇和奥萨纳住在一起，这种安排显然很适合每个人。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;2006 年，麦克默特里和奥萨纳因改编安妮·普鲁克斯的《断背山》而获得金球奖最佳剧本奖；麦克默特里在获奖感言中感谢了他的打字机。在奥斯卡颁奖典礼上，他穿着蓝色牛仔裤和靴子，感谢“世界上所有的书商”。但阿彻城从未成为他所希望的文学目的地，他的书店 Booked Up 也陷入了财务困境。 2012年，麦克默特里拍卖了数十万本书。 “这是他的梦想，将阿切尔城变成一座图书小镇，”麦克默特里的朋友格绍当时说道。 “现在这是梦想的终结。没有办法解决这个问题。”麦克默特里毕竟遵循了家族传统，将自己投身于一个垂死的行业，并在这个过程中心碎。他去世后，德克萨斯州立法机构通过了一项纪念他的决议；两年后，一位州代表表示，学校“可能需要禁止《孤独的鸽子》”，因为它过于露骨。&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>; &lt;p>;麦克默特里看起来像是来自另一个时代的人物。他在文学经济中长大，这使得他的职业生涯得以缓慢发展。在《孤独的鸽子》取得突破性成功之前，他用一贯的轻描淡写的方式将自己描述为“中产阶级作家”和“小区域小说家”。 （一位朋友曾将这句话印在他的一件 T 恤上。）他写到的德克萨斯州以白人为主，有着农业根源，并且专注于其拓荒者的过去。麦克默特里时而反抗、时而拥抱的那种对国家有着如此重大影响的版本，现在已经不再那么重要了——德克萨斯州还有很多其他的故事可以讲述。 （要了解这部欢乐的十九世纪史诗的另一种方式，请尝试卡门·布洛萨（Carmen Boullosa）的《德克萨斯：大盗窃》。）&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;去年，&lt;em>;阿切尔县新闻&lt;/em>;报道称，Booked Up 被另一位得克萨斯州名人收购：奇普·盖恩斯 (Chip Gaines)，他是《Fixer Upper》的联合主演，在电视剧中衣着邋遢，这档家居装修节目因传播“农舍时尚”美学而受到赞誉（或指责）。盖恩斯小时候在阿彻城度过了夏天，他说他和妻子浏览了麦克默特里的藏书，并着眼于精美的装订，挑选了一些书籍在他们今年在韦科开设的一家新酒店中展示。落下;其他人的命运尚不清楚，但这对夫妇表示，他们计划将大部分捐赠回阿彻城。盖恩斯告诉我，他对麦克默特里晚年回到德克萨斯州小镇的经历很认同。 “他选择回到自己的根源，回到简单的起点，”他说。 “我只是希望我能让他感到骄傲。” ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;80bl2j&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot;

Giroux)&lt;/em>;. This metafictional historical novel centers on the recollections of an eighteenth-century French botanist, whose voyage to Senegal is irrevocably altered by his fascination with a young woman who has escaped from a slave ship. His account—gleaned from notebooks discovered by his daughter—begins as a travelogue and then transforms into a record of the escapee&#39;s ordeal, which she recounts to the botanist in the course of one long night: a mesmerizing tale of capture, getaway, and revenge. Diop&#39;s novel, which culminates in a terrifying sequence of events, is a testament to fiction&#39;s ability to uncover our self-deceptions, leaving them “as if exposed to the African sun at its zenith.”&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;I&amp;#x27;ma Fan by Sheena Patel.&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64ff7aa16f174aef5e392efc/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/230925_r42984web.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64ff7aa16f174aef5e392efc/master/w_120,c_limit/230925_r42984web.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64ff7aa16f174aef5e392efc/master/w_240,c_limit/230925_r42984web.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64ff7aa16f174aef5e392efc/master/w_320,c_limit/230925_r42984web.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64ff7aa16f174aef5e392efc/master/w_640,c_limit/230925_r42984web.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64ff7aa16f174aef5e392efc/master/w_960,c_limit/230925_r42984web.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64ff7aa16f174aef5e392efc/master/w_1280,c_limit/230925_r42984web.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64ff7aa16f174aef5e392efc/master/w_1600,c_limit/230925_r42984web.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;p >;&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Im-Fan-Novel-Sheena-Patel/dp/1644452456&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Im-Fan-Novel-Sheena-Patel/dp/1644452456&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Im-Fan-Novel-Sheena-Patel/dp/1644452456&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;&lt;strong>;I&#39;m a Fan&lt;/strong>;&lt;/a>;&lt;em>;, by Sheena Patel (Graywolf)&lt;/em>;. The corrosive logic of one-sided relationships is the subject of this dryly funny polemical novel, told from the perspective of a young woman obsessed with her married lover and his ex-girlfriend. The narrator provokes the lover in various ways, in the hope that he&#39;ll end his other love affairs, despite her being aware of her delusion. Surveilling the ex-girlfriend on Instagram, the narrator reacts to the woman&#39;s expensive purchases, which she broadcasts to a sizable following, with a mixture of loathing and desire. This woman “lives with real life art that I can&#39;t afford and wouldn&#39;t know how to get,” she thinks, “and I put posters up with Blu Tack like I&#39;m still fifteen years old.

In this triple biography, the dynamics of Renaissance Europe are illustrated through the lives and the politically motivated marriages of Catherine de&#39; Medici, Elisabeth de Valois, and Mary, Queen of Scots. Catherine, who married into the French royal family, leveraged her maternal qualities to win the right to govern on behalf of her young sons. Her daughter Elisabeth married Philip II of Spain to seal an unsteady peace between their two countries. Mary&#39;s strongest loyalty was to her French relatives—leading her to underestimate a dissatisfied Scottish nobility. In an era of empire-hungry monarchs and religious violence, these women, while fulfilling their obligations as wives and mothers, forged diplomatic connections through family ties.&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;Anansi&amp;#x27;s Gold by Yepoka Yeebo.&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64ff7a8cfbe5b1290e51cef0/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/230925_r42986web.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64ff7a8cfbe5b1290e51cef0/master/w_120,c_limit/230925_r42986web.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64ff7a8cfbe5b1290e51cef0/master/w_240,c_limit/230925_r42986web.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64ff7a8cfbe5b1290e51cef0/master/w_320,c_limit/230925_r42986web.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64ff7a8cfbe5b1290e51cef0/master/w_640,c_limit/230925_r42986web.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64ff7a8cfbe5b1290e51cef0/master/w_960,c_limit/230925_r42986web.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64ff7a8cfbe5b1290e51cef0/master/w_1280,c_limit/230925_r42986web.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64ff7a8cfbe5b1290e51cef0/master/w_1600,c_limit/230925_r42986web.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;p >;&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Anansis-Gold-Outfoxed-Washington-Swindled/dp/1635574730&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Anansis-Gold-Outfoxed-Washington-Swindled/dp/1635574730&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Anansis-Gold-Outfoxed-Washington-Swindled/dp/1635574730&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Anansi&#39;s Gold&lt;/strong>;&lt;/a>;&lt;em>;, by Yepoka Yeebo (Bloomsbury)&lt;/em>;. For two decades, beginning in the late nineteen-sixties, a Ghanaian man named John Ackah Blay-Miezah carried out an astonishingly successful scam by pretending to have inherited billions of dollars from Kwame Nkrumah, Ghana&#39;s first President. Though the inheritance was a fiction, propped up by forged documents and opportunistic coöperators looking to capitalize on political instability, Blay-Miezah swindled his marks out of millions by convincing them that he needed money to access the fund, and used his newfound wealth to become one of the country&#39;s most powerful people. Yeebo, a journalist, skillfully interweaves archival material, FBI records, and interviews to recount the saga of the con man&#39;s career, and to reflect on how lies can be leveraged in the creation of national histories.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;yxf0pk&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 18 Sep 2023 19:06:01 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Jeremy O.

Harris was living in a two-story apartment in London. He had travelled there for a production of his play “Daddy,” about a young Black artist who has fallen under the thrall of an older white man. “Daddy” had débuted, Off Broadway, a year before, and was set to open at the Almeida Theatre at the end of March, 2020; it would have been Harris&#39;s first professional opening overseas. But the show didn&#39;t open, and Harris stayed stranded in London for weeks, then, eventually, for months.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Sad about the play and scared about the world, he passed the first few weeks not writing—although many deadlines, constant companions in his life, hovered at the peripheries of his mind. Since high school, Harris has used the late night and earliest morning as a time to work and party and talk about art with friends; now he binged anime and listened to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/03/23/fiona-apples-art-of-radical-sensitivity&quot;>;Fiona Apple&lt;/a>; and started reading Audre Lorde&#39;s “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Sister-Outsider-Speeches-Crossing-Feminist/dp/1580911862/&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Sister-Outsider-Speeches-Crossing-Feminist/dp/1580911862/&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Sister-Outsider-Speeches-Crossing-Feminist/dp/1580911862/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;Sister Outsider&lt;/a>;,” which he&#39;d always meant to get to. As the weeks wore on, he tired of his vampirism. “I decided that I wanted to see the sun more often,” he said one April morning, as streams of light made bright rectangles on the apartment walls. Waking up at normal hours meant dealing with pedestrian annoyances. He&#39;d begun ordering coffee from a nearby café, and twice in a row, although he ordered it black, it was delivered with milk. “It&#39;s, like, everyone&#39;s watching &#39;The Plot Against America,&#39; ” he said, referring to the HBO miniseries based on the novel by Philip Roth, “and this feels very much like &#39;The Plot Against Jeremy.&#39; ”&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Harris is very tall and very thin, and handles his body with improvised precision, formality within informality, like a dancer on an off day at the mall. A gesture begun in his shoulder always ends at the tips of his fingers. When he gropes for thoughts between sentences, he makes shapes in the air with his hands. He has clear cedar skin and a pert, wide mouth. His eyes are sedate and low-lidded when he&#39;s in a neutral mood, but they open wide when he tells a story or expresses an urgent (often dissenting) opinion. Stories sometimes incite him to stand up and pantomime crucial passages of action. His first dream, before writing, was to act.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;When the third coffee came, finally correct, he sat on a couch by a window and lit a cigarette. Lots of people he knew were smoking again, he said, despite the worldwide march of a deadly respiratory disease: “Our lungs could fail us at any moment, and we&#39;re just, like, you know, fuck it.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Coffee and an American Spirit, white light through the window—his instinct about waking with the sun had been borne out. The apartment was pleasant in the daytime. On one wall was a large abstract painting in russets and burgundies and bright lipstick shades. Upstairs was a bedroom that he shared with his newish boyfriend, Arvand Khosravi, a film and television executive. At the top of the staircase was a glass door leading out to a shallow ledge on the roof, where Harris often went to film TikTok videos—mostly poppy, fast-paced riffs on scenes from classic plays—which he had been posting almost daily. In one, titled “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://twitter.com/jeremyoharris/status/1246604978346754049&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://twitter.com/jeremyoharris/status/1246604978346754049&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jeremyoharris/status/1246604978346754049&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;Titus Andronicus Act V&lt;/a>;,” he lip-synchs dialogue from the TV show “Catfish,” in four different costumes; it&#39;s nine seconds long.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Harris did the TikToks for fun; they were, for weeks, his sole avenue of creative expression. But they were also, not so subtly, a dig at the profession through which he had gained his recent fame. Rooted in the history and the canonical repertoire of theatre, but yoked dramaturgically to hyper-current rhythms and attitudes and styles, the TikToks showed that Harris could do what the big arts institutions couldn&#39;t—keep up. While they floundered, he figured, the show would go on from his phone. He had changed the bio on his frequently updated Twitter account to a kind of epitaph for the theatre: “I spent my 20s devoted to a craft in a coma.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Stages everywhere were dark; theatre companies and nonprofits were scrambling. In both their public statements and their private conversations with playwrights, they projected blithe optimism, as though their operations would be up and running by summer&#39;s end.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Like, no, guys!” Harris said, describing his frustration. “We have to reinvent this or re-create this, or else it&#39;s going to be even more detrimental to artists in six months, when you guys have wasted your resources trying to go the normal way.” “Daddy” was still in British limbo, and he had another play, “A Boy&#39;s Company Presents: &#39;Tell Me If I&#39;m Hurting You&#39; ”—his version of a Jacobean revenge drama, based on a particularly bad breakup—scheduled to début in May, at Playwrights Horizons, in New York. Nobody would officially admit—or, perhaps, allow themselves to believe—that the upcoming seasons wouldn&#39;t happen, but Harris was already mourning the new play, just as he was mourning “Daddy.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;His ire notwithstanding, thinking and talking about the failures of his industry seemed to energize him—almost to soothe him—and his online complaints soon came to echo a wider mood. As the initial shock of the pandemic gave way to a reëvaluation of racial and other societal arrangements, Harris became a kind of spokesman for the long-standing and suddenly stark unrest felt by his fellow-artists. It was a moment well suited to Harris&#39;s natural, if somewhat paradoxical, penchant for institutional critique. A happy disrupter of genteel silences, he has nonetheless, however rockily, charted a professional and personal path through some of the entertainment world&#39;s most staid establishment outposts: the Yale School of Drama; Gucci, for which he does modelling; various Hollywood-adjacent neighborhoods in Los Angeles; and now, most visibly, the Great White Way. The previous fall, “Slave Play,” the first of Harris&#39;s works to be staged in New York, had transferred to the Golden Theatre, on Broadway, after an extended run at the venerable New York Theatre Workshop, downtown.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Slave Play” tells the story of three interracial couples undergoing “antebellum sexual-performance therapy,” in order, presumably, to mend the edges of their relationships, which have been frayed by race. In the first act, before the audience is in on the premise, the couples—dressed in nineteenth-century garb, as masters and slaves—engage in various kinky sexual scenarios calibrated to set off trip wires in race- and sex-sensitive American minds. The second act, in which the actual therapy takes place, is straightforwardly funny. The third is a surreal, largely horrifying duet between one of the couples, a Black woman and her white husband. Over and over, “Slave Play” calls into question the true parameters of sexual consent and tries to wring current-day catharsis from the brutal history of master-slave rape.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;In some corners—including this magazine, in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/12/24/black-and-white-in-slave-play-and-to-kill-a-mockingbird&quot;>;review&lt;/a>; that I wrote—Harris was lauded for the wild rigor of his vision and the originality of his voice. And the play&#39;s overwhelming success was the precondition for many of the luxuries he now enjoyed: the London flat, the European engagement, a two-year development deal that he had recently signed with HBO. At the same time, “Slave Play” was a kind of troll job, perversely aimed at unsettling and possibly enraging the various constituencies—racial, sexual, institutional, professional—to which he belonged. Harris must have known that the play would have this effect; he seemed to revel in the discursive mess it left in its wake. Even before the pandemic, he had earned a reputation as an enfant terrible, the kind of designation that is made possible only by way of proximity. You&#39;ve got to be fairly close to the big house to even consider throwing stones.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Something I&#39;ve always wondered is when I&#39;m going to develop the affected-Black-intellectual voice,” Harris said that summer, still stuck in London. He was reflecting on some of his favorite writers and artists of an older generation, and the way that their talk was often as effortfully stylized as their work. He&#39;d been thinking about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1994/11/07/andre-leon-talley-vogue-the-only-one&quot;>;André Leon Talley&lt;/a>;, the fashion writer and editor whose high diction and baroque syntax became hallmarks of his style—and seemed, moreover, like a way of asserting his belonging in a largely white milieu. Talley, who died last year, was, like Harris, a tall, queer, highly verbal Black man from the South. His web of complex, sometimes tortured relationships with white co-workers, bosses, and benefactors was consonant with—and had possibly even influenced—the dynamics depicted in “Slave Play.” Harris is unabashed in his study of other artists&#39; personas. “I&#39;m so interested in personal style, and personal relationships, and class—if not class ascension, then class association,” he said. “Just the lilt of certain people.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Talk of that voice—I knew what Harris meant without having to ask—got me thinking, perhaps slightly defensively, of my own.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“You have it a little bit,” he said, confirming a fear I&#39;d spoken aloud.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;We agreed, though, that the voice of our rough age cohort—Harris is thirty-four—was particular. The sort of Black Millennial writer whom Harris had in mind was not someone who would deploy the suavely concatenated sentences of James Baldwin. Rather, this hypothetical thirtysomething, as eager to showcase pop-cultural with-it-ness and egalitarian humility as to display hard-won verbal acuity, would use locutions peppered with pointed “like”s and “um”s, plus a bit of vocal fry, for subtler tones of falsely self-deprecating color: a Valley Girl with an advanced degree.&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot;

” Harris said. “But also, partially, I think unconsciously, I did it so that my intellect wouldn&#39;t be intimidating to everyone around me. This is a part of my plays that was also a part of growing up—I&#39;ve always had to figure out how to translate stuff from the academy into language that my mom could understand, without asking her to take time from her life to read, like, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/10/26/how-saidiya-hartman-retells-the-history-of-black-life&quot;>;Saidiya Hartman&lt;/a>;.” A dramaturgical note for “Slave Play” quoted both Hartman and Hortense Spillers, another Black feminist scholar, but the play itself takes Rihanna as its primary muse. “I had to bring my learning into a different space of understanding, which is why it&#39;s so much more fun for me to write plays that are based in theory than it is for me to go, &#39;And then Jonathan wanted to get a divorce from Becca,&#39; or things like that.”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;tv2w5&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Harris speaks in a restless tenor, alternating locomotive bursts with considered pauses; his voice is bright and brackish and warm. He talks about movies and plays and clothes and people&#39;s bodies constantly. His sentences often start with “Have you seen?” or “Have you read?” Unless he already knows, from your work—almost all his friends are artists or public people of one kind or another—that you&#39;ve seen it or read it, and what you think about it, and is prepared to gently argue. He says “yes,” encouragingly but without much emphasis, when he hears something he agrees with, never “yeah.” Two words he uses a lot are “ostensibly” and “psychotic.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Harris was raised in Martinsville, Virginia, among people who made their livings with their bodies, many of them in factories. His way with words marked him as different. His mother, Veronica Farrish, refused to let family members use baby talk with him. He taught himself to read, and was soon the kind of prematurely unimpressed kid who finds it easier to make friends with teachers than with classmates. When Harris was eight, one of his favorite pastimes, he said, was trading theories with his mother about what had happened to JonBenét Ramsey, the six-year-old pageant contestant whose murder was a tabloid bonanza in the late nineties: “I was, like, &#39;OK, I looked at this document.&#39; ”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;His early interest in true crime briefly convinced him that he wanted to be a lawyer—that standby aspiration for the precociously talkative. But after landing a part in his middle school&#39;s production of “My Fair Lady,” he realized that he possibly just wanted to play a lawyer on TV. Around the same time, Harris was realizing that he was gay, or at least different—this difference was the rare condition for which he didn&#39;t yet have the words. Another discomfort was the unsettled nature of his home life. He didn&#39;t meet his biological father until he was nine or ten; his mother married another man when Harris was four, got divorced when Harris was in middle school, then embarked on another short-lived marriage, to a military man stationed at what was then Fort Bragg, in North Carolina. Harris moved there with his mother and enrolled in a new school. “I was so upset,” he said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Harris spent much of his childhood in private Christian schools, helped by financial aid. As a result, he became comfortable with the discombobulating tension of being a poor Black kid in a largely rich, white environment. Then, in tenth grade, he got a scholarship to Carlisle, a prep school in Martinsville. In the hallways, there were pictures of each graduating class. As Harris recalls, Black faces didn&#39;t begin showing up in the photographs until the mid-nineties, when the school started a basketball team. “Everybody wanted me to play basketball,” Harris said. “And I was, like, No. I hated that so much. I was, like, I will &lt;em>;never&lt;/em>; do that.” Instead, he took up swimming and dance. He kept up his practice of befriending teachers. “Candace—and Paula, who taught in the middle school,” he recalled, “I would have coffee with them after school, and they were my friends.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;By this point, Harris was determined to be an actor. He got parts in plays and musicals and directed a production of “The Laramie Project,” Moisés Kaufman&#39;s documentary play about the aftermath of the killing of Matthew Shepard, a gay student at the University of Wyoming. His kaffeeklatsch pal Candace Owen-Williams, who taught drama at Carlisle, let him turn an empty trailer behind the school into a black-box theatre, where he and some other friends put on experimental shows. His senior thesis was a one-man production of Wallace Shawn&#39;s “The Fever.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;For college, Harris went to the acting conservatory at DePaul University, in Chicago. The program&#39;s structure was brutal: after freshman year, only half of the students were allowed to continue with the acting cohort; the others were cut, and had to pursue different fields of study if they wished to remain at the school. Harris found the first year—essentially a protracted audition—disorienting. “A lot of my teachers said that my intellect was going to get in the way of me being a real actor,” he said. “I always sort of directed or rewrote the circumstances of the scene to fit the emotional states that I wanted to play around in, to make it more interesting to me.” Part of the problem, he said, was that so many of the roles and scenes were geared toward white actors. But he internalized the message that “if you&#39;re smart, you have to hide it,” he said. “I still stand by all my choices,” he added, “because, in some ways, I made cooler theatre then than I&#39;m making now.” For an exercise in “auto-drama,” he put twenty lamps of different shapes and sizes onstage. The lamps were the only source of light in the show; each one represented a story connected to a father figure. Then, as now, Harris was seeking, and sometimes finding, masked ways to describe the absence left by his actual father. In the glow of each light, he told a version of a memory.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;After the first semester, Harris chopped his long hair, nervous about how his teachers might perceive him. When the program made its cuts, the following summer, he called his friend and classmate Erika J. Simpson. Neither had got in. They were quiet for a long time.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;1uw3i&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;It was June—a beautiful month in Chicago but, for Harris, who had just turned nineteen, the grim beginning of an uncertain period. He called one of his teachers to ask why he&#39;d been dismissed; she said that he wouldn&#39;t be “castable” as an actor until his thirties, and rattled off a list of reasons that felt, to him, like “gay-coded shit.” He told me, “There were four Black boys in our year, and the two that got cut were the ones that felt the femme-est.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;He started collecting issues of the Chicago &lt;em>;Reader&lt;/em>;, a free alternative newspaper whose pages he trawled for acting notices. At an audition, he broke down, crying and trembling. He explained himself to the producers—some of them had gone to DePaul; they understood—and they told him that he could step out of the room for a moment, compose himself, and try again. Instead, he just left.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Eventually, Harris got modest parts at small venues in the city. He became an English major, and briefly imagined writing poems. He was interested in the work of Ai, a mixed-race woman from Arizona whose poor upbringing reminded Harris of his own. In her poems, Ai, who died in 2010, inhabited the voices of tough, sly, vulnerable working-class people asserting their dignity—or, at least, some measure of hip and artful defiance—against the backdrop of an indifferent and often hostile world. “You say you want this story / in my own words, / but you won&#39;t tell it my way,” her poem “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/browse?volume=151&amp;amp;issue=1&amp;amp;page=14&quot;>;Interview with a Policeman&lt;/a>;,” from 1987, begins. Her work would come to influence Harris&#39;s understanding of the possibilities of monologue.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;But Harris didn&#39;t remain an English major, or a DePaul student, for long. He dropped out and, a year later, moved to Los Angeles.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;By the end of the first pandemic summer, Harris and Khosravi had left the London apartment and were driving around Europe in a car full of their stuff. Khosravi had felt too cooped up in their flat, but Harris refused to move back to the US “This is why it&#39;s hell to date me,” he said. The pair were in Naples, Italy, in mid-October, when Tony nominations were announced, on a live stream. It was evening in Italy; Harris got on FaceTime with his mom, nieces, and nephew, so that he could watch it with them. He had to hop off about four nominations in because the stream that his mom was watching was ahead of his, and she kept screaming before he&#39;d seen the news. In the end, “Slave Play” got twelve nominations, more than any non-musical production had before.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Slave Play” was a genuinely difficult piece of work, a deliberate provocation. At one post-show Q. &amp;amp; A., a white woman yelled at Harris that she didn&#39;t “want to hear that white people are the fucking problem all the time.” Some Black audience members insisted that the play was oriented toward a “white gaze,” and was a cynical exploitation of the intertwined subjects of slavery and rape. Both currents of backlash were more or less predictable. The dozen nominations seemed to indicate that Harris could start a food fight in the theatre world&#39;s living room and still be invited to sit at its dinner table.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“It emboldens me to be more forthright with my opinions and how I feel about the world, because, if I gave a fuck about what institutions were actually saying to me, the &#39;Slave Play&#39; that got twelve nominations would not be the &#39;Slave Play&#39; that got twelve nominations,” he said. “It would have been a dumber play, and a less complex play, and a less Jeremy play.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;But this institutional approbation also posed a kind of creative challenge. “I think the thing that I&#39;m trying to get over—and I&#39;ve been working on this a lot over the last year—is other people&#39;s excitement about me,” Harris said. “It&#39;s easier for me to write when I&#39;m writing from a place of, like, &#39;These people don&#39;t believe in me enough.&#39; When I have something to prove, I can write so much better.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Since his time in LA, if not before, Harris had defined himself in opposition to those around him—or, at least, those with power. He had initially made his way not in professional settings but in the more free-flowing dynamic of late-night scenes. In Chicago, he had begun to understand his personality and physical bearing as a kind of talent. He was funny and gay and six feet five; people gravitated toward him and wanted him to come to their parties. He got a job at a trendy women&#39;s boutique in Wicker Park, &lt;em >;AKIRA&lt;/em>;, where he helped clients find going-out outfits. Often, those clients would invite him to clubs. Soon, he was a night-life fixture.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“I am the No. 1 person who will tell you that I hate gay bars, because I don&#39;t have as much power there,” he told me. “Black and skinny and charismatic—it gives you much more power in a straight bar than in a gay bar. I wasn&#39;t threatening to the straight men there. And I was also a weird honeypot for the night clubs because all these fun girls would want to stick around longer to hang out, and buy more bottles, too.” Night life is a churning economy, only partially visible to most people, a system behind a veil.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;He carved out a similar space in LA, getting a day job where cool and connected people were sure to buy clothes—Barneys this time—and becoming a regular presence in the clubs. He made friends, some of them in show business, and asked around about how to find his way in the industry. Among the people he talked to at parties were important future collaborators: the writer and director Sam Levinson, the filmmaker Janicza Bravo. “I think that my verbal abilities helped me navigate the space,” he said. “And also my style. I have good-to-decent style.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Harris got small acting gigs: he starred in a short film directed by the actor James Franco; he appeared, very briefly, in the Terrence Malick movie “Song to Song.” But he hated the idea of being at the mercy of gatekeepers, who, like his teachers at DePaul, might label him uncastable. When Lena Dunham&#39;s show “Girls” débuted on HBO, in the spring of 2012, he saw her as a kindred spirit, and a role model. Watching “Girls,” he thought, “This is so perfect, and also I think I could do it.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Like Dunham—and like Ilana Glazer and Abbi Jacobson, of “Broad City,” another inspiration—Harris and Erika Simpson, his friend from DePaul, created a Web series, “#NightStrife,” and uploaded it to YouTube. “It&#39;s two twentysomethings trying to get famous,” Simpson says, by way of explanation, in the first episode. They made only a few episodes, which were not widely seen, though a tongue-in-cheek series promo of sorts, titled “Black Girl Takes a Shit,” has been watched nearly eighty thousand times.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Harris became jaded about Hollywood; he stopped acting, and stopped referring to himself as an actor. He started to call himself a playwright, though he had yet to write a play. He cast about for ideas, unsuccessfully, until he went on a date with a porn star, whose stories yielded the material for Harris&#39;s first play, “Xander Xyst, Dragon: 1,” a kind of fantasia on the theme of online celebrity. With the play—which featured music by Isabella Summers, of Florence and the Machine, another friend he&#39;d made in LA—he won a spot at the Samuel French Off-Off Broadway Short Play Festival, in 2014. There, he met a group of young playwrights who are now his contemporaries: Will Arbery, Martyna Majok, Leah Nanako Winkler, Eleanor Burgess.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Afterward, he applied for a fellowship at the MacDowell artists&#39; residency—and, when he was wait-listed, he called the administration every day until someone told him yes. At MacDowell, he met the playwright Amy Herzog, who encouraged him to apply to Yale. He&#39;d already finished a draft of “Daddy,” and he submitted it to the drama school&#39;s admissions board, along with a heartfelt essay. “The clearest memory I have of my childhood is elegantly staged,” he wrote. “Delicately, it moves in a realm between the cinematic and the theatrical: lights up on an open screen door leading into a wide hallway, my mother (early 30s) downstage paces from one off stage room to another whispering vitriol into a cordless phone, somewhere further off stage we can hear the sounds of a young girl crying, and upstage in profile I sit (12) back to back with a large suitcase looking out of the open door periodically. 。 。 。 Suddenly the crying stops replaced by The Pointer Sisters and my mother is standing with my sister in her arms in the middle of the hall tears, a smile and snot dancing on her face, &#39;He&#39;s not coming. Come on baby, let&#39;s dance,&#39; she said. So we did.”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;xd9qbr&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Harris has come to see “Daddy” as a play about furthering his career by seeking the opportunity and resources that an institution like Yale can provide. “Going to Yale was me deciding to marry a white guy on a hill and in order to have the time and space to make my work,” he &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.ssense.com/en-us/editorial/culture/oh-jeremy&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.ssense.com/en-us/editorial/culture/oh-jeremy&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.ssense.com/en-us/editorial/culture/oh-jeremy&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;told&lt;/a>; one interviewer. Elsewhere, he has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vice.com/en/article/8qgm9g/decolonizing-my-desire&quot;>;described&lt;/a>; the play as an attempt “to parse the ways I was cradled, coddled and collected by white institutions and how I&#39;ve collected and used them in turn.” He once wrote that he went to Yale with eyes open, “believing that I could take more from this place than they would take from me.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In early 2021, the demands of Harris&#39;s still fairly young renown finally called him back to New York. &lt;em>;Town &amp;amp; Country&lt;/em>; had planned a multi-page spread to showcase his newly designed home office, which had been furnished by the chic design firm Green River Project. On a cold, pewter-sky morning in January, Harris sat in a studio belonging to Aaron Aujla, one of the firm&#39;s owners, at a nondescript former warehouse in Brooklyn, getting ready to have his picture taken. Someone tended to his hair, always a foremost point of interest in the looks he puts together for magazine covers and red carpets. There were small, feathery tufts of it strewn about the studio&#39;s bright-green floor.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“I think I want just a mustache,” Harris said. He&#39;d come to the shoot with several pictures of the Japanese writer Yukio Mishima at the ready on his phone. He pulled one up: Mishima in his office, behind a desk and flanked by books, pouting fiercely at the camera, his dark brows writhing. The writer&#39;s louche, vaguely sexual gaze did have something of the solitary mustache about it.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Harris has often, with a bit of a wink—and in spite of Mishima&#39;s reactionary politics—called Mishima his favorite writer. A few months earlier, he had tweeted, “Ok guys so to combat seasonal / pandemic depression and the sense that my life moves at a pace my body can&#39;t keep up with I&#39;ve decided to do a workout every day a la my favorite writer YUKIO MISHIMA. Who combatted depression and dread w/ workouts and a failed coup d&#39;état.” In 1970, Mishima and several members of a militia that he had formed attempted to take over a Japanese military base, in the hope of inspiring an overthrow of the country&#39;s constitution. After a fiery speech, Mishima—obsessed with physical beauty and warlike vigor—killed himself with a sword. “Do I hate fascists?” Harris wrote, in another tweet. “Yes. Do I love Mishima?是的。 I&#39;m a Gemini. Two truths can be held.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Aujla puttered in and out of the studio, smiling and not saying much. He is married to the fashion designer Emily Bode, known for her knit menswear; she and Aujla are neighbors of Harris&#39;s, in Chinatown, and have become his friends. She&#39;d brought a rack of clothes for Harris to choose from. Once in a while, he&#39;d disappear behind a curtain and come out wearing a pair of fluid trousers or a lacy top or a burgundy suit, evocative of Mishima. (He selected the suit as one of his outfits.) When something tickled him, he let his voice rise to a high, smoky giggle. “That&#39;s cunt,” he sometimes said. Between costume changes, he chatted about recent movies, especially a new coming-of-age indie film that everybody seemed to like but that he couldn&#39;t bring himself to watch.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;“Arvand hates me for this,” Harris said, referring to his Hollywood-exec boyfriend, “but I can&#39;t stand this kind of shit.” He went on, “It&#39;s always that same thing: &#39;Here I am, marginalized little kid—Black, immigrant, gay, whatever—and here&#39;s the &lt;em>;wide&lt;/em>;, &lt;em>;wide world&lt;/em>;.&#39; ” By now he was acting out the archetype, hunched into a pantomime of childish wonder, his eyes big with fear, his hands clasped. “And now there&#39;s big trouble”—he cowered in terror—“and inner strife”—he anxiously trembled—“but soon”—now he let a smile spread across his face—“I overcome.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“I knew exactly what that movie was gonna be the moment it started, and I was, like, No, thank you,” he said. Bode, who has a slim face framed by twin curtains of dark hair and speaks in a soft, helpful voice, like that of an expensive therapist, laughed until her face turned pink.&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;a data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a27607&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a27607&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;Jeremy O.

Like Harris, Leifheit went to Yale for graduate school and is the entrepreneurial, self-sustaining center of his own career. He edits the magazine &lt;em>;MATTE&lt;/em>;, makes photo books, and teaches workshops across the country. They met because of Harris&#39;s insistence, in New Haven, on spreading his presence far beyond the confines of the drama school: he was known to drop in on photography critique sessions and to speak up, offering references and suggestions. “A lot of people thought he was part of the photo program,” John Pilson, one of the program&#39;s longest-serving faculty members, said. “By the end, we all expected to see him every week.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Harris had arrived at Yale in 2016. Several of his classmates were far beyond him professionally: they&#39;d had shows produced, they had agents. He was eager to catch up, but soon found himself at odds with the institution. The curriculum was too conservative for his taste; he felt that his instructors were dismissive of his interest in more experimental work. He started taking classes in Black studies and poetry. He also began work on “Slave Play,” which he says “poured out” of him almost whole. He was assigned a faculty adviser, the acclaimed playwright and director &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/11/03/real-gone-girl&quot;>;Young Jean Lee&lt;/a>;, who would help shepherd a student production.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Lee is a longtime downtown experimentalist, and many of her work&#39;s subjects—race, class, the body—are also crucial to Harris; he was excited to work with her. But she had extensive notes on “Slave Play,” which Harris mostly declined to take. She objected strongly to the final act, set in the bedroom of a Black woman named Kaneisha and her white British husband, Jim. Their therapy has been a disaster, largely because of Jim&#39;s refusal to go along with goofily degrading role-play. Kaneisha calls Jim a “virus,” and connects their relationship to the brutalities of the past; Jim gets back into character, as a slave master, and gives Kaneisha the abasement she seems to have been asking for.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;This sequence, the most hotly debated part of “Slave Play,” stayed in the show, even after the move to Broadway. When Lee saw it in a dress rehearsal, she was horrified; later, she told Harris that it took her more than an hour to calm down enough to give him feedback. The two then exchanged lengthy text messages. “I hope that no one has ever spoken that violently to you about work that so deeply intersects with your being, and if they have I&#39;m sorry,” Harris wrote. Lee replied, “If you&#39;re that irresponsible about putting a rape of a female body onstage, I&#39;m going to call you out on it in no uncertain terms. To turn it around and call me the violent one is a classic move that has been done to me many times, and I&#39;ve never fallen for it, and I&#39;m not falling for it now.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Their dispute culminated in a formal complaint process, presided over by Tarell Alvin McCraney, who leads the drama school&#39;s playwriting program. Harris used transcripts from those meetings in “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.nplusonemag.com/issue-38/fiction-drama/yell-a-documentary-of-my-time-here/&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.nplusonemag.com/issue-38/fiction-drama/yell-a-documentary-of-my-time-here/&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nplusonemag.com/issue-38/fiction-drama/yell-a-documentary-of-my-time-here/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;Yell: A &#39;Documentary&#39; of My Time Here&lt;/a>;,” his senior thesis play. I went to see it, in New Haven, in 2019. By then, Harris had already staged “Slave Play” and “Daddy” Off Broadway, but he still had something to prove to his teachers. The most constant formal structure in “Yell” is repeated acts of onstage defecation. Fake shit was everywhere at Yale&#39;s Iseman Theatre that day.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;p49xk&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Harris has said that “Yell” was inspired by the radical 1967 essay “The Student as Nigger,” by Jerry Farber, which compares the relationship between American students and their professors to that of slaves and masters. In June, 2020, at the height of the George Floyd protests, Harris shared “Yell” online, and wrote a long accompanying Twitter &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://twitter.com/jeremyoharris/status/1270447515570233350&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://twitter.com/jeremyoharris/status/1270447515570233350&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jeremyoharris/status/1270447515570233350&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;thread&lt;/a>; in which he posted screenshots of his text exchange with Lee, who declined to comment for this story. “EVERY DAY THEY TREATED ME LIKE A NIGGA THAT NEEDED TO BE TAMED AND IT MADE ME FEEL CRAZY,” he wrote.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In September, 2021, Harris sat in a chair in a bathroom at a ritzy hotel in New York. The Tonys were finally being awarded that night, and he&#39;d booked a suite nearby, where he could get ready. Also in the bathroom were his hairdresser, Latisha Chong, and a woman tending to his makeup and nails. He sat stock-still, never wincing as Chong pulled through his Afro and started to braid. The three of them, mutually devoted to the task of flashy beauty, calmly chatted about people they knew in common.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Everybody who knows him thinks he&#39;s gay,” Harris said. “But, I&#39;m telling you, he&#39;s straight.” Both women disbelievingly harrumphed. “Bone straight,” he said.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;The bathroom was a center of calm in the otherwise hectic suite. Harris occasionally got up to take a Polaroid of the room—an editor at &lt;em>;Vogue&lt;/em>; had commissioned him to keep a photo diary. Also milling around were two camerapeople shooting footage for a “Slave Play” documentary that Harris had promised to deliver to HBO. They swanned around the room, sometimes going out on the balcony to capture views of downtown and the West Side. Beyond and between the buildings, you could see the Hudson quietly snaking along.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Harris&#39;s assistant kept running out of the room, collecting bouquets of flowers and other gifts that were arriving in a steady stream. Harris had recently interviewed the young gay rapper Lil Nas X for a &lt;em>;GQ&lt;/em>; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gq.com/story/lil-nas-x-musician-of-the-year-2021&quot;>;profile&lt;/a>;. “Montero—he&#39;s brilliant,” he said, using the rapper&#39;s given name. “The interview felt kind of like a first date.” He asked his assistant to put on a song from Lil Nas X&#39;s new album, a catchy single called “Industry Baby.” “This one is gonna be huge,” Harris said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Friends continually appeared, at his invitation. His mother and niece were getting their makeup done in a neighboring room. Candace Owen-Williams, his old teacher, was there, too, in a sparkly gown. Harris pointed her out to each new arrival and repeated the story of how she made him feel less alone at school.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;This is how Harris relaxes—sitting somewhere near the center of a crowd that he&#39;s convened. Antwaun Sargent, an art critic and a gallerist with Gagosian, walked over to the ledge where Harris&#39;s gold accessories, custom-made for him by the haute-couture house Schiaparelli, sat gleaming. There were chunky rings and cufflinks, a necklace with a pendant made from a cast of Harris&#39;s ear, a “Phantom of the Opera”-style mask modelled after a swooping section of his face.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;As the sun began to set and the light in the room darkened, Harris asked everyone to leave so that he could ready himself for the show. That night, in a surprise to prognosticators, “Slave Play” was completely shut out—twelve nominations, nothing to bring home. The next day, the online edition of Page Six carried the headline “Jeremy O. Harris celebrates Tony snubs with two afterparties.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Early last year, Harris tweeted a casual swipe at the state of television. “I write tv for people who have an intellect for theatre since tv is hollow,” he wrote. “Bc the funny thing is the reason so many filmmakers and theatre makers were asked to make television is bc the medium hit a wall. That&#39;s why almost all the best tv, of late, has been made by exciting practitioners of other forms.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Stung TV writers and irritated critics noted that Harris now made much of his living from television, and not always in its most rarefied corners. In 2021, he&#39;d done a cameo, as himself, on the reboot of “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2008/03/10/advanced-placement&quot;>;Gossip Girl&lt;/a>;.” (The script called for a play within the show, which Harris wrote; later, he got it commissioned by the Public Theatre.) Then he was cast, as a fashion designer, in the second season of “Emily in Paris,” Darren Starr&#39;s critically maligned Netflix series about an American influencer who gets a job in France. The show&#39;s producers told Harris that they were looking for someone reminiscent of a young André Leon Talley.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Sharper observers of Harris&#39;s commentary noticed that he was playing a familiar role. “I support Jeremy O Harris being snotty about TV,” the &lt;em>;Times&lt;/em>; critic Jason Zinoman wrote. “Playwrights used to be like this all the time. It&#39;s a glorious tradition.” The path from New York theatre to a career in Hollywood—where the money and the weather are better, and the audiences are bigger—has been traversed by writers for almost a century. And Harris seemed to be giving television a dose of his usual medicine: let me in and I&#39;ll give you a piece of my mind.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;But on his winding path to playwriting, Harris had made the kinds of friends you would make if you were aiming for the screen all along. When Harris was still at Yale, Sam Levinson made him a consultant for his notoriously lurid HBO teen drama “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/on-television/the-addictive-chills-and-thrills-of-euphoria&quot;>;Euphoria&lt;/a>;.” (Harris is now a producer on the series.) Janicza Bravo got Harris hired as the co-writer for her movie “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-front-row/zola-reviewed-a-twitter-thread-takes-an-ingenious-and-audacious-cinematic-form&quot;>;Zola&lt;/a>;,” adapted from a riotous series of tweets.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;His steadiest Hollywood employment came in the form of the HBO deal that he signed in 2020. The following year, the network announced that he would adapt the novel “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Vanishing-Half-Novel-Brit-Bennett/dp/0525536965&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Vanishing-Half-Novel-Brit-Bennett/dp/0525536965&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Vanishing-Half-Novel-Brit-Bennett/dp/0525536965&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;The Vanishing Half&lt;/a>;,” by Brit Bennett, along with the playwright Aziza Barnes, a friend of his. The novel tells the story of twin sisters whose fates diverge: one dissolves into the American mainstream, passing as white; the other anchors herself in Black community. Harris and Barnes assembled a writers&#39; room to produce a pilot and a “show bible,” outlining the plot of the first season. They led the writers on a research trip to New Orleans, where much of “The Vanishing Half” is set. As the weeks passed, Harris was often airborne, travelling to fashion gigs, conducting interviews for magazines. When he signed the HBO deal, he&#39;d insisted that his contract contain an annual fund for supporting theatre, and he&#39;d used some of that money to create a fellowship for emerging writers. He was always &lt;em>;working&lt;/em>;. He just wasn&#39;t always writing.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Then, the following June, the Daily Beast &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thedailybeast.com/jeremy-o-harris-let-go-from-hbos-the-vanishing-half&quot;>;reported&lt;/a>; that Harris and Barnes were no longer working on the show. The article cited two sources who claimed that Harris “was let go after having trouble meeting script deadlines.” HBO insisted that he had not been fired. There had simply been creative differences, which were “part of the normal development process.” Harris, HBO added, “is a valued collaborator, and we currently have other projects in development with him.” (He is no longer on an exclusive deal with HBO but continues to work with the network.)&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I visited Harris, at his apartment, a couple of weeks later. It was a bright July day, hot in the sun but buoyed by a breeze. He answered the door wearing a long green terry-cloth robe, with dark polish on his fingernails. His young nephew had been wanting to paint his nails and was getting grief about it in his Southern milieu, Harris said, so he had painted his in solidarity. “Sometimes I think people don&#39;t want him to be a &#39;punk&#39; like Uncle Jeremy,” he said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The Daily Beast hadn&#39;t reported any details about Harris&#39;s approach to the “Vanishing Half” adaptation, but I had heard, from several friends, about a proposed scene in which a lot of feces is flung around. It sounded preposterous but not entirely unlikely. Harris, in his work, likes to explain drastic external action by way of uncomfortable, abject, and often lewd interior depths. His characters earn their brief glories after trudging through lots of shame; his people get splattered.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Harris seemed surprised that I&#39;d heard about the scene in such detail, but was happy to discuss it. He loved Bennett&#39;s book, but wanted to interpret it freely, even radically, something TV writers don&#39;t do enough, he said. One addition he and the writers envisioned was a surrealistic quasi-dream sequence that would send a character&#39;s consciousness “skipping like a stone across the waters of time,” as Harris put it in the show bible. The character would witness a “depraved ritual” meant to cleanse a small town of its communal sins, and the dark bacchanal would include “blackface masks, buffoonery and flying mud and feces.” It would end with “infidelities, thefts and dark family secrets ushered from the shadows into the light.”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;22nqj&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Harris was less annoyed by people gossiping about his work than by the suggestion, in the Daily Beast and elsewhere, that he wasn&#39;t a hard worker. “I&#39;m actually really insecure about that,” he said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;He was about to go abroad, and he wanted a new swimsuit for the summer trip; he&#39;d asked Emily Bode to design one for him. We walked to her small tailoring shop in Chinatown, where a board high up on a brownish wall announced the prices for alterations. Half-done garments hung on faceless mannequins.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;A tailor silently took Harris&#39;s measurements, then gave him the swimsuit that Bode had left for him to try on: a lime-green one-piece with thin tank-top straps and tight shorts. He had seemed sedate and almost tired in the apartment, but now his mood lifted. He retreated behind a curtain, then came out wearing the suit, hugging his thin body. It fit. He looked into a mirror and spread his arms. He was already smiling.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;One night last October, Harris went to the Brooklyn Academy of Music to see the renowned Belgian theatre director Ivo van Hove&#39;s adaptation of the novel “A Little Life,” by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/01/17/hanya-yanagiharas-audience-of-one&quot;>;Hanya Yanagihara&lt;/a>;. Harris is friendly with Yanagihara—he&#39;d spoken with her about acting in a possible TV adaptation of the book. He attended the play with an old roommate from his Yale days, Michael Breslin, who co-founded the theatre collective Fake Friends. Harris has co-produced two of the collective&#39;s shows: “Circle Jerk,” a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize for drama, and “This American Wife,” a harrowing parody of Bravo&#39;s “Real Housewives” franchise.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“A Little Life” centers on a group of friends in New York, one of whom, a saintly character named Jude, is repeatedly flayed by acts of unspeakable violence. Like “Slave Play,” the novel was dogged by accusations of sadism. After the show, Harris, who has cited the Marquis de Sade as a formative influence, chatted with his friends. They all agreed that some of the show&#39;s most excruciating scenes, which had provoked gasps in the audience, could have been, in keeping with the book, a bit more graphic.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Harris took a car home, stopping for a drink at a bar near his apartment. Writers—a species always overrunning those blocks, which have come to be called Dimes Square—spilled out of restaurants and sidewalk sheds. For a few minutes, cradling his drink, Harris argued amiably with a pop-music critic about the recently released movie “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-front-row/tar-reviewed-regressive-ideas-to-match-regressive-aesthetics&quot;>;Tár&lt;/a>;,” which Harris hated.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Back at his apartment, he ate and paced and talked—softly, because a friend, one in a rotating series of medium-term guests, was sleeping in the next room. Soon, Khosravi came home. Like Harris, he is tall and slender and demonstrative; subtle streaks of gray run through the ringlets of his hair. Unlike Harris, he seldom seems excited to argue. Before Khosravi, Harris had a boyfriend who broke up with him in part, Harris says, because of his sudden fame. “Arvand doesn&#39;t mind that I&#39;m a star,” he once told me.&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;a data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a24982&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a24982&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;“Take care out there today hon.

They were flying in the morning to a gala in Bentonville, Arkansas, at the Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art. Harris didn&#39;t seem stressed.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The next day, at the museum, as Harris wandered a room with paintings by Kehinde Wiley, Amy Sherald, and Kerry James Marshall, Khosravi surprised him by getting on one knee and proposing marriage. He&#39;d had a ring designed by a pair of jewellers who lived across the street from them in London and had become their friends. And he&#39;d asked the playwright &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/02/12/adrienne-kennedys-startling-body-of-work&quot;>;Adrienne Kennedy&lt;/a>;—a hero of Harris&#39;s, and now a frequent e-mail correspondent of his—to write a benediction, to be etched on the inside. It reads, “Happiness.是。大部头书。 Greatest Thing.” Harris said yes.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;A day later, he giddily recounted the proposal on Twitter, adding a pinch of social critique. “But someone, I guess I will?, needs to write about how cringe it is to be proposed to when you haven&#39;t been socialized to be waiting for it,” he wrote. “It&#39;s a really violent trap we set for both parties where you&#39;re asked to be in a play you know the script to and if you deviate from it 💔.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Harris&#39;s doomsaying in 2020—his sense that the gatekeepers were not doing enough to reimagine and thus preserve the world of theatre—has arguably been validated, in the worst way, in the three years since then. A wave of closures and layoffs has prompted a rash of op-eds about the future of the medium. Harris, as contrarian as ever, is not abandoning the theatre but, rather, becoming something of a gatekeeper himself: he has lately been, almost above all else, a facilitator of other people&#39;s work.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;He is currently the presiding playwright for the Yale Drama Series, a role that involves judging the program&#39;s annual prize. After he took the position, last year, he began conceiving a writers&#39; retreat for some of the prize&#39;s finalists—inspired, in part, by his experience at MacDowell. In March, he announced the inaugural Substratum fellows: four young playwrights who would spend a month at a medieval house, part of the hotel Monteverdi Tuscany, which, along with Gucci, would help cover the expenses.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;He was in Italy with the fellows when he got a text from the actress Rachel Brosnahan, who, along with Oscar Isaac, was starring in a revival of Lorraine Hansberry&#39;s 1964 play “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/03/13/sign-in-sidney-brusteins-window-theatre-review&quot;>;The Sign in Sidney Brustein&#39;s Window&lt;/a>;,” at &lt;em >;BAM&lt;/em>;. She hoped he&#39;d come see it. He said he was abroad, and asked if the play might be extended or transferred; she didn&#39;t think so. “I&#39;m going to get you to Broadway,” he replied. He phoned producer friends, and together they engineered a brief transfer to the James Earl Jones Theatre—another play set to open there had seen its financing collapse. The Hansberry revival wouldn&#39;t run long enough to turn a profit, but it would get a wider audience for a work by another of Harris&#39;s playwriting heroes. And the quick transfer suggested a different approach, perhaps, for Broadway: If space opens up, why not take a few chances?&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In August, Harris went to Great Barrington, Massachusetts, in the Berkshires, to spend two weeks acting in a movie directed by Pete Ohs, who edited the “Slave Play” documentary. Ohs makes largely improvised movies for twenty thousand dollars or less; the tiny budget meant that he could shoot without breaking the rules of the Writers Guild of America strike, which had begun in the spring and showed no signs of ending. The film was a country-house nightmare about contracting disease from deer ticks.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;The cast was staying at the house, which belonged to the actress Callie Hernandez, one of Ohs&#39;s collaborators. In the brightness of the afternoon, a wall of trees outside was variously green: dark pine, mild maple, vivid oak. Inside, James Cusati-Moyer, who was in “Slave Play”—his character, a gay man, refuses to describe himself as white—stood at the kitchen counter, mixing flaxseed, honey, psyllium husk, and cranberries in a steel bowl. He was making gluten-free bread, from a TikTok recipe. “You want a kind of cakey texture,” he said. “The woman in the video is incredibly annoying, but the bread is great.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The movie would begin shooting that night. Harris changed into a white linen caftan and went into town for groceries—he&#39;d volunteered to make dinner, for the second day in a row. He drives with a country boy&#39;s ease; he learned at fourteen, when his mother realized how impossible it would be for her to chauffeur him to all of his activities. He&#39;d already acclimated somewhat to the roads of Great Barrington, and to its local lore. “Birthplace of WEB DuBois,” he said. “They can&#39;t shut up about it—he&#39;s, like, the only Black guy they know.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Loping through the aisles at the grocery store, he picked up ears of corn with stringy husks and a pack of what he called “white-people aluminum foil,” packaged in a recyclable-looking brown paper box. He&#39;d begun writing a novel about a Black writer beset by deadlines and grief. Harris was very close with his mother&#39;s parents, who have both died in the past few years—his grandfather, Golden, died two weeks before “Slave Play” débuted on Broadway. “Writing isn&#39;t fun,” he said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;At lunch, in a small bakery across the street from a general store, he told me that his cash flow was slowing down as a result of the strike. “The other day, my niece asked me for a new phone, and I had to say no,” he said. “I told her, &#39;I&#39;m not trying to be mean—I&#39;m broke.&#39; ” He pays private-school tuition for her and his nephew; he bought a home, in Virginia, for his mom. He was worried about falling behind on payments.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;k3hwwg&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Back at the house, he enlisted his castmates as sous-chefs—chopping herbs, buttering corn—and began to cook. People were trying on clothes and critiquing the outfits. Would this work for the character? What else did it need? Cusati-Moyer was in a loose crop top. Harris loved it.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“I feel bloated from the bread,” Cusati-Moyer said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“You are,” Harris said, grinning.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“This is what he was like,” Cusati-Moyer told the others. “He builds you up and then he breaks you back down!”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Harris called his mom to ask her advice on the meal—pork chops, roasted corn, fried apples, all callbacks to his childhood. Should he melt the butter, put the apples in the cast iron, and &lt;em>;then&lt;/em>; pour the sugar in?&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“I don&#39;t know if you know this,” he told her, “but there&#39;s a white way to make this, where you don&#39;t just pour sugar.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Yeah, well, we make it the Black way,” his mom said. They talked about Harris&#39;s niece, and about the patterns his mom had begun to notice in her romantic life, and about literature. They sounded like siblings who take turns being in control.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;She said that she wanted to write a book about her life. “The best way to write is to read really good things,” Harris said. “You have to read this book by a French woman named &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/11/21/annie-ernaux-turns-memory-into-art&quot;>;Annie Ernaux&lt;/a>;. &#39;Happening.&#39; You&#39;ll really like it.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;He sat in the kitchen, with food in the oven and on the stove, steeling himself quietly for work later on, chatting with his mother. For a moment, his life seemed almost normal. ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>; &lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/ div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;div>;&lt;div>;&lt;div>;&lt;div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt; /div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 18 Sep 2023 19:06:01 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[How Thom Browne’s Gray Suit Conquered American Fashion]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/09/25/how-thom-brownes-gray-suit-conquered-american-fashion]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-18T10:00:00.000Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650367a2fd47431d5e50a6ab/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/230925_r43002.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;article >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attribute-verso-pattern=&quot;article-body&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;ArticlePageChunks&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Every new employee of the American fashion designer Thom Browne receives a “starter kit” of his brand&#39;s clothing worth some ten thousand dollars retail, including, among other items, two gray suits, five white oxford shirts, one gray wool tie, and one white pocket square. An eleven-page PDF lays out, through visual aids and bullet points, the rules for how to wear what Browne refers to as “uniform” (never “the uniform” or “a uniform”). Top buttons must remain undone. Shirts are not to be ironed. Neckties, a required accessory, should be tucked tightly into waistbands. Suit pants may be swapped out for a pleated skirt, regardless of one&#39;s gender; Browne, a proponent of androgynous dressing, has been putting men in skirts for more than a decade. Exceptions to the rules are doled out cautiously: the color navy is permitted Friday through Sunday but discouraged during the week; seersucker can be worn in the summer months, and white sneakers only on weekends.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;One afternoon in early July, I went to Avenue Montaigne, a luxury shopping promenade in Paris&#39;s Eighth Arrondissement, to visit Browne&#39;s French headquarters. In two days, Browne would, for the first time, present a runway show as part of Haute Couture Week. He was one of only a handful of American designers in the past fifty years to be invited to participate alongside such storied couture houses as Fendi, Chanel, and Schiaparelli. But the timing for a high-fashion pageant suddenly felt off. A few days earlier, a policeman had shot and killed an unarmed teen-ager of Algerian descent during a traffic stop in the Paris suburbs, sparking protests across the country. I had flown in on a red-eye expecting to find a city on edge. Yet on Avenue Montaigne the mood was serene. Pedestrians sauntered along a row of European flagship boutiques nestled in battlements of creamy limestone: Gucci, YSL, Prada, Louis Vuitton. At No. 30, Christian Dior occupied the same site where, more than seventy-five years ago, the designer unveiled his nipped-waist New Look silhouette. Browne&#39;s shop, at No. 17, is unmarked and open by appointment only, and when I saw the building, a blocky beige office tower that stood out from the elegant architecture like a bucktooth, I wondered if I was in the right place.&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;Thom Browne holding a ventriloquist&amp;#x27;s dummy.

One wore a suit paired with high-top lace-up brogues. Another was in seersucker shorts and a matching cinched waistcoat. The third had on a cropped cashmere vest over a sleeveless oxford shirt. The outfits were all variations on the archetypal Thom Browne ensemble: a “shrunken” gray suit with jacket sleeves that end above the wrists, lapels as thin and sharp as paring knives, and pant legs that are cut some three inches above the ankle, revealing what Browne likes to call “male cleavage.” (His preferred fabric is Super 120&#39;s wool twill in “medium gray,” a color that typically evokes the banal—pencil lead, gravel, wet cement.) The Thom Browne look has often been compared to Pee-wee Herman&#39;s archly nerdy costume or to Don Draper&#39;s office wear after a few rounds through the dryer, but it calls to my mind, too, some mischievous scamp out of a Roald Dahl book who is always conspiring to put a dead hamster in the headmistress&#39;s bed.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Browne, who is fifty-seven and launched his namesake ready-to-wear business twenty years ago, is hardly the first fashion designer to implement a dress code among employees—for decades, the Belgian designer Martin Margiela has required staff to wear long white coats, or &lt;em>;blouses blanches&lt;/em>;, at all times—nor is he the first to take a schematic approach to dressing his customers. Chanel&#39;s little black dress was, as &lt;em>;Vogue&lt;/em>; put it in 1926, a “uniform for all women of taste.” But, in an industry known for chasing novelty, Browne has built one of the most influential brands by iterating on a single idea. His deceptively humble goal is, as he regularly tells his staff, “to make the gray suit look interesting.” Once a menswear cult label, Thom Browne has in recent years become favored among celebrities who wish to signal that they&#39;re game for fashion risk-taking. In 2018—the same year the Italian textile juggernaut Zegna bought a majority stake in the brand, at a valuation of five hundred million dollars—LeBron James, a longtime fan, bought his Cleveland Cavaliers teammates matching Thom Browne suits to wear to playoff games. (The fashion critic Alexander Fury told me that Browne suits hold a special appeal among “big fucking straight men” who like the look of muscles bulging out of fine tailoring.) Browne has put the actor Oscar Isaac in a pleated skirt and the actress Christine Baranski in a corseted tuxedo. The members of boygenius, the queer-feminist supergroup, are currently channelling the early Beatles in custom Browne suits on their world tour. The musician Janelle Monáe, who identifies as nonbinary, attended this year&#39;s Met Gala in a Tim Burtonesque Thom Browne overcoat of black-and-white tweed that peeled off to reveal a giant sheer hoopskirt. Monáe told me, “In Thom&#39;s clothes I feel part of a species of people who are pushing culture forward.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;For the couture show, Browne had rented the Palais Garnier, the city&#39;s grand nineteenth-century opera house. His team had shipped the collection from New York in refrigerator boxes. On Avenue Montaigne, preparations were taking place in a temporary atelier two floors above Browne&#39;s permanent showroom. Fifty employees sat hunched over high tables covered in white cloth, furiously making final adjustments. Some were embellishing a blazer with hundreds of sequins no bigger than a freckle. Others worked on a long overcoat of dove-gray wool interlaced with rows of silver beads, mimicking the undulating texture of silk moiré. Across a hallway, in a makeshift photo studio and fitting room, a photographer was shooting a male model in a shale-colored “bell” gown. One of a dozen such looks in the collection, it had exaggerated mutton sleeves and a conical skirt; a three-piece suit was inlaid down the center of the garment, giving the impression of one outfit skin-grafted onto another. Every now and then, a muffled tinkling sounded from one corner, where Anna Scott, Browne&#39;s head of footwear, futzed with pairs of stilettos that featured brass bells on the heels.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;feature-large-callout&quot; >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;GroupCalloutWrapper&quot;>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;Every Thom Browne piece includes an accent of redwhiteandblue striped grosgrain as a nod to the ribbons on the medals...&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65039124ebce12b0b0432eed/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/230925_r43003_rd2.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65039124ebce12b0b0432eed/master/w_120,c_limit/230925_r43003_rd2.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65039124ebce12b0b0432eed/master/w_240,c_limit/230925_r43003_rd2.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65039124ebce12b0b0432eed/master/w_320,c_limit/230925_r43003_rd2.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65039124ebce12b0b0432eed/master/w_640,c_limit/230925_r43003_rd2.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65039124ebce12b0b0432eed/master/w_960,c_limit/230925_r43003_rd2.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65039124ebce12b0b0432eed/master/w_1280,c_limit/230925_r43003_rd2.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65039124ebce12b0b0432eed/master/w_1600,c_limit/230925_r43003_rd2.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;Every Thom Browne piece includes an accent of red-white-and-blue striped grosgrain, as a nod to the ribbons on the medals Browne won in his youth as a competitive swimmer.&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;A male ballet dancer wears a lavender sweater and skirt while balancing on the railing of a balcony.&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650368bc3731717dab8d71d2/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/230925_r43004.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650368bc3731717dab8d71d2/master/w_120,c_limit/230925_r43004.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650368bc3731717dab8d71d2/master/w_240,c_limit/230925_r43004.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650368bc3731717dab8d71d2/master/w_320,c_limit/230925_r43004.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650368bc3731717dab8d71d2/master/w_640,c_limit/230925_r43004.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650368bc3731717dab8d71d2/master/w_960,c_limit/230925_r43004.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650368bc3731717dab8d71d2/master/w_1280,c_limit/230925_r43004.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650368bc3731717dab8d71d2/master/w_1600,c_limit/230925_r43004.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;A look from Spring 2020.

I&#39;d worn shades of black and cream for my visit, but amid employees in uniform any color that wasn&#39;t gray seemed as obtrusive as flaming red. The British master milliner Stephen Jones, who makes headpieces for Browne&#39;s shows, noticed my baseball cap and asked, politely, if he might rid it of a smudge. Then he whisked it into another room to rub the brim down with a wet cloth.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Browne was standing in the middle of the fitting room, leaning against a marble table. He greeted me with a quick kiss on either cheek. Even in these surroundings, he stood out for the punctiliousness of his getup. He has a strong, square jaw and keeps his hair, now salt-and-pepper, in a tidy crewcut. He was wearing a tight sweater vest over his standard wrinkled oxford (“When everything is so well made, I think you need something that kind of throws it off a little bit so it&#39;s not so &lt;em>;precious&lt;/em>;,” he said of the wrinkles); on his muscular legs were snug wool shorts and a pair of Thom Browne knee socks. Browne&#39;s own approach to uniform is unvarying. A former swimmer, he runs eight miles a day; until a knee injury forced him to use a treadmill, he was known to jog around the Central Park reservoir in tailored shorts and a cashmere cardigan. Five years ago, he stopped wearing long pants altogether. He recalled that places like the Ritz in Paris and the Four Seasons in Milan used to give him a hard time for wearing shorts to dinner. “Now,” he said, “they always let me in.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Browne&#39;s runway presentations are known for their narrative sophistication, but his references, he told me, are often “more Bugs Bunny than Proust.” His settings are pulled from children&#39;s fables—an old-fashioned schoolhouse, an ice-skating rink, a pine forest filled with fake snow—often with a discomfiting twist. For his “Toy Story” collection, last year, he filled a room at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center with five hundred Steiff Teddy bears outfitted in his suits. A native of Allentown, Pennsylvania, Browne went to Catholic school until the seventh grade and served as an altar boy, and he has framed more than one collection around the theme of nuns and priests. For a show in 2012, he had his models emerge from coffins while a narrator told the audience that “they died for fashion.” Johnson Hartig, one of Browne&#39;s oldest friends and the founder of the fashion label Libertine, told me that although there is “something draconian and a little dystopian” about Browne&#39;s creative vision, “it&#39;s all done in a tongue-in-cheek, innocent kind of way.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;For the couture show, Browne had found inspiration in the opening lyrics of the song “Fade to Grey,” by the British New Wave band Visage: “One man on a lonely platform.” He described the show&#39;s protagonist, to be played by the Sudanese British supermodel Alek Wek, as “a girl who comes into a train station wearing a classic gray suit who is not so happy with her life.” The rest of the collection featured outfits representing various characters that the woman encounters on the railway platform, including luggage porters, gargoyles, a conductor, and a pair of high-fashion pigeons.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;One of the couture birds, played by a male model named Florian DesBiendras, wobbled in from the atelier in full costume, which included six-inch, heel-less cantilever shoes. Browne craned his neck. “God, you&#39;re so tall,” he said, giggling.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;For more than a decade, Browne has been in a relationship with Andrew Bolton, the head curator at the Metropolitan Museum&#39;s Costume Institute. When Browne was first developing the new collection, Bolton shared with him a time-honored rule of couture: garments should “look heavy and feel light.” The pigeon outfit consisted of a fitted turtleneck minidress made of a paillette fabric developed for Browne in Switzerland, and covered with hundreds of hand-tipped gray, green, and purple feathers. In a witty touch, a hand-felted skirt made to resemble a suit jacket was draped around the hips, with exaggerated shoulder pads that doubled as panniers.&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot;

Joining in, Browne put his hands behind his back and wiggled his fingers like tail feathers.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;mbq20g&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Later, Browne went over the show&#39;s soundtrack with his music supervisor. Along with the Visage song, the playlist included gloomy tracks from Björk and David Bowie and a pair of arias from the opera “Dido and Aeneas.” Browne likes to have his models walk slowly. Most fashion shows are under fifteen minutes; Browne&#39;s regularly go on for more than thirty. Critics sometimes complain about it, he said, “but I&#39;m, like, you know what? I spent so much on this. You&#39;re all gonna sit and enjoy it.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The music supervisor queued up the choo choo of a freight train, the clanging of an old-timey clock, and a chorus of pigeon coos. “Hey, I like to be cheesy sometimes,” Browne said. He had imagined sprinkling the stage at the Palais Garnier with handmade felt pigeon droppings—“They would have to be embroidered by Lesage,” Browne said, citing the legendary French needlework atelier—but had run out of time.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;It was &lt;em>;goûter&lt;/em>; hour in France. A publicist produced a spread that combined the glamorous and the mundane: a bottle of Dom Pérignon and a bag of plain potato chips. He poured the champagne into coupe glasses—Browne hates a flute—and the chips onto paper plates. Browne said that the idea for the combo had come from Marilyn Monroe&#39;s character in “The Seven Year Itch.” “Chips &lt;em>;always&lt;/em>; go with champagne,” he added, reaching for a plate.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Every Thom Browne piece includes a red-white-and-blue striped grosgrain ribbon as an accent, whether it&#39;s a tab hanging off the back of a collar or a ring encircling a shirt arm. It is meant as a throwback to the cheap ribbon necklaces on the sports medals that Browne won in his competitive-swimming days. The fourth of seven siblings from a tight-knit Irish-Italian family, Browne would wake up on school days as early as 4 &lt;em >;AM&lt;/em>;. to train. His younger sister Jeanmarie Wolfe recalled, “We all held each other accountable and we were all competitive, but we knew that Thom just had &lt;em>;it&lt;/em>;. We never worried about him. He always stayed the course.” (Today Wolfe, a lawyer in Allentown, wears head-to-toe Thom Browne to work nearly every day.) Browne became an all-American swimmer as a teen, and was recruited to Notre Dame&#39;s Division I team. “I grew up in a Speedo,” he recalled, when we met up in New York later in July, at Sant Ambroeus, an Italian café on Madison Avenue. “That regimen was always part of my day. I loved the organization of it, and the discipline.” Browne is still a creature of habit. Since he and Bolton moved to Sutton Place, on the far East Side, in 2021, he has gone to Sant Ambroeus each morning to pick up his to-go breakfast—a sugar croissant and an espresso. That day, he&#39;d agreed to dine in, at a red leather banquette. “This is new to me,” he said. His order remained the same.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Browne&#39;s father, James, a lawyer and accountant, worked at a financial-services firm and wore Brooks Brothers suits to the office. His mother, Bernice, who&#39;d met James in law school, stayed home with the kids and then, at fifty, passed the bar for a second time and went to work as a county solicitor. Browne thought he&#39;d follow a traditional corporate path. He graduated from college with a business degree and took a consulting job in New York City, but he hated it and quit in less than a year. Not long afterward, a friend, the British interior designer Paul Fortune, offered to let Browne stay in the guesthouse at his Los Angeles home. Browne took him up on the offer, and ended up living in LA for six years.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Fortune, who died in 2020, was known for his high-profile clientele—Sofia Coppola, Marc Jacobs, Aileen Getty—and for his patrician sense of style. Like Browne, he was a gay man who&#39;d gone to Catholic school. “He knew everybody,” Browne recalled. “And he had excellent taste. He was inspiring just to be around, to see how you could make your own life.” After two years, Browne moved into his own place, in Los Feliz. Many stories about Browne report that he spent his twenties as a “struggling actor,” but he laughed when I brought this up. He briefly studied with a drama coach and appeared in a few television ads. But he mostly supported himself as a production assistant and script reader. The one souvenir of Browne&#39;s short-lived show-business career, he says, is his British-seeming name. Because there was already a Tom Browne in the Screen Actors Guild, he started going by Thom.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Since his year in the corporate world, Browne had gravitated toward wearing suits—Brooks Brothers, like his dad. But in LA he began to develop a more distinctive personal style. He would scour vintage stores for classic men&#39;s pieces and have them altered at a local dry cleaner, raising the leg hems and truncating the sleeves. When asked about the inspiration for the look, Browne has cited memories of John F. Kennedy&#39;s slender suits. But in reality JFK often wore slouchy sack jackets and pants that broke over his shoelaces. The design “was this idea I had in my head, and I just had to get it out,” Browne said. He told me that he enjoyed the way his too-small suits “drove people crazy,” especially in laid-back LA He added, “I can&#39;t stand things that are very vanilla. I get bored by things that are just normal.”&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;A model poses in an elaborate blue gown while birds fly and perch around her.&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650368c2022245bfd87607b0/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/230925_r43009.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650368c2022245bfd87607b0/master/w_120,c_limit/230925_r43009.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650368c2022245bfd87607b0/master/w_240,c_limit/230925_r43009.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650368c2022245bfd87607b0/master/w_320,c_limit/230925_r43009.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650368c2022245bfd87607b0/master/w_640,c_limit/230925_r43009.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650368c2022245bfd87607b0/master/w_960,c_limit/230925_r43009.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650368c2022245bfd87607b0/master/w_1280,c_limit/230925_r43009.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650368c2022245bfd87607b0/master/w_1600,c_limit/230925_r43009.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;A “gargoyle” gown from Browne&#39;s couture collection features cascading layers of taffeta and satin.&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;p >;In 1997, he moved back to New York—“I had no money, and it was just scary,” he told me—and, through a friend, landed a job as a sales assistant at Giorgio Armani&#39;s wholesale showroom. Armani had revamped power suits in the eighties with loose, billowy silhouettes, and though the aesthetic wasn&#39;t to Browne&#39;s personal taste, he quickly became a top salesman. Around the same time, he befriended the designer Ralph Lauren&#39;s chief of staff and eventually met Lauren, who was looking for a new designer to develop menswear for his mid-level work-wear brand Club Monaco. Despite Browne&#39;s lack of training, Lauren hired him for the job. Browne tried to bring his own ideas to the brand—miniature cardigans, high-water pants—but “it wasn&#39;t right for them,” he recalled. “I couldn&#39;t give that stuff away. But I really loved it so much that I thought I should just be doing it myself.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Browne was not trained in sewing. To make suit prototypes for his own line, he needed to partner with an experienced tailor, but it was difficult to find one willing to use his bizarre specifications. After a stalled collaboration with a master tailor in Brooklyn, Browne connected with Rocco Ciccarelli, an old-school suit-maker in Queens, who agreed to make five sample suits (and went on to work as the head tailor for Browne until his retirement, in 2015). In 2001, at the age of thirty-five, Browne launched a made-to-measure business out of his one-bedroom apartment. He served as his own model, wearing the sample suits around town. He recalled that when he asked friends to purchase them “they were, like, &#39;Why would we want to buy something that doesn&#39;t even seem to fit &lt;em>;you&lt;/em>;?&#39; ”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Innovation in tailored menswear has historically taken place in what one critic described to me as “infinitesimal adjustments.” But by the turn of the millennium, with the rise in casual work wear, most men no longer had to buy a suit. The challenge was to make them &lt;em>;want&lt;/em>; to buy one, and designers were trying out increasingly daring ideas. Raf Simons, at his eponymous label, and then Hedi Slimane, at Dior Homme, produced sleek black suits that gave their wearers the look of louche indie rockers. Tom Ford, during his tenure at Gucci, introduced high-waisted velvet suits in sultry jewel tones. Browne&#39;s tapered design drew on codes of American conformity—the trope of the “man in the gray flannel suit”—but also quite literally undercut them. The result was something impish and a little bit kinky: all that male cleavage, out on display. Within the fashion world, Browne was initially considered an intriguing artist on the fringes. “It was &lt;em>;so&lt;/em>; small and &lt;em>;so&lt;/em>; custom and &lt;em>;so&lt;/em>; eccentric,” the veteran British fashion critic Tim Blanks recalled. “If somebody had told me this would be a half-a-billion-dollar business in twenty years, I would have laughed.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Browne gained an important ally when a friend introduced him to Miki Higasa, a brand strategist who&#39;d worked for Rei Kawakubo&#39;s avant-garde fashion house Comme des Garçons. Higasa had seen how a designer could make even the most challenging ideas legible to the public through repetition and persistence. She persuaded Browne to make a limited ready-to-wear collection in 2003, and soon afterward the operation moved into a small storefront in the meatpacking district. Higasa invited buyers to stop by, including Sarah Andelman, of the late trendsetting Paris boutique Colette, who placed an order for Browne&#39;s heavy oxford shirts and then, as she recalled, “had to keep reordering them.” A buyer from Bergdorf Goodman agreed to carry the collection. “They wanted to put it on the tailoring floor, and not on the third floor with the fashion,” Higasa recalled. “We said, &#39;This is not for the conventional guy.&#39; ”&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;a data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a27979-rd&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a27979-rd&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;“Hey its OK Frank.

He asked for a suit “exactly as I was wearing it, with no alterations,” Browne recalled; Bowie later donned it during a televised concert at Radio City Music Hall. Browne&#39;s look has since filtered into the mainstream. The rows of high-water pants in any Gap store owe a debt to his work, as does J. Crew&#39;s ubiquitous slim-cut Ludlow suit. Anna Wintour, the editor of &lt;em>;Vogue&lt;/em>; (and the global chief content officer of Condé Nast, the parent company of &lt;em>;The New Yorker&lt;/em>;), works closely with Bolton as the co-chair of the Met Gala and counts the couple among her good friends. She told me, of the Browne silhouette, “Now we accept it as being absolutely part of the fashion vocabulary. He completely changed the way we see.” One Browne staff member recalled that construction workers used to jeer at him when he walked down the street in his gray skirt. Today they just yell, “Hey, nice Thom Browne!”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;One of Browne&#39;s publicists had given me an official invitation to the couture show, which was printed on card stock as thick as a Wasa cracker and included a small square insert bearing the request “. 。 。 Please wear your best grey.” (Browne has a fondness for ellipses and prefers to spell “gray” the British way.) On the day of the event, the sky above the Palais Garnier&#39;s Beaux-Arts façade was a mottled, hazy apricot. Owing to the protests over the police shooting, armored guards stood around the building&#39;s perimeter. At the back entrance, I met one of Browne&#39;s lead publicists, Jonathon Zadrzynski—known as JZ—a skinny redhead wearing a full Thom Browne suit. I asked if he was roasting in the summer heat, and he shrugged. “We&#39;re used to it,” he said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Browne was inside in an airy rehearsal room with florid crown moldings and softly glowing globe lights. He stood quietly watching as two women added finishing touches to an ivory “gargoyle” gown that was hanging on a canvas dress form. There were two hours left until showtime.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;grat2t&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;“She wore gray!” Zadrzynski said to Browne, pointing to my outfit, a Rick Owens dress in a chalkboard hue.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;“And I thank you for that,” Browne said, flashing a smile. He walked over to another dress form to inspect a hulking trapezoidal blanket coat that his team had covered in ornate nautical embroidery—a sailboat, a lighthouse, conch shells, stalks of kelp. Sarah-Jane Wilde, a British American jewelry designer and former model, appeared suddenly from behind a rolling rack. “It&#39;s beautiful, Thom,” she said. A close friend and collaborator of Browne&#39;s, Wilde was wearing a custom black seersucker Thom Browne minidress with a matching cape. With her long black hair and her eyes painted with kohl and gold shimmer, she looked like a dapper Cleopatra.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“I&#39;m just here as a cheerleader,” Wilde said to me. “Thom kind of lives in his own world, of his own making. I call it the champagne bubble.” Glancing down at her outfit, she added, “That&#39;s why I&#39;d &lt;em>;never&lt;/em>; wear anything other than Thom. Why would you want to leave the bubble?”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Around the corner, in a hair-and-makeup room, the British makeup artist Isamaya Ffrench and her team were painting models&#39; faces with splotches of neon eyeshadow, inspired by Visage&#39;s New Romantic eighties look—the only pops of color in the show. Jordan Roth, a Broadway theatre producer and real-estate heir who had been cast as the other pigeon, sat in front of a vanity, sipping bottled water, as a makeup artist glued down his eyebrows. “The first piece Thom ever sent me was this exquisite &lt;em>;sculpture&lt;/em>;, with an hourglass shape and a codpiece,” he said. “The hyper-masculinized and hyper-feminized aspects went straight to my heart.” He swept one arm dramatically across the room. “It just makes sense that we are here now, because Thom is the &lt;em>;height&lt;/em>; of operatic fashion.”&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;A model dressed in red white and blue and holding an American flag emerges from a hole in the floor of an office.&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650368c83731717dab8d71d4/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/230925_r43008.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650368c83731717dab8d71d4/master/w_120,c_limit/230925_r43008.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650368c83731717dab8d71d4/master/w_240,c_limit/230925_r43008.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650368c83731717dab8d71d4/master/w_320,c_limit/230925_r43008.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650368c83731717dab8d71d4/master/w_640,c_limit/230925_r43008.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650368c83731717dab8d71d4/master/w_960,c_limit/230925_r43008.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650368c83731717dab8d71d4/master/w_1280,c_limit/230925_r43008.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650368c83731717dab8d71d4/master/w_1600,c_limit/230925_r43008.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;A look from Fall 2022. Browne&#39;s runway presentations are known for their narrative sophistication, but he describes his references as “more Bugs Bunny than Proust.”&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;p >;Guests had started to arrive, and some made their way backstage. Maisie Williams, a twenty-six-year-old British actress who played Arya Stark on “Game of Thrones,” carried an aquamarine Hector bag—one of Browne&#39;s most popular items, which is modelled on his eight-year-old dachshund of the same name and costs at least seventeen hundred dollars—and stroked it as if it were a real dog. Her outfit, a long pleated Wedgwood-blue skirt and boned corset, paired with a coördinating necktie, was the kind of thing a gentlewoman might once have worn to ride sidesaddle.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“I love the corset,” Williams said, placing a hand on her stomach, “because it&#39;s, like, nobody knows I just had a really big sandwich.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Browne had been calm through the previous days&#39; preparations, but as showtime drew nearer he seemed on edge. “Who is supposed to be watching you?” he asked a male model who was loitering out of formation in a bulky brocade jacket. He glanced at another model&#39;s latex thigh-highs, which were beginning to sag around the ankles. “Those don&#39;t look right,” he said. Wilde put her hands on my shoulders and gently steered me toward the exit.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Browne showed in Europe for the first time in 2009, at the venerated Pitti Immagine Uomo menswear exhibition, in Florence. During his presentation, which took place in the auditorium of a military school, forty men, all wearing cropped gray trousers and khaki trenchcoats and carrying black briefcases, walked out in single file and stood next to forty identical mid-century desks. A “boss” at the front of the room rang a bell, and the men sat down and began typing cacophonously on vintage Olivettis, calling to mind the opening scene of Billy Wilder&#39;s “The Apartment.” After several minutes, the men got up and each placed a red apple on the boss&#39;s desk.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Such imagery has led some observers to interpret Browne&#39;s collections as comments on American masculinity. Was Browne turning men into boys? Was he mocking the white-collar worker by making him look cramped in a suit he&#39;s on the verge of outgrowing? The fashion critic Cathy Horyn, writing about another of Browne&#39;s early runway shows, called him the “anti Ralph Lauren,” suggesting that whereas Lauren&#39;s vision of American life was expansive—Gatsbyesque gents in a classic roadster, a couple on a gleaming catamaran—Browne “seems to see a culture shrinking to the point of implosion.”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;feature-large-callout&quot; >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;GroupCalloutWrapper&quot;>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;A look from Spring 2020 features a starfish codpiece.&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6503912f107e3b742cc43d1d/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/230925_r43006_rd2.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6503912f107e3b742cc43d1d/master/w_120,c_limit/230925_r43006_rd2.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6503912f107e3b742cc43d1d/master/w_240,c_limit/230925_r43006_rd2.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6503912f107e3b742cc43d1d/master/w_320,c_limit/230925_r43006_rd2.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6503912f107e3b742cc43d1d/master/w_640,c_limit/230925_r43006_rd2.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6503912f107e3b742cc43d1d/master/w_960,c_limit/230925_r43006_rd2.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6503912f107e3b742cc43d1d/master/w_1280,c_limit/230925_r43006_rd2.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6503912f107e3b742cc43d1d/master/w_1600,c_limit/230925_r43006_rd2.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;A look from Spring 2020 features a starfish codpiece.&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;A model lies on the floor in a yellow beaded dress beside a large decorative swordfish.&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650368cd25274af116db7ff1/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/230925_r43007.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650368cd25274af116db7ff1/master/w_120,c_limit/230925_r43007.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650368cd25274af116db7ff1/master/w_240,c_limit/230925_r43007.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650368cd25274af116db7ff1/master/w_320,c_limit/230925_r43007.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650368cd25274af116db7ff1/master/w_640,c_limit/230925_r43007.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650368cd25274af116db7ff1/master/w_960,c_limit/230925_r43007.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650368cd25274af116db7ff1/master/w_1280,c_limit/230925_r43007.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650368cd25274af116db7ff1/master/w_1600,c_limit/230925_r43007.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;A gown from Spring 2019 evokes a mermaid with beaded shells at the bodice.&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Browne told me that he struggled, at first, to find a “balance between the conceptual and the commercial.” Menswear has experienced an “unprecedented boom” in recent years, according to Business of Fashion, an industry Web site. But by some estimates it constitutes only around thirty per cent of fashion-industry revenue. Menswear designers who want to expand their customer base—and who don&#39;t want to work for a legacy fashion house—often move into women&#39;s wear, accessories, fragrances, and other categories that make up a so-called life-style brand. Browne got a foothold in fashion&#39;s mainstream by collaborating with blue-blooded heritage labels. For five years, beginning in 2007, he designed a capsule collection at Brooks Brothers, called “Black Fleece.” The collection&#39;s suits, at around twenty-five hundred dollars, were almost double the price of the company&#39;s traditional suits (and about half the price of those made under Browne&#39;s own label). In 2009, Browne also designed a collection for the ski outfitter Moncler, featuring lapelled puffer coats and beanies in red, white, and blue. But in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis Browne&#39;s business almost collapsed, and he pivoted toward more traditional paths to financial stability. In 2011, with an investment from a Japanese wholesale distribution company, he launched his first women&#39;s line, with plaid skirt suits and grosgrain-trimmed capelets. His company now operates more than a hundred retail stores around the world.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Browne told me that he “hates trends,” but the ascendancy of his brand coincided with a revived interest in preppy style, spurred in part by the popularity of the TV shows “Gossip Girl” and “Mad Men.” Starting in the two-thousands, Polo Ralph Lauren and Lacoste saw a surge in sales, and J. Crew experienced a revitalization under the leadership of the designer Jenna Lyons (who wore Thom Browne to this year&#39;s Kentucky Derby). Like those brands, Thom Browne cannily drew upon the iconography of Ivy League style. From the beginning, as a nod to vintage varsity sweaters, Browne adorned many of his pieces with a trio of white stripes. When, in 2008, the sportswear giant Adidas sent him a cease-and-desist letter, accusing him of stealing its three-banded logo, Browne simply added a fourth stripe. (The problem seemed resolved until he launched a line of eight-hundred-dollar sweatpants and hoodies. Adidas sued for copyright infringement, in 2021, and lost a trial earlier this year. Browne made the news for wearing shorts every day to court.)&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;ma45hs&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Many wealthy consumers today have embraced “quiet luxury”; it is considered déclassé to use visible branding to prove that you paid thousands for your cashmere slacks. Thom Browne is as pricey as such understated brands as Loro Piana or Brunello Cucinelli, but Browne&#39;s designs are relatively aggressive about calling attention to themselves. Lauren Sherman, a fashion-industry correspondent for the media outlet Puck, told me that Browne&#39;s signatures have become as recognizable as the logos of far more profitable brands. “You know instantly when someone is wearing Thom Browne,” she said. The gray suit was once the ultimate cloak of anonymity. Browne has turned it into a badge of conspicuous consumption.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The couture show involved a clever bait and switch: guests were funnelled through the back door of the Palais Garnier and, unbeknownst to them, onto the main opera-house stage. The red velvet proscenium curtain was lowered. A large gray bell made of tulle and wrapped in red-white-and-blue grosgrain hung from the rafters, and several dozen felt pigeons were scattered around the felt-covered floor. On each seat lay a cigarette-size paper scroll, like the message a carrier pigeon might deliver, bearing the line “A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush . 。 .”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The actress Diane Keaton was seated in the front row, wearing a pale-gray Thom Browne three-piece with a matching bowler hat. (Later, in an e-mail, Keaton called the show “astonishing,” adding, “You know me, I love a man&#39;s suit.”) Emma Chamberlain, a Gen Z influencer, stood nearby in an écru Thom Browne laced corset, which she described as “not exactly comfortable.” She confessed that she was dying to take one of the stuffed birds home. “Pigeons are my favorite animal,” she said. “And rats.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;A few feet away, in a navy Thom Browne sheath dress, was the twenty-seven-year-old actress Ayo Edebiri, a star of the hit TV series “The Bear.” The show&#39;s creator, Christopher Storer, is a Browne devotee, and last season Edebiri&#39;s character, a professional cook, received a one-of-a-kind Thom Browne chef&#39;s jacket as a gift. Edebiri had told Browne how breathable it was underneath the hot lights of the set. “He thought that was really funny, because he was, like, &#39;I&#39;m not so known for making things that are functional,&#39; ” she recalled. (After the episode aired, Browne was flooded with requests for kitchen gear. “We&#39;re holding out for Jean-Georges,” he quipped.)&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The show was supposed to begin at five, but at twenty past guests were still milling about. A woman in uniform explained, “We&#39;re waiting for Cardi B. I guess she&#39;s stuck in traffic.” A few minutes later, Cardi made her entrance, wearing a tweed dress in a wiggle style and a foot-high gold filigree headdress. Soon the house lights dimmed. A swelling string overture played from the speakers, followed by a sound effect of thunderous applause. Then the curtain at the front of the room rose to reveal the two thousand red velvet seats of the opera house, each occupied by a cardboard cutout of a figure wearing sunglasses and a Thom Browne suit. The sea of deadpan faces was both spooky and hilarious—what better way to deliver a packed house than to print one? Audience members gasped and then began to applaud along with the soundtrack. Wintour told me later that she considered the stunt, which cost nearly a hundred thousand dollars, to be “one of the largest storytelling moments in Paris.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;During the next thirty minutes, more than fifty looks paraded down the runway. Alek Wek emerged first, wearing a plain Thom Browne suit and a head scarf. She sat onstage, on a piece of luggage, and remained there for the rest of the presentation, making eye contact with each model passing by. The collection was a kind of self-retrospective, but with Browne&#39;s usual motifs carried to elaborate extremes. A series of coats had a plaid pattern—a Browne staple—that was made not with preprinted fabric but by crisscrossing colored threads through tiny glass beads. His typically kitschy nautical themes were pushed into riskier, more grotesque territory. One striped blazer featured a puffy golden lobster whose embroidered claws came up over the shoulders, as if it were trying to drag the model underwater. Browne had strayed from his monochrome palette in previous collections—his 2022 styles included sumptuous evening jackets in mustard, lavender, emerald, and cantaloupe—but his couture looks were nearly all in shades of gray. The effect was to attune the eye to subtle contrasts—the way a gown juxtaposed shiny pewter satin with matte taffeta in a similar hue, or a pair of sequinned ombré trousers changed from charcoal at the hip to faintly ashen at the hem.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;feature-large-callout&quot; >;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;All Thom Browne employees must adhere to the persnickety dress code that Browne calls “uniform.”&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650368cf25274af116db7ff3/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/230925_r43005.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650368cf25274af116db7ff3/master/w_120,c_limit/230925_r43005.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650368cf25274af116db7ff3/master/w_240,c_limit/230925_r43005.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650368cf25274af116db7ff3/master/w_320,c_limit/230925_r43005.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650368cf25274af116db7ff3/master/w_640,c_limit/230925_r43005.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650368cf25274af116db7ff3/master/w_960,c_limit/230925_r43005.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650368cf25274af116db7ff3/master/w_1280,c_limit/230925_r43005.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650368cf25274af116db7ff3/master/w_1600,c_limit/230925_r43005.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;All Thom Browne employees must adhere to the persnickety dress code that Browne calls “uniform.”&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Couture shows traditionally end with the designer&#39;s take on a wedding gown. Browne&#39;s bride, the supermodel Grace Elizabeth, doubled as the train coming into the station. She glided down the center aisle, wearing a beaded, sheer white garment that looked like a tuxedo jacket whose hem was melting to the floor. Two men in swim caps carried the train of the dress. From far away, the piece shimmered as if made of shaved ice. Browne told me later that his team had worked eighteen-hour shifts for three straight weeks to finish it on time. In one hand, Elizabeth carried a large leather clutch in the shape of a steam locomotive. It was as if Browne were daring an overcooked gag—a train on a train on a train—to detract from the sombre mood of the proceedings. The fashion critic Amy Fine Collins told me afterward, “There are always moments in Thom&#39;s shows where you have to laugh. And typically you &lt;em>;never&lt;/em>; laugh at a fashion show.” (Browne told me that, beneath the gown, Elizabeth was wearing a pair of panties decorated with a bejewelled crab. “The joke is self-explanatory,” he said.)&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Some designers are interested in exalting the person wearing their creations. The late Alber Elbaz, who made elegantly draped women&#39;s gowns for Lanvin, said, “I&#39;m not trying to transform anyone, I&#39;m just trying to make everyone, as much as I can, a better version of themselves.” Browne, by contrast, has been criticized for his punishing demands on models—the impossibly high shoes, the agonizingly slow processions under heavy layers of wool. In the past, he has obscured models&#39; faces or tied their hands behind their backs. Browne told me, “Sometimes I like it when my clothes negate the person. Not because I don&#39;t respect the guy or girl wearing them.我愿意。 But I really want to see a fully fleshed-out idea.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The morning after the show, Browne was back in his showroom on Avenue Montaigne to receive private clients. Compared with the lively makeshift atelier upstairs, the space was hushed and austere. Stepping off the elevator, guests were greeted with the scent of a single Thom Browne vetiver candle sitting on a teak desk. When I entered the display area, where the couture pieces had been artfully arranged on mannequins and rolling racks, an employee asked me if I wouldn&#39;t mind placing my handbag (gray, but not Thom Browne) in the back room.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;A man whom one employee called the brand&#39;s “biggest client in Mexico” came through, wearing a suit printed with a “Moby-Dick”-inspired toile, from the new fall ready-to-wear collection. Sharon Coplan Hurowitz, an art adviser and New York socialite, was there in jodhpurs, but the night before her ensemble had been more “Alice in Wonderland,” including a tilted-teacup headpiece by Jones balanced precariously atop her head.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Marisa Hunt, one of Browne&#39;s “client-relations managers,” arrived with Chris Sunahara, a thirtysomething Google executive and self-professed “Thom Browne obsessive” who was wearing a gray Browne suit with added tuxedo tails. Sunahara told me that he discovered Browne&#39;s suits after losing a significant amount of weight and feeling liberated to try new ways of dressing. “I remember thinking, OK, this stuff is expensive, maybe I&#39;ll buy a T-shirt,” he said. But the completeness of Browne&#39;s uniform can serve as a potent sales tactic. Doing it halfway would be more unfashionable than not doing it at all. “You have to have the shoes and the suit and the glasses—everything down to your feet,” Sunahara said. “That&#39;s how they get you.” In less than a year, he had bought more than sixty pieces.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Listen, as a gay male, you &lt;em>;dream&lt;/em>; of fashion, and I could never fit in this stuff,” he said, his voice growing shaky. “When you wear Thom Browne, you get so much attention, and it&#39;s kind of nice to give that energy when you walk down the street.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“That is making me feel all the feels,” Hunt said, handing Sunahara a coupe glass of champagne.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Sunahara approached an ivory gown that Browne had described to me as his “mermaid sashimi dress,” featuring metallic breasts and scales on the front and a jagged golden fish skeleton running down the back. I learned later that it was priced at sixty thousand dollars.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;51a6r5&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;“Oh, my God,” Sunahara said, passing his hand over the brocade. He asked if Browne might consider making a version for him with a six-pack instead of breasts. “Like a mer&lt;em>;man&lt;/em>;,” he added.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;He left the showroom empty-handed, but the next day he returned to order a new made-to-measure Thom Browne suit.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Despite living with an eminent fashion historian, Browne is not steeped in fashion history, and prefers it that way. He doesn&#39;t make mood boards for his collections, choosing instead to transmit his vision to his team through conversation. “Andrew approaches things very intellectually,” Browne told me. “I&#39;m more just instinctual.” At one point, remarking on the use of lobster imagery in his designs, I brought up Elsa Schiaparelli&#39;s famous 1937 lobster dinner dress. “I wish I didn&#39;t know about that,” Browne said, adding that he finds it “crippling” to be aware of what other designers have done.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Some critics have tried to dissect Browne&#39;s work in relation to his biography—his thigh-baring shorts as a queer statement, for example—but he resists such connections. “I love gay men, and straight men, and gay women, and straight women,” he told me. He tries to stay away from political debates as well. He dressed Michelle Obama for the 2013 Presidential Inauguration and said in 2018 that he would be equally open to working with Melania Trump. When I asked him about this comment, which provoked consternation at the time, he replied, “What I said was that I respect the office of the First Lady. I would hope most people are proud to be American.”&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;A plaid ensemble with feathered shorts from Fall 2011.&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650368d209d49c7c04e6daa1/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/230925_r43013.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650368d209d49c7c04e6daa1/master/w_120,c_limit/230925_r43013.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650368d209d49c7c04e6daa1/master/w_240,c_limit/230925_r43013.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650368d209d49c7c04e6daa1/master/w_320,c_limit/230925_r43013.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650368d209d49c7c04e6daa1/master/w_640,c_limit/230925_r43013.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650368d209d49c7c04e6daa1/master/w_960,c_limit/230925_r43013.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650368d209d49c7c04e6daa1/master/w_1280,c_limit/230925_r43013.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650368d209d49c7c04e6daa1/master/w_1600,c_limit/230925_r43013.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;A plaid ensemble with feathered shorts from Fall 2011.&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;p >;Browne&#39;s reticence can seem at odds with his growing public role in American fashion. Last January, he replaced Tom Ford as the chairman of the Council of Fashion Designers of America, the trade organization that represents four hundred US designers and oversees New York Fashion Week. When he first assumed his CFDA position, he sent out a note to his fellow-designers saying that although he supported their endeavors “in spirit,” he would not be attending any of their shows in person that season—he would be busy “challenging myself to create something memorable.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;One afternoon in August, I visited Browne and Bolton at their home, a Georgian-style mansion that was built a century ago for the heiress Anne Harriman Vanderbilt. I was greeted at the entrance by Browne and a fusillade of high-pitched barking from Hector, who was bounding around Browne&#39;s feet. The dog, who has his own Instagram account and often wears a miniature Thom Browne sweater, might be the most famous pet-muse in fashion since Karl Lagerfeld&#39;s cat Choupette.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“He&#39;s a real &lt;em>;schweetie&lt;/em>;,” Browne said, scooping him up and giving him a scratch on the chin.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Browne and Bolton&#39;s taste in décor is a mix of the ornate and the severe. When they renovated, they painted the bright-blue front door black. The foyer features a black-and-white marble checkerboard floor and a large bronze cupid sculpture by Augustus Saint-Gaudens. In the dimly lit dining room, paintings of Jesus and four decorative urns created the atmosphere of a rectory.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;We went out onto the back terrace, which overlooked an enormous lawn stretching down to the East River. From this angle, the water looked like a private lido. A publicist brought out several chilled mini-bottles of Perrier and crystal goblets engraved with the logo of the Ritz Paris.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Bolton, a native of Lancashire, England, is pale and trim, with floppy gray hair and angular cheekbones. His outfit had an air of après-tennis: a gray-and-white striped Thom Browne T-shirt with Browne sneakers and socks. As he sat down next to Browne, he noted, a bit sheepishly, that his shorts were Ralph Lauren. “I would say ninety per cent of my wardrobe is Thom,” Bolton said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Hey, I like the shorts,” Browne said. “I do think Andrew has good style. We reference it so often in the office—&#39;How would Andrew wear it?&#39; ”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Browne and Bolton first met at a fashion conference in 2005, but Bolton told me that he had been aware of Browne&#39;s work for some time before. “I was in London working on a project with Savile Row tailors, and I remember them being completely up in arms about him,” Bolton said. “I suppose the first I heard of Thom was as a travesty to tailoring.” He went on, “You know, I think that was sort of a homophobia, because at first it was so associated with fashionable gay men wearing this particular suit. Maybe it still is.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Like Browne, Bolton grew up middle class and had no education in fashion. He studied anthropology at the University of East Anglia and curated East Asian art at the Victoria &amp;amp; Albert Museum before arriving at the Met, two decades ago. More than one person I spoke to referred to Bolton and Browne as American fashion&#39;s reigning power couple, and it&#39;s clear that their positions reinforce each other; the Met Costume Institute&#39;s 2021 exhibition “In America: A Lexicon of Fashion,” curated by Bolton, included two Thom Browne suits in a pantheon of looks that have defined a national style. But the men told me that they still see themselves as industry outsiders and that their friends, for the most part, “are not fashion people.” They attend the Met Gala every year, but when I asked whom they like to entertain at home Bolton let out a small laugh. “No one,” he said. He recalled that when Wintour first came over she said, “Why did you buy such a pretentious house? You never have anybody over. It&#39;s just going to be you and Thom rattling around.” In their free time, the pair like to order in and watch old movies. (Neither likes to cook.)&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Many critics have seemed pessimistic lately about the state of the American fashion industry. Whereas New York was once a hub of global fashion—particularly in the eighties and nineties, when designers like Marc Jacobs, Donna Karan, Oscar de la Renta, and Calvin Klein were all showing in Manhattan—the industry&#39;s center of gravity has since shifted to Europe. The Row, New York&#39;s quintessential quiet-luxury brand, recently moved its production operations to Italy. Perhaps the buzziest show of the year, the American musician Pharrell Williams&#39;s début as the men&#39;s creative director for Louis Vuitton, took place on the Pont Neuf, in Paris. The US ecosystem “has taken a bit of a walloping,” Tim Blanks, the fashion critic, told me, adding, “When Thom first arrived on the scene, there was a real sense of dynamism, and I haven&#39;t felt that in some time.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Browne said that his goal with the CFDA was to guide young American designers toward thinking about “longevity,” as opposed to following flash-in-the-pan trends or the tides of social media. “The most important thing I can do is just lead by example,” he said, adding, “I didn&#39;t know how to sustain this business at the beginning, but then I did. And no one can really help you but yourself.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The two men showed me a forthcoming coffee-table book on Browne&#39;s work, edited by Bolton. He had spent a year pulling hundreds of looks from Browne&#39;s archive, and had written an introductory essay about the history of the color gray.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Andrew selected everything,” Browne said. “He said to me once, which I think is very true, that designers are the worst at curating their own work.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;He got up from the table, prompting Hector, who had been snoozing underfoot, to bolt upright.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Want to go out and bark, Hecky?” Browne said, moving toward the back door. “He&#39;s horribly trained.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“He &lt;em>;can&lt;/em>; be very friendly,” Bolton said. “When we are on the street, he always runs up to men in gray suits.” ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;feature-large-callout&quot;

>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;On a Saturday afternoon in August, while the Red Sox were trouncing the Yankees in the Bronx on the way to a series sweep, members of the Baseball Project, a supergroup that sings about baseball, were settling into the greenroom of the Sinclair, a small venue in Cambridge, Massachusetts, not too far from Fenway Park. The night before, they&#39;d performed in Brooklyn—Yankees territory, more or less. “They were yelling for &#39;The Yankee Flipper,&#39; ” Scott McCaughey, one of the band&#39;s guitarists and singers, said. He was referring to a ballad he wrote about the time Jack (Black Jack) McDowell, the former Yankees ace, got drunk with members of REM—including McCaughey and one of his Baseball Project bandmates, Mike Mills. “Sorry,” McCaughey joked in the greenroom. “We don&#39;t know how to play that anymore.” McCaughey is a Giants fan. “You get sick of hearing the Yankees doing so great all the time,” he said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“You don&#39;t have to worry anymore,” Linda Pitmon, a Yankees fan and the band&#39;s drummer, said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The Baseball Project also includes another former member of REM, Peter Buck, along with Steve Wynn, the singer and guitarist who leads the Dream Syndicate. The group was born at a party the night before REM was inducted into the Rock &amp;amp; Roll Hall of Fame, in 2007. Wynn recalled that he and Pitmon, who are married, met McCaughey there, and they started talking about their shared baseball obsession.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“I&#39;d met you before,” McCaughey interrupted.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“In the men&#39;s room in a Seattle club,” Wynn clarified.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Scott and I, each unbeknownst to the other, had the idea of someday writing a few songs or an entire album about baseball,” Wynn continued. They began to discuss it, and within a week they&#39;d swapped several songs. A few months later, they had a whole album, “Volume One: Frozen Ropes and Dying Quails.” That was fifteen years ago. In the meantime, REM broke up.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;The Baseball Project has just come out with its fourth album, “Grand Salami Time!,” produced by REM&#39;s old producer Mitch Easter and recorded at his compound in North Carolina. They play mostly on small stages, although they often throw out the first pitch or sing “The Star-Spangled Banner” before ballgames. When the group had a night off in Boston a few years ago, Josh Kantor, the organist at Fenway, who has toured with the band, took them behind the scenes of the Red Sox&#39; ancient bandbox. Pitmon rolled around in the warning-track dirt in front of the Green Monster.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“I was, like, &#39;Oh, man, what&#39;s it like to play at, you know, an eighty-thousand-seat football stadium?&#39; ” Kantor recalled asking Mills. “He&#39;s, like, &#39;What&#39;s it like to play at the World Series?&#39; And I was, like, &#39;Oh, right. That actually is really cool.&#39; ”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Mills once invited Kantor to join their fantasy team—they play in a league with other indie musicians, including Stephen Malkmus, from Pavement, and Ira Kaplan, of Yo La Tengo—but warned him that he would have to take it seriously. Kantor knew that Mills meant it, and declined.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;McCaughey usually wins the league, though every member of the band is competitive—except for Buck. “I&#39;ll be in the van back there, and it&#39;s like fantasy whatever—”&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;“Fantasy baseball,” McCaughey said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“ &#39;Oh, this guy has a &lt;em>;groin pull&lt;/em>;,&#39; ” Buck went on.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Buck doesn&#39;t follow sports. “He&#39;s our token non-baseball man,” Wynn said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“I like all these people and I like the songs,” Buck explained. He does appreciate what he calls baseball&#39;s “old characters”: “They were like Wild West gunfighters. They were weird, you know, in a way that&#39;s now impossible.” He went on, “They were like rockabilly stars or rhythm-and-blues stars, except that they were wearing a uniform and hitting a little ball.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;These days, the money is bigger and any weirdness is under wraps. The band doesn&#39;t shy away from the game as it is now—there&#39;s a song about Shohei Ohtani, and a sly take on doctored balls (“Just like Brylcreem, a little dab will do ya / I use that LA look to try and fool ya”)—but it can be a struggle to come up with material. “A lot of the current players are kind of boring,” McCaughey said. “They don&#39;t drink and carouse like they used to. I mean, probably for a good reason.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The big themes persist, in baseball and in music. Wynn was on a solo tour, staying in a run-down hotel outside Buffalo, when Buck sent him the music for the song “Journeyman.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“It was great music,” Wynn said. “I went, Yeah. A guy goes town to town, just does the best he can, and does something pretty well so he can keep working. And I can write a song like that.” ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;9wacu4&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;9vsaf&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 18 Sep 2023 19:06:01 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
