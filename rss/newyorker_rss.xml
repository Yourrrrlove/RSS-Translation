data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;这是赎罪日的奇迹！周日晚上，经过五个月的艰苦纠察线后，好莱坞编剧与制片厂达成了一项初步协议。细则仍在敲定中，一旦协会领导层批准，该协议将被发送给美国作家协会会员进行批准投票。截至周一，WGA 仍在正式罢工，但不再设置纠察队。好莱坞还远未恢复正常：代表演员的&lt;em>;SAG-AFTRA&lt;/em>;仍在罢工，这意味着大多数有剧本的电视和电影的制作仍处于搁置状态。&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;但还有很多值得庆祝的事情。 WGA 谈判委员会向其成员保证，这笔交易是“特殊的”。据报道，它在薪资、编剧室的最低人员配置要求、收视率透明度和热门节目的经济奖励以及人工智能使用的监管等方面取得了重大进展。当 5 月 1 日谈判破裂时，其中许多问题都无法解决。编剧们很快就在派拉蒙、Netflix 和迪士尼的办公室外游行，用主题纠察队（布鲁斯·斯普林斯汀日！）和巧妙的标志来鼓舞自己。当演员们在七月中旬加入他们时，纠察线变得越来越大，也越来越繁星。八月，随着好莱坞&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/notes-on-hollywood/scenes-from-hollywoods-hot-labor-summer&quot;>;炎热的劳工夏天&lt;/a>;的过去，WGA 和制片厂试图重新启动谈判，但谈判因泄密和不信任而破裂。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;劳动节来了又去，好莱坞的情绪发生了变化——在我认识的作家中，疲倦的坚韧变成了陷入一种恐慌。这种情况要持续多久？面对惨淡的秋季，工作室也感受到了巨大的压力。但战斗并未平息；当德鲁·巴里摩尔（Drew Barrymore）和比尔·马赫（Bill Maher）宣布他们将在没有工会编剧的情况下恢复脱口秀节目时，遭到的反对声音如此之大，以至于两人都退缩了。然后，上周三，双方再次会面。这次，各大娱乐公司的首席执行官，包括迪士尼的鲍勃·艾格和华纳兄弟探索公司的 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/annals-of-communications/can-david-zaslav-make-it-在好莱坞“大卫·扎斯拉夫”亮相。谈判代表连续开会五天，并就第二天如何再次会面发表了简短的联合声明。谣言四起，公会成员们都提心吊胆。周日，这笔交易的消息传来，洛杉矶响起了集体欢呼声。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;早在四月份，当罢工迫在眉睫时，我&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker. com/culture/notes-on-hollywood/why-are-tv-writers-so-miserable&quot;>;与一些电视作家交谈&lt;/a>;，了解为什么他们的职业状况变得如此可怕。其中一位名叫劳拉·雅克明 (Laura Jacqmin) 的作品包括 Epix 的《Get Shorty》和 Peacock 的《Joe vs. Carole》，她告诉我，“如果我们现在不深入挖掘，三年后就没有什么可争的了。”她补充道，“我会用的词是‘绝望’。” ” 罢工号召后，Jacqmin &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/tnyradiohour/segments/wg-strike-shows-go-dark&quot;>;在《纽约客》上加入了我&lt;/a>;广播一小时阐述了 WGA 的要求，在此期间她一直担任罢工队长。周一早上，洛杉矶黎明时分，我再次与她交谈。我看得出来，她的情绪仍然很原始。她是这样说的：&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“有一种压倒性的宽慰和喜悦的感觉，我想我们很多人仍在处理它带来的震惊。周四晚上，公会给所有人发了电子邮件，说：“明天出来参加纠察队。”我们需要看到您的支持。这真的很重要。而且在积极讨价还价的过程中，他们还是第一次提出这样的具体要求。我已经很疲惫了。那周我已经出去纠察了两天了。那天晚上我觉得我做不到。然后在上午 9 点，我就想，好吧，我走了。我要去。我得出现。&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;“在路上的车里，我在想，如果今天是罢工结束的日子，会是什么样子，然后是我们在纠察线上的时候发生的吗？我立刻在车里泪流满面。我无法控制它。我必须停下来——我必须很快控制住自己，因为我正在开车。我必须上高速公路。我不得不去亚马逊。但那只是——当时我感到不知所措。从周五开始，你就只是看着时钟、查看电子邮件、查看社交媒体、查看新闻，然后等待。而且，现在它就在这里，它是巨大的。太大了。&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >; “然后我们整个星期都在得出这个结论，所以，你知道，周三、周四、周五、周六、周日。每一天都是：这可能是交易发生的一天。这可能是罢工结束的一天。这种严酷的折磨已经连续五天了。昨天，我什至发了推文，我想大概是五点四十五分左右，比如，我们没有必须遵守的“第五天日落之前”的童话规则。只是温柔地提醒一下，工作室设定的任何截止日期都是虚假的截止日期。我们不必遵守它。如果今天没有达成协议，那么将会达成协议。也许他们周一就会起飞。也许他们会在周二重新聚会。只是试图在不可能的情况下给气氛带来一些平静。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“因此，当事情真正爆发时，我比一般会员早了八分钟得到这个消息。太平洋时间昨晚 7:04&lt;em>;PM&lt;/em>;，Captains 收到了一封来自公会[会员组织高级主管]Ann Farriday 的电子邮件。我简直不敢相信。我简直不敢相信。抱歉，我哽咽了——这太疯狂了。我去了厨房。我拥抱了我的男朋友。我说，‘伙计，我还是很生气，但我不敢相信我们在这里。我不敢相信一切都结束了。看？作为一种延迟反应，我现在变得情绪激动。&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“昨晚 Twitter 很棒，因为每个人都在发帖。整个过程都很棒，但每个人都热情高涨。而且确实有很多人出去了。我本来不想开车四十分钟到山谷去 Idle Hour [WGA 成员庆祝的酒吧]，但有一些 &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://x.com/jenyamato/ status/1706191692263751973?s=20&quot;

; 在一个只有十分之一居民的乡村小镇里，可以容纳两千多人。外人可能认为声音是“&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2006/04/24/the-ecstatic-truth&quot;>;Fitzcarraldo&lt;/a>;”和&lt;a href= “https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2010/06/07/night-at-the-circus&quot;>;太阳马戏团&lt;/a>;。但数以千万计的人——像我阿姨一样的基督徒，以及非信徒——都参加了视力与健康中心。过去四十年来，在宾夕法尼亚州以及后来在密苏里州布兰森开设的第二个地点都有声音表演。该剧团曾演出过《亚伯拉罕和撒拉——爱的旅程》、《大卫的诗篇》、《看哪羔羊》、《但以理——梦想、巢穴、拯救者》、《圣诞奇迹》和《以斯帖王后》。 ”不过，《诺亚方舟》是他们的标志性作品，你可以想象为什么——水流湍急，满载动物的方舟穿过过道来到舞台上。布兰森的一块“诺亚”广告牌吸引了英国摄影师杰米·李·泰特 (Jamie Lee Taete) 的注意，这位族长的名字漂浮在他的歌斐木容器旁边，两者都框出了一些相关但不敬的信息：“&lt;em>;回归一季”仅&lt;/em>;！”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot;

aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/ div>;&lt;p>;一条细线可以将真正的信仰与巧妙的花招区分开来，研究 Taete 的画可以让你羞于自己画这样的线。在密苏里州迦太基的珍贵时刻教堂和花园，泰特为俄克拉荷马城阿尔弗雷德·P·默拉联邦大楼爆炸中丧生的 19 名儿童拍摄了纪念馆。他的照片充满了聚光灯和阴影，中心是一个哭泣的儿童消防员的巨大雕像，他抱着一个襁褓中的幼儿，脚边放着烧焦的玩具。背景中可以看到暗淡的出口标志和投币游戏机。就像之前的 MJ Hummel 人物或 Meissen 雕塑一样，Precious Moments Company, Inc. 大规模销售的艺术品具有独特性和收藏价值：眼睛水汪汪，调色板柔和，所有人物都天使般而孩子气。自十九世纪七十年代以来，该公司已将睡前故事、餐桌祈祷、圣经寓言和小狗友谊等甜蜜场景转变为陶瓷、贺卡、纸板书和动画特辑。你心软的祖父可能会在一年的圣诞节送给你一个他们的小雕像，或者你多愁善感的婆婆可能会用他们的壁挂装饰她的客用浴室。但是，即使您从未亲眼目睹过他们的一件不可思议的创作，您也可以轻松想象一个人的畏缩如何可以成为另一个人的崇高。&lt;/p>;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;feature-default&quot;

>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;有人曾经告诉我，这个世界上没有什么比恐龙更世俗的了，但显然白垩纪时期及其之前的时期是伟大的神创论者的担忧&lt;/a>;，他们迎接挑战，捍卫他们对化石记录的创世记的字面解读，但似乎也明白孩子们喜欢爬行动物，越大越好。泰特曾表示，他对在他参观过的一些地方花钱感到不舒服——不是因为东道主不好，而是因为他的入场费正在为他们的使命做出贡献。在俄克拉荷马州伍德沃德的恐龙公园里，一张讽刺性的照片显示，一个孩子骑在剑龙背上，泰特除了时间之外什么也没花。不过，正如他所记录的那样，在其他地方，访客的收益将用于推动更广泛的事工，包括为图书馆收集有关“教科书中的谎言”的书籍或印刷诸如“救命！”之类的小册子。我正在学习进化！&lt;/em>;”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot;

data-testid=&quot; BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;正如那个场景提醒我们的那样，试图戏剧化过去，无论是基督教的还是其他的，并不是什么新鲜事。前几代信徒以各种方式传播福音，不仅通过史诗电影，还通过壁画、抒情诗和广播节目，因此现代进入路边景点和主题公园不应该如此刺耳。但事实确实如此，正如泰特在《基督教旅游》中一再向我们展示的那样。他捕捉到了这些站点和工作人员无法控制地打破性格的一些方式：被钉在十字架上的基督被传输塔和缠结的电线遮住了，一个戴着头盔和束腰外衣的年轻演员吃着一片披萨，一个超大的高速公路十字路口与菲利普斯 66 号加油站的大帐篷相比显得相形见绌。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;当然，从某种意义上说，基督教，至少按照我们中的一些人的理解，当它真正为人所知时，它总是令人震惊：当世界自私时慷慨，当文化喜欢讽刺时真诚，即使面对敌意也充满爱心。看待“基督教旅游”的廉价而简单的方式是带着娱乐和自信的居高临下；毫无疑问，许多人会用评判和蔑视的眼光看待它。但还有一种不同的方式，我认为摄影师本人至少在其中一些旅游陷阱中经历过，那就是认真对待它们对大多数参观者有意义的事实。看照片——或者说看世界——这样可能是最真正的基督教旅游，而且你足不出户就可以做到。&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot;

Though they also said that about ayahuasca and moving to New York, and both of those just gave me diarrhea. But I went ahead and did the damn thing, so if you&#39;re one of these twenty-nine-and-belows considering it, but have reservations, read on to find out if being thirty is right for you.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;You&#39;ll own more cleaning products.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;At almost any hour of the day, you&#39;ll be overwhelmed with the urge to Google if there&#39;s a better way to deep-clean your rug, pan, or ceiling fan. You&#39;ll scour Reddit threads then traverse the dark Web to find a DIY soap recipe that rehashes seventh-grade science. A guy swears by Elmer&#39;s glue mixed with vinegar and chicken bouillon to get out wine stains, and you&#39;re absolutely going to try it.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;There&#39;s more silence.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Once you cross the line from twenty-nine and eleven months to the age no TikTok influencer dares utter aloud, there will be a sudden drop in the number of loud people in your inner circle. The people you once associated with who operate at a higher average decibel, yelling freely about their rash at Bonefish Grill, will simply disappear from your life.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;Emily Mariko will become a lot more interesting.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Food influencers used to exist in the periphery of your consciousness. Now you&#39;ll have the contents of their fridges memorized and their recipes bookmarked. You&#39;ll regularly marinate meat, sprinkle herbs, and text your friends air-fryer recipes. They&#39;ll beg you to limit your quota to one per day, but you won&#39;t listen. Eight minutes to make salmon?! This is the next industrial revolution. The world needs to know.__&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;Your plants will stay alive.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;If pots of basil could unionize like the orcas, they would overthrow you immediately for all of their kin you killed. But things will be different now. You&#39;ll be home way more. It&#39;s pretty nice there! The temperature is exactly right. There&#39;s no forced conversation, there&#39;s free parking, and you finally have time to water that basil.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;The sex will get better.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Whether it&#39;s because your standards (and protein intake) are higher or because the peer-reviewed toy you got on Amazon now gets charged more than your phone, the mid-orgasms you were having in your mid-twenties are over. Also, the way you give orders now? You&#39;d make a great lieutenant.&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;You will no longer care what Phil thinks.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Phil is that cool guy you once cared about impressing because he would stay out until 4 &lt;em >;AM&lt;/em>; He was always pouring shots and telling edgy “jokes.” But over the years you&#39;ve realized that Phil kind of sucks—he&#39;s not very dependable and has way too many opinions on “The Little Mermaid.” So screw Phil.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;You will turn down wedding invitations.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;And you won&#39;t even come up with a good reason. Your decision-making skills will no longer be impaired by a desperate thirst to be liked by all. “No” will slip out of you like a sneeze when someone suggests a standing-room-only concert. You&#39;ll meet a new person and the first thing they&#39;ll do is trauma dump. When you were younger, you admired their vulnerability. Now half a minute in, you&#39;ll excuse yourself because you&#39;re not Brené Brown.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;You will look hotter.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;No, for real. Now you know what looks good on you, and it is &lt;em>;not&lt;/em>; a romper.从来都不是。 You&#39;ve figured out how to layer, and that a side part doesn&#39;t work for your hexagonal face shape. You floss and eat more spinach. It&#39;s actually embarrassing how much you like spinach!&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;You&#39;ll be sleepy all the time.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;It&#39;s crazy that the minimum age for a President is thirty-five because no one should have to run a country when they&#39;re so sleepy. Every time you encounter a problem, you&#39;ll think, Let&#39;s nap this out. And you will. In between work meetings; even &lt;em>;during&lt;/em>; work meetings. Honestly, mostly during work meetings. Sometimes you&#39;ll be sleepy and your digestive system will simultaneously be combusting. This is, like, when a Marvel movie has too many villains. But you&#39;ll nap it out, at home, with your thriving basil. ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;mrikbe&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot;

She was often confused with another prominent political writer, Naomi Wolf—once a feminist on the left who has, in recent years, embraced conspiracy theories on the right and is now on good terms with Steve Bannon.

” Klein argues that the left and the right have become doppelgängers of one another—and that denialism regarding climate change has widened to any number of topics, including the claim that Joe Biden is dead and is being played by an actor. “Whenever you don&#39;t like reality, you can just say that it&#39;s not real,” she says.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot;

With a great shaggy beard and muscles the approximate size and color of ripe pumpkins, he was part cowboy, part Conan the Barbarian. “I&#39;m Brian Johnson,” he said in his third Instagram video. “My family and tribe call me Liver King.” He is the owner of Ancestral Supplements—which sells desiccated organ meat in capsule form—and a walking marketing campaign.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Within eight months, the Liver King had amassed a million and a half followers on Instagram and nearly three million on TikTok. He was mellow at first, but he embraced the new persona, growing crasser and more meme-worthy, and less clothed. (On a podcast in March, 2022, he said that the Liver King “broke out of his cage, and he fucking ate Brian Johnson.”) Most of his videos centered on eating meat, lifting heavy stuff, and doing punishing, unorthodox workouts. His body, he said, was all natural, the product not of steroids but of exercise and eating animals.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The Liver King&#39;s premise, a familiar one by now, is that we are mismatched with the modern world and that many of our problems can be solved by reconnecting with long-lost ways. He insists on nine ancestral tenets. These include reasonable suggestions like “sleep,” “move,” and “bond,” but, as he once explained, “if I tell you all nine, you don&#39;t remember anything.” Instead, he boiled his recommendations down to one: “I say, &#39;Eat liver, because liver is king.&#39; ” The best-selling, stand-alone product on ancestralsupplements.com is Grassfed Beef Liver.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The craze for eating the way our ancestors did is nothing new; it has been more than two decades since the exercise physiologist Loren Cordain published “The Paleo Diet: Lose Weight and Get Healthy by Eating the Food You Were Designed to Eat” (2001), helping launch a billion-dollar industry. But the Liver King, along with a crew of other “meatfluencers,” has pushed paleo to an extreme of carnivory. They maintain that humans evolved to kill animals similar in size and constitution to domesticated cattle, to devour their organs (often raw), and to eat vegetables only in the most desperate of circumstances.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Forget the leaves and fibrous tubers, we&#39;re going hunting!” Paul Saladino (IG followers: 1.6M) writes in “The Carnivore Code,” the closest thing the new movement has to a manifesto. He asserts that “this approach appears to be &lt;em>;exactly&lt;/em>; what our ancestors did.” (Saladino co-owns a supplement company, Heart &amp;amp; Soil, with the Liver King.) According to “The Carnivore Code,” plants are poison—they don&#39;t want to be eaten, and have, as a result, evolved defensive chemicals designed to disrupt your digestion. Likewise, in “The Carnivore Diet,” Shawn Baker (IG followers: 319K) says that the most efficient way proto-humans got protein and calories was “to take down a big, fatty, energy-filled megafaunal animal.” They may have nibbled on the occasional fruit or nut, he admits, but the time and energy needed to get the same payoff would have been “greater by at least an order of magnitude.” The Liver King himself came up with the pithiest tagline: “Why eat vegetables when you can eat testicles?”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The notion of the meat-loving ancestor has a history. In the nineteen-fifties, the anatomist Raymond Dart, famous for discovering the first authentic fossil of an early African hominin, advanced what became known as the “killer ape” theory. Hunting, Dart thought, made us human. Our furry forebears climbed down from the trees to gorge on “the more attractive fleshy food that lay in the vast savannahs of the southern plains,” he wrote in the book “Adventures with the Missing Link” (1959). Elsewhere, he described the earliest hominins as “confirmed killers: carnivorous creatures that seized their quarries by violence, battered them to death, tore apart their broken bodies, dismembered them limb from limb, slaking their ravenous thirst with the hot blood of victims and greedily devouring livid writhing flesh.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The killer-ape theory seeped into the mainstream. In 1955, Dart, then based at the University of the Witwatersrand, met the playwright Robert Ardrey, who was in South Africa for a reporting trip. Like a convert seeing the holy truth, Ardrey came away transformed. He was convinced that “the predatory transition” not only made us human but also explained what he described as “man&#39;s bloody history, his eternal aggression, his irrational, self-destroying inexorable pursuit of death for death&#39;s sake.” Ardrey was inspired to write the “Nature of Man” series, a set of books about human nature and evolution, published between 1961 and 1976. &lt;em>;Time&lt;/em>; later named “African Genesis,” the first in the series, the most notable nonfiction book of the sixties. It was cited as an influence on Stanley Kubrick&#39;s film “2001: A Space Odyssey” (1968), whose opening sequence showed primate violence as a turning point in the development of our species.&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;As Ardrey and Kubrick popularized the killer ape, anthropologists started to review the evidence. In 1966, at a meeting remembered in anthropological lore as the beginning of hunter-gatherer studies, seventy-five experts assembled in Chicago to synthesize our knowledge about foraging peoples. More than ninety-nine per cent of human history was spent without agriculture, the organizers figured, so it was worth documenting that way of life before it disappeared altogether. The symposium—and an associated volume that appeared two years later, both titled “Man the Hunter”—exemplified an obsession with hunting, meat-eating, and maleness. “Man” was meant to cover all humans; “hunter” was shorthand for anyone who subsisted on wild food. The book devoted an entire section to the role of hunting in human evolution. “Hunting is the master behavior pattern of the human species,” a chapter began. “It is the organizing activity which integrated the morphological, physiological, genetic, and intellectual aspects of the individual human organisms and of the population who compose our single species.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;The meeting also revealed problems with the meat-centric story. Dart had asserted that “all prehistoric men and the most primitive of living human beings are hunters, ie, flesh eaters.” But contributors to “Man the Hunter” showed how one-sided this perspective was. The anthropologist Richard Lee reported that the !Kung, one of the so-called Bushman people of Southern Africa, got two-thirds of their calories from plants. Nor were they an exception. When he compared fifty-eight foraging societies from around the world, Lee found that half got the majority of their calories from plant foods; another eighteen relied mostly on fishing. Only eleven—less than a fifth—relied on hunting as their primary means of subsistence, and all but one were limited to either the highest or the lowest latitudes, far beyond our African homeland.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Since the publication of “Man the Hunter,” scientists have incorporated genomic as well as new archeological and paleontological methods into the study of diets from deep history. “The details differ and it&#39;s easy to get lost in the weeds, but the overarching message from each is clear: we evolved as opportunistic omnivores,” Herman Pontzer, an evolutionary anthropologist at Duke University, writes in his recent book, “Burn.” It includes a takedown of paleo-style tropes, including carnivory. “Humans eat whatever&#39;s available, which is almost always a mix of plants and animals (and honey).”&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Pontzer shows just how far the consensus has shifted. Dart had insisted that &lt;em>;Australopithecus&lt;/em>;, an early group of human ancestors, gulped down blood and guts, and yet scratch patterns on their molars suggest that they were lovers of tubers. Our more recent forebears ate plants, too, including ones vilified by paleo advocates. Consider Neanderthal diets, which Rebecca Wragg Sykes covers in vivid detail in “Kindred: Neanderthal Life, Love, Death and Art.” Neanderthals certainly ate big beasts; sites are filled with the bones of butchered bison and red deer—there are even indications that they took down mammoths. Yet Neanderthals living in warm, wet environs had tooth-wear patterns similar to those of agricultural peoples who eat lots of fibrous plants. Further evidence has come from investigating Neanderthals&#39; dental calculus—that is, from probing their plaque. Shortly before he died, an individual known as Shanidar 3 consumed dates, a lentil-like plant, and an unidentified tuber or root. The remains of two adults found in Belgium had traces of grasses and water-lily-root starches, suggesting that they had foraged for plant food. A sample from El Sidrón, in Spain, had no large-mammal DNA, but it turned up matches for pine, mushroom, and moss. Scattered morsels of prehistoric diets reveal an enduring taste for veggies.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;No controlled studies have been published that validate the extravagant health claims made for the carnivore diet, but the meatfluencers are undeterred. In “The Carnivore Diet,” Shawn Baker lists eczema, depression, and fibromyalgia as “ailments that seem to respond positively to the carnivore diet.” The psychologist Jordan Peterson claims that a regimen of beef, salt, and water sharpened his thinking, cleared up his psoriasis, and eliminated his gum disease; his daughter, Mikhaila Peterson, insists that the same diet, supplemented with lamb, bison, and the occasional vodka or bourbon, cured her arthritis. In “The Complete Carnivore Diet for Beginners: Your Practical Guide to an All-Meat Lifestyle,” by Judy Cho (IG followers: 99.8K), carnivory is presented as a powerful remedy, with potential for alleviating depression, inflammation, eating disorders, and autoimmune issues.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Living off flesh alone is not easy, though, and Cho lays out suggestions for how to survive. Too much lean protein can cause problems, so make sure at least seventy per cent of your calories come from fat. Too little mastication can lead to constipation, so try to chew each piece of meat twenty to thirty times. Carnivores tend to have messed-up thirst cues, so drink more often than might feel natural. If you don&#39;t like meat, stop snacking until you&#39;re so hungry that it becomes appealing. To ease the transition, Cho offers various weeklong meal plans, along with helpful tables of permissible items and their nutritional statistics.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Some meatfluencers stress that human beings are animals and maintain that, if allowed to eat according to our animal instincts, we will favor a meaty menu. But the biologists David Raubenheimer and Stephen J. Simpson have been investigating animal alimentation for more than thirty years, and their new book, “Eat Like the Animals,” suggests that the meatfluencers have it all wrong. The authors started collaborating at Oxford, studying the eating preferences of locusts (grasshoppers, basically). First, they found that locusts preferred a certain ratio of carbohydrates to protein. When forced to live on foods higher in carbs and lower in protein, the insects ate a lot, becoming obese, and took longer to molt to adulthood. Conversely, when put on the insect version of the Atkins diet, they ate far fewer calories and were less likely to make it to adulthood. Second, they found that locusts with a decent food selection always ended up with near-identical ratios of protein and carbohydrates. “It&#39;s as if, regardless of whether we were offered meat and pasta, or egg and bread, or beans and rice, or fish and potatoes, we always consumed the exact same balance of protein and carbs.” The critters somehow track which nutrients are in which foods.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;These findings aren&#39;t limited to insects. Raubenheimer and Simpson have since determined that the pattern is widespread across the animal kingdom, from beetles to baboons. And they have found that protein-loaded diets don&#39;t just age animals; they kill them faster. “Our sexy, lean mice who ate high-protein, low-carb diets were the shortest lived of all,” they wrote of research published in 2014. “They made great-looking middle-aged corpses.”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;1bp5t8&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Raubenheimer and Simpson find possible lessons here about human metabolism. As ultra-processed foods become stripped of protein, we behave like their protein-deprived locusts, becoming bloated on carbs. The elimination of fibre exacerbates the problem, they write, removing a brake that would otherwise slow eating, fill our stomachs, and curb hunger. At the same time, their work implies a Faustian allure to keto, carnivory, and other protein-heavy regimens. Cutting out carbs may make us skinnier and accelerate tissue development, shifting our bodies into a “growth and reproduction pathway.” But this comes at the expense of longevity. Repair and maintenance systems are sidelined. Misfolded proteins and other cellular junk accumulate. Pushed into overdrive, the body falters.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;According to Raubenheimer and Simpson, two canonically healthy populations—the Okinawans, in Japan, who become centenarians at five times the rate of the rest of the developed world, and the Tsimané, of the Bolivian Amazon, who have the lowest incidence of cardiovascular disease ever recorded—consume diets that are, respectively, just nine and fourteen per cent protein. Most of their calories come from fibrous starches, such as plantain, cassava, or sweet potato. Raubenheimer and Simpson don&#39;t propose that readers become Japanese islanders or remote Amazonians, and although they present suggested protein intakes, they warn against following them too strictly. Instead, they advise cutting out ultra-processed foods; finding good sources of fats, proteins, and fibre-loaded carbs; and listening to your appetite (unless you crave savory snack foods, which, they point out, trick the body into thinking that it&#39;s getting protein when it&#39;s not). “Our appetites are better gauges than our calculators,” they conclude.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Is it possible that the meatfluencers are only a muscly manifestation of a larger awareness—that our food system is failing us? In “Eating to Extinction,” Dan Saladino, who&#39;s no relation to the carnivore Paul, urges readers to “consider what the past can teach us about how to inhabit the world now and in the future.” Taras Grescoe&#39;s “The Lost Supper” argues, similarly, that when it comes to the plants and animals we&#39;ve subsisted on for generations “the way forward lies in reviving them, cultivating them, herding them, and consuming them.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;For Grescoe and Saladino, the crisis of modernity is not, as many meatfluencers insist, an excess of seed oils, carbohydrates, and plant-defense chemicals but a collapse of diversity. Grescoe takes the reader to a twenty-three-thousand-year-old site in eastern Africa, where foragers once feasted on twenty species of mammal, sixteen families of bird, and nearly a hundred and fifty kinds of nuts, seeds, fruits, and legumes. He transports us to Çatalhöyük, a bustling Neolithic settlement in Anatolia, where the fare included sheep, goats, wild cattle, wild boars, waterfowl, and an impressive array of plant foods, such as plums, figs, acorns, almonds, hackberries, pistachios, and wild mustard.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;It may look as if modern diets are wonderfully varied, both Grescoe and Saladino argue, but by historical standards they&#39;re not. As a species, humans once ate thousands of plant foods, but only a hundred and fifty are cultivated at scale for food today, three of which—rice, wheat, and maize—constitute fifty per cent of all calories. Even within that trio, diversity is crumbling. In the twentieth century, American-grown hybrid corn came to account for fifty per cent of globally traded maize. Thousands of local varieties have been displaced. The result was a boom in calories but also a more fragile food system, as was made clear when a fungal blight ruined a billion bushels of American maize in 1970.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;For opponents of meat eating, this loss of diversity is a call to arms. In “No Meat Required: The Cultural History and Culinary Future of Plant-Based Eating,” Alicia Kennedy says that campaigns against ingesting flesh are about “claiming biodiversity and rebuilding the food system in a way that supports culture, tradition, and gastronomy.” Their argument comes down to an ecological observation: it takes about a hundred times more land to produce a calorie of lamb or beef than it does to produce a plant-based alternative. Given that half the world&#39;s ice- and desert-free land is used for agriculture, shifting to a fully plant-based diet would unlock vast resources. By one estimate, agricultural land use around the world would decrease by about three billion hectares—roughly four times the area of the continental United States.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;How do members of the carnivore crew respond? Some, like Judy Cho and Paul Saladino, argue that the consensus is wrong and that, as Cho says, “cows may be the way to save the planet.” They blame environmental devastation on such factors as grain monocultures and crop-driven deforestation—never mind that some eighty per cent of farmland is used for livestock feed. Others take up a vaporously ideological form of opposition.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Consider the shtick of Raw Egg Nationalist (X followers: 182.8K), a right-wing conspiracy theorist who dispenses “red-pill fitness” to his fans. “The enemy today is what I like to call &#39;soy globalism,&#39; ” he explained on Tucker Carlson&#39;s 2022 Fox special “The End of Men.” “The globalists want you to be fat, sick, depressed, and isolated—the better to control you and to milk you for as much economic value as they can, before they kill you.” His solution aligned nationalism and masculinity: strong men build strong nations, which defend against soy globalism. “And that&#39;s where raw eggs come in. Eggs are a superfood, packed with protein, fats, vitamins, minerals, anabolic cholesterol—the absolute opposite of the disgusting rubbish the globalists want us to eat.” He didn&#39;t end at eggs. If it has cholesterol, it qualifies: “That means butter, that means red meat, organ meat, eating liver, drinking raw milk, eating raw-milk products.” He warned, “Eating a low-fat vegetarian diet is about the worst thing you can do. It just tanks testosterone.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;On December 1, 2022, after incriminating e-mails were shared online, the Liver King released a video on YouTube titled “Liver King confession . 。 。 I lied.” Bare-chested and seated on what looked like a throne, he told the camera, “Yes, I&#39;ve done steroids. And, yes, I&#39;m on steroids.” He defended himself by returning to the issues that inspired him to preach the ancestral tenets. “Our people are hurting at record rates, with depression, autoimmune, anxiety, infertility, low ambition in life. Our young men are hurting the most, feeling lost, weak, and submissive.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Pore over materials on carnivory and the overwhelming impression is that men are endangered. They were once strong. They lived with nature and had stone-hard chests. They killed or were killed.但现在不再了。 Now they are either scrawny or obese. They have plummeting sperm counts and middling testosterone levels. “Alexander the Great conquered the world at age 25,” posted Carnivore Aurelius (IG followers: 717K), an anonymous meme-maker who dances between satire and sincerity. “The average 25 year old today has a panic attack if they leave their vape at home. WTF happened to men?”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Men, we read more and more, are falling behind. Just seventy-four men finish college for every hundred women. The model of a provider who supports a family through mostly physical labor is a diminishing prospect. Because meat is linked to manhood, carnivory promises a way to pump up a shrivelled birthright.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The Liver King understood this from the start. His very first video was ostensibly about a Paleolithic life style, but it looked like an ad for masculinity. It starred a semi-nude Viking hurling a spear, throwing a heavy ball, and benching a barbell with thick chains hanging down. It featured lightning, a bonfire, raw meat sliced with a chef&#39;s knife, and a marinated lamb chop thrown on a grill. There were symbols of status and wealth throughout, from the landscaping to the lavish home gym.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Carnivory conjures up an Edenic past that contrasts with our current discontents: a mythical time when men were manly and bodies were fit and food was real and natural. Cleanse yourself of modern corruption, it urges, and the world and your body will be renewed. You will be strong. Your family will be healthy. The land will recover. In “The Carnivore Code,” Paul Saladino describes the zone you inhabit when consuming a meat-only diet as “Zion,” “Shangri-La,” and “the Promised Land,” a “verdant” coastline where you can hunt “healthy ruminants” drinking from “clean, flowing streams.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;It&#39;s familiar terrain. The most successful diets of the past half century benefitted from similar marketing. Alluring additives are poisoning our bodies, their advocates insisted. Freedom and vigor come from purging them, from reënacting the lifeways of make-believe ancestors. When, in the nineteen-seventies, Nathan Pritikin championed a high-carbohydrate, low-fat regimen, he and his co-authors claimed that it was “an accident of civilization” that Americans had such easy access to fat and cholesterol. “Primitive people” were “more likely to be near-vegetarians,” he asserted. When Robert Atkins promoted the opposite approach—carbohydrate restriction as the key to good health—he stressed that “the food you eat when you do Atkins is surprisingly close to what our primitive ancestors ate.” And in “Diet for a Small Planet” (1971), perhaps the most important tract in favor of meatless eating ever published, Frances Moore Lappé told her readers that she advocated “the return to the traditional diet on which our bodies evolved.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Fad diets are perfectly manufactured to spread. They appeal to dissatisfaction. They provide crude explanations for why things are going wrong. And they tap into an intuitive logic at the center of spiritual traditions—that the greater the sacrifice, the greater the redemption. Yet fad diets also doom themselves. The same features that fuel their popularity—their quick-fix nature, their severe and often harmful restrictions—are what make them unsustainable for many.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;You even see this happening within the culture of carnivory. When the podcaster Joe Rogan went on a carnivore diet, in 2022, he ate fruit with his meat. The Liver King espouses a “nutrient-dense, nose-to-tail diet” while openly consuming potatoes and maple syrup. Yet the most dramatic turnabout occurred with Paul Saladino himself. Since publishing “The Carnivore Code,” he has acknowledged the benefits of carbohydrates. He now incorporates fruit, honey, and kefir into his daily fare, and this spring he changed his social-media handles from versions of @CarnivoreMD to @PaulSaladinoMD. In true Paleolithic fashion, even meatfluencers struggle to resist the pull of plants. ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 25 Sep 2023 19:06:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Inside Sam Bankman-Fried’s Family Bubble]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/10/02/inside-sam-bankman-frieds-family-bubble]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-25T10:00:00.000Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650c8f60460686e02830654b/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/231002_r43094.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;article >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attribute-verso-pattern=&quot;article-body&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;ArticlePageChunks&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;figure data-testid=&quot;IframeEmbed&quot; >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;IframeEmbedContainer&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;iframe height=&quot;90&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; sandbox=&quot;allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups&quot; title=&quot;Embedded Frame&quot; data-src=&quot;https://audm.herokuapp.com/player-embed?pub=newyorker&amp;amp;articleID=650b0be0fa4b870beece95e5&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay *; encrypted-media *; clipboard-write; autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture&quot;>;&lt;/iframe>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;p >;The Magistrates Court of the Bahamas, in Nassau, is situated in an imposing pink-and-white building edged with palm trees. On December 13, 2022, Sam Bankman-Fried, the former CEO of the now bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange FTX, arrived there to ask for release on bail after being indicted on eight criminal charges. Bankman-Fried typically wears T-shirts and shorts, no matter the occasion; on this day, he wore, like armor, an ill-fitting navy-blue suit. He&#39;d spent the previous night in jail, where he hadn&#39;t been given the medication he normally took for his depression. But of greater concern was the indictment, unsealed that morning in the United States, which accused him of fraud, conspiracy to commit money laundering, and other crimes that could lead to more than a hundred years in prison.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The evening before, he and a colleague had been working on their laptops in the oceanfront penthouse of a resort where he lived when his parents, who were visiting, called him into a bedroom. Minutes later, according to the colleague, a group of Bahamian law-enforcement officers, accompanied by members of the resort&#39;s staff, strode into the apartment. One officer had a warrant for Bankman-Fried&#39;s arrest.&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;When the officers entered the bedroom, Bankman-Fried asked for a drink of water and seemed to gird himself for what was ahead. “I can give you my passport,” he told a broad-shouldered officer, who in turn suggested that he might want to bring a jacket with him. Passing his phone, wallet, and college class ring to the colleague, whom he&#39;d asked to try to keep his parents calm, Bankman-Fried raised his wrists to be cuffed.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Now, as the court hearing got under way, his parents, Joseph Bankman and Barbara Fried, sat in the third row, feeling shattered. Bankman told me later, “I think most parents would much rather die, frankly, than see their child accused of such horrible things.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Bankman and Fried have long been popular faculty members at Stanford Law School, and known for their involvement in liberal causes. When Sam, their firstborn, was a child, they recognized him as being intellectually exceptional and emotionally atypical—an often isolated boy who entertained himself with baseball statistics and math puzzles. In his twenties, Sam achieved international fame as the head of FTX, a crypto company that he co-founded in 2019, and that promised to bring a measure of legitimacy to a nascent industry sometimes associated with money laundering and corruption. He shared a stage with Bill Clinton and Tony Blair, made the covers of &lt;em>;Fortune&lt;/em>; and &lt;em>;Forbes&lt;/em>;, and persuaded a range of prominent venture-capital investors to give his company hundreds of millions of dollars. Ten months before his arrest, FTX was valued at thirty-two billion dollars. A partner at Sequoia Capital, one of FTX&#39;s biggest financial backers, posited in an online profile of Bankman-Fried, since deleted, that he might become the world&#39;s “first trillionaire.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The academic community in which Bankman-Fried was raised is a place where immense wealth is often discussed with suspicion, even when privately courted. But Bankman-Fried stood out from other young billionaires for his commitment to the effective-altruism movement, some of whose adherents believe in trying to earn as much as possible in order to maximize what they can give away. By the time of his arrest, he had become a major contributor to public-health and other causes, and one of the biggest personal donors in American electoral politics.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;His parents come from modest backgrounds and have lived in the same house—a one-story bungalow on the Stanford campus—since the nineties; they describe themselves as “utilitarian-minded.” As academics, Bankman and Fried share an interest in using tax law as an instrument of social fairness. When Sam and his younger brother, Gabriel, were growing up, there was an ongoing household conversation about what it means to conduct an ethical life, and the brothers later worked together on philanthropic ventures that Sam funded. (Gabriel declined to be interviewed for this article.) As Larry Kramer, a former dean of Stanford Law School, told me, Bankman and Fried “loved that their children had these commitments that were so idealistic and powerful.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The rewards of being Sam&#39;s parents were financial as well as reputational. In 2022, he gave them a gift of ten million dollars; a lawsuit filed by FTX&#39;s bankruptcy estate against Bankman and Fried this September claims that the money was “plunder[ed]” and came from an account that contained customer funds. Their attorneys said that the lawsuit&#39;s claims are “completely false.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Bankman and Fried visited Sam in the Bahamas frequently, sometimes staying at a sixteen-and-a-half-million-dollar, thirty-thousand-square-foot beach house in a gated community. In December, 2021, Bankman took leave from Stanford to work full time at FTX, providing legal, philanthropic, and tax advice for a salary of two hundred thousand dollars a year, plus expenses. Those expenses included twelve-hundred-dollar-a-night “hotel stays,” the lawsuit alleges.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“I&#39;m in on crypto because I want to make the biggest global impact for good,” Bankman-Fried said in an ad that ran in &lt;em>;The New Yorker&lt;/em>;. Like other crypto evangelists, he professed a belief in the power of digital currencies and blockchain technology to eliminate corporate middlemen from the financial system and provide life-changing economic opportunities to the poor. He also relied on slick advertising to do the talking. In one commercial, a plumber realizes that he, too, can make bank in crypto with FTX, and the football legend Tom Brady says, conspiratorially, “You in?”&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;In March, 2022, a month after an extravagant Super Bowl ad starring Larry David (with Bankman-Fried&#39;s father hamming it up in the background in a powdered wig) told viewers not to miss out on FTX&#39;s crypto, the Federal Reserve began raising interest rates, in part to combat inflation. As money became more expensive to borrow, the value of many cryptocurrencies plummeted. Regulators and reporters began revealing that companies in the industry had been lending money to one another in a closed loop to prop up the value of their assets. The allegation that Bankman-Fried created his own closed loop in order to deceive investors and the public is at the crux of the government&#39;s case against him.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In addition to owning FTX, Bankman-Fried owned the majority of a crypto hedge fund called Alameda Research, which was run by Caroline Ellison, a trader whom he sometimes dated. On November 2nd, CoinDesk, an industry news site, reported that Alameda held almost fifteen billion dollars in cryptocurrency assets, a large chunk of which was in FTT—a digital token that FTX had issued. The disclosure raised questions about the true value of Alameda&#39;s holdings and about the conflict of interest between the two supposedly independent companies. Changpeng Zhao (generally known as CZ), the CEO of Binance, a crypto competitor, wrote a series of skeptical tweets indicating that he was dumping his FTT. Alarmed, FTX customers withdrew six billion dollars in just three days. By November 8th, FTX was so broke it stopped honoring withdrawal requests.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;zqibiu&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Some of Bankman-Fried&#39;s employees quit, and he huddled with those who remained, trying to calm investors and raise money to save the company. Meanwhile, a former FTX employee told me, “the parents were freaking out and asking, &#39;What about your legal safety?&#39; ”&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot;

The new CEO, quickly installed, was John Jay Ray III, a bankruptcy lawyer who had overseen the dissolution of Enron; he filed for Chapter 11 and began the process of formally winding FTX down.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Shortly after Bankman-Fried&#39;s arrest, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission said in a lawsuit that he&#39;d caused the loss of more than eight billion dollars in customer assets. Among those reported to be affected were Tom Brady; his ex-wife, the supermodel Gisele Bündchen; the basketball star Steph Curry; the billionaire oil investor Robert Belfer; the tennis star Naomi Osaka; the former Trump spokesman Anthony Scaramucci; a teachers&#39; pension fund; and many ordinary investors, including construction workers, small-business owners, and college students.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In Magistrates Court, Bankman-Fried stared straight ahead as his attorney argued for his release while his extradition was negotiated, noting that he had stayed put and tried to “fix things” for customers when he could have fled the country. A local prosecutor countered that Bankman-Fried was a flight risk, with the means to charter a private plane. When the prosecutor referred to Bankman-Fried as a “fugitive,” his mother laughed darkly. Bail was denied, and eight days later he was extradited to the United States.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Bankman-Fried&#39;s trial is scheduled to begin in New York in early October, and until recently he was preparing for it while under house arrest in California, at his childhood home, which is surrounded by redwood trees and cacti. His parents were back to taking care of him and working to bolster his spirits, as they&#39;d done when he was a child, but now they were also scrambling to find legal escape routes from circumstances they say they had failed to anticipate: that their son, now widely considered a crypto villain, would be facing life in prison, and that they would be accused of being complicit.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;For years, Bankman and Fried have hosted lively Sunday-night dinner parties at their home, during which discussions range from the global crisis of democracy to movies and campus gossip. In December, after a New York judge set their son&#39;s bail at a quarter of a billion dollars, their home was pledged as security for his release. Two friends also served as guarantors: Andreas Paepcke, a computer scientist at Stanford, pledged six figures, as did Larry Kramer and his wife, Sarah, who has since died. In part because Bankman and Fried had been so supportive when Sarah was going through cancer treatments, Kramer told me, “I said yes before Joe even finished asking.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;When I visited the family earlier this year, a security guard they&#39;d hired to comply with the bail terms was sitting outside the house in an SUV, asking visitors to leave their telephones and other electronic devices in their cars. Inside, Bankman-Fried, wearing an ankle bracelet, had commandeered his mother&#39;s study. “It&#39;s mostly case prep,” he told me, gesturing toward two computer monitors. “I mean, there&#39;s not a lot else that I can be doing.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;At thirty-one, he in many ways still looks like a boy: pale and soft with dark eyes and wild, curly hair, which on that day was flat in the back where he had slept on it. The desk at which he sat was cluttered with packs of cinnamon gum, fidget spinners, a mini-fan, deodorant, and a bottle of Adderall. (He was diagnosed as having ADHD, in addition to depression, years ago.) As we spoke, he jiggled his knee and shuffled and reshuffled a deck of cards.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The government alleges that Bankman-Fried engaged in fraud and embezzlement of customer deposits beginning in 2019, and spent those funds on travel, real estate, speculative investments, personal enrichment, and political campaigns. The government further alleges that he “caused” the creation of loopholes in FTX&#39;s computer code which allowed Alameda, his hedge fund, to borrow money that effectively belonged to customers, and that he conspired to bribe at least one Chinese official with forty million dollars to unfreeze FTX assets held in that country. This summer, the US government severed the bribery and four other charges from the case and added a new one: that he&#39;d used stolen customer funds to make more than a hundred million dollars in campaign contributions ahead of the 2022 midterms. “I&#39;m trying not to freak out too much,” Sam said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;At the keyboard, he opened and shared with me several memos he&#39;d written since his arrest—documents replete with links, screenshots, assertions, and intricate explanations that, he claims, will demonstrate his innocence. The gist of his argument is that he made mistakes but did not knowingly commit crimes. At worst, he says, he was unaware of things that, as CEO, he should have known about—particularly the facts that Alameda had accumulated billions of dollars in losses and that FTX customers&#39; money was being used to plug the hole.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Alameda&#39;s position on FTX was substantially bigger than we had realized. That&#39;s one of the bigger fuckups,” he told me. “Which meant that in fact, if Alameda were to go down, FTX would be on the hook for a lot more of that than I had realized.” He said that this prospect did not become clear to him until shortly before the company collapsed. His defense team now has the task of convincing a jury that their client, a quantitative savant, missed something of such importance.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Three of Bankman-Fried&#39;s closest associates have already pleaded guilty and agreed to coöperate in the case against him: Caroline Ellison, the former Alameda CEO; Gary Wang, a co-founder of FTX; and Nishad Singh, FTX&#39;s former director of engineering. In Ellison&#39;s guilty plea, she said that FTX had granted Alameda unlimited borrowing privileges, and that when loans from outside lenders were recalled in June, 2022, FTX funds were used to repay them. She further stated that she conspired with Bankman-Fried to hide the borrowing from Alameda&#39;s lenders by creating a false set of financial statements.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Ellison sounded slightly less certain last November, on the day after FTX stopped honoring customer withdrawals, in a recording likely to be used as evidence at trial. When a colleague asked her during a staff meeting who had authorized Alameda&#39;s borrowing, she said, “Um . 。 。 Sam, I guess.” Bankman-Fried was adamant, in my conversations with him, that prosecutors would not be able to produce any documents showing him authorizing the unlimited borrowing, because, he says, there are none.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;As I sat with him in the study, his mother, who seemed tense, sometimes passed by on her way to the kitchen. Fried retired from full-time teaching last year, hoping to have more time for writing and political activism. After Donald Trump won the Presidency, in 2016, she co-founded Mind the Gap, a political-action committee built around Moneyball-style data analytics aimed at flipping congressional seats from red to blue. When her son was arrested, Fried resigned from the &lt;em >;PAC&lt;/em>; and concentrated on exonerating him. “All four of us care about only one thing, which is Sam&#39;s innocence,” she later told me.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I asked whether she had ever felt compelled to ask her son if he&#39;d done any of the things he&#39;d been charged with. She replied no—she didn&#39;t need to ask. Her son was incapable of dishonesty or stealing, she said. “Sam will never speak an untruth,” she went on. “It&#39;s just not in him.”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;kp5kt&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Fried is a leading scholar of legal ethics. Her best-known book, “The Progressive Assault on Laissez Faire,” is a study of capitalism and the coercive aspects of free markets. “She&#39;s a brilliant critic,” Debra Satz, the dean of Stanford&#39;s School of Humanities and Sciences, said, “and the book really picks apart these debates about freedom and equality.” This year, her intellectual rigor has been applied to her son&#39;s media strategy, which she considered integral to his defense—so integral that she and her husband hired a high-powered PR consultant, Risa Heller, to assist them. The couple embarked on a campaign to spread their perspective: that the press, unfairly assuming that their son is guilty, has failed to examine weaknesses in the government&#39;s case and the role of FTX&#39;s lawyers in the company&#39;s downfall. The campaign was not aided by the September lawsuit against them—a legal action that their attorneys say is a cynical effort by John Ray to influence the outcome of their son&#39;s trial. Calling the suit a waste of creditors&#39; money, Fried said that its real agenda was “to enflame the jury pool on the eve of Sam&#39;s trial by portraying all of us as a pack of thieves.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Robert Gordon, a Stanford Law School colleague, described Fried as one of the most “ethically fastidious” people he knows. “She seems so sure,” he said of her faith in her son, “and the way that she thinks through ethical problems is just so careful. This, of course, is the big mystery at the heart of all this.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;During a hike in the foothills of the mountains near the family&#39;s home, Fried described herself to me as “emotionally reserved, like Sam,” shortly before she teared up. “I don&#39;t care what is said about me, Joe doesn&#39;t care what is said about him,” she said. “Saving Sam is the major project of our lives.” She had lost ten pounds since his legal troubles began, and a recent eye operation had temporarily affected her vision, but she seemed intent on projecting her resolve. Wearing a baseball cap and a bright-red backpack, Fried charged up a hillside, shoes crunching on the dirt. In two hours in the blazing sun, she didn&#39;t take a sip of water.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Before the collapse of FTX, Bankman-Fried led a heady life. “I&#39;d go to a conference, and I&#39;d end up, like, cancelling a meeting with a head of state, because there was a conflicting request from a different head of state that seemed more important,” he told me. “And, you know, there were celebrities all around—and I really don&#39;t give a shit about celebrities. But it is nonetheless a little bit surreal the first few times that it happens.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Bankruptcy documents say that he and his companies spent approximately two hundred and fifty million dollars to buy thirty-five properties in the Bahamas, and reportedly chartered jets to deliver Amazon orders from Miami to island-based employees. In our conversations, Bankman-Fried said that such seemingly profligate expenses were part of an effort to attract talented workers, as many tech-company leaders before him had done. “I did try to make FTX a nice place for people to work,” he said.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Shuffling his cards, he insisted that the only real estate he purchased for himself cost “about two million”—negligible by tech-CEO standards. “I didn&#39;t think it would have been correct for me to live an extremely lavish life style, nor would I have enjoyed it,” he added. In the Bahamas, by his and others&#39; accounts, he did a lot of his own shopping and sometimes cooked for some of his employees. (Beyond Burgers and Beyond Sausages were a staple, he said.) He also paid himself a two-hundred-thousand-dollar salary and never took bonuses, he told me. In court filings, the FTX bankruptcy estate said that it had traced $2.2 billion in payments and loans to Bankman-Fried, primarily from Alameda.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;As we spoke, Fried popped her head in the doorway. “Dinner at seven?”她说。 “How does pasta with vegetables sound?” Bankman-Fried, who barely spoke to his parents while in my presence, nodded. Before we assembled at the table, Bankman emerged with a bottle of California Cabernet.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Bankman-Fried gulped water and swiftly cleaned his plate before returning to his research. But Bankman, wiry and sunny in demeanor, seemed to be trying to convey a sense of normalcy. He is best known for work that jump-started two significant public-interest campaigns. One exposed illegal tax shelters and documented the aggressive marketing of those shelters to corporations by legal and accounting firms. He went on to help write legislation to identify users of the shelters, as a result of which around a billion dollars in unpaid taxes were recouped by the government. The second campaign has been to make tax-return filing easy and free. (California has adopted some of the reforms he fought for.) “You know, tax sounds so dull, and I get it,” he said, “but it&#39;s really about who gets to own what, when the music stops. So, it&#39;s really important for social-justice purposes.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;His son, though ostensibly supportive of crypto regulation in the US, once wrote to a reporter, in an exchange he believed to be off the record, “Fuck regulators . 。 。 they don&#39;t protect customers at all.” Bankman, by contrast, has fought in his career for more government scrutiny of financial transactions. As his son&#39;s business grew, Bankman said, he became interested in how crypto could make money transfers cheaper for consumers, especially in the Global South.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;On an FTX podcast in August, 2022, three months before the implosion, he reportedly said, “From the start, whenever I was useful, I&#39;d lend a hand.” He was often useful, it turned out. According to the bankruptcy estate&#39;s lawsuit, he described Alameda as “a family business” years before his son hired him full time, and employed his connections and expertise to help Alameda and FTX grow. He joined his son at meetings on Capitol Hill aimed at securing changes to the policies that currently make it illegal to operate most crypto exchanges in the US But Bankman&#39;s role in FTX&#39;s charitable giving was what he preferred to talk about with me.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“The company seemed to have such unlimited resources that you could really think big and do great things,” he said. He directed money to a universal-basic-income project in Chicago, and a program that brought mental-health services into troubled homes in South Florida. According to the bankruptcy suit, another favored charity was Stanford. The complaint alleges that he gave his university five and a half million dollars of “FTX Group donations,” for his and Fried&#39;s private professional gain. The day after the suit against them was filed, Stanford announced that it would return the money.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;During my dinner with the family, Sandor, a docile German shepherd, lay underfoot. Before FTX collapsed, the family rarely locked their front door at night, Bankman said, but they were now getting threats, some of them antisemitic. At first, they were advised to hire full-time guards. But, once they calculated the yearly outlay, they decided to supplement their part-time security with Sandor. He is trained to attack if given the correct set of orders, in German. “The trainer came over and put on a bite suit,” Bankman told me. “He said the words and the dog leaped through the air and tore the arm off.”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;3lyq6&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Bankman is, in addition to his other work, a part-time therapist. Especially interested in anxiety, he has written on the intersection of law and psychology and co-hosted, with Stanford students, a podcast on wellness and the legal profession. He has deployed his psychological expertise at home, to try to keep everyone calm, but the morning after our dinner, as he and I walked around campus, his own anxiety was evident. When I asked what his son&#39;s defense would cost, Bankman said, “Substantially everything we have.” But, he added, sounding melancholic, “that&#39;s what money is for.”&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot;

He cared little for toys, apart from puzzles, and seemed largely indifferent to amusement parks and birthday parties. One evening before bed, Fried recalled, Sam and Gabriel, who were still in elementary school, started asking her and Bankman questions about divorce. They knew a kid whose parents were getting one, and wanted to know how it worked, and who got what. “We ended up, like, talking about community-property states, and the alternatives to community-property states, and the different ways of dividing up human capital,” Fried said. The discussion went on for more than an hour, and after she and Bankman left the bedroom she turned to him and said, “We are such idiots. They&#39;re interested in what we&#39;re interested in, they&#39;re just a lot younger and more ignorant.” Fried told me, unable to conceal her pride, “And that changed child rearing for us.” They would give their boys fewer amusement parks and more adult conversation.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Still, a few years later, she arrived home from work one day to find Sam, who rarely cried, in tears. “I am so bored I feel like I&#39;m going to die,” he told her. At that point, Fried said, “we went into high gear.” They enrolled him in a Saturday program called Math Circle, where professors taught logic and problem-solving to precocious students. There were further elevated math classes before school. And in ninth grade Bankman-Fried was admitted to a selective summer program called Canada/USA Mathcamp, where, for the first time, he made close friends. Gary Wang, who would become an FTX co-founder, was one of them. “Sam just got inducted into this other world of math and science nerds with passion, and they were his people,” Fried said.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Sam and Gabe were also encouraged to engage in discussions about human rights and foreign policy at their parents&#39; Sunday-night dinners. Larry Kramer recalled once having a disagreement with the boys and saying something patronizing, like “When you get a little older, you&#39;ll understand.” Later, Kramer said, Bankman took him aside: “They wanted their kids to be treated at the same level as the adults.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;After some hand-wringing about their commitment to public schooling, Fried and Bankman decided that Sam and Gabe would go to high school at Crystal Springs Uplands, a private school that attracted many privileged tech kids, including Steve Jobs&#39;s son. Sam was kind but mostly kept to himself, a former student recalled: “Everyone recognized he was brilliant and super sharp and that school wasn&#39;t challenging for him.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;After graduating, Bankman-Fried enrolled at MIT, imagining that he might become a physicist. His plans began to evolve in his sophomore year, when he learned about the effective-altruism movement. Many effective altruists have taken inspiration from the philosopher Peter Singer, who argues that, when more than a billion people in the developing world are impoverished and suffering, spending on luxuries is morally flawed. The EA movement has considered how much money it would take to save a single imperilled life (approximately four thousand dollars, by one estimate), and some of its adherents have pursued high-paying careers in order to give most of their earnings to organizations that serve vulnerable groups. The movement appeals to people with quantitative orientations.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In 2014, degree in hand, Bankman-Fried took a job at Jane Street Capital, a trading firm that used mathematical models to find and exploit price discrepancies in different securities markets. The firm hired many programmers and math majors and had a geeky, collegial culture; late-night chess tournaments were common. Jane Street attracted other young effective altruists, among them Caroline Ellison, the daughter of MIT professors, who had graduated from Stanford.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Bankman-Fried told me that the job favored people who could keep track of the many variables influencing the market, and who had the ability to synthesize them and make fast trading decisions, all while managing the computer code designed to execute the trades. He described it as “sort of, like, right at the borderline of humans and computers.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Bankman-Fried told me that he gave away about half of what he made at Jane Street, though he declined to reveal the amount. Much of the money, he said, went to animal-welfare organizations and to the Centre for Effective Altruism, for grants and movement-building. After about three years, he left Jane Street and briefly worked for the Centre while thinking of starting a company of his own.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The cryptocurrency boom was under way, and hundreds of digital coins were trading on exchanges around the world. Bankman-Fried became interested in the industry after noticing that the prices were often quoted differently depending on which exchange one was using. A clever trader who was proficient in algorithmic programming was well positioned to exploit the differences—say, buying a bitcoin in the US, selling it in Japan, and profiting on the spread. In 2017, according to court filings, he and a colleague, Tara Mac Aulay, started trading crypto with their own money on various exchanges. Eventually, others joined in—Ellison; Sam&#39;s math-camp friend Wang, who&#39;d worked at Google; and Singh, a friend of Gabe&#39;s who was working at Facebook. Wang and Singh had also become effective altruists, pledging to donate most of their earnings. The friends made the fund official, naming it Alameda Research.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Under Bankman-Fried, its first CEO, Alameda made aggressive bets, often with borrowed money. Because traditional banks wouldn&#39;t lend to crypto companies, the fund had to turn to institutions that catered to crypto, frequently at high interest rates. Alameda&#39;s track record, according to the &lt;em>;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em>;, was inconsistent. A few months after launching, it lost about two-thirds of its assets on a big bet on XRP, a digital currency issued by a blockchain-based payments network. Mac Aulay quit, along with some other employees. Last year, she wrote on Twitter that the departures were in part caused by “concerns over risk management and business ethics.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Bankman-Fried rebuilt the fund and moved it to Hong Kong. In 2019, though, in the face of regulatory uncertainty and tight pandemic restrictions, he turned to his dad, who advised his son to set up shop in a place like the Bahamas, which was trying to generate domestic investment by making itself a crypto hub. FTX launched there later that year as an exchange and a trading platform. Alameda provided legitimacy by trading heavily on the new platform—an arrangement that also created conditions for Alameda to receive favorable treatment (possibly by being able to see what trades others on the exchange were making). The CFTC alleges that FTX gave the fund an “unfair advantage” by exempting it from rules that applied to other users. Bankman-Fried contends that Alameda wasn&#39;t granted preferential access in any way that really mattered: “It didn&#39;t give them the sort of leniency that would fuck over other accounts. We were fairly careful about that.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;In the penthouse, which was valued at more than thirty million dollars and overlooked a yacht-choked marina, Bankman-Fried was living like a fantastically privileged college student, sharing the vast space with Ellison, Wang, Singh, and other employees. He kept odd hours, sometimes napping in a beanbag chair at the office. In 2019, he tweeted about “stimulants when you wake up, sleeping pills if you need them.” Two years later, Ellison tweeted, “Nothing like regular amphetamine use to make you appreciate how dumb a lot of normal, non-medicated human experience is.” (Bankman-Fried has said that he took only prescribed medication, and that his use was on label; Ellison did not comment for this story.)&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Most of FTX&#39;s revenue came through fees that investors paid to trade on its platform. CNBC reported that the exchange&#39;s revenue was a billion dollars in 2021. That fall, Bankman-Fried appointed Ellison and Sam Trabucco, a fellow MIT graduate, to become co-CEOs of Alameda, so that he could focus on FTX. Bankman-Fried has said that he didn&#39;t play a role in investing decisions for Alameda after that point, but, according to the CFTC lawsuit against him, he maintained daily contact with Ellison and Trabucco and stayed intimately involved with the fund.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Bankman-Fried was also becoming a kind of international statesman of crypto. Zeke Faux, a Bloomberg reporter and the author of a book about the industry, “Number Go Up,” told me, “His trick with the media was just being very accessible. If a crypto newsletter needed a quote about Shiba Inu coin prices, he was there. And on the way up this was really effective, and he was able to create this image as the only honest guy in crypto.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Bankman-Fried told me, of that time, “I was on the path to accomplishing what I wanted to accomplish.” Further affirmation seemed to come when the best-selling author Michael Lewis started hanging around the office and accompanying him to meetings. Bankman-Fried gave Lewis unrestricted access for a book that is set to be published next month.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;While audited financial statements for 2021 show a profitable company, FTX, apparently through a loophole in the tax code that applies to cryptocurrencies, was able to report $3.7 billion in carryover losses on its tax returns, greatly reducing its tax bill. Later, accounting experts would see some red flags in the financial statements, including the fact that two different, relatively unknown auditors had prepared them. As one expert speculated on CoinDesk, “With the benefit of hindsight, we can see it perhaps suggested that Bankman-Fried didn&#39;t want any firm to see the whole picture.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The following year, a murky FTX transaction implicated Bankman-Fried&#39;s parents directly. During the company&#39;s property-buying frenzy, the couple signed a deed to the sixteen-and-half-million-dollar beach house in the Bahamas where they stayed, although they hadn&#39;t paid anything toward it. The bankruptcy suit insinuates that the arrangement was made at their son&#39;s instigation. Bankman-Fried and his parents strongly deny this.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In an explanation that reflects more carelessness about signing legal documents than Stanford law professors typically possess, Bankman told &lt;em>;The New Yorker&lt;/em>; that he and his wife signed the deed in error; that the house was intended to be company property; and that, after belatedly grasping the US tax implications of attesting to owning it, they fulfilled their legal obligations by alerting company lawyers to their concerns. A spokesperson for the couple said, “Outside counsel confirmed to Joe and Barbara that FTX would have all beneficial ownership of the house and agreed to document that in writing.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Bankman-Fried&#39;s ambitions for his philanthropy grew along with FTX. After the &lt;em >;COVID&lt;/em>;-19 pandemic began, he joined multiple billionaires, including Peter Thiel and Patrick Collison, in funnelling money into efforts to find treatments. Edward Mills, a professor at McMaster University, whose lab conducted one of the largest &lt;em >;COVID&lt;/em>; therapeutics trials in the world, was an FTX beneficiary. He told me that Bankman-Fried wanted to provide funding to hundreds of biotech companies to develop vaccines and treatments, which he hoped could be rapidly tested through an international network of clinical-trial sites. “Sam had a vision of a world free of disease.” Mills said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;At the same time, Bankman-Fried was also becoming one of the largest political donors in Washington, personally contributing some forty million dollars ahead of the 2022 midterms, according to OpenSecrets, a nonprofit that tracks money in politics. He was one of the top CEO donors to Joe Biden&#39;s 2020 Presidential campaign, giving more than five million dollars (an “anti-Trump” donation, he told me). He also made dark-money contributions to Republicans, which he wouldn&#39;t quantify. One of his goals was to counter extremist candidates in Republican primaries, he said, and by keeping his payments under the radar he could avoid the backlash that would ensue if candidates were found to have taken money from a known Democratic donor.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;sjh0kx&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;By the end of 2022, however, he had no more money to give, and, of all the causes he espoused, the effective-altruism movement in particular was reeling from his downfall. Not long before Bankman-Fried&#39;s arrest, one of the movement&#39;s co-founders, William MacAskill, wrote on Twitter, “If he lied and misused customer funds he betrayed me, just as he betrayed his customers, his employees, his investors, &amp;amp; the communities he was a part of.” Peter Singer told me that although he thinks the movement will persist, Bankman-Fried&#39;s arrest has made the public more cynical about individuals trying to earn money to give it away. And, in an online effective-altruism forum, community members mourned the fact that FTX customers&#39; lives had been ruined while also berating themselves for doing weak due diligence before, as one member put it, “entrusting a decent chunk of the financing and reputation of the entire EA movement to an offshore crypto business.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;For FTX, the end began in the spring of 2022, when, in the face of rising interest rates, crypto darlings began to falter, sending waves of financial stress through the industry. Bitcoin dropped by twenty-seven per cent in eight days; terraUSD and Luna, two coins that provided liquidity to other crypto firms, lost almost all their value; Celsius Network, a crypto exchange, collapsed; and Three Arrows Capital, a ten-billion-dollar crypto hedge fund, was forced to liquidate after heavy losses. That June, a psychiatrist who had treated Bankman-Fried in California moved to the Bahamas to become a life coach for his rattled staff.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Nonetheless, through the summer, Bankman-Fried seemed to signal that he was unaffected by the turmoil in his industry, announcing plans to rescue some of the crypto companies that hadn&#39;t fared as well as FTX had. In late October, he visited Saudi Arabia to try to interest new investors. On November 2nd, the CoinDesk article about Alameda&#39;s balance sheet came out.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;The following Sunday, when CZ, the Binance CEO, tweeted his doubts and accelerated the rush of customer-withdrawal requests, Bankman-Fried&#39;s parents were in the Bahamas having an approximation of their Stanford Sunday-night dinners with FTX employees. Mid-meal, a company lawyer took a call, became agitated, and left.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“It was incredibly stressful and overwhelming,” Bankman-Fried told me of the following days. He says he figured he could raise several billion dollars from investors to tide the company over and fulfill withdrawal requests. He could then sell off assets to raise more cash while keeping the exchange functioning. “There were way too many things I needed to be doing,” he said. “It was kind of scary.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The day after CZ indicated that he was dumping his FTT, FTX acknowledged that it was experiencing a liquidity crisis, and Bankman-Fried started looking publicly for a bailout. Around that time, Bahamian police paid a visit to the office. The visit was likely in regard to a security breach, but some employees started to panic that they might be in trouble, and others grew angry. “I think that, somehow, we all had this superhuman sense of him,” a former employee told me. Now their leader was tainted, and so were their résumés. Soon, the employee went on, several of them began taking turns staying with Singh, a committed member of the EA community, out of concern that he might be suicidal. (Singh&#39;s attorney did not respond to requests for comment.) Three months later, Singh pleaded guilty to wire fraud, conspiracy to commit fraud, conspiracy to commit money laundering, and conspiracy to violate campaign-finance laws. The recent suit against Bankman-Fried&#39;s parents cited an e-mail from Fried to her son suggesting that he use Singh&#39;s name instead of his own when making a one-million-dollar contribution to Mind the Gap, in order to avoid creating “the impression that funding MTG is a family affair.” Fried told &lt;em>;The New Yorker&lt;/em>; that this was “a perfectly legal and commonplace practice,” and said that her son had donated roughly a tenth of that figure to her &lt;em >;PAC&lt;/em>;.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;As FTX&#39;s downward spiral continued, Bankman began speaking with defense lawyers and tried to get his son to join the conversations. But, whether determined or delusional, Bankman-Fried was solely focussed on persuading people to entrust him with hundreds of millions more dollars, to save the company. At times, according to Bloomberg, his father was beside him, making calls on his behalf, to little avail. Many people were quitting, packing their suitcases, and leaving the island, said the colleague who, a few weeks later, would be taking Bankman-Fried&#39;s class ring and wallet before officers placed him in handcuffs: “At some point, Sam was practically the only one left.”&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;a data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a27627&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a27627&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;“Should I pack this or will there be one on Earth we can use”&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/650e246b085421574e15bd73/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/231002_a27627.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/650e246b085421574e15bd73/master/w_120,c_limit/231002_a27627.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/650e246b085421574e15bd73/master/w_240,c_limit/231002_a27627.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/650e246b085421574e15bd73/master/w_320,c_limit/231002_a27627.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/650e246b085421574e15bd73/master/w_640,c_limit/231002_a27627.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/650e246b085421574e15bd73/master/w_960,c_limit/231002_a27627.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/650e246b085421574e15bd73/master/w_1280,c_limit/231002_a27627.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/650e246b085421574e15bd73/master/w_1600,c_limit/231002_a27627.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/a>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;“Should I pack this or will there be one on Earth we can use?”&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;Cartoon by Michael J.

In addition to Ellison&#39;s testimony, Wang, who pleaded guilty to four fraud charges, is expected to say he helped create the computer-code back door that allowed Alameda to borrow so much from FTX. Singh is also expected to take the stand.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;It is standard practice for banks to take depositors&#39; money and use it for other activities. Bankman-Fried&#39;s defense could try to argue that FTX customers knew their money might be used by the company for other purposes. Another defense argument is likely to be that FTX&#39;s external legal counsel, the firm Sullivan &amp;amp; Cromwell, and Ryne Miller, the general counsel of FTX.US, the company&#39;s American subsidiary, may have been motivated by conflicts of interest. Miller was a former partner at Sullivan &amp;amp; Cromwell, a prominent firm whose marquee client is Goldman Sachs. In 2021, Miller helped hire Sullivan &amp;amp; Cromwell to serve as one of FTX&#39;s outside legal advisers.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Bankman-Fried says that, in the days leading up to his decision to sign the change-of-control agreement that allowed the company to file for bankruptcy, Miller and Sullivan &amp;amp; Cromwell attorneys sent him numerous messages pressuring him to do so—a campaign that Bankman-Fried describes as “harassment, intimidation, coercion and misrepresentation.” His records show that, on the night of November 8th, Miller sent a text to him and to FTX leadership that said, “I need to wire SullCrom $4M to make sure we are all represented through this. And we preserve any value that is left.明天。 From FTX.com cash.谁能做到？ I&#39;m in charge now.” Miller declined to comment. Sullivan &amp;amp; Cromwell declined to comment on the record, but, in a declaration filed with the bankruptcy court, Andrew Dietderich, a Sullivan &amp;amp; Cromwell partner, said of Bankman-Fried&#39;s account of being pressured to file for Chapter 11, “This is false.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Around four-thirty the next morning, an exhausted Bankman-Fried clicked the DocuSign link Miller had sent him and electronically signed the document. About ten minutes later, he says, an emergency-funding offer of about four hundred million dollars came through from Tron, a blockchain platform. Tron&#39;s founder, Justin Sun, told Bloomberg TV that the offer was “subject to due diligence.” Bankman-Fried said that he tried to rescind his signature but couldn&#39;t.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“That is like a singular fixed moment around which everything else rotates,” the former colleague said. “That was incredibly palpable. I saw a man who was haunted by the fact that he could not wrap his mind around what had happened. It&#39;s like losing your keys and you&#39;ve checked the room and you&#39;ve checked the sofa and you can&#39;t figure out where they went.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Around the same time, Miller and Sullivan &amp;amp; Cromwell went to federal prosecutors, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the CFTC to report alleged accounting problems at FTX.US. And, after the law firm helped choose John Ray to lead the company through bankruptcy, he hired it as the lead legal adviser. The firm went on to bill more than a hundred million dollars for the first several months of work for the bankruptcy, with hundreds of millions more likely to come. (A Sullivan &amp;amp; Cromwell spokesperson directed &lt;em>;The New Yorker&lt;/em>; to an effusive June report by a fee examiner from Godfrey &amp;amp; Kahn that acknowledged the “remarkable” fees but went on to praise the firm&#39;s “creativity, professionalism, and personal sacrifice” in “transforming a smoldering heap of wreckage into a functioning Chapter 11.”) But last January a trustee policing bankruptcies for conflicts of interest on behalf of the Justice Department filed an objection to the firm&#39;s appointment.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Although a judge denied the trustee&#39;s motion, Jonathan Lipson, a bankruptcy expert at Temple University, later filed a brief in support of the trustee, noting that, in January, Ray had referred to FTX as a “dumpster fire.” If that was true, he wrote, it was worth questioning why Sullivan &amp;amp; Cromwell hadn&#39;t seen it burning sooner.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;avgsx&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Even if the defense can prove that Sullivan &amp;amp; Cromwell behaved unethically, few legal experts I spoke with think that the court will be persuaded by Bankman-Fried&#39;s contention that, if he&#39;d had more time, FTX&#39;s problems could have been corrected. One expert in white-collar law likened it to taking a hundred dollars from the collection plate at church and hoping to gamble with it at the race track, win, and put a hundred and fifty dollars back onto the plate. “It&#39;s one thing to take your own money and bet on something you think is going to be a winner,” he said. “But there&#39;s no excuse for taking someone else&#39;s money.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Intensifying the legal peril is Ray&#39;s claim, from his first legal filing as head of FTX, that he has never “seen such a complete failure of corporate controls and such a complete absence of trustworthy financial information as occurred here.” Testifying before Congress last December, he compared FTX executives&#39; conduct unfavorably to Enron&#39;s. “Crimes that were committed there were highly orchestrated financial machinations by highly sophisticated people to keep transactions off balance sheets,” he said. “This is just taking money from customers and using it for your own purpose.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Bankman-Fried&#39;s defense has argued that the government is effectively deputizing the company to aid the prosecution. The defense has further complained that Ray and his colleagues control FTX&#39;s servers and files, and that they have denied Bankman-Fried access to documents that might exonerate him, including records of changes to the computer-code base that show exactly who enabled Alameda to engage in unrestricted borrowing from FTX. Ray declined to comment, and the prosecution denies that Bankman-Fried&#39;s access has been impeded.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;On December 12th, a month after the Chapter 11 filing, Bankman-Fried was in the penthouse drafting testimony about FTX&#39;s collapse, which he had promised to give the next day to the US House Financial Services Committee. Not long before Bahamian officials showed up to arrest him, he had shared a Google doc of the testimony with his mom and his colleague, and one of them struck out his opening line: “I would like to start by formally stating, under oath: I fucked up.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Financial-fraud cases of this magnitude often end with guilty pleas, so court trials like Bankman-Fried&#39;s are relatively rare. After years of sustaining harsh criticism for the lack of prosecutions related to the 2008 financial crisis, and for doing little as crypto grew into a speculative bubble, the Justice Department and securities regulators seem to be using the FTX case as an opportunity to project a newfound toughness on financial crime.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Bankman-Fried is already facing consequences for trying to improve his public image in advance of the trial. This summer, the &lt;em>;Times&lt;/em>; published portions of a diary kept by Ellison, in which she worried about being in over her head. Bankman-Fried&#39;s legal team admitted in a court filing that he had provided materials to the &lt;em>;Times&lt;/em>;. The lead prosecutor, Danielle Sassoon, said that the leak was an attempt by Bankman-Fried to intimidate a witness, and not his first. She filed a motion asking that he and his parents be barred from making public statements about his case, and that he be transferred from house arrest to jail.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Bankman-Fried&#39;s defense lawyer Mark Cohen, of Cohen &amp;amp; Gresser, argued that Bankman-Fried had First and Sixth Amendment rights to respond to media inquiries about his case, and that his imprisonment would hamper his ability to prepare for his trial. But Judge Lewis A. Kaplan, who is presiding over the case, agreed in July to the gag order, and in August he remanded Bankman-Fried to the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, to await the start of his trial. My conversations with Bankman-Fried thus came to a halt.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Last December, around the time of the arrest, his parents wrote him a letter. “You are innocent,” they said, and reassured him, “By a year from now, there is a nontrivial chance that the world&#39;s fury may shift to some other villain.” Ten months in, his parents&#39; very cautious optimism seems wishful. A fourth top executive in Bankman-Fried&#39;s inner circle, Ryan Salame, took a plea deal in September.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In an e-mail to &lt;em>;The New Yorker&lt;/em>;, Fried characterized the actions of both the prosecution and the bankruptcy estate as “McCarthyite” and a “relentless pursuit of total destruction,” which is enabled by “a credulous public that will believe anything they say.” She went on, “It takes a lifetime to build up a reputation as honorable people. It takes five minutes to destroy it, which they now have done.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;As their son&#39;s October trial date nears, Fried and Bankman have started talking about how, should he lose, they might handle his appeal. They take turns flying from California to visit him at the Brooklyn jail every Tuesday.
