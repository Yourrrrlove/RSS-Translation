p >;&lt;strong>;您将拥有更多的清洁产品。&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;几乎在一天中的任何时候，如果有更好的方法来深入了解，您都会被 Google 的冲动所淹没。清洁地毯、平底锅或吊扇。您将搜索 Reddit 帖子，然后遍历暗网，找到能够重现七年级科学知识的 DIY 肥皂配方。一个人发誓用埃尔默混合醋和鸡汤的胶水来去除酒渍，你绝对会尝试它。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;更加安静。&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一旦你跨过二十九个月十一​​个月的界限，达到了没有 TikTok 影响者敢大声说话的年龄，你的核心圈子里大声说话的人数量就会突然减少。那些曾经与你交往的平均分贝较高、在北梭鱼烧烤店大喊大叫的人将会从你的生活中消失。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;艾米莉·马里科 (Emily Mariko) 会变得更加有趣。&lt; /strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;食物影响者曾经存在于你意识的外围。现在，您将记住他们冰箱中的内容并为他们的食谱添加书签。您将定期腌制肉、撒上香草，并向朋友发送空气炸锅菜谱。他们会恳求你将配额限制为每天一次，但你不听。八分钟做三文鱼？！这是下一次工业革命。世界需要知道。__&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;你的植物会存活下来。&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;如果罗勒盆栽能像虎鲸一样团结起来，他们会立即推翻你他们所有的亲人都被你杀死了。但现在情况会有所不同。你回家的时间会更长。那里很不错！温度刚刚好。没有强迫的谈话，有免费停车，你终于有时间给罗勒浇水了。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;性会变得更好。&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;是否是因为你的标准（和蛋白质摄入量）更高，或者因为你在亚马逊上购买的经过同行评审的玩具现在比你的手机收费更高，你在二十多岁的中期高潮已经结束了。还有，你现在发号施令的方式？你会成为一名出色的中尉。&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/ div>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;你将不再关心菲尔的想法。&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;菲尔是你曾经关心的那个很酷的人，因为他会在外面呆到凌晨 4 点&lt;em >;AM&lt; /em>; 他总是不停地倒酒，讲尖锐的“笑话”。但多年来你已经意识到菲尔有点糟糕——他不太可靠，而且对《小美人鱼》有太多的看法。所以去他妈的菲尔。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;你会拒绝婚礼邀请。&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt; p >;而且你甚至不会想出一个好的理由。你的决策能力将不再因渴望被所有人喜欢而受到损害。当有人建议举办一场仅限站立的音乐会时，你会像打喷嚏一样脱口而出“不”。你会遇到一个新朋友，他们做的第一件事就是倾倒创伤。当你年轻的时候，你欣赏他们的脆弱。半分钟后，你就会原谅自己，因为你不是 Brené Brown。&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;你会看起来更性感。&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;不，真的。现在您知道什么穿起来好看，而且它不是连身衣。从来都不是。您已经了解了如何分层，并且侧边部分不适合您的六边形脸型。你用牙线清洁并多吃菠菜。真是丢人啊，你这么喜欢吃菠菜！&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;你会一直犯困。&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;太疯狂了总统的最低年龄是三十五岁，因为没有人应该在如此困倦的时候管理一个国家。每当你遇到问题时，你都会想，让我们小睡一下吧。而且你会。在工作会议之间；甚至在工作会议期间。老实说，主要是在工作会议期间。有时您会感到困倦，而您的消化系统会同时燃烧。这就像漫威电影中有太多反派一样。但你会在家里用茂盛的罗勒小睡一下。 ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot;

rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;Doppelganger&lt;/a>;”，从这个简单的身份错误案例开始，并扩展到对我们的分析政治时刻，她将其描述为心理意义上的“不可思议”。 “弗洛伊德将离奇描述为一种令人恐惧的事物，它将曾经熟悉的事物变成了陌生的事物，”她告诉特约撰稿人贾·托伦蒂诺。 “这就是‘我想我知道这是什么，但它不是我想的那样’的奇怪之处。”克莱因认为，左派和右派已经成为彼此的分身——关于气候变化的否认主义已经扩大到许多话题，包括声称乔·拜登已经死了并且由一名演员扮演。 “每当你不喜欢现实时，你就可以说它不是真实的，”她说。&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;顶部：自动；高度：自动&quot;

data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;2021 年 8 月，Instagram 和 TikTok 上出现了一个新的赤裸上身的人物。他留着蓬乱的胡须，肌肉的大小和颜色与成熟的南瓜相似，他一半是牛仔，一半是野蛮人柯南。 “我是布莱恩·约翰逊，”他在第三个 Instagram 视频中说道。 “我的家人和部落称我为肝王。”他是 Ancestral Supplements 的所有者（该公司销售胶囊形式的干燥内脏肉），并且开展步行营销活动。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;八个月内，肝王在 Instagram 上积累了 100 万半粉丝，并在 Instagram 上积累了近 3 位粉丝。 TikTok 上的百万美元。起初他很温和，但他接受了新的角色，变得更加粗鲁、更具有模因价值，而且衣着也越来越少。 （在 2022 年 3 月的播客中，他说肝脏之王“冲出了笼子，他他妈的吃了布莱恩·约翰逊。”）他的大部分视频都集中在吃肉、举重物以及进行惩罚性的非正统锻炼上。他说，他的身体是纯天然的，不是类固醇的产物，而是锻炼和吃动物的产物。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;肝王的前提，现在已经很熟悉了，是我们与现代世界不匹配，并且我们的许多问题都可以通过重新连接久违的方式来解决。他坚持九项祖传信条。其中包括“睡眠”、“活动”和“联系”等合理建议，但是，正如他曾经解释的那样，“如果我告诉你全部九个，你什么都不记得了。”相反，他将自己的建议归结为一个：“我说，‘吃肝脏，因为肝脏是王。’” ”ancestralsupplements.com 上最畅销的独立产品是草饲牛肝。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;按照我们祖先的方式饮食的热潮并不是什么新鲜事。自运动生理学家 Loren Cordain 发表《古式饮食：通过吃你本来应该吃的食物来减肥和健康》（2001 年）以来，已经过去了二十多年，帮助创立了一个价值十亿美元的产业。但肝王和其他“肉食影响者”一起将旧石器时代推向了肉食的极端。他们认为，人类进化的目的是杀死与家畜体型和体质相似的动物，吞掉它们的器官（通常是生的），并且只在最绝望的情况下才吃蔬菜。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“忘记叶子和蔬菜吧。”纤维块茎，我们要去打猎了！” Paul Saladino（IG 粉丝数：160 万）在《食肉动物守则》中写道，这是新运动最接近宣言的内容。他断言，“这种方法似乎正是我们祖先所做的。” （萨拉迪诺与肝王共同拥有一家补充剂公司 Heart &amp;amp; Soil。）根据《食肉动物守则》，植物是有毒的——它们不想被吃掉，因此进化出了防御性旨在破坏您的消化的化学物质。同样，肖恩·贝克（Shawn Baker）（IG 粉丝数：319K）在《食肉动物饮食》中表示，原始人类获取蛋白质和卡路里的最有效方法是“捕杀大型、脂肪丰富、充满能量的巨型动物”。他承认，他们可能偶尔会吃一点水果或坚果，但获得相同回报所需的时间和精力将“至少高出一个数量级”。肝王自己想出了最简洁的口号：“既然能吃睾丸，为什么还要吃蔬菜呢？”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;爱吃肉的祖先的观念是有历史的。十九世纪五十年代，解剖学家雷蒙德·达特（Raymond Dart）因发现第一块早期非洲古人类真实化石而闻名，他提出了后来被称为“杀人猿”的理论。达特认为，狩猎使我们成为人类。他在《缺失环节的冒险》（1959）一书中写道，我们毛茸茸的祖先从树上爬下来，大口吃“南部平原广阔的大草原上更有吸引力的肉质食物”。在其他地方，他将最早的古人类描述为“公认的杀手：肉食性生物，通过暴力夺取猎物，将他们殴打致死，撕碎他们破碎的身体，将他们肢解，用受害者的热血来满足他们的贪婪和贪婪。吞噬青色扭动的肉体。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;杀手猿理论渗透到主流。 1955年，当时就读于威特沃特斯兰德大学的达特结识了正在南非进行报道的剧作家罗伯特·阿德雷。就像一个皈依者看到了神圣的真理一样，阿德雷离开时发生了转变。他坚信，“掠夺性转变”不仅使我们成为人类，而且还解释了他所描述的“人类的血腥历史、永恒的侵略性、非理性的、自我毁灭的、无情的为死而死的追求”。阿德雷 (Ardrey) 受到启发，撰写了《人性》系列，这是一套关于人性和进化的书籍，于 1961 年至 1976 年间出版。《时代》杂志后来将其命名为《非洲创世纪》，这是该系列的第一本，六十年代最著名的非小说类书籍。它被认为是对斯坦利·库布里克的电影《2001：太空漫游》（1968）的影响，该电影的开场片段将灵长类动物的暴力行为视为我们物种发展的转折点。&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;演示文稿&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;随着阿德雷和库布里克普及杀人猿，人类学家开始审查证据。 1966 年，在一次被人类学传说视为狩猎采集研究开端的会议上，75 名专家齐聚芝加哥，综合我们关于觅食民族的知识。组织者认为，超过百分之九十九的人类历史是在没有农业的情况下度过的，因此在这种生活方式完全消失之前记录下来是值得的。这场研讨会以及两年后出版的一本题为《猎人的男人》的相关书籍体现了人们对狩猎、食肉和男性的痴迷。 “人”本意涵盖所有人类； “猎人”是任何以野生食物为生的人的简称。这本书用了整整一个章节来讨论狩猎在人类进化中的作用。 “狩猎是人类的主要行为模式，”一章开始。 “这是一种整合了人类个体和构成我们单一物种的种群的形态、生理、遗传和智力方面的组织活动。”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline -recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;会议还揭示了以肉类为中心的故事的问题。达特断言“所有史前人类和最原始的人类都是猎人，即食肉者”。但《猎人》的撰稿人表明，这种观点是多么片面。人类学家理查德·李 (Richard Lee) 报告称，昆族是南非所谓的布须曼人之一，他们三分之二的卡路里来自植物。他们也不例外。当李比较了世界各地 58 个觅食社会时，他发现其中一半的人从植物性食物中获取了大部分热量；另外十八个主要依靠捕鱼为生。只有十一个（不到五分之一）依靠狩猎作为主要生存手段，除了一个之外，所有其他人都局限于最高或最低的纬度，远远超出我们的非洲家园。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;自从“猎人”，科学家们将基因组学以及新的考古学和古生物学方法纳入对悠久历史饮食的研究中。杜克大学进化人类学家赫尔曼·庞泽（Herman Pontzer）在他的新书《燃烧》中写道：“细节各不相同，很容易迷失在杂草中，但每个人传达的总体信息都很明确：我们是作为机会主义的杂食动物进化而来的。”它包括对古风格比喻的废除，包括肉食性。 “人类吃任何能吃的东西，几乎总是植物和动物（以及蜂蜜）的混合物。”&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Pontzer 表明了共识已经发生了多大的转变。达特坚称，南方古猿（Australopithecus）是人类祖先的早期群体，吞食血液和内脏，但它们的臼齿上的划痕图案表明它们是块茎的爱好者。我们最近的祖先也吃植物，其中包括那些被古生物倡导者诽谤的植物。以尼安德特人的饮食为例，丽贝卡·拉格·赛克斯在《亲属：尼安德特人的生活、爱情、死亡和艺术》一书中生动地详细介绍了这一点。尼安德特人确实吃大型野兽。遗址里到处都是被屠宰的野牛和马鹿的骨头——甚至有迹象表明它们杀死了猛犸象。然而，生活在温暖潮湿环境中的尼安德特人的牙齿磨损模式与食用大量纤维植物的农业民族相似。进一步的证据来自对尼安德特人牙结石的调查，即通过探测他们的牙菌斑。在他去世前不久，一个名叫 Shanidar 3 的人食用了枣子、一种类似扁豆的植物和一种身份不明的块茎或根。在比利时发现的两名成虫的遗骸中含有草和睡莲根淀粉的痕迹，表明它们曾以植物为食。来自西班牙埃尔西德龙的样本没有大型哺乳动物的 DNA，但它与松树、蘑菇和苔藓相匹配。零散的史前饮食揭示了对蔬菜的持久品味。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;尚未发表对照研究来验证肉食动物饮食的奢侈健康主张，但肉类影响者并没有被吓倒。在《食肉动物饮食》一书中，肖恩·贝克将湿疹、抑郁症和纤维肌痛列为“似乎对食肉动物饮食有积极反应的疾病”。心理学家乔丹·彼得森（Jordan Peterson）声称，牛肉、盐和水的养生法使他的思维更加敏锐，清除了他的牛皮癣，并消除了牙龈疾病；他的女儿米哈伊拉·彼得森坚持认为，同样的饮食，辅以羊肉、野牛，偶尔喝点伏特加或波旁威士忌，就能治愈她的关节炎。 Judy Cho（IG 粉丝：99.8K）在《初学者的完整肉食饮食：全肉生活方式实用指南》中，肉食被认为是一种强大的治疗方法，有可能缓解抑郁、炎症、饮食失调、和自身免疫问题。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;不过，仅靠肉体生存并不容易，Cho 提出了如何生存的建议。过多的瘦肉蛋白会导致问题，因此请确保至少 70% 的卡路里来自脂肪。咀嚼太少会导致便秘，因此尽量将每块肉咀嚼二十到三十次。肉食动物的口渴信号往往混乱，因此喝水的次数比自然感觉的要多。如果你不喜欢吃肉，就停止吃零食，直到你饿得想吃肉为止。为了缓解这种过渡，Cho 提供了各种为期一周的膳食计划，以及有用的允许项目及其营养统计数据表。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;一些肉类影响者强调人类是动物，并坚持认为，如果允许按照我们的规定饮食出于动物的本能，我们会喜欢多肉的菜单。但生物学家大卫·劳本海默和史蒂芬·J·辛普森三十多年来一直在研究动物营养，他们的新书《像动物一样吃》表明，肉类影响者的观点完全错误。作者开始在牛津大学合作，研究蝗虫（基本上是蚱蜢）的饮食偏好。首先，他们发现蝗虫更喜欢一定比例的碳水化合物与蛋白质。当被迫以碳水化合物含量较高、蛋白质含量较低的食物为食时，昆虫会吃得很多，变得肥胖，并且需要更长的时间才能蜕皮到成年。相反，当采用阿特金斯饮食的昆虫版本时，他们摄入的卡路里要少得多，并且活到成年的可能性也更小。其次，他们发现，选择适当食物的蝗虫最终总是获得几乎相同的蛋白质和碳水化合物比例。 “就好像，无论我们吃的是肉和面食，还是鸡蛋和面包，还是豆类和大米，还是鱼和土豆，我们总是摄入完全相同的蛋白质和碳水化合物平衡。”这些生物以某种方式追踪哪些食物中含有哪些营养素。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;这些发现不仅限于昆虫。劳本海默和辛普森后来确定，这种模式在从甲虫到狒狒的动物王国中广泛存在。他们发现，富含蛋白质的饮食不仅会使动物衰老，还会使动物衰老。他们杀得更快。他们在谈到 2014 年发表的研究时写道：“我们性感、瘦弱、吃高蛋白、低碳水化合物饮食的老鼠是所有老鼠中寿命最短的。”“它们的中年尸体看起来很漂亮。”&lt;/p>;&lt;/ div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;1bp5t8&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;劳本海默和辛普森在这里找到了关于人类的可能的教训代谢。当超加工食品中的蛋白质被剥夺时，我们的行为就像缺乏蛋白质的蝗虫一样，因碳水化合物而变得臃肿。他们写道，消除纤维会加剧这个问题，消除了原本会减缓进食、填饱肚子和抑制饥饿的刹车。与此同时，他们的工作暗示着对酮类、肉食和其他富含蛋白质的养生法的浮士德式诱惑。减少碳水化合物可能会让我们变得更瘦，并加速组织发育，使我们的身体进入“生长和繁殖途径”。但这是以牺牲寿命为代价的。维修和维护系统被搁置。错误折叠的蛋白质和其他细胞垃圾会积累。被推入超速状态时，身体会变得摇摇欲坠。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;根据劳本海默和辛普森的说法，两个典型的健康人群——日本的冲绳人，百岁老人的比率是其他发达国家的五倍，以及日本的冲绳人。玻利维亚亚马逊地区的齐马内 (Tsimané) 是有记录以来心血管疾病发病率最低的人，他们的饮食中蛋白质含量分别仅为 9% 和 14%。它们的大部分热量来自纤维淀粉，如车前草、木薯或红薯。劳本海默和辛普森并不建议读者成为日本岛民或偏远的亚马逊人，尽管他们提出了建议的蛋白质摄入量，但他们警告不要过于严格地遵循这些建议。相反，他们建议不要食用过度加工的食品；寻找脂肪、蛋白质和富含纤维的碳水化合物的良好来源；倾听你的食欲（除非你渴望美味的零食，他们指出，这些零食会欺骗身体，让你的身体误以为它在摄入蛋白质，但实际上并没有）。他们总结道：“我们的胃口比计算器更能衡量我们的胃口。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;肉类影响者是否有可能只是更大意识的有力体现——我们的食物系统正在辜负我们？在《吃到灭绝》中，与肉食动物保罗没有关系的丹·萨拉迪诺敦促读者“思考过去可以教会我们如何生活在现在和未来的世界。”塔拉斯·格雷斯科的《失落的晚餐》同样认为，对于我们世世代代赖以生存的植物和动物，“前进的道路在于复兴它们、培育它们、放牧它们并消费它们。”&lt;/p >;&lt;p>;对于格雷斯科和萨拉迪诺来说，现代性的危机并不像许多肉类影响者所坚持的那样，是种子油、碳水化合物和植物防御化学品的过量，而是多样性的崩溃。格雷斯科带领读者来到东非一处拥有两万三千年历史的遗址，那里的采集者曾经以二十种哺乳动物、十六科鸟类以及近一百五十种坚果、种子、水果和蔬菜为食。豆类。他带我们去加泰霍裕克，这是安纳托利亚一个繁华的新石器时代定居点，那里的食物包括绵羊、山羊、野牛、野猪、水禽，以及一系列令人印象深刻的植物性食物，如李子、无花果、橡子、杏仁、朴树、开心果和野芥末。&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;格雷斯科和萨拉迪诺都认为，现代饮食可能看起来千差万别，但按照历史标准来看，它们并非如此。作为一个物种，人类曾经食用数千种植物性食物，但如今大规模种植的植物性食物只有一百五十种，其中三种——大米、小麦和玉米——占所有卡路里的百分之五十。即使在这三人之中，多样性也在崩溃。二十世纪，美国种植的杂交玉米占全球玉米贸易量的 50%。数以千计的当地品种已被取代。其结果是卡路里的激增，但食物系统也变得更加脆弱，1970 年一场真菌枯萎病毁掉了 10 亿蒲式耳美国玉米，这一点就清楚地表明了这一点。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;对于肉食的反对者来说，这种多样性的丧失这是战斗的号角。艾丽西亚·肯尼迪在《不需要肉：植物性饮食的文化历史和烹饪未来》中表示，反对吃肉的运动是为了“主张生物多样性，并以支持文化、传统和美食的方式重建食物系统。”他们的论点归结为生态观察：生产一卡路里的羊肉或牛肉所需的土地比生产植物性替代品所需的土地多大约一百倍。鉴于世界上一半的无冰无沙漠土地用于农业，转向完全以植物为基础的饮食将释放大量资源。据估计，世界各地的农业用地将减少约 30 亿公顷，大约是美国大陆面积的四倍。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;食肉动物船员有何反应？朱迪·乔（Judy Cho）和保罗·萨拉迪诺（Paul Saladino）等人认为，这种共识是错误的，正如乔所说，“奶牛可能是拯救地球的方法。”他们将环境破坏归咎于谷物单一种植和农作物导致的森林砍伐等因素——更不用说百分之八十的农田被用作牲畜饲料。其他人采取了一种空洞的意识形态形式的反对。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;想想生鸡蛋民族主义者（X 粉丝：182.8K）的伎俩，他是一位右翼阴谋论者，向他的粉丝分发“红色药丸健身”。 “今天的敌人就是我所说的‘大豆全球化’，”他在塔克·卡尔森 2022 年福克斯特别节目《人类的终结》中解释道。 “全球主义者希望你变得肥胖、生病、抑郁和孤立——这样才能更好地控制你，并在杀死你之前从你身上榨取尽可能多的经济价值。”他的解决方案将民族主义和男子气概结合起来：强人建立强大的国家，抵御大豆全球化。 “这就是生鸡蛋的用武之地。鸡蛋是一种超级食品，富含蛋白质、脂肪、维生素、矿物质、合成代谢胆固醇——与全球主义者希望我们吃的恶心垃圾完全相反。”他并没有止于鸡蛋。如果含有胆固醇，就符合：“这意味着黄油，这意味着红肉、内脏肉、吃肝脏、喝生奶、吃生奶制品。”他警告说：“吃低脂素食是你能做的最糟糕的事情。它只会降低睾丸激素。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;2022 年 12 月 1 日，在网上分享有罪的电子邮件后，肝王在 YouTube 上发布了一段名为“肝王自白”的视频。 。 。我撒了谎。”他赤裸上身，坐在看起来像王座的东西上，对着镜头说道：“是的，我服用了类固醇。而且，是的，我正在服用类固醇。”他通过回到激发他宣扬祖先信条的问题来为自己辩护。 “我们的人民正以创纪录的速度受到伤害，患有抑郁症、自身免疫性疾病、焦虑症、不孕不育、生活抱负低迷。我们的年轻人受到的伤害最大，他们感到失落、软弱和顺从。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;仔细研究有关肉食性的材料，压倒性的印象是男性正面临危险。他们曾经很强大。他们与自然生活在一起，有着坚如磐石的胸膛。他们杀了或者被杀了。但现在不再了。现在他们要么骨瘦如柴，要么肥胖。他们的精子数量直线下降，睾酮水平中等。 “亚历山大大帝在 25 岁时征服了世界，”Carnivore Aurelius（IG 粉丝：717K）发帖称，他是一位匿名模因制作者，游走于讽刺与真诚之间。 “如今，如果 25 岁的人把电子烟留在家里，他们就会陷入恐慌。男人怎么了？”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;男人，我们读得越来越多，却落后了。每一百名女性中只有七十四名男性完成大学学业。主要通过体力劳动养家糊口的模式的前景越来越渺茫。因为肉与男子气概联系在一起，所以肉食有望为枯萎的与生俱来的权利提供一种方式。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;肝王从一开始就明白这一点。他的第一个视频表面上是关于旧石器时代的生活方式，但它看起来像是一个男性气质的广告。它的主角是一个半裸的维京人投掷长矛，扔出一个重球，并把一根挂着粗铁链的杠铃放在凳子上。它的特点是闪电、篝火、用厨师刀切成片的生肉，以及放在烤架上的腌制羊排。从景观美化到豪华的家庭健身房，到处都是地位和财富的象征。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;食肉动物让人想起伊甸园般的过去，与我们当前的不满形成鲜明对比：一个男人充满男子气概、身体健康的神话时代。食物真实而自然。它敦促你清除自己的现代腐败，世界和你的身体就会焕然一新。你会变得坚强。你的家人都会健康。土地将会恢复。在《食肉动物守则》中，保罗·萨拉迪诺（Paul Saladino）将纯肉饮食时居住的区域描述为“锡安”、“香格里拉”和“应许之地”，这是一条“青翠”的海岸线，在那里你可以捕猎“健康”的食物。反刍动物”从“干净、流动的溪流”中喝水。&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;这是熟悉的地形。过去半个世纪最成功的节食方法都受益于类似的营销。他们的倡导者坚称，诱人的添加剂正在毒害我们的身体。自由和活力来自于净化它们，来自于重演虚构祖先的生活方式。十九世纪七十年代，当内森·普里蒂金（Nathan Pritikin）倡导高碳水化合物、低脂肪的养生法时，他和他的合著者声称，美国人如此容易获得脂肪和胆固醇是“文明的意外”。他断言，“原始人”“更有可能是近乎素食者”。当罗伯特·阿特金斯提倡相反的方法时——限制碳水化合物是健康的关键——他强调，“当你做阿特金斯时，你吃的食物与我们原始祖先吃的食物惊人地接近。”在《小星球的饮食》（1971）中，弗朗西斯·摩尔·拉佩（Frances Moore Lappé）告诉她的读者，她主张“回归我们身体进化的传统饮食。”&lt; /p>;&lt;p>;时尚饮食是为了传播而完美制造的。他们呼吁不满。他们对为什么会出现问题提供了粗略的解释。他们利用了精神传统中心的直观逻辑——牺牲越大，救赎就越大。然而，流行的饮食习惯也注定会失败。 The same features that fuel their popularity—their quick-fix nature, their severe and often harmful restrictions—are what make them unsustainable for many.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;You even see this happening within the culture of carnivory. When the podcaster Joe Rogan went on a carnivore diet, in 2022, he ate fruit with his meat. The Liver King espouses a “nutrient-dense, nose-to-tail diet” while openly consuming potatoes and maple syrup. Yet the most dramatic turnabout occurred with Paul Saladino himself. Since publishing “The Carnivore Code,” he has acknowledged the benefits of carbohydrates. He now incorporates fruit, honey, and kefir into his daily fare, and this spring he changed his social-media handles from versions of @CarnivoreMD to @PaulSaladinoMD. In true Paleolithic fashion, even meatfluencers struggle to resist the pull of plants. ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 25 Sep 2023 19:06:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Inside Sam Bankman-Fried’s Family Bubble]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/10/02/inside-sam-bankman-frieds-family-bubble]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-25T10:00:00.000Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650c8f60460686e02830654b/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/231002_r43094.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;article >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attribute-verso-pattern=&quot;article-body&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;ArticlePageChunks&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;figure data-testid=&quot;IframeEmbed&quot; >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;IframeEmbedContainer&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;iframe height=&quot;90&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; sandbox=&quot;allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups&quot; title=&quot;Embedded Frame&quot; data-src=&quot;https://audm.herokuapp.com/player-embed?pub=newyorker&amp;amp;articleID=650b0be0fa4b870beece95e5&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay *; encrypted-media *; clipboard-write; autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture&quot;>;&lt;/iframe>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;p >;The Magistrates Court of the Bahamas, in Nassau, is situated in an imposing pink-and-white building edged with palm trees. On December 13, 2022, Sam Bankman-Fried, the former CEO of the now bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange FTX, arrived there to ask for release on bail after being indicted on eight criminal charges. Bankman-Fried typically wears T-shirts and shorts, no matter the occasion; on this day, he wore, like armor, an ill-fitting navy-blue suit. He&#39;d spent the previous night in jail, where he hadn&#39;t been given the medication he normally took for his depression. But of greater concern was the indictment, unsealed that morning in the United States, which accused him of fraud, conspiracy to commit money laundering, and other crimes that could lead to more than a hundred years in prison.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The evening before, he and a colleague had been working on their laptops in the oceanfront penthouse of a resort where he lived when his parents, who were visiting, called him into a bedroom. Minutes later, according to the colleague, a group of Bahamian law-enforcement officers, accompanied by members of the resort&#39;s staff, strode into the apartment. One officer had a warrant for Bankman-Fried&#39;s arrest.&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;When the officers entered the bedroom, Bankman-Fried asked for a drink of water and seemed to gird himself for what was ahead. “I can give you my passport,” he told a broad-shouldered officer, who in turn suggested that he might want to bring a jacket with him. Passing his phone, wallet, and college class ring to the colleague, whom he&#39;d asked to try to keep his parents calm, Bankman-Fried raised his wrists to be cuffed.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Now, as the court hearing got under way, his parents, Joseph Bankman and Barbara Fried, sat in the third row, feeling shattered. Bankman told me later, “I think most parents would much rather die, frankly, than see their child accused of such horrible things.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Bankman and Fried have long been popular faculty members at Stanford Law School, and known for their involvement in liberal causes. When Sam, their firstborn, was a child, they recognized him as being intellectually exceptional and emotionally atypical—an often isolated boy who entertained himself with baseball statistics and math puzzles. In his twenties, Sam achieved international fame as the head of FTX, a crypto company that he co-founded in 2019, and that promised to bring a measure of legitimacy to a nascent industry sometimes associated with money laundering and corruption. He shared a stage with Bill Clinton and Tony Blair, made the covers of &lt;em>;Fortune&lt;/em>; and &lt;em>;Forbes&lt;/em>;, and persuaded a range of prominent venture-capital investors to give his company hundreds of millions of dollars. Ten months before his arrest, FTX was valued at thirty-two billion dollars. A partner at Sequoia Capital, one of FTX&#39;s biggest financial backers, posited in an online profile of Bankman-Fried, since deleted, that he might become the world&#39;s “first trillionaire.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The academic community in which Bankman-Fried was raised is a place where immense wealth is often discussed with suspicion, even when privately courted. But Bankman-Fried stood out from other young billionaires for his commitment to the effective-altruism movement, some of whose adherents believe in trying to earn as much as possible in order to maximize what they can give away. By the time of his arrest, he had become a major contributor to public-health and other causes, and one of the biggest personal donors in American electoral politics.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;His parents come from modest backgrounds and have lived in the same house—a one-story bungalow on the Stanford campus—since the nineties; they describe themselves as “utilitarian-minded.” As academics, Bankman and Fried share an interest in using tax law as an instrument of social fairness. When Sam and his younger brother, Gabriel, were growing up, there was an ongoing household conversation about what it means to conduct an ethical life, and the brothers later worked together on philanthropic ventures that Sam funded. (Gabriel declined to be interviewed for this article.) As Larry Kramer, a former dean of Stanford Law School, told me, Bankman and Fried “loved that their children had these commitments that were so idealistic and powerful.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The rewards of being Sam&#39;s parents were financial as well as reputational. In 2022, he gave them a gift of ten million dollars; a lawsuit filed by FTX&#39;s bankruptcy estate against Bankman and Fried this September claims that the money was “plunder[ed]” and came from an account that contained customer funds. Their attorneys said that the lawsuit&#39;s claims are “completely false.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Bankman and Fried visited Sam in the Bahamas frequently, sometimes staying at a sixteen-and-a-half-million-dollar, thirty-thousand-square-foot beach house in a gated community. In December, 2021, Bankman took leave from Stanford to work full time at FTX, providing legal, philanthropic, and tax advice for a salary of two hundred thousand dollars a year, plus expenses. Those expenses included twelve-hundred-dollar-a-night “hotel stays,” the lawsuit alleges.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“I&#39;m in on crypto because I want to make the biggest global impact for good,” Bankman-Fried said in an ad that ran in &lt;em>;The New Yorker&lt;/em>;. Like other crypto evangelists, he professed a belief in the power of digital currencies and blockchain technology to eliminate corporate middlemen from the financial system and provide life-changing economic opportunities to the poor. He also relied on slick advertising to do the talking. In one commercial, a plumber realizes that he, too, can make bank in crypto with FTX, and the football legend Tom Brady says, conspiratorially, “You in?”&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;In March, 2022, a month after an extravagant Super Bowl ad starring Larry David (with Bankman-Fried&#39;s father hamming it up in the background in a powdered wig) told viewers not to miss out on FTX&#39;s crypto, the Federal Reserve began raising interest rates, in part to combat inflation. As money became more expensive to borrow, the value of many cryptocurrencies plummeted. Regulators and reporters began revealing that companies in the industry had been lending money to one another in a closed loop to prop up the value of their assets. The allegation that Bankman-Fried created his own closed loop in order to deceive investors and the public is at the crux of the government&#39;s case against him.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In addition to owning FTX, Bankman-Fried owned the majority of a crypto hedge fund called Alameda Research, which was run by Caroline Ellison, a trader whom he sometimes dated. On November 2nd, CoinDesk, an industry news site, reported that Alameda held almost fifteen billion dollars in cryptocurrency assets, a large chunk of which was in FTT—a digital token that FTX had issued. The disclosure raised questions about the true value of Alameda&#39;s holdings and about the conflict of interest between the two supposedly independent companies. Changpeng Zhao (generally known as CZ), the CEO of Binance, a crypto competitor, wrote a series of skeptical tweets indicating that he was dumping his FTT. Alarmed, FTX customers withdrew six billion dollars in just three days. By November 8th, FTX was so broke it stopped honoring withdrawal requests.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;zqibiu&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Some of Bankman-Fried&#39;s employees quit, and he huddled with those who remained, trying to calm investors and raise money to save the company. Meanwhile, a former FTX employee told me, “the parents were freaking out and asking, &#39;What about your legal safety?&#39; ”&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot;

The new CEO, quickly installed, was John Jay Ray III, a bankruptcy lawyer who had overseen the dissolution of Enron; he filed for Chapter 11 and began the process of formally winding FTX down.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Shortly after Bankman-Fried&#39;s arrest, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission said in a lawsuit that he&#39;d caused the loss of more than eight billion dollars in customer assets. Among those reported to be affected were Tom Brady; his ex-wife, the supermodel Gisele Bündchen; the basketball star Steph Curry; the billionaire oil investor Robert Belfer; the tennis star Naomi Osaka; the former Trump spokesman Anthony Scaramucci; a teachers&#39; pension fund; and many ordinary investors, including construction workers, small-business owners, and college students.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In Magistrates Court, Bankman-Fried stared straight ahead as his attorney argued for his release while his extradition was negotiated, noting that he had stayed put and tried to “fix things” for customers when he could have fled the country. A local prosecutor countered that Bankman-Fried was a flight risk, with the means to charter a private plane. When the prosecutor referred to Bankman-Fried as a “fugitive,” his mother laughed darkly. Bail was denied, and eight days later he was extradited to the United States.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Bankman-Fried&#39;s trial is scheduled to begin in New York in early October, and until recently he was preparing for it while under house arrest in California, at his childhood home, which is surrounded by redwood trees and cacti. His parents were back to taking care of him and working to bolster his spirits, as they&#39;d done when he was a child, but now they were also scrambling to find legal escape routes from circumstances they say they had failed to anticipate: that their son, now widely considered a crypto villain, would be facing life in prison, and that they would be accused of being complicit.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;For years, Bankman and Fried have hosted lively Sunday-night dinner parties at their home, during which discussions range from the global crisis of democracy to movies and campus gossip. In December, after a New York judge set their son&#39;s bail at a quarter of a billion dollars, their home was pledged as security for his release. Two friends also served as guarantors: Andreas Paepcke, a computer scientist at Stanford, pledged six figures, as did Larry Kramer and his wife, Sarah, who has since died. In part because Bankman and Fried had been so supportive when Sarah was going through cancer treatments, Kramer told me, “I said yes before Joe even finished asking.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;When I visited the family earlier this year, a security guard they&#39;d hired to comply with the bail terms was sitting outside the house in an SUV, asking visitors to leave their telephones and other electronic devices in their cars. Inside, Bankman-Fried, wearing an ankle bracelet, had commandeered his mother&#39;s study. “It&#39;s mostly case prep,” he told me, gesturing toward two computer monitors. “I mean, there&#39;s not a lot else that I can be doing.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;At thirty-one, he in many ways still looks like a boy: pale and soft with dark eyes and wild, curly hair, which on that day was flat in the back where he had slept on it. The desk at which he sat was cluttered with packs of cinnamon gum, fidget spinners, a mini-fan, deodorant, and a bottle of Adderall. (He was diagnosed as having ADHD, in addition to depression, years ago.) As we spoke, he jiggled his knee and shuffled and reshuffled a deck of cards.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The government alleges that Bankman-Fried engaged in fraud and embezzlement of customer deposits beginning in 2019, and spent those funds on travel, real estate, speculative investments, personal enrichment, and political campaigns. The government further alleges that he “caused” the creation of loopholes in FTX&#39;s computer code which allowed Alameda, his hedge fund, to borrow money that effectively belonged to customers, and that he conspired to bribe at least one Chinese official with forty million dollars to unfreeze FTX assets held in that country. This summer, the US government severed the bribery and four other charges from the case and added a new one: that he&#39;d used stolen customer funds to make more than a hundred million dollars in campaign contributions ahead of the 2022 midterms. “I&#39;m trying not to freak out too much,” Sam said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;At the keyboard, he opened and shared with me several memos he&#39;d written since his arrest—documents replete with links, screenshots, assertions, and intricate explanations that, he claims, will demonstrate his innocence. The gist of his argument is that he made mistakes but did not knowingly commit crimes. At worst, he says, he was unaware of things that, as CEO, he should have known about—particularly the facts that Alameda had accumulated billions of dollars in losses and that FTX customers&#39; money was being used to plug the hole.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Alameda&#39;s position on FTX was substantially bigger than we had realized. That&#39;s one of the bigger fuckups,” he told me. “Which meant that in fact, if Alameda were to go down, FTX would be on the hook for a lot more of that than I had realized.” He said that this prospect did not become clear to him until shortly before the company collapsed. His defense team now has the task of convincing a jury that their client, a quantitative savant, missed something of such importance.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Three of Bankman-Fried&#39;s closest associates have already pleaded guilty and agreed to coöperate in the case against him: Caroline Ellison, the former Alameda CEO; Gary Wang, a co-founder of FTX; and Nishad Singh, FTX&#39;s former director of engineering. In Ellison&#39;s guilty plea, she said that FTX had granted Alameda unlimited borrowing privileges, and that when loans from outside lenders were recalled in June, 2022, FTX funds were used to repay them. She further stated that she conspired with Bankman-Fried to hide the borrowing from Alameda&#39;s lenders by creating a false set of financial statements.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Ellison sounded slightly less certain last November, on the day after FTX stopped honoring customer withdrawals, in a recording likely to be used as evidence at trial. When a colleague asked her during a staff meeting who had authorized Alameda&#39;s borrowing, she said, “Um . 。 。 Sam, I guess.” Bankman-Fried was adamant, in my conversations with him, that prosecutors would not be able to produce any documents showing him authorizing the unlimited borrowing, because, he says, there are none.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;As I sat with him in the study, his mother, who seemed tense, sometimes passed by on her way to the kitchen. Fried retired from full-time teaching last year, hoping to have more time for writing and political activism. After Donald Trump won the Presidency, in 2016, she co-founded Mind the Gap, a political-action committee built around Moneyball-style data analytics aimed at flipping congressional seats from red to blue. When her son was arrested, Fried resigned from the &lt;em >;PAC&lt;/em>; and concentrated on exonerating him. “All four of us care about only one thing, which is Sam&#39;s innocence,” she later told me.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I asked whether she had ever felt compelled to ask her son if he&#39;d done any of the things he&#39;d been charged with. She replied no—she didn&#39;t need to ask. Her son was incapable of dishonesty or stealing, she said. “Sam will never speak an untruth,” she went on. “It&#39;s just not in him.”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;kp5kt&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Fried is a leading scholar of legal ethics. Her best-known book, “The Progressive Assault on Laissez Faire,” is a study of capitalism and the coercive aspects of free markets. “She&#39;s a brilliant critic,” Debra Satz, the dean of Stanford&#39;s School of Humanities and Sciences, said, “and the book really picks apart these debates about freedom and equality.” This year, her intellectual rigor has been applied to her son&#39;s media strategy, which she considered integral to his defense—so integral that she and her husband hired a high-powered PR consultant, Risa Heller, to assist them. The couple embarked on a campaign to spread their perspective: that the press, unfairly assuming that their son is guilty, has failed to examine weaknesses in the government&#39;s case and the role of FTX&#39;s lawyers in the company&#39;s downfall. The campaign was not aided by the September lawsuit against them—a legal action that their attorneys say is a cynical effort by John Ray to influence the outcome of their son&#39;s trial. Calling the suit a waste of creditors&#39; money, Fried said that its real agenda was “to enflame the jury pool on the eve of Sam&#39;s trial by portraying all of us as a pack of thieves.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Robert Gordon, a Stanford Law School colleague, described Fried as one of the most “ethically fastidious” people he knows. “She seems so sure,” he said of her faith in her son, “and the way that she thinks through ethical problems is just so careful. This, of course, is the big mystery at the heart of all this.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;During a hike in the foothills of the mountains near the family&#39;s home, Fried described herself to me as “emotionally reserved, like Sam,” shortly before she teared up. “I don&#39;t care what is said about me, Joe doesn&#39;t care what is said about him,” she said. “Saving Sam is the major project of our lives.” She had lost ten pounds since his legal troubles began, and a recent eye operation had temporarily affected her vision, but she seemed intent on projecting her resolve. Wearing a baseball cap and a bright-red backpack, Fried charged up a hillside, shoes crunching on the dirt. In two hours in the blazing sun, she didn&#39;t take a sip of water.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Before the collapse of FTX, Bankman-Fried led a heady life. “I&#39;d go to a conference, and I&#39;d end up, like, cancelling a meeting with a head of state, because there was a conflicting request from a different head of state that seemed more important,” he told me. “And, you know, there were celebrities all around—and I really don&#39;t give a shit about celebrities. But it is nonetheless a little bit surreal the first few times that it happens.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Bankruptcy documents say that he and his companies spent approximately two hundred and fifty million dollars to buy thirty-five properties in the Bahamas, and reportedly chartered jets to deliver Amazon orders from Miami to island-based employees. In our conversations, Bankman-Fried said that such seemingly profligate expenses were part of an effort to attract talented workers, as many tech-company leaders before him had done. “I did try to make FTX a nice place for people to work,” he said.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Shuffling his cards, he insisted that the only real estate he purchased for himself cost “about two million”—negligible by tech-CEO standards. “I didn&#39;t think it would have been correct for me to live an extremely lavish life style, nor would I have enjoyed it,” he added. In the Bahamas, by his and others&#39; accounts, he did a lot of his own shopping and sometimes cooked for some of his employees. (Beyond Burgers and Beyond Sausages were a staple, he said.) He also paid himself a two-hundred-thousand-dollar salary and never took bonuses, he told me. In court filings, the FTX bankruptcy estate said that it had traced $2.2 billion in payments and loans to Bankman-Fried, primarily from Alameda.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;As we spoke, Fried popped her head in the doorway. “Dinner at seven?”她说。 “How does pasta with vegetables sound?” Bankman-Fried, who barely spoke to his parents while in my presence, nodded. Before we assembled at the table, Bankman emerged with a bottle of California Cabernet.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Bankman-Fried gulped water and swiftly cleaned his plate before returning to his research. But Bankman, wiry and sunny in demeanor, seemed to be trying to convey a sense of normalcy. He is best known for work that jump-started two significant public-interest campaigns. One exposed illegal tax shelters and documented the aggressive marketing of those shelters to corporations by legal and accounting firms. He went on to help write legislation to identify users of the shelters, as a result of which around a billion dollars in unpaid taxes were recouped by the government. The second campaign has been to make tax-return filing easy and free. (California has adopted some of the reforms he fought for.) “You know, tax sounds so dull, and I get it,” he said, “but it&#39;s really about who gets to own what, when the music stops. So, it&#39;s really important for social-justice purposes.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;His son, though ostensibly supportive of crypto regulation in the US, once wrote to a reporter, in an exchange he believed to be off the record, “Fuck regulators . 。 。 they don&#39;t protect customers at all.” Bankman, by contrast, has fought in his career for more government scrutiny of financial transactions. As his son&#39;s business grew, Bankman said, he became interested in how crypto could make money transfers cheaper for consumers, especially in the Global South.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;On an FTX podcast in August, 2022, three months before the implosion, he reportedly said, “From the start, whenever I was useful, I&#39;d lend a hand.” He was often useful, it turned out. According to the bankruptcy estate&#39;s lawsuit, he described Alameda as “a family business” years before his son hired him full time, and employed his connections and expertise to help Alameda and FTX grow. He joined his son at meetings on Capitol Hill aimed at securing changes to the policies that currently make it illegal to operate most crypto exchanges in the US But Bankman&#39;s role in FTX&#39;s charitable giving was what he preferred to talk about with me.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“The company seemed to have such unlimited resources that you could really think big and do great things,” he said. He directed money to a universal-basic-income project in Chicago, and a program that brought mental-health services into troubled homes in South Florida. According to the bankruptcy suit, another favored charity was Stanford. The complaint alleges that he gave his university five and a half million dollars of “FTX Group donations,” for his and Fried&#39;s private professional gain. The day after the suit against them was filed, Stanford announced that it would return the money.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;During my dinner with the family, Sandor, a docile German shepherd, lay underfoot. Before FTX collapsed, the family rarely locked their front door at night, Bankman said, but they were now getting threats, some of them antisemitic. At first, they were advised to hire full-time guards. But, once they calculated the yearly outlay, they decided to supplement their part-time security with Sandor. He is trained to attack if given the correct set of orders, in German. “The trainer came over and put on a bite suit,” Bankman told me. “He said the words and the dog leaped through the air and tore the arm off.”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;3lyq6&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Bankman is, in addition to his other work, a part-time therapist. Especially interested in anxiety, he has written on the intersection of law and psychology and co-hosted, with Stanford students, a podcast on wellness and the legal profession. He has deployed his psychological expertise at home, to try to keep everyone calm, but the morning after our dinner, as he and I walked around campus, his own anxiety was evident. When I asked what his son&#39;s defense would cost, Bankman said, “Substantially everything we have.” But, he added, sounding melancholic, “that&#39;s what money is for.”&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot;

He cared little for toys, apart from puzzles, and seemed largely indifferent to amusement parks and birthday parties. One evening before bed, Fried recalled, Sam and Gabriel, who were still in elementary school, started asking her and Bankman questions about divorce. They knew a kid whose parents were getting one, and wanted to know how it worked, and who got what. “We ended up, like, talking about community-property states, and the alternatives to community-property states, and the different ways of dividing up human capital,” Fried said. The discussion went on for more than an hour, and after she and Bankman left the bedroom she turned to him and said, “We are such idiots. They&#39;re interested in what we&#39;re interested in, they&#39;re just a lot younger and more ignorant.” Fried told me, unable to conceal her pride, “And that changed child rearing for us.” They would give their boys fewer amusement parks and more adult conversation.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Still, a few years later, she arrived home from work one day to find Sam, who rarely cried, in tears. “I am so bored I feel like I&#39;m going to die,” he told her. At that point, Fried said, “we went into high gear.” They enrolled him in a Saturday program called Math Circle, where professors taught logic and problem-solving to precocious students. There were further elevated math classes before school. And in ninth grade Bankman-Fried was admitted to a selective summer program called Canada/USA Mathcamp, where, for the first time, he made close friends. Gary Wang, who would become an FTX co-founder, was one of them. “Sam just got inducted into this other world of math and science nerds with passion, and they were his people,” Fried said.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Sam and Gabe were also encouraged to engage in discussions about human rights and foreign policy at their parents&#39; Sunday-night dinners. Larry Kramer recalled once having a disagreement with the boys and saying something patronizing, like “When you get a little older, you&#39;ll understand.” Later, Kramer said, Bankman took him aside: “They wanted their kids to be treated at the same level as the adults.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;After some hand-wringing about their commitment to public schooling, Fried and Bankman decided that Sam and Gabe would go to high school at Crystal Springs Uplands, a private school that attracted many privileged tech kids, including Steve Jobs&#39;s son. Sam was kind but mostly kept to himself, a former student recalled: “Everyone recognized he was brilliant and super sharp and that school wasn&#39;t challenging for him.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;After graduating, Bankman-Fried enrolled at MIT, imagining that he might become a physicist. His plans began to evolve in his sophomore year, when he learned about the effective-altruism movement. Many effective altruists have taken inspiration from the philosopher Peter Singer, who argues that, when more than a billion people in the developing world are impoverished and suffering, spending on luxuries is morally flawed. The EA movement has considered how much money it would take to save a single imperilled life (approximately four thousand dollars, by one estimate), and some of its adherents have pursued high-paying careers in order to give most of their earnings to organizations that serve vulnerable groups. The movement appeals to people with quantitative orientations.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In 2014, degree in hand, Bankman-Fried took a job at Jane Street Capital, a trading firm that used mathematical models to find and exploit price discrepancies in different securities markets. The firm hired many programmers and math majors and had a geeky, collegial culture; late-night chess tournaments were common. Jane Street attracted other young effective altruists, among them Caroline Ellison, the daughter of MIT professors, who had graduated from Stanford.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Bankman-Fried told me that the job favored people who could keep track of the many variables influencing the market, and who had the ability to synthesize them and make fast trading decisions, all while managing the computer code designed to execute the trades. He described it as “sort of, like, right at the borderline of humans and computers.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Bankman-Fried told me that he gave away about half of what he made at Jane Street, though he declined to reveal the amount. Much of the money, he said, went to animal-welfare organizations and to the Centre for Effective Altruism, for grants and movement-building. After about three years, he left Jane Street and briefly worked for the Centre while thinking of starting a company of his own.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The cryptocurrency boom was under way, and hundreds of digital coins were trading on exchanges around the world. Bankman-Fried became interested in the industry after noticing that the prices were often quoted differently depending on which exchange one was using. A clever trader who was proficient in algorithmic programming was well positioned to exploit the differences—say, buying a bitcoin in the US, selling it in Japan, and profiting on the spread. In 2017, according to court filings, he and a colleague, Tara Mac Aulay, started trading crypto with their own money on various exchanges. Eventually, others joined in—Ellison; Sam&#39;s math-camp friend Wang, who&#39;d worked at Google; and Singh, a friend of Gabe&#39;s who was working at Facebook. Wang and Singh had also become effective altruists, pledging to donate most of their earnings. The friends made the fund official, naming it Alameda Research.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Under Bankman-Fried, its first CEO, Alameda made aggressive bets, often with borrowed money. Because traditional banks wouldn&#39;t lend to crypto companies, the fund had to turn to institutions that catered to crypto, frequently at high interest rates. Alameda&#39;s track record, according to the &lt;em>;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em>;, was inconsistent. A few months after launching, it lost about two-thirds of its assets on a big bet on XRP, a digital currency issued by a blockchain-based payments network. Mac Aulay quit, along with some other employees. Last year, she wrote on Twitter that the departures were in part caused by “concerns over risk management and business ethics.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Bankman-Fried rebuilt the fund and moved it to Hong Kong. In 2019, though, in the face of regulatory uncertainty and tight pandemic restrictions, he turned to his dad, who advised his son to set up shop in a place like the Bahamas, which was trying to generate domestic investment by making itself a crypto hub. FTX launched there later that year as an exchange and a trading platform. Alameda provided legitimacy by trading heavily on the new platform—an arrangement that also created conditions for Alameda to receive favorable treatment (possibly by being able to see what trades others on the exchange were making). The CFTC alleges that FTX gave the fund an “unfair advantage” by exempting it from rules that applied to other users. Bankman-Fried contends that Alameda wasn&#39;t granted preferential access in any way that really mattered: “It didn&#39;t give them the sort of leniency that would fuck over other accounts. We were fairly careful about that.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;In the penthouse, which was valued at more than thirty million dollars and overlooked a yacht-choked marina, Bankman-Fried was living like a fantastically privileged college student, sharing the vast space with Ellison, Wang, Singh, and other employees. He kept odd hours, sometimes napping in a beanbag chair at the office. In 2019, he tweeted about “stimulants when you wake up, sleeping pills if you need them.” Two years later, Ellison tweeted, “Nothing like regular amphetamine use to make you appreciate how dumb a lot of normal, non-medicated human experience is.” (Bankman-Fried has said that he took only prescribed medication, and that his use was on label; Ellison did not comment for this story.)&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Most of FTX&#39;s revenue came through fees that investors paid to trade on its platform. CNBC reported that the exchange&#39;s revenue was a billion dollars in 2021. That fall, Bankman-Fried appointed Ellison and Sam Trabucco, a fellow MIT graduate, to become co-CEOs of Alameda, so that he could focus on FTX. Bankman-Fried has said that he didn&#39;t play a role in investing decisions for Alameda after that point, but, according to the CFTC lawsuit against him, he maintained daily contact with Ellison and Trabucco and stayed intimately involved with the fund.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Bankman-Fried was also becoming a kind of international statesman of crypto. Zeke Faux, a Bloomberg reporter and the author of a book about the industry, “Number Go Up,” told me, “His trick with the media was just being very accessible. If a crypto newsletter needed a quote about Shiba Inu coin prices, he was there. And on the way up this was really effective, and he was able to create this image as the only honest guy in crypto.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Bankman-Fried told me, of that time, “I was on the path to accomplishing what I wanted to accomplish.” Further affirmation seemed to come when the best-selling author Michael Lewis started hanging around the office and accompanying him to meetings. Bankman-Fried gave Lewis unrestricted access for a book that is set to be published next month.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;While audited financial statements for 2021 show a profitable company, FTX, apparently through a loophole in the tax code that applies to cryptocurrencies, was able to report $3.7 billion in carryover losses on its tax returns, greatly reducing its tax bill. Later, accounting experts would see some red flags in the financial statements, including the fact that two different, relatively unknown auditors had prepared them. As one expert speculated on CoinDesk, “With the benefit of hindsight, we can see it perhaps suggested that Bankman-Fried didn&#39;t want any firm to see the whole picture.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The following year, a murky FTX transaction implicated Bankman-Fried&#39;s parents directly. During the company&#39;s property-buying frenzy, the couple signed a deed to the sixteen-and-half-million-dollar beach house in the Bahamas where they stayed, although they hadn&#39;t paid anything toward it. The bankruptcy suit insinuates that the arrangement was made at their son&#39;s instigation. Bankman-Fried and his parents strongly deny this.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In an explanation that reflects more carelessness about signing legal documents than Stanford law professors typically possess, Bankman told &lt;em>;The New Yorker&lt;/em>; that he and his wife signed the deed in error; that the house was intended to be company property; and that, after belatedly grasping the US tax implications of attesting to owning it, they fulfilled their legal obligations by alerting company lawyers to their concerns. A spokesperson for the couple said, “Outside counsel confirmed to Joe and Barbara that FTX would have all beneficial ownership of the house and agreed to document that in writing.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Bankman-Fried&#39;s ambitions for his philanthropy grew along with FTX. After the &lt;em >;COVID&lt;/em>;-19 pandemic began, he joined multiple billionaires, including Peter Thiel and Patrick Collison, in funnelling money into efforts to find treatments. Edward Mills, a professor at McMaster University, whose lab conducted one of the largest &lt;em >;COVID&lt;/em>; therapeutics trials in the world, was an FTX beneficiary. He told me that Bankman-Fried wanted to provide funding to hundreds of biotech companies to develop vaccines and treatments, which he hoped could be rapidly tested through an international network of clinical-trial sites. “Sam had a vision of a world free of disease.” Mills said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;At the same time, Bankman-Fried was also becoming one of the largest political donors in Washington, personally contributing some forty million dollars ahead of the 2022 midterms, according to OpenSecrets, a nonprofit that tracks money in politics. He was one of the top CEO donors to Joe Biden&#39;s 2020 Presidential campaign, giving more than five million dollars (an “anti-Trump” donation, he told me). He also made dark-money contributions to Republicans, which he wouldn&#39;t quantify. One of his goals was to counter extremist candidates in Republican primaries, he said, and by keeping his payments under the radar he could avoid the backlash that would ensue if candidates were found to have taken money from a known Democratic donor.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;sjh0kx&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;By the end of 2022, however, he had no more money to give, and, of all the causes he espoused, the effective-altruism movement in particular was reeling from his downfall. Not long before Bankman-Fried&#39;s arrest, one of the movement&#39;s co-founders, William MacAskill, wrote on Twitter, “If he lied and misused customer funds he betrayed me, just as he betrayed his customers, his employees, his investors, &amp;amp; the communities he was a part of.” Peter Singer told me that although he thinks the movement will persist, Bankman-Fried&#39;s arrest has made the public more cynical about individuals trying to earn money to give it away. And, in an online effective-altruism forum, community members mourned the fact that FTX customers&#39; lives had been ruined while also berating themselves for doing weak due diligence before, as one member put it, “entrusting a decent chunk of the financing and reputation of the entire EA movement to an offshore crypto business.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;For FTX, the end began in the spring of 2022, when, in the face of rising interest rates, crypto darlings began to falter, sending waves of financial stress through the industry. Bitcoin dropped by twenty-seven per cent in eight days; terraUSD and Luna, two coins that provided liquidity to other crypto firms, lost almost all their value; Celsius Network, a crypto exchange, collapsed; and Three Arrows Capital, a ten-billion-dollar crypto hedge fund, was forced to liquidate after heavy losses. That June, a psychiatrist who had treated Bankman-Fried in California moved to the Bahamas to become a life coach for his rattled staff.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Nonetheless, through the summer, Bankman-Fried seemed to signal that he was unaffected by the turmoil in his industry, announcing plans to rescue some of the crypto companies that hadn&#39;t fared as well as FTX had. In late October, he visited Saudi Arabia to try to interest new investors. On November 2nd, the CoinDesk article about Alameda&#39;s balance sheet came out.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;The following Sunday, when CZ, the Binance CEO, tweeted his doubts and accelerated the rush of customer-withdrawal requests, Bankman-Fried&#39;s parents were in the Bahamas having an approximation of their Stanford Sunday-night dinners with FTX employees. Mid-meal, a company lawyer took a call, became agitated, and left.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“It was incredibly stressful and overwhelming,” Bankman-Fried told me of the following days. He says he figured he could raise several billion dollars from investors to tide the company over and fulfill withdrawal requests. He could then sell off assets to raise more cash while keeping the exchange functioning. “There were way too many things I needed to be doing,” he said. “It was kind of scary.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The day after CZ indicated that he was dumping his FTT, FTX acknowledged that it was experiencing a liquidity crisis, and Bankman-Fried started looking publicly for a bailout. Around that time, Bahamian police paid a visit to the office. The visit was likely in regard to a security breach, but some employees started to panic that they might be in trouble, and others grew angry. “I think that, somehow, we all had this superhuman sense of him,” a former employee told me. Now their leader was tainted, and so were their résumés. Soon, the employee went on, several of them began taking turns staying with Singh, a committed member of the EA community, out of concern that he might be suicidal. (Singh&#39;s attorney did not respond to requests for comment.) Three months later, Singh pleaded guilty to wire fraud, conspiracy to commit fraud, conspiracy to commit money laundering, and conspiracy to violate campaign-finance laws. The recent suit against Bankman-Fried&#39;s parents cited an e-mail from Fried to her son suggesting that he use Singh&#39;s name instead of his own when making a one-million-dollar contribution to Mind the Gap, in order to avoid creating “the impression that funding MTG is a family affair.” Fried told &lt;em>;The New Yorker&lt;/em>; that this was “a perfectly legal and commonplace practice,” and said that her son had donated roughly a tenth of that figure to her &lt;em >;PAC&lt;/em>;.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;As FTX&#39;s downward spiral continued, Bankman began speaking with defense lawyers and tried to get his son to join the conversations. But, whether determined or delusional, Bankman-Fried was solely focussed on persuading people to entrust him with hundreds of millions more dollars, to save the company. At times, according to Bloomberg, his father was beside him, making calls on his behalf, to little avail. Many people were quitting, packing their suitcases, and leaving the island, said the colleague who, a few weeks later, would be taking Bankman-Fried&#39;s class ring and wallet before officers placed him in handcuffs: “At some point, Sam was practically the only one left.”&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;a data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a27627&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a27627&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;“Should I pack this or will there be one on Earth we can use”&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/650e246b085421574e15bd73/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/231002_a27627.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/650e246b085421574e15bd73/master/w_120,c_limit/231002_a27627.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/650e246b085421574e15bd73/master/w_240,c_limit/231002_a27627.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/650e246b085421574e15bd73/master/w_320,c_limit/231002_a27627.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/650e246b085421574e15bd73/master/w_640,c_limit/231002_a27627.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/650e246b085421574e15bd73/master/w_960,c_limit/231002_a27627.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/650e246b085421574e15bd73/master/w_1280,c_limit/231002_a27627.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/650e246b085421574e15bd73/master/w_1600,c_limit/231002_a27627.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/a>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;“Should I pack this or will there be one on Earth we can use?”&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;Cartoon by Michael J.

In addition to Ellison&#39;s testimony, Wang, who pleaded guilty to four fraud charges, is expected to say he helped create the computer-code back door that allowed Alameda to borrow so much from FTX. Singh is also expected to take the stand.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;It is standard practice for banks to take depositors&#39; money and use it for other activities. Bankman-Fried&#39;s defense could try to argue that FTX customers knew their money might be used by the company for other purposes. Another defense argument is likely to be that FTX&#39;s external legal counsel, the firm Sullivan &amp;amp; Cromwell, and Ryne Miller, the general counsel of FTX.US, the company&#39;s American subsidiary, may have been motivated by conflicts of interest. Miller was a former partner at Sullivan &amp;amp; Cromwell, a prominent firm whose marquee client is Goldman Sachs. In 2021, Miller helped hire Sullivan &amp;amp; Cromwell to serve as one of FTX&#39;s outside legal advisers.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Bankman-Fried says that, in the days leading up to his decision to sign the change-of-control agreement that allowed the company to file for bankruptcy, Miller and Sullivan &amp;amp; Cromwell attorneys sent him numerous messages pressuring him to do so—a campaign that Bankman-Fried describes as “harassment, intimidation, coercion and misrepresentation.” His records show that, on the night of November 8th, Miller sent a text to him and to FTX leadership that said, “I need to wire SullCrom $4M to make sure we are all represented through this. And we preserve any value that is left. Tomorrow. From FTX.com cash. Who can do it? I&#39;m in charge now.” Miller declined to comment. Sullivan &amp;amp; Cromwell declined to comment on the record, but, in a declaration filed with the bankruptcy court, Andrew Dietderich, a Sullivan &amp;amp; Cromwell partner, said of Bankman-Fried&#39;s account of being pressured to file for Chapter 11, “This is false.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Around four-thirty the next morning, an exhausted Bankman-Fried clicked the DocuSign link Miller had sent him and electronically signed the document. About ten minutes later, he says, an emergency-funding offer of about four hundred million dollars came through from Tron, a blockchain platform. Tron&#39;s founder, Justin Sun, told Bloomberg TV that the offer was “subject to due diligence.” Bankman-Fried said that he tried to rescind his signature but couldn&#39;t.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“That is like a singular fixed moment around which everything else rotates,” the former colleague said. “That was incredibly palpable. I saw a man who was haunted by the fact that he could not wrap his mind around what had happened. It&#39;s like losing your keys and you&#39;ve checked the room and you&#39;ve checked the sofa and you can&#39;t figure out where they went.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Around the same time, Miller and Sullivan &amp;amp; Cromwell went to federal prosecutors, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the CFTC to report alleged accounting problems at FTX.US. And, after the law firm helped choose John Ray to lead the company through bankruptcy, he hired it as the lead legal adviser. The firm went on to bill more than a hundred million dollars for the first several months of work for the bankruptcy, with hundreds of millions more likely to come. (A Sullivan &amp;amp; Cromwell spokesperson directed &lt;em>;The New Yorker&lt;/em>; to an effusive June report by a fee examiner from Godfrey &amp;amp; Kahn that acknowledged the “remarkable” fees but went on to praise the firm&#39;s “creativity, professionalism, and personal sacrifice” in “transforming a smoldering heap of wreckage into a functioning Chapter 11.”) But last January a trustee policing bankruptcies for conflicts of interest on behalf of the Justice Department filed an objection to the firm&#39;s appointment.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Although a judge denied the trustee&#39;s motion, Jonathan Lipson, a bankruptcy expert at Temple University, later filed a brief in support of the trustee, noting that, in January, Ray had referred to FTX as a “dumpster fire.” If that was true, he wrote, it was worth questioning why Sullivan &amp;amp; Cromwell hadn&#39;t seen it burning sooner.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;avgsx&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Even if the defense can prove that Sullivan &amp;amp; Cromwell behaved unethically, few legal experts I spoke with think that the court will be persuaded by Bankman-Fried&#39;s contention that, if he&#39;d had more time, FTX&#39;s problems could have been corrected. One expert in white-collar law likened it to taking a hundred dollars from the collection plate at church and hoping to gamble with it at the race track, win, and put a hundred and fifty dollars back onto the plate. “It&#39;s one thing to take your own money and bet on something you think is going to be a winner,” he said. “But there&#39;s no excuse for taking someone else&#39;s money.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Intensifying the legal peril is Ray&#39;s claim, from his first legal filing as head of FTX, that he has never “seen such a complete failure of corporate controls and such a complete absence of trustworthy financial information as occurred here.” Testifying before Congress last December, he compared FTX executives&#39; conduct unfavorably to Enron&#39;s. “Crimes that were committed there were highly orchestrated financial machinations by highly sophisticated people to keep transactions off balance sheets,” he said. “This is just taking money from customers and using it for your own purpose.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Bankman-Fried&#39;s defense has argued that the government is effectively deputizing the company to aid the prosecution. The defense has further complained that Ray and his colleagues control FTX&#39;s servers and files, and that they have denied Bankman-Fried access to documents that might exonerate him, including records of changes to the computer-code base that show exactly who enabled Alameda to engage in unrestricted borrowing from FTX. Ray declined to comment, and the prosecution denies that Bankman-Fried&#39;s access has been impeded.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;On December 12th, a month after the Chapter 11 filing, Bankman-Fried was in the penthouse drafting testimony about FTX&#39;s collapse, which he had promised to give the next day to the US House Financial Services Committee. Not long before Bahamian officials showed up to arrest him, he had shared a Google doc of the testimony with his mom and his colleague, and one of them struck out his opening line: “I would like to start by formally stating, under oath: I fucked up.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Financial-fraud cases of this magnitude often end with guilty pleas, so court trials like Bankman-Fried&#39;s are relatively rare. After years of sustaining harsh criticism for the lack of prosecutions related to the 2008 financial crisis, and for doing little as crypto grew into a speculative bubble, the Justice Department and securities regulators seem to be using the FTX case as an opportunity to project a newfound toughness on financial crime.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Bankman-Fried is already facing consequences for trying to improve his public image in advance of the trial. This summer, the &lt;em>;Times&lt;/em>; published portions of a diary kept by Ellison, in which she worried about being in over her head. Bankman-Fried&#39;s legal team admitted in a court filing that he had provided materials to the &lt;em>;Times&lt;/em>;. The lead prosecutor, Danielle Sassoon, said that the leak was an attempt by Bankman-Fried to intimidate a witness, and not his first. She filed a motion asking that he and his parents be barred from making public statements about his case, and that he be transferred from house arrest to jail.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Bankman-Fried&#39;s defense lawyer Mark Cohen, of Cohen &amp;amp; Gresser, argued that Bankman-Fried had First and Sixth Amendment rights to respond to media inquiries about his case, and that his imprisonment would hamper his ability to prepare for his trial. But Judge Lewis A. Kaplan, who is presiding over the case, agreed in July to the gag order, and in August he remanded Bankman-Fried to the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, to await the start of his trial. My conversations with Bankman-Fried thus came to a halt.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Last December, around the time of the arrest, his parents wrote him a letter. “You are innocent,” they said, and reassured him, “By a year from now, there is a nontrivial chance that the world&#39;s fury may shift to some other villain.” Ten months in, his parents&#39; very cautious optimism seems wishful. A fourth top executive in Bankman-Fried&#39;s inner circle, Ryan Salame, took a plea deal in September.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In an e-mail to &lt;em>;The New Yorker&lt;/em>;, Fried characterized the actions of both the prosecution and the bankruptcy estate as “McCarthyite” and a “relentless pursuit of total destruction,” which is enabled by “a credulous public that will believe anything they say.” She went on, “It takes a lifetime to build up a reputation as honorable people. It takes five minutes to destroy it, which they now have done.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;As their son&#39;s October trial date nears, Fried and Bankman have started talking about how, should he lose, they might handle his appeal. They take turns flying from California to visit him at the Brooklyn jail every Tuesday. But at Stanford they determinedly continue their famous Sunday-night dinners—staying “in the game,” their colleague Robert Gordon said, “even as their lives are collapsing around them.” ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 25 Sep 2023 19:06:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[A New York Daffodil?

The rose is also, thanks to Ronald Reagan, the official flower of the nation, but not the official flower of New York City, which was decreed the daffodil, in a short speech by Mayor Michael Bloomberg, on a spring day in 2007. “Just because they liked something, now it&#39;s our &#39;city flower,&#39; ” Marielle Anzelone, a former Parks Department employee and a self-described “disgruntled botanist,” said the other day. Daffodils (&lt;em>;Narcissus pseudonarcissus&lt;/em>;) were chosen because of their connection to an initiative memorializing September 11th victims. “To caterpillars, daffodils are like plastic pink flamingos! They&#39;re completely meaningless,” Anzelone said. “I like daffodils, too—to be clear, I&#39;m a really big fan—but at an ecological level they&#39;re problematic.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;On a recent Thursday, Anzelone visited Inwood Hill Park, in Manhattan, to discuss daffodil alternatives—flowering fruit trees, tick-infested tall grasses, weeds sprouting from the sidewalk. (Emerson described a weed as “a plant whose virtues have not yet been discovered.”) Native plants provide a habitat for the caterpillars, butterflies, and other bugs that make the city&#39;s nature natural. At around four o&#39;clock, Anzelone approached a man who appeared to be living in a van parked in the shade of a &lt;em>;Quercus palustris&lt;/em>; and told him, “I&#39;m organizing a campaign for New Yorkers to vote for an official wildflower!” She had winnowed the candidates down to five flowers in the five boroughs, in advance of Election Day, in November, when she will tally up the online votes and present them to the City Council, which she hopes will anoint an official city wildflower. The man nodded and said, “You should make some flyers or something.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;A campaign event was already under way nearby. Representatives from a few boroughs had convened for a nature walk, to allow citizens to stump for the wildflowers they&#39;d nominated. The candidates: wild columbine (&lt;em>;Aquilegia canadensis&lt;/em>;, of Brooklyn), pinxter azalea (&lt;em>;Rhododendron periclymenoides&lt;/em>;, of Staten Island), spicebush (&lt;em>;Lindera benzoin&lt;/em>;, of the Bronx), butterfly weed (&lt;em>;Asclepias tuberosa&lt;/em>;, of Manhattan), and the giant sunflower (&lt;em>;Helianthus giganteus&lt;/em>;, of Queens). Anzelone, who wore blue shorts and a white blouse, said, “A wildflower is just an angiosperm.” In other words, “If it grows in the wild and flowers, then it&#39;s a wildflower!”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Trees can be wildflowers,” Jamie Boyer, a spicebush partisan and an employee of the New York Botanical Garden, said. “My shrub is a wildflower.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The walk commenced. Bark was admired, foliage smelled, licked, and chewed. (“Is your mouth a little numb?” Evie Hantzopoulos, of the Queens Botanical Garden, asked, after Boyer encouraged the group to eat some &lt;em>;Sassafras albidum&lt;/em>;.) Manhattan&#39;s representative was conjured via FaceTime. Poison ivy (&lt;em>;Toxicodendron radicans&lt;/em>;) was unsuccessfully avoided, and trash (&lt;em>;quisquiliae&lt;/em>;) was spotted amid the trees. As the walk concluded, someone shouted, “Civilization!”&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Later, near some teens getting stoned on a bench, stump speeches were made. Staten Island&#39;s spokeswoman was absent, so Anzelone offered an unrehearsed pitch: “I grew up in New Jersey, where a lot of people have azaleas planted, so there&#39;s that!”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Manhattan: “Butterfly milkweed is the perfect New Yorker! It&#39;s tough and it plays well with others. It&#39;s brash and bright orange and provides a lot of health to pollinators!”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Brooklyn: “Eastern columbine has five separate petals, which, I feel, speaks to the unison of the five boroughs.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The Bronx: “Spicebush plays an incredibly important role in a forest, like the one New York City would have looked like back in the sixteen-hundreds, which would have been dominated by tons of spicebush, in the understory.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Queens: “There&#39;s the physical properties of the plant”—the giant sunflower—“and there&#39;s also the symbolism behind it. Physically, it grows to super-enormous heights. It&#39;s a great pollinator for bees. Birds love it, creatures love it, and people love it. Who doesn&#39;t love a sunflower? They&#39;re happy. Positivity! They follow the sun. They &lt;em>;love&lt;/em>; the sun. But they also symbolize things in different cultures: longevity, adoration, good luck, good fortune, hope, optimism.” A pause. “And they can grow between the cracks.” ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;gs4yis&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;5kt7po&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 25 Sep 2023 19:06:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Graham Swift on the Human Wilderness]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.newyorker.com/books/this-week-in-fiction/graham-swift-10-02-23]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-25T10:00:00.000Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/636eb48b6c917bf7dbeea687/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/TWIF_Swift.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;article >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attribute-verso-pattern=&quot;article-body&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;ArticlePageChunks&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;The narrator of your story “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/10/02/bruises-fiction-graham-swift&quot;>;Bruises&lt;/a>;” is a former British soldier who fought in Iraq. He is clearly suffering from PTSD, though he doesn&#39;t refer to it in any way. What drew you to the idea of writing about this character?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;It was never an “idea.” The story began, as several of my stories have begun, with just a phrase—an ordinary phrase—lodging itself in my head in an insistent, apparently meaningful way. The phrase was “The quiet ones are the worst,” a common enough phrase that might be used in many contexts. I felt it implied something ominous and violent. Before I knew it, the phrase was not so much in &lt;em>;my&lt;/em>; head as in the head of my suddenly emerging central character and narrator—a man who wants to be quiet, who doesn&#39;t like noise, but is in some way deeply disturbed. And, before I knew it again, I was dealing with an ex-soldier, suffering from what we now call PTSD—though in another time it might have been called something else or had no name at all. All this happened very quickly in my mind, in the same time it takes to read the first two paragraphs of the story. But, equally quickly, I knew certain other separate things—for example, that this ex-soldier was in a relationship with a woman who was starting to find him hard to live with, and her name was Shirley. Don&#39;t ask me why.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;The character&#39;s PTSD has him going to a pub a few nights a week, in order to start fights, which he seems not always to win. What relief do you think he gets from that physical aggression, both that he inflicts on others and that others inflict on him?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;I&#39;m not sure that he gets any relief. That&#39;s why it&#39;s a repeated process—a compulsion, like a drug. There&#39;s much in this story that isn&#39;t rational at all: a “quiet” man who yet seeks violence, who starts fights in pubs. This same man has a job as an orderly in a psychiatric hospital. As he puts it, “It was work I could get,” but he clearly doesn&#39;t find a psychiatric hospital strange or frightening, as most people would. He feels almost at home in it and identifies with the patients. He knows that he might easily be one of them.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;The narrator seems to understand a lot of things about himself, and yet perhaps isn&#39;t always able to make sense of what he understands. That must have been a complicated inconsistency for you, as the author, to convey. How did you walk that narrow line between insight and interpretation?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;You&#39;re right. The narrator has a strong sense of being—just—on the safe side of a line. He might be tempted to cross it and lose all control and understanding, but he doesn&#39;t do this. Perhaps this borderline condition is more painful than tipping over into mindlessness. But my character isn&#39;t deranged. On the outside, at least, he&#39;s quite “normal” and likable—or I think he is. He genuinely does want a quiet life. He&#39;s not unintelligent. He has his share of ordinary human decency, and he has, significantly, a resilient, stoical sense of humor. For most of the time, he exists quite well in the “normal,” sane world, but then, as he puts it, he will “go into himself”—into inner turmoil. It&#39;s a challenge, perhaps, to depict such stuff—or, rather, to create a character who depicts it himself—but I think that this is part of any serious writer&#39;s job: you sometimes have to leave the safe paths and go into the human wilderness.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;All this said, I hope that my story finds its particular way of dealing with the narrator&#39;s plight. To put it broadly, and to forget for a moment clinical terminology such as “PTSD,” my character knows about hell. When he “goes into himself,” he goes into a sort of hell: the hell of his memories of war and the hell of what war has done to him. “Hell” is a word, an idea that reverberates through the story, even in the common use made of it in the expression “go to hell.” My character is told to go to hell more than once in the story, but his underlying, if unspoken, position is that he&#39;s already been there, or—more disturbingly—that he&#39;s already in it. I&#39;ve mentioned his sense of humor. I&#39;d go further and say that my story is essentially a comic story. It&#39;s about deadly serious stuff, terrible stuff, yet its central event is an almost slapstick enactment of the process of being sent to hell, of going to hell—which turns out, redemptively, to have the opposite effect to what was intended.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;The narrator has an urge to confess his sins to a priest, although he isn&#39;t Catholic. His sin, as he sees it, is murder—but he doesn&#39;t know whether to think of it as such, since it was committed in the line of duty. I&#39;m sure that many veterans have similar thoughts. Do you think your character finds some kind of absolution in the story?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I&#39;ve already used the word “redemptively.” Let&#39;s say the story ends quite happily—and not in hell. “Hell” has a primarily religious connotation, and my narrator, though not religious, does indeed have the urge to confess to a priest. He gets no further in this than just going sometimes to sit by himself in a Catholic church. It&#39;s where he can be “quiet.” So: we have a quiet man who goes to pubs to start fights, who works in a mental hospital, and who sometimes, secretly, visits a church. We&#39;re clearly in potent, volatile territory. I&#39;m not alone among writers in being drawn to a line of Browning&#39;s: “Our interest&#39;s on the dangerous edge of things,” which is followed, in the next lines, by the examples “The honest thief, the tender murderer, / The superstitious atheist.” Those last two contradictions, at least, would fit my character as he sits in a church, contemplating things that he&#39;s seen and done.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;“Bruises,” as you and I discussed while editing, is driven by this man&#39;s particular voice, his locutions, what he is able or not able to express. How different would it be if it were written in the third person, from the point of view of an omniscient narrator?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;2yn0p&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;6qhf3e&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;It would be very different, and I&#39;m not sure if it would be viable at all. My story needs direct access to my character&#39;s voice—meaning his spoken voice and the voice of his thoughts, both of which use the same language. In short, my character needs to be the narrator. I&#39;ve said that when the story came to me certain things “arrived” very quickly. One such thing was that it would be written in the first person. I&#39;ve seldom written anything where I&#39;ve had to consider as an initial issue (though writing may have plenty of other quandaries!): Should it be in the first or third person? I&#39;ve just known. And I&#39;ve seldom begun a story, then found myself thinking after a while, Perhaps this should be written in the third, not the first, person, or vice versa.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;It&#39;s true that there was a time when I favored, almost exclusively, the first person. I felt more in tune with it and with its possibilities. I was even rather suspicious of the third person and its “omniscience.” Then I began to write some things in the third person—though, I hoped, in a very intimate kind of third person that might almost be mistaken for first person. Now I think either option is open to me, but I know very quickly which it is. My character&#39;s voice in “Bruises” is a very colloquial voice, and I&#39;m a great believer in colloquial language. Seemingly uneducated or inarticulate, it can be extraordinarily expressive, truthful—and funny. Whereas educated language, though it has its virtues, can be good at evading things, or, when saying them, being too solemn about it. It was, above all, writing my novel “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Last-Orders-Graham-Swift/dp/0679766626&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Last-Orders-Graham-Swift/dp/0679766626&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Last-Orders-Graham-Swift/dp/0679766626&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;Last Orders&lt;/a>;” that taught me this. It was my breakthrough with colloquial language.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;I can think of several short stories that revolve around veterans with PTSD, including George Saunders&#39;s “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2011/06/13/home-george-saunders&quot;>;Home&lt;/a>;” and Jim Shepard&#39;s “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2010/11/08/boys-town&quot;>;Boys Town&lt;/a>;.” Were you inspired by any other fictional narratives or factual accounts?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I haven&#39;t read the stories you mention, and while writing “Bruises” I don&#39;t think I had any other piece of writing, fiction or nonfiction, in mind. It&#39;s possible that there was another, very unliterary, source. I&#39;ve said that my character works in a psychiatric hospital. I worked myself, ages ago, in what would have been called then a “mental hospital”—a summer job when I was a student. Whether it prompted this story or not, I&#39;d say that my time working there was one of the most instructive in my life. It taught me things I was never taught as a student—things about human nature. And I&#39;m sure that it generally influenced me as a writer. I&#39;m speaking of the late sixties or early seventies, when a “mental hospital” was something very different from a present-day psychiatric hospital and was closer to what the Victorians would have called an asylum. It was a place of repressed and sometimes actual violence, and a place, dominantly and depressingly, for long-term inmates, for the old. There were people there who, in their younger days, had been murderers, and—to come back to war and PTSD and to another form of killing—there were men there, old men, who were still suffering, poor souls, from the mental effects of not just the Second but even the First World War. ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;ioj17u&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 25 Sep 2023 19:06:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[How Soccer Players Restarted Spain’s #MeToo Movement]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.newyorker.com/news/q-and-a/how-soccer-players-restarted-spains-metoo-movement]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-25T10:00:00.000Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650daafa085421574e15bc8b/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Taladrid-MeToo-Spain-Final.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;article >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attribute-verso-pattern=&quot;article-body&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;ArticlePageChunks&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Late last month, amid a roaring crowd, members of the Spanish national soccer team walked up the podium at Accor Stadium, in Sydney, Australia, to be presented with the World Cup trophy. It was a historic victory for Spain—the first time its women&#39;s soccer team had reached, let alone won, the tournament&#39;s final. Waiting for the players was a cadre of officials, including Luis Rubiales, the president of the Royal Spanish Football Federation, who stood next to Queen Letizia and her sixteen-year-old daughter, Sofía. TV commentators noted the president&#39;s effusiveness and his disregard for protocol; earlier, he had grabbed his crotch in the stands. But, when he pulled one of the players, Jenni Hermoso, toward him and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/sports/sporting-scene/the-kissing-scandal-after-spains-womens-world-cup-win&quot;>;pressed his lips&lt;/a>; against hers, the commentators were conspicuously silent. Minutes later, as fireworks burst in the stadium and the players hoisted their trophy, the first reactions surfaced online: “What the hell was he thinking?”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Questioned by reporters, Rubiales initially cast his critics as “idiots,” arguing that it had merely been a “peck between two friends.” In Spain and abroad, viewers offered a reading of their own: Rubiales had abused his authority, in an unmistakable case of assault. As calls for his resignation mounted, Rubiales delivered an address to the federation in which he described himself as a victim of “false feminism.” The kiss had been “spontaneous, mutual, euphoric, and consented to,” Rubiales went on, “exactly the kind I could have given a daughter.” He added, to the audience&#39;s applause, “I will &lt;em>;not&lt;/em>; step down.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Rubiales had been the subject of controversy in the past—he has faced charges of corruption, as well as accusations of sponsoring orgies with the federation&#39;s money, which he categorically denied. The players had long expressed frustration with the organization. Last fall, fifteen players submitted a letter to the federation, saying that they would not play in this year&#39;s World Cup without changes in personnel. (Only three of them did.) “The incident I have been involved in is the final straw,” Hermoso said, in a statement released within hours of Rubiales&#39;s remarks. “Such attitudes have been part of our team&#39;s day-to-day for years.” She made clear that she had never consented to the kiss. “No person, in any work, sports, or social setting, should be a victim of these behaviors,” she wrote.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Hermoso not only denounced Rubiales; she also described the pressure she faced to clear his name. In private, members of the federation had called on Hermoso and her family to defend Rubiales and “justify” his behavior. The federation issued a statement backing Rubiales, but, by then, the Spanish public had reached a different conclusion. As Alexia Putellas, one of the players, said in a &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://twitter.com/alexiaputellas/status/1695052143978295707&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://twitter.com/alexiaputellas/status/1695052143978295707&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/alexiaputellas/status/1695052143978295707&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;tweet&lt;/a>; that went viral, “&lt;em>;Se acabó&lt;/em>;”—enough.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;When the case reached the courtroom, earlier this month, Rubiales submitted his resignation. He is facing charges of sexual assault and coercion, owing to his repeated appeals for Hermoso to side with him. (He pleaded not guilty and continues to deny the charges.) The case has provoked new conversations around abuse in élite sports and reinvigorated the Spanish #MeToo movement. To discuss its evolution, I spoke with Ana Pastor, a prominent Spanish journalist, who founded the media outlet Newtral.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Unlike in the United States, the debate around #MeToo in Spain had previously centered on the accounts of ordinary women, who came forth with personal stories of abuse. Pastor noted that, around the time that the accusations against &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/from-aggressive-overtures-to-sexual-assault-harvey-weinsteins-accusers-tell-their-stories&quot;>;Harvey Weinstein&lt;/a>; surfaced, Spain was consumed by a case known as La Manada—the Pack—involving the gang rape of an eighteen-year-old woman in the city of Pamplona, which made it all the way to the Spanish Supreme Court. The graphic nature of the case, along with lower courts&#39; decisions to clear the defendants of sexual-assault charges, finding them guilty of the lesser crime of sexual abuse, drew widespread outcry. Ultimately, the court elevated the initial ruling to rape and the defendants&#39; sentence from nine to fifteen years in prison.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Pastor painted a picture of a country that has gone from suppressing conversations around abuse to openly discussing its complexities. Spain is also, like the United States, revisiting past controversies about gender-based violence. We began our discussion by talking about Nevenka Fernández, a former councilwoman in the northern town of Ponferrada, who captured national attention in the early two-thousands after accusing her then boss, Ponferrada&#39;s mayor, of sexual harassment. In 2021, Pastor co-produced a documentary series on the case. Our conversation has been translated from Spanish and edited for length and clarity.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;I would like us to go back to 2001, the year in which Nevenka Fernández filed her complaint against Mayor Ismael Álvarez. She was the first woman to speak up and win a sexual-harassment complaint against a public figure like Álvarez. How was the news covered back then? What kind of discussions did the case prompt inside newsrooms?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;I was working in radio, for Cadena &lt;em >;SER&lt;/em>;—those were my early days as a journalist. And I remember seeing the image of a very young woman, completely distraught, appearing on television to deliver a news conference. And I also remember the backlash—all the comments about her, but also against her. The media was—and still is—a reflection of society. There was widespread support for the mayor but not so much for the victim. You hardly ever heard arguments in her favor.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;You partnered with Netflix a few years ago to produce a documentary about Nevenka&#39;s case. Tell me how the project came into being, and why you decided it was the right time to bring her story back.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;I became obsessed with her story, in part because I sensed that, in some way, she was being left socially isolated. She and I have known each other for practically twenty years, and for a long time we talked about the possibility of her telling her story, until, one summer, she told me, “Ana, I feel ready.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;We travelled out of Spain, where she lives with her family, and we began filming. Deep down, my dream was to show her that this country had changed and that, this time around, people would respond differently and say, “Of course, we stand with you, Nevenka.” As a matter of fact, around the première, we held a live debate in a packed theatre to talk about how Nevenka has changed the history of harassment in our country. We wanted to figure out if people in Spain saw Nevenka with different eyes. We invited various Spanish public figures from different generations, and we realized that that was indeed the case. The reaction from the public has since been “I&#39;m sorry, Nevenka.” And, also, “Thank you, Nevenka.” Thank you, because she charted a path, judicially and socially, that has improved the lives of many other women.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;It took twenty-two years for the town of Ponferrada to officially recognize Nevenka&#39;s case and for Ponferrada city hall, where she worked alongside the mayor, to issue a public apology. How do you explain that lag?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Well, it is the evolution of our country, and I would like to think that of many others. It is true that it has taken two decades. That man still lives in Ponferrada. He has continued to cast doubts on the sentence—even though it wasn&#39;t just one court but two that ruled in favor of Nevenka. This is something that I&#39;ve talked about at length with her. The whole harassment process was very painful. But what hurt her the most was feeling as alone as she was. I think that has now changed somehow.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;The town&#39;s public apology coincided with another case that has shocked Spain—and, arguably, the world—that of Jenni Hermoso, the Spanish soccer player. What was your initial reaction to the unwanted kiss?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I was watching the game surrounded by children, including my own. The first thing I told myself was, This cannot be—it just cannot be. And I think that is very symptomatic. Maybe a few years ago, we wouldn&#39;t have given it so much importance. But, in a matter of hours, the majority of Spain had the same reaction.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;What happened afterward further exposed Rubiales&#39;s character: he sought to coerce Jenni; tried to get her to speak publicly and deliver a message that wasn&#39;t true; and then the Royal Spanish Football Federation issued a statement that was attributed to Jenni without her approval.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;ozu8n9&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;d6xpa&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;Those statements are particularly relevant because they were issued by the federation, as you say, which suggests that the problem didn&#39;t rest only in Rubiales as an individual but in the system that tried to protect him.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;That is key, and it&#39;s a pattern that we&#39;ve seen in other cases. Of course, Jenni&#39;s case is not as serious as that of Nevenka or, of course, that of La Manada, which are the two main references in our country when we talk about harassment. But the one commonality is the halo of protection or connivance or collaboration around these characters.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;This moment has been referred to in Spain as “&lt;em>;Nuestro&lt;/em>; MeToo,” or “Our MeToo.” Has the time finally come? Help us understand why, in 2017, the movement didn&#39;t have as strong an impact in Spain.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Jenni&#39;s case is especially significant for a country like ours, because no one expected that the MeToo movement would spring from football in Spain. I would almost say it&#39;s against nature. And yet that is what makes this moment so magical: female players—and exceptions among the men, including Borja Iglesias—have unleashed a movement that we had only started to tiptoe in. And the fact that a camera exposed Rubiales&#39;s behavior in front of the entire world was important. Because, if someone does that in front of the cameras, what won&#39;t they do when no one is watching or when they don&#39;t feel observed?&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Fear is a very powerful factor in environments where harassment takes place. When we started filming Nevenka&#39;s documentary, in 2019, there were still places in Ponferrada where we weren&#39;t allowed to shoot because people did not want their bar or restaurant to be visible. They told us, “I don&#39;t want to get involved in this mess.” After all those years! What&#39;s more, Netflix commissioned a beautiful mural made by a Spanish illustrator, which is still up on a Ponferrada building, and someone tried to deface it one night. There is also a monument in town dedicated to Nevenka that was recently splattered with acid. So I understand why women are afraid to come out with their stories.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;There has been a debate in Spain around the case against Plácido Domingo, because some of the victims asked that their names be withheld. [&lt;em>;After claims surfaced in 2019 that Domingo had sexually harassed multiple women, he apologized, but he then walked back his apology, denying any wrongdoing&lt;/em>;.] What&#39;s interesting is that, when women give their names, it is said that all they are after is notoriety. And, if they do not give their names, it is said that they are hiding themselves. We are talking about powerful people—the power structures around them are very difficult to tear down for a single individual.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;It&#39;s also worth noting how this debate is playing out in the political arena. We have seen extremes on both sides: Vox, Spain&#39;s far-right party, has denied the existence of gender violence, while the “Solo Sí Es Sí,” or “Only Yes Means Yes,” law, a left-wing initiative, has been the subject of controversy. [&lt;em>;The law says that sex without consent is equivalent to rape and abolishes the distinction between abuse and assault, which has resulted in lower minimum sentences for hundreds of people&lt;/em>;.]&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Social changes must be accompanied by adequate policies. Twenty years ago, there were no gender-equality laws, and now they exist in Spain. Another iconic case is that of Ana Orantes, a woman who went on television and confessed that her ex-husband had been beating her for decades. Within days of her public appearance, the husband set fire to his wife and killed her. It is a case that shocked the Spanish public and led to the passage of a law on gender violence in 2004.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;We have turned into a deeply polarized country, where everything can become a subject of controversy. As we&#39;ve discussed, we now have a far-right party, which questions and denies the existence of gender violence. Also, there is an ongoing debate around the “Only Yes Means Yes” law, which has done some good. For example, it aims to address digital harassment, which is something that many women are savagely subjected to on social media. But it has also resulted in the reduction of criminal sentences and has had a negative impact in that regard.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;And how has the debate around abuse and gender equality evolved within the media?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Many women have entered the industry in recent decades, which means that we have a voice, we count, and we can exert influence—it helps for women to be in a position of power. In the company where I work, Newtral, most of the people in leadership are women, because of their talent. If there were only men, it wouldn&#39;t be the same—just as if there were only women.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Of course, the glass ceiling exists. It is a persistent problem. Many of us in television have been in the situation where you&#39;re in the middle of a live show and someone walks by and touches our butt. Or we might be in the middle of a live coverage, surrounded by people who are touching us, without our consent, but we can&#39;t do anything because we are on live television.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The new generations don&#39;t accept that. Just a few days ago, it happened to a young reporter in Spain, and there&#39;s been a wave of support for her. In the past, she might have said, “Well, it&#39;s just part of my job.” No, it&#39;s not part of your job. It is important that you question these situations and know that you are not alone—we are going to support you. ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;koni9&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 25 Sep 2023 19:06:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[The Weather App for the Well Connected (And Denny’s!)]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/10/02/the-weather-app-for-the-well-connected-and-dennys]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-25T10:00:00.000Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650e0610f2302a11d71e94b3/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/231002_r43108illuweb-site.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;article >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attribute-verso-pattern=&quot;article-body&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;ArticlePageChunks&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;On a recent Thursday, a hurricane was tracking toward the general vicinity of Boston. How dire was it? Headlines varied from “Hurricane Lee to Peak in the Boston Area Around 6 &lt;em >;AM&lt;/em>; Saturday” (the &lt;em>;Globe&lt;/em>;) to “Worst of Hurricane Lee to Miss Boston” (the &lt;em>;Herald&lt;/em>;). What&#39;s with all the confusion?&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“This entire system”—the information gathered from ocean buoys, ground-based radar, weather stations, aircraft, satellites, and weather balloons—“has been predominantly done by government agencies,” Rei Goffer, a founder of the Boston-based weather-intelligence company Tomorrow.io, said, a few hours before the duelling newspaper reports. Everyone, it seems, swears by a weather app (one year&#39;s AccuWeather craze is the next&#39;s Dark Sky mania), but they all rely on the same limited info. “The Weather Company? Your iPhone? These are solely repackaging governmental data,” Goffer said. “They don&#39;t really contribute anything to the effort.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Earlier this year, in the spirit of contribution, Tomorrow sent two test weather-radar satellites into orbit on SpaceX Falcon 9s. The company is now planning to send a combination of radar and microwave sounders—twenty-eight in all—into space, to monitor most of the Earth every hour, instead of once every three days, which is the current rate for the radar aboard &lt;em >;NASA&lt;/em>;&#39;s billion-dollar Global Precipitation Measurement Core Observatory. Goffer pointed out that much of the globe isn&#39;t covered at all by ground-based weather radar. “Those types of forecasts are almost as good as a toss of the coins!” he said. Tomorrow claims that its forecasts are thirty-eight per cent better than everyone else&#39;s, thanks to an artificial intelligence that the company has nicknamed Gale.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Tomorrow already offers boutique weather services to clients including JetBlue, Delta, Uber, the NFL, Porsche, Ford, Tesla, Live Nation, Denny&#39;s, and the city of Hoboken. The company consults on questions like whether to promote ice cream or hot chocolate on a drive-through menu, when to expect employees to call in sick because the weather is too bad (or too good), and whether a singer can go onstage without getting struck by lightning. The US Open uses Tomorrow to decide whether to keep its stadium roofs open. The company charges business customers as much as seven figures.

He declined to make his own predictions. “As far as safety and lifesaving weather alerts, the source is the government,” he said. The National Weather Service had just issued a warning of “significant threat to life or property” and a directive to “take action within the next hour.” Tomorrow&#39;s app said that it was seventy-four degrees and sunny.&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot;

At the company&#39;s office in Bourne, outside Boston, no one seemed concerned. “Hurricane Lee? No, not for us,” James Carswell, who helped design the technology for Tomorrow&#39;s radar satellites, said.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Carswell, who is fifty-five, wore a light-blue polo shirt and braided bracelets. In his office, a whiteboard filled with enigmatic scribbles bore a sign that read “Caution Do Not Erase.” He&#39;s the type of weather guy who flies in hurricane-chasing aircraft. “I probably have over one thousand hours in the actual storms,” Carswell said, adding, “These larger hurricanes, you need information over the entire globe, and technology hasn&#39;t been there. The cost of going to space was just too expensive.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Another issue that Tomorrow is trying to fix? The weather is often unintelligible. “A forecast will say, &#39;Twenty-per-cent chance of rain, high winds across the state of New York,&#39; ” Dan Slagen, Tomorrow&#39;s chief marketing officer, said. “Weather intelligence will say, &#39;Stop the trains at mile marker twenty-seven, Thursday, at one o&#39;clock.&#39; ” He said that a rep from one company told him, “I&#39;d rather have one wrong forecast than multiple forecasts.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Slagen and Carswell strolled down the hall and into a laboratory. “This was our original prototype of our Pathfinder radar system that&#39;s up in space right now,” Carswell said, pointing to what looked like an R2-D2 autopsy. He said that the satellites for the next launch were the size of dorm-room fridges.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Outside, the weather was gloomy but not apocalyptic. (The storm did, ultimately, stay out in the Atlantic, before making landfall in Nova Scotia.) Was it hubris to think that we mortals could predict the future? “Weather is very chaotic,” Carswell said. “We always say, &#39;Wait an hour in New England and it&#39;s going to be different.&#39; ” ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;deu1i6&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;to8zei&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 25 Sep 2023 19:06:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Barry Blitt’s “The Race for Office”]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cover-story/cover-story-2023-10-02]]><description>&lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-25T10:00:00.000Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650ddfd4c48d9b127294d809/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/cover-story-promo-blitt_biden.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;article >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attribute-verso-pattern=&quot;article-body&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;ArticlePageChunks&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p>;Is the US—long thought to be the land of new beginnings—in danger of becoming a sclerotic gerontocracy? “In a declining society, the images of an aging leadership can come to embody a general sense of withering and decay,” David Remnick writes in the Comment for the October 2, 2023, issue. “A civic nightmare becomes the caricaturist&#39;s dream.” For the issue&#39;s cover, the cartoonist Barry Blitt portrays the irony and absurdity of the advanced-age politicians currently vying for our top offices. Blitt, who, at sixty-five, is a qualified member of the past-their-prime cohort, also drew from his own experience. As a fellow old duffer (I&#39;m nearly three years older than he is), I called him for a kvetch fest and was rewarded with talk of borrowed walkers, missing teeth, lost hair, and some new belly buttons.&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;So, what&#39;s up, as the kids say? Is it the knee today or is it the digestion?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Right. I&#39;m sure the readers would love to know what&#39;s ailing me. The knees are both fine, and the digestion is top-notch, thanks for asking. But I think you&#39;ll be thrilled to hear that I recently had five hernias taken care of in one day. When I went in, they thought it was going to be two or three, but afterward the doc couldn&#39;t wait to tell me he found five of them. As I regained consciousness, he was excitedly showing me a diagram of what he&#39;d done.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;[&lt;em>;Laughs&lt;/em>;.] That was a good day for hernias.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Well, yes, a good day for a hernia doctor to add to his war stories. It&#39;s not like it used to be, where they&#39;d have to cut you wide open. They do it laparoscopically—I think they go in through your belly button. In any case, now I&#39;ve got some new, extra belly buttons. [&lt;em>;Laughs&lt;/em>;.] Also, it was supposed to be an outpatient procedure, but they kept me overnight—I was a bit of a mess afterward. (Is this really going to be part of the interview? I&#39;d rather talk about bitcoin.) But anyway, this was all a couple of months ago, I&#39;m feeling much better now.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;I&#39;m so glad I asked. You wouldn&#39;t have told me otherwise.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I was honestly telling everybody, because it seemed like some kind of record. But then I met someone a couple of weeks ago, a woman at a dinner party, who wasn&#39;t impressed at all. She told me she&#39;d once had seven done in one day! And she wasn&#39;t even old, though it likely happened to her because she had delivered three children.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;So not the cause for yours, obviously. What did you do to deserve so many hernias? Were you lifting art work?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;No, not art work, but for a while, I was playing gigs in New York City and carrying my electric piano and an amp around. Like an idiot, I used to schlep them on and off of Metro-North trains and into taxis, because I was nervous about driving into town. So I&#39;m sure that&#39;s where I got a few of them.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;I knew it had to be for the sake of art.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;This wasn&#39;t art, but, yes, it was for the sake of fun.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;So other than hernias . 。 .&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Right, what else? I&#39;ve got a lot less hair than I had at the beginning of the pandemic. If you&#39;re going to lose your hair, you want to do it gradually over time, so people see you every day and they get to take it in stride.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;[&lt;em>;Laughs&lt;/em>;.] But how would anyone know, since you&#39;re always wearing a hat?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Beware of the times you can&#39;t wear a hat—that&#39;s my motto. But everything else is sort of all right. I mean, I&#39;m missing some teeth, too. [&lt;em>;Laughs&lt;/em>;.] I am missing five teeth. Or maybe it&#39;s six. I&#39;ll do a count after we talk. Only one is conspicuous, in the front. I&#39;ve got to do something about that one.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;Why are you losing so many teeth? You just wake up and they fall to the floor?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;No, no. I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve had any root canals, but root canals don&#39;t last forever. Sometimes the shell of the root cracks and gets infected, and they have to pull the tooth. So I&#39;ve had a bunch of those. I have “Montreal teeth.” That&#39;s what they call it.
