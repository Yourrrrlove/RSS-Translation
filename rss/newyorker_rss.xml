Harris, Jr.) 的“&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-front-row/chameleon-street-an-overlooked-masterwork” -thats-also-a-cautionary-tale-about-hollywood&quot;>;变色龙街&lt;/a>;，”Zeinabu irene Davis 的“&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-front-row /what-to-stream-urgently-compensation-a-modern-classic-rescued&quot;>;补偿&lt;/a>;”和埃里克·门德尔松的“朱迪·柏林”——要么未发行，要么严重未发行。此外，这十年来许多最好的国际电影也仍未发行。令人震惊的是，菲利普·科林的“&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-front-row/what-to-stream-the-last-days-of-immanuel-kant-a-physical- Comedy-of-the-philosophical-life&quot;>;伊曼纽尔·康德的最后日子&lt;/a>;”甚至&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/postscript/jean-luc-godard-was -cinemas-north-star&quot;>;让-吕克·戈达尔&lt;/a>;的《新浪潮》（阿兰·德龙主演！）&lt;em>;仍未&lt;/em>;在这里上映。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;三十年前独立电影发行业务看起来与现在有很大不同。如今，从纽约电影节到商业上映的管道已畅通无阻，流程也很快，但在那时，这更多的是流水账。如今，社交媒体迅速引起轰动，并以光速传播批评热情。那时，网络生活主要是电子邮件——在电影界，这主要意味着影迷能够比以前更快地私下抱怨。基亚罗斯塔米的电影是在那种荒凉的环境中兴起的，考虑到他现在无可争议的声望，很难记住他的职业生涯在阴影中徘徊了多久。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;出生于 1940 年的基亚罗斯塔米从那时起就一直在拍电影。 1970 年拍摄了他的第一部长片，并于 1973 年拍摄了他的第一部电影。作为《电影手册》的读者，我从 1990 年左右就开始了解他的作品。他的第一部突破性电影是 1987 年的剧情片《哪里》是朋友家吗？我还记得读过他 1989 年的纪录片《家庭作业》；他的第一部广受好评的国际杰作是1990年的纪录片《特写》，直到1999年才在这里上映。纽约电影节于1992年放映了他的故事片《生活继续》和《穿过橄榄树》 1994 年。到了 90 年代中期，看过他的一两部电影后，我确信基亚罗斯塔米是最具原创性、概念上最大胆、美学上最精致的电影制作人之一，但令我沮丧的是，他的电影在中国却没有出现。美国市场。 《穿过橄榄树》最初被收购并在美国院线上映，但收购它的公司米拉麦克斯却对其表现不佳。这部电影看起来一定是在艺术影院受欢迎的一个不错的选择：尽管有一些元小说的手法，但它是一部充满渴望和温暖的喜剧爱情片。但米拉麦克斯似乎临阵退缩了。 1995 年 2 月，这部电影在一家不起眼的剧院进行了一场几乎没有广告的预演。它继续使这部电影在一段不合时宜的时间内远离家庭视频市场。作为一家小型（现已解散）的美国发行商，我拜访了基亚罗斯塔米早期电影的销售代理商。发行公司希望发行基亚罗斯塔米的一部电影，但该机构告诉我需要大量预付款，而且公司没有预算，所以就这样了。我讲这个故事是为了表明，1997 年 Zeitgeist 收购了《樱桃之味》时，它的赌注是重大的。这部电影在当年的戛纳电影节上获得了最高奖项——金棕榈奖，发行商也因此获得了大奖。距离该片在纽约电影节美国首映还有不到一周的时间；如此高调的影片无疑对时代精神提出了很高的要求，尤其是由于影片的性质和主题。&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;《樱桃之味》讲述了讲述了一位名叫巴迪先生（Homayoun Ershadi 饰）的中年男子的故事，他在德黑兰及其周边地区开车，接载了一系列乘客，希望他们能够快速接受他提供的一份工作。他打算当晚躺在附近乡村的一条偏僻的沟渠里，服用过量的安眠药，并想雇人早上过来检查一下。如果他还活着，他们可以帮助他脱离困境；如果没有，他们可以用铲子泥土覆盖他的尸体。巴迪从未透露过他的动机，但他显然是在安排自己的自杀，如果自杀不成功的话，也不会被发现，因此他需要陌生人的服务。他愿意出高价，提供的金额相当于体力劳动者六个月的收入。&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>; &lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;几乎所有影片的动作都发生在巴迪的车内或附近，并且大部分动作都是对话——扩展的讨论场景，在车里，在城外的丘陵乡村地区巴迪试图连续说服三名乘客完成这项工作。一名是伊朗陆军的年轻应征入伍者；一个是神学院的学生；第三位是一位在自然历史博物馆担任动物标本剥制师的老人。当巴迪为一份他拒绝预先描述的工作提供大笔资金时，他的态度有些谨慎和控制欲，但又暗暗绝望。他的说服之网是精心编织的——他编织的一部分是他对对话者的生活暗示的好奇心，他引出他们的需要的故事。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;换句话说，巴迪是一名记者，并且他遇到的人都有自己的麻烦：这名士兵是库尔德人，他在自己的乡村家乡感受到了两伊战争的影响；这位修士是一名阿富汗人，他选择离开饱受战争蹂躏的国家；标本剥制师有一个生病的孩子需要昂贵的治疗。当然，基亚罗斯塔米是一位准纪录片导演，不仅体现在他对这个好奇故事的构建，也体现在他的拍摄中，从他对发生行动的贫瘠、沙质和险恶的农村地区的看法开始。 《樱桃的味道》是他版本的《我对她了解的两三件事》的一部分，这是一个关于工业化和现代化变革的故事，它带来了新形式的孤立、挫败和绝望。基亚罗斯塔米的拍摄具有纪录片般的专注力——对风景和面孔、对情境和想法——这与电视剧渐进的、调查性的、观察性的姿态相匹配。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;然而，在其表面之下却潜藏着彻底的狂野和彻底的讽刺。首先，自杀不仅是禁忌，而且违反了伊斯兰教法（神学院生自己也这么说），因此，《樱桃之味》不仅被禁止在伊朗放映，而且几乎被禁止出口（因此来自戛纳）。因此，这是一个明显反抗的故事，是对另一个包含公民和宗教权威的权威的诉求。事实上，这是一部道德和身体自主权的电影，是关于存在或不存在的终极自由的电影——一种将自杀作为自由的愿景，接续了安德烈·马尔罗和存在主义者的中断。与此同时，这种自由的愿景涉及的不是控制，而是放弃控制，屈服于存在的硬币翻转，屈服于过量服用是否有效的随机问题。带着讽刺性的不确定性和果断的优柔寡断的暗流，《樱桃的味道》演变成一部奇怪的电影：这是一部自杀喜剧，类似于杰里·刘易斯导演的最后一部电影，“&lt;a href=&quot;https:// www.newyorker.com/goings-on-about-town/movies/cracking-up&quot;>;崩溃&lt;/a>;。”其极其恐怖的幽默的一个例子是巴迪在一条毗邻陡峭沙崖的狭窄道路上行驶时的一瞬间的分心：正当他准备不小心翻倒时，他的轮胎卡在了沙子里。 （该序列在主题上与&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5pBEuw-zfw&quot;>;刘易斯电影中的一个&lt;/a>;押韵。）&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;甚至标题事实证明很讽刺。它暗示着基本的感官愉悦、赋予生命意义的记忆宝库，并以一种引力将人拉回到日常活动中。然而，巴迪唤起的最美好的回忆绝非一碗樱桃：他记得自己的兵役经历，他特别将这项活动描述为需要做好杀人准备的活动。就此而言，《樱桃之味》中还有另一个疯狂的悖论——它的结局并没有剧透。我不会说巴迪会怎样，但无论如何，这都不是结局；相反，基亚罗斯塔米跳出了动作框架，以一些摄制组的低保真视频作为结束，视频中导演呼唤一队行进的士兵回到原来的位置进行另一次拍摄。他以看似无限倒退的方式结束，模拟了官方批准和授权、国家批准和宗教祝福的处理死亡的权力的现实。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;在 1998 年发布时， 《樱桃之味》的院线票房只有三十万美元。但它被国家影评人协会评为年度最佳外语片，并在该类别中获得亚军 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.imdb.com/event/ev0000484/1998/ 1/&quot;>;纽约影评人协会&lt;/a>;，排名第四（仅领先于“&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/scorseses-achievement-with-goodfellas” &quot;>;好家伙&lt;/a>;”）&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.imdb.com/event/ev0002738/1999/1?ref_=ttawd_ev_7&quot;>;&lt;em>;乡村之声&lt;/em>;民意调查&lt; /a>; 十年来最好的电影。简而言之，从那时起，直到他的职业生涯结束——他于 2016 年去世——我们再也无法否认基亚罗斯塔米了。 《Close-Up》于 1999 年迟来发行；他1999年的电影《风将载着我们》于次年立即在这里上映。从那时起，他的作品一直是美国艺术界的中流砥柱，也是美国评论家和电影制片人的主要参考。时代精神也许并没有发布它，但该公司创造了历史。 ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot;

aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt; /div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;多年来，特朗普对许多供应商采取了强硬态度，从窗帘制造商到油漆公司再到木匠，当然知道他的话的价值。但他来到法庭不仅仅是为了提醒大家他是多么狡猾。他的主要目标是批评检察官和法官，并以政治动机为由驳回针对他的案件——自五周前审判开始以来，他一直在向记者发表的声明和社交媒体上的帖子中提出这一说法。周一，他借此机会在证人席上重申了自己的论点。当被问及他是否不同意司法部长利蒂西亚·詹姆斯的&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/breaking-down-new-yorks-long-awaited-fraud-lawsuit-against-donald -特朗普&quot;>;声称资产估值被高估&lt;/a>;，特朗普称詹姆斯为“政治黑客”，她利用此案来推进自己的政治生涯，并补充道，“这是一场政治迫害。”然后他把恶毒的矛头转向了恩戈隆法官，说道：“他称我为骗子，他对我一无所知。 。 。 。欺诈是在法庭上，而不是在我身上。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;恩戈隆法官似乎陷入了两难境地：一方面想要阻止特朗普发表言论，另一方面又不想让他保持沉默，以免让他的律师有上诉的理由。他一再要求特朗普回答问题，并一度抱怨道：“这不是一场政治集会。这里是法庭。”特朗普无视这些警告，他的律师、佛罗里达州前副检察长克里斯·凯斯(Chris Kise)为他提供了支持，这些论点似乎来自竞选手册，而不是任何法律手册。基塞告诉恩戈隆，作为美国前总统，特朗普应该有“一点自由”，可以说任何他想说的话。他还提到了《泰晤士报》的一项民意调查，显示特朗普在战场州领先乔·拜登，并暗示他很可能连任。这与案件的核心问题无关。黄濑和他的委托人一样，似乎是在向公众而不是法官讲话。&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height :auto&quot;

In Washington, sympathy with Israel was near-ubiquitous, and President Joe Biden&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/letter-from-bidens-washington/the-week-when-biden-hugged-bibi&quot;>;vigorous support&lt;/a>; for the Israeli government had few public dissenters within the national-security state. This had the effect of drawing extra attention to Paul, who said he was resigning both because he disagreed with what the US had already done to back Israel and because he feared what would likely come next. “I believe to the core of my soul,” Paul wrote, “that the response Israel is taking, and with it the American support for both that response, and for the status quo of the occupation will only lead to more and deeper suffering for both the Israeli and Palestinian people—and is not in the long-term American interest.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The document spread quickly, and by the start of Israel&#39;s ground invasion of Gaza Paul was being interviewed on CNN, the BBC, PBS, and elsewhere, as the emblem of internal dissent. Shaven-headed and thick-necked, with an unexpected British accent, he spoke with the same clipped, rapid precision with which military spokesmen announce casualty reports. If you set aside what he was saying, he seemed, in appearance and manner, something like the opposite of a peacenik.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;He was also a former high-school classmate of mine. I remembered Paul as an intense, outdoorsy teen-ager who had moved from England to New York at the beginning of eighth grade, remained slightly aloof, and then returned to the United Kingdom for college. We had since lost touch, but I still kept track of him—he had gone to Iraq to work with George W. Bush&#39;s Coalition Provisional Authority, then spent the better part of a year in Ramallah, in the West Bank, working for a US-led project to build up the Palestinian Authority&#39;s security forces. Afterward, he spent a decade at the State Department working for the Bureau of Political-Military Affairs, also known as PM, which manages arms transfers to allies and partners, some of which have extensive histories of human-rights violations. Once, out with friends in New York, I had run into Paul as he was showing three Iraqi security officials a night out in the city. If he occupied a place in my imagination, it was an anachronistic one, as a sincere foot soldier of the American empire.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The news of his resignation left me with a slightly dissonant feeling: If all of official Washington was behind Biden&#39;s Israel policy, why was &lt;em>;this&lt;/em>; the guy who wasn&#39;t? In Paul&#39;s resignation letter, he had alluded to the ethical complexities of arms-transfer work at the State Department: “In my 11 years I have made more moral compromises than I can recall, each heavily.” I reached out and, a few hours later, received a message from him on Signal: “Funny old world, isn&#39;t it?” Two weeks ago, I went down to Washington to meet him, and to try to gauge whether the rest of us, as Americans, should feel as implicated by the war as he did.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;When I met Paul, at an outdoor café in Friendship Heights, he didn&#39;t seem much cut loose from his former life. He was wearing a suit, and his demeanor was warm but not exactly relaxed. Texts and phone calls came from think tanks and university departments hoping to schedule events. He was still in a fight over bombs that were already being dropped. The day before, Paul said, he&#39;d been to Capitol Hill for meetings and had stumbled upon a peace protest in a member&#39;s office. Then he&#39;d headed over to his old haunt at the State Department, where pro-Palestine activists were protesting. “It was going on literally outside my old window,” he said. “So I knew that all my former colleagues were listening.” At one point, the demonstrators chanted, “Quit! Your! Jobs!”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;There was a generational arc to Paul&#39;s experience. Most of our high-school classmates graduated from college in 2000. Paul earned a master&#39;s degree at Georgetown, in national-security studies, and managed to get a job, via the Bush White House, with the Coalition Provisional Authority in Baghdad. “At the time, I would have said I was an adult, but looking back I was just an excited kid,” he said. Paul arrived in March, 2004, two weeks before the start of the First Battle of Fallujah. His assignment was to serve as a civilian adviser to the Iraqi Interior Ministry as it trained security forces. For a time, he flew twice a week from Baghdad to Fallujah to encourage the Marines, the Iraqi police, and the tribes to work together. “How did that go?” I asked. Paul said, “I mean, my immediate counterpart in the Iraqi Ministry of the Interior was assassinated.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The US had helped create a unit called the Iraqi police commandos, which eventually became the Iraqi Special Police, with the intent of taking over some of the missions of US Special Forces as they transitioned out. “It very quickly was taken over by former regime Baathists, who the US was very closely allied with and was embedding Special Forces advisers with, but who were committing torture, and all sorts of human-rights abuses, and extrajudicial killings,” Paul said. “But the American view was it was all right because these were our guys.” Seeing how that played out, he went on, “was something that made me very uneasy.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Elsewhere in the region, efforts to build a Palestinian state under the principles of the Oslo Accords were under way. Paul, who had written his master&#39;s thesis on Israeli counterterrorism, spent a year in Ramallah, working on an initiative to bolster Palestinian security forces based on the premise that “if we give Israel more security, then they will make concessions for peace.” The Israeli argument, Paul went on, was that what was holding the Palestinians back was a lack of prosperity, “and if we can open some trade routes then things would flourish.” But, in Ramallah, Paul came to doubt that this was the case. “Even with the privileges of being a Westerner there, with a government pass, able to go through the checkpoints, when you see the humiliations that Palestinians go through every day, you see how impossible it is.” There might be two towns right next to each other, tied by family, but there was no direct road to get from one to the other “because the road is now for settlers only.” Water was diverted; Palestinians with dry farms could look up at hilltops and see developments with swimming pools. Members of the Israel Defense Forces sometimes staged security raids in Palestinian communities. “The Israeli military took us on a tour of a neighborhood in Jenin, and they said, &#39;It&#39;s very dangerous, every time we come here, they shoot at us,&#39; ” Paul recalled. “&lt;em>;Well, have you tried not going?&lt;/em>;”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Something about the way Paul said this—the sarcasm, as if it were all self-evident—reminded me of his adolescent self. He seemed to pull back, too. He had a tight line to walk—to sound not like he was making an a-priori ideological case for peace, as an activist might, but like his skepticism of supplying the Israeli military reflected the hard-won experience of the national-security state. Sometimes, when he spoke about Israel, I detected a political self-consciousness in the phrasing. “The Israeli story is an absolutely amazing one,” he said at one point, sounding a bit like an ambassador at a ribbon-cutting, “how it has transformed itself technologically and economically in seventy-five years.” At another point, he paused while mentioning the “horrors” of the Hamas attack, looked at my recorder, and said, “which of course I condemn.” He added, “One shouldn&#39;t have to say that, but one does.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;The year in Ramallah had left him with the impression that security and prosperity for peace was an impossible proposition, because you could not have any of those things amid an occupation. “You cannot bomb the resistance out of the Palestinian people,” Paul said. “You can contain them, as Israel has done for a long time. But, if ultimately that is the path you take, it will not lead to security for the Israeli people.” Because, he went on, “if you bomb them continuously, and traumatize them continuously, and restrict them from leaving the land, and refuse them medical care, and control their electricity and water, they will hate you. In addition to my concern for Palestinian lives, my concern was and remains that Israel is not doing itself any favors here. That it is extending the trauma of the conflict to another generation of its own people.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The question of exactly how much the United States is implicated in the crimes or excesses of its allies is present in much of foreign policy, but perhaps nowhere is it as tangible as within the three-hundred-and-fifty-person Political-Military Bureau of the State Department. Many of its officials are affiliated with the military. “This is not an office that attracts a lot of hippies,” a former State Department official told me. In 2012, Paul joined PM as its director of congressional and public affairs, a position he held until his resignation, which meant that his job was to help manage relations with Capitol Hill and public messaging about decisions to send deadly weapons systems to sometimes questionable regimes. He was also involved in the approval process for major weapons sales. The laws and policies governing such arms deals require scrutiny of the human-rights records of the governments, militaries, and units receiving weapons, meaning that Paul was often immersed in debates over the humanitarian consequences of sending so many bombs, or so many aircraft, to a particular ally or partner. It was a good place to see exactly what alliance required.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Paul joined PM, he told me, because he thought the United States was, relative to its competitors, a positive force in the world, and that arms transfers could be a way to save civilian lives and protect democracies. (Israel&#39;s Iron Dome anti-missile system, Paul said, is an example of the good version of such military aid, since it is used to protect the lives of Israeli civilians.) He also came to believe that he could exercise some moral influence over the use of such weaponry. The longest debate of Paul&#39;s tenure at PM was over the decision (made first by the Obama Administration, and extended under President Trump) to arm Saudi Arabia during its campaign against pro-Iranian Houthi militias in Yemen. For nearly a decade, the State Department&#39;s attention to the consequences of this decision were, Paul said, “microscopic.” Charts would be made estimating the number of civilian casualties each month and then there would be lengthy debates—were the Saudis killing more innocent Yemenis, or fewer? The US government sent a senior adviser, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2018/08/yemen-saudi-airstrike-school-bus/567799/&quot;>;Larry Lewis&lt;/a>;, out into the field to help the Saudis with their targeting and with the rules of engagement. “There was a long debate about how far into Saudi and Saudi-coalition military processes can we get without actually implicating ourselves,” Paul told me. He had been part of an internal push to get the US to further restrain the Saudi military, and felt that these efforts had helped preserve the lives of Yemeni civilians. But, when I asked Paul whether he felt that the US had got the balance of interests and humanitarian aims more or less right in Yemen, he said, “No, we got it very wrong.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;During the two years before Hamas&#39;s act of mass murder, the world of arms transfers had been preoccupied with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/10/24/inside-the-us-effort-to-arm-ukraine&quot;>;weapons for Ukraine&lt;/a>;. One of the most divisive issues at the State Department was whether the US should supply Kyiv with cluster munitions, which, because of the high rate of civilian casualties associated with them, have been banned by a number of US allies. In the end, Paul supported sending them, a decision that the Biden Administration eventually arrived at, too. Paul said, “Having made all these arms transfers and having made the ultimate decision that &#39;Hey, these aren&#39;t always bad,&#39; one of the differences I have with the left is that the perfect should not be the enemy of the good.”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;he0i&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;h12y0n&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Paul was overseas on personal leave in the immediate aftermath of October 7th, but it was obvious to him that the US would be transferring arms to Israel after the attack. Many of those transfers, Paul knew, would happen almost instantly. For decades, the United States has maintained a vast weapons stockpile in Israel, which the IDF can draw from if Washington authorizes it. (In the first days after Hamas&#39;s attack, that authorization process was already under way.)&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Paul noticed some aspects of the diplomatic situation that should have raised alarms back in PM, among them the suggestion by Israeli leaders that Palestinian civilians were implicated in the Hamas attacks. On October 13th, Israel&#39;s President, Isaac Herzog, said, “It&#39;s an entire nation out there that is responsible. It&#39;s not true—this rhetoric about civilians not aware, not involved—it&#39;s absolutely not true.” Israel is a technologically advanced country with a well-resourced military; it has, as Paul put it, “a lot of bombs.” But the difference made by American support, he went on, was the difference between a vast but limited lethal capacity and a functionally unlimited one. “There would come a point without American support where Israel would have to say, &#39;Well, we need to be more selective.&#39; If they are resource-unlimited, then they might say, &#39;Well, we might miss the Hamas guy here, and there might be twenty dead civilians. But it&#39;s worth a shot anyway, in case he&#39;s there, because there are enough bombs to do it.&#39; ”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Before he even got back to Washington, Paul began to draft his letter of resignation. But he also thought there was a chance that, beneath Biden&#39;s promises of military aid, some bureaucratic checks—against human-rights violations and against the killing of civilians—were under way. “A very simple thing that would have made a difference for me is, you know, knowing that there are units in the Israeli security forces that are of concern because of their track record of extrajudicial killings, seeing that some effort was being made not to give them more weapons,” Paul said. “That was not the case. In fact, where there had been debate, there was now no longer debate. It was, &#39;Let&#39;s give them weapons. It doesn&#39;t matter.&#39; ” Both he and the State Department&#39;s Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor raised concerns about the lack of review of these arms transfers to certain Israeli units, Paul said. What they wanted, he went on, was to see “some space for, &#39;OK, we still have these values. We still have these concerns, they haven&#39;t gone away.&#39; But there was none of that. It was, &#39;Open doors. Go.&#39; ”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Paul had spent the four years of the Trump Administration with a letter of resignation pre-written and tucked inside his desk, prepared for the worst. He never saw enough reason to submit it. When Biden was elected, he had been relieved: Biden&#39;s foreign-policy advisers emphasized human rights, and his campaign proposals included some initiatives, among them further restrictions on the overseas transfers of guns, that Paul believed in. Many of Biden&#39;s senior aides, from the national-security adviser &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/10/16/trial-by-combat&quot;>;Jake Sullivan&lt;/a>; on down, were only a bit older than us, and their formative experiences were also of the post-9/11 war on terror and its excesses and errors. But Paul thought that he and they had taken slightly different lessons from watching the same bad wars. “It&#39;s interesting,” he said. “There&#39;s not a lot of people on the civilian side of government in this Administration who were in Iraq and Afghanistan, because it&#39;s a Democratic Administration and those were Bush wars.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The war in Israel and Gaza is now, in part, Biden&#39;s. A week after Paul and I had met in Washington, I wrote back to him to see what he made of it. Israel&#39;s promised ground invasion of Gaza had not yet begun in full, but the devastation was immeasurable, and, in a week when the grimmest news was an Israeli air strike on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-weekend-essay/the-view-from-my-window-in-gaza&quot;>;the Jabalia refugee camp&lt;/a>;, many Palestinian civilians had already been killed. When he wrote back, he sounded both attuned to the bleakness of the situation in Israel and Gaza, and frustrated at how little the US seemed to be doing to alleviate it. “We wasted thirty years in which we could have remade the world,” Paul wrote. “Where once we were guided by hope we let ourselves be overtaken by fear. I think that&#39;s the legacy of the Great War on Terror—a nation whose greatest fear is not terrorism, per se, but rather that it may succumb to a destiny it did not choose.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Americans are fond of talking about the Israel-Palestine conflict as if it were stuck in a permanent historical loop, but maybe the US is stuck in a twentieth-century loop, too. “I feel increasingly like we are making the same mistakes,” Paul said. ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;ewazgp&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot;

My children are playing in the house where we have taken refuge, in the Jabalia refugee camp. “I&#39;m getting hungry,” my wife, Maram, whispers to me. “Let&#39;s eat some snacks.” We sneak into the next room and sit on the stairs, where our children are less likely to see us. We miss these private moments, when we could spend time together and joke.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Outside, a red light flashes in the dark sky, like lightning; it is followed not by rain but by rubble that pounds the roofs of houses around us. Maram stops eating. When I stand to peer outside, the air pressure pushes me back.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I walk over to my father, who is anxiously holding up a radio to his ear. “Al Jazeera says that they have lost connection with their correspondents in Gaza,” he says. “There is no signal.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I take my phone out of my pocket. For the first time since the escalation, three weeks ago, there is no Internet, and neither of my &lt;em >;SIM&lt;/em>; cards has any service. My older sister, Aya, who has five children, asks us to warn her when we see bombs fall, so she can cover her ears before the blast reaches us. “My ears are aching,” she says.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I remember that my iPhone has an Emergency SOS feature for when there is no signal. But, when I pull it up, it tells me, “You&#39;re in a region where the satellite connection demo is not supported.” I find another option called crash detection—“If you&#39;re in a car crash, iPhone can automatically call emergency services.” I think that Apple should create a feature called bomb detection—but the people who could help us do not live in Gaza.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;More bombs are falling. My nephews and nieces try to warn their Aunt Aya before the house shakes. It is a long night.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The next morning, I ask my mother, who&#39;s sitting on the mattress where she slept, where my father is. She tells me that he has biked home to Beit Lahia, in northern Gaza, to collect some olive oil, olives, and sugar for us. I have made the same journey before. After I visited on October 12th, to fetch some bread, I wrote for this magazine about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-weekend-essay/the-view-from-my-window-in-gaza&quot;>;my fear that our ceiling would fall in&lt;/a>; during an air strike.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;My mother does not like it when we visit home. In one of her dreams, our house was destroyed, and she was collecting rubble. But my father couldn&#39;t not go back, because he had to feed his birds and rabbits.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;“I was going to ask him to fetch the charger for my electric razor,” I say. The battery died while I was shaving my son&#39;s hair. I try to text my father, but then I remember that there is no signal or Internet.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I have my morning tea. My mother reads from the Holy Quran. My two sisters comb their children&#39;s hair. Maram fills water bottles in the kitchen. I try to keep everyone quiet, so as not to wake those who are still sleeping.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;At about 8:30 &lt;em >;AM&lt;/em>;, my younger brother, Hamza, who is staying with his wife&#39;s family in the area, steps inside. His eyes, behind his glasses, look concerned. “Where is Father?” he asks.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“He&#39;s just returned on his bike to our home,” I tell him.&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;“I went an hour ago,” Hamza tells us. With his hands, he tells us that the house is gone.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;From a photo that Hamza has taken, I can see part of the first floor, where my parents lived. There is nothing to indicate that the house had four floors.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I go to my mother and siblings. In the quietest voice I can manage, I tell them about the destruction of our house. Somehow, my mother is calm. “Thank God that none of us got hurt,” she says.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;My brother-in-law Ahmad suggests that we set out on our bikes to find my father. After only three hundred metres, we see him, his head tilted downward while he pedals.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;My father tells me later that debris covered every inch of the street that led to our house. He did not feed his fifteen ducks, thirty hens, five rabbits, and six pigeons. “Maybe some are alive and stuck under the rubble,” he says. But, after he saw the bombed house and heard the frightening whirring of drones, he headed back to the camp.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;When we get “home,” we all sit on the floor. It&#39;s not until later that I start to realize: I lost not only my house and its rooms but also my new clothes and shoes and watches. My books, too.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I remember how slowly I built my personal library, and how long it took for friends to mail books to Gaza. When I came back from the US in February, 2021, I stuffed a hundred and twenty books into my family&#39;s suitcases; I had to discard some of my shoes and clothes to make space. When I came back in May, 2023, I carried an extra suitcase for about seventy books. Some were signed by friends—&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/01/31/brown-furniture&quot;>;Katha Pollitt&lt;/a>;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/contributors/stephen-greenblatt&quot;>;Stephen Greenblatt&lt;/a>;, Richard Hoffman, Ammiel Alcalay, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/09/11/the-suicide-museum-ariel-dorfman-book-review&quot;>;Jonathan Dee&lt;/a>;. The airport officer thought that my passport was expired because he read it backward, from left to right. On the journey from Cairo, I sprained my shoulder while carrying my heavy suitcases.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Less than two months ago, I was in Philadelphia for a literary festival, and was planning to visit San Francisco. But I had a feeling that the situation in Gaza was precarious, and I decided to shorten my trip. Before I flew home, I asked my friend Hasan to drive down from Syracuse, so that he could give me thirty-five books that I had left with him. They included the five heavy volumes of “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Greenwood-Encyclopedia-American-Poetry-volumes/dp/031332381X&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Greenwood-Encyclopedia-American-Poetry-volumes/dp/031332381X&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Greenwood-Encyclopedia-American-Poetry-volumes/dp/031332381X&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;The Greenwood Encyclopedia of American Poets and Poetry&lt;/a>;.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Because it is hard to believe what we have lost, I decide to return to our home in Beit Lahia and see with my eyes what has happened to it. As I approach the wrecked area of my house, I stop in a panic—not only because of the scene but also because of the sounds of drones and jet planes and bombs falling on nearby neighborhoods.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;fby0k&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;I hope to at least find a copy of my own poetry book, maybe near my neighbor&#39;s olive tree, but there is nothing but debris. Nothing but the smell of explosions.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Now I sit in my temporary house in the Jabalia camp, waiting for a ceasefire. I feel like I am in a cage. I&#39;m being killed every day with my people. The only two things I can do are panic and breathe. There is no hope here.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I plan to go back through the wreckage for my books and rescue whatever I can. I will not put them on bookshelves this time. I just want to make sure that the pages are intact. My brother Hamza will do the same thing with his Arabic grammar and literature books, which he has spent ten years collecting. Both of us pray that in the coming days, it will not rain and soak their pages.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;On October 31st, we are at home when three big explosions shake us. The windows break. Rubble and dust fly into the living room. We all rush into the two bedrooms, looking at the ceiling. A bomb has fallen seventy metres away. It wipes out a whole neighborhood.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Later, a spokesperson for the Israel Defense Forces appears on CNN and says that the attack on Jabalia was aimed at a Hamas leader. When the anchor asks him about the civilians that the IDF has killed, the spokesperson says, “This is the tragedy of war.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;The next day, I am typing part of this essay into my phone when I feel another explosion very close by. I rush about two hundred metres to the site, which is not far from a school run by the United Nations. I see wounded women and children bleeding from their faces and chests. A big fire is burning. I find a pharmacy, check my body for injuries, and try to help those around me. We survive, again.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Recently, my wife dreamed that she was collecting frozen meat. In her dream, she was saying, “This is my son&#39;s arm. This is my daughter&#39;s leg.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;If not for the war, I would be playing soccer with my friends twice a week. I would be watching movies with my wife. I would be reading the books on my shelves. I would be taking my kids to the playground, and to the beach. I would be riding my bike with my son, Yazzan, on the beach road. But now there are no books and no shelves and no beach road. ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot;

>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;In 1926, Virginia Woolf wrote an essay about an innocent young art form: the silent cinema. Woolf argued that the movies were too literary. They would have to find their own artistic language, since they were currently imprisoned in a system of dead convention and mechanical semaphore: “A kiss is love. A broken cup is jealousy. A grin is happiness. Death is a hearse.” Once in a while, she had found herself in a darkened cinema with an apprehension of what film might achieve. “Through the thick counterpane of immense dexterity and enormous efficiency one has glimpses of something vital within,” she wrote. “But the kick of life is instantly concealed by more dexterity, further efficiency.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In the same year, the English writer W. Somerset Maugham published “The Casuarina Tree,” a book of six short stories. Maugham was at the height of his success, as a great, and greatly rewarded, writer of immense dexterity and enormous efficiency. As his biographer Selina Hastings writes, “For much of his long life”—he died in 1965, at ninety-one—Maugham was “the most famous writer in the world.” He had the kind of celebrity that now attends actors, musicians, and criminal politicians. Wherever he went, his spoor was tracked by readers and journalists. His slightest pronouncements fattened a thousand provincial newspaper columns. By 1926, he had launched two very successful careers, as a novelist and a playwright (his collected plays would come to fill six volumes). A year later—the year he bought a villa in Cap Ferrat—“The Letter,” one of the stories from “The Casuarina Tree,” was adapted for the theatre. It played in London and on Broadway; two film adaptations appeared, in 1929 and 1940, the latter with Bette Davis.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Maugham&#39;s worldwide renown could probably have existed only when it did, between the twenties and the fifties. Literary prestige was still culturally central. An audience hungry for literary storytelling overlapped with the audience for cinematic storytelling, and English was the lucky lingua franca of these two mass art forms. The British Empire might have been receding, but Maugham, like his friend Winston Churchill, moved through the world as if the sun were hardly setting on its sins. In the twenties and thirties, the writer made well-publicized journeys to India, Burma, the West Indies, Singapore, and Malaysia. A Maugham “tale” was a smoothly machined artifact—psychologically astute, coolly satirical, mildly subversive, and a bit sexy. Malarial British colonies provided excellent conditions for humid, erotic undercurrents. “The Letter,” set in Singapore, and based on an actual criminal trial, concerns Leslie Crosbie, the wife of a well-off British planter, who has been accused of murdering her neighbor Geoffrey Hammond. It seems a straightforward case: rape narrowly averted. Geoffrey had visited her in the evening, when her husband was away. He made sexual advances, and she shot him in self-defense. Leslie&#39;s lawyer assumes that his client will be acquitted. Maugham&#39;s story turns on the sudden discovery of a passionate letter, a lover&#39;s note, in which Leslie appears to beg Geoffrey to visit her that evening. So was the murder a necessary act of self-protection or an avoidable crime of passion? Was Geoffrey there to assault Leslie, or to break off the affair? “The Letter” lunges toward its narrative bait.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;GenericCallout&quot;>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;external-link-embed--inline&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;a aria-label=&quot;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;The Best Books We Read This Week&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.newyorker.com/best-books-2023&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/best-books-2023&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;&lt;span >;&lt;strong>;The Best Books We Read This Week&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/a>;&lt;p >;&lt;em>;Read our reviews of notable new fiction and nonfiction, updated every Wednesday.&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;a aria-label=&quot;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;The Best Books We Read This Week&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.newyorker.com/best-books-2023&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/best-books-2023&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/63c800e4e99d89b838ada996/1:1/w_200%2Cc_limit/undefined&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/63c800e4e99d89b838ada996/1:1/w_120,c_limit/undefined 120w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/a>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Maugham is a comfily unsurprising storyteller: the surprises are all procedural. Woolf&#39;s desired kick of life can be felt now and again, but is efficiently muffled by the great dexterity of the plotting and style. A familiar realist grammar dulls all interrogation, and the reader is happily brought along. Characters are primitively blocked in: “Hutchinson was a tall, stout man with a red face.” “His blue eyes, behind large gold-rimmed spectacles, were shrewd and vivacious, and there was a great deal of determination in his face.” “Crosbie was a big fellow well over six feet high, with broad shoulders, and muscular.” A robust core of cliché and formula keeps the stories sturdy and shipshape. Woolf&#39;s orchestra of gestures—a kiss is love, a grin is happiness—does its idle signalling: “She frowned as she thought of the reason which was taking her back to England.” (A frown is puzzlement.) There are also many twinkling eyes, sinking hearts, and ruthless stares. When Maugham attempts a simile, it&#39;s often an odd combination of the exaggerated and the secondhand: “His fist, with its ring of steel, caught him fair and square on the jaw. He fell like a bull under the pole-axe.” Or: “ &#39;Where&#39;s the cream, you fool?&#39; she roared like a lioness at bay.” It was a saving insight of another world-famous, commercially successful, and utterly professionalized writer of the era, P. G. Wodehouse, that a wild comic poetry could be made from such automatic realist filler. Why have a character just walk into a room (and a tale) if she can enter “with a slow and dragging step like a Volga boatman”? Why have someone roaring like a lioness at bay if instead you can make your readers laugh with “She looked like an aunt who has just bitten into a bad oyster”? Wodehouse, an instinctive anti-realist anarchist, is not only more experimental than Maugham but invariably the more precise stylist.&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;You could call Tan Twan Eng&#39;s new novel, “The House of Doors” (Bloomsbury), a kind of biblio-fiction: it offers, among other distinct pleasures, an imagined account of how Maugham came to write “The Letter,” and does so by combining novelistic hypothesis with the available biographical record. Eng&#39;s novel, set largely in the Malaysian state of Penang, juggles two central narratives, one from 1910 and one from 1921. Somerset Maugham visited Malaysia in 1921, and liked it enough that he stayed for six months—prospecting for stories, enjoying the admiration and the hospitality of his colonial British hosts, and vacationing in freedom with his secretary and lover, Gerald Haxton. (Maugham had a wife and a child back in London. He had excellent practical reasons to be cautious about publicizing his bisexuality.) In Eng&#39;s novelistic version, Maugham is famous enough that even one of the servants has read his work.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;ecjh4&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;gkjzzc&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Malaya, as it was known then, was under British administrative rule, and “The House of Doors” is set in the colonial world that Maugham evokes in “The Casuarina Tree”—sweat-prickled dinner parties with excellent local cuisine and nostalgically bad English food, comfortable racial prejudice, insular colonial gossip. Maugham&#39;s hosts are Robert and Lesley Hamlyn (Eng borrows the names from characters in “The Casuarina Tree”). Robert, a lawyer, is an old friend of Maugham&#39;s from their younger London days. Eng elegantly animates a complex social scene, in alternating chapters seen from Maugham&#39;s point of view (in the third person), and from Lesley Hamlyn&#39;s (in the first person). Maugham, known as Willie to his friends, has arrived with Haxton; it isn&#39;t immediately obvious to Lesley that the men are lovers, and the revelation is unwelcome. (“Why had I not seen it sooner? . . . We had a pair of bloody homosexuals under our roof. I shot a look at Robert—he knew; of course he knew.”) Lesley initially finds Maugham a little vulgar. She is unsettled by the writer&#39;s coldly scrutinizing stare, and instinctively sides with Maugham&#39;s abandoned wife against the two footloose gents who have taken up easy residence in her home. And Lesley has cause to feel neglected: she is living the underemployed existence of a colonial wife; Robert, who is eighteen years older, is chronically unwell; the marriage has curdled into respectful lovelessness. Maugham, meanwhile, receives a letter informing him that he has lost all his money. The New York brokerage firm with which he had invested forty thousand pounds has collapsed. Provoked by his losses to seek out promising new stories, he turns his attention to Lesley, who warily warms to her celebrated guest, and who indeed has stories to tell, three of which fill the second part of Eng&#39;s novel.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Lesley&#39;s tales, as recounted to Maugham, take us back to 1910, when she first read a newspaper report that her friend Ethel Proudlock had been arrested for murder. A neighbor, William Steward, visited Ethel&#39;s bungalow in the evening, while her husband was out; he assaulted her, and she shot him in self-defense. Ethel Proudlock is not Eng&#39;s fictional invention. Proudlock&#39;s trial, which took place in Kuala Lumpur in 1911, caused a sensation in the Malayan expatriate community, partly because she was well connected, and mainly because, bucking the complacent colonial assumption, she was not acquitted but sentenced to death. Lesley tells Maugham about the trial (she was called as a witness for the defense) and her visits to Ethel in prison. The trial and its aftermath are masterfully recounted; the long episode is the most compelling stretch in Eng&#39;s novel, which follows the broad outline of the historical record. Eng&#39;s fictional twist involves Ethel confessing to Lesley that she had been having an affair with William Steward; that she had broken off the relationship, and he had refused to accept it; and that when he visited her in a rage she shot him in self-defense. Rather than publicly admit to being an adulterer, the Ethel of “The House of Doors” silently takes her judgment, and is sentenced to be hanged. The actual Ethel Proudlock, as far as we know, made no such private admission, and her relationship to William Steward remained ambiguous. (In “The Letter,” Maugham&#39;s fictional addition is the letter itself. This novel allows us to examine the actual event of the trial, which is lightly fictionalized by Eng and was more heavily transmuted by Maugham, who, in turn, is novelized by Eng.)&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Eng moves the Proudlock trial from 1911 to 1910, so that he can run this narrative together with another of Lesley&#39;s reminiscences—her momentous encounter with Dr. Sun Yat-sen, who was elected the Republic of China&#39;s first provisional President at the end of 1911. When Sun visited the Hamlyns in 1910, he was a roving revolutionary, on what was essentially a fund-raising tour for his cause among a receptive local population that included Indians, Malays, and Chinese. Again, Eng—who was born in Penang in 1972, of Straits Chinese ancestry—nicely splices the historical record with various fictive weavings. The actual Sun did visit Penang in 1910; the Penang Conference, in November of that year, promised to be Sun&#39;s Finland Station moment, setting in motion the overthrow of the Qing dynasty. Eng&#39;s novelized addition has Lesley, unusually for a white British colonist, ardently drawn to Sun and his political movement. Initially, Maugham assumes that Lesley must have had an affair with the captivating Chinese radical; in time, he learns from her that she had an affair not with Sun but with one of his local political allies, a Chinese physician she calls Arthur. The two lovers had regular assignations at a house in town originally bought by Arthur&#39;s grandmother after her flight from China to Penang. It gives Eng&#39;s novel its title: the walls are “hung with wooden doors painted with birds and flowers, or mist-covered mountains. The upper halves of some of the doors were decorated with intricate fretwork of dragons and phoenixes.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“The House of Doors” is an assemblage, a house of curiosities. Eng can write with lyrical generosity and beautiful tact: moths are seen at night “flaking around the lamps”; elsewhere, also at nighttime, “a weak spill of light drew me to the sitting room.” Shadowy emotions are delicately figured: “His eyes, so blue and penetrating, were dusked by some emotion I could not decipher.” Lesley&#39;s account of her affair with Arthur has a lovely, drifting, dreamlike quality—the adulterers almost afloat on their new passion, watched over by the hanging painted doors of Arthur&#39;s house on Armenian Street. In these and other scenes, Eng demonstrates the control and the exquisite reticence that made his previous novel, “The Garden of Evening Mists,” a sharply magical collocation. But in this novel these moments seem to occur only when Eng provokes himself to some special point of intensity and concentration. They sit alongside plenty of slack and formulaic gesturing. History and geography arrive in large flat patches—say, the political context of Sun&#39;s radicalism, or Malaysia&#39;s special diversity. Early on, for instance, when Maugham tells Lesley&#39;s cook that the dinner is the best meal he has eaten “in the East,” Lesley conveniently replies, “You won&#39;t find anything like it anywhere in the world. 。 。 。 Over the centuries Penang has absorbed elements from the Malays and the Indians, the Chinese and the Siamese, the Europeans, and produced something that&#39;s uniquely its own. You&#39;ll find it in the language, the architecture, the food.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In the same vein, Eng&#39;s narrative can take on a tone of blandly fictionalized biography. When Eng dabs in a little backstory around Maugham&#39;s unhappy marriage to Syrie Wellcome, the writing dozes off: “Their rows grew more frequent and stormy. After another quarrel, he told himself that the situation could not go on.” Maugham recalls returning to London from one of his long trips: “ &#39;You missed Liza&#39;s birthday,&#39; Syrie reminded him barely half an hour after he had stepped inside 2 Wyndham Place, his four-storey Regency house in Marylebone.” This passage occurs in one of the chapters seen from Maugham&#39;s point of view; the writing is thus offering a kind of free indirect style. (It&#39;s headed “Willie, Penang, 1921.”) It is unclear why Willie Maugham would have to remind himself that he lives in a four-floor Regency house in Marylebone. This kind of biographical positivism—Eng stays close to the historical facts—has the effect of forestalling the most fertile element of the novel, its manner of layering the narratives. (We have the “real” Maugham, the “real” Proudlock trial, and then the lightly fictionalized versions of both offered by Eng, and the more heavily fictionalized version of the trial offered by Maugham.) The potential for a vertiginous examination of the instabilities and deceits of storytelling collapses too easily into novelized biography. The novel sends one back to the source texts.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Would Maugham have any reasonable objection to Eng&#39;s fictional portrait? Certainly, he&#39;d be quite at home in Eng&#39;s spacious suite of cliché. Here is Lesley at a colonial party at the Eastern &amp;amp; Oriental Hotel: “I nursed my glass of wine and eyed the women around me. 。 。 。 I groaned inwardly when I saw Mrs Biggs, the wife of the director of the Rickshaw Department, making a beeline for me. In a booming voice that could be heard over on the mainland, she asked me if it was true that Ethel Proudlock had been having an affair with William Steward.” Woolf&#39;s cinematic reaction shots are everywhere: “Her laughter ebbed into a smile. She crooked an eyebrow.” “Robert laughed, slapping his knee.” “He swore softly at himself.” (A curse is anger.) “Willie looked at us, mortification flushing his face.” (A blush is shame.) And so on.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;No doubt Eng is slyly mimicking the dated argot and patter of Maugham&#39;s work, a fictional universe of stinging retorts, inward groans, arched eyebrows, and the like. (For instance, Eng uses the verb “chaff”—to tease someone good-naturedly—in what looks like conscious imitation of Maugham, who liked the verb.) You could say that this stylistic inhabiting in turn allows Eng to do something daring and eccentric: to write, as a contemporary Malaysian writer of Chinese descent, a novel set in early-twentieth-century Penang almost entirely from the perspective of the interloping white community resident there. Into this apparently stable and monochrome existence, Eng then introduces the gentle subversion and deviance of his more interesting subplots—Lesley&#39;s passion for Sun Yat-sen&#39;s cause, Lesley&#39;s passion for Arthur, Maugham&#39;s passion for Gerald, Robert&#39;s erotic wandering.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;But these relationships and encounters lack the power and the narrative emphasis of the central Ethel Proudlock story, which casts an enviably dramatic shadow over the whole book. And the subversions are too gentle, so that Eng&#39;s portrait of Somerset Maugham and his colonial world has neither the rotten pungency of satire nor quite the vitality of a truly fresh realism. The kick of life always stubs its toe on cliché. Where is P. G. Wodehouse when you need him? ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;68rlzq&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 06 Nov 2023 20:06:01 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[How Can Determinists Believe in Free Will?]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/11/13/determined-a-science-of-life-without-free-will-robert-sapolsky-book-review]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-06T11:00:00.000Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6542de8305eb91fba6e6b197/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/231113_r43347.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;article >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attribute-verso-pattern=&quot;article-body&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;ArticlePageChunks&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;You&#39;re walking fast, late for work. The line into the subway is barely moving. A man is walking very slowly, holding up everyone behind him. You&#39;re annoyed. And then you catch a glimpse of him. He&#39;s walking with the shuffle of the very old. You&#39;re inclined to be a little more tolerant; after all, he can&#39;t walk any faster. You look again—no, he&#39;s not old, just drunk. It&#39;s too late for him to sober up, but, it occurs to you, it was once up to him not to be drunk. And now you&#39;re annoyed again.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;But why stop there? There are bars everywhere, and billboards advertising the pleasures of spirits. The days are getting colder, and you live in a cold country—a cold country and a decadent one. Everyone drinks; how could he do otherwise? But, again, why stop there? Generous soul that you are, you wonder if he had a bad day, or week, or year, or life—one marked by the kind of suffering from which the bottle promises respite. Can you be sure that he doesn&#39;t come from a long line of alcoholics, helpless in the grip of their compulsion?&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;You might go further. Perhaps all this was simply meant to be. Recall that old French polymath Pierre-Simon Laplace and his omniscient “demon.” If the demon knew where every particle in the universe was at a given moment, he could predict with perfect accuracy every moment in the future—which is another way of saying that the future is wholly “determined” by the past. The demon, of course, merely illustrates a thesis that can be stated in more sombre terms: everything that happens is the inevitable consequence of the laws of nature and what the universe was like once upon a time. We&#39;re bound to do what we in fact do.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;GenericCallout&quot;>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;external-link-embed--inline&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;a aria-label=&quot;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;The Best Books We Read This Week&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.newyorker.com/best-books-2023&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/best-books-2023&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;&lt;span >;&lt;strong>;The Best Books We Read This Week&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/a>;&lt;p >;&lt;em>;Read our reviews of notable new fiction and nonfiction, updated every Wednesday.&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;a aria-label=&quot;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;The Best Books We Read This Week&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.newyorker.com/best-books-2023&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/best-books-2023&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/63c800e4e99d89b838ada996/1:1/w_200%2Cc_limit/undefined&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/63c800e4e99d89b838ada996/1:1/w_120,c_limit/undefined 120w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/a>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;“Causal determinism,” the philosopher&#39;s unlovely term for that unsettling hypothesis, is the default assumption of most modern science. It matters a good deal if the idea implies that none of our actions are what we call “free.” If science tells us to be determinists, and determinism is incompatible with freedom, shouldn&#39;t we give up on judging people for doing what they were destined to do?&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;That&#39;s what the Stanford neurobiologist Robert M. Sapolsky urges. He thinks the time has come to accept the truth about determinism and acknowledge that “we have &lt;em>;no&lt;/em>; free will at all.” What follows? Early in his book “Determined: A Science of Life Without Free Will” (Penguin Press), Sapolsky lists, with the morbid relish of a man daring to think the unthinkable, the implications of his heresy: no one is ever blameworthy—or, equally, praiseworthy—for doing anything. No one, Sapolsky writes, “has &lt;em>;earned&lt;/em>; or is &lt;em>;entitled&lt;/em>; to being treated better or worse than anyone else.” Ordinary human sentiments—resentment and gratitude, love and hate—are pretty much irrational in their normal forms: “It makes as little sense to hate someone as to hate a tornado because it supposedly decided to level your house.” One practical implication is that, since nobody&#39;s to blame for anything, criminal justice shouldn&#39;t be about retribution. Accordingly, he tries to view human beings without judgment. Free-will skeptics are, he suggests, “less punitive and more forgiving.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The steps of his reasoning are familiar: if everything is determined, there is no freedom; if there is no freedom, there is no moral responsibility. Science tells us that everything is indeed determined. Ergo, no freedom; ergo, no responsibility. Are we bound to agree?&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Much of “Determined,” appropriately for a book by a neurobiologist, is an attempt to defend the part of the argument which sits safely in the scientist&#39;s wheelhouse: that our best contemporary science has established the truth of determinism. Sapolsky draws on explanations at every level—from atoms to culture—to make the case that everything we think and do is caused by something other than free will. We can&#39;t control, say, the conditions of the crucial first nine months of our existence. “Lots of glucocorticoids from Mom marinating your fetal brain, thanks to maternal stress, and there&#39;s increased vulnerability to depression and anxiety in your adulthood,” he writes. You thought your failing marriage was to blame for your depression. But it turns out it was all bound to happen long ago. It isn&#39;t so much that our blame was aimed in the wrong direction as it is that blame, in the strict sense, never truly made sense.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Biochemistry only confirms Sapolsky in his conviction, as does physics (though he treads more warily through the mysteries of a discipline at least as demanding as his own). History does, too: details from our species&#39; past, he argues, explain why some cultures are peaceable and others martial, some monotheistic and others polytheistic.&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Why do we resist the truth? In part because we&#39;re skilled at concocting stories in which we&#39;re in charge. One experiment Sapolsky mentions suggests that people had cooler attitudes about gay marriage when considering it in a room with a disgusting smell. The effect was connected to the way certain odors activate the brain&#39;s insular cortex, which is what makes rancid food nauseating to us. But did the subjects know what was going on in their heads? “Ask a subject, Hey, in last week&#39;s questionnaire you were fine with behavior A, but now (in this smelly room) you&#39;re not,” Sapolsky writes. “They&#39;ll claim some recent insight caused them, bogus free will and conscious intent ablaze, to decide that behavior A isn&#39;t okay after all.” They were being played, but were desperate to regard themselves as the players.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Sapolsky&#39;s summaries are pithy and pacy, his spoiling-for-a-fight tone enjoyably provocative. Still, he doesn&#39;t assert that any one piece of research demonstrates that there is no free will. Rather, he says, “All these disciplines collectively negate free will because they are all interlinked, constituting the same ultimate body of knowledge.” In the end, “there&#39;s not a single crack of daylight to shoehorn in free will.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;To his exasperation, though, many sophisticates are skeptical about free-will skepticism. In a 2020 survey of academic philosophers, some sixty per cent of them—a strikingly large majority in a profession allergic to consensus—didn&#39;t agree that determinism ruled out freedom. Where Sapolsky, who says that he has been a free-will skeptic since adolescence, sees an excitingly counterintuitive conclusion, philosophers often see a reductio ad absurdum. Determinism, they tend to hold, is compatible with freedom, and therefore with moral responsibility, and therefore with blame, gratitude, and so on.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The technical term for that happy reconciliation is “compatibilism.” A compatibilist, that is, agrees that our actions are determined but denies that this truth casts doubt on anything of significance about human practices. Sapolsky will have none of it. He devotes some of his most trenchant writing to these quislings, whose arguments, he claims, “boil down to three sentences”:&lt;/p>;&lt;blockquote >;&lt;div >;&lt;p>;a. Wow, there&#39;ve been all these cool advances in neuroscience, all reinforcing the conclusion that ours is a deterministic world.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;b. Some of those neuroscience findings challenge our notions of agency, moral responsibility, and deservedness so deeply that one must conclude that there is no free will.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;c. Nah, it still exists.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/blockquote>;&lt;p >;How fair is that précis? Sapolsky clearly thinks that philosophers should start with the results of the sciences (objective, external, impartial) and ask what they imply for our naïve prescientific self-conceptions. If science, coming from outside, tells us that our self-conceptions are confused, so much the worse for them. Yet there&#39;s another way of approaching the question: from the inside out.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Of those who take such an approach, the most influential is Peter Strawson, a compatibilist philosopher whose arguments make no appearance in “Determined.” (Sapolsky mentions him once in a list of his allies, evidently thinking of his son Galen.) What we label “free will,” as Strawson saw it, was something that we could grasp solely in relation to the role it plays in our lives, in our daily practices of judging others and ourselves.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Start from the fact that, in our dealings with other people, we are sometimes angry or resentful, or, in happier moments, grateful. Does the fact that we&#39;re material beings situated within vast chains of causation make these responses—Strawson calls them “reactive attitudes”—irrational? In any case, could we live an intelligible human life while giving up such reactions entirely?&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The really troubling forms of philosophical skepticism—say, about the authority of moral demands, the possibility of altruism, the legitimacy of governments—are troubling in part because it&#39;s possible to live without a belief in such things. Can we live without a belief in the possibility of holding one another and ourselves responsible for the things we do? Try it. We are always a “sorry,” a “thank you,” or a “how dare you” away from slipping back into the bad old ways. Sapolsky&#39;s long-standing convictions on the subject notwithstanding, he admits to being a normal guy with a normal guy&#39;s feelings. “It&#39;s been a moral imperative for me to view humans without judgment or the belief that anyone deserves anything special, to live without a capacity for hatred or entitlement,” he writes. “And I just can&#39;t do it.” He&#39;s in permanent misalignment with his theory of the world: “Sure, sometimes I can sort of get there, but it is rare that my immediate response to events aligns with what I think is the only acceptable way to understand human behavior; instead, I usually fail dismally.” If even the archest of skeptics cannot live out his skepticism, how serious an alternative is it?&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;xpap8e&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;po7h1&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;For that matter, if Sapolsky has no choice in how he thinks, what would it even be to try to think any particular way? It&#39;s unclear how he could subscribe to “hard incompatibilism,” as he avows, and believe in such ancien-régime vestiges as “moral imperatives.” The very idea that someone “ought” to do something makes sense only if that person is capable of making choices.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;For Strawson (like Kant before him), the difference between a story of causation and a story of choice-making is one of viewpoint. We&#39;ll never purge ourselves of those “reactive attitudes,” nor should we try to. But that&#39;s not a rejection of determinism; as Strawson says, we can sometimes “achieve a kind of detachment from the whole range of natural attitudes and reactions . 。 。 and view another person (and even, perhaps, though this must surely be more difficult, oneself) in a purely objective light—to see another or others simply as natural creatures whose behavior, whose actions and reactions, we may seek to understand, predict and perhaps control.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;The parents of teen-age boys are always oscillating between regarding their impossible offspring as creatures moved by hormones to do stupid things and regarding them as rational human beings who should know better. In time, those boys will learn to give Mom a pass for her possibly perimenopausal outbursts and understand that Dad, with his atherosclerosis, occasionally forgets things. On a night out in college, they&#39;ll learn to spot when it might still be possible to persuade an increasingly drunk friend to order an Uber home and the point at which all that remains to do is to pick him up off the ground and bundle him into one as if he were an unwieldy mattress.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;What Sapolsky considers “the only acceptable way to understand human behavior,” then, is one that we adopt &lt;em>;some&lt;/em>; of the time. Is it really one we should adopt &lt;em>;all&lt;/em>; of the time? Physics tells us a story about ourselves in which we are as much matter and energy as that mattress. Biochemistry tells us another story. So does neuroscience. So do history, psychology, and anthropology. All these modes of explanation tell us, in various ways, that people are causal systems, enmeshed in larger ones. But, from a first-person perspective, we&#39;re seldom inclined to wait around to see what the system does when we&#39;re faced with a decision. Instead, we do what even Sapolsky finds himself compelled to do—we get on with things and open the kitchen cupboard to decide (or, anyway, “decide”) what kind of tea we&#39;re going to have.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;A few minutes later, a kettle boils.为什么？ Consider these answers: because I want a cup of Earl Grey; because it&#39;s teatime in England and that&#39;s what we do around here; because the water molecules have reached a certain energy state. Must we choose among these statements? Can&#39;t they all be true?&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Sapolsky, to his credit, resists the fallacy of moving from ontological reductionism (the correct view that we&#39;re all physical stuff, governed by the laws of physics) to methodological reductionism (the error of concluding that physics is the only discipline that explains anything). Wisely, he doesn&#39;t think that history, psychology, or anthropology are just window dressing on the hard truth of our material, molecular existence. Mental states and neurobiological physical states, Sapolsky thinks, “can&#39;t be separated—they&#39;re just two different conceptual entry points to considering the same processes.” Different, but apparently equal, neither privileged over the other. Why, then, does he resist the first-person register of explanation, in which we believe, want, intend, and decide?&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Probably because his notion of “free will” isn&#39;t the one we actually make use of. Every now and then, it occurs to Sapolsky that the parties to the debate may be talking past each other, and he makes an effort, a little grudgingly, to clarify his terms. “What is free will?” he asks early in the book. “Groan, we have to start with that.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;What follows is not a definition but a challenge. A man, Sapolsky invites us to imagine, “pulls the trigger of a gun.” That&#39;s one description. Another is that “the muscles in his index finger contracted.”为什么？ “Because they were stimulated by a neuron,” which was in turn “stimulated by the neuron just upstream. 。 。 。 And so on.” Then he throws down the gauntlet: “Show me a neuron (or brain) whose generation of a behavior is independent of the sum of its biological past, and for the purposes of this book, you&#39;ve demonstrated free will.”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;uo6ixw&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Sapolsky&#39;s qualifying phrase—“for the purposes of this book”—suggests he recognizes that there are other things “free will” might mean to other people. The real question is whether the thing he thinks has been disproved will be much missed—whether Sapolsky&#39;s concept of free will is “our” concept, what we take it to be when, uncorrupted by the specialists, we go about our days blaming and thanking, loving and hating.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;His definition of free will, or the test he proposes in lieu of one, exemplifies an approach advocated in the nineteen-fifties and sixties by the German-born philosopher Rudolf Carnap, one of the great exponents of logical positivism. Carnap, who thought that philosophy should be a handmaiden to the sciences, found ordinary language squishy and unreliable; philosophers, he argued, should reconstruct, or “explicate,” its terms in more precise ways. Take a term of ordinary language such as “warm,” a word we understand as relating to our sensations, and a term of science, “temperature,” which, unlike “warm,” is a quantitative notion, employable in scientific formulas. Carnap thought that we would do well to replace the first with the second, or, anyway, to use the second to define the first. Something is warmer when its temperature increases, and the temperature of a room, unlike its mere “warmth,” can be precisely and objectively defined with reference to a thermometer.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In the positivist spirit, a philosopher or a scientist may replace “We have free will” with some determinate claim that might be supported or undermined by experimental evidence. But if we&#39;re going to allow the experimental results, and the ambitious thesis that they support, to overthrow our everyday practices of praising, blaming, and punishing, the scientific explication had better be close enough to the everyday concept that underlies these practices. Otherwise, as Strawson—a leading critic of Carnap, and of logical positivism—objected at the time, we&#39;re not solving a problem; we&#39;re just changing the subject.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Sapolsky may want us to replace our everyday concept, complex and muddled as it must be, with a new, improved concept. But he needs to offer us a good argument for doing so. In other words, if this isn&#39;t how we already use “free will,” is it how we &lt;em>;should&lt;/em>; use it? We don&#39;t ask this question often enough. Maybe that&#39;s because “free will” has become, for better or for worse, a term of ordinary language. As with other such large, abstract questions, our professed views on the free-will problem rarely do justice to the complexity of our real thoughts on the subject.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;There are sane and humane reasons for reminding ourselves that, as Sapolsky puts it, “&lt;em>;some&lt;/em>; people have much less self-control and capacity to freely choose their actions than average, and that at times, we &lt;em>;all&lt;/em>; have much less than we imagine.” But Sapolsky and skeptical fellow-travellers such as Sam Harris want to blow up our everyday practices; they&#39;re convinced that the innumerable subtle distinctions we mark in our ordinary talk and practices don&#39;t matter. Whatever it is we think we&#39;ve got, we haven&#39;t got it.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;82gmdk&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;df99mb&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Once we give up on free will, after all, we have to be willing to say that nobody has ever done anything intentionally (or voluntarily or deliberately or on purpose). That no line can truly be drawn between the malicious and the accidental, the voluntary and the forced. That no event has really been an &lt;em>;action&lt;/em>;, except in the undemanding sense in which the puppet Punch killing Judy was an action. We are not, except in this minimal sense, “agents.” Bits of our bodies move; things happen. That&#39;s it.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Yet we can wonder whether this ideal of the “causeless cause” is what we really mean in our careless everyday talk of free will. If it isn&#39;t, then insisting on that as the appropriate standard is, as Strawson once remarked, “like offering a text-book on physiology to someone who says (with a sigh) that he wished he understood the workings of the human heart.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;As it happens, Carnap&#39;s own definition, or explication, of “free choice” was devised to be compatible with the truth of determinism. Free choice, he wrote, “is a decision made by someone capable of foreseeing the consequences of alternate courses of action and choosing that which he prefers.” He saw no contradiction between free choice thus understood and even the strongest form of determinism. More than that, he thought that without determinism—that is to say, without reliable relations of cause and effect—there &lt;em>;is&lt;/em>; no free will. The point of making a choice, he noted, is that it has consequences. Indeterminacy—should the kind that exists at the quantum level encroach upon the meso-level scale of human lives—would replace our agency with sheer randomness, which is not anyone&#39;s idea of freedom.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Still, if Sapolsky&#39;s radical revisionism threatens to eliminate our moral vocabulary altogether, the traditional compatibilist approaches can err in the other direction: they can deny us grounds for reforming our practices of moral judgment. So we might want to ask—in the philosophical tradition not of positivism but of pragmatism—about the “cash value,” the practical uses, of invoking free will. Ignore the many things we say about free will and focus on what we do. By attending to our practices, we can conduct a more profitable line of inquiry: What do we need free will to be?&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Consider these questions. How does my response to a student who has failed to meet a deadline change when I discover that she sprained her wrist the day before? How do I respond to a piece of fruit chucked at me when I discover that the chucker is two years old? How vehemently do I press for a tough prison sentence when I learn that the defendant was abused as a child? Is there a difference between someone jumping into a pool and being pushed in? Between falling in after he stepped on a banana peel and falling in because he was drunk?&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In each of these situations, we can ask whether the person in question had or lacked something called “free will.” But look back at the factors that seemed to undermine the exercise of free will: rotten luck, immaturity, circumstance, coercion, accident, and incapacity. When the terms on the obverse side of the contrast are so disparate, it&#39;s hard to be confident that there really is a single thing called “free will” whose presence or absence we can meaningfully debate.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The philosopher J. L. Austin, in a paper titled “A Plea for Excuses,” observed that, though it&#39;s tempting to view “freedom” as a positive term requiring elucidation, we tend to use it just to rule out one of these miscellaneous antitheses. Freedom&#39;s just another word for no excuses. In Austin&#39;s spirit, you can wonder how much would be lost if we ceased talking about free will altogether and spoke more specifically of what we meant. “He was not acting of his own free will,” you tell me. “What do you mean?” I ask. “Was he being held at gunpoint? Sleepwalking? High on narcotics?” “Oh, no,” you say, “I just mean he&#39;s a toddler.” Maybe you should have just said that. Maybe, in other words, there is no &lt;em>;one&lt;/em>; thing that we need “free will” to be.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Sapolsky&#39;s most persuasive passages remind us of the many modest changes that we have made to our practices in light of advances in our understanding of certain facts about ourselves. Things got better for people with epilepsy once we learned that the condition was not a form of demonic possession that was “brought on by someone&#39;s own freely chosen evil.” Things got better for people with schizophrenia (and for their families) once it was recognized that the condition was at base a biochemical disorder, not a product of faulty mothering. Some of our current moral conceptions and presumptions may come to seem just as confused. We may currently be blaming people whom it would be better to treat, tolerate, or simply avoid.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;hhm4k&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Or, perhaps, better to forgive. That was, after all, part of Sapolsky&#39;s case for his new morality: free-will skeptics are “less punitive and more forgiving.” To understand all, he might have said, is to forgive all. But he can&#39;t have really meant that. Forgiveness is, as much as vengeance, a concept that can be applied only from within the first-person point of view. If free-will skepticism means never having to say you&#39;re sorry, then it also means never being forgiven. Sapolsky&#39;s ethic of forgiveness demands that we retain something of our old-fashioned belief in holding one another responsible.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The traditional project of compatibilist philosophers has been to treat determinism, free will, and moral responsibility as fixed parts of a triad and to search for ways to reconcile them. The skeptics, seeing an irresolvable contradiction, have concluded that the whole idea of moral responsibility has to go. But there are other ways of reconciling scientific and moral inquiry. It may be that we need a suppler and more humane approach to holding one another responsible, an approach that takes more seriously what our best scientific accounts tell us about ourselves. We needn&#39;t follow the skeptics to the conclusion that the best morality would be no morality at all to recognize that our current morality remains a work in progress. ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;07m5iq&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 06 Nov 2023 20:06:01 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“Our Time Is Up,” by Clare Sestanovich]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/11/13/our-time-is-up-fiction-clare-sestanovich]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-06T11:00:00.000Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654287ded2c509c63cc3e5c9/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/231113_r43346.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;article >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attribute-verso-pattern=&quot;article-body&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;ArticlePageChunks&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;figure data-testid=&quot;IframeEmbed&quot; >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;IframeEmbedContainer&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;svg focusable=&quot;false&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 12 12&quot; width=&quot;32&quot; height=&quot;32&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Audio available&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M6 0C2.68573 0 0 2.68573 0 6V8.73736C0 10.5187 1.48129 12 3.26262 12H3.78785V11.0578C4.2899 10.8595 4.60907 10.3691 4.60907 9.8323V7.64241C4.60907 7.10556 4.28989 6.61524 3.78785 6.41698V5.47476H3.26262C2.39306 5.47476 1.62721 5.79438 1.05047 6.32323V6C1.05047 3.29202 3.29202 1.05047 6 1.05047C8.70797 1.05047 10.9495 3.29202 10.9495 6V6.32323C10.3728 5.79438 9.6069 5.47476 8.73736 5.47476H8.21216V6.41698C7.71013 6.61524 7.39092 7.10555 7.39092 7.64241V9.8323C7.39092 10.3692 7.71012 10.8595 8.21216 11.0578V12H8.73736C10.5187 12 12 10.5187 12 8.73736V6C12 2.68573 9.31422 0 6 0Z&quot; fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; clip-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;Listen to this story&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;iframe height=&quot;60&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; sandbox=&quot;allow-scripts allow-same-origin&quot; title=&quot;Embedded Frame&quot; src=&quot;https://www.wnyc.org/widgets/ondemand_player/thenewyorker/#file=https://downloads.newyorker.com/mp3/231113_sestanovich_audio.mp3&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay *; encrypted-media *; clipboard-write; autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture&quot;>;&lt;/iframe>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;p>;Clare Sestanovich reads.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;p >;The mirrors reveal when it&#39;s time to clean again. A thin layer of dust on the one in the bedroom, toothpaste and fingerprints on the one in the bathroom, which doubles as a cabinet door. All the windows become mirrors at the end of the day, when it takes a subtle adjustment of the eyes to look through yourself instead of at yourself. But the windows will never be cleaned; the most that can be hoped for is a hard, purifying rain. There&#39;s a yellow streak of bird shit on the glass in the living room, crusted over now, and the kitchen window still bears the ghostly pattern that Angela once traced on the fogged-up surface while waiting for something on the stove, she can no longer remember what: a pot to boil, a formless egg to acquire edges and turn opaque, a single drop of oil to escape its pan and scald her out of her thoughts.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Since when does Angela care about cleaning? The other day, at dinner with a friend, she found herself extolling the virtues of a certain type of mop. She recently learned several methods for removing stains from supposedly stainless steel. She has even wished, on occasion, that she owned an iron.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;An iron! More symbol than tool at this point, and Angela doesn&#39;t like what the symbol stands for. She&#39;s not a housewife. For one thing, she rents. True, she&#39;s married, but there wasn&#39;t really a wedding, because she&#39;s opposed to weddings. She&#39;s employed. In theory, empowered.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;GenericCallout&quot;>;&lt;p >;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/books/this-week-in-fiction/clare-sestanovich-11-13-23&quot;>;Clare Sestanovich on routine and rupture.&lt;/a>;&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;The thing about the mop is that it&#39;s satisfying. Under the supervision of a therapist, Angela and Will have been talking a lot about satisfaction. How to define it, where to find it, whether they can feel it—have it—at the same time. Each swipe of the mop proves its usefulness, a glistening arc on a floor that a second ago looked OK but now is revealed to have been dusty and dull all along. The water in the bucket turns gray.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Angela doesn&#39;t like the therapist. Why are they talking about satisfaction when they could be talking about happiness?&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;When I was your age—&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Angela has heard this sentence completed so many times, in so many ways, that by now she can line up her mother&#39;s entire life beside her own entire life (thus far) and compare them year by year. She can try on the other life as you might try on a dress forgotten at the back of the closet: with no hope of it fitting, and yet with some perverse desire to see exactly where the seams stretch or the zipper catches, where two pieces of fabric refuse to meet.&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;At age six, Angela&#39;s mother watched the apartment building where she and her parents lived burn to the ground. At age six, Angela moved into a new house, with her very own bedroom. She was afraid to fall asleep in it, her heart beating wildly in the dark.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;At eight, Angela&#39;s mother lost her father. Something to do with the smoke that had got into his lungs. At eight, Angela lost her asthma inhaler. She knew it was expensive, so she didn&#39;t tell anyone for weeks, wheezing loudly through gym class.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;GenericCallout&quot;>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;Podcast: The Writer&#39;s Voice&lt;/strong>;&lt;br/>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/podcast/the-writers-voice/clare-sestanovich-reads-our-time-is-up&quot;>;&lt;em>;Listen to Clare Sestanovich read “Our Time Is Up.”&lt;/em>;&lt;/a>;&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;At eleven, Angela&#39;s mother worked all afternoon in her stepfather&#39;s laundromat, where he occasionally slid his hand under her shirt or, in the summertime, up the loose openings in her shorts. She started wearing pants all year round. At eleven, Angela tried to pretend that her nipples, which had puffed up and made two tiny tents in her T-shirt, did not exist. Once (but only once), a boy in her class pinched the left tent between his thumb and his index finger, and then it definitely existed.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;At eighteen, Angela&#39;s mother did not get to go to college. At eighteen, Angela did not want to go to college. She wanted to live on a farm in Italy, where she could turn grapes into wine with her bare feet. She had saved nine hundred dollars of her hard-earned wages for airfare.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;At twenty-two, Angela&#39;s mother married Angela&#39;s father, in a church. He was more than a decade older than her, but, if anything, she considered that a good thing: he had more experience, and also more money. At twenty-two, Angela, having never been to Italy, having been reminded that her mother did not receive a single cent of her own hard-earned wages until her stepfather died, graduated with a degree in American Studies. Degrees were also said to be earned, but other than a large amount of debt, which could not possibly be paid off by crushing grapes between her toes, Angela didn&#39;t think there was much evidence that she deserved hers.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;At twenty-five, Angela&#39;s mother had Angela&#39;s brother. At twenty-five, Angela took Plan B: once for a broken condom, once after unprotected sex with a man who was married, and once because of a nameless, baseless feeling that there was something inside her that needed to be expelled.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;4leqt8&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;At thirty-one, Angela&#39;s mother had Angela. At thirty-one, Angela went to her first baby shower. Gifts everywhere: clothes that would fit for only a few months, a stroller that cost as much as a used car. She vowed never to go to one again.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;At thirty-nine, Angela&#39;s mother threatened to divorce Angela&#39;s father. An affair. She eventually reconsidered, but not before she told Angela all about it. In the end, she said, pity won out: he didn&#39;t even know how to use the washing machine.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Here Angela&#39;s desire for comparison flags. She will be forty at the end of the year. Thinking about her mother&#39;s life is tiring, though not as tiring, she reminds herself in her mother&#39;s voice, as actually living it. The dress is harder to take off than it was to put on. Having tugged it over her hips, she leaves it there, the empty top flopping in front of her. Her stomach is soft and her breasts are heavy and she has no children to blame for either fact. None of this—her painless upbringing, her pointless degree, the money she finally spent on a vacation to Tuscany, which she could have spent on a thousand other things or, better yet, saved—would matter to Angela&#39;s mother if there were children.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;The therapist suggests that they talk about what matters to Angela instead of what matters to her mother. Will nods. He agrees with the therapist because he&#39;s agreeable, which is part of why Angela married him, which is why she can&#39;t object to the nodding, even though it irritates her. She wishes she were agreeable, too. Like the therapist, Will is full of good suggestions: more intimacy (physical), less inertia (existential). He wonders aloud if they should get a cat.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Whenever her mother calls, Angela nods to prove she&#39;s listening. They live four hundred miles apart: Angela by the beach, her mother in the desert. They used to talk every Sunday afternoon, but lately her mother has been calling on any day, at any time, even late at night. In the middle of a conversation, she accuses Angela of having hung up, and Angela has to remind herself that nodding means nothing on the phone. The only person she&#39;s proving anything to is herself.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The summer heat arrives and Angela opens all the windows, relieving herself of her reflection. The dust that accumulates during this time of year is no more visible than dust at any other time of the year, but, when Angela wipes the surfaces in the apartment with a microfibre cloth, the cloth ends up not the usual gray but a more alarming black. They live on a busy street. The dust is probably more like soot. They could close the windows, but Angela doesn&#39;t like the artificial cold of air-conditioning.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Plus, refrigerants are bad for the planet.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“But pollutants are bad for us,” Will says.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;As a compromise, they turn on the AC only at night. In some ways, they&#39;re too good at compromising. Every morning, the air is dry, their eyes crusty.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Early one Monday, before leaving for the office, Angela removes the eye crust and applies mascara in front of the bathroom mirror—clean but streaky. She works at a talent agency, where her job is to believe that her clients&#39; big break is about to come, or else to refuse to believe that it has come and gone. All the clients, mostly actors and models, put a lot of work into their appearance, and so do many of the agents. In front of the mirror, Angela ignores the way her eyelashes clump together unattractively, because in general she doesn&#39;t try very hard to be attractive. Her halfhearted makeup is, in its way, a point of pride. Unlike her apparent affinity for mops and irons and microfibre rags, her disdain for the rules and rewards of feminine style is a small triumph of principle.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Half an hour later, stopped in traffic, Angela watches a driver in the next lane apply lipstick, then brush a fine powder over her face. The cars start moving and the woman keeps brushing. Dangerous! (But as dangerous as refrigerants? As pollution? As turning into your mother?) Behind her, the other cars start to honk. The woman snaps her compact shut and, without turning her head, raises a middle finger in the air. Triumphs of principle are everywhere, Angela thinks, now doubting her own. Is the woman more or less attractive than her? She tries to get a better look at the woman&#39;s face, but the other car speeds up and is soon out of sight. In traffic, Angela somehow always chooses the slowest lane.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;d4it09&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Attraction, related to satisfaction, is another one of the therapist&#39;s big themes. After eleven years, Will still says Angela is beautiful. The therapist suggests the word “sexy,” which makes Angela recoil. Will notices, of course. He&#39;s disappointed, of course. They don&#39;t have as much sex as he would like.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;His disappointment is a wide, finely meshed net—hard to wriggle out of. In her efforts, Angela is tempted again toward principle: what is this, the nineteen-fifties? Haven&#39;t we agreed that husbands are not the only ones who get to have desires? These questions sound pointed when she practices them behind the steering wheel—when she&#39;s impatient or aggrieved, when she&#39;s alone—but they don&#39;t lead anywhere good.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;At the office, Angela sits at a desk that&#39;s hers on some days and Carrie&#39;s on others. There&#39;s a sticky note from Carrie on the computer screen. &lt;em>;Remove crumbs from keyboard&lt;/em>;. Mortified, Angela tears up the note and throws it in the trash.&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;a data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/11/13/our-time-is-up-fiction-clare-sestanovich&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/11/13/our-time-is-up-fiction-clare-sestanovich&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;“Dont you see You were never an ugly duckling.

Wives (another word to recoil from) get to have them, too. Angela can see Will nod. But what does she desire? As she extracts crumbs from between the keys, a string of letters, utter nonsense, appears on her screen.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Will and Angela started therapy because of the kids question: whether they want them, what it would mean to have them. For years, they&#39;ve avoided answering it by discussing it—long, looping conversations that are never finished, only abandoned. Afterward, they cry or fall asleep or order an elaborate takeout meal, which makes Angela feel guilty: all that plastic. Now they&#39;re running out of time to answer the question, but they&#39;ve spent at least half of their sessions arguing over a different one: whether Angela&#39;s mother needs to move out of her house. It&#39;s Angela&#39;s father&#39;s house, too, but Angela never thinks of it that way. He bought it, but her mother chose it. He left it early in the morning and returned to it late at night. She decorated it and redecorated it. He called from the top of the stairs when he was looking for something he couldn&#39;t find.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;At first, Angela and Will were in agreement about the house: things were getting out of hand; alarm bells were ringing. But Angela lost the argument with her mother, and after that her only choice was to bury it someplace inaccessible, practically unrememberable. To see Will dig it up again was enraging—more enraging, somehow, than the original dispute.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“How can you ignore it?”他问。 He&#39;s incredulous, but never impatient. “It&#39;s right in front of our eyes.” The therapist smiles at him encouragingly.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Will means the plastic bags, the stacks of magazines, the clamshell containers, the shelf in the pantry where her mother keeps all the complimentary snacks she&#39;s received on airplanes: miniature packages of pretzels and cookies, squat cans of tomato juice. (She protests if the flight attendant tries to open the can.) Admittedly, these collections are fastidiously organized. The plastic bags are stored in the sleeves of Angela&#39;s father&#39;s old dress shirts, which dangle from hooks all over the kitchen like severed limbs.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;And not all of it, as Angela&#39;s mother and then Angela herself have pointed out, is trash. Her mother is a talented ceramicist, a hobby that she practiced in moderation for the many decades that she had a job, and then in a kind of ecstatic frenzy as soon as she didn&#39;t. At her job—first she was a secretary and then she was an administrative assistant, though the work itself never changed—she didn&#39;t get to produce anything. Now every surface in the house displays her wares. Empty flower vases and stacks of cereal bowls, mugs that chart her progress at the wheel, their slouching posture improving until they are all in perfect, proud proportion. She makes teapots and gravy boats, despite never making tea or gravy. On a high shelf, Angela once found half a dozen egg cups, each one painted with a baby chick. She stood on a stool, eye level with the chicks. Why doesn&#39;t her mother give these things away?&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The therapist tries to steer the conversation back to bigger, harder questions.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;“Put aside, for a second, who &lt;em>;you&#39;re&lt;/em>; attracted to,” she says to Angela at the start of one session. “Do you believe that someone could be attracted to you?”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The therapist looks about the same age as Angela&#39;s mother. A second-waver, probably. (Not that Angela&#39;s mother has ever heard of the second wave.) She wears sensible shoes but expensive sweaters. Over the course of their sessions, she&#39;s been letting her hair gradually go gray. Angela can picture her in one of those consciousness-raising groups in the seventies, where all the women were given mirrors and instructed to look at their vaginas—presumably for the first time. The idea, as Angela understands it, was that once you saw yourself you could know yourself. &lt;em>;Be&lt;/em>; yourself.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Sounds nice! The mirror stuff seems quaint now, but Angela isn&#39;t totally sure why. Was everyone supposed to have done their own self-exploration—self-realization—long ago? She certainly hadn&#39;t. In adolescence, the approved period for such exploring, the only suitable mirror in her parents&#39; house would have been the full-length in the hall closet, next to the winter coats and the umbrellas. And anyway, back then, Angela had a different scale of exploration in mind: Italy, the Alps, something vast and impersonal. The sticky, unfamiliar folds of her vulva grossed her out. By the time she could appreciate the point of more local knowledge, it seemed too late. Plenty else had been down there: fingers, tongues, a whole clove of garlic (for bacterial vaginosis), various buzzing rubber toys (for fun). After all that, to admit that she hadn&#39;t fully seen what she had let many people touch would have been too embarrassing.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;v32k1r&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Now is the time to admit it. Here is a paid professional, a licensed therapist, who has been asking for their admissions. But Angela is pretty sure she&#39;s seen enough. You don&#39;t really need the mirror. The clitoris is a raisin flattened by a shoe. One of her labia, slightly larger than the other, droops like a lazy eyelid. It&#39;s not the vivid, secret pink of the body&#39;s interior. Like any exterior, its original color has been weathered a worldly gray.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;When Angela&#39;s father falls and breaks his wrist, it&#39;s been a few months since Angela and Will last argued about the house. Her father is eighty-one, with a history of minor hospitalizations. This time, he slipped, or tripped—the story is vague. He tried to brace his fall. It could happen to anyone, her mother keeps saying, which means: it could happen to someone young. He&#39;s still in the hospital, for some reason; his blood pressure, her mother says cryptically. Or maybe his blood-cell count? Her uncertainty is alarming enough that Angela and Will book a hotel with credit-card points and fly from Los Angeles to Phoenix. Angela makes certain compromises on the plane. They&#39;ll fix up the house. The junk can go, but the art will stay. Or fine, not all of it: just the essential stuff, the not lopsided stuff.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Will has made an informational call to a retirement community. There are tour guides who can show them around. Angela doesn&#39;t want to talk about it.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“My mom is barely seventy.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Will doesn&#39;t say anything, because he knows she knows what he will say: age is always relative. He scrolls through the facility&#39;s promotional materials online, tilting the screen in her direction.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Is there any harm in looking?”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;There&#39;s a dining room, a rec room, a man-made pond, a hair salon. There are art classes and therapy groups. One wing is for what the Web site calls independent living. How could anyone object to independent living?&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“They&#39;d be able to stay together,” Will says.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Who said anything about them splitting up?”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In the tense silence that follows, Angela, in the middle seat, becomes aware of the woman to her right—younger than her, but not by much, staring studiously out the window. From this angle, it&#39;s hard to know what the woman really looks like; she might look very different if they were face to face.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“It can&#39;t be cheap,” Angela says.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;With the therapist, she and Will have planned to discuss the cost of children. They haven&#39;t said anything about the cost of parents. Angela follows the younger woman&#39;s gaze out the window, but the view is obstructed by the wing of the plane. She closes her eyes and listens to the engine, to remind herself that there is something keeping so much heavy metal aloft.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;When Angela pictures her mother, the image that appears is decades out of date. Dark hair and unspotted skin, a bony frame that would be called petite, not fragile. This image feels like something she&#39;s remembering rather than inventing, but it&#39;s hard to tell the difference. When Angela opens her eyes, the flight attendant is handing her a paper napkin and a flimsy cup. Soda crackles over ice. She splits open a package of almonds and pours them straight into her mouth.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;They buy a seat for the shower and put a plastic bag over her father&#39;s cast before turning the water on. He&#39;s still not entirely steady on his feet.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“See,” her mother insists. “He&#39;s going to need plastic bags.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Patiently, Will tells her that she can keep one shirtsleeve&#39;s worth. He unstuffs the rest, pulling the bags out one at a time, until there are a dozen limp arms on the counter. He looks around for his next task.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The kitchen&#39;s elaborate architecture of detritus—towers of dishwashered takeout containers, a whole skyline of empty salad-dressing bottles—turns out to conceal a simpler, uglier landscape: mold, moth larvae, grease, something sticky, cobwebs, crumbs, pencil shavings, more mold. Angela&#39;s mother does not avoid the evidence. While Angela herds mouse droppings into a dustpan, she hovers behind her, enumerating all the treasures that she&#39;s saved over the years: swim-team trophies, letters from summer camp, red-eyed photographs with elaborate captions written on the back. When she says “saved,” what she means is “rescued.” Angela&#39;s prom dress is shrouded in dry-cleaner plastic and kept, inexplicably, in the hall closet.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“This is your past,” her mother says, sweeping her arm grandly around the house. “Your history.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Back at the hotel, Will takes a long shower. Angela consults the minibar prices, turns the TV on and then instantly off. Listening to the shower spray the shower curtain, Angela considers whether to repeat what her mother said. “History” is a weighty word. Will might think she&#39;s telling him in order to pick a fight, or at least to make a point, but she would be telling him only to—well, just to tell him. She has no idea what the point is. The water turns off. The shower rings slide along the rod. This is the unbidden intimacy of routine: to know exactly what he is doing on the other side of a closed door. In her head, she can see him turn his towel into a rope, then shuttle it back and forth across his back. At what point, she wonders, does routine become life? He opens the door an inch: steam, heat, a vaguely floral scent. Next, he&#39;ll smear a circle on the mirror, stick his neck out to get closer to his reflection. He&#39;ll look with special scrutiny at the stray hairs on his neck and shoulders. They&#39;re hardly noticeable, pale and delicate—almost elegant in their alienness, Angela thinks—but they distress him. As a kid, Will says, he dreaded his father&#39;s bare torso, pale and lumpy clay from which misplaced hairs just like these seemed to be constantly multiplying, his body newly confused about where and what to grow.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The bathroom door opens all the way. Angela can tell that Will is surprised to find her there watching him—instead of watching the TV, say, or whatever it is on her phone that makes her smile the faint, enigmatic smile he no longer asks about. (What&#39;s so funny?) In this room that looks exactly as they expected it would, surprise saves them. They smile at each other and their smiles are at least a little bit enigmatic. They kiss each other. His chest still wet, his neck and ears steamed pink. His hair, dripping onto her forehead, makes her think of dew. The way desire can feel brand new every time. She takes one of his errant shoulder hairs between her teeth and tugs.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;2qfujc&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;But the sound he makes is not the right kind of pain. Not enlivening pain. Not sexy pain. It&#39;s the sound of ordinary displeasure, the quick-drying disappointment of bodies that no amount of steam and soap will transform. Instinctively, he pulls away. Angela looks down at her shirt, at the Rorschach imprint of Will&#39;s damp chest. Is this shame or anger? Her mistake or his? He&#39;ll insist it&#39;s OK; he&#39;ll try to recover, because their therapist has taught them the importance of resiliency. Even the not young, they have been assured, can bounce back. Will touches Angela&#39;s shoulder, which should feel comforting, even arousing, but instead feels like nothing. She thinks about the bedspread getting wet under his towel. She multiplies fifty-two by eleven. Five hundred and seventy-two weeks of on-average weekly sex, plus another hundred for the early weeks (the sexy weeks), minus twenty or thirty for some of the later weeks (the worst weeks).&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“What are you thinking about?” His hand is still on her shoulder.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Angela goes to the bathroom and closes the door. The room is still full of moisture, the toilet seat damp under her thighs. She lingers at the sink. Holding her wrists under cold water, she can see the outline of the circle he wiped on the mirror. She leans in, so that the portal perfectly frames her face, and then she looks away.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In the morning, her mother has brought the trophies up from the basement. Plastic figures caught in the act of achievement: tennis racquet in mid-swing, cleated foot in mid-kick, toes curled on a ledge, ready to dive into some unseen body of water. Angela remembers these trophies clearly. Before each competition, they were lined up by height so that everyone could compare them in advance: from impressive pedestals all the way down to mere platforms. Each extra tier made the thing easier to grip, more satisfying to hoist in the air the way real athletes do. The trophies meant nothing after that, once they&#39;d been brought home and clustered among all the others of similar height.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;But now here they are on the carpet, insisting on their prowess even as their gold coating chips away, exposing the dull surface underneath. Scurrying up and down the stairs, her mother seems younger than she did yesterday. Will picks up a trophy, looking back and forth between the figure and Angela, as if searching for a resemblance.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;“You never told me you played softball.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“I didn&#39;t, really.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The faces on the trophies look like they&#39;ve been melted off, shiny and blank. Angela&#39;s mother shouts from the basement, “Of course you did!”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;She emerges clutching an outfielder&#39;s androgynous torso. The story she tells is something out of a movie. A championship game, a home run destined to break the tie, until Angela, backed up against the center-field fence, grabbed it right out of the air. Robbed!&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Angela is about to object, but Will beats her to it: “No way.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;He&#39;s found a cardboard box and is stacking the trophies on their sides, which makes them look like a pile of corpses. As always, his incredulity is mild; her mother may not even have noticed it. She hurries over to the box, waving her hands above it ineffectually.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Wait—wait a minute.” Bending down over the stack of trophies, she seems to lose her balance, lurching forward before catching herself. She stands up quickly, fear and pride vying on her face. Will reaches for her elbow, but she jerks her arm away. “When I was your age. I mean, when I was that age”—she gestures at the trophies—“we didn&#39;t play sports. The boys played and we watched.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Didn&#39;t you like tennis?” Angela says.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;“That was later.” Her mother snatches a figure from the box. “Too late.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Multiple figures, actually. There are three girls on top of this trophy, arms around one another&#39;s shoulders. They look exactly the same: matching uniforms; featureless, indistinguishable faces. Their chests are gently rounded, one mound instead of two. The metal plaque below them says “Participation.” Pressing the trophy into Angela&#39;s hands, her mother repeats the story of her heroics: her outstretched glove, reaching, waiting. The crowd was full of mothers holding their breath.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Robbed!” she says for the second time.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The more Angela thinks about it—the climactic moment of the climactic game, the ball sailing toward her, its perfect, inevitable, downward arc—the truer it seems. Surely it happened to someone.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Will is struggling to close the box. The flaps keep springing open. Angela bends down to help him, because she&#39;s good at this—the box thing. Getting one end of the first flap under one end of the second flap at the same time that you get the other end of the first flap over the other end of the second flap. She can feel her mother watching her, but Angela keeps her eyes on the box. It&#39;s satisfying when they&#39;re finished, the flaps coerced into their flat, unnatural shape. It&#39;s easy to ignore what&#39;s inside.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Will shows her parents the retirement community online. They&#39;ve agreed to take baby steps: first the Web site, then—maybe—the tour. Will is the one who says baby steps. Angela says, Don&#39;t infantilize them.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The images flick by on the screen: the buffet line, a smiling receptionist, the pond with two gray ducks. Her father makes vague sounds of curiosity. Her mother sits very still, straight back and stony face.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Don&#39;t breathe in my ear,” she says.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Will schedules a tour. He puts the box of trophies on the curb while Angela&#39;s parents take a nap. (Angela didn&#39;t know they took naps.)&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;The tour begins in independent living, passes through assisted living by way of the pond, and concludes in the memory wing. A savvier guide, Angela thinks, would have reversed the route, turning inescapable decline into an illusion of defiance: life could end with your very own kitchenette, figure-drawing classes, bread crumbs tossed to the ducks, enough strength to stand up from a chair after you sit down.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;5t28j8&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;They have to stop a few times during the tour, sometimes right in the middle of the hall, so that her father can catch his breath. Angela&#39;s mother—still stony-faced, silent—ignores this, so Angela is the one to put her hand on his back. She feels the air go in and out of his lungs. His body expands and contracts.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;When the tour is over, they&#39;re invited to meet the residents in the dining room. There are crisp white tablecloths and brown plastic trays, windows that look onto the parking lot. Only four o&#39;clock, but dinner is being served.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Look,” Angela&#39;s mother says. “All the servers are women.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;There&#39;s an awkward pause, in which the tour guide surveys the room, as if in search of evidence to the contrary. But Angela&#39;s mother is right. The women are all ages, in matching button-down shirts and not quite invisible hairnets. A teen-ager with bad posture ladles soup, a middle-aged woman with a weak chin tosses salad. One of them seems old enough to live here herself. The tour group watches the women in silence for a moment, and then the guide—she, too, is a woman, not the youngest but certainly the prettiest—clears her throat and changes the subject. She assures them that the residents are all very impressive people: former artists, former teachers, former entrepreneurs. Will notes that Angela&#39;s father was an entrepreneur, too. He&#39;s using his most agreeable voice. The guide smiles gratefully at him, but Angela&#39;s father doesn&#39;t seem to have heard.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;While the rest of them wait their turn at the buffet, her mother stands by the windows, squinting out at the view. Angela accepts a bowl of soup. Up close, she can see that the teen-age server is wearing too much makeup: bright lips, caked-over pimples, eyelashes with an unnatural upward curl. Who is she wearing it &lt;em>;for&lt;/em>;? The question embarrasses Angela, even though she hasn&#39;t said it out loud—a question a mother would ask. She takes the soup to the window.&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;a data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/11/13/our-time-is-up-fiction-clare-sestanovich&amp;quot;}&quot;

Angela feels a little trapped.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;“It&#39;s not a reason at all,” she says. “It&#39;s just a desire.”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;yzlq73&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;She stares up at the ceiling, dark but getting less dark. Or no, the same amount of dark—she&#39;s just getting used to it. Will falls asleep before her, as he always does, snoring softly. He tosses and turns a lot, and this, too, has become routine. When he flings his arm across her chest, jostling one breast against the other, she doesn&#39;t really mind. Their bodies are blind and dumb. In the partial dark, in her dimming mind, for right now but possibly also forever, she is all alone. His arm slides down, pressing against her bladder, which makes her realize she needs to pee. The bathroom seems far away. She shakes her legs to loosen the sheets but doesn&#39;t get up.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;When she finally falls asleep, an ordinary dream turns into a sex dream. At the beginning of the dream, Angela is supervising some sort of field trip—a bunch of teen-agers packed onto a school bus. She&#39;s not the teacher, just the chaperon, and she&#39;s too afraid to enforce any of the rules. When a game of spin the bottle starts at the back of the bus, she pretends not to notice. The bus is met at its destination by a team of nurses in monochrome scrubs, who lead all the teen-agers into a building that looks exactly like the main building of the retirement community. Unlike Angela, the nurses are good at getting the kids to be quiet. “You have a lot to learn,” they say sternly—to the kids, or maybe to her.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The sex starts in the dining room, and, as in most of Angela&#39;s sex dreams, she is not the one having it. The room is crowded, old people and teen-agers all mixed together, chatting, helping themselves to seconds, eating off one another&#39;s plates without even bothering to ask. At some point, Angela realizes that they&#39;re naked. Is her mother in there? Watching from the far side of the buffet, holding a plate she hasn&#39;t yet filled, Angela is pretty sure that the young are having sex with the young and the old are having sex with the old, but the longer she watches the less certain she becomes; all the bodies, actually, seem to look the same. She doesn&#39;t look down at her own.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In the dream, she&#39;s a little afraid and a little turned on. When she wakes up—the room is its darkest dark again—she still is. Will is on his back, breath flapping through his mouth, arm over his head, as if he were waving to someone. Angela squeezes a hand between her thighs, to feel herself respond: the crackle of a not quite near-enough radio station, the creak of ice under the weight of a shoe. But she doesn&#39;t keep the hand there. It&#39;s the beginning of masturbating she likes, that first exploratory touch. To see if anything&#39;s there. The rest of it, the dutiful search, too often disappoints. Does she even know what she&#39;s looking for?&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Will rolls toward her, his open mouth beside her open ear. She presses gently under his chin and his jaw gives in easily. The noise stops. She stays awake for a while, the dream half dissolved, the static in her crotch half gone—that is, still there.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;When it&#39;s time to return to California, they still haven&#39;t decided anything. But they&#39;ve cleaned. Angela has swept, sponged, Dustbustered. She&#39;s sorted glass from plastic, plastic from cardboard. Her hands smell like rubber gloves.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Look how much more room there is,” she says, opening closet doors with a magician&#39;s flourish. The winter coats were moth-eaten. The prom dress is gone.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Room for what?” her mother asks.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;2bxpi&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;She wants to drive them to the airport. She wants to give them half a dozen ceramics. A soup bowl, a serving bowl, a mug. At least two egg cups. She&#39;ll pack them carefully. There&#39;s bubble wrap in the basement.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;“There isn&#39;t,” Angela says. “Not anymore.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In the end, they compromise: a taxi to the airport, just a mug. The one Angela chooses is slightly off balance—she pictures the wet clay wobbling, the momentum of the wheel briefly taking over—but she likes the color: blue that looks black, the deeper color visible only in a certain light.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“That one?” Her mother laughs. Maybe the laugh means, I knew you would choose that one. Maybe it even means, I love you for choosing that one. Angela wraps the mug in several layers of underwear and stuffs it with a sock before putting it in her bag. She wonders if her mother will see it again.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;On the plane, Angela and Will are seated behind a baby who whimpers feebly from takeoff to landing. Would it be better, Angela asks, if he really, truly cried?&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Better for whom?” Will wants to know.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;It&#39;s only when they get home—the mail clogging the mail slot, the stale smell of rooms left by themselves—that they realize they&#39;ve missed their therapy appointment. Angela opens the windows and throws a softening onion in the trash. She imagines all the things they might have said to the therapist. Not the usual things: the careful criticisms, the qualified complaints, question after question. Is this normal? What&#39;s normal? They are almost forty. They still don&#39;t know. Haven&#39;t they always wanted to be exceptional?&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;No, instead of questions: confessions, accusations. It&#39;s a strange, sour sort of satisfaction to hear them in her head. She may be beautiful, but she is less beautiful than before. He calls her sexy because he wants sex. There are other people, you know, who want it, too. Sometimes makeup shows you still care. There&#39;s a woman at the office (eyeliner, earrings) who makes him feel—well, what? Desired? Empowered? Something other than agreeable. At what point should they agree to disagree?&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Will is already unpacking his bag, because the longer you wait the harder it gets. Angela unzips her suitcase and removes the ceramic mug. She holds it up to the light, tilting it until black reveals blue. The blue of water under the surface or blood under the skin. Then she tilts her hand a little farther and the handle breaks off the cup. Or is it the other way around—the cup breaks off the handle? There&#39;s a crack and shards on the ground and Angela is left holding the pointless piece.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;For a moment, she just stares, unable to think of what to do next. But it isn&#39;t really a decision. She gets a broom from the closet and sweeps everything into a small, efficient pile. When she looks up, Will is watching her. She laughs, so he laughs, too. They don&#39;t really know what they&#39;re laughing at—what it means. Does her laugh sound like her mother&#39;s?&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The cup didn&#39;t break into that many pieces, actually: four big ones, each as sharp as a knife. But there are probably smaller ones she can&#39;t see; they can travel farther than you&#39;d think. Days from now, at the other end of the room, a tiny, blue-black shard might pierce the sole of her bare foot and make her call out—the pain of surprise, which can also be pleasure. Angela looks at Will and her vision briefly blurs. She won&#39;t find the pieces now, but she might later, when she&#39;s stopped looking, when she&#39;s bending down to pick up some other delicate thing that&#39;s slipped from her hand. ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 06 Nov 2023 20:06:01 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Reinventing the Dinosaur]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/11/13/dinosaurs-life-on-earth-netflix-series]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-06T11:00:00.000Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65454215f7a240dd4220b5ec/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/231113_r43343_rd.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;article >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attribute-verso-pattern=&quot;article-body&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;ArticlePageChunks&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;figure data-testid=&quot;IframeEmbed&quot; >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;IframeEmbedContainer&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;iframe height=&quot;90&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; sandbox=&quot;allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups&quot; title=&quot;Embedded Frame&quot; src=&quot;https://audm.herokuapp.com/player-embed?pub=newyorker&amp;amp;articleID=65426891c9c56d56b2a0bc85&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay *; encrypted-media *; clipboard-write; autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture&quot;>;&lt;/iframe>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;p >;Dan Tapster grew up watching David Attenborough&#39;s nature documentaries with his mother, in a village outside London. “It was appointment viewing,” he said. “She still claims to be Attenborough&#39;s No. 1 fan.” A few years after graduating from university with a biology degree, and following a stint leading nature tours in Peru, Tapster found himself working on Attenborough&#39;s films, first “The Life of Mammals” and later “Planet Earth.” Attenborough&#39;s documentaries are celebrated for their exceptional footage, often of little-known species or of rarely filmed behaviors: the kodkod of Patagonia, the swarming of red-billed queleas over the African savannah, the dark-of-night hunts (captured with infrared cameras) of big cats. In a sense, viewers get to see what they cannot actually see.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Once, Tapster and a colleague were filming pygmy marmosets (palm-size monkeys with lion-like manes) in the rain forests of Ecuador when they were kidnapped by a group of Huaorani women, who thought they&#39;d be a valuable bargaining tool in their conflict with the local government. “It sounds so dramatic, but then the story gets less exciting, because they were very nice, and fed us and gave us a comfortable place to sleep,” Tapster told me. Nonetheless, after a couple of days the two men fled by canoe at night, paddling to a nearby town. But now they faced another problem: until they could get transportation out, two days later, they had nothing to do. “I tried to read the one book I had as slowly as possible,” Tapster said. Then he decided to flip a coin a thousand times and record the outcomes, to see if it was in fact true that the coin would land on heads half the time. “It was four hundred and ninety-nine,” he said, recalling that he was devastated that it wasn&#39;t five hundred. That level of devotion to verification has served him well in the making of “Life on Our Planet,” an eight-episode Netflix documentary, for which Tapster, forty-seven, is a writer and a showrunner.&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;This drive to verify is essential, because “Life on Our Planet” spans four billion years and includes sixty-five extinct creatures. It is perhaps the most ambitious nature documentary ever made. Extraordinary footage of animals living today reveals, through persistent traits, the way the past is still present; long-lost creatures are rendered with such accuracy and vividness that they have never seemed more alive. The extinct creatures, made using CGI, are placed in footage of contemporary landscapes. “Paleobotanically, it&#39;s pretty accurate,” Tom Fletcher, a paleontologist from Bristol, England, and the senior scientific researcher for the show, told me. In choosing sites to film, “our biggest problem was grass,” Fletcher said. Though grass has been around since the late Cretaceous period, it&#39;s only been widespread for about twenty-five million years. Ferns, conifers—those were sufficiently ancient.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Fletcher was tasked with putting together a fact file for every extinct creature, one that detailed what is known about each species, inside and out, and its behavior, so that artists at Industrial Light &amp;amp; Magic, the visual-effects company founded by George Lucas in 1975, could bring them to life. Some of the CGI dinosaurs&#39; steps follow the precise pattern of documented trackways (also known as dinosaur footprints). Biomechanical studies offer persuasive estimates of bite force, fossilized feces give evidence of ancient diets, and cross-sections of fossilized bone suggest how slowly or quickly an animal grew. From the assembled clues, the ILM artists imagined into being Plateosauruses and woolly mammoths and Theosodons.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Animals and plants alive today, especially those which in some way embody key moments in the story of life—the advent of flight, or of flowering, or of caring for one&#39;s young—are also seen in new ways. (There&#39;s never-before-recorded footage of how “nurse” Megaponera ants take care of injured ants by applying a liquid from their bodies that contains antibiotics.) This mixture of extinct and living creatures poses an aesthetic problem: the Megacerops and gorgonopsids and two-metre-long millipedes need to appear as realistic as present-day dragonflies, snow leopards, and hummingbirds. Visual effects can make Spider-Man and Iron Man appear to battle Thanos, but the challenge of accuracy shifts when the conjured creatures once really lived. Some of the vivid colors of species we know—flamingos, giraffes—wouldn&#39;t seem plausible in an extinct animal. Tapster said, “We tried slow-motion footage of an Allosaurus running at you, to make it terrifying”—a familiar move in footage of predators such as cheetahs. “But it was more credible in real time.”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;0hxp6&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;A trope in narrating the lives of artists is their art being so good that it can&#39;t be distinguished from nature. The fifth-century-BCE Greek painter Zeuxis is said to have painted grapes that were so realistic that birds came down to peck at them. A lamb painted by Titian was said to have prompted the bleating of a mother ewe; after Titian completed his portrait of Pope Leo X, a cardinal supposedly tried to hand the figure a pen, to sign a document. When watching “Life on Our Planet,” I experienced that idea from the other side: the filmed footage of Komodo dragons hunting their own young appeared more fantastical to me than the CGI footage of a Dunkleosteus—a predatory fish of the late Devonian period that was among the first to evolve a jaw—hunting an ammonite, an ancient hard-shelled little creature. “Life on Our Planet” does as much to reveal the extraordinary and alien nature of the animals we currently share the world with as it does to make familiar the extinct ones. These upside-down moments make extinction itself more vivid, more legible. Morgan Freeman, the series&#39; narrator, tells viewers early on that ninety-nine per cent of all species that have ever lived are now extinct—a fact whose contours are unfathomable. The story of life, one begins to realize, is also the story of five mass extinctions, and of the scrappy return of a fraction of the Earth&#39;s life-forms following each one.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Dreaming up a beast from fossil clues is not a new practice. You&#39;re out on a walk in 1600, or 600, or earlier. You come across an enormous skull, with a large hole in front. What could it be? Some scholars hypothesize that the Cyclops&#39; single eye, as described in the Odyssey, was inspired by the skull of a Deinotherium, a long-extinct creature with a trunk like an elephant&#39;s that emerged from an opening in the front of its skull.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In the seventeenth century, Robert Plot, a naturalist and the first keeper of the Ashmolean Museum, at Oxford, described a fossil from Switzerland as appearing to be the thigh bone of a very large creature—perhaps, he speculated, one of the elephants that Romans rode when they conquered Britannia. Almost a hundred years later, Richard Brookes, an English physician, reconsidered Plot&#39;s detailed drawing of the fossil and gave it a scientific name that matched what he believed it was: &lt;em>;Scrotum humanum&lt;/em>;, the scrotum of a giant human-like creature. Decades after that, William Buckland, a naturalist, looked at the fossil and other bones found in the area and concluded that they were more likely from a giant lizard, which he named Megalosaurus—a name that is still in use today.&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot;

If we want to know about the life that is no longer with us, fossils are the clues. “That&#39;s why paleontology is the best—it&#39;s the ultimate cold case.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;In the Western world, until the eighteenth century fossils were generally thought to belong to animals that still existed—just elsewhere. Thomas Jefferson, who was nicknamed Mr. Mammoth for his interest in fossils, instructed Lewis and Clark to keep an eye out for mastodons on their journey to the Pacific. This idea soon shifted, however. In 1808, the French anatomist Georges Cuvier was shown the fossilized remains of a forty-foot-long sea monster which had been found deep in a chalk quarry in Holland; he argued that it was a creature no longer living anywhere on Earth. Extinction was a wild idea for Europeans and Americans, the Great Flood notwithstanding.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;In the United States, the late-nineteenth-century “bone wars” gave paleontology the reputation of being a bit of a yahoo sport, with rich and richer men competing to acquire more fossils and name more creatures. Paleontology came to be seen as, well, a bit childish; perhaps relatedly, dinosaurs were often seen as dim and lumbering reptiles. But we owe much of our understanding of not just extinct animals but the history of the Earth to paleontology. Many paleontologists today date the “dinosaur renaissance” to John Ostrom, of Yale, who in a 1963 paper argued that hadrosaurs ran quickly and upright, and whose subsequent finding of a Deinonychus (“terrible claw”) fossil, in 1964, led him to assert that this large-brained dinosaur had been agile, smart, and a pack hunter; research by his student Robert Bakker strengthened nascent ideas that dinosaurs had been plausibly warm-blooded, and more like modern birds than like reptiles. Soon, the US went from having around a dozen paleontologists to having thousands. In the past few decades, paleontology has arguably advanced as dramatically as biotech or cat memes. One large step forward came in the nineteen-eighties, when the geologist Walter Alvarez and his father, the physicist Luis Alvarez, put forth the idea that an asteroid strike had caused the death of the majority of non-avian dinosaurs. Even that now basic-seeming idea is younger than Laura Dern, who played a paleobotanist in “Jurassic Park.”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;7vma1&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;A field that was once mostly men in hats going on digs in the Black Hills or Hell Creek is now one that combines geology, botany, chemistry, and biomechanical engineering. The slow-witted yet still somehow terrifying dinosaurs of yesteryear are gone, and it&#39;s now not necessarily even dinosaurs that paleontologists study—there are so many other creatures, though the term “dinosaur” tends to be used by the public to mean most anything ancient, strange, or frightening.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The shifting story of the Oviraptor captures something of the changes in paleontology. In 1923, an expedition to the Gobi Desert discovered dinosaur eggs, which were presumed to have belonged to Protoceratops, as there were many Protoceratops fossils nearby. A seemingly different species was found on top of a clutch of eggs, and was named Oviraptor—the egg stealer. It appeared to be a fossilized crime scene. In 1993, scientists were again searching for fossils in the Gobi when they found a similar egg, this one with a preserved embryo inside—that of an Oviraptor. The egg stealer was in fact a protective, nesting parent.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I went with my daughter to the American Museum of Natural History to see the titanosaur exhibit, which opened in 2016. The titanosaur is a hundred and twenty-two feet long, and when it was first mounted at the museum its discovery was so new that it hadn&#39;t yet been formally named. It was posed impishly, with part of its long neck and its head peeking beyond the entrance of the display hall. Museums are where most people first encounter a three-dimensional fossilized dinosaur skeleton, or a cast or a replica of one, and museum displays, across the decades, themselves become museum pieces illustrating how the story of ancient history used to be told.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In 1915, the American Museum of Natural History mounted specimen AMNH 5027, a ferocious-looking dinosaur. About forty-five per cent of its skeleton had been found, including a marvellously intact skull. The missing parts were constructed using educated guesses, based on known relatives. (A lot of dinosaurs, even today, are known from only one specimen, or two or three partial skeletons.) Henry Fairfield Osborn, then the president of the museum, had named the specimen &lt;em>;Tyrannosaurus rex&lt;/em>;, the tyrant lizard king. (The &lt;em>;Times&lt;/em>;, reporting on the fossil&#39;s discovery, wrote that it was more than eight million years old; the Los Angeles &lt;em>;Times&lt;/em>; said that the specimen was three million years old; it is estimated today to be sixty-six to sixty-nine million years old.) Osborn thought that the animal was pretty athletic, and he wanted to mount it in a dynamic way, showing two &lt;em>;T. rexes&lt;/em>; in a standoff over a fallen hadrosaur. But the pose was too much of an engineering challenge—it would have required numerous metal girders. Osborn then wanted the &lt;em>;T. rex&lt;/em>; to be as tall as possible, twenty feet high—but there was a beam in the way. Eventually, the &lt;em>;T. rex&lt;/em>; stood eighteen feet high, posed in that classic tail-down upright stance of our collective dinosaur imagination. It was the first dinosaur-fossil display of its kind, and for many years the only one, and it was seen by millions of people a year.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;gwxtok&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;The original mount had three claws on each of those curiously short front arms; when paleontologists concluded that the &lt;em>;T. rex&lt;/em>; had only two claws, one was plucked off each arm. In the early nineteen-nineties, more changes were made. The pose was altered. Its head and neck were lowered, so that it now looks more like a magnificent, giant, running chicken. Today, the &lt;em>;T. rex&lt;/em>; stands only twelve feet above the ground at its highest point.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;By one estimate, a new extinct species is discovered nearly every week. In part out of nostalgia for elementary-school trips to what was nicknamed the “dinosaur museum”—now the Sam Noble Museum of Natural History, in Norman, Oklahoma—I called up a curator, Jacqueline Lungmus. She thought that she would become a veterinarian until, she said, “I realized I didn&#39;t like soft-tissue anatomy.” She is part of the new generation of paleontologists; she received her Ph.D. from the University of Chicago in 2020. She said that, in her eyes, a superbloom in paleontological knowledge occurred “in the nineties, with histology, the study of microscopic tissue.” By cutting open bones and looking at them through a microscope, scientists “could figure out how fast-growing a creature was, how long-living it was,” she said. “This revolutionized how we thought about their life histories.” The rapid growth of dinosaurs suggested that they were warm-blooded, because cold-blooded reptiles necessarily grow more slowly. Though there is a long history of connecting birds to dinosaurs, the link only recently began to be seen as scientific fact (by most experts), and to make its way into the popular imagination.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The paleontologist Gregory Erickson, a professor at Florida State University, tells the thousands of students in his course Living with Dinosaurs: The Rise, Reign, and “Demise” of the Fearfully Great Reptiles to recognize that they live in Jurassic Park, with eleven thousand species of dinosaurs—birds—around them. “I think we looked at them as dead animals for a long time, but now see them as formerly living animals,” Erickson said, of dinosaurs. With that shift in perspective comes more interest in behavior. As an example, he spoke about how some dinosaurs are now understood to most likely have been “gregarious”—a term that refers to living in social groups. “We&#39;ll find cases where we have trackways of sometimes hundreds of skeletons that died at the same time,” Erickson said. Reptiles are rarely gregarious; birds almost always are. “You don&#39;t see, like, two hundred lizards crossing the street.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Most of us have few ideas about what a Dunkleosteus or a gorgonopsid or a terror bird might have looked like, or of how they might have behaved—but paleontologists now have plenty. Early in the making of “Life on Our Planet,” while thinking about how to depict animals whose appearances and behaviors would have to be deduced from an increasing but still mysterious set of fossil clues, the creators invited scientific consultants from Yale, Bristol University, and the University of London to the London office of ILM “We started with &#39;King Kong,&#39; ”—in which the protagonist fights a &lt;em>;T. rex&lt;/em>;—“and went on forward, through to &#39;Jurassic Park,&#39; to &#39;Walking with Dinosaurs,&#39; ” Tapster said. The experts were asked to share what they thought about the different depictions of dinosaurs. I asked if the scientists liked any of them. Tapster laughed: “Mostly it was no, no, no.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Even within the scientific community, there are often profound disagreements about how to interpret the fossil record. &lt;em>;T. rex&lt;/em>;, one of the dinosaurs about which the most is known, is a great example of this. Some scientists say that it moved like a roadrunner from Hell (a moniker first used by Robert Bakker), but others argue that &lt;em>;T. rex&#39;s&lt;/em>; legs would not have been able to bear the body&#39;s enormous weight while running. Some say &lt;em>;T. rex&lt;/em>; was mostly a hunter, and others assure you that it was really a scavenger. Some say that the king of the dinosaurs was covered with feathers, and others that only the young had feathers, or that, among adults, probably only the males had a few decorative feathers. My generation, for the most part, can&#39;t picture &lt;em>;T. rex&lt;/em>; with any feathers at all. “One thing I learned at that conference was the damned-if-you-do, damned-if-you-don&#39;t concept,” Tapster said. Among the few details that the scientists agreed on was that dinosaurs shouldn&#39;t look “shrink-wrapped.” Tapster explained, “Dinosaurs in films are often very muscly, as if they&#39;ve just come from the gym. Except for human bodybuilders, animals don&#39;t look like that.” Fletcher, the scientific consultant, said, “We decided the &lt;em>;T. rexes&lt;/em>; needed to be . 。 。 hefty. To have those chunky legs.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;How do you tell a story that spans four billion years? Estimating that there are eight million or so species alive today, and nearly a hundred times more across time, and also the companion stories of the evolution of plants, and eight episodes, each of them less than an hour—the math just gets silly. “We had two geologists in the basement—they really were in the basement—giving us information about the planet&#39;s history,” Tapster said. Then the writers had to solve the challenge of making unfathomable scales of time and change feel intelligible, at least a bit. “We used Post-it notes in five different colors,” Tapster said. “I know . 。 。 Post-it notes.” One color for prehistoric creatures with an important story to tell—learning to swim, or eggs that can survive out of water. Another color for prehistoric creatures that are iconic—viewers need their dinosaurs. A third for modern-day animals in which exceptional evolutionary traits are apparent. A fourth for key events on Earth. And a fifth for potential cliffhanger moments. Then the team would discuss what would be included and what wouldn&#39;t make the cut.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Tapster said, “One of our researchers, Ida-May Jones, kept pushing for Lystrosaurus,” a proto-mammal that she found very cute. “We were, like, It has to be more than just cute.” The Lystrosaurus was herbivorous, about the size of a pig, with small tusks and a kind of beak. Because its front legs are so much stronger than its back legs, it is believed to have dug and lived in burrows. It existed both before the Permian extinction (in relatively small numbers) and then also after—it survived. “She brought it up again, she had really fallen for it, but what essential story was it telling?” Tapster said. Then Jones uncovered an unexpected detail about Lystrosaurus: at one point, after the Permian extinction, the species represented seventy-five per cent of all the vertebrates on Earth. It was, briefly, king. “So Lystrosaurus made it in,” Tapster said. A startled Lystrosaurus in its burrow appears early in Episode 4.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Tapster and his writing team also wanted the show to highlight less well-known aspects of the history of life on Earth: creatures other than dinosaurs, the mesmerizing progression of plant life, momentous environmental events. “I remember getting the note of &#39;So you&#39;re beginning Episode 2 with plankton? And Episode 3 with lichen?&#39; ” Tapster said. But who knew (other than paleontologists) that there was a time in Earth&#39;s history when it rained for a million years? Or about the forty million years when moss dominated the planet? Or about how plankton, by inventing photosynthesis and thereby giving off oxygen in the course of some two billion years, transformed Earth&#39;s yellow methane-filled atmosphere into blue skies, and the lifeless landscape into forests of green? In William Steig&#39;s book “Rotten Island,” illustrations show erupting volcanoes and creepy sea creatures and thorny plants and vicious land animals. One day, a jealous battle starts over a new life-form: a flower. Violence, destruction, giant insects, and ice and fire ensue, and lead to a mass extinction. I used to think that “Rotten Island” was about the disastrous pettiness of human wants and behaviors, and about how much better life might be without us. Now I see it as a reasonably accurate visual history of our planet, with extra polka dots and stripes, in watercolor.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Even if you haven&#39;t visited it in person, there&#39;s a good chance you&#39;ve seen Cheatham Grove. An ecological park in Northern California, it&#39;s where the famous chase scene in “Return of the Jedi” was filmed. Walking a few minutes with Tapster and Fletcher along a trail strewn with redwood needles, and sheltered by trees several hundred feet tall, I met Jonathan Privett, the visual-effects supervisor from Industrial Light &amp;amp; Magic; Jolyon Sutcliffe, a producer and a director with an extensive background in natural-history documentaries; and Katy Fraser, a camera operator whose additional skills as a deep-sea diver were essential for many of “Life on Our Planet” &#39;s underwater scenes. They were snacking on grapes and chatting while waiting for the sun to come out from behind the clouds, so that they could shoot footage that would match that of previous days. “Nature documentary is often hours and hours of waiting and then a few moments of intensity,” Sutcliffe told me. He had stayed up for many nights in the Sonoran Desert to capture the moment when a kangaroo rat leaps out to karate kick an attacking rattlesnake in midair; he had sat for hours waiting for the tiny scuffle of dust that signifies a trapdoor spider popping out from its burrow to seize its prey. During the pandemic, he spent weeks filming lichen growing; thousands of those images had to be “stacked” for the sequence in “Life on Our Planet” that shows lichen spreading across the land.&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;a data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/11/13/dinosaurs-life-on-earth-netflix-series&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/11/13/dinosaurs-life-on-earth-netflix-series&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;“How about if tonight you pretend to be someone else I need to practice my social skills.”&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/65454231706f085d0e21bd24/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/231113_a27085.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/65454231706f085d0e21bd24/master/w_120,c_limit/231113_a27085.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/65454231706f085d0e21bd24/master/w_240,c_limit/231113_a27085.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/65454231706f085d0e21bd24/master/w_320,c_limit/231113_a27085.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/65454231706f085d0e21bd24/master/w_640,c_limit/231113_a27085.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/65454231706f085d0e21bd24/master/w_960,c_limit/231113_a27085.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/65454231706f085d0e21bd24/master/w_1280,c_limit/231113_a27085.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/65454231706f085d0e21bd24/master/w_1600,c_limit/231113_a27085.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/a>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;“How about if tonight you pretend to be someone else?

He showed me on a laptop the method he and other ILM artists use to build a creature. “It&#39;s like making a real puppet,” he said. He pulled up files on Anchiornis. “We first build the skeleton. The audience never sees the skeleton, but, if you get that right, a lot follows.” The skeleton could be animated, “and, see, we realized the wings couldn&#39;t fold completely away, like a pigeon&#39;s”—so Anchiornis, with his wings only partially tucked in, looks a bit like he&#39;s wearing a cape. “And then we can add the muscles, then the skin—it&#39;s like a sculpture.” Some remarkably intact Anchiornis specimens have been found, so there&#39;s a lot of information to work with. “Then we add the feathers.” In recent years, scientists have even deduced the color of the species&#39; feathers, by a microscopic examination of melanosomes, a kind of pigment cell. Parameters can be put in for how stiff the various feathers are, and for how many barbs they have. “It&#39;s the same with fur—you can decide how clumpy it is,” he added. Wind and turbulence variables can be added, too. Privett went on, “He doesn&#39;t fly so much. It&#39;s more like what Buzz Lightyear says: he falls with style. He&#39;s sort of part bird, part flying squirrel.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Privett&#39;s background is in mechanical engineering. After graduating from college, in 1991, he took a job in Detroit modelling cars with software that was new at the time. The software allowed car designers to work digitally, instead of having to build a model by hand. Soon, Privett was offered a position at a visual-effects company, and he has spent more than twenty years doing work he would never have foreseen, and that he loves. “This is kind of embarrassing, but I was never a fiction person—I read the dictionary and the encyclopedia,” he told me. The scientific information that went into building creatures naturally appealed to him, even though “it&#39;s a leap of faith, too,” he said. Fur and feathers are the toughest. “The snow blowing through the woolly mammoth&#39;s fur—that was a lot of work,” he said, with a little shudder.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Tom Fletcher&#39;s Ph.D. was on the hydrodynamics of ancient fish and sharks, and he lights up when talking about geologic formations, fossilized skin impressions, the movement patterns of early amphibians. In becoming a paleontologist, Fletcher, who&#39;s thirty-six, didn&#39;t so much follow his dreams as follow his fears. “The room of dioramas of dinosaurs in the natural-history museum in Liverpool—they&#39;re outdated now, but it looked like a sinister aquarium with ichthyosaurs and giant squids, and I would have nightmares about them,” he said. “They were terrifying, but also awesome.” His parents sometimes drove him to the coast, where he searched for fossils, deciding pretty early on that that was what he wanted to do with his life.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;One of Fletcher&#39;s jobs in “Life on Our Planet” was to give feedback on each draft of extinct creatures. Once ILM artists had visuals, they would send a collection of images, almost always including one of the creature posed next to a fountain topped with a statue of Yoda which sits in front of ILM&#39;s San Francisco office. Revisions would then be suggested, to improve on both the “feel” of what Tapster and others thought would work best artistically and, for Fletcher, the scientific accuracy. A producer might want to put something “characterful” on a creature, such as a crest, and Fletcher would have to explain that, owing to fossil evidence, it wasn&#39;t possible. “Pretty much all the accuracy changes suggested we were into—but there was disappointment about having to put lips on the &lt;em>;Tyrannosaurus rex&lt;/em>;,” Tapster said. Lips are likely rare on the &lt;em>;T. rexes&lt;/em>; of the popular imagination. “But the science was pretty strong,” Fletcher said. With &lt;em>;T. rex&#39;s&lt;/em>; feathers, there was disagreement among experts about how many there would have been. An early draft of the &lt;em>;T. rex&lt;/em>; “looked like he had a mullet and was headed to a Metallica concert,” Tapster said. “We asked them to pluck some of the feathers.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;More often, Tapster said, ILM saved the show from mistaking an inexact science for an exact one—from failing to take advantage of the special insights of art. He gave the example of the terror bird, a ten-foot-tall apex predator that lived after the dinosaurs. In “Life on Our Planet,” we see one terror bird in a territorial dispute, and another as it hunts a group of cute llama-like creatures. There is limited fossil evidence of the terror bird, so in designing one the production team tried to Frankenstein it from modern-day descendants. “We said to ILM to give it the legs of a secretary bird and the beak of its closest living relative, a seriema,” a much smaller leggy bird that often sports a bright beak with a fanciful plume at its base. What resulted “looked like a giant chicken with lipstick,” Tapster said. They asked the artists to come up with a version that looked like it belonged in the sandy landscape and was suitably terrifying—as per the ambush predator&#39;s name. They “came up with something so much better,” Tapster said. The terror bird now looks more like an ostrich on steroids, but with a killer hooked beak.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;So many astounding creatures now gone! One theme across the episodes is that of the dominant species not surviving the next extinction; it tends to be the smaller, more adaptable ones that make it to the far side. Another through line is that of chance: not only how a random mutation can end up being useful to a creature&#39;s survival but also, for example, the chance arrival of the dinosaur-killing asteroid. On our drive back to San Francisco from Cheatham Grove, Tapster said, “That meteorite is thought to have been stuck in the asteroid belt, before maybe a collision kicked it out onto its thirty-five-million-year trajectory to crash into Earth.” The precise place where the asteroid hit exacerbated the calamity: it landed in an area full of gypsum, which vaporizes into sulfur, which in turn blocks sunlight. “If that journey had ended two hours earlier, or two hours later”—so that its impact was elsewhere—“that would have made a difference.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Italo Calvino&#39;s short story “The Dinosaurs,” from 1965, is narrated by a dinosaur that has survived the extinction. Feeling himself to be the last of his kind, he&#39;s lonely. He joins a community of New Ones, who don&#39;t recognize him as a dinosaur, or really know anything about dinosaurs, but who tell frightening stories about them. The New Ones&#39; fear changes to over-the-top admiration, then eventually to telling stories of dinosaurs that position them as laughable, as “terrible monsters” playing “ridiculous roles.” They use stories of dinosaurs, unknowingly, for their own shifting emotional and psychological ends. Late in the story, after a dinosaur fossil is found by the New Ones, the dinosaur sees “everything we had been and were no longer, our majesty, our faults, our ruin.” When the New Ones move on to “the idea of the Dinosaurs” as “bound to the idea of a sad end,” he gets fed up, and leaves. Calvino&#39;s story, written when the extinction of the dinosaurs was still a mystery, now reads as a parable about our own possible extinction, even as its causes are not cloaked but visible.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;We are the New Ones now, telling a shifting set of stories, often heedless of their accuracy. The dramatizations of the extinctions in “Life on Our Planet” were difficult to watch, though they were, in a way, magnificent. As sea life froze, or suffocated, or the land transformed into an oven, I admit that I often turned away, as it looked all too real. ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 06 Nov 2023 20:06:01 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
