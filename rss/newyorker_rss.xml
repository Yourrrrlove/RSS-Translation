data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;当日本观众欣赏普契尼的《蝴蝶夫人》时——意大利式的华丽表演，讲述艺伎对美国人注定的爱情海军军官——他们觉得这难以置信、侮辱性的，而且非常滑稽。 1925 年，即这部歌剧首演二十年后，《日本时报》报道称，当观众欣赏外国巡演剧团的姿态时，“爆发出阵阵开怀大笑”。普契尼引用日本流行歌曲的习惯并没有帮助解决问题。正如阿瑟·格鲁斯（Arthur Groos）在一本关于该歌剧的日本来源和接受情况的新书《蝴蝶夫人/巴塔福莱》中指出的那样，作曲家忽略了有关如何正确使用其素材的建议。当蝴蝶的女仆铃木在一座所谓的佛教圣地祈祷时，她会唱着歌颂黄瓜和茄子的歌曲《高井山》。此外，她还混淆了神道教诸神的名字，这些神本来就不属于佛教背景。格鲁斯写道，这类似于“天主教徒在烛台前向亚当和夏娃祈祷。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;尽管如此，日本观众和艺术家仍然继续与《蝴蝶》互动，尤其是因为它影响了几代西方人对日本的看法。五十年代，总部位于东京的藤原歌剧院与纽约市歌剧院合作制作了一部双语作品：日本歌手扮演日本人的角色，白人歌手扮演冷酷无情的平克顿中尉和更有同情心的领事夏普莱斯。 1953 年的音乐剧《Chōchō-san Sandaiki》（“三代蝴蝶”）将普契尼的人物和音乐编织成盟军占领下的日本的故事；这部歌剧以长崎为背景，这一事实为重述增添了一层令人震惊的意义。学者吉原真理 (Mari Yoshihara) 在 2004 年一篇有关日本女高音先锋歌手三浦玉木 (Tamaki Miura) 的文章中指出，这位歌手挑战了国内对女性气质的狭隘观念。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;今天，随着美国歌剧界的发展重新应对剧目中的政治包袱，新一波的“蝴蝶”作品即将到来，东亚血统的人在创意团队中占据主导地位。宫本阿蒙、梅泽咏叹调和陈菲尔最近分别在旧金山歌剧院、新奥尔良歌剧院和波士顿抒情歌剧院执导了这部作品。本月早些时候，我在底特律歌剧院观看了马修·小泽 (Matthew Ozawa) 的舞台表演，其中的故事被描述为一个沉迷于动漫图像和 VR 技术的现代美国人日益不安的幻想。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;一些歌剧爱好者会认为不可避免地会抗议不应将《蝴蝶》作为当时无辜的艺术品置之不理。然而，一部深入探讨十九世纪末性殖民主义并讽刺性地运用了《星条旗永不落》的作品却不能脱离其政治色彩。正如格鲁斯和其他学者所指出的，《蝴蝶》，尤其是其原版，具有反帝国主义的倾向；平克顿假装与蝴蝶结婚，然后又抛弃了她，这是对文化傲慢的毁灭性讽刺。 1904 年，这部歌剧在斯卡拉歌剧院首演不成功后，普契尼软化了平克顿的角色，但仍保留了足够的最初想法供导演们执行。就蝴蝶而言，她可能受到东方主义刻板印象的束缚，但她从普契尼为她创作的华丽音乐中汲取了力量。 《蝴蝶》在某些方面是怪诞的，但在其他方面却是伟大的，它不仅邀请表演者和观众进行反思，而且要求他们进行反思。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;小泽在底特律的《蝴蝶》的开头，我们看到一个无聊的年轻人独自呆在他的公寓里，公寓里装饰着日本海报和小玩意。他从冰箱里拿出一瓶啤酒——毫无疑问是札幌啤酒或麒麟啤酒。你有一种在东京学习了一个学期、情感上封闭的商业兄弟的感觉。他坐到椅子上，拿起 VR 设备，此时他的现代世界变得非物质化了。身着盛装的人物走出冰箱；帝国套装向前滑动。当平克顿不在场景中时，扮演他的歌手经常徘徊在一边，在慵懒的恍惚状态中打手势和抽搐。&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;取景很巧妙，因为它补偿了歌剧对日本的错误观念。当神道名称被破坏时，或者当中国民歌凭空出现时，我们可以归咎于主角的混乱遐想。即使是普契尼在修改乐谱时最值得怀疑的选择——给平克顿一首充满悔恨的咏叹调——也可以被认为是演奏者化身的表演性自怜的痉挛。我仍然坚信，原版《蝴蝶》更胜一筹，在《蝴蝶》中，胆怯的平克顿偷偷溜走，而《星条旗永不落》在他身后不和谐地咆哮，这更胜一筹。 1993 年，纽约市歌剧院上演了这部作品，这改变了我对这部作品的看法。但我也认识到实际需要给男高音一些更令人满意的演唱。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;普契尼是一位害怕商业失败的主权艺术家，他对《蝴蝶》进行了几年的修改，逐渐放弃了他的初衷。挑衅性的初步构想。小泽放弃了后来的一些改动，基本上沿用了首映几个月后在布雷西亚上映的版本。最关键的区别在于第二幕咏叹调“Che tua madre”，其中蝴蝶在处理平克顿抛弃她的消息时想象着她和她的孩子多洛尔的未来。在布雷西亚版本中，和原版一样，她编织了一个胜利的场景，其中多洛尔被皇帝发现并提升到了很高的地位。普契尼后来插入了另一段更加催人泪下的文字，其中预言了她的自杀。最初的蝴蝶是一个更骄傲、更坚强的角色，更接近专横的托斯卡。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;所以她在底特律，是卡拉·桑的一个令人敬畏的化身。和许多东亚背景的女高音一样，孙正义一遍又一遍地演唱《蝴蝶》——就她而言，演唱了三百多次。她并没有陷入例行公事。她演绎的《Un bel dì》是一部成熟的心理剧，更多的是对平克顿回归的狂热幻觉，而不是充满希望的愿景。埃里克·泰勒（Eric Taylor）饰演平克顿（Pinkerton），他用全声抒情热情表达了角色对自己纠缠的欲望日益增长的不安。饰演夏普莱斯的尼蒙·福特和饰演铃木的克里斯汀·崔巧妙地驾驭了剧中的想象景观。音乐厅里的渡边谦翔带领大家进行了节奏自信、色彩鲜艳的表演。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;这部《蝴蝶》是我最喜欢的，它也曾在辛辛那提歌剧院演出，接下来还将在犹他歌剧院和匹兹堡歌剧院演出，是它对舞台画面的变幻，这些画面看起来既美丽又令人烦恼。小泽的合作者——被称为“点”的设计团体、服装设计师松岛舞子和灯光设计师中濑由纪·林克——用发光的灯笼、樱花等装饰了场景，但这些图像有一种俗气的、类似电脑生成的光芒。有时人物会冻结，灯光会闪烁，这表明幻想的顺利功能被破坏了。目前尚不清楚观众在多大程度上掌握了解构议程；中场休息时我听到了混乱的嘀咕声。不过，结束画面所传达的信息应该是明确无误的。蝴蝶刺伤自己后，平克顿冲上舞台并抓住了她，但当她大步走开时，却只剩下抱着她血淋淋的衣服。在最后令人震惊的三重和弦处，她用冰冷的目光注视着观众。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;有很多天，我想念旧的城市歌剧院。它让观众喜爱的作品重新焕发活力，比如《蝴蝶》，而《蝴蝶》在大都会博物馆里仍然是成堆的小摆设。它在美国歌手身上冒险，而不是在时差的欧洲明星身上飞行。它的特色是大公司在几十年后才发现的新作品。大都会艺术博物馆以 Jake Heggie 的《Dead Man Walking》拉开了本季的序幕；城市歌剧院于 2002 年上演了这部作品，由年轻的乔伊斯·迪多纳托 (Joyce DiDonato) 领衔主演。安东尼·戴维斯 (Anthony Davis) 的《X：马尔科姆·X 的一生与时代》(X: The Life and Times of Malcolm X) 将于 11 月上映，该剧于 1986 年在城市歌剧院 (City Opera) 进行了世界首演。如果大都会歌剧院在过去的城市歌剧院演出季中寻找更多灵感，可能会考虑伯恩德·阿洛伊斯·齐默尔曼 (Bernd Alois Zimmermann) 的《 《士兵之死》(1991)、埃里希·沃尔夫冈·科恩戈尔德的《死亡之城》(1975) 和阿尔贝托·吉纳斯特拉的《唐·罗德里戈》(1966)。或者它可以提出新的想法。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;去年底特律歌剧院重演的《X》是一部随着时间的推移影响力不断加深的重要作品。 《死囚行走》根据海伦·普雷让修女讲述她与一名死囚的友谊而改编，在回到纽约后给人留下了较淡的印象。这是一部非常受欢迎的作品，已在全球七十多家公司上演过。但配乐是衍生性的、推论性的，是对故事的反应，而不是驱动故事。在大都会艺术博物馆，这部歌剧感觉就像一部放大到宽银幕尺寸的本周电影。在 Yannick Nézet-Séguin 过度热切的指挥下，疯狂而响亮的管弦乐演奏只会放大音乐的局限性。迪多纳托（DiDonato）再次扮演海伦修女，瑞安·麦金尼（Ryan McKinny）扮演囚犯，声音安全，戏剧性敏锐。伊沃·范霍夫 (Ivo van Hove) 的制作通过视频技巧和冷酷无情的场景布景削弱了他们的实力。行刑场面栩栩如生，但死刑的野蛮政治仍然是抽象的。奇怪的是，底特律的《蝴蝶》似乎更符合当下的情况：它暗示了虚拟世界如何感染和贬低现实世界，将我们变成别人幻想的囚徒。 ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot;

It was November, 2017, and my family had just moved into our house in Princeton. The trees were shedding their leaves, in a theatrical manner that was new to us—we had relocated from California to the East Coast four months earlier.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“There are some roses,” Brigid said. “Those look like lilies.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“And those are hostas.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;There were six or seven rose bushes, with residual flowers, fuchsia-colored, shivering on top of the near-leafless branches. Lilies and hostas, their leaves already paled and half rotted by the cold autumn rain, remained recognizable. The rest of the garden was a wilted mystery, buried under fallen leaves.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I was not a character, but I was speaking like one for a reason: I was pondering a set of characters. I went on and told Brigid about a moment in “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Saga-Century-Trilogy-Fountain-Overflows-ebook/dp/B0090WRZYS/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1D21Z2MNESIPN&amp;amp;keywords=The%20Saga%20of%20the%20Century%20rebecca%20west&amp;amp;qid=1697748370&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;sprefix=the%20saga%20of%20the%20century%20rebecca%20wes,stripbooks,96&amp;amp;sr=1-1&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Saga-Century-Trilogy-Fountain-Overflows-ebook/dp/B0090WRZYS/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1D21Z2MNESIPN&amp;amp;keywords=The%20Saga%20of%20the%20Century%20rebecca%20west&amp;amp;qid=1697748370&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;sprefix=the%20saga%20of%20the%20century%20rebecca%20wes,stripbooks,96&amp;amp;sr=1-1&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Saga-Century-Trilogy-Fountain-Overflows-ebook/dp/B0090WRZYS/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1D21Z2MNESIPN&amp;amp;keywords=The%20Saga%20of%20the%20Century%20rebecca%20west&amp;amp;qid=1697748370&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;sprefix=the%20saga%20of%20the%20century%20rebecca%20wes,stripbooks,96&amp;amp;sr=1-1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;The Saga of the Century Trilogy&lt;/a>;,” by Rebecca West, about a British family living in London in the first half of the twentieth century. The eldest daughter in the family, Cordelia, newly wed, has moved into a pretty house in Kensington; when she has her two younger sisters over for a visit, she frets, with the leisure of a young woman married into respectability and stability, about not knowing whether the hawthorn tree in her garden will bear white, pink, or red flowers in the spring.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;A few chapters later, the hawthorn tree blooms. By then, the little brother of the family, Richard Quin, still a teen-ager, has been killed in the Great War, ten days after arriving in France. “Killed, not missing?” Cordelia cries out in agony when she&#39;s told the news. The hawthorn tree outside reveals the answer to the riddle from the winter before: the flowers are red.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;It is a quick stroke in a trilogy. The first time I read it, I did not fully register the weight of the detail. But, moving into a house in the fall, studying a garden that would remain unknowable for the moment, I went back and reread the few paragraphs about the tree.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Richard Quin, in West&#39;s trilogy, is killed in the same manner that one imagines Andrew Ramsay is killed in “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Lighthouse-Virginia-Woolf/dp/0156907399/ref=sr_1_4?crid=MDH1WY2VP4MR&amp;amp;keywords=to%20the%20lighthouse&amp;amp;qid=1697748496&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;sprefix=to%20the%20lighthouse,stripbooks,129&amp;amp;sr=1-4&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Lighthouse-Virginia-Woolf/dp/0156907399/ref=sr_1_4?crid=MDH1WY2VP4MR&amp;amp;keywords=to%20the%20lighthouse&amp;amp;qid=1697748496&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;sprefix=to%20the%20lighthouse,stripbooks,129&amp;amp;sr=1-4&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Lighthouse-Virginia-Woolf/dp/0156907399/ref=sr_1_4?crid=MDH1WY2VP4MR&amp;amp;keywords=to%20the%20lighthouse&amp;amp;qid=1697748496&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;sprefix=to%20the%20lighthouse,stripbooks,129&amp;amp;sr=1-4&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;To the Lighthouse&lt;/a>;”: “[A shell exploded. Twenty or thirty young men were blown up in France, among them Andrew Ramsay, whose death, mercifully, was instantaneous.]”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;For all we know, Richard Quin might have died next to Andrew Ramsay, in a pair of Virginia Woolf brackets.&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Some days, that pair of brackets of Woolf&#39;s continue to baffle me. Other days, they feel just right. The predicament when writing about a sudden, untimely death: the more you remember, the more elusive that death becomes. A sudden, untimely death is a black hole, absorbing all that you can give, not really clamoring for more. Though is a black hole ever to be fully filled so that it can cease to be one? Has anyone been able to define, capture, or even get close to a black hole?&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;[In September, 2017, our older son, Vincent, died by suicide, at sixteen.]&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;[On that day, we put down the deposit for the house. Deposit, death, in that order, four hours apart.]&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In a novel, I would never have put the two happenings on the same day. In writing fiction, one avoids coincidences like that, which offer unearned drama, shoddy poignancy, convenient metaphor, predictable spectacle. Life, however, does not follow a novelist&#39;s discipline. Fiction, one suspects, is often tamer than life.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Some fiction is tamer than some life, I should amend. And I confess that this is only a variation of a statement made by another character in “The Saga of the Century Trilogy,” who, upon discovering her husband&#39;s extramarital affair, reads “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Madame-Bovary-Penguin-Classics-Deluxe/dp/014310649X/ref=sr_1_4?crid=1GS2TAQUI4J9F&amp;amp;keywords=madame%20bovary&amp;amp;qid=1697748590&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;sprefix=madame%20bovar,stripbooks,82&amp;amp;sr=1-4&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Madame-Bovary-Penguin-Classics-Deluxe/dp/014310649X/ref=sr_1_4?crid=1GS2TAQUI4J9F&amp;amp;keywords=madame%20bovary&amp;amp;qid=1697748590&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;sprefix=madame%20bovar,stripbooks,82&amp;amp;sr=1-4&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Madame-Bovary-Penguin-Classics-Deluxe/dp/014310649X/ref=sr_1_4?crid=1GS2TAQUI4J9F&amp;amp;keywords=madame%20bovary&amp;amp;qid=1697748590&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;sprefix=madame%20bovar,stripbooks,82&amp;amp;sr=1-4&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;Madame Bovary&lt;/a>;” and exclaims, “But art is so much more real than life. Some art is much more real than some life, I mean.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;A couple of months after Vincent died, a colleague asked me where I was “in the process of grieving,” assuming, I supposed, that there would be, and should be, a conclusion of mourning at some point. That phrase struck me as inaccurate; she might as well have asked me where I was “in the process of living.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;There is, alas, not a normal course of life, against which deviations can be measured and, hopefully, corrected. Only changed courses, altered lives. One can look longingly at the alternatives: Vincent graduating from high school (as our younger son did this summer) or graduating from college (as Vincent&#39;s old school friends will next year), but alternatives belong to the realm of fiction. To paraphrase Elizabeth Bowen, the great Anglo-Irish writer, good fiction is good because it offers “the palpable presence of the alternatives.” In life, that presence can be palpably felt, but too much preoccupation with the alternatives may lead to a dilemma of either/or; even, neither here nor there. “Dilemma,” from its Greek etymology, means two lemmas: double assumptions, double propositions. But death is definitive; death does not lead to a dilemma.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;I think about the alternative lives of my characters all the time. But, as I did not live in fiction, I decided, soon after Vincent&#39;s death, to stop pondering the alternatives. &lt;em>;What if&lt;/em>; belongs to fiction; &lt;em>;what now&lt;/em>;, to this real life.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;What now, in the last months of 2017: I could not read fiction. It was not a problem of mental focus. I spent hours every day reading &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tag/william-shakespeare&quot;>;Shakespeare&lt;/a>;&#39;s plays and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/05/02/the-thrilling-mind-of-wallace-stevens&quot;>;Wallace Stevens&lt;/a>;&#39;s poems—all of a sudden, those words were the only ones that made sense to me. But if I stopped reading fiction would I ever be able to write fiction again? I was in the middle of a long novel. Forging ahead or scrapping the project felt equally impossible. Anguished, I looked up “anguish” in the OED, to make sure that I was using the right word to describe my situation, and, indeed, it was an apt word choice. Etymologically, “anguish” comes to us from the Latin &lt;em>;angustia&lt;/em>;—narrowness, lack of space, narrow space, narrow passage, strait, limitations, restrictions, confinement, imprisonment, restrictedness, shortage, scantiness, critical situation, narrow-mindedness, pettiness.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;A black hole takes all and gives back naught. The anguish from a sudden, untimely death has a narrowing effect: alternatives are lost; space in the mind, too.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;On her next visit, Brigid brought me two books. The first was “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Onward-Upward-Garden-Review-Classics/dp/1590178505/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2HSD3E1J99O1A&amp;amp;keywords=Onward%20and%20Upward%20in%20the%20Garden&amp;amp;qid=1697748739&amp;amp;sprefix=onward%20and%20upward%20in%20the%20garden,aps,188&amp;amp;sr=8-1&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Onward-Upward-Garden-Review-Classics/dp/1590178505/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2HSD3E1J99O1A&amp;amp;keywords=Onward%20and%20Upward%20in%20the%20Garden&amp;amp;qid=1697748739&amp;amp;sprefix=onward%20and%20upward%20in%20the%20garden,aps,188&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Onward-Upward-Garden-Review-Classics/dp/1590178505/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2HSD3E1J99O1A&amp;amp;keywords=Onward%20and%20Upward%20in%20the%20Garden&amp;amp;qid=1697748739&amp;amp;sprefix=onward%20and%20upward%20in%20the%20garden,aps,188&amp;amp;sr=8-1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;Onward and Upward in the Garden&lt;/a>;,” a collection of fourteen essays by the former &lt;em>;New Yorker&lt;/em>; fiction editor &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1996/02/26/lady-with-a-pencil&quot;>;Katharine S. White&lt;/a>;. The essays were originally published, in a span of twelve years, in the magazine, ostensibly as reviews of nursery catalogues. The other book was “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Two-Gardeners-Katharine-Lawrence-Friendship/dp/0807085588/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2YION9QR196CG&amp;amp;keywords=Two%20Gardeners:%20A%20Friendship%20in%20Letters&amp;amp;qid=1697748815&amp;amp;sprefix=two%20gardeners%20a%20friendship%20in%20letters,aps,84&amp;amp;sr=8-1&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Two-Gardeners-Katharine-Lawrence-Friendship/dp/0807085588/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2YION9QR196CG&amp;amp;keywords=Two%20Gardeners:%20A%20Friendship%20in%20Letters&amp;amp;qid=1697748815&amp;amp;sprefix=two%20gardeners%20a%20friendship%20in%20letters,aps,84&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Two-Gardeners-Katharine-Lawrence-Friendship/dp/0807085588/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2YION9QR196CG&amp;amp;keywords=Two%20Gardeners:%20A%20Friendship%20in%20Letters&amp;amp;qid=1697748815&amp;amp;sprefix=two%20gardeners%20a%20friendship%20in%20letters,aps,84&amp;amp;sr=8-1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;Two Gardeners: A Friendship in Letters&lt;/a>;,” a collection of correspondence between White and Elizabeth Lawrence. Lawrence was a gardener and a gardening writer in North Carolina, and the friendship began when Lawrence wrote a fan letter to White after reading her first essay, “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1958/03/01/book-review-onward-upward-in-the-garden-t&quot;>;A Romp in the Catalogues&lt;/a>;,” in the March 1, 1958, issue of &lt;em>;The New Yorker&lt;/em>;. For a year, they were “Mrs. White” and “Miss Lawrence” to each other, and then they became “Katharine” and “Elizabeth.” They would write to each other for the next nineteen years, until White&#39;s death, in 1977.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Through the winter, I read the two books, very slowly. There was no reason to hurry, as that first winter was a long one; cold, snowy—cold and snowy for recent transplants from California, in any case. Day after day, I looked at the bare limbs of the trees, brownish gray, and the stale snow covering the garden, grayish white. I thought one afternoon, What if spring never returns? Right away I recognized the illogic and the melodrama of that thought. I had at my hand the words of two gardeners of yesteryear, books that had taken years to be written. Were these words not enough evidence that spring always comes, if not now, later?&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;[That winter, I often returned to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tag/marianne-moore&quot;>;Marianne Moore&lt;/a>;&#39;s words: “If nothing charms or sustains us (and we are getting food and fresh air) it is for us to say, &#39;If not now, later,&#39; and not mope.” Incidentally, it was Moore who may have first suggested that White should collect her reviews of garden catalogues into a book.]&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Not to mope, I thought, was a proper goal: it would take all my energy and all my vigilance, and it was attainable. White&#39;s essays and the letters between White and Lawrence were just right for that aspiration. The two women (and likely some of the gardens and many of the plants that they had written about) were no more, and yet their words remained and sustained, offering facts and opinions, gardening tales and personal woes, seasons and years, illnesses and deaths—all there, ready to distract me.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;For instance, there were the names of plants to learn. In both books, I encountered many names, some familiar, others unfamiliar, and every one of them—even the most common, like “peony” or “lotus” or “fuchsia”—required investigation. Unlike Lawrence, I&#39;m not a purist when it comes to botany, and I don&#39;t always look up the Latin names for the plants. But I do like to know the etymology of their English names. And what one can learn just by going to the dictionary! “Peony” goes all the way back to ancient Greek: Paieon, or Paeon, was the physician of the gods. (What afflicts the gods? Possibly what afflicts us mortals.) “Lotus” comes from the Greek &lt;em>;lōtos&lt;/em>;, a mythical plant bringing forgetfulness to those who eat its fruits. (I have eaten my share of lotus seeds, a delicacy in Chinese cuisine, without achieving oblivion.) “Fuchsia,” a word I often misspelled as “fuschia”—what mythical story accompanies thee? It turns out that fuchsia was named for the sixteenth-century German physician and botanist Leonhard Fuchs, whose name gave birth not only to that of the flower and that of the color but also to the nickname, Fuchsienstadt, for his home town of Wemding, where there is a pyramid made of as many as seven hundred fuchsia plants. And yet Fuchs never saw the flower fuchsia in his lifetime: it was discovered in the Caribbean and named by the French botanist and monk Charles Plumier, who was born a hundred and forty-five years after Fuchs. What led Plumier to name the flower for Fuchs?

And what a great joy to get to know the Faulkners and Hemingways of the nursery world through her words. Signing off for the catalogue of White Flower Farm was one Amos Pettingill. “I have no idea whether Amos Pettingill is a real person—the name sounds like an ill-advised fabrication,” White observed. Real or not, the name alone, I thought, was enough to send one&#39;s imagination on a detour to Dickens-land. In the catalogue of White Flower Farm, Mr. Pettingill claimed that its French Pussy Willow was “not the unreliable wild Pussy Willow,” which led White to protest, “What is unreliable, pray, about the native wild pussies? I have found them trustworthy in every respect.” David Burpee, the president of the W. Atlee Burpee &amp;amp; Company, campaigned to have the marigold recognized as the national flower of the United States. White, describing “David Burpee&#39;s one-man lobby,” noted, “I was also pleased as well as entertained, a couple of years back, when Mr. Burpee in person went to Washington, bearing marigold boutonnières for the legislators, and, at a Congressional hearing on naming a national flower, faced down the Senatorial proponents of grass, the corn tassel, the rose, and the carnation.” (Mr. Burpee did not succeed; the rose prevailed to become the national flower.)&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;To catch a glimpse, in White&#39;s essays, of these men and women who once lived in their gardens, cultivating, hybridizing, dreaming of colors and shapes and scents that would catch their fancy, and then turning their obsessions into words, hoping that their catalogues would catch the fancy of many gardeners&#39; hearts: there is nothing narrowing in the world of roses, dahlias, marigolds, tulips, daylilies, and chrysanthemums. They were not black holes but rabbit holes.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;And, of course, there were White and Lawrence, knowledgeable, opinionated, delighting in miscellanies. In her first letter, Lawrence recommended that White write about Cecil Houdyshel&#39;s catalogues (which always opened with “Dear Floral Friends”): “I think he is in his nineties now, so you had better hurry.” In reply, White confessed, “I am always nervous when I write about old people.” Both women saw a garden writer in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tag/lewis-carroll&quot;>;Lewis Carroll&lt;/a>;.

The books, of course, have less to do with the missed or lost alternatives; instead, they make perfect nonsense out of the alternatives.]&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;After we moved into the house, I ordered twenty-five hyacinth bulbs (Delft Blue) and buried them haphazardly in the corners where I was certain that they would not interfere with any existing plants. Twenty-five, in retrospect, was a touchingly small number—a gesture rather than a plan, a prelude to a dream rather than a dream realized. But a gardener, like a writer, must start somewhere. (Last fall, I planted eight hundred bulbs; the fall before, seven hundred.)&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Because of those twenty-five bulbs, garden catalogues began to arrive. One could be realistic: it had taken little time for one&#39;s address to be shared among the nurseries. One could also be romantic: imagine that tentative order of bulbs as a small bugle, announcing a budding gardener. The catalogues, though radically improved graphically from the ones reviewed by White, still bore the same names: White Flower Farm, Wayside Gardens, Park Seed Company, W. Atlee Burpee &amp;amp; Company, and several more. I perused the catalogues as I imagined White and Lawrence had done; although new to this literature, I had yet to cultivate my tastes and form my opinions.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;It occurred to me one day that no one had made a catalogue of gardeners: professional gardeners, who might be like important cultivars, bearing poetic or eccentric names; amateurs, akin to common carnations and cornflowers; and those, like me, who were gardeners only in their fantasies. Such a catalogue, abundant with human stories, would be amusing to read, no? I then realized that I was, true to my profession, fictioneering again.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;When I was growing up, in Beijing, my family lived on the ground floor of an apartment block, so we were lucky to have a tiny lot, about two metres by 1.5 metres. My father, who had come from poor peasant stock, gardened judiciously: a grapevine that produced very sweet grapes (often pillaged by the wasps), our favorite green beans (which bore the name “pig ears”), loofahs (good for soup when the gourds were young and tender; when they were old and fibrous, they made the best kitchen scrubs), a honeysuckle plant (dried honeysuckle flowers can be used as medicinal tea). One year, when I was four or five, he planted some potatoes and described to me the unforgettable flavor of new potatoes. The only other time I have heard such a rapturous description of new potatoes was from an Irish poet in Cork.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;My father did not garden for beauty. Some years, he would plant a cluster of impatiens, which he called “fingernail flowers” because, in the old days, the pink and red petals had been used when painting girls&#39; fingernails. The only constant floral decorations in our garden were the morning glories, self-seeding and wildly vivacious. Once, two women laughed at our garden to my face, dismissing my father as a lazy gardener who grew flowers that were no more than weeds. I was too young and too intimidated to defend him: he was a nuclear physicist, but he also did all the grocery shopping and most of the housework, cooked three meals a day for the family, and gardened in his spare time.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;People who cultivated peonies and roses and orchids were not necessarily kind, which was not a surprise. I had learned from Chinese history that cold-blooded dictators—&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tag/mao-zedong&quot;>;Chairman Mao&lt;/a>;, for instance—had also written heartrending poetry, and that capricious dynastic tyrants had often been supreme calligraphers and painters. On the other hand, people who were cruel to garden plants could easily extend that cruelty to human beings. One day, my mother uprooted the honeysuckle for no other reason than that she could—so she would—inflict pain. My father mourned, and I seethed, though we both did so quietly.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;When the spring of 2018 arrived, I, the daughter of my pragmatic father, started by growing vegetables in containers—I was still waiting for the flowers in the garden to emerge and show themselves to me. In the next two years, I grew Chinese celtuce, baby bok choy, green beans, eggplants, tomatoes, sweet peppers, okra, and a variety of herbs, and ended up having plenty of opportunities to observe at close hand birds and squirrels, snails and slugs, aphids and spider mites, and all the other archenemies of a garden. Various campaigns were carried out: I ordered live ladybugs, hundreds at a time, and released them in the evenings after it rained, hoping that they would not fly away; I hung up birdhouses, waiting for wrens to move in and feed their chicks with my garden&#39;s offering of bugs; fake snakes were strategically placed to ward off rodents, and they did little but frighten me every time I stepped on their rubbery bodies.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;And then there is the problem without any solution: the bigger animals. Deer graze undiscriminatingly (but luckily, in my case, only in the front yard, for the back yard is fenced). The fence, of course, does nothing to deter rabbits. (On a visit I paid to the Irish writer &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/contributors/william-trevor&quot;>;William Trevor&lt;/a>;, at his house in Devon, he pointed out rolls of metal mesh, to be buried at a certain depth—inches? feet? I forgot how much—into the ground as a rabbit fence. I have yet to be so enterprising.) The rabbits show up in late May or early June, fist-size fluffs, and a month later they can stand on their hind feet and stretch more than a foot tall. They chomp down everything and turn me into a maddened Mrs. McGregor. (I will never believe any catalogue if it dares label a plant rabbit-resistant.) Next comes our resident groundhog. Perhaps there is more than one, but they all look the same to me: giant and comical. The groundhogs are the most effective destroyers of a garden. I named ours for an infamous politician, although a friend, quite sensibly, pointed out that calling the groundhog by the politician&#39;s name was an insult to the animal: the groundhog is doing only what he&#39;s supposed to do, tramping and feasting in what he considers his garden.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;One early summer morning, I looked out the window and saw two deer and a rabbit in my front garden, eating up some hydrangea bushes I had planted a few weeks earlier. It occurred to me that, had I been able to go back to my childhood self and tell her that one day I would live in a place where rabbits and deer eat side by side peacefully, the child would be incredulous: certainly no real people could live in a fairy tale like that?&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;i11q09&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;“I am sure that if you had been told when you were a child about all the things that you were going to have to do, you would have thought you had better die at once, you would not have believed you could ever have the strength to do them.” In West&#39;s trilogy, Richard Quin says this to his mother before he leaves to be killed in France. Had I been able to go back to my childhood self and tell her that one day I would live as a mother who has lost a son, the child would be equally incredulous: surely such things happen only in fiction, to characters who are much more interesting and tragic?&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;My garden this spring looks a little different from the garden that came back to life in the spring of 2018. For two years in a row, it was razed by an endless army of rabbits, and, by late summer, it looked like a sad head suffering irregular hair loss, with large bald patches and some surviving stalks of flowers. But this, I had learned from White and Lawrence, is only part of a garden&#39;s fate. In a letter from the spring of 1960, Lawrence reported to White about her magnolia, “We had a real frost last night (almost unheard of for mid-April) and &lt;em>;Magnolia Lennei&lt;/em>; is covered with brown rags. I am going to chop it down, for this happens too often.” In her reply, White wrote, “I called home and learned that mice had eaten and destroyed nine of my old-fashioned rose bushes, so I am extra sympathetic about the magnolia.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Anything can happen in a garden, nothing lasts, and yet something can always be made out of the soil, even with the most destructive weather, even when rabbits and groundhogs and Japanese beetles join forces, greedy and ruthless. All things in the garden, just as in life, are provisional and impermanent. One gardens with the same unblinded hope and the same willingness to concede as one lives, always ready to say, If not now, later; if not this year, next year.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;But these sentiments would have sounded preachy had I said them to Vincent when he was alive. (The truth is, I would not have been able to, since I had not yet learned them myself.) A few weeks before his death, when we were touring the house with real-estate agents, he said to me, “This garden needs improvement. I can&#39;t wait to garden with you.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;One can linger in that memory, but there is no reason to attach too much meaning to it. A garden is not a shrine. Living is not metaphorizing. I don&#39;t always think about Vincent&#39;s plan to work alongside me when I potter in the garden. A garden is trustworthy only at this moment, in this now: the past is irrevocable, the future unpredictable.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;[Though I did plant a special patch of tulips for Vincent last fall: Tulipa Vincent van Gogh, dark and mysterious, and Tulipa Ballerina, golden and elegant.]&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Five years later, I still consider myself a beginning gardener. I&#39;m avid, but always ready to surrender to disappointments, to setbacks, to failures and deaths. Unlike White and Lawrence, I garden without a design. (From &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2005/02/14/andy&quot;>;E. B. White&lt;/a>;&#39;s introduction to the essay collection, one gathers that Katharine&#39;s garden provided the right colors, shapes, and scents throughout the year.) Much of the planting and growing delights me because of the connections I can make.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;The blooming of the Vanessa Bell, one of my favorite roses from the David Austin catalogue, reminds me of one of the last public readings that William Trevor gave, in 2008; I had flown from California to England to attend the event, which took place in Charleston, Vanessa Bell and Duncan Grant&#39;s house in East Sussex. Emily Brontë, another of my favorite David Austin roses, blooms with what I call “a wuthering tenderness,” and when the Emily Brontës are blooming I always think of my first reading of “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Wuthering-Heights-Penguin-Classics-Bront%C3%AB/dp/0141439556/ref=sr_1_3?crid=1HL1KLVP7V91Q&amp;amp;keywords=wuthering%20heights&amp;amp;qid=1697749633&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;sprefix=wuthering%20heigh,stripbooks,100&amp;amp;sr=1-3&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Wuthering-Heights-Penguin-Classics-Bront%C3%AB/dp/0141439556/ref=sr_1_3?crid=1HL1KLVP7V91Q&amp;amp;keywords=wuthering%20heights&amp;amp;qid=1697749633&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;sprefix=wuthering%20heigh,stripbooks,100&amp;amp;sr=1-3&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Wuthering-Heights-Penguin-Classics-Bront%C3%AB/dp/0141439556/ref=sr_1_3?crid=1HL1KLVP7V91Q&amp;amp;keywords=wuthering%20heights&amp;amp;qid=1697749633&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;sprefix=wuthering%20heigh,stripbooks,100&amp;amp;sr=1-3&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;Wuthering Heights&lt;/a>;,” as a teen-ager in Beijing. Mystified and electrified, I held on to the book as though it offered a refuge for my mind, but I now suspect that I was only pretending to understand the passion and the drama in the story. A few Roald Dahls from David Austin were planted because Dahl was among my children&#39;s favorite authors when they were young. The Lady of Shalott and Tess of the d&#39;Urbervilles for poetry and fiction. The Lady Gardener as a self-mocking gesture.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Over the past few years, I&#39;ve added a dozen hydrangea bushes to the garden, because one of my characters, Lilia—who, like me, lost a child at the age of forty-four—has grown hydrangeas all her life with a passion. [It was the novel I was working on when Vincent died. I had already written about the death of Lilia&#39;s child when I encountered the same loss.]&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Daylilies are not really my favorite, but I grow them because in my father&#39;s village in southern China the soil is the meagrest type, and the only crops my father&#39;s family could grow were yams and daylilies; the flowers were harvested for culinary use—a delicacy for other people.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Some flowers in my garden have been inherited from the previous owners: astilbes, baptisias, azaleas, and buddleias. When the astilbes bloom, their white flowers make a shimmering mass in the sun, countering the meaning of their name, in Greek, as something that does not shimmer. The baptisias have indigo flowers, and the name comes from the Greek: to dip, to immerse, to dye (which shares the root with “baptism”). Azaleas&#39; name, too, comes from the Greek, meaning “dry,” but there is nothing dry about these flowers. Buddleias, however, were simply named for an English botanist, Adam Buddle.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Primroses bloom early, before the roses. Anemones (ancient Greek&#39;s daughters of the wind) wave their strikingly colorful and delicate flowers in the spring breeze. Geraniums (from the Greek: cranes) expand long-leggedly. Campanulas (from the Latin: little bells) produce bell-shaped flowers without making a cacophony. These and other varieties I have added to the garden. Some have stayed and prospered. Others have proved to be a trustworthy food supply for rabbits. Delphiniums, I have learned, can never stay in the garden for more than a few days. Dianthus and phlox are a game of statistics, which is possibly just like fate; if they survive the raids of the rabbits, they have neither themselves nor me to credit.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;When Vincent was in the eighth grade, I drove him and a friend, a girl, back from a birthday party, and, like all mothers, I eavesdropped on their conversation. They were discussing the girl&#39;s decision not to participate in a poetry contest. She had read the previous winners, she said, and they were composed of words such as “injustice,” “inequality,” “empowerment,” “action.” “What I don&#39;t understand,” the girl said, “is why can&#39;t we write about flowers anymore.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Of course we can,” Vincent said. “But . 。 .”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;He did not finish the sentence. I wondered if he was asking: Is there still a place for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tag/emily-dickinson&quot;>;Emily Dickinson&lt;/a>; these days?&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Every spring, when the first flush of David Austin roses bloom, there is always a moment when I turn, in my mind, to Vincent. “Here&#39;s something you haven&#39;t seen: these roses.” The line is offered as a fact, not as an argument, for a rose is never an argument. There is no such thing as an angry rose or a moping rose or an empowered rose; only a realistic rose, a matter-of-fact rose, a transient rose.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;A garden is a place full of random, diverting, and irrelevant happenings, and a garden, as good as a rabbit hole, serves also as an antidote to a black hole. These days, I often get up early. Every flower seems to require an individual greeting from me. In the Buddhist tradition, one encounters sayings like “A flower is a world, a grass leaf is a paradise.” But I, not quite a believer in any kind of religion or metaphor, would rather think that each flower in my garden holds some concrete space, a physical one as well as a temporal one. A flower, like a thought, a sentence, a book, is but a placeholder. ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 23 Oct 2023 20:06:01 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Revenge of the Luddites!]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/10/30/revenge-of-the-luddites]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-23T10:00:00.000Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6532ea970b537a206b5acdbc/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/231030_r43257illuweb-site.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;article >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attribute-verso-pattern=&quot;article-body&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;ArticlePageChunks&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;“I&#39;m absolutely a Luddite,” the author and columnist Brian Merchant said the other day at an outdoor café in Brooklyn. He has long, brown hair and a goatee, and was wearing a plaid shirt over a T-shirt that read “The Luddites Were Right.” On the chair next to him sat an HP printer.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Merchant feels that the original Luddites, early-nineteenth-century cloth-makers who raided British factories and destroyed the new machines that were replacing them, have been getting a bad rap lately. Modern people tend to see them as fools who didn&#39;t appreciate the benefits of technology. In Merchant&#39;s view, the Luddites saw the future all too clearly: new machinery meant that the work they had previously done in their own homes would now be done in factories, as mass production, destroying the workers&#39; way of life.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“It wasn&#39;t so much resisting any kind of change—it was resisting getting steamrolled, getting crushed and thrown into poverty,” Merchant said. “They were more anti-poverty than they were anti-technology.” He thinks their rebellion, which came after more peaceful attempts to save their jobs failed, was “morally justified.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;He sees parallels in the present, including people throwing rocks at Google&#39;s employee buses, actors striking over streaming pay, writers protesting the use of artificial intelligence, and activists placing construction cones on driverless cars to scramble their computers. “That&#39;s a Luddite tactic right there,” Merchant said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;He was about to host what he called a Luddite Tribunal at Starr Bar, around the corner, to celebrate his new book, “Blood in the Machine,” about the history of the movement. Merchant and other tech critics—the artist Molly Crabapple; the podcast host Edward Ongweso, Jr. (“This Machine Kills”); the labor reporter Alex Press; and Paris Marx, the host of “Tech Won&#39;t Save Us”—planned to hold up pieces of technology, debate whether they caused more harm than good, and then smash the condemned objects to bits. Merchant had brought an eight-pound sledgehammer purchased from a local hardware store. (He shuns Amazon.)&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;At the bar, he explained that the panel would “try” the printer and a Ring camera he&#39;d brought, and accept submissions from the audience. “You have to have something that&#39;s, like, satisfying to smash,” he said. “I think we&#39;re gonna have to have a blast radius.” He supplied the front row with safety goggles.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;One of the bar&#39;s events managers, Quinton Counts, wasn&#39;t fazed by the potential for glass projectiles and flying motherboard shards. “We get it all,” he said. “It&#39;s Bushwick.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Two guys were sitting in the front row with cans of beer. One of them, Christian Cmehil-Warn, an MIT grad student with long hair and a red T-shirt, said that he worried about AI being used to oppress workers and make unjust decisions about loans and housing. His friend, a former professional gamer who has a graduate degree in quantitative finance (and who didn&#39;t want to be identified), said he&#39;d become skeptical of technology after realizing that the industry he works in—mobile gaming—had created the equivalent of online slot machines, primed to drive addiction. “It&#39;s, like, sixty to ninety per cent of the revenues come from one per cent of the people,” he said. “They&#39;re essentially degenerate gamblers being exploited by sophisticated algorithms.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;As the room filled up with other tech skeptics, Cmehil-Warn said that, at MIT, scientists were developing robots and apps without considering how they would be used. “It&#39;s like Frankenstein&#39;s monster,” he said. “The guy just makes it and lets it go.” The former gamer was interested in the psychology of cults and scams and said that he was opposed to cryptocurrency, which he called a “multilevel-marketing scheme for tech bros.” Which technological development were they most worried about? “AI girlfriends,” the former gamer said without hesitating.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;David Gray Widder, fresh from Carnegie Mellon with a Ph.D. in computer science, sat down. He said that, as a student, he&#39;d protested the use of facial-recognition software by the Pittsburgh police. He wore a Garmin, rather than an Apple, watch. He had helped cause a kerfuffle at Carnegie Mellon (named after “two anti-labor philanthropy capitalists,” he said) in 2020, when he took a screwdriver and removed a “smart sensor,” which included a microphone, that had been preinstalled in his campus office. He put the sensor in a plexiglass box on a shelf and notified the department leadership of his concerns. (After a backlash, he reinstalled it.) Caleb Malchik, another computer scientist, took a seat next to him. He&#39;d been radicalized against tech in part by Edward Snowden and said that copyright posed a threat to free speech.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Look!” the former gamer said, holding up his phone screen. “I just got a recruiting e-mail from Meta. How&#39;s that for irony?”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Onstage, Merchant leaned forward on the handle of his hammer. “You know, it&#39;s important to point out that the Luddites were not just in a blind rage, smashing everything,” he said. “They were very tactical and very focussed on what was actually causing exploitation.” After significant effort, the panelists managed to break the Ring camera (“expanding the surveillance state”), and then tore up a hideous clown poster created using generative AI (“made basically from plagiarized work”). Then Merchant brought out the printer (a symbol of the indignities of office life which only works with Hewlett-Packard&#39;s own overpriced ink) and placed it on a chair.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“ &#39;Office Space&#39; that shit!” someone yelled. ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;rgjk0i&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;83ep3y&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 23 Oct 2023 20:06:01 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[The Real Cost of Plundering the Planet’s Resources]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/10/30/the-real-cost-of-plundering-the-planets-resources]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-23T10:00:00.000Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6530266723b1c7056b8e042f/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/231030_r43242.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;article >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attribute-verso-pattern=&quot;article-body&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;ArticlePageChunks&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;The town of Spruce Pine, North Carolina, doesn&#39;t have a lot to say for itself. Its Web site, which features a photo of a flowering tree next to a rusty bridge, notes that the town is “conveniently located between Asheville and Boone.” According to the latest census data, it has 2,332 residents and a population density of 498.1 per square mile. A recent story in the local newspaper concerned the closing of the Hardee&#39;s on Highway 19E; this followed an incident, back in May, when a fourteen-year-old boy who&#39;d eaten a biscuit at the restaurant began to hallucinate and had to be taken to the hospital. Without Spruce Pine, though, the global economy might well unravel.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Spruce Pine&#39;s planetary importance follows from an accident of geology. Some three hundred and eighty million years ago, during the late Devonian period, the continent of Africa was drifting toward what would eventually become eastern North America. The force of its movement pressed the floor of a Paleozoic sea deep into the earth&#39;s mantle, where, in effect, it melted. Over the course of tens of millions of years, the molten rock cooled to form deposits of exceptionally pure mica and quartz, which were then pushed back up toward the surface. In the twentieth century, Spruce Pine&#39;s mica was mined to make windows for coal-burning stoves and insulation for vacuum tubes. In the computer age, it&#39;s the town&#39;s quartz that&#39;s critical.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Silicon chips are essentially made of quartz, although this is a bit like saying that the “Mona Lisa” is essentially made of linseed oil. Manufacturing microchips is phenomenally complex and supremely exacting. The process generally begins with quartz&#39;s cousin, quartzite, which consists in large measure of silicon dioxide. Under very high heat, and in the presence of carbon, the quartzite gives up most of its oxygen. Then acid and a great deal more heat are applied, until the silicon reaches a purity level of 99.9999999 per cent, or, as it&#39;s known in the business, “nine nines.” At this point, the silicon is ready to be fashioned into a “boule,” or ingot, that weighs upward of two hundred pounds and consists of a single perfectly aligned crystal. It is here that Spruce Pine&#39;s quartz comes into play.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;To form a boule, pure silicon has to be heated in a special crucible to twenty-seven hundred degrees Fahrenheit. The crucible must be tough enough to withstand this temperature, and, at the same time, it must have the right chemical composition, so it won&#39;t introduce contaminants. The only substance that meets both these criteria is high-purity quartz, and one of the only spots where the right sort of quartz can be found is Spruce Pine.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Spruce Pine&#39;s quartz is so valuable that, as the Vancouver-based journalist Vince Beiser observes in his book “The World in a Grain,” almost everything about it, outside of its purity, is a closely guarded secret. The company that owns the town&#39;s largest mine—Sibelco, a Belgian conglomerate—doesn&#39;t publish production figures. When contractors arrive to make repairs at the mine, they are reportedly led to the equipment in blindfolds. According to documents filed in a case that the company once brought against a former employee, it tries to divvy up its contracting jobs, so that no individual can learn too much, and for the same reason it purchases its supplies from multiple venders.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;All this stealth, Ed Conway suggests in his new book, “Material World: The Six Raw Materials That Shape Modern Civilization” (Knopf), is justified. “There are few such cases where we are so utterly reliant on a single place,” he writes. He quotes an unnamed industry veteran who notes that someone flying a crop duster over Spruce Pine and releasing “a very particular powder” could “end the world&#39;s production of semiconductors” within six months. No production of semiconductors would mean no production of computers, cell phones, automobiles, microwaves, game consoles, fitness trackers, digital watches, digital cameras, televisions—the list goes on and on.&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;“Even in devices that don&#39;t have &#39;smart&#39; in their name, mechanical linkages have long since given way to a network of semiconductors,” Conway, a London-based journalist, observes. “Nearly every economic activity, nearly every dollar of global GDP, relies in one way or another on the microscopic switches of semiconductors.” Prudently, he does not reveal what that very particular powder is.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Of the ten largest corporations in the world, six are tech companies. In 2021, fifty per cent of Americans said they spend more than half the day in front of a screen, and a recent survey found that kids in the United States devote almost seven hours a day to staring at pixels. Statistics like these can produce the sense that matter doesn&#39;t matter all that much anymore. Conway thinks that this is an illusion, and a dangerous one. Contemporary society continues to rely on raw materials, like Spruce Pine&#39;s quartz, taken from the earth. Indeed, extraction rates, far from slowing, keep accelerating. These days, Conway reckons, humanity mines, drains, and blasts more stuff out of the ground each year than it did in total during the roughly three hundred millennia between the birth of the species and the start of the Korean War. This comes with immense consequences, both ecological and social, even if we don&#39;t attend to them.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Consider sand, the first of Conway&#39;s not so dark materials. According to a 2022 report from the United Nations Environment Programme, global demand for “sand resources” has tripled in the past two decades, to something like a hundred trillion pounds a year; this amounts to almost thirty-five pounds a day for every person on the planet. A lot of sand (though no one seems to know exactly how much) goes into land building. Among the world&#39;s biggest sand importers is Singapore, which has grown by more than fifty square miles since the nineteen-sixties. Among the major exporters is Vietnam, where sand dredging along the Mekong Delta has caused so much erosion that whole villages&#39; worth of homes have been swept downstream.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;“Where once there were riverbanks, today there are sheer drops into the water,” Conway writes. Such is the hunger for sand that, in many parts of the globe, an illicit trade has sprung up. In India, so-called sand mafias are rumored to pay off cops and politicians. According to the South Asia Network on Dams, Rivers and People, a Delhi-based advocacy group, at least a dozen civilians and two government officials were killed by sand mafias between December, 2020, and March, 2022. (This was down from twenty-three civilians, five journalists and activists, and eleven government officials killed during the two years prior.)&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;A lot of sand also goes into building buildings, not to mention dams, bridges, overpasses, and roadways. Sand and gravel are the major ingredients in concrete, some seven hundred billion tons of which now slather the earth. Often, concrete is reinforced with rebar, which is made with iron, the third of Conway&#39;s six materials. (The material I&#39;ve skipped here is salt, which, Conway says, is essential to just about every chemical process that&#39;s ever been invented.)&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Worldwide, nearly three billion tons of iron ore are extracted each year. Australia is currently the leading source, and its biggest mines are in the Pilbara, a region in the country&#39;s dry, dusty northwest. Iron from the Pilbara is mined by blasting the landscape apart and then carting away the pieces, using, as Conway puts it, “church-sized diggers.” Just the other day, several people died in the Pilbara when a truck carrying ammonium nitrate, an explosive used in the blasts, collided with another vehicle.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Conway devotes a hefty chunk of his discussion of iron to the story of the rock shelters in Juukan Gorge. These were sacred to two of the Pilbara&#39;s Aboriginal peoples, the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and the Pinikura, and contained artifacts that were some forty thousand years old. After assuring the communities that “all reasonable endeavors” would be made to minimize the impact of its operations in the area, the mining company Rio Tinto blew the rock shelters up. (The company has since apologized for what happened.)&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Perhaps what makes the destruction of the Juukan caves most disturbing is that we are all, one way or another, complicit,” Conway writes. Most of Australia&#39;s iron ore is shipped off to China, where it&#39;s converted into steel and used to construct the factories and machinery that churn out the phones, consoles, chargers, T-shirts, running shoes, housewares, and assorted tchotchkes the rest of the world buys.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Like many books in its genre—about how &lt;em>;x&lt;/em>; number of &lt;em>;y&lt;/em>; items explain &lt;em>;z&lt;/em>;—“Material World” has trouble sticking to its chosen integer. One of Conway&#39;s six raw materials is oil, but into this category he also squishes natural gas. Both are obviously fossil fuels, but, as Conway himself notes, they have distinctive properties that make them essential in different ways. Oil powers the transportation sector—cars, trucks, airplanes, and supertankers—and its by-products go into plastics, which show up in just about every consumer product you can name, from air mattresses to zippers. Natural gas, meanwhile, is primarily used to generate heat and electricity. It&#39;s also a key ingredient for synthesizing nitrogen fertilizer, without which, it is estimated, half the world&#39;s eight billion people would starve.&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot;

Despite a lot of talk about cutting back on fossil fuels, the world, he points out, is consuming just as much oil and gas as ever before (and very nearly as much coal). But, if Conway is concerned about our continuing reliance on fossil fuels, he&#39;s also concerned about what it will take to replace them. Two of the alternatives are solar and wind. Conway calculates that building enough wind turbines to shutter a hundred-megawatt natural-gas plant would take fifty thousand tons of concrete and thirty thousand tons of iron. Meanwhile, a transportation sector that runs on electricity will require a whole lot more of his fourth material, copper. A recent report from S. &amp;amp; P. Global predicted that, worldwide, copper consumption will double over the next twelve years and that “there is a looming mismatch” between the available supply and the growing “copper demand resulting from the energy transition.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Conway visits the Chuquicamata copper mine, in northern Chile—Chuqui, for short—which is believed to be the largest open-pit mine on the globe. When a blast goes off at the bottom of the pit, more than half a mile down, the noise, he says, is “shattering.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Industrial mining operations began at the site a century ago. In the intervening decades, most of the best-quality ore there, and indeed around the globe, has been churned through. “Even as people demanded more copper the earth became considerably less willing to give it up,” Conway writes. In 1900, fifty tons of rock yielded a ton of copper; to obtain that ton today, some eight hundred tons of rock must be processed.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Next to the Chuquicamata mine sits a town of the same name, which was abandoned in the early two-thousands, as waste rock began tumbling into people&#39;s gardens and residents fell ill. (The citizens of the town took to calling it &lt;em>;Chuqui qui mata&lt;/em>;, or “Chuqui which kills.”) By now, the waste has piled up high enough to consume a quarter of the vacant houses and a seven-story hospital.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Lithium—the last of Conway&#39;s materials—is equally essential to electrification. A typical electric-car battery contains nearly twenty pounds of the metal, which, in the era of climate change, has been dubbed “white gold.” Like many strategic resources—see, for example, high-purity quartz—lithium is unevenly distributed. More than three-quarters of the known resources lie in just four countries: Chile, Argentina, Bolivia, and Australia. Competition over lithium supplies is one of the many sources of tension between the US and China. Conway fears a replay of the nineteenth century, “when European countries colonised their way through much of the world, seeking rubber here, copper there.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The best option he sees for the future lies in what he calls “unmanufacturing.” Iron, copper, and lithium, in contrast to oil, can be recycled. Faced with climate change on the one hand and the material demands of new energy infrastructure on the other, perhaps humanity will finally figure out how to reuse the gazillions of tons of resources it&#39;s already dug up. Conway doesn&#39;t believe this will happen anytime soon—“We are still a long, long way from that promised land,” he cautions—but it is at least theoretically possible.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Chip Colwell, too, argues that it&#39;s time to rethink our ties to the material world. But Colwell is an archeologist, and, as such, he takes a longer view. In “So Much Stuff: How Humans Discovered Tools, Invented Meaning, and Made More of Everything” (Chicago), he seeks to explain how &lt;em>;Homo sapiens&lt;/em>; went from knapping chert to ordering granite countertops. What happened, he asks, “that led our species from having nothing to needing everything?”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Colwell, a former curator at the Denver Museum of Nature &amp;amp; Science, divides humanity&#39;s association with “stuff” into three periods. At the start of the first (and by far the longest), our hominin ancestors realized that some of the objects that were lying around—rocks, primarily—could be fashioned into implements. By two and a half million years ago, hominins—it&#39;s uncertain which species they belonged to—had mastered what&#39;s known as “secondary tool use”; they could take a stone and bash it against a different kind of stone to produce a blade with one sharp edge. This method of tool production continued, pretty much unchanged, for a million years or so, until some other group of hominins—probably &lt;em>;Homo erectus&lt;/em>;—made a breakthrough: they figured out how to make stone tools with &lt;em>;two&lt;/em>; sharp edges. Meanwhile, the story goes, humans began to evolve in concert with their technologies. Their hand axes allowed them to chop up other animals (and also, presumably, plants); this, in turn, allowed them to devote less effort to digestion and put more toward cogitation. The result was a feedback loop.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;kni319&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;“Bigger and smarter brains led to the ability to create better tools, which in turn provided more energy for bigger and smarter brains,” Colwell writes. Eventually, early humans became so dependent on their tools that they couldn&#39;t do without them.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The next period, in Colwell&#39;s telling, begins with the invention of what might, broadly speaking, be called art. This happened perhaps as early as half a million years ago, when a &lt;em>;Homo erectus&lt;/em>; living in what&#39;s now Indonesia made some scratches on a mussel shell. By thirty thousand years ago, &lt;em>;Homo sapiens&lt;/em>; living in what&#39;s now Italy were grinding ochre to paint figures on stone. The advent of art marks the point, Conway writes, at which things were no longer valued only for their utility—“when objects began to do more than just serve our biological needs.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;During periods one and two, accumulating stuff was tough. In the days before agriculture, humans were constantly on the move and could possess only as much as they could carry. Once they began farming and settling down, around ten thousand years ago, whole new classes of objects were created—wheels, plows, sickles. The new objects, along with the food surpluses they helped produce, gave rise to new forms of human relations. Societies became stratified, and their most powerful members began to express their status by accumulating objects of value. Still, everything had to be made by hand, and the vast majority of people remained, by today&#39;s standards, dirt poor.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Then came the Industrial Revolution, which ushered in period three. People figured out how to reliably turn iron into steel and sand into concrete. They invented steam engines, followed by steam turbines. Each innovation begat more innovation, and the feedback loop was, in a manner of speaking, electrified. To manufacture demand, marketers capitalized on the equation of stuff with status. In the Global North, at least, scarcity gave way to superabundance. Colwell quotes an estimate—perhaps reliable, perhaps not—that the average US household possesses three hundred thousand things. (Some of these things, admittedly, are paper clips.) Americans now have so many belongings, he notes, that they routinely pay to keep piles of them in storage.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;While writing his book, Colwell decides to try to step off the consumerist treadmill. Together with his wife and nine-year-old daughter, he embarks on what he calls a “slow-buy year.” Each member of the family agrees to purchase no more than five items over the course of twelve months, besides “necessities”—a category that includes food and school supplies. Before the halfway mark, Colwell and his family are already starting to chafe against their self-imposed limits. Then they purchase a new house. The idea of slow buying gets tossed out with the moving boxes.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“So Much Stuff” and “Material World” each make strong points; taken together, the books are even more compelling—and alarming. Consumption patterns in the Global North—and South, increasingly—simply cannot be sustained. Everyone who&#39;s read the news lately, or just ventured outside into this summer&#39;s smoke-filled, record-breaking heat, knows this. But that knowledge doesn&#39;t seem to change much. Conway explains this failure as a function of modernity. The industrialized world was built out of mountains of sand, iron, and copper, and it cannot operate without vast quantities of these or other materials. Colwell traces the problem back even further. Our special talent as a species is our ability to refashion raw materials—first rocks into tools, then, eventually, quartz into integrated circuits. We are, he suggests, &lt;em>;Homo stuffensis&lt;/em>;, a creature “defined and made by our things.” We should change our ways—we &lt;em>;must&lt;/em>; change our ways—but this long history is against us. ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>; &lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/ div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;div>;&lt;div>;&lt;div>;&lt;div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt; /div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:橙色&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https: //feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 23 Oct 2023 20:06:01 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“My Name Is Barbra,” Excerpted]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/10/30/my-name-is-barbra-excerpted]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-23T10:00:00.000Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653011c4e129bd34403a2f44/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/231030_r43241.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;article >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attribute-verso-pattern=&quot;article-body&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;ArticlePageChunks&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;blockquote >;&lt;div >;&lt;p>;With her long-awaited memoir, Barbra Streisand offers a funny and frank look at her career, six decades in.

It&#39;s like the time at a fund-raiser in the nineteen-eighties—oh, my God, I&#39;m losing my breath control even &lt;em>;thinking&lt;/em>; about this—I got seated next to the real-estate magnate Donald Trump. &lt;em>;Talk&lt;/em>; about suffering. The eleventh plague. Even then, I knew.我知道。 But I kept my mouth shut until dessert. Because we all have to practice empathy. Life is not always easy. You want a walk along the ocean at sunset? Order the mussels. If you&#39;re not a listener, then you can&#39;t get informed, and Jefferson said that &#39;a well-informed electorate is a prerequisite to democracy.&#39; Or look at the Hebrew word &lt;em>;dayenu&lt;/em>;, which means &#39;enough.&#39; No one mandates what is and isn&#39;t &lt;em>;dayenu;&lt;/em>; there&#39;s no Dayenu Committee (though if you&#39;re looking for people to serve: hello). You&#39;ve got to determine this stuff on your own—when to speak out, when to rejoice in song. You know, some of my friends tease me for color-coördinating the wrappers on the candy in my living rooms; other people thought I was crazy when I built a &#39;shopping mall&#39; of antique stores and my used costumes, based on the one at the Winterthur estate, in the basement of my barn in Malibu. But at the end of the day? These are precisely the things that these same people love about me. Bill and Hillary adored it when I gave them a tour of the barn and I made Hillary try on my sequinny black see-through Scaasi pants suit from the &#39;69 Oscars: NSFW Hillary. Hillary &lt;em>;beyond&lt;/em>; e-mails. I mean, if you don&#39;t assert your will and your consummate design sense, who are you really? Sure, people have called me &#39;mouthy&#39; or &#39;pushy&#39; or a million things that they&#39;d never say about a man, but you know what? The world needs to know what the rest of the world is thinking. People who need people, etc. And in my experience people &lt;em>;want&lt;/em>; to be told if their jeans make their ass look fat. Sure, they&#39;ll smart at first, but later that night, as they&#39;re falling asleep? They&#39;re smiling.为什么？ Because they&#39;re thinking, Barbra cares about my silhouette. So, sometimes you need to speak out. Sometimes you need to look at the person next to you at the dinner party of life and—on realizing that he is a liar and a bully and a misogynist and a tax cheat who supports capital punishment—whisper in his ear, &#39;Donald, honey.

Garner, whose book reviews are a highlight of the &lt;em>;Times&lt;/em>; culture pages, serves up a commonplace book composed of literary quotations, advice for living, recipes, and a heaping side order of memoir. The assortment makes it clear that, in his reading and at the table, Garner, like A. J. Liebling before him, is a man of immense appetites. He likes his dishes unpretentious––his yearning for chili dogs is at least as powerful as his love of oysters––and his tastes as a reader range from thrillers centered on hardboiled boozers to “Ulysses,” in which grilled mutton kidneys thrill Leopold Bloom, with their “tang of faintly scented urine.” Garner&#39;s mind––his “upstairs delicatessen”––is generous, excellent company.&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;Revolutionary Spring by Christopher Clark.&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/652ed0c112854ff6621607bb/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/231030_r43248web.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/652ed0c112854ff6621607bb/master/w_120,c_limit/231030_r43248web.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/652ed0c112854ff6621607bb/master/w_240,c_limit/231030_r43248web.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/652ed0c112854ff6621607bb/master/w_320,c_limit/231030_r43248web.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/652ed0c112854ff6621607bb/master/w_640,c_limit/231030_r43248web.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/652ed0c112854ff6621607bb/master/w_960,c_limit/231030_r43248web.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/652ed0c112854ff6621607bb/master/w_1280,c_limit/231030_r43248web.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/652ed0c112854ff6621607bb/master/w_1600,c_limit/231030_r43248web.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;Revolutionary Spring&lt;/strong>;&lt;em>;, by Christopher Clark (Crown)&lt;/em>;. This Cambridge historian&#39;s scrupulous survey takes up the interconnected uprisings that engulfed almost all of Europe in 1848. Arguing that they represent “the only truly European revolution that there has ever been,” Clark follows these revolts&#39; trajectories, from heady beginnings, when parliaments were convened and new constitutions proliferated, to counter-revolutionary backlashes. Resisting the “stigma of failure” that has tended to lurk over this period, he insists that it was consequential, calling it “the particle collision chamber at the centre of the European nineteenth century. People, groups and ideas flew into it, crashed together, fused or fragmented, and emerged in showers of new entities whose trails can be traced through the decades that followed.”&lt;/p>;&lt;hr />;&lt;h2 >;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/best-books-2023&quot;>;The Best Books of 2023&lt;/a>;&lt;/h2>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;Briefly Noted Book Reviews&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/63d16763c44837936a5fb854/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/bestbooks-header-2023-desktop.png&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/63d16763c44837936a5fb854/master/w_120,c_limit/bestbooks-header-2023-desktop.png 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/63d16763c44837936a5fb854/master/w_240,c_limit/bestbooks-header-2023-desktop.png 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/63d16763c44837936a5fb854/master/w_320,c_limit/bestbooks-header-2023-desktop.png 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/63d16763c44837936a5fb854/master/w_640,c_limit/bestbooks-header-2023-desktop.png 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/63d16763c44837936a5fb854/master/w_960,c_limit/bestbooks-header-2023-desktop.png 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/63d16763c44837936a5fb854/master/w_1280,c_limit/bestbooks-header-2023-desktop.png 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/63d16763c44837936a5fb854/master/w_1600,c_limit/bestbooks-header-2023-desktop.png 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;p >;&lt;em>;Read our reviews of the year&#39;s notable new fiction and nonfiction.&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>;&lt;hr />;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;Pet by Catherine Chidgey.&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/652ed0bd2decf96c1efd95d0/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/231030_r43249web.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/652ed0bd2decf96c1efd95d0/master/w_120,c_limit/231030_r43249web.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/652ed0bd2decf96c1efd95d0/master/w_240,c_limit/231030_r43249web.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/652ed0bd2decf96c1efd95d0/master/w_320,c_limit/231030_r43249web.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/652ed0bd2decf96c1efd95d0/master/w_640,c_limit/231030_r43249web.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/652ed0bd2decf96c1efd95d0/master/w_960,c_limit/231030_r43249web.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/652ed0bd2decf96c1efd95d0/master/w_1280,c_limit/231030_r43249web.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/652ed0bd2decf96c1efd95d0/master/w_1600,c_limit/231030_r43249web.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;6wmryj&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;d6n86r&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;Pet&lt;/strong>;&lt;em>;, by Catherine Chidgey (Europa)&lt;/em>;. In this suspenseful bildungsroman, Justine, a Catholic schoolgirl living in New Zealand in the nineteen-eighties, searches for a classroom thief, as the school&#39;s suspicions shift from her to her best friend to a glamorous new teacher. Justine&#39;s adolescence is colored by concerns both workaday and personal: a close female friendship, petty teen-age infighting, seizures that disrupt her recall, grief for her recently deceased mother. The novel occasionally jumps forward to 2014, when Justine, now an adult with a daughter of her own, tends to her dementia-stricken father. In these moments, Justine&#39;s girlhood collapses into her present, and she appraises “shimmers in my memory” and revisits the mysteries of her youth.&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;Fire in the Canyon by Daniel Gumbiner.&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/652ed0c3f45a3e98c312b24c/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/231030_r43250web.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/652ed0c3f45a3e98c312b24c/master/w_120,c_limit/231030_r43250web.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/652ed0c3f45a3e98c312b24c/master/w_240,c_limit/231030_r43250web.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/652ed0c3f45a3e98c312b24c/master/w_320,c_limit/231030_r43250web.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/652ed0c3f45a3e98c312b24c/master/w_640,c_limit/231030_r43250web.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/652ed0c3f45a3e98c312b24c/master/w_960,c_limit/231030_r43250web.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/652ed0c3f45a3e98c312b24c/master/w_1280,c_limit/231030_r43250web.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/652ed0c3f45a3e98c312b24c/master/w_1600,c_limit/231030_r43250web.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;Fire in the Canyon&lt;/strong>;&lt;em>;, by Daniel Gumbiner (Astra)&lt;/em>;. Set in the foothills of California&#39;s gold country, this dread-laden novel follows a family who make their living cultivating grapes for winemaking as they attempt to resume their lives in the wake of a wildfire. After an evacuation, they return to the same land, but their environment—increasingly marred by drought, fire, and high temperatures—presents a cascade of fears: not just death and injury from fire but power outages, dangerous air quality, and smoke that might taint their grapes and thus take away their livelihood. The father&#39;s detailed awareness of the region&#39;s weather produces a sense of looming crisis; he notes how often once unusual events now occur—a set of circumstances that make it “hard not to wonder where the bottom was.”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;yjhlil&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 23 Oct 2023 20:06:01 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“Meat Eater No. 5,” by Carmen Maria Machado]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/10/30/meat-eater-no-5-carmen-maria-machado-poem]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-23T10:00:00.000Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5d484e3142f3390009092872/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/hp-poetryspots8.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;article >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attribute-verso-pattern=&quot;article-body&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;ArticlePageChunks&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;figure data-testid=&quot;IframeEmbed&quot; >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;IframeEmbedContainer&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;iframe height=&quot;60&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; sandbox=&quot;allow-scripts allow-same-origin&quot; title=&quot;Embedded Frame&quot; data-src=&quot;https://www.wnyc.org/widgets/ondemand_player/thenewyorker/#file=https://downloads.newyorker.com/mp3/231030_machado_audio.mp3&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay *; encrypted-media *; clipboard-write; autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture&quot;>;&lt;/iframe>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;p>;Read by the author.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;p >; &lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;I realized today that I will die&lt;br/>;with work unfinished, and someone&lt;br/>;will have to find it. I am determined&lt;br/>;to be alone, so who knows who&lt;br/>;will have to sift through it all—fragments&lt;br/>;of pages of nothing, dumb e-mails.&lt;br/>;Will it be a lover? I hate the word&lt;br/>;&lt;em>;lover&lt;/em>;, but one of my lovers loves&lt;br/>;the word &lt;em>;lover&lt;/em>;, and so I can&#39;t escape&lt;br/>;it even though it makes me feel&lt;br/>;beloved. I have a type, and I always&lt;br/>;find them.

I want to say this,&lt;br/>;but I don&#39;t because it would put pressure&lt;br/>;on this nothing. I will die, and someone&lt;br/>;(not them) will have to make sense&lt;br/>;of the unfinished books and juvenilia&lt;br/>;and W-2s and archived Internet journals&lt;br/>;and paper to-do lists (car inspection, playlist&lt;br/>;for K——, digitize to-do list).

Everything changes. That&#39;s the one thing we know for sure in this world,” Calvin says to Hobbes in the first panel of a two-panel strip that ran in more than two thousand newspapers on Monday, July 17, 1995. The two friends are in a wagon, plummeting perilously forward into the unseen—a common pastime for them. Outside the world of the cartoon, it&#39;s less than half a year before Bill Watterson, thirty-seven at the time, will retire from producing his wildly beloved work. “Calvin and Hobbes,” which débuted in 1985, centered on six-year-old Calvin and his best friend, Hobbes, a tiger who to everyone other than Calvin appears to be a stuffed animal. Six days a week, the strip appeared in short form, in black-and-white, and each Sunday it was longer and in color. The second panel of the July 17th strip is wide, with detailed trees in the foreground, the wagon airborne, and Calvin concluding his thought: “But I&#39;m still going to gripe about it.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;After retiring, Watterson assiduously avoided becoming a public figure. He turned his attention to painting, music, and family life. He kept the work he made to himself; he gave few, but not zero, interviews. (When asked in an e-mail interview that ran in 2013 in &lt;em>;Mental Floss&lt;/em>; why he didn&#39;t share his paintings, he replied, “It&#39;s all catch and release—just tiny fish that aren&#39;t really worth the trouble to clean and cook.”) Still, now and again his handiwork appeared. He wrote twice about Charles M. Schulz, the creator of “Peanuts,” whom he never met. For the charity of the cartoonist Richard Thompson, who had been given a diagnosis of Parkinson&#39;s, Watterson illustrated three strips for “Pearls Before Swine,” by Stephan Pastis, and also donated a painting for auction. In other words, he came out for the team.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In 2014, he gave an extensive and chatty interview to Jenny Robb, the curator of the Billy Ireland Cartoon Library and Museum, on the occasion of his second show there. Robb asked if he was surprised that his strip was still so popular. “It seems the less I have to do with it, the higher the strip&#39;s reputation gets!”他说。 In the interview, he comes across as levelheaded, not egotistical, not very pleased with electronic devices, the Internet, the diminished size of cartoons—and also quietly intense, like the dad figure in the strip, who enthusiastically sets out on a bike ride through heavy snow. As a college student at Kenyon, Watterson spent much of a school year painting his dorm-room ceiling like that of the Sistine Chapel, and then, at the end of the year, painted it back dorm-room drab.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;GenericCallout&quot;>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;external-link-embed--inline&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;a aria-label=&quot;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;The Best Books We Read This Week&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.newyorker.com/best-books-2023&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/best-books-2023&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;&lt;span >;&lt;strong>;The Best Books We Read This Week&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/a>;&lt;p >;&lt;em>;Read our reviews of notable new fiction and nonfiction, updated every Wednesday.&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;a aria-label=&quot;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;The Best Books We Read This Week&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.newyorker.com/best-books-2023&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/best-books-2023&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/63c800e4e99d89b838ada996/1:1/w_200%2Cc_limit/undefined&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/63c800e4e99d89b838ada996/1:1/w_120,c_limit/undefined 120w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/a>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;My ten-year-old daughter makes a detailed argument (it involves bicycles, ropes, and scratch marks) that Hobbes is indisputably real; millions of us have the more decisively illusory experience of having grown up with Watterson. But we haven&#39;t! Will we be disturbed if, now that time has passed, he has changed? When word came out that Watterson was releasing a new book this year—“The Mysteries,” a “fable for grown-ups,” written by Watterson and illustrated in collaboration with the renowned caricaturist John Kascht—there was more than passing interest. There were also very few clues about the content, save that there&#39;s a kingdom in trouble, living in fear of mysteries. With a different artist, I might interpret this as an enticement, but it seems more likely that Watterson is merely averse to marketing—he did no publicity for his first “Calvin and Hobbes” collection, and fought for years to prevent Hobbes and Calvin from appearing in snow globes, on pajamas, on chip-bag clips, on trading cards. (“If I&#39;d wanted to sell plush garbage, I&#39;d have gone to work as a carny,” he once said.) Yet Calvin and Hobbes are still everywhere, and forever young. Somewhere on the outskirts of Cleveland, their creator is probably irked that his old characters are pouncing into all these reviews of this other endeavor. As Calvin put it, the universe should have a toll-free hotline for complaints.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“The Mysteries” is clothbound and black, about eight inches square, with gray endpapers. The title font looks medieval; the text font looks contemporary. Words appear on the left page of each spread: one or two sentences in black, surrounded by a field of white. The images appear on the right, taking up most of the page, framed by a thick black line. Some of the illustrations appear to be photographs of small clay sculptures alongside elements composed in graphite and maybe paint—but the materials aren&#39;t specified. Think Chris Van Allsburg&#39;s “Jumanji” gone darker, crossed with Fritz Lang&#39;s “Metropolis.” The characters, unnamed, are drawn from that strange eternal medieval world of fantasy: knights, wizards, a king; peasants with faces like Leonardo grotesques, wearing kerchiefs or hoods. There are forty-three sentences in total, and one exclamation point. The magic of condensation that is characteristic of cartoons is also here, in a story with a quick, fairy-tale beginning: “Long ago, the forest was dark and deep.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;It all sounds rather sombre, but also it doesn&#39;t take long to read it nine or ten times. (The illustrations, slower to process, do much of the storytelling work.) The story is: Unseen mysteries have kept the populace in a state of fear. In response, a king bids his knights to capture a mystery, so that perhaps its “secrets could be learned” and its “powers could be thwarted.” When mysteries are caught, the public finds them disappointing, ordinary. One illustration is of a vender at a newspaper stand, looking askance. Below him are newspapers with headlines such as “So what?,” “Yawn,” and “Boring.” But modern technologies begin to appear: cars, skyscrapers, televisions. Mastering the secrets of the mysteries brought about a lot of technological marvels, and made the people less fearful. Or you might say insufficiently fearful: the woods are cut down, the air becomes acrid, and eventually the land looks prehistoric, desiccated, hostile to life. In one read, “The Mysteries” is a nephew of Dr. Seuss&#39;s “The Lorax.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;It&#39;s also kin to the ancient story of Prometheus, a myth we now associate with technological advancements. Prometheus took pity on the struggling humans, and stole fire from the gods to share it with them. And how has that magnificently useful fire gone for the humans? Pretty well by some measures, pretty catastrophically by others. If only humans heeded the warnings within mysteries as well as they followed the blueprints for making Teflon pans and missiles. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll spoil the plot of “The Mysteries” if I say that the story finds a distinctive and unsettling path to its final three words, which are “happily ever after.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;“It&#39;s a funny world, Hobbes,” Calvin says, plummeting again down a hill in a wagon with his friend. “But it&#39;s not a hilarious world,” he says, as they fall out of their wagon. “Unless you like sick humor,” Hobbes says after he and Calvin have both crashed to the ground.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Watterson has said, of the illustrations in “Calvin and Hobbes,” “One of the jokes I really like is that the fantasies are drawn more realistically than reality, since that says a lot about what&#39;s going on in Calvin&#39;s head.” Only one reality in “Calvin and Hobbes” is drawn with a level of detail comparable to the scenes of Calvin&#39;s imagination: the natural world. The woods, the streams, the snowy hills the friends career off—the natural world is a space as enchanted and real as Hobbes himself.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Enchantment! If disenchantment is the loss of myth and illusion in our lives, then what is the chant that calls those essentials back? An ongoing enchantment is at the heart of “Calvin and Hobbes.” It&#39;s at the heart of “Don Quixote” and “Peter Pan,” too. These are stories about difficult and not infrequently destructive characters who are lost in their own worlds. At the same time, these characters embody most of what is good: the gifts of play, of the inner life, of imagining something other than what is there. If “The Mysteries” is a fable, then its moral might be that, when we believe we&#39;ve understood the mysteries, we are misunderstanding; when we think we&#39;ve solved them and have moved on, that error can be our dissolution.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Calvin offers the means of enchantment for seeing reality properly. This is well illustrated in the June 3, 1995, daily. (The brief black-and-white weekday strips of “Calvin and Hobbes” often feel as whole as the epic Sunday ones.) Calvin is digging a deep hole and Hobbes asks why. Calvin answers that he&#39;s looking for buried treasure. Has he found any? Calvin replies, “A few dirty rocks, a weird root, and some disgusting grubs.” In the final panel, Hobbes: “On your first try??” Calvin: “There&#39;s treasure everywhere!”&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;While rereading “Calvin and Hobbes” comics for this piece, I was surprised that almost all of them were not entirely forgotten. If I saw them on a crowded subway platform, I would recognize them, even after years of separation. Some of the silliest and most untethered of the strips have stayed with me the most: one in which Hobbes repeats the word “smock” again and again, just happy to say it; another in which Calvin writes down, “How many boards would the Mongol hoard, if the Mongol hordes got bored?”—then crumples up the paper.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Watterson has written, “Whenever the strip got ponderous, I put Calvin and Hobbes in their wagon and send them over a cliff. It had a nice way of undercutting the serious subjects.” “The Mysteries” doesn&#39;t entirely lack that lightness—the contrast of modern and medieval in the illustrations is often funny—but humor is not its main tool. Reading “The Mysteries” after rereading “Calvin and Hobbes” reminded me of the Brothers Grimm story “The Goblins.” Goblins steal a mother&#39;s child and replace it with a ravenous changeling. When the woman asks a neighbor for advice on how to get her child back, she is told to make the changeling laugh, because “when a changeling laughs, that&#39;s the end of him.” She makes him laugh (by boiling water in eggshells? A trick perhaps lost across the centuries), and the goblins take the changeling away and return her child. She counters tragedy with a deliberate silliness—and it succeeds, even as the dark persists. In that sense, the old strip and the new fable work best, maybe, together. I&#39;m also reminded of the strip in which Hobbes says, “I suppose if we couldn&#39;t laugh at things that don&#39;t make sense, we couldn&#39;t react to a lot of life.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;One of the cozy pleasures of “Calvin and Hobbes” is the prominence of the seasons. This was felt even more acutely when the comics appeared daily in the paper, as they did throughout my childhood, when my brother used to call the Sunday comics insert “the intellectual pages.” (Now we both read the nearly comic-free online news instead of the material papers, into which, Watterson has said, “little jokes” were placed as a respite from “atrocities described in the rest of the newspaper.”) In the fall, a leaf pile transforms into a Calvin-eating monster; in winter, Calvin sculpts a snowman swimming away from snow-shark fins; spring is rainy, and in summer the days are just packed. Time hurries along through the year, but the years never pass—a great comfort. In “The Mysteries,” time&#39;s arrow can&#39;t be missed for a moment. Though the story starts in the misty forever-medieval, it quickly javelins forward. By its close, aeons have passed, and the perspective is no longer even earthbound. The book reads like someone saying goodbye. The outcome feels inevitable.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Calvin isn&#39;t the only comic-strip character who doesn&#39;t age. The characters in “Peanuts” never grow up, either. Schulz drew the strip for fifty years, and the final strip was published the day after he died. George Herriman drew “Krazy Kat” for more than thirty years, through to the year of his death, 1944. The characters in “Krazy Kat” also didn&#39;t age or really change much: Krazy Kat is a black cat forever in love with Ignatz, a white mouse who serially hits Krazy with bricks, an action that Krazy misinterprets as a sign of love. Watterson has expressed admiration for both Schulz and Herriman. Yet Watterson, after ten years, moved on to other interests.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Schulz and Peanuts: A Biography,” by David Michaelis, makes vivid that no amount of success ever separated Schulz from his sense of himself, carried over from childhood, as a lonely and overlooked “nothing.” In 2007, Watterson reviewed the biography for the &lt;em>;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em>;, and reminded readers that “Peanuts” had as much darkness—fear, sadness, bullying—as it had charm. “Schulz illustrates the conflict in his life, not in a self-justifying or vengeful manner but with a larger human understanding that implicates himself in the sad comedy,” Watterson wrote. “I think that&#39;s a wonderfully sane way to process a hurtful world.” Herriman, born in the nineteenth century in New Orleans to a mixed-race family, often presented himself, in his adult life, as Greek. It would be oversimplifying to say that Herriman&#39;s background fuelled “Krazy Kat,” just as it would be oversimplifying to say that Schulz was forever a Charlie Brown—but it would be delusional to think that the persistent situations and sentiments of those comics weren&#39;t inflected by their makers&#39; lives. As Krazy Kat put it, in that magic mixed-up Kat language, “An&#39; who but me can moddil for me, but I!”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Watterson must have been working out something in his strip, too. By his own account, he had a pretty nice childhood, with supportive parents and a house that bordered a mysterious wood. It&#39;s possible that Watterson quit because he tired of the demanding work, or because he&#39;d said all he had to say, or because he was worn out by the legal battles over his characters. But maybe he just changed. Growing up is always a loss—a loss of an enchanted way of seeing, at the very least—and for some people growing up is more of a loss than for others. Perhaps part of what drove Watterson, “Ahab-like” by his own telling, back to the drawing board with his boy and his tiger day after day was a subconscious commitment to staying a child. Maybe he chose to stop publishing because, in some way, for whatever reasons, he became OK with growing up.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In a Sunday strip on April 22, 1990, Calvin&#39;s dad tells Calvin and Hobbes a bedtime story, by request, that is about Calvin and Hobbes. All he does, pretty much, is describe, to his rapt audience, the first part of their actual day. Calvin complains that his dad ends the story too early, that he hasn&#39;t even gotten to lunchtime. His dad says the story has no end, because Calvin and Hobbes will go on writing it “tomorrow and every day after.” The friends are pleased to learn they&#39;re in a story that doesn&#39;t end.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Here&#39;s another story, kindred to “The Mysteries,” about a knight who journeys into a dark and unknown wood. The first scene of “Sir Gawain and the Green Knight,” which is thought to have been written in the late fourteenth century, takes place in Camelot during New Year&#39;s festivities. A good time, with feasting and friends, is interrupted by the arrival of a stranger: a massive knight, whose skin and hair are all green, who is dressed all in green, who is riding an all-green horse. The knight carries a huge axe and makes a strange proposal, in such a way that the honor of the whole court feels at stake. He invites someone to swing at his neck with his axe; in return, he will have a chance, a year and a day later, to swing the same axe at the neck of the volunteer, who ends up being Sir Gawain. The resonance of the story with facing the perils of a dark and unknown wood, of nature itself, is pretty clear.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Gawain chops off the head of the Green Knight, who then picks up his head; says, See you in a year; and rides away. Pretty quickly, the feasting and the merry mood return. How, I remember thinking the first time I read the tale, could this possibly end? It&#39;s not satisfying if the Green Knight is killed, or if Gawain is. Maybe both of them die, I supposed.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;But no. Gawain keeps his word, despite the perilous terms. En route to his meeting with the Green Knight, in the Green Chapel, he tries to behave well with the seductive wife of the lord who graciously hosts him. Then he bravely bares his neck for the terrifying Green Knight—but he learns it was an enchantment! To me, the ending follows from both good behavior and enchantment—good behavior being something Calvin despises, and enchantment being the realm in which he is king. ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot;

refers to the “airy weight” of DeFeo&#39;s photographs, and that oxymoronic phrase strikes me as just right. Even when DeFeo is making pictures of solid, very ordinary things—a crab shell, a chandelier, a wooden staircase, a woman&#39;s tattered shoe—the results look like they were captured in a dream, not ephemeral but haunted.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot;
