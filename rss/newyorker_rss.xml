data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;关于 Velvet Underground 官方盗版歌曲“Live at Max&#39;s Kansas City”，录制于 8 月 23 日，1970 年，您可以在某一时刻听到作者和市中心的面孔&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2010/12/06/off-the-rim&quot;>;吉姆·卡罗尔&lt;/ a>;，在观众席上，请某人去给他拿一杯“双倍保乐力加”，然后与路过的毒贩互动。 “你有沮丧吗？”他说。 “它是什么？图纳尔？赶紧给我。”那天晚上，乐队的曲目包括《New Age》和《Beginning to See the Light》，但没有人会把他们苍白的喧嚣误认为是十九世纪六十年代甜美的和声和更甜美的乐观情绪。在这个肮脏的密室里，性、毒品和摇滚乐并不预示着某个空灵的乌托邦的黎明；相反，它是一个充满希望的地方。气氛是新的、黑暗的。分解。雾化。严重的麻醉品。 《Live at Max&#39;s》由 Brigid Berlin 录制，她曾是&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/06/08/untangling-andy-warhol&quot;>;安迪·沃霍尔&lt;/a >; 他的父亲是赫斯特公司的总裁。她的沃霍尔姓氏是布里吉德·波尔克 (Brigid Polk)，因她习惯用装有安非他明的注射器随意戳人而得名。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;上流社会和下流社会、顶层公寓和人行道的混合，是周围场景的显着标志，那里有一种对低俗事物的自觉的自豪感。 “人渣”和“朋克”是褒义词。价值观被颠覆，就像&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/08/11/enfants-terribles&quot;>;Genet&lt;/a>;：正直社会认为无可救药的低级，却被抬高。人们在路易十六的凡尔赛宫里以射击场和游轮为背景，像法国小贵族一样尽情玩乐。 1970 年夏天，这个特殊地下乐队的双性恋外表和奢侈道德即将成为主流，被誉为“魅力摇滚”。 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/sasha-frere-jones/postscript-lou-reed&quot;>;卢·里德&lt;/a>;是其模棱两可的君主。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;他出生于布鲁克林，但在长岛弗里波特长大。他有一个妹妹，玛格丽特·艾伦，后来成为一名家庭治疗师，并改名为梅里尔。他的父母托比和西德尼是逃离东欧反犹太主义的犹太移民的孩子。西德尼的原姓是拉比诺维茨（Rabinowitz）；在联邦调查局询问他曾为一个工会做过一些会计工作后，他将其改为里德。据除了他自己之外的每个人说，卢一直有一个基本正常而快乐的童年，直到他十几岁或十几岁左右。他受过成人礼。他在学校很受欢迎，喜欢运动和自动点唱机流行音乐，并被称为“化妆唐璜”。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;里德的单曲流行歌曲“Walk on the Wild Side”——排名第一。 1973 年，《告示牌》百强单曲榜上排名第 16 位——讲述的是人们像朝圣者一样跃入纽约，夺取迄今为止只存在于脑海中的生活的故事。 “这里喧嚣，那里喧嚣/纽约市是……的地方。 。 ”。他在二十出头的时候对这段旅程进行了自己的简化版本，最终在勒德洛街 56 号的一间阁楼里定居下来，在那里他与另一位来自更远地方的流亡者住在一起：这位阴郁的、受过古典训练的威尔士人 &lt;a href=&quot;https:/ /www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/01/30/john-cales-inventive-retrospection&quot;>;约翰·卡尔&lt;/a>;。卡尔一年前抵达美国，在坦格尔伍德音乐中心师从作曲家亚伦·科普兰学习。他涉足各种前卫派，并向里德介绍了约翰·凯奇和拉蒙特·扬的左场音乐，以及皮耶罗·赫利泽和杰克·史密斯等越野电影制作人。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>; Velvet Underground——Reed、Cale、鼓手 Moe Tucker 和吉他手 Sterling Morrison，后来又补充了德国歌手 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/books/under-review/the-misunderstood-voice -of-nico&quot;>;Nico&lt;/a>;——成为了一个以沃霍尔为中心的场景的室内乐队，沃霍尔是乐队事实上的经理：实验电影档案管理员和概念艺术家、骗子和经销商、专业演讲者的紧张蒙太奇，歌剧迷。许多追随者是如此时髦，以至于著名艺术家纷纷模仿他们，而不是相反。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;在表演中，地下丝绒乐队恪守着当时对摇滚乐不熟悉的原则。别显得你太努力了。不要看起来像穿着舞台服装。不要表现得好像你关心观众离开时是否留下​​深刻印象。里德唱的是关于毒品和性实验的歌曲，他的歌词处理了尖锐的细节，而不是模糊的概括，这是他从他最喜欢的一些作家那里学到的技巧：&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/ 2014/02/03/the-outlaw&quot;>;威廉·S·巴勒斯&lt;/a>;、约翰·雷奇、休伯特·塞尔比。他还吸收了伦尼·布鲁斯尖锐的方言，并在注定失败的纽约诗人身上找到了某种导师&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/personal-history/delmore-schwartz-and-the -传记作者-痴迷&quot;>;德尔莫·施瓦茨&lt;/a>;。 （他和施瓦茨第一次见面是在一家酒吧；里德后来报名参加了施瓦茨在雪城大学的文学课程。施瓦茨于 1966 年在时代广场的一家酒店去世，享年 52 岁。） 《m Waiting for the Man》和《Venus in Furs》因比摇滚乐更“真实”而受到赞誉。&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >; &lt;/div>;&lt;p>;沃霍尔向他的小圈子赠送了自我认定的“超级明星”——&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/the-tropic-appeal-of-warhols-工厂&quot;>;Ondine&lt;/a>;、Ultra Violet、Candy Darling——一种开放获取的明星形象，但又不稳定、脆弱、不稳定。来自不同恒星系统的卫星绕着他干燥、死气沉沉的卫星运行。再加上严重的集体滥用药物，每个人的生活都变得衣衫褴褛、全天候（24/7）。一场存在主义的冒险——酷到生死攸关。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;当神话成为你日常生活的一部分时会发生什么？对于卢·里德 (Lou Reed) 的任何传记作者来说，这都是一个难题，包括最新的摇滚评论家威尔·赫尔墨斯 (Will Hermes)，他是一本名为“&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Lou-Reed-”的大型新编年史的作者。 King-New-York-ebook/dp/B0BQGK1K5D&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Lou-Reed -King-New-York-ebook/dp/B0BQGK1K5D&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Lou-Reed-King-New-York-ebook/dp/B0BQGK1K5D&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;卢·里德：纽约之王&lt;/a>;”——有时里德拥抱他的角色，并尽可能地发挥它，有时他说话时就好像他只是其痛苦的受害者。七十年代，对里德的报道在二元论之间摇摆不定，有时在同一篇文章中：严肃的艺术家与卑鄙的骗子，勇敢的说真话者与狡猾的商人。 1975 年，他告诉 Lenny Kaye：“我可能比任何人都模​​仿得更好，”他补充道，“我创造了卢·里德 (Lou Reed)。我和那个家伙没有任何共同点，但我可以很好地扮演他。”基思·理查兹 (Keith Richards) 将米克·贾格尔 (Mick Jagger) 描述为“一群好人”——更新了萨克斯演奏家祖特·西姆斯 (Zoot Sims) 曾经对斯坦·盖茨 (Stan Getz) 的俏皮话——但贾格尔是一位意志坚定的社交牛虻，他的目标是非常具体的奖品。相比之下，我们不清楚里德对自己的权力游戏施加了多大的控制，以及这让他快乐或不快乐。 1973 年杂色的《柏林》，到五年后粗糙的现场演出《Take No Prisoners》，还是同年 1975 年推出不人道的《金属机器音乐》和温柔的《康尼岛宝贝》？对于音乐作家莱斯特·邦斯（Lester Bangs）等痴迷者来说，里德一半是先知，一半是小丑。邦斯专门为里德撰写了一系列文章，无论它们有什么缺陷——包括对瑞秋·汉弗莱斯（Rachel Humphreys）的一些非常冒犯的言论，瑞秋·汉弗莱斯是里德在 1973 年至 1978 年间与她一起生活和工作的跨性别女性——但它们为这个男人提供了一种其他人没有的感觉。走近一点。邦斯以卓越的表现描绘了一幅速度狂人的肖像：一个行动方针的三种不同理由可能会在一个晚上提出，每一种理由都在它提出的那一刻被相信。是里德的毒瘾助长了这场演讲，还是他疯狂地服用兴奋剂以实现神话？他的粉丝崇拜他的原因之一正是：私人自我和投射形象之间的差距就像勺子里的药丸一样消失了。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;里德的大多数标志性形象都呈现出某种不变的外观：他的大，毛坯，花岗岩面；皮革;色调。这是一个没有感觉的人，还是一个害怕感觉太多的人？凶狠的眼神，还是麻醉般的冷漠？他是那些带着孩子气的人之一，他受到了严重的伤害，以至于从未完全康复。总是测试朋友的诚意，就像时髦的测谎仪一样。他们曾经踩在蛋壳上的东西现在让其他人踩在上面。&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;里德与父亲的关系似乎是关键。唉，在传记中，他的童年在我们不知不觉中就过去了——在我们意识到之前，他正在和女孩约会，组建团体，吸毒。就在他十八岁生日即将到来之际，他遭受了严重的精神崩溃，他的父母被说服用电休克疗法来治疗。赫尔墨斯对这一事件的处理有点过于谨慎；他引用了一段很长的话：“&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Bell-Jar-Modern-Classics/dp/0060837020&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot; :&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Bell-Jar-Modern-Classics/dp/0060837020&quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/ Bell-Jar-Modern-Classics/dp/0060837020&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;钟形罩&lt;/a>;”做了很多繁重的工作。里德后来声称 ECT 的目的是“治愈”他的同性恋倾向，但他的妹妹（似乎是这里更可靠的证人之一）否认了这一点，并且没有证据支持这一点。无论出于何种原因，这次治疗成为他一生中的决定性时刻。赫尔墨斯将其描述为“里德神话的一部分”。梅里尔，在&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/cuepoint/a-family-in-peril-lou-reed-s-sister-sets-the-record-straight-about-his-childhood-20e8399f84a3 &quot;>;2015 年发表的文章&lt;/a>;写道，“从开始那些悲惨的治疗那天起，我们的家庭就四分五裂了。”&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>; &lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;歌曲是给压抑的孩子的一份礼物，让他可以让情感自由飞翔。摇滚乐诞生时是一种爆炸​​性的宣泄，但它也带来了一些其他的东西，一些新的东西：年轻人，通常来自朴素的背景，凭空变出美丽，音调混合，和谐。里德和凯尔的严酷关系与当时的其他男性伙伴相呼应，包括列侬和麦卡特尼、贾格尔和理查兹、布莱恩·威尔逊和他的兄弟，这些都是乐队的不同声音。里德最初喜爱的音乐是 doo-wop。十几岁的时候，他与一个名为“Shades”的新兴乐队一起录制唱片，弹吉他并伴唱。 Doo-wop 团体通常是黑人或拉丁裔，而且通常都是女性。这一流派以其他边缘化的声音而自豪，其独特的美学一半是神圣的，一半是世俗的。这与自夸相反，是对 45 的一种简短的、幽灵般的遐想。对于有抱负的词曲作者里德来说，一个重要的教训是，世界上最柔和的歌曲可能很容易暗示最残酷的事实。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;尽管如此里德以描绘极端的人类状态而闻名，但里德最受欢迎的一些歌曲——《I&#39;ll Be Your Mirror》、《Pale Blue Eyes》、《Candy Says》、《Perfect Day》、《Berlin》——却同样不摇滚。并尽可能地滚动。它们像悲伤的幽灵一样掠过你的聆听心情；有时他们感觉就像祈祷一样。以 1972 年专辑“Transformer”中的“Perfect Day”为例。温柔，徘徊，令人着迷的暧昧，它可能是关于海洛因成瘾或家庭满足或被破坏的梦想或其他东西。如果用来自另一个时代的歌手轻快的语气来表达，那就更具毁灭性了。 （英国音乐家米克·罗森 (Mick Ronson) 精确而美妙的编曲起到了帮助作用。） 里德与贝蒂·克朗斯塔德 (Bettie Kronstad) 一起创作了这首歌曲，他们是在 1968 年认识的，当时她还是哥伦比亚大学的一名 19 岁的本科生。 （他们在《变形金刚》发行后的第二年结婚并离婚。）起初，这首歌被称为“Just a Summer&#39;s Day”，但里德令人难忘的尾声“你将收获/正如你所播种的那样，”它变成了变成更令人不安的事情。里德善于用言语节约开支。他经常写得像在给新情人发电报一样。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;然而，1979 年我有一次看到他现场表演时，他把所有那些神奇的歌曲简化为一种没有灵魂的锻炼——圆滑、装甲、夸夸其谈，因此被过度放大，夜晚变成了一场严峻的耐力考验。这感觉很不愉快，就像一种私人的蔑视和控制行为。就好像他不想让我们从他的艺术中得到任何乐趣。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;第二年，里德发行了一张名为“Growing Up in Public”的专辑，这是他已经做了一段时间的事情，当时音乐界还没有“注意义务”之类的概念。自我药疗是我们现在用来描述人们如何应对来自内部和外部的难以承受的压力的短语。 （1982 年，刘海显然是因服用过量药物而意外死亡。）赫尔墨斯对于里德在中年参加 AA 会议后最终在多大程度上变得干净和清醒这一点含糊其辞；他对里德的态度含糊其辞。在书的最后，他以一种不和谐的随意性指出，里德“有时仍然会喝酒。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;里德的私生活充满了矛盾，但有一件事是明确的：他从来不想成为一名父亲。他不想重塑自己的家庭生活。 （“但是，爸爸，我知道这次访问是一个错误/除了我们的名字，我们没有任何共同点，”他在 1979 年专辑《The Bells》中被低估的 Reed 歌曲之一《Families》中唱道。 ”）他坚决不做父母可能值得一些反思，但赫尔墨斯或多或少地以半开玩笑的方式忽略了这一事实，即里德更喜欢养宠物。从这本书中你只能得到最微弱的感觉，为什么有人会容忍里德作为家庭伴侣。卢在晚年与艺术家兼音乐家劳里·安德森 (Laurie Anderson) 结婚之前的生活一瞥：闷闷不乐、怒目而视、暴躁、醉酒昏倒或发脾气。&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline- recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;克朗斯塔德和继她之后的浪漫伴侣汉弗莱斯在书页上感觉比里德更有活力，里德与他们明显的人性品质相反，仍然是一个锁着的箱子。值得赞扬的是赫尔墨斯，关于汉弗莱斯的部分是书中最生动的部分之一。里德对他们的关系结束的原因保持沉默，但她彻底转变的愿望可能是决定性的。当谈到里德的性取向时，赫尔墨斯并没有深入挖掘，这也许是可以理解的；如果没有过度的贪欲，就很难对他人的私密生活进行猜测。但这本书对“性别流动”和“非二元”等更为流行的术语的依赖，感觉就像是贴在不透明表面上的贴花，没有现实生活中的淤泥或土壤。里德曾一度声称自己是“百分百的同性恋者”，并且在 1978 年的一次采访中，他以看似故意暗示的方式声称自己“从上到下”都是同性恋。他没有提到的是，他当时正在与即将成为他第二任妻子的西尔维娅·莫拉莱斯同居。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;赫尔墨斯在第 304 页（大约是全书的三分之二）描述了这次采访。我忧心忡忡地在页边空白处写下：“我们还只是在 1978 年。”记录六七十年代的细节占据了传记的大部分内容，其他书籍也涵盖了这一点——其中一些非常好，包括玛丽·沃罗诺夫（Mary Woronov）的“&lt;a data-offer-url =“https://www .amazon.com/Swimming-Underground-Years-Warhol-Factory/dp/1885203217&quot;

rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;禅宗的威尔士语&lt;/a >;。”赫尔墨斯大量引用了这些作品和其他作品，也引用了许多其他摇滚作家的作品。它很慷慨，但会给他自己的写作带来一点不人性化的感觉。在维基百科时代，这种传记中常见的事实整理可能是多余的，因为当时的设置列表、设备详细信息以及比特玩家的胶囊简介都可以在网上找到。赫尔墨斯建造了一条坚固的大道，但经过的风景中神秘的空洞仍未被探索。&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:自动&quot;

data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;在八十年代，Reed 出现在本田踏板车广告中并获得“Walk on the Wild Side”的授权，震惊了一些粉丝”以供现场使用。 Hermes 将这则广告描述为“迄今为止对里德音乐最美观有效的电影呈现”，并指出对于一位受 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com 指导的艺术家来说，此举并不令人意外。 /magazine/2010/01/11/top-of-the-pops&quot;>;沃霍尔&lt;/a>;。 （里德后来也与美国运通公司达成了协议。）在本世纪初，里德的音乐通过与吉他手罗伯特·奎因的合作而重新焕发活力。 20世纪末，里德凭借《纽约》获得了巨大的评论和商业成功，这是他长期以来最具说服力的个人和政治作品。他似乎对世界和其他人更加开放，更少陷入自己神话的漩涡中。他与 Cale 重聚，录制了《Songs for Drella》，这是对 1987 年去世的沃霍尔的亲密而感人的致敬。这种不太可能的缓和导致了最初的 Velvet Underground 阵容的一系列现场表演的尝试性改革，但是，里德和他的合作者（包括蒯因）经常发生这样的事情，事情变得糟糕、变得暴躁、停滞不前。乐队的其他成员都很和蔼、谨慎，但足以给人留下略带贵族气息的里德印象，他粗鲁、不妥协。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;然后，他在一次实验音乐节上遇到了劳里·安德森(Laurie Anderson)。他们在一起二十一年，是他一生中最长的一段关系。赫尔墨斯在这里有点挣扎——在页面上唤起家庭满足感比从射击速度中再记录一个脓肿更难。它的卷须是关怀、妥协和相互尊重；它被建造、交换、想象成生活。它很杂乱，也没有方便的流行语来涵盖它的回报。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;与安德森的后期救赎弧线令人振奋，但你确实得到的印象是里德为艺术界的同行保留了他温暖而模糊的一面皇室成员，只让愤怒先生去对付仆人。在他的作品中，里德能够表现出令人眼花缭乱的同理心和温柔。在他的生活中，并没有那么多。他的脾气一触即发，而且因对服务人员粗鲁和随意而名声不佳。最后，他成为那些飞遍世界各地、在彼此大型企业赞助的多媒体作品中客串的艺术家之一。他在欧洲受到尊敬和尊敬；他和一位崇拜的瓦茨拉夫·哈维尔 (Václav Havel) 一起出去玩&lt;/a>; 在布拉格；他和安德森在当地的小酒馆招待尼古拉·萨科齐“和女歌手卡拉·布吕尼”。晚餐后，他们和伍迪·艾伦一起在卡莱尔咖啡馆度过了一个狂野的爵士乐之夜。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;赫尔墨斯叙述中最生动的时刻出现在本书的开头和里德生命的结尾。 2013 年，里德去世前两天，他漂浮在“东汉普顿家后面温水游泳池的淡蓝色水中”。里德极度虚弱，靠着朋友朱利安·施纳贝尔粗壮的手臂支撑着，他的思绪飘回了他在长岛南岸的童年。他告诉施纳贝尔，有一次当一家人在海滩上时，里德深情地握住了他父亲的手。他说，他得到了回报，脸上被打了一巴掌。他的妹妹对这种情况提出异议，称他们的父亲从未向任何人举手。但这是里德在七十一岁时因肝病临终时的脑海中的形象。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;可以将里德视为一个尝试过各种面具和角色的人。但他的生活基本上保持不变。内心深处的非父亲——一种被忽视或被玩弄但从未改变的核心症状。 2011年，也就是他因肝病去世的前两年，他与重金属乐队Metallica合作推出了专辑《Lulu》。这张专辑受到了许多评论家的批评，歌迷们对此仍存在分歧，但正如赫尔墨斯所说，这张专辑有一首无可争议的精彩歌曲，即最后一首十九分钟的歌曲“Junior Dad”。沉思、蜿蜒、幸福，它让我们回到里德六十年代初与凯尔和拉蒙特·杨的会面，以及他们用音乐无人机改变时间的实验。一首关于中阴或来世的海上颂歌，一首关于父子、衰老和爱情的循环咒语——就像一份至高无上的遗嘱，令人深深感动。是不是只有在这里，当“爸爸”这个词终于被发音出来时，里德的内心才放松下来，呼出一口气，自由地游动？这一切都在一首辉煌的、海洋般的歌曲中表达出来了？&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;1996 年，我在里德的专辑《Set the Twilight Reeling》之际接受了一次长达四十五分钟的新闻采访时见过他一次。那时我的身体状况并不好——你知道，当卢·里德比你健康时，事情就很糟糕了——但我记得最清楚的是他的眼睛。我感觉到他正试图露出他那标志性的恶狠狠的眼神，但他的心不在其中。我想知道，不仅要应对媒体义务，还要应对普通的社交场合，就好像你独自一人在敌人的丛林中一样，感觉如何？当一场谈话出现在你面前时，就像是用界桩、带刺铁丝网、沾满了很久以前打斗留下的羊毛和血迹的东西一样？现在，多年后，重播这部电影，根据我对童年伤害、毒瘾和康复的了解，我突然意识到，在虚张声势之下，他实际上看起来很害怕。 ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;41ndl&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;

aria-hidden=&quot; true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;如今，更成熟的文学产业可能不太可能聘请代笔来模仿已故作家的作品；相反，他们授权知名作家以自己的名义继续创作（并分享封面信用）。无缝过渡的前提，即原作者在不被注意的情况下溜进来世，已经被​​弗兰肯斯坦式的生者与死者的嵌合体所取代。在这种情况下，我们看到苏菲·汉娜为阿加莎·克里斯蒂写作，塞巴斯蒂安·福克斯为伊恩·弗莱明写作，布兰登·桑德森被罗伯特·乔丹的继承人选中继续未完成的奇幻系列《时间之轮》。 （在更崇高的层面上，本月出版的桑德拉·纽曼的《朱莉娅》是对乔治·奥威尔的《1984》的授权“女权主义重述”。）这种合作往往是尊重的、相当成功的，并且受到积极评价，但经常会出现这样的情况：尽管如此，他们身上还是有一些令人不安的死气沉沉的东西。和所有不死生物一样，书中复活的主角只能自由地执行一些有限的行动，他们在生前所采取的行动的影子重复——解开谜团、代表英国进行间谍活动、引导单一力量。阅读这些文章时，很难不想象那些看不见的权威在作者身后窥视，并怀疑他们善意的限度。&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;当创造力受到权威冷冰冰的触碰时所产生的颤抖与所涉及的个人无关。作为一名改编雪莉·杰克逊小说的编剧，我与杰克逊庄园的人们有过一些接触，（我发誓）他们都很棒。但官方续集和衍生作品的创作不可避免地会受到代理、权力和控制问题的困扰。与伊丽莎白·汉德一起踏上希尔豪斯之旅，让人想起天才的统治地位，它既建立又打破自己的规则，诱惑然后困住那些敢于遵循规则的人。忠实遵守规则并不能保证成功，但违反规则将不可避免地招致失败和背叛的指控。每个到达《山上鬼魂》希望回到原来的山屋的读者都会以自己的方式感到失望，尽管她失望的形式更多地说明了她对杰克逊的忠诚本质，而不是她的品质。新书。也许不足为奇的是，当汉德直接模仿杰克逊时，《山上鬼魂》最不成功，而当她利用自己的才能时，《山上鬼魂》最成功——而当汉德让那些关于权威和影响力的焦虑低语接管故事时，它变得真正令人着迷。&lt;/ p>;&lt;p>;杰克逊的《希尔屋闹鬼》的前提是，四个陌生人聚集在一起，对以闹鬼而闻名的希尔屋进行超自然现象调查。汉德的《山上鬼魂》的前提是四个朋友聚在一起租用山屋，以便花一些时间创作戏剧。毫无疑问，这栋房子是同一栋房子，从它的名字、它的位置（希尔斯代尔镇）和它的布局就可以清楚地看出。那只手可以如此明确地表达这一点，这是完全授权的特权之一——她不需要浪费任何时间来归档序列号。年表也相同。人们偶尔提到“山屋闹鬼”的事件：“她的丈夫建造了这个地方，她的马车撞到了一棵树，她被杀了。那是在 1880 年。大约六十年前，另一名妇女因她的车撞上同一棵树而丧生。同样的事情又发生在另一个八十年代的女人身上。他们终于把树砍倒了。”中间的女人是《鬼屋》的主人公埃莉诺·万斯；通过如此迅速地抛弃她，汉德确定了这座房子才是这场秀的真正明星。但也存在一种明显的不适，即这些事件如何被置之不理，夹在另外两起死亡事件之间，然后用一个笑话来驳回。 “这听起来不像闹鬼。 。 。听起来像是糟糕的车道设计，”旁白说道，她是一位四十多岁的剧作家，名叫霍莉·舍温 (Holly Sherwin)，她希望通过一部名为《巫术之夜》的怪异剧来重振自己平淡的职业生涯。&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;杰克逊的小说《希尔之家》与许多死亡和令人不安的事件有关，在那里过夜的唯一原因是你想遇到一个鬼魂。几十年后，当霍莉和她的朋友出现时，死亡人数只增不减，这就是为什么这里是开发“巫术之夜”的完美地点。但随后我们就遇到了恐怖电影的动态，屏幕上的人们忽视了观众中的人们所看到的极其明显的事情。角色们一遍又一遍地遭遇明确的恐怖，但又以某种方式消除它们。 “闹鬼了？”一个角色说。 “这里没有人见过鬼，如果你是这个意思的话。”后来，她说，“人们对此做出了自己的解释。老房子可能会很吵。”与此同时，客人们看着野兔从壁炉里跑出来，超自然的门口出现在他们的床边。他们说：“这里没有任何&lt;em>;明显&lt;/em>;错误”，因为明显的错误还在继续增加。&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;

>;&lt; /div>;&lt;p>;这里有一种悲凉而富有同情心的承认，无论我们多么渴望能够跨越界限进入别人的故事，或者保证我们可以保留对自己故事的控制，写作的前景仍然是危险的。它的规则还很不成熟。完全服从是不可能的，但违反仍然会导致痛苦和惩罚。从这个意义上说，没有一本小说是真正被授权的——故事的控制权从每个作家的手中消失，哪怕只有当她的控制因死亡而松动时。现在《希尔之家》已经加入了经典，有些人会得到许可进入，而另一些人会不请自来——但作家们总是会在彼此的故事中徘徊，凝视镜子，用手指抚摸堆积的灰尘。 ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;6fd0r6&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;

aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>; The story has a somewhat grim setup, but is full of humor—a shared humor between son and father (especially when it comes to Gilbert and Sullivan!). They don&#39;t speak a lot, but they communicate. How tough is it to convey the unspoken emotional subcurrents when writing a story like this?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;For me, not very tough. Gruff fathers and recalcitrant sons, grumpy old men and damaged young men: these are recurring characters for me. Even when I was a twentysomething, I was writing about grumpy old men. There are bedraggled, embittered fathers in two early plays of mine: one who deserts his family and is discovered, years later, having hanged himself in a flophouse, in “The Chang Fragments”; and an old Filipino who is traced by his abandoned son to a home for aged Jews, in “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Version-3-0-Contemporary-Asian-American/dp/1559363630&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Version-3-0-Contemporary-Asian-American/dp/1559363630&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Version-3-0-Contemporary-Asian-American/dp/1559363630&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;Swoony Planet&lt;/a>;.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;A note about “The Mikado”: it&#39;s my favorite Gilbert and Sullivan, as it is for the father in the story. For some time, I&#39;d held on to this idea—an Asian-American father and son who unrepentantly love the racially problematic operetta—as the main plot of a short story, but I lacked a second idea against which it would spark; I worried, also, that the subject was too on the nose. But as one small thread in a story, as it is in “I Am Pizza Rat,” I think it works.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;As for the humor, I credit it partly to a &lt;em>;Times&lt;/em>; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/02/world/europe/netherlands-falling-elderly.html&quot;>;article&lt;/a>; about Dutch seniors who are learning the “correct” way to fall, which was the inspiration for the Falling Naturally class in “I Am Pizza Rat.” Because that part of the world ably handles such issues as health care and senior care, the tone of the article was somewhat buoyant, though the subject matter was not. And the seniors profiled in the story were full of good cheer: this was instructive.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;This is the second story you&#39;ve published in the magazine that involves someone taking care of a stubborn, ailing older man. (In the other story, “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/09/13/the-monkey-who-speaks&quot;>;The Monkey Who Speaks&lt;/a>;,” it was a professional home health aide.) What draws you to this situation?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Not long ago, I worked as the assistant to a retired professor, a woman. I accompanied her to various doctors&#39; visits, and, though the term “patient advocate” was never used to describe my duties, I believed I was that for her. I asked the doctors questions about her medications, questions that she sometimes forgot to ask. I wrote notes summarizing what they said so that she could refer to them.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;This experience moved me more than I thought it would.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;Throughout the story, there&#39;s a motif of falling: falling has been the main sign of the father&#39;s failing health; his son takes him to a class on how to fall without hurting himself. Should we read something more metaphorical into that?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;On the one hand, per Samuel Beckett: “No symbols where none intended.” But, on the other, who am I to say, really? Knock yourselves out.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;Why is New York&#39;s infamous &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPXUG8q4jKU&quot;>;Pizza Rat&lt;/a>; in this story? How did a rat pulling a slice of pizza down some subway steps become the title figure in this narrative?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I love Pizza Rat. I &lt;em>;am&lt;/em>; Pizza Rat. There were a few years in the not-too-distant past when I was feeding myself entirely with leftovers from mixers at a university where I was an adjunct and a temp. I would go in with Ziploc bags after these events and shove any food that was available into them. Interestingly enough, a lot of these food items were slices of pizza. But that&#39;s not why I am Pizza Rat. Sometimes inhabiting a character helps me to feel the shamelessness necessary to pull off undesirable tasks. So my mantra on those food-hoarding days was: I am Pizza Rat, I am Pizza Rat. I would recite the line on a loop in my head. And, lo and behold—I didn&#39;t care who saw me walk away with bags of food, because would Pizza Rat care? And when it came time for an analogue and an avatar for the narrator in the story—who has the same underemployed, underpaid life that I did then—who should suggest himself but my old friend Pizza Rat? ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;9ihn98&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;xvmsa9&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 16 Oct 2023 19:06:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Can Happiness Be Taught?]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/10/23/build-the-life-you-want-the-art-and-science-of-getting-happier-oprah-winfrey-and-arthur-c-brooks-book-review]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-16T10:00:00.000Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65270976c259c2065944ab9e/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/231023_r43200web.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;article >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attribute-verso-pattern=&quot;article-body&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;ArticlePageChunks&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;figure data-testid=&quot;IframeEmbed&quot; >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;IframeEmbedContainer&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;iframe height=&quot;90&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; sandbox=&quot;allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups&quot; title=&quot;Embedded Frame&quot; data-src=&quot;https://audm.herokuapp.com/player-embed?pub=newyorker&amp;amp;articleID=652568ddb4c72cac9903c932&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay *;加密媒体*；剪贴板写入；自动播放;全屏; picture-in-picture&quot;>;&lt;/iframe>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;p >;Staring into the mirror, on a Tuesday morning, you decide that your self needs all the help it can get. But where to turn? You were reading James Clear&#39;s “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Atomic-Habits-Proven-Build-Break/dp/0735211299/&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Atomic-Habits-Proven-Build-Break/dp/0735211299/&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Atomic-Habits-Proven-Build-Break/dp/0735211299/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;Atomic Habits: An Easy &amp;amp; Proven Way to Build Good Habits &amp;amp; Break Bad Ones&lt;/a>;” and doing well until you spilled half a bottle of Knob Creek over the last sixty pages. Now you&#39;ll never know how it ends. You tried listening to David Goggins&#39;s “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Cant-Hurt-Me-Master-Your/dp/1544512287&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Cant-Hurt-Me-Master-Your/dp/1544512287&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Cant-Hurt-Me-Master-Your/dp/1544512287&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;Can&#39;t Hurt Me: Master Your Mind and Defy the Odds&lt;/a>;,” on Audible, in your car, but so thrilling was Goggins&#39;s prose style that you stomped on the gas and rear-ended a Tesla. Do not despair, though. Succor is at hand. Roosting on Amazon&#39;s best-seller list is “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Build-Life-You-Want-Science/dp/0593545400&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Build-Life-You-Want-Science/dp/0593545400&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Build-Life-You-Want-Science/dp/0593545400&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;Build the Life You Want: The Art and Science of Getting Happier&lt;/a>;,” by Arthur C. Brooks and Oprah Winfrey (Portfolio).&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;At this point, your conscience rebels. By buying a book on Amazon, you tell yourself, you will be directly funding a new angora lining for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tag/jeff-bezos&quot;>;Jeff Bezos&lt;/a>;&#39;s monogrammed slippers in the master bedroom of his private yacht—not the main one but the backup vessel currently moored off Patmos. Quivering with righteousness, you close your laptop and stride to your nearest bookstore, only to bump into a dilemma: whereabouts in the store, exactly, can “Build the Life You Want” be found?&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;It is not an easy volume to place. You&#39;d assume that it belongs on the self-help table. Yet the title suggests home improvement or even civil engineering, and so ardently does Brooks insist on the “four big happiness pillars”—family, friendship, work, and faith—that readers of a nervous disposition may choose to wear a hard hat. On the other hand, Brooks is a professor of management practice at Harvard Business School, so he would slot into the business section with ease. Given that, as he says, “the macronutrients of happiness are enjoyment, satisfaction, and purpose,” there&#39;s an equally strong case for the cookery shelf. Or how about philosophy? Anyone who cites Marcus Aurelius, Thomas Aquinas, Kant, Mick Jagger, Epicurus, &lt;em>;and&lt;/em>; Epictetus, as Brooks does, would be totally stoked to hang out in such lofty company. No one, of course, is loftier than his co-author, and, if your bookstore is furnished with an Oprah wing, that is where the book must be displayed.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;GenericCallout&quot;>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;external-link-embed--inline&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;a aria-label=&quot;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;The Best Books We Read This Week&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.newyorker.com/best-books-2023&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/best-books-2023&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;&lt;span >;&lt;strong>;The Best Books We Read This Week&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/a>;&lt;p >;&lt;em>;Read our reviews of notable new fiction and nonfiction, updated every Wednesday.&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;a aria-label=&quot;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;The Best Books We Read This Week&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.newyorker.com/best-books-2023&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/best-books-2023&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/63c800e4e99d89b838ada996/1:1/w_200%2Cc_limit/undefined&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/63c800e4e99d89b838ada996/1:1/w_120,c_limit/undefined 120w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/a>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;When two writers join forces, it can be tricky to sort out who did what. Not in this case. Brooks is the principal player, and Oprah is his guest star. Only four times does she enter the action to offer “A Note from Oprah,” and the four notes, added together, take up less than fourteen pages in a book that is more than two hundred and forty pages long. What does she bring, then, apart from the humongous commercial clout of her blessing? Well, she reveals that “The Oprah Winfrey Show” was “always at heart a classroom. I was curious about so many things, from the intricacies of the digestive system to the meaning of life.” (Had she been French, of course, those two items would have been the same.) Near the start of the book, ever alert to her audience, she scrunches what she considers Brooks&#39;s most valuable lesson into “words you should tape to your refrigerator,” and, for extra clarity, accelerates into italics: “&lt;em>;Your emotions are only signals. And you get to decide how you&#39;ll respond to them&lt;/em>;.” One more scrunch, and Oprah has the mantra she wants: “&lt;em>;Feel the feel, then take the wheel&lt;/em>;.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;What&#39;s interesting about this advice is that far behind it, dimly discernible, is another speeding vehicle, fuelled by allegorical intent: the chariot drawn by a pair of winged horses and deployed by Socrates, in Plato&#39;s Phaedrus, to illustrate the motions of the soul. One horse, representing our nobler instincts, is “upright in frame and well jointed,” whereas the other is a hell of a nag, “a crooked great jumble of limbs,” forever dragging us down toward the lower desires. All in all, chariot-driving is what Socrates calls “a painfully difficult business,” as is being alive, and the task that Brooks and Oprah set for themselves, in their affable and optimistic fashion, is the age-old one of turning us into better charioteers. Our feelings urge us this way and that, and we should learn when to yank on the reins and when—steady now—to try a touch of the whip.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Whether Brooks has an actual chariot, Massachusetts traffic laws being what they are, I cannot say. Heaven knows what Oprah keeps in her stables. But it&#39;s charming to note the confidence with which Brooks, for one, presents his credentials as a successful whipster. He experimented on his own routines and began teaching a class on happiness at Harvard, not to mention composing a regular column for &lt;em>;The&lt;/em>; &lt;em>;Atlantic&lt;/em>; on the same topic. By his account, “I saw more and more progress in my life.” Onward and upward he flew:&lt;/p>;&lt;blockquote >;&lt;div >;&lt;p>;In the years since I made this life change, my own well-being has risen &lt;em>;a lot&lt;/em>;. People notice and remark that I smile more, and I look like I&#39;m having more fun in my work. My relationships are better than they were.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/blockquote>;&lt;p >;We&#39;re so happy that you&#39;re happy, Professor! Far be it from me to point out that such protestations of improvement, sincere as they are, have a whiff of the travelling salesman—you know, the guy who puts a foot in the door and says, “Believe me, Ma&#39;am, I&#39;ve been using this very same vacuum cleaner in my own home for three months now, and the effect of that heightened suck power is just tremendous. My dust has all but vanished. My carpets look brand new.” To anyone browsing “Build the Life You Want” and books of a similar ilk, it soon becomes clear that the care and maintenance of the self is no longer a branch of the social sciences, if it ever was, or an offshoot of popular psychology. Restructuring your inward being, and increasing its turnover, is now akin to running a company. Personhood, like religion and politics, is a business.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;It doesn&#39;t take long for Brooks to get the business going. He proudly inducts us into the thrill of the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule, or &lt;em >;PANAS&lt;/em>;, which gauges “your natural happy-unhappy mix.” This gives us a list of twenty emotions, such as “6. Guilty 7. Scared 8. Hostile 9. Enthusiastic.” (A perfect guide, as it happens, to the average day of a movie critic.) You note down how keenly you feel the feel, as Oprah would say, grading each emotion for intensity, then calculate your final score. This, in turn, shows where you belong on a pretty diagram, reproduced on page 16 of “Build the Life You Want,” that divides &lt;em>;Homo sapiens&lt;/em>; cleanly into four basic types: Cheerleader, Mad Scientist, Judge, and Poet.真的吗？ Imagine asking J. Robert Oppenheimer to nominate which one of those he thought he was. He would have exploded.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;You&#39;ve got to love the &lt;em >;PANAS&lt;/em>; test. It means almost nothing, yet it gives you the bracing impression that you&#39;re down on the factory floor, tinkering away on the unique machine that is you. It is, to use Oprah&#39;s splendidly honest term, “science-y,” right down to the vague, if benign, laboratory conditions that Brooks dictates. “To take the test, find a time when you feel relatively neutral about life—say, right after lunch,” he writes. But what sort of lunch? If it&#39;s three o&#39;clock in the afternoon and you&#39;re lingering over coffee and gazing out across the Bay of Naples, you will give thanks for the wonders of creation. Conversely, if you just blew seven dollars and twenty-nine cents on a Subway footlong, you will hold your fellow-humans in contempt and assume, naturally, that the world is an overcooked meatball hung in a meaningless void.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Undaunted, Brooks forges onward, and makes further encouraging claims about his methods. Eager to prove that even negative feelings, if shrewdly handled, can have a positive outcome, he ventures into the realms of the book-y. He even gets arts-y on our ass. Quoting a line from Keats&#39;s letters—“Do you not see how necessary a World of Pains and troubles is to school an Intelligence and make it a soul?”—Brooks adds, “Scientists have found that Keats was right.” If only all literary criticism could be as brisk as that. Moreover, according to a study cited by Brooks, “The research found that among great composers like Beethoven, a 37 percent increase in sadness led to, on average, one extra major composition.” That sentence makes me twenty-four per cent less sad, and eighty-one per cent more inclined to giggle, than anything I have read this year.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Brooks is scarcely the first to propose that our happiness, and its opposite, can and should be quantified as precisely as barometric pressure.

In theory, this allowed you to evaluate any given act in terms of its ensuing pain or pleasure, which could be graded according to various criteria: intensity, duration, certainty, propinquity, fecundity, purity, and extent. In practice, the last of these—which sounds tame, and which refers to the number of people who will be affected by the act—is probably the most morally ticklish, as any secondhand smoker can confirm.&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot;

worth of medical probing behind him, Brooks can boldly go where Bentham was unable to go before and lead us to the particular neighborhoods where pain and pleasure hang out. “Build the Life You Want” plays peekaboo with the reader, affording sneaky little glimpses of the hypothalamus, the insula, and the adrenal glands. Are we genuinely expected to master this material, though, or is it designed purely to reassure us that we are in safe hands? When Brooks, analyzing our reaction to fear, writes, “Your periaqueductal gray, which also receives a note from your amygdala, tells your body to move,” the prosaic image of the note—plucked from our everyday lives—is what sticks and stays. To be told that our internal mail system is like that of a well-run office comes as quite a relief. Then, there is metacognition, a buzzword that hums throughout the book and entails “experiencing your emotions consciously” and “refusing to be controlled by them.” Brooks expounds:&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;hpf0m&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;ojp3gd&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;blockquote >;&lt;div >;&lt;p>;You might compare it to the process of taking petroleum from the well (your limbic system) to a gas refinery (the prefrontal cortex), where it can be made into something you can use purposively.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/blockquote>;&lt;p >;It&#39;s not the greenest analogy I&#39;ve ever seen, but, hey, it does the job. Such is the tactic by which Brooks and the other sovereigns of self-help, with considerable skill and a pinch of cunning, advance their cause. They borrow difficult concepts from the realms of neurology and behavioral science, among others, and couch them in a patois that we recognize. Few of us may have read a paper from a 2013 issue of &lt;em>;Depression and Anxiety&lt;/em>;—think &lt;em>;The World of Interiors&lt;/em>; without the cashmere throws—titled “Reports of Drinking to Self-Medicate Anxiety Symptoms: Longitudinal Assessment for Subgroups of Individuals with Alcohol Dependence.” But Brooks &lt;em>;has&lt;/em>; read it, and has filtered its findings into his thoughts on addiction. (The paper, I couldn&#39;t help noticing, had eleven authors. I trust that they ganged up and got pie-eyed on Zombies to celebrate publication.)&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Homework, though, is not the nub of Brooks&#39;s enterprise. The nub is that he&#39;s required, by the panic-stricken temper of the times, to insist that we can and must get better at being who we are. It could be argued that so positive an outlook is, and always has been, a by-product of any inquiry into the conduct of our earthly existence, although a self-help book by Schopenhauer would, perhaps, flummox more readers than it would assist. On the other hand, if anything yokes together the philosophers cited by Brooks, it is the willingness, or the unavoidable compulsion, to worry away at one moral conundrum after the next, like dogs unearthing a bone to have another go at the marrow. You could spend a lifetime, say, stubbornly chewing on what Aristotle, in the Ethics, means by &lt;em>;eudaemonia&lt;/em>;. “Happiness” alone won&#39;t suffice. Aristotle himself, treading carefully, writes, “We have practically defined happiness as a sort of living and faring well.” I am partial to the modesty of “human flourishing.” Others prefer something like “the activity of a rational soul in accordance with virtue”—a daunting ideal that held sway for twenty-five hundred years, until it was roundly rebuffed by the creators of “Jackass.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Whether there is still a place for the steady intellectual grind is open to question. Readers and publishers alike are worried by all that worrying. Understandably, their quest is for books that promise results, primed to beef up one&#39;s &lt;em>;eudaemonia&lt;/em>; levels like a shot of Vitamin B&lt;sub>;12&lt;/sub>;. Hence the speed with which the mood of Brooks&#39;s book, grammatical and tonal, is set within the title: not “How to Build” but “Build.” Thereafter, the imperative reigns supreme. “Start by working on your toughness.” No sweat. “Take your grand vision of improvement and humble ambition to be part of it in a specific way and execute accordingly.”查看。 “Rebel against your shame.” Done. “Widen your conflict-resolution repertoire.” Ka-pow! “Treat your walks, prayer time, and gym sessions as if they were meetings with the president.” Which President? “Journal your experiences and feelings over the course of the day.” Since when did “journal” turn into a transitive verb? “Dig into the extensive and growing technology and literature on mindfulness.” Sorry, I was miles away, what? Above all, “Remember: &lt;em>;You are your own CEO&lt;/em>;.” Holy moly. Do I have to wear a suit to brush my teeth? Is my dog a shareholder? Were last year&#39;s migraines tax-deductible? Can I be fired by me?&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The problem with imperatives is that the more frequent they become, or the more impassioned, the harder it is to obey them and to predict what the fallout from their implementation might be. When Judy Garland, in a tux and black tights, belted out “Get Happy” in “Summer Stock” (1950), you bowed to her command, even if you knew that her life off camera lay in ruins. When she sang the song thirteen years later, on TV, it was intertwined with “Happy Days Are Here Again,” sung by Barbra Streisand, who sat beside her: a rending mashup of two American anthems, delivered at a slow and stricken tempo, as if to acknowledge that the getting of happiness exacted too high a price. And, once it was got, then what?&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;You hear that fear again in the voice of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1975/07/14/cary-grant-profile-pauline-kael&quot;>;Cary Grant&lt;/a>; in “Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House” (1948). He plays an advertising man, hitherto squashed into a small New York apartment with his family, who buys a wreck in Connecticut, has it torn down, puts up a new place, and gets pushed to the brink. “Anybody who builds a house today is crazy. The minute you start, they put you on the list. The All-American Sucker list. You start out to build a home and you wind up in the poorhouse,” he cries. “What about the kids who just got married and want a home of their own? It&#39;s a conspiracy, I tell you, a conspiracy against every boy and girl who were ever in love.” The movie is a light comedy, but, this being Grant, the shadow of desperation is never far away, and what maddens Mr. Blandings is not just the practical chaos and the financial waste but the expense of spirit. He has been sold on his own dream.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I thought of Mr. Blandings often as I plowed through “Build the Life You Want.” Brooks radiates decency and good will; if you yearn to do up your life, like somebody who knocks down a wall and repaints the kitchen, he will lend you the tools. There is almost nothing that he will not undertake to fix. He has a stirring chapter on friendship, for which he has a proper Aristotelian reverence. (Even Bentham, no party animal, recommended “the pleasures of amity.”) So kindly is his disposition, indeed, that he has faith in the gentle resolving of ideological differences. The trick, apparently, is to reserve judgment: “You will find yourself not weighing in on political debates and giving fewer opinions; this will keep you calmer and in a greater state of inner peace.” It&#39;s wonderful to reflect on the millions of people who will heed that advice and maintain a monastic silence as we enter an election year.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Here and there, however, as you browse the book, you catch murmurs of disquiet. They tend to arise in casual comments, such as “Taking negativity personally can lead to rumination.” Heaven forfend! A ruminator on the loose! At other times, a plain recitation of statistics can freak you out, as when Brooks adduces an academic study from 2007:&lt;/p>;&lt;blockquote >;&lt;div >;&lt;p>;The researchers then examined a data set from another study that rated incoming college freshmen&#39;s “cheerfulness” and tracked their income nearly two decades later. They found that the most cheerful in 1976 were not the highest earners in 1995; that distinction once again went to the second-highest group, which rated their cheerfulness as “above average” but not in the highest 10 percent.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/blockquote>;&lt;p >;Where to begin with this? With the assumption that cheerfulness is a measurable quality and that, more to the point, a person is guaranteed to be the most reliable assessor of her or his own cheer? Or with the uncontested idea that a rising income conveys you ever closer to the summum bonum? It might have been pertinent, at this juncture, if Brooks had directed inquisitive readers to the Easterlin paradox—that is, to a controversial paper of 1974, “Does Economic Growth Improve the Human Lot? Some Empirical Evidence,” by the economist Richard A. Easterlin. The link between earnings and contentment, Easterlin claimed, was not as firm as might be expected, especially when one compared a variation in earnings inside a single country with a variation &lt;em>;between&lt;/em>; two separate countries. The fun part came in a chart that laid out the “Personal Happiness Rating” of thirteen nations, as recorded in the late fifties and early sixties. The lucky winners were the United States and Cuba.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;How most of us would rate our personal happiness these days, even without the Bay of Pigs to look forward to, is not something that Arthur C. Brooks and Oprah Winfrey presume to plot on a graph. I suspect, however, that in their view most of us are weltering in a woe of our own devising, and that, unlike Beethoven, we can&#39;t even get a decent symphony out of it. Hence Brooks&#39;s most provoking sentence of all, which is tucked away in parentheses, lest it disturb our equanimity. “(Unhappy people make great consumers),” he writes. And there we arrive at the heart of the matter. “Build the Life You Want” is the pure product of a liberal capitalist democracy: First World fretting, one might say, politely disguised as universal wisdom.

A year later, twelve of the defendants were sentenced to be hanged, and seven received prison sentences. Few people, even in Germany, felt particularly sorry for the condemned men, who had caused so much death and destruction all over Europe. But there were reservations about a trial in which the victors prosecuted the vanquished. Winston Churchill, for one, would have preferred to shoot the Nazi leaders and be done with it. (Stalin thought that killing fifty thousand Germans might do; even Churchill was a little put out by that.)&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Instead, the London Charter was created to try the top Nazis for crimes against humanity (a new concept) and crimes against peace (another new idea), along with conventional war crimes. Crimes against humanity meant murder, extermination, enslavement, and other such acts against a civilian population, or persecution on religious or racial grounds. Planning and waging a war of aggression counted as crimes against peace. The aim in creating these laws was to set norms for the future. But critics of the Nuremberg proceedings quickly objected to the use of retroactive justice—punishment by laws that hadn&#39;t existed when the crimes were committed. They also noted that, before Nuremberg, political leaders had not been held personally responsible for acts of state, however cruel and aggressive they may have been.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Hypocrisy was another issue raised by critics. German leaders were accused of killing large numbers of defenseless civilians, but what about the eradication of entire cities by Allied bombing? And how was one of Stalin&#39;s hanging judges, who presided over some of the bloodiest Soviet show trials, entitled to try Germans for crimes against humanity?&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;GenericCallout&quot;>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;external-link-embed--inline&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;a aria-label=&quot;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;The Best Books We Read This Week&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.newyorker.com/best-books-2023&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/best-books-2023&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;&lt;span >;&lt;strong>;The Best Books We Read This Week&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/a>;&lt;p >;&lt;em>;Read our reviews of notable new fiction and nonfiction, updated every Wednesday.&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;a aria-label=&quot;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;The Best Books We Read This Week&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.newyorker.com/best-books-2023&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/best-books-2023&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/63c800e4e99d89b838ada996/1:1/w_200%2Cc_limit/undefined&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/63c800e4e99d89b838ada996/1:1/w_120,c_limit/undefined 120w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/a>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;If the Nuremberg trial was questionable in some respects, the trial of Japanese wartime leaders in Tokyo (which resulted in seven men hanged, sixteen imprisoned) was far more dubious. John Dower, the finest American historian of modern Japan, called the Tokyo trial “a murky reflection of its German counterpart.” On a visit to Japan in 1946, the eminent US diplomat George Kennan dismissed the proceedings as “political trials.” Charles Willoughby, General Douglas MacArthur&#39;s intelligence chief in Tokyo, thought that the proceedings were “the worst hypocrisy in recorded history.” And Radhabinod Pal, the trial&#39;s Indian judge, didn&#39;t think that any of the defendants should be found guilty, because he viewed a trial conducted mostly by representatives of colonial powers as illegitimate.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The International Military Tribunal for the Far East, as the Tokyo trial was officially called, lasted longer than the trial in Nuremberg—it stretched from May, 1946, to November, 1948—and was on a far grander scale. Where the Nuremberg judges came from four countries, the Tokyo judges came from eleven: the United States, Canada, Australia, the United Kingdom, China, the Philippines, the Netherlands, France, New Zealand, India, and the Soviet Union. The Tokyo trial was also more of an American affair than the tribunal in Germany had been. Japan was under Allied occupation until 1952, but control was almost entirely in the hands of General MacArthur, the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers (&lt;em >;SCAP&lt;/em>;). And, if the ferocious Allied destruction of German cities was a point to be skirted in Nuremberg, the nuclear bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, not to mention the incendiary bombing of many other Japanese cities, cast even greater doubt on the legitimacy of Allied judgment of Japanese war crimes.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Illegitimate or not, as Gary J. Bass points out in his exhaustive and fascinating book “Judgment at Tokyo: World War II on Trial and the Making of Modern Asia” (Knopf), the Tokyo trial had serious consequences that continue to play out to this day. Placing the trial firmly in the context of colonialism, racial attitudes, the Cold War, and post-colonial Asian politics, Bass argues, quite rightly, that the trial “reveals some of the reasons why a liberal international order has not emerged in Asia.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;It is impossible to imagine a mainstream German politician openly disparaging the Nuremberg trial as mere foreign propaganda, or paying tribute to convicted war criminals in a place of worship. Yet several Japanese Prime Ministers have done just that with regard to the Tokyo trial. The late Shinzo Abe, for example, prayed at the imperialist Yasukuni Shrine, in Tokyo, where major war criminals are glorified and monuments set among elegant gardens honor such notorious wartime organizations as the Kempeitai, the rough Japanese equivalent of the Gestapo. One reason Abe and some of his predecessors have done so—provoking Japanese liberals as much as other Asians—is their desire to overturn what right-wing nationalists like to call the “Tokyo-trial version of history.” They believe that Allied propagandists, and the Japanese leftists who parroted them, imposed a “masochistic” view of the past on Japan, and unfairly accused the country of waging an aggressive war and committing worse atrocities than other nations.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;The version of history offered by the Tokyo trial &lt;em>;was&lt;/em>; a little skewed. The proceedings followed the example of Nuremberg, as though the war waged by Japan had been an Asian mirror image of that waged by Germany. Indeed, many Westerners at the time thought that the Japanese were even worse than the Nazis. Racial prejudice had something to do with this belief. Bass quotes an Australian newspaper: “The Jap has not a soul to think in terms of decency.” But the attack on Pearl Harbor also contributed, as did the treatment of Western prisoners of war, which was more severe than the usual German handling of POWs (as long as they weren&#39;t Soviet soldiers). Bass quotes some startling statistics. In 1944, a third of Americans wanted Japan to be “destroyed as a political entity”; thirteen per cent thought all Japanese people should be killed.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;These were just the views of ordinary Americans responding to opinion polls. Henry L. Stimson—the wartime US War Secretary, who had blocked Jewish refugees from coming to the United States as late as 1944 and who, after the war, saw no reason to prosecute the Nazis for what they had done inside Germany—was appalled by the “horrible pictures of the way the Japanese are treating our poor Air Force boys when they get hold of them.” These boys, of course, had been killing hundreds of thousands of Japanese civilians from the air. General MacArthur, meanwhile, wanted the Tokyo trial to deal only with Pearl Harbor, and not with Japan&#39;s far greater war crimes committed against other Asians, especially the Chinese.&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot;

Koki Hirota (who was sentenced to death by hanging), Shigenori Togo (twenty years in prison), and Mamoru Shigemitsu (seven years) were neither fanatics nor thugs but civilian politicians who served in a number of governments that were more and more dominated by military men. All three—Hirota as Prime Minister and foreign minister, Togo and Shigemitsu as foreign ministers—had tried at different times to stop the militarists from going to war.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;They failed.

Conspiracy to commit a crime, in any case, wasn&#39;t a Japanese judicial concept; it was a peculiarly Anglo-American one.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;tyjpxg&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;brizt&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Many of the military leaders on trial were belligerent. General Hideki Tojo (hanged) certainly was. And they were unable or unwilling to stop their troops from raping and murdering countless civilians. Tojo also ordered POWs to do hard labor, which often killed them. Torture—especially at the hands of the dreaded Kempeitai, whose leaders, oddly enough, were not tried in Tokyo—was routinely practiced all over the Japanese Empire. But the defendants in Tokyo had not been driven by a genocidal ideology. Many of them may have been warmongers, but they weren&#39;t Nazis.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;As latecomers to the imperialist game, the Japanese had been fighting wars on the Asian continent since 1894. They colonized Korea, Taiwan, and islands in the South Pacific; conquered Manchuria (now northeast China) in 1931 and set it up as a puppet state; and invaded the rest of China in 1937. Much of this was done in the spirit of defensive jingoism. Japan wanted to protect what it saw as its legitimate interests in Asia by building its own empire, one that both opposed Western empires in the region and mimicked them. This Japanese enterprise was often vicious, frequently dishonest, and ultimately disastrous, but it was essentially an imperialist war, and did not include a systematic and ideological program of extermination.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Still, Bass is right to keep returning to the question of race. Tojo, who served as Japan&#39;s Prime Minister from 1941 to 1944, believed that his country needed to liberate Asians from Western imperialism and spread its “superior” culture “all over the world.” It was a brutal liberation that most Asians didn&#39;t much appreciate. But the Japanese leaders, Tojo among them, defended their mission by claiming to be fighting against white supremacy. In 1919, the Japanese demand for racial equality in the Covenant of the League of Nations had been denied. Some two decades later, Japan, in the view of Tojo and others, was forced into a war with the West—the invasion of China was harder to justify—because Western imperial powers had conspired against Japanese interests, cutting the country off from oil and other vital supplies. At the same time, the president of Japan&#39;s privy council warned the militarists against a war with the West, lest such a venture unite the Europeans and the Americans in a common “hatred of the yellow race.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Some anti-colonial Asian leaders in the nineteen-forties—including José Laurel in the Philippines and Sukarno in the Dutch East Indies—were prepared to view the Japanese as liberators and hoped that collaboration with Japan would rid them of their Western masters. It did, in the end, but not before Asians suffered a great many horrors at Japanese hands. Two of the three Asian judges on the Tokyo tribunal—Delfin Jaranilla, from the Philippines, and Mei Ruao, from China—were, Bass points out, harsher on the Japanese than the Western judges were. That shouldn&#39;t have been surprising, since Mei had suffered from Japanese bombing in Chongqing, the last wartime Chinese capital, and Jaranilla had been in the Bataan Death March, in 1942, which claimed the lives of as many as eighteen thousand Filipinos.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Justice Pal, on the other hand, an eloquent Bengali intellectual who had become a respected lawyer under the British Raj, agreed with Tojo and his colleagues in the dock in finding the idea of a Japanese conspiracy “preposterous.” Pal claimed that his fellow-judges from the West had a “bias created by racial or political factors.” Japan had been right to feel threatened in the nineteen-thirties, he thought, “with Nationalist China, Soviet Russia, and the race-conscious English-speaking peoples of the Pacific closing in on her.” And if Japanese education and propaganda had been a little racist, too, well: “I cannot condemn those of the Japanese leaders who might have thought of protecting their race by inculcating their racial superiority in the youthful mind.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;No wonder, then, that Justice Pal should have a monument all to himself at Yasukuni Shrine, bearing the words “When Time shall have softened passion and prejudice, when Reason shall have stripped the mask from misrepresentation, then Justice, holding evenly her scales, will require much of past censure and praise to change places.” Few of the Japanese nationalists who go to the shrine to pay their respects to the Indian judge will recognize that these words were spoken originally by Jefferson Davis, the Confederate leader, who mourned the lost cause of slavery.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Are the Japanese nationalists right? Was the Tokyo trial just a hypocritical piece of Western propaganda, taken up by Japanese leftists? The truth is far more complicated. Western bias can safely be assumed, since the trial was decided upon by the US and dominated by judges from the British Empire. The chief judge was an Australian, the chief prosecutor an American, and, aside from Jaranilla, Mei, and Pal, the judges representing Asian peoples were Dutch, British, and French. The Koreans, who had suffered from Japanese aggression longer than any other people, had no judge at all.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Nor is it a stretch to think that a sense of wounded imperialism might have colored the perspective of some of the European judges. Although Bass overstates the case when he says that Britain&#39;s postwar Labour government “embraced imperialism”—the independence of India and Burma, at least, had its approval—there&#39;s no doubt that the Prime Minister, Clement Attlee, and the Foreign Secretary, Ernest Bevin, still had an exalted view of British power in the world, which they sought to preserve through the Commonwealth, and through a global network of military bases. The Japanese invasions of European colonies were clearly experienced as a humiliation. Publicly abasing Western POWs had been a deliberate Japanese tactic to show other Asians how low the white man could be brought down, and to promote the mission of restoring Asia to Asians.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The legacy of the tribunal was certainly muddled by the lack of consensus among the judges about the legitimacy of the charges. Justice Pal was not the only one to challenge the idea of conspiracy to wage war. The charge of crimes against peace had been justified in Nuremberg by various prewar agreements to proscribe war, such as the Kellogg-Briand Pact of 1928. (In the wake of the First World War, the French foreign minister, Aristide Briand, suggested a Franco-US agreement to outlaw war between the two nations. When his US counterpart, Frank B. Kellogg, showed little interest in a bilateral arrangement, the idea was expanded to include most of the countries in the world, including Japan.) But international agreements are not criminal laws. Even the Australian jurist William Webb, the tribunal&#39;s chief judge, admitted that “international law, unlike the laws of many countries, does not expressly include a crime of naked conspiracy,” and that the creation of this crime was “nothing short of judicial legislation.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Natural law, based on religious and legal philosophies associated with such figures as the seventeenth-century Dutch statesman and jurist Hugo Grotius—and systematized earlier by Thomas Aquinas—was also invoked to condemn the Japanese. The Dutch judge, Bert Röling, was among those who dissented from the tribunal&#39;s rulings (much to the alarm of his government in The Hague), and he pointedly took issue with the effort to enlist natural law. Fully conscious of the Dutch colonial record in Asia, he wrote, “I hesitate to approach the Far East in our effort to determine the criminality of aggression with quotations from idealists and philosophers of the very period when our heroes and soldiers were conquering its territories in what could hardly be called a defensive war.” Röling wanted to limit the trial to conventional war crimes and crimes against humanity.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;e93ohn&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Meanwhile, Joseph Keenan, the American chief prosecutor, was prone to sonorous absurdities. He claimed that the Japanese aggressors had invaded countries in Asia intending to “destroy democracy and its essential basis—freedom and the respect of human personality.” These countries in Asia were, of course, European and US colonies. That Keenan was often drunk is no excuse. Even Asians who had loathed their Japanese oppressors would have been astonished by this delusional flourish of American idealism.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The Asian judges, apart from Pal, had no doubts about the court&#39;s jurisdiction. Bass is especially good on Mei, the Chinese judge, to whom too little attention has been paid in other books on the Tokyo trial. A man of considerable learning who had studied at Stanford University, Mei was perhaps the least cynical of the judges. He truly believed that the trial would create a more peaceful and democratic world order, and had the thankless task of promoting this idea even as his Nationalist government was being quickly overwhelmed by Mao Zedong&#39;s Communist revolutionaries. He also did his best to focus attention on Japanese atrocities in China. If MacArthur thought the attack on Pearl Harbor was a murderous war crime, Chinese claims were far more persuasive: as many as twenty million Chinese died in the war between 1937 and 1945.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The retreating Japanese had destroyed most of the documents attesting to their actions, but there was nonetheless sufficient evidence to shock Japanese public opinion. Various witnesses gave accounts of what they saw when the Nationalist capital, Nanjing, was ransacked in the course of six weeks in 1937 by Japanese Imperial Army troops, who raped countless women and killed tens of thousands and possibly even hundreds of thousands of people. A Japanese Army document produced at the trial showed that superior officers had either encouraged or ignored these crimes. “In the battlefield we think nothing of rape,” one soldier said. Chinese POWs were lined up and “killed to test the efficiency of the machine gun,” another recalled.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;The Japanese press reported these horrors at length, but Mei&#39;s noble intention to establish a thorough historical record of Japan&#39;s crimes was further hampered by the civil war in China. The Nationalist generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek tended to see trials against Japanese war criminals as a distraction from his struggle against the Communists. He even employed one of the most ruthless Japanese generals as his military adviser. The massacres perpetrated by this particular general had been directed mostly at Communist guerrillas, which didn&#39;t especially concern Chiang. The Communists, in turn, didn&#39;t bother much about the Nanjing Massacre until decades later, because its victims were governed by the Nationalists.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Other Japanese crimes were ignored at the Tokyo trial for equally cynical reasons. Japanese doctors and scientists in the notorious Unit 731, which was in charge of biological and chemical warfare, had conducted hideous experiments on Chinese and Russian prisoners, and deliberately infected large numbers of Chinese with fatal diseases, such as bubonic plague, just to see what would happen. The leader of this unit, Shiro Ishii, and his team received immunity from the Americans in exchange for their data, which were thought to be useful. Quite how useful the data proved has never been divulged.&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;a data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a25695&amp;quot;}&quot;

The wide-scale rape of local women had become a headache for the Army, since it provoked greater anti-Japanese resistance. To mitigate this problem, so-called comfort women were tricked or kidnapped and made to service Japanese soldiers. But their suffering wasn&#39;t on anyone&#39;s agenda in 1946. This enormity would become a serious issue only much later.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The extent to which the defendants in the Tokyo trial were personally responsible for the crimes in China, or in other parts of Asia, was hard to prove, so they were convicted for their failure to stop those crimes. But in the end it wasn&#39;t the Western powers that came down hardest on the Japanese. Justice Mei thought the final judgment had been too soft in some respects. The Chinese Communists were outraged that Tojo and other defendants had been allowed to make self-justifying speeches in court and to be defended by able US lawyers. The &lt;em>;People&#39;s Daily&lt;/em>; thundered, “MacArthur&#39;s protection and indulgence is the real reason why war criminals such as Tojo dare to be so arrogant.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In one important respect, the “Tokyo-trial version of history” was indeed utterly remiss. Emperor Hirohito, whose name was on many incriminating documents, was, for political reasons, neither prosecuted nor even called as a witness. When Tojo inadvertently let it slip that “no Japanese subject would go against the will of His Majesty,” he was swiftly reminded not to implicate the Emperor and stated that the Emperor had never had anything but peaceful intentions.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;MacArthur, as well as his advisers, decided in 1945 that if the Emperor did not remain on his throne there would be a nationwide revolt that would upset &lt;em >;SCAP&lt;/em>;&#39;s administration. Only a few days after the formal Japanese surrender, as Bass writes, “both the American occupiers and the Japanese authorities converged on a common line: the imperial court, so useful for a peaceful occupation, was not to be blamed for the war.” Bass might have stressed, however, that this was the view of MacArthur&#39;s most conservative advisers and the most reactionary Japanese authorities, and that many Japanese, including some of Hirohito&#39;s closest relatives, thought he should at least abdicate. It was the Americans who quashed that idea from the beginning.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Bass describes some of the rifts in the US Administration, in Tokyo as well as in Washington, DC At almost nine hundred pages, his book is already very long—“necessarily so,” in his opinion—but on the politics swirling around MacArthur&#39;s court he could have said more. There were New Dealers in his entourage who wanted a more radical transformation of Japan than did more conservative figures such as Henry Stimson, George Kennan, and Joseph Grew, the former Ambassador to Japan. Some of the conservatives around MacArthur were rather disreputable, to put it mildly. General Willoughby, his intelligence chief, born in Germany as Adolf Karl Weidenbach, was an admirer of Mussolini. MacArthur called Willoughby “my pet fascist.” The intelligence chief, who arranged for the protection of Shiro Ishii, from Unit 731, found allies among Japanese right-wingers, including some influential figures who had been arrested for war crimes and who sought to shape Japan according to their political wishes.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Bass calls the New Dealers “retributive” and “maximalist.” That&#39;s a little unfair; they were convinced that there was enough Japanese enthusiasm for civic rights to establish a more liberal democracy than had existed before, and to a large degree they were right. That Grew, Kennan, Stimson, and Willoughby were skeptical of the prospects for such a liberal democracy was partly a matter of cultural or racial prejudice. In Stimson&#39;s view, the Japanese were “an oriental people with an oriental mind and religion,” and thus incapable of governing themselves. Attempts to democratize Japan, in his view, would end up making “a hash of it.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;MacArthur himself, a martinet and a staunch Republican, was torn between his New Dealers and the conservatives. He compared the Japanese to “a boy of twelve” in terms of the “standards of modern civilization.” But he also had a rather grandiose idea of what he saw as his historic mission to establish a Christian democracy in Japan. This resulted in a liberal constitution, trade unions, land reforms, a free press, and women&#39;s suffrage, all of which were welcomed by most of the Japanese population. In the late nineteen-forties, however, when the Communists were winning in China and the Cold War was warming up, the right-wing, anti-Communist views of people such as Willoughby gained strength. “Reds” in government jobs, trade unions, universities, and other institutions were purged. But almost all the men who had been indicted for war crimes were released as soon as the Tokyo trial was over, in 1948. One of them was Nobusuke Kishi, the wartime vice-minister of munitions and Shinzo Abe&#39;s grandfather, who escaped a prison sentence and became Prime Minister in 1957.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;nop3k&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;45ffnu&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;In short, the kind of Japanese who objected to the “Tokyo-trial version of history” soon returned to power with active American assistance, including large amounts of American cash that flowed into conservative coffers well into the nineteen-sixties. Some of the work of the New Dealers and the Japanese liberals was undone. There were no further efforts to hold the Japanese to account for waging aggressive wars and committing war crimes across Asia. Still, there was at least one aspect of the postwar Japanese constitution, written by American idealists, that could not be revised, and that was Article 9, whereby Japan was to “renounce war as a sovereign right of the nation and the threat or use of force as means of settling international disputes.” This was simply too popular in Japan to touch.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;But the right-wing nationalists—and, indeed, many American conservatives, such as Richard Nixon—deplored Article 9 as a big mistake. The nationalists continue to see Article 9 as a humiliating assault on Japanese sovereignty, while their liberal opponents continue to see pacifism as a necessary lesson to be drawn from Japan&#39;s dismal wartime record. As a result of this conflict, views on Japan&#39;s modern history have become hopelessly tangled up with postwar politics. The more liberals point to the Nanjing Massacre, or the destruction of Japan itself, as a warning not to change the constitution, the more nationalists wish to deny that there ever was such a massacre in Nanjing, or that Japan did anything to be particularly ashamed of. This has greatly muddled Japanese foreign policy, especially in Asia. Every time Japanese leaders issue formal apologies for Japan&#39;s dark past in other Asian countries, their efforts are undercut by right-wing politicians making a show of visiting the Yasukuni Shrine, or insisting that school textbooks should be more patriotic and omit references to the Nanjing Massacre and other war crimes.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;This is embarrassing, and makes it easier for China to stir up anti-Japanese sentiment. South Korea—given the increasing belligerence it faces from China, as well as from North Korea—should be a close ally of Japan&#39;s. But relations between the two countries remain troubled by Japanese right-wing denials that Korean women were forced to work in Japanese military brothels. Indeed, Japan&#39;s unresolved issues with the “Tokyo-trial version of history” get to the heart of what Bass identifies as the country&#39;s greatest dilemma today.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Japan&#39;s constitutional pacifism has always been predicated on the understanding that the US would guarantee its security. Amid an increasingly hostile environment and an erratic American politics (Donald Trump), growing numbers of Japanese believe that a constitutional revision should now at least be seriously discussed, so that Japan can do more to defend itself and its neighbors. But neither Japan&#39;s allies in South Korea and Southeast Asia nor its liberals at home will be reassured by such a move as long as the country&#39;s conservative leaders refuse to face up to its past, and seek to appeal the verdict of history. ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;kdnys&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot;

Politics newsletter.&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>;&lt;hr />;&lt;p >;When Rodrigo Duterte ran for the Presidency of the Philippines and won, in 2016, the Western press noted the similarities between this unconventional candidate and Donald Trump—who also liked to casually espouse violence on the campaign trail and beyond. Duterte used provocative and obscene language to tap into the country&#39;s fears about a real, albeit overstated, drug problem. “Every drug addict was a schizophrenic, hallucinatory, will rape your mother and butcher your father,” as the reporter Patricia Evangelista puts it, “and if he can&#39;t find a child to rape, he&#39;ll rape a goat.” But, unlike Donald Trump, Duterte made good on his promise of death. More than twenty thousand extrajudicial killings took place over the course of his six-year term in office, according to human-rights groups—and Duterte remained quite popular as bodies piled up in the streets. Reporting for the news site Rappler, Evangelista confronted the collateral damage when Durterte started to enact his “kill them all” policies. “I had to take accountability,” she tells David Remnick. Her book, “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Some-People-Need-Killing-Country/dp/0593133137&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Some-People-Need-Killing-Country/dp/0593133137&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Some-People-Need-Killing-Country/dp/0593133137&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;Some People Need Killing&lt;/a>;,” is published in the US this week, and Evangelista has left the Philippines because of the danger it puts her in. “I own the guilt,” Evangelista says. “How can I sit in New York, when the people whose stories I told, who took the risk to tell me their stories, are sitting in shanties across the country and might be at risk because of things they told me?”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;cujcx&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;jziow9&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 16 Oct 2023 19:06:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Daniel Clowes’s “Quiet Luxury”]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cover-story/cover-story-2023-10-23]]><description>&lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-16T10:00:00.000Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6529887c5a34a665fde30de4/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/cover-story-promo-clowes_money.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;article >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attribute-verso-pattern=&quot;article-body&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;ArticlePageChunks&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p>;For the cover of the Money Issue, the cartoonist Daniel Clowes evokes the lavish, concentrated wealth that governs our world.

>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;In the past few years, accounts of San Francisco&#39;s unravelling—less like a tired sweater than a ball of yarn caught in a boat propeller—have spread with the authority of gossip or folklore. As the pandemic recedes, nearly a quarter of offices downtown are said to be vacant, the worst rate in the nation. Drug-overdose deaths are surging; reports of theft on downtown streets, including an almost two-hundred-per-cent increase in car break-ins in 2021, have crossed the national media to censorious response. “They took down the guardrails around personal responsibility,” the &lt;em>;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em>; columnist Daniel Henninger declared on Fox News. In May, a local pet owner claimed that her Himalayan sheepdog began “wobbling” after eating feces possibly containing opioids and marijuana. Throughout the summer, Presidential hopefuls came to town to stand on grim street corners and record their horror for the cameras. (“It&#39;s really collapsed because of leftist policies,” Ron DeSantis repined in his spot. Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., lamented the many Americans who “are on the precipice of ending up on a corner like this.”) Nine years ago, when HBO premièred the series “Silicon Valley,” a deadpan comedy lampooning the Bay Area&#39;s life-style blandishments and hapless global power, the city seemed to exist in a helium balloon, floating ever upward. Now the same place is viewed as an emblem of American collapse.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The change has been unsettling because the city&#39;s broad project is widely shared. Since the end of the industrial period, the main path of the US metropolis has been what&#39;s often called urban renewal: transforming old frameworks into beautiful, dynamic settings for prosperous middle-class life. No city excelled at the assignment more than San Francisco. It invested in lush, landscaped parks, tree-lined boulevards, and world-class museums where there had been none. It grew rich, and seemed to climb out of the Great Recession with both influence and a mandate. “There&#39;s a lot of pent-up envy of San Francisco from a lot of other cities that think of themselves as more important,” one local told me recently. For a long time, that envy inspired mostly emulation. Universities spent millions to reorient themselves around the Bay Area&#39;s style of thinking. Success across industries today is measured by virality, optimization, and unceasing growth. In San Francisco, the nation saw its dreams, and now it thinks it sees its nightmares. The question is what caused so swift a change.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;A new story described widespread flight. Downtown San Francisco has seen its highest retail vacancy rate since 2006. In the past few months, Christian Louboutin, Lululemon, Nordstrom, Old Navy, and Williams-Sonoma all began an exodus from the area; so did Office Depot and Whole Foods. In late summer, the owner of Gump&#39;s, an upscale shop that opened in the eighteen-sixties, released a testy open letter, threatening to close in response to “a litany of destructive San Francisco strategies, including allowing the homeless to occupy our sidewalks, to openly distribute and use illegal drugs, to harass the public and to defile the city&#39;s streets.” Urbanists had already begun to circulate a paper by the economist Stijn Van Nieuwerburgh that traced a post-pandemic spiral of collapsing retail and declining safety leading to less public revenue and fewer public services—what he called an “urban doom loop.” The phrase became a shorthand around town, where many took it as Cassandra&#39;s vision of their fate.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;One afternoon in June, I went to see Sarah Dennis Phillips, the official charged with rehabilitating San Francisco&#39;s businesses. “I&#39;m confident,” she said. “It&#39;s just a question of how long it takes.” A few weeks earlier, she had been appointed the executive director of San Francisco&#39;s Office of Economic and Workforce Development—effectively, the trauma surgeon for downtown—after a career spent bringing the downtowns of small, quiet, boring Northern California suburbs to life. Of one city, Livermore, she explained, “We had to create a &#39;Right to Live Downtown&#39; ordinance that everyone moving into a residential building would sign, acknowledging they would not get upset that things weren&#39;t quiet at 7 &lt;em >;pm&lt;/em>;” Now she faced the inverse problem: a city worried that its downtown was &lt;em>;too&lt;/em>; quiet.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;On her first day on the job, it was announced that the lender for the largest mall in the district, operated by the Westfield corporation, would retake possession of the property—a five-story retail center with spiral escalators, opposite the city&#39;s most famous cable-car landing. “We knew Westfield would be a challenge to deal with,” Dennis Phillips told me, in a loud café near City Hall. People all around us were absorbed in their phones and laptops, poring over the day&#39;s work. “We just didn&#39;t know that it was going to happen this fast.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The city&#39;s downtown has experienced slumps before. In the seventies and eighties, San Francisco, undergoing what was then described as a wave of drug use and crime, saw a series of exits to the suburbs. Skyline disputes—sparked in part by the city&#39;s tallest building, the Transamerica Pyramid, and drawing on fears of “Manhattanization”—produced an over-all square-footage cap, which constrained growth. In a new book, “Portal,” the urban-design critic John King recalls the bitter year of 1983, when the city&#39;s mayor, Dianne Feinstein, faced a ballot recall instigated by a far-left group called the White Panther Party. (Feinstein sought to ban handguns; the White Panthers believed that poor residents needed them for self-protection.) Remarking on the city&#39;s air of terminal insecurity in those years, King describes “a pessimism that was more than a match for detailed land-use plans.”&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;A sign reads We&amp;#x27;re Closed hanging in the window.&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65289033cab87eddbf1a90ca/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/231023_r43223.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65289033cab87eddbf1a90ca/master/w_120,c_limit/231023_r43223.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65289033cab87eddbf1a90ca/master/w_240,c_limit/231023_r43223.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65289033cab87eddbf1a90ca/master/w_320,c_limit/231023_r43223.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65289033cab87eddbf1a90ca/master/w_640,c_limit/231023_r43223.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65289033cab87eddbf1a90ca/master/w_960,c_limit/231023_r43223.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65289033cab87eddbf1a90ca/master/w_1280,c_limit/231023_r43223.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65289033cab87eddbf1a90ca/master/w_1600,c_limit/231023_r43223.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;“We knew Westfield would be a challenge to deal with,” one city official said of the downtown mall. “We just didn&#39;t know that it was going to happen this fast.”&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;p >;In the wake of a global lockdown, downtown pessimism had a different tone. Before the pandemic, thirty-eight per cent of San Francisco&#39;s office space was occupied by the technology industry. “We no longer manufacture things in San Francisco to speak of,” Rodney Fong, the president of the city&#39;s Chamber of Commerce, told me. “We&#39;re the first to see our downtown as impacted as it is, because when we said &#39;Work from home,&#39; everyone just grabbed a laptop, and boom!” That reliance on tech made downtown especially vulnerable.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Dennis Phillips&#39;s mode is crisp and cheery, and, as we sat in the din of the café, she mentioned that she had been reading “Survival of the City,” by the economists Edward Glaeser and David Cutler, and “The New Urban Crisis,” by Richard Florida, a book about displacement and inequality. More than anything, she was trying to balance San Francisco&#39;s grand narrative of its downtown as a techno-futurist Atlantis against a new story of downtown as a great, fun spot to open a small, quirky retail business. “If downtowns aren&#39;t a place you have to be, then they have to become places you &lt;em>;want&lt;/em>; to be,” Dennis Phillips told me. She had been studying communities that turned their stories around—formerly depressed cities like Nashville and Detroit that had shown an aptitude for “constructing that narrative that makes people want to come.” “It&#39;s a new muscle for San Francisco,” she said. “We&#39;ve never had to do that before.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;San Francisco is the capital of social media, streaming media, app tech, the sharing economy, the gig economy, and other building blocks of modern life. It can measure its influence in dollars: the city, whose early industry harvested outlying gold, silver, and timber as the heart of what the architectural historian Gray Brechin has called the “imperial” West Coast, remains the fifth-largest metropolitan economy in the global Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;But the city&#39;s influence can also be measured by its long shadow in Democratic politics. San Francisco, it&#39;s easy to forget, is a small city, approximately seven miles long and wide—the distance from the World Trade Center to the top of Central Park. Its social sphere is startlingly compressed. One day, I stopped in a coffee shop to send an e-mail asking for an interview and, seconds later, heard a guy reading his phone across the room exclaim, “&lt;em>;The New Yorker&lt;/em>; magazine wants to talk to me!” From this tiny ecosystem the political careers of the nation&#39;s Vice-President, the governor of its most populous state, the recent longtime Speaker of the House, and (until last month) the most senior Democratic member of the Senate emerged. The city&#39;s politics can seem preternaturally charged.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;“You might have heard of a book called &#39;Fifty Shades of Grey,&#39; ” Joel Engardio, a slender, balding, bearded man in his early fifties and a supervisor for San Francisco&#39;s Sunset District, told a crowd a few weeks ago. He wore a blue blazer, with a Board of Supervisors pin on his lapel. “The story of San Francisco politics could have a similar title: &#39;A Million Shades of Blue.&#39; You see, Democrats in San Francisco like to inflict sadistic pain on each other.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Engardio, who was elected last year to the Board of Supervisors, an eleven-member legislative body that governs both the city and the county, teaches a monthly public class that he calls SF Politics 101.

As downtown emptied out with the lockdown—“not a single fucking person on our streets!” another supervisor told me—certain genres of crime flourished. Smash-and-grab operations, in which car windows are shattered and valuable goods are extracted in seconds, usually alongside a running getaway vehicle, had been the bane of parked cars in San Francisco for several years. During the pandemic, the same practice was used to rob storefronts, spiking property-crime levels to forty-one per cent above the national average. Meanwhile, fentanyl, cheap and lethal, exploded in street sales. According to an eighteen-month investigation by the San Francisco &lt;em>;Chronicle&lt;/em>;, that surge was tied to well-run Honduran cartels, some of which sold meals to dealers out of car trunks so that they didn&#39;t have to leave their posts. (In the spring, Representative Nancy Pelosi, whose district encompasses most of the city, requested special funds from the Justice Department to investigate; no major federal arrests have yet been made.)&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“The pandemic and fentanyl collided,” Lydia Bransten, the executive director of the Gubbio Project, which offers coffee, health services, and a safe place to nap to a hundred homeless people a day, told me. Congregate shelters were at severely reduced capacity. “People in the throes of addiction were hanging out with other people in the throes of addiction without the rest of the community. Then the city reopened, and housed people coming out of their homes were confronted with this scene of absolute devastation. And they&#39;re flabbergasted: &#39;How could this happen? We&#39;ve spent all this money!&#39; ” From 2021 to 2022, San Francisco spent seventy-six million dollars on drug-treatment programs; its homelessness budget was nearly seven hundred million dollars. (New York City&#39;s was $1.4 billion, for about ten times the urban population.) From Bransten&#39;s perspective, the lockdown was an experience of absolute damage control, with winnowed ranks of care workers, like her, scrambling to protect a poor and unhoused population from the worst of a deadly pandemic. But after living through their own pandemic challenges, people had what Bransten calls “compassion fatigue.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;“It was a feeling of &#39;&lt;em>;Look&lt;/em>; at these people. Clearly nothing&#39;s working,&#39; ” she told me. “So we&#39;ll police them, arrest them, detain them, and charge them.” The proper role of law enforcement on the street has long been a debate across the moderate-progressive divide, but in recent years—first with the Black Lives Matter movement, then amid pandemic-era concern about crime—the topic has engulfed the city&#39;s politics.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;g9foi&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;“We have an understaffed police department,” Matt Dorsey, the supervisor for the South of Market section of downtown, said, citing a shortfall of seven hundred officers. Dorsey, a former police-department spokesperson, had the idea of adding fentanyl dealing to a list of crimes for which undocumented immigrants lose their sanctuary-city protections. “My hope was to incentivize a change to the drug market—if we went back to the good old days of heroin and Oxys, we&#39;ll save hundreds of lives every year,” he said. “It didn&#39;t go over well with my colleagues.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Last year, a city magistrate filed a temporary injunction declaring that, until San Francisco met its deficit of shelter beds, law enforcement couldn&#39;t compel anyone who was involuntarily unhoused to move off the street. The rule, which was intended to encourage construction, riled the retail and hospitality trades. “We&#39;ve got to take the handcuffs off the cops so that they can help these people get up off the sidewalks,” Brian Sheehy, who has opened a series of popular bars downtown in the past twenty years, told me. “San Francisco has to get back to being a destination.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;This year, the mayor&#39;s office signalled that it was emphasizing an enforcement philosophy (the idea that drug use is a crime) rather than relying, as it had in the past, on a harm-reduction philosophy (the idea that addiction is a disease). And the police have received a resource boost. In March, by an overwhelming majority, the Board of Supervisors passed the mayor&#39;s request for a midyear increase in police overtime funding of twenty-five million dollars. One of the two dissenting votes, the democratic-socialist supervisor Dean Preston, told me that he saw the request as a cynical effort to use worries about crime to direct cash toward an already overfunded department.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“That twenty-five million was in addition to a fifty-five-million increase last year, and a sixty-million increase this year, and a memorandum of understanding that approves a one-hundred-and-sixty-seven-million increase over the next three years,” he said. In pushing for that funding, politicians had highlighted the Tenderloin—part of Preston&#39;s district, and the poorest, densest neighborhood in the city, with the most street homelessness and open-air drug use. But the extra money, he found, wasn&#39;t for more policing there. Much of it covered shopping and tourist areas.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“When I walk by a luxury hotel downtown and I see four police officers standing there—just &lt;em>;standing&lt;/em>; there, for hours—and then I walk four blocks away, to the Tenderloin, where I have a merchant who&#39;s, like, &#39;Why is there no beat cop walking around here?,&#39; I would challenge any leader to look that merchant in the eye and say, &#39;Oh, it&#39;s because we have too few police officers,&#39; ” Preston told me. In the spring, he commissioned an audit of the police budget; it is pending. “I mean, we still fund, for millions of dollars, a mounted &lt;em>;horse&lt;/em>; unit.” He looked at me incredulously. “We just bought a new horse! In San Francisco! A dense urban city!”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;By a month and a half into her new job, Dennis Phillips had propped up a giant whiteboard in her office, in the bowels of City Hall, and divided it into three columns: “&lt;em >;PRIORITIES&lt;/em>;,” “&lt;em >;DOING&lt;/em>;?,” “&lt;em >;WANT TO DO&lt;/em>;.” When I visited her, one afternoon, the board was covered in ideas. “We&#39;re in a bit of a period of experimentation,” she told me, looking at the scrawl a little dazedly.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Given San Francisco&#39;s dearth of housing and glut of offices, many people had raised the possibility of residential conversions. “It is not an easy task, but one that other cities have done with regulatory changes and financial incentives,” Rich Hillis, the city&#39;s planning director, told me. In July, the mayor sent a letter inviting the University of California system to create a new campus downtown. Still, Dennis Phillips noted, many conversions would likely cost more than developers could expect to earn, making it a hard sell: “It&#39;s only twenty per cent of our strategy downtown.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The mandate for downtown included tax incentives and bureaucratic guidance to help get small businesses going, as well as placement services to drop pop-ups into storefronts and employees into jobs. In July, when Sapporo announced that it was shuttering the Anchor Brewing Company, a fixture in San Francisco since the nineteenth century, Dennis Phillips&#39;s office tried to help organize an employee buyout. (The effort failed.) She pinned some of her hope for filling offices on artificial intelligence—an idea that many techies share.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;“The best AI companies and engineers are all in San Francisco and the Bay Area, and they don&#39;t want to work separated and in silos,” the venture capitalist and political funder Ron Conway told me. It is true that three of the top players, OpenAI, Google AI, and Anthropic, in which Amazon has invested four billion dollars, are within city limits. It is also true that, just as app startups required fewer employees than, say, Citigroup, AI needs less office space than older tech: the great promise of AI, after all, is to obviate the need for labor.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“The AI industry is currently, but not for long, composed mostly of humans, and these humans are a social bunch,” Jeremiah Owyang, an entrepreneur and investor who works out of an Airstream trailer, said. “I&#39;ve been to meetups on the beach, bonfires. I&#39;ve been to house parties. That is their life stage. This is when you get your partners, get your VCs” Such human pleasures wouldn&#39;t last, he said. Workplaces in the industry were transitioning to a model known as AI First. “AI First means you turn to AI before you talk to a human. AI First means you turn to an AI before you hire. If the AI doesn&#39;t do it, you build it. If you can&#39;t build it, &lt;em>;then&lt;/em>; you hire someone.” He added, “That is a precursor of what&#39;s going to happen to corporate America.” The downtown of the future, then, will be a smaller, tighter, less worker-oriented place.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;feature-large-callout&quot; >;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;Smoke wafts in front of San Francisco City Hall.&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65289036701cbd1bcbc074e0/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/231023_r43224.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65289036701cbd1bcbc074e0/master/w_120,c_limit/231023_r43224.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65289036701cbd1bcbc074e0/master/w_240,c_limit/231023_r43224.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65289036701cbd1bcbc074e0/master/w_320,c_limit/231023_r43224.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65289036701cbd1bcbc074e0/master/w_640,c_limit/231023_r43224.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65289036701cbd1bcbc074e0/master/w_960,c_limit/231023_r43224.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65289036701cbd1bcbc074e0/master/w_1280,c_limit/231023_r43224.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65289036701cbd1bcbc074e0/master/w_1600,c_limit/231023_r43224.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;The idea that San Francisco is an exceptionally dysfunctional city has stuck in the popular imagination so much so that some posit that this idea itself is a political tool.&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Dennis Phillips had recently taken her staff to tour the Westfield San Francisco Centre. “We have to understand the possibilities of that building,” she explained. The mall loomed so large as a harbinger of San Francisco&#39;s struggles that I decided to see the damage myself. When I was growing up in San Francisco, at the turn of the millennium, the opening of the Westfield mall had seemed like the capstone of the city&#39;s rise. Now I expected a ruin—the remnant of a once triumphal age.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;As I approached, I found the stretch of downtown around the mall lively and crowded. People in the local office garb of slacks and zip vests brushed past, thumbing their smartphones. In front of the Dawn Club, a storied jazz bar that Sheehy reopened this year, men in suits were playing a game that they called Doomloopin Bowling on a strip of AstroTurf. Inside the mall, which as of now has no closure date, I saw customers flowing from Bloomingdale&#39;s. To my left, a Michael Kors salesperson chatted with a couple as, on my right, young men studied fancy watches in an IWC Schaffhausen. The food court was noisy, and there were no free tables at Panda Express. The grimmest space was on the top floor: a Cinemark whose lease is up in the fall had gone dark early. “They&#39;re closed,” a bored-looking guard announced to no one.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;j461ij&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;In public declarations, Westfield—like Gump&#39;s—laid the blame for its lack of business on the condition of San Francisco&#39;s downtown. But in the past forty years the number of malls in the United States has declined by nearly three-quarters, and a tour of downtown San Francisco today, its streets packed, its bars busy, can seem an odd me-or-your-lying-eyes experience. By many measures, San Francisco is the safest it has ever been. Violent crime is a third of what it was in 1985, and currently twenty per cent below the average of twenty-one major American cities.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The city has a triple-A credit rating. Most of its residential neighborhoods are clean and green and bustling. With the exception of the Tenderloin, the neighborhood from which most dire imagery comes, a walk through San Francisco is a stroll around an affluent Pacific capital of small bookstores and night markets and weekend festivals—so much so that one can almost wonder where the idea of a city in decline emerged.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“A lot of it is perception,” the mayor, London Breed, told me one day. “The feeling of &#39;I don&#39;t know if something is going to happen to me.&#39; ” We were sitting in her office, a wood-panelled sanctum deep in City Hall; a placard on her desk read “&lt;em >;WHAT WOULD BEYONCÉ DO&lt;/em>;?” “It&#39;s what people are seeing on the Internet,” she added.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Breed, who first took office in 2017, after the previous mayor died, grew up in public housing in the seventies and eighties. At a Board of Supervisors meeting in June, a program initiated by Breed that authorizes police officers to arrest people who appear to be using drugs on the street was challenged by Dean Preston, who noted that such programs had been shown to target people of color. Breed shot back, “Here we go—another white man who&#39;s talking about Black and brown people as if you&#39;re the savior of those people and you speak for them.” She said that he didn&#39;t understand what worked for real people: “It&#39;s not just services—it&#39;s also force.” Three weeks ago, in a controversial move, Breed called for new legislation barring individuals from receiving city assistance if they decline treatment after testing positive for drugs.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;On the Engardio spectrum, Breed&#39;s policies have been moderate. Her election campaign, in 2018, was funded in part by tech leaders. In many people&#39;s eyes, she distinguished herself with firm action at the start of the pandemic, averting the death spike of cities like New York by announcing a lockdown early and setting up emergency services. Yet on issues unanswerable to a simple executive order, such as homelessness or housing, she has taken public blame. “This mayor has no COO”—chief operating officer—a former member of her administration told me, suggesting that Breed didn&#39;t delegate enough to keep tabs on complex projects or their personnel. (In the past two years, top employees in the Public Works and Building Inspection departments have been convicted of bribery and corruption; both agencies report to the mayor.) Breed&#39;s approval ratings by some counts once hovered in the fifties, but, with anxiety about downtown growing, two-thirds of San Franciscans now disapprove of her, according to a recent poll.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;In February, Breed released what she called a “Roadmap to San Francisco&#39;s Future,” a set of policy tweaks that included simplifications to the small-business tax code. “We are trying to make things a lot easier, more efficient,” she explained in her office. I asked whether leaning heavily on tech to build up downtown had been a mistake. “We realize just how completely relying on office space, and mostly one industry, is not the right decision for any thriving downtown,” she conceded.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In June, Breed proposed turning the Westfield mall, which sits on land owned in part by the San Francisco school district, into a bio lab, or possibly a soccer stadium. She told me that she imagined chopping up large retail structures into mixed-use pieces: retail on the bottom, offices in the middle, housing on top—work already under way at the winnowed downtown Macy&#39;s. “We&#39;re changing what this historic building—with the best bathrooms in the city—is going to be,” she enthused.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Breed&#39;s critics say that proposing interesting ideas is not the same as executing them. “This mayor is not a collaborative mayor—she grew accustomed to issuing executive orders during &lt;em >;COVID&lt;/em>;,” Ahsha Safaí, a supervisor who has filed to run against Breed next year, told me at a sidewalk table recently. “My own home was broken into, and they stole my stove and my microwave,” he said. “And my hood fan!” He would deal with problems in a more results-chasing way, he said, and, as if to underscore the point, abruptly sprang up from the table where we sat to sprint after a woman who had left her backpack on a nearby chair. Pen in hand, I watched him vanish at a distance of one block, then another.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Something as acute and painful as what we&#39;re going through calls for an all-hands-on-deck approach—no one&#39;s coming to save us,” Daniel Lurie, another mayoral contender, told me. He is a fifth-generation San Franciscan whose family owns a majority of the shares of the Levi Strauss company. In 2005, he founded Tipping Point Community, a poverty-fighting nonprofit that has received donations from tech figures like Marc Benioff and Chris Larsen; he is presumed to be the candidate now favored by parts of the tech industry. I asked him whether, as a longtime local, he really thought that the city was in an uncommonly bad state.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“No, it&#39;s not as bad as everyone says,” he said, hesitantly. “But could it be a lot better? Yes.” He added, “I think there&#39;s a sense of”—he paused for a well-chosen word—“&lt;em>;disorder&lt;/em>; that is different. Before, everything wasn&#39;t locked up in the Walgreens. You didn&#39;t feel there were no consequences.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Just outside Breed&#39;s office, the series of plazas running east from City Hall, toward Market Street, has become one of the most visible reminders of both the drug trade and the city&#39;s unrealized goals. In 2017, the city commissioned a plan to remake the corridor. The landscape designer Willett Moss went on a listening tour of the abutting neighborhoods and drew up a green-space plan. (“If I think about any ambition for the city right now, it&#39;s to make a commitment to public space, and demonstrate that we&#39;re here to stay and we give a shit,” he told me.) In 2019, he submitted the plan, which was warmly received, then put on ice. The mayor told me that she didn&#39;t remember it; in July, the Recreation and Park Department announced that a renovation of one of the most drug-addled stretches of the corridor would center on a skate park. Phil Ginsburg, the department&#39;s director, said that the skate park was a placeholder while the city marshalled funds for the fully reimagined corridor—an investment, he said, “that San Franciscans and our government may or may not be able to stomach in one bite.”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;gz04y&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;In her office, Breed spoke about the difficulty of getting change through government. “First, I pray,” she said. “A lot of our rules and regulations are &#39;You can&#39;t do this, you can&#39;t do that,&#39; ” she went on. “How do we get to yes? How do we become what San Francisco is known for—being creative, innovative, where anything is possible?” I was surprised to find the head of the city lambasting the constraints of departments that she runs, until I realized that she was channelling public sentiment: in the bluest major city in America today, there is a sense that government is something that you work around or leave behind.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“They say that there&#39;s a doom loop, but do we believe that?” Manny Yekutiel cried.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“&lt;em>;No!&lt;/em>; ” a rowdy group of volunteers yelled back.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;“Are we going to show them wrong?”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“&lt;em>;Yes!&lt;/em>; ”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Yekutiel moved to San Francisco eleven years ago, partly as what he calls “a gay pilgrim”—his coming-out at home, in LA, had been uneasy—and partly as a veteran of Barack Obama&#39;s 2012 campaign team. His first job after that was at the tech-inflected advocacy group FWD.us, started by an Obama fund-raiser named Joe Green and Green&#39;s Harvard contemporary Mark Zuckerberg. Five years ago, Yekutiel opened Manny&#39;s, a café and civic-event space in the Mission District. Long a Latino neighborhood, then filled in by techies, the Mission these days is a snarl of conflicting interests; Yekutiel has sought to unite them, and to bring powerful people into the mix. “We&#39;ve hosted Adam Schiff, Jill Biden, Katie Porter, Barbara Lee, Kamala Harris, and Jane Fonda,” he said. Every Sunday morning, he holds what he calls a Disco Trash Pickup for the neighborhood; that Sunday, a hundred and twenty-two people had shown up to volunteer.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“What are the places where the government, private benefactors, and nonprofits aren&#39;t able to do the whole job?” Yekutiel said as he handed out orange vests, trash grabbers, bags, and gloves. “That&#39;s where people power comes in.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;An assistant named Caleb brought Yekutiel a curious platter of walnut-based dips, which he began to munch. “I love disco,” he explained. “I&#39;m full disco vibes all the time.” Wearing a pendulous disco-ball necklace over his vest and pink-tinted glasses shaped like hearts, he rose and took up a bullhorn to address the volunteers.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“This is why San Francisco is resilient! This is how our city is going to come out of this!”他哭了。 “All of you, on three, say &#39;Trash&#39;! One, two, three . 。 .”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Trash!” the volunteers yelled.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I took a trash grabber and accompanied Yekutiel to the alleyway beside his café. The street was filled with junk. “Don&#39;t pick that up,” Yekutiel told me as I snatched a plastic bag out of a puddle. “That&#39;s probably urine.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;To Yekutiel, the Disco Trash program, which has grown to pickups in nine neighborhoods, is an example of civic activism. “There&#39;s a bit of complacency, like”—he raised his voice in mock indignation—“ &#39;Why is there trash on the street?&#39; Well, what are you doing about it?” He picked up what looked to be a pair of underwear. “The government is—too much ideology. Not enough action. I guess that&#39;s what elections are for. But you can&#39;t rely on elections in a crisis.”&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;a data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a27170&amp;quot;}&quot;

This year, with Daniel Lurie, he created a nonprofit called the Civic Joy Fund, whose advisory board includes people who work in philanthropy, commerce, labor, City Hall, nonprofits, and drag performance. Its contributors include Visa and the Gap Foundation, both based in San Francisco, as well as tech multibillionaires such as Jack Dorsey. It metes out funding for, among other things, small public-art projects, habitat restoration, and a program for city-block improvements.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;We reached the end of the alley. Yekutiel suggested that we continue on a parallel street. The point of the cleanup, he said, is to give people a way to make change in the city beyond yearly visits to the voting booth. “Part of what San Francisco is famous for is this spirit of civic engagement—the Summer of Love, free clinics on Haight Street,” he said. “It&#39;s like Shabbat, you know? Everyone will go to a Shabbat dinner if they&#39;re invited.” We looked down the lane, where a small dumpster had been tipped over on the curb. “The food doesn&#39;t even need to be good,” he said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Even in 2021, San Francisco had the highest per-capita income level of any major city in America—something that would have been almost inconceivable a couple of generations earlier. In 1995, the city&#39;s average home value was about double the national mean; a quarter century later, it was five times as much. Organizers such as Yekutiel can work to balance opposing interests. Just as often, though, it happens that the city&#39;s old habit of turning to people power is harnessed for new priorities and goals.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;One fresh, cool morning, I stopped in the city&#39;s Hayes Valley neighborhood to meet a pair of tech workers, Sachin Agarwal and Steven Buss, who, in 2020, founded the organization GrowSF, now one of the largest nonprofit political spenders in San Francisco. They met me in a pedestrian square, known as Proxy, filled with French garden chairs the color of the Golden Gate Bridge. A passerby out for coffee hailed Agarwal as he sat. He shouted back, “You disappeared off the Internet—you don&#39;t use X!”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Twitter had been abruptly renamed two days before. I expressed surprise that the new branding was already in colloquial use.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“That bird was from 2012, so it&#39;s literally &lt;em>;eleven years old&lt;/em>;,” Agarwal told me. He had worked as a product manager at Twitter from 2012 to 2016. “The company was really dysfunctional,” he said. “You&#39;d ship these tiny little changes to the product, and almost nothing would change. I&#39;m not trying to say Elon has the answer, but at least he&#39;s going to try something totally different.” He added, “The fact that they were able to lay off, like, eighty per cent and the service is still up and running shows the amount of bloat, the layers of management, people eating free lunch on the rooftops!”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Agarwal&#39;s exasperation with Twitter mirrors his and Buss&#39;s exasperation with San Francisco. The city has an annual budget of fifteen billion dollars—for what? “We should have the best public education in the world, public safety, and clean streets. And the city is just not giving it to us,” Agarwal, who wore a GrowSF T-shirt, told me. Men beside him, at an outdoor LuxFit gym, were deadlifting and bench-pressing enormous bars of weight. “Huh-uhh-&lt;em>;uhhh!&lt;/em>; ” they cried.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Buss, who was wearing the same shirt, told me that he had felt a call to action after becoming aware of development obstructionism while living in a rent-controlled apartment in the Mission and working for Google. San Francisco has more community-review processes than most cities; local residents can call for the review of a building project in the run-up to its approval. In 2020, Buss ran for a seat on the Democratic County Central Committee. “I lost that race, but I took a lot of learnings from it,” he said. “In particular, I learned what makes a good candidate.”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;g8lha8&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;Volunteers in the Mission take part in Disco Trash Pickup wearing orange vests.&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6528903b02f4aa651b6e8b26/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/231023_r43225.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6528903b02f4aa651b6e8b26/master/w_120,c_limit/231023_r43225.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6528903b02f4aa651b6e8b26/master/w_240,c_limit/231023_r43225.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6528903b02f4aa651b6e8b26/master/w_320,c_limit/231023_r43225.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6528903b02f4aa651b6e8b26/master/w_640,c_limit/231023_r43225.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6528903b02f4aa651b6e8b26/master/w_960,c_limit/231023_r43225.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6528903b02f4aa651b6e8b26/master/w_1280,c_limit/231023_r43225.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6528903b02f4aa651b6e8b26/master/w_1600,c_limit/231023_r43225.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;Volunteers in the Mission take part in Disco Trash Pickup, a program that has spread to nine neighborhoods. “Part of what San Francisco is famous for is this spirit of civic engagement,” the program&#39;s founder said.&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;p >;The two created GrowSF with the idea that political change came through uniting candidates around a particular platform and winning elections. “You can&#39;t just go fight for every project one at a time,” Agarwal said. Instead, the organization, which operates a super &lt;em >;PAC&lt;/em>;, selects moderate candidates who align with its politics and puts money toward mailers and digital ads. It publishes an online voter guide that purports to pin down candidates&#39; exact positions—Agarwal and Buss send them questionnaires—and explains the finer points of local politics. San Francisco&#39;s five hundred thousand voters have been grateful for the guidance; in the elections last year, GrowSF&#39;s voter guide received four hundred thousand views, and nearly its entire slate was elected. Next year, it seeks to claim all six Board of Supervisor seats up for election, enough to give a moderate mayor full support—or to allow the board to override a progressive mayor&#39;s veto. San Francisco government could finally be run with executive force.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;GrowSF has also taken up the business of recalling elected officials who it thinks are underperforming. Last year, in addition to helping to coördinate the recall of three school-board members, the group assisted with the successful recall of the city&#39;s first-term district attorney, Chesa Boudin, whose efforts to reduce the number of incarcerations in the city had created friction with the police department—during Boudin&#39;s tenure, the over-all number of arrests in San Francisco dropped precipitously. A month after the recall vote, Boudin was replaced with Brooke Jenkins, a mayoral appointee, who has taken a tough-on-drugs tack.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“We&#39;re still just the two of us, but the reach we have is beyond what we could have dreamed of,” Agarwal said. (They recently hired a third employee.) Two men in shorts behind him performed bend-and-snaps with kettlebells.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;GrowSF is not the only nonprofit with center-left politics to have cropped up recently. “Our organization&#39;s real, big-picture goals are reforming the governance structure of San Francisco,” Kanishka Cheng, the CEO and co-founder of TogetherSF Action, which launched last year, told me. “We would argue that the executive doesn&#39;t have the ability to govern the city like an executive.” Four of the seven members of the police commission, for example, are appointed by the mayor but subject to Board of Supervisors approval; the others are appointed directly by the board.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;TogetherSF Action hosts the SF Politics 101 class led by Joel Engardio, whom it and GrowSF helped to elect, and develops other kinds of programming, too. “We launched this event called Why SF Is Broken, and we do it as a game-show format,” Cheng said. “We play a little game called SF in Jeopardy and teach you about the governance structure and what is broken.” In May, TogetherSF bought five hundred thousand dollars&#39; worth of ad space around town and launched a campaign with the slogan “That&#39;s Fentalife!” to rile middle-class indignation. “Drug dealers now have more rights than our kids,” went one ad; “Keys. Wallet. Narcan,” went another.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The campaign was controversial. Lydia Bransten, the executive director of the Gubbio Project, whose annual budget is three hundred and seventy-five thousand dollars, described it to me as “nasty.” “To blame poor and displaced people for decline when you had a whole influx of people who came to mine the city&#39;s wealth during the tech boom, drove the rents way up, got their money, and then, during &lt;em >;COVID&lt;/em>;, popped out? &lt;em>;No&lt;/em>;,” she said. Yet the idea that San Francisco is an exceptionally dysfunctional city has stuck in the popular imagination so much so that some posit that this idea itself has become a political tool.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Early in the pandemic, we came together around a very significant set of solutions, most of which were working,” Preston told me. “We rented out entire hotels. We were the only county in California that saw a &lt;em>;reduction&lt;/em>; of homelessness during the pandemic.” Far from being partisan feats of legislative obstruction, he said, these policies were approved unanimously. “We were told, &#39;Oh, it&#39;s a pandemic, no one will want a new tax&#39;—completely wrong,” he said. One ballot measure that passed added a tax on real-estate transactions worth more than ten million dollars; another added a tax on businesses whose highest-paid manager earns more than a hundred times the median employee salary.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;tc1c4&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;“What you&#39;re seeing now is a backlash and attempt to redefine all those kind of programs as failures,” Preston went on. A few weeks earlier, Elon Musk had begun targeting him personally, at one point tweeting that he “should go to prison” for his political work; Preston took this as evidence that a “billionaire class” was feeling threatened by the new policies. “There&#39;s an incredibly well-funded and now much more sophisticated echo chamber—some of which is smoke and mirrors, some of which isn&#39;t—to create the perception that the city has had a huge shift to the right.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;TogetherSF Action launched with funding from the investor and former venture capitalist Michael Moritz, who has recently become one of the most active contributors to civic and political organizations in town. In the past two years, he has helped fund Yekutiel and Lurie&#39;s Civic Joy Fund and co-founded the San Francisco Standard, a new digital media company rigorously reporting on the city&#39;s decline. I spoke with Moritz over Zoom one day. He had just left his decades-long post at Sequoia Capital and was enjoying a vacation.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“My apologies for this sort of unseemly attire, but I&#39;ve been out painting,” he said. He was wearing a floppy emerald-green fishing hat, a T-shirt, and cargo shorts. “The most important thing is for these groups, some of which I formed, to become a permanent part of the civic landscape in San Francisco. That will change everything. This is a long game.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Moritz—who is among the wealthy figures who recently invested in an effort to buy tens of thousands of acres of inland-California ranch land with the aim of building a new city—conceded that the problem was more perceptual than data-driven. “Have the major crimes escalated massively? No,” he said. “But with all the office workers gone the number of people on the streets has shrunk dramatically, which therefore puts the people who live in tents and the mentally ill and those with drug problems into far sharper relief because they can&#39;t as easily sort of melt into the backdrop.” Earlier this year, he published an op-ed in the &lt;em>;Financial Times&lt;/em>; that began, “It&#39;s a strange city that bans plastic straws but permits plastic needles.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Moritz told me that he became aware of the poor state of San Francisco&#39;s governance after the passage, in 2018, of Proposition C, which imposed a tax on businesses with more than fifty million dollars of gross annual receipts, earmarking the revenue for housing and mental-health initiatives for homeless populations. “A big part of the reason that downtown is empty is because a cadre of supervisors put a punitive measure on the ballot,” he said. (The measure actually got on the ballot through a collection of voter signatures.) “More money wasn&#39;t going to solve the problem! It&#39;s the lack of tailoring treatments to—and, where necessary, prosecuting—the people who are living on the streets.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Moritz excused himself to welcome some guests who had arrived. He pulled open the front door and said, merrily, “I see &lt;em>;intruders!&lt;/em>; ”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;He ushered them through a pair of French doors to seats in the sun, and padded back to the camera. I asked him whether he thought that devoting so much office space to tech had left downtown prone to crash. He didn&#39;t.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“San Francisco has Airbnb, Uber, Twitter—or X.com—Dropbox, Square, Instacart, Stripe, Pinterest, any number of companies,” he said. “Any big-city mayor anywhere in the world, if they had that number of companies start in their back yard, would have thought they were lodged on the golden seat in Heaven, right? Instead, these companies have become convenient targets to be attacked.” He grimaced. “My guess is that there are no more than a couple hundred people responsible for driving San Francisco to the precipice,” he declared. “I think those like myself have only ourselves to blame—for being absent from the debate.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;At the old Beat hangout Caffè Trieste one Saturday afternoon, I found Matt Dorsey at an outdoor table, deep in conversation with the president of the Board of Supervisors, Aaron Peskin—the longest-serving supervisor and a figure at once loved and loathed. To his supporters, he&#39;s a matador against stampeding billionaires, a protector of the inner politics of Chinatown, and a strong advocate for environmental causes. (Peskin, a bearish fifty-nine-year-old who swims the frigid, possibly unholy waters of the San Francisco Bay, has posed for &lt;em>;San Francisco&lt;/em>; magazine in a Speedo.) To his opponents, he&#39;s the exemplar of graybeard &lt;em >;NIMBY&lt;/em>;ism, the reason locals sit in hearings debating matters such as shadows cast by new condos instead of letting developers build the housing that the city so desperately needs.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Peskin and Dorsey, his ideological opposite by local measures, were brainstorming about downtown. Since the start of the pandemic, parts of Peskin&#39;s district, which comprises sections of downtown and the tourist mire of Fisherman&#39;s Wharf, have had some of the lowest commercial-vacancy rates in San Francisco—or, to put it another way, they have proved the most doom-loop-resistant areas of town. In Peskin&#39;s eyes, that&#39;s a lesson about the trade-offs between volatility and stability. Peskin told me, “There was this notion that Tech 2.0, after the Tech 1.0 contraction, was going to continue double-digit growth forever. Anybody who is rational and has lived twenty-five years would know that that is not true.” He wore a flowy black luau-style shirt with the word “&lt;em >;CALIFORNIA&lt;/em>;” patterned across it. A crinkled pink plastic bag containing a white onion and a lime was on the table before him; he was planning to make gazpacho later.&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot;

If you hit it right, you can make a boatload. If you miss it, you can end up giving the keys back and losing your ass. Welcome to capitalism.” In San Francisco, a law passed in the mid-eighties capped the amount of office space that could be built annually, with the unused quota carrying over—a regulatory guardrail that for years kept supply in line with demand and insulated San Francisco from the commercial-real-estate busts that were a regular feature in many midsize cities. Peskin blamed the city&#39;s housing dearth on market forces, not red tape. “Residential development has always been a principally permitted use in San Francisco&#39;s downtown—forever, forever!”他说。 The only reason there aren&#39;t huge, dense residential towers everywhere downtown, he said, is that office buildings were more lucrative.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Peskin sees his resistance to the rapid-growth trend as the reason for his district&#39;s resilience. Sure, the Italian cafés and jazz bars of North Beach, and the produce stalls and tea venders of Chinatown, don&#39;t scream City of the Future. But neither has demand for such businesses ever fallen off, regardless of the economy or where people keep their desks. “Do I care if I&#39;m making everybody feel good because there&#39;s a pop-up for two months? Not really,” he said of the city&#39;s recovery efforts. “Now, if that pop-up says, &#39;Wow, this is going great and I want to stay for ten years&#39;—&lt;em>;that&lt;/em>; was a success.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The city&#39;s longtime chief economist, Ted Egan, told me one afternoon that he could see four paths to disaster for a city like San Francisco. “Office industries are eighty per cent of our economy—everything depends on them,” he said. If so many workers vanished from downtown that retailers disappeared, causing more offices to shutter, that would be a doom loop. If public transportation had to cut service for want of fares, the city would grow unfriendly to work. If industry fled greater San Francisco, as car-making left Detroit in the fifties, a vortex could begin. And if tax revenue were so depleted that it required stripping services, the city could spin out.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Egan, a trim, bespectacled man employed by the controller&#39;s office to analyze the effects of proposed legislation, had suggested that we get drinks at the Iron Horse bar, near his office, and drew down a whiskey cocktail. The interesting thing, he told me, was that none of those bad things had happened. “In the past year, even downtown, sales-tax revenue is going up,” he said. “Retail stores are challenged because of shoplifting, but places like this”—he gestured at the faux-Tudor windows of the Iron Horse—“seem to be doing fine.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;The transit system received a $1.1-billion state bailout to continue service. “Everyone sort of thinks tech left, but all that happened is they work from home,” Egan said. Employment at San Francisco-based tech companies was, in fact, significantly higher than it had been at the start of the pandemic. “People sort of periodically rediscover that there&#39;s homelessness in San Francisco,” he added, dryly. “I wouldn&#39;t call it a shrinking problem, but they have managed to limit it out of the central business district, whose attractiveness they are focussed on.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;And tax revenue? “In 2021, we lost five hundred million dollars—a lot,” Egan said. He leaned across the table. “But the context for that is that we had seen so much growth in the last twenty years that we doubled our tax revenue per resident. We were &lt;em>;rolling&lt;/em>; in money.” Tax losses from commercial real estate were slim. “One of the things that makes it easy for us is Proposition 13”—the much maligned nineteen-seventies law that keyed California property taxes to value at the point of sale. “I never saw the good side of it until we realized how under-assessed all our office buildings are,” he said, explaining how the rule cushioned the change in revenue as building values collapsed. “We have to not make utterly moronic spending choices, and generally I think the city is more aware of reality than outsiders give it credit for.”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;feature-large-callout&quot; >;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;Jackson Square as seen through a window.&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/652890415d1f76ab48007bb3/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/231023_r43226.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/652890415d1f76ab48007bb3/master/w_120,c_limit/231023_r43226.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/652890415d1f76ab48007bb3/master/w_240,c_limit/231023_r43226.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/652890415d1f76ab48007bb3/master/w_320,c_limit/231023_r43226.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/652890415d1f76ab48007bb3/master/w_640,c_limit/231023_r43226.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/652890415d1f76ab48007bb3/master/w_960,c_limit/231023_r43226.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/652890415d1f76ab48007bb3/master/w_1280,c_limit/231023_r43226.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/652890415d1f76ab48007bb3/master/w_1600,c_limit/231023_r43226.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;Post-pandemic Jackson Square&amp;#8212;eclectic, crafty, and refined&amp;#8212;is on the rise. “You&#39;ve got this interesting mix&amp;#8212;some studios, creative spaces, designers, and then a lot of money coming in,” a restaurateur said.&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Egan knew how hard it was to keep people in the city after the pandemic: two years ago, he had a child and left the Bay Area for a house in Sacramento. Now he commutes in three days a week—which he finds more remunerative and pleasant than working at a suburban company. There are, he thinks, a lot of people like him: a major metropolitan downtown, like San Francisco&#39;s, is simply too well wired with transportation to empty out for long. Suburban office buildings were likelier to bear the brunt of the shift to remote work.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“&lt;em>;That&#39;s&lt;/em>; really what you want to convert into housing—the suburban office parks by the &lt;em >;BART&lt;/em>; train,” he said. “Converting an office building in downtown San Francisco makes no sense, which is why it&#39;s not happening.” This will be especially true, he thinks, as boom-time mortgages go into foreclosure and office rents fall.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“A one-bedroom was around three hundred per cent of the US average, and now it&#39;s around two hundred per cent,” Egan said. “A single-family house was six times the average. Now it&#39;s four. I think that&#39;s a remote-work trend that will continue. So then the question is: Who bites on cheap San Francisco housing? Is it students? Is it immigrants? Is it artists? Is it techies?”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In 2008, the restaurateur Lindsay Tusk and her husband, a chef, opened a restaurant in a part of San Francisco widely believed to be dead. The neighborhood, known as Jackson Square, had old colonnaded storefronts and an interesting history. It had once been a stomping ground for Mark Twain and his circle. (It was home to some excellent booze purveyors.) But the growth of the surrounding city had turned it into an awkward nowhere zone. “It was professional services, like dentists and lawyers,” Tusk told me. “There were tumbleweeds.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;She had loved the buildings, though—“single story or, at most, two stories, a very relatable kind of architecture,” she said—since discovering the neighborhood on a visit to William Stout Architectural Books when she was in college. “It had a very special gravitational pull.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;At some point last decade, Jackson Square started to change. Allbirds, the trendy shoe brand, set up its headquarters and flagship there. Fjällräven and other companies moved in. The Tusks&#39; fine-dining project, called Quince, soon began earning Michelin stars, and, in 2010, they opened a more casual companion, called Cotogna (“Quince” in Italian). During the pandemic, when the neighborhood again went dark, the Tusks opened a pop-up grocery and a farmers&#39; market and made delivery runs. Their restaurants survived.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;And then a curious thing happened: post-pandemic Jackson Square took off. Jony Ive had bought a couple of neighboring properties for his creative collective, LoveFrom, and, according to Tusk, planned to fill retail space with cobblers, bookbinders, and other craftspeople. (There may also be more twenty-first-century activities: it has been reported that LoveFrom is in conversations to produce the first OpenAI consumer device.) Thom Browne, the gray-clad designer of tucked ties and short trousers, opened his first urban California boutique. And Bain Capital is renovating a building on Cotogna&#39;s block, with the thought of bringing in a hundred employees.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;u0zyod&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;“Now you&#39;ve got this interesting mix—some studios, creative spaces, designers, and then a lot of money coming in,” Tusk told me at a table at Cotogna. We were eating a salad of gem-lettuce leaves dressed with Meyer-lemon zest and a plate of ravioli filled with corn and melted butter. (“Like summer to me,” she said.)&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;If global tech towers and fast-casual lunch chains reflected one downtown ideal, which is the model now in crisis, the post-pandemic downtown of Jackson Square—eclectic, crafty, and refined—is a vision on the rise. Traders of real estate have noticed. “&lt;em >;COVID&lt;/em>; changed the mind-set,” Michael Shvo, a New York-based real-estate magnate who bought the Transamerica Pyramid, in 2020, said. “Tenants want to come to work in a beautiful building with amenities and restaurants and places where they can meet friends and an ecosystem around their working environment.” Otherwise, why not work from home?&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot;

The trouble was that the public rarely used it. Shvo is fitting the redwood plaza with cafés to pick up on the flâneur commerce of Jackson Square. “Sometimes it requires an outsider to see what the insiders don&#39;t really see,” he told me. “The Pyramid is the second-most-expensive building to rent in America, in a market that many people have written off. Which tells you two things. No. 1, there is desire from great minds and great companies to be in San Francisco. And, two, tenants are willing to pay.” This year, he granted a lease at two hundred and fifty dollars a square foot—the most expensive office space in San Francisco to date.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;If the struggle in San Francisco&#39;s downtown is the struggle of the American urban dream—how to be a global city and a small, authentic town at the same time—the solution rests with those who can build bridges between structures of power and grassroots enterprise. As the pandemic took hold, Jacob Bindman, a recent college graduate, found himself at home, in San Francisco, looking for a job. On March 10th, days before the city&#39;s lockdown, Lenore Estrada, his former boss at a bakery that did catering for big tech companies, contacted him in a state of alarm: March 14th was Pi Day.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Which does not matter unless you own a pie business in San Francisco, in which case it&#39;s on par with Thanksgiving,” Bindman explained. “In something like a six-hour window, she had one hundred per cent of her Pi Day orders cancelled, which represented about a hundred and fifty thousand dollars&#39; worth of product already made. I was, like, What can we do with this huge volume of pie?”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;As they mulled over the problem, they happened to hear that organizations that provided food to people in need had had their normal operations curtailed by the lockdown. They saw that the two problems fit together. “We know there&#39;s a bunch of restaurants that need capital, and we know there&#39;s a bunch of people who need food,” Bindman said. One of Estrada&#39;s friends, the Twitch co-founder Emmett Shear, offered a million dollars to help connect the halves.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Four days later, Bindman, Estrada, and a group of ten friends began buying meals from restaurants and delivering them to food-relief programs. In their first week, they delivered a thousand meals. In their second, eighteen thousand. By May, they were sending fifty thousand meals around the city. To every new restaurant they worked with they committed to spend at least eight thousand dollars a week for ten weeks. When Shear&#39;s money started to run out, the delivery team applied for funding to the city government, which opened two contracts of ten to twenty million dollars each, for distribution to homebound seniors and to converted shelter hotels.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Today, the project, a nonprofit called SF New Deal, works with Dennis Phillips&#39;s office as a liaison between the city government, private donors, and small businesses, to which it offers services. It runs a transportation program for workers and helps businesses bring outdoor dining structures into compliance. And now, with Dennis Phillips, it places businesses, artists, and pop-ups in empty spaces around town; all the while, it collects data to fine-tune its services to suit common needs. Bindman told me that he saw the effort as at once exacting and broad.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“There has been an obsession for a long time around whose job it is to fix San Francisco,” Bindman told me. “There&#39;s definitely a strong belief that&#39;s, like, &#39;Tech people made problems. Tech people need to fix problems.&#39; There&#39;s a strong cohort that&#39;s, like, &#39;We pay a bunch of taxes. The government needs to be able to solve this.&#39; And there&#39;s a cohort of people who are, like, &#39;Only people from San Francisco can solve San Francisco.&#39; ”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Traffic washed by. We were sitting at a sidewalk table at a café on the corner of Arguello and Clement, near the apartment where Bindman lives and works—the nonprofit has no offices. I had taken a long walk across San Francisco, through the neighborhoods and parks and out toward the ocean. It was a bright and sunny day with tufted clouds and breezes sweeping in off the Pacific, and I allowed myself to think that the city had not in years felt quite so set for possibility, so open and warm. “I think what SF New Deal represents is the very obvious answer, which is: everyone. &lt;em>;Everyone&lt;/em>; is responsible,” Bindman said. He took a sip of coffee and looked up. “The only solution that&#39;s a real solution is a solution in which everyone is involved.” ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 16 Oct 2023 19:06:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[The Great Cash-for-Carbon Hustle]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/10/23/the-great-cash-for-carbon-hustle]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-16T10:00:00.000Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6528991e5ebc1b662f97d8de/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/231023_r43197web.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;article >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attribute-verso-pattern=&quot;article-body&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;ArticlePageChunks&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;One evening in November, 2021, a group of men assembled at sundown on the terrace of the Ruckomechi Camp, a safari resort on the Zambezi River. Since arriving by private plane, they had gone out lion-spotting, boated down the river, and landed a giant tiger fish; now they were clinking gin-and-tonics. Hippos wallowed in the water below.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The party was led by Renat Heuberger, a forty-four-year-old Swiss entrepreneur with narrow eyes and a cropped copper beard. Heuberger was the chief executive of South Pole, the world&#39;s largest carbon-offsetting firm, and he had come to Zimbabwe to fight off an urgent threat to his company.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;A decade earlier, South Pole had signed a deal to sell carbon offsets from an effort to protect a vast swath of forest on the banks of Lake Kariba, upriver from the camp. The Kariba project, spanning an area ten times the size of New York City, was among the world&#39;s first “avoided deforestation” programs; by deterring local people from chopping down trees, it promised to prevent the release of tens of millions of tons of greenhouse gas. Leading corporations, including Volkswagen, Gucci, Nestlé, Porsche, and Delta Air Lines, paid South Pole nearly a hundred million dollars for Kariba credits, allowing them to market goods or services as “carbon neutral.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;South Pole thus pioneered a model of carbon offsetting that has been counted among our best hopes for staving off climate catastrophe: a mechanism that diverts funds from polluters in wealthy countries to protect crucial ecosystems in the Global South. Heuberger, a kinetic, grandiloquent man, speaks expansively about his mission. “We&#39;re here to save the climate,” he told me.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;As a child, Heuberger spent his spare time gluing protest flyers to car windows, and he considered himself an activist. But, as he built his company, he had developed a consumer-friendly brand of climate optimism. “It&#39;s not true that to save the climate we will all need to go into perpetual lockdown or stop having fun,” he said, promoting Porsche&#39;s offsetting program. “In fact, it&#39;s the opposite”—drivers should enjoy their vehicles, knowing that “every ton of CO&lt;sub>;2&lt;/sub>; they compensate for is backed by a verified emission reduction.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;This perspective was enthusiastically received: Heuberger had regular speaking engagements at Davos and a spot in the World Economic Forum&#39;s network of experts. As brands scrambled for inexpensive ways to reduce emissions, the market for offsets surged, quadrupling in 2021 alone. That year, South Pole was approaching a billion-dollar valuation, which would make it the world&#39;s first “carbon unicorn.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;But alarming news had reached the company&#39;s headquarters, in Zurich: it was at risk of losing its most lucrative project. By the terms of the Kariba deal, the company purchased carbon credits from a developer who oversaw the area&#39;s forestland, and sold them for a twenty-five-per-cent commission. Now a competitor had offered the developer a substantial payment to take over the project. To help devise a response, Heuberger turned to an old friend from college, Dirk Muench, who had recently joined South Pole. Muench had left Wall Street to support climate action in the world&#39;s poorest places. He was a self-confessed stickler, and could be too fastidious for Heuberger&#39;s taste—but he was a skilled dealmaker.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;When Muench heard the details, he was astonished that South Pole had done so little to secure its most important project. The entire agreement rested on a perfunctory contract that the developer, a white Zimbabwean tycoon named Steve Wentzel, could break anytime. To insure Wentzel&#39;s loyalty, Muench urged Heuberger to buy a stake in his business. They flew to Harare and took a chartered plane to the safari camp to conduct the negotiations in style.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Wentzel, a trim, chiselled man with a buzz cut silvering at the sides, was a former show jumper who had made a fortune in offshore finance and then started investing in gold mines. On safari, he confided that he had no expertise in forest preservation; he had tried out carbon offsetting on a whim, when he was given a parcel of land as payment for a debt. (He told me the same story this July. “I don&#39;t know anything,” he said. “I&#39;m not a tree scientist or anything like that.”)&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Muench began to feel perturbed. A core principle of carbon offsetting holds that profits should be shared with local people, and South Pole maintains in its promotional literature that “communities living in the Kariba project area are the owners and main beneficiaries.” But, as Wentzel described his indoor horse-riding range in Harare and his varied business interests, Muench wondered how much of the money that corporations spent on Kariba credits made it to the people on the ground.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;As Muench probed Wentzel about the workings of his business, Heuberger was abashed. “If you want to survive as a businessman in Zimbabwe, you have to be a little bit of a special character,” he later said. “We need to treat him with a little bit of respect.” Wentzel told me that the inquiries didn&#39;t bother him: “I was, like, Yeah, whatever. As long as I get my end of the deal.” Still, he had no intention of disclosing his financial practices. “You have your ways and means, and they&#39;re not all traceable, put it that way,” he said. “No one actually has a damn clue about what&#39;s going on. Not even South Pole. I hold the key to Pandora&#39;s box.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;As the men sipped their sundowners, Heuberger made Wentzel a striking offer. South Pole would pay about thirty million dollars for almost eight million credits. It would also open negotiations for a multimillion-dollar equity stake in his company, Carbon Green Investments. Wentzel agreed, and the mood on the terrace turned jubilant. Food and wine were ordered, and the celebrations continued by lantern light.&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;a data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a28253&amp;quot;}&quot;

Back in Zurich, he kept asking questions. “I said, &#39;Do you know what happens with the money?&#39; And then someone told me, &#39;Dirk, you should look at the carbon side of this project—not just at the finances—to understand how bad it is.&#39; ”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The notion of carbon as a fungible commodity, like coffee or cotton, emerged in the late nineteen-eighties. As humanity reckoned with the harms of fossil fuels, a US power company named Applied Energy Services conceived a novel way to reduce emissions: it could surround its main coal-fired power station with a forest, to absorb the carbon billowing from its chimney.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;That plan turned out to be implausible. Scientists calculated that, to absorb the carbon the facility would pump out in its life span, the company needed to plant some fifty-two million trees—an impossibility in densely populated Connecticut. Then an executive named Sheryl Sturges had an inspiration: since the atmosphere was a global commons, why not situate the forest elsewhere? The company eventually paid for forty thousand farmers to plant trees in the mountains of Guatemala. It cost just two million dollars—pennies per ton of carbon.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Sturges&#39;s idea caught the world&#39;s attention. “Antidote for a Smokestack,” a headline in &lt;em>;Time&lt;/em>; magazine announced. A decade later, the concept of carbon offsetting was enshrined in international law, as thirty-seven industrialized nations and the European Union agreed to emissions-reduction targets under the Kyoto Protocol. Through the United Nations&#39; Clean Development Mechanism, rich countries struggling to meet their goals could compensate by paying for projects in impoverished ones.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;1c1fw2&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Growing up in Zurich, Heuberger had been terrified by the environmental calamities that defined the eighties and nineties: Chernobyl, the ozone hole, acid rain. He was a bright, sensitive boy who spent most of his time alone, biking in the mountains and memorizing train timetables. His anxiety about the threats to the planet became “paralyzing,” he told me. When the Kyoto deal was signed, he had recently returned from a year as an exchange student in Indonesia, where he was “completely overwhelmed” by the experience of poverty. The prospect of a global trade in carbon struck him as a panacea—a way of using capitalist methods for radical aims. “Polluter pays, cleaner earns,” he figured. “You could take the tools of the enemy and make them work for a better world.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Heuberger enrolled to study environmental science at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, where he found like-minded peers: young environmentalists who gathered to dream up gambits, from supplying the campus with organic coffee to publishing a magazine about sustainability. Among them was Muench, who was studying industrial engineering. “Renat was a little bit socially awkward, but also genuinely impressive,” he told me. “He was like one of those activist environmentalists, whereas I was a typical business guy.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In 2002, as they neared the end of their studies, Heuberger, Muench, and a classmate named Patrick Bürgi were invited to a sustainability conference in Costa Rica. Preparing a presentation on carbon trading, Heuberger and Bürgi decided to make the concept more tangible by asking attendees to pay to offset the emissions from their flights. They got hold of a credit-card imprinter and ambushed delegates after each session: “Do you know that you emitted two tons of CO&lt;sub>;2&lt;/sub>; by coming to this conference?” They raised more than ten thousand dollars. “It was quite easy to convince them,” Bürgi said. “And then we started to get nervous—&#39;What are we going to do with the money?&#39; ”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In the end, they donated the funds to the university hosting the event, to install solar heaters in place of a diesel boiler that supplied gym showers—an intervention that, by their reckoning, saved around seventy tons of carbon a year. “It was all kind of handmade and improvised,” Bürgi said. “But it was so successful.” Back home, he and Heuberger, along with a few friends, registered a nonprofit named MyClimate to continue offering offsets. (Muench, less confident in the project, left to pursue a career in investment banking.) They set up shop in the office of a supportive professor, launching a rudimentary Web site that allowed people to calculate their emissions and pay the appropriate penance. Carbon “tickets” were printed out and mailed to customers—until the venture became so successful that the professor complained they were using up all his toner.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;By the time the Kyoto Protocol was ratified, in 2005, MyClimate was financing significant climate-action projects, including an initiative to supply clean electricity to a hundred Indian villages; it soon won a contract to compensate for emissions from the &lt;em >;FIFA&lt;/em>; World Cup in Germany. The founders were still operating on a tiny budget, yet, as the UN&#39;s carbon-trading system got under way, they saw new possibilities. In a multibillion-dollar market, perhaps the profit motive would be the most effective way to spur action. “Capitalism works very efficiently,” Heuberger said. “The idea that you could actually make money is a massive driver.” The following year, he and Bürgi left their student venture behind and registered a company with three other friends, with a maxim of “profit for purpose.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The new business would focus on cultivating projects to sell credits through the UN system. The name, South Pole, referred both to Antarctica&#39;s melting ice caps and to the Global South, where most of its projects would be based. Heuberger borrowed twenty thousand francs from his parents for his stake in the business, and the entrepreneurs secured a workspace: a disused university chemistry lab, with long banks of sinks and cannisters of nitrogen that clients sometimes mistook for sequestered carbon. In the summer, they took breaks to swim in the Limmat, and in the winter they skied together.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Their first breakthrough came easily. China had just announced a five-year plan for renewable energy, and developers of wind, solar, and hydropower plants were gathering for the country&#39;s first Carbon Expo. Heuberger called a backpacking buddy who spoke Chinese and asked him to meet in Beijing. They printed business cards with a penguin logo, and scheduled meetings with developers in the lobbies of five-star hotels, though they were sleeping in a youth hostel.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;South Pole&#39;s pitch was simple: it would help developers sell credits based on the carbon that would have been emitted if the power they produced had instead come from fossil fuels. The income would be small compared with what they made selling electricity, but it would come at no cost; South Pole would take care of all the complex carbon accounting, in exchange for a commission.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Heuberger&#39;s meetings at the conference led to several large projects, including a sprawling network of hydropower plants in the mountains of southwest China. After that, the company expanded rapidly. The founders scattered across Asia, Africa, and Latin America, signing up hundreds more projects. Soon, South Pole had opened branches in Thailand, Mexico, Indonesia, and India. Staffers, who came to be known as “penguins,” greeted new employees with cries of “Welcome to the iceberg!”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In the years after the Kyoto targets came into effect, thousands of projects were registered under the UN&#39;s Clean Development Mechanism, and hundreds of millions of credits were issued, each worth one metric ton of carbon. Yet, as the market grew, so did questions about its integrity. Scholars worried that developers would inflate their projects&#39; climate impact. Many environmentalists dismissed offsetting as a system of empty indulgences. One online spoof invited unfaithful spouses to pay someone else to remain faithful: “By paying Cheat Neutral, you&#39;re funding monogamy-boosting offset projects.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;At parties in Zurich, South Pole&#39;s founders were grilled about the ethics of the carbon trade. “We were constantly challenged by friends,” Bürgi told me. But Heuberger brushed aside such concerns. If humanity was to have any chance of saving itself, he was convinced, “there must be a positive narrative to climate action.” When skeptics disagreed, he told me, his reaction was “Shut up. Keep it to yourself. Because we are on a mission here.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In 2009, South Pole attracted its first major investment, from BP. An executive in the oil company&#39;s alternative-energy division, Justin Adams, took a seat on South Pole&#39;s board, and made a close study of Heuberger. “Renat&#39;s a complex character, who I think is extremely strategic and thoughtful about how you can give people some hope in a time of fear,” he told me. “But I suspect, like so many of us, there are deeper shadows in our own psyches. He had all the makings of a little emperor, and he&#39;s incredibly tough.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The association with a major oil company didn&#39;t trouble Heuberger. “We can talk to the biggest boys in the world,” he said. With the market flourishing, he became increasingly focussed on maximizing revenue. “I want to spin a big wheel,” he told me. “With more money we can have more impact. We can do better, bigger things.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;One day in 2010, an e-mail from Steve Wentzel, the Zimbabwean tycoon, arrived in the in-box of one of South Pole&#39;s founders—a tall, bluff German man named Christian Dannecker. It invited the company to enter new territory.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Wentzel ran a business in Guernsey that promised to “provide financial liberty through modern off shore financial services,” as well as a money-lending enterprise based in Mauritius. He had recently acquired a parcel of woodland from a debtor who had failed to repay a large loan. The surrounding area was thronged with endangered wildlife, but the plot had been devastated by trophy hunting—“If you see a rabbit, it&#39;s a tourist,” Wentzel said. At first, he thought that the land had little use. Then he heard about carbon credits and thought, “Let&#39;s see whether we can recoup our money that way.” He found South Pole through Google.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Dannecker was thrilled. He had a passion for trees, and had often urged Heuberger to consider forest-carbon projects. “It&#39;s bloody tricky, but it needs to work, because otherwise climate finance will not reach those remote corners of the world,” he said.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;dajdai&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Dannecker flew to Zimbabwe with a team of experts to assess the possibilities. Wentzel&#39;s land was in the Binga district, south of Lake Kariba, an area threatened by economic turbulence. Zimbabwe was beset by hyperinflation—the South Pole team brought home a trillion-dollar bill as a souvenir—and by mass unemployment. Subsistence farmers were clearing patches of forest to plant crops, graze animals, and gather firewood. Dannecker and Wentzel figured that they could change those habits, largely by providing training in sustainable agriculture, and then sell credits based on the trees that they protected. “It&#39;s the bloody poorest area in the world that I have ever been in,” Dannecker said. “This is where the money should go.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;To secure coöperation in the area, flyers were distributed with cartoons of trees growing in the shape of dollar signs. Wentzel persuaded local chiefs to allow him to expand the project across four large districts, spanning two million acres of forest. In exchange, he promised that seventy per cent of his revenues from the sale of carbon credits would be invested in Kariba and shared with the populace. “They all jumped on the bandwagon,” Wentzel told me.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;To Wentzel&#39;s mind, the people living in the forest would be getting money for nothing. “Don&#39;t cut the trees down, that&#39;s about the sum total of what they have to do,” he said. “We don&#39;t ask them to get up in the morning, we don&#39;t ask them to do press-ups, we don&#39;t ask the birds to fly backwards. It is just a net positive for them.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;He set up a company, Carbon Green Investments, to receive the sales proceeds from South Pole, and opened its accounts in the tax haven of Guernsey. “You have to use certain conduits,” he told me. “Ultimately, my goal is to make sure that the project succeeds, and everyone gets the benefit. How it gets there? I&#39;d rather you didn&#39;t ask those questions.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;There is no hope of curbing the worst effects of climate change without saving our remaining forests. Earth&#39;s three trillion trees absorb nearly a third of humanity&#39;s carbon output, yet they continue to be destroyed at an alarming rate, releasing those stores back into the atmosphere. Forest-based offsetting rests on a simple premise: if this carbon payload can be sold, it becomes more lucrative to leave trees standing than to cut them down.&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot;

To do so, you must demonstrate that the forest would have been razed without protection—a counterfactual that is nearly impossible to prove. There are also issues of “leakage”: even if the agents of deforestation are driven out of one area, they may cut down trees someplace else. Then there is the question of permanence. Greenhouse gases can linger in the atmosphere for thousands of years—but forests are vulnerable to wildfires and other calamities, and most protection schemes last no more than a few decades. Twenty years after Applied Energy Services funded the Guatemalan tree-planting project, researchers found that it had largely failed. (AES disputes this.) The enormous amount of land and labor devoted to forestry had led to food shortages, and arguments had broken out; some farmers had simply refused to plant the trees. In the end, the researchers calculated, the program had offset only about ten per cent of the emissions from the coal plant in Connecticut.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The UN&#39;s carbon system allowed offsets in a variety of categories, but it excluded forest-carbon projects, because of the particular challenges of verifying their benefits. UN officials had deliberated over an assessment framework called &lt;em >;REDD&lt;/em>;—“reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation in developing countries”—to distinguish the worthwhile forest-carbon projects from the boondoggles. But, from the beginning, there was controversy over the science, and concern over the human cost of a forest-carbon boom. White developers had begun buying up forestland in the Global South, and reports emerged of “carbon cowboys” using violence and trickery to drive Indigenous people from their territories.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Though the UN carbon-trading system never implemented the &lt;em >;REDD&lt;/em>; framework, it was taken up by a rival source of accreditation: a nonprofit in Washington, DC, launched by carbon-industry players. The agency, which became known as Verra, had adopted the UN&#39;s accounting methodologies, promising to apply them with a lighter touch.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Verra allowed developers to choose among several different ways to calculate the credits that their projects would generate. That alarmed critics, who warned that developers would simply select whatever model yielded the most credits. The agency&#39;s longtime chief executive, an environmental entrepreneur named David Antonioli, acknowledged the problem but told me, “If you require perfection, you&#39;ll have a hundred million dollars&#39; worth of climate action. If you&#39;re more pragmatic about it, you might have two billion or five billion.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;To register the Kariba project with Verra, South Pole had to predict how much of the forest would be lost without any intervention, and thus determine how much carbon the scheme would conserve over a thirty-year life span. Credits would be issued every year against that total, and the prediction would be checked once a decade, by comparing Kariba with an unguarded reference area nearby. South Pole&#39;s data analysts initially estimated that the program could save around fifty-two million tons of carbon. But Verra required them to rerun these calculations using one of its approved methodologies. The scientists used one named VM9, which generated a startlingly different projection: if the Kariba site was left undefended, deforestation would explode, resulting in the eventual loss of ninety-six per cent of the forest. On that basis, the project would be eligible for almost two hundred million credits—four times the initial estimate.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Wentzel was delighted. At the time, the price of a single credit was about ten euros, suggesting that his cut might amount to hundreds of millions. The project began operating in 2011, opening a patchwork of community gardens and beehives across the site. “This is me on the way to getting this money back,” he said. Then, with shocking abruptness, the carbon market collapsed.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“I remember watching the price curve in disbelief,” Heuberger told me. “You&#39;d check at 9 &lt;em >;am&lt;/em>;, you&#39;d check at 10 &lt;em >;am&lt;/em>;, you&#39;d check at 11 &lt;em >;am&lt;/em>;, and every time it has fallen another five cents.” By the end of 2012, the price of a single credit, which had peaked at twenty-five euros, had tumbled to thirty-nine cents.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Since the Kyoto Protocol had come into force, the market had been driven by government regulations, which obliged polluters that couldn&#39;t reduce their emissions to buy credits instead. When the financial crisis caused a slump in industrial activity, demand plunged.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Investors&#39; confidence was further eroded by a series of scandals. Boiler-room scams selling fake offsets had sprung up across Europe, and hackers had penetrated the carbon registries of national governments to siphon off credits. One sprawling fraud, described by French police as “the heist of the century,” had cost tax authorities five billion euros. After it was exposed, the Danish government admitted that eighty per cent of the country&#39;s carbon-trading firms were fronts for the racket.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Even the legitimate programs inspired little confidence. The UN&#39;s Clean Development Mechanism had issued more than a billion carbon credits—three-quarters of which researchers later found to be environmentally dubious. Many of the projects were in China, including the sorts of renewable-energy schemes that South Pole was marketing. These plants, critics said, were too profitable to need carbon finance, and the credits they sold gave buyers license to go on polluting. Still more problematic were coolant factories that deliberately increased production of greenhouse gases, then profited by capturing and destroying them.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The greatest blow to the market was the failure of international climate agreements. The UN&#39;s Copenhagen summit, in 2009, was supposed to produce new binding emissions limits, but the negotiations collapsed. Three years later, the Kyoto Protocol&#39;s first commitment period skittered to a chaotic end, with almost half the participants having missed their targets and major players refusing to accept new ones. (The US never ratified the agreement.)&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;r47e9&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;“After ten years of believing that governments are lifting up the better world, the plug was out,” Heuberger said. He resolved that the market must be rebuilt, but this time the private sector would have to take the lead. “The UN was gone, the governments were gone. We and Verra were still around, so we did it ourselves,” he said. “Of course, it was not perfect. But it was the only show in town.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Heuberger summoned his team to a seaside resort in Krabi, on the coast of Thailand—a province of white-sand beaches, mangrove forests, and jungle islands. There, he outlined a plan to reposition South Pole. Rather than cater to clients struggling to meet government emissions caps, it would serve the so-called voluntary market—companies who chose to diminish their climate impact, for reasons of ethics or public relations.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Even with the market in retreat, South Pole planned to continue signing up new projects and stockpiling credits. Heuberger was convinced that the demand would soon rebound, and that his company would occupy a position of unchallenged dominance. “Everyone else is dead,” he said. “We are going to come out big here.” As it happened, it would take years for the market to recover, but Heuberger was right that the absence of competition would provide an advantage. South Pole could “very easily contract with project developers, because there were no other buyers,” Hannes Zimmermann, a former corporate-investment director at the company, told me.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;As South Pole grew more dominant, some employees felt that it was straying from its purpose. Among the dozens of current and former staffers I spoke to, one quit after being asked to work with a chemical company whose carbon-offsetting proposals seemed to have no climate value. A second resigned after becoming concerned that South Pole was making exaggerated claims about its projects&#39; benefits for local communities. Others objected to deals with commercial timber companies, which could earn credits by leaving tree plantations standing for a short time before cutting them down. One such scheme, which South Pole told clients would transform “degraded land in rural Mexico by sustainably growing teak trees,” was run by a company that derives more than ninety-seven per cent of its revenues from logging.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Christoph Sutter, who served as the company&#39;s founding CEO before agreeing to share the role with Heuberger, had written a doctoral thesis on assessing the impact of offsetting projects. But, in six years leading South Pole, he had come to doubt the value of the carbon trade, particularly the sort of large renewable-energy projects South Pole was promoting. “I was building up this worry,” he said. “It&#39;s just paper credits.” He told me that he remained friends with Heuberger, but did not share his encompassing faith in offsetting. “The big majority of what you see in the market, in my view, boils down to a lot of greenwashing, a lot of marketing, a lot of money-making,” he said. Heuberger had little patience for that sort of negativity. “Investors can smell it if the mood is not good,” he said. Sutter quietly resigned in 2012.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In the depths of the crash, Wentzel became increasingly disillusioned. His income from credit sales had collapsed, and yet, by his estimate, it cost about sixty thousand dollars a month to pay for his project&#39;s staff and initiatives—community gardens, beehives, wells, fire protection. “I got myself into quite a big hole,” he told me.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Local people were hardly lining up to thank him. In 2014, a community leader named Elmon Mudenda travelled to a Transparency International workshop in Harare and suggested that the Kariba project was a scam. “We have not seen anything really tangible,” he said, according to the Zimbabwe &lt;em>;Herald&lt;/em>;.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The following year, two Zimbabwean researchers travelled to the site to interview residents and published a damning study, “Struggles Over Carbon in the Zambezi Valley.” They reported that the project&#39;s developers believed that “communal resources, including forests and wildlife, are there for the taking.” The district councils, the study found, were “like a sleeping partner, with very little knowledge of what the project is all about and with no voice in its direction.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;As pressure from the community mounted, Wentzel lost patience. One Saturday, he called South Pole and threatened to scrap the whole enterprise. “Carbon is nonsense,” Dannecker recalled him saying. Wentzel demanded a million dollars by Monday to keep the project alive. Heuberger was at a friend&#39;s wedding in Italy when he heard the news. “We made a snap decision to ship the money,” he told me. “Of course, we wanted something against that money. So we just took a few credits.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In fact, South Pole bought three million credits, at a low price of fifty cents apiece; it bought about the same number the following year. Ordinarily, the company made money by acting as an intermediary, selling credits on behalf of developers and charging a commission. Now it bought the credits directly, meaning that it would keep all the profits when they were sold. Wentzel told me that, after receiving the funds, he drove through the Kariba site, settling his obligations with bundles of cash. “A hundred thousand dollars is only as big as a brick,” he said. “It&#39;s not difficult to carry it around.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The intervention revived the project. Mudenda, the community leader who had previously criticized Kariba, now praised its beekeeping efforts to a local newspaper; villagers were making four hundred dollars for harvests of organic honey. In 2016, Dannecker flew to Zimbabwe, and blogged about his visit under the heading “Why I Get Out of Bed Every Morning.” The area had undergone a drought, but the project&#39;s wells had provided water, and its farming efforts had yielded food. “Sometimes, the business feels like what it is—a business,” he wrote. “But it&#39;s actually much more: our business has a purpose.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Yet the company&#39;s business in Zimbabwe rested on a shaky foundation. Project monitors had surveyed the site and found fewer trees than South Pole planned to claim credit for. Then Dannecker learned something even more alarming: the rate of forest loss in the project&#39;s reference region—the benchmark against which its success would be measured—was starkly lower than projected. The wave of deforestation that South Pole&#39;s efforts were supposed to prevent was looking more like a trickle, which could significantly diminish the value of the project.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Dannecker decided not to do anything rash. “There was no urgency, for two reasons,” he told me. First, there were still years to go before South Pole was due to check its model against reality. Second, amid the market slump, “there was no bloody demand” for the Kariba credits anyway. But that was about to change.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;One Friday in August, 2018, a small figure in a yellow raincoat shuffled up to the Swedish Parliament in Stockholm and sat down at the foot of the building. Beside her was a sign painted with block letters: “&lt;em >;SKOLSTREJK FÖR KLIMATET&lt;/em>;.”&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;a data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a28116&amp;quot;}&quot;

The movement that she inspired, in which millions of children skipped class to demand climate action, gave rise to the biggest environmental protests in history. To Heuberger, himself a former child activist, the fifteen-year-old Swede seemed like a kindred spirit. “Greta Thunberg and the climate strike were of outstanding importance,” he said at the time. “Today, no listed company can afford to be on the sidelines when it comes to climate protection.”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;xeilob&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;The strike, playing out amid wildfires and increasingly apocalyptic weather, put renewed pressure on the world&#39;s largest companies. South Pole&#39;s business soared. “Going carbon neutral is the latest luxury trend,” the company proclaimed, after Gucci announced that it would use South Pole credits to cancel out the emissions of its supply chain. Nestlé soon declared that Kit Kats and Nespresso pods would become carbon neutral. Porsche assured customers that the emissions from ten thousand miles in a Cayenne could be scrubbed for as little as sixty-seven dollars. “Climate action has to move away from this idea that only completely green people are part of it, the kind of people wearing hemp shirts and walking everywhere,” Heuberger said, in an interview promoting the scheme.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Even after Thunberg denounced offsetting as “a dangerous climate lie,” her movement fuelled the market. JetBlue announced that it would use South Pole credits to help offset the emissions from its US flights. Delta followed with a billion-dollar pledge. Scores of other companies used South Pole offsets toward their net-neutrality claims.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Though South Pole has a portfolio of more than a thousand projects, its partnership with Wentzel proved singularly lucrative—not least because of the credits it had bought directly during the slump, for fifty cents apiece. The sale of these credits provided no additional funding to the project, but the margins for South Pole were huge. Kariba credits would ultimately be worth more than fifteen dollars.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Heuberger liked to say that business was like surfing: you waited for the wave to come, and then you rode it all the way. South Pole launched a major expansion, growing to twelve hundred employees and twenty-nine international offices. To celebrate the opening of its New York branch, it announced that it had made the entire city carbon neutral for one hour. It repeated the trick during the city&#39;s 2019 Climate Week—but this time it claimed that, for the span of one second, it had neutralized the emissions of the entire world.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The carbon market grew sevenfold after the school strike, to two billion dollars a year—but that was still smaller than global sales of nail clippers, or fireworks, or pepper. In September, 2020, a new initiative emerged that promised to radically expand the trade.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The Taskforce on Scaling Voluntary Carbon Markets was a corporate powerhouse, led by Mark Carney, the former head of the Bank of England. It had some four hundred members, including many of the world&#39;s largest suppliers of fossil fuels. Oil companies presented particularly voracious demand; their net-zero pledges required cancelling out several billion tons of carbon a year—far more than the world&#39;s supply of offsets. Carbon credits had typically been sold from a single developer to a single buyer, often with the aid of an intermediary like South Pole. Carney&#39;s vision was to effectively create a stock market for offsets, so that they could be traded with the same speed and ease as any other financial instrument.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;By the logic of the markets, such trading would help facilitate funding to environmental projects. In practice, it often diverted funds to speculators. BP and Shell had opened carbon-trading desks, and the Saudi government did, too. Gilles Dufrasne, of the nonprofit Carbon Market Watch, observed that credits could be traded over and over before being used to offset emissions: “When you buy a carbon credit, what is the chance that somewhere in the value chain it was once owned by Shell, and that some of what you pay represents the cut they took?”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;When the task force held a promotional event at a UN climate summit in Glasgow, Thunberg and other protesters were filmed outside, singing, “You can shove your climate crisis up your arse.” Later, she tweeted an addendum: “I&#39;ve decided to go net-zero on swear words and bad language. In the event that I should say something inappropriate I pledge to compensate that by saying something nice.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Despite the controversy, South Pole was quick to capitalize on the demand. It made deals with Gazprom and Chevron. TotalEnergies announced that it had delivered its first shipment of “carbon neutral liquefied natural gas” using Kariba credits, and the Dutch provider Greenchoice bought millions more to market its gas as “sustainable.” South Pole&#39;s willingness to do business with energy giants rankled its workforce. The staffers were largely young and idealistic, and many felt that the company was helping the world&#39;s worst polluters repair their image. Heuberger defended the choice: “Why wouldn&#39;t those guys who make gazillions of dollars of profits put a portion of that money into funding climate action?”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The head of South Pole&#39;s consultancy division, Rebecca Self, was concerned that the company was awarding “Climate Neutral” badges to clients who seemed to be making little meaningful effort to cut their emissions. But, she told me, when she raised these objections, Heuberger accused her of “sounding like an NGO” and “trying to kill the projects.” (Heuberger maintains that he does not recall saying this, but in our conversations he repeatedly condemned environmental nonprofits, complaining about their “destructive all-out bashing” of the carbon market and even suggesting that such organizations are secretly chaos agents funded by the oil industry.) Not long afterward, Self learned that South Pole had helped the Qatar World Cup substantiate a carbon-neutrality claim that excluded most of the emissions from the construction of seven air-conditioned stadiums. She put her concerns in writing and resigned.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;South Pole&#39;s growth continued unimpeded, and it acquired five smaller rivals. The founders began selling their own shares to wealthy investors, including the government of Singapore, the Liechtenstein royal family, and Salesforce. A deal with Swisscom secured South Pole&#39;s billion-dollar valuation, though Heuberger told me that he came to regret the status it conferred. “As long as we were a startup, we were everybody&#39;s darling,” he said. “People think if you&#39;re a unicorn you must have made a shitload of money and completely ripped everybody off.” Still, he remained afraid of being outpaced by some fast-growing competitor. “We have to defend our market share,” he reasoned. “Doubling is for losers, because everybody else is tripling.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;When Dirk Muench went to work at South Pole, in May, 2021, it felt like a homecoming. In his early days on Wall Street, he had been enthralled by the “prestige and grandeur,” he told me, but he had come to see all that as “smoke and mirrors.” He had left JPMorgan, studied climate science at Columbia, and eventually reached out to his old roommate Patrick Bürgi. “What I really want to do is try to direct large amounts of capital towards climate projects,” Muench said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Hired as the head of corporate investments, he rejoined his college friends at the Technopark, a hulking research complex in Zurich that had housed South Pole&#39;s first office. The company now occupied a much grander space there, but the founders still swam together in the river. “Everything felt really good,” Muench told me.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Gradually, though, he realized that South Pole was far less deeply involved than he had believed in the projects it presented as its own. “They have created this image of being a project developer that protects the climate,” he said. “They are nothing of that sort. They are a broker.” Heuberger was hard to recognize as the radical environmentalist he had admired in college. “I started to see that he&#39;s lost,” Muench told me. “If you&#39;re in a business that&#39;s so lucrative, so good, and you&#39;ve gained your power, your status, and your money from that, you do all you can to protect it.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;When Muench went to Zimbabwe to salvage the Kariba project, he returned even more troubled. Asked to perform due diligence on the investment South Pole planned to make in Wentzel&#39;s company, he pulled the records of payments to Kariba and saw that all the money—some forty million dollars—had been wired to a single account in Guernsey. He told Wentzel that he needed evidence of where the funds from that account had gone. But, after six months of e-mails and phone calls and another meeting in Zimbabwe, Wentzel remained evasive. South Pole had hardly any idea what had happened to tens of millions of dollars its clients had spent supposedly offsetting their carbon emissions.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;xihit5&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;The published project literature outlined what should have happened to that money: Wentzel&#39;s company was to keep thirty per cent, and the rest was to be used to pay district councils, fund project activities, and top up a rainy-day fund. Some of it had clearly been spent on the Kariba site. Along with the farming activities, there were new school huts and clinics, anti-poaching patrols, and fire-suppression measures. But, Muench said, when Wentzel finally sent a spreadsheet of his spending, in the summer of 2022, it accounted for only around six million euros. Even that, he told me, had “no backing, nothing behind it.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;On July 9th, Muench sent an e-mail to Heuberger and other executives, with the subject line “Red Flag.” He reported that, after a long investigation, he could only conclude that most of the funds for the Kariba project had gone astray. In private, he says, he urged Heuberger to admit the problems: “We need to come public before it is in the press.” Heuberger was disinclined to listen to Muench. “He&#39;s very driven—the mind-set is totally on impact,” Heuberger told me. “For him, there&#39;s only good and bad.” South Pole removed Muench from the inquiry into Wentzel&#39;s finances, after which “the relationship and flow of information proved to be more productive again,” the company said. To Heuberger&#39;s mind, the Kariba project was as good as it needed to be: “Is it perfect? Is the guy a hundred per cent? Every dollar always a hundred per cent?” He shrugged. “You have to navigate your way around.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In September, Wentzel flew to London on business, and I met him for breakfast at a bistro on Sloane Square. He wore designer chinos, Chelsea boots, and a crisp white shirt, but when he greeted me I noticed that he was missing a front tooth.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I had spent hours in two previous encounters questioning Wentzel over the project&#39;s finances. At first, he had reeled off contradictory figures, getting out a calculator and punching the keys before giving up and pushing it away. In the end, he admitted that his inability to account for the money was no accident. “There&#39;s no paper trail,” he told me.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Years of political and economic instability had made it too precarious to bank in Zimbabwe, he said, and transferring money to a sanctioned state from Guernsey was a bureaucratic headache: “Do you know how much compliance I had to go through to just have one transaction?” So he had devised an untraceable way of moving the funds. “It was illegal,” he acknowledged, “but it got looked over.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;When he needed money for the project, he said, he would transfer it from Guernsey into the account of an acquaintance who wanted electronic funds, in “Mauritius or the Cayman Islands or the Seychelles or Russia or wherever,” and they would arrange for the equivalent in US dollars to be delivered to him in Zimbabwe. Other times, he would pay an invoice for someone else—for a consignment of motorbikes, perhaps—and that person would deliver him the same amount in cash.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“This looks really bad, because you&#39;re just sending money here, there, and everywhere, but, on the receiving side, I can show where we&#39;ve got it,” he told me. “Well, I can show you the bundles of cash on the floor.” When payments arrived, he said, he would “grab the money and run with it,” distributing it among the stakeholders in the project. “For any kind of European or American, that&#39;s not comprehensible,” he said. “How many Western people have carried half a million dollars of cash in their hand?”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Wentzel&#39;s demeanor seemed to lighten as he unburdened himself, and he began to stage a mock interrogation. “Can I see the &lt;em >;SWIFT&lt;/em>;?” he boomed, referring to the code that banks use for international payments. “The money got there swiftly, but I can&#39;t tell you what the &lt;em >;SWIFT&lt;/em>; was.” Suddenly his waggish smile gave way to a frown. “I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re going to report on this, and I hope to God it&#39;s not all of it, because I probably will go to jail,” he said. Then he reassured himself. “I&#39;ll go to jail for the right reasons,” he said. “Savior or villain? I&#39;m right in the damned middle. And I&#39;m happy to be that way.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The Castello di Modanella is a twelfth-century castle whose battlements rise from the Tuscan hills.

They were reckoning with bad news.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The previous year had marked a decade since Kariba was launched, which meant that South Pole was required by Verra to check its explosive predictions against reality. After months of reviewing satellite imagery, the company&#39;s data analysts had determined that deforestation in the control zone was dramatically lower than projected. They estimated that only fifteen million of the forty-two million carbon credits generated by the project had actually been backed by avoided emissions. All the rest of those supposedly offset tons of carbon simply weren&#39;t real.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Muench and another executive urged Heuberger to stop selling offsets from the Kariba project immediately. “If it comes out that we&#39;ve knowingly sold credits that weren&#39;t equivalent to a ton of CO&lt;sub>;2&lt;/sub>; emissions avoided, it would do huge damage,” Muench said. Heuberger rejected that idea. The credits had been validated by Verra, he argued: “If you want to scale, you have to rely on certain rules and systems.” (South Pole acknowledges that this conversation occurred but says that it took place after the trip to Tuscany.) Back in Zurich, South Pole continued enthusiastically promoting Kariba. In the months after learning of the miscalculation, it sold more than three million environmentally worthless credits, to Porsche, Nestlé, and Nando&#39;s, along with others including the Cannes Film Festival and a network of Australian zoos.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;But scrutiny of the market was increasing. Investigations by the &lt;em>;Guardian&lt;/em>;, Bloomberg, and others had highlighted questionable accounting and community abuses by carbon projects. Greenpeace and other nonprofits had published reports denouncing the trade as a dangerous distraction from genuine efforts to reduce reliance on fossil fuels.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;One Friday evening that November, a forest-ecology expert named Elias Ayrey posted a satellite image of the Kariba area online. “I find myself quite upset,” he wrote. “I just reviewed a #carbon project that&#39;s likely receiving more than 30x as many credits as it should.” Ayrey, who works for an independent ratings agency called Renoster, had used &lt;em >;NASA&lt;/em>; satellite imagery to calculate that deforestation in the Kariba reference region was significantly lower than the company had stated. He signed off with a disclaimer: “All opinions are my own. And my own opinion is that everyone involved with this project should be arrested.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Late that night, Heuberger posted a caustic response: “It looks like you really don&#39;t understand how carbon finance works, and your only goal is to criticize and spread fake news.” His phone soon started buzzing with calls from alarmed clients, and four days later the company finally instructed staff to pause the sale of Kariba credits. By then, South Pole had off-loaded twenty-three million credits from the project—eight million more than it could justify.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;rmcp7a&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;The mood around the Technopark was tense. One day that fall, Muench sat down next to Heuberger in the open-plan office and said that he was still worried about Kariba. “You sold credits that weren&#39;t real,” he said. “They didn&#39;t have an impact on the climate that you expected, and, on top, you guys took a lot of money.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Heuberger was enraged, he told me: “He came and said, &#39;Renat, you enriched yourself. I demand that you come out and rectify all those omissions transparently. Talk to your investors and your clients and hand them back their money.&#39; ”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Muench said that Heuberger screamed at him, “Get out!出去！ You know nothing!” But then he followed his old friend into the street and persuaded him not to leave.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In December, South Pole organized an all-hands meeting to quell the staff&#39;s concerns about Kariba—to “build trust around this truly amazing project,” as one executive said. (A recording of the session was shared with me by Follow the Money, an investigative newsroom in the Netherlands.) Christian Dannecker began his talk with a convoluted disquisition on deforestation curves, counterfactual modelling, and the limitations of &lt;em >;NASA&lt;/em>; satellite data in assessing dryland deforestation. Then he took questions.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;“Are the Kariba credits based on reality?” one staffer asked.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“I give the question back: What is reality?” Dannecker snapped.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;South Pole&#39;s head of US sales tried again: “We have clients coming to us saying, &#39;Hey, the credits that you sold us, that impact that we claimed, did that actually happen?是还是不是？&#39; ”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;A public-affairs executive intervened: “Which is why we&#39;re holding the current verification at the moment—because we want to make sure that that is the case.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“How much profit has South Pole made by selling Kariba credits?” another staffer asked.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“I didn&#39;t do the numbers, to be honest,” Dannecker replied. “I guess we probably made ten million dollars.” There were audible gasps, before another executive warned, “To be clear, we don&#39;t want to repeat that publicly.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Muench watched the meeting in disbelief. “It was Machiavellian,” he said. “I think, at the end of the day, they started to lie to themselves.” He left the company three days later, after filing a report through its whistle-blower channel. He received a brief response a few weeks later. “An investigation has been completed and we conclude that South Pole were following the approved Verra methodology,” it read. “We are therefore going to close this case.” That month, Verra certified another seven million credits for the Kariba project.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In the absence of a government regulator, Verra had become the primary standard-setter of the voluntary carbon trade. The agency controlled about two-thirds of the market, and nearly half its projects were forest-carbon schemes like Kariba. As the global trade ignited, the scenes inside its head office had been chaotic. “One day we were just bumbling along, and then the next day it was drinking from a fire hose,” Andrew Beauchamp, who worked at Verra for eight years, told me. The chief executive, David Antonioli, a rangy man with an elastic grin, said that developers applied increasing pressure to wave their applications through. “They got pretty worked up,” he said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;For years, Verra had delegated the oversight of projects to outside environmental auditors. (The Kariba project had been reviewed five times, which Heuberger often cited as evidence of careful supervision.) But the auditors were hired and paid by project developers, potentially creating an incentive to ignore concerns. When Verra staff ran “sniff tests” on some of the auditors&#39; reports, they found scores of serious errors. “There are a lot of us who believe that this resembles an elaborate fraud,” Danny Cullenward, a climate economist at the University of Pennsylvania, told me. Verra allowed credit sellers to claim that they had undergone a robust certification process, “even though every element of that process, when you dig in, is conducted by financially self-interested parties.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Many observers felt that Verra had an even greater conflict of its own: it charged a fee to certify each credit. “The more credits they issue, the more money they make,” Niklas Kaskeala, a founder of Compensate, a Finnish nonprofit focussed on carbon-market integrity, told me. “It&#39;s structural corruption.” (Verra recently began overseeing auditors more thoroughly, and is working to revise its procedures around forest carbon—but only after verifying more than a billion credits.)&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;This January, the &lt;em>;Guardian&lt;/em>; ran a story that alleged, on the basis of three scientific studies, that more than ninety per cent of the forest credits Verra had certified were “worthless.” Though Antonioli resigned soon afterward, Verra disputed the report, arguing that most forests protected through its programs are still standing, despite commercial pressures to cut them down. Several independent agencies and academic studies have since concurred that most forest-carbon projects in existence are selling offsets based on vastly inflated claims. By those reckonings, several hundred million tons of carbon that were supposedly offset will linger in the atmosphere for centuries.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;As 2023 began, South Pole was struggling to control the damage to its reputation. It had invited clients to visit the Kariba site, and Dannecker had published a blog post presenting the project as a resounding success. Then, in January, a tape of the staff meeting about the project was leaked to Follow the Money. The resulting story ran under the headline “Showcase project by the world&#39;s biggest carbon trader actually resulted in more carbon emissions.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;South Pole responded with a lengthy rebuttal, complaining of “exaggerated and misleading reporting.” Yet its own statements about its profits were tangled. Dannecker had written in his earlier blog post that the company took a twenty-five-per-cent commission on the Kariba-credit sales and sent the remaining forty million euros to Wentzel, for distribution. Now he acknowledged that the company had made far higher margins on the credits it had bought directly, claiming Wentzel had received fifty-seven million euros, from total revenues of more than a hundred million.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Within South Pole, the handling of the Kariba project inspired dismay, and several staffers resigned. The public, too, was increasingly suspicious of the voluntary market. Consumer groups began suing companies for greenwashing, and the European Parliament proposed banning claims of net neutrality based solely on offsetting, after finding that forty per cent of green marketing in the EU was “completely unsubstantiated.” Gucci quietly dropped its carbon-neutral claim. Volkswagen, Barclays, L&#39;Oréal, and McKinsey said that they would stop buying offsets from the Kariba project. As the price of carbon credits tumbled, Heuberger was aghast. “This is now a loose cannon—it&#39;s spinning, spinning, spinning,” he said. “We have to stop the feed.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;A few weeks after the details of the all-hands meeting came out, Muench received an e-mail from South Pole&#39;s lawyers, demanding that he present himself for questioning about the leaked tape. He denied being behind the leak, but the investigation struck him as an opportunity to relay his concerns about Kariba. He agreed to meet the lawyers, and sent them detailed written testimony in advance. The lawyers abruptly cancelled the meeting.&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;a data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a26750&amp;quot;}&quot;

But, when I met Heuberger this summer, he told me that the Kariba controversy had been concocted by his former friend. “It&#39;s very psychological,” he said. “To his frustration, we were more successful than him. And in his mind there was this story created—like, the only reason South Pole is successful is because it&#39;s a weird company. It&#39;s a little bit fishy. We are cheating.” (I first spoke with Muench after Heuberger mentioned the concerns that he&#39;d raised, but he declined to speak publicly. He eventually agreed to do so only after Heuberger continued criticizing him.)&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;South Pole insists that all the Kariba credits it sold will ultimately be backed by a real emissions reduction: Verra&#39;s methodology allows it to pay back the over-issuance with offsets generated in the future. But several experts, including sources at Verra, told me that this may be impossible, since the drop in deforestation in the reference region will severely limit the project&#39;s eligibility for new credits.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Justin Adams, the former BP executive who had sat on South Pole&#39;s board, told me after first hearing about the controversy that he believed the company was being unfairly maligned. “Have they got all the calls on Kariba right? No. But have they been a net positive force in a world that&#39;s full of darkness right now? Of course they bloody have,” he said. Yet as he learned more he began to lose sympathy. “As a billion Euro company (a fabled unicorn) SP should have had far greater control and audit mechanisms,” he wrote to me. “Certainly they took a lot of risk early on but the rewards in later years look out of whack. More commensurate with an oil and gas concession than an environmental and community development project.”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;q1s86&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;People in the area suggest that the project&#39;s impact has been minimal. Iain Foulds, a white Zimbabwean farmer who has become an outspoken critic of Kariba, told me, “It&#39;s nothing to do with the environment or safeguarding our flora and fauna. This was about money. Yes, there&#39;s a bit of petty cash filtering in here and there for their little projects. But the big bucks—where&#39;s all that going?” Nevertheless, community leaders are wary of losing whatever benefit they receive. In June, I spoke with Elmon Mudenda, who joined a video call from a dimly lit room, with cracked plaster and peeling paint. His great fear was that the project would be deserted. “At the end of the day, who suffers is the community. Nobody else,” he told me.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;The next month, Follow the Money published another story. Reporters had visited the project site, and disaffected locals had shown them a series of abandoned vegetable gardens. The lead author, Ties Gijzel, told me he and his reporting partners had also heard that Wentzel was involved in trophy hunting.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Big-game hunting is legal in Zimbabwe, but South Pole has portrayed the Kariba project as a haven for wildlife, protecting “numerous endangered species such as the African elephant, the lion, the hippopotamus.” When I questioned Wentzel, he acknowledged that trophy hunting occurs across the project area. He had taken control of the sport himself in one region, granting rights to an operator named Dalton &amp;amp; York, whose Instagram page has dozens of images of hunters displaying dead lions, elephants, and crocodiles. In one, a grinning man holds up the carcass of a leopard as blood drips down his forearms. A video shows hippos being shot through the head as they wallow in the Zambezi.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Over the summer, the Zimbabwean government announced plans to centralize control of carbon-trading projects within its borders, and to seize thirty per cent of future profits. Wentzel told me that he didn&#39;t much care what happened to Kariba. “It&#39;s no skin off my nose,” he said. He was already planning a new venture, which he described as “Kariba on steroids.” In his scheme, local women might be employed to stitch car mats for Porsche or to sew beads onto Gucci accessories—though he confessed that neither brand had agreed to the endeavor. He was “struggling to think of something for Nespresso,” he said, but he had been working on a deal to sell driftwood lampshades to an American furniture catalogue. He has already registered the new business in Ireland, under the name Fair Share.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Sylvera, the most prominent of a small group of ratings agencies that are seeking to improve transparency in the carbon market, occupies a plant-filled office in an unassuming building in London. When I visited this June, I was met by the chief executive, Allister Furey, a round-cheeked man in sneakers and a vaguely psychedelic T-shirt.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Furey, a neurobiologist with a Ph.D. in machine learning, worked for a decade in renewable energy before becoming fixated on carbon removal. In order to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees, the UN has said, humanity will need to find a way to suck around ten gigatons of carbon a year out of the atmosphere. “The scale of the challenge is so extreme,” Furey told me. “You need to move trillions and trillions of dollars.” Carbon offsetting seemed like a viable source of that kind of funding, so Sylvera was founded in 2020 to stimulate investment by sorting out the good credits from the junk. Since then, using spaceborne radar and satellite imagery, it has estimated that some eighty per cent of the forest-carbon projects it rated were likely over-crediting. “People get paid more for issuing a higher number of credits without going to prison, so there&#39;s a very strong incentive,” Furey said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Recently, two new initiatives have arisen to encourage higher standards. The Voluntary Carbon Markets Integrity Initiative, launched with backing from the British government, set guidelines to deter corporations from making vacuous claims about the benefits of offsetting. The Integrity Council for the Voluntary Carbon Market, a successor of Mark Carney&#39;s task force, announced a set of “Core Carbon Principles” to assess the quality of existing schemes. “If you build integrity, scale will follow,” Annette Nazareth, the council&#39;s chair, told me. But an analysis by the carbon-data firm Trove Research found that ninety-five per cent of projects on the market would fail to meet these new standards.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Yet offsetting remains central to global plans to reach net zero. The Paris Agreement, signed in 2016, envisaged a new carbon-trading framework—though the details are still being debated seven years later. More than two-thirds of participating countries plan to use offsets to meet their goals, and an alliance of governments and industry figures is lobbying for forest-based projects to be included in the new system.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Experts told me they feared that the same registries they blamed for catastrophic mismanagement of the voluntary market would, by virtue of sheer convenience, end up taking a central role in the UN process. Axel Michaelowa, a researcher at the University of Zurich who co-authored several UN climate reports, said Verra had been telling officials that, if they used its verification services, “you&#39;ll have a one-stop shop—you don&#39;t have to pay a single cent.” That, he said, “would of course mean that all the shortcomings of these private programs would contaminate the compliance market.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;This November, when world leaders gather in Dubai for the UN&#39;s annual climate summit, they will seek agreement on the principles of the new system. To lead the summit, the host country, one of the world&#39;s largest exporters of fossil fuels, has appointed the head of the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;One afternoon this July, I met Heuberger at the Technopark. The sky over the city was cobalt blue, and the air felt strikingly clean. We strolled along the Limmat, passing city workers shedding their suits to dive into the water, then turned up a set of dilapidated steps to his house—an unobtrusive cream-colored structure, set into the hillside above the river. When I remarked on its modesty, he nodded. “It was not cheap, but it&#39;s way far away from the villas you can see,” he said, gesturing at the mansions up the hill. Heuberger also has a pied-à-terre near Davos, but he insisted that the allure of business had never really been about money. He saw building his company as a kind of game: “All of us are driven, of course, by winning.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;For the moment, Heuberger was winning his latest fight—what he called the “shitstorm” in the carbon market. He blamed a handful of enemies: Muench, environmental campaigners, oil companies funding secret plots to destroy those seeking to put a price on carbon. As he enumerated these annoyances, he batted his hands in the air, as if swatting gnats. “We are stubborn, whack-a-mole people,” he said. “You can slap us as many times as you want. We always come up.” In recent weeks, Heuberger had been working to “change the narrative.” He had revealed plans to collaborate on carbon-removal projects with Mitsubishi, and had travelled to London for Climate Week, where he joined a panel on preventing misinformation around offsetting. Though his company had spent years awarding its clients badges that proclaimed them “Carbon Neutral,” Heuberger dismissed this designation onstage as “an easy catchphrase.” The times demanded a new approach, he said: “We have to become robust and honest.” To that end, South Pole was launching a new insignia. Its penguin logo would now be encircled with the words “This Company Funds Climate Action.” The announcement was met with cautious applause.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;At his house, Heuberger led me through a garden overgrown with lavender and brambles, and into a sparsely furnished living room, where a baby&#39;s play mat was the only splash of color. He has four daughters with his wife, Zani, whom he met in Indonesia while scouting projects for South Pole. Their youngest was born last year. When he talked to his daughters about climate change, he said, he focussed exclusively on messages of empowerment and optimism: “There&#39;s no climate anxiety at all in our house.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;On a deck with sweeping views of the city, Zani was grilling sausages, halloumi, and tempeh kebabs. After dinner, Heuberger sat sipping wine with his feet tucked under him, and grew a little maudlin as he gazed out over the dimming skyline. “We were eating dry bread for many years, happy that we just survived,” he said. “I&#39;m sounding like an old guy now. But I look at those young kids who come with their blockchain-enabled super-transparent solution, and say everything has been shit, what we did. OK Calculate Kariba credits.祝你好运。 It&#39;s not that easy.” In my earlier conversations with Heuberger, he had parried every perceived slight or criticism, but as we kept talking those defenses seemed to slip. He confessed that it had been hard to maintain his positivity. “When you think you have done the right thing, something goes wrong, and somebody says you had bad intentions—that&#39;s the most harmful,” he said. “You have to build a thick wall between you and your true feelings, which are of course depressing.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;He told me he was spending a lot of time cycling these days, on the same battered Titan road bike he had bought with saved-up pocket money as a boy. “I had my beliefs and my convictions and my bicycle,” he recalled fondly. “I was in my own world.” To lift his spirits, he had also taken up the cello again—another childhood pursuit—and started singing lessons. “Except for me, everyone else is a little kid at the class,” he said. In a few weeks, he was due to appear in an amateur opera, a production of “Hansel and Gretel.” Heuberger had been cast as the children&#39;s father—“the bad guy, the weird guy”—who returns triumphantly from a profitable day at the market to find that his children have been abandoned alone in the forest. “He doesn&#39;t really understand,” Heuberger said. “He thinks he&#39;s doing a good thing. But he doesn&#39;t get it at all.” ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 16 Oct 2023 19:06:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“Signs, Music,” by Raymond Antrobus]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/10/23/signs-music-raymond-antrobus-poem]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-16T10:00:00.000Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5d484cee472c990009e99534/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/hp-poetryspots5.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;article >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attribute-verso-pattern=&quot;article-body&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;ArticlePageChunks&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;figure data-testid=&quot;IframeEmbed&quot; >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;IframeEmbedContainer&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;iframe height=&quot;60&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; sandbox=&quot;allow-scripts allow-same-origin&quot; title=&quot;Embedded Frame&quot; data-src=&quot;https://www.wnyc.org/widgets/ondemand_player/thenewyorker/#file=https://downloads.newyorker.com/mp3/231023_antrobus_audio.mp3&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay *;加密媒体*；剪贴板写入；自动播放;全屏; picture-in-picture&quot;>;&lt;/iframe>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;p>;Read by the author.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;p >; &lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The first word my son signed&lt;br/>;was &lt;em>;music&lt;/em>;: both hands, fingers conducting&lt;br/>;&lt;em>;music&lt;/em>; for everything—even hunger,&lt;br/>;open mouth for the choo-chew spoon&lt;br/>;squealing mmm—&lt;em>;music&lt;/em>;.
