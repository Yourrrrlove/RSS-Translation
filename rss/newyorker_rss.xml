&lt;a href=&quot;https ://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-front-row/pinball-reviewed-a-remedy-for-your-post-oscar-hangover&quot;>;令人印象深刻&lt;/a>; &lt;a href=&quot;https:// www.newyorker.com/culture/the-front-row/a-thousand-and-one-reviewed-family-dreams-meet-american-realities&quot;>;首次亮相&lt;/a>;，作家兼导演雷文的第一部故事片杰克逊的《所有土路的盐味》将于周五上映，是迄今为止最好的一部。这是一部经过全面想象和实现的电影，它的每一个元素都充满了原创性、灵感和美感。电影的每个方面都预示着真正的电影感：故事和对话；选角和表演；对衣服、家具和地点的眼睛；图像的构图、对光线的关注以及大胆的剪辑；声音设计和乐谱跟踪动作的精确度。其结果是一部感觉就像一个活生生的世界的电影，或者更确切地说，是两个世界，杰克逊的内在世界和共同经历的外在世界。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“所有土路的盐味”是一部多代人的传奇故事故事跨越半个世纪，讲述了主角麦肯齐（绰号麦克）的生活，麦肯齐是一位黑人女性，在十九世纪六七十年代在密西西比州的乡村长大。 （她由四位不同的女演员在不同的年龄扮演。）然而，这部电影最独特和最有力的成就是在时间领域。如果杰克逊备用剧本中的事件以传统的节奏和传统的舞台拍摄，那么这部电影将是一部较长的短片，可能有三十或四十分钟。如果她拍摄了这个影响广泛的故事中暗示或暗示的全部事件，那么这部电影将持续四个小时或成为一部迷你剧。事实上，杰克逊拍摄的电影尽管时长九十七分钟，但展现了大胆的电影时间概念。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;麦克与父亲以赛亚（克里斯）在一个充满爱的家庭中长大。查克）、母亲伊芙琳（希拉·阿蒂姆饰）和妹妹乔西（贾亚·亨利饰）。小时候（由凯莉·妮可·约翰逊饰演），麦克骑着自行车，与她的朋友们在树林、空地和游泳池里进行认真有趣的冒险。十几岁的时候，她与另一个名叫伍德（当时由普雷斯顿·麦克道威尔饰演）的青少年展开了一段轻浮的恋情。但麦克的母亲去世了，以赛亚将孩子们送去与祖母贝蒂（詹妮·汉普顿饰）住在一起，将麦克从伍德身边撬开。在她的一生中，这种分离给她带来了沉重的压力，即使她在新环境中尽可能充实地生活，最终工作、进步、结婚、生子。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;麦克的故事生活不是按时间顺序讲述的，而是以时间马赛克的形式讲述的。这部电影的时间框架交织在一起，在几年和几十年之间来回跳跃。这种技巧并不是一种主要现在时的闪回。相反，有一种感觉，在记忆中，甚至在一个家庭、一个地区和一个社区的集体生活中，过去、现在和未来通过教义和遗产、预言和预感结合在一起。麦克和乔西与祖母在一起的场景通过与精神领域的联系而具有超越时间之箭的特殊气氛。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;这个动作展示了看似文学的概念与暗示纪录片的特殊观察的罕见融合。 。杰克逊与电影摄影师乔莫·弗雷 (Jomo Fray) 合作，将手势和戏剧结合起来，创造出大胆而细致的片段，而在大多数电影中，这些片段只会在一两个平淡的说明性镜头中出现。伊芙琳的葬礼结束后，离开家乡的旅程与女孩们的双手密不可分，小卡车放在以赛亚驾驶的皮卡车的蓝色凹槽底板上。但这幅图像嵌入了一幅精致的、交响乐般的体验拼贴画中，从他们身后道路上的树叶景色，到透过出租车后窗看到的以赛亚驾驶的景象，再到女孩们的发型和衣服。这个蒙太奇，就像整部电影中的许多蒙太奇一样，在一段非常持续的时间跨度上发展出一个令人心碎的时刻；这些结构通过美学的方式唤起了记忆本身的力量。电影以年轻的麦克从她父亲那里接受海滨钓鱼课程开始，这也涉及一系列视觉效果：鱼的处理、卷轴和鱼线的操作、篮子的使用以及鱼线的使用。接下来的一课是伊芙琳在家庭厨房里清洁和准备烹饪时的捕获物——一种闪闪发光的感官狂喜，其中手的姿势、身体的姿势、语气和深刻的情绪给小事件注入了一种史诗般宏伟的光环。&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;在明显具有重大戏剧意义的时刻，杰克逊的灵感会适时出现，就像在麦克的婚礼场景中一样，在演唱一首精神歌曲时在这幅画中，教区居民并没有一起唱歌，而是以肖像画的形式，一个接一个地以极其特写的方式呈现，以一种将共同的虔诚热情与私人沉思的宁静结合在一起的模式。杰克逊和弗雷以一种安静而勇敢的镜头动作结束了这一场景，他们从这对夫妇身边走过，从一扇窗往外看，然后又看看另一扇窗外，仿佛将教堂内的事件与社区的生活，与整个世界联系起来。&lt;/ p>;&lt;p>;同样，电影的对话虽少，但也不乏；杰克逊的台词具有宝石般的力量和密度，而她的演员则以一种传达其中蕴含的体验的方式来表达它们。 “我看着我的爸爸在差点杀了我之后向我走来，但我想我看到了我需要看到的东西，”伍德谈到他父亲艰苦的游泳课时说道。麦克对水的描述包含了一种经久不衰的形而上学：“它不会结束或开始，它只是改变形式，”她说。 “有一天，所有这些水滴可能会成为一条河流，可能会成为雪，也可能会在你身上。”言语、人物的动作或目光都没有不自然地放慢；他们只是被给予适当的空间和重量。强调和停顿、犹豫和温柔似乎反映了深思熟虑的生活节奏。一次又一次，许多电影只是传达信息，而杰克逊的电影则传达质感。当麦克和伍德成年后再次相遇的场景（由查琳·麦克卢尔和小雷金纳德·赫尔姆斯饰演）时，杰克逊将完全熟悉的情感动作从陈词滥调的领域中拉出来，让他们感到惊讶和惊奇。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;对于大多数电影来说，避免剧透是一种礼貌；对于“所有土路的盐味”来说，这几乎是道德和审美上的必然。我只想说，基本情节涉及一系列事件，我发现这些事件在多维度上令人惊叹——从构思它的电影制片人和生活在其中的角色的角度来想象是非常了不起的。这部电影我已经看了三遍，虽然只有一次让我感到惊讶，但每次我都屏住呼吸。这在很大程度上与一个巨大的六分钟序列有关——它的方式平静而内敛，而其紧张而安静的表达方式却充满爆炸性——这是近年来伟大的电影选集之一。我经常&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/dvd-of-the-week-all-that-heaven-allows&quot;>;讨论&lt;/a>; &lt;a href =&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-front-row/the-primal-power-of-the-sleepy-time-gal&quot;>;情节剧&lt;/a>;作为一种重要的电影形式，因为它赋予平凡生活以悲剧的力量。 《土路都是盐的味道》是近年来最优秀的情节剧之一，不仅因为它以如此深情的关怀看待平凡的生活，而且因为它的悲剧感是如此崇高和崇高。 ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot;

的德国人相信拜登会在国际事务中做正确的事，而只有 10% 的德国人认为特朗普会在总统任期的最后一年这样做。 （与此同时，拜登目前的&lt;a href=&quot;https://projects. Fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval- rating/&quot;>;国内支持率&lt;/a>;平均为百分之五十四而只有百分之三十九半的支持率——接近他在 2022 年夏天达到的最低点。）这不仅仅是左翼欧洲人对粗鲁的右翼美国政客嗤之以鼻的问题。拜登更喜欢与盟友合作，而不是特朗普抨击他们；他对乌克兰的大力支持与特朗普对乌克兰领导人的勒索形成鲜明对比；以及他在北约面临冷战结束以来欧洲安全最大威胁之际对北约数十年的支持，这些都是真实的、具体的差异。相比之下，特朗普威胁要完全退出&lt;em>;北约&lt;/em>;——他的前国家安全顾问约翰博尔顿&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/us-news /2023/aug/04/john-bolton-trump-nato-2024#:~:text=2%20months%20old-,John%20Bolton%20suggests%20US%20will%20leave%20Nato,不稳定%27%20Trump%20wins %20in%202024&amp;amp;text=Ex%2Dnational%20security%20adviser%20John,Donald%20Trump%20wins%20the%20election.&quot;>;表示如果获得第二个任期，他很可能会这样做&lt;/a>;——而且只是另一个天 &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://twitter.com/BidenHQ/status/1718734283815211350&quot;

aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;也许是最紧迫的恐惧人们在欧洲听到有关援助乌克兰的消息。无论多么难以想象，考虑到西方对基辅防御做出的巨大承诺，华盛顿的国会功能失调可能意味着美国的援助在乌克兰当前的反攻结束之前就枯竭了。民意调查显示，美国各政治派别对继续支持乌克兰的热情正在减弱，尤其是但不仅限于共和党人； &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.axios.com/2023/11/02/poll-americans-support-ukraine-republicans&quot;>;在最近的一项盖洛普民意调查&lt;/a>;中，62% 的共和党人和44% 的独立人士表示，美国为帮助乌克兰做得太多，这一比例自 6 月以来增加了 10 个百分点。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;从战争一开始，拜登就与总理在乌克兰问题上携手合作奥拉夫·肖尔茨.德国，作为其所谓的“Zeitenwende”的一部分，这是自俄罗斯入侵以来其外交政策的一个痛苦且尚未完全完成的转向，德国现在承诺将其 GDP 的 2% 以上用于国防——特朗普大声要求但从未实现的增长。它还&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/news/business-64312400&quot;>;打破了对俄罗斯能源的依赖&lt;/a>;，这是与战前相比的根本转变，当时德国进口了大约一半的能源其天然气和超过三分之一的石油来自俄罗斯，并计划开通现已取消的北溪 2 号天然气管道。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;但其军事援助水平只是华盛顿所提供的巨额援助的一小部分。已用于供应基辅。目前，美国的援助在战场上是不可替代的。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;然而，在柏林和西方其他地方，更深刻的担忧远远超出了发送远程导弹的花费。乌克兰或帮助以色列消灭哈马斯。这是关于美国重新选举一位不遵守西方联盟基本原则或美国宪法基本原则的总统的真正可能性。在“&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Divider-Trump-White-House-2017-2021/dp/038554653X”data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;中： “ExternalLink”、“outgoingURL”：“https://www.amazon.com/Divider-Trump-White-House-2017-2021/dp/038554653X”}&quot;

>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Fiction Studios, a recording venue in Farringdon, central London, is a study in scrupulous unkemptness. At first glance, it looks like the kind of secondhand bookshop you don&#39;t see anymore—shelves overflowing with old hardcovers, antique lamps, red velvet drapes, clubby leather-upholstered sofas, and a big gilt-framed oil painting leaning up against the bookcases. Only then does one notice a thirty-six-track mixing console and an assortment of amps, synthesizers, and pianos. One evening in August, a group of fans, journalists, and music-industry types squeezed into the space for a “listening party” celebrating the release of “Well Well,” an EP by the twenty-five-year-old singer-songwriter Victoria Canal. “I&#39;ve never been here before,” Canal told the crowd, but the place could hardly have reflected her artistic project better: warm and welcoming, but notably organized, too.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Canal wears an almost constant smile, her strong cheekbones lifting her whole face upward, and she often hunches her shoulders in a gawky pantomime of self-deprecation. A recent “One to Watch” column in the &lt;em>;Observer&lt;/em>; described her presence as “lovable” and said, “It feels like she was born on stage.” Although her songs address issues such as depression, grief, body dysmorphia, and queerness, her manner has a way of softening heavy topics, and an endearing form of goofball, Internet-addled humor has become the bedrock of Canal&#39;s brand. “I don&#39;t know if any of you have had mental-health issues,” Canal said at one point, shooting a knowing look to the audience. Previously, on TikTok, she had described her fan base with a quote from the drag queen Trixie Mattel: “I&#39;m big with teens, girls, lesbians, the mentally ill, the very sad.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Canal introduced each of the six tracks on “Well Well” with long, chatty anecdotes about their composition and the inspirations behind them. “Braver” is addressed to her mother, who grew up in Alabama and Georgia but emigrated to Spain. “You&#39;re braver than I&#39;ve ever been,” the chorus runs, and Canal spoke about how her mother not only moved to a country whose language she couldn&#39;t speak but also broke off an engagement in order to marry one of the first men she met in Spain—the man who would later become Canal&#39;s father. (Canal is based in London but describes herself as Spanish American.) Introducing “Yes Man,” Canal mentioned that she wrote the song while on a writing retreat in Spain with Chris Martin, the lead singer of Coldplay. Martin first made contact with Canal in 2021 and has since become a significant mentor and a booster of her career. At the retreat, he set her the task of writing a song on his Veillette Gryphon guitar in the time it took for him to do his daily laps of the pool. (Also on the retreat was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/01/25/how-jacob-collier-found-a-key-that-doesnt-exist&quot;>;Jacob Collier&lt;/a>;, who can be heard playing the Veillette on the resulting track.)&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“She Walks In” brought back memories of digging a car out of the snow in the depths of a Wisconsin winter. This was at the converted barn that one of the song&#39;s producers, Brian Fredrick Joseph, uses as a studio. (The other producer at the barn was S. Carey, best known as the drummer from Bon Iver.) This song is one of two tracks on the EP that address body image and body dysmorphia. “She walks in,” the song begins, and then goes on:&lt;/p>;&lt;blockquote >;&lt;div >;&lt;p>;Everyone&#39;s staring&lt;br/>;&#39;Cause she&#39;s truly magnificent.&lt;br/>;Sometimes I wish someone would stare at me.&lt;br/>;But for that reason&lt;br/>;Sometimes I get fooled for a second,&lt;br/>;But they&#39;re staring &#39;cause my body&#39;s different.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/blockquote>;&lt;p >;Canal has grown up with an acute awareness of the different ways one can be stared at. Clearly beautiful, she has the kind of open, dramatic face that seems made for album covers; she was also born without a right forearm and hand, thanks to a condition called amniotic band syndrome. As far as music goes, her disability—she uses the term “disability” and “limb difference” more or less interchangeably—is essentially a non-issue: her short right arm is perfect for picking out melodic lines on the piano over rippling left-hand accompaniments and for strumming a variety of patterns on guitar. What&#39;s more complicated is being stared at—or, in career terms, every aspect of how the music industry and the media perceive her. Her disability has brought opportunities—a partnership with Nike on a sneaker for people with disabilities, say—but also humiliations. (After she sang a duet with Martin, several news headlines referred to “a one-handed pianist” without mentioning her name.) She faces a challenge familiar to performers whose trajectories are bound up with issues of representation and visibility: how to do justice to a difference that is a big part of her experience of the world without letting this difference define her. The opening two songs on “Well Well” mark her first attempt to address this directly.&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Canal is at the end of the beginning of her career. For ten years, since her mid-teens, she has been performing whenever and wherever she can, gradually ascending the shaky stairway of a pop career: putting out songs online; touring with Hozier, Lawrence, and JP Saxe; opening for Leslie Odom, Jr., and Teddy Swims. Now she seems to be on the brink of something bigger. Earlier this year, at the Ivor Novello Awards, she won the &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://ivorsacademy.com/awards/the-ivors/rising-star/&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://ivorsacademy.com/awards/the-ivors/rising-star/&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://ivorsacademy.com/awards/the-ivors/rising-star/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;Rising Star Award&lt;/a>;, and last year she made her acting début, in Apple TV+&#39;s series “Little America.” A turning point came two years ago, when Chris Martin heard her songs online and got in touch, offering support. Canal signed with Parlophone Records after he introduced her to the label, and is now at work on her first full album, for release next year. This fall, after her EP release, she embarked on her first headline tour of the UK and Europe. (Last month, she sang across the United States, supporting Sammy Rae &amp;amp; the Friends.) “She has the gift of song,” Martin told me recently. “I don&#39;t know where that comes from, or how you&#39;d even define it, but songs come through her like they do for some people.” To him, her music sounded like nobody else&#39;s. “Then, on top of that, she&#39;s so emotionally open.”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;um49jg&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;zcsr6g&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Near the end of the listening party, Canal crossed over to an electric piano and sang “Braver,” the song to her mother. When she sings in such an intimate setting, the giggly side of Canal&#39;s persona retreats, leaving behind something more inward. She often seems to be singing to herself. Canal finished with a number from a previous EP, “swan song,” which Martin, in a video posted to social media, spontaneously exclaimed was “one of the best songs ever written.” The song epitomizes much of Canal&#39;s style: widely spaced left-hand arpeggios, her right hand playing a few important anchoring notes, and melodies that gently meander in a contralto register. In this intimate venue, her voice was soft but secure, and seemed poised to crack at any moment.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The first date on Canal&#39;s UK tour was at the Lower Third, an industrial-chic venue on Denmark Street—a street that was once London&#39;s version of Tin Pan Alley and still has a residual, slightly beleaguered music-industry presence. Things had been going wrong that day—a lost amp, a nervy sound check—but Canal relaxed onstage, feeding off the supportive energy in a room with ripples of happily awkward laughter. (She encouraged audience members to hug total strangers.) During her song “own me,” a helpless cry to God at the prospect of grief, something shifted. Canal&#39;s default sound is a whispery head voice, but, during the song&#39;s second chorus, she let rip, with loud, wide, pain-filled wails. It was as if the song touched something unexpected inside her that she then spent the rest of the performance coming to terms with. Around the most brutal lines of “She Walks In” — “I&#39;m ugly and nothing will fix it / I&#39;ll never be pretty to you”—Canal choked up, seemed unable to sing at moments. “What you saw at the gig is what will happen in the room,” the songwriter Eg White later told me, about his experience recording with Canal. White, who has also worked with Adele, Duffy, and Kylie Minogue, said that what set Canal apart was “a shocking frankness and an acknowledgment of the things that you really have to hide in daily life.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;The sense of vulnerability as the song ended was palpable. Then a fan presented Canal with a golden crown, and she put it on assuming a “gun show” pose, proudly presenting her shorter arm. Then she sat back on her piano stool, which promptly collapsed, leaving her in a heap on the floor. “It was chaos,” she told me later. But Canal had built her audience up into a kind of parachute, and they duly caught her, and Canal and the crowd giggled the way to the end of the set, all boundaries erased.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;“I&#39;ve always had an unusual conviction for just going for it,” Canal told me when I met up with her just before the second date on her tour, in Manchester. That conviction can manifest itself in quick gut decisions—getting a tattoo when an audience member at a New York gig offers to do it for free—but increasingly her conviction is more sustained, more carefully focussed on doing whatever it takes to make her career happen. Tony Berg, who has produced records by Phoebe Bridgers and boygenius, told me that Canal “is open for the discussion, and receptive to new ideas, but, when she feels something is inappropriate for her, or she feels strongly that what she&#39;s doing is already exactly what she wants, she lets you know.” He felt that this independence is serving her well: “She is not one of what is now an onslaught of Phoebe imitators.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Canal attributes her determination to her father, a businessman whose work has mostly been in the marketing of medical devices. She also thinks it comes from her paternal grandmother, who grew up in Cuba but fled to Spain. She would reprimand Canal if she felt her granddaughter wasn&#39;t putting her whole heart into even the simplest scale when practicing piano. (In memory of this, Canal has the phrase &lt;em>;con alma&lt;/em>;—Spanish for “with soul”—tattooed behind her ear.) Canal&#39;s family followed her father&#39;s work around the world; by the time that she was fourteen, she had lived in Germany, Spain, China, Japan, and the UAE At that point, when another move loomed—from Dubai to Barcelona—Canal asked her parents if she could move her education online. This was partly because she felt excluded at school and partly because she wanted to carve out time for her practice, given her belief that a career in music was inevitable. She would attend online school in the mornings, and spend afternoons at a conservatory in Barcelona, where she ended up studying with musicians often ten years her senior. “They were adults, so they were actually nice, and inclusive, and mature enough to look past their own insecurities,” she said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Just before she started online school, Canal had a music teacher in Dubai who gave her the lowdown on the business side of being a singer. Canal fell in love with what she called “the project of making progress,” seeing things like gaining followers on Facebook or gaining YouTube views “like a Sudoku puzzle.” She said she&#39;d sent hundreds of cold e-mails to prospective artists and producers. “Every tour I&#39;ve gotten pretty much has been through DM&#39;ing the artist on Instagram,” she said. “I&#39;m a victim of hustle culture in that I&#39;ve only thought about my career my whole life,” she said, before stopping to rephrase. “I&#39;m not sure &#39;victim&#39; is the right word, but definitely, like, a partaker.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Canal&#39;s current life is a bifurcated one: sometimes she is an international jet-setter casually hanging out with musical colossi such as Collier, Hozier, or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/06/05/who-is-matty-healy&quot;>;Matty Healy&lt;/a>; from the 1975, but most of the time she is a breakthrough artist trying desperately to make touring sustainable. Canal&#39;s career is like a music version of “dress for the job you want,” and her schedule is hectic. As well as touring, there is international travel to work with specific producers in specific studios, a fierce workout schedule—she&#39;s currently trying to master the one-armed pullup—and, in her downtime, long stretches of time marked out where she&#39;s not allowed to use her phone. Her immediate aims, meanwhile, are quotidian: she wants a bigger band, a lighting engineer, a person to run front-of-house, and a tour bus.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Canal is extremely open about all of this, and she regularly shares her biggest vulnerabilities on social media. A week after the London gig, she posted a behind-the-scenes mini-documentary on Instagram. A scene shows Canal at her home in North London, picking out clothes for the show, that evening. “Why do I feel so bloated?” she asks. “Depending on the day, I feel so differently about my body.” Canal emerges from her bedroom in a different outfit from the one that she had originally planned, her smile noticeably wan. On Canal&#39;s Instagram, there&#39;s an emotional reaction video of her listening back to her first song about disability, “She Walks In,” and another video in which her body is painted with a lyric from “Shape” (“Don&#39;t be so pretty in front of me”) while she rides the London Underground.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Part of her expressiveness is a rebellious gesture; her mom monitored her social media until she was of age, and would occasionally ask her to take a post down. But something about her public persona is also discomfiting, a reflection of an industry&#39;s glorification of authenticity, which has created an environment where artists like Canal—and other young women, mostly—feel compelled to put their deepest insecurities on show for all to see. There&#39;s no doubt that Canal&#39;s ascendant career is built on her ability to unflinchingly capture feelings, many of which are drawn from her own experience, but it also shows how hazy the boundaries can be for artists between reclaiming a narrative and allowing trauma to become part of a brand. “Nobody&#39;s been telling me to do anything that I don&#39;t want to do,” she said to me at one point, but she&#39;s well aware that the industry is keen to exploit the fact that “people like depression in music.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;After the Manchester performance, as with the London one, she emerged from her greenroom to meet the audience, most of whom had stuck around for a chat. Her directness about body image and mental health has brought her an audience of people a lot like her. “It&#39;s just young queer women who are sweet and gentle and kind to each other and lonely and sensitive,” she told me. There were hugs, selfies, and intense conversations between natural oversharers. Some of these interactions were filmed for Instagram, but most of the conversations drifted along happily until, after about twenty minutes, Canal seemed to have dissolved into the room and become indistinguishable from her audience, just as she&#39;d planned, and hoped. ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;2g7hno&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot;

By any measure, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/what-britney-spearss-memoir-has-to-say&quot;>;Britney Spears&#39;s life&lt;/a>;, as detailed in her new book, “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Woman-Me-Britney-Spears/dp/1668009048&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Woman-Me-Britney-Spears/dp/1668009048&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Woman-Me-Britney-Spears/dp/1668009048&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;The Woman in Me&lt;/a>;,” is rich material. The pop star rose to fame in the early two-thousands, and, after enduring a series of mental-health crises, was placed in a conservatorship through which her father controlled almost every aspect of her day-to-day existence. On this episode of Critics at Large, the staff writers Vinson Cunningham, Naomi Fry, and Alexandra Schwartz discuss the “horror story” that emerges in the memoir as the teen-aged Spears is betrayed by everyone around her: a family intent on profiting off her talent; a young Justin Timberlake, who used his romance with Spears as a stepping stone for his own career; a ravenous media that both sexualized and shamed her. The hosts consider how “The Woman in Me” fits within the broader canon of celebrity memoirs, citing the producer Julia Phillips&#39;s “burn-it-all-down” best-seller, “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Youll-Never-Lunch-This-Again/dp/0399590900&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Youll-Never-Lunch-This-Again/dp/0399590900&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Youll-Never-Lunch-This-Again/dp/0399590900&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;You&#39;ll Never Eat Lunch in This Town Again&lt;/a>;,” and the late Matthew Perry&#39;s 2022 meditation on his struggles with addiction, “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Friends-Lovers-Big-Terrible-Thing/dp/1250866448&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Friends-Lovers-Big-Terrible-Thing/dp/1250866448&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Friends-Lovers-Big-Terrible-Thing/dp/1250866448&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;Friends, Lovers, and the Big Terrible Thing&lt;/a>;.” Ultimately, these stories are just one facet of a broader narrative—and a kind of performance in their own right. “Once you submit to being a celebrity, your music, and how you appear in magazines, and what you produce as a memoir all contribute to this one big text,” Cunningham says. “It&#39;s this grand synthesis, and, in the end, the text is Britney herself.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;New episodes drop every Thursday.

He was just four years out of college, and this would be one of his biggest jobs yet: political director for the reëlection campaign of Ro Khanna, a Democratic representative from Silicon Valley. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-political-scene/ro-khannas-progressive-case-for-saving-silicon-valley-bank&quot;>;Khanna&lt;/a>;, a well-known and popular incumbent with plenty of money in the bank, is in no real danger of losing his election next year; many representatives in his position might not have been hiring campaign staff at all. But Khanna is also ambitious—it&#39;s frequently speculated that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/ro-khanna-not-running/&quot;>;he may run for President&lt;/a>; one day, staking out a pragmatic-populist lane slightly to the right of Bernie Sanders and to the left of Gavin Newsom. Part of Ramer&#39;s job would be to act as a liaison between Khanna and various activist groups, trying to keep the representative in the good graces of his progressive base and to burnish his future reputation.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;On October 7th, Ramer&#39;s sixth day on the job, he woke up to the news that Hamas militants had broken through the border fence in Gaza and started slaughtering and kidnapping Israeli civilians. “My first reaction was to be sickened by the bloodshed,” he said. “My second thought was, When Israel responds, it&#39;s going to get so much worse.” Ramer, a redhead with a mustache, is descended from Mennonite pacifists on both sides of his family. His grandfather, a conscientious objector during the Vietnam War, was later arrested while scattering blood on the walls of the Pentagon, as part of a civil-disobedience action against nuclear weapons. (Ramer&#39;s mother, then twelve, watched her father get arrested. “I&#39;m scared, but I understand why he did it,” &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/local/1978/12/30/42-arrested-at-pentagon-nuclear-weapons-protest/0337847a-6d8a-4b6c-b983-e635654c6901/&quot;>;she told the Washington &lt;em>;Post&lt;/em>;&lt;/a>; at the time, her glasses dotted with blood.) In conversation, Ramer talks less about earmarks and executive orders than about vines and fig trees. “I hate politics,” he said. “But it&#39;s the most direct way I have found to try to reduce people&#39;s suffering.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Ramer was working remotely from Madison, Wisconsin, dog-sitting for his parents while they were on vacation. (They were not on a cruise or at a Club Med; they were on a group tour of Northern Ireland, learning about the protracted peace process that ended the Troubles.) In the hours after Hamas&#39;s attack, American and Israeli politicians started referring to it as “Israel&#39;s 9/11” and invoking an unqualified right to self-defense, as if the magnitude of the atrocities could preëmptively justify whatever Israel did next. But Ramer reflected on what he took to be the abiding lessons of 9/11, and of its grinding, decades-long aftermath: “No matter how full of anger and legitimate grief you may be, how do you not turn that grief into endless war?”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Khanna was one of Bernie Sanders&#39;s most outspoken supporters in the 2020 Presidential primary, but since then he has put distance between himself and other Sanders-aligned House members, including those in the so-called Squad. He refers to himself not as a democratic socialist but as a “progressive capitalist.” (He represents Silicon Valley, after all, and has received sizable &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.marketwatch.com/story/rep-ro-khanna-defends-fundraiser-at-david-sacks-home-after-supporting-silicon-valley-bank-bailout-f6b0f0dc&quot;>;donations&lt;/a>; from some of the rich men south of Richmond, California.) Ramer, who worked on Sanders&#39;s campaign in 2020, went to work for Khanna knowing that he was not a doctrinaire leftist. “He&#39;s strong on unions, on climate, on Medicare for All,” Ramer said. But it wasn&amp;#x27;t clear that Israel-Palestine was at the forefront of Khanna&#39;s mind—or any Democrat&#39;s mind, really—until the events of October 7th.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Shortly after the Hamas attack, Khanna put out a &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://twitter.com/RepRoKhanna/status/1710749751275028629&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://twitter.com/RepRoKhanna/status/1710749751275028629&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/RepRoKhanna/status/1710749751275028629&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;statement&lt;/a>; condemning it—a statement that no one, or at least no one with any credibility in American politics, could have opposed. (A few leftists online, citing a superficial reading of anti-colonial theory, were memeing themselves into the position that wanton murder was actually praxis, but such views had no currency in DC) Ramer tried to urge his boss to move beyond denunciation and toward deëscalation: “We can condemn Hamas unequivocally while standing unequivocally with Palestinian lives and decry the drums of war that are being hit right now,” he texted Khanna, who responded, “Yes, that&#39;s what I try to do.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The Israeli Defense Minister, Yoav Gallant, ordered a “complete siege” of Gaza. “There will be no electricity, no food, no fuel,” he &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/defense-minister-announces-complete-siege-of-gaza-no-power-food-or-fuel/&quot;>;declared&lt;/a>;. “We are fighting human animals and are acting accordingly.” Nearly nine hundred scholars &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://twailr.com/public-statement-scholars-warn-of-potential-genocide-in-gaza/&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://twailr.com/public-statement-scholars-warn-of-potential-genocide-in-gaza/&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://twailr.com/public-statement-scholars-warn-of-potential-genocide-in-gaza/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;warned&lt;/a>; that such dehumanizing rhetoric (“human animals”) has, in the past, been a precursor to genocide. When the air strikes started, killing thousands of Palestinian men, women, and children—and then again, when Isaac Herzog, the President of Israel, &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.yahoo.com/israeli-president-says-no-innocent-154330724.html&quot;>;reiterated&lt;/a>;, “It is an entire nation out there that is responsible”—many &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://euobserver.com/opinion/157602&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://euobserver.com/opinion/157602&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://euobserver.com/opinion/157602&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;observers argued&lt;/a>; that Israel was carrying out a policy of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/world/un-experts-say-israels-strikes-gaza-amount-collective-punishment-2023-10-12/&quot;>;collective punishment&lt;/a>;, making the civilian population of Gaza pay for Hamas&#39;s crimes, which, &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2023/10/commission-inquiry-collecting-evidence-war-crimes-committed-all-sides-israel&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2023/10/commission-inquiry-collecting-evidence-war-crimes-committed-all-sides-israel&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2023/10/commission-inquiry-collecting-evidence-war-crimes-committed-all-sides-israel&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;international experts&lt;/a>; noted, is a &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://casebook.icrc.org/a_to_z/glossary/collective-punishments#:~:text=International%20humanitarian%20law%20prohibits%20collective,punishment%20is%20a%20war%20crime.&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://casebook.icrc.org/a_to_z/glossary/collective-punishments#:~:text=International%20humanitarian%20law%20prohibits%20collective,punishment%20is%20a%20war%20crime.&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://casebook.icrc.org/a_to_z/glossary/collective-punishments#:~:text=International%20humanitarian%20law%20prohibits%20collective,punishment%20is%20a%20war%20crime.&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;war crime&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;House members held a candlelight vigil for Israeli victims of Hamas, and Khanna attended. (A Muslim staffer who works in another progressive Democrat&#39;s office told me that she and a few other Hill staffers, both Muslim and Jewish, tried to organize a separate vigil, honoring both the slain Israelis and the innocent Palestinians who had been killed, but that several colleagues advised her against it, saying that it would be too harmful to her career.) More than four hundred representatives co-sponsored a bipartisan House resolution whose official title was “Standing with Israel as it defends itself against the barbaric war launched by Hamas and other terrorists.” The &lt;a href=&quot;https://democrats-foreignaffairs.house.gov/_cache/files/9/5/95e229f8-89d8-43cb-bb98-2bdcc77a879a/D19CC80B24526B64867AB83ADC5A4A9D.hamas-res.pdf&quot;>;resolution&lt;/a>; rightly mourned Israeli and American deaths, yet it referred to Palestinian civilian casualties only in passing, and with little sympathy; it pledged “support” for Israel with no stated &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.twincities.com/2023/10/22/thomas-friedman-to-win-the-war-defeat-hamas-and-stop-settlements/&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.twincities.com/2023/10/22/thomas-friedman-to-win-the-war-defeat-hamas-and-stop-settlements/&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.twincities.com/2023/10/22/thomas-friedman-to-win-the-war-defeat-hamas-and-stop-settlements/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;preconditions&lt;/a>;, and made no mention of international humanitarian law. Still, J Street, a center-left lobbying group that describes itself as “pro-Israel, pro-peace,” was &lt;a href=&quot;https://theintercept.com/2023/10/13/j-street-israel-gaza-resolution/&quot;>;joining&lt;/a>; with groups to its right, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/09/01/friends-israel&quot;>;&lt;em >;AIPAC&lt;/em>;&lt;/a>;, to push representatives to co-sponsor the resolution. Some pro-Israel lobbyists seemed to be implying that almost any attempt to constrain Israel&#39;s military options would be understood as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://theintercept.com/2023/10/13/j-street-israel-gaza-resolution/&quot;>;betrayal&lt;/a>;. This was another way in which the days after October 7th resembled the days after 9/11: a consensus was starting to take hold in Washington, one in which public calls for deëscalation were portrayed as soft-brained lunacy or traitorous extremism. “The pressure I was getting from activists was, &#39;Are we just giving Israel a blank check?&#39; ” Ramer told me. “People noticed that there were thirteen members who had decided not to co-sponsor that resolution, and I heard from a bunch of people asking why Ro wasn&#39;t one of them.”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;4uveb&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;The short answer, it seemed, was that the political lines were becoming clearer, and Khanna was trying to avoid finding himself on the wrong side of them—or, really, to avoid being too strongly associated with any side, if he could help it. “Most politicians see Israel-Palestine as a no-win issue,” a Democratic operative told me. “The people who care most about the issue are hard-core Zionists and Arabs with relatives living under apartheid, and everyone else mostly doesn&#39;t give a shit.” Even Bernie Sanders, the most consistently &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://jacobin.com/2019/07/bernie-sanders-israel-palestine-bds&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://jacobin.com/2019/07/bernie-sanders-israel-palestine-bds&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://jacobin.com/2019/07/bernie-sanders-israel-palestine-bds&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;pro-Palestinian senator&lt;/a>; (he also once &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/06/us/politics/bernie-sanders-kibbutz.html&quot;>;lived in Israel&lt;/a>;), was not eager to take a vanguardist position on the issue. “He finds the Israel situation depressing, and he&#39;s annoyed that people are talking about this instead of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/11/06/will-the-uaw-strike-turn-the-rust-belt-green&quot;>;labor strikes&lt;/a>;,” a progressive political staffer told me. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-political-scene/inside-the-democrats-battle-to-build-back-better&quot;>;Pramila Jayapal&lt;/a>;, a representative from Seattle and the chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, co-sponsored the bipartisan resolution, although she privately expressed anguish about it. “She actually gives a shit about Palestinian lives, but she feels politically boxed in,” the staffer told me. Around this time, Jayapal told a colleague who ran into her at the airport that she felt compelled to support the bipartisan resolution, despite her misgivings—J Street and other pro-Israel groups had left her no choice.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;In private, the Biden Administration was reportedly &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/22/us/politics/us-hostages-israel-gaza.html&quot;>;pressing&lt;/a>; the Netanyahu administration to delay a ground invasion of Gaza and allow in a trickle of humanitarian aid. All the more reason, some members of Congress told their staff, to avoid taking a public position that could restrict Biden&#39;s room to negotiate. Some staffers considered this a principled stance; others thought that it was a convenient excuse. Ramer, alone with the dog in Madison, was up at all hours, doomscrolling. “You have one internal voice going, Adam, you just started this job, your role is to be respectful and not cause problems,” he told me. “And then there&#39;s the other half of you that&#39;s thinking, If there&#39;s a chance of this spiralling into an ethnic-cleansing situation, or a world war, and there&#39;s anything the American government could be doing now to prevent it, and here I am texting with a US congressman, then I probably have a responsibility to keep pushing.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;American politics was bitterly partisan during the Presidencies of Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama, but one of the few areas of bipartisan consensus was staunch, often unquestioning support for Israel. The motif of an American left that was progressive “except for Palestine” became so familiar that Marc Lamont Hill, a CNN contributor who was fired after sharply criticizing Israel, used the phrase as a &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://thenewpress.com/books/except-for-palestine&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://thenewpress.com/books/except-for-palestine&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://thenewpress.com/books/except-for-palestine&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;book title&lt;/a>;. But, beginning in Obama&#39;s second term, two things started to happen simultaneously: the Democratic coalition &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.gallup.com/poll/246806/understanding-shifts-democratic-party-ideology.aspx&quot;>;shifted to the left&lt;/a>;, and Israeli politics &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/israel/2015-03-24/israels-right-turn&quot;>;shifted to the right&lt;/a>;. Democrats, both leftists and moderates, often spoke out against the authoritarian tendencies of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/07/04/does-hungary-offer-a-glimpse-of-our-authoritarian-future&quot;>;Viktor Orbán&lt;/a>;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/04/01/jair-bolsonaros-southern-strategy&quot;>;Jair Bolsonaro&lt;/a>;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tag/donald-trump&quot;>;Donald Trump&lt;/a>;—the sort of tendencies that were also exhibited, with increasing zeal, by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/in-israel-a-glimpse-of-a-trumpian-future&quot;>;Benjamin Netanyahu&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;When the Israeli military started to react to Hamas&#39;s attack, most Republicans, with the notable &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/12/us/politics/trump-hezbollah-israel-palestine.html&quot;>;exception&lt;/a>; of Donald Trump, stuck to the old script, with comments ranging from darkly &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2023/10/11/gop-rhetoric-hamas-00121051&quot;>;jingoist&lt;/a>; to candidly &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20231026-us-congressman-palestine-will-be-turned-into-a-parking-lot/&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20231026-us-congressman-palestine-will-be-turned-into-a-parking-lot/&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20231026-us-congressman-palestine-will-be-turned-into-a-parking-lot/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;exterminationist&lt;/a>;. Within the Democratic coalition, though, surprising new fissures started to emerge. Ben Rhodes, Barack Obama&#39;s former deputy national-security adviser, and Thomas Friedman, the stalwart moderate of the &lt;em>;Times&lt;/em>; Opinion page, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/29/opinion/israel-hamas-ceasefire.html&quot;>;found&lt;/a>; themselves &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nybooks.com/online/2023/10/18/gaza-the-cost-of-escalation/&quot;>;to the left&lt;/a>; of Senator John Fetterman, a salt-of-the-earth left-populist who also turned out to be an &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://twitter.com/SenFettermanPA/status/1716590914749993229&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://twitter.com/SenFettermanPA/status/1716590914749993229&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/SenFettermanPA/status/1716590914749993229&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;acerbic&lt;/a>; &lt;a href=&quot;https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2023/10/john-fetterman-israel-position-explained.html&quot;>;Zionist&lt;/a>;. Josh Paul, a high-ranking State Department official for more than a decade, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/posts/josh-paul-655a25263_explaining-my-resignation-activity-7120512510645952512-APhR&quot;>;resigned&lt;/a>; in protest of “our continued lethal assistance to Israel.” Nearly every institution—&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/dispatch/the-anguished-fallout-from-a-pro-palestinian-letter-at-harvard&quot;>;campuses&lt;/a>;, synagogues, families—seemed riven by internal conflict.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Beginning on Monday, October 16th, Ramer said, “movement folks started coalescing around a single demand”: a ceasefire in Gaza. In particular, he mentioned two left-wing Jewish groups: IfNotNow, founded in 2017, and Jewish Voice for Peace, founded in 1996. For its first two decades or so, JVP was a source of &lt;em>;tsuris&lt;/em>; within the Jewish-institutional world, but far from a political powerhouse. In recent years, though—and especially in recent weeks—both groups had seen a sharp increase in volunteers. “The old-line Zionist groups thought they had a monopoly on this issue,” a prominent Jewish critic of Israel told me. “Now they&#39;re freaking out because the next generation is joining the opposition—their kids are joining.” Two members of the Squad—Cori Bush, a former Black Lives Matter organizer, and Rashida Tlaib, the only Palestinian American in Congress—introduced a House &lt;a href=&quot;https://bush.house.gov/imo/media/doc/bushceasefirenowresolution.pdf&quot;>;resolution&lt;/a>; calling for a ceasefire. At one point, the progressive political staffer told me, “we had the text of the resolution, but we were wondering whether to wait and get someone to introduce it who would be perceived as less polarizing, like maybe Pramila or Mark Pocan”—a white progressive from Wisconsin who is not seen as a firebrand. “But then the feeling was, This is too urgent. Let&#39;s just put it out, and if it&#39;s perceived as a Squad thing, and other members feel they can&#39;t touch it, then so be it.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;This was more or less what happened. The word “ceasefire” became a shibboleth splitting the left in two, with politicians like Khanna and Jayapal, and even Sanders, stuck in the middle. The ceasefire resolution was introduced with thirteen co-sponsors—members of the Squad and their allies, essentially—all of whom were people of color. Waleed Shahid, a former staffer for Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, tweeted, “I&#39;ll buy gulab jamun for the first white member of Congress to endorse ceasefire in Gaza.” More than three hundred of Sanders&#39;s former staffers signed an open &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@formerberniestaff/open-letter-to-senator-bernie-sanders-9d1c10d99e99&quot;>;letter&lt;/a>;, and more than two hundred and fifty of Senator Elizabeth Warren&#39;s former staffers wrote &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@warrenstaff4peace/dear-senator-warren-9a8055d97f2f&quot;>;another&lt;/a>;, urging the senators to join the call. Kunoor Ojha, who worked on Warren&#39;s Presidential campaign, in 2020, told me, “I think she&#39;s engaging in good faith, but I suspect the pressure she&#39;s feeling from the other side is way more acute than what we&#39;ve seen on other issues.” JVP and IfNotNow started organizing demonstrations in support of the ceasefire resolution; &lt;em >;AIPAC&lt;/em>; started whipping votes against it. (“A ceasefire would only serve to leave Hamas armed and in power,” David Gillette, an &lt;em >;AIPAC&lt;/em>; lobbyist, wrote in an e-mail to congressional staffers.) Shortly after the air strikes on Gaza began, Antony Blinken, the US Secretary of State, had tweeted in favor of “advocacy for a cease-fire”—on its face, not an outlandish position for a diplomat to take. But this was cast as a dangerous capitulation—“The Biden Administration is showing its true colors,” a Republican representative from Florida wrote—and Blinken deleted the tweet.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;ddhph&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;JVP and IfNotNow led a rally on the National Mall, and five thousand people showed up. “We will not use the fact that many of our parents and grandparents and great-grandparents were refugees from genocide to justify making hundreds of thousands or even millions of new Palestinian refugees,” the author &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2008/12/08/outside-agitator&quot;>;Naomi Klein&lt;/a>; said, addressing the crowd. After the rally, more than three hundred protesters, including two dozen rabbis, entered the Cannon House Office Building, where they &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5ZAUrwiLsc&quot;>;occupied a rotunda&lt;/a>; for hours, chanting and davening and blowing shofars, until they were arrested by Capitol Police. Phillip Bennet, a staffer for Representative Summer Lee, could hear the commotion from his desk, and he visited during his lunch break. “I found it surprisingly beautiful,” he said. “I felt like I was in temple again.” He and another congressional staffer made the impromptu decision to join the group and get arrested. “Everyone was wearing these matching black T-shirts that said &#39;&lt;em >;NOT IN OUR NAME&lt;/em>;,&#39; ” he continued. “I was the only guy in the jail cell with a suit on.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;At the same time, down the hall, Klein and Beth Miller, a JVP staffer, were rushing among meetings with about a dozen members of Congress. “We talked to members who were still on the fence, and some of their staff was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2023/10/19/congress/hill-staff-call-for-cease-fire-israel-hamas-00122453&quot;>;pissed at them for not taking a stand&lt;/a>;,” Klein told me. An “inside-outside strategy,” she continued, “only works if you can build enough outside pressure to make your demands heard, and if there are people on the inside who are willing to be pressured. This was the first time, after decades of agitating from the left on this issue, when I&#39;ve seen both of those factors coincide.” Barbara Lee, the only member of Congress to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2021/08/17/barbara-lee-afghanistan-vote/&quot;>;vote against&lt;/a>; the authorization of the use of military force three days after 9/11, was wavering about the ceasefire resolution; by the end of the day, she had agreed to become a co-sponsor. The same afternoon, an organizer with IfNotNow told me, they called a staffer in Jayapal&#39;s office and said, “Just so you know, about fifty young Jewish activists are on their way to Pramila&#39;s office later today, and they&#39;re either going to be delivering a letter thanking her for joining the ceasefire resolution or they&#39;re going to be doing a sit-in to protest her for not joining.” The staffer responded, “Copy that,” and hung up the phone. (A spokesperson for Jayapal denied this version of events.) Shortly after, Bush&#39;s office heard that Jayapal wanted to co-sponsor the resolution.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Khanna still had not endorsed a ceasefire. The day the resolution was introduced, Adam Ramer, in his texts with Khanna, ramped up his internal advocacy. “People are reaching out and calling on us to support this resolution,” he wrote.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Who is?” the representative responded. Ramer listed various groups, including JVP and IfNotNow. “Can offer JVP and ifnotnow a zoom,” Khanna responded. Ramer said that he would try to placate the activists with a Zoom, but reiterated, with mounting urgency, that the movement was focussed on the demand for a ceasefire. Khanna demurred, writing, “Even Bernie has not called for this.”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;nt12v&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;“Just because Bernie and Biden admin is taking this line does not mean it is aligned with the progressive foreign policy moment,” Ramer wrote. “We are burning goodwill and the support of the organizers that I am here to build with.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;“Won&#39;t go further than Bernie/Warren on it as very complex,” Khanna texted. “So we need to highlight statements I have made—which is further than Buttigieg, Kamala, Newsom, Whitmer.” This was clearly his final answer. Ramer responded to the text with a thumbs-up emoji and put down his phone.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“I sat with that for a few hours,” Ramer told me. “I took a long walk in a park I really love. And I made up my mind: this is my red line.” That evening, he wrote Khanna a resignation letter. “I cannot in good conscience continue in this role,” he wrote. “Continued escalation will only kill more Israelis and Palestinians, and will impact American lives as well.” Khanna responded swiftly and tactfully: “You are a man of conviction. I respect that.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The following day, Ramer took a pre-planned flight to New York; the day after that, he and a few friends drove to DC, to join the rally on the National Mall. By the time he made it to Capitol Hill in person, he was no longer a political staffer, just another protester in the crowd.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Two Fridays ago, in the pouring rain, I joined Adam Ramer at another protest, on the steps of the New York Public Library. “Never Again Means Now,” the banners read, and “Free Palestine,” and “Colonized Since 1948,” and “Ceasefire Now.” Separately, across the street, a lone protester—or maybe a counter-protester, it was hard to tell—marched in tiny circles, holding a cardboard sign. “Jews Control US, UK &amp;amp; EU,” one side read. In case that was too subtle, on the other side were just two words: “&lt;em >;RICH JEWS&lt;/em>;.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;There were a few hundred people, a damp expanse of umbrellas and ponchos and keffiyehs and yarmulkes, filling the space between the steps and Fifth Avenue. They listened to a half-dozen speeches and then started walking east, toward Senator Kirsten Gillibrand&#39;s office. At one street corner, the protesters walked past two Israeli women who sat in a stopped car, seething with rage. “You support the terrorists!” one of the women, Sigal Gordon, screamed, honking and giving the protesters the finger. “You want women to be raped and murdered?”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;One of the protesters turned to face her. “Where does it say &#39;Hamas&#39; on my sign?” she shouted. “Show me where!” Her sign read “Let Gaza Live.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I identified myself as a journalist and asked Gordon what she thought of the protesters. “They&#39;re all terrorists,” she said. “Me, personally, I would murder all of them.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;As of this writing, the ceasefire resolution has eighteen co-sponsors, out of four hundred and thirty-five House seats; it&#39;s unlikely that it will ever come up for a vote. “Five years ago, that number absolutely would have been zero,” the progressive political staffer told me. “Now it&#39;s eighteen. That&#39;s kind of encouraging. It&#39;s also crushing, because that&#39;s how much power we have, and it&#39;s nowhere near enough.” Still, previous Presidents, in similar binds, have faced significant pressure almost entirely from flag-waving nationalists on the right; Biden is now being cross-pressured from his left, and this seems to be having an effect. “My guess is the Dems will find a way to triangulate,” the Democratic operative told me, on October 23rd. “The Squad supports a ceasefire, so they can&#39;t be for that, but, now that that&#39;s the left flank of the debate, they can support something else—a cessation, maybe, or a truce.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The following day, it became clear what that something else would be: a “humanitarian pause.” On October 24th, Antony Blinken &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://abcnews.go.com/International/blinken-backs-israel-unsc-humanitarian-pauses-considered-protect/story?id=104253042&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://abcnews.go.com/International/blinken-backs-israel-unsc-humanitarian-pauses-considered-protect/story?id=104253042&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://abcnews.go.com/International/blinken-backs-israel-unsc-humanitarian-pauses-considered-protect/story?id=104253042&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;told&lt;/a>; the UN that “humanitarian pauses must be considered”; the day after that, Bernie Sanders gave a speech on the Senate floor calling for a “humanitarian pause”; by the end of last week, Khanna had &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://twitter.com/RoKhanna/status/1717921836875354473&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://twitter.com/RoKhanna/status/1717921836875354473&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/RoKhanna/status/1717921836875354473&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;echoed&lt;/a>; the phrase, as had Jamie Raskin, Dan Goldman, and several other House Democrats, and NBC News &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/biden-blinken-humanitarian-pause-israel-military-campaign-hamas-gaza-rcna122206&quot;>;reported&lt;/a>; that “the White House is now backing the idea of a &#39;pause.&#39; ” In hindsight, it was reasonable to call for &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://lithub.com/susan-sontag-reacting-to-9-11-in-the-new-yorker-remains-essential-reading/&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://lithub.com/susan-sontag-reacting-to-9-11-in-the-new-yorker-remains-essential-reading/&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://lithub.com/susan-sontag-reacting-to-9-11-in-the-new-yorker-remains-essential-reading/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;caution&lt;/a>; after 9/11, and I have joined in similar calls for caution &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/oct/19/biden-jewish-americans-israel-gaza-call-for-ceasefire&quot;>;now&lt;/a>;, signing an open letter in support of a ceasefire. “If there&#39;s any lesson here, after we get past this war, it&#39;s that the US&#39;s desire to pivot away from the Palestinian issue was a colossal blunder,” Khanna told me recently. “We can&#39;t just wish away the desire for Palestinian justice.”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;sntl6l&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;In New York City, the protesters stood outside of Gillibrand&#39;s office and made a few more speeches, and then more than a hundred of them sat on the wet street, in orderly rows, waiting to be arrested. A socialist brass band called Brass and Roses played, keeping morale high, and someone with drumsticks played a bus-stop shelter like a snare. The arrests began around 8 &lt;em >;PM&lt;/em>;; the protesters were flex-cuffed and loaded, with deliberate slowness, into double-length city buses. A young woman next to me held two burning candles in her hands. “I observe Shabbat, but I felt like I had to participate in this,” she told me. Ramer, who had volunteered to do jail support, collected people&#39;s belongings before they were arrested, then took a subway to 1 Police Plaza and waited for them to get out. The last of them were released at one-thirty in the morning. When I talked to Ramer about Gaza, after we had gone over all the political and legal and geostrategic arguments, he made a theological argument, the same one that Abraham makes in Genesis 18: “If there be fifty righteous men within the city, wilt thou also destroy and not spare the place?” ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;

Those who owe loans should pay them. The country needs more victors than victims. This summer, at an event in Des Moines, an audience of largely white evangelical voters applauded him heartily as he made his way offstage. At a table in the back of the auditorium was Glenn Beck, the former Fox News host turned conservative media magnate, whose outlet had been running a live stream. Scott slipped on a pair of chunky headphones and sat down with Beck for an interview.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“I love you, you know that,” Beck told him. He felt differently, however, about Scott&#39;s home state.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Historically, I&#39;m pissed off at South Carolina,” Beck said. “The Civil War started—”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“In Charleston,” Scott interrupted, pointing to himself. “My home town.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Do you ever think about how far we have come?” Beck asked. “That the state that was the centerpiece at the beginning, that has caused all of these problems, and then started the Civil War—you are now a beloved senator of that same state?”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;It was the type of question, with its yearning for racial absolution, that Scott has often seized. “I&#39;m African American, as you can tell,” he said, and he invited Beck to “think about my journey.” His grandfather had only an elementary-school education; his mother grew up in a society in which Black people were not allowed to drink from certain water fountains; he pointed out to Beck that, despite all of that history, he was able to defeat white candidates with deep political legacies to become a member of Congress.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;“America works,” Scott told him.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The sins of the Civil War, made clean through Scott&#39;s powerful ascent. For a certain kind of white Republican voter, Scott&#39;s political career represents an escape valve in a society pressurized by its racist past. Black voters, many in his own community, have resented him for similar reasons. They&#39;ve warned for years that Scott looks at the country through a concave mirror shaped by his own experience, distorting his personal success and minimizing the larger struggles that come with being Black in America.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Speaking to Beck, Scott marshalled an early example of that personal success. When he was in eighth grade,“there was a race riot at the high school my brother was at, that I was going to attend the next year,” he told him. “Four years later, I&#39;m the president of the student government of that high school.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Wow,” Beck said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;He went on, “When people talk about American progress and they pretend like it stopped in 1963, it is a lie from the pit of hell.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Scott presents this high-school victory as a tidy tale of racism overcome by personal determination. But it&#39;s not quite the triumph that he has made it out to be. Scott&#39;s experience at RB Stall High School—and what happened both to him and to the school in the years that followed—offers a different kind of American story, one that&#39;s messier and more complicated, with very different implications for how progress works.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Go back to North Charleston, 1970, nearly a decade before the “race riot.” That spring, Black schoolchildren in the community received surprising news. More than fifteen years after Brown v. Board of Education, the school district conceded that it could no longer defy the Supreme Court&#39;s integration mandate. Many students who were scheduled to attend Bonds-Wilson, the city&#39;s all-Black high school, would instead be distributed among three of the city&#39;s previously white schools.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Bonds-Wilson had been built around 1950 in a last-ditch effort to prove that the state could adhere to the principles of “separate but equal.” It nevertheless became a beloved institution for the Black community, a school within walking distance for many of its students, with instructors who actually lived in the neighborhood. “Before a game, the marching band would come down my street,” Donna McQueen, now a lawyer, told me. As a child, she would sit on top of the stone wall in front of her family&#39;s home, listening for soul and rock music in the distance. Then she&#39;d see them: a mass of teen-agers in freshly pressed blue-and-gold uniforms, marching in unison alongside high-stepping, hip-shaking majorettes. “I remember saying to myself, &#39;I am going to lead that band,&#39; ” she said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The year after Bonds-Wilson was broken up, McQueen, who was in eighth grade, joined Black students who were being bused to the new schools. A small contingent went to Stall. “Stall was in an all-white neighborhood,” McQueen said. “Next to it was all forest. So, if something happened, there would be nowhere to run.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Juanita Sanders was a student on one of those buses. Her parents had encouraged her to focus on her schoolwork. But, as the bus pulled into the campus, Sanders saw a group of white classmates waiting in the parking lot, staring at them. “The problems started immediately,” Sanders told me. She was in the bathroom one day, early on, when a white student confronted her. “Get out of the bathroom, nigger,” the student said. “You don&#39;t belong here.” Sanders punched her. “It was a fight, every day,” she recalled.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Inside the classroom, Sanders confronted the limits of her supposedly “equal” previous education. In her old elementary school, she had been at the top of her class. Now she was so far behind that it felt like she had been using an entirely different set of textbooks. Although many staff members at Stall clearly treated Black students worse than their white counterparts, some teachers made an extra effort to help them catch up. In 1973, McQueen&#39;s sophomore year, a teacher named Karen Cabe Gibson joined the school. She had grown up in rural North Carolina and wanted to work at an all-Black high school in Charleston after college. She told me that the county superintendent rejected her request. “He said he was not going to put a young white girl over there,” Gibson said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The teachers&#39; union fought the decision, but in the meantime Gibson was offered a job at Stall. She welcomed the sight of Black and white students sitting together in her classroom. Most hailed from poor and working-class neighborhoods—race was the biggest difference among them. “They had a hard time being friends with each other,” Gibson said. She taught civics and political science, and tried to ease tensions with class discussions. “If you do not allow people to be treated equally, then you&#39;re in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment,” Gibson would tell her students.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;borgf5&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;5i6cy9&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Black students often complained to Gibson that they felt powerless. They were never able to secure enough votes to win homecoming queen or to lead the student government. As a co-sponsor of the Afro-American club, Gibson tried to help them strategize. “Well, you guys need to learn how to pool your votes,” she told them. Multiple Black students shouldn&#39;t run for the same position. “At this point in the history of this country, you probably need to focus on who you want to get elected and put your votes all for that person.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;McQueen had dreamed of being a drum major, but after a couple of years performing in the Stall band—with its rigid rhythms and staid steps—she quit. In 1975, she decided to run for president of the student government. With encouragement from Gibson and other teachers, she figured she had a shot; she had good grades and was on the cheerleading squad. “You couldn&#39;t do things back then just because you wanted to do them,” McQueen told me. “There had to be a reason. It had to be for your people.” Black students made up around thirteen per cent of the school; they supported McQueen, and she gathered enough additional white votes to prevail. Tim Scott frames his election as the school&#39;s president as transformative, but it was McQueen who paved the way.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“I still don&#39;t believe I won,” she told me, and apparently neither could some in the community. One morning, not long after McQueen&#39;s victory, she was getting ready for school when she saw her father pick up the phone. It was the principal, who suggested that McQueen stay home—a burning cross had been found on the school&#39;s front lawn. McQueen refused. She had perfect attendance, and she did not want to seem intimidated. She later petitioned the superintendent and her principal to host a countywide summit on race. She and a diverse group of other school presidents discussed why Black students were punished more harshly than white ones, and they pushed for staff and teachers to provide more opportunities for Black students, such as recommending them for Rotary Club scholarships.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;McQueen sensed that her schoolmates, both Black and white, were rallying behind her. One time, she was in the school&#39;s main office when she overheard a white parent complaining to the principal that the school had gone too far in empowering Black students. It would have been a dispiriting moment had it not been for the woman&#39;s son, who was standing nearby. He made eye contact with McQueen and mouthed, “I voted for you.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“That was one of those moments that I believed I had done something to make a difference,” McQueen said. “The kids accepted you even when their parents would not.” For students at the beginning of this project of integration, McQueen said that “high school felt like work.” After graduating, in 1976, she wanted the chance to just be a student, so she headed to Spelman College, a historically Black institution. She left Stall thinking that the school was in a good place. Two years later, though, a violent incident put the progress that McQueen had presided over into question.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;n51b4w&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;No one knows for sure why the fight broke out. Gibson heard one explanation, a tale as old as the South: a Black boy said something to a white girl, which angered her boyfriend. Another story—possibly connected—was that two gangs, one Black and the other white, needed to settle a conflict. Earlier, a member of the white gang had supposedly punched a Black student so hard that his nose bled, and then bragged, “I got me a nigger.” According to an account published by the Charleston &lt;em>;Post &amp;amp; Courier&lt;/em>;, Black students had been upset because white teen-agers had destroyed mailboxes in their neighborhood.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;The different hypotheses shared a common theme: cross-racial coexistence at the school was so fragile that a minor incident could destroy it. On a Tuesday in April, 1978, Steve Brockmiller, a white underclassman, saw a group of Black students running through the parking lot. A group of white students burst through the school doors to confront them. The fight began, and then got bigger and bigger—Gibson recalled students jumping out of windows to join in. “Several of my friends got stabbed,” Brockmiller, who prided himself on having a multiracial circle of friends, told me. “They were all out there, and it was a bunch of fighting going on.” Police took about half an hour to calm things down. At least five students were arrested, and several were sent to the hospital.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Questions about interracial education resurfaced among parents and faculty. Police were stationed throughout the school, and students began to view one another with suspicion again. “Every time you passed someone that was Black, they looked at you,” Brockmiller said. “What were they sizing you up for? We all had gotten along. I didn&#39;t understand how something could change so quick.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;By the fall of 1979, nine years after integration, many white families had fled Stall, and the proportion of Black students continued to increase. The new classes mostly came from integrated middle schools, and many had friends of different races. “We knew each other,” Kathy Simmons, Juanita Sanders&#39;s younger sister, told me.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;One of the freshmen was Timothy Eugene Scott. He had large brown eyes, a small Afro, and two buckteeth that his mother couldn&#39;t afford to fix. His family had recently moved to a ranch home in one of North Charleston&#39;s better-off neighborhoods, but he had grown up in a poorer, underdeveloped part of town. Neighbors there remember him running down dirt roads as a little boy, tossing a football and talking about going pro.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“We played football, football, and more football,” Adrian Williams, a childhood friend, told me.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Williams and Scott wound up together on the team at Stall. Both played running back. Scott had a reputation for being diligent and hardworking, maybe a tad arrogant, but not the type to make rousing speeches in the locker room at halftime. Off the field, his classmates remember him as an introvert, someone who was well liked and seemed eager to find community. He was not a dedicated academic. During his freshman year, he failed geography, civics, English, and Spanish. He often says, “When you fail English and Spanish, they don&#39;t call you bilingual. They call you bi-ignant.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;As a sophomore, Scott began to improve. When he got to Gibson&#39;s political-science class, he found himself particularly engaged and curious. Gibson loved discussing elections and often invited lawmakers to the classroom. She organized debates in which students had to learn how to understand and defend positions they didn&#39;t necessarily hold, in subjects such as Latin American diplomacy and Middle East politics. Scott loved learning about the art of compromise, coalition building, and dealmaking.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;During his junior year, Scott toyed around with the idea of running for president of the student government. A close friend and future prom date (it was not romantic) named Donna Neighbors, who was white, encouraged him. Together, they pasted signs across the school that read “Great Scott for Student Government President!” His opponent was a Filipina student named Mary Anne Veloso. She was “brilliant,” Gibson recalled.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;2lx4ws&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;phbp1&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;The candidates had to deliver speeches in front of the student body. Veloso had many achievements to draw from: according to an alumni Web site, she had been class president her freshman and junior years, was a member of the art club and the orchestra, and read the announcements on the school&#39;s PA system.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Scott deployed a different strategy. “Who wants a free lunch?”他说。 The crowd laughed, and then cheered. Scott insisted he was going to be serious, then launched into his next joke: “Lunchtime is far too short!”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Gibson, who was moderating the event, started to smile. She wanted the school to take elections seriously—but Scott was charming. Students voted him in. In his victory, Gibson saw progress. Unlike McQueen, he didn&#39;t need to rely on consolidating Black votes, nor did he express the same obligation to use the position to eradicate prejudice. There were no summits on racism; Scott helped to plan homecoming and an overnight retreat in a cabin.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Scott has claimed that most racism he experienced at Stall came from other Black students, who called him an Oreo. He didn&#39;t sit in the predominantly Black section of the cafeteria, nor was he intensely involved in the Afro-American club. I spoke with some of his Black classmates from the time, who didn&#39;t remember there being animus toward him. Darlesa West Barron, who was a year behind Scott, told me, “I can still see him—a big smile, making speeches. When I think about Tim Scott, it was, like, look at him, he wanted to be successful in the world.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Growing up, Scott had witnessed two almost directly opposed ways of moving through the world as a Black person. His father, Ben, had fought in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tag/vietnam-war&quot;>;Vietnam War&lt;/a>;. Scott wrote, in his book, “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/America-Redemption-Story-Choosing-Creating-ebook/dp/B09RSZDDYS&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/America-Redemption-Story-Choosing-Creating-ebook/dp/B09RSZDDYS&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/America-Redemption-Story-Choosing-Creating-ebook/dp/B09RSZDDYS&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;America, a Redemption Story&lt;/a>;,” that after his father returned he&#39;d hear people call him “a n--- baby killer.” His pain transformed into bitterness, and from bitterness into rage. “All I remember is the green shag carpet, the shouting, the sound of fists slamming into walls,” Scott recalled in the book. (He denied multiple requests for an interview.) When Scott was seven, his mother, Frances, packed up her green Plymouth Cricket, loaded Scott and his nine-year-old brother into it, and left their father behind.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The family moved in with Frances&#39;s parents. Her father, Artis Ware, who had spent years picking cotton on his father&#39;s farm, offered a different outlook on racism. “You can be bitter or you can be better,” he told his grandchildren. “But you can&#39;t be both.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Ware introduced Scott to Bobo Brazil, the brawny brawler who broke the color line in the world of professional wrestling—a Black man who could get white audiences to cheer for him. Scott remembers seeing Ware each morning at the dining table, sitting with his newspaper open. Scott later learned that this was a pantomime: his grandfather didn&#39;t know how to read. The lesson stuck. Be self-reliant. Send the right message, even if it requires a bit of performative optimism.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;jfa5sg&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;In 1983, Scott graduated from Stall and went to Presbyterian College on a football scholarship. Sean Bennett, a state senator who graduated from Stall a couple of years after Scott, told me that Scott set a good example for how white and Black students could find some comity. But the struggles at Stall didn&#39;t go away. During the next few decades, there would be more fights—in the parking lots, in the cafeteria, and in the hallways. On their surfaces, they were about girls or neighborhoods or disrespect. The undercurrents, though, were often racial. Meanwhile, the school&#39;s white population continued to decrease as white families left the area. After electing multiple Black presidents, Stall was becoming segregated again.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;One day in the early nineties, a local chapter of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tag/republican-party&quot;>;Republican Party&lt;/a>; was gearing up for a meeting inside the North Charleston City Hall. Terrye Campsen Seckinger, who is now a commissioner on the state board of higher education, was chatting with a few attendees when she noticed something strange. “Out of the corner of my eyes, I see this Black guy,” Seckinger, who is white, told me. He was tall, and built, and seemed a little nervous—justifiably so. This was still South Carolina, where such meetings could be as segregated as church pews. An elderly woman approached him. “You are not welcome here,” she said. He made a face and headed for the exit. Seckinger chased after him.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Wait a minute, wait a minute,” she said. “I&#39;m excited that you&#39;re here. Tell me about you.” He told her that he was an insurance agent and that he had learned about business principles from a Republican who owned a Chick-fil-A, which was near a movie theatre where he worked in high school. He talked about the faith that he had found at a small Christian college before he transferred to Charleston Southern, and his interest in public service.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;“I&#39;ve been wanting to get involved for a while,” he said. “I&#39;m Tim Scott.” Seckinger hoped that his presence would mark a new era for the Party. In a state like South Carolina, with its toxic history of racism, an ambassador such as Scott could demonstrate that the GOP had moved past skin color. The local Republican Party poured money into a campaign to get Scott elected to the county council. A Black Republican? “This is going to be just one more nail in the Democrats&#39; coffin,” Henry McMaster, the state&#39;s current governor, said at the time.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;When Scott began to tell Black political leaders that he was running for office, they were not surprised. At events at the local NAACP, he had given speeches in which he&#39;d relay his own journey out of poverty and encourage attendees to start new businesses. What was shocking was the ticket he planned to run on.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“A Republican?” James Johnson, one of the state&#39;s leading civil-rights activists, said. “Why would you do that?” Scott&#39;s answer was “I want to be rich,” Johnson told me. Scott&#39;s campaign denied this, but Scott has said that the Democratic Party told him “to wait my turn and go to the back of the line.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Being a Republican had political advantages. The county was two-thirds white, and the council members weren&#39;t elected from specific districts. Many white Republicans could get behind a Black man who spoke the language of Christian conservatism, which would help secure the broad countywide coalition Scott needed. In 1995, Scott won a seat on the Charleston County Council with a raft of white support, a feat that he said many could not have imagined. He told the &lt;em>;Post &amp;amp; Courier&lt;/em>; that he had bigger ambitions: one day, he wanted to be Vice-President.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Why not President?” someone asked.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“I thought about that,” he said. “But as Vice-President you get to speak more and have a forum to deliver messages.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;So began his political climb, to the state legislature, in 2009, to the US House of Representatives, in 2011, and then, two years later, to the Senate—where he became the first Black member from the South since Reconstruction. He focussed on balancing budgets and cutting government spending. In Washington, DC, he was cast as the conservative foil to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tag/barack-obama&quot;>;Barack Obama&lt;/a>;, the evidence that Republicans presented when their opposition to the first Black President was characterized as racist.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Many Black people in North Charleston had just about given up on Scott&#39;s politics long before. In 2001, the Department of Justice had filed a lawsuit claiming that the county&#39;s lack of voting districts violated the Voting Rights Act by diluting the power of Black votes: in the years leading up to the suit, candidates who won the majority of those votes were defeated in almost every instance. Scott&#39;s base of support was majority white, and in his electoral victories the county found its defense. “We&#39;ve already got a minority,” Barrett Lawrimore, the council chairman, told the New York &lt;em>;Times&lt;/em>;. Scott later said, “The system does not discriminate.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;After the court ordered the county to move toward district-based elections, Scott altered his position. He heard about someone in the county government using a racial slur, one of several instances that prompted him to think that maybe the institution wasn&#39;t color-blind. “I think the racial overtones of Charleston County government would be lessened with more minority representation, and my opinion has changed drastically since the beginning of last year,” Scott said. (Scott&#39;s campaign now denies that he ever changed his mind.) Edward Bryant III, the former head of the local NAACP, told me that it was the beginning of a pattern with Scott—it seemed as though he had to encounter racism on a personal level to acknowledge that it existed.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;ycpwzq&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;xmflbl&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;More than a decade later, two high-profile incidents—the police killing of Walter Scott and the mass shooting at Mother Emanuel AME Church in Charleston—took place in Scott&#39;s own community.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“What&#39;s happening in North Charleston?” Scott asked Bryant after the police shooting.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“The same thing that always happens,” Bryant told him. He reiterated something that he had tried to convey to Scott since he had entered politics. “I don&#39;t care if you&#39;re a Democrat. I don&#39;t care if you&#39;re a Republican, or you&#39;re Green Party,” Bryant said. “Do something for your people.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;As proof that he has supported the Black community, Scott often cites his sponsorship of a piece of federal legislation, which passed in 2017, to give tax breaks to businesses that develop underserved, disproportionately minority neighborhoods, so-called opportunity zones. But, in 2019, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/31/business/tax-opportunity-zones.html&quot;>;&lt;em>;Times&lt;/em>; investigation&lt;/a>; found that the provision mostly helped wealthy developers with preëxisting plans to build high-end amenities in gentrifying neighborhoods, offering little to poor families who already lived there. Scott has fought successfully to reduce prison sentences for people convicted of nonviolent offenses and attempted to pass some federal police reform after the murder of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tag/george-floyd&quot;>;George Floyd&lt;/a>;, but he doesn&#39;t emphasize those parts of his record today—they don&#39;t jibe with his party&#39;s tough-on-crime talking points.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Scott has recognized that he is not immune to some of the experiences that come with being a Black man in America. On the Senate floor, he has talked about anxiously watching videos of police killings, and growing frustrated at being racially profiled. In high school, he found notes with racial slurs written in his locker. He handles that sort of thing now as he did back then: by minimizing, by emphasizing forgiveness, by delivering a message of faith. “America can do for anyone what she has done for me,” he tells people on the trail.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In August, Scott appeared at a town hall in Charleston, the beginning of a campaign jag across his home state. The crowd was overwhelmingly white and white-haired. They sat at tables and nibbled on Chick-fil-A nuggets. Scott discussed border security and tax policy, but the people in attendance seemed more interested in talking to me about race.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Seckinger, who had stopped Scott from leaving the local GOP meeting three decades ago, was there. She felt that Scott was heading toward his original political ambition. “I really want Tim to be Donald Trump&#39;s Vice-President,” she told me. “The liberals would go crazy! They cannot stand a Black Republican—it&#39;s, like, untenable for them. I don&#39;t see Tim as Black. I see Tim as my friend. But, because he&#39;s Black, it&#39;s going to drive them crazy if he&#39;s Vice-President. Isn&#39;t that something?”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Standing nearby was Margaret Rittenbury, a woman with long hair and thick glasses, who clapped along enthusiastically. She had fallen in love with Scott&#39;s politics after watching him at a Tea Party event in 2011. He&#39;d pepper his talks with amens and hallelujahs. He&#39;d describe Obama as a socialist and accuse Democrats of bankrupting the government. “We must be free to dream again,” Scott often said. “The entitlement mentality is simply uninspiring.” She marvelled at his grace, which she figured must have been hard-earned “coming up, as a Black man in the South, where, believe me, we can be mean.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;“I have metastatic cancer, but I&#39;m going to stay alive to vote for him,” she told me, her voice breaking. “He knows this country—you know the story about him growing up in poverty and all that. And, I tell you, Stall High School was horrible. At least when I was a kid. I don&#39;t try to be rude, but it was dangerous.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Stall is still trying to break its reputation as “the school that fights.” I visited the school the following day. Stephen Larson, the principal, was walking around the cafeteria, trying to connect his cell phone to the speaker system. “Two years ago, we had more fights than there were school days,” he told me. “Last year, we reduced fights by sixty per cent.” “Break My Soul,” by Beyoncé, started to play, and some students were nae-naeing in the corner. Larson had discovered that good dance music could defuse tensions.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;22dpvp&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;The fights at Stall today are no longer so-called race riots between Black and white students. Those ended—not because of a persuasive student-body president but because there are hardly any white students left. As in many schools across the country, white and Black students in North Charleston are more segregated now than they were in the eighties. Meanwhile, abundant construction jobs—partly the result of business development championed by Republicans—have drawn immigrants to the area, many of whom have settled in local trailer parks.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The school is in the midst of another demographic shift: from almost exclusively Black to Black and Latino. Its yearbook is printed in English and Spanish, and many of the new students are undocumented. As was the case in Scott&#39;s household, their parents struggle to pay the bills. But America can&#39;t do for them what it did for Scott. They would have a tough time getting to and from an after-school job—in South Carolina, being undocumented means that you can&#39;t get a driver&#39;s license. Taking accelerated courses at the local college would be a stretch, too—undocumented students don&#39;t qualify for in-state tuition. Many of the area&#39;s top students now go to charters and magnets; Stall is one of the worst-ranked schools in the state. (The best one in the county is a predominantly white magnet program that convenes on the old Bonds-Wilson campus.)&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Larson has tried to build a decent school anyway. He partnered with a local clinic so that students can receive free health care. He added more staff members to keep a closer eye on students who are struggling. Graduation rates are ticking up. He talks a lot about “showering students with love.” Recently, he told a group of students, “You go to one of the best high schools.” They laughed at him.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Larson understands that there&#39;s only so much he can control. He told me, “It&#39;s a handshake that doesn&#39;t feel right. We say, &#39;We&#39;ve got you. We&#39;re going to take care of you for four years, or longer if necessary.&#39; But I don&#39;t know what I can give you afterward.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;When Scott first became a US senator, he teared up after being told that students from his old high school were going to watch him get sworn in live on television. His campaign told me that he has tried to raise money and create internships for the school. He delivered a commencement address in 2014 and visited in 2016. “The biggest mistake I made in life . 。 。 was having dreams in high school that were too small,” he told students. “Whatever you think the best is that you can do, just double it.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Nowadays, most of the students don&#39;t even know that Scott went there, teachers told me. One of his most recent appearances was about six years ago, at an alumni event. Shawnta Brown, a parent and a racial-justice advocate, confronted Scott about the school&#39;s poor test scores and the high levels of violence, an interaction that Scott&#39;s campaign disputes. “You&#39;re not doing anything for the school at all,” she said. “You got your jersey up on the wall, and these kids look up to it, and you&#39;re not doing anything.” He smiled politely, Brown told me, then turned around and walked away. ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;q2o9zj&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 02 Nov 2023 03:06:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Remembering Robert Brustein, a Giant of the American Theatre]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.newyorker.com/culture/postscript/remembering-robert-brustein-a-giant-of-the-american-theatre]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-01T18:03:38.308Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653fd8b10d137aa8cbc4ab10/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Shaw-Robert-Brustein-Postscript.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;article >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attribute-verso-pattern=&quot;article-body&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;ArticlePageChunks&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;When Robert Brustein died, at ninety-six, he concluded not one but four stunning careers. A critic at &lt;em>;The New Republic,&lt;/em>; off and on, for more than forty years, he was a university professor who founded two major theatres—the Yale Repertory Theatre, in New Haven, and the American Repertory Theatre, at Harvard. He authored more than a dozen books and produced hundreds of plays. Along the way, he supported and championed an entire American theatrical pantheon, including the playwrights &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1997/11/17/fortress-mamet&quot;>;David Mamet&lt;/a>; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2006/10/30/the-show-woman&quot;>;Suzan-Lori Parks&lt;/a>;, directors such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/05/30/robert-wilsons-light-installation-at-hermes&quot;>;Robert Wilson&lt;/a>; and JoAnne Akalaitis, and actors like Cherry Jones, F. Murray Abraham, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/meryl-streeps-twenties-and-my-own&quot;>;Meryl Streep&lt;/a>;. He himself was also a playwright: my favorite work of his is a klezmer-infused adaptation of Isaac Bashevis Singer&#39;s “Shlemiel the First,” produced at the ART in 1994.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Brustein held theatre to a high standard—one that was intellectual, visually audacious, international, explicitly noncommercial, and devoted to the now almost vanished model of a resident theatre company playing in a rotating repertory. One of his hallmark offerings at Harvard, for graduate students, was a class called Rep Ideal, in which he held forth on how a permanent company of actors could forge a bond between the institution and a community. Nothing else, he said, could create such a flexible acting instrument, nor offer a visiting director (say, from Eastern Europe) such a thrilling challenge. His well-forged ART company (mostly made up of gifted clowns) was, he felt, the reason his theatre could take on wild opportunities—a section of Robert Wilson&#39;s epic multimedia experiment “The Civil Wars,” for instance—that might boggle an ad-hoc ensemble.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Brustein had a fifth and more ill-defined career, too, as a public intellectual. Do we even have those anymore? A storm often brewed around Brustein—and his lightning strikes were visible across the country. His debate at Town Hall with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2001/04/16/august-wilson-been-here-and-gone&quot;>;August Wilson&lt;/a>;, in 1997, about race in American theatre, made national news: the two titans battled over everything from so-called “race blind” casting (Wilson was against it) to the formation of Black theatres (Brustein considered them self-segregating). Brustein valued the thrust and parry of the mind. In his seminal book of popular criticism, “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Theatre-Revolt-Studies-modern-drama/dp/0929587537&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Theatre-Revolt-Studies-modern-drama/dp/0929587537&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Theatre-Revolt-Studies-modern-drama/dp/0929587537&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;The Theatre of Revolt&lt;/a>;,” he asks you to understand the mutton-chopped, bourgeois Ibsen as a bomb-throwing rebel. I read “Theatre of Revolt” every year, yet, when I come across his theatrical reviews from the sixties, I sometimes recoil at their pugnacious tone—as, later in life, did he.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;At &lt;em>;The New Republic,&lt;/em>; he threw his own critical grenades, sometimes as a way to open a path for the more experimental work he loved. &lt;em>;The New Yorker&#39;s&lt;/em>; own John Lahr corresponded with Brustein in 2014 about a particularly lacerating line in a 1980 review of Tennessee Williams&#39;s “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Clothes-Summer-Hotel-Tennessee-Williams/dp/0811208710/&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Clothes-Summer-Hotel-Tennessee-Williams/dp/0811208710/&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Clothes-Summer-Hotel-Tennessee-Williams/dp/0811208710/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;Clothes for a Summer Hotel&lt;/a>;,” in which Brustein had written, “I suspect the playwright would just as soon let the moment pass in silence while he licks his wounds and ponders his next move (perhaps a flight to Three Mile Island on a one-way ticket).” In a warm e-mail exchange with Lahr, Williams&#39;s biographer, Brustein seemed sure he hadn&#39;t said any such thing. “I can&#39;t imagine myself making such a cruel and aggressive remark,” he wrote. By then, his approach to artists had softened, perhaps from age, or from the experience of being in the creative hurly-burly himself. “He disowned a lot of those fierce opinions,” Lahr told me.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Yet Brustein&#39;s legacy will, at least in part, be this air of combat. In a discussion group, the producer Rocco Landesman once laughingly reminded Brustein that he had held the rights to “Big River” when ART mounted it, after Brustein inveighed against nonprofits producing work in tandem with commercial producers. “Bob expressed great surprise but didn&#39;t change his opinion for a second,” the Public Theatre&#39;s artistic director Oskar Eustis told me over e-mail, admiring Brustein&#39;s ability to stick by a principle even while not entirely adhering to it. And, by Brustein&#39;s own account, he was partly to blame for some hostility between the Boston audience and his theatre, which lost early subscribers by the fistful after, among other things, a Lee Breuer production of Wedekind&#39;s “Lulu,” in which Jack the Ripper slashed Lulu&#39;s throat, then washed his bloody hands in a toilet bowl. “It didn&#39;t help when, in trying to account for the exodus, I opened my big mouth on radio to speculate that perhaps we had overestimated the extent of Boston&#39;s theatrical sophistication,” Brustein wrote, in a not-altogether-self-effacing essay.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;But there&#39;s another legacy, too. I first saw the great classical performer John Douglas Thompson at the ART, in a Ron Daniels production of Shakespeare&#39;s “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Henry-V-Folger-Shakespeare-Library/dp/0743484878&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Henry-V-Folger-Shakespeare-Library/dp/0743484878&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Henry-V-Folger-Shakespeare-Library/dp/0743484878&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;Henry V&lt;/a>;,” in 1995. Five actors, playing the entire French Army, appeared in a line with huge, silk-caparisoned horse puppets buckled around their waists—their feet, in platform shoes, became hooves. They pranced in place, too proud to notice that the floor (a mechanical elevator that lowered into the orchestra pit) was sinking beneath them. Thompson spoke wistfully with me about his time being honed by Brustein&#39;s year-in, year-out company model, which has since been abandoned. “With Robert being gone, the atmosphere is also gone,” Thompson told me. “It&#39;s the end of an era, of all the potential that regional theatre had built up—and what it could be going forward.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;I met Brustein as an undergraduate at Harvard in the mid-nineties, when the university was briefly reconsidering its relationship with the ART Brustein, who came to Cambridge in 1980, had installed his organization in the Loeb Drama Center, which the students had always rather assumed belonged to them. In the late nineties, Harvard held a series of panel discussions about the relationship; I was then the president of the Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club and gave a little testimonial in favor. Harvard at that time had no drama department, and so much of our education in theatre-as-practice was in making our own stuff—and in seeing the workings of a company up close.&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;I learned a lot from Brustein&#39;s classes and criticism, but perhaps even more from the plays he programmed: Shaw, Pirandello, Sophocles—writers I now too rarely get to see. My favorite place in the world was then a doorway at the back of the main-stage theatre, where you could slip in and watch the proceedings. One of the triumphs of that era was Andrei Belgrader&#39;s Rabelaisian “Ubu Rock,” in which Thomas Derrah sang a deliberately infuriating song. This “Button Song”—“My jacket has one button, one button”—goes on and on, à la “99 Bottles of Beer,” until the audience begins to jeer and fling things. A group of us would sneak in to see it every night, secure in the erroneous belief that no one would notice a line of scruffy undergrads lurking in plain view.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;hurm9d&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;uebexw&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Brustein, hearing my positive review on the Harvard panel, became both a friend and a mentor, which later led to my returning to the theatre&#39;s Institute for Advanced Theatre Training, and graduating in his final cohort in 2002. When he was retiring, I helped assemble a scrapbook of memories, which was presented to him at a ceremony. I still have the e-mail from F. Murray Abraham. “There is a line from the 23rd psalm that perfectly describes Robert Brustein for me: he restoreth my soul.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Brustein was immensely impressive. I don&#39;t mean that he was imperious—my main image of him is of a tall, slow loris, ambling around amiably, popping his head in every room—nor that he was regal, since he had a twinkly, just-about-to-pratfall affect. I mean instead that he made deep impressions on those who worked with and around him. I am a child of his mind: I see his stamp on my taste, but also my choice of career. Brustein made it seem like the most natural thing in the world to be a critic, and a surprising number of people who stood in that upstairs Loeb doorway went on to write about theatre.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Gideon Lester, another of Brustein&#39;s protégées, was in the literary department when I was there. He&#39;s now the artistic director at the Fisher Center at Bard. Lester follows the Brustein spirit of directorial empowerment (for example, the adventurous Daniel Fish version of “Oklahoma!”)—but not the letter of his anti-commercial law. (That same show went to Broadway.) Lester thinks that there&#39;s some special alchemy in the way Brustein was simultaneously an avuncular, loving figure and a bare-knuckle scrapper. “It takes real guts to run an institution which is, in certain circles, profoundly unpopular,” says Lester. “I remember, in my first years in Cambridge, going to dinner parties, meeting people, and they would say, &#39;Oh, you work at ART? I &lt;em>;hate&lt;/em>; that place.&#39; Nobody felt neutral about it.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Not feeling neutral about any of it—that was Brustein&#39;s way. He was a lion in a lost pride of critics—Eric Bentley, Harold Clurman, Richard Gilman—who had confidence in the theatre as a form and in their own ability to influence it. “It&#39;s the (critic&#39;s) job not to just look at theatre but to look after it,” Lahr said. These popular, widely read critics reviewed shows and wrote books of theory, but they also built institutions, made translations of international works, and stimulated a passionate national discussion. What we have now is close to the opposite of a thriving theatre scene—one where no one is shouting, or, if they are, they&#39;re only shouting into echo chambers. For seventy years, though, Brustein was a kind of warrior. Like those French knights in “Henry V,” he buckled on his armor, and rode into battle until—and this breaks my heart—he was playing an army all by himself. ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;2a7w1b&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 02 Nov 2023 03:06:02 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
