data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;最近在 X（以前称为 Twitter 的平台）上，我的时间轴上充满了围绕同样几个内容的乏味帖子像水漩涡流入下水道这样的话题。例如，上周，讨论主要是关于&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/sports/sporting-scene/kelce-swift-is-a-dream-pairing-for-the- nfl&quot;>;泰勒·斯威夫特与足球运动员特拉维斯·凯尔斯的恋情&lt;/a>;。如果你试图谈论其他任何事情，平台的算法反馈似乎会让你变得无关紧要。为埃隆·马斯克（Elon Musk）的蓝支票验证系统付费的用户现在主导了该平台，通常带有极右翼评论和彻头彻尾的虚假信息；马斯克根据这些用户的帖子所带来的参与度来奖励他们，无论其真实性如何。假新闻和 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/elon-musk-twitter-war-gaza-b2426241.html &quot;>;与哈马斯袭击以色列有关的标签错误的视频&lt;/a>;。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;在线其他地方，情况同样黯淡。 Instagram 的推送推送的是几个月前的帖子和产品广告，而不是朋友的照片。 Google 搜索充斥着垃圾结果，SEO 黑客已经破坏了 &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://twitter.com/Austen/status/1708530123610468854&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&quot;element&quot;: “ExternalLink”、“outgoingURL”：“https://twitter.com/Austen/status/1708530123610468854”}&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Austen/status/1708530123610468854&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener “ target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;将“Reddit”添加到搜索中以查找人工生成的答案的技巧&lt;/a>;。与此同时，Facebook 的母公司 Meta 在其最新的相关性竞标中，据报道正在开发具有各种“时髦”个性的人工智能聊天机器人将被添加到其应用程序中，其中包括角色扮演 D. &amp;amp; 机器人。 D. 基于史努比狗狗的地下城主。与这样的角色互动的前景听起来就像与垃圾邮件机器人发短信一样有吸引力，后者会询问您是否有正确的号码。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;我们所知道的社交媒体网络，是一个我们消耗了人类同胞的帖子并发布了回报，似乎已经结束了。 X 的急剧衰落是互联网新时代的风向标，它让人感觉没有以前那么有趣了。还记得上网的乐趣吗？这意味着偶然发现一个你从未想象过的网站，收到一个你从未见过的模因，并被重复了十几次，甚至可能在你的浏览器中玩一个小视频游戏。这些体验现在似乎不像十年前那么容易获得。在很大程度上，这是因为少数大型社交网络已经占据了互联网的开放空间，通过它们自己的不透明和不断变化的内容分类系统来集中和同质化我们的体验。当这些平台衰落时，正如 Twitter 在&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/08/28/elon-musks-shadow-rule&quot;>;埃隆·马斯克&lt;/a>;下所做的那样，就会有生态系统中没有其他类似的平台可以替代它们。包括 Bluesky 和 ​​Discord 在内的一些替代网站已试图吸收心怀不满的 Twitter 用户。但就像热带雨林地面上的芽苗被树冠遮挡一样，提供新鲜体验的在线空间缺乏很大的成长空间。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;一位 Twitter 朋友告诉我，关于该平台目前的状况，“我已经实际上为此经历了很多悲伤。”对一个用户习惯性称为“地狱网站”的网站感到如此渴望似乎很奇怪。但我从许多其他人那里听到了同样的说法，尽管 Twitter 有其种种缺点，但他们曾经认为 Twitter 是一个至关重要的社会景观。他们中的一些人仍然定期发推文，但他们的消息不太可能出现在我的 Swift 密集源中。马斯克 &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://twitter.com/sarafischer/status/1709250682211987518&quot;

rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;最近发推文&lt;/a>;该公司的算法“试图优化在 X 上花费的时间”，例如，通过增加回复链并淡化可能使人们离开该平台的链接。新范式有利于科技行业的“话题达人”、“你最喜欢的漫威电影是什么”的提示帖子，以及像德里克·盖伊（Derek Guy）这样不断发布有关男装的推文的单一主题评论员。算法推荐让已经很受欢迎的账户和主题变得更加流行，将那些更小、更喜鹊的声音拒之门外，正是这些声音让旧版 Twitter 成为了如此活跃的目的地。 （与此同时，盖伊在马斯克的领导下获得了如此多的算法提升，以至于他积累了超过 50 万粉丝。）&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;今天的互联网感觉更空虚，就像一条回声走廊，尽管它充满了更多内容比以往任何时候。它也让人感觉不那么随意地提供信息。 Twitter 在其全盛时期是实时信息的来源，是第一个捕捉事态发展风声的地方，后来才在媒体上报道。博客文章和电视新闻频道汇总推文以展示流行的文化趋势或辩论。如今，他们对 TikTok 帖子做了同样的事情——看到许多关于危险且可能是虚假的本地新闻报道“&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.wsoctv.com/news/local/teens-may- be-running-away-home-get-likes-tiktok-trend-deputies-say/DRJTW73PDRACHNU5PHTW2L7P7A/&quot;

aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt; /div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;如今，在社交媒体上发帖可能也不再是一种随意的行为，因为我们已经看到了现实生活和数字生活之间界限模糊的后果。 Instagram 迎来了在线自我商品化的时代——它是自拍的平台——但 TikTok 和 Twitch 加速了这一时代。自拍已经不够了；基于视频的平台可以展示您的身体、您的言语和举止以及您所在的房间，甚至可能是实时的。每个人都被迫扮演有影响力的角色。进入壁垒更高，顺应压力也更大。毫不奇怪，在这种环境下，冒险发帖的人越来越少，而更多的人成为被动消费者。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;银幕之外的生活模式也会影响数字世界的构成。在网上享受乐趣是我们在办公室闲暇时做的事情：整天坐在电脑前，我们必须在屏幕上找到一些东西来打发空闲时间。早期的 Awl 和 Gawker 等博客似乎是为漫无目的的互联网冲浪而设计的，提供断断续续的八卦、有趣的视频以及由具有古怪和个性化品味的编辑策划的个人文章。 （2017 年锥子关闭时，Jia Tolentino &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-comment/the-end-of-the-awl-and-the-vanishing-of- Freedom-and-fun-from-the internet&quot;>;对“在线自由和乐趣”的消亡表示遗憾。）现在，在大流行之后，在持续的在家工作政策下，办公室工作人员较少受电脑束缚，因此可能不太愿意在社交媒体上追逐点赞。他们可以离开办公桌去照顾孩子、遛狗或者把要洗的衣服放进去。这可能对个人产生有益的影响，但这意味着更少的沉迷于互联网的人会疯狂地为其他人创建帖子。我们来消费。过去几年，社交平台的用户增速整体放缓；根据 &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.insiderintelligence.com/insights/social-media-forecasts-worldwide&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot; ;outgoingURL”：“https://www.insiderintelligence.com/insights/social-media-forecasts-worldwide”}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.insiderintelligence.com/insights/social-media-forecasts-worldwide &quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;据估计&lt;/a>;，到 2023 年将降至 2.4%。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;上一代博客曾经承担聚合新闻和内容的任务。来自互联网的故事。有一段时间，社交媒体似乎可以实现同样的功能。现在很明显，科技公司对引导用户访问其提要之外的内容兴趣不大。根据 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.axios.com/2023/06/27/social-media-news-conspiration-slows-globally&quot;>;Axios&lt;/a>;，顶级新闻和媒体网站已经看到过去三年，来自社交媒体的“有机推荐”下降了一半以上。截至上周，X 不再显示用户链接到的文章的标题。推荐流量的下降扰乱了媒体商业模式，进一步降低了在线原创内容的质量。廉价、即时的人工智能生成内容的激增将使问题变得更糟。&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height :auto&quot;

data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Choire Sicha，Awl 联合创始人，现任纽约编辑&lt;em>;&lt;/em >;，告诉我他将社交媒体退化的根源追溯到十年前。 “如果我有一台时光机，我会回到 2014 年暗杀，”他说。那一年出现了“玩家门”(Gamergate) 等病毒现象，一群心怀不满的电子游戏粉丝在社交媒体上针对记者和游戏开发商；艾伦·德杰尼勒斯在奥斯卡颁奖典礼上与一群名人的自拍照，被转发了数百万次；亚历克斯是一名来自德克萨斯州的青少年零售工人，因其邻家男孩般的外表而赢得了关注。在这些事件中，我们可以看到一些新生力量将在随后的几年中得到巩固：最响亮声音的暴政；在新平台上巩固传统声誉；被最疯狂地分享和推广的内容迫在眉睫的空虚。但在那时，它们似乎仍然是例外，而不是规则。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;我一直在努力回忆那些不受匿名恶意攻击、自动推荐或失控的货币化方案阻碍的网上乐趣时光。很久以前，社交网络还没有成为互联网的主要高速公路。我想到的是一个名为 Orisinal 的网站，该网站托管用 Flash 制作的游戏，Flash 是一种晚期的交互式动画软件，在每个人都开始在同一平台内容漏洞中发布内容之前，它构成了两千个庸俗互联网的重要组成部分。该网站上的游戏卡通、可爱、色彩柔和，包括控制兔子在星星上跳上天空或帮助老鼠泡一杯茶等活动。 Orisinal 可供任何人偶然发现，而不会受到关注者数量或赞助内容的干扰。您可以通过电子邮件将该网站发送给朋友，但除此之外就没有什么可分享的。旧版本的互联网仍然存在，但它已经被社交网络所激励的参与模式所掩盖。最近，我通过 Reddit 找到了 Orisinal 所有游戏的模拟器，并很快就迷上了一款涉及协助鹿跳过林地间隙的游戏。我唯一的奖励是个人高分。但这比这些天在 X 上的经历更令人满意，也更少孤独。 ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data -node-id=&quot;zy0oqb&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot;

rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;巴德尔行动&lt;/a>;，先知穆罕默德在七世纪取得第一次军事胜利后，叙利亚和埃及从两条相反的战线入侵以色列。 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/wendell-steavenson/egypt-remembering-the-6th-of-october&quot;>;赎罪日战争&lt;/a>;持续了近三周。阿拉伯人在军事上失败了，但相信他们在心理和政治上取得了胜利，迫使以色列认识到自己很脆弱，最终不得不与敌人讲和。五十年后，与叙利亚和埃及军队相比，哈马斯只是三流民兵，更不用说与以色列精良的军队和武库相比了。然而，本周末爆发的冲突让人感觉更加不祥。 “强大的离心力已经被释放，改写了整个地区的规则，”外交关系委员会反恐高级研究员布鲁斯·霍夫曼告诉我。霍夫曼说，与前几十年的对抗以死亡、破坏和谈判停火为模式不同，这场战争“完全不可预测”。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;即使以色列取得决定性的军事胜利，也不太可能结束该国日益危险的局面。安全挑战。甚至不清楚“获胜”意味着什么。 “毫无疑问，以色列可以对加沙的基础设施和人民造成巨大损害，并且还可以针对哈马斯领导人，”前美国驻以色列大使丹·库尔泽告诉我。但运动重新兴起，“有时下一任领导层会比被斩首的领导层更激进、更极端，”库尔策说。伊拉克的&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tag/al-qaeda&quot;>;基地组织&lt;/a>;，例如，&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://countererroristanceethics.tudelft .nl/terrorist-group-isis/#:~:text=虽然%20the%20Islamic%20State%20发现，哈里发%2C%20Abu%20Bakr%20al%20Baghdadi。&quot;

2013年。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;哈马斯已经实现了其恐吓以色列人和震惊这个长期以来在该地区几乎不可战胜的国家的一些目标。 “如果战争今天停止，或者即使加沙看起来像另一个战区，哈马斯实际上已经赢了，”库尔泽告诉我。他们的近期目标“已经实现或可以实现”。至少就目前而言，这场冲突几乎肯定会破坏美国为促成沙特阿拉伯和以色列之间正式和解而进行的外交努力，而这是以色列获得长期对手承认的关键一步。周末，沙特阿拉伯 &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.arabnews.com/node/2386901/middle-east&quot;

伊斯兰革命卫队为这次袭击开了绿灯。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;德黑兰长期以来一直是哈马斯武器、财政援助和军事训练的主要来源，这毫不掩饰与哈马斯的联盟关系。加沙哈马斯领导人叶海亚·辛瓦尔 (Yahya Sinwar) 在 2021 年以色列和哈马斯之间的最后一次重大战争后发表讲话时表示，“所有的感谢都归功于伊朗伊斯兰共和国多年来对我们并不吝啬。 ”美国已制裁了四百多名向哈马斯提供支持的伊朗个人和公司。霍夫曼说，中东地区爆发更广泛战争的可能性可能是“剧烈的”。&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;现在的紧张局势是显而易见的。周六，当哈马斯武装分子在以色列南部横行时，总统乔·拜登发出警告：“现在不是任何敌视以色列的政党利用这些袭击谋取利益的时刻。”周末，政府在与盟友的对话中强化了这一信息，当然希望他们能向伊朗及其在黎巴嫩、叙利亚和伊拉克的装备精良的代理人强调这一点。周日，五角大楼命令一个航母编队前往该地区。中央司令部司令迈克尔·库里拉将军表示，伊朗还宣布了“扩大”美国战机中队的计划，“以应对任何一方寻求扩大冲突的风险”。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;伊朗已表达了强烈支持哈马斯自战争开始以来。周末，总统易卜拉欣·莱西 &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://en.mehrnews.com/news/206885/Raeisi-holds-phone-calls-with-Islamic-Jihad-Hamas-chiefs&quot;

aria-hidden=&quot; true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;像过去一样，暂时停火的前景似乎很遥远。霍夫曼说，哈马斯现在似乎全力以赴&lt;a href=&quot;https://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_ century/hamas.asp&quot;>;盟约&lt;/a>;消灭以色列。然而，库尔泽指出，哈马斯在政治上和实体上也是支离破碎的。它在加沙有一个顽固的军事派别，在黎巴嫩的巴勒斯坦难民营有一个侨民领导层，在卡塔尔有政治领导人。 “我不知道哈马斯是什么，”他告诉我。他补充说，其驻多哈的代表与外界接触，但“那些毕生挖掘隧道、用电线杆制造武器，然后将它们与从伊朗和其他地方走私进来的任何东西结合在一起的人呢？这些家伙，他们想要战斗。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;具有讽刺意味的是，以色列对哈马斯的早期发展负有责任。库尔泽说，在八十年代中期，它支持新生伊斯兰组织的联合，作为巴解组织的替代方案，“因为它们是宗教性的，而不是民族主义的”。回顾过去，以色列也忽视了乌合之众民兵挑战强国的地区趋势。库尔泽指出，圣战者在阿富汗与苏联对抗，真主党在黎巴嫩与以色列对抗。 （两支民兵都获胜了。）2006 年，美国坚持进行民主选举，以巩固愿意支持与以色列达成和平协议的巴勒斯坦政府，从而为哈马斯的政治崛起做出了贡献。哈马斯赢得了议会多数席位。它最终从愿意与以色列进行外交接触的法塔赫手中夺取了对加沙的控制权。这将巴勒斯坦政府分裂为约旦河西岸和加沙两部分，并实际上注定了和平进程的失败。选举结束后，时任国务卿康多莉扎·赖斯沉思道：“当然，我问过为什么没有人预见到它的到来，我希望我们认真审视一下，因为它确实说明了可能没有足够好的脉搏对巴勒斯坦人民的影响。”今天，这句话再次令人难以忘怀。 ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot;

>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;英国电影制片人特伦斯·戴维斯去世的消息令人特别痛苦周六，他七十七岁了：他的职业生涯充满了过去四十年来一些最伟大的电影，但似乎总是刚刚开始，而直到最后，他都保持着青春的旺盛气度。当他拍摄第一部长片时，他已经四十多岁了，“&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/goings-on-about-town/movies/distant-voices-still-lives&quot;>;遥远的声音，仍然《生命》（1988）——所有处女作中最具原创性的一部——但他只拍了八部，不是因为他工作缓慢，而是因为钱来得太慢。尽管戴维斯是最有成就的电影制作人之一，但他仍然是一个永远的初学者，总是处于突破的边缘，但从未完全实现。他到了晚年，拍的电影太少了——这是电影史上的一个严重损失——但年轻人的热情、紧迫感和好奇心丝毫没有减弱。他从未拍过“迟到”的电影；他的作品没有表现出超然的哲学概述或超越。 The paradoxes and complexities of his character run through his output and his life—and they were also very much on the surface, on public display.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I had the honor and the pleasure of meeting Davies on several occasions (including onstage, in 2016, at The New Yorker Festival). In person, he was hearty and vigorous, wryly and effervescently humorous, a trait that spilled over into his cinematic taste: he expressed unflagging enthusiasm for classic Hollywood musicals at every chance he got, whether &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/terence-davies-here-and-now&quot;>;in front of an audience at &lt;em >;MOMA&lt;/em>;&lt;/a>;, about a decade ago, or in his ballot for the 2022 &lt;em>;Sight and Sound&lt;/em>; poll. Yet his own films were marked by a keen sense of ambient tragedy and often scarred by the horrors of war. The American experience of the Second World War shapes “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-front-row/weekend-streaming-the-neon-bible-a-coming-of-age-tale-set-amid-music-and-horror&quot;>;The Neon Bible&lt;/a>;,” and the British experience of it shapes “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/what-to-see-this-weekend-the-deep-blue-sea-and-more&quot;>;The Deep Blue Sea&lt;/a>;.” (A scene of Londoners seeking shelter in an Underground station during a German bombing raid is one of his most spectacular creations.) The Civil War is an important part of his Emily Dickinson bio-pic “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/terence-daviess-truthful-fictions-about-emily-dickinson&quot;>;A Quiet Passion&lt;/a>;,” and the First World War is decisive in “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/02/22/terence-daviess-sunset-song&quot;>;Sunset Song&lt;/a>;.” It is also the very heart of his last film, “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-front-row/benediction-reviewed-the-bio-pic-as-radical-melodrama&quot;>;Benediction&lt;/a>;,” a bio-pic about the poet Siegfried Sassoon.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Davies was one of the prime historical filmmakers, never making a dramatic feature set in the present day. But his sense of history wasn&#39;t staid or academic; it was intensely personal. Having started late—he worked an office job for a dozen years before attending drama school and beginning to make movies—he unleashed a backlog of pent-up experience and emotion in his first two features, “Distant Voices, Still Lives” and “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/goings-on-about-town/movies/the-long-day-closes&quot;>;The Long Day Closes&lt;/a>;” (1992), two of the most passionate and formally original autobiographical childhood dramas. Both are set in his home town of Liverpool, in families that, like his own, are Catholic. The first shows a young boy enduring paternal brutality; the second shows an older boy nicknamed (like Davies) Bud, in adolescence, experiencing bullying and trying (again, like Davies) to reconcile the realization of his homosexuality with harsh Church doctrine. For all their severity, both movies are musicals—musical tragedies, as are most of Davies&#39;s films—and his innovative way of filming music is integral to his dramatic artistry. The boy&#39;s family circle, the friends and neighbors who gather at his house and at the pub, musicalize the movies with their a cappella renditions of popular ballads, jukebox hits, and gems from the Great American Songbook. In “The Long Day Closes,” the maturing Bud has become a denizen of the movie theatre, where he experiences the exhilarations of Hollywood musicals and also the power of Hollywood tragedy—including in Orson Welles&#39;s masterwork of the ravages of time and history, “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/goings-on-about-town/movies/magnificent-ambersons&quot;>;The Magnificent Ambersons&lt;/a>;.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;The world that surrounds Davies&#39;s alter ego in both films—the music and movies, the fashions, the manners, the joys and heartbreaks—is his aesthetic education, and this apprenticeship in style and soulfulness comes largely from women of grand character in constraining circumstances. The five features that followed these first two all revolved around free-spirited women, heroines whose audacity caused scandal and got them into trouble but also graced their worlds with an evanescent beauty that Davies indelibly enshrined. Four of them—“The Neon Bible” (1995), “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/goings-on-about-town/movies/the-house-of-mirth&quot;>;The House of Mirth&lt;/a>;” (2000), “The Deep Blue Sea” (2011), and “Sunset Song” (2015)—were literary adaptations, and the last and most exalted of them, “A Quiet Passion,” from 2016, was an agonized yet comic bio-pic of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2008/08/04/her-own-society&quot;>;Emily Dickinson&lt;/a>;, a sort of screwball tragedy, which Davies called his “most autobiographical” film. (Dickinson&#39;s poetry itself, recited on the soundtrack, also functions as a sort of verbal score, a culmination of Davies&#39;s ever more daring ways to film music.)&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Davies was the great cinematic poet of memory, and thus of loss and regret. He didn&#39;t live in the past, but, rather, the past—personal, social, artistic—lived in him. The outward differences of former times mattered little to Davies. He experienced his characters&#39; passions in the present tense and filmed them with immediacy, intensity, and a sense of style that is central to his artistry. Costumes and décor were exquisitely expressive, and he was fervently attentive to actors&#39; diction and gesture. Above all, Davies&#39;s cinematic inventiveness fused meticulously detailed recreations of the past with breathtaking flourishes of brazen artifice. (It&#39;s because of this sense of style, and his intense identification with the heroine of “The House of Mirth,” that I prize his Edith Wharton adaptation over Martin Scorsese&#39;s “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/goings-on-about-town/movies/the-age-of-innocence&quot;>;The Age of Innocence&lt;/a>;.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Unmoored, by the power of his imaginative sympathy, from the mere incidentals of the present tense, Davies was impatient with the clamorous demands of the current day, and his indifference to modern fashions and trends jeopardized his career. In 2008, after years of frustration trying to get financing for dramas, he made a personal documentary, “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/goings-on-about-town/movies/of-time-and-the-city-2&quot;>;Of Time and the City&lt;/a>;,” about Liverpool, the home town that, as he says, he&#39;d not only left but also lost. He decries the changes that the city has endured—the collapse of industry, urban transformations, and the resulting end to the tight community life that he&#39;d depicted in his first features. (There is also a well-aimed barb at the city&#39;s most famous musical export.) Davies laments the spirit of modernity as hollow, not least, because he was hardly a beneficiary of it.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Davies left the Catholic Church, but its strictures continued to shape his life as a gay man. Afflicted with an enduring sense of fear, shame, and guilt, he remained mostly celibate, he said, and this experience informed the feature that turned out to be his last, his Sassoon bio-pic, “Benediction.” In the First World War, the protagonist finds his literary voice and both gains and loses the love of his life, the poet Wilfred Owen. After a string of reckless same-sex relationships, he seeks an escape from despair in traditional marriage and family, but his life becomes loveless and embittered, prompting a late conversion to Catholicism. Turning away from the diminished realities of his later years, he grows ever more deeply absorbed in the past, and his aestheticized inner reanimation of his best, lost times is realized in the movie&#39;s final scene, as an overwhelming, music-drenched cinematic experience. This wasn&#39;t meant to be Davies&#39;s last movie; he was ready to shoot an adaptation of Stefan Zweig&#39;s “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Post-Office-Girl-Review-Books-Classics/dp/1590172620&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Post-Office-Girl-Review-Books-Classics/dp/1590172620&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Post-Office-Girl-Review-Books-Classics/dp/1590172620&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;The Post-Office Girl&lt;/a>;,” but the funding didn&#39;t come through. Nonetheless, it&#39;s a spectacular and fitting ending to the career of the greatest of all British filmmakers. ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot;

aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt; /div>;&lt;div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;麦考利主持了这个训练营，布拉德利是特邀嘉宾。麦考利还曾在圣路易斯老鹰队担任明星中锋，并曾入选圣路易斯大学全美最佳阵容。他被称为“Easy Ed”，因为他刚上场的时候。当他的队友们进行快攻时，他几乎在步行中落后于他们。艾斯艾德身高六英尺八英寸，比尔六英尺五英寸。十九年后，我陪同比尔前往新泽西州海边高地的木板路进行竞选访问，在那里，他在一块写着“&lt;em>;认识参议员布拉德利&lt;/em>;”的牌子后面逆流而上。他遇到的一位潜在选民说：“伙计，你高吗？当你为尼克斯队效力时，你看起来很小。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“当我为尼克斯队效力时，我&lt;em>;很小&lt;/em>;，”参议员说。足够正确了。他是小前锋。现在，1964 年，在密苏里州的唐博斯科营地，我与比尔·布拉德利和埃德·麦考利一起走在一条土路上。道路由深深的平行车辙组成，中间有一个长满草的驼峰。布拉德利是一种惯例，麦考利是另一种，而我则处于他们之间的驼峰上。我比大多数人都小——大约和安德鲁·卡内基、詹姆斯·麦迪逊、弗拉基米尔·普京、约瑟夫·斯大林和拿破仑·波拿巴一样小。事实上，我的巅峰身高是五英尺七英寸，最近已经凝缩了。驼峰比车辙高一英尺。尽管如此，我们三个人的轮廓还是形成了字母 M。&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;比尔在大四的早期度过了东京，获得金牌。普林斯顿大学的其他人也在那里——莱斯利·布什 (Lesley Bush)，一名跳台跳水员，在普林斯顿高中读四年级；杰德·格雷夫（Jed Graef），一名仰泳运动员，刚从大学毕业；我的父亲是美国队的主治医生。所有三名运动员都是金牌得主。还有日元问题。如果运动员想观看自己运动以外的比赛，则必须付费才能观看。杰德想看篮球比赛。比尔找到了一个备用装备包，添加了一些服装装饰，然后将杰德作为美国队的一员带入了竞技场。故事讲到这里，我情不自禁地回到了 2003 年，当时杰德的女儿达娜是我在普林斯顿写作班的二年级学生。她的一篇文章是关于她在纽约西部的童年的。她的母亲是一位佛教僧人。达纳在文章中说道：&lt;/p>;&lt;blockquote >;&lt;div >;&lt;p>;我常年在雪地里玩耍，从邻居的院子里砍郁金香，偷饼干。我在复活节吃薄饼，在光明节吃马铃薯饼，几乎每天都吃巧克力。当我想让客人留下来时，我就把他们的钥匙藏起来，然后骑在父亲的肩膀上从幼儿园回家。我穿了一件白色蕾丝连衣裙参加我母亲的任命仪式，一件灰色缎面连衣裙参加她的认可，一件绿色连衣裙参加我父亲进入游泳名人堂的就职典礼。&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/blockquote>;&lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;qy78h&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/ div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;比尔·布拉德利 (Bill Bradley) 年轻时，他的母亲给他报名了参加足够的游泳课程来提高蓝鳍金枪鱼的水平。她是一名运动员，一名高尔夫俱乐部冠军。比尔从来没有打过高尔夫球。网球课程既不会产生过顶球，也不会产生反手击球。但他作为游泳运动员的能力给他留下了深刻的印象。在十九世纪七十年代的七年里，我们一家人在新罕布什尔州北部湖边的一所房子里度过了七月。事实上，我们是两个合并的家庭，有很多孩子，但我们有足够的独木舟和兰奇利船可以四处走动。当比尔和他的妻子欧内斯汀第一次拜访我们时，比尔走下码头，登上了独木舟。他选择了一个离独木舟一端很近的地方。另一端冲向空中，指向天空，而比尔的一端则刺入了湖中，而他也在湖中。我从来没有听他提到过划独木舟课程。那是他在尼克斯队的十年中期。第二年夏天，他一抵达就宣布美国广播公司的“超级巨星”节目邀请他与其他职业运动员一起前往佛罗里达州，参加除他们自己的体育项目之外的各种体育项目的比赛。比尔将作为一名游泳运动员参加比赛。所以他想利用我们的湖来准备在电视上比赛。我小时候只在夏令营参加过游泳比赛，但十年来我没有输过一场比赛。不管它是否值得，我在大学时代的夏天也曾担任美国红十字会水上安全教练。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;我指着距离码头四十或五十码的潜水筏。我说我很乐意帮助他进行电视训练，并会陪他从码头到木筏。他脸上的表情并不完全是轻蔑的，而是一种蔑视。如果将其称为傻笑，就可以解释了。有一些这样的事情，但主要是他在隐藏乐趣，并尽力不侮辱人，甚至不显得放纵。但很明显，他认为我的提议很荒谬。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;三，二，一，开始！当比尔到达木筏时，我正在那里等他。我们在湖边房子的门廊上有一部电话。比尔游回码头，爬了出来，走到滴水的电话旁，按了一堆按钮，接通了美国广播公司的电话，然后取消了去佛罗里达的旅行。&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;事实上，他是在演戏，假装给佛罗里达打了电话。他与美国广播公司或其他任何地方的任何人都没有联系。他身上的小丑色彩比大多数人有机会辨别的还要多。他去了佛罗里达，他参加了节目，并且赢得了一些东西。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;游泳比赛是不可想象的，而且是在十年后&lt;em>;&lt;/em>;&lt;em>;纽约客&lt;/ em>; 发表了我的比尔·布拉德利简介。我参与这个过程是在 William Shawn 的办公室，他在那里有检查校样、校对校样和所有其他类型的校样，包括他自己的，但他在逐条提出并讨论它们时没有向我展示这些校样。与我一起。 &lt;em>;《纽约客》的标准&lt;/em>;是作者满意，而我第一次沉浸在这个标准中。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;正如我在2017年的书《第四稿》中所写的那样”:&lt;/p>;&lt;blockquote >;&lt;div >;&lt;p>;肖恩自己编辑了这篇文章，就像他经常对长篇事实的新作家所做的那样，可以这么说，将它们打入其中，但并不完全像一匹马，更像是一匹马。棒球手套。在新闻发布会前一周左右的时间里，我们每天都会见面，从一个逗号到另一个逗号，再用一个分号进行额外的节拍。 。 。 。肖恩先生时不时地会说出一些对一个焦躁不安、更不用说神经质、不自信的作家来说最鼓舞人心的话。他有很多练习。&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/blockquote>;&lt;p>;他让我在他面前感到完全自在，如此自在，以至于当&lt;em>;普林斯顿日报&lt;/em>;发表其年度报告时《纽约客》发表《布拉德利简介》两天后的《笑话特刊》，我把《笑话特刊》的副本带到西四十三街给肖恩先生看。一个大而粗体的标题说：&lt;/p>;&lt;blockquote >;&lt;div >;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;align-center&quot;

/em>; 在我的前两篇个人资料之后，肖恩先生将我指派给了事实编辑。宾汉姆在我五十多岁时去世之前，担任了我的编辑十六年。他让我的信心跨越了重重障碍，他对待我的手稿就好像它们是我的一样，时不时地从我写的热狗行中抬起头来，说：“威利斯不滚。”&lt;/p>;&lt;与此同时，比尔在尼克斯队的开局缓慢、令人沮丧，没有得到太多的比赛时间，甚至在麦迪逊广场花园因为不合理的高期望而受到嘘声，更不用说他的体型大小引发了广泛的怀疑。签约奖金，为此他被赋予了“美元钞票”的绰号。我从大学一年级起就很钦佩他，也很欣赏他，他将成为我永远的朋友，但没有哪个时代比他努力奋斗的时候更能评价他了。尼克斯队，每场比赛打三分钟，或者类似的事情，肯定会感受到他从未经历过的抑郁症的威胁。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;在花园里打完篮球后，他会去晚餐和篮球都没有跟他一起去。我一直认为，他最好的资产是他能够将生活中的各种因素区分开来，并且永远不会让他对一件事的注意力转移到其他事情上。当他与各种各样的人共进晚餐时，他总是谈论与他的工作无关的话题。他过去是这样，现在也是这样。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;到了1969年2月，他的情况好多了。当尼克斯队出现在密尔沃基对阵雄鹿队时，我碰巧就在附近，在伊利诺伊州森林湖学院担任驻校作家一周。我去看比赛了。尼克斯队赢了。比尔打了一场出色的比赛，赛后一名男子拿着麦克风询问他对比赛最简洁的分析。进入这种陈词滥调的遭遇，比尔拿起麦克风分析了这个动作，然后重新分析了这个动作，并进行了第三次和第四次分析，并且不打算还给麦克风。他转移话题，滔滔不绝，直到电视控制室按下了开关。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;那年平安夜，纽约一家电影院，电影不间断地放映到深夜。比尔和我一起熬夜，看罗伯特·雷德福的《速降赛车》。 Since early summer, my wife and I had been separated, and therefore came Christmas without my daughters. Apart from a family death, if there is a lower moment in a physically healthy life I can&#39;t imagine it.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The Knicks&#39; season was in full flow. They beat the Detroit Pistons 112–111 that Christmas Day and lost to the Lakers the following night. They would see more of the Lakers and the Lakers would see more of them. The Lakers were Wilt Chamberlain. The Knicks were Dave DeBusschere, Bradley, Barnett, Frazier, and Captain Willis Reed. They were on a roll (but not that one). In June, they beat the Lakers in the NBA finals. It was the Knicks&#39; first championship. They won their second, also against the Lakers, in 1973, and at this writing the Knicks have yet to win another.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;His political ruminations notwithstanding, Bill thought about other futures, other professions, and one of these was photography. He bought a Nikon with multiple lenses and went at the challenge with the same dedication he had given to no-look passes and peripheral vision. One of his first artistic themes was life on the road, life on the run, the quotidian experience of a professional athlete, forever in airplanes, in unfamiliar cities, checking into and out of hotels. One example of this genre is on display in a fishing cabin owned by me and my family on the upper Delaware River. Made in Los Angeles, the picture is a point-blank view of a hotel under construction, shot from a room in a neighboring hotel so close that the picture shows no roofline or other defining edges, just twenty half-finished hotel rooms, full of building materials, and looking like a grotesque checkerboard, the itinerant athlete&#39;s total view. DeBusschere, Bill&#39;s roommate on the road, slept through most of that.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Fifty-eight years ago, I took an outdoor picture of Bill with our garage in the background. He was twenty-two. In more recent years, he has used that photograph in two of his books and in a long video he describes as “a performative autobiography.” In professional compensation, I have yet to see one red cent, let alone a dollar bill.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Bill had been a Knick for seven years when West Germany and the Netherlands reached the finals of the World Cup, in Munich. Bill was married now, and his wife—as smart a person as I have ever met, apart from nuclear scientists and geophysicists—had grown up Ernestine Misslbeck, in Ingolstadt, Bavaria, fifty miles from Munich. The Misslbecks wanted to attend the Cup final, a tough ticket if ever there was one. The match would occur on the seventh of July. Could Bill do something for his in-laws? He called the Milanese meatpacker he had played for when he was at Oxford. The company said it would obtain the tickets if Bill would fly to Italy and play one exhibition game for the meatpacker. He went.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;He was elected a US senator from New Jersey in 1978. His home was in Denville then, in Morris County. Earlier, when he had first planned to run for office in the state, I had sought and found a carpetbag, filled it up with New Jersey road maps, and given it to him. It hung on a peg high inside his front door for twenty years. It is now in the possession of Ernestine and Bill&#39;s daughter, Theresa Anne. She is my goddaughter. When Bill was in his early Senate days and had not yet bought a house in Washington, he borrowed the apartment of Carl Bernstein and Nora Ephron, who were somewhere else at the time. For a week or so, I was in Washington working on my geology project at the Smithsonian and at the US Geological Survey, nearby in Virginia. I stayed with Bill. Coming through the door, you faced a curvilinear wall with an Italian bicycle hanging on it like a work of art, which it was. It was worth more than a car. And it was not the most arresting sight there. The apartment was filled with Pat and Dick Nixon figurines, a Pat salt shaker with a Dick pepper shaker, Pat and Dick ceramics of every ilk, five years after Deep Throat and Woodward and Bernstein&#39;s reportage on Watergate.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;sb4tha&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Bill&#39;s new presence in the Senate gave rise to a trivia question that lasted for eighteen years around Princeton. People with nothing better to do entertained one another with this question: What Princeton basketball player became a Rhodes Scholar and later a United States senator? Answer: Paul Sarbanes, Princeton 1954. Sarbanes, from Maryland, served in the US Senate for thirty years, which included Bill Bradley&#39;s eighteen.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In 1970, on vacation in Maine, Bill began writing a book he called “Life on the Run.” His ten-year career in pro basketball was still not far from its beginning, but his theme was clear to him and was in part the theme expressed in the photograph he made in the Los Angeles hotel. Since my own first book had been about Bill, it was assumed by some that I had had a hand in Bill&#39;s first book. If you want to know the truth, he sent me the manuscript, asking me to vet it. I did, and wrote to him, saying, among other things, “Abandon the project, you&#39;ll embarrass yourself.” He still has the letter. He claims that—twenty years after “Life on the Run”—I suggested that he abandon the manuscript of his third book, “Time Present, Time Past.” He has also stored in his memory, and conceivably his alone, some magazine&#39;s list of “The 10 Best Sports Books of All Time.” “Life on the Run” was No. 4. “A Sense of Where You Are,” my book about him, No. 6. Not that it is relevant, but my book about him says, “He is everything his parents think he is.” Anybody with enough angst to destroy a rug while trying to write is a writer.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;When I was preparing this piece, Bill&#39;s daughter surprised me with a letter I had written to Bill fifty-eight years ago—a few days before he graduated from Princeton:&lt;/p>;&lt;blockquote >;&lt;div >;&lt;p>;We&#39;ve spent so much time talking together that I&#39;m going to miss it quite a bit. 。 。 。 There was always some sort of purpose, something to be accomplished . 。 。 but the thing I learned that impressed me most was that, although your discipline is justly celebrated, you know how to waste time every bit as much as I do, which means that you&#39;re a champion at it. For every hour in which something got done, two went out the window. The best two went out the window.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;At Drake&#39;s Corner Road, you will be missed by Laura, Sarah, and Jenny. 。 。 。 Martha will have to live down the disappointment of not having been old enough when you were here. Even the older children have no standards by which to judge you except what you&#39;re like when you&#39;re dealing with them, and all of them start acting as if Ringling Brothers is in town whenever you come up the driveway.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;. 。 。 I hope that you will be coming up the driveway for years and years. Come to think of it, that is what we&#39;re all going to miss most: the explosive sound of the tires biting into the red gravel; the after-burner cutting in when you reached the big poplar; and, as the car came into view, the impressionistic blur against the green of the trees; then, finally, the relieving sight of the arresting parachute opening out to the rear.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/blockquote>;&lt;p >;When Yolanda Whitman and I were married, fifty-plus years ago now, the mayor of Princeton officiated on the Princeton campus. We were five in all, and the two others—the witnesses—were my mother and Bill. He is the younger brother I never had, and I am the brother he never had. “Bro” is how he has signed his e-mails to me since soon after e-mail was introduced. ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>; &lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/ div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;div>;&lt;div>;&lt;div>;&lt;div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt; /div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 09 Oct 2023 19:06:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Jake Sullivan’s Trial by Combat]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/10/16/trial-by-combat]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-09T10:00:00.000Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/651dcf7d98d3cdbde1212c2e/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/231016_r43166.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;article >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attribute-verso-pattern=&quot;article-body&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;ArticlePageChunks&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;figure data-testid=&quot;IframeEmbed&quot; >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;IframeEmbedContainer&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;iframe height=&quot;90&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; sandbox=&quot;allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups&quot; title=&quot;Embedded Frame&quot; data-src=&quot;https://audm.herokuapp.com/player-embed?pub=newyorker&amp;amp;articleID=651d80ba6814f7b281e47dc0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay *;加密媒体*；剪贴板写入；自动播放;全屏; picture-in-picture&quot;>;&lt;/iframe>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;p >;On a Monday afternoon in August, when President Joe Biden was on vacation and the West Wing felt like a ghost town, his national-security adviser, Jake Sullivan, sat down to discuss America&#39;s involvement in the war in Ukraine. Sullivan had agreed to an interview “with trepidation,” as he had told me, but now, in the White House&#39;s Roosevelt Room, steps from the Oval Office, he seemed surprisingly relaxed for a congenital worrier. (“It&#39;s my job to worry,” he once told an interviewer. “So I worry about literally everything.”) When I asked about reports that, at a recent &lt;em >;NATO&lt;/em>; summit, he had been furious during negotiations over whether to issue Ukraine a formal “invitation” to join the Western alliance, he said, only half jokingly, “First of all, I&#39;m, like, the most rational human being on the planet.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;But, when it came to the subject of the war itself, and why Biden has staked so much on helping Ukraine fight it, Sullivan struck an unusually impassioned note. “As a child of the eighties and &#39;Rocky&#39; and &#39;Red Dawn,&#39; I believe in freedom fighters and I believe in righteous causes, and I believe the Ukrainians have one,” he said. “There are very few conflicts that I have seen—maybe none—in the post-Cold War era . 。 。 where there&#39;s such a clear good guy and bad guy. And we&#39;re on the side of the good guy, and we have to do a lot for that person.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;There&#39;s no question that the United States has done a lot: American assistance to Ukraine, totalling seventy-six billion dollars, with more than forty-three billion for security aid, is the largest such effort since the Second World War. In the aftermath of the February 24, 2022, Russian invasion, the US has delivered more than two thousand Stinger anti-aircraft missiles, more than ten thousand Javelin antitank weapons, and more than two million 155-millimetre artillery rounds. It has sent Patriot missiles for air defense and High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems—known as &lt;em >;HIMARS&lt;/em>;—to give Ukraine longer-range strike capability; sophisticated Ghost drones and small hand-launched Puma drones; Stryker armored personnel carriers, Bradley fighting vehicles, and M1A1 Abrams tanks.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Biden has framed the conflict in sweeping, nearly civilizational terms, vowing to stick with Ukraine for “as long as it takes” to defeat the invaders, who—despite an estimated hundred and twenty thousand dead and a hundred and eighty thousand injured—still hold nearly twenty per cent of the country&#39;s territory. But at nearly every stage the Administration has faced sharp questions about the nature and the durability of the US commitment. Beyond the inevitable tensions with Ukraine&#39;s President, Volodymyr Zelensky, there are jostling Washington bureaucracies, restive European allies, and a growing Trumpist faction in the Republican-controlled House of Representatives, which is opposed to the bipartisan congressional bills that have, up until now, funded the war. A vocal peace camp, meanwhile, is demanding negotiations with Vladimir Putin to end the conflict, even as Secretary of State Antony Blinken has said there is currently little prospect for “meaningful diplomacy.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The task of leading the White House through such treacherous politics has fallen to Sullivan, who, when he was appointed, at the age of forty-four, was the youngest national-security adviser since McGeorge Bundy held the job, during the Vietnam War. “It&#39;s really Jake,” Ivo Daalder, a former US Ambassador to &lt;em >;NATO&lt;/em>;, who has consulted regularly with the National Security Council since the Russian invasion, told me. “He&#39;s the quartermaster of the war—and everything else.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Sullivan is lean, with wispy blond hair, a tendency to blush bright red, and a workaholic intensity unusual even by Washington&#39;s standards. (One night a few months ago, Sullivan discovered an intruder who had broken into his home at around 3 &lt;em >;am&lt;/em>;, because he was still up working.) In his office, there is a chart—updated frequently—showing countries&#39; current stocks of ammunition that might go to Ukraine. This spring, during the battle of Bakhmut, he knew the status of the fighting down to the city block. He often speaks with his counterpart in Kyiv, Zelensky&#39;s chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, two or three times a week, and has taken charge of everything from lobbying South Korea for artillery shells to running an emergency operation to get Ukraine additional power generators. Earlier this year, when Germany balked at sending Leopard tanks to Ukraine, Sullivan spent days in intensive talks with the German national-security adviser to secure them; in exchange, the US agreed to provide M1A1 Abrams tanks, a move that the Pentagon had long opposed. The NSC, in other words, has gone operational, with Sullivan personally overseeing the effort while also doing the rest of his job, which, in recent months, has taken him to secret meetings with a top Chinese official in Vienna and Malta and to complicated negotiations in the Middle East.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;In contrast to the epic feuds between George W. Bush&#39;s Pentagon and the State Department over Iraq, or the vicious infighting in Donald Trump&#39;s turnover-ridden national-security team, the Biden White House&#39;s approach to the war has been notably drama-free. Disagreements among advisers, while at times robust and protracted, have barely surfaced in the press. Blinken, a confidant of Biden for more than two decades, has been perhaps the most visible salesman for the Administration&#39;s strategy and a key conduit to European allies. Lloyd Austin, the congenial and low-profile Secretary of Defense, has overseen the military relationship with Kyiv. Sullivan is more of an inside player, the relentless wonk at Biden&#39;s side. In an interview, Blinken called him “the hub,” an “honest broker” who has refereed the team&#39;s differences, which the Secretary acknowledged to me but described as largely “tactical, rarely fundamental in nature.” The fact that they have “a friendship, partnership, and real complicity in working together for many years,” he added, has also made for an unusually consensus-minded group.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;At the same time, the Administration&#39;s policy hasn&#39;t always been clear. “A pledge to support Ukraine &#39;for as long as it takes&#39; is not a strategy,” the top Republicans on the House and Senate foreign-affairs committees wrote in a letter this month to the White House. A major complaint from Ukraine supporters in both parties is that the White House delayed too long in providing urgently needed weapons. The term “self-deterrence” is popular among those who subscribe to this view. So is “incrementalism.” John Herbst, a former US Ambassador to Ukraine, called it “world-class ad-hoc-ery.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In some sense, the President&#39;s instructions have been clear from the beginning: No US boots on the ground; no supplying weapons for the purpose of attacking Russian territory; and avoid giving Putin grounds for nuclear escalation. In practice, however, it&#39;s fallen to Sullivan and Biden&#39;s other advisers to oversee a series of one-off decisions about which weapons systems to provide to keep Ukraine in the fight. “I don&#39;t necessarily think that they went in thinking, Oh, we&#39;re going to boil this frog slowly, because that&#39;s the best way to avoid escalation,” Andrea Kendall-Taylor, a former national-intelligence officer who worked on the Biden transition team for the NSC, said. “They stumbled into it.”&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot;

Kennan, the Kremlinologist and the architect of containment. Sullivan, in his early thirties, was already a Washington prodigy, with a dazzling résumé and a reputation as a Midwestern nice guy. When Biden named him national-security adviser, he called him a “once-in-a-generation intellect.” Clinton has referred to him as a “once-in-a-generation talent.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Sullivan grew up in a large Irish Catholic family in Minneapolis, one of five children of a high-school guidance counsellor and a college journalism professor who once studied to become a Jesuit priest. At Yale, Sullivan was the editor-in-chief of the &lt;em>;Yale Daily News&lt;/em>; and a nationally ranked college debater; once a week, he commuted to New York to intern at the Council on Foreign Relations. During his senior year, he scored a rare trifecta—“the academic equivalent of horse racing&#39;s Triple Crown,” as the &lt;em>;Yale Bulletin&lt;/em>; put it—winning all three of the most prestigious fellowships available to American undergraduates: the Rhodes, the Marshall, and the Truman. Sullivan opted for the Rhodes, earned a master&#39;s in international relations at Oxford, and took time out to compete in the world collegiate debate championships in Sydney, finishing second. He then went to Yale Law School and, after graduating, secured a Supreme Court clerkship with Justice Stephen Breyer.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;t5yf66&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Sullivan began his political career as an aide to another bright Minnesotan with a Yale degree: the Democratic senator Amy Klobuchar, who connected him with Clinton to run debate prep for her 2008 primary against Barack Obama. Sullivan quickly proved indispensable to the former First Lady, and, when Clinton became Obama&#39;s Secretary of State, Sullivan went with her. “Jake did everything for her,” one of Obama&#39;s senior aides told the authors Jonathan Allen and Amie Parnes. “Whatever was the front-burner issue of the day, you could go to Jake.” Eventually, Clinton and Sullivan travelled to a hundred and twelve countries.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Biden and his national-security team have often been portrayed, with some justification, as a sort of second coming of the Obama Administration, a reunion of the old gang, albeit with younger aides, such as Blinken and Sullivan, moving into principal positions. When Sullivan got married, in 2015, to Maggie Goodlander, who would go on to serve as counsel to Attorney General Merrick Garland, attendees at the wedding, which was held on Yale&#39;s campus, included not only Clinton, who read a Bible verse in the ceremony, but also Blinken and William Burns, Biden&#39;s future CIA director. (During Obama&#39;s Presidency, Sullivan and Burns, at that time the Deputy Secretary of State, were secretly dispatched to Oman to begin talks with Iran, which ultimately produced the Iran nuclear deal.) Tom Sullivan, the groom&#39;s younger brother, is now Blinken&#39;s deputy chief of staff.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Many of the figures who are ascendant in the Biden Administration—including Biden himself—had also been occasional critics of Obama&#39;s policy toward Russia. In 2009, when Obama sought to repair relations with Russia despite its recent invasion of Georgia, Clinton gamely handed Russia&#39;s Foreign Minister, Sergey Lavrov, an oversized “reset” button—incorrectly translated into Russian, as it turned out—to symbolize the new policy. But internally she was skeptical. When she left the Obama Administration, in 2013, one of her last acts was to submit a harshly worded memo warning the President about Putin. “Don&#39;t appear too eager to work together,” she told Obama, according to her memoir. “Don&#39;t flatter Putin with high-level attention. Decline his invitation for a presidential-level summit.” The first draft of the memo was written by Sullivan. “It was significantly darker” than the final product, he told me—so much so that “some of the Russia hands in the State Department” had said, “That&#39;s over the top, that&#39;s too far.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;After Clinton&#39;s departure, Sullivan succeeded Blinken as Biden&#39;s Vice-Presidential national-security adviser. The following year, Putin launched a surprise takeover of the Crimean Peninsula and backed a separatist war in eastern Ukraine. In response, Biden and others in the White House urged Obama to provide lethal assistance to Kyiv, such as Javelin antitank weapons, but Obama refused. Blinken and Sullivan disagreed with the decision. “Biden was generally the one that was much more forward-leaning in wanting to take more steps,” one of their NSC colleagues at the time recalled. The same was true of his advisers—“the people,” as the colleague put it, “who are now in the driver&#39;s seat.” Another colleague from the Obama years added, “These are the people from the Obama Administration who thought there were real mistakes.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Sullivan left the White House to serve as the chief policy adviser for Clinton&#39;s 2016 campaign. The morning after her loss, when Clinton stoically spoke of the need to accept Trump&#39;s win—in a speech that Sullivan had stayed up all night writing—he sat in the front row and cried. “There&#39;s nothing I don&#39;t second-guess about 2016,” he told me.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The experience convinced Sullivan that liberal internationalists like himself were an endangered species unless they could reorient their thinking. During the Trump years, he launched a think-tank project with the self-appointed mission of developing a “foreign policy for the middle class.” He emerged notably more skeptical about the benefits of unfettered globalization and free trade, a new position that he stressed as Biden&#39;s top policy adviser during the 2020 campaign.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Biden won the 2020 election not wanting to talk so much about Russia. America&#39;s growing rivalry with China, Blinken said, in an early speech as Secretary of State, now looked to be “the biggest geopolitical test” that the US would face this century. As for Russia, another reset was impossible after Putin&#39;s meddling in the 2016 Presidential election and four years of Trump&#39;s open sycophancy. Instead, Biden&#39;s team settled on a new formula, pinning their hopes on a “stable and predictable” relationship. The word “guardrails” came up often in their planning, according to a former official who was involved in the talks.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In the spring of 2021, when Russia began an ominous military buildup along its border with Ukraine, Biden invited Putin to meet in Geneva. But, by the time of the summit, in June, the threat to Ukraine seemed to have ebbed and Biden focussed on warning Putin against launching further cyberattacks on the US After the meeting, Biden insisted that there was a “genuine prospect” for better relations.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;By then, a more pressing problem was unfolding. In April, Biden had announced the end of the two-decade-long US military presence in Afghanistan, setting a September deadline for all remaining US troops to exit the country. In August, however, the US-backed government in Kabul collapsed. The Biden Administration, believing that such a possibility was months away, had failed to evacuate Afghans who had assisted the US during the conflict. Thousands descended upon the Kabul airport, where the US military organized an emergency airlift. The operation ultimately rescued some hundred and twenty-five thousand people, but only after horrific scenes of chaos and a terrorist attack at the airport&#39;s Abbey Gate, in which thirteen US service members and at least a hundred and seventy Afghans died.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Sullivan came under criticism for the botched withdrawal, with some people calling for him to be fired. Brett Bruen, the director of global engagement for the Obama White House, argued in an op-ed that Sullivan and others were responsible for “the most unnecessarily embarrassing day in the history of the National Security Council.” Sullivan kept his job, but colleagues told me that he had taken this “trial by fire,” as one put it, deeply personally. An after-action report by the State Department chided the Administration for succumbing to groupthink and for its failure to plan adequately for “worst-case scenarios.” “This definitely weighed on Jake very heavily,” Ron Klain, Biden&#39;s first White House chief of staff, told the author Chris Whipple. “Did he give the right advice? Did he push back on the military enough?”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The first secret US intelligence reports about Russia&#39;s plans to invade Ukraine came only a few weeks after the withdrawal from Afghanistan, in early October, 2021. A month later, in a speech to an Australian think tank, Sullivan again spoke about “striving for a more stable, more predictable relationship” with Russia.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;In fact, the stable-and-predictable policy was already dead. A week before the speech, Biden had dispatched Burns, his CIA director, on a secret mission to Moscow. Burns notified the Kremlin that the United States was aware of its intentions and warned of serious consequences if Putin followed through. He returned to Washington convinced that the invasion was going to happen.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Biden&#39;s NSC team was haunted by both the recent catastrophe in Afghanistan and the recollection of Putin&#39;s 2014 takeover of Crimea. “In Crimea, [Russia] created a &lt;em>;fait accompli&lt;/em>; before the world had really fully woken up to what they had done,” Sullivan recalled, in an oral history for Politico. “We wanted to make sure the world was wide awake.” He compared the situation to a scene from the first “Austin Powers” movie, in which “there&#39;s a steamroller on the far side of the room, and a guy standing there, holding up his hand, and shouting, &#39;No!&#39; Then they zoom out, and the steamroller is moving incredibly slowly and is really far away.” He added, “I was determined that we were not going to be that guy—just waiting for the steamroller to roll over Ukraine. We were going to act.”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;u70hd4&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Prewar estimates suggested that Ukraine&#39;s military could hold out against the Russians for no more than a few days. A “tiger team” assembled by Sullivan and his deputy national-security adviser, Jon Finer, met to game out possibilities. “A lot of our planning was worst-case scenario planning,” Sullivan told Politico, “which always psychologically puts one in a tough space.”&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot;

The White House was suddenly improvising a strategy for a long war. But Putin&#39;s increasingly explicit nuclear sabre-rattling meant that the early months of the conflict were spent in arguments over what might or might not cross Russia&#39;s red line. In the spring of 2022, a debate raged in Washington over whether to give Ukraine the precision medium-range missile system known as &lt;em >;HIMARS&lt;/em>;. When Nancy Pelosi, the House Speaker, led a congressional delegation to Kyiv to meet with Zelensky, the Ukrainian President&#39;s “main ask” was for the &lt;em >;HIMARS&lt;/em>;, according to Jason Crow, a House Democrat and a military veteran. Eventually, Biden approved the delivery, with the proviso that the &lt;em >;HIMARS&lt;/em>; not be used to hit targets inside Russia. “I felt like we dragged our feet,” a Democratic senator told me. Ukraine, meanwhile, moved on to the next items on its list. Arguments ensued over tanks, F-16 fighter jets, and longer-range missiles known as &lt;em >;ATACMS&lt;/em>;.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Sullivan, characteristically, knew every side of each issue. “Jake&#39;s a master debater,” one of his former NSC colleagues said. “He constantly wants to test his own propositions.” Advocates of talks with Russia have had an open line to Sullivan and his staff, as have former officials who believe that such talks are akin to selling out Ukraine. “One of the things I genuinely admire about Jake is his willingness to take criticism and input, his willingness to double-check and to ask,” Senator Chris Coons, a Biden confidant from Delaware and a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, told me.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Even officials in the Administration who have, at times, been frustrated with Sullivan told me that they appreciated his openness. “He&#39;s a really good listener, and it can be a strength,” a senior official said. “He wants a real debate, and he fosters that. But the weakness of that is that sometimes he can blow in the wind, and you just get these shocks to the system, like, &#39;Wait, what? We&#39;re doing what now?&#39; ”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Sullivan also studiously avoids any daylight between himself and Biden. “He is very careful not to contradict him,” a former official who worked with Sullivan during the Obama Administration said. “He can guide him, but he can&#39;t contradict him. That&#39;s what a national-security adviser has to do, and Jake has always been very conscious, like frankly any good Washington staffer, of never getting afoul of his principal, and he never does.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Sullivan&#39;s methodical, hyperanalytical style fits with Biden&#39;s career-long tendency to hold on to a decision, to wait and test the angles and find a way to the political center of gravity. But the downside of that approach is evident, too. “There&#39;s a real tendency to paralysis by analysis,” Eric Edelman, a former Under-Secretary of Defense in the Bush Administration, said. “Jake likes to look at every facet of a problem and wants to understand everything. That&#39;s the tragedy of government—you have to make decisions behind a veil of irreducible ignorance.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;By February of this year, it was clear that the war would not be ending anytime soon. Biden decided to travel to Kyiv, in a risky and secret trip, to commemorate the first anniversary of the invasion. During an overnight train ride from the Polish border town of Przemyśl to the Ukrainian capital, Biden and Sullivan sat alone together in a wood-panelled car, with the curtains drawn for security, working on the contours of a longer-term strategy to discuss with Zelensky. Since the previous fall, when Ukraine took back key cities such as Kherson and Kharkiv, the question was not so much whether the Administration had failed to anticipate disaster, as in Afghanistan, but what more it could do to make winning possible. Biden and Sullivan were focussed on two converging challenges—how best to supply Ukraine for a planned spring counter-offensive and how to prepare for the &lt;em >;NATO&lt;/em>; summit in July, in Vilnius, Lithuania, where Zelensky would push for a definitive answer to when Ukraine would be allowed to join the alliance.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Biden was immovable in his opposition to granting &lt;em >;NATO&lt;/em>; membership to Ukraine while the war was ongoing. But, during the ten-hour trip into the war zone, he and Sullivan discussed what they planned to offer Zelensky instead: long-term security guarantees and military assistance akin to what the US has provided to Israel since the nineteen-eighties. Sullivan told me, “We had a long conversation about this in which the President said he wanted to use the meeting in Kyiv to lay out for Zelensky his view that there is a pathway to &lt;em >;NATO&lt;/em>;—it&#39;s not for now, it&#39;s for later—and the bridge to &lt;em >;NATO&lt;/em>; is the Israel model.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;The idea had been germinating in the NSC since mid-January. The arrangement with Israel has been codified and sustained going back to the Reagan Administration by a series of formal memorandums of understanding, which commit the US to providing a certain amount of military aid and weapons over a ten-year period in order to give Israel a “qualitative military edge” in the region. Unlike &lt;em >;NATO&lt;/em>;&#39;s Article 5 commitment, which states that an attack on any one member is an attack on all, there has been no explicit pledge obliging the US to fight on Israel&#39;s behalf if it is attacked.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Such an arrangement would nevertheless send a message to Putin—and to everybody else—that the United States would not abandon Ukraine. The next morning, in a meeting with Zelensky, Biden proposed the “Israel model” for the first time. Later, when he and the Ukrainian President met with the press, Biden framed the trip as a rebuke to Putin. “Putin thought Ukraine was weak and the West was divided,” Biden said. “He thought he could outlast us. I don&#39;t think he&#39;s thinking that right now.” Then he and Zelensky took a stroll through Kyiv, as air-raid sirens blared.&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot;

In May, when Biden travelled to a G-7 summit in Japan, Sullivan pitched Yermak and other national-security advisers on a joint statement of principles outlining a long-term security commitment to Ukraine. The idea was that each country, including the US, would then negotiate its own bilateral memorandum of understanding with Ukraine. (Blinken told me that the US ultimately enlisted twenty-eight other countries.) “We negotiated the hell out of that document,” a senior Administration official said. The White House and some allies, such as Germany, wanted to insure that the statement came from the G-7, and not &lt;em >;NATO&lt;/em>;, “because &lt;em >;NATO&lt;/em>;, we continue to feel, should be kept out of this conflict,” a senior European official told me.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Zelensky, however, continued to lobby for full &lt;em >;NATO&lt;/em>; membership. Otherwise, he believed, even if Ukraine won the war it would exist in a security gray zone, vulnerable to future attack by Russia. A number of &lt;em >;NATO&lt;/em>; allies, especially among the former Soviet-bloc countries, agreed. “The bigger issue is he wanted to make clear throughout that this was not one hundred per cent a substitute for &lt;em >;NATO&lt;/em>;,” the senior Administration official recalled. “Zelensky didn&#39;t want to be told, &#39;That&#39;s it, the door is now closed on you. You&#39;re down an entirely different path and you can never get back on this other path.&#39; ”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Inside the Administration, there was disagreement about how to handle this brewing problem. Some State Department officials prodded the White House to offer more to Ukraine. During a &lt;em >;NATO&lt;/em>; meeting of foreign ministers in early June, in Oslo, Blinken called Biden and Sullivan with the message that the US, along with Germany, risked being perceived as an isolated holdout. “The strong majority felt that it was important that the summit take steps forward on advancing the proposition of Ukraine&#39;s membership and that we could not simply sit on the status quo,” Blinken told me. “And so I reported that back.” &lt;em >;NATO&lt;/em>;&#39;s Secretary-General, Jens Stoltenberg, floated a proposal for what the alliance might offer Ukraine: not yet membership, but a faster track to getting there, in which Ukraine would not be required to first fulfill an elaborate Membership Action Plan, a condition that &lt;em >;NATO&lt;/em>; had imposed on other former Soviet states. When Stoltenberg came to Washington in mid-June, Biden reluctantly agreed to skip the &lt;em >;MAP&lt;/em>;.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;xfl8ji&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Privately, the Ukrainians were hardly thrilled with the proposal. Zelensky was still holding out hope for a concrete commitment to let Ukraine join &lt;em >;NATO&lt;/em>;. A senior diplomatic source told me that the Americans were disappointed by Ukraine&#39;s reaction to the lifting of the &lt;em >;MAP&lt;/em>;: “Like, &#39;What, you don&#39;t see that as a win?&#39; It was so frustrating.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Ukraine&#39;s long-awaited spring offensive began, in June, with high expectations. Publicly, the Administration emphasized what the Pentagon called the “mountain of steel” it had sent to bolster the Ukrainian Army. But Russia had built three lines of defense in key places along the front. The fighting would hark back to the awful trench warfare of the First World War. The Ukrainians, in fact, were expending artillery shells at an unheard-of rate. In the White House, Sullivan and others worried that a shortage would stall the counter-offensive before it could succeed.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Sullivan had warned about this scenario for months. In January, the Ukrainians had worked with the Pentagon on an extensive war game in Wiesbaden to assess their needs. The conclusion was not good: the counter-offensive would require more 155-millimetre rounds than the Pentagon had to offer. By February, Sullivan began to speak of this as the war&#39;s “math problem.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;As Sullivan saw it, there were three potential solutions: dramatically ramp up production; look for additional sources of ammunition around the world; or send Ukraine some of the large stocks of phased-out cluster munitions held in storage by the Pentagon. But the White House learned that it would take months to sufficiently increase production of artillery shells—too late for the counter-offensive. And the State Department was opposed to sending cluster munitions, known as &lt;em >;DPICM&lt;/em>;s, which are outlawed by more than a hundred countries, including many US allies in Europe, because of the civilian casualties they often leave in their wake. That left the hunt for more munitions. Austin and Sullivan began calling leaders across the globe, including in countries, such as South Korea and Israel, that had not been particularly supportive of the war effort. “The decision was made to make a real run at the South Koreans, because they were the allies that had the biggest stockpile,” a senior Pentagon official recalled. Leaked documents revealed that the NSC proposed various creative ways of getting around South Korea&#39;s prohibition on directly selling arms to fuel the conflict; one of these involved having Poland or the US buy the munitions and then send them on to Ukraine.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;But by early summer a secret report from the Pentagon warned that Ukraine risked running out of ammunition sooner than expected and again recommended sending cluster munitions. “We&#39;d reached the end of the road,” the senior Administration official recalled. “Like, if we want to make sure there is not a significant disruption in supply, we have to make this decision right now.” The State Department finally lifted its objections—it was a “very stark choice,” Blinken told me, and the Pentagon&#39;s dire warning was “dispositive”—and the NSC convened a meeting to ratify the decision. “They had to go back to the President and say, Option A is the Ukrainians run out of ammo and the counter-offensive stops, or Option B is you provide &lt;em >;DPICM&lt;/em>;s,” the senior Pentagon official said. In early July, Biden announced the move, which he called “difficult.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In an interview that same day, I asked Sullivan about the Administration&#39;s cycle of “no-no-no-yes” decisions on sending various kinds of military assistance to Ukraine. By this point, even some inside the Administration found the pattern hard to understand. “It&#39;s like the boy who cried wolf,” a senior official had told me. “I just don&#39;t know what to believe anymore. When they say, &#39;No way, we would never look at the &lt;em >;ATACMS&lt;/em>;,&#39; I say, &#39;Is that true?&#39; I do feel I just keep seeing the same movie over and over again.”&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot;

I see the through line you guys are all drawing on the no-no-no-yes thing, but actually each of these has their own distinct logic to them.” To him, the Abrams-tank decision was “about sustaining unity” with Germany. Sometimes the State Department objected, as in the case of the cluster munitions. Sometimes it was the Pentagon or the President personally, as with the &lt;em >;ATACMS&lt;/em>;.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The &lt;em >;ATACMs&lt;/em>; had become a particular sore point. In 2022, Biden had rejected sending them, arguing that, to Putin, they would constitute an unacceptable escalation, since their range, up to a hundred and ninety miles, meant that they could hit targets inside Russia. “Another key goal is to insure that we do not end up in a circumstance where we are heading down the road towards a Third World War,” Sullivan said that summer. But once the British began providing similar missiles, in the spring of 2023, the argument no longer seemed to apply. “What has held us back,” the senior Pentagon official told me this summer, was that doing so would “deplete our stocks at a time when we require those missiles for our own contingencies, whether that be Iran or North Korea or China.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Members of Congress in both parties objected to that reasoning. In June, the House Foreign Affairs Committee passed a bipartisan resolution saying that &lt;em >;ATACMS&lt;/em>; should “immediately” be offered. When officials had told Crow, the Democratic congressman, that sending the &lt;em >;ATACMS&lt;/em>; would affect the Pentagon&#39;s Operations Plan, his response, he said, was “Well, for what future war? The war in Europe is now, and it is being fought by the Ukrainians. So change the goddam &lt;em >;OPLAN&lt;/em>;.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;More broadly, some of Ukraine&#39;s supporters feared that the protracted deliberations had negatively affected the counter-offensive, which, by midsummer, had failed to produce the hoped-for breaches in the Russian lines. “Think about where we might be if things like &lt;em >;HIMARS&lt;/em>;, Stingers, F-16s, &lt;em >;ATACMs&lt;/em>; were over there a year ago,” Dan Sullivan, a senior Republican senator on the Armed Services Committee, told me. “That&#39;s the really big flaw in the execution of their strategy, and it does start to undermine support when people don&#39;t think they&#39;re in it to win it.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;For his part, the national-security adviser seemed to chafe at the view, circulating widely in Washington, that he was the holdup and that others, including Blinken, were more “forward-leaning.” In recent months, Sullivan had taken to saying that, despite all the attention paid to high-tech weapons and fighter jets, there were only two things that Ukraine could not do without: artillery and air defense. This, he said, was why he had been among the loudest voices pushing to approve the cluster munitions, which, he told colleagues, were the most important single assistance the US could give. “He&#39;s frustrated with this perception that he&#39;s the problem,” a former senior US official told me. “It&#39;s completely wrong.”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;0xzpjg&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Blinken told me that the criticism stemmed from a misunderstanding of Sullivan&#39;s role. “I&#39;ve been forward-leaning in advocating to get the Ukrainians different things at different times, but it&#39;s imperative that that be part of a rigorous process,” the Secretary said. “It&#39;s never been, at all, Jake is a brake on this—it&#39;s Jake doing the job the way it&#39;s supposed to be done.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;The former official said that, by December of 2022, Sullivan was trying to get the President to use the threat of sending &lt;em >;atacms&lt;/em>; as leverage with the Russians. “He was pushing Biden: Why don&#39;t we at least say we will send &lt;em >;ATACMS&lt;/em>; unless you stop firing on cities?” the former official told me. “So he&#39;s been making that argument for at least six months now, and the President was not willing to do it. At some point, the President is the President.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Another former senior US official recalled a conversation with Sullivan about whether the US would agree to send F-16s to Ukraine. Sullivan indicated that he was supportive. But, in early 2023, Biden publicly ruled out doing so, at least in the short term. Months later, several European allies agreed, with Biden&#39;s approval, to supply F-16s to Ukraine. It wasn&#39;t until the summer, however, that the US signed off on a plan to train Ukrainian pilots on the fighter jets. The former official told me he had concluded, “The biggest drag on the speed of responding to Ukrainian requests has been the President, not Lloyd Austin, not Tony, not Jake—not the Administration, but the President. Jake is trying to play the role of honest broker, because he&#39;s with the President every day.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Martin Indyk, who served as Obama&#39;s chief Mideast peace negotiator, argued that Biden&#39;s equivocation had real consequences. “They made a big mistake,” he told me. “They self-deterred. That affected every move—that cautious incrementalism which we can now see with the benefit of hindsight was unnecessary.” Indyk, who wrote a book about Henry Kissinger&#39;s Mideast diplomacy, recalled a key moment in the Yom Kippur War, in 1973, when Kissinger, the national-security adviser, was hesitating to send more than three C-5a transport aircraft to Israel. “Nixon famously said, &#39;You know, Henry, we&#39;re going to get blamed and criticized if we send thirty or if we send three,&#39; ” Indyk told me. “So he said, &#39;Send everything that flies. And get on with it.&#39; ” The problem today is that Biden has been more Kissinger than Nixon, Indyk said: “We need him to tell Jake, &#39;Send everything that flies, goddammit, and get on with it.&#39; I think it would have changed the course of the war.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;em >;NATO&lt;/em>; summits are usually staid affairs, with almost everything haggled over and approved in advance. But two things happened in the weeks leading up to the Vilnius summit which disrupted hopes for a smooth rollout. First, in late June, came explosive news from inside Russia: Putin&#39;s mercenary Yevgeny Prigozhin had launched a mutiny. Sullivan cancelled a trip to Denmark to monitor the situation from Washington; he and Biden had just helicoptered to Camp David and arrived at their cabins when word came that Prigozhin had been persuaded to stand down.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Then, a few days later, a phone call between Biden and the German Chancellor, Olaf Scholz, threatened to derail negotiations over the summit&#39;s final communiqué, which would show where &lt;em >;NATO&lt;/em>; stood on the divisive matter of Ukraine&#39;s quest for membership. Scholz, according to four sources with whom I spoke, made clear that he was adamantly opposed to a statement that included a specific “invitation” for Ukraine to join &lt;em >;NATO&lt;/em>;. He also told Biden that he was skeptical of letting Ukraine out of the Membership Action Plan requirement. On that point, Biden refused—he had already agreed to it.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Biden, who prizes his closeness to Scholz—the senior European official described the “extremely warm, brothers-in-arms feeling” between them—agreed to present a joint front with the Germans on the idea of extending a formal invitation to Ukraine. As Scholz saw it, lifting the &lt;em >;MAP&lt;/em>; would be a significant enough show of progress for Ukraine. The senior Administration official recalled, “Biden basically said to Scholz, &#39;Look, I will make sure that, as we go through these negotiations, we aren&#39;t on a kind of a pure slippery slope.&#39; ”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The issue had still not been resolved by the weekend before the summit. That Monday, Sullivan and Blinken signed off on a compromise—an awkward, American-drafted sentence offering an unspecified future “invitation” but nothing to explain how or when Ukraine could obtain it. Another breakthrough came that night, when Turkey&#39;s leader, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, agreed to drop his objections to Sweden&#39;s &lt;em >;NATO&lt;/em>; membership, which he had been stalling almost single-handedly for more than a year.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;But on the morning of Tuesday, July 11th, when leaders were to formally gather in Vilnius, Sullivan sensed trouble during a phone call with Yermak, the Ukrainian chief of staff. Sullivan turned beet red as Yermak told him that the hard-fought language in the communiqué was not enough. After Yermak informed Sullivan that he and Zelensky would soon land in Vilnius and hoped to negotiate final wording, Sullivan responded sharply: this was &lt;em >;NATO&lt;/em>;&#39;s communiqué, he said, not Ukraine&#39;s.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Things soon got worse. Zelensky sent out a tweet blasting the draft for placing “unprecedented and absurd” conditions on Ukraine. He also suggested that the allies were holding out to use Ukraine&#39;s &lt;em >;NATO&lt;/em>; status as a bargaining chip in future negotiations with Russia. Sullivan, who was stunned by the tone of the tweet, left a meeting that Biden was holding with a bipartisan group of senators to call Yermak again. “We literally did this sentence to make them happy,” a senior US official recalled of the moment. Maybe, Sullivan said to Biden, they should remove or replace the carefully negotiated wording. What was the point if the Ukrainians didn&#39;t like it? “I was, like, this whole summit&#39;s going to come crashing down,” the senior diplomatic source said. “I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever seen Jake that angry.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;By that evening, after hours of talks, both Biden and Emmanuel Macron, the French President, among others, objected to making any revisions, and the statement was finalized exactly as it had been before the hours of embarrassingly public discord. For a summit meant to project “unity and zeal” on Ukraine&#39;s behalf, as Sullivan had put it days earlier, it was a mess. The senior European official said the dustup was consistent with the “track record of President Zelensky asking for things which he knows he cannot get,” thus “creating his own disappointment.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The Americans, the senior Administration official told me, went back to the Ukrainians with one last pitch: “Guys, the play&#39;s the same, and it&#39;s a good one for you,” with a promise of &lt;em >;NATO&lt;/em>; membership in the future and bilateral security commitments in the meantime. Zelensky got the message. The next day, he appeared alongside Biden and praised the summit as a “success” for Ukraine. Their meeting, he tweeted, was “meaningful” and “powerful.”&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;a data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a26074&amp;quot;}&quot;

event. Daria Kaleniuk, one of Ukraine&#39;s best-known anti-corruption activists, rose to ask him a question. Wearing a dusty-pink blazer over a black T-shirt emblazoned with the slogan “#Ukraine &lt;em >;NATO&lt;/em>; now,” she confronted Sullivan in starkly personal terms. She had left her eleven-year-old son behind in Kyiv, “sleeping in the corridor because of the air raids,” she said. “Jake, please advise me, what should I tell my son?” Was Biden refusing to allow Ukraine to join &lt;em >;NATO&lt;/em>; “because he is afraid of Russia”? Or because he was engaged in “back-channel communications with the Kremlin,” preparing to sell out Ukraine to Putin?&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;8f2wjc&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Sullivan, looking exhausted, began by talking about the “bravery and courage” of the Ukrainians and how the United States would be there for them “as long as it takes.” But his tone sharpened as he responded to Kaleniuk&#39;s speculation about Biden&#39;s motives, which he called “unfounded and unjustified” and “a lot of conspiracy theorizing that simply is not based on any reality whatsoever.” What&#39;s more, he added, “I think the American people do deserve a degree of gratitude” for their support of Ukraine.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;An audience member told me that there were audible gasps in the room—you don&#39;t tell a mother who&#39;s left her child sheltering from Russian bombs to express more gratitude. Hours later, Sullivan ran into Oleksiy Goncharenko, a member of Ukraine&#39;s parliament, and heatedly complained about the “unfair and unfounded” question.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Kaleniuk, for her part, had no regrets. Sullivan had been described to her as the most important Biden adviser on the war—and also as a “very, very cautious” brake on the advanced weapons, assistance, and &lt;em >;NATO&lt;/em>; membership that Ukraine needed. “It&#39;s just important for Jake to understand it&#39;s not the craziest thing, that actually there are thousands of Ukrainians who have the same perception of how America treats us,” she told me when I reached her in Kyiv. Her biggest fear, she added, was that Washington, despite its support, has no plan for how to insure that Ukraine wins. The &lt;em >;NATO&lt;/em>; summit had only reinforced this concern. “The White House doesn&#39;t have a clear end-game scenario and end-game strategy for this war,” she said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Early on, the Biden team had settled on a response to the inevitable question of how and when there might be a negotiated end to the war: “Nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine.” There would be no separate deal with Russia, they promised. But many Ukrainians, like Kaleniuk, continue to worry that that is exactly where things will end up, with the two nuclear superpowers at the table, settling their country&#39;s fate once again.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Shortly before the Vilnius summit, NBC News reported that Lavrov, the Russian Foreign Minister, had held a secret meeting in New York with former US officials, including Richard Haass, president emeritus of the Council on Foreign Relations. At the time, Sullivan and the Americans were trying to ease Ukraine&#39;s disappointment about &lt;em >;NATO&lt;/em>; membership, and they denied having anything to do with the meeting or with any other secret negotiations with Russia.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Still, a former US official who has met with the Russians during the war told me that the NSC was “fully briefed” both before and after the conversation. I was also told, in June, of an intermediary who was going to the White House with a message from the Kremlin. “The White House wants to see these people,” a former official who has participated in unofficial discussions with the Russians told me. “They want to understand what the Russians are thinking.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;There is little doubt that the Biden Administration has actively considered ways to get Russia to the negotiating table. Last fall, Mark Milley, then the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, publicly expressed his view that the war would likely not be ended on the battlefield. Privately, Sullivan has had extensive discussions about what a peace deal might look like. “My conversations with him all the way through have been about what can you do to eventually bring this war to an end,” an informal adviser of Sullivan&#39;s told me. “There are massive risks that are attendant with continuing to fight a hot war via proxy with the Russians. And the risks aren&#39;t going down. They&#39;re probably going up. So they want to find a way to eventually get to a freeze, to eventually get to a negotiated settlement. But it has to be something that keeps &lt;em >;NATO&lt;/em>; together. It has to be something that doesn&#39;t isolate the Ukrainians or have them go off and undermine everything that&#39;s been done. That&#39;s a hard square to circle.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Talks, if they do occur, are likely to raise tensions further between the US and Ukraine. “The Administration&#39;s policy up to now has been close to unconditional support for Ukraine and essentially a real reluctance to be seen to be at cross-purposes with Ukraine,” Haass told me. “But that policy endures only if there is identity of interests between the United States and Ukraine, and if that were to be the case that would be without historical precedent. If you look at the history—whether the US with South Vietnam, or the US with Israel, or the US with Britain and France during Suez—history is about how you manage disagreement with your allies.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In September, shortly before Zelensky made his second visit to Washington since the invasion, Biden approved sending &lt;em >;ATACMS&lt;/em>; to Ukraine, after nearly a year of resisting the idea. American officials, meanwhile, have held two rounds of formal negotiations with Ukraine over the terms of a memorandum of understanding—Sullivan&#39;s “Israel model.” With Trump barrelling toward the Republican nomination, however, the political support that had once seemed so strong and bipartisan for Ukraine in Washington has been quickly eroding.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;On September 30th, the House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, facing a rebellion from a group of hard-right Trumpists, stripped Ukraine funding from a resolution to temporarily keep the government open. A few days later, Biden asked European leaders, on a call, “not to read too much into it,” Blinken told me, but, within hours, McCarthy was ousted as Speaker by the anti-Ukraine rebels. Now the fate of Ukraine aid, including a White House request for another twenty-four billion dollars, is entirely up in the air. Zelensky, during his recent visit, warned members of the US Senate about the consequences of a cutoff: “If we don&#39;t get the aid, we will lose the war.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Sullivan clearly has profound worries about how this will all play out. Months into the counter-offensive, Ukraine has yet to reclaim much more of its territory; the Administration has been telling members of Congress that the conflict could last three to five years. A grinding war of attrition would be a disaster for both Ukraine and its allies, but a negotiated settlement does not seem possible as long as Putin remains in power. Putin, of course, has every incentive to keep fighting through next year&#39;s US election, with its possibility of a Trump return. And it&#39;s hard to imagine Zelensky going for a deal with Putin, either, given all that Ukraine has sacrificed. Even a Ukrainian victory would present challenges for American foreign policy, since it would “threaten the integrity of the Russian state and the Russian regime and create instability throughout Eurasia,” as one of the former US officials put it to me. Ukraine&#39;s desire to take back occupied Crimea has been a particular concern for Sullivan, who has privately noted the Administration&#39;s assessment that this scenario carries the highest risk of Putin following through on his nuclear threats. In other words, there are few good options.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;khj96&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;“The reason they&#39;ve been so hesitant about escalation is not exactly because they see Russian reprisal as a likely problem,” the former official said. “It&#39;s not like they think, Oh, we&#39;re going to give them &lt;em >;ATACMS&lt;/em>; and then Russia is going to launch an attack against &lt;em >;NATO&lt;/em>;. It&#39;s because they recognize that it&#39;s not going anywhere—that they are fighting a war they can&#39;t afford either to win or lose.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I read this quote to Sullivan during our interview in the Roosevelt Room. “That&#39;s kind of the rap on us,” he acknowledged. “I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a fair one. We&#39;re not fighting for a draw here.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Then he proceeded, once again, to raise and attempt to demolish all the by now familiar arguments. “To be paralyzed by escalation would be terrible, and we have not been paralyzed—we have provided tens of billions of dollars of advanced weapons, intelligence, training, capacity, that has had enormous lethal effect,” he said. “But to be completely cavalier about escalation, to say that to even raise the question makes you a coward, that&#39;s easy to do from the outside, but when you sit in this seat you can&#39;t do that. You have an obligation to the American people to consider worst-case scenarios. That&#39;s our job.” ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>; &lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/ div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;div>;&lt;div>;&lt;div>;&lt;div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt; /div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 09 Oct 2023 19:06:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Raking Dirt for Art’s Sake]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/10/16/raking-dirt-for-arts-sake]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-09T10:00:00.000Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/652079b9e60c85389b83b125/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/231016_r43182illuweb-site.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;article >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attribute-verso-pattern=&quot;article-body&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;ArticlePageChunks&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;A line snaked along Wooster Street the other day, for a designer sample sale. A few doors down and one floor up, Bill Dilworth stood in a large room filled with two hundred and eighty thousand pounds of dirt, wondering how the two days of watering that he&#39;d just finished had affected the soil.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Just to get it back to this moist state is gratifying to me, because this is the state that I relate to, that I maintained for decades,” Dilworth, who had the knee-high rubber boots of a farmer, the trim-cut jeans of an urbanite, and the eyebrows of a mad scientist, said. He has spent the past thirty-four years caring for “The New York Earth Room,” an installation by the artist Walter De Maria which is part of the Dia Art Foundation&#39;s permanent collection. His chief duties are watering and raking the soil, to keep its color consistent.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Dilworth and his wife moved to New York from Detroit in 1979, and one of his odd jobs was sweeping the basement stairs in a Dia building. When he took over the Earth Room, in 1989, all he was given by way of instruction was a photograph of what it looked like when it was installed, in 1977, for an intended three-month run. (Photographs are not permitted; that image is the only sanctioned one.) The room is thirty-six hundred square feet, filled with dirt twenty-two inches deep. Visitors view it from behind a knee-high glass barrier.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Last year, Dia replenished the soil, which had fallen below the height that the artist wanted—owing to a combination, Dilworth said, of natural causes (“the weight of me walking on it”) and visitors sneaking out with handfuls. The new soil was too dry, so, in January, Dilworth gave it a thorough watering with a hose. The humidity inside interacted with the cold air outside, making the windows stream with condensation. After that, he let the soil dry out for a spell, then watered it again.&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Now he was ready to see what the color looked like beneath the surface. He started in with a clawlike tool called a cultivator. “Oh, my God, it really saturated,” he said, delighted. The earth he was turning over had a uniform dark-chocolate hue. Next, he would try a rake with broad, short tines. (Both tools were on site when he started.) For his first three decades, he had mostly used the cultivator. (“I thought it looked a bit like a rug, so I tried to make it look more like earth.”) Last year, he switched to the rake after Heiner Friedrich, a Dia founder, suggested that he “smooth it out.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Visitors often ask Dilworth what the Earth Room means, and he usually gives them the same answer: “Walter didn&#39;t speak about it, so, whatever your impressions are, that&#39;s valid. Don&#39;t worry about what it&#39;s about. There is no explanation.” He adds that on a return visit “you might have a different take.” In the winter, the dirt is likely to be drier and lighter. In the summer, after watering, it can be “black and loamy.” He likes “the idea that it&#39;s not static.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;If a visitor keeps pushing for an interpretation, Dilworth will say, “It&#39;s about earth, art, and quiet.” It is also about time: “People look at it, and they think nothing&#39;s growing, and I say, &#39;Look at it again, time is growing out there.&#39; ”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;This is Dilworth&#39;s last season with the Earth Room; he plans to retire next spring. (His wife, Patti, recently retired, after decades of caring for another De Maria installation, “The Broken Kilometer,” a couple of blocks away.) In addition to overseeing the dirt, Dilworth buzzes in visitors and supplies Dia with a tally. For years, he kept track using a handheld metal clicker. When there were no visitors, he would retreat to a back room and work on his own art. (One reason he took the job was the free studio space it offered.)&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Over the years, the number of visitors increased. Dilworth needed to find a way to pursue his art while sitting at the front desk. In 2003, he made the process of tallying his new project, creating a visual map of the day, each person marked by a curling black stroke. At one point, he experimented with color: red and green in December; a brief stint of pink for women and blue for men.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;He might try color again for his final season. But first he had to decide how to rake the newly moistened dirt. He eyed two patches he had already raked: a smoother area, from the flat rake, and a textured one, from the cultivator. He opted for the cultivator.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“It&#39;s meant to be unchanging,” he said. “But it&#39;s always been changing.” For years, he had raked from right to left. “Then it occurred to me—why don&#39;t I just rake it the other way.” Years later, another idea: front to back. “Instead of lengthwise, I would go widthwise. I always loved it widthwise, I always felt it was special that way.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“The nice thing about duration and time,” he said, “is that you eventually get to things.” ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;184gw8&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;tj4iqi&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 09 Oct 2023 19:06:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[A Trans Teen in an Anti-Trans State]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/10/16/a-trans-teen-in-an-anti-trans-state]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-09T10:00:00.000Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/651f50effaa4a51aff771bd9/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/231016_r43183.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;article >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attribute-verso-pattern=&quot;article-body&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;ArticlePageChunks&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;On the last morning of July, Kristen Chapman was getting ready to leave Nashville. Chapman, who is in her early fifties and wears her silver hair short, sat on a camp chair next to a fire pit outside the rental duplex where her family had lived for twelve years. She was smoking an American Spirit and swatting at the mosquitoes that kept emerging from the dense green brush behind her. Her husband, Paul, who was wearing a T-shirt with the Guinness logo, carried boxes out to the front lawn. Their daughters, Saoirse and Willow, who were seventeen and fifteen, were inside, still asleep. Chapman looked down at the family&#39;s beagle mix, Obi-Wan Kenobi, who was drinking rainwater out of a plastic bucket. “We got him when we moved in here for the kids,” she said. “He&#39;s never lived anywhere else.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Paul was planning to stay in town; Chapman was heading to Richmond, Virginia, with Saoirse and Willow. Chapman and Paul&#39;s marriage was ending, but the decision to split their family apart had happened abruptly. Willow is trans, and had been on puberty blockers since 2021. In March, Tennessee&#39;s governor, Bill Lee, had signed a bill that banned gender-transition treatment for minors across the state.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;On paper, the law, which went into effect in early July, would allow trans teens like Willow to continue their medical care until March of 2024. But Chapman wasn&#39;t sure they could count on that. Willow was determined to begin taking estrogen when she turned sixteen, in December of 2023, which would allow her to grow into adulthood with feminine characteristics. If she couldn&#39;t continue taking puberty blockers until then, she would begin to go through male puberty, which could mean more surgeries and other procedures later in life.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;At first, the family had hoped that the courts would declare the new law unconstitutional. Federal courts had already done so in at least four other states in 2023, finding that such bans violated the First Amendment and the equal-protection and due-process clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment. But that spring the Pediatric Transgender Clinic at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, where Willow had been receiving care, informed its patients that it was ceasing operations. Seeing this as a bad sign, Chapman set up a GoFundMe page in early May and began planning their departure.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Inside, the apartment was filled with abandoned objects—an old Wi-Fi router, trash bags of unwanted clothes. A Homer Simpson doll in a hula skirt lay forgotten on a windowsill. Chapman, an artist who supplements her income with social work, had recently quit her job as a caseworker. She would need their landlord as a reference to get an apartment, especially because she had bad credit, but the family still owed him back rent. She checked Venmo, waiting on a loan from a friend.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;At six-thirty that morning, Chapman had gone out to her white Dodge SUV and found her younger daughter asleep in the back seat. Willow had gone over to a friend&#39;s house and stayed out late. When she got home, she realized that she had locked herself out. The Dodge&#39;s window had been stuck open for months, so she got in. “Any other human being would have handled this totally differently,” Chapman said, shaking her head.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Willow had gone back to sleep in her room, which she once shared with her brother. (He was a sophomore in college and had already moved out.) The colorful scarves and lights that used to decorate the space had been taken down. When she woke up, she began sifting through what was left. “I feel like I&#39;m ready to say goodbye to it,” she said, looking around. There were drawings scrawled on the wall, a desk spattered in paint. “Most of the stuff in here I&#39;ve trashed.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“It&#39;s like getting a new haircut,” Chapman said. “A fresh palette.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Chapman had chosen Virginia for their new life, she said, because it was still in the South, but there would be “multiple avenues of escape.” Paul worked nights for a large grocery-store chain; Richmond was among the northernmost cities where it had branches, and Chapman thought that at some point he might be able to transfer there. Earlier in the summer, she and Willow had driven to Richmond to see the city, and Chapman had lined up a marketing job. It didn&#39;t pay well, but she knew she wouldn&#39;t get a lease without a job. Willow, who had received her last puberty-blocker shot at the Vanderbilt clinic in late May, was supposed to receive her next one in late August. They didn&#39;t have a lot of time.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Despite having taken puberty blockers for two years, Willow looks her age. She is tall and long-limbed and meticulous about her appearance. That morning, she had on Y2K-revival clothes: wide-legged jeans worn low on the hips with a belt, a patterned tank top, and furry pink Juicy Couture boots. Her blond hair was glossy and straight, her bangs held back with a barrette. She is committed to living her adolescence as a girl regardless of what medical treatment she is allowed to receive. At times she has used silicone prosthetic breasts; attaching them is an onerous process involving spray-on adhesive.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;From a very young age, Willow wore dresses and gravitated toward friendships with girls. Her parents thought that she would likely grow up to be a gay man. As Chapman put it, “We knew she was in the fam.” When a homophobic shooter killed forty-nine people at Pulse, the gay night club in Orlando, in 2016, Willow, who was eight at the time, accompanied her mother to a vigil in Nashville. Willow wrote a long message on a banner in solidarity with the survivors. Chapman took a photo of her there. “It was like she was transfixed,” Chapman remembered. In the sixth grade, Willow went to an all-girl sleepover. A parent overheard the kids discussing gender and sexuality, and told Chapman. Willow says that it was around then that she began to think about her identity. “Pretty much as soon as I knew about, like, conceptualized gender, I knew I wanted to be a girl,” she said. She had been an A student, but her grades started going down. Looking back, Willow struggled to articulate what had happened. “It just got complicated, like with all my stuff physically, it just felt like a mess,” she said.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;She came out to her friends first; then one day, in the spring of 2020, while she was upstairs on her laptop and Chapman was downstairs working, Willow sent her mother a three-word e-mail that said, “I am trans.” Willow told me, “I realized I have to do this sometime if I want to advocate for myself and get what I need to get.” She left it to her mother to inform the rest of the family. Chapman was accepting; Paul was more skeptical. “That&#39;s him, you know—a man of science,” Chapman said. “It wasn&#39;t overly positive or negative.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Willow had already decided on her new name before coming out, and began using it with friends. She was again reluctant to tell her family. “I was, like, I&#39;ll keep that secret,” she said—she had been named at birth for a brother of her father&#39;s who had died, and knew the name was important to him. Her mother found out when another mom referred to Willow by her chosen name. Chapman started using it right away; it took Paul another year.&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;a data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a23219&amp;quot;}&quot;

She was referred to the center&#39;s Pediatric Transgender Clinic. The clinic, which opened in 2018, was part of a broader expansion of gender-affirming care at flagship medical schools in the South that occurred around that time. (Clinics also opened at Duke University, the University of Mississippi, and Emory University, among other schools.) These places “attracted the kind of people who build very trusting relationships with patients and are able to establish not just the clinical competencies but also an inclusive environment,” Jasmine Beach-Ferrara, the executive director of the Campaign for Southern Equality, an advocacy group for LGBTQ rights, told me. “All those things are nothing you can take for granted when seeking medical care in the South.” (Federal funding for health care is often funnelled through state governments, some of which have a history of withholding money from providers that offer abortion and other politicized health services.)&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Care for patients who are experiencing gender dysphoria is highly individualized: some trans kids opt for a purely social transition, changing their names or pronouns; others, like Willow, seek a medical transition, which can be started at the onset of puberty. In Willow&#39;s case, a diagnosis of gender dysphoria had to be verified before pharmaceutical treatment could begin. A course of psychotherapy was accompanied by a physical assessment at Vanderbilt, which included ultrasounds, X-rays, and blood tests. The clinic was following a protocol supported by the Endocrine Society and the World Professional Association for Transgender Health, whereby patients take puberty blockers—which have been used to treat children experiencing early-onset puberty since the nineteen-eighties—to delay the onset of secondary sex characteristics until they are ready to begin taking estrogen or testosterone.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;“I&#39;d always explain it to the families as a pause on puberty, allowing the youth to take a deep breath,” Kimberly Herrmann, a pediatrician and internist at Whitman-Walker Health, a provider in the Washington, DC, area that offers gender-affirming care to patients aged thirteen and over, told me. (Some patients choose to go through their natal puberty.) “All of the data suggests that it is the correct thing to do for a patient with a clear diagnosis,” Izzy Lowell, a doctor who started a telehealth practice for gender-affirming care called QueerMed, said, of taking puberty blockers. “If they are going to develop the body of a grown man, it becomes difficult to undo those changes.”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;dbzuah&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Paul was worried about the blockers&#39; long-term effects on Willow&#39;s health. (Studies have shown that they can affect bone density when used long term, and the protocol for hormone therapy advises doctors to discuss potential risks to fertility and options for fertility preservation.) Chapman thought the risks to Willow&#39;s well-being would be worse if she developed male secondary sex characteristics. In one testimony against the Tennessee ban, an adult trans woman described her adolescence, in which she attempted to present as male, as “a disastrous and torturous experience.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Paul and I talked about it and came to the belief that we wanted her on them as quickly as possible for safety reasons,” Chapman said. “I hate that that&#39;s true, but we know that&#39;s the world that we live in, and that she is going to be a safer person for the rest of her life if she does not look male.” (A recent analysis of crime statistics from 2017 and 2018 found that transgender people are more than four times as likely as cisgender people to be the victims of a violent crime.)&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The evaluation and diagnosis took almost a year. For Willow, the talk therapy was the most taxing part. Willow was insured through the state&#39;s Medicaid program, TennCare, which meant that there were only a limited number of therapists she could see, none of whom were trans, or even queer. She went through three in a year. “We were in the lowest tier of care,” Chapman said, adding that at least one therapist dropped their health insurance. Willow told her mother that she wished she could just be left alone to be a “sad trans girl.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;At the age of thirteen, she was finally able to start puberty blockers. “You have an end goal,” Willow said of the experience. “And all the in-between doesn&#39;t matter.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In September, 2022, the conservative commentator and anti-trans activist Matt Walsh, who moved to Nashville in 2020 (along with his employer, the conservative news company the Daily Wire), posted a thread on Twitter. “Vanderbilt drugs, chemically castrates, and performs double mastectomies on minors,” it began. “But it gets worse.” Walsh—who is the author of books including “Church of Cowards: A Wake-Up Call to Complacent Christians” and “What Is a Woman?,” a polemic arguing that gender roles are biologically determined—worked in conservative talk radio before being hired by the Daily Wire as a writer, in 2017. Last year, the left-wing watchdog group Media Matters for America mapped Walsh&#39;s origins as an aspiring radio shock jock in the early twenty-tens who once said, “We probably lost our republic after Reconstruction.” In 2022, he was one of several right-wing social-media pundits who began broadcasting misinformation about hospitals that provided gender-transition treatment for minors, which were then overwhelmed with phone and e-mail threats and online harassment. One study found that more than fifteen hospitals modified or took down Web sites about pediatric gender care after being named in these campaigns.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Walsh included in his thread about Vanderbilt a video clip of Shayne Taylor, the medical director of its Transgender Clinic, speaking of top and bottom surgeries as a potential “money-maker” for the hospital. Walsh did not specify that Taylor was mostly speaking about adults. (Vanderbilt never performed genital surgery on underage patients and did an average of five top surgeries a year on minors, with a minimum age of sixteen.) More than sixty Republican state legislators signed a letter to Vanderbilt describing the clinic&#39;s practices “as nothing less than abuse.” In a statement calling for an investigation, Governor Lee, who was up for reëlection, said that “we should not allow permanent, life-altering decisions that hurt children.” Within days, Vanderbilt announced that it would put a pause on surgeries for minors. Jonathan Skrmetti, Tennessee&#39;s Republican attorney general, began an inquiry into whether Vanderbilt had manipulated billing codes to avoid limitations on insurance coverage.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In October, Walsh and other anti-trans advocates held a “Rally to End Child Mutilation” in Nashville&#39;s War Memorial Plaza. The speakers included the Tennessee senator Marsha Blackburn, the former Democratic Presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard, and Chloe Cole, a nineteen-year-old self-described “former trans kid.” After identifying as male from the age of twelve, receiving testosterone, and getting top surgery, Cole de-transitioned to female at sixteen and is now one of the country&#39;s foremost youth advocates of bans on gender-transition treatment for minors. “I was allowed to make an adult decision as a traumatized fifteen-year-old,” she said at the rally.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;For the past four years, the number of anti-trans bills proposed throughout the United States has dramatically risen. The ACLU has counted some four hundred and ninety-six proposals in state legislatures in 2023, eighty-four of which have been signed into law. The first state ban on gender-transition treatment for minors was passed in Arkansas in 2021. It was permanently blocked by a federal judge this year, but more than twenty states have passed similar laws since then. As lawsuits filed by the ACLU, Lambda Legal, and other organizations make their way through the courts, trans people are left to navigate a shifting legal landscape that activists say has affected clinical and pharmaceutical access. Lowell told me that she consults with six lawyers (including one she keeps on retainer) to best advise patients, who must frequently drive across state borders to receive care. “It&#39;s literally a daily task to figure out what&#39;s legal where,” she said.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;In Tennessee, the Human Rights Campaign has counted the passage of at least nineteen anti-LGBTQ laws since 2015, among the most in the nation. Some of these laws have been found unconstitutional, such as a ban on drag shows in public spaces and a law that would have required any business to post a warning if it let transgender people use their preferred rest room. But many others have gone into effect, such as laws that censor school curricula and ban transgender youth from playing on the sports teams that align with their identity.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Proposals to ban gender-transition treatment for minors were the first bills introduced in the opening legislative sessions of the Tennessee House and Senate in November, 2022. “It was Matt Walsh who lit a fire under the ultraconservative wing of the Republican Party this year,” Chris Sanders, the director of a Nashville-based LGBTQ advocacy group called Tennessee Equality Project, told me. “It was lightning speed the way it all unfolded.” At hearings throughout the winter, parents of trans kids, trans adults, trans youth, and a Memphis pediatrician who provides gender-affirming care testified against the ban. Those who spoke in support of it included Walsh, Cole (who is from California), and a right-wing Tennessee physician named Omar Hamada, who compared such treatment to letting a minor who wanted to become a pirate get a limb and one eye removed.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;LGBTQ activists who attended described feeling disregarded by the Republican majority. Molly Quinn, the executive director of OUTMemphis, a nonprofit that helps trans youth navigate their health care, likened the experience to “being the only queer kid at a frat party.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Three months after Governor Lee signed the ban, Vanderbilt University Medical Center informed patients that the previous November, at the attorney general&#39;s request, it had shared non-anonymized patient records from the Pediatric Transgender Clinic, including photographic documentation and mental-health assessments. “I immediately started hearing from parents,” Sanders said. Their fear stemmed in part from attempts in states like Texas to have the parents of trans kids investigated by child-protective services. (The attorney general&#39;s office said in a statement that it is “legally bound to maintain the medical records in the strictest confidence, which it does.”) Former patients have sued Vanderbilt, and a federal investigation by the Department of Health and Human Services is also under way. (A spokesperson for Vanderbilt declined to comment for this article.)&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In July, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals became the first federal court in the country to allow a ban on gender-transition treatment for minors to take effect, with a final ruling planned for September. Chapman, who had spoken out for trans rights through local media outlets, and had been targeted with online threats and menacing phone calls in return, understood that Tennessee, where she had lived for most of the past thirty-five years, had become a hostile environment for her family. “I genuinely feel we are being run out of town on a rail,” she said. “I am not being dramatic. It is not my imagination.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;It was dusk by the time Paul had loaded the last of the boxes into three storage pods. Everything was ready, but the family was having trouble leaving. Someone would walk out of the house and get into the car, only to go back into the house five minutes later. Chapman suddenly remembered that she had forgotten to buy padlocks for the storage pods, which were scheduled to be picked up by U-Haul the next day. As she drove off to get them, Paul sat on the back steps and stared out at the lawn. Fireflies were winking on and off over the grass.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Bollocks,” he said to himself, then stood up and went inside.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Although comprehensive demographic data on transgender youth are scarce, the American Academy of Pediatrics has reported that “research increasingly suggests that familial acceptance or rejection ultimately has little influence on the gender identity of youth.” But without parental consent most kids in America who wish to transition medically are legally unable to do so until they turn eighteen. Having a supportive parent or guardian as a trans child is more than a legal or practical advantage, though. A study of eighty-four youth in Ontario, aged sixteen to twenty-four, who identified as trans and had come out to their parents found that the rate of attempted suicide was four per cent among those whose parents were strongly supportive but that nearly sixty per cent of respondents who described their parents as not supportive had attempted suicide in the previous year.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Chapman&#39;s decision to support her daughter grew in part out of her own experience as a black sheep in a deeply religious family. She was born in East Tennessee to a Baptist minister and his wife and had an itinerant upbringing, moving around the South. The last words her grandfather, who was also a Baptist minister, said to her were “I&#39;m so sorry I&#39;m not gonna see you in Heaven.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Paul was raised in Dublin, Ireland, as the youngest of twelve children in a Catholic family. “We both came from communities that were super fundamentalist,” Chapman said. They agreed that they would raise their children outside of any religious tradition. If they had a doctrine, Chapman said, it was “critical thinking.” They brought their kids to Black Lives Matter demonstrations, and took them to hear the Georgia congressman and civil-rights activist John Lewis speak. But Paul and Kristen would also listen to the far-right radio host Rush Limbaugh, to know what the other side was saying. As the children got older, Paul and Kristen started to have different visions of the future—Kristen wanted to buy an RV and travel the country, and Paul wanted to buy a house. In 2019, they decided to separate, but they couldn&#39;t afford to split their family into two households.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;2ct6if&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Paul at first had trouble understanding how Willow could decide about her gender so young. Kristen would argue, “If a person presents and says, &#39;This is who I am,&#39; it is not your job to unpack that.” In the end, it was by talking to two trans women—a co-worker in her fifties and a twentysomething bartender at the pub he frequented—that Paul came to understand his daughter better. “Reading online was too much right-wing or left-wing,” he said. “I needed something more grounded.” The bartender told him that her father had rejected her, and that she had scars on her arms from self-harm. “I said, no matter what, I wasn&#39;t doing that,” Paul recalled.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Willow had told me that one of the hardest parts of leaving town was doing so while her relationship to her father was still evolving. “I feel like my biggest unfinished business is that relationship,” she said the day before the move, over boba tea in a strip mall called Plaza Mariachi. “I think I&#39;ve dealt with it. We&#39;ll talk on the phone. Even if we don&#39;t have an in-person connection, I think we&#39;ll be OK”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Once they all managed to leave the house for the last time, Paul gave Chapman and each daughter a hundred dollars in cash as a parting gift. The family had dinner at Panera Bread, then sat for a while at a nearby park. Paul cancelled two Lyfts before finally getting in one and heading to the pub, where he would try to process the day. Chapman and the girls got in the white Dodge and took I-24 out of Nashville.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;LGBTQ-rights activists around the country have seen the sudden uptick in bills targeting transgender identity as a strategy to rally conservative voters after the legalization of gay marriage and the criminalization of abortion. “There was an inordinate amount of money and attention and huge far-right groups, many of which have been deemed hate groups, focussed on keeping us as LGBTQ people from getting married, right?” Simone Chriss, a Florida-based lawyer, told me. Chriss is representing trans people in several lawsuits against the state over its restrictions on gender-affirming care. She observed that, after the Supreme Court legalized gay marriage, in 2015, “all of the people singularly focussed on that needed something else to focus on.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;She recalled watching as model legislation propagated by groups such as the Alliance Defending Freedom and the Family Research Council targeted trans people&#39;s freedom to use bathrooms of their choice, and to play on their preferred sports teams. Health care came next. “All of a sudden, you see this surge in gender-affirming-care bills,” Chriss said. “And what&#39;s bananas is there was not a single bill introduced in a single state legislature prior to 2018.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The anti-trans rhetoric about protecting children mirrored that of the anti-gay-marriage movement, she continued, and new rules mandating waiting periods, for example, were familiar from the anti-abortion movement. “It&#39;s like dipping a toe in by making it about trans children,” she said. “I think the goal is the erasure of trans people, in part by erasing the health care that allows them to live authentically.”&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot;

(The Williams Institute at UCLA estimates that there are more than a hundred thousand thirteen-to-seventeen-year-olds who identify as trans living in the South, more than in any other region in the country.) Already, university hospitals such as the University of Mississippi Medical Center and the Medical University of South Carolina have discontinued their pediatric gender services before being legally required to do so.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Had Chapman stayed in Tennessee, Willow&#39;s closest option for getting puberty-blocker shots would likely have required a four-hundred-and-fifty-mile trip to Peoria, Illinois. Willow&#39;s TennCare insurance would not easily travel, and a single shot can cost twelve hundred dollars out of pocket. Paul had told Chapman not to be ashamed if the move didn&#39;t work out and she changed her mind, but she already knew she would never go back to Nashville.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;On their way east, the family stopped for a few days in Seneca, South Carolina, where Chapman has relatives. Back on the road, she tried not to focus on the uncertainty that awaited her and her daughters, but she had to pull over at least twice to breathe her way through anxiety attacks. There was a heat wave, and by the time they arrived in Richmond the back speakers of the SUV were blown out, and everyone was in a bad mood. Willow had snapped at her mother and Saoirse for trying to sing along to the Cranberries; she had even yelled at the dog. “It was difficult?” Willow told me afterward, when I asked how the trip had been; then she added, “I&#39;m still excited.” (Saoirse declined to be interviewed.)&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Chapman had booked an Airbnb, a dusty-blue bungalow outside Richmond. It had good air-conditioning and a small back yard for the dog. She could afford only a week there before they would have to move to a motel. That night, Willow zoned out to old episodes of “RuPaul&#39;s Drag Race” in the living room, while Chapman scrolled through real-estate listings on her phone. She asked for advice on the social-media feeds of local LGBTQ groups, and the responses were heartening. She decided that, if she was able to find a place to live by the end of the week, she would not take the marketing job she had lined up. School wouldn&#39;t start for a few weeks, and it was not the right moment to leave her daughters alone all day.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;At eight the next morning, Chapman was sitting in an otherwise empty waiting room at the Southside Community Services Center, filling out forms to get the family food stamps and health insurance. She had put on makeup for the first time in days and was wearing wide-legged leopard-print pants and a black shirt. She had forgotten her reading glasses, however. “Do you have a spouse who does not live at home?” she read out loud, squinting her way through the questions. “Yes,” she answered to herself, checking a box. (She and Paul are not yet divorced.)&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Chapman kept mistakenly writing “Willow” on the government forms—she had never officially changed her daughter&#39;s name. (A 1977 Tennessee state law that prohibits amending one&#39;s gender on a birth certificate will apply to Willow no matter where she moves; another Tennessee law, which went into effect this past July, bans people from changing the gender on their driver&#39;s license.) Chapman picked up the next batch of forms, for Medicaid. “One down, one to go,” she said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Later in the day, Chapman and her daughters went to see a house that was advertised on Craigslist, an affordable three-bedroom in the suburbs of Richmond. As they were driving, the owner texted Chapman that he had a flat tire and couldn&#39;t meet them. But the place looked ideal from the outside, so she filled out an application and sent the landlord a thousand-dollar deposit. At five the next morning, she woke up and saw a text from the owner claiming that the money transfer had not gone through. She quickly realized she&#39;d been scammed.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Chapman became weepy. She posted on social media about the con, then drove Saoirse to a thrift store she wanted to visit. At first, only one shopper noticed the woman crying uncontrollably in the furniture section. Then someone went to find some tissues, and someone else brought water. Soon, Chapman recalled, she was surrounded by women murmuring words of sympathy.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;That evening at the Airbnb, Chapman and Willow sat at the kitchen table. “The emotional impact of the scam hit me way more than the money,” Chapman said, still tearing up at the thought of it. Willow nodded in sympathy. But for Chapman the experience was also a reminder of the advantages of talking about their situation—the women had told her that the schools near the house were not very good, anyway. “Thrift-store people will help you when you&#39;re down and out. They&#39;re used to broken shit,” she said, shaking her head. “If I had broke down in a Macy&#39;s? Think how different the reaction would be.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The next morning, Chapman was feeling a little less pessimistic. The humidity had broken, and the weather was good. People had responded to the news of the scam by donating money to replace what she had lost, and a local Facebook group had led her to a property-management company that was flexible toward tenants with bad credit.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;She drove to see a three-bedroom apartment in a centrally situated part of Richmond. Though one of the bedrooms was windowless, the place was newly painted, and it had a wooden landing out back that could serve as a deck. It was also in a school district that people had recommended. “I can see this working,” Chapman said tentatively. Most of the utilities were included in the sixteen-hundred-and-fifty-dollar rent. Chapman didn&#39;t have time to overthink it. She wrote the real-estate agent saying she would apply.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;That afternoon, Chapman drove Willow to see the apartment. The door was locked, but Willow climbed through a window and opened the door so they could consider the space together. “We were, like, &#39;Oh, this is nice,&#39; ” Willow said. She loved the neighborhood, which had vintage stores and coffee shops. “You can walk anywhere, you don&#39;t need transportation—that&#39;s really cool.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The next day, Willow was sitting on a couch in the Airbnb watching a slasher film called “Terrifier.” Chapman was next to her, getting ready for a Zoom call with someone from a local trans-rights organization called He She Ze and We.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In the weeks leading up to the move, Chapman had taken time to research which schools were friendly to trans people. Willow estimated that maybe half the students in her middle school in Nashville were transphobic, and twenty per cent were explicit about it. She was bullied, but she says that it didn&#39;t bother her. Her teachers were more supportive, such as the one who gave her an entire Lilith Fair-era wardrobe. “She was, like, &#39;Do you want some of my old clothes? Because you&#39;re so fashion,&#39; ” Willow said. “I had that black little bob.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;“She had Siouxsie Sioux hair for a while,” Chapman said, looking at her fondly.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The two of them agree that Willow&#39;s personality shifted after transitioning. Once withdrawn and nonconfrontational, she began to develop a defiant attitude. “It was kind of fun to just mess with them,” she recalled of the bullies, who she said were not vicious but more into trying to get a laugh—“like, childish, immature stuff.” She would be coy; she would tell them to give her a kiss. “My only weapon, I guess, was how I chose to respond,” she said.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;hm4h5p&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;“She&#39;s not a shrinking violet,” her mother added.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“I just don&#39;t like the traditional way that you&#39;re taught to stand up for yourself,” Willow said. “I think absurdism is the best way.” If she lets someone misgender her, she said, “it&#39;s not because I don&#39;t want to be the annoying trans person, it&#39;s more like . 。 。 you&#39;re not gonna get to those people.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In her freshman year, she attended a public arts high school, and began skipping class and smoking. She says there were at least ten other students who identified as trans, but she remained something of an outsider. When she was in school, she says, she almost thought of herself as a kind of character expected to perform.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Chapman is not a disciplinarian—she had enough of that growing up. But she had a conversation with her daughter after watching a video of an incident in which Willow was voguing in a school hallway, attempted to do a death drop, and ended up with a concussion. The students around Willow were clapping and egging her on even after she fell. “It&#39;s great that you&#39;re the kind of person who will do crazy things,” Chapman remembered saying, “but you need people around you who are not like that.” Both Chapman and Paul worry about Willow&#39;s safety, in part because she is not easily scared herself.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Will you turn that off?” Chapman said now about the horror film, as she logged on to Zoom. Willow took that as a cue to leave the room.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“You&#39;re going to want to be on this thing,” Chapman said, calling her back.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Willow, who wore blue eyeshadow, a purple baby tee with a peace sign and the word “Smile!” on it, and magenta-pink shorts, plopped back down on the couch, then got up to retrieve supplies to disinfect her belly-button piercing, which she began to do with studiousness.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;On Zoom, Chapman introduced herself to Shannon McKay, the co-founder of He She Ze and We, and gave a summary of their situation.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Have you gotten connected with the medical piece yet?” McKay asked. She explained that, in Virginia, Willow might not have to wait until she turned sixteen to start estrogen. At this news, Willow looked up and made eye contact with her mother, who nodded back.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The conversation turned to politics. Earlier in the week, Glenn Youngkin, the Republican governor of Virginia, had held a town hall on parents&#39; rights at a school in Henrico County. A parent there had urged Youngkin to introduce a ban on gender-transition treatment for minors.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Our governor, just to let you know, has not taken a stance,” McKay, who also has a trans daughter, explained to Chapman. “And I think he&#39;s not conservative enough for the folks that wish he would be.”&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot;

Chapman asked McKay if that gave her some control over how Willow would be treated at school.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“The clincher here is, even if all parents involved do fill out the form and say, &#39;We&#39;re all on board,&#39; school personnel can still say, &#39;I don&#39;t believe in that. I&#39;m not going to do it,&#39; ” McKay said. She did have some good news, however: if Willow learned to drive, she could determine the name and gender on her identification card.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“I&#39;m not ready for it,” Chapman said, referring to the driving.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;“Well, before this governor messes it up, I encourage people to go ahead and get these documents lined up,” McKay said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Chapman got the apartment she and Willow had visited, and a few days later the family moved in. Willow started at her new school on Tuesday, August 22nd. She made friends with another trans girl in the first week. But, despite a letter from Chapman specifying Willow&#39;s name and pronouns, school administrators told her they had to use the name on her registration. She was also told she should use the nurse&#39;s bathroom instead of the girls&#39; bathroom, even though it was on a different floor and might cause her to be late to class. Willow ignored that rule, and asked her mother not to intervene on her behalf.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Before the school year had begun, Chapman told me that if school didn&#39;t work out she would be fine with her daughter getting a GED When I asked Willow about the future, she said that she wants to move to New York City. She wants to go to the balls, “maybe be a model, I don&#39;t know,” she continued. “I like doing art. I like meeting people. I don&#39;t know how to connect all of those things and get paid.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“You care more about personal freedom than hitting a milestone,” Chapman said. “You care less about the traditional high-school things, the traditional college things.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“I feel like I &lt;em>;should&lt;/em>; care about them,” Willow said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Oh!” Chapman said, looking surprised. “I like hearing that.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“I&#39;m open—like, I could potentially care about them, but if it&#39;s not welcoming me then I won&#39;t,” Willow said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The day in August when Willow needed her puberty-blocker shot came and went. The family&#39;s insurance still had not come through, and the earliest appointment Chapman could get at a clinic with tiered pricing was in mid-September. An administrator at the clinic assured her that there was a window with puberty blockers, and that Willow&#39;s voice would not drop overnight.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I talked to Chapman the evening after the appointment. “We thought we were just going in for an intake, but they started Willow on estrogen today,” Chapman told me over the phone. “The doctor was in shock that Willow had been on puberty blockers for two years and that she was almost sixteen.” (“It&#39;s really hard for cis people to fully appreciate the deep destabilizing physical betrayal that these kids are navigating on a day-to-day basis,” the doctor, Stephanie Arnold, told me. “It&#39;s a period where you should be establishing confidence in yourself and your ability to interact with the outside world.”) Willow, Chapman added, “is over the moon.” They called Paul to let him know. “After every fucking thing . 。 。 it just happened,” she said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The following Monday, Chapman started a new job, counselling people on signing up for Medicaid. She was earning less than she had in Nashville, but hoped to rebuild her career as an artist and a community organizer.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;The family was getting to know Richmond, with its restored Victorian row houses and stately parks. Using the hundred dollars from her father, Willow had bought herself a skateboard to get around town. Paul was planning a visit for October. “This city is just dang cute, let&#39;s be honest,” Chapman said. They had found a leftist bookstore where she had bought Willow a book of poetry by trans writers. When I asked Willow how she felt on estrogen, she said that it was too early to discern any changes with clarity; what she felt, she said, was more vulnerable. A little more than a month in, Willow said that she was liking her new school and had even attended the homecoming dance. “And my grades are OK,” she added. “So that&#39;s something.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;On September 28th, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the ban on gender-transition treatment for minors in Tennessee. The court found, among other things, that state legislatures can determine whether the risks of gender dysphoria are less significant than the risks of treating it before a patient turns eighteen. A dissenting opinion stated, “The statutes we consider today discriminate based on sex and gender conformity and intrude on the well-established province of parents to make medical decisions for their minor children.” Because the federal appeals courts have split in their findings, with other circuits finding such bans unconstitutional, the issue has the potential to proceed to the Supreme Court.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“I know what&#39;s going on,” Willow had said, when I asked her about politics. She doesn&#39;t see herself as an activist, though; she prefers to let the news filter through her mother rather than to consume it herself: “She&#39;s my person on the inside.” ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>; &lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/ div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;div>;&lt;div>;&lt;div>;&lt;div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt; /div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 09 Oct 2023 19:06:02 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
