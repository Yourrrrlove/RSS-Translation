>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Brown：“这是一个适合家庭使用的四象限名称！ ”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;King：“学校里的&lt;em>;所有人&lt;/em>;都提交了 Freddy，代表 Freddy Cougar。” （《猛鬼街噩梦》当时很火爆。）&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;CJ 获胜，学生群体开始攻击金，然后金在校车上与布朗结下了不解之缘（校车上曾经有恶霸偷走了布朗的萨克斯管） ）。他们商定的一个细节是：当金穿着 CJ 服装去参加动员大会时，他撞到了一名啦啦队长。 “我们摔倒了，我骑着她穿过地板，”金说。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“就像一张垫子，”布朗指出。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;他们进入了 J. Pierpont Morgan 的豪华图书馆，受到了欢迎由两位衣冠楚楚的书籍和装订策展人杰西·埃里克森和约翰·麦克奎伦设计。该小组凝视着一个陈列柜，里面放着一本打开的古腾堡圣经。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“我们要看哪本书？” King问道。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;McQuillen：“其中一个拉丁文，我忘了它是什么。并非所有内容都被纳入《英皇詹姆斯圣经》。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;布朗：“为了节省时间。”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/ div>;&lt;p>;McQuillen：“这是我们在纸上的好副本。你可以看到——非常闪亮、漂亮。五百年来，它并没有发生太多坏事。我们不能对另外两本说同样的话。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;布朗：“另一本有人在背包里放了很长时间。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;四人转向一个皮革装订的《古腾堡圣经》印在牛皮纸上，策展人询问了这部音乐剧的情况。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;布朗：“这是关于两个人除了一行之外对约翰内斯·古腾堡一无所知的故事。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;布朗：“这是关于两个人，他们对约翰内斯·古腾堡一无所知。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>; p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;King：“他们在 Google 上搜索“约翰内斯·古腾堡”。 ”&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;棕色： “他们制作了一部关于古腾堡一生的史诗般的、类似《悲惨世界》风格的大型音乐剧，但它完全是编造的。”在舞台上，两人为潜在的支持者表演节目，亲自扮演所有角色。乔什·加德和安德鲁·兰内尔斯将在百老汇联合主演。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;金和布朗大学毕业后作为室友开始创作《古腾堡》。金当时正在曼哈顿剧院俱乐部实习，阅读一堆烂泥，他们计划提交他们的假音乐剧，作为一个傻瓜。但他们对自己的工作越来越感兴趣，很快就在正直公民大队表演了。接下来，它去了伦敦和外百老汇，然后去了西班牙（“古腾堡，音乐剧”）、法国（“古腾堡！乐音乐剧”）、韩国（“뮤지컬 구텐버그”）和其他国家。&lt;/p >;&lt;p>;关于古腾堡的大部分信息都来自他的金融家的一份法律文件，他欠该金融家钱。在金和布朗的讲述中，古腾堡是一名酿酒师，他们认为这是他们编造的细节，但他显然是受到了酿酒的启发。歌词示例：“当我今天起床时/历史更加无聊/但后来我以不同的方式思考/现在灵感之鸟正在翱翔。”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor= “inline-recirc”>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;King：“在音乐剧中，镇上没有人能读懂，他对此感到沮丧，有一天晚上他在酿酒时意识到他可以把葡萄拿出来并且——”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;布朗：“‘把字母放在葡萄原来所在的地方！’ ”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;King：“对手是一位修道士，他不想让任何人读书，因为只要没人能读书，圣经就说他所说的。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>; “我认为你的比赛的前提实际上，以一种非常微妙的方式，极其重要，”埃里克森说，并提到了他最近发表的一场演讲。他解释说：“传记和文学史学术通常以这样一种方式构建，即认识论前提基于经验数据，因此它对历史人物做出事实主张。然而，人们从中汲取的大量经验证据，无论是个人的东西，比如日记，还是媒体上发布的东西，在重建一个人的传记的过程中都涉及到很多投机活动。”简而言之，未来的历史学家可能永远不知道金·卡戴珊 (Kim Kardashian) 在想什么。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“就像每个人的杂志简介都会追溯到他们的童年，并假装他们八岁时发生的事情是不祥的， ”金说道。他补充道，“如果你知道剧中的爱人是一个名叫 Helvetica 的角色，你对我们的看法可能会降低。” ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot;

In 2012, a catastrophic traffic collision in Jerusalem left a school bus filled with Palestinian children on fire for more than thirty minutes before emergency workers arrived. In this chronicle of the disaster, Thrall, a Jerusalem-based journalist, follows the father of one of the victims, and examines the response to the crash within the context of modern Palestinian dispossession. He depicts Israel&#39;s “architecture of segregation”—encompassing checkpoints and byzantine transit rules—which needlessly complicated the rescue, leading to a delay that left “small, scorched backpacks” on the asphalt. Thrall&#39;s account is a powerful evocation of a two-tiered society that treats children as potential combatants.&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;The Rigor of Angels by William Egginton.&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65131330beba73981475b61a/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/231009_r43131web.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65131330beba73981475b61a/master/w_120,c_limit/231009_r43131web.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65131330beba73981475b61a/master/w_240,c_limit/231009_r43131web.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65131330beba73981475b61a/master/w_320,c_limit/231009_r43131web.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65131330beba73981475b61a/master/w_640,c_limit/231009_r43131web.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65131330beba73981475b61a/master/w_960,c_limit/231009_r43131web.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65131330beba73981475b61a/master/w_1280,c_limit/231009_r43131web.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65131330beba73981475b61a/master/w_1600,c_limit/231009_r43131web.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;p >;&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Rigor-Angels-Heisenberg-Ultimate-Reality/dp/0593316304&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Rigor-Angels-Heisenberg-Ultimate-Reality/dp/0593316304&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Rigor-Angels-Heisenberg-Ultimate-Reality/dp/0593316304&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;&lt;strong>;The Rigor of Angels&lt;/strong>;&lt;/a>;&lt;em>;, by William Egginton (Pantheon)&lt;/em>;. In this sprightly intellectual history, Egginton explores the lives of the philosopher Immanuel Kant, the writer Jorge Luis Borges, and the physicist Werner Heisenberg in order to plumb some of the most profound questions of physics and philosophy: the limits of knowledge, the structure of space and time, free will. These thinkers&#39; battles against “metaphysical prejudices” resulted in complementary, if counterintuitive, insights into the nature of reality; though working in different realms, all three concluded that “we are, and ever will be, active participants in the universe we discover.” While detailing his subjects&#39; theories, Egginton also foregrounds their relationships, suggesting that world-shaping ideas can be inspired by the vagaries of emotional life.&lt;/p>;&lt;hr />;&lt;h2 >;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/best-books-2023&quot;>;The Best Books of 2023&lt;/a>;&lt;/h2>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;Briefly Noted Book Reviews&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/63d16763c44837936a5fb854/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/bestbooks-header-2023-desktop.png&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/63d16763c44837936a5fb854/master/w_120,c_limit/bestbooks-header-2023-desktop.png 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/63d16763c44837936a5fb854/master/w_240,c_limit/bestbooks-header-2023-desktop.png 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/63d16763c44837936a5fb854/master/w_320,c_limit/bestbooks-header-2023-desktop.png 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/63d16763c44837936a5fb854/master/w_640,c_limit/bestbooks-header-2023-desktop.png 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/63d16763c44837936a5fb854/master/w_960,c_limit/bestbooks-header-2023-desktop.png 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/63d16763c44837936a5fb854/master/w_1280,c_limit/bestbooks-header-2023-desktop.png 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/63d16763c44837936a5fb854/master/w_1600,c_limit/bestbooks-header-2023-desktop.png 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;p >;&lt;em>;Read our reviews of the year&#39;s notable new fiction and nonfiction.&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>;&lt;hr />;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;The Fraud by Zadie Smith.&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6513133462e026a283cb2cc9/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/231009_r43132web.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6513133462e026a283cb2cc9/master/w_120,c_limit/231009_r43132web.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6513133462e026a283cb2cc9/master/w_240,c_limit/231009_r43132web.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6513133462e026a283cb2cc9/master/w_320,c_limit/231009_r43132web.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6513133462e026a283cb2cc9/master/w_640,c_limit/231009_r43132web.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6513133462e026a283cb2cc9/master/w_960,c_limit/231009_r43132web.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6513133462e026a283cb2cc9/master/w_1280,c_limit/231009_r43132web.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6513133462e026a283cb2cc9/master/w_1600,c_limit/231009_r43132web.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;b4hqv&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;o6b6uf&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Fraud-Novel-Zadie-Smith/dp/0525558969&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Fraud-Novel-Zadie-Smith/dp/0525558969&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Fraud-Novel-Zadie-Smith/dp/0525558969&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;&lt;strong>;The Fraud&lt;/strong>;&lt;/a>;&lt;em>;, by Zadie Smith (Penguin Press)&lt;/em>;. This kaleidoscopic novel revolves around the real-life trial of a man who, in late-nineteenth-century London, claimed to be the heir to a fortune. Smith relates the impressions of a housekeeper as she observes others&#39; opinions of the case, which transfixed—and split—the public, and was complicated by the testimony of a formerly enslaved man from Jamaica. The sprawling story is filled with jabs at the hypocrisy of the upper class, characters who doubt institutions, and corollaries of the pugilistic rhetoric of contemporary populism; with characteristic brilliance, Smith makes the many parts of the tale cohere. “Human error and venality are everywhere, churches are imperfect, cruelty is common, power corrupt, the weak go to the wall,” the housekeeper reflects.&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;Console by Colin Channer.&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/651313381181474410ec91ac/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/231009_r43133web.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/651313381181474410ec91ac/master/w_120,c_limit/231009_r43133web.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/651313381181474410ec91ac/master/w_240,c_limit/231009_r43133web.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/651313381181474410ec91ac/master/w_320,c_limit/231009_r43133web.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/651313381181474410ec91ac/master/w_640,c_limit/231009_r43133web.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/651313381181474410ec91ac/master/w_960,c_limit/231009_r43133web.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/651313381181474410ec91ac/master/w_1280,c_limit/231009_r43133web.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/651313381181474410ec91ac/master/w_1600,c_limit/231009_r43133web.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;p >;&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Console-Poems-Colin-Channer/dp/0374607222&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Console-Poems-Colin-Channer/dp/0374607222&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Console-Poems-Colin-Channer/dp/0374607222&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Console&lt;/strong>;&lt;/a>;&lt;em>;, by Colin Channer (Farrar, Straus &amp;amp; Giroux)&lt;/em>;. Music is a vital force in this eclectic poetry collection, which travels between the author&#39;s native Jamaica, his adopted home of New England, and other locales. Dub and reggae inspire and inform Channer&#39;s dense, lushly textured compositions. Contemplating place and displacement, the poems emphasize the palimpsestic, remix-like effect produced by emigration and exile: the memory of a left-behind landscape merging with its current reality, as well as with environments more foreign to the transplant. Elegiac underpinnings give way to lyrical exuberance: as Channer writes in “Redoubt,” a poem set against the ruins of Lee (Scratch) Perry&#39;s famed recording studio, “Suffer was a genre, / keening took into his console / then put out.”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;irxv3&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 02 Oct 2023 18:06:01 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Among the Cabin Fanatics of Mississippi’s Giant Houseparty]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/10/09/among-the-cabin-fanatics-of-mississippis-giant-houseparty]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-02T10:00:00.000Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65173c96bec0ec46cd34754b/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/231009_r43123.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;article >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attribute-verso-pattern=&quot;article-body&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;ArticlePageChunks&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;The Neshoba County Fair calls itself Mississippi&#39;s Giant Houseparty, because every year the same families return, antlike, to five hundred and ninety-seven individually owned, festively painted cabins there. For a week at the end of July, even many who live nearby move to the fairgrounds, creating an instant community of twenty thousand people, three times larger than the population of the county seat, Philadelphia. The fair, founded in the late eighteen-hundreds in the remote east-central part of the state, has survived two World Wars, the Great Depression, and the coronavirus pandemic because the cabin owners could not bear to give it up. After spraying for bugs, touching up the paint, hanging porch swings, washing linens, changing light bulbs, making beds, and stocking refrigerators (some cabins have four), the families hold the equivalent of Thanksgiving—seven times. There are food hangovers, and hangover hangovers, and children everywhere, only nobody goes home.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;A lightly occupied fair cabin sleeps twenty-six; some sleep sixty. Upper floors resemble bunkhouses: bed after bed after bed. The fair is not the place for introverts, neat freaks, sensitives, or anyone who cannot tolerate unrelenting, bone-deep heat. Central air-conditioning is heresy, as is television. Did the fair&#39;s founders watch “American Ninja Warrior”? They did not. Indoor plumbing and electricity are acceptable—fans and window units blow wide open. This year, during the hottest month in human history, I stepped into a frigid, empty-looking bedroom and was startled when a teen-ager rose from an upper bunk in a ghillie suit of blankets.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Cabin dwellers, like Burning Man fanatics, plan their lives around the fair. Cabin 185 is called Mump&#39;s Place because its late matriarch reportedly “thought about the fair for fifty weeks out of the year,” then kept detailed notes on what everybody ate and where they slept. Casseroles are cooked and frozen weeks in advance. The Minshews, of Cabin 1, are so eager for caramel cake, a family fair specialty, that they start eating it before they&#39;ve finished unloading their cars. Diehards have not missed a fair since Franklin D. Roosevelt was President. Carrie Stokes Atkinson, of Cabin 351, was six weeks old when she attended her first fair, in 1988; she was seventeen when she was crowned Miss Neshoba County at the fair; she was thirty-four when, last year, her water broke at the fair, on the kitchen floor. She pointed out the exact spot to me while a meal was in progress, as one always seems to be. Someone said, “People have gotten married at the fair,” and someone else said, “Marriages have ended out here, too.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The fair started as a one-day picnic in 1889, when some families met to compare and share their livestock, field crops, garden vegetables, and crafts. As the event grew, fairgoers debated advances in farming and delivered discourses: “How I Beat the Boll Weevil.” They competed in home-economics contests—best axe handle, best sponge cake, best “homespun dress made during the Great Civil War”—for prize overalls or ten dollars in gold. Exhibits showcased fertilizer and a mechanical cotton chopper. “All these things that promote agriculture and horticulture help build up the country,” the Neshoba &lt;em>;Democrat&lt;/em>; noted.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;GenericCallout&quot;>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;Familyowned cabins with cars parked on the lawns out front.&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65173cb7d5d8efe5ebe5c06f/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/231009_r43153.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65173cb7d5d8efe5ebe5c06f/master/w_120,c_limit/231009_r43153.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65173cb7d5d8efe5ebe5c06f/master/w_240,c_limit/231009_r43153.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65173cb7d5d8efe5ebe5c06f/master/w_320,c_limit/231009_r43153.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65173cb7d5d8efe5ebe5c06f/master/w_640,c_limit/231009_r43153.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65173cb7d5d8efe5ebe5c06f/master/w_960,c_limit/231009_r43153.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65173cb7d5d8efe5ebe5c06f/master/w_1280,c_limit/231009_r43153.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65173cb7d5d8efe5ebe5c06f/master/w_1600,c_limit/231009_r43153.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;The cabins generally pass down through families. Modern amenities are frowned upon: “They&#39;re putting Sheetrock in there,” a fairgoer said, ruefully, of recent remodels.&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;The first cabins were raw-plank shanties, often made with repurposed materials. Sixty-five of them ultimately faced and surrounded a pavilion, which became known as Founders Square. The governor spoke there in 1896, and every governor is said to have spoken there since. In 1898, the square was seeded with oaks, whose roots spread and surfaced, like keloid scars.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Most cabins are narrow and deep, set, at most, several feet apart. The founders added second floors as their families grew, then built more and taller cabins around the square. The cabins radiated out, forming “streets” and “neighborhoods”: Happy Hollow, Sunset Strip. Seventy-four cabins front the red clay horse-racing track; when the starting bugle sounds, quarter and dollar bettors crowd the balconies and porches.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;In keeping with the founders, many cabin owners pride themselves on building and decorating with salvaged or scavenged materials. A tire store became a cabin; the tin roof of a teardown became a kitchen ceiling. Newer cabins are frequently built with concrete blocks and aluminum siding, substances less susceptible to fire and rot. Owners distinguish themselves through color—there are cabins painted orange, turquoise, fuchsia, canary yellow with pink polka dots—and no two are alike. Robert Craycroft, a former architecture professor at Mississippi State University, has called the mishmash “Fairhouse vernacular.” The cabins are festooned with string lights and paper lanterns; in the blue hour, when the moon rises and the crickets start up, they twinkle like an extension of the midway. At Cabin 203, white bulbs spell out “&lt;em >;BIG DADDY&lt;/em>;,” Broadway style. Across the track, there&#39;s “&lt;em >;POPS&lt;/em>;.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;The fair starts on a Friday and ends the next Friday at midnight. Ten days later, the electricity and water are cut. For the fifty-one-week off-season, the fairgrounds “resemble nothing so much as an abandoned Colorado mining town,” Craycroft wrote. “A civilized place absent its civilization.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Every cabin is required to have a porch. Families loll there, play music there, eat there, entertain there, gossip there, lose at cards there, sleep there. For some, the porch &lt;em>;is&lt;/em>; the fair. In 1986, Ellen Johnson Spendrup, who attended her first fair in 1900, at age two, said that she liked “sitting on my porch with my feet up, in my rocking chair, watching the idiots pass.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;On Fair Saturday, Don DeWeese was on his porch at Cabin 32, a powder-blue two-story with white trim and patriotic bunting. He comes from a prosperous old Neshoba County family and now lives in Memphis. Relatives had travelled from as far away as Texas and North Carolina—they spilled off the porch and into Founders Square. Decades ago, Stanley Dearman, a former editor of the &lt;em>;Democrat&lt;/em>;, wrote that fair people “take seriously” the art of “eating and talking.” DeWeese, who is seventy-eight, got started on the latter, volunteering that he has “the largest one-owner, one-location doughnut shop in the United States,” and that his forebears “invented plywood out of pine”; he&#39;s had homes in Colorado and the Caymans; he stays at the Baccarat when in New York; one of his “closest friends” is Wynonna Judd, and his “closest friend,” the professional wrestler Jerry Lawler, was, that very day, receiving a lifetime-achievement award from the Tennessee Sports Hall of Fame.

The fair is “a reunion—of your life,” he explained. “I see all my old high-school classmates. I see my old girlfriends. I already hugged one today. I see people I went to kindergarten through college with.” When he found out that I was born and raised two hours north—Oxford; Tupelo—he said, “Girl, I &lt;em>;married&lt;/em>; Miss Tupelo! And her sister was Miss Mississippi!” He hollered over a shoulder, “Rita! Where&#39;s Rita?”&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;DeWeese wanted to show me his cabin. On the way inside, he pointed out an original watercolor by the Mississippi artist Wyatt Waters. It hangs above all the people sitting on his porch at the fair—and depicts a bunch of people sitting on a porch at the fair. Downstairs consisted largely of an open kitchen and an eating area, with a picnic table and a concrete floor. After introducing me to a granddaughter from Asheville who performs “Hamilton” numbers “amazin&#39; ” and to a man who had competed in that morning&#39;s Heart o&#39; Dixie triathlon, he climbed steep, narrow stairs and pushed open a battered plywood door, revealing a room of wall-to-wall beds.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Daylight knifed through gaps in the plank walls. Suitcases and a monogrammed tote lay open on the floor. Someone said, “Sh-hh!” Several adults and children were in there, trying to nap before the evening&#39;s events. The fair&#39;s daytime population swells at night, when a live band plays the grandstand, at the racetrack. The fair hosts entertainers who are said to be on their way up, or down. Loretta Lynn, George Strait, Lester Flatt, Patsy Cline, Tammy Wynette, Ronnie Milsap, Lee Ann Womack, Molly Hatchet, the Charlie Daniels Band, and Trace Adkins all performed at the fair. Jerry Lee Lewis appeared there in 1957, just before releasing “Great Balls of Fire.” June Carter performed before she married Johnny Cash. Dolly Parton never played the fair, but her sister Stella did. The fair can&#39;t afford Morgan Wallen, though it was able to book one of his collaborators, the singer-songwriter Niko Moon.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;DeWeese declared Fair Saturday “the No. 1 night of the year, to a teen-ager in central Mississippi.” Girls planned their outfits for months: “I expect &#39;em to come in here in short shorts and cowboy boots, and titties showin&#39;.” The previous night, a visitor from Los Angeles had stumbled, drunk, into a cabin at the north end of the racetrack and commented on all the “pretty bitches” he had seen. One of the men in residence informed him, “Down here, we refer to them as &#39;ladies.&#39; ”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Cabin 220, the color of a ripe banana, sits just beyond Founders Square, at the entrance to Happy Hollow, the fair&#39;s first “suburb,” a short stretch of cabins separated by a sawdust-covered footpath. When I came across it, the owners, William and Barbie Bassett, and their daughter, Gracie, were sitting, where else, on the porch. Barbie, a former television meteorologist, had written “92°” on a whiteboard—the daily Faircast.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Not long ago, cabins were known to sell for as little as a few thousand dollars. “This is a camp house, not a condo,” William said. Lately, some families have been spending more than it would cost to buy an actual Neshoba County home. Fairgoers love gossiping about it. The Bassetts had heard that a two-story cabin recently sold for a hundred and eighty-nine thousand dollars; they told me that the new owners gutted it and painted it Pepto Bismol pink with green racing stripes. Another went for three hundred and ninety thousand dollars; the buyers planned to raze it and rebuild, higher. “She&#39;s an interior designer, and her husband&#39;s in real estate,” Barbie said. “It&#39;s gonna be the Taj Mahal of the fair.”&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;Two teenagers wearing cowboy boots stand beside another seated on a bench.

Neighbors disdained the newcomers&#39; “massive” television; worse, they kept their door closed. “Not to have your cabin open is kind of tacky,” one neighbor told me.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Cabin people, traditionally, are hospitality extremists. At the fair, I was offered water, lemonade, iced tea, beer, Gatorade, a souvenir apron, boiled shrimp, homemade ice cream, a pork chop, a taco, a bed, a toilet, the remains of a funnel cake, a book about doughnuts, an introduction to “some really obnoxious cousins,” two ibuprofens, two more ibuprofens, help “fixing” a traffic ticket (offer declined), and numerous iterations of chicken. Gail Long, who is eighty and has been a fair person since girlhood, told me about the time her mother invited a visitor to help herself to supper at Cabin 271, and then to dessert. After the woman left, Gail and her sisters asked, “Who was that lady?” Their mother said, “I thought &lt;em>;y&#39;all&lt;/em>; knew her.” A late-night reveller once happened into Cabin 19 and obliviously ate raw meat loaf out of the refrigerator; the fridge is now divided into sections marked “&lt;em >;PREP&lt;/em>;” and “&lt;em >;DRUNK&lt;/em>;.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;This year, Cabin 19&#39;s twice-daily buffet stretched from its single stove all the way to the front porch. Roxanna McCarty, who runs the culinary operation with a rotating staff of eight, prepared “fried green tomatoes, fried okra, fried squash, fresh tomatoes, cream corn, fruit—we come in here and deseed everything—and pasta salad. We do black-eyed peas, green beans, lady peas, and butter beans every day. Devilled eggs at every shift. We did five pork loins, six turkey breasts. We had brisket. We had racks of ribs. We had Boston butts and ham. We had chicken and dumplings, chicken and dressing, lasagna.” McCarty cuts her okra lengthwise, instead of in rounds; it tastes “more okra-y” that way. The weather was so hot her green tomatoes turned red.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Cabin 19 served more than six hundred plates this year. McCarty told me, “Just here today, we&#39;ve seen kids whose mother is in jail, they&#39;re on welfare, they&#39;re living in foster care. We have a president of a big company, we have single mothers, we have people that run their own house-cleaning business, we have people that flew in here on a private plane. Every walk of life is here.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The fair has a board that functions almost like a municipal government, overseeing the budget and making policy: parking, garbage. Gate and cabin fees generate the operating revenue; the Neshoba County Fair Association, the nonprofit that runs the fair, took in eight million dollars between 2017 and 2022. Cabin owners pay the association up to five hundred dollars annually per cabin, and fifty dollars per air-conditioner. During the fair, the utility bill alone totals half a million dollars.&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;a data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a26446&amp;quot;}&quot;

The cabins tend to pass down through families, making the fair largely a self-perpetuating, closed system. “The old saw here is that, in a divorce, people fight harder over the cabin than the children,” Sid Salter, a well-known columnist and Neshoba native, who co-owns Cabin 16, told me. Most sales happen privately, by word of mouth. An owner may not sell, rent, raze, rebuild, or renovate a cabin without the association&#39;s permission. C. Scott Bounds, a state legislator and the fair&#39;s president, recalled a former colleague who discouraged change by saying, “We ain&#39;t never done it like &#39;at before.” Kevin Cheatham, the fair&#39;s manager, said, “We try to keep things as simple as possible.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In 1980, the National Register of Historic Places added the fairgrounds to its list, describing the institution&#39;s contributions to “this very rural region of Mississippi” as “immeasurable.” By then, the fair was approaching sewer capacity, and there were concerns about inauthenticity: the newer sections contained too many modern amenities for some people&#39;s taste. “They&#39;re putting &lt;em>;Sheetrock&lt;/em>; in there,” DeWeese told me. The fair stopped adding cabins in 1982.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The fair has a daily newspaper, the &lt;em>;Fair Times&lt;/em>;, which is published by the &lt;em>;Democrat&lt;/em>;. An annual profusion of advertising makes it thicker than some actual newspapers. The &lt;em>;Fair Times&lt;/em>; overwhelmingly consists of photographs of fairgoers in situ. How else is everyone supposed to know that Cabin 612 hosts a “Golden Girls”-themed bunco night; Cabin 755 won a giant stuffed banana; Cabin 163 (“The Plaza on the Fairgrounds”) puts on an “Eloise”-themed tea party with antique dishes; Caleb Mayfield lost a tooth; and Kenny (Slick) Hillman fixed a weed-eater? Kids beg to have their picture taken. It is on record that this year&#39;s fair was attended by Azlee, Bensley, Payzlee, Rhettley, Easton, Creeth, Halen, Tuff, Collyns, Kollyns, Jacks, Jax, Kelby, Karsten, Karter, Jagger, Bayleigh, Everleigh, Hadleigh, Jayleigh, Mosleigh, Ryleigh, Maverick, Banks, Anistyn, Gracyn, Hudsyn, Hollyn, Lakelyn, Rylen, Aspen, Aspin, and multiple Baylors.&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;A group of people hold up signs that read Brandon Presley for Mississippi.&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65173cd656b28cf163e2263e/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/231009_r43150.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65173cd656b28cf163e2263e/master/w_120,c_limit/231009_r43150.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65173cd656b28cf163e2263e/master/w_240,c_limit/231009_r43150.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65173cd656b28cf163e2263e/master/w_320,c_limit/231009_r43150.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65173cd656b28cf163e2263e/master/w_640,c_limit/231009_r43150.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65173cd656b28cf163e2263e/master/w_960,c_limit/231009_r43150.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65173cd656b28cf163e2263e/master/w_1280,c_limit/231009_r43150.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65173cd656b28cf163e2263e/master/w_1600,c_limit/231009_r43150.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;The fair has been called “the Carnegie Hall of stump speaking.”&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;p >;Outsiders have never been quite sure what to make of the fair. “It&#39;s a deal where, if you&#39;re not born to it, it doesn&#39;t make a lot of sense,” Salter told me. “Sometimes when you &lt;em>;are&lt;/em>; born into it, it doesn&#39;t make a lot of sense.” Joyce Ellis, of Cabin 351, sees her busy teen-age granddaughters here and there throughout the year, but “the week of the fair? I&#39;m with my grandkids for &lt;em>;eight days&lt;/em>;.” People who might otherwise reject the density of a city are piled on top of one another, each neighbor reliant on the next. Children are often unaware that they are being watched by other people&#39;s parents. Atkinson, also of Cabin 351, still doesn&#39;t know who ratted her out, as a teen-ager, for kissing a boy and drinking Zima. Cabin owners accept that if their place catches fire the fair will bulldoze it without hesitation, at their expense, to prevent flames from reaching their neighbors. “The idea of subordinating individual liberties for the common good is a theme that many would view as suspiciously unpatriotic,” Craycroft, one of the few scholars who have studied the fair, observed. “But, these fierce defenders of individual property rights have, in effect, established a commune.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In 1980, &lt;em>;National Geographic&lt;/em>; published “Mississippi&#39;s Grand Reunion,” a thirteen-page feature on the fair. At the time, the US was emerging from a gasoline shortage, and around twenty-four per cent of Mississippians lived in poverty, the highest rate in the nation, but the article depicted unmitigated bliss. The fair displayed an enlarged copy at Exhibit Hall, alongside award-winning fruits. The state legislature passed a resolution congratulating the author, a native of Kosciusko, Mississippi, for her exceedingly positive portrayal of the fair&#39;s “good will and gracious fellowship.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Several weeks after the &lt;em>;National Geographic&lt;/em>; piece appeared, Ronald Reagan, in the midst of his Presidential campaign, showed up at the fair. Mississippi&#39;s politicians had long recognized that the fair provided an opportunity to address thousands of voters in one place—and just before the August primaries—but Reagan was the first national candidate to visit. More than thirty thousand spectators piled into the fairgrounds to watch. Reagan, who wore an open-collared dress shirt, charmed the audience by talking about Ole Miss football and John Wayne. He then moved on to inflation and a critique of public welfare, invoking his support of “states&#39; rights,” a euphemism for white supremacy which had been adopted to justify slavery and Jim Crow laws, and which political operatives had used to exploit racial tension in the South. After Reagan won, John Bell Williams, a segregationist former governor of Mississippi and a five-term US congressman, declared, “I&#39;m happy to say we have a President now who talks our language.”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;1hvc8s&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;The fair has been called “the Carnegie Hall of stump speaking” and “Republican Woodstock.” Candidates address fairgoers in short bursts, three mornings in a row. In November, Mississippi will hold a gubernatorial election; Brandon Presley, a Democrat and Elvis&#39;s second cousin, who is a state public-service commissioner, has mounted a surprisingly strong campaign against the Republican incumbent, Tate Reeves. At the fair, the more urgent race was the Republican primary for lieutenant governor. The leading challenger to the popular incumbent, Delbert Hosemann, was a &lt;em >;MAGA&lt;/em>; state senator, Chris McDaniel.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;On the morning of Hosemann&#39;s and McDaniel&#39;s speeches, I found a seat on a long wooden pew toward the front of the pavilion. McDaniel&#39;s small, noisy scrum of backers sat nearby. McDaniel characterized Hosemann as a liberal, and falsely accused him of having been the vice-president of an abortion clinic. (Hosemann is a devout Catholic.) McDaniel said that Democrats “seek the end of this country as we know it,” adding, “Why would you ever reach across the aisle to those people?” He urged voters to “establish sovereignty again in this state” and described himself as a “proud disciple of Ronald Reagan—and, yes, Donald Trump!”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Hosemann, he went on, had “never endorsed Donald Trump for a single thing.” In 2017, when Trump&#39;s Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity sought information on Mississippi&#39;s registered voters, Hosemann famously told the commission that it could “go jump in the Gulf of Mexico.” Onstage, Hosemann called McDaniel “despicable.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;After the speeches, I strolled over to Salter&#39;s cabin, which faces the pavilion. Salter, a respected conservative who has watched the stumping since he was a boy, said, “When I was about fifteen, it occurred to me that all the things that were challenging about the state of Mississippi sort of stemmed from the fact that we were a monolithic, one-party state. At that time, the monolith was the Democratic Party—it controlled everything from the capitol to city hall to the courthouse. Every board, every commission, every facet of the legislature.” (Historically, Mississippi Democrats were Democrats in the sense that Lincoln was a Republican.) “If there was going to be reform, or change,” Salter said, “we needed a viable two-party system.”&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;A harness racer poses near the stables.&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65173cc47ef26f0f1de69b1d/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/231009_r43151.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65173cc47ef26f0f1de69b1d/master/w_120,c_limit/231009_r43151.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65173cc47ef26f0f1de69b1d/master/w_240,c_limit/231009_r43151.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65173cc47ef26f0f1de69b1d/master/w_320,c_limit/231009_r43151.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65173cc47ef26f0f1de69b1d/master/w_640,c_limit/231009_r43151.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65173cc47ef26f0f1de69b1d/master/w_960,c_limit/231009_r43151.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65173cc47ef26f0f1de69b1d/master/w_1280,c_limit/231009_r43151.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65173cc47ef26f0f1de69b1d/master/w_1600,c_limit/231009_r43151.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;A harness racer, near the stables, one of the few places at the fair with a sizable Black presence.&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;p >;After Reagan&#39;s appearance, the designations began to shift; in 1992, Mississippi elected its first Republican governor in more than a hundred years, and the GOP became the monolith. The Party has since fractured into virulent strains. In 2014, McDaniel tried to unseat the US senator Thad Cochran; several of McDaniel&#39;s supporters were criminally charged in a plot to sneak into Cochran&#39;s wife&#39;s room at a nursing home, where she was bedridden with dementia. The plan was to film her and then accuse Cochran of having an extramarital affair while his wife was dying. A blogger, Clayton Kelly, was later sentenced to more than two years in prison for recording her in bed and posting the footage online.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Cochran prevailed, but McDaniel got uncomfortably close. Hosemann later noted that toward the end of the primary for lieutenant governor the McDaniel campaign pulled in nearly a million dollars in dark money. Salter told me, “The division in the country makes a guy like McDaniel dangerous, if he&#39;s got cash.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Later on the day of his speech, McDaniel somehow wound up in Cabin 22, on Founders Square, perhaps unaware that one of the families that own it, the Molpuses, are prominent Democrats. (Dick Molpus served as secretary of state from 1984 to 1996.) A Molpus relative delivered this news politely; McDaniel left. In 2016, when Donald Trump, Jr., appeared at the fair as a surrogate for his father, a woman goose-stepped in Founders Square. Democrats, vastly outnumbered, are relegated to such small acts of resistance. Standing on a supporter&#39;s porch, Trump assured voters that his father was a “blue-collar billionaire,” then gushed about fairgoers being able to “hang out with the Mannings.” Olivia Williams Manning, who, with Archie Manning, spawned an NFL dynasty, is from an old Neshoba County family—Cabins 14, 56, 82, 202, and 631.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The fair&#39;s inaugural picnic took place twenty-four years after the end of the Civil War. One of the founders was a Confederate veteran. In 1928, the second-place winner in one of the races was a horse named Ku Klux Klan. The pavilion has hosted a succession of segregationist governors and congressmen, and open support for the “Lost Cause” more or less continues to this day. On backstreets at this year&#39;s fair, at least six cabins flew the Confederate flag. The fair allows it.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Whenever I asked fairgoers about race, even some of the liberals appeared stumped, as if it should be obvious that an institution that started as a family affair among white people would remain just that. All eleven of this year&#39;s Miss Neshoba County contestants were white. All but a few of the thousand-plus faces in the &lt;em>;Fair Times&lt;/em>; snapshots were white. At the late-night sing-along, “Dixie” is still in the lineup.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;One afternoon, I came across a Black woman standing behind a cabin, staring at the midway. She was the only person of color I had seen that day. Her name was Larhonda Boswell, and she worked as a home health aide for one of the cabin owners. She in no way feared her employers, but her mother had warned her about wandering around the fair alone at night, even dressed in scrubs. Boswell had thought little of it until that morning, when, as she walked in from the parking lot, a couple of men had given her such a hard look that she prayed to Jesus for protection. She told me, “Baby, times ain&#39;t changed.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;After the US Supreme Court ordered school integration, in 1954, Mississippi, where almost half the population was Black, refused to comply. The following year, white supremacists in the Delta, a couple of hours northwest of Neshoba County, abducted Emmett Till, a Black fourteen-year-old from Chicago who was visiting family; he had supposedly whistled at a white woman after walking into her store to buy candy. The kidnappers tortured and murdered Till, then threw his body, weighted with an industrial fan, into the Tallahatchie River. In an act that galvanized the civil-rights movement, Till&#39;s mother held an open-casket funeral and allowed the magazine &lt;em>;Jet&lt;/em>; to photograph her child&#39;s crushed skull, broken wrists, and gouged-out eye.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;ib5xb&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;The Klan recruited in Neshoba County to such a degree that its opponents quietly warned newcomers not to accept any fish-fry invitations without first asking around. One cabin owner told me, “That was the recruitment tactic of the KKK—you feed &#39;em and then you scare &#39;em.” In early 1964, as civil-rights groups prepared for Freedom Summer, the drive to register Mississippi&#39;s Black voters, the Klan burned twelve crosses in Neshoba County in a single night, one at the courthouse. On June 21st, James Chaney, a Black Mississippian, and his fellow civil-rights workers Michael Schwerner and Andrew Goodman, white Jews from New York, went to Neshoba County anyway, to investigate the torching of a church. When they failed to return to their home base, in Meridian, FBI agents descended on Neshoba and found their burned-out station wagon in a swamp.&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;A family poses on a red clay horse track.&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65173cc754de28b11496af1b/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/231009_r43152.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65173cc754de28b11496af1b/master/w_120,c_limit/231009_r43152.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65173cc754de28b11496af1b/master/w_240,c_limit/231009_r43152.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65173cc754de28b11496af1b/master/w_320,c_limit/231009_r43152.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65173cc754de28b11496af1b/master/w_640,c_limit/231009_r43152.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65173cc754de28b11496af1b/master/w_960,c_limit/231009_r43152.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65173cc754de28b11496af1b/master/w_1280,c_limit/231009_r43152.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65173cc754de28b11496af1b/master/w_1600,c_limit/231009_r43152.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;Seventy-four cabins front the red clay horse track. During the races, quarter and dollar bettors crowd the balconies and porches.&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;p >;For the next forty-two days, federal agents and four hundred sailors from Meridian&#39;s naval base searched for the three men. Some white people in Neshoba County decided that the missing-persons case was a hoax, even after the FBI found the men&#39;s bodies buried in a red-dirt dam. The sheriff and his chief deputy, a Klan member, were ultimately arrested, along with a KKK grand wizard and sixteen others.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The fair opened five days after the bodies were discovered, on August 9th. A small plane, its tail number obscured, dropped Klan leaflets that “attempted to portray the civil rights workers as Communist Revolutionaries, un-godly atheists and traitors,” Steven H. Stubbs wrote in “Mississippi&#39;s Giant Houseparty,” an eight-hundred-and-eighteen-page chronology of the fair. The next day, at the pavilion, a local leader of the John Birch Society received a standing ovation after delivering a “ranting attack on the Federal government.” Another speaker referred viciously to the NAACP Molpus, fourteen at the time, was there. “I looked around and thought, I&#39;m on another planet,” he told me. The reaction was part of the reason he got into politics. It wasn&#39;t until 1989 that any of Mississippi&#39;s elected officials apologized publicly to the families of Chaney, Schwerner, and Goodman. The acknowledgment came from Molpus.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Trent Brown, a professor of American studies at the Missouri University of Science and Technology, has noted, “The fair represents a paradox that most white Mississippians have yet to grasp: their cherished celebrations of family and community cannot be separated from the state&#39;s racialist past.” Molpus told me, “Those paradoxes are everywhere, not just at the fair. There are both noble calls to the angels of our better nature and far-right racist demagogues who speak to the dark and evil side. Such is life in the real world.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;One afternoon, I stopped by the fair&#39;s stables to see Walter Miller, a racing champion who had just come off the track and was cooling down two of his horses, American Sportsman and Fusion Five. Miller, who is in his sixties, had owned a trail-riding business in coastal Mississippi until a friend advised him to upgrade to harness racing, a sport that makes use of what are essentially chariots. Miller learned that a winning horse can potentially earn a hundred thousand dollars or more in its lifetime. About twenty years ago, he began racing at the Neshoba County Fair.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In Mississippi, unlike in Northern states, almost all harness-racing owners and drivers, including Miller, are Black. Their relatives and fans unfold lawn chairs near the stables just before two in the afternoon, when the first race starts, and stay until the last team crosses the finish line, hours later. This is the only time when there is a sizable number of Black people at the fair. They rarely visit the cabins or walk through Founders Square, or stroll around looking at porches. After the races, they pack up and leave, and come back again the next day.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In Miller&#39;s view, racism at the fair had improved. He told me, “There&#39;s progress. All the Black guys used to be up at the top of the hill, in the corner.” He meant the racing teams. His crew is assigned to the stables closest to the racetrack. Of the organizers, he said, “The way they look at it is, this is their building, their land. They control it the way they want.” Miller&#39;s business partner, Trenlon Harris, was standing at Fusion Five&#39;s sweaty right flank, listening. “It&#39;s a slow process,” he said. “This is still Mississippi. Count your victories, however small they are.”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;GenericCallout&quot;>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;Brittany and Derrick Reed newlyweds in their thirties at Cabin 8.&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65173cca6a07ec7575029dba/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/231009_r43148.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65173cca6a07ec7575029dba/master/w_120,c_limit/231009_r43148.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65173cca6a07ec7575029dba/master/w_240,c_limit/231009_r43148.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65173cca6a07ec7575029dba/master/w_320,c_limit/231009_r43148.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65173cca6a07ec7575029dba/master/w_640,c_limit/231009_r43148.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65173cca6a07ec7575029dba/master/w_960,c_limit/231009_r43148.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65173cca6a07ec7575029dba/master/w_1280,c_limit/231009_r43148.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65173cca6a07ec7575029dba/master/w_1600,c_limit/231009_r43148.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;Brittany and Derrick Reed, newlyweds in their thirties, at Cabin 8.

Brittany, who is white, teaches special education; Derrick, who is Black, is a personal banker at Wells Fargo. The cabin first belonged to Brittany&#39;s paternal grandfather. She said, “This is, I would say, &lt;em>;the&lt;/em>; most important place to me. It holds more memories than anyplace else. There&#39;s just a peace and a slowness about it.” A young relative was showing the grownups a moth in her palm; another was running around with a cluster of yellow balloons.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;This was Derrick&#39;s second fair, and his first as Brittany&#39;s husband. Before the first visit, he was “a little nervous,” he told me. “And his family was nervous,” Brittany said. “Yes, super nervous,” Derrick said. His mother, an Alabamian, was primarily worried about her son&#39;s acceptance within Brittany&#39;s family, which had included some older members who, as Brittany carefully put it, never “stepped out of their bubble.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In Alabama, Derrick attended predominantly white schools, and most of his friends are white; Brittany briefly worked as a missionary in Niger before teaching in Birmingham&#39;s city schools. Individually, and as a couple, they were accustomed to spending time in various bubbles. At their first fair together, they told me, the only awkwardness had involved premarital sleeping arrangements.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Because cabins pass down within large, branching families, they inevitably accumulate numerous owners. The descendants of founders (Foxes, Johnsons) still occupy Founders Square. At Cabin 90, the names of some of the hundred and twenty or so stakeholders are etched into the front steps. Cabin 8 passed down to Brittany&#39;s father. When she inherits her share, Derrick will own it with her, becoming the first owner of color in the cabin&#39;s history. ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 02 Oct 2023 18:06:01 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Alliance Defending Freedom’s Crusade Against Trans Rights]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/10/09/alliance-defending-freedoms-legal-crusade]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-02T10:00:00.000Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6515db29ceac455e1c81fd6a/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/231009_r43127web-site.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;article >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attribute-verso-pattern=&quot;article-body&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;ArticlePageChunks&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;figure data-testid=&quot;IframeEmbed&quot; >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;IframeEmbedContainer&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;iframe height=&quot;90&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; sandbox=&quot;allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups&quot; title=&quot;Embedded Frame&quot; data-src=&quot;https://audm.herokuapp.com/player-embed?pub=newyorker&amp;amp;articleID=651447970b11c2dec5908d46&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay *; encrypted-media *; clipboard-write; autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture&quot;>;&lt;/iframe>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;p >;On March 15, 2023, two conservative Christian lawyers asked a federal judge in Amarillo, Texas, for a ruling that they privately considered an almost impossible long shot. They demanded a nationwide ban on mifepristone, a pill used in half the abortions in America. The drug had been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for more than twenty years, under both Republican and Democratic administrations. During the pandemic, the agency began allowing prescriptions to be filled by mail, to accommodate social distancing.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;But the lawyers, from a group called Alliance Defending Freedom, were on a winning streak. Founded three decades ago as a legal-defense fund for conservative Christian causes, ADF had become that movement&#39;s most influential arm. In the past dozen years, its lawyers had won fourteen Supreme Court victories, including overturning Roe v. Wade; allowing employer-sponsored health insurance to exclude birth control; rolling back limits on government support for religious organizations; protecting the anonymity of donors to advocacy groups; blocking pandemic-related public-health rules; and establishing the right of a baker to refuse to make a cake for a same-sex wedding. Capitalizing on its success, ADF had tripled its revenue over that period, to more than a hundred million dollars a year. It now had seventy or so in-house lawyers, including the former solicitors general of Michigan and Nebraska and the former United States Attorney for Missouri. The lawyers sent to Amarillo were Erik Baptist, a former top lawyer for the Environmental Protection Agency under President Donald Trump, and Erin Hawley, a Yale Law graduate who had clerked for Chief Justice John Roberts, advised the Attorney General under President George W. Bush, and worked on the team that overturned Roe. (She is married to Senator Josh Hawley, of Missouri.)&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Thanks to the rightward shift of the courts under Trump, ADF lawyers now often find a sympathetic audience on the federal bench. Filing the mifepristone case in Amarillo enabled ADF to argue before Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk, a Trump appointee who had previously worked as the deputy general counsel of First Liberty Institute—a conservative Christian advocacy organization that has received grants from ADF The summer before, Kacsmaryk&#39;s chambers had chosen an intern from an ADF program for law students; an alumnus of the program is clerking for him this fall. (Other alumni clerked last term for Justice Samuel Alito and Justice Amy Coney Barrett.)&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Many of the sixty-odd members of ADF&#39;s fund-raising department gathered during the hearing to pray for a win, and, in a video conference the next day, Lance Bauslaugh, ADF&#39;s senior vice-president of development, told the staff that Erin Hawley was “super grateful.” Even though the Amarillo judge was “very friendly,” Bauslaugh said, upending a decades-old FDA approval was “a tough thing to do.” He said of the judge, “Maybe he gives us half of what we are seeking”—say, restoring limits on mail-order delivery. That alone would be “huge.” (A left-leaning investigative organization called Documented provided me with leaked recordings of the video conference and other events, along with hundreds of pages of internal documents.)&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The hearing itself, Bauslaugh noted, offered “fund-raising opportunities.” Donations had been flat lately; Bauslaugh blamed the economy, but surely the reversal of Roe had sapped some donors&#39; motivation. The mifepristone case was plunging ADF back into a galvanizing battle. One of Bauslaugh&#39;s lieutenants offered a potential fund-raising pitch: “If I told you five years ago that you could have invested in Roe being overturned, how much would you have invested in that? If I can tell you now that we are going to protect life even more, how much do you want to invest in &lt;em>;that&lt;/em>;?”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Bauslaugh framed the case yet more broadly, beyond abortion or even Christianity. Calling it “a massive pushback on the FDA and the Biden Administration from a regulatory standpoint,” he noted that there was “a ton of corruption in the bureaucratic state.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;In fact, he explained, ADF was quietly revising its mission altogether, to reflect both the changing times and the group&#39;s growing ambitions. Until now, ADF had cast itself as primarily defensive. In the words of one of its founders, its purpose was “to keep the door open for the Gospel”: to prevent the American Civil Liberties Union and the courts from interfering with Christian ministry, to stop them from removing abortion from the jurisdiction of legislatures, and to keep religion in public life. But ADF leaders often said that the Bible wasn&#39;t just for the faithful; it was a universal guide to “human flourishing.” Accordingly, Bauslaugh told the fund-raisers, ADF was taking on less explicitly religious concerns, perhaps including “corruption in the bureaucratic state.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;As though to reassure the staff that ADF wasn&#39;t abandoning its roots, Bauslaugh kept inserting Biblical references into his explanation. “Why do we exist as an organization?”他问。 “ADF exists to advance our God-given rights to live and speak the truth.” He paused to let that sink in before adding, “The truth—the Gospel.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;For more than half a century, conservative Christians have decried the left&#39;s ever-expanding demands for personal rights. The right to free speech allowed pornography to permeate the culture. The right to freedom of conscience for atheists and religious minorities silenced school prayer. And the right to privacy was stretched to protect birth control, abortion, gay sex, and, eventually, same-sex marriage. In an influential book from 1991, “Rights Talk,” Mary Ann Glendon, a Harvard law professor and a conservative Catholic, argued that letting debates over values become all-or-nothing contests about fundamental rights was undermining democracy, by “turning American political discourse into a parody of itself and challenging the very notion that politics can be conducted through reasoned discussion and compromise.” Rights talk had become dangerously polarizing.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Yet ADF now gushes “rights talk.” In fact, Kristen Waggoner, its chief executive and general counsel, sometimes sounds as if she worked for her organization&#39;s nemesis, the ACLU Arguing before the Supreme Court last winter, she told the Justices that she&#39;d come to defend a bedrock First Amendment principle: the right to resist government attempts to coerce a citizen into publicly denying her deepest convictions. She said that she was standing up for a Black sculptor&#39;s right to refuse to fabricate a cross for an “Aryan church rally,” and for an LGBT Web designer&#39;s right not to promote “a view of marriage that they don&#39;t hold.” Otherwise, she avoided bringing up sexual orientation or marriage—aside from acknowledging, almost in passing, that her client, Lorie Smith, the owner of 303 Creative, a design studio in Littleton, Colorado, had preëmptively declared that she&#39;d never design a Web site for a same-sex wedding, because such a union “contradicts” Scripture.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;The ADF lawyers who filed the mifepristone suit had likewise said that they were arguing for the right to freedom of conscience: their clients were “pro-life” doctors in Texas who felt “complicit” in a patient&#39;s “elective chemical abortion.” Emphasizing those rights, the judge surprised the ADF lawyers by granting all their demands, including the unprecedented judicial suspension of a long-standing FDA approval. The Justice Department has asked the Supreme Court to hear an appeal, and ADF lawyers will likely appear there soon to defend the ruling.&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot;

The majority opinion, by Justice Neil Gorsuch, quoted George Orwell&#39;s axiom that liberty entails “the right to tell people what they do not want to hear”—in this case, to tell a couple that their marriage is sinful.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Though it was ADF&#39;s fifteenth Court victory, Waggoner told me that, aside from overturning Roe, Gorsuch&#39;s opinion was “bigger than anything” her group had yet achieved. She teared up as she praised the Court&#39;s commitment to protecting unpopular speech “even right now, even in &lt;em>;this&lt;/em>; moment”—the era of cancel culture.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;ADF&#39;s liberal critics invoke Orwell, too. They say that the group&#39;s “rights talk” is doublespeak for bigotry, patriarchy, and discrimination. Erwin Chemerinsky, the dean of the law school at UC Berkeley, told me that ADF “puts freedom to discriminate over freedom &lt;em>;from&lt;/em>; discrimination.” Sarah Warbelow, the head of legal advocacy for the Human Rights Campaign, a leading gay-rights group, told me that ADF was “hellbent on eradicating LGBTQ people from public life.” ADF is currently asking the Supreme Court to hear its defense of a Christian psychotherapist&#39;s right to counsel children and adolescents about how to overcome same-sex attraction—a practice, which LGBT advocates call “conversion therapy,” that many states have outlawed. In 2003, ADF filed an unsuccessful brief to the Court defending the criminalization of gay sodomy, and since then its international affiliates have defended similar laws outside the US (An ADF spokesperson said that, as a matter of policy, its affiliates do not litigate to criminalize gay sex; they argue only against the authority of international organizations to impose moral norms on sovereign states.)&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;rsw79ab&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Others accuse ADF of inventing grievances to blow up into causes. Smith, of 303 Creative, told me that her pastor had directed her to speak with ADF before she even entered the business of making Web sites for weddings. And ADF routinely sends out bulletins urging churches and ministries to be on the lookout for “&lt;em >;SOGI&lt;/em>;s”—prohibitions of discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. An ADF legal guide warns churches that such prohibitions “are not designed for the innocent purpose of ensuring all people receive basic services”; rather, “their practical effect is to legally compel Christians to accept, endorse, and even promote messages, ideas, and events that violate their faith.” ADF sometimes resembles a culture-war personal-injury firm; it even solicits clients with a catchy toll-free number, 1-800-&lt;em >;TELL-ADF&lt;/em>;.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;The group has also led the charge against school policies and medical treatments meant to support children or adolescents identifying as transgender. Waggoner told me that, in 2019, ADF initiated the first significant suit opposing the participation of trans athletes in girls&#39; sporting competitions; the case, still ongoing, has helped spark a wider backlash. ADF—which in 2016 established an influence operation aimed at state lawmakers and last year added one focussed on Congress—has helped at least twenty-three states pass legislation barring trans athletes from girls&#39; and women&#39;s events. Several states have introduced ADF model legislation requiring schools to get parental consent for any lessons about gender identity; a lawyer affiliated with ADF helped draft a Florida measure that LGBT advocates call the “Don&#39;t Say Gay” law. Other states have adopted ADF-drafted legislation restricting gender-transition medical treatment for minors. The organization&#39;s lawyers are now representing West Virginia in defending a law, written by ADF, that bans trans athletes. (In an internal briefing, the head of its legislative effort said that ADF had “authored” at least a hundred and thirty bills in thirty-four states last year; more than thirty were passed into law. In 2018, the organization&#39;s lawyers drafted a Mississippi law banning most abortions after fifteen weeks of pregnancy; last year, ADF successfully defended that law in Dobbs v. Jackson Women&#39;s Health Organization, the case that overturned Roe.)&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;With only 1.4 per cent of adolescents in the US identifying as transgender, LGBT-rights groups accuse ADF of whipping up a panic over questions better left to doctors, teachers, and parents. Waggoner, though, told me that ADF was merely reacting to an ominous turn in American life. Her group, she said, had been inundated by complaints from parents about liberal policies regarding trans issues, many of them asking, “I just learned from the school district that they&#39;re calling my daughter by a different name—what can I do?”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Through pronoun policies, anti-discrimination statutes, abortion laws, and other impositions of “sexual ethics,” Waggoner said, liberal government officials were threatening to set up a new kind of police state—one in which dissenters who believe that marriage can involve only a man and a woman are forced to salute the rainbow flags flying outside every town hall, in which teachers are required to indoctrinate children into the belief that gender is not binary, and in which shelters for battered women must make room for trans females. No wonder that her “rights talk” evokes the civil libertarians who once defended the free speech of Communists or neo-Nazis. As Waggoner sees it, traditionalist Christians are now the besieged minority in need of protection. Waggoner told me that the fundamental question was “Are we going to be a majoritarian-authoritarian system of government? Or are we going to stick with our commitment that the power of persuasion is better than the power of government force?” She added, “I would say every single team at ADF—every single litigation team that we have—is working against government censorship.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Alliance Defending Freedom was born out of frustration. In 1992, Republicans had held the White House for the previous twelve years. For the first time, Christian conservatives had played a significant role in electing those Presidents, who had installed five of the nine Supreme Court Justices. Nonetheless, the Court that year reaffirmed the right to abortion, in Planned Parenthood v. Casey, and redoubled the separation of church and state, in Lee v. Weisman, which forbade prayer at school-sponsored events. No matter how many elections conservatives won, liberals always seemed to come out ahead in the courts. So the next year a group of prominent evangelicals—led by James C. Dobson, the founder of Focus on the Family—decided to create an endowment to pay for lawyers who could take on the ACLU and its ilk. They called it Alliance Defense Fund.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;To run it, Dobson and the others turned to Alan Sears, a former federal prosecutor from Kentucky who had risen to prominence as the executive director of a commission on pornography set up during the Reagan Administration. Sears, then in his thirties, had used his platform to urge citizens to help fight the culture wars. With a soft Southern voice, he emphasized in interviews that a chapter of the commission&#39;s report laid out how “citizen action”—boycotts, picket lines, zoning-board changes—could limit distribution of offensive material, even if it was protected by the First Amendment. “It&#39;s a manual that explains First Amendment rights for both sides,” Sears explained.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;A handful of legal organizations specialized in either religious freedom or Christian cases, but most were run by a single lawyer without enough financial resources for a long-term strategy. ADF would be different: it would begin by raising money and &lt;em>;then&lt;/em>; enlist lawyers. Sears dedicated his life to fund-raising so completely, he told me, that he came to empathize with panhandlers: “I had a suit, not a sign, but I learned to beg.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;He told donors that ADF would follow the litigation strategy of the Black civil-rights movement. Where Thurgood Marshall and the NAACP had set out to overturn the precedents underpinning racial segregation, ADF aimed to undo Roe v. Wade and Lemon v. Kurtzman, the 1971 precedent barring “excessive entanglement” of government with religion. Like the NAACP, ADF would find sympathetic and strategically placed plaintiffs, then seek conflicting rulings from different circuits in order to push the Supreme Court to take up a question. Along the way, ADF would try to erode precedents that it opposed—for example, by supporting parental-notification requirements for minors seeking abortions.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;ADF officials declined to tell me who its donors are, but others in conservative Christian circles told me that one of the group&#39;s mainstays is the family of David Green, which founded the Hobby Lobby crafts chain and the Museum of the Bible, in Washington, DC The museum often hosts events for ADF, sometimes with speeches by Green family members, and ADF lawyers argued on Hobby Lobby&#39;s side of a 2014 Supreme Court case that ended the contraception mandate for employer-sponsored insurance. (Representatives of Hobby Lobby and the museum didn&#39;t return calls seeking comment.) Foundations set up by the conservative DeVos and Prince families have also reportedly donated.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Compared with other legal outfits, ADF immediately stood out for the breadth of its aspirations. In 1997, years before Sears could afford in-house litigators, he began sponsoring weeklong conferences around the country to teach lawyers about the group&#39;s issues. The attendees formed an expanding network that ADF could call on to provide pro-bono counsel or to help identify promising plaintiffs.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;In 2001, ADF started hiring in-house lawyers and representing its own clients. But Sears continued to give grants to other organizations and firms—even those competing for the same cases. This largesse helped the organization become a hub for conservative Christian donors—they could give to ADF and trust that their money would be spread across the legal battlefield. Sears, who retired in 2017, told me, “The concept of enabling our allies—we did not do it to raise money, but it really worked.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Any interest group raises money more easily when there&#39;s a looming threat, and Sears found a perfect villain in the emboldened gay-rights movement. In 2000, Vermont recognized same-sex civil unions, and three years later the Supreme Court found a right to engage in gay sodomy. Sears made fighting gay rights ADF&#39;s third priority, alongside opposing abortion rights and church-state separation. Its lawyers contested the recognition of same-sex marriage in state after state. ADF defended the military&#39;s so-called Don&#39;t Ask, Don&#39;t Tell rule, opposed school speech codes aimed at protecting gay people, helped defend a state-funded Baptist youth center in Kentucky that fired a lesbian therapist, and represented chaplains at a Minnesota women&#39;s prison who condemned lesbianism.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;jheo3&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;In 2003, when Christian conservatives were pushing state ballot measures and a constitutional amendment to block same-sex marriage, Sears published an anti-gay polemic, “The Homosexual Agenda.” Writing with Craig Osten, an ADF communications staffer, Sears professed “compassion and sensitivity for those ensnared in homosexual behavior,” but characterized such behavior as a “disordered,” pitiable “condition.” Sears repeatedly linked homosexuality both to sexually transmitted disease and to the sexual abuse of children. The book relied heavily on a handful of men and women who testified that Christian faith had helped them “escape” same-sex attraction. Almost all of those “ex-gay” exemplars have since resumed gay or lesbian lives, denouncing conversion therapy and apologizing for promoting it.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;If Sears were writing “The Homosexual Agenda” now, he told me, he&#39;d have to make some updates. But he stood by the book&#39;s portrait of a plot, hatched by gay-rights activists, to use Hollywood, schools, and the courts to transform American culture. He had sent a lawyer to attend a major LGBT-activist conference in London, and he had studied gay-rights manifestos like “After the Ball: How America Will Conquer Its Fear and Hatred of Gays in the 90&#39;s,” by Marshall Kirk and Hunter Madsen. Sears said that such activists “told us what they wanted to do—they said, &#39;Let&#39;s adopt the strategy of the civil-rights movement, let&#39;s call ourselves a minority, let&#39;s call ourselves oppressed, blah blah blah blah.&#39; ” In hindsight, he said, his book still “stands pretty well,” especially the claim of its subtitle—that LGBT rights are “the principal threat to religious freedom today.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Sears was determined to prevent ADF from capitulating to the language of the gay-rights movement. In 2000, he created a summer program, the Blackstone Legal Fellowship, which taught first-year law students conservative Christian thought. The organization sent visiting Blackstone lecturers a “lexicon,” which all participants at ADF events were expected to follow. A seven-page version sent out in 2013 included the following:&lt;/p>;&lt;blockquote >;&lt;div >;&lt;p>;instead of “bigotry, anti-tolerance,” say “defending biblical, religious principles”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;instead of “homophobia,” say “convictions against homosexual behavior”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;instead of “hate crimes,” say “so-called &#39;hate&#39; crimes”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;instead of “sex education,” say “sexual indoctrination”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;instead of “gay marriage” and its “advocates,” say “marriage imitation” and “opponents of marriage”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;instead of “transgender,” say “cross-dressing” or “sexually confused”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;instead of “gay and lesbian civil rights movement,” say “homosexual agenda.”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/blockquote>;&lt;p >;One Blackstone lecturer that summer was Josh Hawley, a law professor from the University of Missouri and the future senator. He received a twenty-five-hundred-dollar stipend. The &lt;em>;Riverfront Times&lt;/em>;, an alternative weekly, used freedom-of-information laws to obtain e-mail correspondence between Hawley and ADF, including the lexicon. A spokesperson for the Senator told the publication that he and his wife “aren&#39;t going to apologize for their faith.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Another lecturer that year was Amy Coney Barrett, then a law professor at Notre Dame. She lectured at the program for five summers and received the same lexicon. Yet, during Senate hearings for her 2017 confirmation to an appeals court, she testified that she “actually wasn&#39;t aware” that ADF had run the program “until I received the honorarium and saw the ADF on the check, or maybe when I saw an e-mail and saw the signature line.” She added, implausibly, “I don&#39;t know what all of ADF&#39;s policy positions are. And it has never been my practice to investigate all of the policy positions of a group that invites me to speak.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Sears&#39;s organization, which was renamed the Alliance Defending Freedom in 2012, now has forty-nine hundred lawyers in its network of allies. ADF recruits graduates of Harvard, Yale, and Stanford, and more than half its staff lawyers have done federal clerkships. The Blackstone program, which began with about two dozen students, included nearly two hundred this past summer.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;A growing number of Blackstone alumni have clerked for federal judges, and, inevitably, their terms as clerks sometimes have included ADF cases. More than sixty Blackstone alumni are currently clerking on federal courts, including eighteen on appeals courts. The alumnus who is now clerking for the federal district court in Amarillo will next year clerk for the circuit court based in Atlanta, where ADF is defending an Alabama ban on gender-transition treatment for minors. And the two alumni who clerked for Barrett and Alito last session helped them weigh both the 303 Creative case and a Justice Department request to stay the mifepristone ban. (The Court granted the stay—mifepristone remains available for now—but Alito wrote a memorably vituperative dissent.)&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot;

Wade and Lemon v. Kurtzman, the case about enforcing church-state separation. ADF hollowed out Lemon with a series of Supreme Court victories, including one allowing a town council in upstate New York to pray before meetings (2014) and another requiring the State of Missouri to pay to upgrade a Lutheran church&#39;s playground (2017). Last year, the Court cited those precedents when it ruled that a public-school football coach in Washington State could lead prayers from the fifty-yard line.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;2ft2tb&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;The group has become so mainstream that last fall, on Capitol Hill, Waggoner teamed up with two prominent Republican congressmen—Jim Jordan, of Ohio, and Steve Scalise, of Louisiana—to host an ADF reception for newly elected lawmakers. The head of ADF&#39;s state-legislative division, JD Mesnard, is a state senator in Arizona. And, earlier this year, two federal judges resolved lawsuits in part by ordering litigants to submit to ADF training in the First Amendment—in one case, an hour-long lecture by two ADF lawyers about freedom of expression, from John Stuart Mill through the Red Scare. Three art-therapy professors at Southern Illinois University in Edwardsville underwent the training to settle a suit charging that they had discriminated against a conservative Christian student by telling her to stop sharing her beliefs. And a judge in Texas ordered lawyers for Southwest Airlines to receive ADF training as part of the settlement of a suit by a flight attendant who claimed she&#39;d been fired for her opposition to abortion. (Southwest is appealing.)&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Still, despite ADF&#39;s many successes, same-sex couples now have a constitutional right to marry. I wondered whether Sears thought ADF was winning or losing. “We are on a winning trajectory,” he told me, adding wishfully, “It may be that the day will come when people say the birth-control pill was a mistake.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The headquarters of ADF is in a leafy campus in Lansdowne, Virginia, about an hour&#39;s drive from the Supreme Court. Security is tight. Whenever I arrived for meetings with Waggoner, an armed guard looked me over before letting me in. Once, when I asked to use a men&#39;s room, the guard waited outside, apparently to insure that I did not wander off unattended. ADF officials told me that, nearly every day, the group receives at least one threat.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Five feet tall, fifty-one, and blond, Waggoner favors platform heels, skirt suits, and thick silver necklaces. Her office has a view of the Blue Ridge Mountains, and until recently she had always filled her workspace with Disney memorabilia. “Just Mickey and Minnie—sort of the classics,” she told me. A mother of three, she has often visited Disney parks, and even run marathons through them, but she told me that the Walt Disney Company&#39;s recent defense of LGBT rights has “ruined the beauty.” The Disney tchotchkes are gone, and on a credenza is a stack of copies of an illustrated children&#39;s book, “She Is She.” Its authors describe it as a celebration of femininity and motherhood to counter the promotion of nontraditional gender identities. It features a colorful drawing of Waggoner, “a justice-seeking lawyer.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Waggoner is what psychologists call an active listener. She gives empathetic nods and smiles even when she disagrees vehemently with what she is hearing. As I laid out a liberal critique of her cases, she kept smiling while calling what I&#39;d just said “absolute garbage.” Lawyers who have faced her in the courtroom say that the corners of her lips seemingly never turn down. Keith Kemper, her former partner in a Seattle law firm, told me that, “because she has a sweet disposition and a small stature, it is easy to say, &#39;Oh, here is this nice little girl.&#39; But she is the sweetest killer you ever met.” A former adversary likened Waggoner&#39;s countenance to that of Dolores Umbridge, the cheerfully authoritarian bureaucrat in the “Harry Potter” series.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Waggoner grew up in Longview, Washington, near the Oregon border, and belongs to the Assemblies of God, the largest Pentecostal denomination—part of a movement defined by speaking in tongues. Her father was the principal of an Assemblies of God school that Waggoner attended, and he later became an associate pastor of the church that ran the school. Waggoner told me that, around the age of thirteen, she felt a sudden calling to become a lawyer and “defend religious freedom and Christian ministries in schools.” The culture war of the day was over the teaching of creationism at church schools like her father&#39;s, and Waggoner said that, as a girl, she&#39;d been vaguely aware of “controversies over religious autonomy.” But she also said that no earthly influence could account for her choice of vocation, given that no conservative Christian legal movement existed at the time. “I don&#39;t know why I felt so strongly, but I am thankful for it,” she told me. (Waggoner says that she wrote down her calling on a scrap of paper, which she keeps in her bedroom today.) She attended a regional college run by the Assemblies of God and then moved to Virginia Beach to attend Regent University School of Law, a pioneering evangelical law program founded, in 1986, by the Christian broadcaster Pat Robertson. After a clerkship at the Washington State Supreme Court, she practiced for sixteen years at the Seattle firm, which often represented churches.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;During Sears&#39;s tenure, ADF was almost unknown outside conservative Christian circles. Its lawyers viewed mainstream news organizations as hostile, and, like most attorneys, they worried that clients who spoke publicly might undermine their cases. But, during the electoral contests over same-sex marriage, LGBT activists had won support by presenting the media with sympathetic images of gay and lesbian couples—ordinary-looking people asking for things like hospital-visitation rights. Waggoner, avoiding the forbidden words “gay marriage” or “gay rights,” told me that ADF&#39;s opponents “are very good at bringing to bear who&#39;s affected if &lt;em>;their&lt;/em>; viewpoint isn&#39;t adopted.” When she took over ADF&#39;s legal strategy, she decided to borrow that playbook and show that conservative Christians could be victims, too—that liberal laws and precedents “create real harm, that real people are affected, and these people don&#39;t have horns. They aren&#39;t hateful people.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Her test case was Jack Phillips, the owner of a Colorado business called Masterpiece Cakeshop. A ruggedly handsome and ambitiously artful baker, Phillips, who is now sixty-seven, claimed a First Amendment right to refuse to bake a gay couple&#39;s wedding cake. In 2017, Waggoner joined him on “The View,” ABC&#39;s rowdy daytime talk show. Most of the show&#39;s five female hosts were noisily liberal, and it was impossible to imagine Sears, the anti-porn crusader, at their table. Waggoner fit right in. Phillips&#39;s case was not just about a gay couple, she insisted. “Jack&#39;s dignity is at issue as well,” she said. One could support same-sex marriage while still supporting “artists like Jack,” Waggoner told the hosts, adding, “If the state can crush Jack, it can crush every single one of us.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The “View” hosts grilled them on the Biblical basis for the baker&#39;s objection. Didn&#39;t the Good Book tell us not to judge? Didn&#39;t Jesus “hang out” with the lowest of the low? The co-host Joy Behar exclaimed, “Jesus would have made the cake!” She then immediately mocked herself for “speaking for Jesus.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Waggoner laughed as deeply as anyone. She must have known that her gambit was working. Chatting with five women citing Scripture and speaking for God, she sounded downright pluralistic. Sunny Hostin, a “View” co-host who is also a lawyer and a legal-affairs correspondent, conceded that she now could see “both sides of this argument,” adding, “It is a closer call than I think we are giving credit for.”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;h56w7n&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Phillips and Waggoner went on to give six hundred media interviews. ADF launched a team that produced polished videos about its plaintiffs. (Perhaps too polished. The Washington &lt;em>;Post&lt;/em>; recently reported that ADF employees posed as brides in videos promoting three clients who object to filming or photographing gay weddings.) Mainstream-media campaigns became a core part of its repertoire. Waggoner told me, “Some of the lawyers were having an absolute heart attack. But I said, &#39;No, you will prep your client, and your client &lt;em>;will&lt;/em>; talk about the case!&#39; ”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In oral arguments, Waggoner mounted an innovative theory: it might be unlawful discrimination if a baker declined to sell a premade cake to a gay customer, but forcing the baker to design a cake celebrating a gay wedding would constitute constitutionally impermissible “compelled speech,” like requiring a St. Patrick&#39;s Day parade to allow a gay-pride banner. She told me, “I have tried to bring to ADF a spirit of offense rather than defense. I&#39;d rather have the ACLU and Planned Parenthood worried about what we are doing—not the other way around.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Humanizing ADF&#39;s clients serves another important purpose—motivating donors—and the organization&#39;s revenue has doubled in the five years since Waggoner stepped up its media outreach. According to the leaked video call, donors who give a hundred thousand dollars a year or more were expected to account for more than half ADF&#39;s fund-raising in the past fiscal year—upward of fifty million dollars.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Direct fund-raising—such as telemarketing and TV commercials—was expected to bring in about twenty-seven million dollars. I signed up for ADF e-mails, and they were alarming: “Government told school to choose between faith and food”; “School silences 7th grader.” But on the video call a staff member told the fund-raisers that ADF wasn&#39;t “trying to provoke fear.” The goal was to “communicate what the problem is, and the solution—which is ADF”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The fund-raising department&#39;s motto is “We dig ditches.” On the video call, Keaton Sauncy, a senior fund-raiser, explained that the phrase referred to an Old Testament passage. During a battle with the Moabites, God told the Israelites to catch floodwater in ditches. The Moabites “see the reflection of the sun in them, and they think it is blood, and they are scared, and they kill themselves, and we win!,” Sauncy said, somewhat garbling the story. The moral, he said, was that if the fund-raisers do their work “God is going to bring that rain.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Lance Bauslaugh, the fund-raising head, told the staff to keep “that Holy Spirit swagger” and to think about “cultivating the remnant”—a term used in end-time prophecies to describe the few who resist the descent into sin before the apocalypse. He reported that, according to an ADF study, twenty million Americans could be donors. “Is that part of the remnant?” he asked.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Talk of ditches full of blood seemed out of step with Waggoner&#39;s sunny persona, at first. But, the more we talked, the more I realized that her assessment of what she calls “the current cultural moment” is also quite bleak. She repeatedly invoked the case of Päivi Räsänen, a Finnish legislator who is represented by ADF&#39;s international division, which was launched in 2008. Räsänen is fighting hate-crime charges over a social-media post in which she cited a Bible verse and called homosexuality “dysfunctional,” a “disorder,” and sinful. Waggoner described the case as “the tip of the spear in the Western world,” and said that, more and more, US government officials were “gaining power in order to create or impose a new orthodoxy in human sexuality and sexual ethics.” With a smile, she added, “I see a lot of darkness.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;What Waggoner calls a “new orthodoxy,” of course, is what liberals call freedom and equality: the right to choose a partner of any sex, to take pride in a nontraditional gender identity, to make decisions about your own body. But ADF sees the story of the past sixty years as a historic aberration. For centuries, nearly every major civilization had held similar beliefs: sex was for married heterosexuals; making babies was the point. But, beginning in the nineteen-sixties, the Supreme Court began abetting a radical transformation in sexual ethics by citing a novel “right to privacy,” initially in a case about married couples purchasing condoms. By expanding that right to cover abortion, gay sex, and same-sex marriage, the Court had effectively redefined sex as a form of individual self-expression. The only meaning or purpose of sex was in the minds of the adults having it. (In Casey, the majority held that sex was part of “the right to define one&#39;s own concept of existence, of meaning, of the universe, and of the mystery of human life.”) In this new era of “plastic sex”—a phrase that a Blackstone lecturer borrowed from the British sociologist Anthony Giddens—children all but vanished from the picture.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Next, the ADF story goes, advocates of plastic sex began redescribing sexual urges as group identities. Same-sex attraction, once a kink, now &lt;em>;defined&lt;/em>; a person. And sex without fear of pregnancy was no longer merely a desire; the Court found that it was a necessary component of a free, full life, which meant that the right to abortion was essential to women. And the traditional view of sexuality—common to Christianity, Judaism, and Islam—was recast as bigotry.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Waggoner referred me repeatedly to a dissent by Justice Alito in Obergefell v. Hodges, the 2015 case that found a constitutional right to same-sex marriage. ADF bulletins often quote Alito&#39;s words, which she deems prophetic. “I assume that those who cling to old beliefs will be able to whisper their thoughts in the recesses of their homes,” Alito warned. “But if they repeat those views in public, they will risk being labeled as bigots and treated as such by governments, employers, and schools.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Depending on whom you ask, the Obergefell ruling either shaped or reflected a stunning transformation of American public opinion. Twice as many people now support same-sex marriage as oppose it—roughly the inverse of the ratio of only twenty years ago. Yet Waggoner contended to me that the agenda behind Obergefell was more sinister: “The intent was to vilify those who believed in marriage between a man and a woman, and to use the law against them so that they would become enemies of the law. And that is exactly what we saw happen.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Waggoner said that ADF was “not looking to polarize.” She made a point of noting that members of her extended family are gay, and that she is friendly toward them. She even asserted that ADF had represented openly gay clients—although, citing confidentiality, she wouldn&#39;t name any. “Scripture says that homosexuality is wrong,” she said. “But it also says that lying is wrong. And Scripture teaches that you&#39;re entitled to be treated with dignity and respect regardless of what life-style choices you&#39;re making.”&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot;

Waggoner said, “If someone were to say, &#39;I struggle with same-sex attraction,&#39; that is different than saying, &#39;I am gay.&#39; ” But “we also believe that same-sex &lt;em>;behavior&lt;/em>; is wrong, that it&#39;s a sin.” Although people who identify as LGBT are entitled to respect, she noted, “I should &lt;em>;also&lt;/em>; be able to suggest that I think there&#39;s a different path that can be taken, and not be put in jail for that or censored by my government.” (An ADF spokesperson acknowledged that no American has ever been jailed or censored for homophobia. But he noted that anti-discrimination laws in New York and Minnesota allow jail time as a potential penalty.)&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;91zv3l&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;To LGBT people, “life style” and “path” are the code words of bigots. Still, Waggoner said that ADF is consistent about its sexual ethics: divorce may lead to termination, depending on an assessment of the “Biblical” grounds for the breakup.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Liberals, and some conservatives, say that ADF&#39;s fear of plastic-sex authoritarianism is wildly paranoid. Half the fifty states have not passed any law against discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. The Supreme Court has never held that sexual orientation is a “suspect class,” like race, that warrants special scrutiny when it is used as a basis for laws, employment, housing, or other distinctions. Most important, the current Supreme Court appears to lean toward ADF&#39;s views. Andrew Koppelman, a professor of law and philosophy at Northwestern University who has studied ADF&#39;s cases, told me that ten years ago the group was considered so extreme that its claims “bordered on the frivolous.” Now “ADF needs to be taken seriously, because any claim they make has a shot at five votes on the Supreme Court.” Even the majority opinion in Obergefell, by Justice Anthony Kennedy, included an unusual concession: “Many who deem same-sex marriage to be wrong reach that conclusion based on decent and honorable religious or philosophical premises, and neither they nor their beliefs are disparaged here.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Indeed, secular-liberal tyranny has been a running theme of some Justices. In a 2018 case, ADF successfully opposed California&#39;s requirement that “pro-life” pregnancy-counselling centers post notices about the availability of public funding for abortion; the majority opinion, by Justice Clarence Thomas, likened the state&#39;s measure to Stalinism, Nazism, the Cultural Revolution in China, and Romania under Nicolae Ceaușescu. (“As they should!” Waggoner told me. “It was shocking!”) The next year, in a majority opinion that supported keeping a giant cross on public property, Alito warned of “militantly secular regimes,” such as a government that “roams the land, tearing down monuments with religious symbolism and scrubbing away any reference to the divine.” In the Masterpiece Cakeshop decision, the Court ruled for the baker on the ground that the Colorado civil-rights commission had displayed an impermissible animus against his faith. (At a hearing, a commissioner had said that “freedom of religion and religion has been used to justify all kinds of discrimination throughout history, whether it be slavery, whether it be the Holocaust,” calling it “despicable” when people “use their religion to hurt others.”)&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In oral arguments for 303 Creative, the case about the Web designer, Justice Barrett made ADF&#39;s case more effectively than Waggoner did. The crux of ADF&#39;s reasoning was that Lorie Smith, the designer, objected only to a message of support for same-sex marriage but had no bias against LGBT people. Barrett asked Waggoner if her client would create a Web site for people who were “cisgender and heterosexual” but wanted their “wedding story” to convey that their sexes were “irrelevant to our relationship, which transcends such categories”?&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Waggoner later described to me her befuddled reaction: “I was, like, &#39;cisgender&#39;?” When she began to say that her client &lt;em>;would&lt;/em>; design such a Web site, Barrett cut her off and unspooled a fresh hypothetical: What about adulterous co-workers who wanted a wedding site celebrating their divorces? Wouldn&#39;t those messages violate the designer&#39;s Biblical views, regardless of the newlyweds&#39; sexual orientation? Waggoner—now getting it—hastened to agree.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;A former ADF lawyer told me that it was “destructive” of the organization to keep warning Christians “that the Church is facing mortal peril, that it is on the brink of real persecution and destruction.” In fact, the lawyer said, Christian legal rights are “more secure than they have ever been,” and ADF itself “is incredibly successful.” But Waggoner told me that the issues ADF was contesting “would have been unimaginable to most Americans just fifteen years ago” and that “the staggering number of people requesting our help tells you this moment is an assault on our freedom.” She added, “Just because we have prevailed in some cases, that doesn&#39;t mean that the threat in our generation is not more significant than ever before.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The next priority for ADF, Waggoner told me, is fighting “the radical gender-identity ideology infiltrating the law”—that is, transgender rights. Waggoner said that she doesn&#39;t believe in transgender identity, only in “gender dysphoria,” adding, “I believe there are people who are uncomfortable in their bodies.” She cited growing numbers—the 1.4 per cent of American teen-agers now identifying as trans may be roughly double the percentage in 2017, according to a UCLA study of government data—as evidence that forces in culture, education, and the law have fuelled a “social contagion.” Schools were pushing minors too young to give meaningful consent toward irreversible “sterilization and chemical castration,” all to treat adolescent feelings of awkwardness that could be addressed by psychological counselling. It was all “absurd,” she insisted.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;ADF began a pushback against “gender identity” in 2014, shortly after Waggoner joined the organization, as the head of its allied-attorney program. Its first effort centered on public bathrooms and school locker rooms, implicitly portraying transgender girls as a menace to others. ADF mailed out a draft policy to school districts recommending sex segregation for any spaces “where persons may be in a state of undress” and defining sex as “either male or female, as objectively determined by anatomy and/or genetics at the time of birth.” The next year, the organization sent lawmakers model legislation that effectively offered a bounty to any student who found “a person of the opposite sex” in a bathroom or locker room. A student could sue a school for a payment of twenty-five hundred dollars, in addition to psychological damages and legal fees. Republican lawmakers introduced similar bills in at least ten states, and in 2016 North Carolina passed a version that applied to all public agencies.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The outcry was earthshaking: why were North Carolina Republicans so obsessed with bathroom encounters? Trade associations pulled conventions; PayPal and other companies withdrew plans to expand in the state; the NBA relocated events; Bruce Springsteen cancelled a concert. The Republican governor who signed the legislation went down to defeat in the next election, and his Democratic successor signed a repeal. ADF had inadvertently delivered a victory for LGBT rights.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;ADF overshot in court, too. It was defending a Detroit funeral parlor against claims of discrimination from an employee fired for announcing a gender transition and requesting a woman&#39;s uniform. The proprietor was Christian, and ADF&#39;s lawyers initially argued that the state could not force him to violate his religious beliefs. But, when the case reached the Supreme Court, ADF sought a broader ruling, asking the Court to find that &lt;em>;any&lt;/em>; employer could fire someone solely for identifying as transgender, because federal laws against sex discrimination didn&#39;t protect people who identify as LGBT John J. Bursch, the ADF lawyer arguing the case, told the Court, “Treating women and men equally does not mean employers have to treat men as women.” The Court disagreed. LGBT-rights groups hailed the ruling, issued in 2020 as Bostock v. Clayton County. But Gorsuch, writing the majority opinion, practically invited Waggoner to return to the Court with ADF&#39;s original argument about religious freedom. The Court remained “deeply concerned” about such matters, Gorsuch wrote, emphasizing that these were “questions for future cases.” Waggoner, taking the hint, told me that she expected to bring cases “at the edges” of Bostock.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;In internal lectures, ADF lawyers describe a change in strategy when Waggoner took over, six years ago: a drive to pick smarter battles, including in the court of public opinion. A Connecticut case against transgender rights exemplified the shift. In 2017, Andraya Yearwood and Terry Miller, transgender girls at a Connecticut high school, began setting sprinting records at statewide track meets. At the time, the National Collegiate Athletic Association required a year of hormone therapy before a transgender woman could compete in a female event, but Connecticut qualified girls on the basis of identity alone. Neither student had yet undergone any medical treatment, and in finish-line photographs they looked conspicuously bigger than other racers. Hulu later made a documentary hailing Yearwood as a pathbreaker. She told the filmmakers, “On the girls&#39; team, I just feel amazing, just knowing that I get to be who I am.”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;drcgz&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Waggoner, who played basketball and volleyball in high school, told me, “I felt like you knew, as a woman, that this is wrong.” Seemingly aligning herself with nineteen-seventies feminism, she added, “Underlying all of this is whether women have any rights at all, and it&#39;s shocking to me that we&#39;re even debating this, especially after fifty years of trying to advance those rights.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Bianca Stanescu, whose daughter Selina Soule lost medals to the trans girls, had started a petition opposing the state&#39;s rules. ADF lawyers sought out the family and persuaded the Soules to file a lawsuit claiming that Connecticut&#39;s policy violated the Title IX guarantee of an equal chance for female athletes to compete and win. Selina was a far more sympathetic protagonist than a hypothetical student confronting someone in a bathroom. Tucker Carlson, then at Fox News, interviewed her, and she said, “We missed out on winning the State Open Championship because of the team that the transgender athlete was on.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Waggoner told me that conservative organizations and Republican politicians across the country have followed ADF&#39;s lead. “We were the first,” she said proudly. “And, because we were willing to file suit, state legislators were coming to us and saying, &#39;What can we do in our state?&#39; Now twenty-three states have passed laws to protect women&#39;s sports.” The appeals court in New York is expected to issue a ruling in the Soule case soon; among many other transgender cases, ADF has filed a suit in Alaska to protect the right of a shelter for battered women to turn away transgender clients.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;ADF has now taken on suits across the country opposing liberal policies concerning children and adolescents who identify as transgender—relatively favorable terrain for its side of the fight. Waggoner told me that an ADF goal is to persuade the Supreme Court to establish “parental rights” as a constitutional principle: “It&#39;s not that the Court is going to say, &#39;Gender ideology is bad.&#39; But I do think the Court could say, &#39;Parental rights are fundamental rights.&#39; ”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Precedents from the nineteen-twenties protect the rights of parents to teach their children a foreign language or send them to Catholic schools, but the Court has said little else on the subject. The late Justice Antonin Scalia, an icon of conservative jurisprudence, declared in a 2015 speech that the Constitution guaranteed parents no such rights: “My right to raise my children the way I want, to teach them what I want them taught, not what Big Brother says—that is not there.” Following Scalia&#39;s logic, a Justice who finds a constitutional guarantee of parental rights would be as fanciful as the liberals who once detected a right to privacy in “penumbras” around the Bill of Rights. (Waggoner told me that Scalia was “not perfect.”)&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;ADF staff in Washington are pushing for legislation that would make it easier to sue school districts for alleged violations of parental rights. Its lawyers have brought “parental-rights” cases both in appellate circuits that lean left and in others that lean right, increasing the chance that a split will compel the Supreme Court to take up the issue. In Waukesha, Wisconsin, part of the conservative circuit based in Chicago, ADF is representing parents suing their school district for ignoring their request to treat their twelve-year-old as a girl (the child, for a time, had requested to be treated as a boy). And in Loudoun County, Virginia, part of the liberal circuit based in Richmond, ADF is representing Christian teachers who oppose the district&#39;s policy of letting students choose their pronouns without telling their parents. (In 2021, ADF won an appeals-court decision that a public college couldn&#39;t make a professor use a student&#39;s preferred pronouns.)&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;ADF&#39;s campaign against LGBT rights can have an intimidating effect. Last November, in Asheville, North Carolina, the Reverend Ronald Gates, who volunteers as an ADF community “ambassador,” appeared before the city&#39;s school board and repeatedly addressed a transgender woman on the board as “Mr.” When the board member, Peyton O&#39;Connor, asked the pastor to “refrain from bigotry and hate speech,” Gates shouted, “I will say &#39;Mr.&#39;—if the blood was drawn, it would be XY, which is a &lt;em>;male!&lt;/em>; ” (Gates didn&#39;t return my phone calls.)&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;O&#39;Connor subsequently resigned. She told me she&#39;d been afraid that ADF would turn the incident into yet another culture-war flash point. “ADF is really good at drawing people into these fights that are really of little consequence,” she told me. “It becomes a way to mobilize their base, and to draw more attention to these right-wing causes. If you look at their Web site, they use these things for the fund-raising drumbeat—like, &#39;We have got queers in the public-school systems! Everybody, give us money so we can fight this evil!&#39; That is their business model.” (An ADF spokesperson said that, as a matter of policy, it doesn&#39;t confront individuals or elected officials, and that its ambassadors aren&#39;t authorized to speak for the organization.)&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Pitting conservative Christian parents, employers, and creative professionals against LGBT rights reminded me of the incremental approach that ADF and its allies had adopted during the long struggle to overturn Roe: undermining the precedent bit by bit, by defending parental-notification laws, waiting periods, and so on. With Roe gone, the surviving precedent most objectionable to conservative Christians is undoubtedly Obergefell—the same-sex marriage decision. In some ways, Obergefell is also fragile. Two of the five Justices in its majority, Ruth Bader Ginsberg and Anthony Kennedy, have been replaced by conservatives, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett. And some lawyers argue that the Obergefell majority fatally contradicted itself by calling the opposition to same-sex marriage “decent and honorable.” (Robert George, a Princeton legal scholar and another occasional lecturer at ADF&#39;s Blackstone program, told me, “If that line is right, then the outcome is wrong.”) The majority concluded that the right to same-sex marriage was embedded in the Constitution&#39;s guarantees of due process, but in a vigorous dissent Alito quoted a precedent that “due process” includes only rights “deeply rooted in this Nation&#39;s history and tradition.” He argued that “it is beyond dispute that the right to same-sex marriage is not among those rights.” Alito&#39;s argument about “deeply rooted” rights is the exact argument that six Justices endorsed in overturning Roe.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;xr9n4c&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;By reinforcing Kennedy&#39;s “decent and honorable” caveat, ADF&#39;s victories have also undermined the idea that a right to same-sex marriage was ever “deeply rooted.” Shortly after the 303 Creative decision, a Christian justice of the peace in Waco, Texas, filed a lawsuit claiming that her religious conviction exempted her from performing same-sex marriages. She argued that the 303 Creative precedent “rejects the idea of a &#39;compelling interest&#39; ” in the equal treatment of same-sex couples.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Waggoner did not want to discuss Obergefell. “I&#39;m worried you&#39;re gonna just use a choice little quote, and anybody that reads the article is going to think I&#39;m abandoning Obergefell, and I am not,” she said. “I think it is wrong and it should be reversed, but I don&#39;t wake up in the morning thinking about how to do that.”&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot;

Sam Smith, who identifies as nonbinary, had dressed as Satan for a raunchy S &amp;amp; M stage show with the trans singer Kim Petras. Waggoner said, “What I wake up thinking about is what Obergefell has &lt;em>;caused&lt;/em>; the current cultural moment.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Recently, ADF opened a new front in its “parental-rights” fight: a lawsuit over teaching about racism. The school district that includes Charlottesville, Virginia, began devising an anti-racist curriculum after white supremacists gathered there in 2017 for the Unite the Right rally. Two years ago, a middle-school pilot program was launched with a slide presentation that quoted the author and activist Ibram X. Kendi: “Children are either going to learn racist or antiracist ideas. In other words, if we don&#39;t actively protect them from this dangerous racist society, what do you think they will be taught?”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;At school-board meetings, some parents objected that the curriculum&#39;s discussions of “white privilege” and a “dominant culture” taught racial stereotypes or stigmatized white people. One such parent, Carlos Ibañez, an oral surgeon who&#39;d emigrated from Panama, alerted ADF, and became the lead plaintiff in a lawsuit charging that the district had violated civil-rights laws by treating students differently on the basis of race.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Waggoner told me that the case extended ADF&#39;s defense of parental rights; schools were treating children as “the property of the state.” She argued that the content of Charlottesville&#39;s curriculum was “way outside the bounds” of the Constitution&#39;s limits.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I was surprised she&#39;d plunged ADF into debates about race. The suit does little “to keep the door open for the Gospel.” Instead of arguing for freedom of religion or expression, ADF appeared to be &lt;em>;policing&lt;/em>; the speech of Charlottesville teachers, seeking a ruling that certain lessons were off limits. What&#39;s more, ADF&#39;s arguments against anti-discrimination protections for LGBT people had already raised awkward questions about its stance toward other forms of bigotry.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;In 2021, ADF sued the Biden Administration for requiring that federally funded adoption agencies work with same-sex couples. ADF argued that the policy violated the religious freedom of its client, Holston United Methodist Home for Children, in Tennessee. The Administration quickly folded; the Supreme Court had tipped the scales for Holston by ruling that a similar policy in the city of Philadelphia had violated the religious freedom of Catholic Social Services. But the next year Holston leveraged the same religious-freedom argument to reject a couple because they were Jewish. Gabriel Rutan-Ram, the would-be father, told me that Holston&#39;s decision was “blatant antisemitism.” With help from the liberal group Americans United for Separation of Church and State, he and his wife are now suing the Tennessee agency that partially funds Holston. (Waggoner told me that excluding Jews is “not something we would advocate for,” but argued that, under certain circumstances, a religious agency could have that right.)&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;During oral arguments in 303 Creative, Justice Sonia Sotomayor accused Waggoner of justifying all kinds of bigotry. If a designer could turn away a wedding commission because the partners were gay, what &lt;em>;other&lt;/em>; couples could be rebuffed? Sotomayor asked, “How about people who don&#39;t believe in interracial marriage, or about people who don&#39;t believe that disabled people should get married?” Where would Waggoner draw “a limiting line”?&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Waggoner, struggling to deflect, first proposed that a true bigot would refuse to serve a whole category of people—Blacks, the disabled, people who identify as LGBT But 303 Creative welcomed gay clients and objected only to gay weddings.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson invoked a hypothetical photographer selling pictures of children with Santa. Although he takes portraits of Black children in other contexts, he wants these shots to evoke a nostalgic, “It&#39;s a Wonderful Life” feeling. Can he turn away Black children in the name of his art? Waggoner was forced to concede that her free-speech argument might indeed protect racists. The Court, she noted, had “protected vile, awful, reprehensible, violent speech in the past.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;When I asked Waggoner about the exchange, she grew almost heated. She said that I&#39;d “pushed a button,” and complained that invoking the spectre of racism was a tactic “designed to malign, shame, and bully people.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Like the Charlottesville race case, many of ADF&#39;s recent battles turn on a similar question: Who&#39;s bullying whom? &lt;em>;Have&lt;/em>; conservative Christians, as Alito claims, become an imperilled minority, whispering in the recesses of their homes that marriage is between a man and a woman?&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Waggoner&#39;s critics say that she ignores history. Conservative Christians may be a minority now, but civil-rights laws don&#39;t protect Black or LGBT people simply because they&#39;re outnumbered. Sarah Warbelow, of the Human Rights Campaign, told me, “ &#39;Minorities&#39; is the wrong word. The argument is for protections for &lt;em>;vulnerable&lt;/em>; people—individuals and classes of people who have historically, and ongoingly, experienced discrimination in the public sphere, in public accommodation, housing, employment, credit, and education. The vast majority of Christians are not being discriminated against in these areas of life. A baker is not refusing to make a baptismal or First Communion cake for their child.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In Waggoner&#39;s conversations with me, she made an argument that she got cut off trying to make during the 303 Creative case. The difference between turning down a same-sex couple and turning down an interracial couple, she told me, was in the historic roots of the motivation. In Loving v. Virginia, the Court had concluded that banning interracial marriage was “part of a whole system of laws that were designed to subjugate a whole class of people, out of group bigotry.” But the belief that marriage was between a man and a woman had a more dignified pedigree: “the teachings of all the Abrahamic faiths.” She said, “So to suggest that those two things are in any way similar is either misinformed or it is designed to shut down the conversation.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Slavery, of course, was also a centuries-old tradition whose defenders cited deep roots in the Abrahamic faiths. And Abraham himself was polygamous. But, for now, most of the Justices appear to share Waggoner&#39;s perspective. In 303 Creative, as the liberal Justices kept hammering her, Alito threw her a lifeline. In Obergefell, he prodded, “did the Court say religious objections to same-sex marriage are the same thing as religious or other objections to people of color?”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;No, Waggoner answered, back on firm footing and playing along. With a smile, she repeated the words the Supreme Court had used to describe opposition to gay marriage: people like her were “decent and honorable.” ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 02 Oct 2023 18:06:01 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[What Really Started the Great Chicago Fire?]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/10/09/the-burning-of-the-world-the-great-chicago-fire-and-the-war-for-a-citys-soul-scott-w-berg-book-review]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-02T10:00:00.000Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65149f02b43cd9cd22fd8762/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/231009_r43129.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;article >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attribute-verso-pattern=&quot;article-body&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;ArticlePageChunks&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;In the age of climate change, “natural disaster” is more of a misnomer than ever. We can absolve ourselves of responsibility for volcanic eruptions and earthquakes (except the ones caused by fracking). But the lengthening hurricane season, the floods, and the droughts? They&#39;ve got our fingerprints all over them. Higher average temperatures and drier vegetation are making wildfires burn hotter and break out more frequently—a development that was hard to ignore this past summer. Smoke from Canadian wildfires in June turned the skies over New York and Washington, DC, a lurid, choking orange. A fire on Maui incinerated the town of Lahaina and killed nearly a hundred people. “We can&#39;t really call them wildfires anymore,” a climate scientist named Jennifer Francis told the AP in July. “They&#39;re not wild. They&#39;re not natural anymore.” Who or what we blame for such calamities helps determine how we respond to them. Call them acts of God or artifacts of nature&#39;s inevitable cycles, and we might just do nothing.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Big cities don&#39;t tend to burn on the scale they did in the seventeenth, eighteenth, and nineteenth centuries, when conflagrations levelled vast swaths of London (1666), Moscow (1812), New York (1835), and Edo, now Tokyo (repeatedly), to name a few significant instances. Fire has become a different kind of menace, owing to modern extinguishing technology, professional firefighting forces, and, crucially, the fact that, in wealthier countries, we no longer light our homes and cook our food with open flames in neighborhoods constructed largely of wood. Wildfire smoke drifts into far-flung cities and pollutes our lungs, raising the risk of long-term health damage. Smaller towns in landscapes rendered combustible by extreme heat—the grasslands on Maui, the Sierra Nevada foothills in California—may be consumed almost entirely.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;GenericCallout&quot;>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;external-link-embed--inline&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;a aria-label=&quot;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;The Best Books We Read This Week&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.newyorker.com/best-books-2023&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/best-books-2023&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;&lt;span >;&lt;strong>;The Best Books We Read This Week&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/a>;&lt;p >;&lt;em>;Read our reviews of notable new fiction and nonfiction, updated every Wednesday.&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;a aria-label=&quot;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;The Best Books We Read This Week&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.newyorker.com/best-books-2023&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/best-books-2023&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/63c800e4e99d89b838ada996/1:1/w_200%2Cc_limit/undefined&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/63c800e4e99d89b838ada996/1:1/w_120,c_limit/undefined 120w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/a>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;That&#39;s not to say that the big-city fires of the past were strictly natural phenomena. They were the products of human interaction with an ecosystem—determined by how people settled and lived within a given topography. Still, these were sudden, cataclysmic events—sheets of flame, boiling rivers, melting buildings—and thus easily mythologized; their origins were occluded by fear, wonder, and the conviction that fire was God&#39;s cleansing punishment. The rebuilding of great cities was itself a source of awe: the phoenix rising again and again from the ashes. All that imagery of destruction, retribution, and rebirth could obscure circumstances that were often deeply, grubbily—and fascinatingly—political, as Scott W. Berg shows in his illuminating new book, “The Burning of the World: The Great Chicago Fire and the War for a City&#39;s Soul” (Pantheon). The Chicago fire turns out to be a rich case study not only in urban history and the sociology of catastrophe but in how people choose to remember their collective past. For starters, if you know anything about the fire, you probably have a vague recollection that there was a cow involved. Didn&#39;t it kick something over? A lantern, maybe? And wasn&#39;t it somehow Mrs. O&#39;Leary&#39;s fault, whoever she was? But none of that is true.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;At the time Chicago burned down, in 1871, it was the fastest-growing city in the country. In 1840, three years after it was incorporated, it was still a scrubby frontier town, with a population of 4,470. In the ensuing three decades, owing in part to the completion of transportation links such as the Illinois &amp;amp; Michigan Canal, it burgeoned into a commercial entrepôt of some three hundred thousand people, a mercantile behemoth. Its railroads, lumberyards, and stockyards were booming, its businessmen prospering. Chicago, Berg writes, had become the “most important link in a never-ending chain of goods and materials that bound the Eastern Seaboard to the western farms and fields, and the United States to Europe and Asia.” It was taken as an embodiment of American values and vices—brash, hurried, voracious, money-mad. Witness, for example, the driving appetite with which the city tore into the pine forests of Wisconsin and Michigan for the lumber it required. The seemingly endless supply of pine sent down rivers and canals and across Lake Michigan, along with the abundant land available to build the city upon, meant that “wooden sheds, barns, and town houses proliferated like wildflowers.” For the working classes, homeownership was more accessible in Chicago than in most American cities, partly because of the many houses built cheaply and quickly from northern pine.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Chicago was a pioneer in another way as well: it was a city of immigrants and of ethnic enclaves, even more so than New York. By 1871, a hundred and fifty thousand foreign-born people—from Germany and Ireland, but also from Norway, Poland, Bohemia, and other parts of Europe—lived in the city. The West Side neighborhood where the Great Fire broke out on the night of October 8th was working class and mostly Irish—“a &lt;em>;terra incognita&lt;/em>; to respectable Chicagoans,” as one local reporter described it, “thickly studded with one-story frame dwellings, cow-stables, pig-sties, corn-cribs, sheds innumerable; every wretched building within four feet of its neighbor and everything of wood.” Among the inhabitants was the Leary family, on DeKoven Street. Patrick Leary, a laborer who had served in the Union Army after emigrating from County Kerry, Ireland, and his wife, Catherine, who kept a dairy barn and cows and peddled the milk, had five children, between the ages of one and fifteen. (Sources often render the family&#39;s name as O&#39;Leary, but Berg suggests that Catherine usually went by Leary, without the “O.”) The couple owned a simple two-room house that the family lived in, and a similar one next to it, which they rented to a family called the McLaughlins.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;That fateful night, the McLaughlins were hosting a welcome party, complete with music, for a newly arrived Irish relative. Catherine Leary was in bed, falling asleep to the last strains of Patrick McLaughlin&#39;s fiddle playing, when her husband burst in shouting that their barn was on fire. Despite the widely recounted story about a cow kicking over a lantern while she was milking it, there is no evidence that the cows had been doing anything other than chewing their cud, or perhaps sleeping. In any case, Catherine later testified that she never milked the cows at night. An alternative scenario that some historians, including Berg, find plausible is that Daniel Sullivan, a neighbor who liked to smoke his pipe in the Learys&#39; barn, accidentally started the fire, and was too ashamed to admit it.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Whatever the spark, there was fuel aplenty in the city at large. The weather was an accelerant, but so were social conditions and political decisions. That Sunday evening was warm and windy, following a dry summer. Fires were persistent occurrences in Chicago, and every year, Berg tells us, the city&#39;s police and fire commissioners recommended a slew of reforms to combat them—banning tar roofs, fireproofing doors and shutters, expanding the ban on new wooden construction in the inner core of the city, purchasing the kind of floating fire engine that New York and Philadelphia had, which would “draw water from the river and throw it fifteen hundred feet in any direction,” and so on. Every year, a complacent, tightfisted city council turned down the recommendations.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Chicago did have a professional fire department, and its new steam-powered pumping engines had eliminated the need to hand-pump water. The engines may have looked like samovars on wheels, but they were up to date for the time. The problem was that, for a city of Chicago&#39;s size and flammability, the department didn&#39;t have enough of these engines or any other equipment, or nearly enough firefighters. (According to Berg, there was one firefighting brigade for every forty-five hundred buildings.) Moreover, the department depended on a system of watchmen perched in high places to spot the first glints of an inferno. This was no easy task in the jumble of a vast nineteenth-century conurbation. On the night of October 8th, the watchmen on duty did not spot the flames on DeKoven Street for nearly half an hour, delaying the initial response.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Before a fire brigade arrived, people on DeKoven Street rushed out of their houses with washtubs full of water. But they were no match for the relentless physics of the fire. Neither, in the end, were the firefighters. “The wind blowed every way,” Catherine Leary said later. “The fire went just the same as you would clap your two hands together.” The wind lofted small pieces of burning wood here and there, spreading fire to the east and north. Even more efficient were the whirlwinds of flame—so-called fire devils—caused by intense heat rising from the fire and encountering turbulent air above. They flung sparks higher and farther, allowing the blaze to jump the Chicago River. One fragment of burning wood set St. Paul&#39;s Church aflame, another the Cook County Courthouse, whose bell kept clanging, ominously, as fire destroyed the cupola that held it.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;For a while, it looked as if the fire would spare Chicago&#39;s water tower and pumping station—solid, castellated limestone structures, on Michigan Avenue, that supplied the water for all the city&#39;s hydrants. The tower did survive, but, in the early hours of October 9th, the pumping station succumbed to the flames. With that, the battle was lost. The proximity of Lake Michigan was a taunt. One newspaperman noted, “Though we had at our feet a basin sixty miles wide by three hundred and sixty long, and seven hundred feet deep, all full of clear green water, we could not lift enough to quench a cooking-stove.” All night long, the streets teemed with desperate, fleeing people, their faces mottled with soot and sweat or scorched by flame. Many were “harnessed to trucks filled with their household goods,” an observer said, and “sometimes the trucks were on fire.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;The chaos of a great city buckling under isn&#39;t easy to convey, and at times Berg&#39;s storytelling left me confused about the order or the significance of events. For a clearer overarching narrative, a reader might do better with the historian Carl Smith&#39;s brisk, gracefully written book “Chicago&#39;s Great Fire,” from 2020. Still, Berg—whose previous book was about Pierre Charles L&#39;Enfant and the design of Washington, DC—does offer some vivid set pieces. I won&#39;t soon forget his description of the doomed effort to put out an edition of the Chicago &lt;em>;Tribune&lt;/em>; when the city was in flames. As the tar roof of the &lt;em>;Tribune&lt;/em>; building melted and windows cracked, the paper&#39;s publisher, Joseph Medill, and its staff kept working to produce a news-packed edition. Then, at 7 &lt;em >;am&lt;/em>;. on Monday, “an ashen-faced man ran upstairs from the basement presses” to report that the paper&#39;s iron rollers had “melted into a mass.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Medill told his employees to evacuate, shouting to some of the men to grab the bound volumes that contained every past issue of the paper. As they reached the sidewalk with their stashes of history, the brittle old newspapers began to smoke. When the binders got too hot to hold, their would-be rescuers dropped them on the sidewalk, and ran from a fire that was now less than a block away. (Most issues from the first few years of the paper&#39;s publication were lost.) “Less than half an hour after Medill and his charges escaped with their lives and little else, the Tribune building&#39;s roof and floors gave way,” Berg reports. It was one of many Chicago institutions—the elegant Palmer House hotel, the famous department store co-founded by Marshall Field, the offices of nearly all the city&#39;s other newspapers—reduced to rubble.&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot;

Then, in the early hours of October 10th, rain started to fall. By the time the fire was spent, it had destroyed three and a half square miles of the city, wrecked seventeen thousand five hundred buildings, and left some hundred thousand people homeless. The county coroner eventually tallied the number of dead at three hundred, a figure that is still cited but is, as Berg argues, surely far too low: “Counting bodies was an exercise in gross overconfidence in the wake of a fire that had melted steel, marble, and glass” and was certainly hot enough to have disintegrated human bones. What&#39;s more, Chicago&#39;s population, especially the poor, included many residents who were nonliterate or spoke no English, moved often, or had no fixed address. The estimates have ranged widely, just as the count did for months in the wake of 9/11. By locking down the figure of three hundred, the county coroner and his staff perpetuated a lie. But, Berg writes, it was a lie that many Chicagoans were eager to believe because, in light of all that destruction, it was surprisingly small. It seemed to say that Chicago was not cursed but lucky.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In the century and a half since the fire, though, the lie about it that has proved most impervious—fireproof, you might say—is the one blaming Mrs. O&#39;Leary and her cow. Songs have been written about it—“A Hot Time in the Old Town Tonight” accuses “Old Lady Leary” of leaving a lantern in the shed. Norman Rockwell painted “Catherine O&#39;Leary” milking a cow he named Daisy. Popular lore keeps the story alive even today. It doesn&#39;t seem to matter that historians contradict this version of events, or that the Chicago City Council officially exonerated Catherine Leary back in 1997. Nowadays, the reasons for its persistence might be more or less harmless—the fire did, after all, start in the barn; cows are pleasing to draw or paint or even think about; the tale has a memorable, nursery-rhyme-like logic. But, as Berg and other historians have shown, the scapegoating of Leary was harmful. The accusations against her drew on and helped propagate noxious stereotypes of Irish immigrants. They served up class snobbery with a side of misogyny.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The story originated in rumor-filled and—in the style of the day—source-free newspaper accounts that soon appeared. These often portrayed Leary, who was in her early forties at the time, as “an old hag.” In some versions, she&#39;s slatternly, or her husband insufficiently commanding. If she hadn&#39;t been late with her milking, she wouldn&#39;t have needed a lantern, a pair of reporters, Elias Colbert and Everett Chamberlin, wrote in one of the insta-books that cropped up after the fire, and if she&#39;d “plied the dugs of the animal with proper skill” the cow wouldn&#39;t have kicked over the lantern: “The blame of setting the fire rests on the woman who milked or else upon the lazy man who allowed her to milk.” In other versions, she&#39;s outright nefarious, setting the fire on purpose. The Chicago &lt;em>;Times&lt;/em>; fantasized that she did so to avenge the city&#39;s having dropped her from its relief rolls.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Owing to the new telegraph network in the United States—and the completion of a transatlantic cable, in 1866, extending that network to Europe—the Chicago fire was, as Carl Smith writes, “the first instantaneously reported international news event, details of which reached an audience in the tens of millions while it was happening.” Such coverage brought donations pouring into Chicago from around the country. It also seeded false information, like the story about Mrs. Leary, far and wide. In reality, the Learys seem to have been hardworking, neighborly, and well liked. Their tenant Mrs. McLaughlin would later say of Catherine that “an honester woman I would never ask to live with.” Yet lookie-loos were soon thronging the neighborhood, hoping for a glimpse of a woman who might as well have been riding a broomstick. Catherine testified before the city commission investigating the fire, which concluded that she had not started it. Then she spent the rest of her life—she died in 1895—trying to trade in her pariah status for her former obscurity. According to her youngest son, James Patrick O&#39;Leary, who grew up to be a Chicago gambling and entertainment kingpin known as Big Jim, his parents told him that the story about the cow and the lantern was a “monumental fake.” Berg wonders if Big Jim fostered his own outsized Chicago legend to try to eclipse that of his long-suffering mother and her innocent cow.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;ttjauj&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;8vs3ct&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Like the stickiness of Mrs. Leary&#39;s bad rap, the political ramifications of the fire were both unpredictable and long-lasting. Berg is particularly sharp on this theme. The fire came at a time when Chicago&#39;s Yankee business élites had begun to worry about the electoral clout of immigrant neighborhoods, and their susceptibility to the kind of Tammany Hall machine politics that lately had taken over New York City. In the November municipal election after the fire, with Chicago newspapers stoking false rumors of urban lawlessness, Joseph Medill, of the &lt;em>;Tribune&lt;/em>;, managed to get himself elected mayor. Medill was one of history&#39;s classic mixed bags. He had been a fervent abolitionist and an influential early backer of Abraham Lincoln&#39;s bid for the Presidency. His dedication to his newspaper was immense. He was also a bit of a dry stick—gaunt and prematurely aged in appearance, highly suspicious of Irish Catholic immigrants and of the working class. Besides the &lt;em>;Trib&lt;/em>;, his great passions, if they may be called that, were civil-service reform, temperance, and habits of personal economy. He was not, in other words, destined to be a bigger-than-life Chicago pol.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Even before Medill was elected, the city had tried out versions of high-handed, business-backed, we-know-what&#39;s-best-for-you governance. In October, the maintenance of “good order and peace” in the city had been handed over to Philip Sheridan, a former Union general and a veteran of the brutal Indian Wars. That experiment in martial law lasted all of two weeks, until a Sheridan militiaman shot and killed an attorney who didn&#39;t respond to his who-goes-there signal. Meanwhile, the city entrusted its vast relief effort to a private agency, the Chicago Relief and Aid Society; it was run by one of Chicago&#39;s most illustrious lawyers, Wirt Dexter, and its accounts were overseen by one of its wealthiest businessmen, George Pullman, of train-car fame. The Society did provide thousands of displaced Chicagoans with food, clothing, and lumber to build houses. But its Gradgrindian dedication to red tape, data collection, and the sorting of the deserving from the undeserving inspired resentment. (Applicants seeking donated materials to rebuild their homes had, for example, to produce testimonials to their character, from a “reliable and well-known” citizen. Well known to whom? And how to track down such a person when you&#39;d lost everything and might not read or write, or speak English?) It made for a striking contrast with an aid group from Cincinnati, which arrived in town and ladled out soup to anyone who wanted it, no questions asked.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Medill&#39;s attempt to clean up the joint and persuade Chicago&#39;s working class to obey its betters would soon go awry. A move to close saloons on Sundays got German and Irish citizens marching in the streets. Still more provoking was Medill&#39;s vow to ban all wooden buildings within the city limits. That was all well and good if you were rich enough to build with stone or brick, but most working-class voters weren&#39;t. Wages had been frozen since the fire; rents had not. Disgruntled Chicagoans protested what they had begun calling the “relief, temperance, and fire-limits swindle.” The city council refused to go along with Medill&#39;s strict proposal—the council expanded the zone at the core of the city where wooden buildings could not be erected, but did not ban them beyond that. Defeated by this and other frustrations of office, Medill resigned before the end of his term.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“If Medill&#39;s tenure produced a single political legacy,” Berg writes, it was a “surge of power and cohesion displayed by Chicago&#39;s working class.” By the eighteen-eighties, Chicago had become the center of labor politics and the demand for the eight-hour day, of socialism and anarchism. As the city rebuilt, developing in the early twentieth century into a showcase of ambitious skyscraper architecture and modern capitalism, it was also, Berg observes, becoming a town of “politically powerful working men and women.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Remarkably, the fire barely interrupted Chicago&#39;s explosive growth—indeed, the scope of its rebuilding project attracted trainloads of workers and schemers and deep-pocketed entrepreneurs. By the turn of the century, Chicago&#39;s population had hit a million, making it the nation&#39;s second-largest city. The fact that the fire of 1871 (and another, smaller one in 1874) destroyed so much housing stock, Berg notes, helped to “make downtown a hothouse garden for all kinds of entrepreneurial and architectural innovations”—everything from mercantile enterprises like the Montgomery Ward warehouse and the splendidly reconstructed Marshall Field department store to the country&#39;s first skyscraper, the Home Insurance Building, completed in 1885. Metal and glass became a new way to build, and Chicago reëmerged with a spectacular, pinnacled skyline, and a permanent pride in it. (The arrival in the city of a young architect named Louis Sullivan just two years after the fire was serendipitous.)&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Still, historical memory works in curious ways. On October 8, 1871, the same night that the Great Fire broke out, a wildfire destroyed the town of Peshtigo, Wisconsin. As many as fifteen hundred people died. Even if the figure of three hundred dead for the Chicago fire is low, we can assume that many more were killed in Peshtigo. By some accounts, it remains the deadliest fire in American history. Yet the coverage of it was dwarfed by that of the Chicago conflagration, and few people today have heard of the Peshtigo calamity. The spectacle of a great city, a capital of pleasure-seeking and ceaseless striving, laid low—and its determination to come back bigger and more modern—made for a better story, then and now, than the levelling of some town in the middle of nowhere. But the two fires were intimately entwined. Peshtigo was a town of lumber mills, where the white pines from northern forests were turned into wood for Chicago&#39;s use. The Peshtigo blaze and a handful of other wildfires in Wisconsin and Michigan that summer were, Berg writes, in large part the consequence of “the clear-cutting and grading associated with thousands of miles of new woodland rail lines,” which eliminated natural windbreaks and land rises, and created wind tunnels in the arboreal gaps. The Peshtigo fire presaged the fires that now pose a larger threat than urban ones like Chicago&#39;s do, and in that respect, anyway, it has a claim to greater significance.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Late this summer, I visited the Chicago History Museum, where you can learn a lot about the Great Fire from its thoughtful exhibits. Downstairs is a room of dioramas, constructed in the nineteen-thirties, representing various Chicago scenes. I stood staring for a while at one showing the fire—clusters of neat, small buildings menaced by a wall of orange flames like a tidal wave. I could almost imagine myself in the scene—the heat rising up through the soles of my feet as I ran. Behind me, a man walked by with a young teen-ager, maybe his son. “Hey, what caused that fire, anyway?” the boy asked. “Some lady,” the older man said. “Some lady did it.” ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;pxskzl&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 02 Oct 2023 18:06:01 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[The Best Thirst Traps Money Can Buy]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/10/09/the-best-thirst-traps-money-can-buy]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-02T10:00:00.000Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65175e15bec0ec46cd347731/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/231009_r43142illuweb-site.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;article >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attribute-verso-pattern=&quot;article-body&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;ArticlePageChunks&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;The photographer David Suh offers solutions to some of contemporary life&#39;s conundrums. “Do you ever want to post a thirst trap but don&#39;t want it to be &lt;em>;too&lt;/em>; thirst trappy?” he asked a few months ago on Instagram, where he has nearly two million followers. Reveal a shoulder. Posing with a man who&#39;s shorter than you? “Have your short king wear heels,” he said on TikTok. “If he doesn&#39;t want to, leave him.” What if you&#39;re a &lt;em>;man&lt;/em>; who wants to post a casual thirst trap? “Pose with BDE,” he said—“bold, dynamic, effortless” energy—by, say, wearing a blazer without a shirt and pretending to read a magazine by candlelight. “Less is more.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The other day, Suh, who is twenty-nine, was standing in the reception area of his atelier, on the east side of Los Angeles—natural light, nude-hued pampas—where he does high-end photo shoots for regular people. Hopeful subjects can schedule a free thirty-minute consultation before booking a session that yields up to two dozen finished photographs. It&#39;s like Sears Portrait Studio, except that a session costs eight thousand dollars. (Prints are extra.) “It&#39;s five to six hours,” Suh said. “And it includes professional hair and makeup.” Not everybody makes the cut. “We consider people we can actually serve, people who say, &#39;I want to navigate through my identity because there are parts of me that I haven&#39;t explored,&#39; versus &#39;I just want a pretty picture to post.&#39; ”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Often, the latter “happen to be celebrities and influencers,” Suh said. “What they&#39;re looking for is so public-facing. There are so many better photographers to do that.” (Exceptions occur: last year, he said, he had an hour to shoot “personal branding photos” for Instagram&#39;s CEO, Adam Mosseri, who arrived with a security detail. “It was terrifying,” Suh said.)&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;His latest subject, Lily TranCat, a twenty-four-year-old financial analyst from Chicago, was waiting in a back room. Suh strode in wearing a beige polo shirt, black pleated pants, and patent-leather shoes. He asked if TranCat had found him on social media.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Well, I don&#39;t have social media,” TranCat said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“You &lt;em>;don&#39;t&lt;/em>; have social media,” Suh said. Mind blown. What would become of the day&#39;s output?&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;“They&#39;re just for me,” she said. “I want to look at them at my coffee table whenever I&#39;m feeling down, or if I need inspiration.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;TranCat walked Suh through the clothes she&#39;d brought: denim jumpsuit (“casual, comfortable,” she said), purple suit, white eyelet dress (“relaxed, twirlable”).&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“If this is twirlable, what is &lt;em>;this&lt;/em>;?” Suh said. He picked up the hem of a pale-pink taffeta gown.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;“Extremely twirlable,” TranCat said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Suh excused himself to plan the shoot with his studio manager, Maria Kristina Lander. They made notes, then Googled “suit badass portraits.” They decided to start with the denim jumpsuit. “Sometimes a client will be, like, &#39;I want to do that blazer look without anything underneath,&#39; ” Suh said. “That&#39;s really cool. That&#39;s a look we do a lot. But we need to warm up first.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Backdrops were unfurled; TranCat emerged from the makeup chair pink-cheeked and long-lashed. “We&#39;re going to interpretive-dance,” Suh announced. “I&#39;m going to be like a mirror.” He reached out his right arm; TranCat followed. He reached out his left arm; she followed. He flipped up his palms. They were doing the Macarena. She grinned. “There we go,” Suh said. “Perfect!”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Hands were placed in pockets, feet were angled, hips and shoulders were jutted out. Suh&#39;s shutter clicked. “You&#39;re going to do what I call basking in the sun,” Suh said, as TranCat draped herself across an Adirondack chair and tilted her head back. “Close your eyes because the sun is so bright. Yes, queen!”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Denim jumpsuit off, extremely twirlable gown on. Suh directed TranCat to swish. A hair-and-makeup artist named Jasmine Min waved a piece of cardboard (a minor breeze), then rustled the hem of the gown as if a subway-grate gust had puffed it up. “Throw that hem,” Suh said. “Throw more! OK, arm workout!” He continued, “Yes, queen! Can you actually jump this time?” TranCat laughed. “Basking in the sun, &lt;em>;big&lt;/em>; bask,” Suh said. “And, scene!”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Another costume change. Min and Suh moved a backdrop, revealing a wall hung with a framed portrait: Suh, bare-chested, white cape billowing, head tilted against the sun, eyes closed. A big bask, indeed.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“This is my 2023 vision board,” Suh explained. “At the end of 2022, I said, &#39;Who do I want to be at the end of next year?&#39; ”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Asked how the process was going, he said, “Right now, I&#39;m in the trenches.” ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;rlra3&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;mkhmtl&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 02 Oct 2023 18:06:01 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Flotsam, Jetsam, and a Soprano Amid the Black Mayonnaise]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/10/09/flotsam-jetsam-and-a-soprano-amid-the-black-mayonnaise]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-02T10:00:00.000Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65175d9ad324cac0c81eae10/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/231009_r43139illuweb-site.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;article >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attribute-verso-pattern=&quot;article-body&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;ArticlePageChunks&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Afloat in a plastic canoe on Newtown Creek, in remotest Maspeth at dusk, an art professor named Jane Beckwith stroked her paddle and conjured a scene at odds with the industrial setting. “This used to be, like, an oyster bed,” she said. “And there are fish! The fish come in from the ocean. If it hasn&#39;t stormed lately—it just depends on what the state of the water is, but people do fish, and they do eat the fish. They shouldn&#39;t! But people claim that this fish is pretty clean because it&#39;s just come from the ocean.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Newtown Creek, to be clear, is a Superfund site, owing to leaky Greenpoint refineries that have added some thirty million gallons of oil to the untreated sewage that streams in whenever it rains with any force. Black mayonnaise is the connoisseur&#39;s name for its sedimentary ooze. Pity the blue crabs. Beckwith was in the bow. Her friend Amy Gartrell was in the stern. A man who had just met them both sat amidships and pointed at a plastic bottle drifting northwest in the current, headed back to the East River, perhaps, and its ebbing tide. “There&#39;s a Gatorade fish right there,” he said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Yeah, if we&#39;re lucky, it&#39;ll be chock-full of its caviar—urine,” Gartrell said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;More boats were gathering: a center console with dual Yamahas, other canoes of varying sizes (including one painted to resemble a scaly serpent), some kayaks, a rowing dory, a couple of Hobie cats. “I mean, dolphins come up occasionally, and people have seen seals,” Gartrell went on. “It&#39;s really sad when one of them goes the wrong way, but they don&#39;t stay long.” Beckwith observed that their canoe was sliding toward the middle of the creek, which was frothing like a Jacuzzi. “Amy, are we staying clear of the bubbles or are we going into them?” she asked.&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot;

The bubbles, she explained, were produced by an aeration pipe laid atop the mayonnaise by the Department of Environmental Protection: supplemental oxygen for the aforementioned fish. Alas, studies have shown that it also perfumes the air with bacteria from below.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;&lt;em>;Pop!&lt;/em>; went the cork on a bottle in a neighboring canoe, and the man&#39;s thoughts floated briefly to a different sort of fizzy toxin. A small wooden barge arrived at the center of this motley flotilla, tugged there by a nautically inclined artist named Marie Lorenz driving an aluminum johnboat. The barge carried acoustic equipment and was festooned with fluorescent light sticks and suspended jetsam that clinked and chimed. A woman on board held a flute. Another turned out to be a soprano, who sang, “Welcome to the most polluted waterway in America!” The show—“Newtown Odyssey: A Floating Opera”—had begun.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Boating spectators gripped one another&#39;s gunwales to hold position against the southerly breeze. A skein of geese passed overhead in eerie synchronicity with the end of a scene, like fighter pilots after “The Star-Spangled Banner.” The libretto, written by the novelist Dana Spiotta, featured tour guides (“Don&#39;t touch the water!”), citizen scientists (“Help us heal it”), and real-estate developers, who promised five thousand luxury units (“All sustainable, of course”) and a floating, glass-bottomed gastropub. Satire, sure, but to the man in the middle of the canoe, envious of the nearby champagne and succumbing to a maritime trance as darkness fell, it sounded nice. A stray horn, a searchlight upwind, a marine radio hissing intermittently about bridge traffic: sometimes, amid this dystopian sublime, it was difficult to distinguish the choreography from the merely urban. A performer on the barge lay down with an illuminated stick and wanded it over the water&#39;s surface, revealing clumps of migrating foam but no prospective dinner.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Applause, at the end, came in the form of paddles thumped against hulls. The rower in the dory seemed to celebrate by circling the Jacuzzi bubbles with pent-up vigor. “Hopefully it won&#39;t take as long as Burning Man,” Beckwith said, alluding to the recent mud-soaked traffic jam in the Nevada desert, as the canoes all converged on the lone dock at once. While they waited, the man in the middle couldn&#39;t resist dipping his paddle in search of mayonnaise, but found rock instead. Did he touch the water? Yes, inadvertently, here and there. Did he wash his hands? Nope, forgot. Slightly delirious, he soon regained his balance on dry land and drove off in search of crab cakes. ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot;

Someone else mentioned that there had been a private event on Sunday—the one day of the week when the restaurant is usually closed. The last guests had trickled out at 4 &lt;em >;AM&lt;/em>; on Monday, and the managers hadn&#39;t left until six. The party was for Beyoncé, who had just played a sold-out show at MetLife Stadium, and Jay-Z. (“I buried the lede,” the publicist said.)&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Kwame Onwuachi, Tatiana&#39;s chef and proprietor, wouldn&#39;t normally be at the restaurant so early, but he was there to record a television segment for WNBC—his second of the day, after the “Today” show, at half past eight. “You&#39;ve had a busy morning!” the camera operator said. “It&#39;s not really morning if you don&#39;t sleep,” Onwuachi replied.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;For the segment, Onwuachi and a reporter named Lauren Scala were going to sample dishes that he&#39;d be cooking for an event at the US Open: pepper steak, hamachi escovitch, black-bean hummus topped with berbere lamb. A bottle of spring water was produced. Someone asked if there shouldn&#39;t be wine, too. “Are you gonna turn this water into wine?” Scala quipped.

Last November, he opened Tatiana, his first restaurant in New York City, his home town. Tatiana is named for Onwuachi&#39;s older sister, who helped raise him (an enormous portrait of her with her two daughters hangs in the private dining room), and its menu is inspired by his personal history. He grew up steeped in the cuisines of his elders—his roots are in Creole Louisiana, Nigeria, and the Caribbean—as well as in food from the city&#39;s corner stores, street carts, and Chinese restaurants.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;At Tatiana, he fills dumplings with crab and egusi, a traditional Nigerian soup made with pungent ground melon seeds. He deep-fries pods of okra until their ridges blister and split—slightly puffed, crisp, and salted, they&#39;re finished with honey and mustard powder, and served with a Trinidadian-style pepper sauce. For a dessert called Bodega Special, he makes a “cosmic brownie” (an homage to a Little Debbie product), which is dotted with rainbow-hued chocolate chips and paired with ice cream both flavored and shaped to look like a powdered doughnut.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The first time I ate at the restaurant, shortly after it opened, Onwuachi made the rounds, checking in with every table. One of my dinner companions told him that her name was Tatiana, and he insisted that she stand up for a long embrace. He was dressed in street clothes, including a do-rag. If this made it seem as if he wasn&#39;t actually working in the kitchen, the truth is that he doesn&#39;t usually wear chef&#39;s whites. Onwuachi, who is small and a bit boyish (“Booyakasha!,” he hollered, as he bounded down the steps to the basement prep kitchen), favors baseball caps and vividly patterned button-downs. He wears thick-framed glasses, which give him a slightly nerdy, erudite air, and he&#39;s heavily tattooed. For a while, he had the word “patience” inked on his right forearm, but he had it removed and replaced with an elaborate depiction of the ingredients for gumbo. A jumble of text on his left arm includes the words “New York City Kid,” in script; a large “X,” as in Malcolm; and the name of his ten-year-old niece, Madisyn, in her own handwriting.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;His look is fitting for a restaurant that feels more like a night club than like a stuffy house of fine dining. The space has floor-to-ceiling windows that are hung with curtains of slinky gold chains. Music—hip-hop and R. &amp;amp; B., much of it from the late nineties and early two-thousands—is played at a volume that can make conversation challenging, or at least athletic. In the first few weeks after Tatiana opened, when the staff was still getting its footing and tables weren&#39;t turning over fast enough to keep up with reservations, Onwuachi poured free tequila shots for waiting guests.&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;“You&#39;ll see some people walk in, and you see the surprise on their face,” Mouhamadou Diop, one of the restaurant&#39;s managers, said. He recounted an evening when an older white woman had wandered in after a Mostly Mozart concert. She asked what music was playing—it was Cardi B. “She said, &#39;I like this song,&#39; ” Diop told me. “And I said, &#39;Let&#39;s dance, then.&#39; ”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Last March, Pete Wells, the &lt;em>;Times&lt;/em>; restaurant critic, awarded Tatiana three stars, extraordinary for a rookie restaurant. Then came an even bigger shock: in April, when Wells published a list of the hundred best restaurants in New York, Tatiana held the No. 1 spot, ahead of Atomix, Le Bernardin, Via Carota, and other redoubtables. “We needed Tatiana. We needed a kitchen that puts Caribbean and African and Black American cooking, too often kept in the city&#39;s margins, right at center stage,” he wrote. “And after quarantines and masks and distancing and sundry social traumas, we needed a party.”&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot;

He knew the restaurant was a hit; it had been packed since pretty much the week it opened. But, he said, when a friend had sent him the link to the list on the day it was published, with a text that said, “Boom,” he&#39;d instinctively started scrolling to the bottom: “When I got to one hundred, I thought, Oh, I must have skipped it. And then I got back up to ten, and I was, like, &#39;No fucking way. No fucking way. No fucking way!&#39; ”&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Onwuachi had learned to temper his expectations when it came to establishment recognition. He&#39;d attended the prestigious Culinary Institute of America, in Hyde Park, New York, and worked as a kitchen stage, or intern, at Per Se. His first job out of school was at Eleven Madison Park. But he became disillusioned by the racism he experienced in fine-dining kitchens. At Eleven Madison Park, he and the few other Black cooks on staff were overlooked and even stymied by their white supervisor, he wrote in his 2019 memoir, “Notes from a Young Black Chef,” which he co-authored with the food writer Joshua David Stein. One day, Onwuachi raised concerns about alienating Black patrons. His boss laughed and said, “No Black people eat here anyway.” Onwuachi left the job not long afterward.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;From there, his career proceeded in fits and starts. In 2015, when he was twenty-five, he competed on “Top Chef,” placing sixth. (His downfall was serving store-bought frozen waffles with his fried chicken.) The following year, he opened his first restaurant, the Shaw Bijou, in Washington, DC In some ways, it was a prototype for Tatiana, with an autobiographical tasting menu and an opulent dining room. It closed after just two and a half months, thwarted by flighty investors and harsh judgment from the press. The food critic for the Washington &lt;em>;Post&lt;/em>;, Tom Sietsema, wrote that he had left feeling unimpressed and underfed. His review ended, “Pizza, anyone?”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;kgghy&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;It seemed that Onwuachi had finally found his footing with Kith/Kin, a restaurant in DC&#39;s InterContinental Hotel, which earned him the James Beard Foundation&#39;s Rising Star Chef of the Year award in 2019. (Previous honorees included Grant Achatz and David Chang.) But Onwuachi walked away from the restaurant in 2020, in the midst of the pandemic, after the hotel refused his request for a share of ownership. He relocated to Los Angeles, unsure if he&#39;d ever return to the kitchen, thinking he might become an actor instead. In LA, he took classes, went to auditions, and eventually landed a small part in “Sugar,” a movie about social-media influencers who become drug smugglers.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Onwuachi got a call from Lincoln Center in early 2022. In recent years, the institution had declared its commitment to expanding its programming, including food, beyond predictable Eurocentric fare. It was looking for someone to helm a new restaurant in the complex. Leah Johnson, a Lincoln Center executive, whose paternal grandparents were from Barbados, was delighted by the Caribbean elements of the dinner that Onwuachi prepared for the search committee, but she was also struck by his rainbow-cookie panna cotta, which, she told me, “tasted exactly like the cookies I grew up eating at Veniero&#39;s”—the hundred-and-thirty-year-old Italian bakery on East Eleventh Street. The committee offered Onwuachi the space, and accepted his terms: he would be not a chef for hire but, instead, an equity partner in the business.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Onwuachi was born on Long Island and raised in the Bronx. His parents, Jewel Robinson and Patrick Onwuachi, split up when he was three years old. Robinson, the daughter of a chef, was an avid home cook, and, after losing her job as an accountant, she opened a catering business, serving the Creole staples of her childhood. Five-year-old Kwame and ten-year-old Tatiana were often enlisted to help in the kitchen. In his memoir, Onwuachi recalled that his mother struggled with money, but that the business, whose clients came to include Queen Latifah and the hip-hop trio Naughty by Nature, satisfied her appetite for “glamorous adventure.” He wrote, “She&#39;d bring a change of clothes to a gala she was catering and, after her shift was done, slip in as a guest.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Onwuachi lived with Robinson in a cramped apartment, and saw his father mostly on weekends. Patrick, who worked as a construction project manager, took his son to the batting cages and on vacations, but he could be abusive. (“My job as his dad was to prepare him for the world,” Patrick said.) Around the age of ten, Onwuachi began to act out. “I was a &lt;em>;bad&lt;/em>; kid,” he told me. Robinson sent him to Nigeria to stay with his grandfather P. Chike Onwuachi, an Igbo chief and a luminary of the Pan-African movement who taught for many years at Howard University, so that he might “learn respect.”&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;Onwuachi finishes a dish of curried snow crab with a drizzle of Calabrian chili oil.&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/651716c256b28cf163e225da/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/231009_r43145.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/651716c256b28cf163e225da/master/w_120,c_limit/231009_r43145.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/651716c256b28cf163e225da/master/w_240,c_limit/231009_r43145.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/651716c256b28cf163e225da/master/w_320,c_limit/231009_r43145.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/651716c256b28cf163e225da/master/w_640,c_limit/231009_r43145.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/651716c256b28cf163e225da/master/w_960,c_limit/231009_r43145.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/651716c256b28cf163e225da/master/w_1280,c_limit/231009_r43145.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/651716c256b28cf163e225da/master/w_1600,c_limit/231009_r43145.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;Onwuachi finishes a dish of curried snow crab with a drizzle of Calabrian chili oil.&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;p >;What Robinson had billed as a single summer stretched to two years, during which Onwuachi lived without municipal electricity or water, and learned to raise livestock and grow vegetables. It&#39;s an experience that he references frequently, not only because it acquainted him so thoroughly with his heritage but also because it taught him at an early age how to adapt. “I was speaking pidgin within a couple months,” he recalled. But when he returned to the Bronx his rebellious streak flared up again. He was kicked out of Catholic school for antagonizing teachers and classmates, and he joined a gang at the Webster Houses, where his best friend lived. He worked at McDonald&#39;s, for $7.25 an hour, until he realized that he could make more money selling weed, an enterprise he continued in college, at the University of Bridgeport.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;There, Onwuachi&#39;s hustle caught up with him: before his first year was through, he was expelled for failing a drug test. He went to live with his mother, who had moved to Louisiana, and embarked on a “sad-ass parade” of menial jobs: as a prep cook for Robinson, who was an executive chef at a catering company; as a dishwasher; and as a server at a barbecue restaurant. Things began to look up when he got a gig cooking on a cleanup ship for the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. Onwuachi seemed to have little in common with the ship&#39;s mostly white “back-country Louisiana boys”—until he started to make the food that they had all grown up eating. Before long, he was put in charge of the kitchen.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In 2011, he enrolled at the CIA, where he dutifully learned the foundations of classical French cooking. He scraped together tuition money by running a catering company in the city, making burritos at a local Mexican restaurant, and selling ramen, boba tea, and pork buns behind the student rec center. (Not technically allowed, but the administration looked the other way.) The CIA offered no classes on Afro-Caribbean cuisine, but for a work-study program—a sort of free-choice elective that tasked him with preparing lunch for fellow-students—he made dishes from various countries in Africa, fermenting his own Ethiopian injera and blending his own spices.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Onwuachi&#39;s formal training inspired him to exalt Afro-Caribbean ingredients and techniques, rather than to simply plug Afro-Caribbean flavors into European formulas. The building blocks of his cooking, as laid out in his cookbook “My America,” include browning—a caramel made with canola oil and sugar, used in the Caribbean as a coloring agent and a sweetener—and Southern-style “house spice,” a customizable mixture that goes in everything from eggs to the flour for fried chicken. He treats these with the same uncompromising rigor that Paul Bocuse, patron saint of the CIA, might apply to mirepoix and hollandaise.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;When I visited Tatiana, Onwuachi returned again and again to the basement prep kitchen to inspect the minutest of activities, giving cooks exacting instructions on how thick to cut the short ribs for his pastrami suya, a recipe that combines Jewish deli meat and Nigerian barbecue. My favorite dish on the menu was a big bowl of Jamaican-style braised oxtail, served with a smaller bowl of rice and peas. The carrots on top of the rich, sticky segments of bone-in meat were Thumbelina, an adorable heirloom variety, and they were expertly “turned”—kitchen-speak for peeled and cut. The dish also incorporated perfect orbs of firm but tender chayote squash, lily-pad-like nasturtium leaves, and carefully sliced chives. It was beautiful, but it still managed to look, and, more important, to taste, like something you&#39;d eat at home, or at a family restaurant in the Bronx.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Onwuachi&#39;s work has been lauded for its specificity, for its fidelity to the places he comes from. In some ways, his success has uprooted him. He has the blinkered air of someone who is overscheduled; in the time I spent with him, he was never quite able to remember what he&#39;d done the day before, and was constantly checking the calendar on his phone. He travels frequently, keeping places in midtown Manhattan and West Hollywood. But he&#39;s long had a nuanced understanding of what gatekeepers in the food world like about his story. Of his admissions interview at the CIA, he wrote, “I cast myself partly as a lost wretch who had been saved (glossing over the exact nature of my transgressions at Bridgeport), partly as a one-man show of the black diasporic experience, and totally as a hustler.”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;l1h5y4&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Still, he bristles at being stereotyped. Before “Top Chef,” Onwuachi worked briefly for Dinner Lab, a startup that operated a members-only supper club in cities across the US When the founder, who was white, asked him to cook Senegalese food for a fund-raiser, Onwuachi politely declined. (He had no particular connection to Senegal.) In their initial pitch, the investors behind the Shaw Bijou suggested that he offer “upscale riffs” on Southern cooking. Again, he declined, for fear of “becoming an actor in the long and ugly play of degrading black culture for the benefit of white people,” he wrote.&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;On a typical night at the restaurant Onwuachi makes rounds in the dining room greeting guests.&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/651716c26a07ec7575029d48/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/231009_r43146.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/651716c26a07ec7575029d48/master/w_120,c_limit/231009_r43146.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/651716c26a07ec7575029d48/master/w_240,c_limit/231009_r43146.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/651716c26a07ec7575029d48/master/w_320,c_limit/231009_r43146.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/651716c26a07ec7575029d48/master/w_640,c_limit/231009_r43146.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/651716c26a07ec7575029d48/master/w_960,c_limit/231009_r43146.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/651716c26a07ec7575029d48/master/w_1280,c_limit/231009_r43146.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/651716c26a07ec7575029d48/master/w_1600,c_limit/231009_r43146.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;On a typical night at the restaurant, Onwuachi makes rounds in the dining room, greeting guests.&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;p >;His project, instead, is to develop a varied, idiosyncratic Black culinary idiom—and to bring it into the mainstream. Onwuachi seems to revel in the contradictions of his position—blaring “music with the curse words” at the home of the New York Philharmonic—but he&#39;s savvy about operating within the system. When I asked if he ever wanted to take a more radical approach, he was unequivocal. “I&#39;m a businessman,” he said. “I&#39;m an artist, sure, but I employ fifty people. I&#39;m playing my fucking music that I wanna play, we&#39;re putting oxtails on the menu, I&#39;m putting a Black woman&#39;s name on the side of Lincoln Center. I feel like I&#39;m being as radical as I want to be.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In late August, Onwuachi flew to DC, and then drove to a small town called Middleburg, at the foot of the Blue Ridge Mountains in Virginia&#39;s hunt country, an area that has long drawn élite weekenders from Washington. He was there for the third annual Family Reunion, a food festival that he started with Sheila Johnson, a co-founder of Black Entertainment Television and the first Black American woman to become a billionaire. In the late nineties, Johnson bought a horse farm in Middleburg. (Her young daughter was an aspiring equestrian.) One day, she noticed that a gun shop in the village center had a Confederate flag hanging in the window, so she bought the building that housed it. Later, she bought hundreds of acres of land nearby and placed most of it under conservation. In 2013, she opened a luxury resort, called the Salamander, on a small remaining parcel.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Johnson and Onwuachi met in 2019, at a conference in the Bahamas. “I was so intrigued by him,” Johnson said. “He was kind of introverted, so I got him out on the dance floor. He couldn&#39;t put two feet together. I said, &#39;I&#39;m gonna teach you how to dance.&#39; ” After Onwuachi left Kith/Kin, Johnson proposed that they work together. He conceived of the Family Reunion, a four-day gathering of Black chefs and food-industry professionals, plus enthusiasts who wanted to mingle with them, at the Salamander. The partnership has proved fruitful: since its inception, the Family Reunion has more than tripled in size, and next year Onwuachi and Johnson will open a restaurant together in the former Mandarin Oriental hotel in DC, which Johnson recently added to her portfolio.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;This year&#39;s Family Reunion was a &lt;em>;Who&#39;s Who&lt;/em>; of the Black American culinary world. The legendary pitmasters Bryan Furman and Rodney Scott, who had driven their rigs from Georgia and South Carolina, respectively, gave master classes on barbecue. A group of Caribbean American chefs from all over the US retrieved crackly-skinned whole pigs and spatchcocked chickens from a ditch that had been dug into the Salamander&#39;s lawn in order to illustrate the history of jerk, which originated, in Jamaica, with Indigenous people and Maroons—Africans who had escaped slavery—stealthily roasting wild game in pits. Virginia Ali, the eighty-nine-year-old co-founder of Ben&#39;s Chili Bowl, a DC restaurant famous for feeding civil-rights activists during the 1968 riots, provided half-smoke sausages and hot dogs for a cookout-themed buffet.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“You look wonderful,” Ali told Onwuachi on the first day of the festival, straining to be heard over a band rehearsing at top volume. “Hard work agrees with you.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“It does, right?”他说。 “I think I&#39;m addicted to it.”&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;A group of people sit at a table spread with dishes at Tatiana.&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/651716c2bec0ec46cd347399/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/231009_r43147.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/651716c2bec0ec46cd347399/master/w_120,c_limit/231009_r43147.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/651716c2bec0ec46cd347399/master/w_240,c_limit/231009_r43147.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/651716c2bec0ec46cd347399/master/w_320,c_limit/231009_r43147.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/651716c2bec0ec46cd347399/master/w_640,c_limit/231009_r43147.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/651716c2bec0ec46cd347399/master/w_960,c_limit/231009_r43147.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/651716c2bec0ec46cd347399/master/w_1280,c_limit/231009_r43147.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/651716c2bec0ec46cd347399/master/w_1600,c_limit/231009_r43147.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;The menu at Tatiana draws inspiration from Nigerian, Caribbean, and Creole cuisine, as well as from New York&#39;s street carts and corner stores.&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;p >;Onwuachi spent the weekend in a state of perpetual motion. He roamed the Salamander&#39;s grounds, sometimes in a golf cart, with a demeanor that was part summer-camp director, part pastor, part door-to-door salesman. He greeted guests with a cheerful, if slightly canned, “Welcome home!” and doled out hugs and collegial shoulder squeezes. In many ways, the event was an advertisement for him: its full title—“Kwame Onwuachi Presents the Family Reunion”—was even printed on the tags of the T-shirts and hoodies for sale at the merch table, which was staffed by his mother, his sister, a former babysitter, and two childhood friends.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Much of the time, he was trailed by a documentary film crew from Bronxville, a production company that he co-founded with the filmmaker Randy McKinnon, who adapted “Notes from a Young Black Chef” into a screenplay. (It was acquired by A24.) Hovering close behind, carrying a tote bag full of bottled water, was a strikingly tall young man with his hair in twists, whose name was Destined One Leverette. The Family Reunion arranges room and board for volunteers, and Leverette insisted that he had applied for a position—yet the organizers had no record of it. He&#39;d come, on his own dime, from Birmingham, Alabama, where he worked in the kitchen of a chain restaurant called Pappadeaux Seafood Kitchen. He was nineteen. Onwuachi said that he&#39;d taken pity on Leverette: “He&#39;s, like, &#39;I&#39;m ready to work.&#39; I&#39;m, like, &#39;Where&#39;s your chef coat?&#39; He&#39;s, like, &#39;I don&#39;t have it.&#39; I was, like, &#39;Well, then, you&#39;re going to just do whatever is needed.&#39; ”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Onwuachi had learned at the first Family Reunion that he couldn&#39;t host the event and cook for it at the same time. (His eyes widened when I asked if he&#39;d be doing both.) The task of schmoozing with guests suited him, but he kept a close eye on the food and the service. He became noticeably irked when he saw a snaking, slow-moving queue for Scott and Furman&#39;s barbecue. In an instant, he switched modes, suddenly chillier and more mercenary as he summoned an assembly line for pre-portioning plates. Servers tensed and hustled as Onwuachi shouted directions and called for extra hands. By the start of the evening&#39;s late-night R. &amp;amp; B. karaoke party (dress code: all white), he was once again the gregarious mc, wearing silk pajamas and revving up the crowd.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;ofrfoe&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;The festival&#39;s corporate underwriters included Coca-Cola, United Airlines, and Wells Fargo, the last of which hosted a talk on “elevating Black wealth.” But what might have felt like a cynical commercial exercise was infused with a sense of purpose and an unmanufactured joy. During a surprise performance by the R. &amp;amp; B. singer Joe, Onwuachi wrapped his arms around Johnson as they swayed to the music. At lunch on the final day, Onwuachi invited Leverette onstage and introduced him to the crowd as “a young man who showed up on the doorstep of the Family Reunion.” Afterward, Leverette was rushed by well-wishers offering jobs and, in one case, cash: a generous stranger wired him five hundred dollars. (Leverette later admitted that he&#39;d fibbed about applying to volunteer at the festival; he had, in fact, just shown up.)&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;That evening, after the première of a Lexus commercial that featured Onwuachi driving around Los Angeles, he and Johnson presented a lifetime-achievement award to Jessica B. Harris, the renowned culinary historian. In her acceptance speech, Harris called Onwuachi “the linchpin, a pivot point”—a connector of people and traditions. A few weeks later, when I spoke to Harris by phone, she noted the “dynastic” way that Onwuachi came into the food world, through his mother&#39;s career. “His food embodies his stories, and his stories are really personal,” she said. “There are a lot of places that tell stories that are researched.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Onwuachi&#39;s staff at Tatiana see themselves reflected in his food. The majority of the restaurant&#39;s cooks and servers are people of color. “It&#39;s like the Family Reunion—Black people just come,” he told me, laughing. The back-of-house environment is one of camaraderie and friendly competition. As I watched line cooks set up their stations, an intern pulled something out of a cabinet. “Why is there a bag of . 。 。 Lay&#39;s?,” she asked, holding up an industrial-sized bag of potato chips and looking genuinely befuddled. “Oh, that was for Jay-Z, but he didn&#39;t eat them,” Onwuachi explained. “We&#39;ll have them after service.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The chips had been intended for osetra caviar, two tins of which had also gone uneaten. Onwuachi doesn&#39;t usually offer specials at Tatiana, but that morning he&#39;d started to think about how he could sell what was left. For a jerk-cod entrée, the pastry team was making corn bread; maybe he&#39;d serve squares of it topped with the caviar and crème fraîche. By the time the front-of-house staff arrived, the idea had evolved. “Corn-bread pudding,” he announced. “With a quenelle of caviar. That&#39;s more interesting to me.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;He bloomed curry powder in butter in a pot on the stove, then crumbled in the corn bread and added heavy cream and oat milk. When it had cooked down into a smooth, thick paste, he tasted it. “Fucking great!” he declared. “That&#39;s fun.” Instead of crème fraîche, he decided to top it with the white sauce that he makes for his halal-cart-inspired shawarma chicken. In the finished dish, the gentle heat of the curry and the sweetness of the warm pudding were offset by the cool, tangy white sauce and a salty plink of caviar at the end of each bite.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“No! Chef, no way!” Chase Ford, one of the line cooks, said as he tried the pudding. “I got chills.” It tasted, he said, exactly like a cornmeal porridge that his mother, who is Jamaican, had made when he was a kid. He remembered eating it sitting in her lap. ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 02 Oct 2023 18:06:01 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
