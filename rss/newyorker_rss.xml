data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;周二，Cherelle Parker 在钣金工人大厅登台宣布她当选为费城第一百任市长。帕克现年五十一岁，身穿红色蕾丝动力服。 “上帝是好的！”她向观众喊道。 “每时每刻！”人群爆发出阵阵欢呼声。 “很多竞选专家认为他们会告诉我们应该如何走路、说话和行动才能赢得选举并获得选票，”帕克身边站着她 11 岁的儿子兰斯顿和她的政治导师前市议员玛丽安·塔斯科开始说道。 “感觉不太对劲。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;11 月 7 日，帕克以 75% 的选票轻松击败了共和党候选人、前市议员 David Oh。真正的竞选是在去年春天的初选中，一开始，她的前景看起来很暗淡，对手包括知名度更高、资金更充足的候选人，其中包括在帕克左翼竞选的城市控制者丽贝卡·莱哈特(Rebecca Rhynhart)，以及社区的海伦·吉姆(Helen Gym)。组织者和进步宠儿，获得了 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tag/bernie-sanders&quot;>;伯尼·桑德斯&lt;/a>; 和 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker .com/tag/alexandria-ocasio-cortez&quot;>;亚历山大·奥卡西奥-科尔特斯&lt;/a>;。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“我不是那些人中的一员，”帕克告诉我。 “我不是一个撤资者。我不是左派。我认为其中很多都是废话。”相反，她以直言不讳的中间派身份参选，承诺让费城变得“安全、清洁和绿色”。在第一次市长辩论中，她表示反对取消对警察的资助。她是唯一支持拦截搜查警务的民主党候选人，根据宾夕法尼亚州美国公民自由联盟分析的数据，这对费城黑人产生了不成比例的影响。她还提议该市再雇用三百名警察，《费城》杂志&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.phillymag.com/news/2022/03/ 30/cherelle-parker-police-plan/&quot;

rel=&quot;nofollow noopener” target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;被称为&lt;/a>;“倒退”和“浪费。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;去年夏天，我在凯利格林排屋外遇见了帕克，她的曾祖母当时住在那里她还年轻，在草莓大厦。 “如果你不知道我来自这里，你就无法理解我对某些政策举措的热情，”她告诉我。七十年代，草莓大厦是黑人工人阶级的主要社区，居民们种着颜色协调的天竺葵和凤仙花盆。 “这里没有人富有。但每个人都有足够的东西，并且渴望照顾好自己所拥有的东西，”帕克说。但是，随着费城成为全国最贫穷的大城市，这个社区变得年久失修。人行道弯曲了，她小时候擦洗过的家门前台阶上的绿色油漆剥落了。 “在竞选过程中，当我谈到擦洗台阶时，年轻人看着我，就像在问‘她穿什么衣服？’ ”帕克笑了。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;在门廊上，帕克的五位家庭成员——两个阿姨和三个表兄弟姐妹——都是女性——坐在那儿听着。他们时不时地闯进来嘲笑帕克，当她的表兄弟第一次预测她将成为市长时，帕克才八岁。 “她不停地说话、说话、说话、说话、说话，”帕克的姨妈玛琳·特赖斯说。 “哦，宝贝，她会说话了！” Trice 穿着一件爱心小熊 T 恤，上面写着“小心，我脾气暴躁”，她是“爱心厨房”的创始人兼首席执行官，这是她于 2005 年在帕克地下室创办的一个食品储藏室。 of Love 服务由老年人领导，他们每周出现 3 次，时间为凌晨 4:30&lt;em>;AM&lt;/em>;。一盒三十磅的花生酱、金枪鱼和蔬菜，还有一块两磅的奶酪。“我不要求提供身份证明。没什么。如果你排队，你就需要它，”特赖斯说。她环顾四周，看看他们老邻居的情况。 “看看那些垃圾，”她嘟哝道。 “我们可以整夜坐在外面，把门开着，然后去商店，”她解释道。 “现在你连门都不敢来了。”&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt; /div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;帕克带我去草莓大厦是为了表达一个更重要的观点。 “我从小就知道政治只是一种用来决定如何分配稀缺资源的工具，”她告诉我。 “如果我没有看到我的税款在我所居住的社区发挥作用，那么这个流程又如何发挥作用呢？”她不满地看了一眼垃圾遍地的街区。 “我看到玻璃，我看到垃圾。我没有看到生意兴隆。我不想让我的孩子去公园玩，因为公园里有针。我不想让他在那里打篮球。”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;一个陌生人走过，对帕克喊道：“我为你走到了人行道上！”她身着黑衣，在去餐饮工作的路上，自我介绍为托莎·泰勒(Tosha Taylor)，一位社区组织者，在初选期间曾为帕克上门。 “这不仅仅是她想要做出改变的事实，”泰勒说。 “这是我感觉到的事实。”泰勒是十个孩子的母亲。 “我把十个人都养大了，”她告诉帕克。 “我教他们如何清洁，我教他们如何做饭。我教他们如何成为社会的模范人物。”通过烹饪学校，她找到了摆脱无家可归和住在庇护所的出路。现在泰勒开始相信，贸易学校可以消除代际贫困。&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot;

数据-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;费城 150 万居民中近一半是黑人，他们意识到自己巨大的政治权力。 “黑人在电视和手机上看到他们的选票在 2020 年很重要，”州代表唐娜·布洛克 (Donna Bullock) 告诉我。 “这就是为什么这么多人试图通过跨越州界线并在车里放枪来阻止计票。”费城的黑人选民可以通过参加民意调查来决定 2024 年总统选举的结果——令许多人惊讶的是，帕克关于公共安全的信息引起了这些选民的共鸣。 “切雷尔是最早提出黑人确实希望执法部门参与使我们的城市更安全的人之一，”州参议院议员谢里夫·斯特里特告诉我。 “我们只是希望他们做好自己的工作。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;帕克的批评者认为她的想法是危险且不合时宜的。她的许多建议，例如安装监控摄像头和扣押非法车辆，都属于“破窗”理论，该理论可以追溯到十九世纪八十年代，并将退化的自然环境与较高的犯罪率联系起来。几乎没有可靠的证据支持这一理论，但它的受欢迎程度仍然存在。 “如果她追求‘打破窗户’，这些可怕的倒退政策就会失败，”废奴主义者法律中心执行主任、宾夕法尼亚大学法学院讲师罗伯特·萨利姆·霍尔布鲁克告诉我。 “一旦他们这样做，我们就会把她的政府告上法庭，这将使该市损失数千万美元。”&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;上个月，帕克漫不经心地说道，作为市长，她将派遣国民警卫队在肯辛顿的街道上巡逻，这里是该市阿片类药物流行的中心。 “切雷尔帕克有这样的想法，她将带领国民警卫队在肯辛顿大道上追捕吸毒者，但他们没有接受过这样做的训练，”霍尔布鲁克说。 “他们的任何失误都会影响到她。” （帕克后来收回了这一评论。）&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;费城是美国种族隔离最严重的城市之一，白人居民仍然居住在传统的爱尔兰和意大利裔美国人飞地中，黑人居民则被隔离在最贫困的社区，并且几个世纪以来-种族化执法的悠久历史。但无论是在费城还是其他地方，人们对治安的态度并不因种族而不同。 “有一种白人自由主义谬论，认为有色人种反对警察，”2008 年至 2016 年担任费城市长的迈克尔·纳特 (Michael Nutter) 告诉我。 “这不是真的。他们反对警察的暴行。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;纳特是拦截搜查的大力支持者，这是更大的犯罪威慑计划的一部分。正如他所说，“把枪留在家里，否则你会进监狱的。”但拦截搜查在这座城市有着令人沮丧的历史。 “当你深入研究这些数据时，你会发现在拦截搜身过程中被拦下的人中有 90% 是无辜的，”过去 50 年来一直在费城执业的民权律师戴维·鲁多夫斯基 (David Rudovsky) 告诉我。 。 2010 年，鲁多夫斯基起诉该市违宪使用拦截搜查的做法，在过去的十年里，费城一直受到法院命令来监督这种做法。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;费城人对这一做法的看法仍然存在分歧。警察。 2017 年，他们选举拉里·克拉斯纳 (Larry Krasner) 为地区检察官，其纲领是结束执法官员有罪不罚的现象。此后，克拉斯纳指控四名警官犯有谋杀罪，这是费城执勤警官首次被定罪。他的反大规模监禁政纲，包括终止现金保释和将低级犯罪非刑罪化，为他赢得了黑人支持者，并使他成为宾夕法尼亚州政治中两极分化的人物。他是共和党州议员弹劾运动的对象，并且经常被执法部门指控为“反警察”。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;帕克已宣布对执法部门的不当行为采取零容忍政策，但她坚信警察在解决枪支暴力方面发挥着作用。她的主动警务计划包括派遣 300 名新警官前往 10 个社区，步行或骑自行车。为了捍卫自己的愿景，她援引了早期田园诗般的费城——她回忆道，在那里，步行殴打警察是“守护者，而不是战士”。 （克拉斯纳的一位发言人表示，地方检察官“期待与当选市长合作”，但对帕克的提议表示怀疑。“仅仅向该部门增加更多警察是不够的，”发言人说。“我们需要他们实际到场，做好本职工作，遵守部门规定和法律。”)&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt; “我不会因为支持警察或不关注枪支暴力的根本原因而受到欺负，”帕克说。 “任何有两只眼睛的人都可以看到，我们无法通过警察来摆脱困境，但是，无论人们是否喜欢，公共安全都是解决方案的一部分。”她补充道，“在我生活的世界中，黑人社区想要稳定和安全。”帕克以自己为案例研究：她是一个住在费城西北部的十一岁男孩的母亲，男孩有着顽皮的微笑。她希望警察能够获得更多资金并在现场帮助她的儿子上下学。&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;90vdh&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot; client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;帕克通过引用她在费城的成功政策组合来捍卫她加强警务的计划。她从十七岁起就在政府工作。 “我不是新来的约翰尼，”帕克反驳道。 “作为整体方法的一部分，这座城市应该积极主动地维持治安。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;帕克自称是 OAM（“老屁股妈妈俱乐部”）的成员，并以她的文学英雄的名字为儿子命名为兰斯顿 (Langston)。哈莱姆文艺复兴的关键人物。 （我第一次认识帕克是通过她的儿子，她的儿子和我一起上二年级和三年级。）“兰斯顿休斯代表尊严，”帕克告诉我。 “我也唱美国。”她最喜欢的诗，休斯的《母子》，以“我的生活不是水晶楼梯”开头，讲述了帕克所面临的挑战。她说：“说实话，我的每一项政策处方都深深扎根于我小时候经历过的痛苦中。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;她的母亲在费城生下帕克时才十六岁；她的母亲在她出生时就已经十六岁了。她的亲生父亲很少在身边。当她十一岁时，她的母亲去世了；这位费城当选市长是由她的祖母（一名家庭佣工）和她的祖父（一名残疾海军退伍军人）以及更大的社区网络抚养长大的。 “有时候你的血统还不够，”她说。 “你需要你的爱情热线。爱情线就是村庄。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;为了抚养孙女，她的祖父母依靠每两周九十八美元的现金援助以及食品券。 “我小时候讨厌那种狗屎，”她说。 “那些食品券扰乱了我的信心，但我的祖母会用逆反心理说，‘哦，那么那些有钱的人就比你好吗？’ ”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;在竞选市长之前，帕克从未在公开场合讲过这些故事。令她惊讶的是，她发现自己的经历引起了共鸣。 “当你谈论粮食不安全时，我知道得到一块五磅重的剩余奶酪是什么感觉，”她说。当她描述奶酪如何切得不对时，她看到人们点头。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;然而，帕克非常清楚，她的个人传记并不是为了博取怜悯。 “我不是一个一次性的人，”她说。 “人们对我抱有很大的期望。无论我做什么，我的祖母和祖父都希望我做得非常好。”解决方案并不是让外人“进来拯救——或者为——切雷尔感到难过”。 “不，”她说。 “你想帮助切瑞尔吗？让她参加 AP 课程。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;对于帕克来说，教育在经济和智力上提供了一条出路。 “在我爱上莎士比亚、贝克特和《坎特伯雷故事集》并理解这些主流经典作品的价值之前，我必须找到自我意识，”她说。她最喜欢的高中老师向她介绍了非裔美国文学。 “当我谈到我最好的朋友和榜样玛雅·安吉卢、恩托扎克·尚格和索尼娅·桑切斯时，人们问我是否还在教堂里见到我的老师，”帕克高兴地说。 “当他们得知她是一名白人女性时感到震惊。”她喜欢混淆简单的假设，尤其是有关种族的假设。 “我的村庄是多元化的，”她补充道。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;帕克的政治生涯始于高中，当时她凭借一篇关于非裔美国女性文学力量的演讲赢得了一场演讲比赛。奖品包括塞内加尔之旅。她还获得了前市议会成员、费城最有权势的民主党政客之一玛丽安·塔斯科的实习机会。塔斯科告诉帕克，衡量一个政治家最重要的标准是她为社区带回的资源——正如帕克所说，“你如何利用你的政治来改善娱乐中心？”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr- viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;帕克就读于林肯大学，这是一所位于切斯特县的历史悠久的黑人学校，也是兰斯顿休斯的母校。毕业后，她在新泽西州短暂教授高中英语，直到塔斯科聘请她为职员。 “我认为我的学生是我的一部分，”帕克说。 “我不想让他们认为我正在放弃他们。”然而塔斯科说服帕克，在政府工作将使她能够为整个学区制定资金战略，从而扩大她的影响力。 2004年，帕克成为当选宾夕法尼亚州众议院议员的最年轻的黑人女性。她在那里待了十年，担任费城代表团主席。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;宾夕法尼亚州首府哈里斯堡位于费城以西仅一百零五英里，但它反映了截然不同的政治关切。沿着宾夕法尼亚州收费公路，哈里斯堡外的一个谷仓邀请路人“忏悔”，并提醒人们宾夕法尼亚州拥有五万二千个农场。然而，在哈里斯堡，帕克证明她在与本党不同派系以及跨党派的合作方面取得了巨大成功，制定了帮助费城财政更加稳定的经济政策，将该市养老基金的赤字削减了一半，并实施征收香烟税来资助公共教育。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“我不能说，‘如果你不同意我的意识形态，我就不会和你说话，’”她告诉我。 “我们必须愿意建立必要的联盟。”帕克还因直言不讳地捍卫费城的需求而闻名，她成功主张宅基地豁免减免，该减免于 2023 年通过成为法律，并要求较富裕的居民缴纳更多税款。 “我厌倦了看到那些住在主线上带游泳池的大房子里的人不付任何费用，”她告诉我。&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data- testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;mgpwii&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data- trip-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;在哈里斯堡，帕克发展了她作为演说家的力量。 “她讲述的故事让人们想象作为一个单身黑人妈妈或作为一个从监狱回来的年轻人的生活，”州代表唐娜·布洛克告诉我。 “有些人警告我不要成为她，因为这让他们感到不舒服。”在宾夕法尼亚州立法机关任职的数千人中，一小部分是黑人女性。布洛克告诉我，“甚至想把自己置于那种境地，这在某种程度上是疯狂的。”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper &quot;

sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;Parker at Reading Terminal Market. &lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Governing Philadelphia appears similarly daunting. Among major American cities, it&#39;s the worst in terms of poverty and crime rates. It also ranks fourth in the nation for deaths related to opioids, a crisis worsened by the introduction of fentanyl and xylazine, which is also known as Tranq, a veterinary sedative that is more addictive than heroin—and far more dangerous. The economic downturn caused by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tag/coronavirus&quot;>;the coronavirus pandemic&lt;/a>; struck Philadelphia particularly hard, and the city has been slow to recover, with joblessness rates nearly double that of the national average. “If anyone just looks at the city and all of the challenges, they&#39;d say, &#39;Whoever wants to be mayor of this city is certifiably out of their mind,&#39; ” Parker told me.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;As mayor, Parker will have to stanch the flow of money and people away from Center City, Philadelphia&#39;s urban heart. “This is what keeps me up at night,” Parker said, one afternoon in July. She&#39;d convened a group of eight real-estate and other investors and union leaders in a conference room of the Cira Centre, a twenty-nine-story glass shard that sits across the Schuylkill River from Center City. Through the window, a statue of William Penn, who founded the Commonwealth in 1681, was narrowly visible atop City Hall. By law, Penn&#39;s statue once marked the highest point in Philadelphia. Now he was dwarfed by office towers, at least four of which were being boarded up.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Gabe Morgan, a vice-president of the 32BJ Service Employees International Union, which represents ten thousand custodial and office workers in Philadelphia, spoke next. “Our members are afraid of vacant buildings,” he began. Approximately eight out of ten of their members in Philadelphia were working-class Black people, and, he noted, a vast majority had voted for Parker. Those workers relied on their jobs in Center City office buildings, which belonged to executives like Jerry Sweeney, the founder and CEO of Brandywine Realty Trust. Sweeney, who sat next to Morgan, runs a company with a large portfolio of Philadelphia real estate, including the Cira Centre.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;When Morgan and Sweeney typically met, they wrestled over contracts and terms as part of complex labor negotiations. “Two weeks from now, we&#39;ll be bargaining and I&#39;ll sound different,” Morgan said. “But, in partnering with business, we have to collaborate to save a huge job base that&#39;s not replaceable.” Parker was proud to have brought these two leaders together. “I&#39;ve watched some constituencies thrive on creating David versus Goliath, as workers versus business. In my world, you don&#39;t pit one against the other,” she said. “When people are in office buildings, I see security guards and janitorial staff. These are the homeowners in the City of Philadelphia, who, because of their union membership, are earning a living wage.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Afterward, as Morgan rode down in the elevator, he explained why his union, which was considerably more left-leaning than Parker, had supported her from the start. She was a pragmatist, and the decisions she made reflected the bread-and-butter interests of his members. “Cherelle can look at things and say, &#39;I&#39;m going to measure this by what helps people like me,&#39; ” Morgan said. “And that&#39;s very different from being a white progressive.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;The next day, Parker was in Kensington, the Philadelphia neighborhood hit hardest by the opioid crisis. The stretch of Frankford Avenue beneath the elevated train tracks was lined with storefronts, including Cash Express, which offers quick loans, and faith-based outreach organizations, like the Rock, which offers boxing and ministry. The sidewalk was strewn with discarded needles and occupied by colorful nylon tents; people in the throes of addiction slumped in beach chairs. One woman stood by a parked truck, using its side mirror to find a vein in her neck.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Kensington&#39;s drug crisis grew more extreme during the pandemic. Those injecting Tranq, along with heroin and fentanyl, are often covered with open sores, which can become so severely infected that users are prone to losing limbs. The harm-reduction movement argues that it might not be possible to get people off these drugs, but that safe-injection sites can lower rates of death and infectious disease, as well as the amount of drug paraphernalia on the streets.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In 2018, a local nonprofit called Safehouse proposed opening a safe-injection site in Philadelphia. “I&#39;ve visited such sites in New York and St. Louis, and what I&#39;ve seen is people getting access to health care and social-work services,” Kendra Brooks, a city-council member from the Working Families Party told me. Parker is vehemently opposed to them, fearing that safe-injection sites will perpetuate the sale of illegal drugs. “Someone called me anti-science, but that&#39;s bullshit,” she said. “When you&#39;ve had loved ones suffer from addiction, the last thing they needed was a safe place to do the drugs.”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;wl8xhd&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;That morning, Parker—who campaigned on building thirty thousand new housing units—was visiting a red brick warehouse in Kensington, a defunct paper-archiving facility recently converted into some two dozen low-income lofts. A local community-development corporation, Impact Services, had cobbled together twenty-four million dollars for the project, a combination of low-income tax credits, public and private funding, and government loans.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“This twenty-four million is not based in ideology,” Parker told me, in the pristine multipurpose room. “It&#39;s based in people who are going to work to make this possible.” Parker gestured toward Bill McKinney, of New Kensington Community Development Corporation, and Casey O&#39;Donnell, of Impact Services. O&#39;Donnell explained that this development strategy was designed to protect residents against displacement, by rehabilitating their houses and organizing civic groups. At the request of those residents, they&#39;d cleared Hope Park, a rare green space in Kensington, which until recently had served as an open-air drug market and tent encampment. They&#39;d partnered with the city to bulldoze the area that had served as a toilet and built a fancy new gated fence, to which residents now had a key. After surveying from the community, they wouldn&#39;t be leasing commercial space to methadone clinics or other businesses that serviced addiction and recovery, a decision Parker applauded. “Communities are drained of life by these places,” she said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Parker had invited along Marnie Aument-Loughrey, a Kensington resident since 1970. A local ward leader, Loughrey recalled that, during the primary campaign, she&#39;d told Parker, “I love you, but I can&#39;t support you unless you come out here and do a walkaround.” So Parker did. “No police, no extra entourage,” Loughrey had said. She wanted to show Parker how little the city had done to support longtime residents. Loughrey&#39;s thick accent recalled a generation of white, working-class Philadelphians who lived in Kensington before the crack epidemic, in the eighties. She wasn&#39;t afraid to flash her old-school credentials, including an admiration for Frank Rizzo, the notorious mayor who is sometimes called the Donald Trump of Philadelphia. (During his reign, in the seventies, police officers killed one civilian a week on average.) “I&#39;m not ashamed to say it,” she said. “I don&#39;t fight for me—I fight for my community.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“No one is going to decide what&#39;s going to happen for the people in Kensington and the people of Kensington not be a part,” Parker said. She proceeded upstairs to one of the soon-to-be occupied lofts. Peering out of a picture window, Parker talked about “affordable luxury”: amenities like high-quality appliances that represent the dignity with which people like to live. She was skeptical of tiny houses—one solution that housing activists were proposing for Philadelphia. If a sense of ownership was related to pride and space, who aspired to a doll&#39;s house? “Maybe people want to be crammed into a tiny house, but I don&#39;t think we need to lowball expectations,” she said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Black women are the backbone of the Democratic Party,” Bullock, the state representative, told me. “We are behind every labor movement, women&#39;s movement, and the civil-rights movement. If you look at it, Black women have been doing the work all the time. And now we&#39;re also getting the opportunity to lead.” One afternoon in August, Parker invited a group of twenty-some Black women organizers to meet up at Coffee Cream and Dreams, a Black-owned coffee shop about a mile from Fairmount Park. Many were members of Cherelle&#39;s Corner, a woman-led effort to support Parker, with the slogan “We&#39;ve Got Her Back!” Some had known Parker for decades as friends and fellow grassroots political leaders.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“This right here is a group of women who I still get daily texts from,” Parker told me, scanning the crowd as she entered. Settling into a seat at one of the café&#39;s tables, which had been pushed together into a U, Parker invited each participant to introduce herself and name her principal concern for Philadelphia: trash, support for business owners, mental-health services, and so on. The group was ecstatic that Philadelphia was likely to elect its first woman mayor. “My organization is predominantly white females,” Vanessa Fields, the president of the Philadelphia chapter of the National Organization for Women, said. “These white girls overwhelmingly wanted us to endorse Cherelle!” Another gushed about Parker&#39;s fashion sense: “I know we&#39;re talking about all these policies, but when Black girls and Black women see you show up sharp in the hood, with your shoe game always on point, that means something to us.” A third, a stranger to Parker, said that she became a supporter while in the bathroom at her mother&#39;s house. Through the bathroom door, she could hear Parker booming a speech across the street— “Don&#39;t let anybody put shade on your shine!”—and she was hooked.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Amid the joyfulness, one concern kept coming up: gun violence. So far in 2023, more than a thousand people have been killed by guns in Philadelphia. Chantay Love, one of the founders and president of &lt;em >;EMIR&lt;/em>; Healing Center, a community counselling organization, shared her account of watching violence spike early in the pandemic. Love turned to every city and state official she knew, trying to find more funding for her counsellors; she didn&#39;t know Parker personally, but Parker was the only official who responded. A retired reporter with the Philadelphia &lt;em>;Tribune&lt;/em>;, a Black newspaper that has been operating continuously since 1884, spoke of how demoralizing it had been to advocate for gun safety since her son was murdered, fifteen years ago. “I have rallied in the streets, and I&#39;m tired,” she said. She was inspired by Parker&#39;s plans to use law enforcement, including a &lt;em >;SWAT&lt;/em>; team, to address the scourge. “I thank God for you, Cherelle Parker,” she said. “And may He continue to cover you with His blood.”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;huopxo&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;So far, some three hundred and thirty people have died in gun-related violence in Philadelphia this year. Laron (LJ) Williams, who was killed on his twelfth birthday, June 22nd, was one of the youngest. Two months after his death, Parker went quietly to a community-development office in Germantown, a neighborhood founded by William Penn in northwest Philadelphia. In a cramped, windowless office with Muhammad Ali posters on the wall, she met with Williams&#39;s mom, Michelle Brister, who sat at a tiny round table, wearing overalls and looking stunned. “I read that Laron was called the mayor,” Parker said to Brister—he was known as the “soul of the neighborhood,” gregarious and ubiquitous. “I&#39;m not the mayor yet, but I&#39;m here to learn about the challenges facing the city.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Parker didn&#39;t reach for Brister&#39;s hand or offer promises impossible to deliver. Instead, she chatted with Brister about how the neighborhood had changed since the days when Brister and Parker had come up spending their time after school at cheerleading practice. “I was a West Oak Lane Wildcat,” Parker said. She asked Brister what might keep kids safe. Would it help to have police walking a beat? Brister shook her head. They already had police in cars in Germantown. She thought that the most critical change would be to open rec centers, so that kids had somewhere to go after school, instead of tooling around on their bikes in the street and making trips to the corner store for snacks—which is what Laron was doing when he was shot. Brister had opened the door to find her son, who had been trying to reach the house, dying on the front steps. She&#39;d recently found the Ruffles he&#39;d had in his hand when he&#39;d died, and his bike was still in front of the house. “I put air in the tires in case anyone wanted to ride it,” Brister said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Outside, on Chew Avenue, Parker shooed her team away, to prevent them from photographing her talking to Brister. She hates social media—as well as any narrative that casts her as the answer to problems she is unlikely to solve. “I am no savior,” Parker told me. “I never promised the City of Philadelphia that I would ride in on a white horse.” ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 11 Nov 2023 05:06:01 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Hollywood Faces Its Post-Strike Future]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.newyorker.com/culture/notes-on-hollywood/hollywood-faces-its-post-strike-future]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-10T18:34:39.945Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654e6e2c8390e7624457553d/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Schulman-SAG-StrikeEnd.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;article >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attribute-verso-pattern=&quot;article-body&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;ArticlePageChunks&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;On Wednesday night, the actor Jeremy Allen White, of “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/annals-of-gastronomy/the-bear-is-a-gritty-fairy-tale-of-cooking-and-grief&quot;>;The Bear&lt;/a>;,” was working his way down a red carpet in Dallas. It was the première of “The White Claw,” an A24 movie about the Von Erich clan of professional wrestlers. On the carpet, an “Entertainment Tonight” reporter &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://twitter.com/PopCrave/status/1722535700518613216&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://twitter.com/PopCrave/status/1722535700518613216&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PopCrave/status/1722535700518613216&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;informed White&lt;/a>;, “We just heard moments ago—the strike is over!” and stuck the mike in his face. “That&#39;s amazing,” White said, seeming taken aback. Asked how he felt, he added, “I don&#39;t know the details of the deal, but I&#39;m sure that &lt;em >;SAG&lt;/em>; got what we wanted.” Since mid-July, when the actors&#39; strike began, the sight of celebrities such as White and his co-star Zac Efron traipsing red carpets has been rare; actors were barred from promoting projects connected to major studios and streamers. White and Efron were in Dallas only because “The White Claw” received an “interim agreement”—an exception given to indie projects abiding by the guild&#39;s proposed terms, and one of those bits of technical jargon that became Hollywood parlance over the tumultuous last few months.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The &lt;em >;SAG&lt;/em>;-&lt;em >;AFTRA&lt;/em>; strike lasted a hundred and eighteen days, and overlapped with the Writers Guild of America&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/notes-on-hollywood/why-are-tv-writers-so-miserable&quot;>;strike&lt;/a>;, which began in May and lasted a hundred and forty-eight days—the first time both guilds had been on the picket lines simultaneously since 1960. Back then, the central issue was residual payments for movies replayed on television, a relatively new phenomenon for a relatively new medium. This time, a technological change once again upended how entertainment is consumed and, subsequently, how actors are paid. Instead of the birth of television, it was the birth of streaming. Actors who were used to living off residual payments from network roles between gigs had found themselves receiving paltry checks for equivalent work on streaming shows. In July, on the cusp of the strike, I &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/notes-on-hollywood/orange-is-the-new-black-signalled-the-rot-inside-the-streaming-economy&quot;>;spoke&lt;/a>; to cast members from “Orange Is the New Black,” who said that they had never truly shared in the wealth the series generated for Netflix, even as the show helped build the foundation of the streaming economy. Although the final deal still has to go through approval formalities at the guild, and the fine print has not yet been released, &lt;em >;SAG&lt;/em>;&#39;s hard-won agreement includes performance-based bonuses for actors on streaming shows that become big hits. For the studios represented by the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, or AMPTP, the concept was a non-starter before the strike. Now it&#39;s Hollywood&#39;s new reality.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;But the issue that unexpectedly came to the fore, as it did for the writers, was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tag/artificial-intelligence-ai&quot;>;artificial intelligence&lt;/a>;. In August, as Hollywood was entering an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/notes-on-hollywood/scenes-from-hollywoods-hot-labor-summer&quot;>;end-of-summer malaise&lt;/a>;, I spoke to a professional background actor named Vincent Amaya, who appears in a lot of police procedurals. “I do not want to be scanned,” he said. “They can use my image and then always have me crossing in a cop station without paying me. That&#39;s my livelihood.” AI is still a vast unknown, but both guilds saw it as an existential threat. In &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theringer.com/2023/11/9/23953703/end-of-the-actors-sag-aftra-strike-with-duncan-crabtree-ireland&quot;>;an interview&lt;/a>; this week on the industry podcast “The Town,” Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, the guild&#39;s astoundingly named national executive director and chief negotiator, said that the final sticking point had been the use of “synthetic performers,” or what he termed “synthetic fakes”—essentially, nonexistent people remixed from real ones. (Perhaps you&#39;ve seen footage online of normal-seeming extras who, on closer look, have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/rabbit-holes/the-uncanny-failures-of-ai-generated-hands&quot;>;eight fingers on one hand&lt;/a>;.) &lt;em >;SAG&lt;/em>; wasn&#39;t fighting to stop the AI revolution but for its members to receive “informed consent” and compensation when their images are used. Once again, a new technology preceded a labor upheaval.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;On “The Town,” Crabtree-Ireland described the mood in the negotiating room as “cordial” but “serious,” with occasional flareups. In 1960, the actors&#39; strike was led by none other than Ronald Reagan, who went on to become one of the country&#39;s more &lt;em>;anti&lt;/em>;-union Presidents. This time, the guild president, working alongside Crabtree-Ireland, was Fran Drescher, whose idiosyncratic style, known to fans of “The Nanny,” will be inextricable from this chapter in Hollywood history. When the talks broke down during the summer, she gave an impassioned speech excoriating the industry&#39;s CEOs and accused the studios of giving the guild “a &lt;em>;leck&lt;/em>; and a &lt;em>;schmeck&lt;/em>;,” Yiddish for “a lick and a sniff.” When the two sides finally started meeting again, in the fall, reports spread of her unconventional tactics, such as bringing a heart-shaped plushie to the bargaining table. Perhaps this was Drescher&#39;s answer to Richard Nixon&#39;s “madman theory”: throw off the enemy with an ounce of &lt;em>;mishegoss&lt;/em>;. Earlier this week, the &lt;em>;Hollywood Reporter&lt;/em>; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/fran-drescher-sagaftra-strike-actors-negotiations-studios-offer-1235639971/&quot;>;asked&lt;/a>;, “Will she be remembered as an eccentric scene-stealer or a fiery labor iconoclast?” I&#39;d say both. Or, as the theme from “The Nanny” puts it, “Who would have guessed that the girl we described was just exactly what the doctor prescribed?”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Now, at long last, Hollywood can get up and running. Annette Bening can hit the Oscar campaign trail for “Nyad.” &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/11/13/ridley-scott-director-profile&quot;>;Ridley Scott&lt;/a>; can finish “Gladiator 2.” We&#39;ll finally find out what happens next season on “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/04/25/severance-is-sci-fi-for-the-soul&quot;>;Severance&lt;/a>;.” Stars can trade their picket signs for tuxes and gowns. And the countless crew members, costume designers, caterers, and agents who&#39;ve been sitting out the past several months—often at dire financial cost—can get back to work. The industry they&#39;re returning to may be more equitable than it was, but that doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;ll be smooth sailing. The streaming economy had already been facing a reckoning, with Wall Street demanding profitability, and studios are tightening their belts and contracting production. As Brooks Barnes &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/08/business/media/hollywood-strike-actors-writers.html&quot;>;writes&lt;/a>; in the &lt;em>;Times&lt;/em>;, “Most analysts say that there are too many streaming services and that the weakest will ultimately close or merge with bigger competitors.” No sooner did the strike end than the executive Jeffrey Katzenberg predicted that AI will reduce the workforce for animated films to less than ten per cent of what it is, and Warner Bros. shelved the completed film “Coyote vs. Acme” for a tax writeoff. Peak TV appears to have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/11/06/the-twilight-of-prestige-television&quot;>;peaked&lt;/a>;, and theatrical moviegoing is in crisis. What lies ahead is uncertain. But, as this historic year demonstrated, some crises are worth the trouble. ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;478m2u&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;hfv3hd&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 11 Nov 2023 03:06:01 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[The Escalating Violence Between Israel and Lebanon]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.newyorker.com/news/dispatch/the-escalating-violence-between-israel-and-lebanon]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-10T17:21:50.968Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654d16149114896db1303fb4/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Rania-Lebanon%20Dispatch.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;article >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attribute-verso-pattern=&quot;article-body&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;ArticlePageChunks&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;The piercing wail of ambulances, their red and blue lights flashing, announced the arrival of Samira Ayoub and her three granddaughters: fourteen-year-old Rimas, twelve-year-old Talin, and the youngest, Layan, just ten years old. They were home, in the southern Lebanese town of Blida, and what seemed like all its residents, along with parliamentarians and people from neighboring towns, were there to greet them near the main square. On one side of the street were women in black chadors and abayas, many carrying A4-sized portraits of the three girls. They tossed rice and pink and white bougainvillea petals on the ambulances. On the other side stood uniformed teen-agers and men from Hezbollah&#39;s Imam al-Mahdi scouts, a youth group affiliated with the Lebanese Scouting Federation.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Four coffins were removed from the ambulances and carried high through Blida&#39;s narrow streets toward the cemetery. The girls&#39; coffins were covered in white flags emblazoned with the scout emblem and topped with wreaths; their grandmother&#39;s was draped in black velvet embroidered with Islamic verses. A pickup truck mounted with speakers paved the way. As the procession passed an olive grove, a young man with a microphone led the chants: “Death to Israel! Death to America!”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The four were killed on Sunday night when an Israeli drone incinerated their family&#39;s car. The Israel Defense Forces later told the &lt;em>;Times of Israel&lt;/em>; that it had struck a “suspicious vehicle containing several terrorists.” There were no men inside. The girls&#39; mother, Hoda, survived and remains hospitalized. Their father, Mahmoud, works in Africa. (Lebanon&#39;s crippling financial crisis, which convulsed the country in 2019 and continues to reverberate, has pushed many Lebanese citizens to earn money abroad.) He came back to Blida for the funerals.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;At the cemetery, Mahmoud wept as he laid his head on each of his daughter&#39;s coffins. “My darling, my life, you are my life,” Mahmoud said, again and again. His own father stood near him. Over the loudspeaker, a man was talking about Gaza, about resistance to Israel, about defending the land, about double standards in international law, about victory, as Mahmoud quietly, inconsolably bade his daughters farewell. “These are my children,” he whispered to the men around him. “How are your children? Look at mine. My children are in heaven. Nobody will ask me again how they are.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Rania, a local English teacher whom I met at the funeral, told me, “We&#39;re not sure of anything after this. I think the response will be tough. The resistance must act.” She meant Hezbollah.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Samira and her granddaughters were killed on the same day that, elsewhere in southern Lebanon, an Israeli drone struck near two ambulances, wounding four paramedics. (The IDF has said that it was targeting a “terrorist squad.”) Israel&#39;s attacks on civilians and emergency vehicles represent a dangerous new escalation in the current conflict. And yet, for many Lebanese, it feels like déjà vu. Just days after the start, in 2006, of the July War—which Israelis call the Second Lebanon War—twenty-three civilians, many of them children, were killed in Israeli air strikes as they fled Marwahin, their small village near the border. Other, similar strikes followed. Ambulances were also targeted.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;The latest round of hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah began on October 8th, a day after &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/israels-calamity-and-after&quot;>;Hamas&#39;s devastating ambush&lt;/a>; in Israel. The UN-delineated border between Lebanon and Israel, known as the Blue Line, has been relatively quiet since the 2006 war, but it is now once again aflame in escalating, violent daily exchanges. At least ten Lebanese civilians, including a Reuters journalist, have been killed, as have two civilians in Israel.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;On November 3rd, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, Hezbollah&#39;s secretary-general, delivered a much anticipated speech, hailing what he considered the achievements of the Lebanese front: diverting Israeli military resources that might otherwise be put to use in the invasion of Gaza, displacing thousands of residents from northern Israel, and instilling fear of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/dispatch/the-simmering-lebanese-front-in-israels-war&quot;>;full-blown regional war&lt;/a>;, a scenario he described as a “realistic possibility.” He directly blamed the United States for supporting Israel&#39;s offensive in Gaza and warned that American interests would be targeted in any broader conflict. “Those who defeated you in Lebanon in the early eighties are still alive, and with them are their children and grandchildren, too,” he said.&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Neither the threat of American aircraft carriers—two strike groups have been moved to the Middle East in recent weeks—nor the pleas of Arab and Western diplomats would influence Hezbollah&#39;s calculus, according to Nasrallah. There would be only two determinants: Israel&#39;s actions in Gaza and in Lebanon. “With all sincerity, transparency, clarity, and constructive ambiguity,” he said, “all possibilities are open on our Lebanese front.” He warned that, if Israel targeted Lebanese civilians, Hezbollah would follow a new rule, “a civilian for a civilian.” This weekend, Nasrallah will speak again, to mark an event that commemorates Hezbollah fighters lost in battle.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Hours after the attack on Samira and her grandchildren, Hezbollah lobbed rockets into Kiryat Shmona, a town in northern Israel. (It had already been largely evacuated.) Rania, the English teacher, told me that some people in Blida expect this to be a turning point. She said they were leaving town so that Hezbollah&#39;s fighters could retaliate against Israel without feeling encumbered by the presence of civilians.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;wxc85h&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;3qj19e&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Fears of a widening war have already displaced more than twenty-five thousand people from Lebanon&#39;s border region, around ten thousand of whom have sought refuge in the southern city of Tyre. Last week, Mortada Mhanna, the director of Tyre&#39;s crisis-management administration, was seated at a long table in his office with several Red Cross volunteers and municipal workers. On the wall were two screens—one presented rolling news on Al Jazeera, and the other displayed the tally of displaced people. He didn&#39;t have much time to chat. “Five minutes, yes?” he told me. Most of the displaced were housed in previously empty apartments or with relatives, he said, and about eight hundred were dispersed among four schools that served as shelters. “I&#39;ve got six thousand mattresses for ten thousand people,” Mhanna said. “Every day, we have to fight for food and mattresses.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;He was already overstretched and underfunded—and afraid that further escalation on the border could propel a hundred thousand more people into Tyre alone. “It&#39;s harder than 2006 because aid is arriving like a drip,” he said. In the 2006 war, up to a million people were displaced, according to the United Nations. Today, Lebanon is in significantly worse condition, a bankrupt state paralyzed by voids in leadership. The country hasn&#39;t had a President for more than a year. The debilitating financial crisis has plunged around eighty per cent of the population into poverty. People struggle to feed themselves, let alone others. “International non-governmental organizations aren&#39;t dealing with the situation as if we are in a war,” Mhanna said. “I am sitting in Tyre, and I say that we are at war. There is a war along the border. It&#39;s a front line.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;History, before it is recorded and retold, is lived—and relived—by women such as Sara Faraj, who is twenty-five, and Nawal, her mother, who is sixty. They are from the southern border village of Ayta ash-Shab. Sara was a child during the 2006 war, displaced and living in a school in the adjacent village of Rmaych. For about a month, she&#39;s found herself back in a classroom, this time in Tyre, now with her own children, and several other relatives. The ground floor of the school houses a dozen other families from several border villages, while the first floor continues to host students and regular classes.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In the 2006 war, the mosques in her village publicly broadcast a message to flee. This time, Sara and her family didn&#39;t wait. “We are used to this now,” she said. “We immediately took the decision to leave.” They brought nothing. Her children are in donated clothes. Mhanna and his team were already working to stockpile heaters and blankets in anticipation of the displaced spending the winter in their school shelters. Sara&#39;s eldest, a six-year-old daughter, doesn&#39;t understand why she can&#39;t go home, and misses playing with her toys. “They are not doing great,” Sara told me. “They&#39;re bored here. I remember everything about the 2006 war, all of it, but mainly the fear, and I worry about what this war will do to my children.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Nawal puffed on a cigarette as she watched over her grandchildren. Her home was destroyed in the 2006 war; afterward, she bulldozed the remains and rebuilt it. There were older conflicts, too: the twenty-two-year Israeli occupation of a swath of southern Lebanon, including her village, which ended in 2000. Before that, in the sixties and seventies, she remembers “Palestinians who would launch rockets from our village, and the Israelis would strike the Palestinians,” she said. “It was terrifying. What lovely memories! What more could we want? Our problem is that we were born in this country next to Israel.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;In Tyre&#39;s Lebanese German University, which has also been transformed into a shelter, the families are from the village of Dhayra, about a hundred metres from the border. Residents say that shelling has damaged more than two dozen homes there. According to reports by Amnesty International, on October 16th Israel bombed the village with artillery shells containing white phosphorus, a violation of international humanitarian law. Many people fled after that attack. Fewer than a dozen are said to remain in the village.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Last week, the evening before Nasrallah&#39;s speech, Nader Abo Sari, one of those last holdouts, parked his red tractor-trailer outside the German University. He had no intention of staying; he was in town only to sell his tobacco harvest. His trailer was bulging with rectangular burlap packages stuffed with dried tobacco leaves. His wife had taken their four young children to stay with her parents, farther north, but Abo Sari refused to leave his village, where he felt obliged to care for his handful of cows, sheep, and chickens, and to feed stray cats and abandoned animals. “It&#39;s always very tense these days,” he said, standing at a distance from his tractor. “Instead of waking to the call to prayer, I wake to the sound of artillery hitting our area.” In 2006, Abo Sari said that he sought refuge in a mosque in the city of Sidon, about half an hour&#39;s drive from Beirut. This time, he wouldn&#39;t leave unless “the Israelis storm the village and kick me out.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;A few days later, I called Abo Sari to see how things were in Dhayra. He said that four or five families had recently returned to their homes. “People have had enough,” he said. “They&#39;re fed up with displacement. It&#39;s war, but not a war. And to say that it is peace, to feel better psychologically—it&#39;s not peace. It&#39;s not reassuring. If a person wants to return, there are no guarantees that things will calm down or get better. And, if you want to leave your home and live as a displaced person, it&#39;s humiliating.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;As for his situation, he said that he&#39;d “acclimatized,” joking that the missile strikes broke the monotony of village life. “It&#39;s action,” he said, laughing, before extending an invitation to lunch in Dhayra. “It&#39;ll be great,” he said. “The village is beautiful this time of year.” ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;05mcxb5&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot;

But there are many others: the Plattsburgh, the Cavendish, the Hanover. In 1999, two physicists published a book titled “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/85-Ways-Tie-Science-Aesthetics/dp/1841155683&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/85-Ways-Tie-Science-Aesthetics/dp/1841155683&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/85-Ways-Tie-Science-Aesthetics/dp/1841155683&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;The 85 Ways to Tie a Tie&lt;/a>;.” Their tally, however, was far from comprehensive. &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/boris_mocka/&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.instagram.com/boris_mocka/&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/boris_mocka/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;Mocka&lt;/a>; alone has created more than fifteen hundred knots. The Gardenia looks like a flower; the Wicker and the Mockatonic look like origami. The Riddler looks like a question mark, and the Exousia requires more than one tie. “I&#39;m very obsessed with being original,” Mocka told me.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Mocka is not a physicist, or a menswear designer, but a doorman in my apartment building. His path to sartorial invention is as winding as his silken creations. He was born in Martinique in 1969 and was raised in Paris. His father died when he was two, and his mother moved to New York without him. He was adopted by a man who painted in his free time, and who inspired Mocka to pick up drawing. By the time Mocka turned ten, people were telling him that his artistic skills were a gift from God. “We knew better, because it&#39;s called practice,” he said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;At eleven, Mocka joined his birth mother in New York, where she worked for the French consulate, and he eventually enrolled in the United Nations International School. His relationship with his mother was fraught, and he occasionally ran away and slept on the streets. (They no longer speak, and his mother could not be reached for comment.) Eventually, he befriended a family member of the sculptor &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/postscript/the-giant-art-of-claes-oldenburg&quot;>;Claes Oldenburg&lt;/a>;, who helped him get into a leading art school, the Cooper Union. Before Mocka matriculated, however, he was drafted into the French military and shipped to Martinique. He head-butted a drill sergeant, and spent time in a penal colony in French Guiana. With only a month left in his service, he wanted to be discharged; his assigned psychiatrist told him that pleading insanity was the only option, so he did.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Mocka told me that when he returned to New York, he was homeless and suicidal for a time. “I was going back and forth between friends&#39; houses until I would outwear my welcome,” he said. “I&#39;ve slept in trains, I&#39;ve slept in staircases.” To earn some money, but also to prove to himself that he could beat anyone, he fought in underground, bare-knuckle boxing matches, using a French form of kickboxing that he&#39;d learned in the military. (He says he never lost.) He taught fighting lessons in the East Village, delivered marijuana, and worked as a porter. Finally, he spent a decade at the 2nd Ave Deli, where he met his wife, and worked his way up from cleaner to manager, which allowed him to rent his own apartment.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Mocka invented his first tie knot in 2013, when he was forty-four. His wife was pregnant and he needed health insurance, so he got a union job as a doorman, at an apartment building where one of his friends worked. The night before his first day, he stayed up late learning to tie the Windsor knot, hoping to make a good impression.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;When Mocka showed up for work, his friend was getting ready to go home. “I was overly excited,” Mocka told me. “I kept being, like, &#39;Don&#39;t you see how cool this is? This is the perfect Windsor.&#39; ”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;His friend was unimpressed. “You know, you might want to look up the Eldredge knot,” the friend said. “If you go to YouTube, you&#39;ll find videos.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;The Eldredge knot has the upside-down-triangle shape of a traditional knot. The surface of the triangle, however, is split into five overlapping sheaths, which make the knot look almost like a braid. While learning to tie it, Mocka made mistakes. “But those mistakes I liked better than the knot itself,” he said. He started making videos to keep track of the moves.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Soon, Mocka found an online community devoted to tie knots. He discovered knots like the Merovingian, which was named for a character in the 2003 film “The Matrix Reloaded”; it&#39;s unusual because the tail is knotted in front of the blade, as though the tie is wearing a smaller tie. On YouTube, he started following tievangelists like Patrick Novotny, a Canadian realtor who wears uncommon tie knots to stand out while networking. Mocka ultimately created more than a thousand videos of his own. He established or articulated dozens of basic techniques: twisting, swirling, spiralling, tunnelling, snaking, flaring. He&#39;d sometimes wake up in the middle of the night with a new idea, and rouse his sleeping wife by crying, “I got it!”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In the small world of tie-tying, Mocka became a minor celebrity. One prolific knot designer, a South African court interpreter named Mabu Letsoalo, called him a genius and a major influence on him. Novotny, whose tie-themed YouTube videos have more than twenty million views, told me, “I think everybody in the tie community could probably look toward Boris for inventing the most knots.” This is a surprisingly difficult thing to adjudicate, however. Mocka said that he reached out to Guinness World Records, but the organization said that a record would be too hard to establish; all of its records must be measurable, breakable, standardizable, and verifiable. Ties raise questions. Is any knot in a tie a tie knot, or are there rules? Can you turn an old knot into a new knot simply by adding a twist or a loop? When you combine two knots, do they become one? These are not just aesthetic questions—they&#39;re math problems, too.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;GenericCallout&quot;>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;The Man Who Invented Fifteen Hundred Necktie Knots&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654cfe0a66d345614a18968a/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/34Hutson_La_France_Knot_edit.png&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654cfe0a66d345614a18968a/master/w_120,c_limit/34Hutson_La_France_Knot_edit.png 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654cfe0a66d345614a18968a/master/w_240,c_limit/34Hutson_La_France_Knot_edit.png 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654cfe0a66d345614a18968a/master/w_320,c_limit/34Hutson_La_France_Knot_edit.png 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654cfe0a66d345614a18968a/master/w_640,c_limit/34Hutson_La_France_Knot_edit.png 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654cfe0a66d345614a18968a/master/w_960,c_limit/34Hutson_La_France_Knot_edit.png 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654cfe0a66d345614a18968a/master/w_1280,c_limit/34Hutson_La_France_Knot_edit.png 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654cfe0a66d345614a18968a/master/w_1600,c_limit/34Hutson_La_France_Knot_edit.png 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/div>;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;align-center&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:align-center&quot;>;&lt;h2 >;The La France&lt;/h2>;&lt;/inline-embed>;&lt;p >;Knot theory falls within the mathematical field of topology, which explores fundamental properties of mathematical objects. Topologists treat shapes as though they are made out of rubber; they see cubes and spheres as the same, because one can morph into the other without any gluing or tearing. (Mathematicians sometimes joke that a topologist can&#39;t tell the difference between a doughnut and a coffee mug: each has one hole.) According to topologists, a knot is just a closed loop. The simplest nontrivial knot is the trefoil, which is the same as an overhand knot, but with the string&#39;s ends joined; on paper, it looks like someone drew a three-leaf clover.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;For most of their history, tie knots and knot theory developed in parallel. The cravat, a type of scarf, gained popularity in Europe in the sixteen-hundreds, and an 1828 book, “The Art of Tying the Cravat,” included thirty-two cravat-tying lessons. The modern necktie emerged in the eighteen-fifties, with little function beyond fashion. The original knot, the four-in-hand, is said to have taken its name from a way of driving a horse carriage. In the nineteen-thirties, the larger Windsor knot became popular; it was named for the Duke of Windsor—although he actually wore the four-in-hand, just with large ties.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The word “topology” comes from the German mathematician Johann Listing, who wrote about knots in an 1847 book. Knot theory took another step forward in 1867, when the physicist Lord Kelvin—inspired by smoke rings blown by his colleague Peter Guthrie Tait—theorized that atoms were knotted vortices in the ether. Tait soon enumerated all the knots that had up to seven crossings. (There were fifteen.) Although they were proved wrong about atoms, the mathematics of knots became a specialty of its own.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;wz7i1d&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Knots remain a knotty problem. Mathematicians long thought, for example, that there were a hundred and sixty-six knots with ten crossings, and they used tables depicting every one. Then, in 1974, a Harvard law student with an undergraduate math degree, Ken Perko, browsed one of these tables and noticed something funny: two of the knots were the same. (They are now known as the Perko pair.) Things get even more tangled—or maybe less—in higher dimensions. A knot in three dimensions comes undone in four; meanwhile, in four dimensions, you can knot spheres.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The art and science of tie knots finally started to converge in the nineties, when Thomas Fink and Yong Mao, physicists who were then working at Cambridge, learned about the invention of a tie knot by an American named Jerry Pratt. A clothier declared it “the first new knot for men in over 50 years.” Fink and Mao decided to do for tie knots what Tait had done for knots in general: catalogue them. “The discovery of a new tie knot, evidently, is a rare event,” they wrote in “The 85 Ways to Tie a Tie.” “Rather than wait another half-century for the next knot, we considered a more formal approach.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;GenericCallout&quot;>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;The Man Who Invented Fifteen Hundred Necktie Knots&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654cfe0b9114896db1303f87/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/34Hutson_Ganesha_Knot_edit.png&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654cfe0b9114896db1303f87/master/w_120,c_limit/34Hutson_Ganesha_Knot_edit.png 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654cfe0b9114896db1303f87/master/w_240,c_limit/34Hutson_Ganesha_Knot_edit.png 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654cfe0b9114896db1303f87/master/w_320,c_limit/34Hutson_Ganesha_Knot_edit.png 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654cfe0b9114896db1303f87/master/w_640,c_limit/34Hutson_Ganesha_Knot_edit.png 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654cfe0b9114896db1303f87/master/w_960,c_limit/34Hutson_Ganesha_Knot_edit.png 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654cfe0b9114896db1303f87/master/w_1280,c_limit/34Hutson_Ganesha_Knot_edit.png 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654cfe0b9114896db1303f87/master/w_1600,c_limit/34Hutson_Ganesha_Knot_edit.png 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/div>;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;align-center&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:align-center&quot;>;&lt;h2 >;The Ganesha&lt;/h2>;&lt;/inline-embed>;&lt;p >;To apply knot theory to neckties, first imagine that the ends of the tie are fused after the knot has been tied, creating a closed loop. Then consider that a tie, unlike a traditional knot, must wrap around a person&#39;s neck and drape against their chest. These two features—the neck and the drape—make tie knots a category of their own. According to standard topology, the four-in-hand and the Windsor are identical; they&#39;re just the trefoil. The half-Windsor and the Pratt, meanwhile, are both unknots—simple rings. But, in practice, the four necktie knots are different.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Fink and Mao imagined a tie draped over a person&#39;s shoulders, with the tail, or narrow end, on the left, and the blade, or wider end, on the right. They created a special notation for the ways one can move the blade, along with rules about sequence. They limited their tie knots to nine moves, ending with the blade coming up toward the chin and tucking down through a loop. Using their notation, what takes minutes to explain in a YouTube video can fit into a short string of characters. The four-in-hand, for instance, is L⊗R⊙L⊗C⊙T: left in, right out, left in, center out, through. They deemed thirteen of their knots to be aesthetically pleasing based on mathematical symmetry and balance. The four-in-hand, the Windsor, the half-Windsor, and the Pratt turned out to be among them; as far as they could tell, the other nine had never been described before.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Mikael Vejdemo-Johansson, a topologist now at the City University of New York, read Fink and Mao&#39;s papers in 2013. As a mathematician who wore bow ties in his late twenties, and eventually graduated to neckties with fancy knots, he was their ideal audience. He found their research dissatisfying, however. Fink and Mao looked at knots with only flat surfaces, which excluded more complex creations like the Eldredge and the Merovingian. “Fink and Mao basically just define everything interesting out of the way,” Vejdemo-Johansson told me.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Vejdemo-Johansson knew that there is an infinite number of things you can do with a tie. Since most are too boring or weird to count as a tie knot, you have to make rules—but the rules also can&#39;t be too strict. He decided to undertake his own study of ties with several collaborators. They decided that knots could have up to thirteen moves, could tuck through multiple loops, and did not need to end with the same sequence as Fink and Mao&#39;s knots. They also decided that the tail, not the blade, could take the lead, which is the only way to tie an intricate knot like the Eldredge.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Mathematicians and computer scientists often study formal languages, which have their own symbols and rules about sequence. Vejdemo-Johansson described his tie knots as a distinct language, complete with its own notation and grammar. He and his colleagues showed that their grammar was inherently more complex than Fink and Mao&#39;s, because some moves worked only in combination with other moves: you have to form loops before you can tuck a tie through them. But it wasn&#39;t too complex for computational tools to enumerate all of the “sentences,” or knots, in the language.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In 2015, the team published a paper called “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://peerj.com/articles/cs-2/&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://peerj.com/articles/cs-2/&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://peerj.com/articles/cs-2/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;More Ties than We Thought&lt;/a>;.” Their final tally was a staggering 266,682.

Because the researchers did not apply any aesthetic rules, however, many of their knots were ugly. Math had yet to conquer art.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;GenericCallout&quot;>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;The Man Who Invented Fifteen Hundred Necktie Knots&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654cfe0bea5de3639efc2697/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/34Hutson_Pectoral_Knot_edit.png&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654cfe0bea5de3639efc2697/master/w_120,c_limit/34Hutson_Pectoral_Knot_edit.png 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654cfe0bea5de3639efc2697/master/w_240,c_limit/34Hutson_Pectoral_Knot_edit.png 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654cfe0bea5de3639efc2697/master/w_320,c_limit/34Hutson_Pectoral_Knot_edit.png 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654cfe0bea5de3639efc2697/master/w_640,c_limit/34Hutson_Pectoral_Knot_edit.png 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654cfe0bea5de3639efc2697/master/w_960,c_limit/34Hutson_Pectoral_Knot_edit.png 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654cfe0bea5de3639efc2697/master/w_1280,c_limit/34Hutson_Pectoral_Knot_edit.png 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654cfe0bea5de3639efc2697/master/w_1600,c_limit/34Hutson_Pectoral_Knot_edit.png 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/div>;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;align-center&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:align-center&quot;>;&lt;h2 >;The Pectoral&lt;/h2>;&lt;/inline-embed>;&lt;p >;For a while, Mocka made his ties into a small business. For fifty dollars, you could mail him a tie, and he&#39;d tie a knot and mail it back. For two hundred dollars an hour, he&#39;d tie one on you. This February, Mocka self-published a five-hundred-page book, “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/HOW-TIE-KNOT-Boris-Mocka/dp/B0BNH11Q76&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/HOW-TIE-KNOT-Boris-Mocka/dp/B0BNH11Q76&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/HOW-TIE-KNOT-Boris-Mocka/dp/B0BNH11Q76&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;How to Tie &#39;The&#39; Knot&lt;/a>;,” which explains dozens of techniques and gives instructions for sixteen signature knots; he sells the hardcover for two hundred dollars. But Mocka&#39;s inventive period peaked around 2015. He needed to focus on supporting his family, and he was frustrated that tie fans were copying his work without proper credit. One designer, after hearing that Mocka wanted to set a world record for inventing the most knots, started competing with him, “making knots that make no sense,” Mocka told me. “They&#39;re kind of messing up the game.” In the end, he made nearly all of his YouTube videos private.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In June, I invited Mocka and Vejdemo-Johansson to my apartment so they could meet for the first time. The mathematician arrived first, wearing a blue utility kilt, a formal vest and shirt, and a Trinity tie knot, a modern classic whose façade is divided into three symmetrical panels. He had a ponytail and a graying goatee.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;At the time, Mocka was working as a porter in my building; because he was off duty, he arrived not in his usual work shirt, which was embroidered with the name “Boris,” but in a T-shirt and khakis. (Recently, he was promoted to doorman and began wearing fancy tie knots to work.) He had a shaved head, a graying beard, and no tie.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Sitting at my dining table, Vejdemo-Johansson flipped through Mocka&#39;s book. He seemed excited: “I can already see things that are definitely not covered by the notation.” Apparently, there were even more ties than “More Ties than We Thought” had thought.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“I&#39;m not a mathematician,” Mocka said. “I&#39;m actually here to find out if I&#39;m delusional.” He laughed, and then started to explain some of the techniques in his book.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Some of Mocka&#39;s moves, Vejdemo-Johansson said, added geometric complexity without making a knot topologically different. Others added extra crossings. Either way, Vejdemo-Johansson went on, math hadn&#39;t captured them yet. Mocka had effectively invented a new dialect, and its grammar was even more complex than the ones that professional mathematicians were using.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“You and I are operating in exactly opposite directions,” Vejdemo-Johansson told Mocka. “My goal is to pick a box and understand it. Your goal is to pick a box and transcend it.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Mocka said that he wished he could teach a computer to create interesting new designs with his techniques. But Vejdemo-Johansson didn&#39;t think a computer could pull it off. Computers are good at following rules; Mocka is good at breaking them. “You have a full &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/can-computers-learn-common-sense&quot;>;world model&lt;/a>;,” Vejdemo-Johansson said. “You have understanding you&#39;ve been honing for over fifty years, of how the world exists around you and how you interact with it.”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;ys2b39&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;He cited Mocka&#39;s Sparkling knot, which cradles a shiny object like a coin. An AI might not know the difference between originality and outlandishness; it might riff on the Sparkling knot by trying to insert the wheel of a car, or the tie-wearer&#39;s wrist. Even with human feedback nudging it toward elegant knots, an algorithm might struggle to find one. In the space of all possible knots, Vejdemo-Johansson said, “my intuition is that interesting ties are too sparse.” The most elegant knots may be one move away from being ugly, or simply coming undone.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“The book was going to be called &#39;A Million-Plus Ways to Tie Knots,&#39; ” Mocka said. “I didn&#39;t have the scientific backup to confirm that.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“It&#39;s easy,” Vejdemo-Johansson replied. His paper described a quarter-million knots; the option of adding even a few of Mocka&#39;s moves expands that number far beyond a million. “A one-line proof,” he said. The two men were now mathematical collaborators.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;GenericCallout&quot;>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;Illustration of tie with complicated knot&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65490e67caabb351fcd96b07/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/34Hutson_Orb_Knot.png&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65490e67caabb351fcd96b07/master/w_120,c_limit/34Hutson_Orb_Knot.png 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65490e67caabb351fcd96b07/master/w_240,c_limit/34Hutson_Orb_Knot.png 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65490e67caabb351fcd96b07/master/w_320,c_limit/34Hutson_Orb_Knot.png 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65490e67caabb351fcd96b07/master/w_640,c_limit/34Hutson_Orb_Knot.png 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65490e67caabb351fcd96b07/master/w_960,c_limit/34Hutson_Orb_Knot.png 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65490e67caabb351fcd96b07/master/w_1280,c_limit/34Hutson_Orb_Knot.png 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65490e67caabb351fcd96b07/master/w_1600,c_limit/34Hutson_Orb_Knot.png 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/div>;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;align-center&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:align-center&quot;>;&lt;h2 >;The Orb&lt;/h2>;&lt;/inline-embed>;&lt;p >;I asked a few other mathematicians what they thought of Mocka&#39;s knots. When Nicholas Scoville, a topologist at Ursinus College, in Pennsylvania, joined me on Zoom, he was wearing a tie that used one of Mocka&#39;s techniques: folds created three little cups, as though the knot were meant to catch crumbs. Scoville later looked at Mocka&#39;s book and considered what would happen if Mocka&#39;s various folding moves were combined with Vejdemo-Johansson&#39;s grammar. “I can&#39;t imagine the number of new tie knots this would generate,” he said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Elizabeth Denne, a mathematician at Washington and Lee University, told me that she likes knots because ordinary people can relate to them. “It&#39;s easy to tell you what I&#39;m doing,” she told me. “But the math that you need can be really full-on.” It&#39;s possible to study knots using geometry, algebra, combinatorics, and analysis. When Denne and two students published a &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://msp.org/involve/2021/14-2/p04.xhtml&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://msp.org/involve/2021/14-2/p04.xhtml&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://msp.org/involve/2021/14-2/p04.xhtml&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;paper&lt;/a>; about Fink and Mao&#39;s eighty-five knots, in 2021, they proved several things about them—for example, that they&#39;re prime knots. (This means that if you slice them in two, you&#39;ll be left with one trivial knot and one nontrivial knot.)&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;During a video call, Denne picked a knot from Mocka&#39;s book. “Boris&#39;s work is, like, a whole other kettle of fish,” she told me. “I don&#39;t think this one&#39;s prime, because he&#39;s got, like, &lt;em>;junk&lt;/em>; going on.” She pointed to one part of the knot in particular. “He&#39;s doing half hitches over here. And then he&#39;s threading that through. This thing that he&#39;s done on the side—that&#39;s a separate knot, right there. So this is not a prime tie knot.” At least, she didn&#39;t think so.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Many more math techniques would be needed to describe Mocka&#39;s art. Knot theory often treats strings as one-dimensional—but ties have width, too, making them more like ribbons than threads. For this reason, a twist in a tie could have mathematical significance, just as it does for a famous topological object called a Möbius strip. Denne specializes in physical knot theory, which considers the real-life width or volume of things like ribbons or ropes—but doing so “is really, really hard,” she told me. “It&#39;s almost like your everyday knots are too hard.” No one has managed to add friction to the equation. The Merovingian will have to await further study.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I wondered whether the mathematics of tie knots could be applied anywhere else—to other areas of science, or to the real world. “I don&#39;t know what the application is beyond tie knots,” Denne said. “But, then, nobody thought about origami being useful.” She cited &lt;em >;NASA&lt;/em>; technologies that were inspired by folded paper, such as a star shade that unfolds in space. Contemporary physicists apply knot theory to quantum mechanics and the winding paths that particles take through space-time. Knots have been observed in turbulent fluids and electromagnetic fields. Chemists have imagined molecules tied into knots to produce specific properties. And biophysicists sometimes talk about the topology of DNA, the double strands of which can behave a bit like knotted ribbons. Enzymes called topoisomerases help untangle them.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In another sense, though, mathematics has something in common with neckties: it&#39;s just something we like to do, whether it&#39;s functional or not. Sometimes humans pursue things for the simple reason that they&#39;re complicated, or counterintuitive, or beautiful. The study of tie knots can be as whimsical and elaborate as the knots themselves, and that may be enough. “I&#39;m interested in it because I&#39;m interested in fun and weird things,” Vejdemo-Johansson told me.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;GenericCallout&quot;>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;The Man Who Invented Fifteen Hundred Necktie Knots&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654cfe099114896db1303f85/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/34Hutson_Desiderata_Knot_edit.png&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654cfe099114896db1303f85/master/w_120,c_limit/34Hutson_Desiderata_Knot_edit.png 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654cfe099114896db1303f85/master/w_240,c_limit/34Hutson_Desiderata_Knot_edit.png 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654cfe099114896db1303f85/master/w_320,c_limit/34Hutson_Desiderata_Knot_edit.png 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654cfe099114896db1303f85/master/w_640,c_limit/34Hutson_Desiderata_Knot_edit.png 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654cfe099114896db1303f85/master/w_960,c_limit/34Hutson_Desiderata_Knot_edit.png 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654cfe099114896db1303f85/master/w_1280,c_limit/34Hutson_Desiderata_Knot_edit.png 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654cfe099114896db1303f85/master/w_1600,c_limit/34Hutson_Desiderata_Knot_edit.png 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/div>;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;align-center&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:align-center&quot;>;&lt;h2 >;The Desiderata&lt;/h2>;&lt;/inline-embed>;&lt;p >;Two months ago, I decided to teach myself the Trinity knot. I opened my closet and picked a striped tie, which I hoped would accentuate the knot&#39;s unique design. Then I stood in front of a mirror, my laptop a few steps away, and started to imitate an online tutorial. On my first few attempts, I fumbled. I wasn&#39;t even sure that I had succeeded until I tugged and tidied the knot.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;A couple of times, I tried inventing a knot. There was a lot of fiddling and fudging; it&#39;s difficult to say where one move ends and another begins. In this sense, ties seem more like Play-Doh than Legos. Yet a bit of tightening or loosening can suddenly resolve a messy arrangement into symmetry. The process reminded me of the way that mathematicians talk about their research. Sometimes, you start with a destination and need to figure out the way there; other times, you start with a mere notion, and you wind up somewhere unexpected. You lose the path, backtrack, and find it again. When you make your final move, you hold something new in your hands: a nice, tight proof.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In October, I wore the Trinity to a gala honoring women in science, conservation, and exploration. I was surprised when no one mentioned it the entire evening, even when I told two people at my table that I was writing an article about tie knots. But when I walked into my apartment building, around eleven that evening, I found Mocka sitting behind the security desk. He grinned. “Look who&#39;s wearing the Trinity!” he said.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;2vgw26&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;I told Mocka about the lack of fanfare surrounding my tie. “There&#39;s a subtlety to the Trinity,” he said. Sometimes tie knots inspire subconscious reactions. Sometimes they make you feel confident for the sole reason that you know you&#39;re wearing one.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;My Trinity was especially subtle given my black-and-blue-striped tie, he pointed out; I should have worn a solid color, or more contrasting stripes. “Tricks of the trade,” he said. Then he leaned over and gently loosened the loops of my tie. This way, “it pops out,” he said. I looked in a mirror, and it did. I pointed out that tieknotology was not just topology, but also psychology. “Distinction is one of those things that&#39;s very interesting,” Mocka said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Another resident, a young woman, walked in, and Mocka retrieved a package for her. I told her that he had designed over a thousand tie knots. Over a million, he interjected.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;“What&#39;s your favorite one, though?” she asked him.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The Jawbreaker, he said, and dropped his jaw to illustrate what tends to happen when people encounter it.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“OK, I have to see it,” the woman said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Mocka pulled up a picture on his laptop. There was a lot going on, but, at the top of the knot, the tie blade, facing backward, poked upward through the fabric loop that normally holds the tail in place.

Inevitably, tensions arise in the marriage, the shoot, and the community. The show is part satire, part psychological horror, exposing the queasy artifice of reality TV and the limits of white-liberal largesse. Though the Siegels insist that their project will only benefit residents, their stated values are swiftly eclipsed by an apolitical network, an amoral producer, and their own anxieties about how they&#39;re perceived. Minutes into the pilot, someone is blowing menthol into the eyes of a cancer patient to simulate tears of gratitude.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;GenericCallout&quot;>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;A scene from The Curse showing three people out of a window and a woman seating on the sofa&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654baac459e9c10268295a98/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/TheCurse_S1_0053_RT.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654baac459e9c10268295a98/master/w_120,c_limit/TheCurse_S1_0053_RT.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654baac459e9c10268295a98/master/w_240,c_limit/TheCurse_S1_0053_RT.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654baac459e9c10268295a98/master/w_320,c_limit/TheCurse_S1_0053_RT.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654baac459e9c10268295a98/master/w_640,c_limit/TheCurse_S1_0053_RT.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654baac459e9c10268295a98/master/w_960,c_limit/TheCurse_S1_0053_RT.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654baac459e9c10268295a98/master/w_1280,c_limit/TheCurse_S1_0053_RT.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654baac459e9c10268295a98/master/w_1600,c_limit/TheCurse_S1_0053_RT.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;p>;“The Curse.”&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Photograph by John Paul Lopez / Courtesy A24 / Paramount+ with Showtime&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;A troubled romance—and production process—is also at the heart of David Adjmi&#39;s remarkable new play &lt;strong>;“Stereophonic,”&lt;/strong>; at Playwrights Horizons. Set in nineteen-seventies California, the story charts the collapse of a band amid the creation of an album. Diana (Sarah Pidgeon) is a stealthily ambitious singer on the cusp of a solo career; her long-term boyfriend and the lead guitarist, Peter (Tom Pecinka), has incessant, often brutal notes for her and just about everyone else. “Stereophonic,” like “The Curse,” hinges on self-serving, mercurial characters. But where the Siegels&#39; work is objectionable from the outset, Adjmi believes in the art that results from all this pain. The music, he suggests, is worth the late nights, the obsessive retakes, the relationships foundering along the way. After the cynicism of “The Curse,” whose protagonists are bent on obscuring their true natures, it was moving to watch the bandmates strive for something real.&lt;/p>;&lt;hr />;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;align-center&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:align-center&quot;>;&lt;h2 >;Spotlight&lt;/h2>;&lt;/inline-embed>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;GenericCallout&quot;>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;The Splendid Notebooks of Picasso&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654ac14b06d899e375d104cb/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/231120_r43372.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654ac14b06d899e375d104cb/master/w_120,c_limit/231120_r43372.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654ac14b06d899e375d104cb/master/w_240,c_limit/231120_r43372.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654ac14b06d899e375d104cb/master/w_320,c_limit/231120_r43372.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654ac14b06d899e375d104cb/master/w_640,c_limit/231120_r43372.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654ac14b06d899e375d104cb/master/w_960,c_limit/231120_r43372.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654ac14b06d899e375d104cb/master/w_1280,c_limit/231120_r43372.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654ac14b06d899e375d104cb/master/w_1600,c_limit/231120_r43372.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;Art work courtesy Fundación Almine y Bernard Ruiz-Picasso; Photograph by Hugard &amp;amp; Vanoverschelde&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;heading&quot; aria-level=&quot;6&quot; >;Art&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;The fiftieth anniversary of Pablo Picasso&#39;s death has inspired plenty of exhibitions that go big or go deep. The Pace gallery&#39;s splendid contribution to the festivities, &lt;strong>;“Picasso: 14 Sketchbooks,”&lt;/strong>; goes long, studying the evolution of the Master&#39;s hand between 1900 and 1959. It&#39;s a one-stop shop for motifs that even non-aficionados can rattle off (musical instruments, mistresses, jagged nudes, evil-eyed bulls) and, of course, for some of the best drawing of the last century. In the magnificent “Head of a Woman” (pictured), completed in 1924, wiggly, wayward India-ink lines coalesce into something hard and inevitable—if the rival cults of Picasso worship and Picasso hatred bore you, seek out images like this one and bask.—&lt;em>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/contributors/jackson-arn&quot;>;Jackson Arn&lt;/a>; (Pace; through Dec. 22.)&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>;&lt;hr />;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;GenericCallout&quot;>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;An illustration of the New York City skyline.&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64ad7fea3f0ea61101b7b5aa/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/header-2023.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64ad7fea3f0ea61101b7b5aa/master/w_120,c_limit/header-2023.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64ad7fea3f0ea61101b7b5aa/master/w_240,c_limit/header-2023.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64ad7fea3f0ea61101b7b5aa/master/w_320,c_limit/header-2023.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64ad7fea3f0ea61101b7b5aa/master/w_640,c_limit/header-2023.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64ad7fea3f0ea61101b7b5aa/master/w_960,c_limit/header-2023.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64ad7fea3f0ea61101b7b5aa/master/w_1280,c_limit/header-2023.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64ad7fea3f0ea61101b7b5aa/master/w_1600,c_limit/header-2023.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/div>;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;align-center&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:align-center&quot;>;&lt;h2 >;About Town&lt;/h2>;&lt;/inline-embed>;&lt;div role=&quot;heading&quot; aria-level=&quot;6&quot; >;Opera&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Daniel Catán&#39;s &lt;strong>;“Florencia en el Amazonas,”&lt;/strong>; an opera of surpassing loveliness, unblushingly embraces a post-Romantic musical language of atmospheric woodwinds, throbbing strings, and shimmery high notes. Some might call it retrograde for a work from 1996, but its indebtedness to Puccini suits a story about a wistful prima donna in the early nineteen-hundreds. As the characters make their way to an opera house in Brazil on a riverboat traversing the Amazon, a heady mix of instrumental timbres articulates their desires. For the Met première, Ailyn Pérez, a soprano with an especially warm voice, stars as the titular diva, in a production directed by Mary Zimmerman and conducted by Yannick Nézet-Séguin.—&lt;em>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/contributors/oussama-zahr&quot;>;Oussama Zahr&lt;/a>; (Metropolitan Opera House; select dates Nov. 16-Dec. 14.)&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>;&lt;hr />;&lt;div role=&quot;heading&quot; aria-level=&quot;6&quot; >;Folk&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;ij5mg&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;When &lt;strong>;Bob Dylan&lt;/strong>; gave his Nobel lecture, after being awarded the 2016 prize for literature, he implored people to take in his lyrics as they were intended: by listening, on record or in concert, not by reading. He quoted Homer, and he pointed to his songs as vehicles for storytelling. “I&#39;ve searched the world over for the Holy Grail / I sing songs of love—I sing songs of betrayal,” he croaks on “False Prophet,” a single he performs on his “Rough and Rowdy Ways” tour, which comes to New York City this month. His album of the same name, from 2020, is full of glorious Americana, with scenes—from Key West to the Rubicon, the grassy knoll to the city of God—etched by his seasoned delivery. As he puts it, he sings songs of experience, which bear in them not only stories from his travels but the hallowed history of every time he&#39;s performed.—&lt;em>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/contributors/sheldon-pearce&quot;>;Sheldon Pearce&lt;/a>; (Kings Theatre, Nov. 14-15; Beacon Theatre, Nov. 16.)&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>;&lt;hr />;&lt;div role=&quot;heading&quot; aria-level=&quot;6&quot; >;Dance&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;GenericCallout&quot;>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;A woman dancing in a production shot of Jungle Book reimagined&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654ba67deba4644f6b509115/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/JungleBook_ProductionShots_8972_resized.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654ba67deba4644f6b509115/master/w_120,c_limit/JungleBook_ProductionShots_8972_resized.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654ba67deba4644f6b509115/master/w_240,c_limit/JungleBook_ProductionShots_8972_resized.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654ba67deba4644f6b509115/master/w_320,c_limit/JungleBook_ProductionShots_8972_resized.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654ba67deba4644f6b509115/master/w_640,c_limit/JungleBook_ProductionShots_8972_resized.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654ba67deba4644f6b509115/master/w_960,c_limit/JungleBook_ProductionShots_8972_resized.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654ba67deba4644f6b509115/master/w_1280,c_limit/JungleBook_ProductionShots_8972_resized.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654ba67deba4644f6b509115/master/w_1600,c_limit/JungleBook_ProductionShots_8972_resized.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;Photograph by Camila Greenwell&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;In Rudyard Kipling&#39;s “The Jungle Book,” a young boy raised by a family of wolves must choose between life in the animal kingdom and a return to the human world. The British dancer-choreographer Akram Khan posits a different question in his &lt;strong>;“Jungle Book reimagined”:&lt;/strong>; Is there even a place for humans on a planet they have damaged to the point of near-collapse? Through a mix of audio, animation, and dance, Khan has created a fable about the moral and physical costs of environmental destruction. The protagonist, Mowgli, a girl who has lost her parents to rising seas, is both protected and challenged by the animals who save her, whose thoughts are heard in voice-over.—&lt;em>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/contributors/marina-harss&quot;>;Marina Harss&lt;/a>; (Rose Theatre; Nov. 16-18.)&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>;&lt;hr />;&lt;div role=&quot;heading&quot; aria-level=&quot;6&quot; >;Art&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;In recent years, the Brooklyn Museum has organized shows around non-fine-artist superstars of varying quality and relevance. &lt;strong>;“Spike Lee: Creative Sources”&lt;/strong>; comprises some four hundred and fifty objects from the director&#39;s collection, including the original draft of the screenplay for his first masterpiece, “Do the Right Thing”; a Richard Avedon photograph of Malcolm X; a letter from Barack Obama; and one of Prince&#39;s guitars. Indulgent? Sure, but a messy, risky too-muchness has always been one of Lee&#39;s strengths, and it seems appropriate here—you come away overloaded but still eager to rewatch the films.

Gracie and her husband, Joe (Charles Melton), are pariahs in their home town of Savannah. Their relationship began when he was just out of seventh grade and she was in her thirties; she was imprisoned, and after her release they married. Now, twenty years later, they have three nearly grown children, and they&#39;re desperate for empathetic understanding. Enter Elizabeth, who insinuates herself into the family, gains information—and possibly disinformation—about the couple&#39;s troubled life, and exhibits artistic intentions as dubious as her ethical judgment. Haynes deftly sketches a tangle of manipulations and power plays and, along the way, offers a useful reminder: when Hollywood comes for your life story, run.—&lt;em>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/contributors/richard-brody&quot;>;Richard Brody&lt;/a>; (Opening Nov. 17 in theatres and streaming on Netflix starting Dec. 1.)&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>;&lt;hr />;&lt;div role=&quot;heading&quot; aria-level=&quot;6&quot; >;Off Broadway&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Jerome Weidman and the composer Harold Rome&#39;s garment-district musical, from 1962—thoughtfully reshaped by Weidman&#39;s librettist son, John, and directed by Trip Cullman—feels like being walloped by a roll of velvet. I mean that admiringly: when slippery Harry Bogen (Santino Fontana) takes advantage of his doting mama (Judy Kuhn), his adoring sweetheart (Rebecca Naomi Jones), and his trusting business partner (Adam Chanler-Berat) to get ahead, it &lt;em>;should&lt;/em>; feel like a slug in the gut. &lt;strong>;“I Can Get It For You Wholesale”&lt;/strong>; is not just a rogue&#39;s tale; it&#39;s also a labor-movement cri de coeur. Julia Lester, playing Harry&#39;s secretary, belts “Miss Marmelstein,” the song that first made Barbra Streisand famous, but it&#39;s Lester&#39;s glass-shattering “What Are They Doing to Us Now?” that will stamp the price of unregulated, unrepentant capitalism right onto your quaking spirit.—&lt;em>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/contributors/helen-shaw&quot;>;Helen Shaw&lt;/a>; (Classic Stage Company; through Dec. 17.)&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>;&lt;hr />;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;GenericCallout&quot;>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;The Splendid Notebooks of Picasso&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6548f6e90f9c64038d930fb8/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/GO_PickThree.png&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6548f6e90f9c64038d930fb8/master/w_120,c_limit/GO_PickThree.png 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6548f6e90f9c64038d930fb8/master/w_240,c_limit/GO_PickThree.png 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6548f6e90f9c64038d930fb8/master/w_320,c_limit/GO_PickThree.png 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6548f6e90f9c64038d930fb8/master/w_640,c_limit/GO_PickThree.png 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6548f6e90f9c64038d930fb8/master/w_960,c_limit/GO_PickThree.png 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6548f6e90f9c64038d930fb8/master/w_1280,c_limit/GO_PickThree.png 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6548f6e90f9c64038d930fb8/master/w_1600,c_limit/GO_PickThree.png 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/div>;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;align-center&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:align-center&quot;>;&lt;h2 >;Pick Three&lt;/h2>;&lt;/inline-embed>;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;align-center&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:align-center&quot;>;&lt;p >;&lt;em>;The staff writer &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/contributors/vinson-cunningham&quot;>;Vinson Cunningham&lt;/a>; shares current obsessions.&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>;&lt;/inline-embed>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;1.&lt;/strong>; &lt;strong>;Best cinematic interior design:&lt;/strong>; The more I think about Sofia Coppola&#39;s new film, &lt;strong>;“Priscilla,”&lt;/strong>; about the gilded cage inhabited by Priscilla Presley in her world-famous marriage to Elvis, the more I am enthralled and—reluctantly—seduced by its attention to sumptuous surfaces.

(See: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tag/capitol-riot&quot;>;January 6th&lt;/a>;.) But sometimes it&#39;s the smaller encroachments on decency that serve as a reminder of how far outside the bounds he operates. “Can you control your client?” Judge Arthur Engoron demanded of Trump&#39;s lawyer, during the former President&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/donald-trumps-contentious-day-on-the-witness-stand&quot;>;testimony on Monday&lt;/a>; in Manhattan, where he stands &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/with-trump-absent-his-new-york-civil-trial-gets-down-to-business&quot;>;accused&lt;/a>; of running a fraudulent business in the state of New York. “This is not a political rally. This is a courtroom.” Later, after yet another Trump soliloquy in response to a yes-or-no question, Engoron repeated his entreaty. “I beseech you,” the judge said, “to control him if you can.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Of course, seven years and five months into Trump&#39;s political career, we know by now that there is no controlling Trump. And yet, exactly a year before Election Day, that rogue defendant in the dock is not only the presumptive Republican nominee but &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://abcnews.go.com/538/2024-election-stand-year/story?id=104619961&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://abcnews.go.com/538/2024-election-stand-year/story?id=104619961&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://abcnews.go.com/538/2024-election-stand-year/story?id=104619961&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;running in a dead heat&lt;/a>; with Joe Biden nationally and, if the shock poll that came out &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/05/us/politics/biden-trump-2024-poll.html&quot;>;in the &lt;em>;Times&lt;/em>;&lt;/a>; a day before Trump&#39;s testimony is to be believed, ahead of him in five of six must-win battleground states. Trump&#39;s lawyer Christopher Kise even bragged about this in Engoron&#39;s courtroom, citing the poll as he referred to his client as “the future President of the United States.” The poll&#39;s release quickly sent Democratic Washington into a vaporous state of preëmptive blame-gaming about the status of the race: &lt;em>;It&#39;s Biden&#39;s age&lt;/em>;. &lt;em>;It&#39;s his campaign&lt;/em>;. &lt;em>;It&#39;s the media&#39;s fault&lt;/em>;. &lt;em>;It&#39;s all of the above.&lt;/em>; One anonymous sniper told NBC News that the campaign needed a “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/joe-biden/democratic-frustrations-biden-spill-open-five-alarm-fire-rcna123841&quot;>;defibrillator&lt;/a>;.” The former Obama adviser David Axelrod even kinda, sorta, maybe &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2023/11/07/david-axelrod-joe-biden-2024-campaign-comments-00125784&quot;>;suggested&lt;/a>; that Biden should consider stepping aside as the Party&#39;s 2024 standard-bearer. The White House sought to downplay the fuss as the inevitable outcry from the Party&#39;s large class of professional “bed wetters.” Perhaps, one Democratic strategist insisted, albeit anonymously, to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/11/06/biden-democrats-polls-politics/&quot;>;the Washington &lt;em>;Post&lt;/em>;&lt;/a>;, some bed-wetting was in order: “We should be terrified about what might happen.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The panicky news cycle was interrupted when Tuesday&#39;s off-year election results came in: a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-lessons-of-ohios-abortion-rights-victory&quot;>;big win&lt;/a>; for abortion rights in the increasingly red state of Ohio; a victory for the incumbent Democratic governor, Andy Beshear, in the solidly red state of Kentucky; a Democratic state House pickup in Virginia that looked to spoil the national aspirations of its Republican governor, Glenn Youngkin. Inevitably, team Biden claimed vindication. “Across the country tonight, democracy won and MAGA lost,” the President posted on social media. “Voters vote. Polls don&#39;t.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Days later, though, I&#39;m still struggling to understand the chill-out, everything&#39;s-going-according-to-the-plan spin. I know that the spinners have a job to do and that some amount of self-soothing is required in these stressful times. But still, whichever individual poll you choose to believe or not, the data point overwhelmingly to Biden sitting at near-historic lows in popularity and being essentially tied with Trump, a man who is running on an explicit platform of revenge, retribution, and Constitution-termination. As for the predictive power of off-year elections, it&#39;s best to remember that the big victory in Virginia amounted to Democrats narrowly holding onto the state Senate—they actually lost a seat—and gaining the state House with a net pickup of three seats, in a state that Biden won against Trump in 2020 by more than ten points. If Democrats had received nineteen hundred fewer votes in a single Virginia Senate district and eight hundred fewer in a single Virginia House district, they wouldn&#39;t have won full control of either chamber. That&#39;s hardly the reassurance that the Party craves looking ahead to 2024.&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Besides, Biden is up against not just electoral math but human psychology. There were plenty of reasonable theories of how and why Trump&#39;s appeal would fade once he left the White House and the full folly of his unprecedented effort to block the 2020 election results was revealed. But those theories have not panned out. Instead, Trump has, after four criminal indictments and multiple civil proceedings, such as the trial in New York, opened up such a wide lead against his GOP opponents that watching &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/nikki-haley-takes-on-the-scum-at-the-third-republican-debate&quot;>;Wednesday night&#39;s debate&lt;/a>; among the also-rans seemed like an incredible waste of time for any but the most masochistic of Republican viewers. I watched; it was eminently skippable. The short version is that Nikki Haley, the former governor of South Carolina who served as Trump&#39;s Ambassador to the United Nations, continued to embarrass her rivals with sharp retorts, offering voters an almost anachronistic attachment to the hawkish foreign policy of the pre-Trump GOP and a reluctance to fully disavow the ex-President she is ostensibly running against. It said everything about this Republican field that, when invited to condemn Trump in the debate&#39;s opening question, four of the five candidates onstage offered varying critiques of his electability and conservative record without getting to the heart of the matter. Ron DeSantis complained about Trump not building his wall. Tim Scott lamented his lack of appeal to independents. Haley said Trump wasn&#39;t the right President for our political moment. And then there was Vivek Ramaswamy, who demanded that the moderator apologize for even asking such a question.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;More revealing—and far more relevant, given where the race stands—was Trump&#39;s own rally that evening, in Hialeah, Florida, which took place as his latest act of counterprogramming during the Republican debate. While talking for well more than an hour, he fulminated about 2024 in nearly apocalyptic terms (“our final battle”) and added a gruesome note that I hadn&#39;t heard before about the “liars and leeches” who have been “sucking the life and blood” out of the country. He portrayed himself—and his followers—as victims of a “police state.” (Consistency is never a hallmark of Trump&#39;s attacks; he also called Biden&#39;s government a feckless “banana republic.”) And he offered plenty of additional fodder to those who think that he, not Biden, has aged out of the Presidency, like when he praised Kim Jong Un, North Korea&#39;s dictatorial leader, and mixed up the population size of North Korea with that of China.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;3f0xfe&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;grdn6&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;On Thursday, in an &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.semafor.com/article/11/09/2023/exclusive-trump-defends-family-separation-warns-weaponized-government-could-target-his-opponents-in-univision-sitdown&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.semafor.com/article/11/09/2023/exclusive-trump-defends-family-separation-warns-weaponized-government-could-target-his-opponents-in-univision-sitdown&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.semafor.com/article/11/09/2023/exclusive-trump-defends-family-separation-warns-weaponized-government-could-target-his-opponents-in-univision-sitdown&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;interview with Univision&lt;/a>;, Trump again made explicit what is often implicit in his vengeance-fuelled campaign: his willingness to use the justice system to go after his opponents if he is returned to the White House. Any other prospective President would have denied with all possible force a recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/11/05/trump-revenge-second-term/&quot;>;Washington &lt;em>;Post&lt;/em>; report&lt;/a>; that Trump has already demanded that his aides make plans to target some former advisers who have become public critics, including his former chief of staff John Kelly, former Attorney General Bill Barr, and former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley. Instead, Trump all but confirmed the story when he told the Spanish-language network that he would use the courts against his political rivals. “If I happen to be President and I see somebody who&#39;s doing well and beating me very badly, I say, &#39;Go down and indict them,&#39; ” Trump told Univision. “They&#39;d be out of business. They&#39;d be out of the election.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;There should be no surprise in this, of course. When Trump ran in 2016, he promised to jail his opponent, Hillary Clinton, and laughed and cheered and egged on his crowds when they chanted, “Lock her up! Lock her up!”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In an appearance this week on “The View,” Clinton compared Trump to Adolf Hitler, who was, she noted, “duly elected” before he dismantled Germany&#39;s democracy and turned himself into a dictator. Her main point—and it bears endless repetition between now and whatever awaits us next November—is that Trump has clearly spelled out exactly how he plans to go after core tenets of American democracy. There is no mystery here. “Trump is telling us what he intends to do,” Clinton said. “Take him at his word.

One afternoon, at Silk Road Textiles, in Cincinnati, among shelves of needlework books, two silver-haired volunteers sat at a table displaying stickers that said “OHI-Roe” and “Restore Roe,” mottos designed to indicate that the proposed amendment would be anything but radical. As one of the organizers walked in, a volunteer called out, “We&#39;ve had a really good day!” A few dozen signatures in the book, several hundred thousand to go. The immediate goal was to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/2019/04/11/712455980/a-bill-banning-most-abortions-becomes-law-in-ohio&quot;>;neutralize a law&lt;/a>;, passed and signed by Ohio Republicans—now blocked while under review by the Republican-controlled state Supreme Court—prohibiting almost all abortions after about six weeks, with no exceptions for rape or incest.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;On Tuesday, what started as a grassroots initiative with an uncertain outcome turned into the biggest victory for abortion rights since &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/when-the-supreme-court-takes-away-a-long-held-constitutional-right&quot;>;the Supreme Court&#39;s Dobbs decision&lt;/a>;, in June, 2022, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/07/04/we-are-not-going-back-to-the-time-before-roe-we-are-going-somewhere-worse&quot;>;overturned&lt;/a>; the rights guaranteed by Roe v. Wade. In a state that has long been dominated by Republicans, more than two million people endorsed a constitutional amendment asserting that “every individual has a right to make and carry out one&#39;s own reproductive decisions.” The amendment, which, like Roe, allows the state to restrict abortion only after fetal viability, unless a doctor considers it necessary to protect the mother&#39;s life or health, passed by more than thirteen percentage points. Kelly Hall, the executive director of the Fairness Project, which promotes progressive ballot measures in red and purple states, told me, “A victory in Ohio really does tell all of us in the abortion-rights movement that this is possible almost everywhere.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Ohio was the only state this year where voters had an up-or-down vote on abortion rights, but results there and elsewhere offered fresh evidence that the issue is likely to help Democrats in 2024. In Virginia, Democrats who lambasted the anti-abortion policies of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/glenn-youngkins-victory-is-a-warning-for-democrats&quot;>;Glenn Youngkin&lt;/a>;, the Republican governor, retained their leadership of the state Senate and won control of the House. In Kentucky, the Democratic governor, Andy Beshear, won reëlection against the Republican attorney general, &lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/article/abortion-kentucky-governor-campaign-ec767bf7802852d48ea150b7118fc90c&quot;>;Daniel Cameron&lt;/a>;, who supports the state&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/2023/02/16/1156192879/abortion-kentucky-supreme-court-bans-roe-dobbs&quot;>;near-total ban&lt;/a>; on abortion. In Pennsylvania, Democrats added to their majority on the state Supreme Court, &lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/article/pennsylvania-election-state-supreme-court-5303f2c0d2145c3c0d162e565cfda7b7&quot;>;electing Dan McCaffery&lt;/a>;, who made abortion access a central part of his campaign for a ten-year term.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The results also show that pro-choice voters were not persuaded by some Republicans&#39; attempts to moderate their positions. Youngkin, often mentioned as a potential Presidential candidate, has said that “life begins at conception” and that he would sign any bill “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2022/06/29/youngkin-abortion-life-conception/&quot;>;happily and gleefully in order to protect life&lt;/a>;.” But, during the campaign in Virginia, the last Southern state where widespread access to abortion is protected, Youngkin&#39;s political-action committee spent $1.4 million to distribute &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://twitter.com/TeamYoungkin/status/1711824534750302614&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://twitter.com/TeamYoungkin/status/1711824534750302614&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/TeamYoungkin/status/1711824534750302614&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;a video advertisement&lt;/a>; that declared support for a “reasonable fifteen-week limit,” with exceptions for rape, incest, and the life of the mother, though not for cases in which the fetus has a fatal anomaly.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In Ohio, supporters of abortion rights argued that the amendment favored patients over politicians, and protected decisions not only on abortion but also on contraception, fertility treatment, miscarriage care, and “continuing one&#39;s own pregnancy” as essential health provisions. They emphasized that there is no known medical justification for limits on abortion and framed the choice to get one as a matter of personal liberty. On Wednesday, Lauren Blauvelt, the co-chair of Ohioans United for Reproductive Rights, said that voters turned out “to reclaim their freedom to make their most personal decisions without government interference.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Reproductive-rights advocates in Ohio &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://19thnews.org/2023/11/ohio-issue-1-voter-turnout-spending-outcome-abortion-measure/&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://19thnews.org/2023/11/ohio-issue-1-voter-turnout-spending-outcome-abortion-measure/&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://19thnews.org/2023/11/ohio-issue-1-voter-turnout-spending-outcome-abortion-measure/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;outraised and outspent&lt;/a>; their opponents by millions of dollars, and built a coalition that stretched across parties and geography, bolstered by labor unions, pastors, and groups of motivated women.

We are the majority.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;In the past fifteen months, voters have protected abortion rights on ballot questions &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/23451074/abortion-ballot-measure-midterms-kentucky-montana-michigan&quot;>;six times&lt;/a>; in a row, in Kansas, Montana, Vermont, California, Michigan, and Kentucky. To win in Ohio, where abortion remained legal pending the state Supreme Court&#39;s review of the six-week ban, abortion-rights supporters had to overcome maneuvers by Republicans who were determined to break the streak.&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Last spring, as pro-choice groups began to collect signatures to get on the ballot, Frank LaRose, the secretary of state, pushed successfully for an August referendum that would raise the threshold for passing constitutional amendments to sixty per cent from a simple majority, which had been the standard in Ohio &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-abortion-fight-has-voters-turning-to-ballot-initiatives&quot;>;since 1912&lt;/a>;. This came just months after he helped persuade the GOP-dominated legislature to abolish August special elections, which historically have low turnout, &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.ohiosos.gov/media-center/press-releases/2021/2021-12-09/&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.ohiosos.gov/media-center/press-releases/2021/2021-12-09/&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.ohiosos.gov/media-center/press-releases/2021/2021-12-09/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;calling them&lt;/a>; “bad news for the civic health of our state.” At first, he &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/17/politics/frank-larose-senate-2024/index.html&quot;>;insisted&lt;/a>; that changing the rules was simply a matter of “good government.” But, addressing supporters in Seneca County, he said that the tactic was “one hundred per cent about keeping a radical pro-abortion amendment out of our constitution.” Voters &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/how-ohio-voters-defeated-an-effort-to-thwart-abortion-rights&quot;>;rejected that move&lt;/a>; by fourteen percentage points.

The chair of the board was LaRose, who said he “worked extensively” on the text, which included replacing “fetus” with “unborn child” and framing the amendment in a way least favorable to the abortion-rights effort. Instead of the precise language of the amendment, specifying that the state may prohibit abortion after fetal viability, with life and health exceptions, the summary asserted that the amendment “would always allow an unborn child to be aborted at any stage of pregnancy, regardless of viability,” if the treating physician deems it necessary. Ohioans United for Reproductive Rights called the changes “a naked attempt to mislead perpetrated by their own elected officials.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In response, the leaders of Red Wine and Blue, a group that mobilizes suburban women to work for progressive causes, convened an emergency training session to help volunteers communicate to voters what the proposed amendment actually said. “Just getting the full text in front of as many people as possible,” Jen Perez, the program director for the Ohio team, said. Opponents maintained, for example, that the amendment would eliminate parents&#39; rights should their underage children become pregnant because the text specifies that “every individual” has a right to choose abortion. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2022/06/29/youngkin-abortion-life-conception/&quot;>;consensus among&lt;/a>; legal experts, however, holds that minors&#39; rights can be restricted. The coalition argued that the amendment actually strengthens the rights of parents, who would have the option of helping their child choose how to handle a pregnancy. Under the six-week law, even a child who needed an abortion after a sexual assault would have to leave the state to get one. This happened last year, when a ten-year-old rape victim in Ohio was required to travel to Indiana for treatment, in a case that drew national attention.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Amid such stories, and as polls showed consistent support for abortion access, Mike DeWine, Ohio&#39;s Republican governor, who had signed the six-week law in 2019, tried—as Youngkin had—to put a more moderate face on the anti-abortion movement in the weeks before Tuesday&#39;s vote. He said that the constitutional amendment was a “radical proposal,” and, in a widely viewed, thirty-second advertisement, he and his wife, Fran, presented the amendment opponents as the reasonable side. “Everywhere we go,” the Governor says, “folks tell us they&#39;re confused about Issue 1.” Fran DeWine goes on to say that the amendment would allow abortion “at any time during a pregnancy.” (The ad &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.wkyc.com/article/news/investigations/3news-investigates-fact-checking-anti-issue-1-ad-ohio-gov-mike-dewine/95-914bff58-0c8f-4281-a44b-dc9dd072e825&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.wkyc.com/article/news/investigations/3news-investigates-fact-checking-anti-issue-1-ad-ohio-gov-mike-dewine/95-914bff58-0c8f-4281-a44b-dc9dd072e825&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.wkyc.com/article/news/investigations/3news-investigates-fact-checking-anti-issue-1-ad-ohio-gov-mike-dewine/95-914bff58-0c8f-4281-a44b-dc9dd072e825&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;did not pass muster&lt;/a>; with fact checkers.)

The morning drizzle had just let up, and yellow wildflowers dotted the roadside. Soon, traffic slowed to a crawl, and the wildflowers were replaced by tents full of a bewildering array of merchandise. For most of the year, Round Top has an official population of eighty-seven, but in October and March an estimated hundred thousand visitors come here to visit a sprawling antique market, one of the biggest in the world.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Shoppers have been drawn to Round Top since a pair of Houston socialites hosted the town&#39;s inaugural sale, in 1968. In the early nineties, Youngblood visited the fair for the first time with her grandmother. “It was very small, just a select few buildings and fields,” she said. “But there was just this spirit of treasure hunting.” (As Youngblood recalls, her grandmother bought so many lamps, rugs, and assorted bric-a-brac that she had to tie her Lincoln Continental&#39;s door closed with her purse strap.)&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Other antique markets around the country have closed, casualties of the shift to online shopping, but the fair in Round Top has become only bigger. Although it still has the reputation of being a flea-market town, Round Top is transforming into an upscale shopping mecca. This can make visiting feel a little surreal: it&#39;s a place that insists on its quaintness even as it has rapidly outgrown it. As the traffic inched forward, Youngblood pointed out buildings that hadn&#39;t existed a year earlier. “That&#39;s new,” she said, peering out of the window at a barnlike structure made of artfully rusty corrugated tin, part of a new shopping complex. “I think this guy is in the process of adding nine buildings.”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;GenericCallout&quot;>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;An antique market in the rain.&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654ba1b46956fb0fcd9c736d/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Monroe-RoundTop_DSC6841.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654ba1b46956fb0fcd9c736d/master/w_120,c_limit/Monroe-RoundTop_DSC6841.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654ba1b46956fb0fcd9c736d/master/w_240,c_limit/Monroe-RoundTop_DSC6841.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654ba1b46956fb0fcd9c736d/master/w_320,c_limit/Monroe-RoundTop_DSC6841.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654ba1b46956fb0fcd9c736d/master/w_640,c_limit/Monroe-RoundTop_DSC6841.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654ba1b46956fb0fcd9c736d/master/w_960,c_limit/Monroe-RoundTop_DSC6841.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654ba1b46956fb0fcd9c736d/master/w_1280,c_limit/Monroe-RoundTop_DSC6841.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654ba1b46956fb0fcd9c736d/master/w_1600,c_limit/Monroe-RoundTop_DSC6841.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;A rainstorm at Market Hill.&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Youngblood has a throaty voice and a penchant for over-the-top looks; the night I met her, she was hosting a dinner party for a hundred people, to which she wore a yellow caftan, a two-foot-high floral headdress, a cascade of necklaces, and a turquoise ring the size of a hockey puck. “She&#39;s the grandmother of Round Top,” the fashion designer Lela Rose told me, then quickly corrected herself. “Not in terms of age, though! She&#39;s . 。 。 the grande dame of Round Top.” Shopping in the town can be overwhelming—there is no one central market but, rather, dozens of different venues, such as Marburger Farm, each with its own schedule and its own collection of venders. Youngblood, a Texas native, has become a kind of unofficial Round Top ambassador, guiding visitors through the chaos. She has shopped with celebrities she prefers not to name (according to gossip, they include Gwen Stefani and the designer Kelly Wearstler), and with people who are less known but no less wealthy. “It&#39;s mostly people who have second, third homes—if you&#39;re buying for multiple houses, this is the place to do it,” Youngblood told me.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;We arrived at Marburger before the official opening at 9 &lt;em >;AM&lt;/em>; Groups of women clustered around the tents&#39; perimeter, angling for a glimpse of the merchandise inside, fizzy with anticipatory energy. Youngblood had a shopping agenda for the day: she needed furnishings for a small bar called Grandma&#39;s Clam that she planned to open in Austin. “It&#39;ll be kind of raunchy but sophisticated, very grandma, like a Palm Beach estate sale,” she said. Youngblood was joined by her friend David Mendoza, an Austin entrepreneur and bar owner who, as he attempted to explain to me, “also designs brands for brands.” He was shopping for several “bar concepts,” one his own and the others belonging to client-friends. “One is, like, a Chateau Marmont-Spanish-nineteen-thirties-mohair-sofas-fringe-on-the-pillows kind of vibe. Another is a hard-door dressy night club, very black glass, white orchids. Basically, I want it to look like an YSL Opium ad from the seventies,” he said. A third bar, which he planned to open in Austin later this year, was inspired by ancient Rome, just before the fall of the Empire: “Everyone talks about how Austin is the fastest-growing city, but it can all backfire in an instant. I want to pull from that tension. Like, get it while you can.”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;feature-large-callout&quot; >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;GroupCalloutWrapper&quot;>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;An antique bust mirrors and chandelier at an antique market.&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654ba1b5cd3f944494927ad9/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Monroe-RoundTop_DSC7333.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654ba1b5cd3f944494927ad9/master/w_120,c_limit/Monroe-RoundTop_DSC7333.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654ba1b5cd3f944494927ad9/master/w_240,c_limit/Monroe-RoundTop_DSC7333.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654ba1b5cd3f944494927ad9/master/w_320,c_limit/Monroe-RoundTop_DSC7333.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654ba1b5cd3f944494927ad9/master/w_640,c_limit/Monroe-RoundTop_DSC7333.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654ba1b5cd3f944494927ad9/master/w_960,c_limit/Monroe-RoundTop_DSC7333.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654ba1b5cd3f944494927ad9/master/w_1280,c_limit/Monroe-RoundTop_DSC7333.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654ba1b5cd3f944494927ad9/master/w_1600,c_limit/Monroe-RoundTop_DSC7333.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;Items on sale at Marburger Farm Antique Show.&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;Women in wide brimmed hats drinking.&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654ba1b4a074267f2f22ee55/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Monroe-RoundTop_DSC7177_V1.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654ba1b4a074267f2f22ee55/master/w_120,c_limit/Monroe-RoundTop_DSC7177_V1.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654ba1b4a074267f2f22ee55/master/w_240,c_limit/Monroe-RoundTop_DSC7177_V1.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654ba1b4a074267f2f22ee55/master/w_320,c_limit/Monroe-RoundTop_DSC7177_V1.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654ba1b4a074267f2f22ee55/master/w_640,c_limit/Monroe-RoundTop_DSC7177_V1.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654ba1b4a074267f2f22ee55/master/w_960,c_limit/Monroe-RoundTop_DSC7177_V1.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654ba1b4a074267f2f22ee55/master/w_1280,c_limit/Monroe-RoundTop_DSC7177_V1.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654ba1b4a074267f2f22ee55/master/w_1600,c_limit/Monroe-RoundTop_DSC7177_V1.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;Friends drinking margaritas at Market Hill.&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;At nine, shoppers flooded the tents. Mendoza and Youngblood walked swiftly, scanning the merchandise, occasionally pausing to greet an acquaintance. (“Where did we go last time, when I bought that &lt;em>;fabulous&lt;/em>; sleigh?” a woman in a fringed jacket asked Youngblood.) Mendoza stopped to eye a pair of fat-cheeked cherubs carved from wood. “That&#39;s a vibe,” he said appreciatively. “I&#39;m &lt;em>;so&lt;/em>; into those,” Youngblood said. They were less impressed by a booth stocked with teak furniture upholstered in white bouclé. “I&#39;m &lt;em>;already&lt;/em>; asleep,” Mendoza said. “That&#39;s why I don&#39;t worry about getting here early,” Youngblood said. “No one wants what I want.” A dealer acquaintance waved her over. “You&#39;ve got to see this, it&#39;s so you,” he enthused. The object in question was a twelve-foot taxidermy crocodile wearing a saddle and bridle, its long mouth open in an evil grin. “What? This is incredible,” Youngblood said. She seemed briefly tempted. “But what am I going to do with this?” she asked. She decided against the crocodile, but quickly racked up other purchases: a cane-and-pencil-reed cabinet, a large stippled-glass Venetian mirror (“I love the brokenness of it”), a taxidermy flamingo, and a set of VIP-themed cocktail glasses. In about forty-five minutes, she spent a little less than ten thousand dollars.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;GenericCallout&quot;>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;A collection of antique objects.&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654ba1b401a33e34f9a7d78d/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Monroe-RoundTop_DSC6771.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654ba1b401a33e34f9a7d78d/master/w_120,c_limit/Monroe-RoundTop_DSC6771.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654ba1b401a33e34f9a7d78d/master/w_240,c_limit/Monroe-RoundTop_DSC6771.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654ba1b401a33e34f9a7d78d/master/w_320,c_limit/Monroe-RoundTop_DSC6771.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654ba1b401a33e34f9a7d78d/master/w_640,c_limit/Monroe-RoundTop_DSC6771.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654ba1b401a33e34f9a7d78d/master/w_960,c_limit/Monroe-RoundTop_DSC6771.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654ba1b401a33e34f9a7d78d/master/w_1280,c_limit/Monroe-RoundTop_DSC6771.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654ba1b401a33e34f9a7d78d/master/w_1600,c_limit/Monroe-RoundTop_DSC6771.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;Items for sale at Eneby Home.&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;By 10:30 &lt;em >;AM&lt;/em>;, some shoppers were sipping glasses of rosé. Many were wearing the unofficial Round Top uniform: wide-brimmed hat, flowy floral dress, and boots. “It was quilted jackets last season. I was counting the quilted jackets,” one designer told me. “Now it&#39;s those metallic boots. And cowboy hats with stuff stuck in them,” her friend said. (The metallic boots in question, which were everywhere, are designed by Miron Crosby and cost twelve hundred dollars.)&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;At lunch, Youngblood sat down with Arvin Olano, a fresh-faced Los Angeles content creator with manicured nails and blocky tortoiseshell glasses. Olano started his design-focussed YouTube channel during the pandemic, posting videos with titles like “10 Luxurious IKEA Products Stylist Approved” and “Best &amp;amp; Worst New Target Spring 2022 Decor &amp;amp; Furniture.” “Then I discovered vintage,” he said. For the fair, he was trying out a new technique: custom-made “Sold” stickers printed with his name—that way, shoppers who came after him would see what he&#39;d bought.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;0x8zj&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;The crowds at Round Top were a testament to the market in vintage goods, which surged during the pandemic. “The consumption was just unreal,” Mark Dooley, a longtime Round Top dealer, told me. “You could sell literally anything.” I heard various explanations for this phenomenon: supply-chain issues made buying new items unreliable; travel restrictions meant that wealthy Texans were doing more of their shopping closer to home; after too much time spent glued to screens, people were hungry for objects with a patina and a history. A dealer and designer named Amelia Tarbet sources most of her merchandise in Europe. “It&#39;s getting so hard to find decent stuff,” she told me. “What I&#39;m paying for things now is what I would have retailed them for twenty-four months ago. The influencers are hitting vintage hard-core, and pieces can get so trendy so quickly. Round Top has become this gold rush—sometimes it feels like the stock market.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;But the fair&#39;s popularity as a see-and-be-seen destination doesn&#39;t always translate to increased sales. “This show is just a pressure cooker,” a Midwestern dealer, who asked me not to use his name, said. The tents were full of tipsy would-be shoppers taking selfies, but the buying wasn&#39;t as brisk as he&#39;d hoped. “I&#39;m trying not to panic,” he said. “People don&#39;t want to buy from a sad guy. They want to buy from someone who&#39;s, like, &#39;Oh, this is just my hobby.&#39; But this is how I feed my kids.”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;GenericCallout&quot;>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;GroupCalloutWrapper&quot;>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;People visiting an antique market.&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654ba1b642899839b22bbfbe/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Monroe-RoundTop_DSC7374.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654ba1b642899839b22bbfbe/master/w_120,c_limit/Monroe-RoundTop_DSC7374.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654ba1b642899839b22bbfbe/master/w_240,c_limit/Monroe-RoundTop_DSC7374.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654ba1b642899839b22bbfbe/master/w_320,c_limit/Monroe-RoundTop_DSC7374.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654ba1b642899839b22bbfbe/master/w_640,c_limit/Monroe-RoundTop_DSC7374.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654ba1b642899839b22bbfbe/master/w_960,c_limit/Monroe-RoundTop_DSC7374.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654ba1b642899839b22bbfbe/master/w_1280,c_limit/Monroe-RoundTop_DSC7374.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654ba1b642899839b22bbfbe/master/w_1600,c_limit/Monroe-RoundTop_DSC7374.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;Visitors at Marburger Farm Antique Show.&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;A woman sitting under an antique lamp.&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654ba1b4905dd1db97b5a180/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Monroe-RoundTop_DSC6906.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654ba1b4905dd1db97b5a180/master/w_120,c_limit/Monroe-RoundTop_DSC6906.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654ba1b4905dd1db97b5a180/master/w_240,c_limit/Monroe-RoundTop_DSC6906.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654ba1b4905dd1db97b5a180/master/w_320,c_limit/Monroe-RoundTop_DSC6906.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654ba1b4905dd1db97b5a180/master/w_640,c_limit/Monroe-RoundTop_DSC6906.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654ba1b4905dd1db97b5a180/master/w_960,c_limit/Monroe-RoundTop_DSC6906.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654ba1b4905dd1db97b5a180/master/w_1280,c_limit/Monroe-RoundTop_DSC6906.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654ba1b4905dd1db97b5a180/master/w_1600,c_limit/Monroe-RoundTop_DSC6906.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;Amelia Tarbet, the owner of a store in Market Hill.&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;When I told people I was going to meet the mayor of Round Top, they seemed to expect I was in for a charmingly small-town experience. (“Is the mayor a dog?” a friend asked.) In fact, the mayor is a forty-three-year-old property developer from Houston named Mark Massey, who has played a pivotal role in the development—or overdevelopment—of the town. Houston and Austin are among the country&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/02/13/the-astonishing-transformation-of-austin&quot;>;fastest-growing cities&lt;/a>;; Round Top, an agricultural community situated halfway between the two—about a ninety-minute drive from either—is in the midst of a building boom. Land that sold for ten thousand dollars an acre eight years ago now goes for ten times as much. Across town, hayfields have been replaced by ranchette developments, and the town is full of new construction that tries, with varying levels of success, to look old.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I met Massey at the Compound, former pastureland that he had converted into a “multi-acre master-planned event-and-entertainment venue.” The Compound&#39;s central building is a white barn with affirmations painted on its eaves: “Dance Proud”; “Be Kind”; “Say Howdy”; “Dream Big”; “Hug Puppies.” We sat in a gazebo bar that was serving a steady stream of pre-noon drinkers. Massey grew up in Houston; during the summers, he&#39;d visit his grandparents&#39; farm in Round Top for a taste of country life. “You know, fishing, four-wheelers, all that fun stuff,” he said. Massey was working for a developer in Beverly Hills when, in 2010, his mother proposed a family project: they would buy up some old buildings around a historic square in town, restore them, and rent them out to small independent merchants. “That leased out, like, overnight, it seemed,” he said. The town, he realized, had potential. Round Top had what people wanted: “that Hamptons-Aspen-Santa Fe-Marfa kind of feel, you know, that elevated small town,” he said.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Since then, Massey has gone on to develop several more town squares in Round Top, including the Compound. (The others are named for the area&#39;s early German mercantile families: Henkel Square, Minden Square, Fricke Square, Rummel Square.) To assemble them, Massey scoured the countryside for visually pleasing old buildings—“just a quaint cottage look with some character”—to relocate and repurpose. “They put these giant steel beams underneath and lift the house up on a truck,” he said. “Sometimes, depending on the size, they&#39;ll cut the house into pieces. So it&#39;s literally, like, big sections of house moving down this two-lane highway. They have to raise the power lines. It&#39;s crazy. People will pull off the road to take pictures.” Visitors occasionally assume that the developments have been around since the town&#39;s founding.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In 2020, Massey was elected Round Top&#39;s mayor, winning fifty-four votes to his opponent&#39;s thirty-six. His affection for historic preservation has helped insure that, despite the rapid pace of development, Round Top maintains its carefully cultivated image. More than anywhere else I&#39;ve been, it feels like a small town in a Lifetime movie, where neighbors wave hello and there&#39;s not a vape shop, CrossFit studio, or Dollar General to be seen. “People want that life style—going out West, having property, having critters, living off the land,” Massey explained. “That Western kind of pioneer spirit. I think it&#39;s a big deal right now.”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;GenericCallout&quot;>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;A woman in a yellow dress and flowers on her head standing on a porch.&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654ba1b66956fb0fcd9c7370/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Monroe-RoundTop_DSC7899.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654ba1b66956fb0fcd9c7370/master/w_120,c_limit/Monroe-RoundTop_DSC7899.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654ba1b66956fb0fcd9c7370/master/w_240,c_limit/Monroe-RoundTop_DSC7899.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654ba1b66956fb0fcd9c7370/master/w_320,c_limit/Monroe-RoundTop_DSC7899.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654ba1b66956fb0fcd9c7370/master/w_640,c_limit/Monroe-RoundTop_DSC7899.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654ba1b66956fb0fcd9c7370/master/w_960,c_limit/Monroe-RoundTop_DSC7899.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654ba1b66956fb0fcd9c7370/master/w_1280,c_limit/Monroe-RoundTop_DSC7899.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654ba1b66956fb0fcd9c7370/master/w_1600,c_limit/Monroe-RoundTop_DSC7899.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;Sheila Youngblood at Rancho Pillow, her hotel.&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;After the Marburger opening, Youngblood hosted another huge dinner party at Rancho Pillow, a hotel-venue compound she opened in 2016. Rancho Pillow has a colorful, geographically indiscriminate aesthetic, like an upscale honky-tonk in a Mexican beach town; there&#39;s an air-conditioned tepee, a heated saltwater wading pool, and a bathhouse with “Listen” painted on its tin roof.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;At dinner, I sat across from the jewelry designer Kendra Scott, a regular “guest shark” on “Shark Tank,” who was at Round Top buying for Yellow Rose, her new ranch-inspired brand. “It&#39;s about putting the cowgirl front and center,” she said. She showed me a picture of one of her purchases from the fair: an adult-size mechanical horse from the nineteen-fifties. (In four days of shopping, Scott amassed enough items to fill three trailers.) The look of the moment, she believed, was something rugged but refined. “You know, &#39;Yellowstone,&#39; and how everybody thinks cowboys are sexy now? And cowgirls!” she said. “People want those Beth Dutton vibes. You can be tough and sexy. Like, I can run a billion-dollar brand and then go get on my horse along with my sexy cowboy husband—that&#39;s a great life.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;A lanky, graying man sitting across from Scott shook his head. His name is Evan Voyles, and he described himself as a “recovering dealer” living in Austin. He was cynical about what Round Top had become. “To call it a theme park would be generous,” he said. “There&#39;s interesting stuff in there, but we&#39;ve undermined it. It used to be old buildings, &lt;em>;small&lt;/em>; buildings, small roads. It wasn&#39;t a feeding frenzy. Maybe it&#39;s just that I&#39;m getting old, but the stuff isn&#39;t looking so good to me anymore.” Voyles said that, in the early nineties, he had briefly owned the world&#39;s largest collection of vintage cowboy boots, which he&#39;d acquired by travelling the country, scouring secondhand shops. He&#39;d helped supply the market with old boots, then watched it get overcapitalized. Now Los Angeles boutiques sell mediocre Tony Lama boots from the nineties for hundreds of dollars, the thrift stores are full of fast fashion, and it is nearly impossible to find hidden treasures anymore. Everyone seems to know, or think they know, what things were worth. “It&#39;s just like a herd of buffalo builds up over eons, but all it takes is six crazy guys and a market for it to be destroyed in a matter of years,” Voyles said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I wandered inside to the living room, which was decorated with Youngblood&#39;s antique-fair finds—faded rugs, wrought-iron candelabras. At one edge of the room, a well-worn Western saddle hung from a wooden beam. It was covered with circular pieces of mirror, like a DIY cowboy disco ball. Youngblood told me later that it had decorated a dance hall in Kansas in the nineteen-twenties. It was beautiful and strange, and in that moment I desperately wanted to possess it—an old object, full of all the magic I was missing. ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;feature-large-callout&quot; >;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;A large amount of books and chairs at an antique market.&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654ba1b65014f259f24144ef/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Monroe-RoundTop_DSC7606.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654ba1b65014f259f24144ef/master/w_120,c_limit/Monroe-RoundTop_DSC7606.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654ba1b65014f259f24144ef/master/w_240,c_limit/Monroe-RoundTop_DSC7606.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654ba1b65014f259f24144ef/master/w_320,c_limit/Monroe-RoundTop_DSC7606.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654ba1b65014f259f24144ef/master/w_640,c_limit/Monroe-RoundTop_DSC7606.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654ba1b65014f259f24144ef/master/w_960,c_limit/Monroe-RoundTop_DSC7606.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654ba1b65014f259f24144ef/master/w_1280,c_limit/Monroe-RoundTop_DSC7606.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654ba1b65014f259f24144ef/master/w_1600,c_limit/Monroe-RoundTop_DSC7606.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;Chairs and books on sale at Excess II.&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 10 Nov 2023 06:06:02 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
