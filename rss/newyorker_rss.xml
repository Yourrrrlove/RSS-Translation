data-event-click=&quot;{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.taxobservatory.eu/publication/global- tax-evasion-report-2024/&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.taxobservatory.eu/publication/global-tax-evasion-report-2024/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;关于全球逃税的报告，其中包含一些积极的消息。报告称：“我们估计，过去 10 年离岸逃税现象减少了约三倍。” “这一成功表明，如果有政治意愿，就可以在打击逃税方面取得快速进展。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;尽管有这一发现，避税天堂持有的财富总量并没有太大变化，报告指出。现在的不同之处在于，由于美国在奥巴马政府期间首创的银行透明度法，大部分离岸财富对其持有人所在国的税务机关来说是可见的。而且，由于大多数国家以某种形式对全球收入征税，因此这些账户产生的收入也要纳税。报告称：“如今，离岸家庭金融财富仍占世界 GDP 的 10%，但在我们的中心情景中，只有约 25% 逃税。”与十年或十五年前相比，这是一个巨大的变化，当时研究表明，百分之九十到九十五的离岸金融财富没有向税务机关报告。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;重大政策突破是 2010 年 3 月通过的法案海外账户税收合规法案 (&lt;em>;FATCA&lt;/em>;) 是在参议院调查后​​制定的，估计国际逃税每年给美国财政部造成的损失高达一千亿美元。在&lt;em>;FATCA&lt;/em>;颁布之前，美国富人可以将大笔资金转移到瑞士和其他避税天堂，因为他们知道收到这笔钱的银行永远不会通知国税局。 &lt;em>;FATCA&lt;/em>;要求美国纳税人披露外国银行账户，同样重要的是，它要求海外银行，包括位于避税天堂的银行，向美国当局报告美国纳税人的持有情况。 “这项规定将使逃税者更难隐瞒外国银行的资产和收入，”民主党参议员卡尔·莱文(Carl Levin)当时表示，他领导了一个帮助揭露问题规模的小组委员会。 “随着越来越多的银行建立披露美国账户持有人信息的系统，银行保密将变得越来越难以维护。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;莱文是对的。 &lt;em>;FATCA&lt;/em>;不仅为美国国税局提供了更多有关海外财富的信息，而且还为其他国家树立了榜样。 2014 年，即 FATCA 生效的同一年，包括经济合作与发展组织所有 38 个成员国在内的数十个国家同意采用共同报告标准 (CRS)，该标准将要求银行共享外国居民开设的账户信息，包括账户持有人的姓名、纳税人识别号以及账户余额。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;该协议有效建立了一个全球私人银行信息交换系统。新报告指出，截至 2022 年 10 月，包括许多离岸避税天堂在内的一百多个税务管辖区已经应用了新规则，各国已达成近五千项双边协议来交换金融信息：“这一革命性的发展表明，长期以来被认为是乌托邦的新形式的国际合作可以在相对较短的时间内出现。”&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;在一个全球性问题，例如&lt;a href=&quot;https ://www.newyorker.com/tag/climate-change&quot;>;气候变化&lt;/a>;和大规模移民往往在政治上看起来很棘手，但遏制国际逃税的成功向世界各地的多边主义者发出了充满希望的信息。它表明，如果公众继续施加压力，如果政治家和政策制定者付出努力，就可以达成并执行有意义的国际协议。 “十五年前，很少有人相信这种全球银行信息自动交换可能存在，”报告提醒我们。如今，这一制度让富有的不法分子更难隐藏他们的金融资产。这就是进步。&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;可以肯定的是，这并不意味着国际逃税不再是一个问题。在赞扬信息共享方面取得的进步之后，报告强调了该系统仍然受到违规和漏洞的困扰。只要还有不道德的人想要隐瞒大量财富，就会有同样不道德的金融家和律师渴望让他们规避规则。在一个臭名昭著的案例中，瑞士信贷的银行家们在与美国政府达成认罪协议后仍继续帮助客户保密其海外账户。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;富人仍在使用空壳公司和其他行政手段。报告指出，为了逃避税务机关的追查，并且还投资海外房地产，而海外房地产不受 FATCA 或 CRS 的管辖——这两项措施仅适用于金融资产。该报告强调了外国人在伦敦、巴黎和迪拜等地拥有的价值约 5000 亿美元的房产。报告继续说道：“除了房地产，加密货币是下一个前沿领域。”这些观点补充了其他专家关于开曼群岛和美属维尔京群岛等一些离岸避税天堂仍然缺乏透明度的警告。言归正传，尽管美国在引入 FATCA 方面发挥了领导作用，但它并不是 CRS 的缔约方，而 CRS 可能使外国人能够&lt;a href=&quot;https://www .newyorker.com/news/annals-of-inquiry/uncovering-the-secret-offshore-accounts-of-the-global-elite&quot;>;利用这个国家作为避税天堂&lt;/a>;。&lt;/p>;&lt;p该报告还强调了另外两个持续存在的税收问题：跨国公司将利润转移到低税国家，巨额财富即使没有转移到海外，也基本上没有纳税。 2021年，包括美国在内的一百多个国家同意实行15%的最低企业税率，原则上这是一个里程碑式的进展。报告称：“但自 2021 年达成政治协议以来，全球最低标准已因越来越多的漏洞而大幅削弱。”就目前情况而言，它“只能产生根据 2021 年制定的原则预计产生的税收收入的一小部分。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;这种对原始协议的削弱有力地提醒了人们政治游说在美国和其他地方的持久影响。缺乏有效的国内财富税是另一个问题。有时，富有的利益集团和普通纳税人之间的斗争似乎是一边倒的，以至于根本算不上一场竞争。但 &lt;em>;FATCA&lt;/em>; 和 CRS 的教训是，有意义的改革仍然是可能的。或者，正如新报告所说，逃税不是自然法则，而是政策选择。” ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;8passp&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot;

data-event -click=&quot;{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Pigeon-Tunnel-Stories-My-Life/dp/0735220778&quot;}&quot; href= “https://www.amazon.com/Pigeon-Tunnel-Stories-My-Life/dp/0735220778” rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;2016 年回忆录&lt;/a>;，作者：David Cornwell，更为人所知的是他的笔名 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/john-le-carres-search-for-a-vocal&quot;>;John le Carré&lt;/a>;，以及几乎完全由采访组成，在采访中，最高间谍小说家与莫里斯谈论他的生活和其中的人们。 （康威尔&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/postscript/john-le-carre-missed-nothing&quot;>;于 2020 年去世&lt;/a>;；本片中的采访于 2019 年进行。 ）从一开始，莫里斯就将电影的创作作为其主题的一部分。他以一个片段开场，其中康威尔以明显令电影制片人高兴的方式扭转了莫里斯的局面，问道：“你是谁？”并解释了他为什么想知道。他说，接受采访“是一门表演艺术”，他想知道他在“向谁表演”，因为“你需要了解与你交谈的人的野心。”&lt;/p>;&lt;对于康威尔来说，这个问题不仅仅具有理论意义。作为英国情报部门的军事审讯员，他将莫里斯的采访与他自己通过“关系”——通过“建立他们对审讯者的依赖”——诱骗敌方对象给出答案的努力进行了比较。然而，尽管康威尔努力反身，在银幕上探讨他与莫里斯的关系，但并没有发生如此戏剧性的事情。他喜欢认为自己正在玩的高风险心理游戏从未真正发生过。尽管如此，《鸽子隧道》（正在影院上映并在 Apple TV+ 上播放）仍然是一幅引人入胜、色彩缤纷的自画像。我说“自我”是因为，尽管莫里斯作为电影制片人无疑做出了肖像构图的许多决定，但大致的轮廓显然是由康威尔在银幕上讲话时决定的。莫里斯的干预要么太少要么太多，但这部电影在某种程度上仍然在这些相反的失败的快乐中间找到了一个最佳点。尽管如此，它仍然远远没有达到自己的理论观点，并且也许无意中开启了它从未直接涉及的其他观点。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;这部电影的主要内容是康威尔对他父亲罗尼的回忆，一个有着远大梦想和鲁莽计划的骗子，他忙于努力保持领先于债权人和法律的一步，但并不总是成功。他在浮夸的生活方式和绝望的低头逃​​跑（或更糟）之间交替。康威尔的母亲奥利弗在儿子五岁的时候离开了，她对罗尼的行事方式感到精疲力尽，并对他的不忠感到恼怒，此后，这位渴望显赫的下流人士竭尽全力将大卫推入一个他自己永远无法进入的阶层。康威尔的父亲取得了成功，但他却对他们之间的社会差距感到不满，尽管他努力想搭上儿子的顺风车。 （康威尔以勒卡雷的名义撰写文章，在《纽约客》2002 年的一篇文章中讨论了这种关系，“&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2002/02/18 /in-ronnies-court&quot;>;在罗尼的法庭&lt;/a>;。”）莫里斯所追求的主题，以及康威尔欣然接受的主题，是这种极端浪漫的教养与上流社会的卑鄙边缘之间的联系。以及实际的黑社会——以及康威尔的职业生涯，首先是一名间谍，然后是一名间谍小说家。 “背叛让我着迷，”莫里斯在画外音中宣称，他敦促康威尔将罗尼的幻想和捏造、谎言、计划和欺骗与间谍活动的谎言和欺骗联系起来。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;不出所料，康威尔做到了一系列令人震惊、扣人心弦的故事和观察，充满了令人难忘和生动的描述。他回忆起小时候被送到赛马场的情景——博彩公司禁止他负债累累的父亲以暴力处罚——带着装满现金的手提箱，分发给债权人，回来时又带着装满新奖金的手提箱。他描述了自己在牛津时作为间谍的活动，目标是他最好的朋友之一。他讨论了英国情报局长金·菲尔比 (Kim Philby)，1963 年，他被揭露为苏联的双重间谍，并宣称菲尔比是他作为间谍和小说家的自我概念的核心。他讲述了柏林墙建成后几天在柏林的经历。他辛酸而痛苦地追溯了勒卡雷书籍带来名誉和财富后父亲的再次出现。&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;这些轶事使康威尔对人们的特殊心理有了尖刻的见解。间谍。他解释说，自己被招募从事间谍活动是为了适应一种游离的形象，寻求“机构的拥抱”。他在其勇敢的事迹中提到了政治原则的一个要素，但对其轻描淡写。康威尔认为，真正推动间谍前进的，是获取具有重要意义的巨大秘密——“世界最深处包含着什么，”他引用歌德的话“&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www .amazon.com/Faust-Part-Oxford-Worlds-Classics/dp/019953621X&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Faust-Part-Oxford-Worlds-Classics/dp/019953621X&quot; amazon.com/Faust-Part-Oxford-Worlds-Classics/dp/019953621X”}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Faust-Part-Oxford-Worlds-Classics/dp/019953621X&quot; rel=&quot; nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;浮士德&lt;/a>;。”莫里斯最坚持询问的是背叛的诱惑——成为双重间谍——而康威尔非常乐意畅所欲言。他说，对于像菲尔比这样的人来说，制度性的拥抱让位于一系列病态的极端：渴望被被盗秘密的最终接受者所爱，徒劳地假设“你是宇宙的中心”，骄傲向处理者“传递纯金”。他认为，还有一种纯粹的兴奋，一种对背叛的“上瘾”——他将这比作他父亲对口是心非以及由此带来的危险赌博的不可抗拒的吸引力。 （他称罗尼为“危机成瘾者”。）&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;简而言之，康威尔的故事是纯金的。然而，莫里斯却忍不住用他自己的点缀和装饰来装饰它们。他添加了勒卡雷书籍改编的电影片段以及档案电视新闻报道和采访的片段，并用静态照片和新闻剪报来强调动作。他从多个角度拍摄康威尔；有广角镜头和特写镜头，康威尔的照片是从门口拍摄的，还有一些是正面拍摄的。断断续续的编辑吸引了人们的注意力，也许表明康威尔的言论不是长篇大论，而是由片段组合而成——采访本身是一种秩序、一种抽象，而不是一种对抗或联系。然而，没有任何一个相机设置比任何其他相机设置更具启发性或分析性，并且并置几乎没有增加；多样性似乎流露出对停滞和单调的厌恶，传统多于发明。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;还有重演的使用问题，这是纪录片制作中长期存在的一个问题，并且与莫里斯有着千丝万缕的联系。 ，这要归功于他 1988 年的电影《细细的蓝线》的成功，该片依赖于对电影受访者讨论的事件进行广泛的戏剧性重建。这是一种被诅咒的做法，部分原因是很少有纪录片制片人对虚构作品有像非虚构作品那样的天赋，但更根本的是，因为反映特定受访者所说内容的义务使得戏剧自由几乎不可能，使电影制片人变得纯粹的插画家。 《鸽子隧道》中的情况就是如此，它的重演与康威尔讲述的戏剧性力量不相上下，也剥夺了观众想象更强大图像的机会。不过，有一个例外，一部戏剧化地展示了标题中的“鸽子隧道”，这是康威尔十几岁时与父亲一起去蒙特卡洛旅行时看到的。康威尔详细描述了如何在酒店屋顶捕获鸟类并将其放入隧道中，隧道的另一端出现在海滩上，体育射击运动员瞄准它们。幸存的鸟儿在飞回屋顶时被抓住并再次挖隧道；想想西西弗斯，但用的是子弹。这种重演，无论多么近似，都令人感动地达到了其目的，因为它赋予了抽象概念具体性，同时也将物质细节返回到康威尔体验它们的隐喻领域。&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden =&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;康威尔充满激情和风格地讲述他的故事，但莫里斯想要更多；他心中有更高的抽象概念，例如背叛的本质和故事的讲述。莫里斯敦促康威尔探索虚构与真理的本质，对欺骗进行哲学思考，但他却失望了：康威尔不适合他。他很想和莫里斯一起参与这些抽象的嬉戏，但他的和蔼可亲的努力只产生了关于真理主观性的普通概括。这就是莫里斯已经做得太多，现在做得太少的地方：他提出了他显然比康威尔更感兴趣的想法，他反复向康威尔提出问题。实际上，他试图让康威尔为他做他的工作——看起来不是出于懒惰，而是出于尊重和顺从。他知道康威尔是明星，并将舞台让给了他，但明星被迫浏览完全由电影制片人创作的主题网络。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;这些讨论中缺少的角色是莫里斯本人​​，他从未见过他与康威尔一起出现在屏幕上。莫里斯作为一名作家，是关于纪录片制作的伟大现代散文家之一，他最近没有写散文，而且他将自己的电影与散文家隔离开来，这对电影界来说是一种损失。 。 《鸽子隧道》迫切需要莫里斯本人​​的参与：电影般简单的构图，他与康威尔一起出现在银幕上，理智上自信，长篇大论，清楚地阐明了他的想法，让康威尔和观众知道他是谁。电影背后潜藏着一两篇文章，虽然我希望莫里斯写下它们，但我希望他能用自己的声音将它们放入电影中。在这部电影中，莫里斯似乎把自己的舌头绑在背后，恭敬但令人沮丧地抑制了自己说话的冲动。莫里斯拍摄的实际电影非常令人愉快。那个不是他做的，但它暗示着，很棒。 ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot;

It probably would have won had “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Moderate-Fable-Other-Poems-Marguerite/dp/B000I1QR9E&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Moderate-Fable-Other-Poems-Marguerite/dp/B000I1QR9E&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Moderate-Fable-Other-Poems-Marguerite/dp/B000I1QR9E&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;Moderate Fable&lt;/a>;,” another of Young&#39;s books, not won the same award for poetry that year. On the strength of this performance and a short writing sample, Young sold her next project—a novel with the working title “The Worm in the Wheat”—to Maxwell Perkins, the legendary Scribner editor who had discovered &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1926/04/17/that-sad-young-man&quot;>;Fitzgerald&lt;/a>;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1950/05/13/how-do-you-like-it-now-gentlemen&quot;>;Hemingway&lt;/a>;, and Thomas Wolfe.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Young envisioned a book that would top out at around two hundred pages and take two years to complete. When she delivered the manuscript to Scribner eighteen years later, the stack of papers was almost half as tall as she was. In the meantime, Young had acquired a new residence (the Greenwich Village apartment where she was to spend much of her life), a new editor (Burroughs Mitchell), a new series of honors (Guggenheim, Newberry Library, and Rockefeller Foundation fellowships), and a new title for her now epically proportioned novel: “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/MacIntosh-Darling-Dalkey-Archive-Essentials/dp/1628973951&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/MacIntosh-Darling-Dalkey-Archive-Essentials/dp/1628973951&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/MacIntosh-Darling-Dalkey-Archive-Essentials/dp/1628973951&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;Miss MacIntosh, My Darling&lt;/a>;.” Young, too, had reconstructed the Harmonist labyrinth—out of paper and ink instead of shrubbery and wood. In her version, though, there was no shrine waiting to be found in the center.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In “Miss MacIntosh, My Darling,” the American Dream is depicted quite literally: as a series of incompatible hallucinations. Set largely in the course of a single, harrowing nighttime bus ride during the last years of Depression, the story follows the narrator, Vera Cartwheel, as she sifts through her memories of her eccentric upbringing in a mansion on the coast of New England. It is into this house that Vera&#39;s mother, Catherine Helena Cartwheel, a legendary beauty and former socialite, has retreated following the death of Vera&#39;s father, a “professional ne&#39;er-do-well.” Catherine takes prodigious quantities of opium. She spends her days in a baroque dream world of her own creation, wandering the grounds full of life-size chessmen and out-of-tune grand pianos. She discourses with Mr. Chandelier, her chandelier, and Mr. Res Tacamah, her drug bottle, and entertains an imaginary cast of historical figures whom she has invited to tea.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The mansion is staffed by a retinue of servants and Catherine&#39;s loyal factotum, Mr. Joachim Spitzer, a failed composer whose love goes unreciprocated because Catherine prefers his identical twin, Peron, a gambler who has been dead for years. Although pathologically indecisive, Mr. Spitzer is tasked with finding a governess to raise Vera. He settles on the titular Georgia MacIntosh, a red-headed nursemaid with a broken nose, without asking for a single character reference.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Miss MacIntosh&#39;s pedagogical principles are unusual. They include proverbs from “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Poor-Richards-Almanack-Benjamin-Franklin/dp/0880889187&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Poor-Richards-Almanack-Benjamin-Franklin/dp/0880889187&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Poor-Richards-Almanack-Benjamin-Franklin/dp/0880889187&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;Poor Richard&#39;s Almanack&lt;/a>;,” factoids from the “Farmer&#39;s Almanac,” the primitive church doctrines of her missionary brother, and the pragmatism, asceticism, and small-“r” republicanism that once characterized the small-town ethos of the heartland. Her aim is to make her charge an industrious, deferential future wife, but she pursues her agenda with a single-mindedness just as detached from reality as Catherine, whose taste for luxury she opposes. A typical lesson finds Vera enjoined to state the population of Kansas, to recite the genealogies of the Moody Bible or the “great kings of baseball,” or to listen to half-baked sermons on the need for playing the stock market. Miss MacIntosh places great stock in practical skills and physical education, so she and Vera mend holes in sails and coats, hammer boards in rotted fences and broken rafts, and chase around a red ball.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Eventually, it becomes clear that, in her paeans to “homespun virtues” and the “bare simplicity” of truth, Miss MacIntosh doth protest too much. On Vera&#39;s fourteenth birthday, she discovers a secret about her governess that precipitates the latter&#39;s drowning, in an apparent suicide, in the ocean. Vera mourns the loss of her “darling” for years. When a storm swallows both the mansion and her mother, she decides to take Miss MacIntosh&#39;s advice to “strike out on [her] own.” She will “see America . 。 。 the broad interior, the spacious Middle West, that life which required no medium of the evil imagination to stand between one&#39;s self and the clear reality of simple things.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Vera&#39;s goal is to reach What Cheer, Iowa, where Miss MacIntosh grew up. She only makes it as far as southwest Indiana. In the novel&#39;s final act, she exits the bus and checks into a hotel that was once a former Harmonist dormitory and Owenite tavern. Far from experiencing the “normal life” that Miss MacIntosh had promised, Vera will meet characters in the Midwest—such as the drunk bus driver Moses Hunnecker, who refuses to cut his hair in protest of Roosevelt&#39;s policies, or the perpetually pregnant waitress Esther Longtree, who gives birth only to stillborns—who prove no less fantastical than those of her New England childhood.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;As her name suggests, Vera encounters the truth as something that is constantly flipping upside down and right side up again. In Young&#39;s telling, reality is not the neutral ground where disparate perceptions overlap; it is the interstices between them. Reality is the worm in the wheat, as the novel&#39;s working title would have it, the point at which our “perfect equations” come up short, our “definitions fail,” and our desires for “ultimate harmony” are frustrated. Truth is “but another illusion,” Vera is forced to conclude. As with the two utopias Young describes in “Angel in the Forest,” you could “substitute” one theory of life “for another and get the same result.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Vera spends most of her time listening to other people, but she&#39;s able to narrate the book partly because she&#39;s reconciled the seemingly antithetical world views of her mother and her nursemaid. She comes to agree with Catherine that “reality bears with it always an aspect of fateful disappointment,” and that making one&#39;s peace with illusion is precisely “that on which the whole of life depended.” Unlike Catherine, however, she gives up the quest for “perfect happiness,” a pragmatic move that Miss MacIntosh might have approved of. Although Vera never makes it to What Cheer, she doesn&#39;t despair. “One still had reached one&#39;s goal,” she reasons, “even if it was not the one intended . 。 。 Whatever one found was real.” What Vera finds at the end of “Miss MacIntosh, My Darling” is something none of the novel&#39;s perfection-seekers do: love.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Miss MacIntosh, My Darling” was a critical success when it appeared in 1965. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/12/26/the-making-of-norman-mailer&quot;>;Norman Mailer&lt;/a>;, impressed by Young&#39;s achievement, took her aside at a party to ask whether she had boxers in her family, “because it took a lot of strength hanging out in the sawdust ring like that, punching away for eighteen years.” (He later sent a letter to Scribner calling Young a “gentle Hercules in high heels,” which the publicity department promptly turned into a cartoon of Mailer and Young duking it out.) Young&#39;s former student, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tag/kurt-vonnegut&quot;>;Kurt Vonnegut&lt;/a>;, said that she was “unquestionably a genius,” and her friend, Anaïs Nin, praised “the complete universe” she had created. The New York &lt;em>;Times&lt;/em>; compared Young&#39;s prose to the “great styles” of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/07/29/herman-melville-at-home&quot;>;Melville&lt;/a>;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tag/james-joyce&quot;>;Joyce&lt;/a>;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/11/30/william-faulkners-demons&quot;>;Faulkner&lt;/a>;. Other reviewers invoked the term “the Great American Novel.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;We have grown wary of overheated praise, but it is impossible to talk about “Miss MacIntosh, My Darling,” which has just been reissued by Dalkey Archive Press, without superlatives. At 1,198 pages, it is among the longest single-volume novels in the English language. If “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Moby-Dick-Penguin-Classics-Herman-Melville/dp/0142437247&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Moby-Dick-Penguin-Classics-Herman-Melville/dp/0142437247&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Moby-Dick-Penguin-Classics-Herman-Melville/dp/0142437247&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;Moby-Dick&lt;/a>;,” the book against which all other Great American Novels are measured, is about a single monomaniac, “Miss MacIntosh” is a veritable republic of Ahabs, each more idiosyncratic than the next. An Indiana bus and a New England mansion furnish the book with its principal settings, but Young, much like Melville, never fails to imbue them with cosmological import. (In one scene, Vera, looking out the bus window, likens the “watery greyness of the Middle West” to the scene of “the first creation when only the spirit of God had moved upon the deep.”) The book is an epic of mothers and daughters, rather than of fathers and sons, husbands and wives, or war and peace, and Young&#39;s sentences, which marry the breadth of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tag/walt-whitman&quot;>;Whitman&lt;/a>; to the opulence of Nabokov, are among the most virtuosic ever produced by an American novelist.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Despite selling, according to Nin, forty thousand copies in its first year, “Miss MacIntosh” failed to make much impression on the public. This is hardly surprising. The novel&#39;s length alone makes it prohibitive for most readers. Like the Harmonist labyrinth on which its structure is based, it is easy to get lost in. The book proposes mysteries, approaches solutions, then swerves into digressions that last for hundreds of pages. It adds minor characters until the very last chapter, giving the impression that it could have continued indefinitely. Cause and effect are suspended just as surely as in one of Catherine&#39;s opium dreams, and states of being usually thought to be opposed—imagination and reality, life and death, female and male, past and future—switch or merge. Young&#39;s “transshifting” sentences (to use her coinage) do not so much progress from line to line as accrete via repetitions and variations of phrase and imagery:&lt;/p>;&lt;blockquote >;&lt;div >;&lt;p>;and Mr. Spitzer, though very mournful, should not consider that his great works were truly lost because no one had ever combed the sea of all its music, these great combers rolling, all its reflected stars and starfish riding at high tide, or delved unconsciousness, fishing for that great pearl—for no great musical composition, not even his great music as yet unplayed, had ever been so explicitly written wave after surging wave that, with all its audible and inaudible sounds and sonorous tonal poems touching the feathery clouds and quivering throat cords and tongues of golden bells burning like fire and chromatic colors pale as the colors of the sentinel dolphin dying on the moth-colored rocks and black notes like blackbirds flying overhead to escort him through seas of glassy clouds and great silver bells and trumpets spilling showers of sound and dead keys like his bones, dead bones singing, and waves surging over the empty boat, it could be played as written . 。 。 for none should sound these depths, and it was the music of beginning, and it was the music of ending never ending&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/blockquote>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;co8oc8&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;The experience of reading even a dozen pages like this is sensory overload and depletion of attention. It is, in the words of the scholar Steven Shaviro, “too much.” Not unlike America.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Young spent the rest of the sixties engaged in antiwar activism, teaching English and creative writing at Fordham and the New School. She discarded a biography of the New Harmony-born poet John Whitcomb Riley, author of “Little Orphant Annie” and “The Raggedy Man,” in favor of one on his friend &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/02/18/eugene-v-debs-and-the-endurance-of-socialism&quot;>;Eugene V.

Though gossipy and sexist, her &lt;em>;Times&lt;/em>; obituary gives an accurate picture of her standing: a “Greenwich Village eccentric,” rather than the author of one of the most ambitious novels of the twentieth century. Perhaps Dalkey&#39;s reissue will trigger a reëvaluation—but, then, does anyone still care about the Great American Novel? Since the term was coined, in the eighteen-sixties, Americans have gone through cycles of enchantment and disenchantment with the idea. In every generation, some novelist attempts to write one, to the chagrin of critics and scholars, who tend to find the concept at best a middlebrow parlor game and at worst exclusionary. If the “dream of the Great American Novel” is “unkillable,” as the scholar Lawrence Buell wrote, it&#39;s because it flows from a desire every bit as utopian as the ones that inspired Rapp and Owen.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Utopia, we know, begins life as fiction. What is less often acknowledged is that every fiction is utopian—and not just because it takes place in the “nowhere” of the imagination. Beneath the critiques of the Great American Novel, one detects a not-too-subtle boast: the American experience is too complex, too diverse, too geographically broad, and too fractious to be captured in a single epic. This is undoubtedly true; at the same time, it misunderstands what the social function of the Great American Novel is. It&#39;s not simply a genre; it&#39;s a tool, meant to help manage in narrative our frustrated desire for perfection. “The dream is never complete,” Vera says. “The dream is always partial even when it is whole.” In America, as in literature, “the dream must suffice.” ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 24 Oct 2023 23:06:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[The Love Letters of David Wojnarowicz]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/the-love-letters-of-david-wojnarowicz]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-24T10:00:00.000Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6532aa3acc1213fa97a824c0/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/ONeill-DJP-Lead-Photo.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;article >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attribute-verso-pattern=&quot;article-body&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;ArticlePageChunks&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;In the fall of 1978, the writer and artist &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/photo-booth/david-wojnarowiczs-still-burning-rage&quot;>;David Wojnarowicz&lt;/a>;, aged twenty-four, arrived in Paris, met a hairdresser named Jean-Pierre Delage, and fell in love. As Wojnarowicz told it, he first saw Delage leaning against the Louvre in the moonlight. Delage remembers it differently, claiming that Wojnarowicz popped out of a bush at the Tuileries Garden, a favorite cruising spot for gay men at the time. (Wojnarowicz was a keen mythologizer, and it&#39;s likely that Delage&#39;s version is closer to the truth.) Within a week, Wojnarowicz had moved into Delage&#39;s apartment near the Eiffel Tower. A photo from around this time shows Wojnarowicz as his lover would have seen him, typing away at his sister&#39;s apartment on the Rue Laferrière, a classic portrait of a bohemian at work. Wojnarowicz didn&#39;t last long in Paris—unable to find work as a soft-skilled English speaker, he went back to New York after nine months—but he and Delage kept up a passionate epistolary romance until 1982.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;By then, Wojnarowicz was on his way to becoming a downtown New York art star. His renegade work in many media—including graffiti-inflected paintings on televisions and DIY papier-mâché—was heady, wild, and trashy, with imagery plucked from dreams as a way of bypassing the deadening conformity of what he called the “pre-invented world.” In the late nineteen-eighties, as his community was devastated by &lt;em >;AIDS&lt;/em>; and artists were demonized by the Christian right, his art took an explicitly political turn. (Wojnarowicz learned that he was HIV-positive in 1988.)&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In our era of algorithms that favor succinct statements of rage, Wojnarowicz&#39;s work has connected with a new generation of activists and artists in part because it is easy to meme. His stencils of burning houses circulate frequently on social media, as does a picture from 1992 or 1993, “Untitled (Face in Dirt),” showing the artist half buried alive, and “One Day This Kid,” from 1990, a print that details a litany of abuse directed toward a queer kid. The American-in-Paris snapshot of Wojnarowicz isn&#39;t what we remember today. It&#39;s another photograph, taken by Bill Dobbs, of the artist protesting at the FDA headquarters, in 1988, wearing a leather jacket with these words painted on the back: “&lt;em >;IF I DIE OF AIDS—FORGET BURIAL—JUST DROP MY BODY ON THE STEPS OF THE FDA&lt;/em>;”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;GenericCallout&quot;>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;A book spread of art work depicting several figures&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6532abee25ccf8a1234d4d7c/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/ONeill-DJP-1.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6532abee25ccf8a1234d4d7c/master/w_120,c_limit/ONeill-DJP-1.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6532abee25ccf8a1234d4d7c/master/w_240,c_limit/ONeill-DJP-1.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6532abee25ccf8a1234d4d7c/master/w_320,c_limit/ONeill-DJP-1.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6532abee25ccf8a1234d4d7c/master/w_640,c_limit/ONeill-DJP-1.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6532abee25ccf8a1234d4d7c/master/w_960,c_limit/ONeill-DJP-1.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6532abee25ccf8a1234d4d7c/master/w_1280,c_limit/ONeill-DJP-1.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6532abee25ccf8a1234d4d7c/master/w_1600,c_limit/ONeill-DJP-1.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;Art work © Estate of David Wojnarowicz / Courtesy Primary Information / Estate of David Wojnarowicz / P·P·O·W&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;The revealing new art book “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/David-Wojnarowicz-Dear-Jean-Pierre/dp/173779795X/&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/David-Wojnarowicz-Dear-Jean-Pierre/dp/173779795X/&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/David-Wojnarowicz-Dear-Jean-Pierre/dp/173779795X/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;Dear Jean Pierre&lt;/a>;” returns us to an earlier Wojnarowicz, before his work and persona became synonymous with the social trauma of &lt;em >;AIDS&lt;/em>;. This volume, edited by James Hoff and published by the indispensable press Primary Information, is based on an intimate and affecting exhibition that was put on by PPOW gallery last spring. The show, curated by Cynthia Carr—author of “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Fire-Belly-Times-David-Wojnarowicz/dp/1608194191/&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Fire-Belly-Times-David-Wojnarowicz/dp/1608194191/&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Fire-Belly-Times-David-Wojnarowicz/dp/1608194191/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;Fire in the Belly&lt;/a>;,” a brilliant 2012 biography of Wojnarowicz—and Anneliis Beadnell, presented the letters, postcards, photographs, and artwork that Wojnarowicz sent to Delage beginning in the summer of 1979.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The correspondence reveals Wojnarowicz as funny, uncertain, insecure, elusive, transgressive, and unexpectedly devoted. In his best-known book, “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Close-Knives-Disintegration-David-Wojnarowicz/dp/0679732276/&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Close-Knives-Disintegration-David-Wojnarowicz/dp/0679732276/&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Close-Knives-Disintegration-David-Wojnarowicz/dp/0679732276/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;Close to the Knives: A Memoir of Disintegration&lt;/a>;,” he writes, “If I could figure out a way to remain forever in transition, in the disconnected and unfamiliar, I could remain in a state of perpetual freedom.” But, as Carr&#39;s biography shows and the letters make vivid, Wojnarowicz&#39;s embrace of the disconnected and the unfamiliar was a way of making the best of a preëxisting condition. His life may have been perpetually transitory, but that wasn&#39;t entirely by choice. In “Fire in the Belly,” Carr carefully pieces together a broken, violent childhood that she characterizes as “almost Dickensian.” Wojnarowicz&#39;s sister, Pat, told Carr that Wojnarowicz&#39;s alcoholic father, an intransigent merchant mariner, used to beat his three children one by one in the basement as the others waited on the lawn, listening to the screams. Wojnarowicz coped by hiding, literally and figuratively, taking solace in writers such as Rimbaud and hustling in Times Square to make money and find fleeting connection.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Wojnarowicz minimized his history of sex, violence, and poverty in his letters, presenting a less complicated version of himself to Delage. The first postcard in “Dear Jean Pierre,” dated June 1, 1979, is a dashed-off and superficially casual note written on Wojnarowicz&#39;s way out of France: “Be well. Try and take it easy—Okay? Au revoir . 。 。 ” The rest of the correspondence from 1979 and 1980 is preoccupied with finding an apartment, making ends meet (working for a week at a piano factory, selling blood on Forty-second Street), and finding a way back to Paris—he wanted dual citizenship but balked at the thought of French compulsory military service.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Reading any unedited, chronological record is, at best, an intermittently blissful experience, and Wojnarowicz&#39;s letters are no exception. The drama of the correspondence is simple and universal. It&#39;s a lover&#39;s discourse with four repeated figures: I miss you, I hope to see you soon, I wish you well, I love you. But if the writing is sometimes flat—Wojnarowicz&#39;s attempt to communicate across a language barrier—the images are always vivid. Wojnarowicz was seduced &lt;em>;by&lt;/em>; and seduced &lt;em>;with&lt;/em>; an assortment of stunning visuals: postcards (some marked up with Wojnarowicz&#39;s brilliant Keith Haring-esque doodles) and photocopies of his own artwork, which he slipped into the envelopes.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Perhaps playing to his French lover, Wojnarowicz seems especially taken with Americana. Among the images he selects for Delage are photos of James Dean and Yankee Stadium, an illustration of the Empire Diner on Tenth Avenue, black-and-white prints of a handsome cowboy, Jim Dine&#39;s watercolor hearts, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/06/08/edward-hopper-and-american-solitude&quot;>;Edward Hopper&lt;/a>;&#39;s masterly portrait of alienation, “Office at Night.” It&#39;s as if Wojnarowicz&#39;s attachment to Jean-Pierre has enabled him to observe his home country, which he had been so eager to leave, with a fresh perspective, finding things to love that he might have taken for granted (diners, cowboys) while also being attuned to the alienation of American life (Hopper).&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;GenericCallout&quot;>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;A book spread depicting a person laying down with a drawing of James Dean on their back and a letter on the other side&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6532abef25ccf8a1234d4d7e/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/ONeill-DJP-3.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6532abef25ccf8a1234d4d7e/master/w_120,c_limit/ONeill-DJP-3.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6532abef25ccf8a1234d4d7e/master/w_240,c_limit/ONeill-DJP-3.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6532abef25ccf8a1234d4d7e/master/w_320,c_limit/ONeill-DJP-3.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6532abef25ccf8a1234d4d7e/master/w_640,c_limit/ONeill-DJP-3.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6532abef25ccf8a1234d4d7e/master/w_960,c_limit/ONeill-DJP-3.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6532abef25ccf8a1234d4d7e/master/w_1280,c_limit/ONeill-DJP-3.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6532abef25ccf8a1234d4d7e/master/w_1600,c_limit/ONeill-DJP-3.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;Art work © Estate of David Wojnarowicz / Courtesy Primary Information / Estate of David Wojnarowicz / P·P·O·W&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;The letters show an artist in the thrall of French Surrealism, art-house cinema, and New Wave music. As the correspondence goes on, a portrait emerges of Wojnarowicz as an autodidact hungry for experience. He spends a night reading Yukio Mishima and eating peanut-butter-and-jelly sandwiches. He sees Larry Clark&#39;s frank photographs of sex, guns, and drugs. He anticipates the conceptual sculptor Joseph Beuys&#39;s notorious US début at the Guggenheim, looks forward to seeing “In the Realm of the Senses” by Nagisa Ōshima, and goes to &lt;em >;MOMA&lt;/em>; to view Man Ray, Rodchenko, and Duchamp. (Wojnarowicz summed up Rodchenko&#39;s photos with one word: “Ah!”) He&#39;s forming his personal canon: spiky, defiant, earnest, and sensual.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;“Dear Jean Pierre” is also a chronicle of compelling omissions. Because the letters are presented largely without editorial comment, it&#39;s helpful to read the book side by side with “Fire in the Belly.” In the biography, Carr writes that in June, 1979, a month of prolific correspondence to Delage, Wojnarowicz discovered the dilapidated piers and abandoned warehouses along the Hudson, where he sunbathed, took films and photographs, cruised, and painted graffiti. This lawless paradise became the heart of Wojnarowicz&#39;s aesthetic and sexual life, but you&#39;d never know it from his letters to Delage from that period, which are focussed on longing and the logistics of a reunion.&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;In later years, Wojnarowicz was increasingly forced to defend his art against the Christian right. In 1990, the American Family Association founder, the Reverend Donald Wildmon, took aim at Wojnarowicz&#39;s exhibition “Tongues of Flame” and mailed a collage of selectively edited sex scenes to members of Congress, the media, and religious leaders, hoping to get the National Endowment for the Arts defunded. Wojnarowicz pointed out that his antagonists were acting like appropriation artists, making “pieces of their own” from his art. But, writing to Delage, Wojnarowicz sees no need to protect himself from political attacks, and he isn&#39;t worried about his art being misunderstood. He casually presents cheerfully depraved pieces—for example, his 1979 Xerox collage of a saintly Jean Genet with Jesus shooting up—without fear or commentary, a form of reserve that reads as an expression of trust. Despite his reticence, Wojnarowicz&#39;s brilliance can be glimpsed in occasional shards of shining prose. In October, 1979, he wrote, “There is much news on the radio about the Pope on 5th Avenue. Many people are excited. Meanwhile, the nuclear plants in America are spilling [radioactive] waste,” a fragment that presages the expressive adjacencies of Wojnarowicz&#39;s mid-nineteen-eighties collagist cut-and-paste paintings.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;f6dzik&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Wojnarowicz&#39;s first break came in the summer of 1980, when &lt;em>;SoHo News&lt;/em>; published a centerfold of his photographic series “Rimbaud in New York.” The series was inspired by the artist Ernest Pignon-Ernest&#39;s life-size wheat-pasted posters of Rimbaud in street clothes, which Wojnarowicz likely saw with Delage in Paris. In the photographs, his friends wear a mask of the poet as they pose throughout New York City, in decrepit warehouses by the piers, butcher shops, and subway cars, sometimes injecting drugs or masturbating.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Dear Jean Pierre” makes the full context of the images clear, giving the series new depth. The photographs testify to Wojnarowicz&#39;s intense cathexis of Rimbaud, and his lifelong methodology of the self as other—a notion cribbed from the French poet&#39;s classic teen line “Je est un autre.” But reading the letters alongside these images shows that they&#39;re about more than Wojnarowicz&#39;s desire to be notorious and disguised. They also commemorate his yearning for his absent lover, who appeared behind the mask in a few Rimbaud photos taken during a brief visit to New York.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Those reunions were infrequent, and, by 1981, the strain on their relationship had begun to show. Wojnarowicz&#39;s art and his life both changed dramatically that year. He met his friend and mentor &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/02/05/the-bohemian-rhapsody-of-peter-hujar&quot;>;Peter Hujar&lt;/a>;, a downtown photographer once affiliated with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/06/08/untangling-andy-warhol&quot;>;Warhol&lt;/a>;&#39;s Factory. Hujar and Wojnarowicz began a largely chaste love affair that would last until Hujar&#39;s death from &lt;em >;AIDS&lt;/em>; in 1987. True to form, Wojnarowicz masks, or at least downplays, this momentous meeting in his letters to Delage. On January 5, 1981, he reported: “Spent the night talking with a new friend about life / photos etc.—rare that I have chance to just talk and listen to interesting things.” Hujar also takes portraits of Wojnarowicz that open his subject up. Wojnarowicz wrote to Delage in August, 1981, “I looked at the photos he made and was surprised: they are very beautiful—I never saw myself like this before.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;As Wojnarowicz got closer to Hujar and deeper into his art, the tone of the conversation with Jean-Pierre began to sound more mournful, and doubt crept in. In January, 1982, he wrote, “Please be patient with me.” There are no letters from March 18th to June, 1982, included in the volume. According to Carr&#39;s biography, Delage slept with one of Wojnarowicz&#39;s friends in Paris around this time. “Dear Jean Pierre” contains Wojnarowicz&#39;s hurt reaction in one of the last letters in the collection: “I can not think about living with you at this time. I need to solve my problems with my work and my life.” The problems with work, at least, were good ones to have: on June 11, 1982, Wojnarowicz appeared in a group show at the Alexander Milliken Gallery on Prince Street with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/07/08/basquiats-memorial-to-a-young-artist-killed-by-police&quot;>;Jean-Michel Basquiat&lt;/a>;, Francesco Clemente, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-new-yorker-interview/a-tour-of-david-hockneys-newest-painting-series&quot;>;David Hockney&lt;/a>;, and other art stars, which led to his first solo show in December of that year.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;This pre-&lt;em >;AIDS&lt;/em>; arcadia didn&#39;t last. Four months after that solo show, and right around the time that “Dear Jean Pierre” closes, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/postscript/the-benevolent-rage-of-larry-kramer&quot;>;Larry Kramer&lt;/a>; published “1,112 and Counting,” the first clarion warning: “Why isn&#39;t every gay man in this city so scared shitless that he is screaming for action? Does every gay man in New York want to die?” The lone, oblique reference to the epidemic in the correspondence appears in a coda to “Dear Jean Pierre” from September, 1991, nine months before Wojnarowicz&#39;s death. By that time, he had been largely consumed by the political and medical emergency of &lt;em >;AIDS&lt;/em>;. He sent Jean-Pierre a card, a dispatch from a different world, referring to “a lot of different illnesses.” He wrote, “I don&#39;t have much energy. I take a walk every day if I can. It&#39;s difficult inside my head—I wish I could get a reprieve from these sensations and isolation.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Wojnarowicz found reprieve in art and activism, but a comment he made to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/04/09/zoe-leonards-radical-evidence-of-the-overlooked&quot;>;Zoe Leonard&lt;/a>; in 1989 suggests the trajectory that he could have taken in a better world. As Carr recounts in “Fire in the Belly,” Leonard asked Wojnarowicz to look at her aerial photographs, dreamy black-and-white images of feathery clouds. She was worried that the work was at odds with her activism around the &lt;em >;AIDS&lt;/em>; crisis. Wojnarowicz told her not to worry: “We&#39;re being angry and complaining because we have to, but where we want to go is back to beauty.” Of course, there&#39;s beauty in Wojnarowicz&#39;s political art, a quality deepened by seeing the artist in love in “Dear Jean Pierre.” The book is yet another monument to the incalculable lost potential of the &lt;em >;AIDS&lt;/em>; epidemic. But it&#39;s also a joyful reclamation of an epoch of discovery in Wojnarowicz&#39;s art—and in the lives of its subjects, who, it is clear, were deeply affected by their time together. Speaking to a reporter &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/05/arts/design/wojnarowicz-ppow-gallery-art-delage.html&quot;>;about the PPOW exhibition&lt;/a>;, Delage said of his Wojnarowicz archive, “I keep it like sacred things.”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;GenericCallout&quot;>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;A book spread depicting a person laying down smoking and a letter on the other side&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6532abef30b98718fda59f9c/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/ONeill-DJP-2.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6532abef30b98718fda59f9c/master/w_120,c_limit/ONeill-DJP-2.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6532abef30b98718fda59f9c/master/w_240,c_limit/ONeill-DJP-2.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6532abef30b98718fda59f9c/master/w_320,c_limit/ONeill-DJP-2.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6532abef30b98718fda59f9c/master/w_640,c_limit/ONeill-DJP-2.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6532abef30b98718fda59f9c/master/w_960,c_limit/ONeill-DJP-2.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6532abef30b98718fda59f9c/master/w_1280,c_limit/ONeill-DJP-2.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6532abef30b98718fda59f9c/master/w_1600,c_limit/ONeill-DJP-2.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;Art work © Estate of David Wojnarowicz / Courtesy Primary Information / Estate of David Wojnarowicz / P·P·O·W&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 24 Oct 2023 19:06:05 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Getting Things Done Together]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.newyorker.com/culture/office-space/getting-things-done-together]]><description>&lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-24T10:00:00.000Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6536cbe40842a9f0d0a3dca7/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/3.%20Still-option-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;article >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attribute-verso-pattern=&quot;article-body&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;ArticlePageChunks&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;A few years ago, advertisements for a software service named Monday.com seemed to be suddenly everywhere online. This ubiquity didn&#39;t come cheap. An SEC filing revealed that the product&#39;s developers had spent close to a hundred and thirty million dollars on advertising in 2020 alone, which amounted to roughly eighty per cent of the company&#39;s annual revenue. The resulting blitz generated more than seven hundred and twenty-two million views on Monday.com&#39;s YouTube channel—an audience larger than the preceding four Super Bowls combined.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;This outsized investment makes sense when you consider the changes that have taken place in the productivity-software market. Monday.com claims to help knowledge workers collaborate better: “Boost your team&#39;s alignment, efficiency, and productivity by customizing any workflow to fit your needs.” This objective might sound dry in our current moment of flashy social apps and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/science/annals-of-artificial-intelligence/can-we-stop-the-singularity&quot;>;eerie artificial intelligence&lt;/a>;, but helping organizations manage their workflows has proved to be surprisingly lucrative. Trello, one of the early success stories from this category, was launched in 2011 as a side project by an independent software developer. In 2017, it was purchased by Atlassian for four hundred and twenty-five million in cash and stock. Another workflow-management service, named Wrike, subsequently sold for $2.25 billion. For its part, Monday.com went on to leverage the user growth generated by its advertising push to support a successful IPO that valued the company at over seven billion dollars.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;What&#39;s striking about this new generation of productivity software is not so much what it does, but what it doesn&#39;t do. Until recently, most business applications focussed on providing faster and more powerful versions of the tools that knowledge workers were already using to accomplish their daily tasks—electronic spreadsheets were better than paper accounting ledgers, e-mail is better than fax machines. The new productivity services, by contrast, can&#39;t be used to directly execute work. Their purpose is instead to help better &lt;em>;organize&lt;/em>; these efforts. Monday.com allows you to arrange “items,” described by various properties such as “status” or “percentage complete,” onto “boards.” You can then visualize the work described by these boards in various useful formats. Trello offers something similar, capturing items on virtual cards that can be dragged around into different vertical stacks. One stack might contain the tasks a team still needs to handle, while another might contain those already accomplished.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;To understand the importance of this shift from work to workflow, it helps to understand two competing philosophies about how technology impacts productivity. The first argues that technology improves productivity by directly improving the tools that we work with—the waterwheel, the electric motor, and so on. A less-discussed but equally important philosophy broadens the definition of technology to include the more general systems by which work is organized. It argues that some of the biggest productivity breakthroughs come not from better tools but instead from smarter ways of arranging what you&#39;re already doing. A canonical example is Henry Ford&#39;s continuous-motion assembly line, developed at his automobile factory in Highland Park, Michigan. The assembly line was a productivity miracle, decreasing the worker hours required to produce a Model T by nearly a factor of ten. Its effectiveness, however, had less to do with ingenious new inventions than it did with an ingenious new insight about how to rearrange the manufacturing process: bringing the car to the worker instead of the worker to the car. “Be ready to revise any system, scrap any method, abandon any theory, if the success of the job requires it,” Ford explained.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;The change of focus in the business-software space from tools toward process-based productivity can be explained, in part, by the acknowledgment that the existing strategy of making applications increasingly powerful has stopped making us better at our jobs. During the past two decades or so—a period of rapid technology innovation, which produced laptops, smartphones, ubiquitous cloud computing, and Google—American productivity growth has suffered a sustained slowdown. We gained access to an armada of supercharged workplace tools, and yet we&#39;re not getting much more done.&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;There are many explanations for this paradox, including, notably, the theory that these tools counterbalanced new capabilities with new distractions. (E-mail is faster than a fax machine, but its spread also created a world in which we end up &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/was-e-mail-a-mistake&quot;>;checking our in-boxes constantly&lt;/a>;.) Regardless of specific causes, what is clear is that this general failure of new technology to deliver results in the workplace presents a problem for software developers. If employers no longer believe that these products are significantly boosting their employees&#39; productivity, they&#39;ll no longer pay top dollar to keep up with the latest versions. In the nineteen-nineties, Microsoft made a fortune from companies willing to invest in expensive standalone releases of their densely featured Office productivity software. Today, these same companies, less enamored with such tools&#39; productive potential, might instead settle for cheaper online variants. Why spend two hundred and forty-nine dollars for a single copy of Microsoft Office 2021 when business subscriptions to Google&#39;s Web-based workplace tools start at six dollars per user? (Perhaps reacting to these pressures, Microsoft now offers a free Web-based version of its once vaunted Office software.)&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In this context, the move in business software toward process productivity comes across as a reasonable strategy. It presents a new and exciting pitch for the professional market—“It&#39;s not the tools that matter, it&#39;s the process!”—and new and exciting pitches are often better able to attract significant investment. If Microsoft Word was the waterwheel, in other words, maybe Monday.com can be the assembly line. This development should be received as good news. The process-centric philosophy of productivity had been largely missing from the world of office work. Whereas other economic sectors have long cared a lot about how effort is organized, knowledge-work managers, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/office-space/the-frustration-with-productivity-culture&quot;>;for a combination of historically contingent reasons&lt;/a>;, have traditionally left these details up to individuals. It wasn&#39;t until the rapid expansion of the knowledge economy in the second half of the twentieth century that productivity suddenly became personal.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;This myopia is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/the-rise-and-fall-of-getting-things-done&quot;>;mistake&lt;/a>;. Keeping productivity as an individual obligation, and focussing only on offering increasingly powerful tools, didn&#39;t lead to a more efficient and relaxing workday, but instead enabled us to take on even more tasks, pursued with even more frantic intensity. It doesn&#39;t have to be this way. More structured rules for determining who should be working on what, and how collaboration should best be organized, could walk us back from our current moment of always-on overload.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;It&#39;s here that the rise of process-centric productivity software might generate its most lasting impact. If tools like Monday.com, Trello, and Wrike continue to spread, they will carry in their wake an emphasis on the importance of process productivity. Whether or not these particular applications stick, this new mind-set might, and if it does, it would be a welcome transformation for a knowledge sector exhausted by the focus on tools over systems. These well-funded software companies, competing aggressively to become the next Microsoft, might just provide the strong push needed for the managerial class to realize that there&#39;s more to productivity than simply giving their employees the latest spreadsheet and messenger software. It&#39;s in rethinking how we organize our work, not just in how fast we can accomplish it, where the real improvements are to be found. Perhaps we&#39;re finally ready to learn this reality. ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;muajqj&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot;

It is January, 2008, and the New Hampshire primary is just days away. Romney, a candidate for the Republican Presidential nomination, sits in a high-backed chair, clad in his usual armor: a navy-blue tie, a gleaming white shirt with cufflinks, and dress pants. His wife, Ann, is seated next to him; two of his sons and a daughter-in-law are arrayed around them. Romney&#39;s campaign is going poorly. He lost badly to Mike Huckabee, the former Arkansas governor, in the Iowa caucuses, and in New Hampshire he appears on track to lose again, this time to Senator John McCain. “Maybe you just wait a few years?” one of Romney&#39;s sons suggests. Romney seems to dismiss the possibility. “When this is over, I&#39;ll have built a brand name,” he says. “People will know me.

Later, the clan kneels on the floor to pray. Romney bows his head, his elbows resting on the chair. In her prayer, Ann thanks God for His blessings and says that the family desires only to “serve Thee and to bring greater light to this earth.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;This moment, captured in the 2014 documentary “Mitt,” encapsulates the enduring paradox of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tag/mitt-romney&quot;>;Mitt Romney&lt;/a>;. After serving as a moderate governor in Massachusetts, where his signature accomplishment was enacting universal health care, he went through an ideological and tonal makeover as he labored, during two failed Presidential campaigns, to navigate the rightward lurch of his party. He never shed the aspersion that he was a flip-flopper, a man lacking true conviction. During a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/republican-presidential-candidates-debate-manchester-new-hampshire&quot;>;Republican candidate forum&lt;/a>; in New Hampshire, in 2008, McCain turned to Romney and said, “We disagree on a lot of issues, but I agree you are the candidate of change.” On the hustings, Romney often came across as starched and stiff, like his crisply ironed dress shirts. Voters struggled to get a genuine sense of him. And yet his core has always been evident to those granted entrée to his world. It was evident in that New Hampshire hotel room, and it&#39;s evident throughout McKay Coppins&#39;s instructive new biography, “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Romney-Reckoning-McKay-Coppins/dp/1982196203&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Romney-Reckoning-McKay-Coppins/dp/1982196203&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Romney-Reckoning-McKay-Coppins/dp/1982196203&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;Romney: A Reckoning&lt;/a>;,” in which the politician&#39;s Mormon faith emerges as the substrate that nourishes all else in his life.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;GenericCallout&quot;>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;external-link-embed--inline&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;a aria-label=&quot;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;The Best Books We Read This Week&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.newyorker.com/best-books-2023&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/best-books-2023&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;&lt;span >;&lt;strong>;The Best Books We Read This Week&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/a>;&lt;p >;&lt;em>;Read our reviews of notable new fiction and nonfiction, updated every Wednesday.&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;a aria-label=&quot;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;The Best Books We Read This Week&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.newyorker.com/best-books-2023&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/best-books-2023&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/63c800e4e99d89b838ada996/1:1/w_200%2Cc_limit/undefined&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/63c800e4e99d89b838ada996/1:1/w_120,c_limit/undefined 120w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/a>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;It is no accident that both Coppins and Greg Whiteley, the director of “Mitt,” are fellow-members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Coppins relies on dozens of interviews with Romney, as well as hundreds of pages of personal journals and private correspondence, to narrate Romney&#39;s interior journey as his ambitions and principles increasingly come into conflict. The result is a rare feat in modern-day political reporting: an account in which the subject engages in actual introspection. Romney spent years contorting himself for the hard-right elements in his party, eventually becoming the GOP&#39;s standard-bearer during the 2012 election. In interviews, he spoke about the rationalizations he&#39;d made over the years and his “capacity for self-justification,” as Coppins puts it. But when Donald Trump &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/an-american-tragedy-remnick-trump-wins-presidency-2016&quot;>;won the Presidency&lt;/a>;––the moment of “reckoning” in the book&#39;s title––Romney decided to fling himself into the fray. The forces of populism and outrage had already overtaken the Republican Party. The question was whether Romney could find redemption for himself.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The Epistle of James admonishes believers to be “doers of the word, not just hearers.” Without “works,” the epistle explains, faith is empty. The manner in which faith becomes works in politics, however, can be like an intricate knot, with many folds. Black evangelicals and white evangelicals share theological beliefs but diverge on their partisan affiliations. There is a rich social-justice tradition in Roman Catholicism, yet many conservative Catholics are foot soldiers of the right. Religion offers a compass but not a map. Universal health care? Balancing the budget? Protecting the border? The Scriptures and other religious texts are silent. One can identify broad principles––and sometimes even these are contradictory––but specific policies must emerge from human wisdom and processes.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Romney&#39;s process came from another deeply rooted identity: the data-driven businessman. In the nineteen-seventies, after graduating with joint MBA and law degrees from Harvard, Romney began working in the burgeoning field of management consulting. He eventually landed at Bain &amp;amp; Company, where he quickly became a star. Bain&#39;s leaders put him in charge of a new investment firm, Bain Capital, which identified ailing companies to invest in, overhauled them from within, then sold them for profit. The firm made Romney fabulously wealthy and helped to launch his political career. It also shaped his governing in Massachusetts, where he saw himself primarily as a “partisan of pragmatism,” not an ideologue. His approach to the health-care issue was illustrative. “I don&#39;t look and say, &#39;What&#39;s the conservative point of view on this?&#39; ” he told Coppins. “I ask, &#39;What do I think is the right answer to a particular problem?&#39; ” When Romney began considering a run for the Presidency, pitching himself to conservative audiences, he had a new set of data points to consider. He remade himself into a crusader on social issues; a lifelong hunter, even though he had gone hunting only twice in his life; and a zealot on illegal immigration. Romney thought little about the authenticity of his new persona. “It was a matter of simple math,” Coppins writes.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Even as Romney was remaking himself on the stump, his faith remained an abiding presence. Evangelical Christians, a crucial voting bloc in Republican primaries, consider Mormonism to be a heresy. Some of Romney&#39;s supporters suggested that he distance himself from his faith. Romney declined. According to Coppins, it was perhaps the &lt;em>;only&lt;/em>; part of his life that he refused to compromise on. He prayed on buses and before debates, read the Scriptures daily, and avoided scheduling campaign events on the Sabbath. Romney even arranged for the Church&#39;s Boston temple to hold a late-night session for him and his family, an unusual accommodation. “Romney craved the closeness to God he experienced during those sacred worship ceremonies,” Coppins writes. “Swapping his presidential-candidate costume for the simple white clothing of the temple that night, he felt fully, truly like himself.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Perhaps the most stirring moment in Romney&#39;s campaign came on December 6, 2007, when Romney decided to address concerns about his faith directly, in a speech at the George HW Bush Presidential Library and Museum, in College Station, Texas. “I believe in my Mormon faith and I endeavor to live by it,” he said. “Some believe that such a confession of my faith will sink my candidacy. If they are right, so be it. But I think they underestimate the American people. Americans do not respect believers of convenience. Americans tire of those who would jettison their beliefs, even to gain the world.” Two months later, Romney&#39;s campaign was over.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;When it came time to decide whether to enter the 2012 Presidential campaign, Romney was conflicted. The press generally considered him the Republican front-runner, but most of his family opposed another bid. The right was undergoing a transformation. The Obama Presidency had helped to incite the anti-establishment Tea Party movement, and the GOP&#39;s restive, grievance-fuelled grass roots didn&#39;t seem particularly hospitable to a patrician figure like Romney. He was also resolved to avoid the contortions of 2008. “Of course, I would want to win, but feeling that I have been true to what I believe is even more important,” Romney wrote in an e-mail to advisers.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The campaign decided to relentlessly focus on the economy; Romney had always been most comfortable making his case as a turnaround specialist. But, in Coppins&#39;s telling, Romney&#39;s advisers continued to nudge him to tend to the far right. His rhetoric on immigration verged on nativist; during one Republican debate, he suggested “self-deportation” for undocumented immigrants. He also sought the endorsement of Trump, who had spent months stoking baseless conspiracy theories about Obama&#39;s birthplace. Romney captured the nomination but was trounced by Obama in the election. That night, when one of his advisers raised the prospect of yet another campaign, he insisted, “My time on the stage is over, guys.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Romney first encounters Donald Trump in the fourth chapter of Coppins&#39;s book. It is 1995, and Trump has invited Romney to spend the weekend at his extravagant estate at Mar-a-Lago. According to Coppins, Romney found the experience “deeply weird,” and figured he would never see Trump again. The magnate&#39;s rise in the polls, during the 2016 nominating contest, befuddled him. He and Ann watched Trump&#39;s rallies, where the spectre of violence seemed omnipresent. “Those people weren&#39;t at our events,” Ann said. When it became clear that Trump might win the Republican nomination, Romney scrambled to stop him, delivering a speech denouncing him as “a phony, a fraud,” and later working behind the scenes to send the nomination to the convention. He had predicted to friends that Trump would win the election. Even so, he was unprepared when it happened.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Yet Romney&#39;s resistance to Trump did not proceed in a straight line. He famously flirted with joining the Trump Administration as Secretary of State. When a photo of the two men meeting over dinner at Jean-Georges, the lavish restaurant inside the Trump International Hotel and Tower in New York, went viral, the flip-flopper memes returned. In the orange-and-yellow-hued image, Trump appears to be almost cackling; Romney looks chagrined, his eyebrows raised and his lips drawn together. He later insisted to Coppins that his expression had nothing to do with Trump. “It had to do with the awkwardness of being in a public restaurant and cameras coming and taking pictures,” he said. After the dinner, he told reporters that he had “increasing hope that president-elect Trump is the very man who can lead us to a better future.” According to Coppins, Trump called Romney and told him that he needed to come out with a stronger statement: Trump was “terrific” and would be a “great president.” Romney could suffer the pretense no longer. “Maybe after so many years of allowing the petty indignities and moral compromises to pile up, he had finally reached his limit,” Coppins writes.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Coppins details Romney&#39;s growing alarm during Trump&#39;s first few months in office: the travel ban; the exodus from the State Department; the statement, after a white-nationalist rally in Charlottesville, that there were “very fine people on both sides.” At one point, Romney jotted down a line from William Butler Yeats&#39;s poem “The Second Coming,” written after the First World War: “The best lack all conviction, while the worst / Are full of passionate intensity.” This was the new Republican Party, in Romney&#39;s mind. In the fall of 2017, he decided to return to politics, running for a Senate seat in Utah. “Money is motivating when you don&#39;t have it and when you are young,” he wrote in his journal. “A purpose greater than self is what motivates now.” That purpose was to become a counterweight to Trump.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In the Senate, Romney seemed to grow in stature and fortitude. Gone was the caution that had paralyzed him during his Presidential bids. He became one of the few in his party willing to criticize Trump&#39;s excesses. On December 18, 2019, the House &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/trumps-impeachment-and-impeachment-lite&quot;>;voted to impeach&lt;/a>; the President over allegations that he&#39;d withheld military aid from Ukraine in order to pressure its President, Volodymyr Zelensky, into launching investigations that would benefit Trump politically. Preparing for the Senate trial, Romney studied Federalist No. 65, in which Alexander Hamilton argues that the Senate is the only institution with sufficient independence to handle a trial with “necessary impartiality.” The trial lasted just five days.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Romney was frustrated by his Republican colleagues. “How unlike a real jury is our caucus?” he wrote in his journal. One evening, after the Senate had recessed, Romney returned to his office, knelt on the floor, and prayed. Later, he listed in his journal the potential consequences of voting to convict Trump: he would be ostracized in the Senate; Fox News would tear into him, “stoking up the crazies”; the President would attack him mercilessly, or use the government to hurt his sons; Romney might need to move from Utah. That night, at his town house in Washington, he slept poorly, waking before dawn to review the case again. In his office, he convened his staff and told them that he had reached a verdict.&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;On February 5, 2020, Romney stood at the lectern in the Senate chamber to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/mitt-romneys-act-of-political-courage&quot;>;explain his decision&lt;/a>; to become the first senator in American history to vote to remove a President from his own party. “As a Senator-juror, I swore an oath, before God, to exercise &#39;impartial justice,&#39; ” he said. “I am profoundly religious. My faith is at the heart of who I am.” Here, Romney paused for several seconds, his eyes downcast, seemingly overcome. “I take an oath before God as enormously consequential,” he went on. Disregarding that oath for a partisan end, he said, would expose his character to “the censure of my own conscience.” He acknowledged that many in his party and his state would disagree with the decision. He also acknowledged that his vote would not remove Trump from office. “I will tell my children and their children that I did my duty to the best of my ability,” he said, “believing that my country expected it of me.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;After the speech, Romney reached Ann by phone. She described watching his address as a spiritual experience. In the days that followed, as vitriol rained down on Romney, he thought of Parley Parker Pratt, an early Mormon missionary and a distant ancestor, who had toiled for months in New York City without winning any converts, but who one day received a vision of assurance from the Lord—that his labor had not been in vain, that his sacrifice had been accepted. Romney wrote in his journal that a huge weight had been lifted, that “the anxiety is gone.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In the spring of 2021, Coppins and Romney began meeting weekly, in secret, for interviews that sometimes went on for hours. Several months had passed since the January 6th insurrection, and Coppins writes that Romney “often sounded like a spy behind enemy lines.” Romney confided that much of his party “really doesn&#39;t believe in the Constitution.” He was mulling difficult questions, including his own culpability in what had become of the GOP: “Was the rot on the right new, or was it something very old just now bubbling to the surface? And what role had the members of the mainstream establishment––people like him, the &lt;em>;reasonable&lt;/em>; Republicans––played in allowing that rot to fester?”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Last month, Romney announced, at the age of seventy-six, that he would not seek reëlection in the Senate. He cited his age in his decision, declaring that it was time for a new generation of leaders. According to Coppins, Romney has had recurring premonitions of his death. His church teaches him that, one day, he will stand before God and face an accounting, for his thoughts, words, and works. He will have to explain his time in politics––the positions he took, the compromises he made, where he chose to stand firm. If Romney is at a loss, he might bring along Coppins&#39;s record of his reckoning. ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;u1vooj&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;s0typq&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 24 Oct 2023 08:06:01 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Did Mitt Romney Save His Soul?]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/11/06/did-mitt-romney-save-his-soul]]><description>&lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-23T20:51:26.731Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653687a791891e12fe97d3b6/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Luo-Romney.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;article >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attribute-verso-pattern=&quot;article-body&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;ArticlePageChunks&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Mitt Romney and his family are gathered inside a budget hotel room. It is January, 2008, and the New Hampshire primary is just days away. Romney, a candidate for the Republican Presidential nomination, sits in a high-backed chair, clad in his usual armor: a navy-blue tie, a gleaming white shirt with cufflinks, and dress pants. His wife, Ann, is seated next to him; two of his sons and a daughter-in-law are arrayed around them. Romney&#39;s campaign is going poorly. He lost badly to Mike Huckabee, the former Arkansas governor, in the Iowa caucuses, and in New Hampshire he appears on track to lose again, this time to Senator John McCain. “Maybe you just wait a few years?” one of Romney&#39;s sons suggests. Romney seems to dismiss the possibility. “When this is over, I&#39;ll have built a brand name,” he says. “People will know me. They&#39;ll know what I stand for.” He pauses. “The flippin&#39; Mormon,” he says, his face broadening into a half smile. There are some titters from his family, more deflated than amused. Later, the clan kneels on the floor to pray. Romney bows his head, his elbows resting on the chair. In her prayer, Ann thanks God for His blessings and says that the family desires only to “serve Thee and to bring greater light to this earth.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;This moment, captured in the 2014 documentary “Mitt,” encapsulates the enduring paradox of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tag/mitt-romney&quot;>;Mitt Romney&lt;/a>;.

The question was whether Romney could find redemption for himself.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The Epistle of James admonishes believers to be “doers of the word, not just hearers.” Without “works,” the epistle explains, faith is empty. The manner in which faith becomes works in politics, however, can be like an intricate knot, with many folds. Black evangelicals and white evangelicals share theological beliefs but diverge on their partisan affiliations. There is a rich social-justice tradition in Roman Catholicism, yet many conservative Catholics are foot soldiers of the right. Religion offers a compass but not a map. Universal health care? Balancing the budget? Protecting the border? The Scriptures and other religious texts are silent. One can identify broad principles––and sometimes even these are contradictory––but specific policies must emerge from human wisdom and processes.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Romney&#39;s process came from another deeply rooted identity: the data-driven businessman. In the nineteen-seventies, after graduating with joint MBA and law degrees from Harvard, Romney began working in the burgeoning field of management consulting. He eventually landed at Bain &amp;amp; Company, where he quickly became a star. Bain&#39;s leaders put him in charge of a new investment firm, Bain Capital, which identified ailing companies to invest in, overhauled them from within, then sold them for profit. The firm made Romney fabulously wealthy and helped to launch his political career. It also shaped his governing in Massachusetts, where he saw himself primarily as a “partisan of pragmatism,” not an ideologue. His approach to the health-care issue was illustrative. “I don&#39;t look and say, &#39;What&#39;s the conservative point of view on this?&#39; ” he told Coppins. “I ask, &#39;What do I think is the right answer to a particular problem?&#39; ” When Romney began considering a run for the Presidency, pitching himself to conservative audiences, he had a new set of data points to consider. He remade himself into a crusader on social issues; a lifelong hunter, even though he had gone hunting only twice in his life; and a zealot on illegal immigration. Romney thought little about the authenticity of his new persona. “It was a matter of simple math,” Coppins writes.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Even as Romney was remaking himself on the stump, his faith remained an abiding presence. Evangelical Christians, a crucial voting bloc in Republican primaries, consider Mormonism to be a heresy. Some of Romney&#39;s supporters suggested that he distance himself from his faith. Romney declined. According to Coppins, it was perhaps the &lt;em>;only&lt;/em>; part of his life that he refused to compromise on. He prayed on buses and before debates, read the Scriptures daily, and avoided scheduling campaign events on the Sabbath. Romney even arranged for the Church&#39;s Boston temple to hold a late-night session for him and his family, an unusual accommodation. “Romney craved the closeness to God he experienced during those sacred worship ceremonies,” Coppins writes. “Swapping his presidential-candidate costume for the simple white clothing of the temple that night, he felt fully, truly like himself.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Perhaps the most stirring moment in Romney&#39;s campaign came on December 6, 2007, when Romney decided to address concerns about his faith directly, in a speech at the George HW Bush Presidential Library and Museum, in College Station, Texas. “I believe in my Mormon faith and I endeavor to live by it,” he said. “Some believe that such a confession of my faith will sink my candidacy. If they are right, so be it. But I think they underestimate the American people. Americans do not respect believers of convenience. Americans tire of those who would jettison their beliefs, even to gain the world.” Two months later, Romney&#39;s campaign was over.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;When it came time to decide whether to enter the 2012 Presidential campaign, Romney was conflicted. The press generally considered him the Republican front-runner, but most of his family opposed another bid. The right was undergoing a transformation. The Obama Presidency had helped to incite the anti-establishment Tea Party movement, and the GOP&#39;s restive, grievance-fuelled grass roots didn&#39;t seem particularly hospitable to a patrician figure like Romney. He was also resolved to avoid the contortions of 2008. “Of course, I would want to win, but feeling that I have been true to what I believe is even more important,” Romney wrote in an e-mail to advisers.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The campaign decided to relentlessly focus on the economy; Romney had always been most comfortable making his case as a turnaround specialist. But, in Coppins&#39;s telling, Romney&#39;s advisers continued to nudge him to tend to the far right. His rhetoric on immigration verged on nativist; during one Republican debate, he suggested “self-deportation” for undocumented immigrants. He also sought the endorsement of Trump, who had spent months stoking baseless conspiracy theories about Obama&#39;s birthplace. Romney captured the nomination but was trounced by Obama in the election. That night, when one of his advisers raised the prospect of yet another campaign, he insisted, “My time on the stage is over, guys.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Romney first encounters Donald Trump in the fourth chapter of Coppins&#39;s book. It is 1995, and Trump has invited Romney to spend the weekend at his extravagant estate at Mar-a-Lago. According to Coppins, Romney found the experience “deeply weird,” and figured he would never see Trump again. The magnate&#39;s rise in the polls, during the 2016 nominating contest, befuddled him. He and Ann watched Trump&#39;s rallies, where the spectre of violence seemed omnipresent. “Those people weren&#39;t at our events,” Ann said. When it became clear that Trump might win the Republican nomination, Romney scrambled to stop him, delivering a speech denouncing him as “a phony, a fraud,” and later working behind the scenes to send the nomination to the convention. He had predicted to friends that Trump would win the election. Even so, he was unprepared when it happened.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Yet Romney&#39;s resistance to Trump did not proceed in a straight line. He famously flirted with joining the Trump Administration as Secretary of State. When a photo of the two men meeting over dinner at Jean-Georges, the lavish restaurant inside the Trump International Hotel and Tower in New York, went viral, the flip-flopper memes returned. In the orange-and-yellow-hued image, Trump appears to be almost cackling; Romney looks chagrined, his eyebrows raised and his lips drawn together. He later insisted to Coppins that his expression had nothing to do with Trump. “It had to do with the awkwardness of being in a public restaurant and cameras coming and taking pictures,” he said. After the dinner, he told reporters that he had “increasing hope that president-elect Trump is the very man who can lead us to a better future.” According to Coppins, Trump called Romney and told him that he needed to come out with a stronger statement: Trump was “terrific” and would be a “great president.” Romney could suffer the pretense no longer. “Maybe after so many years of allowing the petty indignities and moral compromises to pile up, he had finally reached his limit,” Coppins writes.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Coppins details Romney&#39;s growing alarm during Trump&#39;s first few months in office: the travel ban; the exodus from the State Department; the statement, after a white-nationalist rally in Charlottesville, that there were “very fine people on both sides.” At one point, Romney jotted down a line from William Butler Yeats&#39;s poem “The Second Coming,” written after the First World War: “The best lack all conviction, while the worst / Are full of passionate intensity.” This was the new Republican Party, in Romney&#39;s mind. In the fall of 2017, he decided to return to politics, running for a Senate seat in Utah. “Money is motivating when you don&#39;t have it and when you are young,” he wrote in his journal. “A purpose greater than self is what motivates now.” That purpose was to become a counterweight to Trump.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In the Senate, Romney seemed to grow in stature and fortitude. Gone was the caution that had paralyzed him during his Presidential bids. He became one of the few in his party willing to criticize Trump&#39;s excesses. On December 18, 2019, the House &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/trumps-impeachment-and-impeachment-lite&quot;>;voted to impeach&lt;/a>; the President over allegations that he&#39;d withheld military aid from Ukraine in order to pressure its President, Volodymyr Zelensky, into launching investigations that would benefit Trump politically. Preparing for the Senate trial, Romney studied Federalist No. 65, in which Alexander Hamilton argues that the Senate is the only institution with sufficient independence to handle a trial with “necessary impartiality.” The trial lasted just five days.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Romney was frustrated by his Republican colleagues. “How unlike a real jury is our caucus?” he wrote in his journal. One evening, after the Senate had recessed, Romney returned to his office, knelt on the floor, and prayed. Later, he listed in his journal the potential consequences of voting to convict Trump: he would be ostracized in the Senate; Fox News would tear into him, “stoking up the crazies”; the President would attack him mercilessly, or use the government to hurt his sons; Romney might need to move from Utah. That night, at his town house in Washington, he slept poorly, waking before dawn to review the case again. In his office, he convened his staff and told them that he had reached a verdict.&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;On February 5, 2020, Romney stood at the lectern in the Senate chamber to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/mitt-romneys-act-of-political-courage&quot;>;explain his decision&lt;/a>; to become the first senator in American history to vote to remove a President from his own party. “As a Senator-juror, I swore an oath, before God, to exercise &#39;impartial justice,&#39; ” he said. “I am profoundly religious. My faith is at the heart of who I am.” Here, Romney paused for several seconds, his eyes downcast, seemingly overcome. “I take an oath before God as enormously consequential,” he went on. Disregarding that oath for a partisan end, he said, would expose his character to “the censure of my own conscience.” He acknowledged that many in his party and his state would disagree with the decision. He also acknowledged that his vote would not remove Trump from office. “I will tell my children and their children that I did my duty to the best of my ability,” he said, “believing that my country expected it of me.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;After the speech, Romney reached Ann by phone. She described watching his address as a spiritual experience. In the days that followed, as vitriol rained down on Romney, he thought of Parley Parker Pratt, an early Mormon missionary and a distant ancestor, who had toiled for months in New York City without winning any converts, but who one day received a vision of assurance from the Lord—that his labor had not been in vain, that his sacrifice had been accepted. Romney wrote in his journal that a huge weight had been lifted, that “the anxiety is gone.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In the spring of 2021, Coppins and Romney began meeting weekly, in secret, for interviews that sometimes went on for hours. Several months had passed since the January 6th insurrection, and Coppins writes that Romney “often sounded like a spy behind enemy lines.” Romney confided that much of his party “really doesn&#39;t believe in the Constitution.” He was mulling difficult questions, including his own culpability in what had become of the GOP: “Was the rot on the right new, or was it something very old just now bubbling to the surface? And what role had the members of the mainstream establishment––people like him, the &lt;em>;reasonable&lt;/em>; Republicans––played in allowing that rot to fester?”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Last month, Romney announced, at the age of seventy-six, that he would not seek reëlection in the Senate. He cited his age in his decision, declaring that it was time for a new generation of leaders. According to Coppins, Romney has had recurring premonitions of his death. His church teaches him that, one day, he will stand before God and face an accounting, for his thoughts, words, and works. He will have to explain his time in politics––the positions he took, the compromises he made, where he chose to stand firm. If Romney is at a loss, he might bring along Coppins&#39;s record of his reckoning. ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;jpwdr&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;8qriav&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 24 Oct 2023 05:06:01 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Innovative Ways to Demand an N.B.A. Trade]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.newyorker.com/humor/daily-shouts/innovative-ways-to-demand-an-nba-trade]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-23T16:06:21.597Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65367b7a13c1e561d000bf20/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Babb-Shouts-NBA-Trades.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;article >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attribute-verso-pattern=&quot;article-body&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;ArticlePageChunks&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Basketball season is upon us, after an offseason that featured multiple trade requests across the league. The traditional way of requesting to be traded in the NBA is the player or his representation talks with his team&#39;s management. But that&#39;s so 2022. It&#39;s time to get creative, to have your trade request go viral. Treat it like a prom-posal. Show your team you mean business. Here are some trade-request ideas players can use to get themselves into a new team&#39;s uniform, stat.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;Retire, Then Unretire&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Nobody wants to call it quits. But if you&#39;d like to show your team that you&#39;ll never play for them ever again, hang up the jersey. Retire from the game you love. Your contract will be void. Then sit out a year and reveal—psych!—you changed your mind. When you retired at twenty-two years old, you just needed a little break from the game. Come back at twenty-three after a nice rest and sign with the team you originally wanted to be traded to. It&#39;s a bold move that could possibly lose you millions of dollars, but think of all the time you&#39;ll have to play video games!&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;Camp Out in Front of Another Team&#39;s Arena&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Camping out will show how committed you are to changing your situation. Pretend this is an iPhone release. Get a tent and some bottled water, and set up shop right in front of that desired team&#39;s HQ. You&#39;re an NBA player, which means you&#39;re tall and famous enough to attract attention. You won&#39;t be alone because the media and fans will come hang out with you. You might even catch your desired team&#39;s manager on his way into the building and hand him your résumé.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;Tattoo Your Trade Request&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Ink your trade request right on your body. Everyone will look at you and think, He must really hate the team he&#39;s on; also, I wonder who the tattoo artist was—they did a great job! Get it on your forearm or face or both—it&#39;ll be inescapable and things will get very awkward for your current team members whenever they see you. When they ask, “How are you?,” you can just point to your tattoo. Once you&#39;ve been traded, get the tattoo removed, and make space for when you&#39;re ready to request another trade.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;Pay Taylor Swift to Post Your Trade Request&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;If you want attention for your cause, just ask Taylor Swift for help. The Swifties will rally behind whatever she posts. Taylor posting your trade request to her Instagram story for twenty-four hours will change the next few years of your life. And if she tags the team&#39;s president, he won&#39;t be able to handle the millions of Swifties spamming his social-media accounts. He won&#39;t want to be on the Swifties&#39; bad side for too long. That social shame would be too much to overcome.&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;Get a Signature Shoe Made&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Players with their own sneakers release special editions for a variety of different reasons. For instance, Michael Jordan sells the “Flu Game” version of his shoes because he wore them while famously playing through illness during the NBA finals. Make a special colorway of your signature shoe called the “Trade Request” edition or the “Get Me Out of Town” edition. The colors? Obviously they have to be the colors of the team you want to play for. Shoot a cool commercial starring Spike Lee so that when you finally get traded people can say, “It&#39;s gotta be the shoes!”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;Throw a Party and Only Invite Players from a Different Team&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Everybody loves a good party. What they don&#39;t love is not being invited. Throw a party and only invite the players on the team you want to play for. Do not invite your current teammates. The day after the party, post pictures of it all over social media. Your teammates will be offended when they see all the fun they missed—like the champagne fountain, the acrobatic jugglers, and the intense games of Jenga. They&#39;ll be so offended that they never pass you the ball again, thus pushing management to make sure you&#39;re off the team ASAP.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;Get a Note from Home&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;The power of a note from your parent or guardian is underrated. Just because you&#39;re not a child anymore doesn&#39;t mean your parental figure&#39;s authority matters any less. Have your mom write a quick note to the team president saying, “My son is no longer allowed to play for your team because we have concerns.” Boom—problem solved. What type of monster of a team president wouldn&#39;t listen to his player&#39;s mom&#39;s concerns?&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;Get a Note from Your Doctor&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;If that heartless team president won&#39;t heed the note from home, you must up the ante with a doctor&#39;s note.

On the opposite side are the lavish gothic buildings of Yale, the Ivy League institution with an endowment of forty billion dollars. Balancing the interests of both the town and the university falls in large part to New Haven&#39;s Board of Alders, a council of thirty members. The board assembles twice a month, and typically there are many more alders in attendance than members of the public. But at a meeting in early February, on the second floor of city hall, the alders were outnumbered. The crowd crammed into the pews and stood along the back wall to hear the mayor, Justin Elicker, give his annual State of the City address.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Elicker, a spindly Yale alum in a midnight-blue suit, proclaimed that New Haven, having survived the pandemic downturn and a sixty-six-million-dollar budget deficit, was “outperforming the state at large and every other major city.” The recovery was real, though the median household still had an income of about forty-nine thousand dollars, and one in four residents lived at or below the federal poverty level. Yale, the city&#39;s largest landowner, is a nonprofit and thus exempt from paying taxes on school property. (The total tax break for Yale and Yale New Haven Hospital would cover most of the city&#39;s education budget.) In 1990, the university started to make an annual voluntary payment, usually a symbolic fraction of what it would otherwise owe. Elicker explained that things were beginning to change. In 2022, “we nearly doubled Yale University&#39;s annual voluntary contribution—from thirteen million to twenty-three million,” he said. One cause, according to the mayor? “Decades of grassroots organizing by &lt;em >;Unite Here&lt;/em>;.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;em >;Unite Here&lt;/em>; is a North American labor union, with roots in the garment and hotel trades, that&#39;s known for its willingness to strike. Its divisions in New Haven have grown to encompass some eight thousand people who work at Yale. The earliest effort began in 1941, with Local 35, when mechanics in the campus power plant organized and later fought to bring in custodial and dining-hall workers. In 1984, the union struck for ten weeks to support receptionists, librarians, and laboratory researchers in their formation of Local 34. Most recently, after several failed attempts stretching across more than three decades, graduate-student teachers finally won their own union, Local 33.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The mayor credited the unions for holding the university accountable, but the gesture was also politically expedient: the Board of Alders is dominated by members or allies of &lt;em >;Unite Here&lt;/em>;. In a 2011 campaign nicknamed Aldermania, the unions ran a slate of candidates to win a majority on the Board. The idea was to bring working-class residents into government and turn the board into more than a rubber-stamping mechanism for the mayor. Weeks of door-knocking during the sticky summer heat paid off: seventeen of eighteen candidates endorsed by the union won their elections. They were Black and white and Latino; there was a Yale janitor, a Yale library assistant, and a Yale undergraduate. The majority has held ever since.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Tyisha Walker-Myers, who became an alder in the 2011 election, is now in her fourth term as president of the board. During the State of the City address, she sat to the right of Elicker, wearing glasses and long braids. She grew up in West River, a predominantly Black neighborhood, as factories in the area were shrivelling. She attended Albertus Magnus College, a local Roman Catholic university in New Haven, but felt out of place—“I was the only minority”—and left without a degree. In 1998, she got a job in a dining hall at Yale, her first real experience of the university beyond the monied shadow that it cast over her home town. “If you came on campus and weren&#39;t supposed to be there, you were going to be chased out by security,” she recalled. She became a shop steward in Local 35, then took a full-time job at the union. Her jump into local politics—the alder gig was technically part time and came with a tiny stipend—still felt like an odd fit. “People believe politics is crooked,” she said. “I&#39;m not a politician because I don&#39;t lie. I&#39;m very straightforward.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Across the country, &lt;em >;Unite Here&lt;/em>; invests heavily in electoral politics. One of its locals, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1996/02/26/how-the-maids-fought-back&quot;>;Culinary Union&lt;/a>;, in Las Vegas, has played a big role in keeping Nevada blue. In California, María Elena Durazo, a former &lt;em >;Unite Here&lt;/em>; organizer, is a powerful member of the California Senate and has served as vice-chair of the Democratic National Committee. But it is in New Haven that the union has come closest to functioning like an actual political party. The Yale locals&#39; effort to put members in office was part of a larger mission to bridge New Haven&#39;s town-gown divide.&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;It was a daunting, aspirational program: to jumble the boundaries of race and class and élite education. Some experiences would never be shared. In Elicker&#39;s speech, he arrived at the topic of gun violence. It was just a month into the new year, and five residents of New Haven, which has a population of a hundred and thirty-nine thousand, had already been killed—all people of color. (White people make up about forty per cent of New Haven; the rest are mostly Black or Latino.) The first victim, Dontae Myers, was twenty-three when he was shot, on New Year&#39;s Day. His brother, Dashown, had been killed in similar circumstances, in 2020—and a community group started by &lt;em >;Unite Here&lt;/em>;, called New Haven Rising, organized vigils after both of their deaths. The boys&#39; mother, LaQuvia Jones, was Walker-Myers&#39;s best friend, as close to her as a sister. The mayor paraphrased something that Jones had said: “When you pull the trigger, you don&#39;t pull it on a target. You pull it on a community. You pull it on anyone who loves that person.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;In January, the planning for Dontae&#39;s funeral had awkwardly coincided with celebrations at the union. A few blocks from city hall, grad students in jeans and shabby-chic sweaters were gathered in the basement of a Methodist church, which rents space to the union, to watch a live feed of the National Labor Relations Board certifying ballots for and against Local 33. The viewing party was largely devoid of suspense (the yes vote was overwhelming), but the room still whooped when the union was proclaimed official. There was a feeling of resolution. At the same time, the result would test the durability of the &lt;em >;Unite Here&lt;/em>; model. Graduate workers had built their demands on the struggles of Locals 35 and 34: New Haven&#39;s working class. These fellow-unionists expected fealty to labor—and to the needs of the city&#39;s residents—over Yale. It was more than a decade into Aldermania, which was now a mature political experiment in a stubbornly unequal place. Could the Yale unions find enough common ground between graduate students and custodians and billing clerks to keep the experiment going?&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The town-gown divide is almost as old as the college town itself. In a fabled instance from the mid-fourteenth century, students at Oxford accused the owners of the Swindlestock Tavern of serving subpar alcohol. Townies came to the tavern&#39;s defense, and the conflict erupted into a three-day riot that killed nearly a hundred men. Much later, the US imported many aspects of the physically and socially cloistered British university system. Town-gown relations proved manageable when the college was just one piece of the local economy. The strain sharpened when cities that once boomed with manufacturing became overly dependent on higher education.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;By the seventies and eighties, New Haven&#39;s factories were shutting down. Workers turned to jobs in health care and the service sector, and Yale became one of the city&#39;s top employers. (Its sister corporation, Yale New Haven Health System, is the largest private employer in Connecticut.) Yale expanded in enrollment and physical size, and its endowment grew at a rate that&#39;s difficult to comprehend, doubling since the Great Recession. New Haven, meanwhile, stayed relatively poor: the nonprofit DataHaven found that between 1990 and 2017—a span of nearly thirty years—the median household income &lt;em>;decreased&lt;/em>; by about two thousand dollars. Four-fifths of higher-wage jobs are held by suburban commuters who don&#39;t live in the city.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Yale made some efforts to be a good neighbor: it set up an Office of New Haven Affairs, redeveloped a commercial corridor downtown, and established a first-time-home-buyer subsidy for university employees, many of whom came from the surrounding community. Still, the Yale unions saw a need for more ambitious redistribution. They pushed initiatives that had little to do with contracts or other typical union fare, provoking accusations of “machine politics” and undue influence from their critics. “This particular vision of industrial unionism is pretty unique and not something you see very much at other unionized institutions of higher ed,” Zach Schwartz-Weinstein, a historian of Local 35 and a former member of NYU&#39;s grad-worker union, told me.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The unions pressured Yale to deliver more voluntary payments to the city and scrutinized Yale&#39;s requests for building permits. They established a local-hiring program run in partnership with the university, which, in 2015, promised to hire a thousand residents from New Haven, half from majority-minority “neighborhoods of need,” within five years. When Yale failed to keep pace, the Board of Alders convened a hearing that overflowed the aldermanic chambers. Walker-Myers, the board president, accused Yale of inflating its statistics with short-term construction jobs. A university representative promised to “think of systemic changes” to reach its goal. (In 2021, that goal was met.)&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;n3xru&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Part of &lt;em >;Unite Here&lt;/em>;&#39;s strategy has been to recruit organizers from the Yale student body. In 1969, it brought on John Wilhelm, who had been a working-class transfer student and civil-rights activist. At the time, Local 35 was staging long, aggressive strikes to win better-than-poverty wages. Wilhelm believed that a union should be run mostly by workers from the rank and file—his mentor was Vincent Sirabella, a former waiter and bartender who&#39;d risen through a local in Providence—but he also saw a place for intellectuals. In 2000, the union recruited Gwen Mills, a Cornell graduate who had grown up in New Haven. Mills helped to develop the campaign to run a labor slate for the Board of Alders. Like Wilhelm, she was later promoted to an executive position at the international headquarters of &lt;em >;Unite Here&lt;/em>;. They prototyped a career path that dozens of Yalies would follow.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In April, Wilhelm and Mills flew to New Haven for a two-day celebration of Local 33&#39;s win. Former Ph.D. students, many now tenured professors, arrived from across the US, England, and Brazil, and gathered in the sanctuary of the Methodist church. Mills stood at the pulpit and described her transition from Yale-resenting townie to union organizer. “I grew up a mile from here,” she said. “I got married here in this sanctuary.” She recalled a popular bumper sticker from her childhood—“Beep! Beep! Yale&#39;s cheap!”—that critiqued the university&#39;s stingy approach to the community. New Haven, she said, is a “post-industrial manufacturing town with a multibillion-dollar education corporation plopped right into the middle of it.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I came to Yale as a college freshman in the late nineteen-nineties, naïve and unprepared. I&#39;d never spent time on the East Coast. I was lousy at research and writing. I hadn&#39;t known anyone with money. When I tried to make small talk and asked one girl where she was from, she said, “Chelsea.” Another prep-school kid responded, “Park Avenue.” Where? Meanwhile, the message from Yale was to stay on campus, away from what it deemed the inner-city dangers of New Haven. I felt a small crack in this wall of alienation when I learned about the efforts of &lt;em >;GESO&lt;/em>;, the Graduate Employees and Students Organization, the precursor of Local 33.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Looking back, it was risky for Locals 35 and 34 to ask dining-hall cooks and library aides—who lived in the neighborhoods I was told to avoid—to put their dues money toward a union for young classics scholars, let alone chemists who could seemingly go on to lucrative jobs in Big Pharma. Barbara Vereen, a Local 34 staffer who worked in medical billing at the time and was raised in New Haven, told me that she was initially dismissive of the graduate campaign. Then, in 2003, she heard a presentation on the tenure-track system. “I came back, and I told my co-workers, we&#39;re looking at this all wrong,” she said. “Like, these people are workers. They got the same problems that we got.” The Yale historian Michael Denning told me, “The struggle for the first ten or fifteen years was to see the teaching work of graduate students &lt;em>;as work&lt;/em>;. I wrote two or three essays to prove it to myself.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;More persuasion came from Yale. Members of &lt;em >;GESO&lt;/em>; from the nineties and two-thousands endured years of acrimonious dealings. Even in departments that might have seemed friendly to unionization, student organizers say that they were sidelined, even blacklisted. “In anthropology, it was trench warfare,” Nazima Kadir, who was a Ph.D. student in that department, told me. One of her classmates was nearly expelled. An associate professor who came out in support of them was denied tenure. That professor was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/05/13/paint-bombs&quot;>;David Graeber&lt;/a>;, who went on to teach in England and helped launch Occupy Wall Street. (According to Yale, the vast majority of professors in Graeber&#39;s cohort were denied tenure; the university maintains that it has respected the right to organize.)&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In the two-thousands, as colleges relied increasingly on Ph.D. and master&#39;s candidates to fill their teaching needs, graduate students across the US turned to unions. But, at private universities, the status of this workforce was unsettled: were they student-apprentices or true employees who deserved the right to organize? The National Labor Relations Board went back and forth on this question. In 2016, Local 33 unionized a few select departments; in 2017, members staged a hunger strike. Then, after the Trump years, the union relaunched a comprehensive drive. In the fall of 2022, organizers collected more than two thousand union cards, and, unlike in years past, Yale administrators and faculty mostly left the students alone.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Local 33&#39;s victory this year was one of many landslide academic elections in a matter of months. At Boston University, the union won ninety-eight per cent of the vote; at the University of Chicago, ninety-two per cent; at the University of Minnesota, where the first attempt at a union had been made in 1974, ninety-seven per cent; at Duke, eighty-eight per cent. Late last year, nearly fifty thousand graduate teachers and researchers at the University of California struck for six weeks—the largest academic work stoppage in US history. A few months later, some nine thousand academic workers at Rutgers walked out over an expired contract. Only at Yale were grad workers integrated into a larger campus union, but the Rutgers campaign made a point of emphasizing links to the community. Its “common good” demands included a rent freeze on all Rutgers-owned properties and a million-dollar investment in the surrounding neighborhoods—though it won neither at the negotiating table. (Rutgers did promise to distribute six hundred thousand dollars through a nonprofit.)&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;pa667p&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Since the beginning of 2022, the National Labor Relations Board has certified twenty-seven bargaining units at private colleges and universities, comprising more than thirty-two thousand student workers. Undergraduates with on-campus jobs have organized as well—at Dartmouth, the University of Pennsylvania, Barnard, Tufts, and the University of Massachusetts at Amherst. Some nineteen thousand student workers on the twenty-three campuses of the California State University system will soon vote in a union election. Colin Culver, an undergraduate at San Diego State University, told me that the majority are from working-class families in town. The school pays them less than they pay regular staff. “They use student staff to lower wages for everyone,” Culver said. The union, he hopes, will put a stop to that.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;This spring, I met with Sulema Hamilton, a custodian in Local 35, who had just finished her shift at Yale&#39;s Asian American Cultural Center. (I worked there senior year as part of my financial-aid package.) The center is situated in an old three-story brick building with a covered porch. Hamilton was dressed in her Yale navy blues and safety shoes, and wore sparkly earrings. When she was growing up in New Haven, she said, her grandmother worked at a gun plant and belonged to a union. Hamilton went away for college, then returned to marry and raise two daughters and a son. For many years, she was a bank teller, but after a while her career stalled. She knew that jobs at Yale were union, and asked about a clerical position, envisioning something at a desk. The recruiter pointed her in another direction. “She&#39;s, like, &#39;It could be the kitchen, or custodial services,&#39; ” Hamilton told me. “I said, &#39;Well, I do all those things at home—how difficult can it be?&#39; ” She did have one very grimy assignment—at Gryphon&#39;s Pub, in a Yale-owned property that smelled like beer and piss. “I made it look like a palace,” she said. “I never looked at my position as &#39;I&#39;m doing something less.&#39; ” Her janitorial pay and benefits soon surpassed what she had earned as a teller.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Hamilton saw herself as a fixer of ordinary troubles, the kind of person you&#39;d want to be around if anything bad came your way: unpaid overtime, improper orders, a nasty supervisor. She and other campus workers I interviewed described union membership in broader terms as well. “If you think about a big institution, a big establishment, you have to get into politics,” Lisa Stevens, a medical assistant at Yale&#39;s cancer center and the vice-president of Local 34, told me. “You have to find other ways to fight. We can never match their dollars.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In 2022, Hamilton took time off to canvass for Democratic Senate candidates in Pennsylvania and Georgia. Other members of Locals 35 and 34, and grad workers with Local 33, joined her. It wasn&#39;t unusual for unions to stump for Democratic politicians. But, in 2020, Gwen Mills, the New Haven townie at &lt;em >;Unite Here&lt;/em>;&#39;s headquarters, devised a mass mobilization that doubled as income replacement. Most &lt;em >;Unite Here&lt;/em>; members worked in hotels and hospitality, and had lost their jobs during the pandemic. The union offered them hourly door-knocking work in battleground states—and helped pull off white-knuckle wins in Arizona, Pennsylvania, and Georgia (though Local 11, which covers Arizona and Southern California, later seemed to regret their exertions on behalf of now Senator Kyrsten Sinema).&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;When &lt;em >;GESO&lt;/em>; got started, in the nineties, graduate unions were considered faddish and economically unnecessary: the purview of gender-studies scholars or Marxist students whose parents were Marxist professors. &lt;em >;STEM&lt;/em>; people were assumed to be hard to organize. Ditto international students. It&#39;s now harder to conjure a typical profile. At the vote count, in the church basement, I noticed a South Asian woman wearing a cut-up T-shirt covered in “Local 33 &lt;em >;UNITEHERE&lt;/em>;!” buttons, in the style of chain mail, that jangled as she moved around the room. Her name was Arita Acharya, and she had taken a leave of absence from her Ph.D. in genetics to work for the union. “Some of the reasons I went into &lt;em >;STEM&lt;/em>; were my real desire and curiosity, but it was also my culture hammering into me that this was the only worthy thing to do,” she told me. During the pandemic, she&#39;d canvassed New Haven to try to get people vaccinated, and discovered that organizing was “another thing I might want.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Former organizers told me that &lt;em >;Unite Here&lt;/em>;&#39;s expectations were “psychotic” and that the experience was “exhausting.” They also said that it changed their lives. Shana Redmond, now an English professor at Columbia, was part of a &lt;em >;GESO&lt;/em>; effort to pressure Yale to divest from private-prison companies. As “the child of a formerly incarcerated person,” she told me, she saw in that campaign “the possibility of what a union could be.” Redmond chose to stay in academia, but other organizers applied their Ph.Ds to careers in labor. At the Local 33 celebrations in April, alumni included the presidents of &lt;em >;Unite Here&lt;/em>; locals in Miami and Seattle, a labor educator in Massachusetts, and a labor strategist in Arizona. The Yale-to-union pipeline spawned a semi-facetious conspiracy theory: maybe &lt;em >;Unite Here&lt;/em>; had intentionally stretched out the graduate-student organizing, in order to recruit as many smart young people into the labor movement as possible.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;By late spring, Acharya was weighing this choice herself. “It&#39;s a scary moment right now,” she told me. Would she return to her lab in the fall or defect for a union job? She ultimately chose an option in between, extending her leave of absence—“Because I&#39;m still having a good time!” she texted me. Other leaders of Local 33 resumed their studies. Abigail Fields, a Ph.D. candidate in French who&#39;d been on leave with Acharya, went back to her dissertation on representations of agriculture and rural life in the nineteenth-century French novel. Fields would spend the coming year in France, but planned to stay involved in the union. Her immersion in organizing had changed her personality. “I like myself much more now than when I was keeping my head down,” she said. “My adviser also noticed a move in my dissertation from ecology to labor.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;When campus emptied out for the summer, Acharya stayed busy with collective bargaining—Local 33 was meeting regularly with university representatives—and other &lt;em >;Unite Here&lt;/em>; business. The summer agenda was to tell neighbors about a new law that allowed renters to form tenants&#39; unions, and encourage them to file complaints with the city&#39;s Fair Rent Commission. In June, the members of New Haven&#39;s first two tenants&#39; unions rallied outside the offices of their corporate landlord. One protester held up a sign that said “A 30% Rent Increase Is a Soft Eviction!!!” Another described “a lot of mice, just killing them constantly.” In late August, after sixteen households in one of those buildings were given eviction notices, the statewide Connecticut Tenants Union (whose founders include members of Local 33) filed a lawsuit and called for a mass protest. The Yale unions showed up with hundreds of other people. Two days later, the company cancelled the evictions and agreed to negotiate.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Luke Melonakos-Harrison, the vice-president of the Connecticut Tenants Union, graduated earlier this year from Yale&#39;s Divinity School. “I had some anxiety when I got into organizing as a Yale student, trying to get involved in New Haven,” he told me. “There&#39;s definitely tension there, and bad histories.” There were also commonalities. When he and his wife rented their first apartment in New Haven, the bathroom ceiling nearly crashed down on their heads—and the rent wasn&#39;t cheap. “Everyone&#39;s rent is going up and everyone hates their landlord,” Acharya said. While door-knocking three days a week, she found that housing issues got people talking, which she could use to segue into conversations about politics. A primary election was coming up, and the Yale unions had endorsed Elicker for a second term and twenty-two candidates for alder seats. Three of those alder candidates were running for the first time. A handful of others—including the fourth-term president, Walker-Myers—were incumbents dating back to Aldermania. Acharya could point to plenty of achievements: Elicker and the union-backed alders had passed the ordinance legalizing tenants&#39; unions; they had steered pandemic-relief funds toward social services; they had pushed Yale to pay more in taxes. “I didn&#39;t realize how much the union was gonna feel like a political campaign,” Acharya told me. “It &lt;em>;was&lt;/em>; a political campaign.” ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 24 Oct 2023 00:06:01 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
