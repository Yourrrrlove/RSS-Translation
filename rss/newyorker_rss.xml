/p>;&lt;p>;这一切都是在 Walter Isaacson 的 &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Elon-Musk-Walter-Isaacson/dp/1982181281&quot; data-event- 发布时展开的click=&quot;{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Elon-Musk-Walter-Isaacson/dp/1982181281&quot;}&quot;

以阻止“清醒病毒”在网上传播。他的祖父写了他的小册子，对广播和电视上他所谓的“精神控制”发出警报，“对白人进行无条件的宣传战。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;霍尔德曼出生于1902 年出生于明尼苏达州，但主要在加拿大萨斯喀彻温省长大。作为一名勇敢的飞行员，有时还当过牛仔，他还接受过脊椎按摩师的培训和工作。在十九世纪三十年代，他加入了准法西斯主义&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/04/03/the-data-delusion&quot;>;技术官僚运动&lt;/a>;，其支持者认为，统治者应该是科学家和工程师，而不是人民。他成为加拿大该运动的领导人，当该运动被短暂取缔时，他被监禁，此后他成为当时臭名昭著的反犹太主义政党“社会信用”的全国主席。十九世纪四十年代，他打着该党的旗号竞选公职，但失败了。 1950 年，南非实行种族隔离两年后，他举家搬到比勒陀利亚，在那里他成为该政权的热情捍卫者。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;在互联网时代之前，政治极端分子的著作往往是私人出版，数量相当少。一个愤怒的人写下关于隐形世界政府的备忘录，可能会制作一些油印机或复写本，但最终进入图书馆、编目和保存的可能性很小。据推测，霍尔德曼的大部分文件如果没有被销毁，仍然掌握在家人手中。但他的一些作品幸存下来，包括密歇根州立大学图书馆非凡的 &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://libguides.lib.msu.edu/radicalism&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&quot;element&quot; :&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://libguides.lib.msu.edu/radicalism&quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://libguides.lib.msu.edu/radicalism&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;激进主义收藏&lt;/a>;。&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;2017 年，该收藏获得了霍尔德曼的两本小册子，作为来自一位匿名捐赠者的宝藏的一部分，现已发展到一万九千件右翼宣传和阴谋文学。霍尔德曼的其中一本小册子《建立世界独裁政权的国际阴谋和对南非的威胁》的日期为 1960 年 5 月。时机很重要。 1960 年 2 月，英国首相哈罗德·麦克米伦在南非议会发表了著名的“变革之风”演讲，反对种族隔离并敦促接受独立运动：“变革之风正在吹过这片大陆，并且，无论我们喜欢与否，这种民族意识的增长都是一个政治事实。” 3 月，南非警方向沙佩维尔警察局外抗议的数千名南非黑人开枪，造成包括儿童在内的 69 人死亡，近 200 人受伤。电视捕捉到了杀戮过程，并报道到了世界各地。在随后的抗议活动和紧急状态中，&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/12/16/nelson-mandela&quot;>;纳尔逊·曼德拉&lt;/a>;是被捕并被逮捕的一万八千人之一。被监禁。霍尔德曼的小册子捍卫白人统治，反对反对它的“国际阴谋”。&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;“洗脑者每天都在重复并强调他们希望我们相信的事情，”霍尔德曼在 1960 年 5 月的四十二页小册子中警告道。 “例如‘原住民受到虐待’、‘工资过低’、‘弱势群体’、‘单独发展是错误的’、‘种族隔离不符合基督教’。”每天的报纸、杂志、商业广播新闻播音员、传记都将这一点灌输到公众的意识和潜意识中。” （这里的“Biscopes”指的是电影。）“那些知道 99% 不真实的人会强烈而情绪化地重复这些谎言，”霍尔德曼写道。&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc ” >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;霍尔德曼谴责许多他认为传播这些思想的黑暗势力：犹太银行家、犹太知识分子、犹太人经营的慈善基金会、共产主义者、黑人领袖以及任何支持推翻殖民统治的人在非洲。 “历史事实表明，白人发展他所居住的国家始终是为了所有有关方面的利益，”他写道，兜售种族隔离宣传，“非洲黑人从最早的时候就与文明有着密切的联系。 ”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;在密歇根州立大学持有的第二本小册子“健康领域的国际阴谋”中，霍尔德曼指责“集体主义-国际主义者”阴谋——“从肯尼迪到肯雅塔”——“集中医疗计划”，包括国家健康保险和各种药品（包括水中的氟化物，另一个阴谋），他认为所有这些都是“反基督教对人类自由的侵犯”。他写道，如果有些人没有对这一切感到震惊，那是因为精神控制。 “当基督徒认同这一点时，这是国际阴谋进行集中、故意洗脑的结果。”接受国家医疗保健是阴谋者允许“黑人或有色人种政治傀儡”“控制负责任的白人”的一种方式。他警告说，阴谋集团控制着大学、医学院，甚至教科书。 “阴谋集团认为任何医疗干预，只要是大规模的，都是理想的程序。”最重要的是，“世界政府的推动者一直支持大规模疫苗接种计划。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;除了这两本小册子之外，本月早些时候，一位善本书籍经销商还出售了一份时事通讯的第 5 期。他将其称为&lt;em>;生存&lt;/em>;（“仅限成人”），出自霍尔德曼之手。 （据经销商报道，作者的姓名出现在封底。）在 1962 年 1 月之后出版的这期杂志中，作者将非洲国家日益增长的独立运动描述为“&lt;em>;疯狂的世界&lt;/em>;” ”。 “整个所谓的非洲独立国家完全混乱，”他写道。 “人口减少到饥饿和同类相食的程度，接近白人到来之前的情况。”他将 Mau Mau 描述为一种仪式，要求入会者“吮吸其他 Mau Mau 不幸受害者被肢解的阴茎”。他谴责以色列“在联合国一贯投票反对南非”。但是，无论如何，他解释说，联合国充斥着共产主义间谍。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;霍尔德曼大概是用自己的打字机打出他的小册子的。他可能制作了几十本，或者数百本，但不可能更多。他可能通过邮件寄出它们，或者在政治集会、教堂会议或男性团体中分发它们。无论如何，它们被比勒陀利亚及其附近的少数南非人阅读，也可能被更远的地方志同道合的人阅读。然后他们几乎就消失了。但如果霍尔德曼今天在写作，他很可能会在 Facebook、YouTube、Twitter、Reddit 和 4chan 等上传播他的想法。算法会将它们提供给数千甚至数百万人。他会找到观众。他会变得更加大胆。他会找到更多的观众。他会变得更加大胆。埃隆·马斯克祖父的政治观点不是马斯克的责任。但如果这些咆哮今天发布在 X 上，会发生什么，确实就在他家门口。 ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot;

— 1984 年拍摄的电影《Stop Making Sense》，讲述了 Talking Heads 乐队的表演。 （现在正在院线重新上映，并进行了新的修复。）&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;戴米 - 无论是在他之前的电影中，例如“公民乐队”和“梅尔文和霍华德”，还是他后来的更著名的电影，包括《沉默的羔羊》、《费城》和《瑞秋结婚》——擅长追踪演员阵容的复杂互动。同样的艺术冲动也是《Stop Making Sense》的核心，它将 1983 年 12 月在好莱坞潘特吉斯剧院举行的三场 Talking Heads 表演的部分内容拼接在一起，以唤起一场音乐会的效果。凭借戴米的戏剧性特征，乐团的创作是他以演员为中心的导演道德的产物，但在《Stop Making Sense》中，他通过创造独特的形象剧目来实现这种感觉，强调乐队成员的相互作用并提供清晰的视觉效果音乐会开始时，乐队主唱大卫·伯恩 (David Byrne) 独自站在舞台上，穿着浅色西装和白色运动鞋，弹着原声吉他，唱着“Psycho Killer”旁边的音箱里传来预先录制的节拍。他并不孤单（在他身后可以看到工作人员），但是，他凭借自己的智慧和专注表演，看起来就像是从拼图中掉下来的一块。这是一场富有意义的表演，凸显了他孤独的不足，而电影只有在下一首歌曲《天堂》中才爆发出生命力，乐队的贝斯手蒂娜·韦茅斯也加入了他的行列。戴米将两位音乐家放在一起：伯恩在前景中表情丰富，而韦茅斯在背景中，穿着连身裤，在伯恩演奏时注视着她。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;与此同时，工作人员推着一个立管和一个乐队的另外两位创始成员走上舞台，准备下一集：吉他手兼键盘手杰里·哈里森 (Jerry Harrison) 非常专业，但鼓手克里斯·弗朗茨 (Chris Frantz) 穿着 Polo 衫，他的“哎呀”咧嘴一笑，看起来就像高中高尔夫球队的成员，因被邀请与艺术孩子们一起即兴演奏而感到高兴和惊讶。戴米的取景根据配置进行调整，从音乐家身后对角拍摄，以便屏幕充满他们重叠且对比鲜明的节奏动作——与“谢谢你送我一个天使”的奔腾和“找到工作”的节奏形成视觉对立”。最后，乐队新招募的五名新成员浮出水面：键盘手 Bernie Worrell（P-Funk 的联合创始人）、主唱 Lynn Mabry（同样来自 P-Funk）和 Ednah Holt、吉他手 Alex Weir 和打击乐手 Steve秤。这五位音乐家都是黑人，他们的声音主要植根于放克，而 Talking Heads 的四位创始成员是白人，在这种融合中，乐队宣布风格的相遇和融合作为其音乐和智力项目的核心。作为一名九位成员，Talking Heads 成为一个热情而欢快的团体，其音乐和表现力范围得到了扩展，而 Demme 也扩展了他的电影词汇来与之匹配。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Talking Heads 和其他音乐家出现在这个时代是有原因的。十九世纪七十年代——金发女郎、埃尔维斯·科斯特洛、电视、B-52 乐队和雷蒙斯乐队——被称为新浪潮。这个词不仅仅是代际标记。就像法国新浪潮电影制作人一样，这些摇滚乐手对他们的艺术有着历史的视角，并将其融入到他们的音乐中。在摇滚乐从声名狼藉的边缘走向稳固的主流的过程中成长起来，他们继承了一种流派，这种流派的新地位使他们有勇气在丰富的内心音乐百科全书的基础上创作大胆前瞻的音乐。&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt; /div>;&lt;p>;《Talking Heads》在其方法上从根本上是参考性的，引用了摇滚和流行的风格和基调，而不是完全属于其中任何一种。例如，伯恩捕捉并美化了罗伊·奥比森音乐中本质上的孤独感。奥比森音乐的孤独植根（或无根）于广阔的空间，而伯恩的音乐则是一种充实的孤独，一种在不可避免的城市人群和复杂技术的疏远影响中的孤立。 《Stop Making Sense》在富有表现力的特写镜头中捕捉到了伯恩将他的技术异化带入生活的自觉机械的笨拙。在“Once in a Lifetime”中，他开始重复自己，然后敲头打破循环，就好像他是一个有缺陷的机器人。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;乐队在“Stop Making Sense”中的扩展阵容同样是自我-意识到的。在集体想象中，组建乐队是郊区白人中产阶级内心孤独的一种救赎。从艺术角度来说，阵容中五位黑人放克音乐家的到来与&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/postscript/jean-luc-godard-was-cinemas-north -star&quot;>;让-吕克·戈达尔&lt;/a>;选角美国女演员&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/the-clippings-file-jean-seberg- an-american-in-paris&quot;>;Jean Seberg&lt;/a>; 在《气喘吁吁》中。 《Talking Heads》制作出真正的惊悚片的可能性并不比戈达尔制作好莱坞黑色电影的可能性大，但他们所做的不仅仅是向他们的影响和灵感的遥不可及的理想致敬；他们创作的艺术记录了这些影响的变革力量。一旦五重奏加入，乐队就变成了一台强大的机器，戴米用全景、正面的图像来美化它，捕捉充满舞台的能量。不断扩大的摄像机角度阵列捕捉到了各个音乐家之间引发的几乎突触的联系。伯恩与马布里和霍尔特的互动将他的戏剧想象力推向了一个新的疯狂水平。当他们开玩笑地模仿他在“战时生活”中原地奔跑时的滑稽动作后，他加大了赌注，开始在舞台上以巨大的椭圆形奔跑。在《Crossseyed and Painless》中，他在歌手的合唱连复段中对声感叹，将言语智慧与手势发明的讽刺手法结合在一起。他从夸张的尴尬中提取出的悲情和幽默总是与强度相平衡。事实上，他戏剧性的孤独似乎是雅克·塔蒂式的——他在《This Must Be the Place》中与棒灯跳舞甚至可以是“&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody” /dvd-of-the-week-playtime&quot;>;播放时间&lt;/a>;”参考。 （&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/david-byrnes-gray-suits-from-stop-making-sense-to-american-utopia&quot;>;超大四角西装&lt; /a>; 伯恩在电影中几场比赛中所穿的衣服已经成为标志性的，但它也是多余的：他已经在整场音乐会的表演中表达了其本质。）戴米将孤独的伯恩和嗡嗡作响的乐队并置是表现主义的：伯恩，紧紧地照亮在《一生一次》中，从侧面看，他看起来着魔了，就像一个狂躁的传教士；当艾尔·格林 (Al Green) 的《带我去河边》中的福音情色将整个乐队带入欣喜若狂的能量顶峰时，电影摄影似乎也加入了进来，呈现出令人兴奋的一系列鲜明对比的角度和充满活力的平移镜头。&lt;/p>;&lt;戴米在《Stop Making Sense》中唤起的戏剧性是表演合作中产生的艺术自我超越。这个想法的时机已经到来，并且几乎同时被另外两位电影制作人探索：戈达尔和 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/postscript-chantal-akerman&quot; >;尚塔尔·阿克曼&lt;/a>;。戈达尔的《名字：卡门》是这部歌剧的更新版黑色电影，其中比才的大部分音乐被贝多芬的弦乐四重奏所取代，在银幕上表演并以大胆的、绘画般的视觉对位感拍摄。阿克曼的纪录片“&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/goings-on-about-town/movies/one-day-pina-asked&quot;>;皮娜询问的一天”。 。 .&lt;/a>;”，描绘了 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/in-memoriam-pina-bausch&quot;>;Pina Bausch&lt;/a>; 和她的公司伍珀塔尔舞蹈剧院 (Tanztheater Wuppertal)在行动中，对表演者之间的重叠和交叉表现出类似的关注。对于更加和蔼可亲、在艺术上更加节制的戴米来说，戈达尔和阿克曼的陪伴似乎有些奇怪——但是，在《别再胡思乱想》中，他在自己的艺术创作上达到了大胆的极限。这部电影不仅见证了灵感合作的超越自我的力量，而且作为一部艺术作品，它也体现了这一点。 ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot;

data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;问答进行到一半。 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-political-scene/why-is-nikki-haley-running-for-president&quot;>;妮基·黑利&lt;/a>;市政厅的一部分本月早些时候，在新罕布什尔州梅里马克的对外战争退伍军人哨所，一位名叫特德·约翰逊的男子站起来宣布美国正在走向内战。 “那么，”他问海莉，“我怎样才能回到十九世纪八十年代的那一天，那时我很快乐，在街上跑步，骑自行车？”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;碰巧，海莉经常提起八十年代。她最近出版的书的标题取自玛格丽特·撒切尔夫人的名言，她在竞选活动中经常引用撒切尔夫人的话。上个月，在第一届共和党总统辩论上在这场辩论&lt;/a>;中，她向迄今为止最多的观众抛出了“如果你想要做某事，就去问女人”这句台词。 2 月份，黑莉竞选活动的一段视频预告片以珍妮·柯克帕特里克 (Jeane Kirkpatrick)（民主党人后来成为罗纳德·里根 (Ronald Reagan) 的新保守主义外交政策顾问）在 1984 年共和党全国代表大会上发表讲话的一段模糊片段开始。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;美国总统竞选季节非常漫长，大多数候选人通常都有机会享受“片刻”。这是尼基·黑利的：CNN 最近的大选预选赛预选赛显示，她以最大优势击败了&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tag/joe-biden&quot;>;乔·拜登&lt;/a>;共和党候选人，包括&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tag/donald-trump&quot;>;唐纳德·特朗普&lt;/a>;。在第一次辩论之后，正如《华盛顿邮报》&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2023/08/25/nikki-haley-republican-debate-competence /&quot;>;put it&lt;/a>;, Haley “won on brains and experience,” David Brooks &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/24/opinion/nikki-haley-republican- debate-winner.html&quot;>;wrote&lt;/a>; that it was time to “give Haley her chance”; even &lt;em>;The New Republic&lt;/em>; had a &lt;a href=&quot;https://newrepublic.com/article/175317/nikki-haley-2024-campaign-biden-scared&quot;>;piece&lt;/a>; about why she “scares the Biden campaign.” Haley doesn&#39;t present as an isolationist or a populist; she doesn&#39;t call the government “the regime” or compare the country to the Roman Empire in decline; at her events that I attended, she never said the word “woke,” or even “liberal” or “élites.” She favors the cliché “I&#39;ve always spoken in hard truths,” a simple bromide that manages to distinguish her in the non-Trump GOP primary lineup—not haranguing like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tag/ron-desantis&quot;>;Ron DeSantis&lt;/a>; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/vivek-ramaswamy-is-not-the-next-trump&quot;>;Vivek Ramaswamy&lt;/a>;, not as lifeless as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tag/mike-pence&quot;>;Mike Pence&lt;/a>;&#39;s comparable appeal to the golden age.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;At the Veterans of Foreign Wars post, a flashing sign at the entrance advertised a meat raffle. A former Air Force nurse had introduced Haley, who paced in flared bluejeans and a white lace sweater. When Johnson asked her how he could get back to the eighties, she took his disillusionment and wistfulness for a bygone era as an opening for a poignant yarn—the kind of story that Democrats usually tell—about a daughter of immigrants burying the Confederate flag.&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;“I don&#39;t know if y&#39;all remember, we had a horrific church shooting in South Carolina a few years ago,” she said. She recounted how, in 2015, a young white man had murdered nine Black churchgoers at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church, in Charleston, after participating in a Bible study with them. The shooter&#39;s writings called for a race war, and his Web site included photos of him with the Confederate flag; Haley decided it was time for South Carolina to take down that flag from in front of the statehouse, where it had flown since 1961. To persuade state lawmakers to vote in favor, Haley said, she told them about accompanying her father, a Sikh who taught at a historically Black college, to buy groceries on an excursion from the small town where they lived; the shopkeepers called the police when they saw her father&#39;s turban. “Every time I have to go to the airport, I have to pass that produce stand. And, every time I pass it, I feel pain. Don&#39;t make any child have to pass the statehouse and see that flag and feel pain.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;After the town hall, I sat in a folding chair next to Johnson. “I was for Trump in 2016 and 2020, but now I want unity,” he told me. “I&#39;m a Haley convert. I ordered her sign last night. Right now, I have one up for Burgum, but that&#39;s coming down.” I told him that I thought I saw him tearing up during Haley&#39;s riff about the flag. “I had totally forgot about that,” he said. “She was the one who actually got it taken down—she worked with Republicans, Democrats, faith leaders, community leaders. When I say the nineteen-eighties, Mom let me out of the house and I didn&#39;t come home until dark. Everybody liked each other, everybody was happy. Me and my wife are Independents now, and Haley&#39;s going to pull in people like us. She&#39;s going to pull moderate Democrats, too.” He went on, “You got a lot of that Trump base right here, in the backwoods. They want Hunter to pay, they want Hillary to pay. That ain&#39;t moving our country nowhere.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;“Do you remember, when you were growing up, how simple life was, how safe it felt?” Haley had asked the crowd, which applauded as she walked off to “American Girl,” by Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers. “Don&#39;t you want that again?” They did, and they do. Haley said that she raised a million dollars within seventy-two hours of the first debate, and her campaign swing through New Hampshire had a triumphant tone. During her town halls, I noticed audience members using her phrasing unprompted. (“I&#39;m here because of the debate,” one voter said, “and you told hard truths.”) Melinda Tourangeau, a Desert Storm veteran in pearls, pink lipstick, and a striped blazer, told me, “I haven&#39;t loved a politician this much since Ronald Reagan.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Haley&#39;s pitch for the future harks back to a more traditional vision of the GOP—the type of candidacy one might think the contemporary Party would have no use for—but a canny establishment conservative may be Biden&#39;s greatest threat. Haley is now tied with DeSantis for second place in the New Hampshire primary polls—Trump, of course, is first—but, more significant, she seems to hold real appeal for a swath of moderate suburban voters whom Biden needs to win. She took down the Confederate flag, isn&#39;t forthrightly hostile to transgender rights or a woman&#39;s right to choose, and sides with liberal internationalism in her support for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tag/ukraine&quot;>;Ukraine&lt;/a>;. She&#39;s the first female minority governor in the country, and she&#39;s never lost an election. Her pitch is notably inclusive: “We should want to win the majority of Americans,” she said. “Our solutions are the right ones, but you don&#39;t do it by pushing people away. You do it by opening the tent. We need more people in. We need young people, we need women, we need African Americans, we need Asians, we need Hispanics. And you don&#39;t go to them and say, &#39;You should be with us.&#39; You go to them and say, &#39;What do you care about?&#39; ”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The day before the VFW, Haley had been in Claremont, a formerly prosperous mill town by the Vermont border, for a town hall in the game room of a local senior center. A license plate pinned to the wall read “Retired: No Worry, No Hurry, No Phone, No Boss.” Nearby was a sign warning people not to fall for scams; dinner, according to a menu written in cursive on a whiteboard, would be shepherd&#39;s pie. Haley walked in wearing a blue striped blouse and white, open-toe espadrilles that showed a light-pink pedicure. The event was small; there weren&#39;t more than ten attendees per reporter.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Haley usually opens her stump speech with an abbreviated family origin story: the only Indians in a two-stoplight South Carolina town—“We weren&#39;t white enough to be white, we weren&#39;t Black enough to be Black”—where her parents told her how blessed they were to be in America. She talks about dropping off her husband, a combat veteran, at four in the morning for a yearlong deployment to Africa. She points out that, before politics, she was an accountant who graduated from a public university. (No law school, no Ivy League.) She always says, “The first thing we&#39;re going to have to tackle is this national self-loathing that has taken over our country”—a callback to Kirkpatrick&#39;s “Blame America first” speech, in which she said that the American people understand “the dangers of endless self-criticism and self-denigration.” Haley likes to conclude by insisting that she&#39;s glad to have been underestimated for her entire life: “It makes me scrappy.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;She also musters bits of jovial, canned banter without inducing the cringe of Pence or DeSantis, or, for that matter, the current President. She makes an attentive, active-listening face, smiles, and doesn&#39;t interrupt; she stopped mid-sentence to say “Bless you” to someone who sneezed in the back of the room. She held a voter&#39;s crying baby and stayed late to talk to the local cops manning the event. Two women next to me debriefed: “That was great—someone who actually accomplished something.” Two school-age kids wanted Haley&#39;s autograph, and, when they got to the front of the line, she knelt down to confer with them at length before signing “God bless you” into their notebooks.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;rblpljs&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;azs7qi&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;GOP events in New Hampshire aren&#39;t just attended by Republicans looking for a post-Trump candidate; many of the audience members were Democrats and Independents listening closely to see if they could find an alternative to Biden. At the town hall in Claremont, I talked to Barre Pinske, who wore turquoise, horn-rimmed glasses. “I&#39;m an artist, a sculptor, so I should be a Democrat,” he said. “I like Obama and Reagan. Obama was cool, he could ride around with Jerry Seinfeld, and Reagan was a man&#39;s man. I&#39;m not married and I don&#39;t have kids, but I have family values. All that sort of stuff matters to me. So just because I&#39;m a free spirit, I still have a nostalgic, American kind of perspective.” He went on, “The Republican Party is messed up, and, if someone doesn&#39;t come in as more centrist, the Republicans have no chance to win. I would like to see them get somebody who can get those swing voters. I&#39;m the kind of voter they&#39;re looking for, and I&#39;m drinking the Haley Kool-Aid.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Haley is the only female candidate in the GOP primary, a fact that many voters in New Hampshire told me, unbidden, they were drawn to. When Haley declared her candidacy, back in February, Don Lemon was benched from CNN for saying that, at fifty-one, she was “past her prime.” (Afterward, Haley said that she raised twenty-five thousand dollars for her campaign by selling beer koozies that read “&lt;em >;PAST MY PRIME&lt;/em>;?”) Pinske told me, “She brings a maternal spirit to a leadership position.” Haley mostly comes across as hawkish and tough, but she does occasionally embrace a certain maternal energy. Of South Carolina, post-shooting, she said, “I had to put my arms around my state and protect her.” Later: “I think we need a mom in the White House.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;At the Vets post in Merrimack, her hawkishness had the crowd cheering. A man named Paul in an American-flag T-shirt told me, “I want somebody willing to pull the nuclear trigger with China. Get it over with, even if it would be the end of us. Margaret Thatcher, Golda Meir—we need somebody tough.” Haley&#39;s international experience appeals: a former Army nurse named Barbara Healey said, “We could have Russia, China, North Korea banging on our door—we need someone who can deal with that.” The audience loves when Haley says that being the UN Ambassador allowed her to take the “Kick Me” sign off America&#39;s back. I wondered how her interventionist policy in Ukraine would play, given that Trump, DeSantis, and Ramaswamy all want less US involvement. She pitched giving weapons and money to Ukraine as a short-term patriotic duty; a quick end to the war would keep veterans like her husband from going to fight, and be a display of strength to China and Russia.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;When asked about post-Roe America, Haley responds with a display of equivocation that avoids alienating most pro-life voters while also managing to bring in liberals. “I&#39;m going to tell you my hard truth, because I don&#39;t think Americans get the truth on this situation,” she said, in Merrimack. “I don&#39;t judge anyone who&#39;s pro-choice.” She mentioned a college roommate who was raped; she talks about her husband&#39;s adoption and her own difficulty conceiving. Haley&#39;s appeals to consensus—“Can&#39;t we all agree?”—save her from the extremes that would lose her votes, but also reveal to some a crucial lack of conviction on issues that should define her. “The paradox is that she says all of this stuff, but she&#39;ll still campaign and vote for Trump when it comes to it,” Stuart Stevens, a former Republican political consultant, told me. “This is somebody who has courted and said positive things about the most right-wing elements of the Party. The differences between Haley and Marjorie Taylor Greene are ultimately purely aesthetic, but I don&#39;t think MTG is reading polls to remind her of her deeply felt beliefs. There&#39;s a frivolousness to Haley running for President and trying to please everybody.” Haley frames this differently, as a “story of addition.” Shortly after announcing her candidacy, she told Bari Weiss, “There&#39;s a reason that I&#39;m more likely to win a general election than anyone else. It&#39;s because I identify with &lt;em>;so&lt;/em>; many different people.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;After the Vets post, Haley visited the Founders Academy, a charter school in Manchester, to do a town hall with Tiffany Justice, a founder of the conservative advocacy group &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/11/07/the-right-wing-mothers-fuelling-the-school-board-wars&quot;>;Moms for Liberty&lt;/a>;. Beforehand, she sat at a roundtable with the school principal, some teachers, and a couple of moms running for the local school board. In the sweltering classroom, a poster with an inspirational quote—“Life Is Tough, My Darling, but So Are You”—hung next to the works of Shakespeare arranged by color. One of the moms at the table fanned her baby with a pocket Constitution. Haley kept it boring. “We don&#39;t want Democrat and Republican parents,” she said. “We want all parents. Don&#39;t all parents want transparency?” During the town hall, held in the school library, a press photographer sitting on a shelf crashed through it, sending colored pencils flying everywhere. Haley told a story about how, when she was in seventh grade, her dad didn&#39;t sign her sex-ed permission slip, so she had to sit in a room alone during the course. “That&#39;s not for the schools to decide,” she said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Haley said that Biden had called her out as a “&lt;em >;MAGA&lt;/em>; extremist” for doing an event with Moms for Liberty. “Then count me as one of them!” she joked. She presented as traditional, not extreme, making all the points that conservatives want to hear without devolving into a full-time battle with Disney or promising to abolish the Department of Education, in the bellicose vein of DeSantis and Ramaswamy. She managed the same thing with transgender questions as she did with abortion, at times coming across as almost progressive compared with most other GOP candidates. “I believe in freedom,” Haley said. “If an adult decides that they want to transition, they are welcome to do that.” (Recently, even Trump seems to sense danger in taking uncompromising positions on these matters: he called DeSantis&#39;s abortion ban a “terrible mistake” and told Megyn Kelly that he&#39;d heard a man can now give birth.) At the senior center, Haley had reminded the crowd that Republicans have lost the popular vote in seven of the past eight Presidential elections, and that seventy-eight per cent of parents don&#39;t think their children will have a better life than they did. By acquitting herself with Moms for Liberty while toeing a moderate line, her subtle rebuttal of Biden was the idea that this all &lt;em>;could&lt;/em>; be simple again, not a forever war between progressives and extremists. Haley shared an anecdote that she often rolls out on the campaign trail, recalling her mother&#39;s advice to her when she was teased in school for being Indian: “Your job isn&#39;t to show them how you&#39;re different. Your job is to show them how you&#39;re similar.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In Claremont, during a Q. &amp;amp; A., a voter named Dale Giles mistook Haley for Tulsi Gabbard. After Haley clarified that she wasn&#39;t, Giles still launched into his critique: “It seems like you have an axe to grind with Trump. I&#39;ve got nothing but the utmost respect for you.” Giles wore a Dodge hat and a shirt styled to resemble the Walmart label that read “Biden: Pay More. Live Worse”; his cell phone was ringing loudly in his pocket. He had more of a comment than a question, concluding by suggesting that Haley pick South Dakota&#39;s governor, Kristi Noem, as her running mate. (“I think that means you&#39;re a fan of women!” Haley responded.) Afterward, Giles went up to take a photo with Haley, and they spoke for several minutes. I asked for his impression of the candidate who minutes ago he thought was somebody else. “I&#39;d love to see Joe take her behind the barn,” he said, smiling and pausing for effect as I waited to see where he was going with it. “And let her kick his ass.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Even if Haley has the best chance against Biden, it doesn&#39;t mean that she&#39;ll be the Republican nominee. (In New Hampshire, being tied for second with DeSantis still means that they&#39;re both losing to Trump by thirty-seven points.) To the base “in the backwoods,” as Johnson, the eighties nostalgist, calls the &lt;em >;MAGA&lt;/em>; hard-liners, Haley is the archetypal striving representative of the globalist, anti-populist, corporate wing of the Party. In a &lt;em>;Times&lt;/em>; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/15/opinion/nikki-haley-president.html&quot;>;roundtable&lt;/a>; called “Nikki Haley Will Not Be the Next President,” Daniel McCarthy, the conservative columnist, wrote that she is “too representative of the party elite&#39;s desires to be seen as a plausible tribune of the working class.” (At the debate, Ramaswamy wished Haley well in her “future career on the boards of Lockheed and Raytheon.”) She&#39;s clearly sensitive to this flaw in her image as a candidate; on a podcast, asked to name the last book she had read, she offered “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Hillbilly-Elegy-Memoir-Family-Culture/dp/0062300547&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Hillbilly-Elegy-Memoir-Family-Culture/dp/0062300547&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Hillbilly-Elegy-Memoir-Family-Culture/dp/0062300547&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;Hillbilly Elegy&lt;/a>;,” by JD Vance. “Nikki is running for an endowed chair at the Atlantic Council, not a Presidential nomination,” Tucker Carlson told me. “She&#39;s not trying to win Trump voters. She&#39;s doing something stealthier and more difficult, which is to make professional-class Trump haters forget that, just a few years ago, she worked for him. How many other Trump Cabinet secretaries would the average NPR listener conceivably vote for? Nikki&#39;s the only one.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Haley is gently pitching herself as the one to move the Party beyond Trump—“We have to elect a &lt;em>;new&lt;/em>; conservative leader”—without denouncing him too much, but, in Claremont, she was dogged by demands to articulate her allegiance to the former President. “People are wondering if you were lying when you raised your hand at the debate to say you would support President Trump even if he was in jail,” Giles said. “Can you raise your hand with us now to say that you would support President Trump?” Haley is nimble at pivoting when it comes to what may be the most consequential stance in this race, for those who actually want to win—the precarious Trump line. She reminded voters that she was able to leave the Trump Administration “without a tweet,” dignity intact. Great as the eighties may have been, Haley&#39;s pragmatic equivocation might be her best weapon; she understands the “hard truth” of the one real deciding factor about whether a moment can last. Her way out of the yes or no, hand up or down for Trump? “I speak hard truths,” she replied, smiling. ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;c1jlo&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 20 Sep 2023 01:06:01 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Republican Support for the U.A.W.

data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;美国汽车工人联合会罢工现已进入第二个日历周，并且密歇根州和其他地方的共和党人正在上演一场荒谬的政治游戏。经过多年代表大企业的利益并抵制工会支持的立法后，他们声称自己是一个关心罢工汽车工人利益的政党。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;正如您所预料的，&lt;a href =&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tag/donald-trump&quot;>;唐纳德·特朗普&lt;/a>;正在领衔这场表演。上周末，他告诉 NBC 新闻，“汽车工人被他们的领导层出卖了，他们的领导层应该支持特朗普。”他和其他共和党人抓住了这样一个论点，即拜登政府推动电动汽车 (EV) 是对该国汽车工人的背叛，他们大多数在制造汽油车或其零部件的工厂工作。&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;最后一周，我&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/the-uaw-strike-threat-poses-a-tricky-political-challenge-for-biden&quot;>;写了&lt;/ a>; UAW 争端给拜登带来了棘手的政治挑战，拜登必须处理其具有里程碑意义的绿色能源政策与对有组织劳工的同情之间的紧张关系。周五在白宫，拜登为罢工的汽车工人辩护，并呼吁汽车制造商确保“创纪录的企业利润意味着美国汽车工人联合会创纪录的合同”。白宫还宣布将派遣拜登高级顾问吉恩·斯珀林(Gene Sperling)，代理劳工部长朱莉·苏 (Julie Su) 前往底特律。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;与此同时，特朗普和共和党人看到了推翻密歇根州的机会，这位前总统在 2016 年以微弱优势赢得了密歇根州。他们也着眼于四届民主党议员黛比·斯塔贝诺 (Debbie Stabenow) 将于 2025 年 1 月腾出美国参议院席位。 Politico &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2023/09/17/republicans-uaw-strike- electoral-gains-00116443&quot;>;报道&lt;/a>;，全国共和党参议院委员会发表声明，声称竞选接替斯塔贝诺的民主党女议员埃丽莎·斯洛特金“通过投票禁止汽油汽车，选择了她的政党而不是密歇根州。 ” （该声明提到斯洛特金上周投票反对众议院共和党法案，该法案将阻止各州限制汽油动力汽车销售的努力。）甚至连著名工人阶级论坛的前副总统迈克·彭斯（Mike Pence）也发表了看法。民主党在去年的《通货膨胀削减法案》中为购买电动汽车提供了巨额补贴。彭斯对 CNN 表示：“利用纳税人的钱推动我们的汽车经济转向电动汽车，这会给 UAW 成员带来极大的焦虑，这是可以理解的。”&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;政治就是政治，但共和党资深人士冒充工会工人的真正朋友的景象实在是太奇怪了，几乎是滑稽的。自特朗普以来，共和党几十年来一直站在雇主一边，并试图挫败工会组织工作场所和提高工资的努力。尽管共和党试图将自己重新定位为工人政党，但它的行动却嘲笑了这一主张。&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;从特朗普开始。 2017年掌权后，他恢复了共和党在五人国家劳工关系委员会中的多数席位，该机构是在新政期间成立的，旨在支持工人组织和集体谈判的权利。特朗普任命前众议院共和党工作人员马文·卡普兰 (Marvin Kaplan) 为国家劳工关系委员会 (NLRB) 主席。在共和党的领导下，该机构迅速采取行动，推翻了奥巴马政府期间发布的几项支持劳工的裁决，其中包括一项让工人快速获得便利的裁决。 - 组织食品特许经营。这种支持雇主的倾向在特朗普整个任期内持续存在。 2019 年 12 月，该机构发布了两项裁决，对工会投票引入了新的限制，并使公司更容易将工人归类为独立承包商，从而剥夺了他们的工会工资标准和福利。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;对比这一记录拜登领导下的国家劳工关系委员会采取了行动，拜登任命两名前工会律师为董事会成员，另一名前工会律师詹妮弗·阿布鲁佐 (Jennifer Abruzzo) 担任总法律顾问。在过去几年中，该机构废除了特朗普时代的许多裁决，包括与投票程序和独立承包商有关的裁决。上个月，国家劳工委员会裁定，如果一家公司在工会选举期间有恐吓行为，例如解雇工会组织者，该机构将命令该公司承认工会并进行集体谈判。在另一项裁决中，国家劳工委员会制定了工会投票的新规则，要求及时举行投票，并限制雇主拖延投票的行为，这种情况很常见。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;同情工会的劳工活动家和评论员赞扬这些决定。为《美国前景》撰稿，Harold Meyerson &lt;a href=&quot;https://prospect.org/labor/2023-08-28-bidens-nlrb-brings-workers-rights-back/&quot;>;称赞国家劳工关系委员会的反恐吓法令是“几十年来最重要的裁决”。迈耶森补充道，这两项裁决的共同发布“有效地使工会组织再次成为可能，几十年来，雇主的非法行为不受惩罚，是导致国家私营部门工会化率从大约 35% 降至仅 6% 的最决定性因素”随着工会化率稳步下降，大多数共和党人一直反对扭转这一趋势的立法努力，其中包括两项将使工会更容易组织起来的法案：民主党控制的众议院于 2007 年通过了《雇员自由选择法案》，众议院于 2019 年和 2021 年再次通过了《保护组织权 (&lt;em>;PRO&lt;/em>;) 法案》。（后一种情况） ，五位共和党人投票支持该法案；两百零五位没有投票。）&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;引用一句老话，行胜于言。周五，斯洛特金众议员前往密歇根州韦恩市的一家福特装配厂，并与一些罢工的 UAW 工人进行了交谈。密歇根州民主党参议员加里·彼得斯和宾夕法尼亚州民主党参议员约翰·费特曼也出现在纠察线上。伯尼·桑德斯在底特律举行的美国汽车工人联合会集会上谴责“企业贪婪”。那么特朗普和彭斯以及其他共和党 UAW 的坚定支持者呢？到目前为止，他们明显缺席。周一，《泰晤士报》&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/18/us/politics/trump-detroit-debate.html&quot;>;报道&lt;/a >; 特朗普计划于 9 月 27 日（第二场共和党候选人辩论当天）访问底特律，并向包括汽车工人在内的一群工人发表讲话。他受到什么样的接待还有待观察。 UAW 主席肖恩·费恩 (Shawn Fain) 在《泰晤士报》发表后发表的一份声明中表示：“我们工会的每一分力量都投入到与亿万富翁阶级和以牺牲工人为代价来让唐纳德·特朗普等人致富的经济中。” >; 故事出现了。 ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot;

aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;该交易的条款甚至在周一早上交易之前就引发了批评。作为五名美国人的交换，美国释放了&lt;a href=&quot;https://iranprimer.usip.org/blog/2023/sep/18/iran-us-prisoner-swap-profiles&quot;>;五名伊朗人&lt;/a >;——四人因与可用于军事目的的违反制裁物资有关而被拘留，另一人因涉嫌未登记为伊斯兰共和国外国代理人而被拘留。只有两人想返回伊朗。伊朗外交部&lt;a href=&quot;https://iranprimer.usip.org/blog/2023/sep/18/iran-us-prisoner-swap-profiles&quot;>;承认&lt;/ a>; 星期一。另一个将与第三国的亲戚团聚。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;该交易中最具争议的部分是&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tag/joe-biden&quot;>;拜登政府&lt;同意发布豁免，以便韩国可以转移其因过去购买石油而欠伊朗的 60 亿美元冻结资产。条款规定，这些资金将存入卡塔尔永久控制的受限账户，该账户将监督和支付伊朗指定的人道主义物资采购，如食品、医疗、教育和农产品。 （多年来，伊朗进口了&lt;a href=&quot;https://qz.com/91152/the-us-has-sent-nearly-2-million-worth-of-bull-sperm-to-iran-this-year ”价值数十万美元&lt;/a>;的&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/02/magazine/02IRAN-t.html&quot;>;公牛精液&lt;/a>;美国饲养奶牛。）一位美国高级官员周日告诉记者，不会有任何资金进入伊朗。他说：“这个渠道的设计明确是为了防止洗钱、滥用亚洲和美国的制裁。” “如果伊朗试图转移资金或将其用于除授权的有限人道主义目的之外的任何用途，我们将采取行动锁定资金。”美国财政部还将对伊朗的所有指定采购进行监督。预计这些资金将在数年内使用，而不是立即全部使用。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;共和党和民主党总统过去都曾进行过囚犯或人质交换，但共和党人谴责了与伊朗的协议条款。德克萨斯州共和党参议员特德·克鲁兹称这 60 亿美元是“赎金”。其他人则指责伊朗将能够腾出人道主义采购所需的 60 亿美元，并将其用于军事或其他邪恶目的。 “伊朗领导人会拿着钱逃跑，”阿肯色州共和党参议员汤姆·科顿 (Tom Cotton) &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://twitter.com/SenTomCotton/status/1701626584405287410&quot;

target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;上周在社交媒体上写道&lt;/a>;。 “乔·拜登到底认为会发生什么？”周一，他补充道，“作为这项可怕协议的一部分被释放的五名伊朗人中，有两人将留在美国。乔·拜登令人尴尬的绥靖政策不仅让伊朗变得更强大，也让美国变得更不安全。”在 &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/SenJohnThune/posts/pfbid02hCrVjyvwXiCySW27NKZ5oRtYbgv65yKCoVmAkSDC5ECrGvBCHA8L12GvBz3crXbNl&quot;

在电池区。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;周日的终结化石燃料游行规模并不大——代表亚历山大·奥卡西奥-科尔特斯 (Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez) 在当天结束时进行了激动人心的总结演讲，预计现场人数在五到七万人之间，组织者称有七万五千人，&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09 /17/climate/climate-protests-new-york.html&quot;>;&lt;em>;时代&lt;/em>;&lt;/a>;出现了“数万人”。但这并不重要——游行规模比组织者预期的要大得多，代表着气候活动人士真正重返街头。我沿着行军路线来回徘徊，从五十年代十字城的百老汇到联合国附近的第一大道；阳光明媚，情绪高昂，&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/children-lead-the-way-a-gallery-of-youth-made- Climate-strike-signs&quot;>;标志&lt;/a>;很聪明。 （“莱昂纳多·迪卡普里奥的女朋友应该有未来。”）&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;我认识领导游行的许多人：第三幕，我帮助成立的六十岁以上进步团体，从俄亥俄州、宾夕法尼亚州、佛蒙特州、康涅狄格州、新罕布什尔州、马萨诸塞州以及纽约各地；还有一些经验丰富的组织者，例如嘻哈核心小组的伦诺克斯·耶尔伍德牧师和&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-new-yorker-interview/naomi-klein-sees- uncanny-doubles-in-our-politics&quot;>;Naomi Klein&lt;/a>;，她从新书巡演中抽出时间参加新发布的“&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/ Doppelganger-Trip-into-Mirror-World/dp/0374610320&quot;

As it turns out, Teilhard&#39;s theology of cosmic spiritual progress is a useful way to understand the challenges that Francis is currently facing, as he and the Church prepare for a global synod next month in Rome. There, three hundred and sixty-three clerical and lay leaders representing two rival conceptions of the Church will encounter one another for several weeks of behind-closed-doors dialogue—a process that is meant to be amicable but may lead to open conflict prior to a second session next October.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The main question surrounding the Pope&#39;s journey was “Why Mongolia?” The country, with a population of around 3.3 million, has only fifteen hundred Catholics, fewer than in a large parish in Chicago—and far fewer than in other Asian nations, such as Vietnam, which has seven million Catholics and a complex history with the Church, and may have benefitted from a papal visit. (By comparison, in early August, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tag/pope-francis&quot;>;Francis&lt;/a>; celebrated Mass in Lisbon for a million and a half congregants, many of them young people there for World Youth Day.)&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;But the trip suited Francis&#39;s stated wish for the Church to go “to the margins,” and allowed him to spend time with Giorgio Marengo, an Italian cleric who has lived for more than two decades in Mongolia, doing missionary work, such as fostering Catholic-Buddhist dialogue. In August of last year, Francis made Marengo, who is forty-nine, the youngest member of the College of Cardinals, where he is likely to be a progressive presence for decades to come. And being in Mongolia gave Francis an opportunity to direct remarks, implicitly, to the neighboring powers: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tag/russia&quot;>;Russia&lt;/a>;, whose war in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tag/ukraine&quot;>;Ukraine&lt;/a>; has occasioned a shifting and at times confusing response from him; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tag/china&quot;>;China&lt;/a>;, where the Vatican&#39;s agreement to let the government choose which priests become bishops, in exchange for tolerating the Church&#39;s presence in that nation, has been widely criticized.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The trip also expressed Francis&#39;s own long-distance interest in Asia. As a young man in Argentina, he wanted to be a missionary in Japan; then and afterward, he hoped to follow in the footsteps of influential Jesuits who spent large parts of their careers in Asia: St. Francis Xavier, Matteo Ricci, Pedro Arrupe, and Teilhard de Chardin. Born in France in 1881, Teilhard was a restless, searching figure: a priest, a poet, a stretcher-bearer in the First World War, a paleontologist based in China (where, in the nineteen-twenties, he took part in an important expedition in search of human origins), and a mystical theologian. His written work, a sustained effort to reconcile Christian theology with the theory of evolution, placed him in the vanguard of twentieth-century theology—though lately otherwise appreciative theologians have expressed concern that his emphasis on progress through evolution led him to contrast “the advancing wing of humanity” with “definitively unprogressive ethnical groups,” thus aligning himself with movements in support of race-based eugenics. Teilhard&#39;s notion that the earth would someday be surrounded by a complex information system powered by human consciousness has been seen as anticipating the Internet, and the Episcopal homilist at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/photo-booth/outside-windsor-castles-walls-during-prince-harry-and-meghan-markles-wedding&quot;>;Prince Harry&#39;s wedding&lt;/a>; to Meghan Markle, in 2018, alluded to one of Teilhard&#39;s aphorisms: “Someday, after mastering the winds, the waves, the tides, and gravity, we shall harness for God the energies of love, and then, for a second time in the history of the world, man will have discovered fire.” But Teilhard&#39;s most memorable concept is the notion that “&lt;em>;tout ce qui monte&lt;/em>;, &lt;em>;converge&lt;/em>;,” or “everything that rises must converge”—that the various forces of natural evolution and human civilization are all ascending in a pattern of spiritual progress and will converge in a “Point Omega” at the end of time.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;While doing field work in Mongolia, in 1923, Teilhard celebrated what he called a Mass on the World; lacking bread and wine to consecrate in the usual fashion, he simply consecrated the whole physical world, represented by the vast steppe where he stood. The Mass was expressive of Teilhard&#39;s thought, which, in 1927 and afterward, drew the attention of the Vatican, where officials objected to his dismissal of the idea that the human race descended from Adam and Eve, and his corresponding lack of emphasis on the idea of original sin.&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;During the next three decades, Teilhard elaborated on his outlook in a number of essays and two books, “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Divine-Milieu-Newly-revised-Translation-Cowell/dp/1903900581&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Divine-Milieu-Newly-revised-Translation-Cowell/dp/1903900581&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Divine-Milieu-Newly-revised-Translation-Cowell/dp/1903900581&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;The Divine Milieu&lt;/a>;” and “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Phenomenon-Harper-Perennial-Modern-Thought/dp/0061632651&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Phenomenon-Harper-Perennial-Modern-Thought/dp/0061632651&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Phenomenon-Harper-Perennial-Modern-Thought/dp/0061632651&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;The Phenomenon of Man&lt;/a>;.” The Vatican and his Jesuit superiors forbade him to publish any theological writing, but he remained a faithful Catholic and an obedient Jesuit. Following a visit to the US in 1948, he settled in a Jesuit residence in New York City, where he died in 1955, on Easter Sunday—and the posthumous publication of his work began. During the Second Vatican Council, which first convened in 1962, criticism of his work eased, and his books became standard texts for progressive theologians—until they fell out of favor again, under the traditionalist Popes John Paul II and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/benedict-xvis-most-powerful-influence-on-the-catholic-church-came-before-he-was-pope&quot;>;Benedict XVI&lt;/a>;, even as they personally spoke warmly of him from time to time.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;This Pope, however, has looked emphatically to Teilhard as an example. In “Laudato Si,” his landmark encyclical on the climate, from 2015—he is expected to issue another one next month—he cited Teilhard as an inspiration. After celebrating Sunday Mass in Mongolia, Francis spoke ardently about Teilhard, on the centenary of the Mass that he celebrated there. “This priest, often misunderstood,” he said, “intuited that &#39;the Eucharist is always in some way celebrated on the altar of the world.&#39; ” The Pope was bringing the priest back from the margins, and joining his own Asian journey to Teilhard&#39;s.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Francis&#39;s trademark style of discourse is to issue an offhand comment that is clearly on the side of progress, but to remain vague about how progress is to be achieved, and this tendency, too, has lately sparked controversy. Following a video call with young Russian Catholics, on August 25th, in which Francis urged them to connect with their roots in the “Great Russia of saints, rulers, Great Russia of Peter I, Catherine II, that empire—great, enlightened, of great culture and great humanity,” Archbishop Sviatoslav Shevchuk, the head of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church, immediately castigated the Pope for celebrating Russian imperialism past and present. Then the Jesuit journal &lt;em>;La Civiltà Cattolica&lt;/em>; published a partial transcript of a conversation that Francis had with Portuguese Jesuits during his trip earlier that month. When one asked about the open criticism of him by some American Catholics, including bishops, Francis replied at length. “You have seen that in the United States the situation is not easy: there is a very strong reactionary attitude. It is organized and shapes the way people belong, even emotionally,” he said. “I would like to remind those people that &lt;em>;indietrismo&lt;/em>;”—backwardness—“is useless, and we need to understand that there is an appropriate evolution in the understanding of matters of faith.” He later added, “Those American groups you talk about, so closed, are isolating themselves. Instead of living by doctrine, by the true doctrine that always develops and bears fruit, they live by ideologies.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Which American groups, everyone wanted to know, was Francis talking about? In the &lt;em>;Times&lt;/em>;, C. Preston Noell III, of the American Society for the Defense of Tradition, Family, and Property (a Pennsylvania-based offshoot of a Brazilian group founded in 1960 to resist supposed communist influence on the Church), pointed out that Francis has spent less than a week in the United States as Pope, suggesting that he is poorly informed about the life of the Church here. The Washington &lt;em>;Post&lt;/em>; ran a dossier of suspects, among them Raymond Arroyo, a host on the traditionalist Catholic cable network EWTN, based in Alabama, who has personified the network&#39;s opposition to Francis. Others pointed to Cardinal Raymond Burke, who served as the archbishop of St. Louis and then as a Vatican official, until he was removed from one post in 2014 and replaced in a different one earlier this year. In the foreword to a &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Synodal-Process-Pandoras-Box-Questions/dp/1877905771&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Synodal-Process-Pandoras-Box-Questions/dp/1877905771&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Synodal-Process-Pandoras-Box-Questions/dp/1877905771&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;new book&lt;/a>;, Burke writes that the October synod will cause “confusion and error” and lead to “the grave harm of many souls.” The book has been published in eight languages by the Society for the Defense of Tradition, Family, and Property, which has sent copies to bishops and clergy, some of whom will be delegates to the synod.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;a16dn&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;nxwq5&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;It&#39;s likely that these are some of the people Francis had in mind when he spoke to the Jesuits in Portugal. But it&#39;s perhaps more instructive to look at his remarks in terms of American Catholicism&#39;s place in the recent history of Catholicism globally. And this is where the notion that “everything that rises must converge” is apt. A century ago “modernism” and “Americanism” were synonymous in the eyes of Catholic Rome. Vatican II&#39;s affirmation of the principle of religious freedom was rooted in the work of the American Jesuit political philosopher John Courtney Murray. The trip that Pope Paul VI made to New York City, in October, 1965—when he spoke at St. Patrick&#39;s Cathedral, met President Johnson at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, addressed the UN General Assembly, celebrated Mass at Yankee Stadium, and visited the World&#39;s Fair, all in a single day—was arguably the high point of his pontificate. The vernacular liturgy, the modern angular church architecture, the emphasis on amity with other Christian churches and other faiths that came after Vatican II were all a good fit with the populous, influential, flexible, and prosperous American Church. John Paul II, elected in October, 1978, gained iconic stature in two early visits to the US, and was lionized by President Ronald Reagan; John Paul remained hugely popular among American Catholics, even as many disagreed with or distanced themselves from particular positions he took.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;John Paul and a deputy of his, Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, also reshaped the US clergy and hierarchy in their image, promoting men who were fiercely orthodox and squarely against homosexuality and abortion. American cardinals—John O&#39;Connor, in New York; Bernard Law, in Boston; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/what-the-new-vatican-report-shows-about-the-churchs-failure-to-address-sexual-abuse&quot;>;Theodore McCarrick&lt;/a>;, in Newark and Washington, DC—enjoyed exceptional access to the Pope. As Ratzinger succeeded John Paul, becoming Benedict XVI, Timothy Dolan, in New York, Charles Chaput, in Philadelphia, and José Gómez, in Los Angeles, succeeded them as figures whose stature at the Vatican gave them stature in the American Church, and vice versa. As Catholicism was losing influence in Europe and Latin America, in the US it was gaining influence on public policy, a development that would culminate in the reversal of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tag/roe-v-wade&quot;>;Roe v. Wade&lt;/a>;. It wasn&#39;t a stretch to imagine that an American might be elected Pope—Cardinal Dolan, say, whose name showed up on shortlists after Benedict resigned, in 2013.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Instead, the Jesuit cardinal of Buenos Aires was elected. And not only has this first Pope from the Americas shown no special regard for the US; the American Church has become the church that stands between Francis and his vision of Catholicism. That vision is dedicated to the poor and determined to go to the world&#39;s margins, and devoted to the God of “nearness, proximity,” confident that, as Teilhard put it, “God is not remote from us. He is at the point of my pen, my pick, my paintbrush, my needle—and my heart and my thoughts.” The rise of traditionalist American Catholicism, that is, has met with the rise of a progressive Latin American Pontiff, whose vision is focussed on the Global South.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;All of this is prelude to the coming reckoning at next month&#39;s synod. The familiar narrative is that Francis&#39;s age—he will turn eighty-seven in December—is giving urgency to his efforts to foster progress in the Church. But the aging of the American traditionalists is just as significant. Cardinal-archbishops (the ones who head big-city archdioceses) are required to submit their resignations upon reaching seventy-five, and those who are allowed to stay on can no longer vote in the College of Cardinals for a new Pope once they turn eighty. Cardinal Burke is seventy-five; Cardinal Dolan, who will be a delegate at the synod, is seventy-three. There is cause for the traditionalists to worry that Francis will lead the Church into his nineties (as Benedict might have done, had he not retired unexpectedly at age eighty-five) and then yield the papacy to a successor chosen by younger cardinals whom he has appointed. For the traditionalists, then, the synod is something like a last stand, where the legacy of two Popes just past will converge with the determination of the present one. ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;q5sq0c&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 19 Sep 2023 01:06:01 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Jeremy O.

Harris was living in a two-story apartment in London. He had travelled there for a production of his play “Daddy,” about a young Black artist who has fallen under the thrall of an older white man. “Daddy” had débuted, Off Broadway, a year before, and was set to open at the Almeida Theatre at the end of March, 2020; it would have been Harris&#39;s first professional opening overseas. But the show didn&#39;t open, and Harris stayed stranded in London for weeks, then, eventually, for months.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Sad about the play and scared about the world, he passed the first few weeks not writing—although many deadlines, constant companions in his life, hovered at the peripheries of his mind. Since high school, Harris has used the late night and earliest morning as a time to work and party and talk about art with friends; now he binged anime and listened to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/03/23/fiona-apples-art-of-radical-sensitivity&quot;>;Fiona Apple&lt;/a>; and started reading Audre Lorde&#39;s “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Sister-Outsider-Speeches-Crossing-Feminist/dp/1580911862/&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Sister-Outsider-Speeches-Crossing-Feminist/dp/1580911862/&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Sister-Outsider-Speeches-Crossing-Feminist/dp/1580911862/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;Sister Outsider&lt;/a>;,” which he&#39;d always meant to get to. As the weeks wore on, he tired of his vampirism. “I decided that I wanted to see the sun more often,” he said one April morning, as streams of light made bright rectangles on the apartment walls. Waking up at normal hours meant dealing with pedestrian annoyances. He&#39;d begun ordering coffee from a nearby café, and twice in a row, although he ordered it black, it was delivered with milk. “It&#39;s, like, everyone&#39;s watching &#39;The Plot Against America,&#39; ” he said, referring to the HBO miniseries based on the novel by Philip Roth, “and this feels very much like &#39;The Plot Against Jeremy.&#39; ”&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Harris is very tall and very thin, and handles his body with improvised precision, formality within informality, like a dancer on an off day at the mall. A gesture begun in his shoulder always ends at the tips of his fingers. When he gropes for thoughts between sentences, he makes shapes in the air with his hands. He has clear cedar skin and a pert, wide mouth. His eyes are sedate and low-lidded when he&#39;s in a neutral mood, but they open wide when he tells a story or expresses an urgent (often dissenting) opinion. Stories sometimes incite him to stand up and pantomime crucial passages of action. His first dream, before writing, was to act.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;When the third coffee came, finally correct, he sat on a couch by a window and lit a cigarette. Lots of people he knew were smoking again, he said, despite the worldwide march of a deadly respiratory disease: “Our lungs could fail us at any moment, and we&#39;re just, like, you know, fuck it.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Coffee and an American Spirit, white light through the window—his instinct about waking with the sun had been borne out. The apartment was pleasant in the daytime. On one wall was a large abstract painting in russets and burgundies and bright lipstick shades. Upstairs was a bedroom that he shared with his newish boyfriend, Arvand Khosravi, a film and television executive. At the top of the staircase was a glass door leading out to a shallow ledge on the roof, where Harris often went to film TikTok videos—mostly poppy, fast-paced riffs on scenes from classic plays—which he had been posting almost daily. In one, titled “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://twitter.com/jeremyoharris/status/1246604978346754049&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://twitter.com/jeremyoharris/status/1246604978346754049&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jeremyoharris/status/1246604978346754049&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;Titus Andronicus Act V&lt;/a>;,” he lip-synchs dialogue from the TV show “Catfish,” in four different costumes; it&#39;s nine seconds long.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Harris did the TikToks for fun; they were, for weeks, his sole avenue of creative expression. But they were also, not so subtly, a dig at the profession through which he had gained his recent fame. Rooted in the history and the canonical repertoire of theatre, but yoked dramaturgically to hyper-current rhythms and attitudes and styles, the TikToks showed that Harris could do what the big arts institutions couldn&#39;t—keep up. While they floundered, he figured, the show would go on from his phone. He had changed the bio on his frequently updated Twitter account to a kind of epitaph for the theatre: “I spent my 20s devoted to a craft in a coma.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Stages everywhere were dark; theatre companies and nonprofits were scrambling. In both their public statements and their private conversations with playwrights, they projected blithe optimism, as though their operations would be up and running by summer&#39;s end.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Like, no, guys!” Harris said, describing his frustration. “We have to reinvent this or re-create this, or else it&#39;s going to be even more detrimental to artists in six months, when you guys have wasted your resources trying to go the normal way.” “Daddy” was still in British limbo, and he had another play, “A Boy&#39;s Company Presents: &#39;Tell Me If I&#39;m Hurting You&#39; ”—his version of a Jacobean revenge drama, based on a particularly bad breakup—scheduled to début in May, at Playwrights Horizons, in New York. Nobody would officially admit—or, perhaps, allow themselves to believe—that the upcoming seasons wouldn&#39;t happen, but Harris was already mourning the new play, just as he was mourning “Daddy.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;His ire notwithstanding, thinking and talking about the failures of his industry seemed to energize him—almost to soothe him—and his online complaints soon came to echo a wider mood. As the initial shock of the pandemic gave way to a reëvaluation of racial and other societal arrangements, Harris became a kind of spokesman for the long-standing and suddenly stark unrest felt by his fellow-artists. It was a moment well suited to Harris&#39;s natural, if somewhat paradoxical, penchant for institutional critique. A happy disrupter of genteel silences, he has nonetheless, however rockily, charted a professional and personal path through some of the entertainment world&#39;s most staid establishment outposts: the Yale School of Drama; Gucci, for which he does modelling; various Hollywood-adjacent neighborhoods in Los Angeles; and now, most visibly, the Great White Way. The previous fall, “Slave Play,” the first of Harris&#39;s works to be staged in New York, had transferred to the Golden Theatre, on Broadway, after an extended run at the venerable New York Theatre Workshop, downtown.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Slave Play” tells the story of three interracial couples undergoing “antebellum sexual-performance therapy,” in order, presumably, to mend the edges of their relationships, which have been frayed by race. In the first act, before the audience is in on the premise, the couples—dressed in nineteenth-century garb, as masters and slaves—engage in various kinky sexual scenarios calibrated to set off trip wires in race- and sex-sensitive American minds. The second act, in which the actual therapy takes place, is straightforwardly funny. The third is a surreal, largely horrifying duet between one of the couples, a Black woman and her white husband. Over and over, “Slave Play” calls into question the true parameters of sexual consent and tries to wring current-day catharsis from the brutal history of master-slave rape.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;In some corners—including this magazine, in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/12/24/black-and-white-in-slave-play-and-to-kill-a-mockingbird&quot;>;review&lt;/a>; that I wrote—Harris was lauded for the wild rigor of his vision and the originality of his voice. And the play&#39;s overwhelming success was the precondition for many of the luxuries he now enjoyed: the London flat, the European engagement, a two-year development deal that he had recently signed with HBO. At the same time, “Slave Play” was a kind of troll job, perversely aimed at unsettling and possibly enraging the various constituencies—racial, sexual, institutional, professional—to which he belonged. Harris must have known that the play would have this effect; he seemed to revel in the discursive mess it left in its wake. Even before the pandemic, he had earned a reputation as an enfant terrible, the kind of designation that is made possible only by way of proximity. You&#39;ve got to be fairly close to the big house to even consider throwing stones.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Something I&#39;ve always wondered is when I&#39;m going to develop the affected-Black-intellectual voice,” Harris said that summer, still stuck in London. He was reflecting on some of his favorite writers and artists of an older generation, and the way that their talk was often as effortfully stylized as their work. He&#39;d been thinking about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1994/11/07/andre-leon-talley-vogue-the-only-one&quot;>;André Leon Talley&lt;/a>;, the fashion writer and editor whose high diction and baroque syntax became hallmarks of his style—and seemed, moreover, like a way of asserting his belonging in a largely white milieu. Talley, who died last year, was, like Harris, a tall, queer, highly verbal Black man from the South. His web of complex, sometimes tortured relationships with white co-workers, bosses, and benefactors was consonant with—and had possibly even influenced—the dynamics depicted in “Slave Play.” Harris is unabashed in his study of other artists&#39; personas. “I&#39;m so interested in personal style, and personal relationships, and class—if not class ascension, then class association,” he said. “Just the lilt of certain people.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Talk of that voice—I knew what Harris meant without having to ask—got me thinking, perhaps slightly defensively, of my own.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“You have it a little bit,” he said, confirming a fear I&#39;d spoken aloud.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;We agreed, though, that the voice of our rough age cohort—Harris is thirty-four—was particular. The sort of Black Millennial writer whom Harris had in mind was not someone who would deploy the suavely concatenated sentences of James Baldwin. Rather, this hypothetical thirtysomething, as eager to showcase pop-cultural with-it-ness and egalitarian humility as to display hard-won verbal acuity, would use locutions peppered with pointed “like”s and “um”s, plus a bit of vocal fry, for subtler tones of falsely self-deprecating color: a Valley Girl with an advanced degree.&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot;

” Harris said. “But also, partially, I think unconsciously, I did it so that my intellect wouldn&#39;t be intimidating to everyone around me. This is a part of my plays that was also a part of growing up—I&#39;ve always had to figure out how to translate stuff from the academy into language that my mom could understand, without asking her to take time from her life to read, like, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/10/26/how-saidiya-hartman-retells-the-history-of-black-life&quot;>;Saidiya Hartman&lt;/a>;.” A dramaturgical note for “Slave Play” quoted both Hartman and Hortense Spillers, another Black feminist scholar, but the play itself takes Rihanna as its primary muse. “I had to bring my learning into a different space of understanding, which is why it&#39;s so much more fun for me to write plays that are based in theory than it is for me to go, &#39;And then Jonathan wanted to get a divorce from Becca,&#39; or things like that.”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;dn7vnr&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Harris speaks in a restless tenor, alternating locomotive bursts with considered pauses; his voice is bright and brackish and warm. He talks about movies and plays and clothes and people&#39;s bodies constantly. His sentences often start with “Have you seen?” or “Have you read?” Unless he already knows, from your work—almost all his friends are artists or public people of one kind or another—that you&#39;ve seen it or read it, and what you think about it, and is prepared to gently argue. He says “yes,” encouragingly but without much emphasis, when he hears something he agrees with, never “yeah.” Two words he uses a lot are “ostensibly” and “psychotic.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Harris was raised in Martinsville, Virginia, among people who made their livings with their bodies, many of them in factories. His way with words marked him as different. His mother, Veronica Farrish, refused to let family members use baby talk with him. He taught himself to read, and was soon the kind of prematurely unimpressed kid who finds it easier to make friends with teachers than with classmates. When Harris was eight, one of his favorite pastimes, he said, was trading theories with his mother about what had happened to JonBenét Ramsey, the six-year-old pageant contestant whose murder was a tabloid bonanza in the late nineties: “I was, like, &#39;OK, I looked at this document.&#39; ”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;His early interest in true crime briefly convinced him that he wanted to be a lawyer—that standby aspiration for the precociously talkative. But after landing a part in his middle school&#39;s production of “My Fair Lady,” he realized that he possibly just wanted to play a lawyer on TV. Around the same time, Harris was realizing that he was gay, or at least different—this difference was the rare condition for which he didn&#39;t yet have the words. Another discomfort was the unsettled nature of his home life. He didn&#39;t meet his biological father until he was nine or ten; his mother married another man when Harris was four, got divorced when Harris was in middle school, then embarked on another short-lived marriage, to a military man stationed at what was then Fort Bragg, in North Carolina. Harris moved there with his mother and enrolled in a new school. “I was so upset,” he said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Harris spent much of his childhood in private Christian schools, helped by financial aid. As a result, he became comfortable with the discombobulating tension of being a poor Black kid in a largely rich, white environment. Then, in tenth grade, he got a scholarship to Carlisle, a prep school in Martinsville. In the hallways, there were pictures of each graduating class. As Harris recalls, Black faces didn&#39;t begin showing up in the photographs until the mid-nineties, when the school started a basketball team. “Everybody wanted me to play basketball,” Harris said. “And I was, like, No. I hated that so much. I was, like, I will &lt;em>;never&lt;/em>; do that.” Instead, he took up swimming and dance. He kept up his practice of befriending teachers. “Candace—and Paula, who taught in the middle school,” he recalled, “I would have coffee with them after school, and they were my friends.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;By this point, Harris was determined to be an actor. He got parts in plays and musicals and directed a production of “The Laramie Project,” Moisés Kaufman&#39;s documentary play about the aftermath of the killing of Matthew Shepard, a gay student at the University of Wyoming. His kaffeeklatsch pal Candace Owen-Williams, who taught drama at Carlisle, let him turn an empty trailer behind the school into a black-box theatre, where he and some other friends put on experimental shows. His senior thesis was a one-man production of Wallace Shawn&#39;s “The Fever.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;For college, Harris went to the acting conservatory at DePaul University, in Chicago. The program&#39;s structure was brutal: after freshman year, only half of the students were allowed to continue with the acting cohort; the others were cut, and had to pursue different fields of study if they wished to remain at the school. Harris found the first year—essentially a protracted audition—disorienting. “A lot of my teachers said that my intellect was going to get in the way of me being a real actor,” he said. “I always sort of directed or rewrote the circumstances of the scene to fit the emotional states that I wanted to play around in, to make it more interesting to me.” Part of the problem, he said, was that so many of the roles and scenes were geared toward white actors. But he internalized the message that “if you&#39;re smart, you have to hide it,” he said. “I still stand by all my choices,” he added, “because, in some ways, I made cooler theatre then than I&#39;m making now.” For an exercise in “auto-drama,” he put twenty lamps of different shapes and sizes onstage. The lamps were the only source of light in the show; each one represented a story connected to a father figure. Then, as now, Harris was seeking, and sometimes finding, masked ways to describe the absence left by his actual father. In the glow of each light, he told a version of a memory.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;After the first semester, Harris chopped his long hair, nervous about how his teachers might perceive him. When the program made its cuts, the following summer, he called his friend and classmate Erika J. Simpson. Neither had got in. They were quiet for a long time.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;alua1&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;It was June—a beautiful month in Chicago but, for Harris, who had just turned nineteen, the grim beginning of an uncertain period. He called one of his teachers to ask why he&#39;d been dismissed; she said that he wouldn&#39;t be “castable” as an actor until his thirties, and rattled off a list of reasons that felt, to him, like “gay-coded shit.” He told me, “There were four Black boys in our year, and the two that got cut were the ones that felt the femme-est.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;He started collecting issues of the Chicago &lt;em>;Reader&lt;/em>;, a free alternative newspaper whose pages he trawled for acting notices. At an audition, he broke down, crying and trembling. He explained himself to the producers—some of them had gone to DePaul; they understood—and they told him that he could step out of the room for a moment, compose himself, and try again. Instead, he just left.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Eventually, Harris got modest parts at small venues in the city. He became an English major, and briefly imagined writing poems. He was interested in the work of Ai, a mixed-race woman from Arizona whose poor upbringing reminded Harris of his own. In her poems, Ai, who died in 2010, inhabited the voices of tough, sly, vulnerable working-class people asserting their dignity—or, at least, some measure of hip and artful defiance—against the backdrop of an indifferent and often hostile world. “You say you want this story / in my own words, / but you won&#39;t tell it my way,” her poem “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/browse?volume=151&amp;amp;issue=1&amp;amp;page=14&quot;>;Interview with a Policeman&lt;/a>;,” from 1987, begins. Her work would come to influence Harris&#39;s understanding of the possibilities of monologue.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;But Harris didn&#39;t remain an English major, or a DePaul student, for long. He dropped out and, a year later, moved to Los Angeles.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;By the end of the first pandemic summer, Harris and Khosravi had left the London apartment and were driving around Europe in a car full of their stuff. Khosravi had felt too cooped up in their flat, but Harris refused to move back to the US “This is why it&#39;s hell to date me,” he said. The pair were in Naples, Italy, in mid-October, when Tony nominations were announced, on a live stream. It was evening in Italy; Harris got on FaceTime with his mom, nieces, and nephew, so that he could watch it with them. He had to hop off about four nominations in because the stream that his mom was watching was ahead of his, and she kept screaming before he&#39;d seen the news. In the end, “Slave Play” got twelve nominations, more than any non-musical production had before.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Slave Play” was a genuinely difficult piece of work, a deliberate provocation. At one post-show Q. &amp;amp; A., a white woman yelled at Harris that she didn&#39;t “want to hear that white people are the fucking problem all the time.” Some Black audience members insisted that the play was oriented toward a “white gaze,” and was a cynical exploitation of the intertwined subjects of slavery and rape. Both currents of backlash were more or less predictable. The dozen nominations seemed to indicate that Harris could start a food fight in the theatre world&#39;s living room and still be invited to sit at its dinner table.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“It emboldens me to be more forthright with my opinions and how I feel about the world, because, if I gave a fuck about what institutions were actually saying to me, the &#39;Slave Play&#39; that got twelve nominations would not be the &#39;Slave Play&#39; that got twelve nominations,” he said. “It would have been a dumber play, and a less complex play, and a less Jeremy play.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;But this institutional approbation also posed a kind of creative challenge. “I think the thing that I&#39;m trying to get over—and I&#39;ve been working on this a lot over the last year—is other people&#39;s excitement about me,” Harris said. “It&#39;s easier for me to write when I&#39;m writing from a place of, like, &#39;These people don&#39;t believe in me enough.&#39; When I have something to prove, I can write so much better.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Since his time in LA, if not before, Harris had defined himself in opposition to those around him—or, at least, those with power. He had initially made his way not in professional settings but in the more free-flowing dynamic of late-night scenes. In Chicago, he had begun to understand his personality and physical bearing as a kind of talent. He was funny and gay and six feet five; people gravitated toward him and wanted him to come to their parties. He got a job at a trendy women&#39;s boutique in Wicker Park, &lt;em >;AKIRA&lt;/em>;, where he helped clients find going-out outfits. Often, those clients would invite him to clubs. Soon, he was a night-life fixture.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“I am the No. 1 person who will tell you that I hate gay bars, because I don&#39;t have as much power there,” he told me. “Black and skinny and charismatic—it gives you much more power in a straight bar than in a gay bar. I wasn&#39;t threatening to the straight men there. And I was also a weird honeypot for the night clubs because all these fun girls would want to stick around longer to hang out, and buy more bottles, too.” Night life is a churning economy, only partially visible to most people, a system behind a veil.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;He carved out a similar space in LA, getting a day job where cool and connected people were sure to buy clothes—Barneys this time—and becoming a regular presence in the clubs. He made friends, some of them in show business, and asked around about how to find his way in the industry. Among the people he talked to at parties were important future collaborators: the writer and director Sam Levinson, the filmmaker Janicza Bravo. “I think that my verbal abilities helped me navigate the space,” he said. “And also my style. I have good-to-decent style.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Harris got small acting gigs: he starred in a short film directed by the actor James Franco; he appeared, very briefly, in the Terrence Malick movie “Song to Song.” But he hated the idea of being at the mercy of gatekeepers, who, like his teachers at DePaul, might label him uncastable. When Lena Dunham&#39;s show “Girls” débuted on HBO, in the spring of 2012, he saw her as a kindred spirit, and a role model. Watching “Girls,” he thought, “This is so perfect, and also I think I could do it.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Like Dunham—and like Ilana Glazer and Abbi Jacobson, of “Broad City,” another inspiration—Harris and Erika Simpson, his friend from DePaul, created a Web series, “#NightStrife,” and uploaded it to YouTube. “It&#39;s two twentysomethings trying to get famous,” Simpson says, by way of explanation, in the first episode. They made only a few episodes, which were not widely seen, though a tongue-in-cheek series promo of sorts, titled “Black Girl Takes a Shit,” has been watched nearly eighty thousand times.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Harris became jaded about Hollywood; he stopped acting, and stopped referring to himself as an actor. He started to call himself a playwright, though he had yet to write a play. He cast about for ideas, unsuccessfully, until he went on a date with a porn star, whose stories yielded the material for Harris&#39;s first play, “Xander Xyst, Dragon: 1,” a kind of fantasia on the theme of online celebrity. With the play—which featured music by Isabella Summers, of Florence and the Machine, another friend he&#39;d made in LA—he won a spot at the Samuel French Off-Off Broadway Short Play Festival, in 2014. There, he met a group of young playwrights who are now his contemporaries: Will Arbery, Martyna Majok, Leah Nanako Winkler, Eleanor Burgess.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Afterward, he applied for a fellowship at the MacDowell artists&#39; residency—and, when he was wait-listed, he called the administration every day until someone told him yes. At MacDowell, he met the playwright Amy Herzog, who encouraged him to apply to Yale. He&#39;d already finished a draft of “Daddy,” and he submitted it to the drama school&#39;s admissions board, along with a heartfelt essay. “The clearest memory I have of my childhood is elegantly staged,” he wrote. “Delicately, it moves in a realm between the cinematic and the theatrical: lights up on an open screen door leading into a wide hallway, my mother (early 30s) downstage paces from one off stage room to another whispering vitriol into a cordless phone, somewhere further off stage we can hear the sounds of a young girl crying, and upstage in profile I sit (12) back to back with a large suitcase looking out of the open door periodically. 。 。 。 Suddenly the crying stops replaced by The Pointer Sisters and my mother is standing with my sister in her arms in the middle of the hall tears, a smile and snot dancing on her face, &#39;He&#39;s not coming. Come on baby, let&#39;s dance,&#39; she said. So we did.”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;6a1t4b&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Harris has come to see “Daddy” as a play about furthering his career by seeking the opportunity and resources that an institution like Yale can provide. “Going to Yale was me deciding to marry a white guy on a hill and in order to have the time and space to make my work,” he &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.ssense.com/en-us/editorial/culture/oh-jeremy&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.ssense.com/en-us/editorial/culture/oh-jeremy&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.ssense.com/en-us/editorial/culture/oh-jeremy&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;told&lt;/a>; one interviewer. Elsewhere, he has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vice.com/en/article/8qgm9g/decolonizing-my-desire&quot;>;described&lt;/a>; the play as an attempt “to parse the ways I was cradled, coddled and collected by white institutions and how I&#39;ve collected and used them in turn.” He once wrote that he went to Yale with eyes open, “believing that I could take more from this place than they would take from me.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In early 2021, the demands of Harris&#39;s still fairly young renown finally called him back to New York. &lt;em>;Town &amp;amp; Country&lt;/em>; had planned a multi-page spread to showcase his newly designed home office, which had been furnished by the chic design firm Green River Project. On a cold, pewter-sky morning in January, Harris sat in a studio belonging to Aaron Aujla, one of the firm&#39;s owners, at a nondescript former warehouse in Brooklyn, getting ready to have his picture taken. Someone tended to his hair, always a foremost point of interest in the looks he puts together for magazine covers and red carpets. There were small, feathery tufts of it strewn about the studio&#39;s bright-green floor.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“I think I want just a mustache,” Harris said. He&#39;d come to the shoot with several pictures of the Japanese writer Yukio Mishima at the ready on his phone. He pulled one up: Mishima in his office, behind a desk and flanked by books, pouting fiercely at the camera, his dark brows writhing. The writer&#39;s louche, vaguely sexual gaze did have something of the solitary mustache about it.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Harris has often, with a bit of a wink—and in spite of Mishima&#39;s reactionary politics—called Mishima his favorite writer. A few months earlier, he had tweeted, “Ok guys so to combat seasonal / pandemic depression and the sense that my life moves at a pace my body can&#39;t keep up with I&#39;ve decided to do a workout every day a la my favorite writer YUKIO MISHIMA. Who combatted depression and dread w/ workouts and a failed coup d&#39;état.” In 1970, Mishima and several members of a militia that he had formed attempted to take over a Japanese military base, in the hope of inspiring an overthrow of the country&#39;s constitution. After a fiery speech, Mishima—obsessed with physical beauty and warlike vigor—killed himself with a sword. “Do I hate fascists?” Harris wrote, in another tweet. “Yes. Do I love Mishima?是的。 I&#39;m a Gemini. Two truths can be held.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Aujla puttered in and out of the studio, smiling and not saying much. He is married to the fashion designer Emily Bode, known for her knit menswear; she and Aujla are neighbors of Harris&#39;s, in Chinatown, and have become his friends. She&#39;d brought a rack of clothes for Harris to choose from. Once in a while, he&#39;d disappear behind a curtain and come out wearing a pair of fluid trousers or a lacy top or a burgundy suit, evocative of Mishima. (He selected the suit as one of his outfits.) When something tickled him, he let his voice rise to a high, smoky giggle. “That&#39;s cunt,” he sometimes said. Between costume changes, he chatted about recent movies, especially a new coming-of-age indie film that everybody seemed to like but that he couldn&#39;t bring himself to watch.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;“Arvand hates me for this,” Harris said, referring to his Hollywood-exec boyfriend, “but I can&#39;t stand this kind of shit.” He went on, “It&#39;s always that same thing: &#39;Here I am, marginalized little kid—Black, immigrant, gay, whatever—and here&#39;s the &lt;em>;wide&lt;/em>;, &lt;em>;wide world&lt;/em>;.&#39; ” By now he was acting out the archetype, hunched into a pantomime of childish wonder, his eyes big with fear, his hands clasped. “And now there&#39;s big trouble”—he cowered in terror—“and inner strife”—he anxiously trembled—“but soon”—now he let a smile spread across his face—“I overcome.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“I knew exactly what that movie was gonna be the moment it started, and I was, like, No, thank you,” he said. Bode, who has a slim face framed by twin curtains of dark hair and speaks in a soft, helpful voice, like that of an expensive therapist, laughed until her face turned pink.&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;a data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a27607&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a27607&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;Jeremy O.

Like Harris, Leifheit went to Yale for graduate school and is the entrepreneurial, self-sustaining center of his own career. He edits the magazine &lt;em>;MATTE&lt;/em>;, makes photo books, and teaches workshops across the country. They met because of Harris&#39;s insistence, in New Haven, on spreading his presence far beyond the confines of the drama school: he was known to drop in on photography critique sessions and to speak up, offering references and suggestions. “A lot of people thought he was part of the photo program,” John Pilson, one of the program&#39;s longest-serving faculty members, said. “By the end, we all expected to see him every week.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Harris had arrived at Yale in 2016. Several of his classmates were far beyond him professionally: they&#39;d had shows produced, they had agents. He was eager to catch up, but soon found himself at odds with the institution. The curriculum was too conservative for his taste; he felt that his instructors were dismissive of his interest in more experimental work. He started taking classes in Black studies and poetry. He also began work on “Slave Play,” which he says “poured out” of him almost whole. He was assigned a faculty adviser, the acclaimed playwright and director &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/11/03/real-gone-girl&quot;>;Young Jean Lee&lt;/a>;, who would help shepherd a student production.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Lee is a longtime downtown experimentalist, and many of her work&#39;s subjects—race, class, the body—are also crucial to Harris; he was excited to work with her. But she had extensive notes on “Slave Play,” which Harris mostly declined to take. She objected strongly to the final act, set in the bedroom of a Black woman named Kaneisha and her white British husband, Jim. Their therapy has been a disaster, largely because of Jim&#39;s refusal to go along with goofily degrading role-play. Kaneisha calls Jim a “virus,” and connects their relationship to the brutalities of the past; Jim gets back into character, as a slave master, and gives Kaneisha the abasement she seems to have been asking for.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;This sequence, the most hotly debated part of “Slave Play,” stayed in the show, even after the move to Broadway. When Lee saw it in a dress rehearsal, she was horrified; later, she told Harris that it took her more than an hour to calm down enough to give him feedback. The two then exchanged lengthy text messages. “I hope that no one has ever spoken that violently to you about work that so deeply intersects with your being, and if they have I&#39;m sorry,” Harris wrote. Lee replied, “If you&#39;re that irresponsible about putting a rape of a female body onstage, I&#39;m going to call you out on it in no uncertain terms. To turn it around and call me the violent one is a classic move that has been done to me many times, and I&#39;ve never fallen for it, and I&#39;m not falling for it now.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Their dispute culminated in a formal complaint process, presided over by Tarell Alvin McCraney, who leads the drama school&#39;s playwriting program. Harris used transcripts from those meetings in “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.nplusonemag.com/issue-38/fiction-drama/yell-a-documentary-of-my-time-here/&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.nplusonemag.com/issue-38/fiction-drama/yell-a-documentary-of-my-time-here/&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nplusonemag.com/issue-38/fiction-drama/yell-a-documentary-of-my-time-here/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;Yell: A &#39;Documentary&#39; of My Time Here&lt;/a>;,” his senior thesis play. I went to see it, in New Haven, in 2019. By then, Harris had already staged “Slave Play” and “Daddy” Off Broadway, but he still had something to prove to his teachers. The most constant formal structure in “Yell” is repeated acts of onstage defecation. Fake shit was everywhere at Yale&#39;s Iseman Theatre that day.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;frvuov&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Harris has said that “Yell” was inspired by the radical 1967 essay “The Student as Nigger,” by Jerry Farber, which compares the relationship between American students and their professors to that of slaves and masters. In June, 2020, at the height of the George Floyd protests, Harris shared “Yell” online, and wrote a long accompanying Twitter &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://twitter.com/jeremyoharris/status/1270447515570233350&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://twitter.com/jeremyoharris/status/1270447515570233350&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jeremyoharris/status/1270447515570233350&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;thread&lt;/a>; in which he posted screenshots of his text exchange with Lee, who declined to comment for this story. “EVERY DAY THEY TREATED ME LIKE A NIGGA THAT NEEDED TO BE TAMED AND IT MADE ME FEEL CRAZY,” he wrote.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In September, 2021, Harris sat in a chair in a bathroom at a ritzy hotel in New York. The Tonys were finally being awarded that night, and he&#39;d booked a suite nearby, where he could get ready. Also in the bathroom were his hairdresser, Latisha Chong, and a woman tending to his makeup and nails. He sat stock-still, never wincing as Chong pulled through his Afro and started to braid. The three of them, mutually devoted to the task of flashy beauty, calmly chatted about people they knew in common.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Everybody who knows him thinks he&#39;s gay,” Harris said. “But, I&#39;m telling you, he&#39;s straight.” Both women disbelievingly harrumphed. “Bone straight,” he said.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;The bathroom was a center of calm in the otherwise hectic suite. Harris occasionally got up to take a Polaroid of the room—an editor at &lt;em>;Vogue&lt;/em>; had commissioned him to keep a photo diary. Also milling around were two camerapeople shooting footage for a “Slave Play” documentary that Harris had promised to deliver to HBO. They swanned around the room, sometimes going out on the balcony to capture views of downtown and the West Side. Beyond and between the buildings, you could see the Hudson quietly snaking along.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Harris&#39;s assistant kept running out of the room, collecting bouquets of flowers and other gifts that were arriving in a steady stream. Harris had recently interviewed the young gay rapper Lil Nas X for a &lt;em>;GQ&lt;/em>; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gq.com/story/lil-nas-x-musician-of-the-year-2021&quot;>;profile&lt;/a>;. “Montero—he&#39;s brilliant,” he said, using the rapper&#39;s given name. “The interview felt kind of like a first date.” He asked his assistant to put on a song from Lil Nas X&#39;s new album, a catchy single called “Industry Baby.” “This one is gonna be huge,” Harris said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Friends continually appeared, at his invitation. His mother and niece were getting their makeup done in a neighboring room. Candace Owen-Williams, his old teacher, was there, too, in a sparkly gown. Harris pointed her out to each new arrival and repeated the story of how she made him feel less alone at school.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;This is how Harris relaxes—sitting somewhere near the center of a crowd that he&#39;s convened. Antwaun Sargent, an art critic and a gallerist with Gagosian, walked over to the ledge where Harris&#39;s gold accessories, custom-made for him by the haute-couture house Schiaparelli, sat gleaming. There were chunky rings and cufflinks, a necklace with a pendant made from a cast of Harris&#39;s ear, a “Phantom of the Opera”-style mask modelled after a swooping section of his face.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;As the sun began to set and the light in the room darkened, Harris asked everyone to leave so that he could ready himself for the show. That night, in a surprise to prognosticators, “Slave Play” was completely shut out—twelve nominations, nothing to bring home. The next day, the online edition of Page Six carried the headline “Jeremy O. Harris celebrates Tony snubs with two afterparties.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Early last year, Harris tweeted a casual swipe at the state of television. “I write tv for people who have an intellect for theatre since tv is hollow,” he wrote. “Bc the funny thing is the reason so many filmmakers and theatre makers were asked to make television is bc the medium hit a wall. That&#39;s why almost all the best tv, of late, has been made by exciting practitioners of other forms.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Stung TV writers and irritated critics noted that Harris now made much of his living from television, and not always in its most rarefied corners. In 2021, he&#39;d done a cameo, as himself, on the reboot of “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2008/03/10/advanced-placement&quot;>;Gossip Girl&lt;/a>;.” (The script called for a play within the show, which Harris wrote; later, he got it commissioned by the Public Theatre.) Then he was cast, as a fashion designer, in the second season of “Emily in Paris,” Darren Starr&#39;s critically maligned Netflix series about an American influencer who gets a job in France. The show&#39;s producers told Harris that they were looking for someone reminiscent of a young André Leon Talley.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Sharper observers of Harris&#39;s commentary noticed that he was playing a familiar role. “I support Jeremy O Harris being snotty about TV,” the &lt;em>;Times&lt;/em>; critic Jason Zinoman wrote. “Playwrights used to be like this all the time. It&#39;s a glorious tradition.” The path from New York theatre to a career in Hollywood—where the money and the weather are better, and the audiences are bigger—has been traversed by writers for almost a century. And Harris seemed to be giving television a dose of his usual medicine: let me in and I&#39;ll give you a piece of my mind.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;But on his winding path to playwriting, Harris had made the kinds of friends you would make if you were aiming for the screen all along. When Harris was still at Yale, Sam Levinson made him a consultant for his notoriously lurid HBO teen drama “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/on-television/the-addictive-chills-and-thrills-of-euphoria&quot;>;Euphoria&lt;/a>;.” (Harris is now a producer on the series.) Janicza Bravo got Harris hired as the co-writer for her movie “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-front-row/zola-reviewed-a-twitter-thread-takes-an-ingenious-and-audacious-cinematic-form&quot;>;Zola&lt;/a>;,” adapted from a riotous series of tweets.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;His steadiest Hollywood employment came in the form of the HBO deal that he signed in 2020. The following year, the network announced that he would adapt the novel “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Vanishing-Half-Novel-Brit-Bennett/dp/0525536965&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Vanishing-Half-Novel-Brit-Bennett/dp/0525536965&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Vanishing-Half-Novel-Brit-Bennett/dp/0525536965&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;The Vanishing Half&lt;/a>;,” by Brit Bennett, along with the playwright Aziza Barnes, a friend of his. The novel tells the story of twin sisters whose fates diverge: one dissolves into the American mainstream, passing as white; the other anchors herself in Black community. Harris and Barnes assembled a writers&#39; room to produce a pilot and a “show bible,” outlining the plot of the first season. They led the writers on a research trip to New Orleans, where much of “The Vanishing Half” is set. As the weeks passed, Harris was often airborne, travelling to fashion gigs, conducting interviews for magazines. When he signed the HBO deal, he&#39;d insisted that his contract contain an annual fund for supporting theatre, and he&#39;d used some of that money to create a fellowship for emerging writers. He was always &lt;em>;working&lt;/em>;. He just wasn&#39;t always writing.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Then, the following June, the Daily Beast &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thedailybeast.com/jeremy-o-harris-let-go-from-hbos-the-vanishing-half&quot;>;reported&lt;/a>; that Harris and Barnes were no longer working on the show. The article cited two sources who claimed that Harris “was let go after having trouble meeting script deadlines.” HBO insisted that he had not been fired. There had simply been creative differences, which were “part of the normal development process.” Harris, HBO added, “is a valued collaborator, and we currently have other projects in development with him.” (He is no longer on an exclusive deal with HBO but continues to work with the network.)&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I visited Harris, at his apartment, a couple of weeks later. It was a bright July day, hot in the sun but buoyed by a breeze. He answered the door wearing a long green terry-cloth robe, with dark polish on his fingernails. His young nephew had been wanting to paint his nails and was getting grief about it in his Southern milieu, Harris said, so he had painted his in solidarity. “Sometimes I think people don&#39;t want him to be a &#39;punk&#39; like Uncle Jeremy,” he said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The Daily Beast hadn&#39;t reported any details about Harris&#39;s approach to the “Vanishing Half” adaptation, but I had heard, from several friends, about a proposed scene in which a lot of feces is flung around. It sounded preposterous but not entirely unlikely. Harris, in his work, likes to explain drastic external action by way of uncomfortable, abject, and often lewd interior depths. His characters earn their brief glories after trudging through lots of shame; his people get splattered.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Harris seemed surprised that I&#39;d heard about the scene in such detail, but was happy to discuss it. He loved Bennett&#39;s book, but wanted to interpret it freely, even radically, something TV writers don&#39;t do enough, he said. One addition he and the writers envisioned was a surrealistic quasi-dream sequence that would send a character&#39;s consciousness “skipping like a stone across the waters of time,” as Harris put it in the show bible. The character would witness a “depraved ritual” meant to cleanse a small town of its communal sins, and the dark bacchanal would include “blackface masks, buffoonery and flying mud and feces.” It would end with “infidelities, thefts and dark family secrets ushered from the shadows into the light.”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;fcy98w&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Harris was less annoyed by people gossiping about his work than by the suggestion, in the Daily Beast and elsewhere, that he wasn&#39;t a hard worker. “I&#39;m actually really insecure about that,” he said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;He was about to go abroad, and he wanted a new swimsuit for the summer trip; he&#39;d asked Emily Bode to design one for him. We walked to her small tailoring shop in Chinatown, where a board high up on a brownish wall announced the prices for alterations. Half-done garments hung on faceless mannequins.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;A tailor silently took Harris&#39;s measurements, then gave him the swimsuit that Bode had left for him to try on: a lime-green one-piece with thin tank-top straps and tight shorts. He had seemed sedate and almost tired in the apartment, but now his mood lifted. He retreated behind a curtain, then came out wearing the suit, hugging his thin body. It fit. He looked into a mirror and spread his arms. He was already smiling.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;One night last October, Harris went to the Brooklyn Academy of Music to see the renowned Belgian theatre director Ivo van Hove&#39;s adaptation of the novel “A Little Life,” by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/01/17/hanya-yanagiharas-audience-of-one&quot;>;Hanya Yanagihara&lt;/a>;. Harris is friendly with Yanagihara—he&#39;d spoken with her about acting in a possible TV adaptation of the book. He attended the play with an old roommate from his Yale days, Michael Breslin, who co-founded the theatre collective Fake Friends. Harris has co-produced two of the collective&#39;s shows: “Circle Jerk,” a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize for drama, and “This American Wife,” a harrowing parody of Bravo&#39;s “Real Housewives” franchise.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“A Little Life” centers on a group of friends in New York, one of whom, a saintly character named Jude, is repeatedly flayed by acts of unspeakable violence. Like “Slave Play,” the novel was dogged by accusations of sadism. After the show, Harris, who has cited the Marquis de Sade as a formative influence, chatted with his friends. They all agreed that some of the show&#39;s most excruciating scenes, which had provoked gasps in the audience, could have been, in keeping with the book, a bit more graphic.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Harris took a car home, stopping for a drink at a bar near his apartment. Writers—a species always overrunning those blocks, which have come to be called Dimes Square—spilled out of restaurants and sidewalk sheds. For a few minutes, cradling his drink, Harris argued amiably with a pop-music critic about the recently released movie “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-front-row/tar-reviewed-regressive-ideas-to-match-regressive-aesthetics&quot;>;Tár&lt;/a>;,” which Harris hated.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Back at his apartment, he ate and paced and talked—softly, because a friend, one in a rotating series of medium-term guests, was sleeping in the next room. Soon, Khosravi came home. Like Harris, he is tall and slender and demonstrative; subtle streaks of gray run through the ringlets of his hair. Unlike Harris, he seldom seems excited to argue. Before Khosravi, Harris had a boyfriend who broke up with him in part, Harris says, because of his sudden fame. “Arvand doesn&#39;t mind that I&#39;m a star,” he once told me.&lt;/p>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;a data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a24982&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a24982&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;“Take care out there today hon.

They were flying in the morning to a gala in Bentonville, Arkansas, at the Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art. Harris didn&#39;t seem stressed.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The next day, at the museum, as Harris wandered a room with paintings by Kehinde Wiley, Amy Sherald, and Kerry James Marshall, Khosravi surprised him by getting on one knee and proposing marriage. He&#39;d had a ring designed by a pair of jewellers who lived across the street from them in London and had become their friends. And he&#39;d asked the playwright &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/02/12/adrienne-kennedys-startling-body-of-work&quot;>;Adrienne Kennedy&lt;/a>;—a hero of Harris&#39;s, and now a frequent e-mail correspondent of his—to write a benediction, to be etched on the inside. It reads, “Happiness. Is. To me. Greatest Thing.” Harris said yes.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;A day later, he giddily recounted the proposal on Twitter, adding a pinch of social critique. “But someone, I guess I will?, needs to write about how cringe it is to be proposed to when you haven&#39;t been socialized to be waiting for it,” he wrote. “It&#39;s a really violent trap we set for both parties where you&#39;re asked to be in a play you know the script to and if you deviate from it 💔.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Harris&#39;s doomsaying in 2020—his sense that the gatekeepers were not doing enough to reimagine and thus preserve the world of theatre—has arguably been validated, in the worst way, in the three years since then. A wave of closures and layoffs has prompted a rash of op-eds about the future of the medium. Harris, as contrarian as ever, is not abandoning the theatre but, rather, becoming something of a gatekeeper himself: he has lately been, almost above all else, a facilitator of other people&#39;s work.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;He is currently the presiding playwright for the Yale Drama Series, a role that involves judging the program&#39;s annual prize. After he took the position, last year, he began conceiving a writers&#39; retreat for some of the prize&#39;s finalists—inspired, in part, by his experience at MacDowell. In March, he announced the inaugural Substratum fellows: four young playwrights who would spend a month at a medieval house, part of the hotel Monteverdi Tuscany, which, along with Gucci, would help cover the expenses.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;He was in Italy with the fellows when he got a text from the actress Rachel Brosnahan, who, along with Oscar Isaac, was starring in a revival of Lorraine Hansberry&#39;s 1964 play “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/03/13/sign-in-sidney-brusteins-window-theatre-review&quot;>;The Sign in Sidney Brustein&#39;s Window&lt;/a>;,” at &lt;em >;BAM&lt;/em>;. She hoped he&#39;d come see it. He said he was abroad, and asked if the play might be extended or transferred; she didn&#39;t think so. “I&#39;m going to get you to Broadway,” he replied. He phoned producer friends, and together they engineered a brief transfer to the James Earl Jones Theatre—another play set to open there had seen its financing collapse. The Hansberry revival wouldn&#39;t run long enough to turn a profit, but it would get a wider audience for a work by another of Harris&#39;s playwriting heroes. And the quick transfer suggested a different approach, perhaps, for Broadway: If space opens up, why not take a few chances?&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In August, Harris went to the Berkshires to spend two weeks acting in a movie directed by Pete Ohs, who edited the “Slave Play” documentary. Ohs makes largely improvised movies for twenty thousand dollars or less; the tiny budget meant that he could shoot without breaking the rules of the Writers Guild of America strike, which had begun in the spring and showed no signs of ending. The film was a country-house nightmare about contracting disease from deer ticks.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;The cast was staying at the house, which belonged to the actress Callie Hernandez, one of Ohs&#39;s collaborators. In the brightness of the afternoon, a wall of trees outside was variously green: dark pine, mild maple, vivid oak. Inside, James Cusati-Moyer, who was in “Slave Play”—his character, a gay man, refuses to describe himself as white—stood at the kitchen counter, mixing flaxseed, honey, psyllium husk, and cranberries in a steel bowl. He was making gluten-free bread, from a TikTok recipe. “You want a kind of cakey texture,” he said. “The woman in the video is incredibly annoying, but the bread is great.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The movie would begin shooting that night. Harris changed into a white linen caftan and went into town for groceries—he&#39;d volunteered to make dinner, for the second day in a row. He drives with a country boy&#39;s ease; he learned at fourteen, when his mother realized how impossible it would be for her to chauffeur him to all of his activities. He&#39;d already acclimated somewhat to the roads of the Berkshires and to the local lore. “Birthplace of WEB DuBois,” he said. “They can&#39;t shut up about it—he&#39;s, like, the only Black guy they know.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Loping through the aisles at the grocery store, he picked up ears of corn with stringy husks and a pack of what he called “white-people aluminum foil,” packaged in a recyclable-looking brown paper box. He&#39;d begun writing a novel about a Black writer beset by deadlines and grief. Harris was very close with his mother&#39;s parents, who have both died in the past few years—his grandfather, Golden, died two weeks before “Slave Play” débuted on Broadway. “Writing isn&#39;t fun,” he said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;At lunch, in a small bakery across the street from a general store, he told me that his cash flow was slowing down as a result of the strike. “The other day, my niece asked me for a new phone, and I had to say no,” he said. “I told her, &#39;I&#39;m not trying to be mean—I&#39;m broke.&#39; ” He pays private-school tuition for her and his nephew; he bought a home, in Virginia, for his mom. He was worried about falling behind on payments.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;tls7&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Back at the house, he enlisted his castmates as sous-chefs—chopping herbs, buttering corn—and began to cook. People were trying on clothes and critiquing the outfits. Would this work for the character? What else did it need? Cusati-Moyer was in a loose crop top. Harris loved it.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“I feel bloated from the bread,” Cusati-Moyer said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“You are,” Harris said, grinning.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“This is what he was like,” Cusati-Moyer told the others. “He builds you up and then he breaks you back down!”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Harris called his mom to ask her advice on the meal—pork chops, roasted corn, fried apples, all callbacks to his childhood. Should he melt the butter, put the apples in the cast iron, and &lt;em>;then&lt;/em>; pour the sugar in?&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“I don&#39;t know if you know this,” he told her, “but there&#39;s a white way to make this, where you don&#39;t just pour sugar.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Yeah, well, we make it the Black way,” his mom said. They talked about Harris&#39;s niece, and about the patterns his mom had begun to notice in her romantic life, and about literature. They sounded like siblings who take turns being in control.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;She said that she wanted to write a book about her life. “The best way to write is to read really good things,” Harris said. “You have to read this book by a French woman named &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/11/21/annie-ernaux-turns-memory-into-art&quot;>;Annie Ernaux&lt;/a>;. &#39;Happening.&#39; You&#39;ll really like it.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;He sat in the kitchen, with food in the oven and on the stove, steeling himself quietly for work later on, chatting with his mother.
