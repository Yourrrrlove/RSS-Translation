>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;不过，仅靠及时性并不足以保持所有这些漫画都还活着，更不用说将它们引入经典了。 &lt;em>;X-Men&lt;/em>; 的销量太少，以至于漫威在 1970 年停止发布新的冒险系列。（该系列直到七十年代末和八十年代初才变得流行，甚至成为标志性的，并由一个由作家克里斯·克莱蒙特（Chris Claremont）、艺术家戴夫·科克鲁姆（Dave Cockrum）和约翰·伯恩（John Byrne），以及作家和编辑路易丝·西蒙森（Louise Simonson）和安·诺森蒂（Ann Nocenti）。）美国队长甚至不是来自白银时代；而是来自白银时代。卡比和乔·西蒙在四十年代创造了他，他在六十年代的冒险经历强调了他作为最伟大一代的继承人的地位，一个过时的孤独人。这些书中收录的最强漫画，不仅捕捉了时代，而且指向了时代。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;故事在一代代读者的整理、谈论、模仿、推荐中成为经典。在这种情况下，婴儿潮一代在它们首次亮相时阅读它们，X一代随着它们的续集长大，千禧一代通过漫威电影遇到它们。每一代的粉丝——最初的粉丝，越来越多的粉丝，以及如今的非二元粉丝——不仅找到了阅读漫画的新方式，还找到了使用漫画的新方式。卡农就是这样形成的。几十年来，业余爱好者和专业人士在哪些书重要以及为什么重要方面达成了共识，否则他们喜欢争论这个问题，而我们就得遵循这些论点。当拥有出版、教学和编辑权力的一代人与前一代人出现分歧时，经典就会兴衰，获得作品，也会失去其他作品。&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;对于现在的一代人来说主管文学出版，漫画可以成为经典。回想起来，我们可以看到为什么这些标题和这些具体问题（例如《神奇四侠》第 48-50 期，但不是第 43 期）很重要。 《蜘蛛侠》、《神奇四侠》和其他漫画的“经典”期代表了连载漫画中作为视觉艺术或故事转折点的高潮——而且往往两者兼而有之。对粉丝来说重要的故事可能比封面吹捧的故事具有更低、更不明显的风险。我们知道变形的斯库鲁人不会毁灭地球，否则就不会有下一个问题。但镭射眼会邀请漫威女孩出去吗？里德·理查兹会和他的女朋友苏·斯托姆结婚吗？直到我们阅读之后我们才知道。与其说这是冒险故事的逻辑，不如说是漫威也出版的浪漫漫画的逻辑。 （参见模特米莉。）道格拉斯·沃尔克（Douglas Wolk）阅读了 1961 年至 2017 年间出版的所有漫威漫画，为他的书《&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/All-Marvels-Journey-Biggest -Story/dp/0735222169&quot;

aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt; /div>;&lt;p>;黑豹进入这一经典的旅程后来开始，并走了一条不同的道路。企鹅出版社的版本于 1966 年开始，瓦坎达是一个“位于赤道非洲中心”的科技乌托邦，在《神奇四侠》漫画中首次出现。然后它跳到 1973 年至 1976 年间出版的 16 部漫画。所有漫画都是由唐·麦格雷戈 (Don McGregor) 编写的，他发展了后来的编剧和编剧将使用的神话故事——《基尔芒格》、《勇士瀑布》、《皇家宫殿》。 （“当我被从黑豹上取下来时，”麦格雷戈说，“有人告诉我这是因为我太接近黑人的经历了。我看着我的白手。”）麦格雷戈和铅笔师比利·格雷厄姆塑造了一个战士——在瓦坎达之外可以成为超级英雄的国王，但在家里却必须学会成为果断的统治者和浪漫的男主角。瓦坎达与漫威宇宙的其他部分存在一定距离——无论是概念上还是实际上都是另一个国家。它必须等上几十年，并得到好莱坞的推动，才能成为不仅仅是一种崇拜的经典。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;当散文作家在十八世纪的文学地位上升时，诗歌爱好者认为中等粗俗。这种态度可能需要数年时间才能改变，而漫画是一个特殊的出发点：它们不仅是一种文本媒介，而且是一种视觉媒介。柯比（Kirby）或他的《美国队长》继任者吉姆·斯特兰科（Jim Steranko）创作的一部顶级漫画几乎不需要言语。您只需观察角色的行为和反应即可了解故事情节。值得庆幸的是，企鹅出版社对这些图像进行了公正的处理。他们在厚厚的白纸上用明亮、平坦、彩色的墨水再现了六十年代的漫画——与旧新闻纸上使用的点式处理不同，但也许更真实地体现了他们大胆、追逐刺激的精神。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;em>; 《神奇四侠》年度第 6 期（1968 年），整页展示了一个橙黑相间的物体通过洋红色新星爆发向后坠落。 《火炬》讲述了他“无助地被抛入太空……”的故事。 。 。就像一群无力的布娃娃！”在前景中，里德·理查兹痛苦地尖叫；我们只能看到他的脸，其他部分都在画面之外。他像巴洛克画作中的伊卡洛斯一样倒下了。在整个卡比的故事中，尤其是在《神奇四侠》中，太空时代的英雄们横扫梦幻般的背景：星星、星云，甚至还有手绘人物叠加的黑白照片拼贴。卡比工艺的顶峰在墨水师乔·辛诺特和一位未注明出处的调色师（可能是玛丽·塞维林）的协助下，出现得稍早一些，在吞噬者的奇观中——一个巨大的、经常戴着紫色头盔、满嘴紫色散文的坏人。他是一名太空旅行者，也是一个奇观，对人类的苦难漠不关心。后来的漫画家还没有能与他相媲美。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;李、柯比和迪特科现在都已经死了。顾名思义，经典作品已经过时了，而且这些书籍的某些部分已经过时了。尽管有石头人的例子，但传统上丑陋或明显毁容的角色通常都是恶棍，从伤痕累累、复仇心切的九头蛇夫人到又大又圆、闷闷不乐的斑点。解决民权斗争的尝试因温和的中间主义而受到影响。恶棍们无缘无故地解释他们的计划；一切都带有感叹号。女性（或“女孩”，如隐形女孩）拥有女性的力量，例如收缩、间谍或隐形；很少有两个或两个以上的女性交谈。有些情节毫无意义。但这些漫画与那个时代的几乎所有其他流行文化产品以及我们自己的许多流行文化产品都有这样的缺陷。我们一直在阅读它们，寻找它们的突出之处。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;白银时代的漫威意味着情感（《X战警》中独眼巨人和漫威女孩的相思；《神奇四侠》中石头人的抑郁）和奇观：一个令人惊叹的世界具有新视角的眼睛、闪亮的星际小玩意和永远在行动的英雄。但在漫画中，这个世界在没有竞争的情况下能够为更多的读者做更多的事情。在现代数字图形之前，在《星球大战》之前，在电子游戏之前，只有在四色漫画的页面中，这样的宇宙事迹和超人壮举才能找到合适的视觉形式。六十年代电影的特效在今天看起来很俗气，但六十年代早期漫画的视觉效果在现代屏幕上却出奇地好。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;对于现代超级英雄漫画来说，这是一个问题。长期的漫威角色现在适合史诗电影，从“&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2000/07/24/dazzled-2&quot;>;X战警&lt;/a>;”到“&lt;

They&#39;re a locus of community for fans who want more stories, or different stories, than Hollywood can offer, and they have room for new artists, new writers, and new heroes on old teams. Because they&#39;re so much cheaper to make than film or TV, they sometimes let writers take more risks. You won&#39;t find friendships between young, explicitly trans people taking center stage in a Marvel movie, or in Silver Age comics, but you can see exactly that in beautiful, intricate issues of Marvel&#39;s &lt;em>;New Mutants&lt;/em>; (2020-23), written by Vita Ayala and then by Charlie Jane Anders.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Eliot opined that true national classics had to display a “whole range of feeling” and to elicit “response among all classes and conditions of men.” The Marvel Universe, all in all, arguably comes close; Wolk calls it a “mountain, smack in the middle of contemporary culture,” that “never stopped growing.” But readers who walk away, or give up, or pass on, will have to be replaced by new generations. Super-movies may keep coming, and archival editions may keep rolling out, as long as they make money. Without new people in the comic-book stores, though, and without stories that hold a new audience, Marvel comic books risk becoming what Mark Twain said a classic was: “something that everybody wants to have read, but nobody wants to read.” Not even Galactus wants that. ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;ja3dqk&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 21 Sep 2023 03:06:01 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[How the U.S. Lifted Children Out of Poverty and Then Threw Them Back Into It]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.newyorker.com/news/q-and-a/how-the-us-lifted-children-out-of-poverty-and-then-threw-them-back-into-it]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-20T15:51:55.444Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6509f3af1ffb801ebcb0efab/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Chotiner-Child-Poverty.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;article >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attribute-verso-pattern=&quot;article-body&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;ArticlePageChunks&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Last year, according to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2023/income-poverty-health-insurance-coverage.html&quot;>;new report&lt;/a>; from the US Census Bureau, child poverty in America more than doubled. This steep increase, which was accompanied by a general rise in poverty among all age groups, was preceded by two years of declining poverty rates, which were largely attributed to support offered by the federal government during the pandemic. In the case of child poverty, the most important driver of the 2022 jump was the expiration of the expanded child tax credit, which the Biden Administration and congressional Democrats were unable to renew last year, thanks to the opposition of Senate Republicans and Joe Manchin.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;To talk about the report, I recently spoke by phone with Christopher Wimer, the director of the Center on Poverty and Social Policy at the Columbia University School of Social Work. During our conversation, which has been edited for length and clarity, we discussed why the child tax credit has been so successful at reducing poverty, whether states can fill the gap left by the federal government, and what lessons should be drawn from pandemic-era expansions of the social safety net.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;What did this report tell us, and how did it reach its conclusions about the child poverty rate in the past year?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;It showed what a lot of people were expecting—namely, that using the supplemental poverty measure, which is a more robust measure of income poverty than the United States&#39; official measure, and counts a lot of the income that the official measure ignores, such as tax credits and in-kind benefits, showed a major rise in poverty from 2021 to 2022. As I said, that was widely expected given that we knew a lot of the pandemic-era policy support to people&#39;s incomes had expired by 2022. For children, the major thing that expired was the 2021 expansion to the child tax credit.That wasn&#39;t the only thing driving the increase in child poverty, and poverty over all from 2021 to 2022, but for children it was a major part of the story.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;Do we have some sense of how much a part of the story it was?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Yeah, the child poverty rate was 5.2 per cent in 2021, and that increased to 12.4 per cent in 2022, so it more than doubled. We put out a piece last week where we showed that if an expanded child tax credit had still been in place in 2022, the child poverty rate would have been about 8.1 per cent, so much less than the 12.4 per cent that the census saw. Poverty still would have gone up for children. But there were other parts to the story. In 2021, we had the third round of stimulus payments, or “economic impact payments,” as they&#39;re called. There was also the continuation of some other expansions to the safety net such as emergency allotments in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (&lt;em >;SNAP&lt;/em>;).&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;So, from what we can tell, slightly more than half the increase in child poverty was due to the expiration of the credit.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Correct.&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;Your center wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/q-and-a/the-devastating-effects-of-losing-the-child-tax-credit&quot;>;report&lt;/a>; in the beginning of 2022, looking at just the jump from December, 2021, to January, 2022, after the expiration of the expanded credit, and you found an even bigger increase in child poverty than the recent census report showed. Could this have been even worse?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I think it&#39;s important to understand that the numbers we released in 2022 came from our estimation of monthly poverty rates. So it&#39;s a method that we developed to try to understand the poverty rates in the population in advance of the annual statistics that come out each year from the Census Bureau. One important and key difference between the two measures is that our monthly series is really trying to capture the inflow of income in a given month compared with the poverty rate in a given month, whereas an annual poverty measure is aggregating income across the calendar year.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Our monthly series would ask how much the monthly payment in July, for example, reduced the child poverty rate in July, whereas the census numbers that came out last week are asking how all the income pooled across the calendar compared with an annual poverty measure. But, despite the differences, both show that the expiration of the expanded child tax credit threw a lot more children into poverty after keeping a lot of children out of poverty while those payments were in place.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;Can you talk a little bit about how the child tax credit works and why you think it has been so successful?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;The child tax credit has been around for about twenty-six years and historically has operated as part of people&#39;s tax filing and tax refunds. It&#39;s been what the IRS calls partially refundable so that, for upper-income families, the credit can reduce the amount of taxes that people owe at tax time. And then, for lower- and more moderate-income families, they can get a partial credit as a refund at tax time. Before the 2021 expansion, the maximum credit that one could be eligible for was two thousand dollars per child. And not everyone got that. The maximum that people could get as a refund, for example, was only fourteen hundred dollars per child.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;There&#39;s an earnings floor, essentially, before you get anything. And then the credit would phase in as earnings increase. Our research at the center has shown that in the pre-expansion form of the credit, a lot of children were left out or left behind by that credit structure, particularly the children in the lowest-income families. A lot of people got only a partial credit, and some families with children got no credit at all. You needed substantial levels of earnings to get the full credit that was available to middle- and upper-middle-class families.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;In 2021, the American Rescue Plan expanded the credit for that year and basically made three big changes. One change was that it increased the maximum size of the benefit levels, from two thousand to three thousand dollars per child for older children, six and above, and thirty-six hundred dollars per child for younger children, ages zero to five. The second major change is that it made the credit fully refundable and available to all families with children at the lower end of the income distribution and no longer tied to the earnings levels of their parents. The third major change was that the credit was delivered monthly in the last six months of 2021. So half of the credit was delivered to most families in July through December, in the middle of the month, and then the second half of the credit was delivered when families filed their taxes in early 2022. Those are the three major changes. They were in existence only for that year. And, as of 2022, the law reverted to its pre-pandemic form.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;This year, after we found out that the federal expansion was not going to be permanent, a number of states have stepped in and tried to increase their own child tax credits. What do we know about those efforts, and is it too early to see what effect they might be having? How much hope do you have that, if the federal government doesn&#39;t step in, some of the uptick in poverty rates that we&#39;ve seen can be mitigated?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;i2kkzn&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;zzo3cr&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;It&#39;s been exciting to see the momentum on this issue at the state level. The federal earned-income tax credit has been around since 1975, but in recent decades a lot of states have adopted a state-level earned-income tax credit. Usually those are pegged as a certain percentage of the federal one, but there really weren&#39;t that many state-level child tax credits before the federal expansion. So, like you said, a number of states have pursued or created or expanded state-level child tax credits in the past year or two, and it is a little too soon to look at all their impacts because they&#39;re going into effect at different times, and not all of them were fully in effect in 2022, which is the most recent data we have from the Census Bureau.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The other thing I would note about them is that they tend to be much smaller than the 2021 expanded federal credit. They vary a lot in terms of size, and the degree to which they&#39;re fully refundable, like the federal expanded credit was. In some states, they&#39;re more like rebates. They also vary in terms of whether they&#39;re permanent or temporary. But it&#39;s exciting to see, and we&#39;ll learn a lot more as more states put them into practice. And, of course, states have to balance their budgets every year as opposed to the federal government. So often they have less money to create and institute such a credit.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;Has it been mostly blue states that have tried to put in some sort of expansion recently, or has it been bipartisan? In part because this was a tax credit and not a government program, there was hope that the credit would be a bipartisan thing going forward. Have you seen that on the state level?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;They have tended to be blue states. New York had one before the pandemic and expanded it after the pandemic. The state had a credit that was only for children age five and above, and they extended the eligibility to younger children. California had one and has one still. A lot of the states that have been creating new ones tended to be the bluer states, like Maryland and Minnesota.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;The report says that the biggest increase in child poverty was in the South. Do we know much about regional distinctions? It seems that state-level efforts to fill in for the federal government are less likely to happen there, which would mean less help for the places with the worst child poverty.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;We showed in a report last year that the impacts of the credit on the reduction in poverty in 2021 were largest in the states that had a lower cost of living. The supplemental measure will have a higher poverty line in more expensive places, such as California and Washington, DC Sometimes there&#39;s a lower poverty line in places in the South where housing costs are much lower. So the credit, which doesn&#39;t vary regionally, is the same amount in Mississippi as it is in California, but essentially can do more anti-poverty impact when the poverty line is lower to begin with. Part of what might be going on is that the Southern states might be losing more in relative terms because of the size of the benefit relative to their poverty line.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;There&#39;s been some talk about further federal expansions, and what we hear from politicians who seem more skeptical than most Democrats is that it would have to be bundled with work requirements. What exactly would a work requirement be, and how would that function in practice?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;So the way the child tax credit works, or worked before the pandemic, and how it works again now is it does have essentially what you would call a work requirement. You receive any amount of dollars from the credit only if you meet this earnings threshold, which is a few thousand dollars. In a sense, you have to work to get anything from it. And, to qualify for the full credit, you have to have pretty substantial earnings. As your earnings rise, you would get a larger credit, and then that plateaus for a while. And then, as your earnings get really quite substantial, the credit would again begin to phase out and become smaller. There are some people whose families have too much earnings to get anything from the credit, but that&#39;s a small fraction of families. That&#39;s usually what people are talking about when they&#39;re talking about instituting a work requirement: preserving that earnings floor and that phase-in with earnings as earnings increase.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;But I think it&#39;s really important that all children are able to benefit from this program, and that it not be just a middle-class subsidy. We&#39;ve shown the importance that investments in children&#39;s family incomes can have for their long-term well-being and development. Kids who are not in poverty go on to earn more in the labor market, be healthier, all sorts of things that we want as a society. The other point that I often make to people is that incomes aren&#39;t a fixed characteristic. So, when you actually take a longer view, a lot more American families with children will experience a period of hard times and a period of low income. Having a robust child tax credit provides a bit of insurance against the risk of hard times.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;And it could even affect non-parental caregivers, such as grandparents, correct?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;iikgi&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Yeah, absolutely. The expanded credit was for all children, except, of course, some of the highest-earning families&#39; children. Whoever was claiming the child on their taxes would be the person receiving that money.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;I don&#39;t want to slight the scale of what happened, but when you look at a chart of child poverty in the United States, which obviously is embarrassing, child poverty is still significantly below what it was a decade ago or even a couple decades ago.这是为什么？ And, even if what we saw in 2022 was horrific, what lessons can we learn from the longer-term trend of declining child poverty?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;At Columbia, we actually created a version of the supplemental poverty measure that I described earlier, going all the way back to 1967. It tries to capture in a consistent way the definition of income that includes not just cash income but these in-kind benefits and tax credits and the like. When we look at that over the long term, we do see that poverty has come down pretty dramatically over the past five-plus decades. A lot of that progress has come from policy alone. So that&#39;s a success story, but it&#39;s also a story that the labor market and all the economic progress and gains that we&#39;ve had in the past five decades haven&#39;t necessarily translated into reductions in poverty unless you count the resources from government policies and programs.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;One lesson that we take from the recent expansion is that policy matters a lot, and policy can reduce child poverty and reduce need in this country as long as we have sustained effort behind it. But unfortunately it was just one year where we conducted this experiment in social policy. The second lesson is that unfortunately we still need policy to be doing this work as opposed to our normal labor market and other institutions.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;When you say that this episode shows that policies work, what specifically with regard to children are we talking about in addition to the child tax credit?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Policies tend to work together, but it&#39;s not just the child tax credit by any means. So you have the earned-income tax credit, which was expanded periodically since it was created, in 1975. It was originally a pretty small program. Especially in the nineties, it was expanded pretty dramatically under the Clinton Administration. That&#39;s become increasingly important. The &lt;em >;SNAP&lt;/em>; program as well has become increasingly important in recent years, especially after cash welfare was largely dismantled in the mid-nineties. There are smaller programs, such as the National School Lunch Program, which provide important support. Social Security and its expansion in the seventies were a huge driver of reduction in elderly poverty. So it depends which subpopulation you&#39;re talking about, but it&#39;s not just the child tax credit that matters by any means. ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;ln7kr7&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot;

What if, he wondered, his artistic goals were not goals at all but, rather, dreams, designed to eventually be discarded?&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;That&#39;s when he turned to his great-aunt Encarnación.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;As a nonagenarian, blind, retired schoolteacher, Encarnación was happy. It wasn&#39;t a ceaseless euphoria, per se, but she was content, and that in itself was exceptional. It was not the bliss of ignorance—she was bright, always smiling.这怎么可能？ How could one look at life in such a beautiful way, not just existing to see things through but actually enjoying what life has to offer? How does one become more like Encarnación?&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;GenericCallout&quot;>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;external-link-embed--inline&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;a aria-label=&quot;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;The New Yorker Documentary&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-new-yorker-documentary/watch-the-new-yorker-documentary&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-new-yorker-documentary/watch-the-new-yorker-documentary&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;&lt;span >;&lt;strong>;The New Yorker Documentary&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/a>;&lt;p >;&lt;em>;View the latest or submit your own film.&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;a aria-label=&quot;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;The New Yorker Documentary&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-new-yorker-documentary/watch-the-new-yorker-documentary&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-new-yorker-documentary/watch-the-new-yorker-documentary&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5daf63ccaae3dd0008e7fd38/1:1/w_200%2Cc_limit/undefined&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5daf63ccaae3dd0008e7fd38/1:1/w_120,c_limit/undefined 120w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/a>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;The namesake short is the resulting examination. Filmed on Encarnación&#39;s ninety-fifth birthday, with great-aunt as interviewee and nephew as interviewer, the documentary attempts, in a literal way, to witness life the way Encarnación does. “She always told me that all she could see was shadows and blurry images,” Tarantino said. “So I wanted to show that.” With the use of a slow shutter speed, Tarantino&#39;s vision of his great-aunt is stilted, fuzzy. Her words as she talks to her nephew are then scrawled and scratched across the screen, as if she were writing a letter to us, the curious seekers of contentment. “&lt;em>;Café con leche, y azúcar en el café,&lt;/em>;” she quietly chants throughout the short—like a prayer, or, perhaps, like an answer to a prayer—describing a beloved ritual. This isn&#39;t an homage to Encarnación; rather, it&#39;s an embodiment.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;A fleet of photographs flashes onto the screen, offering rare moments of visual clarity. The picture sharpens, too, when Tarantino meditates on the domestic doodads that Encarnación has accumulated in nearly a hundred years of living: a small bed squeezed between a wall and an armchair, amber from the glow of a lamp; a vase full of pastel fabric flowers; a plaque, dedicated to “Encarnita,” from her former students that reads “&lt;em>;ERES REGAÑONA, PERO NOSOTRAS . 。 。 TE QUEREMOS MUCHO!!&lt;/em>;”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Tarantino still doesn&#39;t quite know how filmmaking will figure into his life. Encarnación&#39;s life suggests a possibility: that the question of professional aspirations could be different from the question of happiness. “I needed to find a way to understand how to enjoy the ride,” he told me. “And I think she explained it perfectly.” For Encarnación, life is about having a sense of play. You are the one who gets to decide whether you&#39;re happy or not. That decision may look like taking time for small pleasures—say, savoring a good cup of coffee instead of merely getting caffeinated. &lt;em>;Café con leche, y azúcar en el café.&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Initially, Tarantino said, “this was a film for myself, to remind myself how to be happier in life, but I&#39;m so happy to see that it became so much more. This way, Encarnación can help another person who&#39;s going through a tough time.” He then added, “I know that she will love that.”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 20 Sep 2023 19:06:01 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[The World According to Elon Musk’s Grandfather]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-world-according-to-elon-musks-grandfather]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-19T23:09:43.774Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6508a43498443ed0f819116d/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Lepore-Musk.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;article >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attribute-verso-pattern=&quot;article-body&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;ArticlePageChunks&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;This month, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tag/elon-musk&quot;>;Elon Musk&lt;/a>; threatened to sue the Anti-Defamation League, alleging that its denunciation of X—the ADL had accused the social-media platform formerly known as Twitter of amplifying antisemitism—has cost Musk&#39;s company a fortune in advertising revenue. The Anti-Defamation League, in turn, asserted that Musk&#39;s threat was “dangerous and deeply irresponsible.” This week, Israeli Prime Minister &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tag/benjamin-netanyahu&quot;>;Benjamin Netanyahu&lt;/a>; flew to California to meet with Musk to discuss artificial intelligence, but their other much-anticipated topic was antisemitism. Netanyahu asked Musk to “stop antisemitism as best you can.” Musk, alluding to SpaceX and his hope for a mission to Mars, responded that he favors anything that “ultimately leads us to become a spacefaring civilization,” and, since hate hinders that mission, “obviously, I&#39;m against antisemitism.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;This all unfolded amid the release of Walter Isaacson&#39;s &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Elon-Musk-Walter-Isaacson/dp/1982181281&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Elon-Musk-Walter-Isaacson/dp/1982181281&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Elon-Musk-Walter-Isaacson/dp/1982181281&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;new biography&lt;/a>; of Musk. Musk&#39;s family history has a bearing on the dispute, but, in the book, as I pointed out &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/09/18/elon-musk-walter-isaacson-book-review&quot;>;in a review&lt;/a>;, Isaacson only glancingly discusses Musk&#39;s grandfather JN Haldeman, whom he presents as a risk-taking adventurer and whose politics he dismisses as “quirky.” In fact, Haldeman was a pro-apartheid, antisemitic conspiracy theorist who blamed much of what bothered him about the world on Jewish financiers.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Elon Musk is not responsible for the political opinions of his grandfather, who died when Musk was three years old. But Haldeman&#39;s legacy casts light on what social media does: the reason that most people don&#39;t know about Musk&#39;s grandfather&#39;s political writings is that in his lifetime social media did not exist, and the writings of people like him were not, therefore, amplified by it. Indeed, they were very unlikely to circulate widely, and are now quite rare. Still, they&#39;re not hard to find, which makes it unfortunate that Isaacson neither quotes from nor mentions them.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Musk has said that he &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/infinite-scroll/twitter-is-already-a-hellscape&quot;>;bought Twitter&lt;/a>; to halt the advance of a “woke mind virus” spreading online. His grandfather wrote his tracts to raise an alarm about what he called “mind control,” on the radio and television, where “an unconditional propaganda warfare is carried on against the White man.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Haldeman was born in Minnesota in 1902 but grew up mostly in Saskatchewan, Canada. A daredevil aviator and sometime cowboy, he also trained and worked as a chiropractor. In the nineteen-thirties, he joined the quasi-fascistic &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/04/03/the-data-delusion&quot;>;Technocracy movement&lt;/a>;, whose proponents believed that scientists and engineers, rather than the people, should rule. He became a leader of the movement in Canada, and, when it was briefly outlawed, he was jailed, after which he became the national chairman of what was then a notoriously antisemitic party called Social Credit. In the nineteen-forties, he ran for office under its banner, and lost. In 1950, two years after South Africa instituted apartheid, he moved his family to Pretoria, where he became an impassioned defender of the regime.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Before the age of the Internet, the writings of political extremists tended to be privately published, in quite small numbers. An angry man typing out memos about an invisible world government might make a few mimeographs or carbon copies, but the chance that any ended up in a library, catalogued and preserved, is slight. Presumably, most of Haldeman&#39;s papers remain in family hands, if they have not been destroyed. But some of his writing survives, including in the Michigan State University library&#39;s extraordinary &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://libguides.lib.msu.edu/radicalism&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://libguides.lib.msu.edu/radicalism&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://libguides.lib.msu.edu/radicalism&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;Radicalism Collection&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;In 2017, the collection acquired two of Haldeman&#39;s tracts, as part of a trove from an anonymous donor which has now grown to nineteen thousand pieces of right-wing propaganda and conspiracy literature. One of the Haldeman tracts, “The International Conspiracy to Establish a World Dictatorship and the Menace to South Africa,” is dated May, 1960. The timing is significant. In February, 1960, Harold Macmillan, the British Prime Minister, delivered his famous “Wind of Change” speech to the South African Parliament, discountenancing apartheid and urging acceptance of independence movements: “The wind of change is blowing through this continent, and, whether we like it or not, this growth of national consciousness is a political fact.” In March, South African police opened fire on a crowd of thousands of Black South Africans protesting outside the Sharpeville police station, killing sixty-nine people, including children, and wounding nearly two hundred. The killings were captured on television and the coverage reached around the world. In the ensuing protests and state of emergency, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/12/16/nelson-mandela&quot;>;Nelson Mandela&lt;/a>; was among eighteen thousand people arrested and jailed. Haldeman&#39;s tracts defended white rule against an “international conspiracy” that opposed it.&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;“Every day the brain-washers repeat and emphasize the things they want us to believe,” Haldeman warned in his forty-two-page May, 1960, tract. “As examples &#39;The Natives are ill-treated,&#39; &#39;underpaid,&#39; &#39;underprivileged,&#39; &#39;separate development is wrong,&#39; &#39;apartheid is un-Christian.&#39; Every day newspapers, magazines, commercial radio newscasters, bioscopes, din this into the conscious and subconscious minds of the public.” (“Bioscopes,” here, means motion pictures.) “People who know it is 99% untrue repeat these lies emphatically and emotionally,” Haldeman wrote.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Haldeman railed against many dark forces that he believed to be propagating these ideas: Jewish bankers, Jewish intellectuals, philanthropic foundations run by Jews, communists, Black leaders, and anyone who supported the overthrow of colonial rule in Africa. “The facts of history show that the White man has always developed the country he inhabits to the benefit of all concerned,” he wrote, peddling stock apartheid propaganda, and “The Black people of Africa have been in close contact with civilization from the earliest times but, on their own, built nothing and discovered nothing, not even the wheel.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In the second tract that MSU holds, “The International Conspiracy in Health,” Haldeman blamed the “collectivist-internationalist” conspiracy—“from Kennedy to Kenyatta”—for “centralized health schemes” that include national health insurance and various pharmaceuticals (including fluoride in the water, another conspiracy), all of which he considered “anti-Christian infringements on human liberties.” If some people were not alarmed by all of this, he wrote, it was because of mind control. “When a Christian subscribes to this, it is the result of the concentrated, intentional brain-washing done by the International Conspiracy.” Submitting to national health care was one way the conspirators were allowing “Black or Coloured political puppets” to take “control of responsible White people.” The Conspiracy, he warned, controls universities, medical schools, and even textbooks. “The Conspiracy feels that any medical intervention, so long as it is in mass, is a desirable procedure.” Above all, “The promoters of World Government have always been behind mass vaccination programmes.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Aside from these two tracts, a rare-books dealer earlier this month sold an issue, No. 5, of a newsletter called &lt;em>;Survival&lt;/em>; (“For Adults Only”) that he attributes to Haldeman. (The author&#39;s name, the dealer reports, appears on the back page.) In the issue, published sometime after January, 1962, the writer represented the growing independence movements across African nations as a “&lt;em >;WORLD GONE MAD&lt;/em>;.” “Throughout the so-called African Independent States there is complete chaos,” he wrote. “The population is reduced to starvation and cannibalism approaching what it was before the arrival of the White man.” He described the Mau Mau as engaging in a rite that required an initiate “to suck the dismembered penis of some other unfortunate victim of Mau Mau.” He denounced Israel, for having “consistently voted against South Africa in the United Nations.” But, in any case, he explained, the UN was riddled with communist spies.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Haldeman typed his tracts, presumably on his own typewriter. He might have made dozens of copies, or maybe hundreds, but not likely many more. He might have sent them out by mail or handed them out at political gatherings or church meetings or men&#39;s groups. They were read, in any event, by a handful of South Africans in and near Pretoria, and possibly also by like-minded people farther afield. And then they very nearly disappeared. But if Haldeman were writing today, he&#39;d likely be distributing his ideas on Facebook and YouTube and Twitter and Reddit and 4chan and more. Algorithms would deliver them to thousands and possibly millions of people. He would find an audience. He would become bolder. He would find a bigger audience. He would become bolder still. Elon Musk&#39;s grandfather&#39;s political views are not Musk&#39;s responsibility. But what would happen to those rantings, if they were posted on X today, really does lie at his doorstep. ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;wyyj7l&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;xs56yq&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 20 Sep 2023 08:06:01 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“Stop Making Sense” and the Transformative Power of Collaboration]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-front-row/stop-making-sense-and-the-transformative-power-of-collaboration]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-19T23:42:59.759Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6509c266df6f169a2b0e1448/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Brody-SMS_005.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;article >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attribute-verso-pattern=&quot;article-body&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;ArticlePageChunks&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Talking pictures began with a musical—“The Jazz Singer,” in 1927—and the filming of musical performance has been an artistic battleground ever since. With great performers, unadorned recording is a virtue; film plays an archival role in preserving onstage singing and dancing that would otherwise have been lost to history. But movies are an art in themselves, and, when performances are filmed without an aesthetic, the result is numbing, as the up-and-down fortunes of early movie musicals reflect. In the wake of the success of “The Jazz Singer,” the genre was overused and underthought, and soon became box-office poison, until Busby Berkeley reimagined and revitalized it, with the artistry of his highly stylized numbers in “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/42nd-street&quot;>;42nd Street&lt;/a>;” (1933). The conflict endures, especially in the subgenre of concert movies, in which a director&#39;s limited control of the action and of camera placement makes it hard to produce a stylishly cinematic work. One of the few directors to overcome these obstacles and create a concert movie artistically equal to his fiction features is the late &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-loss-of-jonathan-demme&quot;>;Jonathan Demme&lt;/a>;—with “Stop Making Sense,” his 1984 film of the band Talking Heads in performance. (It is now having a theatrical rerelease, in a new restoration.)&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Demme—whether in his previous movies, such as “Citizens Band” and “Melvin and Howard,” or his later and more famous ones, including “The Silence of the Lambs,” “Philadelphia,” and “Rachel Getting Married”—excelled at tracking the complex interactions of ensemble casts. The same artistic impulse is at the heart of “Stop Making Sense,” which stitches together parts of three Talking Heads performances from December, 1983, at the Hollywood Pantages Theatre, to evoke a single concert. With Demme&#39;s dramatic features, the creation of the ensemble was a product of his actor-focussed directorial ethic, but in “Stop Making Sense” he achieves this feeling by creating a distinctive image repertory that emphasizes the band members&#39; interplay and offers a clear visual manifestation of their connections, both practical and intangible.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The concert begins with the band&#39;s front man, David Byrne, onstage alone, in a light suit and white sneakers, strumming an acoustic guitar and singing “Psycho Killer” over prerecorded beats coming from a boom box beside him. He&#39;s not literally alone (the crew is visible behind him), but, performing by himself with wit and focus, he seems like a piece that fell out of a puzzle. It&#39;s a pregnant performance, highlighting the inadequacy of his solitude, and the movie bursts into life only in the next number, “Heaven,” for which the band&#39;s bassist, Tina Weymouth, joins him. Demme frames the two musicians together: Byrne, emoting in the foreground, and Weymouth in the background, clad in a jumpsuit and keeping an eye on Byrne as she plays.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Meanwhile, the crew wheels a riser and a drum kit onto the stage, to prepare for the next episode, which is launched when the band&#39;s other two founding members walk on: the guitarist and keyboardist Jerry Harrison is coolly professional, but the drummer Chris Frantz, with his polo shirt and his gee-whiz grin, looks like a member of the high-school golf team, gleefully surprised to have been asked to jam with the artsy kids. Demme&#39;s framing adjusts to the configuration, filming diagonally from behind the musicians so that the screen fills with their overlapping and contrasting rhythmic moves—a visual counterpoint to the gallop of “Thank You for Sending Me an Angel” and the lope of “Found a Job.” Finally, five recent recruits to the band emerge: the keyboard player Bernie Worrell (a co-founder of P-Funk), the vocalists Lynn Mabry (also from P-Funk) and Ednah Holt, the guitarist Alex Weir, and the percussionist Steve Scales. These five musicians are Black, their sound mostly rooted in funk, whereas the four founding members of Talking Heads are white, and in this convergence the band announces the meeting and melding of styles as the core of its musical and intellectual project. As a nonet, Talking Heads becomes a fervent and rollicking collective with an expanded musical and expressive range, and Demme expands his cinematic vocabulary to match.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;There&#39;s a reason that Talking Heads and other musicians who came along in the nineteen-seventies—Blondie, Elvis Costello, Television, the B-52s, and the Ramones—were called New Wave. The term was no mere generational marker. Like the French New Wave filmmakers, these rockers had a historical perspective on their art and included it in their music. Having grown up while rock moved from the disreputable margins to the firmly ensconced mainstream, they inherited a genre whose newfound status emboldened them to make daringly forward-looking music on the basis of their copious inner musical encyclopedia.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Talking Heads, in particular, was fundamentally referential in its approach, quoting from the styles and tones of rock and pop, rather than fully belonging to either. Byrne, for instance, both captured and transfigured the essential loneliness of Roy Orbison&#39;s music. The solitude of Orbison&#39;s music was rooted (or rootless) in wide-open spaces, whereas Byrne&#39;s is a loneliness of plenitude, of isolation amid an inescapable urban crowd and the alienating effects of complex technologies. “Stop Making Sense” catches, in expressive closeups, the self-consciously mechanical gawkiness with which Byrne brings his techno-alienation to life. In “Once in a Lifetime,” he starts repeating himself and then knocks his head to break the loop, as if he were a defective robot.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The band&#39;s expanded lineup in “Stop Making Sense” is similarly self-aware. In the collective imagination, forming a band is one version of redemption from the inner loneliness of the white, suburban middle class. The arrival of five Black funk musicians in the lineup is, artistically speaking, not unlike, say, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/postscript/jean-luc-godard-was-cinemas-north-star&quot;>;Jean-Luc Godard&lt;/a>;&#39;s casting of the American actress &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/the-clippings-file-jean-seberg-an-american-in-paris&quot;>;Jean Seberg&lt;/a>; in “Breathless.” Talking Heads was no likelier to make authentic funk than Godard was to make a Hollywood film noir, but each was doing more than paying homage to the unreachable ideal of their influences and inspirations; they were producing art that documented the transformative power of those influences. Once the quintet joins in, the band becomes a mighty machine, which Demme glorifies with panoramic, frontal images, capturing the stage-filling energy. An ever-expanding array of camera angles picks up the almost synaptic connections that are sparked between individual musicians. Byrne&#39;s interactions with Mabry and Holt push his theatrical imagination to a new level of frenzy. After they playfully mime his antics when he runs in place during “Life During Wartime,” he ups the ante and starts running in huge ovals all around the stage. His antiphonal interjections amid the singers&#39; choral riffs during “Crosseyed and Painless” combine verbal wit with wry touches of gestural invention.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The show has come a long way from Byrne&#39;s lonely opening, but, then, his chilly intensity has always been balanced by the pathos and humor he extracts from his exaggerated awkwardness. Indeed, his theatrical solitude seems Jacques Tati-esque—his dance with a stick lamp in “This Must Be the Place” could even be a “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/dvd-of-the-week-playtime&quot;>;Playtime&lt;/a>;” reference. (The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/david-byrnes-gray-suits-from-stop-making-sense-to-american-utopia&quot;>;oversized boxy suit&lt;/a>; that Byrne wears for several numbers in the film has become iconic, but it&#39;s also superfluous: he&#39;s already expressing its essence in performance throughout the concert.) Demme&#39;s juxtaposition of the solitary Byrne and the thrumming band is expressionistic: Byrne, lit tightly from the side during “Once in a Lifetime,” looks possessed, like a manic preacher; when the gospel eroticism of Al Green&#39;s “Take Me to the River” brings the entire band to a peak of ecstatic energy, the cinematography seems to join in, with a rapturous sequence of sharply contrasting angles and vigorous pan shots.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The drama that Demme evokes in “Stop Making Sense” is the artistic self-transcendence that emerges from collaboration in performance. This was an idea whose time had come, and that was being explored almost simultaneously by two other filmmakers: Godard and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/postscript-chantal-akerman&quot;>;Chantal Akerman&lt;/a>;. Godard&#39;s “First Name: Carmen” was an updated adaptation of the opera as a film noir, in which most of Bizet&#39;s music was replaced by Beethoven&#39;s string quartets, performed onscreen and filmed with a daring, painterly sense of visual counterpoint. Akerman&#39;s documentary “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/goings-on-about-town/movies/one-day-pina-asked&quot;>;One Day Pina Asked . 。 .&lt;/a>;,” depicting &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/in-memoriam-pina-bausch&quot;>;Pina Bausch&lt;/a>; and her company, Tanztheater Wuppertal, in action, displays a similar attention to the overlaps and intersections between performers. Godard and Akerman might seem like odd company for the far more amiable and artistically temperate Demme—but, in “Stop Making Sense,” he reaches bold extremes in his own artistry. The film not only bears witness to the self-surpassing power of inspired collaboration but, as an art work, also exemplifies it. ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot;

>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Midway through the Q.-&amp;amp;-A. section of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-political-scene/why-is-nikki-haley-running-for-president&quot;>;Nikki Haley&lt;/a>;&#39;s town hall, earlier this month, at the Veterans of Foreign Wars post in Merrimack, New Hampshire, a man named Ted Johnson stood up to announce that America was heading for civil war. “So,” he asked Haley, “how can I get back to that day, in the nineteen-eighties, when I was happy, running in the street, riding my bike?”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;As it happens, Haley brings up the eighties a lot. Her most recent book takes its title from a Margaret Thatcher quotation, and she frequently invokes Thatcher on the campaign trail; last month, at the first &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/a-chaotic-display-of-conservatism-at-the-first-republican-debate&quot;>;GOP Presidential debate&lt;/a>;, she trotted out the “If you want something done, ask a woman” line to her biggest audience yet. In February, a video teaser for Haley&#39;s campaign had opened with a grainy clip of Jeane Kirkpatrick—the Democrat turned neocon foreign-policy adviser to Ronald Reagan—addressing the 1984 Republican National Convention.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In the course of the very long US Presidential-campaign season, most candidates are usually furnished with an opportunity to have “a moment.” This is Nikki Haley&#39;s: CNN&#39;s most recent general-election trial heats show her beating &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tag/joe-biden&quot;>;Joe Biden&lt;/a>; by the biggest margin of any Republican candidate, including &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tag/donald-trump&quot;>;Donald Trump&lt;/a>;. After the first debate, which, as the Washington &lt;em>;Post&lt;/em>; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2023/08/25/nikki-haley-republican-debate-competence/&quot;>;put it&lt;/a>;, Haley “won on brains and experience,” David Brooks &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/24/opinion/nikki-haley-republican-debate-winner.html&quot;>;wrote&lt;/a>; that it was time to “give Haley her chance”; even &lt;em>;The New Republic&lt;/em>; had a &lt;a href=&quot;https://newrepublic.com/article/175317/nikki-haley-2024-campaign-biden-scared&quot;>;piece&lt;/a>; about why she “scares the Biden campaign.” Haley doesn&#39;t present as an isolationist or a populist; she doesn&#39;t call the government “the regime” or compare the country to the Roman Empire in decline; at her events that I attended, she never said the word “woke,” or even “liberal” or “élites.” She favors the cliché “I&#39;ve always spoken in hard truths,” a simple bromide that manages to distinguish her in the non-Trump GOP primary lineup—not haranguing like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tag/ron-desantis&quot;>;Ron DeSantis&lt;/a>; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/vivek-ramaswamy-is-not-the-next-trump&quot;>;Vivek Ramaswamy&lt;/a>;, not as lifeless as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tag/mike-pence&quot;>;Mike Pence&lt;/a>;&#39;s comparable appeal to the golden age.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;At the Veterans of Foreign Wars post, a flashing sign at the entrance advertised a meat raffle. A former Air Force nurse had introduced Haley, who paced in flared bluejeans and a white lace sweater. When Johnson asked her how he could get back to the eighties, she took his disillusionment and wistfulness for a bygone era as an opening for a poignant yarn—the kind of story that Democrats usually tell—about a daughter of immigrants burying the Confederate flag.&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;“I don&#39;t know if y&#39;all remember, we had a horrific church shooting in South Carolina a few years ago,” she said. She recounted how, in 2015, a young white man had murdered nine Black churchgoers at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church, in Charleston, after participating in a Bible study with them. The shooter&#39;s writings called for a race war, and his Web site included photos of him with the Confederate flag; Haley decided it was time for South Carolina to take down that flag from in front of the statehouse, where it had flown since 1961. To persuade state lawmakers to vote in favor, Haley said, she told them about accompanying her father, a Sikh who taught at a historically Black college, to buy groceries on an excursion from the small town where they lived; the shopkeepers called the police when they saw her father&#39;s turban. “Every time I have to go to the airport, I have to pass that produce stand. And, every time I pass it, I feel pain. Don&#39;t make any child have to pass the statehouse and see that flag and feel pain.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;After the town hall, I sat in a folding chair next to Johnson. “I was for Trump in 2016 and 2020, but now I want unity,” he told me. “I&#39;m a Haley convert. I ordered her sign last night. Right now, I have one up for Burgum, but that&#39;s coming down.” I told him that I thought I saw him tearing up during Haley&#39;s riff about the flag. “I had totally forgot about that,” he said. “She was the one who actually got it taken down—she worked with Republicans, Democrats, faith leaders, community leaders. When I say the nineteen-eighties, Mom let me out of the house and I didn&#39;t come home until dark. Everybody liked each other, everybody was happy. Me and my wife are Independents now, and Haley&#39;s going to pull in people like us. She&#39;s going to pull moderate Democrats, too.” He went on, “You got a lot of that Trump base right here, in the backwoods. They want Hunter to pay, they want Hillary to pay. That ain&#39;t moving our country nowhere.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;“Do you remember, when you were growing up, how simple life was, how safe it felt?” Haley had asked the crowd, which applauded as she walked off to “American Girl,” by Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers. “Don&#39;t you want that again?” They did, and they do. Haley said that she raised a million dollars within seventy-two hours of the first debate, and her campaign swing through New Hampshire had a triumphant tone. During her town halls, I noticed audience members using her phrasing unprompted. (“I&#39;m here because of the debate,” one voter said, “and you told hard truths.”) Melinda Tourangeau, a Desert Storm veteran in pearls, pink lipstick, and a striped blazer, told me, “I haven&#39;t loved a politician this much since Ronald Reagan.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Haley&#39;s pitch for the future harks back to a more traditional vision of the GOP—the type of candidacy one might think the contemporary Party would have no use for—but a canny establishment conservative may be Biden&#39;s greatest threat. Haley is now tied with DeSantis for second place in the New Hampshire primary polls—Trump, of course, is first—but, more significant, she seems to hold real appeal for a swath of moderate suburban voters whom Biden needs to win. She took down the Confederate flag, isn&#39;t forthrightly hostile to transgender rights or a woman&#39;s right to choose, and sides with liberal internationalism in her support for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tag/ukraine&quot;>;Ukraine&lt;/a>;. She&#39;s the first female minority governor in the country, and she&#39;s never lost an election. Her pitch is notably inclusive: “We should want to win the majority of Americans,” she said. “Our solutions are the right ones, but you don&#39;t do it by pushing people away. You do it by opening the tent. We need more people in. We need young people, we need women, we need African Americans, we need Asians, we need Hispanics. And you don&#39;t go to them and say, &#39;You should be with us.&#39; You go to them and say, &#39;What do you care about?&#39; ”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The day before the VFW, Haley had been in Claremont, a formerly prosperous mill town by the Vermont border, for a town hall in the game room of a local senior center. A license plate pinned to the wall read “Retired: No Worry, No Hurry, No Phone, No Boss.” Nearby was a sign warning people not to fall for scams; dinner, according to a menu written in cursive on a whiteboard, would be shepherd&#39;s pie. Haley walked in wearing a blue striped blouse and white, open-toe espadrilles that showed a light-pink pedicure. The event was small; there weren&#39;t more than ten attendees per reporter.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Haley usually opens her stump speech with an abbreviated family origin story: the only Indians in a two-stoplight South Carolina town—“We weren&#39;t white enough to be white, we weren&#39;t Black enough to be Black”—where her parents told her how blessed they were to be in America. She talks about dropping off her husband, a combat veteran, at four in the morning for a yearlong deployment to Africa. She points out that, before politics, she was an accountant who graduated from a public university. (No law school, no Ivy League.) She always says, “The first thing we&#39;re going to have to tackle is this national self-loathing that has taken over our country”—a callback to Kirkpatrick&#39;s “Blame America first” speech, in which she said that the American people understand “the dangers of endless self-criticism and self-denigration.” Haley likes to conclude by insisting that she&#39;s glad to have been underestimated for her entire life: “It makes me scrappy.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;She also musters bits of jovial, canned banter without inducing the cringe of Pence or DeSantis, or, for that matter, the current President. She makes an attentive, active-listening face, smiles, and doesn&#39;t interrupt; she stopped mid-sentence to say “Bless you” to someone who sneezed in the back of the room. She held a voter&#39;s crying baby and stayed late to talk to the local cops manning the event. Two women next to me debriefed: “That was great—someone who actually accomplished something.” Two school-age kids wanted Haley&#39;s autograph, and, when they got to the front of the line, she knelt down to confer with them at length before signing “God bless you” into their notebooks.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;rblpljs&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;azs7qi&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;GOP events in New Hampshire aren&#39;t just attended by Republicans looking for a post-Trump candidate; many of the audience members were Democrats and Independents listening closely to see if they could find an alternative to Biden. At the town hall in Claremont, I talked to Barre Pinske, who wore turquoise, horn-rimmed glasses. “I&#39;m an artist, a sculptor, so I should be a Democrat,” he said. “I like Obama and Reagan. Obama was cool, he could ride around with Jerry Seinfeld, and Reagan was a man&#39;s man. I&#39;m not married and I don&#39;t have kids, but I have family values. All that sort of stuff matters to me. So just because I&#39;m a free spirit, I still have a nostalgic, American kind of perspective.” He went on, “The Republican Party is messed up, and, if someone doesn&#39;t come in as more centrist, the Republicans have no chance to win. I would like to see them get somebody who can get those swing voters. I&#39;m the kind of voter they&#39;re looking for, and I&#39;m drinking the Haley Kool-Aid.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Haley is the only female candidate in the GOP primary, a fact that many voters in New Hampshire told me, unbidden, they were drawn to. When Haley declared her candidacy, back in February, Don Lemon was benched from CNN for saying that, at fifty-one, she was “past her prime.” (Afterward, Haley said that she raised twenty-five thousand dollars for her campaign by selling beer koozies that read “&lt;em >;PAST MY PRIME&lt;/em>;?”) Pinske told me, “She brings a maternal spirit to a leadership position.” Haley mostly comes across as hawkish and tough, but she does occasionally embrace a certain maternal energy. Of South Carolina, post-shooting, she said, “I had to put my arms around my state and protect her.” Later: “I think we need a mom in the White House.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;At the Vets post in Merrimack, her hawkishness had the crowd cheering. A man named Paul in an American-flag T-shirt told me, “I want somebody willing to pull the nuclear trigger with China. Get it over with, even if it would be the end of us. Margaret Thatcher, Golda Meir—we need somebody tough.” Haley&#39;s international experience appeals: a former Army nurse named Barbara Healey said, “We could have Russia, China, North Korea banging on our door—we need someone who can deal with that.” The audience loves when Haley says that being the UN Ambassador allowed her to take the “Kick Me” sign off America&#39;s back. I wondered how her interventionist policy in Ukraine would play, given that Trump, DeSantis, and Ramaswamy all want less US involvement. She pitched giving weapons and money to Ukraine as a short-term patriotic duty; a quick end to the war would keep veterans like her husband from going to fight, and be a display of strength to China and Russia.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;When asked about post-Roe America, Haley responds with a display of equivocation that avoids alienating most pro-life voters while also managing to bring in liberals. “I&#39;m going to tell you my hard truth, because I don&#39;t think Americans get the truth on this situation,” she said, in Merrimack. “I don&#39;t judge anyone who&#39;s pro-choice.” She mentioned a college roommate who was raped; she talks about her husband&#39;s adoption and her own difficulty conceiving. Haley&#39;s appeals to consensus—“Can&#39;t we all agree?”—save her from the extremes that would lose her votes, but also reveal to some a crucial lack of conviction on issues that should define her. “The paradox is that she says all of this stuff, but she&#39;ll still campaign and vote for Trump when it comes to it,” Stuart Stevens, a former Republican political consultant, told me. “This is somebody who has courted and said positive things about the most right-wing elements of the Party. The differences between Haley and Marjorie Taylor Greene are ultimately purely aesthetic, but I don&#39;t think MTG is reading polls to remind her of her deeply felt beliefs. There&#39;s a frivolousness to Haley running for President and trying to please everybody.” Haley frames this differently, as a “story of addition.” Shortly after announcing her candidacy, she told Bari Weiss, “There&#39;s a reason that I&#39;m more likely to win a general election than anyone else. It&#39;s because I identify with &lt;em>;so&lt;/em>; many different people.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;After the Vets post, Haley visited the Founders Academy, a charter school in Manchester, to do a town hall with Tiffany Justice, a founder of the conservative advocacy group &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/11/07/the-right-wing-mothers-fuelling-the-school-board-wars&quot;>;Moms for Liberty&lt;/a>;. Beforehand, she sat at a roundtable with the school principal, some teachers, and a couple of moms running for the local school board. In the sweltering classroom, a poster with an inspirational quote—“Life Is Tough, My Darling, but So Are You”—hung next to the works of Shakespeare arranged by color. One of the moms at the table fanned her baby with a pocket Constitution. Haley kept it boring. “We don&#39;t want Democrat and Republican parents,” she said. “We want all parents. Don&#39;t all parents want transparency?” During the town hall, held in the school library, a press photographer sitting on a shelf crashed through it, sending colored pencils flying everywhere. Haley told a story about how, when she was in seventh grade, her dad didn&#39;t sign her sex-ed permission slip, so she had to sit in a room alone during the course. “That&#39;s not for the schools to decide,” she said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Haley said that Biden had called her out as a “&lt;em >;MAGA&lt;/em>; extremist” for doing an event with Moms for Liberty. “Then count me as one of them!” she joked. She presented as traditional, not extreme, making all the points that conservatives want to hear without devolving into a full-time battle with Disney or promising to abolish the Department of Education, in the bellicose vein of DeSantis and Ramaswamy. She managed the same thing with transgender questions as she did with abortion, at times coming across as almost progressive compared with most other GOP candidates. “I believe in freedom,” Haley said. “If an adult decides that they want to transition, they are welcome to do that.” (Recently, even Trump seems to sense danger in taking uncompromising positions on these matters: he called DeSantis&#39;s abortion ban a “terrible mistake” and told Megyn Kelly that he&#39;d heard a man can now give birth.) At the senior center, Haley had reminded the crowd that Republicans have lost the popular vote in seven of the past eight Presidential elections, and that seventy-eight per cent of parents don&#39;t think their children will have a better life than they did. By acquitting herself with Moms for Liberty while toeing a moderate line, her subtle rebuttal of Biden was the idea that this all &lt;em>;could&lt;/em>; be simple again, not a forever war between progressives and extremists. Haley shared an anecdote that she often rolls out on the campaign trail, recalling her mother&#39;s advice to her when she was teased in school for being Indian: “Your job isn&#39;t to show them how you&#39;re different. Your job is to show them how you&#39;re similar.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In Claremont, during a Q. &amp;amp; A., a voter named Dale Giles mistook Haley for Tulsi Gabbard. After Haley clarified that she wasn&#39;t, Giles still launched into his critique: “It seems like you have an axe to grind with Trump. I&#39;ve got nothing but the utmost respect for you.” Giles wore a Dodge hat and a shirt styled to resemble the Walmart label that read “Biden: Pay More. Live Worse”; his cell phone was ringing loudly in his pocket. He had more of a comment than a question, concluding by suggesting that Haley pick South Dakota&#39;s governor, Kristi Noem, as her running mate. (“I think that means you&#39;re a fan of women!” Haley responded.) Afterward, Giles went up to take a photo with Haley, and they spoke for several minutes. I asked for his impression of the candidate who minutes ago he thought was somebody else. “I&#39;d love to see Joe take her behind the barn,” he said, smiling and pausing for effect as I waited to see where he was going with it. “And let her kick his ass.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Even if Haley has the best chance against Biden, it doesn&#39;t mean that she&#39;ll be the Republican nominee. (In New Hampshire, being tied for second with DeSantis still means that they&#39;re both losing to Trump by thirty-seven points.) To the base “in the backwoods,” as Johnson, the eighties nostalgist, calls the &lt;em >;MAGA&lt;/em>; hard-liners, Haley is the archetypal striving representative of the globalist, anti-populist, corporate wing of the Party. In a &lt;em>;Times&lt;/em>; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/15/opinion/nikki-haley-president.html&quot;>;roundtable&lt;/a>; called “Nikki Haley Will Not Be the Next President,” Daniel McCarthy, the conservative columnist, wrote that she is “too representative of the party elite&#39;s desires to be seen as a plausible tribune of the working class.” (At the debate, Ramaswamy wished Haley well in her “future career on the boards of Lockheed and Raytheon.”) She&#39;s clearly sensitive to this flaw in her image as a candidate; on a podcast, asked to name the last book she had read, she offered “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Hillbilly-Elegy-Memoir-Family-Culture/dp/0062300547&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Hillbilly-Elegy-Memoir-Family-Culture/dp/0062300547&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Hillbilly-Elegy-Memoir-Family-Culture/dp/0062300547&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;Hillbilly Elegy&lt;/a>;,” by JD Vance. “Nikki is running for an endowed chair at the Atlantic Council, not a Presidential nomination,” Tucker Carlson told me. “She&#39;s not trying to win Trump voters. She&#39;s doing something stealthier and more difficult, which is to make professional-class Trump haters forget that, just a few years ago, she worked for him. How many other Trump Cabinet secretaries would the average NPR listener conceivably vote for? Nikki&#39;s the only one.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Haley is gently pitching herself as the one to move the Party beyond Trump—“We have to elect a &lt;em>;new&lt;/em>; conservative leader”—without denouncing him too much, but, in Claremont, she was dogged by demands to articulate her allegiance to the former President. “People are wondering if you were lying when you raised your hand at the debate to say you would support President Trump even if he was in jail,” Giles said. “Can you raise your hand with us now to say that you would support President Trump?” Haley is nimble at pivoting when it comes to what may be the most consequential stance in this race, for those who actually want to win—the precarious Trump line. She reminded voters that she was able to leave the Trump Administration “without a tweet,” dignity intact. Great as the eighties may have been, Haley&#39;s pragmatic equivocation might be her best weapon; she understands the “hard truth” of the one real deciding factor about whether a moment can last. Her way out of the yes or no, hand up or down for Trump? “I speak hard truths,” she replied, smiling. ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;c1jlo&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 20 Sep 2023 01:06:01 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Republican Support for the U.A.W.

After years of representing the interests of big business and resisting legislation supported by labor unions, they are claiming to be a party with the interests of the striking autoworkers at heart.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;As you might have expected, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tag/donald-trump&quot;>;Donald Trump&lt;/a>; is leading the stunt. This past weekend, he told NBC News, “The autoworkers are being sold down the river by their leadership, and their leadership should endorse Trump.” He and other Republicans have seized on the argument that the Biden Administration&#39;s push for electric vehicles (EVs) is a betrayal of the country&#39;s autoworkers, most of whom work at plants that make gasoline vehicles or their components.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Last week, I &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/the-uaw-strike-threat-poses-a-tricky-political-challenge-for-biden&quot;>;wrote&lt;/a>; about the tricky political challenge that the UAW dispute poses for Biden, who must navigate the tension between his landmark green-energy policies and his sympathy for organized labor. At the White House on Friday, Biden defended the autoworkers on strike and called on the automakers to insure that “record corporate profits mean record contracts for the UAW” The White House also announced that it was sending a senior Biden adviser, Gene Sperling, and the acting Secretary of Labor, Julie Su, to Detroit.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Meanwhile, Trump and the Republicans see an opportunity to flip Michigan, a state that the former President won narrowly in 2016. They also have their eye on the US Senate seat that Debbie Stabenow, the four-term Democrat, is vacating in January, 2025. Politico &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2023/09/17/republicans-uaw-strike-electoral-gains-00116443&quot;>;reported&lt;/a>; that the National Republican Senatorial Committee had issued a statement claiming that Elissa Slotkin, a Democratic congresswoman who is running to replace Stabenow, “chose her party over Michigan by voting to ban gas cars.” (The statement referred to Slotkin&#39;s vote last week against a House GOP bill that would halt state efforts to restrict the sales of gasoline-powered vehicles.) Even the former Vice-President Mike Pence, that noted tribune of the working class, has keyed in on the hefty subsidies for the purchase of EVs that Democrats provided in last year&#39;s Inflation Reduction Act. “Using taxpayer dollars to drive our automotive economy into electric vehicles is understandably causing great anxiety among UAW members,” Pence told CNN.&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Politics is politics, but the sight of senior Republicans posing as the true friends of the union workers is so outlandish as to be almost comical. From Trump on down, the GOP has spent decades siding with employers and seeking to frustrate union efforts to organize workplaces and raise wages. Even as it has sought to rebrand itself as a workers&#39; party, the GOP&#39;s actions have made a mockery of this claim.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Start with Trump. After taking power in 2017, he restored the Republican majority on the five-person National Labor Relations Board, the agency that was established during the New Deal to support workers&#39; rights to organize and bargain collectively. Trump appointed a former House Republican staffer, Marvin Kaplan, as chair of the NLRB Under GOP leadership, the agency quickly moved to reverse several pro-labor rulings that it had issued during the Obama Administration, including one that made it easier for workers at fast-food franchises to organize. This pro-employer slant continued throughout Trump&#39;s term. In December, 2019, the agency issued two rulings that introduced new restrictions on unionization votes and made it easier for firms to classify workers as independent contractors, thus depriving them of union wage scales and benefits.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Contrast this record with the actions of the NLRB under Biden, who appointed two former union lawyers to its board and another former union lawyer, Jennifer Abruzzo, as its general counsel. In the past couple of years, the agency has abrogated many of its Trump-era rulings, including the ones related to voting procedures and independent contractors. Last month, the NLRB ruled that if a company engages in intimidatory behavior during a unionization election, such as firing union organizers, the agency will order the company to recognize the union and bargain collectively. In another ruling, the NLRB set out new rules for unionization votes, which require votes to be held promptly and restrict efforts by employers to delay them, which are very common occurrences.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Labor activists and commentators sympathetic to unions praised these decisions. Writing for &lt;em>;The American Prospect&lt;/em>;, Harold Meyerson &lt;a href=&quot;https://prospect.org/labor/2023-08-28-bidens-nlrb-brings-workers-rights-back/&quot;>;hailed&lt;/a>; the NLRB&#39;s anti-intimidation edict as its “most important ruling in many decades.” The issuance of the two rulings together, Meyerson added, “effectively makes union organizing possible again, after decades in which unpunished employer illegality was the most decisive factor in reducing the nation&#39;s rate of private-sector unionization from roughly 35 percent to the bare 6 percent at which it stands today.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;As the rate of unionization has steadily declined, most Republicans have consistently opposed legislative efforts to reverse that trend, including two bills that would have made it easier for unions to organize: the Employee Free Choice Act, which a Democratic-controlled House passed in 2007, and the Protecting the Right to Organize (&lt;em >;PRO&lt;/em>;) Act, which the House passed in 2019 and again in 2021. (On the latter occasion, five Republicans voted for the bill; two hundred and five didn&#39;t.)&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;To quote an old saying, actions speak louder than words. On Friday, Representative Slotkin went to a Ford assembly plant in Wayne, Michigan, and spoke to some striking UAW workers. The Democratic senators Gary Peters, of Michigan, and John Fetterman, of Pennsylvania, have also appeared on the picket lines. Bernie Sanders has railed against “corporate greed” at a UAW rally in Detroit. What about Trump and Pence and the rest of the Republican UAW stalwarts? So far, they have been conspicuously absent. On Monday, the &lt;em>;Times&lt;/em>; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/18/us/politics/trump-detroit-debate.html&quot;>;reported&lt;/a>; that Trump is planning to visit Detroit on September 27th, the day of the second Republican candidates&#39; debate, and speak to a crowd of workers, including autoworkers. It remains to be seen what sort of reception he receives. “Every fiber of our union is being poured into fighting the billionaire class and an economy that enriches people like Donald Trump at the expense of workers,” Shawn Fain, the UAW president, said in a statement after the &lt;em>;Times&lt;/em>; story appeared. ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;d6r6ns&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;qgh02n&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 20 Sep 2023 00:06:01 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
