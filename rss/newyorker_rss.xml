data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot ;:“ExternalLink”、“outgoingURL”：“https://www.amazon.com/Thought-Reform-Psychology-Totalism-brainwashing/dp/0807842532”}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon .com/Thought-Reform-Psychology-Totalism-brainwashing/dp/0807842532&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;思想改造与极权主义心理学&lt;/a>;，”利夫顿采访中国再教育营的前囚犯。利夫顿接受过精神病学家和精神分析学家的培训，他利用访谈来了解极权主义的心理结构，而不是政治或意识形态结构。他的下一个主题是&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1946/08/31/hiroshima&quot;>;广岛&lt;/a>;；他 1968 年的书“&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Death-Life-Robert-Jay-Lifton/dp/080784344X&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;: “ExternalLink”、“outgoingURL”：“https://www.amazon.com/Death-Life-Robert-Jay-Lifton/dp/080784344X”}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com /Death-Life-Robert-Jay-Lifton/dp/080784344X&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;生命中的死亡&lt;/a>;”，基于对原子弹幸存者的广泛联想采访，赢得了利夫顿国家图书奖。然后他转向越南战争退伍军人的心理，不久之后又转向纳粹分子的心理。在生成的两本书中——“&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Home-War-Learning-Vietnam-Veterans/dp/1590511689&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot ;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Home-War-Learning-Vietnam-Veterans/dp/1590511689&quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www .amazon.com/Home-War-Learning-Vietnam-Veterans/dp/1590511689&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;战争归来&lt;/a>;”和“&lt;a data-offer-url= &quot;https://www.amazon.com/Nazi-Doctors-Medical-Psychology-Genocide/dp/0465049052&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;

target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;纳粹医生&lt;/a>;”——利夫顿努力了解普通人犯下暴行的能力。在他最后一本基于采访的书中，“&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Destroying-World-Save-Shinrikyo-Apocalyptic/dp/0805065113&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{ “元素”：“ExternalLink”，“outgoingURL”：“https://www.amazon.com/Destroying-World-Save-Shinrikyo-Apocalyptic/dp/0805065113”}&quot;

data-event-click=&quot;{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Birds-Robert-Jay-Lifton/dp/B0006CK7UA&quot; ;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Birds-Robert-Jay-Lifton/dp/B0006CK7UA&quot;

data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot ;:“ExternalLink”、“outgoingURL”：“https://www.amazon.com/Surviving-Our-Catastropes-Resilience-Hiroshima/dp/1620978156”}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon .com/Surviving-Our-Catastropes-Resilience-Hiroshima/dp/1620978156&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;在我们的灾难中幸存&lt;/a>;，”将回忆与幸存者的论点结合起来——无论是战争、核爆炸、持续的气候紧急情况、新冠肺炎或其他灾难性事件可能会导致其他人走上重塑之路。如果人类的生活无法像我们已经习惯的那样持续下去，那么幸存者（那些曾凝视灾难深渊的人们）很可能会想象并制定新的生活方式。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;利夫顿长大了。在布鲁克林，成年后的大部分时间在纽约市和马萨诸塞州度过。他和他的妻子贝蒂·吉恩·科施纳 (Betty Jean Kirschner) 是一位儿童读物作者，也是公开收养的倡导者，他们在科德角的韦尔弗利特拥有一所房子，用来举办韦尔弗利特集团的年会，该集团将精神分析学家和其他知识分子聚集在一起交流想法。克什纳于 2010 年去世。几年后，在一次晚宴上，利夫顿遇到了政治理论家南希·罗森布鲁姆 (Nancy Rosenblum)，后者成为韦尔弗利特集团 (Wellfleet Group) 的参与者和他的合伙人。 2020 年 3 月，利夫顿和罗森布鲁姆离开了他在上西区的公寓，前往她位于马萨诸塞州特鲁罗的家，靠近科德角的尖端，97 岁的利夫顿每天继续在那里工作。九月，《在灾难中幸存》出版几天后，我去那里拜访了他。我们的对话记录已根据长度和清晰度进行了编辑。&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;我想了解一些对您的工作似乎很关键的术语。我想我应该从“极权主义”开始。&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;好吧，极权主义是一种全有-或-没有对意识形态的承诺。它涉及行动的冲动。这是一个封闭的状态，因为极权主义者通过他或她的意识形态来看待世界。极权主义者寻求拥有现实。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;当你说“极权主义者”时，你是指领导者或有抱负的领导者，还是任何其他致力于这种意识形态的人？&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;可以是其中之一。它可以是邪教的大师，也可以是类似邪教的安排。例如，特朗普主义运动在很多方面都像邪教一样。它公开地努力拥有现实，公开地表现出唯我论。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;它如何像邪教？&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;他形成了某种形式与追随者的关系。尤其是他的基础，正如他们所说，他最狂热的追随者，在某种程度上，他们在他的集会上以及他的言论或行为中体验到了高度的状态。&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>; &lt;strong>;你对极权主义的定义似乎与汉娜·阿伦特对极权主义意识形态的定义非常相似。区别在于它不仅适用于国家，还适用于较小的群体？&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;这就像极权主义的心理学版本，是的，适用于各种群体。正如我们现在所看到的，存在着一种对极权主义的渴望。主要是由于错位造成的。作为人类，我们身上有某种东西寻求固定性、明确性和绝对性。我们很容易受到极权主义的影响。但它在压力和混乱时期最为明显。当然，特朗普和他的盟友正在呼吁极权主义。特朗普本人没有能力维持真正连续的意识形态。但是，通过简单地宣称他的谎言是真实的并接受那种版本的极权主义，他就可以迷惑他的追随者，他们可以依靠他来了解世界上的每一个真理。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;你还有另一个伟大的术语： “终结思想的陈词滥调。”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;终结思想的陈词滥调被困在极权主义的语言中。因此，任何脱离极权主义的想法都是错误的，必须被终止。&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top: auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;c7m7w&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt; /div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;vedl2&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >; &lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;特朗普主义的例子是什么？&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt; p >;弥天大谎。特朗普公布的弥天大谎让所有人感到惊讶，如果不断地重复的话，它会被接受和相信的程度。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;这让你感到惊讶吗？&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;它做了。和其他人一样，我被愚弄了，因为我以为他会如此荒谬，以至于他一开始就不会被提名为总统。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;我的名单上的下一个是“造成暴行的情况”。&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;这对我来说非常重要。当我审视越南战争，尤其是反战退伍军人时，我觉得他们被置于一个产生暴行的境地。我的意思是军事政策和个人心理的结合。有一种愤怒的悲伤。事实上，所有美莱村大屠杀都可以被视为军事政策和愤怒悲伤的结合。这些人刚刚失去了他们心爱的老中士乔治·考克斯，他就像父亲一样。他踩到了一个诱杀装置。连长举行了仪式。他说：“该地区没有无辜平民。”他全权让他们杀死所有人。考克斯中士的悼词与军事政策相结合，引发了美莱村的屠杀，一上午就有近五百人被杀。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;你曾写道，那些在一场战争中犯下暴行的人在不同的情况下，产生暴行的情况永远不会发生。&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;人们会陷入产生暴行的情况情况并不比你我更暴力，也不比你我更道德或不道德。普通人犯下暴行。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;这使我们陷入“恶性常态”。&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;它描述了一种有害且具有破坏性的情况，但已变得习以为常，成为一种常态。规范，成为公认的行为。我通过观察恶性核常态得出了这一点。第二次世界大战后，人们认为我们可能不得不再次使用这种武器。在哈佛大学肯尼迪政府学院，一群教员写了一本名为《与核武器共存》的书。约瑟夫·奈有一本名为《核伦理学》的书。他的“核伦理”包括使用武器。后来出现了星球大战，反导导弹确实鼓励先发制人。这些都是恶性核正常的例子。其他例子是爱德华·泰勒（Edward Teller）和赫尔曼·卡恩（Herman Kahn）等人提出的设想，在这些设想中，我们可以使用武器并轻松地从核战争中恢复过来。我们可以赢得核战争。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;现在，根据世界末日时钟，我们比以往任何时候都更接近可能发生的核灾难。然而，似乎没有七八十年代那样普遍的恐惧感。&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;我认为在我们的脑海中，世界末日事件融合在一起。我看到核威胁和气候威胁之间有相似之处。查尔斯·斯特罗齐尔和我做了&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://thebulletin.org/2014/04/mind-and-habitat-nuclear-and-climate-threats-and-the-possibility-of-hope/ &quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://thebulletin.org/2014/04/mind-and-habitat-nuclear-and-climate- Threats-and-the-possibility-of-hope/&amp;quot;}&quot;

data- testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;“精神麻木”怎么样？&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;精神麻木是指感觉能力或倾向减弱。关于精神麻木的一点是，它可能类似于其他防御机制，例如解体或压抑：它只与感觉和非感觉有关。当然，精神麻木也可以起到保护作用。广岛的人们不得不麻木自己。奥斯威辛集中营的人们必须使自己变得非常麻木才能度过这段经历。人们会说，“在奥斯威辛集中营，我是一个不同的人。”他们会说：“我只是停止了感觉。”鉴于我们面临的灾难，生活的大部分内容都涉及在麻木和感觉之间保持平衡。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;您使用的一个相关概念来自马丁·布伯，是“想象真实”。&lt; /strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;这归功于 Martin Buber，但据我所知，没有人确切知道他在哪里使用它。这实际上意味着接受现实的困难。想象真实的情况对于想象我们的灾难并面对它们以及使无助的受害者成为促进更新和复原力的积极幸存者的转变是必要的。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;这与你的另一个人有什么关系？概念，核主义？&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;核主义是拥抱核武器来解决各种人类问题并承诺使用核武器。我谈到了奥本海默和尼尔斯·玻尔之间对核主义的一种奇怪的早期表达，尼尔斯·玻尔是奥本海默的伟大导师。玻尔来到洛斯阿拉莫斯。他们会进行抽象的对话。他们认为核武器既可以成为破坏和浩劫的根源，也可以成为美好的源泉，因为核武器的使用可以防止未来发生任何战争。这种观点从未离开过我们。奥本海默从未完全放弃这一点，不过，在其他时候，他说他手上沾满了鲜血——在他与杜鲁门的著名会面中。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;你看过电影《奥本海默》吗？&lt;/strong >;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;是的。我认为这是一部由一位才华横溢的电影制片人制作的精良电影。但它忽略了核主义这个问题。它错过了玻尔-奥本海默相互作用。最糟糕的是，它没有提及广岛发生的事情。这只是他对广岛的思念的一个转瞬即逝的画面。我的观点是，他成功制造武器是他个人灾难的根源。他对自己的遗产感到非常矛盾。我对此非常敏感，因为这就是我对奥本海默的关注的方式：通过研究广岛，在那里生活了六个月，然后问自己，原子弹的另一边发生了什么——那些制造原子弹的人它，用过它的人吗？他们经历了一种麻木。确实，奥本海默在与大型氢弹相关的问题上成为了核主义最激烈的批评者。这是他故事的一部分。奥本海默故事的寓意是我们需要废除死刑。这是唯一的人类解决方案。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;废除是指销毁所有现有武器？&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;是的，并且不再制造任何新武器。&lt;/p>; >;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;您一直在关注乌克兰战争吗？您认为普京参与核主义吗？&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot; s61vah&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;9di6sm&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt; /div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;我愿意。他不断威胁使用核武器。有些人认为他所能做的就是威胁自己。但我们不能总是确定。我认为他意识到核武器对人类的危险。他已经表现出了这种意识，他的发言人有时也表达了这一点。但我们永远无法完全知道。他的情绪是如此极端。&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;俄罗斯有一种弥赛亚意识形态。俄罗斯电视上的台词是：“如果我们炸毁世界，至少我们会直接进入天堂。他们只会嘎嘎叫。”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;核主义一直都有这样的想法。人们以某种​​方式感觉自己的群体将生存，而其他群体将死亡。当然，这是一种幻想，但它是我们针对核危险提出的众多幻想之一。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;您与反核运动中的前俄罗斯同行有联系吗？ ?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;我从未完全离开过反核运动。我特别积极参与医生社会责任活动。我们在国内不同的城市举行了会议——或者我们过去所说的爆炸——描述如果发生核战争将会发生什么。我们有一个非常简单的信息：我们是医生，我们希望能够在这场战争之后为你包扎伤口，但这实际上是不可能的，因为所有的医疗设施都将被摧毁，而且你可能会死，然后我们就死了。我们在国际上与获得诺贝尔和平奖的国际防止核战争医师组织也做了同样的事情。这项运动的一部分还没有得到足够的重视。苏联主要代表查佐夫是戈尔巴乔夫的朋友，他向戈尔巴乔夫灌输了这种共同安全的观点。戈尔巴乔夫很快就接受了我们拥有的核武器的观点。过去有一种敬酒的方式：无论是美国人还是苏联人都会站起来说：“我为你和你的领导人以及你的人民敬酒。还有你的生存，因为如果你生存，我们就生存。如果你死了，我们也会死。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;让我们谈谈变形论。&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;变形论当然是以臭名昭著的变形者普罗透斯（Proteus）的名字命名的。它暗示着一个动态的自我，它是多元的，而不是由固定的想法组成的，并且是可变的、可以转变的。千变万化和固定不变之间一直存在着斗争。多变论并不能保证我们取得成就或摆脱危险。但千变万化论更有可能将我们带向物种心态。物种心态意味着我们关心人类的命运。每当我们采取行动反对气候变化或新冠肺炎，甚至是对我们民主程序的威胁时，我们都是在代表人类表达自己的意见。物种自我和物种承诺对于我们摆脱这些困境至关重要。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;下一个术语：“见证专业人士。”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;我去了广岛因为我本来就是反核的。当我到达那里时，我发现，在原子弹投下十七年后，还没有对那个城市以及其中的人群所发生的事情进行全面的、包容性的研究。我想进行一项科学研究，制定一个方案并向每个人询问类似的问题——尽管我通过鼓励他们联系来改变了我的方法。但我也意识到我想见证那个城市发生的事情。我想告诉世界。我想从心理学专业人士的角度重述那个城市发生的事情。这就是我如何将自己视为一名见证专业人士。这是一种积极见证的形式。广岛有人见证了这场斗争。其中一位是在城市边缘的历史学家，他说：“我低头一看，发现广岛已经消失了。”这座城市消失的景象一直萦绕在我的脑海中，并成为我后来生活的中心。我脑海中不断回荡的画面是，一架飞机，一枚炸弹，一座城市。我清楚地表明——至少一开始是对我自己，然后也许是对其他人来说——我们需要专业人士和其他人来见证并采取行动。&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/p>; div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >; &lt;div data-node-id=&quot;9l0odq&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid =&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;我的列表上还剩下两个术语。一是“幸存者”。&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;我对无助的受害者和幸存者进行了区分作为变革的推动者。在我的广岛书的最后，我有一个很长的部分描述了幸存者。大灾难的幸存者是相当特殊的。因为他们对人类的延续存在怀疑。遭受痛苦的家庭损失或失去亲人的幸存者都需要赋予这种生存意义。如果不是幸存者，人们可以声称自己是幸存者；幸存者有时会将自己的挫败感发泄到周围的人身上。幸存者面临各种各样的问题。尽管如此，幸存者通过他们的经历获得了其他人所不具备的某些知识。幸存者们说“奥斯维辛很可怕，但我很高兴能有这样的经历”，这让我感到惊讶。听到这样的事情我很惊讶。当然，他们并不是真的喜欢它。但他们想说的是，他们通过自己所经历的事情意识到自己有一定的价值和重要性。这就是我所认为的幸存者力量或幸存者智慧。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;您对当代美国人对“幸存者”和“受害者”这两个词的使用有何看法？&lt;/strong>;&lt;/ p>;&lt;p>;我们仍然对这两个术语感到困惑。特朗普主义者开始将自己视为受害者而不是幸存者。他们是所谓“盗窃”的受害者。当他们将自己视为受害者时，他们就会表现出一种正义感。他们甚至可以制定一个虚假的幸存者使命，维持弥天大谎。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;我清单上的最后一个术语是“生命的连续性”。&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;可以这么说，当我完成第一项研究时，我想要一个关于我所做的事情的理论。 [精神分析学家]埃里克·埃里克森谈到了身份。我可以说中国共产主义就是将中国孝子的身份转变为孝顺的共产党人。但谈到广岛时，埃里克森在作品中并没有太多谈到死亡问题。我意识到我必须得出一个不同的想法，那就是死亡和生命的连续性。在广岛，我确实面临着大规模的死亡，但也面临着生命连续性的问题，因为受害者可以将自己转变为幸存者。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;就像你的其他一些想法一样，这使得我想起了阿伦特的作品。对她来说重要的是每次出生都是一个新的开始，一个新的政治可能性。而且，与此相关的是，我们与极权主义的胜利之间的障碍是“人类的最高能力”发明新事物。&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;我认为她在那里说的是人类的思想在做一切事情。这。人类的思想是如此多面且令人惊讶。而且有时还很矛盾。它可以接受它本身可以创造的最疯狂的主张。这是一个令人震惊的认识。人类自我可以带我们去任何地方。&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;rrwrp7&quot;>; &lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/ div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;54nrcf&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;我再问你一个问题阿伦特问题。您的“恶性常态”概念与她的“邪恶平庸”之间有相似之处吗？&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;有。当阿伦特谈到“邪恶的平庸性”时，我同意——从某种意义上说，邪恶可以是对产生暴行的情况的反应，它可以由普通人来实施。 But I would modify it a little bit and say that after one has been involved in committing evil, one changes. The person is no longer so banal. Nor is the evil, of course.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;Your late wife, BJ, was a member of the Wellfleet Group. Your new partner, Nancy Rosenblum, makes appearances in your new book. Can I ask you to talk about combining your romantic, domestic, and intellectual relationships?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In the case of BJ, she was a kind of co-host with me to the meetings for all those fifty years and she had lots of intellectual ideas of her own, as a reformer in adoption and an authority on the psychology of adoption. And in the case of Nancy Rosenblum, as you know, she&#39;s a very accomplished political theorist. She came to speak at Wellfleet. She gave a very humorous talk called “Activist Envy.” She had always been a very progressive theorist and has taken stands but never considered herself an activist, whereas just about everybody at the Wellfleet meeting combined scholarship and activism.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;People have been talking more about love in later life. It&#39;s very real, and it&#39;s a different form of love, because, you know, one is quite formed at that stage of life. And perhaps has a better knowledge of who one is. And what a relationship is and what it can be. But there&#39;s still something called love that has an intensity and a special quality that is beyond the everyday, and it actually has been crucial to me and my work in the last decade or so. And actually, I&#39;ve been helpful to Nancy, too, because we have similar interests, although we come to them from different intellectual perspectives. We talk a lot about things. That&#39;s been a really special part of my life for the last decade. On the other hand, she&#39;s also quite aware of my age and situation. The threat of death—or at least the loss of capacity to function well—hovers over me. You asked me whether I have a fear of death. I&#39;m sure I do. I&#39;m not a religious figure who has transcended all this. For me, part of the longevity is a will to live and a desire to live. To continue working and continue what is a happy situation for me.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;You&#39;re about twenty years older than Nancy, right?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Twenty-one years older.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;So you are at different stages in your lives.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Very much. It means that she does a lot of things, with me and for me, that enable me to function. It has to do with a lot of details and personal help. I sometimes get concerned about that because it becomes very demanding for her. She&#39;s now working on a book on ungoverning. She needs time and space for that work.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;2e99f8&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;What is your work routine? Are you still seeing patients?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;I don&#39;t. Very early on, I found that even having one patient, one has to be interested in that patient and available for that patient. It somehow interrupted my sense of being an intense researcher. So I stopped seeing patients quite a long time ago. I get up in the morning and have breakfast. Not necessarily all that early. I do a lot of good sleeping. Check my e-mails after breakfast. And then pretty much go to work at my desk at nine-thirty or ten. And stay there for a couple of hours or more. Have a late lunch. Nap, at some point. A little bit before lunch and then late in the day as well. I can close my eyes for five minutes and feel restored. I learned that trick from my father, from whom I learned many things. I&#39;m likely to go back to my desk after lunch and to work with an assistant. My method is sort of laborious, but it works for me. I dictate the first few drafts. And then look at it on the computer and correct it, and finally turn it into written work.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I can&#39;t drink anymore, unfortunately. I never drank much, but I used to love a Scotch before dinner or sometimes a vodka tonic. Now I drink mostly water or Pellegrino. We will have that kind of drink at maybe six o&#39;clock and maybe listen to some news. These days, we get tired of the news. But a big part of my routine is to find an alternate universe. And that&#39;s sports. I&#39;m a lover of baseball. I&#39;m still an avid fan of the Los Angeles Dodgers, even though they moved from Brooklyn to Los Angeles in 1957. You&#39;d think that my protean self would let them go. Norman Mailer, who also is from Brooklyn, said, “They moved away. I say, &#39;Fuck them.&#39; ” But there&#39;s a deep sense of loyalty in me. I also like to watch football, which is interesting, because I disapprove of much football. It&#39;s so harmful to its participants. So, it&#39;s a clear-cut, conscious contradiction. It&#39;s also a very interesting game, which has almost a military-like arrangement and shows very special skills and sudden intensity.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;Is religion important to you?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I don&#39;t have any formal religion. And I really dislike most religious groups. When I tried to arrange a bar mitzvah for my son, all my progressive friends, rabbis or not, somehow insisted you had to join a temple and participate. I didn&#39;t. I couldn&#39;t do any of those things. He never was bar mitzvah. But in any case, I see religion as a great force in human experience. Like many people, I make a distinction between a certain amount of spirituality and formal religion. One rabbi friend once said to me, “You&#39;re more religious than I am.” That had to do with intense commitments to others. I have a certain respect for what religion can do. We once had a distinguished religious figure come to our study to organize a conference on why religion can be so contradictory. It can serve humankind and their spirit and freedom and it can suppress their freedom. Every religion has both of those possibilities. So, when there is an atheist movement, I don&#39;t join it because it seems to be as intensely anti-religious as the religious people are committed to religion. I&#39;ve been friendly with [the theologian] Harvey Cox, who was brought up as a fundamentalist and always tried to be a progressive fundamentalist, which is a hard thing to do. He would promise me every year that the evangelicals are becoming more progressive, but they never have.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;cazc7m&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;ti04io&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;Can you tell me about the Wellfleet Group? How did it function?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The Wellfleet Group has been very central to my life. It lasted for fifty years. It began as an arena for disseminating Erik Erikson&#39;s ideas. When the building of my Wellfleet home was completed, in the mid-sixties, it included a little shack. We put two very large oak tables at the center of it. Erik and I had talked about having meetings, and that was immediately a place to do it. So the next year, in &#39;66, we began the meetings. I was always the organizer, but Erik always had a kind of veto power. You didn&#39;t want anybody who criticized him in any case. And then it became increasingly an expression of my interests. I presented my Hiroshima work there and my work with veterans and all kinds of studies. Over time, the meetings became more activist. For instance, in 1968, right after the terrible uprising [at the Democratic National Convention] that was so suppressed, Richard Goodwin came and described what happened.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Under my control, the meeting increasingly took up issues of war and peace. And nuclear weapons. I never believed that people with active antipathies should get together until they recognize what they have in common. I don&#39;t think that&#39;s necessarily productive or indicative. I think one does better to surround oneself with people of a general similarity in world view who sustain one another in their originality. The Wellfleet meetings became a mixture of the academic and non-academic in the usual sense of that word. But also a sort of soirée, where all kinds of interesting minds could exchange thoughts. We would meet once a year, at first for a week or so and then for a few days, and they were very intense. And then there was a Wellfleet meeting underground, where, when everybody left the meeting, whatever it was—nine or ten at night—they would drink at local motels, where they stayed, and have further thoughts, though I wasn&#39;t privy to that.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;How many people participated?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;This shack could hold as many as forty people. We ended them after the fiftieth year. We were all getting older, especially me. But then, even after the meetings ended, we had luncheons in New York, which we called Wellfleet in New York, or luncheons in Wellfleet, which we called Wellfleet in Wellfleet. You asked whether I miss them. I do, in a way. But it&#39;s one of what I call renunciations, not because I want to get rid of them but because a moment in life comes when you must get rid of them, just as I had to stop playing tennis eventually. I played tennis from my twenties through my sixties. Certainly, the memories of them are very important to me. I remember moments from different meetings, but also just the meetings themselves, because, perhaps, the communal idea was as important as any.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;Do you find it easy to adjust to your physical environment? This was Nancy&#39;s place?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;ilfr4&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Yes, this is Nancy&#39;s place. Much more equipped for the Cape winters and just a more solid house. For us to do all the things, including medical things she helps me with, this house was much more suitable. Even the walk between the main house and my study [in Wellfleet] required effort. So we&#39;ve been living here now for about four years. And we&#39;ve enjoyed it. Of course, the view helps. I wake up every morning and look out to kind of take stock. What&#39;s happening? Is it sunny or cloudy? What boats are visible? And then we go on with the day.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;In the new book, you praise President Biden and Vice-President Harris for their early efforts to commemorate people who had died of &lt;em >;COVID&lt;/em>;. Do you feel that is an example of the sort of sustained narrative that you say is necessary?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;It&#39;s hard to create the collective mourning that &lt;em >;COVID&lt;/em>; requires. Certainly, the Biden Administration, right at its beginning, made a worthwhile attempt to do that, when they lit those lights around the pool near the Lincoln Memorial, four hundred of them, for the four hundred thousand Americans who had died. And then there was another ceremony. And they encouraged people to put candles in their windows or ring bells, to make it participatory. But it&#39;s hard to sustain that. There are proposals for a memorial for &lt;em >;COVID&lt;/em>;. It&#39;s hard to do and yet worth trying.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;You observe that the 1918 pandemic is virtually gone from memory.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;That&#39;s an amazing thing. Fifty million people. The biggest pandemic anywhere ever. And almost no public commemoration of it. When &lt;em >;COVID&lt;/em>; came along, there wasn&#39;t a model which could have perhaps served as some way of understanding. They used similar forms of masks and distancing. But there was no public remembrance of it.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;Some scholars have suggested that it&#39;s because there are no heroes and no villains, no military-style imagery to rely on to create a commemoration.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Well, that&#39;s true. It&#39;s also in a way true of climate. And yet there are survivors of it. And they have been speaking out. They form groups. Groups called Long &lt;em >;COVID&lt;/em>; SOS or Widows of &lt;em >;COVID-19&lt;/em>; or &lt;em >;COVID&lt;/em>; Survivors for Change. They have names that suggest that they are committed to telling the society about it and improving the society&#39;s treatment of it.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;Your book “The Climate Swerve,” published in 2017, seemed very hopeful. You wrote about the beginning of a species-wide agreement. Has this hope been tempered?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I don&#39;t think I&#39;m any less hopeful than I was when I wrote “The Climate Swerve.” In my new book [“Surviving Our Catastrophes”], the hope is still there, but the focus is much more on survivor wisdom and survivor power. In either case, I was never completely optimistic—but hopeful that there are these possibilities.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;There&#39;s something else I&#39;d like to mention that&#39;s happened in my old age. I&#39;ve had a long interaction with psychoanalysis. Erik Erikson taught me how to be ambivalent about psychoanalysis. It was a bigger problem for him, in a way, because he came from it completely and yet turned against its fixity when it was overly traditionalized. In my case, I knew it was important, but I also knew it could be harmful because it was so traditionalized. I feared that my eccentric way of life might be seen as neurotic. But now, in my older age, the analysts want me. A couple of them approached me a few years ago to give the keynote talk at a meeting on my work. I was surprised but very happy to do it. They were extremely warm as though they were itching to, in need of, bringing psychoanalysis into society, and recognizing more of the issues that I was concerned with, having to do with totalism and fixity. Since then, they&#39;ve invited me to publish in their journal.

A more “normal” life might have been to open up an office on the Upper West Side to see psychoanalytical, psychotherapeutic patients. And to work regularly with the psychoanalytic movement. I found myself seeking a different kind of life.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;Tell me about the moment when you decided to seek a different kind of life.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In 1954, my wife and I had been living in Hong Kong for just three months, and I&#39;d been interviewing Chinese students and intellectuals, and Western scholars and diplomats, and China-watchers and Westerners who had been in China and imprisoned. I was fascinated by thought reform because it was a coercive effort at change based on self-criticism and confession. I wanted to stay there, but at that time, I had done nothing. I hadn&#39;t had my psychiatric residency and I hadn&#39;t entered psychoanalytic training. Also, my money was running out. My wife, BJ, was OK either way. I walked through the streets thinking about it and wondering, and I came back after a long walk through Hong Kong and said, “Look, we just can&#39;t stay. I don&#39;t see any way we can.” But the next day, I was asking her to help type up an application for a local research grant that would enable me to stay. It was a crucial decision because it was the beginning of my identity as a &lt;em>;psychiatrist in the world&lt;/em>;.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;You have been professionally active for seventy-five years. This allows you to do something almost no one else on the planet can do: connect and compare events such as the Second World War, the Korean War, the nuclear race, the climate crisis, and the &lt;em >;COVID&lt;/em>; pandemic. It&#39;s a particularly remarkable feat during this ahistorical moment.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Absolutely. But in a certain sense, there&#39;s no such thing as an ahistorical time. Americans can seem ahistorical, but history is always in us. It helps create us. That&#39;s what the psychohistorical approach is all about. For me to have that long flow of history, yes, I felt, gave me a perspective.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;You called the twentieth century “an extreme century.” What are your thoughts on the twenty-first?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The twentieth century brought us Auschwitz and Hiroshima. The twenty-first, I guess, brought us Trump. And a whole newly intensified right wing. Some call it populism. But it&#39;s right-wing fanaticism and violence. We still have the catastrophic threats. And they are now sustained threats. There have been some writers who speak of all that we achieved over the course of the twentieth century and the first decades of the twenty-first century. And that&#39;s true. There are achievements in the way of having overcome slavery and torture—for the most part, by no means entirely, but seeing it as bad. Having created institutions that serve individuals. But our so-called better angels are in many ways defeated by right-wing fanaticism.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;If you could still go out and conduct interviews, what would you want to study?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I might want to study people who are combating fanaticism and their role in institutions. And I might also want to study people who are attracted to potential violence—not with the hope of winning them over but of further grasping their views. That was the kind of perspective from which I studied Nazi doctors. I&#39;ve interviewed people both of a kind I was deeply sympathetic to and of a kind I was deeply antagonistic toward.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;Is there anything I haven&#39;t asked you about?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I would say something on this idea of hope and possibility. My temperament is in the direction of hopefulness. Sometimes, when Nancy and I have discussions, she&#39;s more pessimistic and I more hopeful with the same material at hand. I have a temperament toward hopefulness. But for me to sustain that hopefulness, I require evidence. And I seek that evidence in my work. ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;enry3u&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot;

For Democrats, the opening stages of the ride were particularly grim. A &lt;em>;Times&lt;/em>;/Siena College poll published last weekend found that, of the six swing states that are expected to decide the election, President Joe Biden trails Donald Trump in all but one—Wisconsin—and would likely lose if the vote were held today. Within the Democratic Party, the possibility of another four years of Trump was alarming on a spiritual level, and panic set in. Barack Obama&#39;s political guru David Axelrod suggested in a post that Biden needed to decide whether a second run is “in &lt;em >;his&lt;/em>; best interest or the country&#39;s.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;During the Biden era, polls have tended to signal doom for Democratic candidates, but elections have generally turned out all right for them. For all the foreboding in the air, last Tuesday&#39;s Election Night went well for the Democrats, who once again campaigned on abortion rights, and once again won. In deep-red Kentucky, not only did the popular young Democratic governor, Andy Beshear, comfortably win a second term but he pulled back some coal counties in Appalachia that had been thought lost to his party. In Virginia, where Republicans had expended immense effort to try to win a state Senate majority for Governor Glenn Youngkin, they not only failed but lost control of the state House, too. In Ohio, which Trump won handily twice, a ballot initiative to guarantee abortion access in the state constitution passed, fifty-seven to forty-three per cent. Now it was the Republicans&#39; turn to panic. The conservative pundit Ann Coulter wrote online, “&lt;em >;pro-lifers are going to wipe out the republican party&lt;/em>;.” Could it really be the case that voters want what the Democrats are offering, while recoiling from their President?&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Maybe so. This is a country, after all, of high variance. When Biden was picked as the Party&#39;s nominee in 2020, it was done the way you might select a contractor—his skills were specific to the job at hand. Trump had succeeded in 2016 by casting the Democrats as the party of liberal culture warriors and future-obsessed élites, and by winning the support of voters without college degrees. Biden had run for President twice before, generating little enthusiasm, but in 2020 he played the safe hand—not too new, not too radical, not too coastal or élite, the nice guy to Trump&#39;s unceasing invective. Democratic primary voters fixated on denying Trump another term to a sometimes unnerving degree. Campaign reporters often found voters less concerned about explaining why they liked a particular candidate than about asking how the candidate was playing before other, more decisive groups of voters in different parts of the country. It was an unusual situation. It was also perfect for Biden.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;The situation is a bit different this time. What is plaguing Biden&#39;s 2024 campaign is a more basic lack of interest, especially among young voters, nonwhite voters, and those without college degrees. In 2020, Biden won nonwhite voters under the age of forty-five by thirty-nine points, but according to the &lt;em>;Times&lt;/em>;/Siena poll he now leads among that group by just six points, and is essentially tied with Trump among voters younger than twenty-nine. Biden&#39;s problems have something to do with a general impression—held by seventy-one per cent of respondents, compared with thirty-nine per cent for Trump—that he is simply too old to be President. Yet voters also believe by wide margins—fifty-nine per cent to thirty-seven—that Trump would be better than Biden at managing the economy. The sharp rise in prices seems to figure more for voters than the continuously strong jobs numbers that the White House has been trying to tout. Young and nonwhite voters usually support Democrats, which might make the White House optimistic that Biden can win them back. But the specific complaints that voters have are hard for Biden to do much about. Prices are high because of the way the global economy has rebounded from the pandemic. He&#39;s old because of the inexorable march of time.&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Is the 2024 election just another iteration of the same dynamic that has been in place since Trump descended his escalator? Call this campaign Act III of the political horror serial titled “Trump.” And yet Trump himself—who has denied any wrongdoing, but is facing trial for everything from saying that his apartment was three times its actual size, in order to get better loan terms, to trying to overturn a Presidential election—isn&#39;t exactly the same. He is skipping the Republican primary debates and otherwise scarcely campaigning, holding occasional rallies before crowds to whom he mocks his opponents and vows that he&#39;ll win redemption following 2020. Few seem especially roused by Trump&#39;s campaign, in any event. That seems the biggest difference. Democrats describe this election as if democracy itself were on the ballot, and, given Trump&#39;s talk of dismantling the nonpartisan civil service and of “retribution,” in some senses it may well be. But the mood on the trail and in the polls isn&#39;t of an apocalyptic fight against authoritarianism; with young voters tuning out, and two candidates who are broadly disliked, it&#39;s of creeping democratic exhaustion.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;It has been an exhausting few years. Trump seems pretty fatigued—there have been a lot of depositions. So does Biden, who is now trying to manage two wars indirectly, one of which has required linking his reputation to his old antagonist Benjamin Netanyahu. In nearly three years as President, Biden has accomplished much of what he might reasonably have been expected to, given the tight legislative margins: managing the economic turmoil of &lt;em >;covid&lt;/em>;, investing in infrastructure to spur the economy&#39;s green transition, restoring traditional overseas alliances in the fight for a free Ukraine. The result of all this achievement has been that he has gone from being a popular politician to an unpopular one.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Democratic partisans might object that evaluating a Presidency after three years is like asking a homeowner how she feels about a renovation project that&#39;s only partway done. (“Well, there&#39;s no roof yet—somewhat disapprove.”) Maybe worries about abortion rights and the Trumpist threat to democracy will carry Biden to victory next fall, as they have done for the Democrats in the past few elections. But the danger encoded in the polls is that enough voters might come to see Biden as embodying a stagnant status quo and Trump as the alternative to it, which feels a little too close for comfort to 2016. ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;uscfop&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;537vs&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 12 Nov 2023 20:06:01 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[For a Hungry Book Critic, Every Word Is a Feast]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/for-a-hungry-book-critic-every-word-is-a-feast]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-12T11:00:00.000Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654eb77d196ca235debd5692/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Schwartz-Garner.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;article >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attribute-verso-pattern=&quot;article-body&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;ArticlePageChunks&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;It is a hazard to read on an empty stomach. What is it about words that makes things taste so delicious? I can still recall the twelfth-grade English class, held just before lunch, in which we were cruelly called upon to analyze, well, lunch: the sumptuous one described by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1954/03/06/a-consciousness-of-reality&quot;>;Virginia Woolf&lt;/a>; at the start of “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Room-Ones-Own-Virginia-Woolf/dp/1614272778&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Room-Ones-Own-Virginia-Woolf/dp/1614272778&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Room-Ones-Own-Virginia-Woolf/dp/1614272778&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;A Room of One&#39;s Own&lt;/a>;,” involving soles in cream, partridges “with all their retinue of sauces and salads,” sprouts “foliated as rosebuds but more succulent,” and a pudding so spectacular that to “relate it to rice and tapioca would be an insult.” I had never tasted partridge. I still have never tasted partridge. Described by Woolf, it is my favorite food.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Reading while hungry is not a predicament known to Dwight Garner, because, as he tells us in “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Upstairs-Delicatessen-Eating-Reading-About/dp/0374603421&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Upstairs-Delicatessen-Eating-Reading-About/dp/0374603421&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Upstairs-Delicatessen-Eating-Reading-About/dp/0374603421&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;The Upstairs Delicatessen&lt;/a>;,” his winning new book, he cannot read without also eating, and, as a book critic for the &lt;em>;Times&lt;/em>;, he reads quite a bit. The association between these two sustaining pleasures began long ago, during his boyhood in West Virginia and Florida. Garner takes a good hard look in memory&#39;s mirror and tells us what he sees: “a soft kid, inclined toward embonpoint, &#39;husky&#39; in the department-store lingo, a brown-eyed boy with chafing thighs.” Riding his bicycle home from school beneath the blazing Gulf Coast sun, “sizzled crisp and pink with sweat,” he sounds fairly edible himself.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Garner&#39;s early reading tastes were indiscriminate; the library kept him well stocked. His eating habits were necessarily narrower, dependent on the supplies his parents had in the kitchen. He liked pretzels, mayonnaise-and-cheese sandwiches, Hydrox cookies with milk, and potato chips. The bread was white; the drink was red, made from a mix. “Everyone wasn&#39;t a sophisticate,” he writes. His father&#39;s people were “coal miners and gunsmiths, all of them hunters.” Their freezer was full of venison. Fascinatingly, Garner&#39;s paternal grandfather was a follower of Horace Fletcher, aka the Great Masticator, one of those freaky food influencers of the Victorian era, who advised chewing a meal until it turned to liquid in the mouth. Garner&#39;s mother was not an enthusiastic cook—her cuisine was heavy on Kraft and Cool Whip—but, many years later, he remains devoted to the memory of her egg foo yong.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;From these undistinguished origins arose Garner the gourmand. He loves to eat and to drink, to cook and be cooked for, to stay in and to go out. Some of his tastes, he feels, demand defending; he gives a few paragraphs over to the furor that erupted when, in 2012, he declared his love for the peanut-butter-and-pickle sandwich. But his credentials are convincing. He belongs to something called “an offal club,” has slaughtered at least one rooster in his time, and suffers from gout. In a past life, he delivered pizza for Domino&#39;s.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;A really good eater, like a really good reader, must have two qualities in abundance: curiosity and capacity. Plainly, in the food department, Garner has both. When he lived in Garrison, New York, he indulged in an impressive ritual on his commute from the city: a Martini at Jimmy&#39;s Corner, the legendary midtown boxing bar, followed by oysters at Grand Central Oyster Bar, and then, upon arrival at home, a steak dinner prepared by his wife, the writer Cree LeFavour, who was then working on her cookbook “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/New-Steak-Recipes-Range-Savory/dp/1580088902&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/New-Steak-Recipes-Range-Savory/dp/1580088902&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/New-Steak-Recipes-Range-Savory/dp/1580088902&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;The New Steak&lt;/a>;.” One of the big subjects of Garner&#39;s book is happiness, and much of his seems to be owed to LeFavour. She grew up in a family of adventurous restaurateurs. “In the kitchen, Cree and I are opposites,” he writes—she cooks by feel, he by recipe—and the same goes for them as eaters:&lt;/p>;&lt;blockquote >;&lt;div >;&lt;p>;She&#39;ll have the in-season fruit with yogurt; I&#39;ll take the three-cheese omelet with home fries. She has never, to the best of my knowledge, eaten in a food court or on an airplane because it wouldn&#39;t occur to her. Why not wait for something better? I smell the warm cookies in first class and can&#39;t wait for my little tub of indistinct protein—is that a belly-button lint cutlet?—to arrive in 23D.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/blockquote>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Needless to say, the relationship has thrived.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Garner is a good host; he doesn&#39;t just talk about himself. Memoir, thoughts about food, and literary criticism are stacked, in “The Upstairs Delicatessen,” like the bright layers of a Venetian cookie, in chapters devoted to breakfast, lunch, drinking, and dinner, plus one on grocery shopping (Garner eschews the easy romance of the greenmarket for the frigid, fluorescent abundance of the American supermarket) and another on swimming and napping, two activities that provide a necessary break in his daily dining project. (One quibble: where is the chapter about cleaning up?) Garner&#39;s literary cellar is vast, and he always has just the right quote or anecdote ready to decant. In “Breakfast,” for instance, we learn that Thomas Hardy&#39;s favorite morning meal was a stew of parsley, onions, and bread that bore the unappetizing name of “kettle-broth,” and are given convincing evidence that “no writer has attended to mornings and their promise as closely as has Toni Morrison.” In “Lunch,” a riff on the place of hot dogs in American life skips from HL Mencken to Philip Roth, Audre Lorde, Larry McMurtry, and Vivian Gornick. One nice thing about Garner&#39;s book is that he doesn&#39;t just go for the classics. Younger or more recently published writers like Bryan Washington, Viet Thanh Nguyen, and Anthony Veasna So all have a place at his table.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Reading Garner got me thinking about the literary food I have loved. There are the preposterously lavish feasts of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2002/05/06/an-unsimple-heart&quot;>;Flaubert&lt;/a>;&#39;s “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Sentimental-Education-Oxford-Worlds-Classics/dp/0192836226&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Sentimental-Education-Oxford-Worlds-Classics/dp/0192836226&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Sentimental-Education-Oxford-Worlds-Classics/dp/0192836226&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;Sentimental Education&lt;/a>;,” like one that Frédéric, the novel&#39;s hero, is treated to soon after his arrival in Paris: “He had ten sorts of mustard to choose from. He ate gazpacho, curry, ginger, Corsican blackbirds, Roman lasagne; he drank extraordinary wines, lip-fraoli, and Tokay.” On the other end of the spectrum is the earthy meal enjoyed by Aimée, the female con artist in Jean-Patrick Manchette&#39;s noir novel “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Fatale-York-Review-Books-Classics/dp/1590173813&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Fatale-York-Review-Books-Classics/dp/1590173813&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Fatale-York-Review-Books-Classics/dp/1590173813&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;Fatale&lt;/a>;,” who celebrates the completion of a job by rubbing herself with stolen banknotes and eating a choucroute “which smelt like piss and sperm.” Then there is picky Mr. Woodhouse, father to Emma in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/10/05/how-to-misread-jane-austen&quot;>;Jane Austen&lt;/a>;&#39;s “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Emma-Penguin-Classics-Jane-Austen/dp/0141439580&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Emma-Penguin-Classics-Jane-Austen/dp/0141439580&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Emma-Penguin-Classics-Jane-Austen/dp/0141439580&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;Emma&lt;/a>;,” who feels that food was put on this Earth to kill him. “While his hospitality would have welcomed his visitors to every thing,” Austen writes, “his care for their health made him grieve that they would eat.” Every so often, he makes an exception. “You and I will have a nice basin of gruel together,” he tells his daughter—a ghastly invitation, warmly extended.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;One of the best-ever openings of a short story can be found in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/05/08/the-art-and-activism-of-grace-paley&quot;>;Grace Paley&lt;/a>;&#39;s “The Used-Boy Raisers,” in which Faith, the narrator, cooks breakfast for two men, her husband and her ex:&lt;/p>;&lt;blockquote >;&lt;div >;&lt;p>;There were two husbands disappointed by eggs.&lt;br/>;I don&#39;t like them that way either, I said. Make your own eggs. They sighed in unison.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/blockquote>;&lt;p >;Paley had a way with verbs. In the same story, Faith does not brew a pot of coffee but &lt;em>;kindles&lt;/em>; it. Later, after the men have finally, thank God, left, she will pour some into a mug that says “MAMA” to enjoy a private moment with her thoughts. “How fortunate we are to be food-consuming animals,” &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1998/07/27/elegy-for-iris&quot;>;Iris Murdoch&lt;/a>; wrote. And how fortunate, too, to be word-consuming ones, because reading, like eating, never ends. ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;t6edvi&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;hlqfp6&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 12 Nov 2023 20:06:01 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[The Long Wait of the Families of Hamas Hostages]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.newyorker.com/news/letter-from-israel/the-long-wait-of-the-hostages-families]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-11T18:07:36.374Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654e9feda4270d0a74e36a66/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Margalit-Families-Hostages-B0027144.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;article >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attribute-verso-pattern=&quot;article-body&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;ArticlePageChunks&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Tal Levy may be six feet four, but he does not stand out in a crowd. He speaks softly and hesitantly, and prefers to look away whenever people stare at the poster he is holding, which has a photograph of his younger brother and a single word: “&lt;em >;KIDNAPPED&lt;/em>;.” Levy&#39;s brother Or is one of the two hundred and forty people held in captivity in Gaza. Last Saturday night, a throng of hostages&#39; families and hundreds of sympathizers gathered outside the Tel Aviv Museum of Art—an area now known as Hostage Square—shouting “&lt;em>;Achshav&lt;/em>;!” (“Now!”) Levy, who is thirty-five, joined, his voice rising to no more than a whisper.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;On the night of October 6th, Or slept over at his in-laws&#39; home, in the central town of Rishon LeZiyyon, with his wife and two-year-old son. At daybreak, Or, who is thirty-three, and his wife, Eynav, thirty-two, left their son sleeping in bed while they drove south to attend an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/dispatch/when-massacre-came-to-a-music-festival-in-israel&quot;>;outdoor music festival&lt;/a>;, Nova—music was a shared passion of theirs. They arrived at the party shortly after 6 &lt;em >;AM&lt;/em>; Some twenty minutes later, Hamas militants breached the fence from Gaza and stormed the site. Or and Eynav took cover in a public bomb shelter, but dozens of gunmen were throwing grenades and firing into the shelters and the bushes where partygoers had been hiding. Speaking on the phone with his mother that morning, Or told her, “You don&#39;t want to know what&#39;s happening here.” At 7:33 &lt;em >;AM&lt;/em>;, all communication with him stopped.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Levy&#39;s mother then called him, sounding panicked. “I thought she was exaggerating,” Levy told me. “I was actually angry with her for waking me up.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;On October 10th, Eynav&#39;s body was identified near the site of the party. Four days later, a military officer and two social workers knocked on the door of Or&#39;s parents&#39; home and delivered a message: Or had been kidnapped and was being held in Gaza. It&#39;s unclear how the military was able to ascertain this fact. A third brother, an employee at TikTok Israel, had scoured dozens of Hamas videos online—a grisly method many relatives of the missing resorted to in order to learn news about their loved ones—but he did not find any footage of Or.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“At first, when they told us that he was kidnapped, I was relieved,” Levy said. “It didn&#39;t feel as helpless as him being missing. But then the feeling of helplessness returned. Because now what?” Amid the grief over Eynav and the uncertainty and fear over Or, Levy, along with his longtime boyfriend, Yoav Weinfeld, found himself a caretaker for his nephew, Almog—yet another role no one had prepared him for.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;As Israel marks a month since &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/dispatch/waking-to-an-attack-from-hamas&quot;>;it was invaded&lt;/a>; by a Hamas-led force that committed massacres along Israel&#39;s southern communities—and retaliated with air strikes, cutting off Gaza City from the rest of the coastal enclave—the families of more than two hundred &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-plight-of-the-hostages-and-the-rapidly-escalating-crisis-in-gaza&quot;>;hostages held by Hamas&lt;/a>; and by other Palestinian armed groups are living in a nightmarish state of limbo: not knowing the fates of their loved ones, or whether they will see them again. “They just &lt;em>;vanished&lt;/em>;,” Levy said, of his brother and sister-in-law.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Levy&#39;s daily life has been upended. Every other morning this past month, he and Weinfeld have driven from their apartment in Jaffa to Levy&#39;s parents&#39; home to spend the day with Almog: play with him, feed him, bathe him, put him to bed. Levy is the only one who is able to accomplish the latter—perhaps, he thinks, because of his resemblance to his younger brother. At first, whenever Levy or Weinfeld was in a car with Almog, he would repeat a phrase they didn&#39;t understand which sounded like “ice ache.” Then Levy remembered driving with Or and Eynav once and seeing them give their son rice cakes. “Children should come with an instruction manual in case the parents disappear,” Levy said, with a faint smile.&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;For now, he worries that he and Weinfeld are ill-equipped to deal with Almog&#39;s many questions, which will only increase with time. “He says that he wants to go home, and that he wants his mom and dad,” Levy said. “We don&#39;t know what to tell him.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Anxiety has set in; so has sleeplessness. Levy also detailed some of the more prosaic aspects of being the brother of a captive: “An Internet bill arrives in their home. Do I pay it? And electricity? And water? Someone needs to clear out their fridge, because things have been rotting. And water the plants. What do I do with their apartment? If he comes back—&lt;em>;when&lt;/em>; he comes back—will he even want to live there anymore?”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Many family members of those kidnapped describe a paralyzing awareness that time may be running out. “There&#39;s a lot of public empathy, but it&#39;s not translated into action, and that can drive you crazy,” Shaked Haran, who has nine relatives who were taken hostage, told me recently. “Every day, it gets harder,” Levy said. “It&#39;s as if I live with a timer now that&#39;s always on.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;The sense of urgency has been compounded by the Israeli air strikes—a campaign considered &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/25/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-airstrikes.html&quot;>;one of the harshest&lt;/a>; in the twenty-first century—coupled with a ground incursion, which the Israeli military launched last month. These have claimed an extraordinary number of Palestinian lives—eleven thousand so far, according to the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza. Relatives of those kidnapped worry that the Israeli operation also puts the lives of the hostages at risk. A spokesman for the military wing of Hamas &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/hamas-armed-wing-more-than-60-hostages-are-missing-due-israeli-airstrikes-2023-11-04/&quot;>;claimed&lt;/a>; last weekend that more than sixty hostages were missing because of the Israeli air strikes, including at least twenty-three who had been trapped under the rubble—claims that were impossible to verify.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;11zfcs&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;The hostages&#39; families “live in an impossible situation—every development that takes place, they worry how it will affect their loved ones,” Nadav Tamir, a volunteer with the Hostages and Missing Families Forum, an organization that represents families of those abducted, told me, two days into Israel&#39;s ground operation. “Statements about a ground incursion have to do with deterrence and negotiation tactics. But the families hear them, and it tears them apart.”&lt;/p>;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;feature-default&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;image&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:feature-default&quot;>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;A child standing in front of a wall full of missing people posters.&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654e9fed154dbc2c80898448/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Margalit-Families-Hostages-B0027109.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654e9fed154dbc2c80898448/master/w_120,c_limit/Margalit-Families-Hostages-B0027109.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654e9fed154dbc2c80898448/master/w_240,c_limit/Margalit-Families-Hostages-B0027109.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654e9fed154dbc2c80898448/master/w_320,c_limit/Margalit-Families-Hostages-B0027109.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654e9fed154dbc2c80898448/master/w_640,c_limit/Margalit-Families-Hostages-B0027109.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654e9fed154dbc2c80898448/master/w_960,c_limit/Margalit-Families-Hostages-B0027109.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654e9fed154dbc2c80898448/master/w_1280,c_limit/Margalit-Families-Hostages-B0027109.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654e9fed154dbc2c80898448/master/w_1600,c_limit/Margalit-Families-Hostages-B0027109.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;Posters of hostages who were taken from Israel and are being held by Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups in Gaza.&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Photograph by Michal Chelbin for The New Yorker&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/inline-embed>;&lt;p >;The scale of Hamas&#39;s civilian abductions—the hostages range in age from a nine-month-old baby to an eighty-five-year-old woman—is unmatched in the annals of Israeli warfare. During the Yom Kippur War of 1973, some three hundred Israelis were held hostage by Egypt and Syria. But those were soldiers, trained for such a scenario, and better prepared for the brutal conditions of life in captivity. If Hamas&#39;s ultimate goal is to coerce Israel into a prisoner swap, it must insure that the hostages stay alive. How do you do that over time when the hostage is a baby? A grandmother?&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;On Monday, President &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tag/joe-biden&quot;>;Joe Biden&lt;/a>; urged &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tag/benjamin-netanyahu&quot;>;Benjamin Netanyahu&lt;/a>;, Israel&#39;s Prime Minister, to approve &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/how-would-a-humanitarian-pause-work-in-gaza&quot;>;humanitarian “pauses”&lt;/a>; in Israel&#39;s military operation and allow aid trucks to enter Gaza. On Thursday, Netanyahu consented, allowing daily four-hour breaks in the fighting. But, in an interview with ABC News, Netanyahu said that, though he may approve “tactical little pauses,” any cessation in fighting would be conditioned on the release of those kidnapped. “There&#39;ll be no ceasefire, general ceasefire, in Gaza without the release of our hostages,” Netanyahu said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/q-and-a/is-this-the-end-of-the-netanyahu-era&quot;>;Netanyahu&lt;/a>;&#39;s public-approval numbers have plummeted since the Hamas attack: seventy-six per cent of Israelis believe that he should resign immediately or at the end of the war, according to a &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://13tv.co.il/item/news/politics/politics/new-poll-903784948/&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://13tv.co.il/item/news/politics/politics/new-poll-903784948/&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://13tv.co.il/item/news/politics/politics/new-poll-903784948/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;new poll&lt;/a>; by Channel 13. Yet his stipulation that a humanitarian ceasefire must be coupled with the release of hostages is a popular sentiment inside Israel—one that demonstrators kept repeating during last Saturday&#39;s vigil in Tel Aviv. (Just how many hostages would be released under such a deal remains vague.) “We emphasize that humanitarian assistance goes &lt;em>;both ways&lt;/em>;,” Ramos Aloni, whose two daughters and their young children are among the hostages, said in a speech, to wide applause and cheers.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Alongside such a proposal, there has also been a growing call among the hostages&#39; families for an “all for all” deal: the release of all hostages in exchange for the release of all Palestinians held in Israeli prisons. There are roughly six thousand Palestinians imprisoned in Israel, including about a hundred and thirty militants directly responsible for carrying out the atrocities of October 7th. But less than a third of Palestinian prisoners are reportedly affiliated with Hamas; the majority are aligned with Fatah—Hamas&#39;s chief political rival. So Hamas may be unwilling to accept such a deal.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Gershon Baskin helped secure the release in 2011 of Gilad Shalit, an Israeli soldier who had been held in Gaza for more than five years. Baskin believes that, despite the complicated nature of the proposal, an “all for all” deal is the only way to guarantee the safe return of the hostages. But such a deal is not likely to materialize soon, Baskin said, given &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/is-this-the-end-of-benjamin-netanyahu&quot;>;the extremist makeup of Netanyahu&#39;s government&lt;/a>; and the Prime Minister&#39;s own poor standing. “Knowing the people sitting around the government table and how weak they are, it&#39;s highly unlikely that this deal will be accepted,” Baskin told me.&lt;/p>;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;feature-default&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;image&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:feature-default&quot;>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;People putting on yellow bracelets.&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654e9feda4270d0a74e36a67/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Margalit-Families-Hostages-B0027080A.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654e9feda4270d0a74e36a67/master/w_120,c_limit/Margalit-Families-Hostages-B0027080A.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654e9feda4270d0a74e36a67/master/w_240,c_limit/Margalit-Families-Hostages-B0027080A.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654e9feda4270d0a74e36a67/master/w_320,c_limit/Margalit-Families-Hostages-B0027080A.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654e9feda4270d0a74e36a67/master/w_640,c_limit/Margalit-Families-Hostages-B0027080A.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654e9feda4270d0a74e36a67/master/w_960,c_limit/Margalit-Families-Hostages-B0027080A.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654e9feda4270d0a74e36a67/master/w_1280,c_limit/Margalit-Families-Hostages-B0027080A.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654e9feda4270d0a74e36a67/master/w_1600,c_limit/Margalit-Families-Hostages-B0027080A.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;A bracelet that is part of a campaign aimed at the safe return of hostages being held in Gaza.&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Photograph by Michal Chelbin for The New Yorker&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/inline-embed>;&lt;p >;Only five hostages have returned home thus far, under circumstances that remain too scattershot to provide a road map. The release of a mother and daughter, both US citizens, was negotiated by Qatar via US mediation. The Qatar channel goes through the Hamas political wing, many of whose leaders are based in Doha. The subsequent release of two elderly Israeli women was the result of Egyptian efforts, through negotiations with the Hamas military wing in Gaza, particularly Yahya Sinwar, who has emerged as Hamas&#39;s most powerful leader. The return of the fifth hostage, a female IDF soldier, was the result of a successful Israeli rescue mission.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Baskin, whose substantial relations with Hamas leaders stretches back to 2006, believes that Qatar can do more to pressure Hamas to release hostages, but that the “only way for the Qatari channel to be effective is if the Americans pick up the big guns,” he said. Baskin argued that the US should tell Qatar to “threaten Hamas that, if they don&#39;t release the hostages, the Hamas leadership will have to leave Doha forever. And, if the Qataris don&#39;t, then the Americans will list Qatar as a state that supports terror.” Such a threat, according to Baskin, will put Qatar&#39;s attempts at gaining international recognition—by hosting &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/12/12/at-qatars-world-cup-where-politics-and-pleasure-collide&quot;>;the soccer World Cup&lt;/a>;, or buying Silicon Valley-based companies—in peril. According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/live/2023/11/10/world/israel-hamas-war-gaza-news#israel-is-considering-a-deal-for-hamas-to-release-all-civilian-hostages-in-gaza-officials-say&quot;>;recent reports&lt;/a>;, Israel and Hamas are considering two proposals that were mediated by Qatar: one for the release of ten to twenty hostages, and another for the release of about a hundred.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;qmk9fb&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Still, the Egyptian channel may hold more sway with Hamas leaders in Gaza, because Egypt, as Baskin put it, “controls the lifeline of the Gaza Strip.” As an example, he cited Egypt&#39;s successful pressure on Hamas to stop supporting Islamic State activities in northern Sinai in 2018.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;So far, Israel&#39;s wartime cabinet, which is made up of Netanyahu, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, and Benny Gantz, a centrist opposition leader, has presented Israel&#39;s ground incursion into Gaza as improving the chances that the hostages will be released. “If there is no military pressure on Hamas, nothing will progress,” Gallant told family members of abductees last week. No doubt, Israel&#39;s military operation is squeezing the Hamas leadership, which has been hiding out in a maze of underground tunnels since the war began. But there is no knowing just how Hamas will respond to such pressure. As Baskin put it, “Will they agree to a deal or will they start doing, God forbid, what the Islamic State did with the prisoners that they were holding, and execute them on camera?”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In the meantime, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/10/30/bidens-israel-policy-gets-put-to-the-test&quot;>;US patience with the Israeli offensive&lt;/a>; appears to be wearing thin. The US Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, has said that “far too many Palestinians have been killed” and warned that there can be no reoccupation of Gaza once the conflict ends. According to Amos Harel, a military analyst for the left-leaning &lt;em>;Haaretz&lt;/em>; newspaper, the window in which the US tolerates military action will likely close sometime between Thanksgiving and Christmas. After that, Israel may find itself diplomatically isolated, with irrevocable damage wrought on Gaza.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Levy, who works as a filmmaker, has watched Israel&#39;s military campaign with a growing pessimism that is rooted in his profession. “Images of destruction are much more dramatic than those of some guys coming home,” he said. “It&#39;s clear that the politicians prefer the image of the strongman, and it&#39;s just not right. To be strong is to take care of your citizens and their security—not to crush or to kill.”&lt;/p>;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;feature-default&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;image&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:feature-default&quot;>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;Three people embracing at the head of a bed.&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654ebbcd6ab20b9012da8351/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Margalit-Families-Hostage-B0026425.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654ebbcd6ab20b9012da8351/master/w_120,c_limit/Margalit-Families-Hostage-B0026425.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654ebbcd6ab20b9012da8351/master/w_240,c_limit/Margalit-Families-Hostage-B0026425.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654ebbcd6ab20b9012da8351/master/w_320,c_limit/Margalit-Families-Hostage-B0026425.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654ebbcd6ab20b9012da8351/master/w_640,c_limit/Margalit-Families-Hostage-B0026425.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654ebbcd6ab20b9012da8351/master/w_960,c_limit/Margalit-Families-Hostage-B0026425.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654ebbcd6ab20b9012da8351/master/w_1280,c_limit/Margalit-Families-Hostage-B0026425.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654ebbcd6ab20b9012da8351/master/w_1600,c_limit/Margalit-Families-Hostage-B0026425.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;From left: Liri, Roni, and Gili Roman, siblings of Yarden Roman-Gat, who is being held hostage in Gaza.&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Photograph by Michal Chelbin for TIME&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/inline-embed>;&lt;p >;Like Or Levy, Yarden Roman-Gat is a hostage being held in Gaza with a toddler waiting back home. On October 7th, militants broke into &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/dispatch/the-devastation-of-beeri&quot;>;Kibbutz Be&#39;eri&lt;/a>;, near the Gaza border, and forced Yarden, her husband, Alon Gat, and their three-year-old daughter, Geffen, into a pickup truck at gunpoint. As they reached the border, three of the four militants got out of the vehicle; Yarden and Alon noticed that their driver was unarmed. Signalling to each other, they opened the passenger doors, jumped out, and started running; Yarden, who is thirty-six, held Geffen in her arms. Gunfire soon erupted all around them, according to Yarden&#39;s older brother Gili. Yarden, running barefoot, felt that she was falling behind and handed the child to her husband, while she ducked into the nearby woods, covering her head with her arms. That was the last Alon saw of his wife. He emerged with Geffen from another clearing in the forest twelve hours later, in total darkness, without food or water. He began an hours-long journey by foot back to Be&#39;eri, all the while searching in vain for Yarden.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Alon returned to his kibbutz to find it ravaged: houses burned to the ground; more than a hundred kibbutz members murdered. Among those killed, he learned, was his mother. His sister was also taken hostage. Now he is left to care for his daughter alone, not knowing the fate of her mother.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Meanwhile, Yarden&#39;s parents&#39; home, in a tree-lined suburb of Tel Aviv, has been converted into what her three siblings call a “war room” for bringing back their sister. When I visited last week, a large paper roll was spread out on the carpet for Geffen, who had drawn little stick figures. Yarden&#39;s brother, her sister, and six of her friends sat around a nearby table in silence, each glued to a laptop and tasked with a different assignment: from reaching out to foreign diplomats to deciding on a strategy for the month ahead.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“It&#39;s what we know how to do: function,” Yarden&#39;s sister Roni, who is twenty-five, said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Reflecting on her older sister, Roni cringed slightly. “She is such a private person. She would have hated seeing her picture” plastered on posters all over the country, Roni said. She went on: “I try to think about her as little as possible. Otherwise, it&#39;s constant: I&#39;m drinking coffee. What about her—when did she last eat? I&#39;m sleeping in a bed. What about her—where is she sleeping? I&#39;m playing with Geffen. What about her? This encounter with reality makes me not want to do anything, like shower or eat, but I know that I have to stay sane for her.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In one respect, at least, Yarden&#39;s family stands apart from some of the other hostages&#39; families: Yarden is a dual national, holding both Israeli and German citizenships (her grandmother is a Holocaust survivor); many others are not. Over all, the group of hostages is highly global, and, while the Israeli government has been slow to provide families with information on their loved ones, foreign governments have sprung into action. Biden, on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/letter-from-bidens-washington/the-week-when-biden-hugged-bibi&quot;>;a recent visit to Israel&lt;/a>;, spent more than an hour with the families of fourteen Americans who are missing in Israel, and said, of the meeting, “We&#39;re not going to stop until we bring them home.” The government of Thailand has been in contact with officials in Qatar and Egypt about the release of twenty-three of its citizens, who had been working as farm laborers in Israel. The leaders of Britain, France, and Germany also held meetings with relatives of their nationals in Israel. Germany&#39;s Chancellor, Olaf Scholz, met with a group that included Yarden&#39;s siblings, who later travelled to Berlin, where they spoke at a rally in front of twenty-five thousand people.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;One of the more controversial proposals being floated in recent weeks calls for the release—independent of a broader deal—of the roughly fifty dual nationals who are being held in Gaza. This proposal, first &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/17/world/middleeast/us-hostages-qatar-israel-hamas.html&quot;>;reported&lt;/a>; in the &lt;em>;Times&lt;/em>;, has led to murmurs in Israel about a kind of “&lt;em>;selektzia&lt;/em>;,” or selection process, whereby the lives of Israelis who hold second citizenships may be more prized than the lives of others. That term is a loaded one in Hebrew parlance, harking back to the sorting of prisoners at Nazi concentration camps.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;eskbz&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Officials tasked with securing the release of the hostages see nationality as a potential flash point. “The foreign-citizenship issue is a very delicate matter,” Tamir, of the Hostages and Missing Families Forum, told me. “Because, on the one hand, you want for everyone to be released and not to have a process of selection. On the other hand, when a family approaches us and says that&#39;s the route they want to take, we&#39;ll do everything in our power to help them.” Gili, Yarden&#39;s brother, was clear that, in all his family&#39;s diplomatic interactions, “We always stress that we are calling for &lt;em>;everyone&lt;/em>; to be released.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Tal Levy sees the issue as yet another in a long list of moral dilemmas that the relatives of the hostages have had to wrestle with. He mentioned another proposal, which calls for the release of children, women, and the elderly. Though that would make intuitive sense to anyone, he said, “It&#39;s very hard for me to articulate it. Because it means that people like my brother may spend years in captivity.” Such contradictions add to what is already a heavy burden. “There are things that I think are morally right, but emotionally I&#39;m just not there.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;On a recent Saturday vigil, a supporter, seeing Levy hold his sign with Or&#39;s picture on it, approached him and told him not to be disheartened: protests for the hostages will only increase, she said. Levy thanked her. Then he replied, wearily, “I don&#39;t need them to increase. I need them to end.” ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot;

to enshrine the right to abortion access in their state constitution; Virginia Democrats took full control of their General Assembly blue; and deep-red Kentucky reëlected Democratic Governor Andy Beshear. Abortion is “an incredibly powerful issue that has the possibility to realign the parties,” the &lt;em>;New Yorker&lt;/em>; staff writer &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/contributors/jane-mayer&quot;>;Jane Mayer&lt;/a>; says, and could make a big difference in 2024. Democrats who have made reproductive rights a part of their platform have secured victories in local and statewide elections since Roe v. Wade was overturned last year. Yet a new poll, out this week, shows President Biden trailing Donald Trump in five of six key battleground states—all of which Biden won in 2020. The &lt;em>;New Yorker&lt;/em>; staff writers &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/contributors/evan-osnos&quot;>;Evan Osnos&lt;/a>; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://newyorker.com/contributors/susan-b-glasser&quot;>;Susan B. Glasser&lt;/a>; join Mayer to weigh in on the role that abortion might play in the politics of 2024 and also the current disconnect between the facts and public mood on the economy, Trump&#39;s civil trial, and the presumed Biden-Trump rematch in 2024.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;o9ooc&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;vn48w&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 12 Nov 2023 02:06:01 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[L.A.

的社区活动，”Rotem 说。 “&lt;em>;afifon&lt;/em>; 是一种风筝，自 70 年代以来的每个 Sukkoth 我们都会去我们的足球场。这是基布兹最高的地方。你可以看到加沙边境。”她接着说：“我们将风筝带上天空，传递和平信息。我们真的以为有一天我们可以像邻居一样并肩生活。我们不必彼此相爱，但我们可以毗邻而居。”&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt; div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;相反：来袭导弹。罗特姆把熟睡中的两个孩子（一个五岁和一个七岁）搬进安全室，关上百叶窗，抓起孩子们的平板电脑和一袋面包卷，然后把自己和它们关在一起。作为基布兹 WhatsApp 群组中充斥着令人震惊的暴行的记录，罗特姆听到恐怖分子闯入了她的家。黑衣男子携带步枪，冲进安全室。她用英语向他们解释说，她独自一人和孩子们在一起。 （她的丈夫在特拉维夫的一家医院里。）她说：“他们看着我和我的孩子。他们用阿拉伯语进行了一些咨询。然后我儿子问他们是否要道歉。然后其中一个人过来告诉我，“我是穆斯林，我们不会伤害你。” ”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;这些人洗劫了房子然后离开了；后来，不同的恐怖分子又回来了。罗特姆和她的孩子们躲在安全室里。三十二小时后，以色列国防军才赶到营救他们。 “除了我和一个家庭之外，我所有的邻居都被谋杀或绑架了，”罗特姆说。 “我孩子们的朋友现在在加沙。四岁的孩子，九岁的孩子，十一岁的孩子，十岁的孩子，母亲，老人。你甚至无法意识到他们发生了什么事。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Eitan Gonen 是伯克希尔哈撒韦公司子公司的机械工程师，他的女儿 Romi 在音乐节上被绑架。她今年二十三岁，是特拉维夫的一名女服务员。 “她是阳光，”他说。他说，节日遭到袭击后，罗米和一位朋友躲在灌木丛里；他和她的母亲（他的前妻）和她的姐姐与罗米通了近四个小时的电话。最后，有人开车来了，但当罗米和她的朋友逃跑时，武装分子拦住了他们。 “我们听到了一切，”戈南说。罗米的朋友和司机被杀。 “我女儿罗米的手被枪杀。她说：“我要死了。” ” 然后沉默。 “我们说，‘罗米？’没有答案。 “罗米？”没有答案。然后我们在电话里听到了阿拉伯语。两天后，我们将其翻译成希伯来语，基本上他们说的是，“好吧，这个人还活着，我们带她走吧。”两周前，以色列国防军证实罗米被关押在加沙。从那以后，戈南就再没有听到任何消息，但他却充满了信心。 “罗米会回来的，”他说。 “我相信。” ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot;

data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;通常来说，足球教练并不是世界上最健谈的人。也有例外（记者：“教练，你觉得你球队的执行力怎么样？”约翰·麦凯据称说：“我赞成。”），尽管大多数人都掌握了空话的艺术。比尔·贝利切克有时只是咕哝一声。但我很乐意听&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/sports/sporting-scene/deion-sanders-the-inveterate-disrupter&quot;>;Deion Sanders&lt;/a>;，最令人兴奋的大学橄榄球教练来了几年，几乎可以谈论任何事情。他通常会这样做。他的团队的成功：“我们在这里闻到了胜利的味道。”他最喜欢的户外活动是：“我钓鱼时会飞，但我不会飞钓。”有人可能会说他值得拥有自己的真人秀节目，亚马逊 Prime 也同意这一点。他已经在流媒体服务上拥有了一个，该服务可以与三位 YouTuber 争夺素材，他们 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/rabbit-holes/a-youtube-view-of-deion-sanders ”融入团队&lt;/a>;，记录了桑德斯的健康问题（他脚上的血栓迫使他截掉了两个脚趾）以及桑德斯和儿子一起修脚的经历。 “我有八个脚趾，”他宣布。 “我能得到折扣吗？”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;指出桑德斯纯粹是凭借个性的力量获得第一份大学工作，这并不是对他（惊人的）足球知识的打击。三年前，当他被杰克逊州立大学（密西西比州一所历史悠久的黑人学校）聘用时，他除了高中之外没有任何教练经验。他用弥赛亚的术语来描述这次招聘。 “上帝叫我付费，”他说。 “我不得不接受这些指控。”他的使命不仅是提升杰克逊州立大学的水平，而且是提升整个黑人大学橄榄球的水平。他谈到与阿拉巴马州这样的球队竞争，这将为神的干预提供有力的证据。历史上，黑人学院和大学的橄榄球项目曾经是全国最好的，但几十年来政治和财政上的忽视导致它们失败了。当桑德斯接手杰克逊州立大学时，学校的训练场在雨后变成了一片泥地，更衣室也需要维修。杰克逊州立大学的橄榄球预算为三百万美元。阿拉巴马州已经快七十九岁了。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;桑德斯承诺更好的筹款、更好的招聘、更好的设施。他的野心并没有局限于足球。他提出了一份 NFL 风格的选秀方案，财富 500 强公司可以选择 HBCU 毕业生就业。 （“如果我能想到这一点，那就意味着上帝让我怀孕了。谁来帮助我生下这个孩子？”）&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;在很大程度上，他分娩了。他的魅力吸引了《早安美国》、福克斯和《60 分钟》等节目。每个人都访问了杰克逊州。桑德斯签下了全国顶尖新兵，这一成就大致相当于说服亚伦法官&lt;/a>;为布鲁克林旋风队效力。他捐出了一半的工资（他一年赚三十万美元，加上门票收入的提成）来改善更衣室。他赢得很快，而且经常获胜，三十三场比赛中只输了六场。然后，去年年底，在他完成合同之前，他就离开去科罗拉多州接受教练工作，该校的学生中黑人比例不到百分之三。五年内他将获得近三千万美元的报酬。他说这也是神圣的，他对他不再听从全能者的指导的建议感到愤怒。 “所以上帝就不再和我交流了？”他在被问及时说道。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;桑德斯在杰克逊州立大学的经历是让-雅克·泰勒的“&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Coach-Prime- Deion-Sanders-Making/dp/0063306913&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Coach-Prime-Deion -Sanders-Making/dp/0063306913”}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Coach-Prime-Deion-Sanders-Making/dp/0063306913&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>; 《Coach Prime》（Mariner），这是关于桑德斯担任教练的第一本、几乎肯定不是最后一本的长篇小说。泰勒是《达拉斯晨报》的前体育专栏作家，几十年来一直关注桑德斯，因为桑德斯是牛仔队的明星角卫。桑德斯是现代历史上最优秀的运动员之一，也是体育记者的梦想。他被洋基队选中打棒球，并被猎鹰队选中打橄榄球。他参加了世界大赛并赢得了两次超级碗冠军。 （他是唯一一个同时参加过这两场比赛的人。）他说的是垃圾话。他跳舞。他具有像阿里一样的能力，将体育理解为表演，并且像他所说的那样打球。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;泰勒的书以桑德斯在更衣室里的赛前鼓舞士气的讲话开始。他说，他的球员有能力编写自己的故事。泰勒解释说，桑德斯的故事始于佛罗里达州迈尔斯堡的一个贫穷、有些孤独的童年。他为一个俱乐部打青少年棒球和足球，该俱乐部的球迷挥舞着南部邦联的战旗。他的母亲不断工作来支付账单。他的父亲有毒瘾。他的继父有酗酒问题。所有人都太忙了，无法观看他的比赛，因此桑德斯学会了赢得观众的喜爱。当他作为一名两项运动运动员进入佛罗里达州时，他相信建立一个品牌会增加他的收入潜力，因此他开始用高中时的绰号“黄金时段必看电视”来称呼自己。他的职业生涯才刚刚开始；他首先创造了自己的神话，然后开始实现它。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;作为一名教练，桑德斯最大的资产是他的营销天才。与许多伟大的运动员却培养出糟糕的教练不同，桑德斯知道如何编排他的故事，不是为了光彩自己的过去，而是为了建设未来。他将自己的工作视为文化时刻的一部分——他说他被&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tag/george-floyd&quot;>;乔治·弗洛伊德&lt;/a>;的谋杀所感动，利用他作为主教练的角色来提升黑人学生。他很快就说服了其他人加入他的行列。新兵——大学教练最重要的资源——和工作人员不遗余力地加入他的行列。一所小型大学的一名学生教练辞去了工作，前往杰克逊，并不断向桑德斯的团队寻求一个职位。他最终在视频部门找到了一份低级别的工作。防守端的教练是免费工作的。球员们的出现并没有保证他们能获得名单上的位置。桑德斯还拥有一种与生俱来的病毒瞬间的感觉。他在杰克逊州立大学场边的舞台上安装了豪华的红色座椅，并邀请了贵宾。当《早安美国》剧组来采访时，他让团队练习宣传片；他们要多次齐声大喊“早上好，美国！”，直到录音达到他的标准。媒体的关注吸引了新兵，媒体的关注带来了更多的关注，进而吸引了更多的新兵。他让一支获胜的球队诞生了。&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;泰勒的书重点关注 2022 赛季，在此期间他融入了球队。泰勒明确表示，桑德斯不是球员的教练，而是一位老派的纪律制定者。有一次，他暂时将自己的儿子希洛踢出了球队，希洛是一名安全卫（桑德斯的另一个孩子谢德尔是明星四分卫），因为他没有提前参加会议。还有一次，他让一位才华横溢但懒惰的边锋忍受了队友的一轮批评。桑德斯可以采用更严厉的指导方法，因为他往往会吸引他遇到的每个人。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;泰勒的书在描述桑德斯迷人的怪癖时最为有力。他从不咒骂。他接电话时总是说：“赞美主！”他在凌晨 3:45 醒来，在一个迷人的场景中，他朗读了整个团队的内容，泰勒称之为“除了《圣经》之外他最喜欢的书之一”。显示为“&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Little-Engine-Could-Original-Classic/dp/0448405202&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot ;:“ExternalLink”、“outgoingURL”：“https://www.amazon.com/Little-Engine-Could-Original-Classic/dp/0448405202”}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon .com/Little-Engine-Could-Original-Classic/dp/0448405202&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;可以的小引擎&lt;/a>;。”他曾经为 HBCU 的竞争对手团队采购过设备，而这支团队比他更缺钱。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;泰勒有时也会被桑德斯迷住。桑德斯几乎从来都不是“桑德斯”，而是严格意义上的“总理教练”，这是他最喜欢的足球绰号。 （桑德斯有一次在记者招待会上走出时，一名记者称他为迪昂。）桑德斯是“一个偶像”，他“一生赚了足够多的钱，金钱不再激励他”。桑德斯甚至有效地传达了自助的陈词滥调，以至于它们“融入了球员的灵魂”。圣徒传的问题在于，它几乎没有给破碎的现实妥协的余地。&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;而且，在杰克逊，桑德斯面临着相当大的系统性问题。研究小组两次发现该市没有饮用水。 （一场罕见的冬季风暴和后来的山洪爆发，摧毁了摇摇欲坠的市政供水系统。）桑德斯将团队转移到一家酒店，为了使用浴室，他们用桶装水从游泳池到厕所。在泰勒开始报道的前一年，杰克逊的人均谋杀率领先全国；桑德斯推动主场比赛在下午 1 点开始，以保​​护球员和球迷。除非杰克逊也蓬勃发展，否则杰克逊州立大学无法繁荣。桑德斯为帮助这座城市做出了真正的努力，但几十年来的种族主义和忽视所带来的问题将需要多个人的努力才能消除。&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria- hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;赛季进行到一半时，桑德斯显然着眼于更大的教练工作。在这一点上，他一向很诚实，但他的动机却含糊其辞。他为什么离开？促使他离开杰克逊州立大学的部分原因可能是与学校校长托马斯·哈德森的关系破裂。他们的联盟破裂的部分原因是哈德森拒绝允许 BET 节目“College Hill：名人版”在校园内拍摄。发起人桑德斯无法理解这一点（制片人、桑德斯的长期女友也无法理解）。而且，当科罗拉多州向他提供新工作时，杰克逊州立大学从未反击。 （政府表示，没有办法与科罗拉多州支付的资金竞争。）&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;

rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;血、汗和泪&lt;/a>;”（北卡罗来纳大学出版社），HBCU 先驱的另一本传记足球教练。这本书的作者是肯塔基州历史学教授德里克·E·怀特 (Derrick E. White)。在书中，怀特追溯了杰克·盖瑟 (Jake Gaither) 的职业生涯，他在佛罗里达 A. &amp;amp; 学校工作。 M.，成为黑人大学橄榄球黄金时代最成功的教练。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;桑德斯只有一个，但盖瑟有一些黄金时段的倾向。他是一位老派教练，有一个令人难忘的绰号（暴风雨海燕），差点成为一名部长。他是一位出色的激励者和熟练的技术人员。他说，他的团队是“&lt;em>;a&lt;/em>;-gile、&lt;em>;mo&lt;/em>;-bile、&lt;em>;hos&lt;/em>;-tile”，这是一个足以被抄袭的三重奏。丹泽尔·华盛顿在《记住泰坦》中的角色。在诊所里，阿拉巴马州著名教练贝尔·布莱恩特曾对盖瑟的进攻策略表示怀疑。盖瑟回应道：“我会带着我的球员用它击败你的球员，然后带着你的球员用它击败我的球员。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;这不是幻想。盖瑟以惊人的速度获胜。从 1950 年到 1962 年，他赢了 110 场比赛，输了 12 场比赛，获得了 18 个 NFL 选秀权，并获得了 8 个全国冠军。盖瑟挑选了佛罗里达州最好的黑人球员。如果桑德斯早二十年上学，他很可能会为盖瑟效力。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;任何热爱足球的人都至少思考过我们为什么要踢足球。你经常听到同样的答案，尤其是来自教练的答案。足球让男孩们成为男子气概（泰勒的书的副标题是“迪昂·桑德斯和男人的成长”）。它塑造品格。它教导美国价值观。你很少会认为有必要证明对篮球等事物的热爱是合理的。但是，考虑到我们对足球的了解，享受足球的明显原因——因为撞人很有趣，因为秋天有更糟糕的方式来度过周末下午——可能看起来很粗鲁&lt;a href=&quot;https: //www.newyorker.com/culture/annals-of-inquiry/exactly-how-dangerous-is-football&quot;>;对其球员的身体和大脑&lt;/a>;来说，他们往往是不成比例的黑人。当盖瑟还是个孩子的时候，每年有 16 个人死于橄榄球比赛。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;盖瑟和桑德斯都相信这项运动有更高的目标。盖瑟谈到了他所谓的“卓越精神”，他认为运动上的成功将培养黑人社区领袖。他说，他衡量一个球员的标准不是胜利，而是“他十年或十五年后所做的事情”。桑德斯可能会同意。他的教练仪式之一是每天让不同的球员带领球队祈祷，因为有一天他们作为男人有责任为家人做同样的事情。桑德斯称自己为球员的父亲。当然，真正的父亲不能完全将自己的孩子从家庭名单中剔除，但这句话几乎得到了美国每一位大学橄榄球教练的认同。&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc通常，这些陈词滥调不会受到质疑，但对于盖瑟来说，民权运动带来了实际的利害关系。他是一位制度主义者，他试图在一体化的重要性与他蓬勃发展的计划的需求之间取得平衡。这有时会让他处于妥协的境地。他与当权白人建立了关系。州长是我的朋友。和桑德斯一样，盖瑟用绳子围出了体育场的一个适合政要的区域。对于盖瑟来说，这意味着白人政要。这是一件精明的事——他的体育预算取决于白人的支持。但许多黑人活动人士对他表示蔑视。盖瑟告诫他的球员不要参加民权抗议活动。他后来说，在看到汤米·史密斯和约翰·卡洛斯在奥运会上举起拳头抗议时，他感到“羞愧”。在盖瑟的保守主义中，怀特看到了一个人在反对&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2001/02/12/civil-actions&quot;>;布朗诉教育委员会&lt;/ a>; 在体育界。盖瑟坚信他的黑人机构与白人机构是平等的。他试图通过表现得友善来说服白人权力结构给他机会来证明这一点，允许他参加一支白人球队的比赛。 1969 年，他终于在对阵坦帕大学的比赛中做到了这一点。盖瑟的球队在球门线附近的最后一秒防守中获胜。盖瑟在一场比赛后退役；几年后，阿拉巴马州、佐治亚州、路易斯安那州和密西西比州成为最后一批结束对一体化的坚持的高水平球队，而佛罗里达州运动会则成为最后一批结束对融合的坚持的高水平球队。 M. 的项目逐渐陷入了足球贫困。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;真正的足球一体化从未实现。白人学校最终很乐意接受黑人运动员并从中获利。但它们仍然是白人机构。球队的领导者仍然是白人教练，他们的权力越来越大，报酬也越来越丰厚。直到 1979 年，没有一家以白人为主的一级学校聘请了黑人主教练。那时，已经有三名黑人内阁秘书。有许多优秀的黑人教练——斯坦福大学的大卫·肖、宾夕法尼亚州立大学的詹姆斯·富兰克林，以及像埃迪·罗宾逊这样在 HBCU 任职的教练——但他们的机会仍然很少。有史以来，大学橄榄球最高水平的黑人教练不到四打。现在有一百多名白人教练。当然，体育运动的动态与学术动态相呼应，其中一体化并不意味着白人和黑人机构的结合，而是意味着少数黑人学生在白人占绝大多数的学校入学。而且，尽管存在资源缺口，HBCU 只招收了所有黑人学生的 10%，但却提供了 40% 的黑人工程师、大多数黑人医学院申请者以及全国 80% 的黑人法官。&lt;/p >;&lt;p>;怀特的结论是“运动整合带来的损失和胜利一样多。”这堪称热门体育赛事。在体育史的净化版本中，它的重要性加倍，通常由白人媒体推动，倾向于迷恋融合的辉煌时刻，无论是真实的还是想象的。 （在流行的传说中，据说阿拉巴马州的贝尔·布莱恩特安排了一场对阵南加州大学的比赛，因此其黑人跑卫山姆·坎宁安可能会严重击败阿拉巴马州，以至于其球迷会心软并让科比接受黑人新兵。坎宁安确实做到了，击败阿拉巴马州，但科比的第一位黑人球员已经被录取。）怀特考察了最典型的突破者杰基·罗宾逊。罗宾逊正确地被列为民族英雄。怀特只是指出了一个经常被忽视的事实，即在肤色障碍被打破后，黑人联盟陷入破产。没有人可以否认罗宾逊、萨切尔·佩奇或威利·梅斯的重要性或勇气。所有人都可以整合名单，但教练组或老板套房不行。 （目前美国四大体育联盟中黑人多数股权的拥有者为零。）人们很容易想象一种更全面的整合，其中不仅是罗宾逊，而且整个堪萨斯城君主队或芝加哥美国巨人队都加入了美国职业棒球大联盟。但是，多年来，在白人占多数的体育界建立一个以黑人为傲的机构的想法几乎总是假设的。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;然后桑德斯到达了科罗拉多州。学校仍然是一片空白。根据其最新的多元化报告，到 2021 年，其教职人员中只有 1.7% 是黑人。它的足球队很可怜。 2022年，他们赢了一场比赛。桑德斯公开将许多球员排除在该计划之外，并招募了一波转会潮。他从杰克逊州立大学带来了他的儿子们、明星四分卫和安全卫；明星角卫和接球手；防守协调员、线卫教练、副教练、防守端锋教练、进攻协调员、跑卫教练、近端锋教练和特别助理。随之而来的是摄像师、媒体成员、教练。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;这支球队在妆容、信心和精神上都不像上赛季的科罗拉多队，而更像是上赛季的杰克逊州立大学。在某种程度上，几乎没有其他一级大学项目不仅是黑人主导的，而且是明确的黑人前进的。 ESPN 的体育、种族和文化网站 Andscape 将科罗拉多州称为“美国黑人球队”。自二十世纪八十年代和九十年代约翰·汤普森 (John Thompson) 的乔治城篮球队以来，还没有哪个项目具有同样的文化影响力。桑德斯仍然向白人体育主管和白人总统汇报，但是，正如杰克逊州立大学校长了解到的那样，桑德斯拥有影响力。到目前为止，曾在现场演出的 Lil Wayne、The Rock、Master P、Cam&#39;ron、Offset、DaBaby 和 Wu-Tang Clan 都曾来过该节目。正如桑德斯所说，科罗拉多州“一半的NBA球员”都观看了比赛，整个赛季的主场门票都已售罄。一些以前与学校没有任何关系的黑人球迷飞到全国各地观看比赛。桑德斯拒绝改变自己的表现方式来取悦白人观众。在赛季开始之前，他现场录制了流行的体育广播节目“The Rich Eisen Show”。主持人艾森问他在哪一年赢得了他的第一个超级碗。 “九十佛，”桑德斯说。他停下来了。 “对不起，我现在是主教练了。”他双手放在腿上，坐直了身子，装出一副假白的声音：“九十四。”然后他就笑了起来。&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;x8d5av&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;桑德斯为何能够取得如此成功？泰勒被桑德斯的魅力所吸引，从未以更广阔的视野看待足球界。 One possibility is that, unlike in Gaither&#39;s day, in modern college football, the power resides not with the politicians, or even the school presidents, but with the television networks. TV money funds an unbridgeable gap between big programs and small. Every year, the Big Ten sends seventy million dollars in TV revenue to each of its schools. The Southwestern Athletic Conference, in which Jackson State plays, reportedly pays one million. There is, of course, no bigger spectacle in the sport than Sanders. In his first game, Colorado upset last year&#39;s national runner-up, Texas Christian. Its games have been colossal television events ever since. In Black households, ratings are up by more than seventy per cent. Even Colorado&#39;s game against Stanford, which was decidedly not a marquee matchup, and which kicked off late at night in the East, was ESPN&#39;s most viewed Friday game in five years.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Colorado is still not a great team (it lost the Stanford game by blowing a 29–0 lead; its record now stands at 4–5), but it&#39;s never a boring one. The dramatic high point came last month, in a game against the school&#39;s rival, Colorado State. In the days leading up to the kickoff, the opposing coach criticized Sanders, and, obliquely, his mother. Sanders sold the game, on social media, on ESPN, and anywhere else he could, as a battle of good versus evil. Colorado mounted a dramatic comeback and won in double overtime. The event ended at 2:30 &lt;em >;AM&lt;/em>; Eastern Time, yet it was ESPN&#39;s fifth most watched game ever. Immediately afterward, Sanders was stopped for an interview on the sidelines. He was surprisingly subdued, or maybe just tired.

My mother felt starved of affection and ceaselessly gnawed on her collected losses and disappointments, while my father retreated into his work, which was constant. That changed, to a degree, when I became a teen-ager, on the eve of my bitterest conflicts with my parents. Around that time, a couple of young Belgians, whom I&#39;ll call Henri and Marie-Céleste, came into our lives.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Henri was the son of the newsagent in our home town, and of course my parents knew his father; it was that kind of burg. He was in his twenties, and was pursuing postgraduate work in New York. Marie-Céleste, who came from a prominent Francophone Flemish family, would be continuing her studies by correspondence. Once settled in New York City, Henri&#39;s letter said, they would like to meet my parents, who lived in the New Jersey suburbs, and glean whatever tips they had on living in America.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;My parents could not have been more delighted. Not only were they happy to meet people with whom they could speak French—there wasn&#39;t anyone else around—but they were overjoyed to have a chance to show off their newly purchased house. It was a tiny Cape Cod on a sliver of an acre, but it had a detached garage and a deep if narrow back lot. More important, it was theirs. They had managed to save up and buy a house after less than five years in the United States. We left the apartment I loved, near the center of an older, larger suburb, where a record store, a bookshop, and a vast public library were just blocks away, to settle in a dull postwar bedroom community that was all houses. Our street did not even have sidewalks, which I thought unconscionable, though I never saw anyone out walking but me. Anyway, they had bought this house and appointed it with Ethan Allen furniture, but had no one to display it to. They could now finally play host.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The Belgians arrived on the Erie-Lackawanna, which in those days still ran brown coaches with rattan seats and ceiling fans. All three of us went to greet them at the station. Henri was a tall galoot with a hawk nose, very little chin, and a prominent Adam&#39;s apple. He stared at everything in childlike wonder. Marie-Céleste wore narrow-framed glasses and kept her red hair wrapped and pinned in a beehive. She seemed at all times to be reserving judgment. The ice was quickly broken. Henri loved to laugh, to put on a show; he seemed to be constantly in motion, his mouth always open and yakking. My parents ate it up. Marie-Céleste sat placidly, lips pursed, limiting herself to the occasional dry remark, but she could turn on the smiles when appropriate. They were an oddly matched pair, but they somehow functioned as a unit.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The day was a roaring success. Henri loudly praised my mother&#39;s vol-au-vents, my father&#39;s wine selection, the house, the furniture, our car, and the Japanese maple out front; Marie-Céleste nodded and smiled. Henri made a fuss over my mother&#39;s poodle, traded bewhiskered Walloon jokes with my father, flung himself into a lawn chair and rhapsodized about the purity of the air, laughed and laughed at everything and nothing; Marie-Céleste busied herself with the dishes. They were in, not that the admissions test was very hard. Henri was one of us, born of the same soil—we might be somehow related—a class clown with a sunny disposition who was at the same time a serious scholar, richly accredited. Marie-Céleste was Flemish, of course, which accounted for her seriousness, but she was charming and obviously well brought up.&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;The couple came for Thanksgiving, Christmas, Easter, and soon they were coming every couple of weeks. I don&#39;t recall ever seeing their apartment in the city. They accompanied us on trips to Lake Hopatcong, the Delaware Water Gap, the Poconos. Henri could be counted on for full, theatrical appreciation of whatever natural marvel we were gazing upon, enhancing the experience with running color commentary and some light miming when appropriate. He loved the road, the diners, the Americana, loved to have us stop at scented-candle outlets so he could run in and inhale. I was commuting to high school in the city by that time, but my parents kept me on a short leash at home, and anyway I didn&#39;t have any local friends. So weekends would find me conscripted into these adventures with Henri and Marie-Céleste, both of whom I had begun to loathe.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;My relations with my parents were at their nadir. Their views on the world no longer had any relevance to me. I yearned to be living real life, which for me at the time meant a cold-water flat on the Lower East Side, along with girls and drugs and occult knowledge and revolution. For their part, my parents were baffled at the changes that had come over me since early adolescence. I was no longer thinking along lines they could recognize; they worried that I was under the influence of drugs, which I often was. Henri and Marie-Céleste stepped into the breach. I may have wanted to be free of my suffocating family, but they seemed more than happy to become my parents&#39; children, and my parents were overjoyed to have them. Increasingly, I felt like a spectator peering in on the antics of a family that no longer included me.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;When I was seventeen, in my senior year, my parents planned a trip back to Belgium. I was ecstatic—I&#39;d have the house to myself for two weeks. I&#39;d been expelled from my school in the city and was back in public high school, so finally I knew local people. I could have a party! On the eve of my parents&#39; departure, however, Henri and Marie-Céleste showed up. They were going to live in the house during the two weeks and supervise me. Naturally, I was enraged. I decided to get a job at a notorious nearby plastics factory, unsafe and sometimes violent, which my parents never would have allowed. It paid a bit better than my job as a stock boy at the five-and-dime, but above all it was a demonstration of macho, with left-wing overtones—this was 1971, after all. My parents left on Saturday, I had the job on Monday, and when I came home exhausted, after midnight, I found that Marie-Céleste had kept my dinner warm. It was spaghetti, with ketchup. I was starving, but I could not choke it down.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;The following September, I started college in the city. In my mind I was gone. In actuality, I had to go home for Thanksgiving, Christmas, Easter—and Henri and Marie-Céleste were invariably there, now sharing a new set of experiences and inside jokes with my parents. I no longer wanted to be part of the family, but it still galled me that the couple had usurped my place. Being an only child had kept me under the hot lights of my parents&#39; attention, but it was not without a certain prestige. Now, in the face of these two perfect children, I had lost whatever lustre I once possessed. Now I was merely a long-haired American teen-ager with an authority problem. Even if I did possess certain gifts, it wasn&#39;t certain that I would use them, or use them for good.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;0nrve&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;z60wkc&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Though Henri and Marie-Céleste took the spotlight off me, they did not relieve me of my primary burden. Their rapport was principally with my father, who appreciated both their humor and their intellect—I always thought that my dad, who worked in factories from age fourteen until his retirement, might in different circumstances have become an academic himself. I had few conflicts with my father, the more broad-minded of my parents by some distance. My mother clearly enjoyed the company of Henri and Marie-Céleste, but wasn&#39;t quite as close to them, because they lacked the one quality she considered essential: piety. My mother was a hard-shell peasant Catholic who had never read the Bible but believed fervently in rituals, icons, beads, scapulars, and above all the spiritual benefits of hardship. Although I kept it secret from her, with adolescence I had lost all trace of belief. Fearing for her mental and emotional stability, I continued to keep up the fiction of regular attendance until I was in my late thirties, but she intuited early on that I had chosen the left-hand path. So my war with her continued apace, and she frankly didn&#39;t care about my alleged gifts, or the possibility of worldly success.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;After college I came home less and less, although I was held fast to the schedule of major holidays. At some point, Henri obtained his degree and he and Marie-Céleste went back to Belgium. The holiday table wasn&#39;t the same after that, the laughter in the house largely stilled. My father went back to his solitary regime of war memoirs and televised sports, my mother to her hours of daily prayers and the devout old widow ladies she fed on alternate Sundays. But the spectre of Henri and Marie-Céleste persisted. Ever since Henri had assumed the role of my older brother, a golden boy who could do no wrong, he had been held up to me as an example. He wasn&#39;t just an inveterate joker but a hard worker who, quite unlike me, was assuring his future step by step. The proofs of this multiplied. He had been awarded a professorship at the local university. He was appointed to institutes and commissions, took on administrative duties, appended his name to significant research papers. My postgraduate studies in low-life bohemianism seemed even shoddier by contrast.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;A decade later, in the early nineties, having in the meantime embarked on my own career, I began to plan my third book, a sort of memoir that examined my life against its historical background: my family, my city, Belgium, emigration. I had been awarded a fellowship to conduct research and was eager to spend time in my native land. I lucked out: Henri and Marie-Céleste were leaving their apartment for a huge modern house in the suburbs, and they offered me the last months of their lease. I had to meet with Marie-Céleste several times to work out the details. I was looking forward to it, because I had never talked with her alone, and I had grown to like her dry humor. She seemed to me the more interesting of the pair, largely because she was an introvert. But she was brisk and to the point, did not engage in chitchat. For her, familiarity meant not having to make nice.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;So I took over their spacious apartment, which they&#39;d left minimally furnished, and felt immediately at home. Even more luckily, I became fast friends with their neighbors across the hall, a German woman my age I&#39;ll call Beate and her much older husband, Alphonse, a former priest. In subsequent visits to Belgium for my research, I stayed with Beate and Alphonse, who fed me well, took me on field trips to German museums, and taught me more about Belgium than I could have got from mere books. Alphonse became like a second father to me; in my mind, he holds up a crooked index finger and says, “Great is the littleness of mankind.” Beate was a complex creature, full of wicked humor and perverse decrees and the occasional nutso theory presented as unqualified fact. Although a German-born scholar, she loved to talk trash in gutter French. The two of them knew Henri and Marie-Céleste, of course, but they weren&#39;t especially close. Beate, though, was a major-league gossip who seemed to keep tabs on every occurrence in town. I remember several reports about Henri&#39;s career, and about how Marie-Céleste, so ambitious, maybe pulled the strings while he pranced.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I didn&#39;t see Henri again until a while later, more than a decade after he&#39;d returned from Belgium. He, Marie-Céleste, Beate, Alphonse, my wife, and I all went out to eat at a novelty restaurant: Walloon cuisine. What on earth could that be? asked those of us who had grown up eating it. That unremarkable hybrid of French and German had never been considered a “cuisine.” I couldn&#39;t tell whether the restaurateurs had invented the dishes or were delving into manuscript recipes from the deep past. In any event, my penchant for ordering the most disgusting thing on the menu led me to an inedible monstrosity, a cow&#39;s udder filled with &lt;em>;sirop&lt;/em>;, a reduction of pears and apples with the viscosity of hot tar. The instant I plunged a fork into it, a jet of &lt;em>;sirop&lt;/em>; spurted all over my jacket.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The evening was convivial if not especially intimate, but I noticed that Henri was really putting away the red wine; the table was already on its third bottle when we were done with the starters. He was a different person from the one I&#39;d seen at my parents&#39; house. Once lean, he had grown an enormous paunch, had all sorts of worry lines incised among his features, and bore no trace of the class clown. Instead, his face grew redder and redder as the evening progressed. He began fulminating against his professional rivals, accusing them of ignoble motives and unspeakable practices. As if he had been reading Sun Tzu during a stretch in the cooler, he declared that he was going to root out his enemies—and kill them! By now he was bellowing, as the whole restaurant hushed.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I next saw the couple three or four years later. My wife and I had bought a summer house on a dirt road in the Catskills, sufficiently remote that we had few visitors. But Henri and Marie-Céleste, on a stateside visit, chauffeured my parents up there. It was a sombre occasion. My father&#39;s Parkinson&#39;s had begun edging toward dementia, and he sat silent and hunched. My mother, who earlier in life would have admired the trees and asked about the animals, barely gazed around her, absorbed behind her social mask. Henri did his best to become the Henri of old, and we joined in the somewhat forced merriment for my parents&#39; benefit. Marie-Céleste, who was hoping her breast cancer was in remission, played nurse, attending to my parents&#39; every need. We heard all about Henri&#39;s various enterprises and looked at photos of their colossal house, like a set from an Antonioni movie. (They had no offspring.) But I came away feeling that, for all their sins, Henri and Marie-Céleste were much better children to my parents than I was.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;My book was published in French about a year later, and for a month or two I was everywhere in the Belgian media: newspapers, radio, television, live events in several cities. I heard no word from Henri and Marie-Céleste and didn&#39;t have time to reach out to them. Soon after that, my son, Raphael, was born, the same week that I began commuting upstate to teach at Bard, and three months later I had to have my father committed, his dementia having entered a violent phase. We moved upstate full-time the following summer. I was writing, teaching, and helping to raise an infant, and all the while I was driving to New Jersey to check up on my mother and regulate my father&#39;s affairs. They celebrated their fiftieth wedding anniversary, but my father did not appear to be in his body. His eyes were no longer focussing, and he had stopped speaking and never would again. Both my parents died, within two and a half months of each other, in the aftermath of 9/11, not that they knew about that event. In the rush of things, I heard from Henri and Marie-Céleste in occasional messages, by greeting card or phone call. They promised Raphael a complete set of the Tintin books, but never sent it. They did not attend my parents&#39; funerals—or, actually, they did not respond when I called and wrote to inform them of their deaths.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;When things had calmed down a bit, I decided that maybe they hadn&#39;t received my voicemails or letters. I had no fewer than six phone numbers for them, but none seemed to work; some rang endlessly while others immediately disconnected. I had two or three e-mail addresses, but they either bounced back or fell down a well. I went to the university&#39;s Web site, searching for Henri, but shockingly couldn&#39;t find a listing. All the links led to a professor in a different field who had the same common name. I was flummoxed. My wife suggested that perhaps they were angry at me for having been inattentive to Marie-Céleste&#39;s medical woes, but the mystery ran far deeper than that. It was as if they&#39;d fallen off the map.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;After a while I stopped being preoccupied with Henri and Marie-Céleste, although their disappearance nagged me now and then. Then I had occasion to go to Belgium, and went to visit Beate, Alphonse having died a few years earlier. I was travelling with Raphael, who was on spring break from a semester in Berlin. He&#39;d last met Beate when he was six, but soon they were comparing notes on their shared passion for the First World War. My thoughts strayed to the apartment across the hall, and I mentioned my inability to get in touch with Henri and Marie-Céleste twenty years earlier. Beate&#39;s blue eyes widened. “You mean you never heard? Well.” She rested her palms on the table.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;According to the rumors, Henri had been in the running for the position of rector of the university. He had the backing of many in the upper echelon, but he had a serious rival, an insurgent candidate from a different discipline. Then unsigned letters began to make their way to members of the administration denouncing the rival, saying terrible, actionable things. The administration quickly identified the pattern and involved investigators to find the source of the letters. Saliva residue under one of the stamps was traced to Marie-Céleste. She and Henri hadn&#39;t been heard from since.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;They would likely have relocated within the EU, I remember Beate saying. They would have changed names and appearance. They probably had cash squirrelled away somewhere, but if not they had enough practical business-world skills to find work. I was entranced by the image of Henri and Marie-Céleste as Bonnie and Clyde. A few weeks later, I was in Spain, and found myself searching for their faces among the crowds in Madrid and Barcelona. I naturally saw them wearing dark glasses, a caudillo mustache on Henri and a Dutch bob on Marie-Céleste. I imagined their weeks or months on the run, saw them changing cars behind a barn somewhere, procuring false papers, sanding down their fingertips, giving each other hand signals through plate-glass windows. I imagined Marie-Céleste packing heat.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;3e8va&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;But then I reconsidered the scenario. Would anyone care enough about a poison-pen letter to perform a DNA test? And wouldn&#39;t Marie-Céleste have found a less amateurish way of circulating her provocations? I suspected that the part about the rectorship and the rival was true, and possibly that someone might have sent libellous messages to the electors, but the rest was too good. I didn&#39;t know where Beate had got her information. Was it gossip—or did she just make it up on the spot, filling out my own embryonic conspiracy theory? I suspected that Beate was gleefully regaling me because she might not like Henri and Marie-Céleste very much, and I suspected that I&#39;d jumped on the story because I didn&#39;t like them either. I really wanted those model children to be secret criminals, even if it was too late to show my parents.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Internet searching has become much more sophisticated in the past twenty years. It took me only a few clicks to learn that Henri had linked his middle name to his first with a hyphen. He was now an emeritus, and much beloved. A tribute had been published by his former students. Besides the university, he had taught in multiple programs at home and abroad, and was known for several influential papers. The professional notices stopped more than a decade ago, but there was a recent photo of him being inducted into the wall of fame of some institution. He had shrunk considerably, and his face had begun to look like my mother&#39;s in old age. I could find only a single mention of Marie-Céleste on the Internet. She was listed as principal of a business firm. The firm&#39;s address was that giant modern house in the suburbs, the place where the phones rang and my letters fell through the slot. ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;aw7djq&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 11 Nov 2023 20:06:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“The Curse” Holds a Mirror Up to Marriage]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/11/20/the-curse-tv-review-showtime]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-11T11:00:00.000Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654e58f8b30e763559be3f50/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/231120_r43404.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;article >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attribute-verso-pattern=&quot;article-body&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;ArticlePageChunks&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;The mirrored exteriors of the houses for sale in the new Showtime drama “The Curse” are the first hint of the series&#39; interest in distortion. They reflect nearby trees and the clear New Mexico sky—an illusion that leads some unsuspecting birds to an untimely death. To the human eye, their effect, like that of the show itself, is more than a little disorienting. The homes are the futuristic wares of Whitney Siegel (Emma Stone), an aspiring property developer who views her ultra-sustainable, sci-fi-on-the-outside, cozy-on-the-inside bungalows as works of art. But the buildings are costly to construct and niche in their appeal; it&#39;s a vanity project that can&#39;t be underwritten by Whitney&#39;s parents forever, even if they are millionaire slumlords. She and her husband, Asher (Nathan Fielder), think hosting an HGTV series will solve their problems, simultaneously stoking demand for Whitney&#39;s designs and raising the national profile of the small town of Española. Ever mindful of optics, they foreground their support for the community and their dutiful efforts to offset gentrification—so much so that the program they pitch, “Flip-lanthropy,” is all broccoli, no candy. Their producer, Dougie (Benny Safdie), decides that the best way to salvage it is by mining the conflict between his two “characters.” There&#39;s a lot more to excavate than the couple want to believe.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Under his influence, “Flip-lanthropy” becomes a different sort of mirror—one for the mismatched newlyweds&#39; repressed tensions. Dougie, who has a wicked story sense as well as tragic reasons for eschewing any appearance of marital bliss, observes how often the telegenic Whitney rolls her eyes at her socially stilted husband when she thinks no one&#39;s looking. She&#39;s decidedly camera-ready, but Asher is picked apart by a network focus group. When one of the participants notes that the couple have “zero sexual tension,” giving voice to a disconnect Whitney had tried to ignore, she can&#39;t help but fixate on her partner&#39;s shortcomings. Dougie gets her permission—but not Asher&#39;s—to fashion their onscreen dynamic around her obvious superiority. Stitching together the narrative he wants involves creative use of hot mikes, the discreet nudging of day players, and confessionals filmed on the sly. But even a genre as artificial as reality television can bring out the truth.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“The Curse,” created by Fielder and Safdie, solidifies the former as one of the most innovative TV auteurs of the past decade. The ten-part scripted series doesn&#39;t, and probably can&#39;t, play with form as ingeniously as Fielder&#39;s previous outings, “Nathan for You” and “The Rehearsal,” wherein he starred as a dead-eyed, inept host who offered his “services” to people in distress. On “Nathan for You,” he styled himself as the would-be savior of flailing small businesses around Los Angeles. With “The Rehearsal,” in which he helped his subjects prepare for difficult confessions or try out alternative lives through elaborate trial runs, he took the same role—and the docu-comedy genre—to yet more absurd, occasionally disturbing extremes.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Fielder continues expanding and complicating the possibilities of that persona in “The Curse.” The series&#39; overt acknowledgment of race and class may be something of a mea culpa for him; though he skirted around the fact at the time, many of the struggling businesses that he messed with on “Nathan for You” seemed to be owned by immigrants or people of color. (When the prank show originally aired, the memory of my parents&#39; failed restaurant was still a fresh wound; for much of its run, a comedian with corporate backing making light of people&#39;s imperilled livelihoods felt unwatchable.) On “The Curse,” whatever sympathy one might feel for Asher as the lesser partner in his marriage, his clumsy, conditional allyship and ability to inflict harm are always front of mind. There&#39;s something canny in the yoking together of various institutions that are rife with potential abuses of power: television production, the art world, even marriage.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;For a series with such naked thematic ambitions, “The Curse” proves surprisingly moving, largely due to the depth of feeling that Asher reveals as his relationship disintegrates. By fully embodying a character rather than playing a heightened version of himself, Fielder shows off his acting chops as never before; his vaguely befuddled, still-buffering affect obscures the emotions roiling beneath. Stone and Safdie, too, are perfectly cast, their roles tailored to their individual strengths. She&#39;s irresistible when evincing desperate, petty want; untrustworthiness radiates off him like a dark aura, or stubborn BO&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“The Curse” takes its title from a small act of retribution committed by a young girl named Nala (Hikmah Warsame) in a store parking lot. When Dougie spots Nala selling cans of soda to passersby, he persuades Asher to approach her for a scene. Asher has only a hundred-dollar bill in his wallet, so he allows himself to be filmed handing her the money, then yoinks it back once Dougie gets the shot. The girl wishes him harm and disappears. Strange coincidences begin to mount—and, after Asher buys a teardown that Nala and her family happen to be squatting in, he inadvertently becomes their landlord. He can&#39;t shake the idea that Nala has derailed his life, even as he has the power to evict her at the snap of a finger. Similarly, Whitney, despite her generational wealth and the eventual series order from HGTV, craves the approval of an acquaintance named Cara (Nizhonniya Austin), a Native artist whose buzzy reputation and supposed race-based credibility she envies. Whit&#39;s efforts to buy her friendship—and to leverage their connection for “authenticity” on air—expose the white woman&#39;s transactional approach to social justice. But “The Curse” is better at satirizing the gentrifiers than at humanizing the gentrified. As in the first season of “The White Lotus,” an emphasis on the moral flexibility of the privileged gives short shrift to the characters of color, who are too often forced into moments of pointed silence or unconvincing passivity. (The underdeveloped role of Nala&#39;s father, played by the gifted Barkhad Abdi, is a small but keen disappointment.)&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;That leaves Whitney and Asher&#39;s slowly collapsing marriage as the most consistently compelling story line. Sendups of the millennial obsession with virtue signalling aren&#39;t hard to find in pop culture; much rarer is a multifaceted portrait that illuminates how a perceived ethical imbalance can poison a relationship. When Asher calls Nala and her family “homeless” while relaying the events of the day to Whitney, she immediately instructs him to use the term “unhoused” instead. Asher would be the first to invoke the truism that Whitney inspires him to be a better person. “The Curse” smartly asks: What are the natural resentments that arise when both parties believe that to be the case? Whitney seethes at having to constantly prod her husband to do good; in reality, she&#39;s a willful naïf who has him do the dirty work for her, then looks down on him for sullying his hands. To avoid feeling like a total asshole, Asher lies to her compulsively, recasting quotidian incidents to inflate his righteousness or heroism. He supports her unconditionally, in his blundering way, and blows up at anyone—a would-be buyer, a TV reporter mid-interview—who fails to treat her as dotingly as he does. When she announces that she&#39;s pregnant, he says, “You are happy,” as though he&#39;s willing her to be. She doesn&#39;t contradict him. But he also knows to pose the question: “You still love me, right?” ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;d6dsjj&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;sm1n7h&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 11 Nov 2023 20:06:02 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
