rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;布拉姆·斯托克的小说&lt;/a>;。在锡比乌市档案馆中，居住在以色列的齐伯斯坦很高兴地发现了特佩斯大约五百年前写的三封信，其中两封完好无损。自 2012 年以来，齐伯斯坦一直试图从历史文献中收集蛋白质的痕迹——已故职员和作者的血液、汗水和饮食习惯——然后用质谱仪进行分析，有时会得到令人惊讶的结果。 （我&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/11/26/do- Proteins-hold-the-key-to-the-past&quot;>;写过 Zilberstein&lt;/a>; 和2018 年，他的长期合作者、一位名叫皮尔·乔治奥·里赫蒂 (Pier Giorgio Righetti) 的意大利化学教授。) 齐伯斯坦开始研究 Ţepeş 信件的第二天晚上，发生了一场猛烈的风暴。 “当时下了大雨和强风，”他在一封电子邮件中告诉我。 “闪电闪烁，狗和其他一些动物嚎叫。我们的‘哥特式’项目的启动气氛非常好。”第二天早上是 5 月 26 日，星期四，斯托克的《德古拉》出版一百二十五周年纪念日。齐伯斯坦夫妇参观了锡比乌的教堂。 “没有出现作为魔鬼或吸血鬼力量反应的超自然现象，”齐伯斯坦指出。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;泽佩斯和德古拉五十多年来一直处于一种不舒服的、非自愿的拥抱中。七十年代初，波士顿学院的历史学家雷蒙德·T·麦克纳利和拉杜·弗洛雷斯库在研究特佩斯的血腥生活和统治时，在费城罗森巴赫博物馆和图书馆发现了斯托克关于《德古拉》的研究笔记。随着吸血鬼走向全球，这些笔记已经被搁置了数十年，无人研究。斯托克是伦敦兰心大剧院的经理，也是奥斯卡·王尔德的朋友。他从未访问过特兰西瓦尼亚。但麦克纳利和弗洛雷斯库发现斯托克的小说来源之一是“&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/dp/1726265129&quot;

data-event-click=&quot;{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Dracula-Nonsense-Desert-Island-Library/dp /190532815X&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Dracula-Nonsense-Desert-Island-Library/dp/190532815X&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;德古拉：感应与胡言乱语&lt;/a>;”，这是一本以呼唤回应的形式对小说中各种毫无根据的理论进行的愤怒的全书反驳，其中与 Ţepş 的联系是她的主要目标。 “‘弗拉德’这个名字没有出现在他的工作文件中，也没有出现在小说中，”米勒写道。 “&lt;em>;等一下！&lt;/em>;”她惊呼道，以回应斯托克故意遗漏更多德古拉背景故事的理论。 “&lt;em>;证明这一点！&lt;/em>;”特兰西瓦尼亚和瓦拉几亚位于现代罗马尼亚，特佩斯在二十世纪在那里被恢复为原始民族主义人物：可以肯定的是，他很坚强；但他的立场却是坚定的。甚至是虐待狂——但具有实现国家现代化和抵抗土耳其人的诀窍。他是他自己造成的怪物。罗马尼亚历史学家尼古拉·斯托伊塞斯库 (Nicolae Stoicescu) 1976 年在一本关于 Ţepeş 的专着中写道：“勇敢而可怕的瓦拉几亚亲王弗拉德·特佩斯 (Vlad Ţepeş) 与虚构的德古拉 (Dracula) 没有任何共同之处。”是爱尔兰人，作为“一位不起眼的英国作家”。&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Zilberstein 没有因为这些原因去锡比乌。他没有读过《德古拉》。他没有时间关注斯托克学术或瓦拉几亚继承的细节。他的思维遵循他自己创造的联系。有一天，当我问他是什么吸引他去看旧文献时，齐伯斯坦用一个苏联笑话回答道：“未来总是一样的，但过去总是在变化。”齐伯斯坦发现俄罗斯文学最早的作品之一是《总督德古拉的故事》，很可能是由俄罗斯驻匈牙利大使费奥多尔·库里琴 (Fyodor Kuritsyn) 于 1476 年特佩什去世十年后撰写的。 。第一本俄语小说是关于德古拉的，”齐伯斯坦说。 “好吧，我开始做一些搜索。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Kuritsyn 的故事是一连串关于 Ţepeş 的刺穿、剥皮、焚烧和斩首的故事。 （他把人活活烧死；他用餐时周围都是木桩上的尸体。）但由于蛋白质组学的原因，齐伯斯坦对 Ţepeş 感到兴奋。蛋白质组学是对特定实体（人类肝脏、天鹅、玉米地）组装的所有蛋白质的研究。齐伯斯坦所从事的古蛋白质组学研究了过去的生物分子。 （公元 79 年维苏威火山喷发后保存下来的玻璃化大脑残骸；阿拉斯加西南部有数百年历史的尤皮克雪橇犬粪便中的内容物。）在最好的情况下，古蛋白质组学是一个革命性的领域，它使我们能够感受消失的生命，看到历史的尘埃。对于齐伯斯坦来说，1492 年克里斯托弗·哥伦布 (Christopher Columbus) 航海新大陆之前的最后几年，中欧和东欧是一片诱人的领土。 “我们应该找到原始的中欧微生物区系，没有来自美国的痕迹，”他说。 “比如烟草、玉米和其他东西——例如梅毒。”他还对欧洲&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/04/01/how-the-little-ice-age-changed-history&quot;>;小冰河时代的迹象感到好奇&lt; /a>; 以及瓦拉几亚在前奥斯曼帝国暴力、多样化边缘的地位。 （作为一个男孩，特佩斯在土耳其的一座奥斯曼城堡里作为人质度过了五年。）&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;在锡比乌，齐伯斯坦用镊子将 19 个带有带电离子的塑料薄膜放在特佩斯 500 个塑料薄膜的表面上。 -还有五十年前的信件，以提取其中的蛋白质。他将其中一个直接放在“Dragwulya”一词的上方，该词由 Ţepeş 于 1475 年签名。这些胶片从特兰西瓦尼亚出发，在西西里岛卡塔尼亚大学的质谱仪中进行分析。齐伯斯坦总共收获了大约一百种人类蛋白质，以及来自早期现代生命王国（细菌、真菌、病毒、植物和虫子）的大约两千种蛋白质。在人类蛋白质中，齐伯斯坦特别被一系列肽所吸引，这些肽只出现在 Ţepeş 后来的信件中，这些信件表明了血液、眼泪和视网膜疾病的痕迹。由此他推测，特佩什“可能至少在他生命的最后几年，患有一种称为血泪症的病理状况，也就是说，他可能会流下混有血液的眼泪”，在与文森佐·昆索洛合作的一篇论文中，卡塔尼亚的化学教授。齐伯斯坦还对研究中不含肉类蛋白质感到震惊。他通常与人类饮食相关的所有肽都来自蔬菜和水果，还有来自真菌和果蝇的微量肽，表明英勇而可怕的王子采摘的瘦肉，甚至有些过熟。&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;

rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;师父和玛格丽特&lt;/a>;”——这件事成为了全世界的新闻。 《邮报》报道称，“可怜德古拉的血泪”。 Zilberstein 接受了&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/it-sounds-batty-but-was-dracula-really-a-bleeding-vegetarian-zj6f536md&quot;>;采访&lt;/a>;向伦敦《泰晤士报》报道 Ţepeş 的饮食。 “吸血鬼原型可能是素食主义者，”他说。他想知道这是否与寒冷的气候有关。 《每日星报》是一份喧闹的伦敦小报，以素食主义者与德古拉的角度进行报道。 “疯狂的说法，”&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/weird-news/iconic-blood-drinking-vampire-dracula-30858072&quot;

data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;In 1956, a group of armed Palestinian and Egyptian men ambushed a young Israeli officer in the wheat fields of Nahal Oz, a kibbutz in southern Israel, near the border with the Gaza Strip. They shot him, dragged his body into Gaza, then returned it, mutilated, to the kibbutz. The next day, Moshe Dayan, the Israeli military&#39;s chief of staff, delivered a short but searing eulogy, standing over the officer&#39;s grave. “The quiet of a spring morning blinded him, and he did not see the stalkers of his soul,” Dayan said. Alluding to the Biblical story of Samson, he added, “Have we forgotten that this group of young people dwelling at Nahal Oz is bearing the heavy gates of Gaza on its shoulders?”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;At 6:31 &lt;em >;am&lt;/em>;. last Saturday, the heavy gates of Gaza tore open again. Some fifteen hundred Gazan fighters led by Hamas bulldozed the border fence, stormed into Israel, and perpetrated some of the worst atrocities in the country&#39;s short but bloodied history. In Nahal Oz, a thirteen-year-old boy who had gone on an early-morning run returned home to find his parents and his two sisters slaughtered. Many neighboring families were murdered with similar brutality. Others were abducted and taken into Gaza, the injured displayed like spoils of war. At the nearby kibbutz Kfar Aza, the bodies of residents, including children, were recovered on Tuesday; there were “cribs overturned,” an eyewitness said. A scorched smell still hung in the air. “It&#39;s something I never saw in my life, something more like a pogrom from our grandparents&#39; time,” an Israeli commander told reporters.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Within days, that trauma and outrage had come to coexist with a bombing of Gaza and an enormous civilian effort to provide survivors from the border communities with food and shelter. The Israel Defense Forces summoned roughly three hundred and sixty thousand reservists, and many more have volunteered for service—laying aside, for now, the deep divisions that have roiled the country since January, when Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu&#39;s extremist government introduced controversial steps to curb judicial oversight of its powers.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;As Israel struck Gaza from the air in full force—and cut off all food, water, and electricity to the coastal strip—and as the fate of an estimated hundred and fifty hostages remained unknown, there were growing calls in Israel to “pulverize” Hamas, as one security analyst put it. The rage is understandable; the implications of such statements, less so. The newspaper &lt;em>;Yediot Ahronot&lt;/em>; reported on Wednesday that Israel has been mobilizing for a possible ground invasion, under the command of a former head of its Gaza Division. Sixteen members of Netanyahu&#39;s coalition signed a letter this week calling for “total Israeli control of the Gaza Strip.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In 2005, after years of repeated attacks and violence, Israel withdrew its military from Gaza and uprooted Jewish settlements there. A military reoccupation now would only incur further mass casualties at a time when Israel is still counting its dead. It would also play directly into the hands of Israel&#39;s archenemy—Iran—by taking an unimaginable toll on Palestinian lives. This could force Iran&#39;s proxy in Lebanon, Hezbollah, to enter the conflict, potentially dragging the wider region into war.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Israel faces an impossible dilemma: how to restore a measure of security and deterrence while also insuring the safe return of the hostages. But it risks falling victim to the optics of war by sending troops to reinvade Gaza, thereby creating an illusion of victory. As Israel&#39;s former Prime Minister Naftali Bennett—hardly a dovish figure—put it on Tuesday, “We shouldn&#39;t dance to the tune of Hamas, of Iran. We shouldn&#39;t do the obvious.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;The problem is that, in Netanyahu, Israel has a leader who has repeatedly placed his own political survival above the good of his country. As Hamas launched its devastating assault on Saturday, it reportedly took him less than an hour to scuttle an offer from the opposition to form an emergency unity government. The Prime Minister did not visit the sites of the atrocities. He does not appear to have gone to the hospitals to comfort the grieving families, and he did not take responsibility for his part in the colossal intelligence failure. He did not mention that in the days leading up to the attack three military battalions had been diverted away from the southern communities and into the occupied West Bank, to guard Jewish settlers there.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Instead, Netanyahu sent an emissary to speak to the media—Yossi Shelley, the director-general of the Prime Minister&#39;s office, a man few Israelis had heard of before. Asked to explain the government&#39;s slow response to the attack, Shelley said that the attendees of a music festival in the desert—two hundred and sixty of whom were slain—had “contributed in a significant way to the chaos.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;On Tuesday, President Joe Biden spoke out forcefully against the atrocities. “Infants in their mothers&#39; arms, grandparents in wheelchairs, Holocaust survivors abducted and held hostage—hostages whom Hamas has now threatened to execute in violation of every code of human morality,” he said. The Pentagon ordered a Navy carrier strike group to the eastern Mediterranean, to protect Israel. Nadav Eyal, a columnist for &lt;em>;Yediot&lt;/em>;, praised Biden&#39;s speech for projecting what had been missing from Netanyahu&#39;s response—empathy. The next day, Netanyahu finally agreed to the terms of a unity government with the centrist leader Benny Gantz. Those terms leave Netanyahu&#39;s far-right partners in the government but create a war cabinet that includes only Netanyahu, Gantz, and Israel&#39;s relatively moderate defense minister, Yoav Gallant. By day five, the Israeli military had retaken control of the last of twenty-two sites to have come under attack. Some communities had been entirely vacated, with surviving inhabitants saying that they&#39;re not sure they will ever go back. In Kfar Aza, the scenes of massacre inside homes were belied by the picture of an idyll that somehow still prevailed outdoors: tidy lawns, strollers, picnic tables.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;When Dayan delivered his eulogy in 1956, he warned kibbutz residents on the Gaza border against a false sense of complacency. “Beyond the furrow of the border, a sea of hatred and desire for revenge is swelling, awaiting the day when serenity will dull our path,” he said. It&#39;s hard to imagine serenity ever returning to the area. But the desire for revenge should not overflow. ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;08x95m&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot;

>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Four years ago, the New York City commercial real-estate firm RXR unveiled “an exciting new opportunity in Brooklyn.” The Hall, as RXR named the development, comprised ten buildings and more than six hundred thousand square feet of prime office space, near the Brooklyn Navy Yard. Promotional artist renderings depicted workers dressed in business casual busy in open-plan offices. “THE HALL&#39;S unique workplace campus will activate one of Brooklyn&#39;s most dynamic and authentic communities of makers, creatives, tech-visionaries, artists, architects, foodies and change agents,” RXR wrote.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The pandemic dashed that vision. Makers and change agents worked from home. Commercial real-estate prices in New York City cratered. For three years, the Hall sat mostly empty, and became one of the least promising properties in RXR&#39;s sagging portfolio. Company executives began having conversations with city officials about the possibility of rezoning the Hall as a part-residential, mixed-use building—a messy, expensive, political process.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In the midst of one crisis came another. Last summer, Texas Governor &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/as-told-to/trying-to-find-places-for-asylum-seekers-in-new-york-citys-homeless-shelters&quot;>;Greg Abbott&lt;/a>; began sending busloads of migrants from his state to New York City, in a cruel political stunt. Partly to demonstrate that New York, unlike Texas, was generous and empathetic to new arrivals in America, officials working for Mayor Eric Adams, as well as representatives of local nonprofit and community groups, showed up at the Port Authority Bus Terminal to welcome the migrants. They received information about social services, and the city&#39;s unique right-to-shelter laws, which guarantee that anyone who requests a bed will be provided one. The right to shelter isn&#39;t new—it&#39;s the product of homeless advocates&#39; legal victories in the nineteen-eighties. But never before had so many immigrants been given detailed instructions on how to enter the shelter system. This information was shared with friends and family, in WhatsApp groups, on social media. People arriving in town—and not just those who came on Abbott&#39;s buses—began exercising their right to shelter. They were soon followed by thousands, which turned into tens of thousands.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;When Adams took office, at the beginning of 2022, there were already more than sixty thousand people living in New York City&#39;s shelter system. As more and more migrants arrived, the city government scrambled to find room for them. Entire hotels were rented out, including the defunct Roosevelt Hotel, a thousand-room Jazz Age relic in midtown Manhattan, which became the city&#39;s migrant-intake center. When even the hotel rooms ran out, local officials constructed emergency shelters, like the large tents on Randall&#39;s Island, in the East River, that drew protests from New Yorkers whose kids played soccer on the fields where the tents were pitched.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;While office-space vacancy rates were also at historic highs last year, there were initially few companies willing to convert office buildings to migrant shelters. For one thing, office space requires all kinds of modifications to accommodate even short-term habitation: showers, bathrooms, lighting, kitchens, walls. Nevertheless, in the winter, city officials asked local real-estate companies to come forward if they had any kind of space they could spare. At the end of June, as the city&#39;s shelter population neared a hundred thousand, RXR entered into a licensing agreement with New York City Health and Hospitals, the city&#39;s public-health-care network, to build out the Hall into a longer-term, large-capacity migrant shelter, a process that could take several months. In the meantime, according to RXR, the company was asked to quickly build a shorter-term “respite center” in two of the Hall&#39;s buildings with space for four hundred and fifty male migrants. RXR completed the renovations in two weeks.&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;RXR was paid about thirty thousand dollars a month for building operations of the respite facility, a pittance compared with the kind of revenue the company had been imagining a few years earlier. To staff the respite center, the city government brought in a contractor called MedRite, previously best known for operating a chain of &lt;em >;COVID&lt;/em>;-19 testing facilities around the city. Most of the guards worked for another contractor, Arrow Security. A third company, Mulligan Security, provided fireguards, tasked with mitigating fire hazards and escorting residents out in the case of emergencies. Combined, the three companies had been awarded contracts that allow them to bill the city for nearly half a billion dollars a year.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;In July and August, buses filled with migrants arrived at the Hall nearly every day—even after the respite center surpassed four hundred and fifty residents. By midsummer, nearly eight hundred men lived in the Hall. Each person was checked in at a table on the first floor, given a facility ID and a lanyard, handed a stack of registration documents, offered a snack, and provided with a towel, toothpaste, a toothbrush, a small bar of soap, shampoo, a pillow, and a sheet. “That&#39;s what you had to defend yourself with, every day,” a recent resident of the Hall told me. The men were led up to cavernous rooms—they looked like old factory floors, but with new windows and fresh coats of paint—where cots had been laid out from wall to wall. Young men from all over the world were sleeping inches from one another. Many had never heard of Brooklyn before. “It was like a prison,” the recent resident said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;There was no privacy in the Hall, and there were no places to congregate indoors. The men changed in front of one another. The overhead lights were fluorescent, bright, and controlled by staff. There were a few toilets on each floor, but no showers. The city had installed four shower trailers outside containing twenty-four showerheads in total, but only cold water came out of them. “I&#39;m numb to a lot of this shit, but that is wild disregard for usual shelter operations,” a veteran inspector of city shelters told me. New York City&#39;s right-to-shelter laws stipulate that the ratio of residents to showers in a facility must be no greater than ten to one. In the Hall, it was for a time more than thirty to one. (Emergency shelters of the kind set up to house migrants are governed by looser rules than the city&#39;s traditional homeless shelters.) The waits for toilets were so long that men defecated in the showers. Signs were posted in Spanish, French, simplified Chinese, Russian, and Arabic asking them not to do this.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The migrants were offered three meals a day, but the rations were meagre. Many of the residents I spoke with complained of gastrointestinal problems. “Breakfast is an orange and some kind of poundcake,” another recent resident, a Venezuelan, recalled. “Lunch is a lettuce-and-tomato sandwich. Dinner is more poundcake.” (A spokesperson for City Hall said that residents of the Hall were offered multiple food options at each meal, including poundcake.)&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;There were few electrical outlets available, so, to charge their phones overnight, residents had to leave them plugged in far away from their cots. There were thefts, and rumors got started, stoking interracial conflicts. “The Haitians take the phones,” the Venezuelan told me. They all despised the jittery guards, who spoke mostly English. The Venezuelan showed me a video of guards escorting out a man who&#39;d brought outside food into a dormitory room. (A spokesperson for City Hall said outside food was allowed at the facility.) Many of the residents hoped to receive asylum, or to find a way to stay in the US legally—and all wanted to get out of the Hall—but the facility, as a respite center, did not offer help with immigration cases, or with applying for work permits. Mostly, the men were left to fend for themselves.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;A few days after the respite center opened, a fight broke out inside one of the Hall&#39;s dormitory rooms. As one migrant &lt;a href=&quot;https://gothamist.com/news/for-some-migrants-in-nyc-a-tent-encampment-under-the-bqe-is-now-home&quot;>;told&lt;/a>; Gothamist, “I was at my cot and then everyone started shoving each other, and then the security guards started to shove us, trying to put all the Venezuelans in a corner.” Afterward, the staff kicked out several Venezuelan men who&#39;d been involved in the fight. The Brooklyn-Queens Expressway, a six-lane highway built by Robert Moses, runs along the south side of the Hall&#39;s property, and the evicted men marched down the block, pitched a handful of tents under the overpass, and started sleeping there.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Even in the best circumstances, a work permit can take six months or more for a migrant to obtain. To make some money in the meantime—and to eat anything apart from what the shelter offered—residents of the Hall pursued several off-the-books occupations. Some walked the streets of nearby neighborhoods, such as Williamsburg, Dumbo, and Clinton Hill, where town houses and condos regularly sell for millions of dollars, collecting bottles and cans to redeem. Some hawked high-top sneakers and loose cigarettes to other residents. Others offered their services as barbers. But the most money, and the most risk, was in delivery work.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;To do deliveries, a migrant needed three things, all of which cost money. The first was a phone, which many residents of the Hall had come to America with. The second was a means of fast transportation, such as a bike, or, better yet, a moped. (Some residents borrowed money, or pooled it, to buy mopeds.) The third was a fake account on one of the delivery apps, such as Uber Eats or DoorDash. Such accounts allowed migrants to avoid working under their real names, thus not jeopardizing their asylum cases. I spoke with several migrants who said they had purchased their fake accounts from what sounded like the same man. Some people said he was a &lt;em>;gringo&lt;/em>; who spoke Spanish, and who operated a restaurant near the Hall. Others said he was an immigrant, like them. It was hard to tell. The fake accounts could cost a hundred to two hundred dollars a week, paid in cash up front, and they expired after a week, or two, or four, depending on how much money was put down. (A spokesperson for DoorDash said that sharing or selling accounts is a violation of company policy.)&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;be34oj&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;0vr3l&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;At the Hall, residents told one another they could expect to make seventy-five dollars a day doing deliveries, but that expectation was often frustrated. If a phone was stolen, or a bike broke down, a resident might not make back what he paid out to rent the account, forcing him to start from square one. Occasionally, at the end of a night that an account was expiring, a migrant would take an order from a restaurant and simply not deliver it, keeping it for himself, or splitting it with his friends.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Eventually, the sidewalks outside the shelter were crowded with vehicles that the residents used for delivery work. On Labor Day, a fight broke out between Latin American and African residents at the Hall—reportedly over a bike. As the conflict was subsiding, a former NYPD officer working as a fireguard took out a handgun and waved it wildly at residents and staff. (Video of the incident was later put online.) The police were called, and the ex-cop told them that a resident had swung a construction cone at him. The resident was arrested and charged with assault, menacing, disorderly conduct, harassment, and inciting a riot. “Why are they taking me away if he was the one who was going to shoot me?” the resident later said, according to &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.thecity.nyc/2023/9/6/23862207/migrants-gun-hall-street-shelter-nypd&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.thecity.nyc/2023/9/6/23862207/migrants-gun-hall-street-shelter-nypd&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.thecity.nyc/2023/9/6/23862207/migrants-gun-hall-street-shelter-nypd&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;The City&lt;/a>;, a local-news Web site. (The guard was later fired. Mulligan Security, who employed him, is still under contract with the city government.)&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;That Saturday, a moped was stolen outside the Hall. A group of Venezuelan residents got together to perform an all-night watch over their mopeds. Just before 3 &lt;em >;AM&lt;/em>;, a Lexus SUV pulled up, and a man got out, shouting. The Venezuelan residents shouted back. The man retreated to his SUV, put his foot on the gas, and hit two of the migrants.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;A week and a half later, I went to the Hall. Walking under the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway overpass, I noticed a group of young men and some mopeds huddled together—and a pair of crutches. One man was lying back on a mattress next to a large concrete piling. He was in his late twenties, and slight, with dark hair, dark eyes, and a tattoo of a diamond on his left cheek. A cast was on his left foot, and his purple and mangled toes poked out the top of it. The traffic overhead shook the ground beneath us. “I&#39;m sleeping here now,” he said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The man&#39;s name was Yoandry Jesus Lozano Bracho. After being run over by the driver of the Lexus, he&#39;d been taken to a hospital in Park Slope with a broken foot. (The other migrant who had been hit, Jhonaker Gil, suffered injuries to his arm and back.) Lozano Bracho said he was then transferred to a shelter in Queens, where there were doctors on-site. But everyone he knew in New York City was back in Brooklyn, as were two mopeds he had borrowed money to acquire. He didn&#39;t work as a deliveryman himself—he rented the mopeds out to others. “I took out one loan to pay the other,” he explained. He&#39;d left Queens on his crutches, got on a bus, transferred to the subway, asking people for directions as he went, and made it back to the Hall. But he wasn&#39;t allowed back in. So he went down the block and lay down under the highway overpass. Some friends soon joined him, and they formed a little community outside. In addition to the mattress, which they shared at night, they had an armchair, some milk crates, blankets, and several mopeds. “They bring me things,” Lozano Bracho said, of his peers under the overpass. “That&#39;s how I eat.” Just in a few minutes together, I saw other men bring Lozano Bracho five dollars, ask Lozano Bracho for five dollars, and quietly discuss matters with him out of my earshot. He accepts in-kind trades. One man who owes him money drives him on a moped three times a day to a public park, Lozano Bracho said, where he uses the bathroom.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;After the accident, Lozano Bracho had been forced to sell his first two mopeds, but he&#39;d since acquired a third, the income on which, he said, was just enough to cover his debt payments. To make money, he sold loose cigarettes and joints, which netted about fifty dollars a day. “But each meal in this city is ten or twelve dollars,” he said. Lozano Bracho showed me his foot, and how he unwrapped and rewrapped a bandage that kept a plaster brace in place. When I asked him how long he intended to live under the overpass, he replied, “As long as necessary.” He stared angrily at his foot. “How long will it take me to recover?”他说。 He had a partner and two daughters in Venezuela. Their initials were tattooed on his right hand. “What can I send them now?” he said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;One of Lozano Bracho&#39;s friends stopped to listen as we were talking, a baby-faced guy who declined to tell me his name. He&#39;d just come back from doing deliveries. I asked him about the arrangement with the broker of the fake accounts: Did he feel like the price to rent the account was fair, or did he feel exploited by the broker? He looked at me, pityingly. “Brother, welcome to reality,” he said. “There&#39;s nothing else to say. Whether it&#39;s here, or Venezuela, or Argentina.” Just then, other residents of the encampment suddenly started urging everyone, including Lozano Bracho, to stand up. “It&#39;s time, &lt;em>;muchachos!&lt;/em>;” one yelled. Several brooms appeared. Together, the men swept the concrete. One of the residents told me they did this several times a day. Even under a highway, they tried to keep clean.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Lozano Bracho said he didn&#39;t know the man in the Lexus who had run him over. Initial reports in the press had characterized the incident as having been motivated by racism, or anti-migrant bias. The man accused of running over Lozano Bracho is named Hamzeh Alwawi. He is a Jordanian immigrant who owns a fast-food restaurant called BurgerIM, six blocks from the Hall, in Clinton Hill. BurgerIM was an upstart burger franchise that floundered just before the start of the pandemic; its corporate ownership has since been accused of luring immigrant franchisees into a pyramid scheme. Alwawi now operates independently, but has kept the branding. He didn&#39;t deny hitting migrants with his car, but he denied any bias. “I am Arabic, I am Muslim, and I am Black,” he said. “If you want to do racism, you have to do it on me.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Alwawi said that, for weeks leading up to that night, he&#39;d had problems with deliverymen who were working with fake delivery-app accounts. He knew the accounts were fake because the ID photographs on the restaurant&#39;s app interface didn&#39;t match the faces of the workers coming to pick up the orders. But, with food hot and customers waiting, he and his staff had kept handing over orders anyway. BurgerIM is open until midnight on week nights, and 2 &lt;em >;AM&lt;/em>; on Fridays and Saturdays, making it one of the last places to close in the neighborhood. Increasingly, at the end of the night, delivery workers were stealing orders—picking them up, but not confirming that they&#39;d done so on the app, and then disappearing into the city. When this happened, the food had to be remade, and the customers got upset. Alwawi had called the police, but to little effect. “This area was never like this,” he said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The night he ran over Lozano Bracho, two large orders had come in at around 2 &lt;em >;AM&lt;/em>; Fifteen minutes later, a deliveryman in a white baseball cap came in to pick up the food. The account he was working under said his name was Karla, and the ID photograph was of a woman. The man left the restaurant with the food in his hand, but didn&#39;t confirm the orders. Alwawi was furious. He left an employee to remake the food and he went out to his car, the Lexus SUV, and set off in search of the delivery worker. “I said in my mind, &#39;I don&#39;t want this guy to enjoy this meal,&#39; ” Alwawi said. “I&#39;m going to go snatch the bag from his hand and throw it.” He drove up and down the streets of Clinton Hill, past town houses, prewar apartment buildings, housing projects, and fancy wine shops that had shuttered for the night. After a few turns, Alwawi found himself approaching the Hall—a facility he said he had no idea had been there, mere blocks from him, all summer.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Outside the shelter, Alwawi said he saw the young man in the white hat standing in a crowd. Alwawi said he got out of his car merely to “talk,” and then found himself outnumbered. A group of men began pushing and hitting him, Alwawi said. Then, he said, he got back in his car and drove off. I asked if that&#39;s when he hit the two men with his car. “I don&#39;t know,” Alwawi said. He&#39;d returned to his restaurant, and hid inside with his employee, as a group of men on mopeds assembled outside. He said they began to bang on the exterior of his car with the thick metal chains that they used to lock up their mopeds. Alwawi, who had called the police on his way back to the restaurant, was relieved when the police arrived a few minutes later—and then stunned when he was the one arrested. (When I relayed Alwawi&#39;s version of events to Lozano Bracho, he exploded, saying, “Those are damned lies.”)&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The Brooklyn District Attorney&#39;s office has charged Alwawi with attempted murder, but he was confident that he would eventually be cleared. “Don&#39;t think I&#39;m talking like this because I don&#39;t like them,” he said, of the migrants at the Hall. “But the place where you put them is not correct.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Spokespeople for both the city government and RXR didn&#39;t dispute that the conditions at the Hall had been grim. They reiterated that it was a “respite center,” with the barest accommodations, intended for the shortest stays. Migrants are often unaware of the different categories of emergency shelters, and which they have been assigned to, or why. Many of the young men assigned to the Hall lived there all summer, and didn&#39;t anticipate being relocated.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Since this summer, another city contractor, DocGo, has faced criticism and formal inquiries for the conditions at some of its migrant shelters upstate. Like MedRite, DocGo had secured a large city contract to provide services at migrant shelters, after previously operating &lt;em >;COVID&lt;/em>;-19 testing and vaccine sites. Mayor Adams has pushed back on criticism of these migrant-crisis contractors, arguing that no one else is available to do the work needed to house all the people who have arrived in the city. “We take any reported incidents in or around our sites seriously,” Kayla Mamelak, a spokesperson for Adams, said in a statement. “But it&#39;s important to address the reality without sugarcoating it: New York City has been shouldering a national humanitarian crisis for over a year, almost entirely on its own. In that time, Mayor Adams has repeatedly warned of the serious issues that could arise, and we are now precisely watching that play out.” According to &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.thecity.nyc/2023/9/15/23874377/billion-migrant-contracts-sidestep-oversight-checkered-records&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.thecity.nyc/2023/9/15/23874377/billion-migrant-contracts-sidestep-oversight-checkered-records&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.thecity.nyc/2023/9/15/23874377/billion-migrant-contracts-sidestep-oversight-checkered-records&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;a report&lt;/a>; in The City, MedRite staffs about twenty of the more than two hundred emergency shelters opened by the city government since last year, while Arrow Security provides services in about a dozen. Residents of several other facilities operated by the two companies have complained of poor conditions, and conflict with guards. Mamelak declined to disclose exactly how many facilities the two companies operate in, or to answer many specific questions about the Hall, including its operating costs.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;84rjkl&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Spokespeople for both City Hall and RXR told me that the respite center at the Hall was emptied in early October. Last month, renovations were completed in several other buildings on the property, which will serve as a humanitarian emergency-response and relief center, or &lt;em >;HERRC&lt;/em>;, where additional resources like in-building showers and indoor congregate space will be available. The estimated total capacity of the &lt;em >;HERRC&lt;/em>; at the Hall is thirty-four hundred people—more than four times the number of people who were housed at the respite center—and nineteen hundred cots have already been installed. Mamelak sent me photographs of the showers, and of rooms in the Hall with cots spaced feet apart, instead of inches.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;On the last day of September, I paid another visit to Lozano Bracho. The previous day, a historic amount of rain had fallen in New York City. The overpass was big enough to keep most of the water away from him and his friends, Lozano Bracho said, but people—including police officers—had come by during the day and taken the mattress and other belongings. They&#39;d offered Lozano Bracho a spot in a shelter in the Bronx. “I said, &#39;No, thanks, I&#39;m good here,&#39; ” Lozano Bracho told me. Like other Venezuelans who&#39;d lived in the Hall, Lozano Bracho referred to shelters as &lt;em>;chetes&lt;/em>;. “In the &lt;em>;chete&lt;/em>;, there&#39;s a problem every day,” he said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;For years, homeless New Yorkers and their advocates have warned that not all shelters are created equal. Well-run shelters that offer services on-site can provide people in crisis with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/09/18/a-journey-from-homelessness-to-a-room-of-ones-own&quot;>;some kind of footing&lt;/a>;. But large congregate shelters, with little privacy and few services, breed problems of their own. Many street homeless people in New York City have had prior bad experiences in large shelters. “You can&#39;t put that many guys in a space like that and expect a different outcome,” Shams DaBaron, a formerly homeless man who has become a leading homeless and housing advocate in New York City, said, of the Hall. He added that the conditions I described to him weren&#39;t so different from what the rest of New York City&#39;s homeless population has been enduring for decades—without prompting the sense of emergency that the migrant crisis has generated. “We&#39;ve never had electrical outlets,” he said. “We never eat the same food you eat.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In early October, lawyers representing the Adams administration asked a judge to temporarily suspend the city&#39;s right-to-shelter laws, arguing that, when the rules were written, no one could have anticipated the migrant crisis. Josh Goldfein, a staff attorney at the Legal Aid Society, said that, if the city houses fewer people, it&#39;ll simply have more people sleeping on the streets. “The city should be helping people move on so that they don&#39;t have to stay in a place like that for very long,” he said, of the Hall. (Goldfein told me that Legal Aid went on a tour of the Hall after it opened, and that he had witnessed staff responding to a fight at the facility during his short time inside.) “The federal government should be helping them get work authorization,” he said. “The state should be helping them relocate. The city should be doing real case management so that people can connect with whatever it is that they need to get some real legitimate employment.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Brad Lander, New York City&#39;s comptroller, told me that conditions at emergency shelters across the city vary widely, and that the city should do more to create uniform standards, and establish proper oversight. “None of that exists in either the &lt;em >;HERRC&lt;/em>; system or especially the respite shelter system,” he said. His office is currently auditing DocGo, which has a four-hundred-and-thirty-two-million-dollar contract with the city. Murad Awawdeh, the executive director of the New York Immigration Coalition, said that the city has created “a separate but unequal shelter system” for individuals who have recently arrived in New York. “I am hopeful that the court will uphold the right to shelter, because, if the court doesn&#39;t, what we will end up seeing is LA Skid Rows happening across the city,” he continued. “And, as it is getting colder, the worst thing we can have is folks feeling like their only option is sleeping in the streets.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The day after the rainstorm, the numbers below the overpass had swelled. When I arrived, two men were screaming at each other and had to be restrained by others. Under the highway, there were all kinds of confusion and frustration about the closing of the respite center, and about where the residents were supposed to go now. Many were tempted to just fend for themselves on the street, to avoid having to start over in an unfamiliar corner of the city. “We&#39;re starving,” a Venezuelan man who said his name was Carlos David told me. David said it was his twenty-eighth birthday. He was holding a cup full of a bright-red liquid, and he was slurring his words. He showed me his forearm, which was covered in a tattoo of the Statue of Liberty holding an assault rifle, which he said he got when he was fifteen years old. “I never thought I&#39;d come to New York,” he said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Lozano Bracho and the other Venezuelans who had arrived before the end of July were newly eligible for Temporary Protected Status and legal residency in the US, thanks to a declaration from President Joe Biden&#39;s Administration. Recently, the Administration also announced that Venezuela had agreed to begin coöperating with the US on deportations for the first time in years, as part of a series of hard-line immigration policies that the Web site Axios deemed “Trumpish.” Under the overpass, the young men felt distant from the public push and pull over the migrant crisis shelter space, legal rights, party politics, the future of commercial real estate in New York City, change agents, and creatives. The night he was run over, Lozano Bracho lost his phone, and access to a federal app called CBP One, which provides migrants with information about work-permit eligibility.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“The only thing I knew about Brooklyn was an old basketball jersey I had,” Lozano Bracho told me. It had taken him nine months to get from Maracaibo, the city where he is from, to the Texas border. He&#39;d run out of money and run into trouble on the way. In Texas, he spent weeks in a detention facility before being offered a free bus ride to New York. He had a cousin in Queens who had offered to put him up if he made it to the city—but his cousin had ghosted him when he arrived. So he&#39;d turned to the shelters. He felt that what had happened at the Hall had marked him in an indelible way. He imagined how he&#39;d be received if he went back to the Roosevelt Hotel with the cast on his foot. “They might think I&#39;d done something wrong, and someone hit me, and that&#39;s why I&#39;m like this,” he said. “They won&#39;t know. They&#39;ll see me differently.” Below the overpass, at least he knew the faces he saw every day, and they knew him. ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;f7wug&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 13 Oct 2023 19:06:05 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[A Tofu-Pudding Revival, at Fong On]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023-10-23/tofu-pudding-saves-the-day-at-fong-on]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-13T10:00:00.000Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65257b62bc2aab991e52347a/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/231023_r43191.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;article >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attribute-verso-pattern=&quot;article-body&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;ArticlePageChunks&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;For lovers of bean curd—this is true love we&#39;re talking about—silken tofu is one of the happiest things to eat. Made from soaked soybeans ground with water into soy milk, then allowed to coagulate and pressed into the desired consistency, soft tofu mimics dairy in appearance, texture, and richness while delivering a clean, impartial flavor that evokes freshness itself. Served alone, stewed in a fiery Sichuan mapo tofu or Korean &lt;em>;sundubu-jjigae&lt;/em>;, or as the centerpiece of Japanese &lt;em>;agedashidōfu&lt;/em>; (deep-fried and coddled in dashi and bonito flakes), silken tofu is a vegan underdog hero in the pantheon of proteins. Delightfully, there&#39;s even more pleasure to be found, in an even softer, silkier iteration, a traditional Chinese preparation called &lt;em>;daufu fa&lt;/em>;, or tofu pudding—which can be found extremely fresh at Paul Eng&#39;s shop, Fong On, in Manhattan&#39;s Chinatown.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Fong On has been in Eng&#39;s family since the original opened on Mott Street, in 1933; for decades, it sold tofu up and down the Eastern Seaboard, “because there weren&#39;t many manufacturers,” Eng told me. “Even Philadelphia didn&#39;t have their own tofu.” But Asian communities—Chinese in particular—as they grew, started making their own, and business slowed; by 2017, Eng&#39;s brother closed the shop&#39;s doors.

Eng, who had originally intended to serve the pudding as he had grown up eating it—warm and drizzled with nothing more than brown-sugar syrup, in the custom of his ancestral province of Guangdong—discovered a new style, with toppings, on a trip to Taiwan. And so, alongside bottled soy milk and chewy, sweet rice cakes (in matcha, ginger, coconut), Eng offers sweet and savory tofu puddings with an array of toppings. The Savory Tofu Pudding is topped with tart pickled radish, crunchy fried shallots, scallions, sesame oil, mild chili sauce, and the only non-vegan item in the store, funky dried shrimp. For a sweet treat, try the Can&#39;t Go Wrong! (dense taro balls, lightly herbaceous grass jelly, and sweet red beans) or the addictive Snap, Crackle, and Pop, with crystalline &lt;em>;aiyu&lt;/em>; jelly, fruity rainbow jelly (“kind of like Swedish fish,” Eng explained), and tapioca boba.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Eng sells his soy milk and tofu wholesale, but only to a handful of restaurants, some of which have Michelin stars (Eleven Madison Park, Contra). When asked what distinguishes his tofu, Eng demurred. “It&#39;s not like I do anything special. It&#39;s just that I care about what things taste like, for myself and to other people.” (&lt;em>;Tofu pudding starts at $5.50.&lt;/em>;) ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 13 Oct 2023 19:06:05 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Ballet Abounds at the Dance Reflections Festival]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.newyorker.com/culture/goings-on/ballet-abounds-at-the-dance-reflections-festival]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-13T10:00:00.000Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6525b1ecb4c72cac9903cad3/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/231023_r43190.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;article >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attribute-verso-pattern=&quot;article-body&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;ArticlePageChunks&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/contributors/rachel-syme&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Rachel Syme&lt;/strong>;&lt;/a>;&lt;br/>;Staff writer&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;external-link-embed--inline&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;a aria-label=&quot;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;You&#39;re reading the Goings On newsletter, a guide to what we&#39;re watching, listening to, and doing this week. &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Sign up to receive it in your in-box.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://newyorker.com/newsletter/goings-on&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://newyorker.com/newsletter/goings-on&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;&lt;span >;&lt;em>;You&#39;re reading the Goings On newsletter, a guide to what we&#39;re watching, listening to, and doing this week. &lt;strong>;Sign up to receive it in your in-box.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/em>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/a>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;A few lazy Sundays ago,&lt;/strong>; I was strolling down leafy Fifth Avenue in Brooklyn&#39;s Park Slope when I spotted a line stretching halfway down the block. I was instantly intrigued: Park Slope is not a place where people tend to wait in a queue. What was even more surprising was that the hot spot du jour was not an Instagram-touted pizza pop-up or even a new &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/09/25/how-glossier-made-effortlessness-a-billion-dollar-brand&quot;>;Glossier&lt;/a>; location. It was . 。 。 a bookstore.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In August, the sisters Bea and Leah Koch opened &lt;strong>;the Ripped Bodice,&lt;/strong>; near the corner of Fifth Avenue and President Street. It has been a continually packed &lt;em>;scene&lt;/em>; ever since. The airy bookstore, whose storefront is painted the chalky pink of a rose macaron and whose shelves are devoted almost entirely to the genre of romance novels, is technically a franchise—the Koch sisters opened their first Ripped Bodice in Los Angeles in 2016, after funding the project through a Kickstarter campaign. The day I visited TRB (as devotees call it), the patrons, mostly bookish, tote-bag-hauling women in their twenties and thirties, looked giddy to be inside the ornate space, which features kitschy wall sculptures made of vintage books and decorative birdcages.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;GenericCallout&quot;>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;Customers in line outside at the opening of The Ripped Bodice a romance only bookstore with an enthusiastic fan base in...&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6525c8fc3ecac81f9623837e/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Grunwald_ROMANCE_12.jpeg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6525c8fc3ecac81f9623837e/master/w_120,c_limit/Grunwald_ROMANCE_12.jpeg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6525c8fc3ecac81f9623837e/master/w_240,c_limit/Grunwald_ROMANCE_12.jpeg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6525c8fc3ecac81f9623837e/master/w_320,c_limit/Grunwald_ROMANCE_12.jpeg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6525c8fc3ecac81f9623837e/master/w_640,c_limit/Grunwald_ROMANCE_12.jpeg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6525c8fc3ecac81f9623837e/master/w_960,c_limit/Grunwald_ROMANCE_12.jpeg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6525c8fc3ecac81f9623837e/master/w_1280,c_limit/Grunwald_ROMANCE_12.jpeg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6525c8fc3ecac81f9623837e/master/w_1600,c_limit/Grunwald_ROMANCE_12.jpeg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;Photograph by Adrienne Grunwald / The New York &lt;em>;Times&lt;/em>; / Redux&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;The Koch sisters are certifiable romance experts—Bea, thirty-three, published a cultural history of Regency-era women in 2020, whereas Leah, thirty-one, brings a deep connoisseurship of queer fiction—and they saw a gap in the retail market.

The genre is soaring—perhaps due to pandemic escapism, or to a dramatic increase in diverse love stories, or because the Internet has helped romance devotees form vibrant communities—and the Ripped Bodice is clearly meeting the moment. As I wandered through the shelves, I overheard a group of strangers becoming fast friends next to the historical-fiction books, gabbing about what to read if you are looking for naughtiness on the Scottish Highlands. Here, the “erotica” section is centrally located. It has never felt so fun—or so freeing—to collectively browse for steamy smut.&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;I admit that I am a late-blooming romance reader; the genre never quite gripped me (though as a lover of tawdry Hollywood memoirs and tea-heavy British mysteries, I am no stranger to the joys of a quick read). But, wanting to be a part of the enthusiasm that spilled out of TRB&#39;s pink doorway, I heeded the suggestion of a friendly store clerk and scooped up &lt;strong>;Kate Goldbeck&#39;s “You, Again.”&lt;/strong>; The novel, which came out in September, sets the “When Harry Met Sally” story—enemies become friends become lovers—in modern-day New York.

The tilt is French and experimental, as exemplified by the &lt;strong>;Ballet National de Marseille,&lt;/strong>; directed by the upstart collective (La)Horde. Their “Room with a View,” at NYU Skirball (Oct. 20-21), made with the composer Rone, is a club dance of despair that pushes through to hope. But, first, &lt;strong>;Lyon Opera Ballet&lt;/strong>; kicks off the festival, at New York City Center (Oct. 19-21), with a gem of American postmodernism: Lucinda Childs&#39;s “Dance.” That 1979 work is, like its Philip Glass score, both minimal and maximal, tracing insistent patterns.

In “Merrily,” time reverses, so we see three doomed friends progress from a final, irreparable fracture to their first, innocent pledge on a rooftop, swearing to be dear to one another forever. The world&#39;s most lovable trio—Daniel Radcliffe (funny when furious, funnier in love), Jonathan Groff (seraphic, incandescent), and Lindsay Mendez (her voice flashing like a sabre)—play Charley, Frank, and Mary, but also, somehow, the tenderness we feel for our younger selves.

A director known for his spare style and intentional process (the public was invited to attend rehearsals of those gallery performances), Schlather stages Handel&#39;s beautifully crafted &lt;strong>;“Rodelinda”&lt;/strong>; in a nineteenth-century building, with sets by the same construction company that restored it.

Since 2013, the Atlanta-born artist has written about love as if embarrassed by its monotony and predictability, threading quiet, quirky narratives that have spun off into their own awkward, droll romantic microverse. She performs as if she&#39;s sulking, with lyrics that reflect an insulated overthinker swept up in her own imagination. A folk sound with muted R. &amp;amp; B. flourishes lends Webster&#39;s “sad songs”—a distinction given by her mother, on “Hurts Me Too”—a bittersweet tinge, as she tries to appease the longings of an achy, breaky heart.—&lt;em>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/contributors/sheldon-pearce&quot;>;Sheldon Pearce&lt;/a>; (Brooklyn Steel; Oct. 23-25.)&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>;&lt;hr />;&lt;div role=&quot;heading&quot; aria-level=&quot;6&quot; >;Movies&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;fglw8s&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;With &lt;strong>;“The Pigeon Tunnel,”&lt;/strong>; a feature-length interview of the octogenarian David Cornwell, aka John le Carré (who died in 2020), the philosophical documentarian Errol Morris happily descends with the supreme novelist of espionage into rabbit holes of duplicity and fabulation. The film is centered on two key aspects of Cornwell&#39;s life: his childhood and youth under the reckless influence of his father, Ronald, a gambler and a con man, and his adult activities as an agent in the British Secret Service. In both these spheres, Cornwell was initiated in deceptions and betrayals high and low, and he adorns his suspenseful and colorful stories with acute analyses of the psychology of liars and traitors. Morris&#39;s signature dramatic reënactments, though skillfully rendered, are more superfluous than ever: Cornwell conjures alluring images with the literary power of his voice alone.—&lt;em>;&lt;a href=&quot;http://newyorker.com/contributors/richard-brody&quot;>;Richard Brody&lt;/a>; (Streaming on Apple TV+ starting Oct. 20.)&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>;&lt;hr />;&lt;div role=&quot;heading&quot; aria-level=&quot;6&quot; >;Art&lt;/div>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;Installation view of ED RUSCHA NOW THEN on view at The Museum of Modern Art from September 10 2023 through January 13 2024.&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65259e84be673549da55fecc/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/D2A0539_PRESS_resized.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65259e84be673549da55fecc/master/w_120,c_limit/D2A0539_PRESS_resized.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65259e84be673549da55fecc/master/w_240,c_limit/D2A0539_PRESS_resized.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65259e84be673549da55fecc/master/w_320,c_limit/D2A0539_PRESS_resized.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65259e84be673549da55fecc/master/w_640,c_limit/D2A0539_PRESS_resized.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65259e84be673549da55fecc/master/w_960,c_limit/D2A0539_PRESS_resized.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65259e84be673549da55fecc/master/w_1280,c_limit/D2A0539_PRESS_resized.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65259e84be673549da55fecc/master/w_1600,c_limit/D2A0539_PRESS_resized.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;Photograph by Jonathan Dorado&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;p >;The XXL &lt;em >;MOMA&lt;/em>; retrospective &lt;strong>;“Ed Ruscha / Now Then,”&lt;/strong>; comprising some two hundred works produced between the Eisenhower years and the present, includes countless burning things, as lowbrow as a diner and as la-di-da as the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. The strangest aspect of these fires, other than their quantity, is their calm. Ruscha&#39;s work—preoccupied with mass media and using a tool kit of bright colors, logos recognizable even when fragmented, and language that could mean any number of things but is also a thing itself—is universal yet cozily regional. Language and, indeed, the entire national order seem perpetually on the verge of collapse, yet never actually collapse.

Velvety and savory, a stylish gentleman&#39;s pink, this emulsion of pork and spices is unmatched as a complement to the similarly voluptuous flavors of egg and cheese. At this Taiwanese American spot in East Williamsburg, silk-thin slices of mortadella join a crêpe-like scrambled egg, melty raclette, and pickly hot peperoncini. It&#39;s all wrapped in an enormous flaky scallion pancake, a perfect contrapunto to the unctuousness of its contents.&lt;/p>;&lt;hr />;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;PS Good stuff on the Internet:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;ul >;&lt;li>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/2023/10/08/1204559751/kelvin-kiptum-marathan-world-record-chicago&quot;>;A new world record in the marathon&lt;/a>;&lt;/li>;&lt;li>;&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://weighoff.miramarevents.com/&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://weighoff.miramarevents.com/&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://weighoff.miramarevents.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;The annual pumpkin weigh-off in Half Moon Bay, California&lt;/a>;&lt;/li>;&lt;li>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1023002-pickle-soup-ogorkowa-zupa&quot;>;How to make pickle soup&lt;/a>;&lt;/li>;&lt;/ul>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 13 Oct 2023 19:06:05 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[The Forgotten Poet at the Center of San Francisco’s Longest Obscenity Trial]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.newyorker.com/books/second-read/the-forgotten-poet-at-the-center-of-san-franciscos-longest-obscenity-trial]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-13T10:00:00.000Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6528553b5ebc1b662f97d7b9/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Lanzendorfer_lovebook3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;article >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attribute-verso-pattern=&quot;article-body&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;ArticlePageChunks&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;On November 15, 1966, five police officers entered the Psychedelic Shop, in San Francisco, and purchased a thin volume of poetry, “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Love-Book-Lenore-Kandel/dp/B0000EEJPC&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Love-Book-Lenore-Kandel/dp/B0000EEJPC&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Love-Book-Lenore-Kandel/dp/B0000EEJPC&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;The Love Book&lt;/a>;,” for a dollar. This sequence of erotic poems celebrating a woman&#39;s sexual pleasure was by the Beat poet Lenore Kandel. As soon as the money exchanged hands, the deputy arrested the clerk for selling obscene material. The officers then confiscated copies of the book, detained and frisked customers, and put out a warrant for the store owner, who was jailed the next day. Then they headed across town to City Lights Booksellers, which also sold “The Love Book.” A decade earlier, in 1957, the police had impounded &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1968/08/17/paterfamilias-i&quot;>;Allen Ginsberg&lt;/a>;&#39;s “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Other-Poems-Lights-Pocket-Poets/dp/0872860175&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Other-Poems-Lights-Pocket-Poets/dp/0872860175&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Other-Poems-Lights-Pocket-Poets/dp/0872860175&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;Howl&lt;/a>;” at City Lights and arrested the bookseller for peddling pornography. Now history repeated itself as the cops seized Kandel&#39;s poetry and took the clerk into custody. What followed was San Francisco&#39;s last, and longest, obscenity trial over a literary work, and the only one featuring a female writer.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Even as these arrests were happening, people were puzzled by the decision to target “The Love Book.” Although Kandel used plenty of four-letter words—a cycle of poems was titled “To Fuck with Love”—there was more salacious material around San Francisco. But Kandel was the victim of bad timing. Much like today&#39;s challenged books—such as “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Gender-Queer-Memoir-Maia-Kobabe/dp/1549304003&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Gender-Queer-Memoir-Maia-Kobabe/dp/1549304003&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Gender-Queer-Memoir-Maia-Kobabe/dp/1549304003&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;Gender Queer&lt;/a>;,” by Maia Kobabe, or “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Lawn-Boy-Jonathan-Evison/dp/1616202629&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Lawn-Boy-Jonathan-Evison/dp/1616202629&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Lawn-Boy-Jonathan-Evison/dp/1616202629&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;Lawn Boy&lt;/a>;,” by Jonathan Evison—her work contains elements that some conservative factions felt threatened mainstream morality. The week before “The Love Book” was impounded, Ronald Reagan was elected California governor. He campaigned on a platform to crack down on the burgeoning counterculture, vowing that he would “clean up the mess at Berkeley,” meaning student protests at the university, and warning of “sexual orgies so vile, I cannot describe them to you.” Kandel was a part of both the Beat-poetry scene and the hippie movement that would soon peak in 1967&#39;s Summer of Love. Her poems express unabashed enjoyment of sex at a time when women weren&#39;t supposed to acknowledge such feelings in public. In “The Love Book,” Kandel writes with openness and psychedelic-tinged joy, revelling in orgasmic pleasure. “All of me / can help but shriek / YES YES YES this is what I wanted this / beautiful.” Lines about arousal, such as “my body / transforms into one enormous mouth / between my legs,” suggest the shameless experiences of a sexually liberated woman. On top of that, her belief in sex as a spiritual act and a form of worship further menaced traditional values.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;GenericCallout&quot;>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;external-link-embed--inline&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;a aria-label=&quot;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;The Best Books We Read This Week&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.newyorker.com/best-books-2023&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/best-books-2023&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;&lt;span >;&lt;strong>;The Best Books We Read This Week&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/a>;&lt;p >;&lt;em>;Read our reviews of notable new fiction and nonfiction, updated every Wednesday.&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;a aria-label=&quot;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;The Best Books We Read This Week&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.newyorker.com/best-books-2023&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/best-books-2023&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/63c800e4e99d89b838ada996/1:1/w_200%2Cc_limit/undefined&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/63c800e4e99d89b838ada996/1:1/w_120,c_limit/undefined 120w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/a>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Kandel was born in New York in 1932. Her family moved to Los Angeles when her father, Aben Kandel, got a film deal for his novel “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/City-Conquest-Lost-Urban-Classics/dp/141285606X&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/City-Conquest-Lost-Urban-Classics/dp/141285606X&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/City-Conquest-Lost-Urban-Classics/dp/141285606X&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;City for Conquest&lt;/a>;.” He went on to write B movies like “I Was a Teenage Werewolf” (1957) and “Trog” (1970), Joan Crawford&#39;s final film. Kandel was often alone as a child, writing poems and reading books on Buddhism and Eastern philosophy. As a teen-ager, she called herself a juvenile delinquent, joining a gang in Hollywood and getting arrested for shoplifting. She ran out of money while attending the New School for Social Research, in New York, and had to drop out of college. In 1960, she returned to California, visited San Francisco, and resolved to stay. She moved into East-West House, a co-op for Beats interested in Eastern studies, where she met &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2008/10/20/zen-master&quot;>;Gary Snyder&lt;/a>; and became romantically involved with the poet Lew Welch. After a trip to California&#39;s central coast, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tag/jack-kerouac&quot;>;Jack Kerouac&lt;/a>; fictionalized her in “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Big-Sur-Jack-Kerouac/dp/0140168125&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Big-Sur-Jack-Kerouac/dp/0140168125&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Big-Sur-Jack-Kerouac/dp/0140168125&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;Big Sur&lt;/a>;” as Romana Swartz, a “Rumanian monster beauty” who is “intelligent, well read, writes poetry, is a Zen student, knows everything,” and runs around wearing only purple panties. Kandel cut a dramatic figure among the Beats. Tall, with a joyful, rubbery face, she favored vivid colors and wore her brown hair in two long braids. She had excellent posture and a grounded bearing that suggested physical confidence. To pay the bills, she worked as an artist&#39;s model, folksinger, and belly dancer.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Kandel carved out a place for her writing in the masculine Beat-poetry scene. When she arrived in San Francisco, she wasted no time in dropping poems on Lawrence Ferlinghetti&#39;s desk at City Lights, the small press and bookstore that published “Howl.” Kandel&#39;s poem “First They Slaughtered the Angels” was printed in the anthology “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Beatitude-Anthology-Allen-Ginsberg/dp/B000P151DA&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Beatitude-Anthology-Allen-Ginsberg/dp/B000P151DA&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Beatitude-Anthology-Allen-Ginsberg/dp/B000P151DA&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;Beatitude&lt;/a>;,” alongside work by Kerouac and Ginsberg. The poem has been called the “feminist Howl” with lines like “who finked on the angels / who stole the holy grail and hocked it for a jug of wine?” Kandel learned that it was published when she heard someone reading it on the street. By the time “The Love Book” came out, in November, 1966, her work had been in more than thirty magazines and at least one chapbook.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;After joining the Diggers, a group of activists and street performers, Kandel met Bill (Sweet William) Fritsch, a Brooklyn-born poet, dockworker, and member of the biker gang the Hells Angels, whom she later married. When he met Kandel, Fritsch immediately left his wife and child to be with her. Peter Coyote, an actor and a fellow-Digger, describes them in his autobiography, “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Sleeping-Where-I-Fall-Chronicle/dp/1582434964&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Sleeping-Where-I-Fall-Chronicle/dp/1582434964&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Sleeping-Where-I-Fall-Chronicle/dp/1582434964&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;Sleeping Where I Fall&lt;/a>;,” as “a couple so charismatic they could stop conversation simply by entering a room.” When Fritsch bought his motorcycle, Kandel rode on its back, without a helmet, braids tucked over her shoulders. “The Love Book” was a psalm to their romantic life. On the cover was an image of a Shiva-like figure embracing a naked woman.&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;In “The Love Book,” Kandel moves beyond the influence of the male poets she knew to center a woman&#39;s sexual experience. Her words are steeped in romanticism and hallucinatory images. “We are transmuting,” she writes. “We are as soft and warm and trembling / as a new gold butterfly . 。 。 at night    sometimes   I see our bodies glow.” Hindu cosmology and Tantric traditions intermingle with angels and the Greek goddesses as Kandel&#39;s eroticism merges into spiritual mysticism. Sex for her is an act of psychedelic transcendence that becomes literally rapturous: “sacred the sacred cunt! / sacred the sacred cock! / miracle! miracle! 。 。 。 / sacred the beautiful fuck.” “The Love Book” is Kandel&#39;s romantic manifesto, the product, she said, of a twenty-three-year search for appropriate ways to worship “the divinity of man.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;The obscenity trial began in April, 1967, and ran for five weeks. A jury of ten women and two men was tasked with deciding if the poetry had “redeeming social importance,” a nebulous concept resulting in sometimes absurd testimony. Priests, a rabbi, psychiatrists, a housewife, college professors, and writers—including Ferlinghetti, who defended the poems—opined as to whether “The Love Book” was blasphemous, animalistic, profane, and worthy of being burned. Then the ACLU, representing the booksellers, called Kandel as a witness for the defense. The press described the thirty-five-year-old as a “pretty housewife” and “the most controversial poetess since Sappho.” She took the stand in a burgundy coat and vivid orange stockings. In a “well-modulated” tone, she read “The Love Book” to the court and explained her religious intentions. During cross-examination, the assistant district attorney Frank Shaw grilled Kandel on her use of the word “fuck” within the text. He asked if it was a noun or verb (“Both,” Kandel said), why she used it (“I could not say &#39;to intercourse with love&#39; and be poetically accurate”), and if she was intending to shock with such words, which she denied (“I would never dream of going up in an airplane and writing them across the sky”). “The Love Book,” she clarified, was meant to convey human divinity, a state that applied even to police officers. “They too are beautifully divine,” she said, “as you are, Mr. Shaw, and as I am.” Shaw was so angry that his voice shook. “You are trying to condition us into a new type of morality,” he said.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Eventually, the prosecution prevailed. After ten hours of deliberation, the jury declared “The Love Book” obscene. The booksellers were ordered to pay two hundred and twenty-two dollars in fines. However, the public overwhelmingly supported “The Love Book.” Within hours of the arrests, protesters picketed outside the Psychedelic Shop. Soon afterward, a reading of Kandel&#39;s poems and a talk on censorship were held at San Francisco State College, with about three hundred people in attendance. In January, 1967, two months after police seized Kandel&#39;s poetry, she was the only woman to speak at the Human Be-In, the historic event where Timothy Leary told the flower children to “turn on, tune in, drop out.” A crowd of twenty to thirty thousand people sang “Happy Birthday” to her. By the end of May, 1967, sales of “The Love Book” had skyrocketed from a few dozen to at least twenty thousand. The publisher Jeff Berner vowed to give one per cent of the profits to the police retirement association as a thank-you for the publicity and “to illustrate that censorship is not only evil but self defeating.”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;fatmyf&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;cn397c&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;In 1971, a US district court overturned the obscenity ruling, stating that the original judge had given the jury faulty instructions. By then, censorship was moving out of the courts and into schools and libraries. Here, again, Kandel was at the forefront. In 1969, a graduate instructor at the University of New Mexico distributed her poems to his class for discussion, leading to an uproar. The New Mexico legislature stripped fifty thousand dollars from the university&#39;s budget and launched an investigation to see if other schools were sharing her poetry. In response, Kandel was invited to speak at the college, a controversial event that produced a bomb scare and threats of arrest. Finally, Kandel, wearing turquoise bell-bottoms and a purple blouse, read her work to a packed room of three thousand people. There was a standing ovation.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;She followed “The Love Book” with “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Word-Alchemy-Lenore-Kandel/dp/B0000CPFIF&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Word-Alchemy-Lenore-Kandel/dp/B0000CPFIF&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Word-Alchemy-Lenore-Kandel/dp/B0000CPFIF&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;Word Alchemy&lt;/a>;,” a longer collection published by Grove Press in 1967. It was her last book. In 1970, Kandel was involved in a crash on Fritsch&#39;s motorcycle. Her spine was injured, resulting in a permanent disability. She became a recluse, breaking up with Fritsch around the same time. (Fritsch was later shot in the head during a brawl and paralyzed on the left side of his body.)&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Kandel&#39;s friend the poet &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/postscript/the-undying-voice-of-diane-di-prima&quot;>;Diane di Prima&lt;/a>; once remarked, “I can&#39;t say a lot of really great women writers were ignored in my time, but I can say a lot of potentially great women writers wound up dead [at an early age] or crazy.” Kandel, who died in 2009 at the age of seventy-seven, experienced neither fate, but her early withdrawal from publishing cut off her development as a poet. The choice to write about sex may have made her work easier to dismiss in the long run. Although many female Beats have been acknowledged in recent years, Kandel&#39;s poetry fell out of print.

The poet, she stated, has one job, which is to express the truth as she sees it, especially when her point of view is underrepresented or contradicts the mainstream. More than most, Kandel understood what a culture loses if it silences its writers. “When a society becomes afraid of its poets, it is afraid of itself,” she wrote. “A society afraid of itself stands as another definition of hell.” ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;spxr3a&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 13 Oct 2023 19:06:05 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[The Latest Findings on What to Eat and What Not to Eat]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.newyorker.com/humor/daily-shouts/the-latest-findings-on-what-to-eat-and-what-not-to-eat]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-13T10:00:00.000Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65283dff3416f5af57909861/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/shouts-what%20to%20eat.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;article >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attribute-verso-pattern=&quot;article-body&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;ArticlePageChunks&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Don&#39;t eat carbs.曾经。 Not just the obvious ones like breads and pastas, but the surreptitious ones, too. I&#39;m looking at you, carrots and bananas. If you must eat a carb, let it be a blueberry.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Eat fat. Lots and lots of fat, especially in the form of cured animals, fried eggs, butter, and mayonnaise. Gold star for any coffee drink that out-fats a double Big Mac. Your brain needs fat, but only if you starve it of sugar first.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Don&#39;t eat fat. It&#39;s killing your liver, and God only knows how your arteries are faring.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Sugar is evil. It&#39;s worse than cocaine. We&#39;re all addicted to it because of the sugar lobby that prompted the “low-fat” (read: high-sugar) fad in the eighties. Or maybe it was the nineties? Somewhere around then, anyway. I was too strung out on low-fat Skittles to notice.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Eat sugar (glucose). Your liver needs it in order to cleanse your body of all the shit you&#39;ve been putting into it because of these other crazy diets.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Gluten is an inflammatory jerk that was never meant for human consumption. It is the source of all our problems, including brain fog, arthritis, poorly fitting pants, and your inability to get tickets to a Taylor Swift concert.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Gluten is a delicious and inexpensive carb that offers the body and brain useful energy.

No? Then stop drinking milk.

Do the rain forest a favor and become vegan.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;But don&#39;t eat soy!!! It&#39;s over-processed and mimics estrogen, so you&#39;ll be a hormonal mess.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Determine where your ancestors are from.

They&#39;re full of mold. No one wants them around, except Hershey&#39;s.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Eat organic, unless the food came from more than a hundred miles away. Then eat local. Unless it&#39;s all potatoes and carrots. Then drink water, but only if it&#39;s filtered and dechlorinated and has been left standing overnight.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;You may as well avoid yeast, corn, eggs, all nightshades, and any &lt;em >;FODMAP&lt;/em>; foods.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Coffee seems to be OK, as long as it&#39;s fair-trade and you don&#39;t put any weird shit in it.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Breakfast is the most important meal of the day.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Only eat within an eight-hour window and certainly not right when you wake up or within four hours of bedtime. Your body has just been conditioned to be hungry outside of those hours. You have to show that bitch who&#39;s boss.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;A light snack before bedtime can help you sleep, as it will suppress an adrenaline surge in your brain at three in the morning.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Drink green smoothies.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Vegetables were meant to be chewed.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Drink lemon water.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Lemon water will disintegrate your tooth enamel.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Stop talking about food and your body. It&#39;s the least interesting thing about you! It&#39;s boring and of no interest to anyone.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I think that just about covers it.
