aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt; /div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;通往另一个宇宙的传送门是可以接受的，条件是所涉及的宇宙不大于 4.5 x 5 x 6 英寸。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;超出限制的袋子和容器医疗必需的超大物品的运输允许尺寸限制。这不包括 Balenciaga 垃圾袋。我们尚未确定该包本身是否存在安全风险，但我们已确定它价格过高、丑陋且完全荒谬。选择购买垃圾袋形状的 1800 美元钱包的与会者将被标记为嫌疑人并被拘留。&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;允许使用实际的垃圾袋。&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>; p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;玛丽·波平斯 (Mary Poppins) 风格的魔毯袋也获得医疗（一勺糖）豁免，只要它们不含有违禁物品，如帽架、魔镜、落地灯或大型植物。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;持票人若能背诵 Fiona Apple 的《Paper Bag》全部歌词，即可携带一份纸质杂货袋，无论是否有医疗必要性。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;如果您在场馆内购买纪念品手提袋，然后走到外面呼吸新鲜空气，您将不被允许再次进入。即使您在外面时没有在手提包中放入任何东西，您仍然会被拒绝。如果这看起来有些过分，那是因为事实确实如此。我想我们现在有点沉迷于权力了。制定任意的规则是一件急事。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;当我们这样做时，绝对没有哈利·斯泰尔斯（Harry Styles）的“Love on Tour”中的手提包。去年他放弃了我们，选择了麦迪逊广场花园，但我们仍然受到伤害。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;任何试图携带不符合规定要求的行李规避安检的行为都将被处以五百美元的罚款罚款，没收您的车票，并在您的车上贴上皱眉表情贴纸。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;感谢您花时间查看我们更新的指南。我们期待着您的光临！ ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot;

data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;在衰退的社会中，老龄化领导层的形象可以体现出一种普遍的枯萎和腐烂的感觉。公民的噩梦变成了漫画家的梦想。在莫斯科，十九世纪七十年代末和八十年代初是一个被称为“zastoi”的时代，即停滞时期。列昂尼德·勃列日涅夫 (Leonid Brezhnev) 长期担任共产党总书记，直至 1982 年去世。他患有动脉硬化症，并且对安眠药有惊人的依赖；普通的苏联人在自家厨房的私密空间里嘲笑他无法说出清晰的句子。勃列日涅夫的继任者尤里·安德罗波夫上任后不久就患上了肾衰竭，并持续了十五个月。克里姆林宫人力资源部门提拔了康斯坦丁·切尔年科(Konstantin Chernenko)，他是一位八十几岁、烟瘾不稳定的人。他的肺气肿非常严重，以至于他无法爬上列宁墓的台阶。很快，他就经常在医院工作。 1985 年 2 月，那里的一个大房间被改造，以便电视观众可以观看他在“当地投票站”投票。两周后，切尔年科去世了。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;美国正处于自己的&lt;em>;zastoi&lt;/em>;之中吗？我们是一个摇摇欲坠的老年民主国家吗？民意调查显示，许多美国选民正是担心这一点。警示故事比比皆是：参议院少数党领袖米奇·麦康奈尔，八十一岁，僵硬地站在镜头前，无法说话，显然遭受了跌倒的后遗症；九十岁的参议员黛安·范斯坦 (Dianne Feinstein) 在听证会和采访中显然感到困惑。南希·佩洛西并没有带着合理的胜利感回到旧金山的家乡，而是参加了竞选。再次。即使是那些深深钦佩露丝·巴德·金斯伯格的人也必须承认，她决定拿自己脆弱的健康状况和希拉里·克林顿的竞选做赌注，代价再大不过了。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;乔·拜登——部分原因是美国政治中的巨大分歧部分原因是他未能将其政府的熟练程度与令人鼓舞的麦克风流畅性相匹配，正在苦苦挣扎。拜登将于 11 月年满 81 岁，如果他年轻十岁或十五岁，他很可能有一条清晰的连任之路。但他不是，他也没有。在美联社-&lt;em>;norc&lt;/em>;中心、&lt;em>;华尔街日报&lt;/em>;和 CNN 的民意调查中，超过 70% 的受访者认为拜登太老了，无法在一秒钟内发挥作用学期。根据上周发布的哥伦比亚广播公司新闻/YouGov 民意调查，只有 34% 的登记选民认为拜登将完成第二个任期；仅比他小三岁的唐纳德·特朗普的支持率是百分之五十五。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;拜登竞选连任的逻辑很简单。 2020 年，他从竞争激烈的民主党阵营中脱颖而出，并继续击败了目前面临一系列起诉的特朗普。作为总统，拜登可以宣称取得了重大成就：创造了就业机会；通货膨胀减弱；大流行已得到控制；主要环境和基础设施立法的通过；动员&lt;em>;北约&lt;/em>;保卫乌克兰。他应该有能力再次击败特朗普，并在从收入不平等到气候危机等更多问题上取得进一步进展。此外，精算图表告诉我们，拜登人口中的美国人，在健康状况良好的情况下年满八十岁的人也可能会活到九十岁。&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;尽管如此，许多民主党人梦想着另一种选择。最近，与华盛顿特区机构有联系的《华盛顿邮报》专栏作家戴维·伊格内修斯 (David Ignatius) 加入了呼吁拜登下台的担忧声音行列。其他人则呼吁年轻的候选人加入竞选。然而，现代历史上现任者面临的主要挑战并不令人鼓舞。 1976 年，罗纳德·里根 (Ronald Reagan) 与杰拉尔德·福特 (Gerald Ford) 的竞选削弱了福特在大选中对阵吉米·卡特 (Jimmy Carter) 的实力。四年后，爱德华·肯尼迪对卡特的挑战——无论多么笨手笨脚——只会进一步削弱卡特本已微乎其微的连任机会。事实上，在过去七十年里，现任总统在失去白宫之前总是会遇到强烈的初选挑战。拜登的副总统卡玛拉·哈里斯带来的具体困境是，她的民意调查数字比拜登差，而且她在2020年民主党总统初选中表现不佳。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;然后，还有“与什么相比” ？”因素。特朗普的普遍恶意有时掩盖了他的语无伦次。特朗普最近露面，尽管他称拜登“有认知障碍”，但他暗示我们正在走向“第二次世界大战”。他似乎还暗示，他在 2016 年击败了巴拉克·奥巴马 (Barack Obama)，并且现在在民意调查中领先于他。然而不知何故，特朗普的愤怒对他的支持者来说却是活力。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;上周，特朗普利用犹太新年的机会，在社交媒体上发出了这一获胜信息：“只是快速提醒大家投票摧毁美国的自由派犹太人以色列，因为你相信虚假的叙述！希望您能从错误中吸取教训并继续努力。做出更好的选择，继续前进！”特朗普的支持者没有看到任何认知或道德缺陷的证据；特朗普就是特朗普。当拜登在河内举行的新闻发布会上用他现在沙纸般的声音插入一段晦涩的电影参考资料并笨手笨脚地记下他的笔记时，人们的反应有所不同。&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden =&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;双重标准？毫无疑问。但总统选举作为古代人的竞赛的前景并不令人振奋，它所引发的焦虑也不能被视为年龄歧视而被忽视。尤其是年轻人，如何看待现任者如此顽强地保住自己席位的政治文化？目前参议员的平均年龄约为六十五岁。米特·罗姆尼 (Mitt Romney) 在七十六岁时宣布退休，他宣称现在是新一代领导人掌舵的时候了，这并没有错。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;然而，投票往往是一个问题在高度受限的选择中进行选择。富兰克林·福尔的新书《最后的政治家》中对拜登的描述并不总是讨人喜欢，但它清楚地表明拜登是本届政府中的发号施令者。与&lt;em>;zastoi&lt;/em>;时代的东欧集团老人政治不同，它的政治方式并不僵化。在 2020 年初选中，民主党选民以相当大的优势选择了拜登；令人惊讶的是，从那以后他就没有再年轻过。真正的威胁并不是由一位致力于保护和更新民主共和国的年长政治家构成的；而是由一位年长的政治家构成的。它是由一名煽动叛乱的混乱特工提出的，他承诺让美国回到痛苦的状态。 ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot;

>;&lt;/ div>;&lt;p>;这些天我的很多想法都是由我的组织产生的。我是债务人联盟 Debt Collective 的联合创始人之一。我们的大多数成员都负债累累，而不是像私募股权公司那样负债累累，用债务作为杠杆。我们谈论的是净资产为负的穷人。在个人层面上，我们的成员希望实现一定程度的金融稳定，但仅仅摆脱债务并不能在我们当前的体系中提供安全。你终于可以摆脱财务困境了，但我们知道，人们可能会因医疗危机或失业以及一些意外开支而遭受彻底的打击。即使你达到了一个新的水平，不安全感也会困扰着你。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;我对情感与经济、心理与政治的交叉点真的很感兴趣——我认为这就是我们所有人真正生活的空间in. 不安全感涉及这两个方面。我们谈论不安全感——它让我们思考自己的感受——但我们也可以谈论客观的社会经济现象：住房不安全、工作不安全、生态不安全、粮食不安全。这些是社会学家和学者使用的术语；它们是真实的物质条件。不安全感的想法具有二元性这一事实吸引了我。&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>; &lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;正如您在书中所指出的，“不安全感”是一个引发团结而不是反对或分裂的术语。&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;我总是试图扩大联盟。我们——我指的是大的“我们”——面临着极其强大的根深蒂固的力量，这些力量正在这个世界上造成巨大的伤害。为了有希望动员起来反对那些投资于从破坏我们星球中获利的机构，我们必须建立一场强大的群众运动。所以我们需要每个人。我喜欢不安全感概念的一件事是，它为我们提供了寻找共性的基础。不平等鼓励我们看极端——想想亿万富翁和数十亿拥有很少的人——不安全感鼓励我们斜视，看看我们与人们可能有什么共同点，即使这些人拥有的比其他人多一点。我们，甚至比我们多得多。不平等很重要；从这些角度思考是绝对重要的。但是当你意识到，哇，即使是那些已经成功摆脱债务并筹集了房子首付的人，考虑到经济的结构方式，他们也无法休息——这可能是团结。&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;这可能是生态不安全。这可能是工作不稳定——我的意思是，白领工人几乎没有工作保障。当你投资股票市场时，没有人有退休保障。当您认为非常有价值的财产面临洪水或失去保险的风险时，没有人有住房保障。有人拥有引用-反引用的特权，但他们也被搞砸了。我的意图是说，嘿，看看你自己。因为那时你是在为自己而战，而不仅仅是出于对他人的怜悯。我认为这非常重要。我们必须为自己的生命而战，即使我们相对享有特权，因为我们都生活在一个燃烧的星球上。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;这似乎也消除了所有乏味的争论：当你分心去解析人们各自特权的细节时，就会发生这种情况。&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;百分之一百。我刚刚和一些朋友一起主持了一次债务人大会，一位女士讲述了她的故事，并一遍又一遍地说：“我知道我很荣幸。我知道我很荣幸。”然而，她讲述了一个故事，二十多年来她不得不依赖信用卡——本质上是将债务从一张信用卡转移到另一张信用卡。所以，你知道，与房间里的其他一些人相比，她并没有经历过贫困最严酷的边缘。但是，依赖收取 22% 利息的信用卡是一种特权吗？我不知道。这只是我觉得“这实际上没有帮助”的时刻之一。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;您认为左翼人士有意识地在多大程度上交流想法是值得的？一种可能不会吓跑怀疑者的方法？在您看来，多少内容是有用的，多少内容会分散注意力？&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;我觉得很多都是有用的。我想，如果做得好的话，就不会造成干扰。挑战在于如何传达激进的想法——即触及我们当前危机根源的想法——以邀请其他人接受不同的世界观或一套不同的解决方案的方式？债务集体是一个激进的组织。它是由坚定的民主社会主义者创立的。但它不仅仅是一个为拥有这种世界观的人而设的组织；它也是一个为拥有这种世界观的人而设的组织。这是一个面向债务人及其盟友的组织，我们努力以与人们的日常生活和经历相关的术语与他们交谈。&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot;

data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;我们来谈谈您在债务方面的工作集体。该组织是在&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/occupy-movement-takes-student-debt&quot;>;占领&lt;/a>;之后成立的，当时您是该组织开始开发工具来帮助负债者，并提高人们对他们所面临的掠夺性行为的认识，例如，您筹集资金在二级市场上购买医疗债务并免除其债务。您还致力于制定政策策略，并且在过去几年中，取消学生债务已&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/what-biden-cant-do- on-student-debt-and-what-he-wont-do&quot;>;成为一种日益主流的想法&lt;/a>;，最终在拜登总统的 2022 年竞选中达到顶峰 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily -comment/bidens-student-debt-plan-could-chip-away-at-the-racial-wealth-gap&quot;>;计划&lt;/a>;取消某些借款人高达两万美元的债务。我很想知道从您的角度来看这种演变是什么样的，以及您认为是什么使得它成为可能。&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;许多现在看来是常识性的想法实际上在十年前是不可想象的——而且不仅针对保守派或主流自由派，而且针对左翼人士。政府将取消债务的想法，民主党在某种意义上将成为取消债务的政党的想法，也许在五年前是相当不可想象的。它表明，即使你的想法以当前的标准来看远远超出了预期，但如果你以一种战略性的、深思熟虑的、而且我认为是直言不讳的方式来对待它们，你实际上可以改变常识并改变政策。现在显然我们需要对冲并说我们正在战斗——最高法院对拜登首次取消贷款的尝试给予了相当重大的打击。但是，美国总统，他的大部分职业生涯都在为债权人阶级的利益服务——我的意思是，他是来自特拉华州的参议员，特拉华州是美国的信用卡之都——已经成为总统了在台上为取消学生债务辩护。 Sometimes with pizzazz!&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The Debt Collective organizer in me is frustrated, because there were many mistakes made by the Biden Administration along the way. This should be out the door and in people&#39;s accounts; we shouldn&#39;t have to be having this battle. But, when I take the longer view, and I remember what it was like five years ago, or ten years ago, I&#39;m actually really shocked that we&#39;ve come this far. I think part of why we have is we&#39;re a smart, strategic, nerdy group of organizers who did our research and have figured out a lot of creative strategies. But I think it&#39;s also that we&#39;re speaking to people&#39;s real conditions, and that combination of the economic and the emotional. Debt is not just numbers on a balance sheet for people.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;We host these debtors&#39; assemblies where we invite people to tell their stories. Even people who have a political consciousness about other things, when they finally talk about how financially precarious they are, and how they&#39;re doing everything right, they&#39;ve gone to college, they&#39;ve been good, they&#39;ve been responsible, and they still just cannot get ahead—it is incredibly distressing. Part of why I think our small but mighty movement has taken off is because people are taught not to talk about money, not to talk about their monetary woes, and that, if they&#39;re not able to get ahead, it&#39;s their fault. Part of what we&#39;re doing is just saying, That&#39;s bullshit. Right now, our society is structured so that you have no choice but to take on debt to meet your basic needs.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;Have you noticed a change in how people talk and think about their debt since you started doing this work?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;People feel entitled to debt cancellation! That is a huge, profound shift in consciousness. I&#39;ve been on walks and overheard strangers talking about debt cancellation—sometimes I do a double take, that these ideas are out there.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;Where were you walking?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;I was just walking down a greenway somewhere in North Carolina! And these people were talking about debt cancellation. The Debt Collective is not just a student-debt group—we have campaigns focussed on carceral debt, on housing debt, on medical debt. It is so much easier to start conversations now about the cancellation of those kinds of debts. The fact that we have medical bills because we don&#39;t have universal health care in the United States—it&#39;s so much easier to have that conversation now than it was to start the student-debt conversation a decade ago.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;In June, the Supreme Court struck down the Biden Administration&#39;s original plan to cancel student debt under the &lt;em >;HEROES&lt;/em>; Act. Biden responded with a new plan, using a different legal mechanism—the Higher Education Act—to cancel certain debt. But it&#39;s expected to take a while for borrowers to see any results. What&#39;s next? What are you looking ahead to?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The Debt Collective is incredibly energized at this moment. And I think we have to claim the victory that President Biden announced a debt-relief plan—which he then enacted in a way that was flawed. The Biden Administration should have just automatically cancelled people&#39;s debts. They never needed to have an application process. They did not need to make people individually apply for relief. That was all just vibes—it was just optics, to make it look like they were filtering out this mythic two or three per cent of higher-income debtors. But what they did, by wanting to filter out debtors who make over a hundred and twenty-five thousand dollars a year, is they shot themselves in the foot—because they bought time for Republicans and their billionaire backers to tee up these bogus, bad-faith lawsuits with sympathetic judges.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;cpb3xm&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;It is a testament to organizing that Biden did at least go up there and say, I&#39;m going to use the Higher Education Act and the “compromise and settlement” authority therein to cancel student debt. He could have cancelled student debt in that moment, and instead has once again set up a rather bureaucratic process. The Debt Collective just released something called the &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://tools.debtcollective.org/run/student/#/1&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://tools.debtcollective.org/run/student/#/1&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://tools.debtcollective.org/run/student/#/1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;Student Debt Release Tool&lt;/a>;, which allows people to petition individually for their loans to be cancelled under the exact authority that Biden is now saying he will use. In the first week, fifteen thousand people submitted petitions—and this goes straight to the top brass at the Department of Education.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Right now we&#39;re trying to play the hand that&#39;s been dealt to us and insure that debtors get the relief that they were promised, while also building our campaigns out in these other issue areas. Specifically, we&#39;re working with the LA Tenants Union, in California, to build a movement of debtors and tenants there—we have something called the &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://tenantpowertoolkit.org/&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://tenantpowertoolkit.org/&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://tenantpowertoolkit.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;Tenant Power Toolkit&lt;/a>;. The Debt Collective is responsible for answering one-fifth of all the eviction notices in Los Angeles County, which is a huge area. And we&#39;ve got some medical strategies brewing, too. We&#39;re always trying to look at the political terrain and figure out, What can we do? Which is really important, because it&#39;s easy to get cynical and frustrated.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;This is shifting gears a bit, but I think my first encounter with your work was the &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.nplusonemag.com/issue-13/essays/unschooling/&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.nplusonemag.com/issue-13/essays/unschooling/&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nplusonemag.com/issue-13/essays/unschooling/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;2012 &lt;em>;n+1&lt;/em>; piece&lt;/a>; you wrote about your education. You return to that material in “The Age of Insecurity,” starting with your mother&#39;s time at a Canadian experimental school called Carcross in the nineteen-seventies. Students helped run the place, along with teachers and parents—which meant cooking and cleaning, but also shaping the curriculum. What did your mom take from that experience, and how did that filter down to you?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;My mom was only there for a year, but it made a huge impression on her. When I was growing up, and this was in the eighties, she always gave me and my siblings the option to not go to school and to “unschool”—which is distinct from homeschooling. Homeschooling is trying to do school in the home, and unschooling is this philosophy of tapping into a child&#39;s innate desire to learn. It begins with the premise that all human beings have a desire to learn; we are, in the words of John Holt, learning animals. And so I had an unusual experience—most kids don&#39;t get to choose whether they go to school. They have to go to school because their parents have to work full time. My dad was a professor, my mom stayed home, so we had the ability to stay home. And when we did, we didn&#39;t have any pretense about trying to do school at home. We were given the responsibility for our own education. Well, what interests you? What do you want to do? What do you care about? I had a lot of time on my hands—this was all before the Internet—a lot of time to read, a lot of time to draw, a lot of time to just stare at the walls.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I would occasionally try school. I did want to make friends, so I would go to school. But it gave me a real outsider&#39;s perspective. Because I was, like, What is school? Why is it set up this way? Why do we have to sit at our desks every day? Why do I have to ask before I go to the bathroom? Aren&#39;t I the one who knows if I need to go to the bathroom? It was just such a contrast with what my home life was like. And I think unschooling was an incredible gift. It has shaped who I am and how I see things. I had the incredible luxury, and so did my siblings, of really sinking into my passions. And I basically do exactly what I did when I was ten or eleven—which is, you know, write treatises about social ills.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;What were you writing about when you were ten or eleven?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I had a newsletter called &lt;em>;Kids for Animal Rights and the Environment&lt;/em>;. I was trying to basically start a kid revolution against the adults who were lying to us about environmental destruction, and tricking us into eating meat—and actually it was a really good organizing lesson. I didn&#39;t know that many kids, but I would try to recruit them for my zine, and I was, like, Oh, my God, they&#39;re not all just naturally militant animal-rights people like I am? It was my first foray into trying to, I guess, organize, and also encountering the fact that people don&#39;t agree with me. Which is why I&#39;m always trying to bridge the gap. I just thought, Well, the kids, we&#39;re going to be in solidarity. We&#39;re going to expose the lies about factory farming and the fact that the ozone layer is disappearing! And then some kids were, like, We don&#39;t care. I was, like, Oh, wow. I have to persuade the &lt;em>;kids&lt;/em>;.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;How did you do it? What tactics were you feeling out?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I think I was going for pretty straight agitprop—like, pictures of polluted environments and suffering creatures. And I have to say, when I did eventually go to high school for a few years, I met people with so many different points of view, and people I really liked with radically different perspectives than me. I think I did about ten years of deep introspection—like, Well, who am I to tell people what to think? How do I know I&#39;m right? Humility is a virtue that I really think is important—being radical without being rigid. Reassessing, and trying to invite people into your world view and to start a conversation that they might not otherwise consider if you come on too strong or you come on too militantly or you come on too condescendingly. I&#39;m keenly aware of the fact that I have minority perspectives, because I still have those values that I had as a little kid, about animals and about the earth. And they&#39;re not the majority view.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;0e0xj&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;plcghi&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;The other big thing for the unschooling stuff is, as I write in the book, I went to high school in Athens, Georgia, and I couldn&#39;t help but acknowledge the incredible social disparities. Some kids were only being fed at school. There were also incredible racial disparities—I went to a majority-Black school in Georgia, and it was mostly white kids in the gifted program. And I think it did get me thinking about who can unschool.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Learning is my greatest pleasure, and I really want that for other people. Insecurity forces you to conceive of education in really limiting terms. Because you have to get a return on investment—you have to get a degree that pays off your student debt. This is one thing that the Debt Collective is hoping to do more, but I think we need to make a really robust defense of public education as a right for everybody. And not just as a right to get job training so you can get a decent career or have a chance at upward mobility but as the right to learn. I think it&#39;s one of the most telling political quotes in American history when Ronald Reagan says that the state shouldn&#39;t be in the business of subsidizing curiosity. My ideal state absolutely does that, because I think we&#39;ll be better people for it.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I try in my writing and in my films to give people a taste of curiosity. Some people write poems that are supposed to move you and make you feel wistful, and some films are funny or scary or whatever. I&#39;m always going after the experience of epiphany—to give people a glimpse of that intellectual pleasure that I think we&#39;re really hungry for.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;Just in terms of the sheer breadth of the work you&#39;ve done, I noticed that in the bio for this book you included being on tour with Neutral Milk Hotel.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Yeah, I put that in my bio because it was four years of my life. It was a pretty big chunk. And, you know, I&#39;m proud that I was in Neutral Milk Hotel. I think they&#39;re a pretty great band. And yes, I&#39;m married to Jeff Mangum, who was the lead singer, and whom I met in Athens, Georgia, where I grew up.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;What did you play?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I played guitar and accordion and keyboard. This is maybe where the limits of unschooling come in—I play a lot of instruments as well as I could teach myself to play them. So I could be a very decent one-woman punk band. The Neutral Milk Hotel music is the upper limit of my technical ability. There&#39;s literally nothing that I will ever do in my life that is as nerve-racking as playing an electrified accordion onstage—it&#39;s truly the most persnickety instrument that you could ever play. That was a nightly dose of terror. Yesterday, I was really nervous before the lecture, and I was, like, This is not as bad as playing that damn accordion.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The other thing is, you know, this is who I am. I&#39;m not a professor. I&#39;m not a person who has had a single linear path or who is focussed on one domain. I just do all these things and I kind of follow my gut. I put it in there partly to just be honest about that, and, hopefully, as a way of giving permission to others to do what they want to do. ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;pipriv&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot;

Before the United Nations General Assembly, Zelensky called Russia&#39;s war an act of “genocide.” In Washington, the Ukrainian President met with senators, House members, President Biden, and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy rejected Zelensky&#39;s request to address Congress, saying that there wasn&#39;t enough time, given the ongoing battle over funding the government. Meanwhile, some Republicans are arguing that attention should be turned away from Russia&#39;s invasion and toward the threat that China poses to the US How will the country&#39;s foreign policy respond to these pressures?

After the funeral, Boyt went through severe depression, struggling with a grief that she couldn&#39;t readily articulate to others. Eschewing the sympathy of friends and psychiatrists alike, Boyt sought help from an unlikely source: from autumn, 1989, to summer, 1990, she watched “Judy Garland: The Concert Years” every day. As Boyt recounts in her 2009 memoir, “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/My-Judy-Garland-Life-Memoir/dp/B004LQ0IG0&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/My-Judy-Garland-Life-Memoir/dp/B004LQ0IG0&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/My-Judy-Garland-Life-Memoir/dp/B004LQ0IG0&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;My Judy Garland Life&lt;/a>;,” communing with the eighty-eight-minute PBS special featuring some of Garland&#39;s most famous performances was, for a time, her only solace—a near-religious “extreme daily psychic pain ritual” in the solitary confines of her drafty living room. The pathos of Garland&#39;s ecstatic renditions enabled Boyt to begin to work through her grief. “We sat it out together,” she writes, “and it kept me functioning in a very modest way, until the experts came in.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Boyt is no stranger to the everyday practices that sustain the psyche. “I was born into a family that takes making people feel better very seriously,” a chapter of “My Judy Garland Life” begins. This is an understatement: her great-grandfather was Sigmund Freud, the founding theorist of psychoanalysis. Born in London in 1969, Boyt is the youngest child of the British painter Lucian Freud and Suzy Boyt. (The latter, who trained as a painter, was one of Lucian&#39;s pupils at art school.) The couple separated before Boyt&#39;s birth, and her mother raised the children alone. Their “normal lives were straitened, no-frills, occasionally austere,” yet Boyt remembers Christmases as distinctly extravagant. Her mother&#39;s “legendary” Christmas stockings (in fact just pairs of tights) were always “crammed with all manner of delights.” Gifts themselves could be transformative, while the holidays were at once “luxurious and sustaining.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Boyt was a sensitive child who quickly picked up “the art of consolation.” She remembers how, growing up, the phone was forever ringing, her friends calling to seek advice on subjects from “delinquent parents” to “lemon meringue pie.” Boyt&#39;s approach was “one of acute listening paired with high-octane cheerleading,” a two-pronged strategy that could turn someone&#39;s mood around in half an hour. “I got results,” she recalls. But when Boyt trained as a bereavement counsellor in her mid-twenties, a few years after her boyfriend&#39;s death, her “attitude toward consolation shifted subtly.” The art of consolation, she learned, is hard to master. Although some people in despair want support that is diversionary—the kind that distracts and cheers—others desire nothing more than that you sit with them in their suffering: “Distressed people need to be allowed to reject your optimism now and then without taking responsibility for your hurt or alarm.” This, for the compulsive caretaker, can be difficult to manage. As Boyt grows older, her powers of consolation expand—she seems to come to understand that caring for others also entails acknowledging one&#39;s own limits.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Boyt started publishing fiction in her late twenties. Her novels often dramatize the complex negotiations that come with making people feel better. They feature protagonists who take care of others but are less sure about how to care for themselves.“&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Normal-Man-Susie-Boyt/dp/0297815318&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Normal-Man-Susie-Boyt/dp/0297815318&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Normal-Man-Susie-Boyt/dp/0297815318&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;The Normal Man&lt;/a>;” (1996) follows the love life of a young woman who struggles with both disordered eating and with taking care of her grieving mother following the death of her father. “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Characters-Love-Susie-Boyt/dp/0753802309&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Characters-Love-Susie-Boyt/dp/0753802309&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Characters-Love-Susie-Boyt/dp/0753802309&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;The Characters of Love&lt;/a>;” (1997) involves a psychiatrist who, despite having a special interest in child development, is largely absent from his daughter&#39;s upbringing. In “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Only-Human-Susie-Boyt/dp/074726516X&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Only-Human-Susie-Boyt/dp/074726516X&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Only-Human-Susie-Boyt/dp/074726516X&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;Only Human&lt;/a>;” (2004), the protagonist, Marjorie, is a marriage counsellor whose own husband died months after their daughter&#39;s birth. Grief makes her almost comically bad at her job, and she is desperate to keep her clients&#39; marriages intact as a means to cope with the loss of her own.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Ruth, the central figure of “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Loved-Missed-Susie-Boyt-ebook/dp/B08S2TDY1K&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Loved-Missed-Susie-Boyt-ebook/dp/B08S2TDY1K&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Loved-Missed-Susie-Boyt-ebook/dp/B08S2TDY1K&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;Loved and Missed&lt;/a>;,” is another professional caretaker, a schoolteacher who mentors teen-age girls who look to her for guidance. “They called me mum sometimes,” she notes, “the younger ones.” Yet Ruth&#39;s pedagogical talents fail her when it comes to her own daughter, Eleanor—who, we learn, left home at fifteen and suffers from a severe drug addiction. Eleanor repeatedly rejects her care, leaving Ruth to wonder whether “the economy of sympathy had a different cellular structure” between blood relations.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Ruth and Eleanor&#39;s vexed relationship falls into a predictable pattern. The mother desperately endeavors to care for her withholding daughter; the daughter evades her efforts. The novel is largely narrated from Ruth&#39;s perspective, her voice warm, at times excessively so. Eleanor, meanwhile, hovers forbiddingly in the margins. We know only that she is in pain; her brief appearances, when she&#39;s not getting high, just serve to render her more unreachable as a character. “I was often slow on the uptake where Eleanor was concerned, the last to know my own thoughts and actions even,” Ruth reflects, the sentence grammatically performing the way information is delivered in the novel, through small shocks and delayed revelations. In flashes of Ruth&#39;s retrospection, we glean the outlines of Eleanor&#39;s childhood: that she was born out of wedlock, that her father was largely absent, that “a few weeks after she hit thirteen . 。 。 she swung her love away” from her mother. “She&#39;d tell it differently, of course,” Ruth concedes, “but she wouldn&#39;t talk to me.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Ruth narrates her side of the story by way of skewed analogies, likening Eleanor&#39;s teen-age derision to “a particular species of domestic violence” and comparing her attempts to find her daughter during late nights to those of a “Victorian infant trying to track down its errant father.” Eleanor may be addicted to drugs, but Ruth is helplessly, hopelessly addicted to Eleanor. Ruth tries to care for her daughter, but her daughter sets all their rules of engagement. “I really didn&#39;t know what was fair,” she confesses, “let alone what was allowed.” For Ruth, being the mother to an addict is a kind of unrequited love; Eleanor remains powerful in her absence, like a beautiful but scornful paramour. On the rare occasions when her daughter does visit, Ruth marvels at her futile dependence on Eleanor: “I never understood why her eating filled &lt;em>;me&lt;/em>; up.” Ruth&#39;s insistence on caring for Eleanor risks increasing the guilt she feels over enabling her daughter; the more she gives, the less hope Eleanor seems to have of giving up her addiction.&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;In Boyt&#39;s fiction, food is often the battleground on which women wage war against one another, not to mention themselves. The opening chapter of “Loved and Missed” depicts, in excruciating yet tender detail, one of the bleaker Christmas meals I&#39;ve encountered in literature. Ruth, like Boyt, believes in the restorative effects of Christmastime and manages to persuade Eleanor and her boyfriend, Ben—also a drug addict—to meet for a holiday lunch. Ruth suggests a picnic at Regent&#39;s Park, “somewhere with a sense of occasion,” but Eleanor counters with a bus-stop bench on “a modest strip of grass next to a main road.” When they meet, Ruth is armed with a bag crammed with all manner of seasonal treats, festive cloths, gold paper plates, a “tall red candle in an eggcup,” and even a box of Turkish delight. Eleanor rejects the entire performance by refusing to eat.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;It&#39;s a harrowing sequence, saved only by Eleanor announcing, at the end, with tentative optimism, that she&#39;s pregnant. But the promise of bringing another daughter into this family is also a threat of grief compounded: here is just one more life that risks being ruined. Upon birth, the baby, Lily, is soon given “tiny amounts of morphine because she was having trouble sleeping and feeding and she was weak and in distress.” Ruth watches “the morphine going into her system” with rising horror and worries aloud to the nurse, “What if that&#39;s all she wants now?” Seven months later, at Lily&#39;s christening, Ruth decides to take matters—which is to say, her granddaughter—into her own hands. That morning, she sells a Walter Richard Sickert painting (“the best thing I had”) to a wiry man “with a stale Dickensian pallor” for four thousand pounds and, when the ceremony is over, gives the money—a hazardous amount of cash for any addict—to Eleanor and Ben in exchange for taking Lily home for a week. After the first week, upon seeing the state of the couple&#39;s flat, Ruth decides to keep her. An unspoken agreement is established: Ruth will raise her granddaughter and Eleanor will visit when she can, which turns out to be infrequently and erratically.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;q0l1ed&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;ihdhh&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;At a practical level, this Dickensian trade-off makes sense: Eleanor struggles to care for herself, Ruth has excess care to give, and Lily desperately needs care. It would be simplistic to say that Lily compensates Ruth for the loss of Eleanor. But Lily does provide Ruth a substitute on whom to lavish the love her daughter refuses. Her presence changes the novel&#39;s equations of care. Ruth begins to wean herself off Eleanor, who only reminds her of the unbridgeable distance between how she tried to raise her daughter and what her daughter has become.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;It is one of the great charms of the book that, while Boyt is clear-eyed about the compulsions driving Ruth&#39;s caregiving, the descriptions of this caregiving remain so seductive. Much of the novel depicts, with exquisite detail, the prosaic patterns of Ruth and Lily&#39;s home life—quotidian routines between grandmother and granddaughter that are mildly intoxicating. “She was very organised for a person of five,” Ruth says, of her granddaughter. “She organised me.” Ruth is raising Lily, but the care flows in the other direction as well. “I loved the simple rubbing-along with another person, friendliness, a calm and busy rhythm, lustre and life cheer, snippets of shared news, flapjacks with raisins (she loved raisins), our stupid jokes,” Ruth thinks. The text brims with domestic techniques: instructions for preparing Christmas turkey and spaghetti with clams (rinse them “about fifty times in cold water”), for arranging lilacs, for removing red-wine stains (“white wine vinegar and soda crystals”). One chapter begins with an Elizabeth David recipe: “&lt;em>;For a plump roasting chicken knead the butter with the tarragon leaves, half a clove of chopped garlic, salt and pepper. Put this inside the bird, which should be well coated with olive oil&lt;/em>;.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Late in the novel, Lily and Ruth, walking in a church graveyard, pass a tombstone that reads “&lt;em>;Loved and Missed&lt;/em>;.” The phrase initially prompts laughter and then later, upon recollection, tears from Lily. “It kind of sounds like the person &lt;em>;tried&lt;/em>; to be loving, but the target moved, ” she begins. “Or . 。 。 or . 。 。 they maybe just weren&#39;t very good at it.” In Boyt&#39;s novel, both these things seem to be true at once. Eleanor is a moving target for love—first Ruth&#39;s and later Lily&#39;s—both loved and missed, missed and loved. In the course of the book, we keep waiting for her to come into focus. She never does. But her absence brings Ruth and Lily&#39;s endurance into relief. They emerge as people in desperate want—for a daughter, in Ruth&#39;s case; a mother, in Lily&#39;s—who find a way to make do without what they lack.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Between the targets that keep moving and the care that keeps misfiring, the equation of care in Boyt&#39;s novel doesn&#39;t come out even. No one gets exactly what they need—perhaps least of all Eleanor, who refuses Ruth&#39;s, and then Lily&#39;s, attempts at love. Still, in her own place, Eleanor offers her mother and daughter each someone who can do what she can&#39;t. The two of them, Lily and Ruth, sit it out together for a while and keep one another functioning in their modest, miraculous way. ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;ts1r4&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot;

>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;The first time I saw an AR-15 up close was at my friend Agustin&#39;s house, in Texas. This was in the summer of 2020, after the mass shootings in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-legacy-of-the-el-paso-shooting&quot;>;El Paso&lt;/a>; and Sutherland Springs and Midland-Odessa, but before the ones in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/seeing-america-again-in-the-texas-elementary-school-shooting&quot;>;Uvalde&lt;/a>; and Cleveland and the Allen Outlets mall.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I had been shooting guns because I had been writing about guns. So far, though, my only experience was with pistols; Agustin had offered to teach me about semi-automatic rifles. Agustin and I were both members of the volunteer fire department in Marfa, which sounds more exciting than it is—we spent a lot of time sitting around the station, fiddling with engines, and trading local gossip.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I&#39;d picked Agustin as my long-gun tutor because he seemed like a good mixture of brave and safe. He worked at the power company, where he was a lineman; on the weekends, he competed in those obstacle courses in which you scale walls and splash through mud pits. He had a black Corvette that he drove in an open-road race in which the goal was not to go as fast as possible but to maintain an average speed of a hundred and twenty-five miles per hour. That was very Agustin—adrenaline, but within boundaries. On the rare occasion it was necessary for the fire department to enter a burning building, it was often Agustin who went.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I went over one evening for the first lesson. Agustin&#39;s dog nosed at my knees and I scratched her on the head, but I had a hard time paying attention to anything other than the gun. It sat on a table in the living room, an empty magazine beside it. I&#39;d grown to appreciate the handgun I&#39;d been shooting, a friend&#39;s Glock, for its heft in my hand, its compact efficiency. But I didn&#39;t like the rifle. It seemed to radiate menace, even unloaded. Its aesthetic was one that I associated with soldiers and &lt;em >;SWAT&lt;/em>; teams and spree killers. I&#39;d heard gun people scoff at the gun-ignorant expressing this kind of reflexive, animistic fear. What did I think it was going to do, jump up and bite me? (Of course, gun people believe in the fetishistic power of the semi-automatic rifle, too—that&#39;s why they put its silhouette on their shirts, their bumper stickers, their flags.)&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;A friend who had recently returned from living in Scandinavia was vehemently opposed to my project. Why did I need to shoot guns to write about guns? To him, it was simple: in America, they were instruments of death. If there was anything more I needed to learn, perhaps I could go interview some parents of murdered children, or watch footage of the aftermath of a mass shooting in the setting of my choice—mall, church, library, Walmart, movie theatre, dance club. I could look at some charts of gun deaths per hundred thousand residents: Norway, Denmark, Finland, hugging the x-axis; the United States, a line spiking out of all proportion, like a statistical error.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;But I believed that I wouldn&#39;t be able to understand where I lived unless I wrapped my head around the guns themselves. No other state is so closely associated with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/how-did-guns-get-so-powerful&quot;>;mythology of the gun&lt;/a>;, and, by raw numbers, Texas has more of them than anywhere else in the US (Per capita, our rates of firearm ownership are closer to the national average.) No matter where I go, when I tell people where I live, they grin and point gun fingers at me. Bang, bang—the universally understood symbol for Texas.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Around the time of my visit to Agustin&#39;s house, I had been reading the work of David Yamane, a professor of sociology at Wake Forest University and a self-identified liberal gun owner. One of Yamane&#39;s main points was that, for many Americans, guns are normal—neither instruments of righteous retribution, like some on the right like to imagine, nor harbingers of societal collapse, like some on the left believe. Millions of Americans live with firearms, and most of them don&#39;t kill themselves or anyone else. As a Texan, as an American, I was going to encounter guns, whether I liked it or not. Perhaps it was possible to enter into a truce with them, or even to find some appreciation. But there was something else: if everyone around me was going to be armed, then I should probably know how to shoot, too.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I grew up in a conservative place—I went to a public high school whose mascot was a Confederate soldier, in a city where one of the main thoroughfares featured monuments to Confederate generals, in a state where the third Monday in January was celebrated not as Martin Luther King, Jr., Day but as Lee-Jackson-King Day—but the conservatism of suburban Virginia in the nineties wasn&#39;t oriented around guns. This was before &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/twenty-years-after-columbine&quot;>;Columbine&lt;/a>;, before the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. I had plenty of classmates who spent weekends hunting with their uncles, but guns didn&#39;t define anyone&#39;s personality.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;After college, I lived in Baltimore, a city with tough gun laws and lots of gun murders. During the summer, I worked at an outdoor-education program for high-school students. The sweetest of the teens didn&#39;t come back the second year; I heard that he had been hit by a stray bullet, and was now in a wheelchair. The Baltimore police founded a special task force to get guns off the street, and it became one of the most successful gangs in the city—robbing people, planting guns, stealing drugs and reselling them. In Baltimore, the presence of a gun would have indicated some kind of emergency, and I had no urge to shoot one. Then, in 2012, I moved to rural Texas. My first week in town, a new friend invited me to go to a ranch for target practice. We tromped through the switchgrass and pointed a borrowed shotgun at a row of empty beer cans. I was giddy at the strangeness of it all: the wide expanse of sky; the grasshoppers as big as my palm, hurtling across the path; the casual, unapologetic presence of guns. I kept a spent shell in my pocket for a week, a reminder of my new life.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I arrived in Texas with the vague impression that the state was a lawless libertarian paradise when it came to firearms, but that wasn&#39;t exactly true. Until the mid-nineties, when the Texas legislature passed a contentious bill allowing concealed carry, it was illegal for civilians to be armed in public. (Texas&#39;s gun restrictions stemmed from post-Civil War attempts to keep weapons away from both restive Confederates and formerly enslaved people.) As opinions about guns became more politicized, advocating looser laws became a useful tool for politicians to motivate a conservative base. But, when I moved there, Texas was still less gun-friendly than Missouri or Florida or a dozen other states, according to a ranking in &lt;em>;Guns &amp;amp; Ammo&lt;/em>;. The Republican-dominated legislature kept pushing. In 2016, the state legalized open carry for permit holders; then the legislature got rid of the need for a permit. Now nearly any adult in Texas can be armed in public without the need for training, background checks, or rudimentary guidance.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Texas&#39;s gun policies are increasingly misaligned with public opinion—even many conservatives weren&#39;t thrilled about permitless carry—but it doesn&#39;t seem to matter. Earlier this year, families from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/seeing-america-again-in-the-texas-elementary-school-shooting&quot;>;Uvalde&lt;/a>;, where, in 2022, a gunman with an AR-15 killed nineteen students and two teachers at Robb Elementary School, campaigned to raise the minimum age to buy some semi-automatic weapons from eighteen to twenty-one, a broadly popular proposal. Instead, the legislature opted to require at least one armed security officer in every public school. The state&#39;s rates of gun deaths—suicides, homicides, and accidents—are the highest they&#39;ve been in decades.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Agustin and I practiced at a range on the outskirts of Alpine, a BYO-targets kind of place where the ground was littered with brass bullet casings. Agustin approached the exercise with a rigor that was almost ritualistic. I liked doing something that was serious enough to require ear and eye protection; I liked the sound the magazine made when I clicked it into place; I liked how jangly I felt after I pulled the trigger, all the built-up tension in my body suddenly released. When my shots went wide, which was often, I would feel an obsessive focus on correcting my error. And I liked holding that much power in my hands. Better in mine than in yours, I remember thinking, a thought directed at no one in particular, or at everyone.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In 2020, amid the upheavals of the pandemic, the Presidential election, and the George Floyd protests, the United States, a country that already had more guns than people, accumulated millions more of them, many purchased by first-time gun owners. A large share of the 22.8 million firearms sold that year were bought by white men, who make up the vast majority of gun owners. But some of the fastest-growing segments of gun owners are from backgrounds the industry considers “non-traditional”: women, Asian Americans, liberals.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;That year and into the next, I continued with my gun research. I got a concealed-carry permit, for journalism, and spent some time at a gun store in Austin, also for journalism. Or at least that was the excuse I gave my friends. The store had flyers for a gun-themed comedy show called “Guns and Giggles,” which I did not attend. I was at the shop so frequently that I developed a crush on one of its employees, a lanky bicycle mechanic whose name was Freedom. The natural next step would be to get a gun, for journalism. Freedom recommended a Glock 19: compact, with minimal kickback. A year earlier, the idea would have struck me as absurd, but now it had the aura of possibility.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;goxz8r&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;vetquf&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Friends and acquaintances kept telling me about the guns they had bought, or almost bought. My mother, who had never displayed any interest in firearms, mentioned that she&#39;d taken a women&#39;s-only handgun class. On Instagram, I followed a collective of trans alpaca farmers living in rural Colorado whose pictures of their baby animals were interspersed with pictures of their self-defense arsenal. A couple of my most politically active friends went to the woods for mysterious tactical training that they were pointedly close-lipped about.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In November, I travelled to Arizona to take a defensive pistol class at Gunsite, a bucket-list destination for a certain kind of dad. For five days, a sinewy, joyless ex-special-ops soldier watched over us as we practiced drawing, aiming, firing, and reloading as quickly and as accurately as possible. The point of all the repetition was to build muscle memory, to make the actions automatic, movement that preceded thought. Before holstering your weapon, you were supposed to ask yourself: Is my world safe? If not, you stayed drawn.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;I loaded enough bullets that week that my thumb cramped, so I bought a speed loader. It was pink, the preferred color for gun accessories for women. (You can get pink thigh holsters, pink-camo gun safes, and enough pink parts to build an almost entirely pink AR-15.) I was one of two women in the class, and our instructors kept praising us for our presence. All week long, they had been presenting scenarios to justify our imaginary use of force. They were usually laced with sexual menace: the biker gang, the meth heads, and the “unspeakable things” they wanted to do to women and children. Being armed was not just a means of self-defense but a responsibility, according to this way of thinking. Men were armed in order to protect women; empowerment, in gun world, was women protecting themselves.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I wouldn&#39;t say I had a good time at Gunsite, exactly, but I did feel a growing pride in my competence. I wasn&#39;t the worst shooter in the class, as I&#39;d feared. I wore my loaner pistol in a hip holster, and its presence, initially unnerving, soon faded into the background of my day. One evening, back at my hotel, I had the sudden sense that I had forgotten something important. I looked around the room for a minute before I figured it out: it was the weight of the gun that I missed.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The sociologist Jennifer Carlson &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/dp/0199347557&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/dp/0199347557&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/dp/0199347557&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;writes about&lt;/a>; the figure of the “citizen-protector”: “Gun carriers use firearms to actively assert their authority and relevance by embracing the duty to protect themselves and police others.” For Carlson, this new model of citizenship emerges from a context of American decline, economic precarity, and social alienation. In a world of decaying institutions, the citizen-protector takes matters into his own hands. The implicit assumption that he is not just a guy with a gun but a &lt;em>;good&lt;/em>; guy with a gun is fundamental, a conviction so automatic that it precedes thought. During my lunch break at Gunsite, I indulged in my own citizen-protector daydreams. In them, I was in the midst of some future calamity, a mass-shooting incident, say. It never ended with me coolly bringing down the bad guy with a single shot—in my fantasies, I was unarmed—but with me using my new knowledge to seize his gun and confidently eject the bullet from the chamber.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The grand finale of the week was a tour of the home of Gunsite&#39;s late founder, an imperious and erudite racist named Jeff Cooper. The house was built like a fortress, with walls that could withstand small-arms fire, steel gates to shield the bedrooms, and window slits near the front door so that Cooper could target any unwelcome visitors. As Cooper&#39;s granddaughter served us cookies and juice, my classmates asked, again, if I was going to get a gun. They wanted to recruit another person to their side, I&#39;m sure. But I think they also thought that I should own a gun for my own good.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“A gun is status—that&#39;s why they call it an equalizer,” Richard Hofstadter quotes “a young Chicago black” as saying, in a 1970 article in &lt;em>;American Heritage&lt;/em>; on American gun culture. “What&#39;s happening today is that everybody&#39;s getting more and more equal, because everybody&#39;s got one.” But convictions for gun crimes still disproportionately impact Black and Latino populations. A police officer killed &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/old-questions-but-no-new-answers-in-the-philando-castile-verdict&quot;>;Philando Castile&lt;/a>; when he was reaching for his gun license; Marissa Alexander was sentenced to twenty years for firing a warning shot in the air to scare off her abusive husband. As an equalizing instrument, guns are no match for an unequal society; if anything, they merely make existing inequalities more volatile.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I got to Uvalde late on the night of the shooting at Robb Elementary School, after driving through one of the biggest storms I&#39;ve ever encountered. It was Biblical, terrifying. The next morning, the first camera crews were staking out their spots in the grassy plaza across the street from City Hall. Uvalde was a town of hunters and veterans and small-scale drug crime—a town where guns were normal, until they weren&#39;t.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/letter-from-the-southwest/after-the-uvalde-shooting-lifelong-residents-consider-how-to-stop-the-next-one&quot;>;interviewed&lt;/a>; an elderly man in a “Duck Dynasty” cap, sent adrift by the news. He was a hunter, but he didn&#39;t understand the appeal of an AR-15. “I don&#39;t even like &lt;em>;pistols&lt;/em>;,” he told me, stricken. I saw him at the library weeks later, and he looked worse, pale and hollowed out. “I&#39;m having a hard time,” he said. I think I hugged him, but I don&#39;t remember. I remember feeling unequal to his grief; I felt unequal to everyone&#39;s grief in Uvalde. I remember thinking about the refrain I&#39;d learned at Gunsite: &lt;em>;Is my world safe?&lt;/em>; I could imagine wanting to draw a gun and never, ever putting it down.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I haven&#39;t shot a gun since I was in Uvalde; I seem to have lost my appetite for it. I didn&#39;t know that the last time would be the last. Three months before Uvalde, I was on the way to Boca Chica, the South Texas beach where SpaceX launches its rockets, and I stopped at Massey&#39;s, a gun range I had visited once before. Massey&#39;s has the alarming, ramshackle charm of a roadside stand that rents Uzis. A poster on the wall showed a silhouette of a man looming outside a suburban house, and the caption “He&#39;s not here to borrow a cup of sugar.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;It was a slow day, and the guy behind the counter flirted with me half-heartedly. He showed me the custom etchings on his AR, where the safety switch was labelled “Libturd” and “Triggered.” He gave me a fifty-calibre bullet as a souvenir, and let me shoot his handgun with the silencer on so that I could see how quiet it was. Finally, he walked me out to the range with my rental pistol and a box of bullets. He hung around to watch me load the magazine. It had been a while, and my hand shook a little. I didn&#39;t think I was afraid, and yet there it was, my body telling me something that my mind didn&#39;t know yet. He looked at me kindly, forgiving me for my nerves. “You just have to keep practicing,” he said. “You get to where you can override the fear, where you don&#39;t feel it anymore.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;For a moment I could imagine myself as who he wanted me to be. My movements so practiced that I didn&#39;t think about them anymore. Impervious, solid in my certainty, hands held firm, steady in my aim. It was later, when I was in Uvalde, that I understood that the shaking came from a part of me I didn&#39;t want to override. The world is tough, I remember thinking during my gun period. Maybe you have to meet it where it is, rather than wish it were otherwise. But I&#39;ve decided that I don&#39;t believe that.

Their production was funded in part by the government&#39;s official film-supporting bodies, both through direct subsidies and through the widespread practice of movie theatres showing shorts along with features. Almost all the major directors of the era made several short films en route to (and even during) their feature-film careers, and many of these shorts are prime entries in their bodies of work. I &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-front-row/what-we-lose-when-streaming-companies-choose-what-we-watch&quot;>;wrote recently&lt;/a>; of the urgency of getting and keeping hard copies—DVDs or Blu-rays—of films that one cherishes. This week, Icarus Films put out exactly the kind of release that should be snapped up for prolonged cherishing, a two-disk set titled “Early Short Films of the French New Wave,” which presents largely unfamiliar work of enduring power. (For viewers who prefer to stream, the films are also available on OVID.tv.)&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;These films, which were made between 1956 and 1966, were produced by Pierre Braunberger, who had made his name in the nineteen-twenties and thirties with films directed by Jean Renoir. Most of the shorts in the set are by celebrated directors working in styles different from the ones for which they&#39;re famed. The set features a trio of films by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/postscript/jean-luc-godard-was-cinemas-north-star&quot;>;Jean-Luc Godard&lt;/a>; (one co-directed by François Truffaut), two by Alain Resnais, one by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/postscript/agnes-vardas-radically-personal-films&quot;>;Agnès Varda&lt;/a>;, and one by Jacques Rivette. Yet the five films that I consider mighty (albeit brief) masterworks come from less familiar filmmakers—or, in one case, a widely celebrated one in a surprising, unfamiliar context. They also show that the New Wave&#39;s new cinematic styles and forms were far more than decorative delights—they were new ways of looking at private lives and at the world at large.&lt;/p>;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;feature-default&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;image&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:feature-default&quot;>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;Still from the film “500 Francs.”&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650cc1d8d266277376e662cc/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/brody-french%2520new%2520wave-500%2520francs.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650cc1d8d266277376e662cc/master/w_120,c_limit/brody-french%20new%20wave-500%20francs.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650cc1d8d266277376e662cc/master/w_240,c_limit/brody-french%20new%20wave-500%20francs.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650cc1d8d266277376e662cc/master/w_320,c_limit/brody-french%20new%20wave-500%20francs.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650cc1d8d266277376e662cc/master/w_640,c_limit/brody-french%20new%20wave-500%20francs.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650cc1d8d266277376e662cc/master/w_960,c_limit/brody-french%20new%20wave-500%20francs.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650cc1d8d266277376e662cc/master/w_1280,c_limit/brody-french%20new%20wave-500%20francs.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650cc1d8d266277376e662cc/master/w_1600,c_limit/brody-french%20new%20wave-500%20francs.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/inline-embed>;&lt;div role=&quot;heading&quot; aria-level=&quot;3&quot; >;“500 Francs”&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;The 1961 film &lt;strong>;“500 Francs”&lt;/strong>; is credited onscreen to a director calling himself only Melvin. He&#39;s none other than &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-front-row/melvin-van-peebles-and-other-highlights-from-the-new-york-film-festival&quot;>;Melvin Van Peebles&lt;/a>;. As a Black American filmmaker thwarted in his effort to make a career in Hollywood in the nineteen-fifties, he emigrated to the Netherlands, then moved to France. There he published novels and made this film, which he followed up with his first feature, “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/goings-on-about-town/movies/the-story-of-a-three-day-pass&quot;>;The Story of a Three-Day Pass&lt;/a>;”—simultaneously one of the best French and best American films of the sixties. “500 Francs” is, in effect, a silent film; Van Peebles wrote it, directed it, and did the music for it, and there&#39;s no dialogue. The story involves a kid who sees a bill for the amount in question through a sewer grate and, hoping to fish it out, dangles his belt through the openings.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Though the dramatic stakes seem minor, Van Peebles distills the premise down to its essence—money and the need for it—and creates, in twelve minutes, a grim, grinding, even brutal panorama of poverty. The boy realizes that he needs something sticky, wants to get a gumball from a machine, has no coin to put in the slot, and tries in vain to steal one. (Instead, he ends up picking up from the gutter a spat-out wad of gum.) Soon the boy has competition: a grimy grownup who needs the money, too, and has experience and skill in getting it. The result is violence both real and symbolic, which (not to give away too much about the twelve minutes of action) shows us a society in which the poor are pitted against one another while the rich, remaining invulnerably above the fray, are able to ascribe the misfortunes of others to bad luck or even to the natural order. The film&#39;s accusatory fury is matched by Van Peebles&#39;s distinctive style, which distills the action into precise and sharp-edged compositions of high graphic design. The drama takes place in a gray city that, from a distance, seems like an oppressive monolith and, in closeup, is revealed as a crumbling wasteland. Such multilevel visual story sense would have been the envy of most of Van Peebles&#39;s Hollywood counterparts.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;feature-large-callout&quot; >;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;Still from the film “Love Exists.”&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650cc17ad266277376e662ca/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/brody-french%2520new%2520wave-love%2520exists.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650cc17ad266277376e662ca/master/w_120,c_limit/brody-french%20new%20wave-love%20exists.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650cc17ad266277376e662ca/master/w_240,c_limit/brody-french%20new%20wave-love%20exists.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650cc17ad266277376e662ca/master/w_320,c_limit/brody-french%20new%20wave-love%20exists.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650cc17ad266277376e662ca/master/w_640,c_limit/brody-french%20new%20wave-love%20exists.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650cc17ad266277376e662ca/master/w_960,c_limit/brody-french%20new%20wave-love%20exists.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650cc17ad266277376e662ca/master/w_1280,c_limit/brody-french%20new%20wave-love%20exists.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650cc17ad266277376e662ca/master/w_1600,c_limit/brody-french%20new%20wave-love%20exists.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div role=&quot;heading&quot; aria-level=&quot;3&quot; >;“Love Exists”&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Poverty and a coldly indifferent social order are also the prime subjects of the writer and director &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/the-misunderstood-maurice-pialat&quot;>;Maurice Pialat&lt;/a>;&#39;s documentary essay-film &lt;strong>;“Love Exists,”&lt;/strong>; from 1961, the most accomplished and far-reaching work in the set. Starting from the workaday banality of bustling city streets, of crowds, trains, platforms, buses, and the cold frustration of traffic-clotted roads, Pialat unleashes an autobiographical story (spoken in voice-over by Jean-Loup Reynold) that amounts to a long-stifled cry of rage. He describes growing up in working-class Paris, which, though poor, had a level of vitality in its public life (open-air dances, movie theatres) and also proximity to nature. What he now finds there is not just economic deprivation but desperate neglect, a cultural void in which boredom fuels violence. Huge housing projects, which he likens to concentration camps, have imposed social segregation, while small private houses springing up in the area both heighten isolation and display petty comforts in delusional denial of their setting; some are right next to an airport, under deafening flight patterns. With journalistic indignation, Pialat shows the plight of immigrant laborers living tightly packed in shantytown firetraps close to posh Paris neighborhoods. He uses statistics to document such inequalities as the paucity of educational opportunities, but his catalogue of hardships, as the title hints, is as philosophical as it is sociological: it is a study in existential agony, progressing from foreclosed childhood to benumbed adulthood to retirement in the shadow of death. Visually, his jeremiad is amplified by candidly confrontational and stylistically probing images that match Antonioni in architectural diagnostics and foreshadow Godard&#39;s “Alphaville” in techno-futuristic melancholy.&lt;/p>;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;feature-default&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;image&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:feature-default&quot;>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;Still from the film “Janine.”&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650cc1e2a6ca2173f433e31f/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/brody-french%2520new%2520wave-janine.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650cc1e2a6ca2173f433e31f/master/w_120,c_limit/brody-french%20new%20wave-janine.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650cc1e2a6ca2173f433e31f/master/w_240,c_limit/brody-french%20new%20wave-janine.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650cc1e2a6ca2173f433e31f/master/w_320,c_limit/brody-french%20new%20wave-janine.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650cc1e2a6ca2173f433e31f/master/w_640,c_limit/brody-french%20new%20wave-janine.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650cc1e2a6ca2173f433e31f/master/w_960,c_limit/brody-french%20new%20wave-janine.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650cc1e2a6ca2173f433e31f/master/w_1280,c_limit/brody-french%20new%20wave-janine.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650cc1e2a6ca2173f433e31f/master/w_1600,c_limit/brody-french%20new%20wave-janine.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/inline-embed>;&lt;div role=&quot;heading&quot; aria-level=&quot;3&quot; >;“Janine”&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;If love exists in such an environment, it&#39;s a miracle. Pialat&#39;s 1962 short fiction film, &lt;strong>;“Janine,”&lt;/strong>; shows two men from such a stultifying environment who both endure and perpetuate its miseries. They&#39;re both obsessed with the title character, played by Evelyne Ker, a single mother and a sex worker on the streets of Paris. One of her clients, Claude (Claude Berri, who also wrote the script—and would eventually become a commercially successful director), yearns to take her out on a regular date and dreams of getting married. Her ex, Hubert (Hubert Deschamps), who is her child&#39;s father, can&#39;t get Janine out of his mind. In his grimly depressive conversations during nocturnal wanderings with a sentimental, post-coital Claude, he denounces her and all women. Pialat delicately balances empathy for the men&#39;s narrow lives with contempt for their moral sloth, giving his film the terse naturalism and the whiplash sting of an ironic, erotic short story by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/the-writer-who-sparks-the-finest-movie-adaptations&quot;>;Maupassant&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;feature-default&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;image&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:feature-default&quot;>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;Still from the film “The Fifteen Year Old Widows.”&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650cc1dea7c2698078909d19/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/brody-french%2520new%2520wave-15%2520yr%2520old%2520widows.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650cc1dea7c2698078909d19/master/w_120,c_limit/brody-french%20new%20wave-15%20yr%20old%20widows.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650cc1dea7c2698078909d19/master/w_240,c_limit/brody-french%20new%20wave-15%20yr%20old%20widows.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650cc1dea7c2698078909d19/master/w_320,c_limit/brody-french%20new%20wave-15%20yr%20old%20widows.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650cc1dea7c2698078909d19/master/w_640,c_limit/brody-french%20new%20wave-15%20yr%20old%20widows.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650cc1dea7c2698078909d19/master/w_960,c_limit/brody-french%20new%20wave-15%20yr%20old%20widows.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650cc1dea7c2698078909d19/master/w_1280,c_limit/brody-french%20new%20wave-15%20yr%20old%20widows.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650cc1dea7c2698078909d19/master/w_1600,c_limit/brody-french%20new%20wave-15%20yr%20old%20widows.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/inline-embed>;&lt;div role=&quot;heading&quot; aria-level=&quot;3&quot; >;“The Fifteen-Year-Old Widows”&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Pialat (who directed the first of his many features, “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/goings-on-about-town/movies/lenfance-nue&quot;>;L&#39;Enfance Nue&lt;/a>;,” in 1968) also figures, as an actor, in &lt;strong>;“The Fifteen-Year-Old Widows,”&lt;/strong>; by Jean Rouch. Described in an opening title card as “an essay on adolescents in Paris in the summer of 1964,” the film is a drama built on a rich documentary substrate. A pioneer of such docu-fictions, Rouch casts two teen-agers, Marie-France de Chabaneix and Véronique Duval, as two girls (with the same first names as the actors) growing up in a milieu in which money is no object but is nonetheless a crucial subject. Both girls live in lavish houses in a fancy part of Paris, and Rouch, no less than Pialat in his impoverished suburb, wants to see whether love exists. Véronique is being raised by a single father, a busy businessman, and is the more adventurous of the pair; Marie-France, more pensive, lives with both her parents and the constant presence of her father&#39;s best friend, Robert, whom she suspects of having an affair with her mother. The girls are in high school and they socialize with college boys, also from wealthy families, who manifest casual misogyny and the heedlessness of unquestioned privilege.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;The seeming monotony of the girls&#39; lives is shattered when Véronique gets very drunk at a party and is raped. (Rouch doesn&#39;t depict the event, merely suggesting it via a montage of still photos.) When Véronique tells Marie-France what happened, she never uses the word and gives no indication that she was victimized, or even that anyone did anything wrong. There is no mention of trauma either, but it&#39;s central to the movie, as, afterward, Véronique&#39;s perspectives on her friends and her life, and even her self, change drastically. So, in a different way, do Marie-France&#39;s concerns, hopes, and plans. Pialat plays a fashion photographer who takes pictures of Véronique and questions her about sex and love, eliciting her bleak view of the adults around her and of the future that awaits her. His character is perhaps a stand-in for Rouch, who probed the apparent frivolity of emergent teen culture to explore the discontents that it embodied. (His 1962 short feature “The Punishment,” also on OVID.tv, portrays a high-school girl who, as a social experiment, submits to run-of-the-mill pickup routines and soon runs up against a city full of male predators.)&lt;/p>;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;feature-default&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;image&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:feature-default&quot;>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;Still from the film “The Botanical Avatar of Mademoiselle Flora.”&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650cc1e5a7c2698078909d1b/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/brody-french%2520new%2520wave-THE%2520BOTANICAL%2520AVATAR%2520OF%2520MADEMOISELLE%2520FLORA.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650cc1e5a7c2698078909d1b/master/w_120,c_limit/brody-french%20new%20wave-THE%20BOTANICAL%20AVATAR%20OF%20MADEMOISELLE%20FLORA.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650cc1e5a7c2698078909d1b/master/w_240,c_limit/brody-french%20new%20wave-THE%20BOTANICAL%20AVATAR%20OF%20MADEMOISELLE%20FLORA.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650cc1e5a7c2698078909d1b/master/w_320,c_limit/brody-french%20new%20wave-THE%20BOTANICAL%20AVATAR%20OF%20MADEMOISELLE%20FLORA.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650cc1e5a7c2698078909d1b/master/w_640,c_limit/brody-french%20new%20wave-THE%20BOTANICAL%20AVATAR%20OF%20MADEMOISELLE%20FLORA.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650cc1e5a7c2698078909d1b/master/w_960,c_limit/brody-french%20new%20wave-THE%20BOTANICAL%20AVATAR%20OF%20MADEMOISELLE%20FLORA.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650cc1e5a7c2698078909d1b/master/w_1280,c_limit/brody-french%20new%20wave-THE%20BOTANICAL%20AVATAR%20OF%20MADEMOISELLE%20FLORA.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/650cc1e5a7c2698078909d1b/master/w_1600,c_limit/brody-french%20new%20wave-THE%20BOTANICAL%20AVATAR%20OF%20MADEMOISELLE%20FLORA.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/inline-embed>;&lt;div role=&quot;heading&quot; aria-level=&quot;3&quot; >;“The Botanical Avatar of Mademoiselle Flora”&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Saving the best for last: the most astounding discovery in the two-disk set is another exploration of a woman&#39;s life—romantic, emotional, and even metaphysical—this one written and directed by a female filmmaker: &lt;strong>;“The Botanical Avatar of Mademoiselle Flora,”&lt;/strong>; from 1965. It&#39;s directed by Jeanne Barbillon, whose career turns out to have been unfortunately scant, and it features the great Bernadette Lafont, who&#39;d acted in a short by Truffaut and went on to star in his most unusual feature, “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/dvr-alert-such-a-gorgeous-kid-like-me&quot;>;A Gorgeous Girl Like Me&lt;/a>;,” and also in Jean Eustache&#39;s historic “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-front-row/the-mother-and-the-whore-newly-restored-still-overwhelming&quot;>;The Mother and the Whore&lt;/a>;.” Lafont plays a woman named Flora, who reminisces about her forty-six-day cohabitation, in a provincial town, with a French soldier named Charles (Louis Mesuret). She unassumingly describes a tale of misery and frustration, with Charles on duty most of the day and often at night, leaving her with no money for even simple pleasures, tyrannically controlling her household expenditures, and otherwise either criticizing or ignoring her. Barbillon (working with the cinematographer Raoul Coutard, who&#39;d revolutionized the craft with “Breathless”) films the breezy tragedy of small-scale incompatibility and large-scale despair in a series of wry vignettes that lead to a wondrous effect, a comic mask for ineffable horror. What happened to Barbillon, I can&#39;t trace: she made one more short in the same year, then a TV movie in 1984, and, apparently, nothing more. Yet “Mademoiselle Flora” is the work of a filmmaker who, in her art and her ideas, is the peer of any in Braunberger&#39;s exalted circle. The film&#39;s availability is as much a cause for celebration as for bewilderment and bitter historical regret. ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot;

Chronicling the end of a marriage for her recent album “Chemistry,” she tells the staff writer Hanif Abdurraqib, was a very different thing. David Remnick talks with Hernan Diaz about “Trust,” Diaz&#39;s very contemporary novel of financial misdeeds in the run-up to the crash of 1929. The novelist was interested in high finance as a realm of “pure abstraction” that isolates capital from the labor that produces it.

Not surprisingly, Willow drew opposition—more than five million people, many of them young, signed petitions against the plan, and a million sent letters to the White House—which, the &lt;em>;Times&lt;/em>; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/19/climate/young-climate-activists.html&quot;>;noted last month&lt;/a>;, could become “a wild card factor in next year&#39;s presidential race.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;But the Willow field is not the only major fossil-fuel project in the works. Soon, you may also be hearing a good deal about CP2, or Calcasieu Pass 2, an enormous liquefied-natural-gas export terminal that&#39;s been proposed for the Louisiana coast, and which the Biden Administration is likely to approve or reject this fall. The project, the largest of at least twenty LNG terminals proposed by a handful of companies to take gas mostly from the Southwest&#39;s Permian Basin to overseas customers, is a poster child for late-stage petrocapitalism: it would help lock in the planet&#39;s reliance on fossil fuels long past what scientists have identified as the breaking point for the climate system. And it will bring to the fore one of the most crucial—and least-discussed—parts of the climate fight: America&#39;s rapidly increasing exports of oil and gas to the rest of the world. To give an idea of how big the battle at CP2 could turn out to be: according to the veteran energy analyst Jeremy Symons, the greenhouse-gas emissions associated with it would be twenty times larger than those from the oil drilling at Willow.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The Calcasieu Ship Channel is a sixty-eight-mile-long waterway, dating to the eighteen-seventies, which the Army Corps of Engineers subsequently dredged to provide deep-water access from the Gulf of Mexico thirty miles north, to the city of Lake Charles—now the twelfth-largest port in the United States. The channel is strategically situated not just because ships can easily reach it from the Gulf of Mexico but because pipelines can easily reach it from the Permian Basin. Venture Global, a Virginia-based company bidding to become the country&#39;s leading natural-gas exporter, has already built one big LNG terminal, Calcasieu Pass 1, known as CP1, on the channel, in Cameron Parish, and is building another in Plaquemines Parish, twenty miles south of New Orleans, where the Gulf meets the Mississippi. Now Venture Global has applied for permits to build CP2, a larger facility adjacent to CP1, which would allow the export of twenty million metric tons of LNG annually. Seven terminals are already up and running in that stretch of the Louisiana coast and in neighboring parts of Texas, such as Port Arthur.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;It&#39;s the greatest LNG boom in history, a feat that is all the more remarkable given that US oil-and-gas exports were essentially nil before 2016, when, just days after the Paris climate negotiations ended, congressional Democrats agreed to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/how-big-oil-and-nancy-pelosi-defeated-the-house-freedom-caucus&quot;>;end the forty-year ban&lt;/a>; on selling American oil abroad in exchange for extending solar- and wind-energy-industry tax credits in an omnibus spending bill.

The US and others met the challenge, exporting fifty-six billion cubic metres to the European Union last year; the Biden Administration has promised another fifty billion this winter. Projects like CP2, though, won&#39;t be done for at least three years, by which time the geopolitical reasoning will presumably have faded, but the infrastructure will linger for decades. The US has now surpassed Russia and Qatar to become the single largest exporter of LNG in the world.&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;And that&#39;s just the beginning.

It&#39;s a kind of math problem, though not a very hard one.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;President Biden has said that he will cut US emissions in half from 2005 levels by 2030; the huge investments in electric vehicles, wind turbines, and the like under the IRA should accomplish a significant fraction of that task. But, at the same time, the Administration has overseen the continued ramp-up of fossil-fuel exports. (Venture Global alone is planning to produce a hundred million metric tons of LNG a year.) The emissions from all that gas don&#39;t officially “count” against the US&#39;s total, because it will be burned elsewhere, and under rules set by the United Nations the country of combustion, not production, is on the hook for it. But the atmosphere doesn&#39;t care where fossil fuel is burned; the resulting carbon dioxide mixes quickly into the atmosphere and raises temperatures everywhere. And, if those emissions are added “into our footprint,” the analyst Jeremy Symons told me recently, “our total emissions in 2030 will be roughly the same as in 2005.” The rules constitute, he said, “the greatest shell game in the history of the world. We&#39;re so focussed on domestic emissions that we&#39;ve missed entirely what&#39;s going on with exports.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Venture Global declined to comment for this piece, but it has said that, in fact, it is cleaning up the world&#39;s energy system, because “with lower cost LNG, more global, growing economies will realize the environmental benefits of clean-burning natural gas.” That is, if developing economies don&#39;t get LNG, they might burn coal instead. So far, the Biden Administration has gone along with this reasoning. The Department of Energy has to grant an export license before gas from the proposed CP2 terminal can be marketed beyond the small list of countries with which the United States has a free-trade agreement. But, to weigh such a decision, the department is still using a Trump-era analysis that simply compares burning natural gas with, say, burning coal, and concludes that the gas will have less impact on the climate. This may or may not be true—DOE officials have avoided a realistic analysis of how much heat-trapping methane is leaked during the fracking process. But, either way, it&#39;s beside the point, because the world, in theory, is no longer aiming for incremental shifts such as moving from coal to gas.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;As the climate crisis has deepened, first scientists and then diplomats have understood that the necessary target is “net zero,” which is why, in 2021, the International Energy Agency declared that, beginning that year, all new investment in fossil-fuel infrastructure should cease. “The pathway to net zero is narrow but still achievable,” the IEA&#39;s Fatih Birol &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/radical-change-needed-reach-net-zero-emissions-iea-2021-05-18/&quot;>;explained&lt;/a>;. “If we want to reach net zero by 2050 we do not need any more investments in new oil, gas and coal projects.” That, clearly, means that we shouldn&#39;t build any new LNG export terminals and that, instead of exporting natural gas, we should be exporting—and helping to pay for—solar farms and wind turbines that can help get us somewhere nearer net zero. As &lt;em>;Scientific American&lt;/em>; reported, the Gulf Coast state of Texas was able to keep its power grid running through this summer&#39;s heat wave precisely because it had built so much solar power and battery capacity.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;ig4cdm&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;ygu61r&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;The United States isn&#39;t the only nation whose fossil-fuel industry is banking on LNG The Oil Change International report put Canada second on its planet-wreckers list, and the government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://climateinstitute.ca/canada-cannot-get-credit-low-carbon-exports/&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://climateinstitute.ca/canada-cannot-get-credit-low-carbon-exports/&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://climateinstitute.ca/canada-cannot-get-credit-low-carbon-exports/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;announced&lt;/a>; recently that it will seek credits toward that country&#39;s emissions targets because “supplying Canadian clean energy such as liquefied natural gas (LNG) that allows other countries to reduce emissions in diesel and coal.” But the argument makes no more sense for Canada than for Cameron Parish; you can&#39;t reduce global warming just by letting someone else burn your fossil fuel. As Symons said, “It&#39;s like you have two kids sharing a room, and you tell them to clean it up. And one just pushes their mess to the other side and you&#39;re, like, &#39;Good job.&#39; ”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Venture Global also says that it will help in the climate fight by deploying “carbon capture” technology at the CP2 site, “compressing CO2 at its sites and then transporting the CO2 and injecting it deep into subsurface saline aquifers where it will be permanently stored.” But that would only capture the carbon produced in the process of liquefying the gas and loading it on ships; it wouldn&#39;t capture any of the far greater amounts of carbon produced when that gas is later burned overseas, or the heat-trapping methane released by the fracking process in the first place. By Symons&#39;s estimate, the scheme will clean up less than one per cent of the mess, and will likely rely on tax credits to do it.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;To the extent that anyone beyond Wall Street has paid much attention to this buildout, it&#39;s been because of the havoc that it is wreaking on some local communities, which, by and large, are poor communities of color. Lylla Younes and Jake Bittle, &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://grist.org/energy/louisiana-liquified-natural-gas-terminal-lng-gulf-coast/&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://grist.org/energy/louisiana-liquified-natural-gas-terminal-lng-gulf-coast/&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://grist.org/energy/louisiana-liquified-natural-gas-terminal-lng-gulf-coast/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;writing in Grist&lt;/a>;, in conjunction with The Lens, described how the new construction in Plaquemines Parish has “transformed the lives of people who have lived in the 23,000-person parish for generations. The streets around the plant became choked with truck traffic, the marsh threaded with pipelines, and the quiet was replaced with the din of construction. Acres of wetland disappeared beneath concrete. The broad ocean skyline of the parish vanished behind a maze of steel.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;As Younes and Bittle reported, the situation in Cameron is at least as grim. John Allaire, a retired manager and engineer at an oil company, bought land there in 1998, when there were a few rigs and oil-storage tanks in the Gulf, but mostly just ponds and cheniere, the local name for the ancient ridges on the ocean-front dunes. If Allaire faces certain directions, he can still see the dunes. “They&#39;re covered with trees—hackberry, live oaks, some holly. Pelicans, great egrets, great blue herons,” he told me, when I spoke with him last month. But, if he looks toward CP1, “at night, it looks like the Vegas strip.” He has been documenting thirty- to seventy-foot flames, “flaring” excess gas from the CP1 smokestack and releasing, according to Grist, “a cocktail of pollutants like carbon monoxide, black carbon, and volatile organic compounds like benzene and formaldehyde.” (Venture Global applied for a state permit in March to increase the amount of pollution it can vent by seventeen per cent, according to records retrieved by the Louisiana Bucket Brigade.) Allaire is now working with staff from Greenpeace, the Natural Resources Defense Council, the Sierra Club, the local chapter of the Audubon Society, and the legal experts at EarthJustice in efforts to block the LNG buildout in the area. Lake Charles, the nearest city, is home to about eighty thousand people, close to half of whom are Black and many of whom are poor.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Travis Dardar is an Indigenous Houma fisherman, who, like many generations of his family before him, grew up on the Isle de Jean Charles, an island off the Louisiana coast that had been inhabited mostly by Native Americans. In 2019, it became the first community in the country to be bought out by the federal government because of climate change; since 1955, it had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/03/us/resettling-the-first-american-climate-refugees.html&quot;>;lost&lt;/a>; ninety per cent of its land to the rising sea, and its residents were designated “climate refugees.” Dardar and his wife bought land in Cameron Parish, which ended up being half a mile from CP1 and three hundred and fifty feet from the proposed fence line for CP2. Venture Global bought them out and, earlier this year, they moved again, inland this time, to Kaplan, Louisiana.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Venture Global describes itself as being “committed to responsible environmental stewardship during all phases of its projects and will work to minimize impacts to the coastal ecosystem of Louisiana, coexisting with the local environment and our communities.” But people in those communities tell stories largely of bewilderment. “When I first moved to Cameron, it was beautiful,” Dardar told me. “When you woke up in the morning, you could hear the waves.” Then one day, “there were hundreds of yellow trucks all over the place.” If you map the project site, he said, “it&#39;s on top of all the fishing grounds where we shrimp and oyster and crab.” The construction, he said, was a day-and-night siege; “they vibrate the pictures right off your wall and they don&#39;t give a damn.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;One would hope that stories like that would be enough to move people across the country. But, so far, it hasn&#39;t. The Gulf South—like the tar-sands country of Alberta, or the coal-seam mountaintops of West Virginia—is being turned into what has been called a “sacrifice zone,” often with the backing of the local power structure and of those hoping for new jobs. The CP2 proposal, for example, was announced in a joint news release from Venture Global executives and the state government. Governor John Bel Edwards, a Democrat, &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://venturegloballng.com/press/venture-global-and-louisiana-governor-john-bel-edwards-announce-proposed-cp2-lng-export-facility/&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://venturegloballng.com/press/venture-global-and-louisiana-governor-john-bel-edwards-announce-proposed-cp2-lng-export-facility/&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://venturegloballng.com/press/venture-global-and-louisiana-governor-john-bel-edwards-announce-proposed-cp2-lng-export-facility/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;said&lt;/a>; that the company “has invested significantly in Louisiana&#39;s economy, and I am proud to celebrate this exciting new project with them. The CP2 facility in Cameron will create more than 1,000 new permanent jobs and thousands of construction jobs in the area, which will have a significant impact on our economy.” (A spokesperson for the governor, in an e-mail, clarified that the more than a thousand jobs refers to “a combined total of direct and indirect jobs,” and added that “Louisiana is the only state in the Gulf South to have adopted a &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://energy.opportunitylouisiana.gov/&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://energy.opportunitylouisiana.gov/&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://energy.opportunitylouisiana.gov/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;Climate Action Plan&lt;/a>;” to achieve “its stated commitment to achieve Net Zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.” To that end, “the state has adopted an &#39;all of the above&#39; energy transition strategy.” ) Meanwhile, the Americas LNG &amp;amp; Gas Summit and Exhibition &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://midstreamcalendar.com/events/19th-americas-lng-gas-summit-exhibition-lake-charles/&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://midstreamcalendar.com/events/19th-americas-lng-gas-summit-exhibition-lake-charles/&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://midstreamcalendar.com/events/19th-americas-lng-gas-summit-exhibition-lake-charles/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;announced&lt;/a>; that this year it will return to the Golden Nugget resort in Lake Charles, with “the continued support and endorsement of our partners—City of Lake Charles, Southwest Louisiana Convention &amp;amp; Visitors Bureau, Port of Lake Charles, Cameron Parish Port, Harbor and Terminal District, Southwest Louisiana Economic Development Alliance, and the police juries of Calcasieu and Cameron parishes.”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;2mxwxk&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;With that kind of regional support, Americans who will never visit the Gulf parishes will have to come to see that they, too, are on the front lines of this fight because of the facilities&#39; projected impact on the climate, a realization that should come easier after this summer&#39;s siege of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/science/elements/life-and-death-in-americas-hottest-city&quot;>;heat waves&lt;/a>;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-local-correspondents/trying-to-breathe-in-a-city-of-smoke&quot;>;smoke&lt;/a>;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/annals-of-a-warming-planet/vermonts-catastrophic-floods-and-the-spread-of-unnatural-disasters&quot;>;floods&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The demand for more sweeping climate action was on display last weekend in New York City, where, according to organizers, seventy-five thousand people marched through the streets. Biden, of course, may fear that if prices at the pump go up between now and next November, he&#39;ll be blamed for it if he has done anything to reduce drilling. The thought may have underlain his decision to support the Willow complex. But, even if you accept that argument, it doesn&#39;t apply to the LNG buildout: that product is for overseas consumption, and the exportation of it will, logically, reduce the supply in the US “If they keep this LNG buildout, your electric bills are going to go way up, and your food costs, too,” Allaire, the oil-industry veteran, said. “Ninety per cent of our fertilizer in the United States is made with natural gas. If the price goes up, because we&#39;re shipping it abroad, well, the price of vegetables goes up, too.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;So the Administration now has to decide whether it wants to play along with the mathematical gamesmanship that surrounds these exports, or whether it&#39;s willing to provide an example of clear climate leadership that could resonate around the world. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission seems almost certain to sign off on CP2 at its next commission meeting, in October; it set the stage for approval in late July, on the ground that “the potential impacts of the project would not significantly affect local resources.” (It did not consider any of the global climate implications.) But the final word will come from the Department of Energy, which has to grant an export license before the LNG from CP2 (and any other such project) can be sold to the European Union nations or in most of Asia; if the department declines to sign off, Venture Global will almost certainly not go ahead with the project. At the moment, the Department of Energy has to certify that such a license would be in “the public interest.” The House GOP is now trying to strip that provision from the Natural Gas Act; the Illinois Democratic congressman Sean Casten &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://twitter.com/seancasten/status/1703794219763077305&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://twitter.com/seancasten/status/1703794219763077305&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/seancasten/status/1703794219763077305&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;tweeted&lt;/a>; on Monday that “they are trying to put the interests of the gas industry above the national interest. We can&#39;t let them.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;There are many parallels here with the fight over the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tag/keystone-xl&quot;>;Keystone XL pipeline&lt;/a>;, another energy boondoggle that most Americans had never heard of when it first became a national issue, in August, 2011—a year before the Obama-Biden team was up for reëlection. That month, activists from the tar-sands region in Canada and the Midwest states that the pipeline would have crossed came together with scientists and activists for a series of protests (I helped organize some of them) that elevated Keystone to a national issue. Within four months, the White House had put a moratorium on the plans; when President Brack Obama eventually rejected the pipeline, it was on the ground that it would make climate change worse.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;On that same ground, CP2 appears at least as obvious a problem. Symons used some Sierra Club data on the terminal&#39;s eventual emissions to compare them with those of the Willow Project. That Alaskan oil field will eventually produce six hundred and twenty-nine million barrels of oil; in the course of an expected thirty-year lifetime, burning that oil would produce about twenty-five thousand metric tons of CO&lt;sub>;2&lt;/sub>; a day. If you add together the CO&lt;sub>;2&lt;/sub>; and the methane that would be released as CP2&#39;s LNG is fracked, shipped, and combusted, it would come to more than half a million metric tons a day.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;But two things have changed since 2011. One is that many environmentalists feel constrained in pushing against the Biden Administration, both because the Inflation Reduction Act established his climate credibility and because they&#39;ve seen what a Trump Administration looks like. Several of the biggest groups—the Sierra Club, the League of Conservation Voters, and others—have already endorsed Biden. The fear of undercutting a Democratic President was a little less intense twelve years ago, because the alternative seemed likely to be someone like the candidate who eventually became the Republican nominee, Mitt Romney, whose &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.romney.senate.gov/romney-we-must-get-serious-about-reducing-global-emissions/&quot;>;rational if not courageous position&lt;/a>; on climate change is far better than those of the GOP candidates who appeared in last month&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vox.com/climate/23815966/republicans-climate-change-denial-trees&quot;>;debate&lt;/a>; or, of course, of the front-runner, who wasn&#39;t there.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The other change, however, is that, in 2011, climate change was only beginning to show its fangs; most of the discussion was still theoretical, cast in the future tense. Now every day seems to bring a new disaster or an extreme-weather record broken, with this year seeing what have likely been the hottest days in more than a hundred thousand years. The list of ironies in the CP2 project is long, but none is clearer than the fact that the Lake Charles region is already an epic victim of the climate crisis, arguably more than anywhere else in the country. In 2005, a few weeks after Hurricane Katrina hit Louisiana, Rita, which began as a Category 5 hurricane, damaged Lake Charles badly. In 2020, Laura, a Category 4 hurricane, crushed the city, which had already been touched that season by the storms Cristobal, Hanna, and Marco, and then, two months later, once the city had got through Sally—and after we&#39;d run out of hurricane names and gone to the Greek alphabet—Hurricane Delta struck. Lake Charles became the blue-tarp capital of the country, with roof after roof blown away. The Golden Nugget survived, but when the attendees gather there for the Americas LNG &amp;amp; Gas Summit and Exhibition, in November, they&#39;ll find themselves in the shadow of the CapitalOne Center—at twenty-two stories the tallest building in Lake Charles, but abandoned since Laura, because the gusts blew out so many of its windows.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;In late August, Biden said that “practically speaking” he had declared a climate emergency. If so, CP2 is a place to prove it: if the federal government were to say no to the plant, it would represent a sea change in government policy. And a sea change is what we need. “If we get another hurricane like Rita, forget it,” Allaire said. “The only things left after that one were the blocks my house was sitting on, and a grate from my refrigerator.” But the more gas we burn the hotter the Gulf will get and the more the sea will rise and warm and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/annals-of-a-warming-planet/hurricane-idalias-explosive-power-comes-from-abnormally-hot-oceans&quot;>;fuel ever-stronger hurricanes&lt;/a>;.
