data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;除其他外，《On the Waterfront》（1954 年）是一个手套故事。在寒冷的一天，在河边散步时，爱娃·玛丽·圣特掉了一只手套。 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1957/11/09/the-duke-in-his-domain&quot;>;马龙·白兰度&lt;/a>;拿起它并穿上它。他打开一块口香糖。过了一会儿，她从他手里扯下了手套。已建立联系。她走过去站在铁栏杆旁。他说：“你不记得我了，是吗？”就在她回答之前，我们听到音乐：木管独奏，单簧管引领。 “我第一眼看到你就想起了你，”她说。弦乐加入木管乐器。白兰度嚼着口香糖，走开，转身，招手，喊道，“来吧&lt;/em>;。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;音乐不引人注目，但又充满浪漫的鼓励，由 &lt;a href= “https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1958/01/11/leonard-bernstein-profile-the-pervasive-musician&quot;>;伦纳德·伯恩斯坦&lt;/a>;。这是他唯一直接为电影创作的配乐。如果他能写更多就好了。 （《小镇上》和《西区故事》从剧院诞生，对许多听众来说，当它们出现在银幕上时，他们就失去了活力。）事实上，考虑到他作为作曲家对美国文化的许多领域的影响、指挥家、讲师、电视节目主持人、作家、纽约客和活动家——伯恩斯坦在电影上留下的痕迹是多么微弱，令人惊讶。也许他有充分的理由担心，电影制作中涉及的妥协比其他地方所造成的妥协更为严重。他最精明的贡献可能是“What a Movie!”，这是一首为他 1952 年的歌剧《Trouble in Tahiti》创作的女中音曲目，片中女主角黛娜嘲笑她刚刚看过的一部电影（“这是多么逃避现实的彩色废话”） ”），尽管如此，她还是被它所提供的热带幻想所吸引。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;现在我们有了一部新的伯恩斯坦传记片“大师”。它的导演是 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-front-row/the-real-subject-of-bradley-coopers-a-star-is-born-is-the- star-power-of-bradley-cooper&quot;>;布莱德利·库珀&lt;/a>;与乔什·辛格一起撰写了剧本，为了增加乐趣，他扮演了伯恩斯坦这个角色。这部电影按时间顺序涵盖了数英里长的内容。我们从年老的伯恩斯坦开始，他身材魁梧，头发雪白，配备了他赖以生存的工具：一架钢琴和一支香烟。 （警告：这部电影中的烟草消费会让你大吃一惊。伯恩斯坦甚至在医生的候诊室里抽烟。）然后，漫长的一跳回到了二十五岁的自己，被一通电话从睡梦中惊醒。 ，1943 年 11 月 14 日，通知他，唉，布鲁诺·沃尔特身体不适，伯恩斯坦在只提前几个小时通知且没有排练的情况下，必须指挥纽约爱乐乐团。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;突然间，我们“正在拍动作片。伯恩斯坦跳了起来，打开窗帘，张开双臂，发出一声期待的喜悦的吼声，就像泰山在丛林中迎接光明的新一天一样。你一半期望他会捶胸顿足。然后摄像机跟踪他跑出房间，沿着走廊跑到卡内基音乐厅的阳台上，下午的音乐会将在那里举行。简而言之，库珀凭借一种大胆的技巧，把他的英雄从床上直接带到了礼堂——根据这部电影，这两个舞台的诱惑是他永远无法抗拒的。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;另一个华丽的表演，在一次阳光明媚的午餐上户外：伯恩斯坦坐在一位女演员费利西亚·蒙特亚莱格雷·科恩（凯瑞·穆里根饰）旁边，他很喜欢她，后来将与她结婚。坐在桌子前面的是俄罗斯出生的指挥家谢尔盖·库塞维茨基（亚森·佩扬科夫饰），他建议伯恩斯坦作为犹太人同胞，将自己的名字改为更容易接受的伯恩斯，并表示他可以成为“第一位伟大的美国指挥家”。 ”。伯恩斯坦承诺放弃“音乐剧的东西”。然而，费利西亚想听听，于是他抓住了她的手，两人粗鲁地冲走，神奇地到达了一个舞台，舞台上正在上演 1944 年杰罗姆·罗宾斯的芭蕾舞剧《自由幻想》，配乐是伯恩斯坦——膨胀为“On the Town”的工作正在进行中。不知何故，两个入侵者被卷入其中。如果您曾经梦想看到布莱德利·库珀穿着水手服，戴着一顶与之相配的小帽子，那么您的机会来了。&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;尽管那个场景中充满了鲁莽的兴奋，但有一种费利西娅刚被拉向她的情人，就被猛地拉走了，这也让她感到不祥的预感。从本质上讲，你就拥有了“大师”。这是一场激情之舞——对库珀来说是一种爱的劳动，同时也展示了一个不友好的事实：爱可以是艰苦的劳动。当费利西亚嫁给伯恩斯坦时，她很清楚他是双性恋。她没有预见到的是，他是多么的贪婪。 “我爱得太深了，我还能说什么？”他自豪而愉快地道歉，电影调查了他无法控制的人周围的爆炸区域。他无法抑制自己欲望的喜悦，就像他无法抑制自己音乐品味的普遍性一样，无论好坏，其他灵魂都会首当其冲。我们看到年长的伯恩斯坦在坦格伍德教一名年轻学生弹奏贝多芬，然后随着恐惧之泪乐队的《呐喊》的重唱而爱抚他。当伯恩斯坦向他的大女儿杰米（由玛雅·霍克饰演）保证，有关他同性恋调情的谣言只是出于嫉妒而煽动时，我们不禁皱起了眉头。公平地说，他是按照费利西亚的指示行事的：“你不敢告诉她真相。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;这里有一些“大师”并不关心的事情。首先，伯恩斯坦的童年和青少年时期。 （除了恋母情结的忏悔：“我曾经梦想过要杀死我的父亲。”）第二，他的政治观点。感谢老天爷，1970 年费利西亚在他们公园大道的公寓里举办了一场聚会，为的是为被监禁的黑豹党成员筹集资金，这场聚会没有被戏剧化，从而引发了汤姆·沃尔夫“激进时尚”的煽动性指控。第三，伯恩斯坦的犹太教信仰，使他成为巴勒斯坦交响乐团、后来的以色列爱乐乐团的掌舵人； 1948 年，在贝尔谢巴，大量军队聚集在一起观看他演奏莫扎特、贝多芬和格什温的作品，以至于头顶上空的埃及飞机报告了一场军事演习。第四，他的教学法，现在回想起来，这似乎是他成就的核心，而不是无关紧要的。没有人能够轻松地掌握在电视摄像机无情的注视下，不高不低地直接向观众讲话的艺术，同时解开一个棘手的话题。去年的《塔尔》中，当失宠的女主人公向伯恩斯坦寻求安慰时，她没有听LP或CD。她选择了他的一场年轻人音乐会，录制在一盘旧录像带上。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;奇怪的是，“大师”并不是真正关于音乐的。 （“&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/10/10/cate-blanchett-is-imperious-and-incandescent-in-tar&quot;>;Tár&lt;/a>; 也不是。 ”）整件事可能都浸透在音乐中，但库珀的灵感与其说是来自声音的创造性来源，不如说是来自声音所流向的情感目的地——即费利西亚。例如，我们在英国伊利大教堂参加了伯恩斯坦对马勒第二交响曲的编排。这个场景是根据 1973 年该事件的录像记录改编的，库珀密切模仿了伯恩斯坦在讲台上的阵发性手势，但请注意最后一个和弦响起后发生的情况：摄像机滑开并停在费利西亚的肩膀上。当她从耳堂观看时，脸上露出欣喜若狂的表情。类似的事情也发生过，在伯恩斯坦的《弥撒》的首映式上，他的调子更低沉、更糟糕，他没有指挥，而是坐在阳台上，坐在他新男友汤米·科斯兰（吉迪恩·格利克饰）和费利西亚之间。她低头看了一眼半明半暗中男人们交缠的双手，看到爱情从她手中溜走。&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/ div>;&lt;div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;费利西亚是我们在《艺术大师》中看到的最后一个角色，片尾字幕中第一位演员的名字是凯瑞·穆里根。这是她的电影，公平地说，库珀知道这一点。她如何能表现出如此自然的甜蜜，没有一丝令人腻味的痕迹，更不用说糊涂了，这让我很困惑。 “你根本不知道你有多需要我，不是吗？”当他们做爱后躺在地板上并徘徊时，费利西亚对伯恩斯坦说道。我在穆里根的微笑中看到了朱莉·安德鲁斯的影子，她既宽容又轻快，而她在费利西亚身上建立的是玫瑰与荆棘的完美比例。因此，这部电影的最佳镜头是一次拍摄的，没有音乐，也没有摄像机的移动。感恩节游行期间，伯恩斯坦先生和夫人在俯瞰中央公园西侧的房间里聊天，只有他们两个人。谈话变得僵硬，变成了机智应答，然后变成了愤怒。 “如果你不小心，你就会成为一个孤独的老女王，”费利西亚哭道。在他们身后，透过窗户，我们看到史努比的巨大脑袋漂浮着。在美国治下的和平中，这里是战争。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;这部电影&lt;em>;确实&lt;/em>;有一个死亡，但我不会透露。可以说，在这之后，一些观众将不得不从电影院的地板上被清理掉。迫在眉睫的痛苦既加剧又得到缓解，不是因为莫扎特或马勒，而是因为看到伯恩斯坦的孩子们在雪莉·埃利斯的《拍手之歌》中嬉闹。这就是“大师”得分的地方。库珀抛弃了徒劳的全面性尝试，他创造了一些像他的主题一样躁动和鲁莽的东西。 （“我总是勉强跟上自己的步伐，”伯恩斯坦曾经说过。）我们来回走动，从黑白的锐利咬合，到伯恩斯坦名声的黎明，再到色彩丰富的讽刺光芒在他晚年、更辉煌、但不那么满足的岁月里；从野心勃勃的狂喜到疲惫不堪的平静。而且，如果伦纳德·伯恩斯坦 (Leonard Bernstein) 从未在好莱坞传记片中饰演柴可夫斯基，并与葛丽泰·嘉宝 (Greta Garbo) 演对手戏，成为这位作曲家的赞助人（1945 年曾认真讨论过这个项目），那么我们也不必哀叹太久。那家伙还有其他事情要做。 ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot;

data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;成千上万的浪漫主义者，被驱赶到沙漠。今年，电视真人秀网络 Bravo 在拉斯维加斯举办了第三届年度粉丝大会 BravoCon，放弃了之前的所在地贾维茨中心，改而采用凯撒论坛的无柱宴会厅。返回的与会者认为凯撒有了巨大的进步。位于纽约市西区高速公路旁的贾维茨的企业营房弥漫着一种灰色的气息，鼓励斗殴、轻微踩踏和紧张饮酒。浴室也不够。 &lt;em>;11 月初，当我在今年的活动中见到一些回国人员时，一些回国人员回忆道，&lt;em>;我们的膀胱都快要爆了&lt;/em>;。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;当 BravoCon 的门票在 7 月份开始销售时，门票就卖光了一天内。为期三天的活动的 VIP 通行证的价格远远超过了一大笔钱，这个价格还不包括在拉斯维加斯期间产生的所有额外费用。与会者为批评的权利付出了代价；这种审视也定义了 Bravo 球迷，他们通常被称为 Bravoholics。 Bravoholic 是一个浪漫主义者，因为她痴迷于 Bravo 提供的奇幻世界，但这并不意味着她不愿意批评该网络。尽管如此，她还是被那种被俘虏和上瘾的感觉所吸引。在凯撒论坛上，上厕所的队伍很顺畅，甚至还有一些由高乐氏 (Clorox) 提供的互动体验，用广告语中的掠夺语言来说，它“占领”了会议上的浴室。洗手间的镜子上，映衬着你宿醉后的倒影，是品牌挪用了一些 Bravo 巨星的口号，主题是人际戏剧“混乱”的双关语。 （《比佛利山庄的真正家庭主妇》中的多丽特·凯姆斯利 (Dorit Kemsley) 的一句公案：“我相信一切都超过了——除了节制。”）&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;浪漫的人不会在门票、酒店、酒店等方面花费数千美元。机票、食物和饮料，因为她想在小便时被催促。一位浪漫主义者接受了 BravoCon 上大量的广告剧院，因为该活动承诺她真正打破第四堵墙。 Bravo 的母公司 NBCUniversal 的高管和当地的粉丝们互相鹦鹉学舌地说：你来 Con 是为了一种精神上的逃避。 BravoCon 是无机企业实体的自然演变。观看真人秀电视时对人类故事的虚拟消费变得暂时且奇怪地是实体的。&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot;

(A refrain I heard from many of the older women was that they did not “normally do this sort of thing.”) A public voyeurism among the same sex is one of the main undercurrents at the conference. It is not uncommon to overhear real-time evaluation of a star&#39;s body, or her makeup, her pores made vulnerable sans the network&#39;s blurred-light cinematography. Straightish women use gay slang to express their appreciation or distaste: one star “served cunt”; another was “beat down.” The medieval ambience of the word “fandom” fails to capture the attractive aspect of Bravo fans, who are not moonstruck lovers of the network&#39;s properties. A Bravoholic is a critic and a judge. She prefers to live outside of the fantasy, as so much pleasure is to be had in her analysis of it. How she watches her stories is a rebuke to the Netflix model of passive viewership. The voyeur at home has always wanted to activate her gifts of judgment—to produce the action, in other words—and at the Con she finds herself “on set.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;There are the Bravoholics, and then there are the Bravolebrities, or the more than hundred and sixty reality stars, on the network&#39;s series. You don&amp;#x27;t have to be a completist to have seen the imprint of their programming, the most recognizable being the “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/the-real-message-of-the-real-housewives&quot;>;Real Housewives&lt;/a>;” and “Below Deck” franchises, and more niche hits, such as “Married to Medicine” and “Southern Charm.” At BravoCon, the stars of these series work, basically, for seventy-two straight hours, showing up for scheduled events. Most are question-and-answer panels, with a vibe similar to the reconnaissance-and-comeuppance dynamic of the “reunion” episode, the coda that comes at the end of each season, when the cast goes meta, reviewing the tape. Nighttime events, most of which cost extra, are campy live tapings that would be repurposed by the network. Soft news might break during a panel or a junket: a divorce, a spinoff, a cross-property feud. But nothing revelatory, as stars have been advised by NBC executives to save the best drama for production. As &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-new-yorker-interview/andy-cohen-still-loves-the-housewives&quot;>;Andy Cohen&lt;/a>;, an executive producer of the “Real Housewives” franchise and the host of the late-night talk show “Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen,” told me, “You don&#39;t need to bleed out there.” “Housewives”—consisting of dozens of shows, including its international series and spinoffs—is the crown jewel of the Bravo empire, and Cohen acts as the daddy figure of the network. At the Con, he is the de-facto master of ceremonies. It is his job to cultivate an atmosphere of risk. “BravoCon needs to feel uncensored and authentic,” he said, “and not like canned television.”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;GenericCallout&quot;>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;GroupCalloutWrapper&quot;>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;A security guard passing by a sign that reads Welcome to Fabulous BRAVOCON Las Vegas with a Wendy&amp;#x27;s fast food chain logo...&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/655650ce063fc65146530cd7/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/DSF-BravoCon-5.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/655650ce063fc65146530cd7/master/w_120,c_limit/DSF-BravoCon-5.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/655650ce063fc65146530cd7/master/w_240,c_limit/DSF-BravoCon-5.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/655650ce063fc65146530cd7/master/w_320,c_limit/DSF-BravoCon-5.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/655650ce063fc65146530cd7/master/w_640,c_limit/DSF-BravoCon-5.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/655650ce063fc65146530cd7/master/w_960,c_limit/DSF-BravoCon-5.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/655650ce063fc65146530cd7/master/w_1280,c_limit/DSF-BravoCon-5.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/655650ce063fc65146530cd7/master/w_1600,c_limit/DSF-BravoCon-5.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;The conference was a flood of advertisement theatre, with many sponsors seemingly hungry to hitch themselves to the conversion of the Bravo viewer into the Bravo customer.&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;A person eats chicken fingers wearing a black tshirt with Luann de Lesseps&amp;#x27;s mug shot printed on it&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/655650c379589eb61eb430b9/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/DSF-BravoCon-6.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/655650c379589eb61eb430b9/master/w_120,c_limit/DSF-BravoCon-6.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/655650c379589eb61eb430b9/master/w_240,c_limit/DSF-BravoCon-6.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/655650c379589eb61eb430b9/master/w_320,c_limit/DSF-BravoCon-6.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/655650c379589eb61eb430b9/master/w_640,c_limit/DSF-BravoCon-6.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/655650c379589eb61eb430b9/master/w_960,c_limit/DSF-BravoCon-6.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/655650c379589eb61eb430b9/master/w_1280,c_limit/DSF-BravoCon-6.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/655650c379589eb61eb430b9/master/w_1600,c_limit/DSF-BravoCon-6.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;An attendee wears a shirt bearing the mug shot of Luann de Lesseps, a former cast member on “The Real Housewives of New York City.”&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;I&#39;d arrived in Vegas for the last day of BravoCon, knowing that the excitement had somewhat dampened, the voices now hoarse. During a cab ride from the airport, I watched a clip of something that had happened the previous day: one Bravolebrity, Brynn Whitfield, a new cast member on the “Real Housewives of New York City” reboot, had a mishap as she was walking to her panel. Her Christian Louboutin heels got stuck in the escalator, and she had gone to her talk barefoot, her heels left behind, like the remnants of a crushed wicked witch. The taxi-driver apologized for the unusual morning traffic. Preparation for the Formula 1 Las Vegas Grand Prix, scheduled for mid-November, snarled Koval Lane, on the way to the Strip. Unions representing thousands of hospitality workers had threatened to strike, jeopardizing millions of dollars in race revenue, if the casino operators did not meet their demands. (The unions and the resorts have since reached a provisional deal.) The transience of the tourist, the intractability of the laborer. In comparison to the Grand Prix, and to the Super Bowl, which will take place at Vegas&#39;s Allegiant Stadium, in February, BravoCon is a modest intrusion.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Bravo itself has been embroiled in a labor dispute of its own. The novelty of the network, once pilloried for the sins of sexism, exploitation, and artlessness, has long dissipated; Bravo is now a synecdoche for a recognizable postmodern entertainment. The company&#39;s retooling of what we know as women&#39;s media has betrayed its ultimate function as a workplace. Bethenny Frankel, a former star of “The Real Housewives of New York City,” has been garnering support for a union, which doesn&#39;t exist for reality-show performers. And so the Con, this year, served double duty: an expensive party, and a distraction from the distraction of a potential uprising.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Labor was on my mind as I approached the Forum. It was the contract workers, hired out to Caesars by event-staffing companies, who greeted me at the entrance, and who provided the first faces of the BravoCon experience—faces, I&#39;d learned, from a contractor who cheerfully violated the no-talking-to-press rule, that had been asked to adopt a cataract of friendly forgettability. Vegas PD officers, avoiding eye contact, briefly upped the anxiety around the reality of mass gathering. I walked to security, where I was asked if I was carrying any knives or guns. Stanchions created separate processing lines for the VIPs and the standard-admission guests. The former got the best seats and the shortest lines. You could also pay for entrance to BravoPalooza, a lounge experience at the Forum, where the miniature burgers and margaritas were free and where one could rub shoulders with the Bravolebrities. The night before I arrived, guests who had either snuck in or paid four hundred and forty-nine dollars had gone to “BravoCon After Dark,” at the &lt;em >;OMNIA&lt;/em>; Nightclub.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;feature-large-callout&quot; >;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;Andy Cohen moving in front of a winter scene wearing dark pants and a cream shirt&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/655650c5419544d45f45df8c/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/DSF-BravoCon-7.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/655650c5419544d45f45df8c/master/w_120,c_limit/DSF-BravoCon-7.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/655650c5419544d45f45df8c/master/w_240,c_limit/DSF-BravoCon-7.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/655650c5419544d45f45df8c/master/w_320,c_limit/DSF-BravoCon-7.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/655650c5419544d45f45df8c/master/w_640,c_limit/DSF-BravoCon-7.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/655650c5419544d45f45df8c/master/w_960,c_limit/DSF-BravoCon-7.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/655650c5419544d45f45df8c/master/w_1280,c_limit/DSF-BravoCon-7.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/655650c5419544d45f45df8c/master/w_1600,c_limit/DSF-BravoCon-7.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;Andy Cohen, the king of Bravo.&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;The Forum gaped at you, a faux Hellenic garage opening on a bleached plaza. You could get your bearings in the anterior outside space, the dining tent, which was empty and a touch dank at nine-thirty in the morning. The lone people buying refrigerated sandwiches there got absorbed into groups. Holly, a former model, who flew in from Canada, reminded me of Margot Robbie-as-Barbie in her baby-pink short-suit set. (It was early in the day, but it was almost seventy degrees outside.) Holly had met about forty Bravo stars at the Con. Would I meet her, that evening, at a live taping of “Bravocon Live with Andy Cohen!” at the Paris Theatre, a five-minute drive from the Forum? Lisa Vanderpump, formerly of “The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills,” now the mother muse of “Vanderpump Rules,” owned a restaurant at the Paris hotel; we&#39;d find plenty of Bravo people posted there. Other fans, I&#39;d learn, had found canny unofficial ways to come into contact with their chosen divas. You&#39;d waste time waiting on a photo-op line for Karen Huger, the Grande Dame of Potomac. Better to stomp strategically around the peripheries of the Con, where black cars rolled up to the VIP entrance, or to abandon the Caesars complex altogether for the Four Seasons. (Uber drivers had let slip that many of the stars were staying there.)&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;This was not gauche behavior. Fame here leaves the Hollywood model of oversaturation through mystery and distance. This is oversaturation through oversaturation. A Bravolebrity&#39;s identity has at the forefront, regardless of personal net worth, the status of employee, one that is not forever. And it is the fans, not the parent company, that gives them this sense of existential employment. Cohen told me that he had felt “territorial” when an entertainment blog reported on a fan-produced podcast, some years ago. Since then, a secondary industry has ballooned of self-identified content creators, many of whom support themselves entirely through their cultural-digest shows. The network depends on their output, Sarah Galli, of the long-running podcast “Andy&#39;s Girls,” told me, as such creators keep the show going well after an episode has aired. At the Con, some were as famous as the Bravo stars themselves, their presence causing mini-floods.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;GenericCallout&quot;>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;Teresa Giudice taking photos with fans at BravoCon.

A playground opened before me, inside the Forum, its energy a mash between an industry Upfront event and a booze cruise. There was the Bravoland museum displaying iconic artifacts from classic seasons: a set table that had been flipped in fury, hot tubs from a spa day gone bad. Interactive booths allowed fans to film their own “confessionals,” the interviews where producers prod stars for critical asides. If you looked lost, pacing the massive carpeted hallways of the Forum, a man might blow a kazoo in your face, bidding you to buy themed apparel. When it came to dress, among the streaming fans there were two schools of presentation: relaxed, sensible shoes, possibly sporting a “Bravo Lovin&#39; Bitches” T-shirt, and then conspicuously glammed, as if wearing Housewives drag. The glam girls tended to end up at BravoPalooza, where they could socialize with stars as pseudo equals. And aren&#39;t they, if not equals, then at least in a symbiotic state of being?&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;tehcyt&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;I entered a crepuscular, enormous space called the Gold Room. Catercornered to the bar was an immersive living room sponsored by Wayfair, a re-creation of the winter opulence of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/02/15/the-real-housewives-of-salt-lake-city-is-culturally-sensitive-trash&quot;>;Salt Lake City “Housewives”&lt;/a>; franchise. Wordlessly, a BravoCon worker gestured toward their chest and handed me a package of breast-lifting tape, gratis. Only about half the room filled up for the first program of the day, “Pat the Puss with Erika Jayne,” a dance class which was itself an advertisement for a spinoff for the Beverly Hills Housewife which would première next year, about her Vegas residency. With her lion mane and second-skin catsuit, Jayne, who tries hard to affect pitiless self-interest on the series, seemed smaller, near to sweet. She made sense only blown up on the enormous screen hung above her from the ceiling, her real environment. Its light gave her her harshness.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The fans brought up onstage to learn choreography with Jayne were happy and pliant. At other programs, the audience response was vitriolic. A known philanderer from “Vanderpump Rules,” Tom Sandoval, was booed each time he opened his mouth; Jennifer Aydin, from the New Jersey “Housewives” series, was asked by a fan, during the Q. &amp;amp; A. portion, when she&#39;d stop crawling up the asshole of her castmate. A peculiar contract of reciprocity becomes live at the conference. Dislike counts as popularity. I met two sisters, Stacey and Renée, from Colorado, co-owners of an Orangetheory fitness. They identified as the sort of fans who had too much self-regard to take selfies with stars. They had tough words for Teresa Giuidice, a New Jersey OG who had returned to the fore after serving time in prison. “I&#39;ll be honest with you, they shouldn&#39;t have brought her back,” Stacey said. “She broke the law.” At one panel, Giuidice shrugged off boos.

I learned a word in Las Vegas: “shoptainment.” At the Bazaar, there were more than fifty booths one could browse, the majority dedicated to the stars&#39; businesses. (Some were tied to story lines, like “SHE by Sherée,” the beleaguered clothing line launched by the “Real Housewives of Atlanta” anchor, Shereé Whitfield.) Periodically, stars came out to personally hawk their products. Two Bravoholics, Sara and Summer, best friends from San Diego, talked of the “parasocial” draw they felt toward Sandoval, who was taking pictures near his eponymously named booth. They were, in their early twenties, experts at analyzing the psychology of pop-cultural product. “I do not talk highly of that man, not one bit,” Sara said, of Sandoval. “But here I am in line to wait.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Men are simpler creatures when it comes to advertisement. “It&#39;s harder to get women to wait on line for &lt;em>;x&lt;/em>; amount of minutes to meet Craig Conover to buy his pillows,” an NBC ad executive told me. The Bazaar fomented the hot sororal atmosphere that leads a visitor to make claims about the American woman consumer substantiated only by anecdote. Sellers drew you in using irony, flirtation, embarrassment. Being advertised to is an experience of being noticed. The employee at the Juvéderm booth, a company that sells fillers, asked for customers&#39; names, and then shouted at them as they gamed the claw machine. Predictably, the beauty industry had sent its emissaries—Ulta was a sponsoring partner—but the tell was in sponsor companies like Lay&#39;s, the aforementioned Clorox, and State Farm Insurance (the actor who plays Jake in the commercials acted as beefcake at one booth), which were hungry to hitch themselves to the conversion of the Bravo viewer into the Bravo customer.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;GenericCallout&quot;>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;GroupCalloutWrapper&quot;>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;Two champagne flutes on the ground in front of a person sitting in a chair wearing white cowboy boots.&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/655650c60ce38a9b9c5bdad8/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/DSF-BravoCon-12.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/655650c60ce38a9b9c5bdad8/master/w_120,c_limit/DSF-BravoCon-12.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/655650c60ce38a9b9c5bdad8/master/w_240,c_limit/DSF-BravoCon-12.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/655650c60ce38a9b9c5bdad8/master/w_320,c_limit/DSF-BravoCon-12.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/655650c60ce38a9b9c5bdad8/master/w_640,c_limit/DSF-BravoCon-12.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/655650c60ce38a9b9c5bdad8/master/w_960,c_limit/DSF-BravoCon-12.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/655650c60ce38a9b9c5bdad8/master/w_1280,c_limit/DSF-BravoCon-12.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/655650c60ce38a9b9c5bdad8/master/w_1600,c_limit/DSF-BravoCon-12.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;Two people stand side by side with arms around each other.

The waiter refused to give me the meal, insisting it was disgusting, and suggested I eat two cartons of mixed fruit instead. As I plodded back toward the Sandoval zone, a Black woman of about seventy years grabbed me by the shoulders, nearly shaking the fruit out of my hands. Did I know where the panel with Vicki Gunvalson, part of the inaugural cast of “The Real Housewives of Orange County,” the début series in the franchise, would be? The woman had been brought to BravoCon by her daughter, who didn&#39;t watch reality television herself. She had been a widow for eight years, and yet the absence still felt new. “It takes you away sometimes,” she said, of Bravo, showing me selfies she had taken with the cast of “Summer House: Martha&#39;s Vineyard,” a new anatomy of Black social life on the island. She detected a humility on “Summer House” that she found refreshing. Whereas on “Housewives,” she said, “It aggravates me the way they don&#39;t appreciate what they have, because a lot of them are childish. It&#39;s humorous,” she continued. “It&#39;s sad.”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;jaed7p&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;The woman left to find her daughter. I wandered up the stairs for “Housewife2Housewife: Day One Divas,” hoping to find her again. I wanted to hear more of her thoughts on the racial tropes that reality television subverts, those of the “Black bitch,” and “white women fighting.” I never found her, but I did meet a nurse practitioner, who was waiting for a friend to join her in line for the panel. As we moved through the stanchions, the nurse explained that she and her friend, who work at the same clinic, had been ghettoized by their colleagues for their interest in Bravo, which had seemed, to some snobs, beneath their intelligence. I&#39;d have thought this argument to be passé. What is interesting about Bravo is that love for its programming has created snobs of its own. There was no bottom to conversation, I found, with the fans I talked to, who iterated with total fluency on the performance of womanhood.

The reporter outlined displeasure with labor practices from former Bravo employees, some of whom felt that the show&#39;s emphasis on alcohol and fighting created an unsafe environment. The report had led to the banishment of Ramona Singer, a long-running figure in the Bravo behemoth, from the conference, after she was exposed for allegedly using a racial slur. (She has denied this.) But, otherwise, the Con betrayed little in the way of moral outrage. Bravo metabolizes offense. Emily D. Baker, a Los Angeles lawyer who has found so much success as a YouTube commentator that she abandoned her legal-consulting practice, was expecting more of the Bravo stars she talked with in Las Vegas to “give more of a shit” about the issues raised in the article. “They talked about their own behavior on the show, their own autonomy, and how they choose to engage with Bravo,” she said. “I was surprised by that.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;My night ended with a taping of “Bravocon Live with Andy Cohen! The Reading Room,” at the Paris. I recognized Holly&#39;s blond pate from afar but lost her in the fray outside the Vanderpump restaurant. Cohen pranced onstage, with a selection of Housewives close behind him, and then we started taping a game called “Squash That Beef,” a riotous fan favorite. Two randomly selected stars are put in the hot seat. Their bad blood is brought up, and they have the option to dig in or move on. The event&#39;s hype woman had been stern about being quiet once the cameras started rolling. But one defensive monologue drove an audience member, a woman in a moto jacket, to true annoyance.

Every year, families and churches bring out elaborate figures made of terra-cotta, wood, and fabric, which depict not just the Nativity but scenes from daily life. The Met&#39;s beautiful and expansive Baroque Neapolitan crèche, arrayed around a twenty-foot blue spruce, includes shepherds and their flocks, merchants toting baskets overflowing with wax fruit, the three kings on horseback, and dozens of angels, wings outstretched, silk robes billowing in an imaginary breeze. &lt;em>;(Metropolitan Museum of Art; Nov. 21-Jan. 7.)&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>;&lt;hr />;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;“George Balanchine&#39;s The Nutcracker”&lt;/strong>;&lt;br/>;We may be cynical about the never-ending loop of the Waltz of the Snowflakes piped in over shopping-mall speakers, but at New York City Ballet, when the baton cues the start of the overture to Tchaikovsky&#39;s “The Nutcracker,” a feeling of anticipation never fails to take hold. Tchaikovsky understood something about the slightly out-of-control feeling of being a child—not ever quite sure what will happen next—as did George Balanchine, whose 1954 ballet, still going strong, veers from the domestic to the surreal in just a few bars of music. Case in point: that gigantic tree, which grows and grows, out of all proportion, until its tip disappears out of sight. &lt;em>;(David H.

The a-cappella ensemble Chanticleer&#39;s twelve members wrap their refined voices around Renaissance-era antiphons, traditional fare such as “Coventry Carol,” and songs from the films “White Christmas” and “The Snowman” (Church of St. Ignatius Loyola; Dec. 1 and Dec. 3). The pure-toned boys&#39; choir of St. Thomas Church, joined by a string ensemble from the Juilliard School, sticks to sacred music (Dec. 14), and the Dessoff Choirs, at various venues, highlight Black composers, including R. Nathaniel Dett, Florence Price, and Margaret Bonds, in “Welcome Yule” (Dec. 2-3).&lt;/p>;&lt;hr />;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;“YLT Hanukkah 2023”&lt;/strong>;&lt;br/>;In what is becoming a wondrous holiday tradition in New York, Yo La Tengo takes over Bowery Ballroom for all eight nights of Hanukkah. The prolific band duct-tapes an electric menorah to the bass amp and plays a brand-new set every show. They are joined by a surprise comic and opening band every time, and each gig&#39;s proceeds go to a different charity. &lt;em>;(Bowery Ballroom; Dec. 7-14.)&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>;&lt;hr />;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;Jingle Ball&lt;/strong>;&lt;br/>;This concert, which originated as a special event put on by the New York radio station Z100, has grown into an annual holiday series gathering some of the biggest names in popular music. The 2023 edition of iHeartRadio&#39;s Jingle Ball tour returns with performances by the former Disney stars Olivia Rodrigo and Sabrina Carpenter, the lovelorn R. &amp;amp; B. visionary SZA, the audacious Top Dawg rapper Doechii, and, a staple of the festive season, the a-cappella group Pentatonix. &lt;em>;(Madison Square Garden; Dec. 8.)&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>;&lt;hr />;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;“Peter &amp;amp; the Wolf”&lt;/strong>;&lt;br/>;If tales about children who outwit the dangers of the big bad world are your idea of holiday fun, look no further than Isaac Mizrahi&#39;s interpretation of Sergei Prokofiev&#39;s musical tale “Peter &amp;amp; the Wolf,” for “Works &amp;amp; Process.” Prokofiev cleverly combined storytelling with the agenda of introducing children to the instruments of the orchestra. The cat is a clarinet, the duck an oboe, and brave Peter the strings. The wry Mizrahi narrates; Ensemble Connect performs Prokofiev&#39;s score; and a small ensemble of dancers perform choreography by John Heginbotham. &lt;em>;(Guggenheim Museum; Dec. 8-10.)&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>;&lt;hr />;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;GenericCallout&quot;>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;An illustration of three books on a windowsill with an eye and a cloud appearing through the window.&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6157515944c2c34f05cd7b4d/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Daily-Spot-Books.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6157515944c2c34f05cd7b4d/master/w_120,c_limit/Daily-Spot-Books.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6157515944c2c34f05cd7b4d/master/w_240,c_limit/Daily-Spot-Books.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6157515944c2c34f05cd7b4d/master/w_320,c_limit/Daily-Spot-Books.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6157515944c2c34f05cd7b4d/master/w_640,c_limit/Daily-Spot-Books.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6157515944c2c34f05cd7b4d/master/w_960,c_limit/Daily-Spot-Books.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6157515944c2c34f05cd7b4d/master/w_1280,c_limit/Daily-Spot-Books.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6157515944c2c34f05cd7b4d/master/w_1600,c_limit/Daily-Spot-Books.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;Morgan Library &amp;amp; Museum Winter Family Fair&lt;/strong>;&lt;br/>;“There is nothing in the world so irresistibly contagious as laughter and good-humour,” Charles Dickens wrote in “A Christmas Carol.” The vaudevillians of the Grand Falloons theatre troupe will test this proposition at the Morgan, on Dec. 10, as they perform a thirty-minute précis of the Dickens tale. (Jugglers, carollers, and magicians will also be on hand.) The original manuscript is on display for the season (through Jan. 7), as it is every year—this time open to a page on which Dickens describes the hustle and bustle of smoggy Victorian London. &lt;em>;(Morgan Library &amp;amp; Museum; Dec. 10.)&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>;&lt;hr />;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;“Holiday Brass”&lt;/strong>;&lt;br/>;The New York Philharmonic does a creditable job with the Baroque finery of Handel&#39;s “Messiah,” which is conducted this year by Fabio Biondi (Dec. 12-16), but the orchestra sounds more at home with the extroverted jubilations of its annual “Holiday Brass” program. Seasonal carols get a resplendent, dopamine-boosting sheen courtesy of the Phil&#39;s trumpets, horns, trombones, and tubas. &lt;em>;(David Geffen Hall; Dec. 16-17.)&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>;&lt;hr />;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;“Messiah”&lt;/strong>;&lt;br/>;Trinity Church Wall Street&#39;s “Messiah” combines sprightly Handelian style with a spirit of community in a vaulting Gothic Revival church. Despite the high musical values, there&#39;s no putting on airs: the choir&#39;s singers, some of their voices more finished than others, take turns stepping forward from the ensemble for the exquisite solos (Dec. 13-15). Uptown, the conductor Kent Tritle brings two different “Messiah”s—one with the Oratorio Society of New York (Dec. 18) and another with Musica Sacra (Dec. 20)—to the soft-gold environs of Carnegie Hall.&lt;/p>;&lt;hr />;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;“Unsilent Night”&lt;/strong>;&lt;br/>;Every winter since 1992, the composer and sound artist Phil Kline has put on “Unsilent Night,” a performance-art piece that began in Greenwich Village and has since spread across the world. Open to anyone willing to participate, every procession makes unique ambient music from a set of four audio recordings that “carollers” play simultaneously. On Dec. 17, Kline leads participants, armed with boom boxes (and cell phones), along a fixed course through the city, from Washington Square Park to the East Village, jingling all the way. &lt;em>;(Begins by the arch of Washington Square Park; Dec. 17 at 6.)&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 17 Nov 2023 19:06:01 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Shifting Sympathies in “Spain”]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.newyorker.com/culture/goings-on/shifting-sympathies-in-spain]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-17T11:00:00.000Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6553a3db23380cc0ddaa2d97/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/231127_r43408.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;article >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attribute-verso-pattern=&quot;article-body&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;ArticlePageChunks&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/contributors/rachel-syme&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Rachel Syme&lt;/strong>;&lt;/a>;&lt;br/>;Staff writer&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;external-link-embed--inline&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;a aria-label=&quot;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;You&#39;re reading the Goings On newsletter, a guide to what we&#39;re watching, listening to, and doing this week. &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Sign up to receive it in your in-box.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://newyorker.com/newsletter/goings-on&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://newyorker.com/newsletter/goings-on&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;&lt;span >;&lt;em>;You&#39;re reading the Goings On newsletter, a guide to what we&#39;re watching, listening to, and doing this week. &lt;strong>;Sign up to receive it in your in-box.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/em>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/a>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;The actress Jo Van Fleet&lt;/strong>; was around forty years old when she made her film début, in Elia Kazan&#39;s “East of Eden,” in 1955, and won an Oscar for it. Even now, such a late entrée into the cinematic pantheon would be a coup; back then, it was considered practically magic. But what lent weight to Van Fleet&#39;s first film performance, as the surly madam of a Salinas Valley bordello who abandoned her children to pursue her own freedom, was the very fact that she was &lt;em>;not&lt;/em>; a naïf when she stepped in front of the camera. Before she was a movie star, she&#39;d had a whole other life. Van Fleet was born in Oakland, California, and began her theatre studies at the College of the Pacific. She did not make her stage début until 1944, when she played Miss Phipps in “Uncle Harry.” But she quickly worked her way from the regional circuit to Shakespeare roles on Broadway; her first was Dorcas in “The Winter&#39;s Tale.” In 1954, the year before she made the transition to movies, she won a Tony Award for playing a resentful matriarch in Horton Foote&#39;s “The Trip to Bountiful.” This is all to say: she was ready to meet her moment.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;GenericCallout&quot;>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;A scene of East of Eden showing three actors Richard Davalos James Dean Jo Van Fleet&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6553a8d525e54787df41ab34/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/MBDEAOF_EC103_resized.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6553a8d525e54787df41ab34/master/w_120,c_limit/MBDEAOF_EC103_resized.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6553a8d525e54787df41ab34/master/w_240,c_limit/MBDEAOF_EC103_resized.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6553a8d525e54787df41ab34/master/w_320,c_limit/MBDEAOF_EC103_resized.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6553a8d525e54787df41ab34/master/w_640,c_limit/MBDEAOF_EC103_resized.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6553a8d525e54787df41ab34/master/w_960,c_limit/MBDEAOF_EC103_resized.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6553a8d525e54787df41ab34/master/w_1280,c_limit/MBDEAOF_EC103_resized.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6553a8d525e54787df41ab34/master/w_1600,c_limit/MBDEAOF_EC103_resized.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;“East of Eden”&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Photograph courtesy Everett Collection&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Now, at Metrograph, you can make your way through Van Fleet&#39;s IMDb page with &lt;strong>;“Also Starring . 。 。 Jo Van Fleet,”&lt;/strong>; running from Nov. 17 through Dec. 9. The series, which draws its cheeky title from Van Fleet&#39;s résumé as a perpetual supporting actress, includes Kazan&#39;s “East of Eden” and one of his later works, “Wild River,” along with Stuart Rosenberg&#39;s “Cool Hand Luke,” John Sturges&#39;s “Gunfight at the OK Corral,” and Daniel Mann&#39;s adaptation of Tennesee Williams&#39;s “The Rose Tattoo.” Van Fleet was called upon to play one type of character—a steely, irascible woman with a perpetual scowl on her face—but by tracing her varied filmography you can cover quite the gamut of mid-century moviemaking. Van Fleet allegedly grew bitter in her older years, grumbling that she had been typecast and was never given a true chance to shine, but this glittering collection of films proves otherwise. The headline of Van Fleet&#39;s &lt;em>;Times&lt;/em>; obituary, from 1996, read that she played “proud women,” and this is the kind of movie series that would make a woman proud.&lt;/p>;&lt;hr />;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;align-center&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:align-center&quot;>;&lt;h2 >;Spotlight&lt;/h2>;&lt;/inline-embed>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;GenericCallout&quot;>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;Shifting Sympathies in “Spain”&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6553a3db23380cc0ddaa2d97/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/231127_r43408.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6553a3db23380cc0ddaa2d97/master/w_120,c_limit/231127_r43408.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6553a3db23380cc0ddaa2d97/master/w_240,c_limit/231127_r43408.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6553a3db23380cc0ddaa2d97/master/w_320,c_limit/231127_r43408.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6553a3db23380cc0ddaa2d97/master/w_640,c_limit/231127_r43408.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6553a3db23380cc0ddaa2d97/master/w_960,c_limit/231127_r43408.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6553a3db23380cc0ddaa2d97/master/w_1280,c_limit/231127_r43408.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6553a3db23380cc0ddaa2d97/master/w_1600,c_limit/231127_r43408.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;Photograph by Todd Midler for The New Yorker&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;heading&quot; aria-level=&quot;6&quot; >;Off Broadway&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;In Jen Silverman&#39;s &lt;strong>;“Spain”&lt;/strong>; (at Second Stage), the elegant performers Marin Ireland and Andrew Burnap—two experts at seeming torn from another time—take us back to 1936, when filmmakers, attempting to do good, make a propaganda film to shift US sympathies toward anti-Fascist freedom fighters. Joseph Stalin happens to be funding their movie, a fact that unbalances their moral calculus. The idea that art might be a cat&#39;s-paw was also crucial to Silverman&#39;s superb novel “We Play Ourselves,” in which a disaffected theatre artist joins a charismatic documentarian&#39;s circle in Los Angeles. What roles do we devise, and at whose invisible command? The camera lens, Silverman tells us, is a mirror, too.—&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/contributors/helen-shaw&quot;>;&lt;em>;Helen Shaw&lt;/em>;&lt;/a>;&lt;/p>;&lt;hr />;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;GenericCallout&quot;>;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;An illustration of the New York City skyline.&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64ad7fea3f0ea61101b7b5aa/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/header-2023.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64ad7fea3f0ea61101b7b5aa/master/w_120,c_limit/header-2023.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64ad7fea3f0ea61101b7b5aa/master/w_240,c_limit/header-2023.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64ad7fea3f0ea61101b7b5aa/master/w_320,c_limit/header-2023.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64ad7fea3f0ea61101b7b5aa/master/w_640,c_limit/header-2023.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64ad7fea3f0ea61101b7b5aa/master/w_960,c_limit/header-2023.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64ad7fea3f0ea61101b7b5aa/master/w_1280,c_limit/header-2023.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64ad7fea3f0ea61101b7b5aa/master/w_1600,c_limit/header-2023.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/div>;&lt;inline-embed name=&quot;align-center&quot; attrs=&quot;[object Object]&quot; childTypes=&quot;&quot; contentType=&quot;callout:align-center&quot;>;&lt;h2 >;About Town&lt;/h2>;&lt;/inline-embed>;&lt;div role=&quot;heading&quot; aria-level=&quot;6&quot; >;Television&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;3c7dvc&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;In the new Showtime black comedy &lt;strong>;“The Curse,”&lt;/strong>; Whitney Siegel (Emma Stone), an aspiring property developer, views her ultra-sustainable bungalows as works of art, but the buildings are an expensive vanity project, and she and her husband, Asher (Nathan Fielder), think that hosting an HGTV series will solve their various problems. Ever mindful of optics, they foreground support for the community and dutiful efforts to offset gentrification; their producer, Dougie (Benny Safdie), would prefer to mine the conflict between his two “characters.” For a series with such naked thematic ambitions, “The Curse” proves surprisingly moving, largely owing to the depth of feeling that Asher reveals as his marriage disintegrates.

The quintet is expected to perform parts of its new album, “Collective Wisdom,” including “Mangas,” by Curtis and Elektra Stewart, which riffs on Greek folk dances, and “Apartments,” by Jackson Greenberg, in which found audio melds with smoky improvisations. The recording also features music by Komitas, a priest, composer, and ethnomusicologist who fell victim to the Armenian genocide.

Lucinda Childs, among those who established the conventions of dancing to Glass in the seventies, sets the standard.

Their glamour made a deep impression on music everywhere, but oddly the musical itself undercuts their triumphs. Ominous images on the set&#39;s plastic walls, thinly imagined characters, messy storytelling, and an on-the-verge-of-tears narration (by the Broadway treasure Chip Zien, giving more than his all) contribute to the minor-key flatness of the director Warren Carlyle&#39;s production. It is only when the cast is unleashed, as they are in some all-too-rare comedy numbers, that we sense the singers&#39; hard-won artistry and fellowship—twin forces that momentarily hold back history&#39;s bleak tide.—&lt;em>;Helen Shaw (Barrymore Theatre; open run.)&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>;&lt;hr />;&lt;div role=&quot;heading&quot; aria-level=&quot;6&quot; >;Movies&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;56yc8q&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;figure >;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;A man working in a cheese cellar room in a scene of MenusPlaisirs Les Troisgros&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6553c07729cef0a393c68d52/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/4_resized.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6553c07729cef0a393c68d52/master/w_120,c_limit/4_resized.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6553c07729cef0a393c68d52/master/w_240,c_limit/4_resized.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6553c07729cef0a393c68d52/master/w_320,c_limit/4_resized.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6553c07729cef0a393c68d52/master/w_640,c_limit/4_resized.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6553c07729cef0a393c68d52/master/w_960,c_limit/4_resized.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6553c07729cef0a393c68d52/master/w_1280,c_limit/4_resized.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6553c07729cef0a393c68d52/master/w_1600,c_limit/4_resized.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;A man working in a cheese cellar room in a scene of &amp;quot;Menus-Plaisirs, Les Troisgros&amp;quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Photograph courtesy Zipporah Films&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;p >;The nonagenarian documentarian Frederick Wiseman has made more than forty films analyzing a broad range of social institutions. His latest, &lt;strong>;“Menus-Plaisirs—Les Troisgros,”&lt;/strong>; is centered on a venerable restaurant in rural France, run by the chefs Michel Troisgros and his sons, which provides diners with the high-priced “little pleasures” of the title. The restaurant emphasizes local food and wine (the movie includes fascinating visits to farmers and artisans), and the chefs work their wonders in a wide-open kitchen that resembles a laboratory, an operating room, and an artist&#39;s studio. The display of culinary luxuries may seem absurd, but it unites mighty currents of tradition, experience, scientific knowledge, administrative smarts, and creative passion; Wiseman depicts in action the agricultural basis of the word “culture.”—&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/contributors/richard-brody&quot;>;&lt;em>;Richard Brody&lt;/em>;&lt;/a>; &lt;em>;(Opening Nov. 22 at Film Forum.)&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>;&lt;hr />;&lt;div role=&quot;heading&quot; aria-level=&quot;6&quot; >;Electronic Rock&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;In 2021, the electronic-rock band &lt;strong>;LCD Soundsystem&lt;/strong>; returned from a three-year hiatus with a planned twenty-show residency at Brooklyn Steel, a homecoming that was disrupted by &lt;em >;COVID&lt;/em>;. In the mid-two-thousands and early twenty-tens, the group, led by the singer James Murphy, created some of the most compelling indie-literate dance music ever—“Sound of Silver,” from 2007, demonstrated Murphy&#39;s indiscriminate yet distinguished musical appetite, and “This Is Happening,” from 2010, expanded into groovy art rock. A breakup and a reunion later, the 2017 album “American Dream” scored multiple Grammy nods before the group went dormant again. LCD carries on a now-yearly ritual at Brooklyn Steel with another string of shows, then its Tri Boro Tour heads to Manhattan for the second leg.—&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/contributors/sheldon-pearce&quot;>;&lt;em>;Sheldon Pearce&lt;/em>;&lt;/a>; &lt;em>;(Terminal 5; Nov. 28-Dec. 1.)&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>;&lt;hr />;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;PS Good stuff on the Internet:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;ul >;&lt;li>;&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://internetprincess.substack.com/p/the-ultimate-internet-princess-extended&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://internetprincess.substack.com/p/the-ultimate-internet-princess-extended&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://internetprincess.substack.com/p/the-ultimate-internet-princess-extended&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;The Ultimate Internet Princess Extended Universe Gift Guide&lt;/a>;&lt;/li>;&lt;li>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/poems/161319/jarrett-moseley&quot;>;“Jarrett Moseley,” by Jarrett Moseley&lt;/a>;&lt;/li>;&lt;li>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.outsideonline.com/adventure-travel/essays/adventure-cats/&quot;>;Adventure cats&lt;/a>;&lt;/li>;&lt;/ul>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 17 Nov 2023 19:06:01 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Grief and Comedy Come Together in “Knight of Fortune”]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.newyorker.com/culture/screening-room/grief-and-comedy-come-together-in-knight-of-fortune]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-17T11:00:00.000Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65562ac7de6b68b0d193548b/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/KnightOfFortune_thumb1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;article >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attribute-verso-pattern=&quot;article-body&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;ArticlePageChunks&quot; >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;feature-large-callout&quot; >;&lt;figure >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;script-container&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;p>;Noer says the idea for the film came from his experiences in saying goodbye to several loved ones.&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;In his directorial and writing début, the short film “Knight of Fortune,” the filmmaker Lasse Lyskjær Noer went to an uncomfortable place, literally. “That place, man ...

The only warmth comes from what you, your family and friends bring in with them,” he wrote me in an e-mail, describing the setting of his film: a morgue.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Noer takes a personal—at times cringe-inducing—approach to telling the story of an aging man, Karl Bergström, who is tasked with facing and accepting the death of a loved one. Karl is visiting the morgue, alone, to claim the body of his wife. The flickering of a hanging fluorescent light, which accentuates a dimmed, claustrophobic setting, provides Karl with the perfect distraction; to delay opening his wife&#39;s coffin, he offers to fix it. An attendant politely declines. Of course, the moment the man leaves, Karl starts fiddling with the light, causing one of the few sources of light in the shadowy room to hang askew. “The setting had to be this dark, claustrophobic place with a blue and green vibe to it—something you couldn&#39;t just shake off. And the characters had to embody the only warmth and light,” Noer says.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;GenericCallout&quot;>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;external-link-embed--inline&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;a aria-label=&quot;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;The New Yorker Documentary&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-new-yorker-documentary/watch-the-new-yorker-documentary&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-new-yorker-documentary/watch-the-new-yorker-documentary&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;&lt;span >;&lt;strong>;The New Yorker Documentary&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/a>;&lt;p >;&lt;em>;View the latest or submit your own film.&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;a aria-label=&quot;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;The New Yorker Documentary&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-new-yorker-documentary/watch-the-new-yorker-documentary&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-new-yorker-documentary/watch-the-new-yorker-documentary&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;&lt;picture >;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5daf63ccaae3dd0008e7fd38/1:1/w_200%2Cc_limit/undefined&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5daf63ccaae3dd0008e7fd38/1:1/w_120,c_limit/undefined 120w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;/>;&lt;/picture>;&lt;/a>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Noer, a graduate of the Film and Photo School of Copenhagen whose previous work includes commercials and music videos, said the idea for the film came from his experiences in saying goodbye to several loved ones the same way.

Karl, who has taken refuge in a stall to cry in private, is interrupted by the voice next door asking for toilet paper. That request gives the visibly grief-stricken Torben the chance to ask for something else: he doesn&#39;t want to go on his own to view his own deceased wife, and asks Karl to come with him. At Torben&#39;s pleading insistence, Karl joins him, and their teaming up pushes the story forward, and pushes Karl himself beyond the boundaries of personal comfort. The result unfolds into both an emotional revelation and a moment of dark, dry comedy.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Laughing in the face of awkwardness or pain is this divine coping mechanism that diffuses tension, allowing us to step back from the discomfort of the moment,” Noer told me. He wanted to make a film that depicted a “shared humanity in finding humor even in the midst of the most challenging situations.” “Knight of Fortune” shows that in sharing the most intimate and often frightening moments with one another, people in mourning can take solace in one another, and maybe even laugh.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 17 Nov 2023 19:06:01 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Why Are Millennials Still Attached to American Girl?]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.newyorker.com/books/under-review/why-are-millennials-still-attached-to-american-girl]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-17T11:00:00.000Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6554f1ed58cb3110f8305f2f/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Feidelson_American_Girl.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;article >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attribute-verso-pattern=&quot;article-body&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;ArticlePageChunks&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;The American Girl doll was invented in the nineteen-eighties by an enterprising former grade-school teacher and news anchor in her mid-forties named Pleasant Rowland, during a visit to Colonial Williamsburg. Rowland was also a successful author of textbooks and other educational materials, and wanted to capitalize on what seemed to her to be the obvious draw of historically accurate, immersive play. Missing from the Barbie-and-baby-doll eighties play landscape, she also noticed, was a doll for little girls who was herself a child. Playing with dolls their own age might slow girls&#39; premature rush into what Rowland saw as a “too sour and cynical” adult world. She designed the original three American Girl dolls—the well-to-do orphan Samantha Parkington, from the Progressive Era; the Swedish immigrant Kirsten Larson, on the 1854 Minnesota frontier; and the bespectacled Midwesterner Molly McIntire, on the home front of the Second World War—to have heavy, plush bodies and appealing faces. Each came with a set of six books about their lives, in which we meet them as nine-year-olds and follow them in the course of about one year during a significant point in American history.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;From the beginning, Rowland&#39;s invention wasn&#39;t just a doll but a brand. “The draw for American Girl was not just the stories, but the whole package,” the historians and podcast hosts Mary Mahoney and Allison Horrocks observe in “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Dolls-Our-Lives-Cant-American/dp/1250792835&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Dolls-Our-Lives-Cant-American/dp/1250792835&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Dolls-Our-Lives-Cant-American/dp/1250792835&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;Dolls of Our Lives: Why We Can&#39;t Quit American Girl&lt;/a>;,” their recent book that traces millennials&#39; and Gen Z-ers&#39; enduring emotional attachment to American Girl. Rowland sold the toys directly to parents and kids through catalogues that pictured the dolls in enticing tableaus where “everything in the image was for sale: furniture, accessories, and extra outfits.” In its first four months, Rowland&#39;s Pleasant Company, which sold to Mattel in 1998 for seven hundred million dollars, sold $1.7 million worth of product. By the nineteen-nineties and two-thousands, it was the dominant life-style brand for girls, and had accumulated a dizzying array of touchpoints and spinoffs: infant Bitty Baby dolls, cookbooks, theatre kits, paper dolls, DIY craft kits, a clothing line, an annual Girl of the Year and another model set in modern times that was customizable in tens of skin and hair tone combinations, an influential puberty book for girls (“&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Care-Keeping-You-Younger-American/dp/1609580834&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Care-Keeping-You-Younger-American/dp/1609580834&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Care-Keeping-You-Younger-American/dp/1609580834&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;The Care and Keeping of You&lt;/a>;”), pen-pal opportunities, a bimonthly magazine, immersive American Girl Place flagships in three cities, and the American Girl catalogue, which one woman tells the authors of “Dolls of Our Lives” that she demanded to be read from like it was a bedtime story.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;American Girl&#39;s first target audience, now adult millennials, still form a key part of the brand&#39;s fan base. Gatherings of people in their thirties are common at American Girl Cafés. There is more than one American Girl recap podcast like Horrocks and Mahoney&#39;s, a host of American Girl history meme accounts, and costumer YouTube creators who replicate period American Girl outfits in adult sizes. Unlike, say, Furby, American Girl appears to have inhered in some essential way within the millennial conception of self. For Horrocks and Mahoney, self-described typical nineties kids who grew up to become millennial archetypes—childless Ph.Ds unenthused by the “adjunctification” of the academic job market—the appeal of the dolls has proved both an outlet and a mystery. “The relationship between these imaginary girls and our girlhoods felt so vital and obvious to people who&#39;d lived it, but was harder to explain to people who hadn&#39;t,” they write. The stated purpose of their memoir-slash-cultural-history of the dolls is to “get at what is going on in the books and with the brand.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Part of what is “going on” is class anxiety. American Girl merchandise seems luxurious to little girls—books with ribbon bookmarks, dolls with thick hair—and the dolls cost enough to be inaccessible to many American girls (over $60 in 1986). But the brand has always been marketed to middle-class consumers. American Girl was originally “a &#39;masstige&#39; brand in a time of mass affluence,” as researchers put it in a 2009 article in the &lt;em>;Journal of Marketing&lt;/em>;, and thus especially appealing to the middle- and upper-middle-class parents of the eighties and nineties, who responded to national narratives of progress and prosperity by piling on extracurriculars and gearing play toward replication of the family&#39;s class position. This was childhood, essentially, as preparation for the college essay. American Girl offered twofold preparation in this regard, teaching historical facts through smart, plucky girls, who, with their documentable, diverse interests and well-rounded personalities, seemed like obvious college-bound types themselves.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;American Girl both positioned girls for entrance into white-collar professionalism and taught them to be good citizens. Contradictory but potent lessons in civic engagement were key to the brand. Vivid, selective histories encouraged children to identify equally with the colonizer Kirsten Larson (“A pioneer girl of strength and spirit who settles on the frontier”) and Addy Walker, a girl who does hard labor while enslaved on a tobacco plantation and who is marketed with the tagline “She&#39;s determined to be free.” At American Girl, history was a narrative of progress, and ordinary girls were its protagonists. As Horrocks and Mahoney put it, the brand taught “girls (who could afford it) that the past was theirs to claim” by adopting a “ &#39;girl stands in for nation&#39; vibe”—where “nation” is here “defined by whiteness, privilege, and a very specific vision of womanhood.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The limits and power of this approach are visible in the legacy of Addy, Pleasant Company&#39;s first (and, for nearly two decades, only) Black historical doll, whose story follows her eventual escape from slavery in North Carolina with her mother during the Civil War. Horrocks and Maroney discuss the panel of Black scholars who were convened to advise on Addy&#39;s character, plot, and history, and interview women who played with the doll as girls. Pleasant Company&#39;s approach to telling this story seems remarkable for an American corporation in the nineties. The company smudged history in other places, especially when it might make its white characters look bad—the family of Felicity Merriman, an American Girl living in Colonial Williamsburg, has two “servants” who are known to be enslaved—but for Addy&#39;s story, Pleasant Company explicitly avoided the presence of white saviors, and depicted slavery as dehumanizing and hopeless. When Addy&#39;s mother escapes with her elder daughter, she leaves an infant behind. “I wanted children to see African American people as part of strong, loving families, caught up in slavery, doing what they had to do to survive,” Connie Porter, the author of the line of Addy books, has said. For the Black girls who played with Addy, and the parents who considered buying the toy, this unflinching approach made for freighted play. Brit Bennett, in her 2015 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2015/05/28/addy-walker-american-girl/&quot;>;&lt;em>;Paris Review&lt;/em>; essay&lt;/a>; on Addy, asks, “If a doll exists on the border between person and thing, what does it mean to own a doll that represents an enslaved child who once existed on that same border?”&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Such complexity, even uneasiness, was how the brand thrived. In the 2009 article on the brand, written by marketing scholars who studied visitors of Chicago&#39;s American Girl Place for more than three years, the authors wrote the American Girl stories, each embodied by a doll, should be thought of less as “tidily nested identical entities” over which the brand held ultimate narrative control, and more as a “a disorderly aggregation . 。 。 filled with ambiguities that consumers are driven to resolve and lacunae they are compelled to fill.” Instead of limiting their imaginations, researchers found, the profusion of historical detail seemed to give girls permission to remix existing histories and respond with narratives of their own. The authors of the paper call American Girl an “open source” brand. (Other contemporary examples they cite are Linux and Wikipedia.) They thought—presciently, it turned out—that these brands, which allowed consumers to become storytellers and content creators in their own right, were the way of the future.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Almost all dolls prepare girls to perform womanhood. Baby dolls ready them for mothering; Barbies for being sexual objects. Rowland&#39;s twin innovations—a multifaceted, highly detailed consumer universe paired with a doll that was herself a girl—invited girls to perform themselves. American Girl introduced millennials to the pleasure of defining themselves by riffing on type, and of telling their life stories through brand-established channels—writing in to &lt;em>;American Girl&lt;/em>; magazine with their questions, becoming pen pals with other AG-loving girls, and supplying their own family trees for American Girl paper dolls, in which each woman in a familial line could be represented by a paper cutout, complete with clothes based on those worn in their family photographs.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Its books may have taught girls about history, but as a brand American Girl taught them to present themselves the way they later would online. Participating in an American Girl pen pal felt old-timey in the eighties and nineties, Horrocks and Mahoney write, but in fact segued neatly into a millennial-pioneered form of peer connection—the long-distance, online-only friend. (The authors cite—what else?—a tweet, whose author observes: “a new type of relationship first experienced by my generation is &#39;girl I&#39;ve been friends with online for 20 years.&#39; ”) In recent years, the brand&#39;s drumbeat of annual dolls, each immortalizing a different American place and time, has occasioned waves of American Girl history memes that ironically call for brand enshrinement of absurd or personal moments in history.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;j5dna9&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;As Horrocks and Mahoney note, American Girl barely acknowledged the existence of the Internet in the nineties and two-thousands, positioning itself as a “safe sounding board and community” for girls who knew better than to waste their time in chat rooms; with their focus on historical reënactments and educational reading, the dolls and books themselves seemed like healthy alternatives to childhoods increasingly under threat from the Internet. Yet the brand prepared girls to see themselves as content creators, and their lives as content.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;While reading Horrocks and Mahoney&#39;s book, I was reminded of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tag/taylor-swift&quot;>;Taylor Swift&lt;/a>;, another powerhouse brand inextricably bound to the millennial cultural and economic zeitgeist, as well as to its understanding of girlhood. Like American Girl, she&#39;s huge in multiple senses, both mind-bendingly popular and remarkably capacious, offering her fans evolving opportunities for identification and inviting them to participate in the storytelling. Like American Girl, she became a thing during the millennials&#39; youth, but has ballooned to include Gen Z as part of her adult fan base. During her generation-defining 2023 tour, members of both generations have been dressing up like her “eras.” Are you a “1989” or a “Reputation”? These categories are all facets of the same white woman, of course, but the limitations of the types on offer are less important than the kind of ownership over and fluidity of identity creation they facilitate. Perfecting a performance of exactly who you are—curated and constant, characterized at once by evolution and by brand coherence—is at the core of what millennial and Gen Z children were taught to define as a good personality: one that is authentic, employable, friendly, and fluent in the art of online self-presentation.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Horrocks and Mahoney don&#39;t quite manage to supply a direct answer to the question of why their generation can&#39;t quit American Girl—Horrocks cites her own ability to participate in the brand&#39;s “community of global friendship” as an adult, Mahoney the potential the dolls give to now grown women like herself “to imagine what we might become.” But their reverent descriptions of brand-facilitated childhood memories—of “pristine” doll braids, or the sound of Mahoney&#39;s mother&#39;s voice as she read the books out loud—suggest another reason that millennials, in particular, are still so captivated by the dolls.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Rowland intended to create experiences for girls of the eighties and nineties that would last into their adulthoods, but she could never have anticipated the way our proximity to the advent of the consumer Internet caused our experience of girlhood to be uniquely bifurcated. Our early childhoods preceded social media completely, but our teen-age understandings of ourselves were irrevocably colonized by it. By college, we&#39;d immigrated to the land of the online, and could never return home. American Girl may have prepared us to be good digital subjects, but the dolls were not of the Internet themselves; as we logged on, they stayed behind. It&#39;s through this undocumentable looking glass that images of the original American Girls appear to us as adults, missives from a past that the Internet has both resurfaced and erased.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;While writing this piece, I followed &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.americangirlfan.com/american-girl-catalogs/&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.americangirlfan.com/american-girl-catalogs/&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.americangirlfan.com/american-girl-catalogs/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;a link to a blog&lt;/a>; with photographs of each page of the American Girl catalogue. Although “Dolls of Our Lives” describes the catalogue in detail, I had forgotten that I&#39;d ever seen a copy. From some untrodden, internal place, a visceral memory stirred, of holding up the page with Felicity pictured vertically in the centerfold, the midsection of her floral everyday dress dimpled by the magazine&#39;s staples. The concentration I possessed, then, to fall into the images of her trunk and accouterments as though in contemplation of a Bruegel! I hadn&#39;t seen these images for twenty years, but I still remembered every page. ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 17 Nov 2023 19:06:01 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Siskel, Ebert, and the Secret of Criticism]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-front-row/siskel-ebert-and-the-secret-of-criticism]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-17T00:11:58.129Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65563d9d7d10bdf89a37e60b/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Brody-Siskel-Ebert.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;article >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attribute-verso-pattern=&quot;article-body&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;ArticlePageChunks&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Roger Ebert and Gene Siskel, who went on the air together for the first time in 1975, have been off the air for a long time now. Siskel died in 1999, and Ebert bowed out in 2011, two years before his death. But, for many people, they remain the very exemplars of film criticism. Fellow-critics still admire their vigorous, wide-ranging discussions while, for the public at large, their thumbs-up/thumbs-down gimmick, which they came up with in 1982, has proved indelible. The story of their rise to fame is told in enticing detail by Matt Singer in a joint biography titled—what else?—“&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Opposable-Thumbs-Siskel-Changed-Forever-ebook/dp/B0BP5VQWKC&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Opposable-Thumbs-Siskel-Changed-Forever-ebook/dp/B0BP5VQWKC&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Opposable-Thumbs-Siskel-Changed-Forever-ebook/dp/B0BP5VQWKC&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;Opposable Thumbs&lt;/a>;.” For Singer, the critic at ScreenCrush and the current chairperson of the New York Film Critics Circle, the book is clearly a labor of love. He writes that his own aspiration to be a critic was sparked by their show, which he began watching obsessively as a middle schooler, in the early nineteen-nineties.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Singer&#39;s admirably fanatical research renders this obsession tangible. He seems to have absorbed every moment that the duo spent onscreen, whether on their own show or other people&#39;s. (They were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tag/johnny-carson&quot;>;Johnny Carson&lt;/a>; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tag/david-letterman&quot;>;David Letterman&lt;/a>; regulars for years). He has combed his heroes&#39; writings and interviewed their colleagues, friends, family, and fellow-critics. But, more than merely gathering this material, he has thought deeply about it, and the best thing about the book is the way that it highlights some of the basic quandaries that critics confront (or avoid) daily. These fundamental conundrums of criticism involve questions about specialism, authority, personality, art, and business. And, with Siskel and Ebert, these dilemmas came into play long before the duo joined forces on television. Both Illinois natives, the two men came to their critical careers by very different paths, but they had one crucial thing in common: neither had set out to be a film critic.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Ebert, born in Urbana in 1942, was one of those precocious journalists who seem to have printer&#39;s ink in his veins. As a high-school sports reporter, he won an Associated Press prize for &lt;em>;professional&lt;/em>; (not just student) journalists. He edited his college daily at the University of Illinois and, in 1966, having begun a doctorate at the University of Chicago, took a day job as a reporter at the Chicago &lt;em>;Sun-Times&lt;/em>;. The next year, when the newspaper&#39;s veteran movie critic retired, he was tapped as her replacement, having written a few film-related reports. (A publicist recommended him.) In his wise and engaging autobiography, “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Life-Itself-Memoir-Roger-Ebert/dp/0446584967&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Life-Itself-Memoir-Roger-Ebert/dp/0446584967&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Life-Itself-Memoir-Roger-Ebert/dp/0446584967&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;Life Itself&lt;/a>;,” he recalls that he didn&#39;t intend to stay in the job long: “My master plan was to become an op-ed columnist and then eventually, of course, a great and respected novelist.” But within a decade he&#39;d become the first film critic to win a Pulitzer Prize for criticism.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Siskel, in contrast, came to journalism more or less by happenstance. Born in Chicago, in 1946, he majored in philosophy at Yale and planned on a career in law and politics. That changed when, needing to avoid the draft, he joined the Army Reserves. He wound up as an Army journalist at a base in Indiana, and, when he got out of the service, in 1969, he took a job with the Chicago &lt;em>;Tribune&lt;/em>;. He&#39;d been there only eight months when the paper&#39;s movie critic took a leave. Siskel, who&#39;d written a few pieces about the movie world, put himself forward and got the job.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Now the two men were in direct competition: doing the same job at Chicago&#39;s two great rival papers. But, as much as they often clashed, there was another key thing they shared: neither was a movie person. Not only was neither a cinema-studies major (such a thing barely existed in their day) but also neither fit the profile of the cinephile, hanging out at repertory theatres and taking sides in the debates then raging over the so-called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2008/04/07/auteur-wars&quot;>;auteur theory&lt;/a>;. They were just regular moviegoers who managed to find a journalistic application for their pleasure. Their paths to television were separate but symmetrical, each maintaining print journalism as the solid basis of his activity. In 1973, Ebert hosted a series of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tag/ingmar-bergman&quot;>;Ingmar Bergman&lt;/a>; films on television, which scored an Emmy nomination. Then Siskel started delivering brief movie reviews on a local station. Then, in late 1975, the Chicago public station WTTW paired them up for a joint movie-review program.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The breakthrough took a while. Though PBS broadcasts in markets such as New York and Los Angeles brought national attention, by 1981, as Singer tells it, Siskel and Ebert were getting frustrated with the over-rehearsed nature of the show. The pair, encouraged by the assistant producer Nancy De Los Santos, decided to give free rein to everything else—the discussions and arguments, the slips and flubs, the spontaneity and authenticity of their interactions. Rather than an entente between rivals, the format became gladiatorial. Critics on TV weren&#39;t new, as Singer notes; most of them would do a few minutes during news broadcasts. Siskel and Ebert were different. Individually, they remained writers first, transferring the essence of their columns to the screen, but the show as a whole was TV first and foremost, with all the showmanship of the commercial medium. Predictably, their burgeoning fame attracted a backlash. In 1990, decrying the state of film criticism in the august pages of &lt;em>;Film Comment&lt;/em>;, Richard Corliss &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.filmcomment.com/article/richard-corliss-all-thumbs-or-is-there-a-future-for-film-criticism&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.filmcomment.com/article/richard-corliss-all-thumbs-or-is-there-a-future-for-film-criticism&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.filmcomment.com/article/richard-corliss-all-thumbs-or-is-there-a-future-for-film-criticism&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;dismissed&lt;/a>; the show as “a sitcom . 。 。 starring two guys who live in a movie theater and argue all the time. Oscar Ebert and Felix Siskel.” Singer differs: “To a generation of up-and-coming cinephiles, it was their first taste of film school.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Singer correctly identifies the show&#39;s crucial ingredient: the two stars&#39; clashing personalities and relentless competitiveness. As rival newspaper critics, they&#39;d been striving to outdo each other for the best part of a decade. Now they were in the same room. In his memoir, Ebert writes:&lt;/p>;&lt;blockquote >;&lt;div >;&lt;p>;In the television biz, they talk about “chemistry.” Not a thought was given to our chemistry. We just had it, because from the day the &lt;em>;Chicago Tribune&lt;/em>; made Gene its film critic, we were professional enemies. We never had a single meaningful conversation before we started to work on our TV program.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/blockquote>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Ebert&#39;s expansive, jovial character immediately comes across in this memoir and in other published portraits. Siskel remains more of an enigma, because he died young and also because he was a far more private individual, rarely speaking of his personal life. The portrait of Siskel that emerges in Singer&#39;s telling is fascinating. A former Yale roommate declared him “the most competitive person I&#39;ve ever run across—more so than Michael Jordan or Bill and Hillary Clinton.” Ebert said so, too: “Gene was the most competitive man I ever met.” Ebert may have been intensely conscious of a rivalry with Siskel, but Siskel&#39;s competitive ferocity and confrontational chutzpah were on another level. When asked by his first boss at the &lt;em>;Tribune&lt;/em>; what his ultimate goal was, Siskel answered, “Your job.” (When a colleague expressed shock, Siskel replied, “Candor. It is powerful. It knocks people off their feet. They are not used to it. Try it some day. If you&#39;ve got the guts.”)&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;x3d8pg&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;In print, Ebert and Siskel competed for scoops and for celebrity interviews, a rivalry that Siskel carried to absurd extremes. He would stop at nothing to find out who was on Ebert&#39;s schedule—once, he posed as an assistant cancelling an Ebert interview—all of which drove Ebert to cover his tracks with complicated ruses of his own. Siskel boasted, “I have the ability to look this guy straight in the eye and lie to him and he can&#39;t tell.” Siskel&#39;s biggest win involved nothing less than the duo&#39;s name: of course, both men wanted their name to come first, but Siskel, with a blend of aesthetic acuity and brazen self-interest, assured his partner that “Siskel and Ebert” &lt;em>;sounded&lt;/em>; better.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Just as André Malraux, in a celebrated &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://journals.openedition.org/1895/5020#tocto2n3&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://journals.openedition.org/1895/5020#tocto2n3&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://journals.openedition.org/1895/5020#tocto2n3&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;piece&lt;/a>; of film criticism from 1939, reminded readers smitten with the art of movies that “Moreover, the cinema is a business,” so it&#39;s worth emphasizing that criticism, as earnestly devoted to the cult of art as it may be, is also journalism. Ebert and Siskel were hardly the last critics to be also active movie-industry reporters, but they&#39;re among the last major ones to come up as generalists. Exuding the worldly rough-and-tumble of the journalistic profession, they bucked the stereotype of film critics as—to quote Letterman&#39;s on-air characterization—“kind of goofy, too esoteric, too intellectual.” Corliss wasn&#39;t totally wrong to compare their show to a sitcom, but “The Odd Couple” is a red herring: it was more like “The Mary Tyler Moore Show,” an inside-TV story whose comic spontaneity naturally evoked the tangle of backstage life. More than that, though, “Siskel and Ebert” wasn&#39;t a TV show so much as a &lt;em>;movie&lt;/em>;. Siskel and Ebert were living incarnations of “The Front Page” dragged into the cathode-tube era, bringing classic-movie values to the television talk show. They may not have known as much about movies as some more fanatically cinephile critics did, but they &lt;em>;belonged&lt;/em>; to the movies. Even if they weren&#39;t movie people, they were movie characters.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Criticism is a fraught profession because it&#39;s parasitical. It depends on the work of artists, without which criticism couldn&#39;t exist. A critic who acknowledges and accepts the fact of this dependence is trying to salvage the dignity of the activity; critics who don&#39;t are just trying to salvage their own dignity. That&#39;s one reason that I&#39;m wary of critics talking about criticism: they so often discuss the enterprise in terms that define the surpassing merit of their own efforts. And even the most earnest self-deprecation can contain the seeds of vanity. Still, all work is interesting to contemplate—a philosopher friend of mine used to say, “It&#39;s a miracle that anyone does anything”—and criticism has the contemplation built in. Because critics are in the habit of discussing the way that others work, it&#39;s just a turn of the screw for them to scrutinize their own practices.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;As Singer&#39;s book documents, Siskel and Ebert&#39;s frequent riffs about their show amount to a rough-and-ready touchstone—even a questionnaire—for critics of all stripes to ponder. Take, for example, the so-called Gene Siskel Test, glossed by Singer as “Is this film more interesting than a documentary of the same actors having lunch?” (I&#39;d say it depends on who directed the documentary.) Provocative on its own terms, the test becomes even more so when folded back on itself: If Siskel and Ebert were just having lunch instead of discussing movies, would the show be more interesting or less? Perhaps, too, the imagined lunch documentary exemplifies yet another dimension to movie reviewing. Seen this way, a critic&#39;s job is to imagine not just the actors&#39;-lunch documentary but also one about the director thinking through the project, and what it must have felt like to make the movie, and to have had the urge to do so in the first place. Siskel&#39;s test, far from having any practical application, is a vivid thought-experiment to shift a viewer&#39;s emphasis toward the real lives of a movie&#39;s creators and the inner lives that the finished work reflects.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;The peculiarity of the critical condition, its combination of imaginative sympathy and gimlet-eyed judgment, of advocacy and exploration, comes across in a diptych of Siskel and Ebert quips reported by Singer:&lt;/p>;&lt;blockquote >;&lt;div >;&lt;p>;In a 1996 interview, Siskel said that he told readers that by going to movies they “are spending something more valuable than money—your life,” and if a movie didn&#39;t work after an hour they should “get up and leave.” Of the crummy 1990 thriller &lt;em>;Lisa&lt;/em>;, Ebert mused, “If the two hours you spend in front of the screen are not as interesting as two hours you could spend outside the theater, why spend your money?”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/blockquote>;&lt;p >;So it depends on how interesting you find your life. I recall discussing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/06/12/how-the-marvel-cinematic-universe-swallowed-hollywood&quot;>;superhero movies&lt;/a>; with my older daughter as the genre was rising to prominence, wondering why audiences go for them. “They don&#39;t have enough drama in their lives,” she said. Sure, one could say the same about other genres (maybe any genre); the real value of this test is to acknowledge the fundamentally personal aspect of a viewer&#39;s responses. The great contribution of Siskel and Ebert, disagree with them as I might about any individual film, was to embody, however histrionically, the personality, the character, and the humanity that&#39;s an inescapable part of the critic&#39;s activity. Singer records Ebert giving voice to this notion in a TV interview:&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;kar9bf&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;blockquote >;&lt;div >;&lt;p>;“When you disagree on a movie,” Ebert said, “you&#39;re &lt;em>;not&lt;/em>; disagreeing on the movie. You&#39;re disagreeing on who you are. If I don&#39;t like a movie and he does, then I&#39;m not saying that the movie is flawed, I&#39;m saying that &lt;em>;he&#39;s&lt;/em>; flawed.”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/blockquote>;&lt;p >;There&#39;s an aspect of criticism that inherently aims, however ironically, to repair the flaws of others—to improve the world through aesthetic judgment. I feel that just about any movie that sparks the energy to write about it in detail is worth seeing—but, after I&#39;d written a negative review, someone asked me whether I was suggesting that they not see the movie, and I responded, “No, I&#39;m suggesting that you not enjoy it.” The flipside of this is that movie critics also get to suggest enjoyment. Sharing enthusiasm is the far more gratifying (and, happily, more frequent) part of the job.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;And there are many ways to share it. Plenty of criticism is neither written nor spoken to camera. Indeed, seen from a certain perspective, everything is criticism—the insightful pairing in a repertory cinema&#39;s program, photographs taken on a movie set, essay-films about other films, profiles, and interviews. It&#39;s in this domain that Ebert&#39;s legacy—Siskel died too young for a second act—goes beyond the show and the thumbs. Though he didn&#39;t start as a movie person, he became one, with fervor. In 1999, he and his wife, Chaz Ebert, launched a film festival, now known as &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://ebertfest.com/&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://ebertfest.com/&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://ebertfest.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;Ebertfest&lt;/a>;, at his alma mater, the University of Illinois; it&#39;s scheduled to celebrate its twenty-fifth anniversary next year. Even more vitally, he launched, in 2002, a &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.rogerebert.com/&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.rogerebert.com/&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.rogerebert.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;Web site&lt;/a>; that both houses his own archive of work and commissions new pieces from writers. Unlike, say, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/contributors/pauline-kael&quot;>;Pauline Kael&lt;/a>;, who extended her influence via a society of acolytes (“Paulettes”), Ebert opened his pages to a wide range of young critics who may not have shared his views but whose work he admired. It has been a crucial showcase for the writing of several generations of critics and has helped make American film criticism today better than it has ever been. It may be his greatest act of criticism—and the apotheosis of the best of what he and Siskel were getting at with their show. ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 17 Nov 2023 09:06:01 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[The Left Comes for Biden on Israel]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.newyorker.com/news/letter-from-bidens-washington/the-left-comes-for-biden-on-israel]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-17T00:16:02.222Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/655695d7de6b68b0d193556f/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Glasser-Biden-Update.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;article >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attribute-verso-pattern=&quot;article-body&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;ArticlePageChunks&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;At a moment of almost unrelenting bad news—of war in the Middle East and Europe and violence-tinged political rancor at home—somehow, the first thing I managed to see on Thursday morning was an unexpected bit of geopolitical cheer: the Chinese leader Xi Jinping had signalled his willingness to have China send new giant pandas to the United States, to replace the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/what-comes-after-panda-diplomacy&quot;>;beloved aging bears&lt;/a>; that were driven away from the National Zoo in a sad convoy of FedEx trucks last week and put on an airplane for a flight back to their ancestral home. Xi, who was in San Francisco for an Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit and to meet with President Joe Biden for their first face-to-face session in a year, had announced at a dinner with business leaders on Wednesday that he was prepared to deploy a new set of furry “envoys of friendship between the Chinese and American people.” He also leaned hard into comforting clichés of the not-so-distant past, reassuring the executives in attendance—some of whom had paid forty thousand dollars a table to dine with him—that China is no adversary and, in fact, still hopes to be “a partner and friend of the United States.” The return of panda diplomacy might have been the most concrete sign yet that war is neither imminent nor inevitable between the world&#39;s two leading powers. At least that&#39;s something.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Biden&#39;s meeting with Xi was a cordial enough session; the most substantive deliverables to come out of it were a modest promise to resume some military-to-military contact that had been cut off about a year earlier and a plan to work together to curb the supply of the deadly drug fentanyl to the United States. But a truer reflection of the current state of affairs between the two countries came in the President&#39;s solo press conference afterward. Biden had finished his largely pro-forma remarks about what he called America&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2023/11/16/remarks-by-president-biden-in-a-press-conference-woodside-ca/&quot;>;responsible competition&lt;/a>; with China and was headed out of the room when he stopped to answer a reporter&#39;s shouted question: Did he still think the Chinese leader was a “dictator”?&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Biden had used the word to describe Xi earlier this year, setting off a furor in the Chinese state media. It seemed off-message with the good-vibes positioning of the summit to repeat it. But repeat it, Biden did. How could he not? Before the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/letter-from-bidens-washington/will-the-russian-empire-strike-back&quot;>;Russian invasion of Ukraine&lt;/a>;, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/letter-from-bidens-washington/the-warnings-about-trump-in-2024-are-getting-louder&quot;>;resurgence of Trump&lt;/a>;, and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/letter-from-bidens-washington/the-week-when-biden-hugged-bibi&quot;>;Israel-Hamas war&lt;/a>;, Biden had devoted his foreign policy to the idea that the challenge posed by Xi&#39;s autocratic rule in China was a generational threat to the United States. This is a President who speaks of the “inflection point” that the world faces, defined by a struggle between democracies and resurgent autocracies such as Xi&#39;s and that of his ally Vladimir Putin. “Well, look, he is,” Biden said. “I mean, he&#39;s a dictator in the sense that he is a guy who runs a country that is a Communist country.” Predictably, the Chinese Foreign Ministry responded on Thursday by calling Biden&#39;s remarks “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/15/politics/joe-biden-xi-jinping-dictator/index.html&quot;>;extremely erroneous&lt;/a>;,” as well as an “irresponsible political maneuver.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The skirmish, however, hardly registered. Americans seem much too busy these days ripping each other apart to be bothered with rhetorical hot flashes of great-power rivalry. It says much about this moment in US politics that, on Thursday, when demonstrators staged a die-in on San Francisco&#39;s Bay Bridge timed to the &lt;em >;APEC&lt;/em>; summit, they were protesting Biden&#39;s strong support for Israel in the wake of the October 7th &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/dispatch/waking-to-an-attack-from-hamas&quot;>;terrorist attack&lt;/a>; by Hamas and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/11/06/israel-gaza-war-hamas&quot;>;subsequent Israeli attack&lt;/a>; of Gaza, not anything having to do with Xi. With calls for a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/how-would-a-humanitarian-pause-work-in-gaza&quot;>;ceasefire&lt;/a>; growing this week, Biden has continued to emphasize that Israel is justified in its war, including the “precise” operation it launched inside Gaza&#39;s Al-Shifa hospital, which Israel claims also serves as a military base for Hamas. “The idea that they&#39;re going to just stop and not do anything is not realistic,” the President said during his press conference. At almost exactly the same time as Biden finished speaking in California, left-leaning protesters in Washington, DC, blocked the entrance to the Democratic National Committee headquarters, trapping the Party&#39;s congressional leadership inside. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and other senior Democrats were at a reception for the Party&#39;s top 2024 recruits, and had to be evacuated by Capitol Police, who said demonstrators had turned violent and wielded pepper spray against officers. (Protesters claimed they were “violently attacked” by police, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2023/11/16/capitol-police-fallout-protest-democratic-headquarters-00127579?nname=playbook-pm&amp;amp;nid=0000015a-dd3e-d536-a37b-dd7fd8af0000&amp;amp;nrid=00000159-b841-dffc-abfb-fcf1508d0000&amp;amp;nlid=964328&quot;>;according to Politico&lt;/a>;, resulting in more than ninety injuries.)&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;On Thursday morning, I spoke with Andrei Cherny, one of the candidates who attended the reception. Cherny is running in Arizona&#39;s First District, a top target for Democrats in their effort to take back control of the House. In 2020, the district went for Biden over Trump by just under two points; four years earlier, it had gone for Trump. When Ron Klain, Biden&#39;s former White House chief of staff, held an event at his home for Cherny, he told attendees, only half joking, that Cherny&#39;s was “the most important district in the country for Biden.” Cherny is the grandson of four Holocaust survivors. He told me that, since October 7th, he considers Biden to have done a “really masterful job in terrible and difficult circumstances,” trying to balance support for Israel with concern for the humanitarian crisis that Israel&#39;s war is inflicting on Palestinian civilians.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The experience of being trapped inside the Party&#39;s own headquarters, though, underscored the extent to which this war has triggered a true clash inside the Democratic Party—a “good-faith” one, Cherny insisted, despite Wednesday night&#39;s violent skirmish. Surveys have found the Party so divided on the matter that, in an AP-&lt;em >;NORC&lt;/em>; survey released last week, &lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-apnorc-poll-biden-democrats-42b195c5a577a40ff981d26afbff9997&quot;>;nearly half of Democrats disapproved&lt;/a>; of Biden&#39;s handling of the Israel-Hamas conflict. A day before the protest at the DNC, a pro-Israel rally drew tens of thousands to the capital, including Democratic leaders from both the House and Senate. “It feels like, in some ways, the first real foreign-policy debate among Democrats in the post-Cold War era,” Cherny told me. His view is that, while there have been strong disagreements among Democrats in recent decades on foreign-policy issues such as the US invasion of Iraq, most Democrats eventually came to see that war as a mistake. But on the Israel-Hamas war the Party is quite profoundly split between traditional liberal internationalists such as Biden, for whom bedrock backing for the Middle East&#39;s lone democracy remains a core belief, and those on the Party&#39;s left flank who see Israel as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/why-an-israeli-human-rights-organization-decided-to-call-israel-an-apartheid-regime&quot;>;an apartheid state&lt;/a>; that has left Palestinians little choice but violent resistance.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Cherny, in his previous incarnation as a party intellectual, co-founded the journal &lt;em>;Democracy: A Journal of Ideas&lt;/em>;, an incubator for many of the young liberals who would go on to staff the Obama and Biden Administrations. He also wrote &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/dp/0399154965&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/dp/0399154965&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/dp/0399154965&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;a history of the 1948 Berlin airlift&lt;/a>;, an important chapter in the early Cold War. “This reminds me so much of the Harry Truman–Henry Wallace kind of schism of how Democrats and progressives see the world,” he said. “It&#39;s really the first time this debate&#39;s been joined since the fall of the Berlin Wall.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;None of this may matter too much for Biden politically. If the war is over soon, the world will no doubt move on to another crisis before next fall&#39;s election. Foreign policy is rarely, if ever, a decisive issue in a US Presidential contest. And it&#39;s hard to imagine pro-Palestinian protesters deciding that Trump—he of the Muslim ban and the whatever-Netanyahu-wants Israel policy—will better represent their cause than Biden. (In a recent rally, the former President promised to cancel the visas of any foreign students on American college campuses who are “Hamas sympathizers.” “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLN2n7ifeic&quot;>;We don&#39;t want you in our country&lt;/a>;,” he said.) Cherny, for his part, told me that his voters care more about immigration and the border than Israel. The inflated price of gas or a gallon of milk seems like a bigger problem for Biden than his decision to stick with America&#39;s decades-old military backing of Israel.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;But, like all crises, the war has nonetheless revealed something important about our politics—a rift between the Democrats&#39; young and increasingly left-leaning base and an old-fashioned liberal of a President who is turning eighty-one on Monday. A party divided against itself will only have a harder time standing up against Trump—or Xi for that matter. Biden, as the drama of recent weeks has reinforced, is and will remain a proud and unyielding son of the twentieth century. Is it enough, in this age of TikTok, to give him another go? ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;7brdqf&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;ts405&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 17 Nov 2023 09:06:01 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
