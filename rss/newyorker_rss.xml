target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;在季节期间攻击&lt;/a>;巴勒斯坦农民，除了摧毁或砍伐橄榄树外，还窃取他们的农作物或阻止他们到达自己的土地。自1967年以来，超过八十万棵巴勒斯坦橄榄树被以色列当局和定居者非法连根拔起。许多已有数百年历史。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;过去几个月，以色列军队一直在约旦河西岸城市发动突袭，逮捕可疑的伊斯兰圣战武装分子并缴获武器。与此同时，以色列国家安全部长 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/02/27/itamar-ben-gvir-israels-minister-of-chaos&quot;>;Itamar Ben-Gvir &lt;/a>;，已&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.timesofisrael.com/ben-gvir-says-10000-assault-rifles-purchased-for-civilian-security-teams/&quot;>;开始&lt;/a>;武装居住在西岸的四十万多名定居者。截至 2023 年 7 月，西岸定居者持有一些&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2023-10-20/ty-article/.premium/idf-took-away -weapons-from-gaza-border-towns-and-armed-w-bank-settlers-in-the-thousands/0000018b-4d6d-dbe0-a38b-cdfd0d4f0000&quot;>;2600 件武器&lt;/a>;以色列军队。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;以色列军队的大部分显然部署在约旦河西岸，远离加沙南部边境，当时&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/ dispatch/wake-to-an-attack-from-hamas&quot;>;哈马斯于 10 月 7 日上午袭击以色列&lt;/a>;，造成包括妇女和儿童在内的 1400 人死亡，并劫持了 200 多人质。以色列军队似乎非常有信心，认为南部边境没有危险，因此武器已从该地区的阵地转移到西岸的定居点和非法哨所。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;现在焦点已转移到加沙，预计将开始地面入侵，据联合国称，那里已有五千多人被杀，近一半的住房单元被摧毁或损坏。加沙公共工程部。哈马斯袭击事件发生后不久，总理&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tag/benjamin-netanyahu&quot;>;本杰明·内塔尼亚胡&lt;/a>;宣布他将摧毁哈马斯并将加沙变成一座荒岛。当我第一次听到这个词时，我无法理解“被遗弃”这个词的全部含义。但随着加沙居民区被夷为废墟，平民开始从加沙地带北部逃往南部，其意义日益清晰。&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria -hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;几天前，我给我的一位同事 Sharhabeel Al Zaeem 打了电话，他是一名律师他住在加沙市高档的里马尔区。我们两人都曾在 1991 年与以色列的谈判中为巴勒斯坦谈判代表提供咨询，两年前《奥斯陆协议》签署，建立了巴勒斯坦权力机构作为约旦河西岸和加沙地带的管理实体。巴勒斯坦权力机构仍然统治着西岸，但 2006 年哈马斯在加沙当选。到 2007 年 6 月，哈马斯武装分子已经控制了加沙地带，并清除了法塔赫竞争对手的官员。&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;自从内塔尼亚胡上台以来2009年第二次上任时，他奉行以牺牲巴勒斯坦权力机构为代价加强哈马斯的政策，允许卡塔尔在哈马斯统治下向加沙转移近10亿美元。通过保持这种分裂并阻止巴勒斯坦国的建立，以色列政府可以说没有统一的巴勒斯坦领导人可以与之谈判。但现在内塔尼亚胡已经着手“摧毁哈马斯”，这个组织多年来一直是以色列对巴勒斯坦人的政治基础。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;我问阿尔扎伊姆他在加沙城的情况如何。 “我们过去遭受过可怕的战争，”他告诉我。他的房子没有受到直接袭击，但所有窗户都被打破了。他决定收拾行装，与家人一起前往加沙地带中部的代尔巴拉赫市。途中，他们前面的一支车队被击中，造成七十人死亡。 “我们在代尔巴拉赫住的地方有两所房子被击中，”他继续说道。他告诉我，他们一直在清点 &lt;em>;shuhada&lt;/em>; 或烈士的数量。&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;我问他的食物和水状况如何喜欢。 “我们正在管理，”他说。 “我们正集中精力确保安全。”如何做到这一点？我问。 “只能祈祷，”他回答道。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;10 月 13 日，以色列政府为地面入侵做准备，&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/q-and -a/the-人道主义灾难-in-gaza&quot;>;命令&lt;/a>;加沙北部一百万巴勒斯坦人逃往南方。但清空北方的努力却取得了不同程度的成功。破坏是不可否认的。近&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/23/where-are-gazas-neighbourhoods-destroyed-by-israel&quot;>;十七万个住宅单元&lt;/a>;据巴勒斯坦外交部长称，这些设施已被摧毁。而且，自 10 月 15 日以来，据以色列军方称，&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/gaza-braces-israeli-ground-assault-fears-conflict-spreading-grow -2023-10-15/&quot;>;六十万人&lt;/a>;已启程前往南方。但估计有十万人仍留在加沙城。正如我的另一位同事拉吉·苏拉尼 (Raji Sourani) 最近所说，“我们将有尊严、自豪地死去，但我们不会根据以色列军队的命令和指示而被杀害”&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https:/ /www.democracynow.org/2023/10/17/raji_sourani_gaza&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.democracynow.org/ 2023/10/17/raji_sourani_gaza&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.democracynow.org/2023/10/17/raji_sourani_gaza&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;告诉&lt;/a>;“民主现在！” “我在这里就像一棵橄榄树。我们永远不会离开我们的祖国。”许多巴勒斯坦人在发现南部并不安全后也返回北部，那里的轰炸仍在继续。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;渗透加沙的暴力已经开始在约旦河西岸爆发。自10月7日以来，卫生部统计至少有90名巴勒斯坦人被以色列军队或定居者杀害。而且，与加沙一样，巴勒斯坦人出于对定居者暴力的恐惧而离开了西岸的家园。据以色列被占领土人权信息中心 B&#39;Tselem 称，​​有 8 个社区（居住着 472 人，其中包括 136 名儿童）已被撤离。在另外六个社区，至少有八十人离开了家园。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;最近的&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.haaretz.com/opinion/editorial/2023-10-17/ty- 《国土报》的article-opinion/palestinian-expulsion-amid-the-fog-of-war/0000018b-39f9-d5b8-a78b-f9f92b720000&quot;>;社论&lt;/a>;认为，驱逐巴勒斯坦人加沙和约旦河西岸是“一场在右翼政府和定居者的支持下进行的广泛运动，现在在战争的掩护下，已经获得了巨大的势头。”两周前，联合国宣布，超过四十二万三千人因空袭而流离失所，并被赶往南部靠近埃及边境的地区。周二，加沙 230 万人口中，有 140 万人在境内流离失所。&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >; &lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;3a1bfk&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;1948 年，巴勒斯坦人被迫离开自己的城镇和村庄，这场流离失所被称为“nakba”。今天，令人欣慰的是，周边国家的领导人可能无意中阻止了另一场&lt;em>;浩劫&lt;/em>;的发生。埃及已确保边境安全，防止大量难民涌入。约旦国王阿卜杜拉二世表示：“约旦没有难民，埃及也没有难民。这是必须在加沙内部处理的人道主义局势。”无论如何，只有在战争结束后保证他们返回加沙家园的情况下，绝大多数在加沙遭受地狱般轰炸的人才会接受临时避难。巴勒斯坦人不允许以色列再次取代他们的决心也对第二次&lt;em>;nakba&lt;/em>;起到了克制作用。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;然而，我们无法知道这些障碍会持续多久。战争已经开始，而且还没有结束的迹象。以色列军事规划者现在表示，战争可能持续数月。 10月23日，以色列证实，自10月7日以来在加沙被扣为人质的又有两人已获释，使哈马斯释放的人数达到四人。哈马斯暗示，可以释放更多人质，以换取停火和向加沙提供更多援助。然而，以色列迄今已排除任何停火的可能性，因为它加强了军事行动。&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;与此同时，橄榄采摘约旦河西岸的这个季节，曾经对巴勒斯坦人来说是一段安静、沉思的时光，现在却成了自己的战场。 10月11日，在库斯拉村，以色列定居者枪杀了三名巴勒斯坦人。第二天，定居者杀害了参加送葬队伍的一对父子。当我采摘橄榄时，图勒凯尔姆市附近的努尔沙姆斯难民营里又有 12 名巴勒斯坦人被杀。以色列军队并没有阻止暴力定居者。 10 月 15 日，以色列议会国家安全委员会 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2023-10-22/ty-article/.premium/ben-gvir-and-his-wife -boast-of-arming-jewish-israelis/0000018b-5753-d473-a5fb-77db1c2d0000&quot;>;批准&lt;/a>;放宽法规，使以色列人更容易获得枪支许可证。约旦河西岸巴勒斯坦人缺乏安全感只会削弱巴勒斯坦权力机构的吸引力。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;以色列军队上一次入侵整个约旦河西岸是在 2002 年，发生了一系列可怕的自杀事件之后个人和武装团体在以色列城市针对以色列平民实施的爆炸事件。随后的入侵以前所未有的方式撕裂了两国，以色列大幅增加了定居点的建设，将巴勒斯坦人限制在不同的贫民区，并进一步巩固了以色列对西岸的殖民统治。除非美国向以色列施压，要求其停火，并开始与巴勒斯坦领导人合作，全面解决这场冲突，否则当前的战争不仅会进一步加剧双方的分歧，还会激化中东局势。未来很多年。 ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;

八十岁了。自十九世纪七十年代末以来，她一直是澳大利亚最受欢迎和最神话化的作家之一。在过去的几年里，出于她不完全理解的原因，美国和英国的读者开始关注她的作品——她最近将她的旧书单卖给了这两个国家的出版商。今年秋天，万神殿在美国出版了她的两本书：“&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Childrens-Bach-Novel-Helen-Garner/dp/0553387413/” data-event-click=&quot;{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Childrens-Bach-Novel-Helen-Garner/dp/0553387413/&quot;

data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot; ;,“outgoingURL”：“https://www.amazon.com/First-Stone-Some-Questions-Power/dp/0747532524”}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/First- Stone-Some-Questions-Power/dp/0747532524&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;第一块石头&lt;/a>;”，一部关于性骚扰案件的非小说类作品，立即成为最好的作品卖方。读者很快注意到 V 花了很多时间和住在附近的一位画家待在一起；将近三年零一百五十页有趣而令人痛苦的书页过去后，加纳意识到她的丈夫有外遇。从很多方面来说，这都是一本关于嫉妒的书。在出版前八个月，Bail 发布了一本回忆录，名为“&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/He-Murray-Bail-ebook/dp/B08KTRG1R4” data-event-click =&quot;{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.amazon.com/He-Murray-Bail-ebook/dp/B08KTRG1R4&quot;}&quot;

aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;我问加纳，贝尔对“如何结束一个故事”有何看法。她说，他本想“用火焰将其击落”。 “但他坚信言论自由。他非常了解艺术家的尊严和特权。”她搅拌着咖啡，告诉我：“我认为日记是我最好的作品。部分原因是我在写作时没有考虑到读者，而且我不是根据别人的说法而写作，而且我也没有因此获得报酬。写作纯粹是为了乐趣，并试图了解我生活中发生的事情。”她向前倾身，用食指抚摸我笔记本磨损的一角。在我礼貌地把它移到她够不到的地方之前，她举起手臂做了个手势，把咖啡打翻了。一名服务员过来帮忙。 “我做了一个疯狂的手势，它就飞了起来。”她告诉他。&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;我们喝完咖啡，走了过去。距加纳办公室五分钟路程，位于曾经的大都会肉类市场的二楼。现在它是一个艺术场所。从办公室的一扇窗户看到的景色是银色的屋顶和灰色的天空。加纳告诉我，她写人际关系是为了“抓住它们”，但在编辑“如何结束一个故事”时，她在夜间思考是否还有其他人如此软弱和无助。她只是把它当成工作，一点一点地去做，从而度过了难关。 “我发现，如果你继续往下走，你就会到达其他人都在的地方，”她说，坐在手肘灯旁边，摆弄着两条粗橡皮筋，将圆圈拉向彼此，直到他们只是碰触，然后又分开。后来，她告诉我，“如果这是我的故事，我想我一定是一个可怕的人。发现自己并不孤单，这让我松了一口气。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;加纳不确定她是否会再写书。她说，当她的办公室租约到期时，她考虑放弃，但这个想法让她感到害怕。一位画家朋友告诉她，每当她的工作室感觉不吸引人时，她就会把它从上到下打扫得干干净净。加纳也做了同样的事。 “然后我想，好吧，我今天就写一句话，以保持我的手，”她说。第二天她回去又写了一篇。这成了她的惯例。这些句子是关于她的一位患有痴呆症并且最近去世的朋友的。一句话：“窗子深陷，小而窄，垂直，如城墙上的槽，窗框内挂着精致的小帘子，下摆绣着花朵图案。”另一位：“她看到这些房间是错误的。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;夜色开始降临。我从悉尼飞到墨尔本，我们会在一起待几天。加纳建议，我们可以参观其他房子，而不是去她的家：她第一部小说的背景地、她写作时居住的房子、她拥有的第一栋房子。 “那么，也许你可以来我家，”她说，“沿着过道走，然后滚蛋！”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;第二天早上我们开着加纳的丰田车出发，去参观菲茨罗伊的一所房子北部，墨尔本郊区，加纳第一本书的大部分内容都发生在这里。 “在距离市中心一英里的拐角处的棕色老房子里，我们每天早上都吃培根作为早餐，”小说开头。 “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Monkey-Grip-Helen-Garner/dp/0140049533&quot;

rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;Monkey Grip&lt;/a>;” 设定于 1974 年末；加纳于 1975 年开始写这本书。每天，她都会送爱丽丝去学校，然后去图书馆，坐在一张桌子旁，一侧打开日记，另一侧放一本笔记本。小说的叙述者诺拉是一位年轻的母亲，住在菲茨罗伊的合租屋里，那里有一群二三十岁的嬉皮士经常光顾。她正在和一个叫马丁的男人约会，但很快就爱上了海洛因成瘾的贾沃。几年前，《Monkey Grip》是唯一一本入选 BBC 一百个“塑造世界的故事”清单的澳大利亚书籍。&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;《Monkey Grip》捕捉到了小说中很少见的澳大利亚风情：都市、平凡、对夏天和游泳的痴迷。但真正与众不同的是诺拉的声音：理智、自我批评，却又无可奈何地陷入爱河；对性很好，对毒品也很实事求是。该小说立即畅销，加纳成为第一位获得澳大利亚国家图书委员会年度图书奖的女性。在墨尔本长大、后来由加纳执导剧本的电影制片人吉莉安·阿姆斯特朗 (Gillian Armstrong) 告诉我，当她回家探望家人时，她仍然会想起《猴握》中的角色。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;喜欢就加纳的所有作品而言，这本书可能被视为对某种感觉审查制度的回应。加纳在港口城市吉朗长大，是六个孩子中最大的一个。她是英国圣公会高中排名最高的学生，然后去了墨尔本大学，在那里她参加了派对并获得了三等学位。她搬回家并担任英语老师，但是，在她的父亲读到她收到的大学男性朋友的来信后，他试图没收她的避孕药具。她搬了出去，在伦敦找到了一份教学工作，在那里她爱上了她在大学认识的比尔·加纳。她写信给父母说，他们要一起回来，通过陆路穿越欧洲和亚洲。她以为他们会祝她在这次大冒险中一切顺利，或者询问比尔的情况；但她并没有这么做。相反，他们说，如果她经历了这一切，她就不应该再费心联系他们或她的兄弟姐妹。比尔和海伦在墨尔本结婚了。加纳的母亲和妹妹琳达出席了仪式，但她的父亲拒绝了。&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto “ data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;41x9id&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot;

data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Alice 出生于 1969 年。那时，Garner 正在参加在朋友客厅举办的女权主义意识提高小组，她说，他们“坐在一起，脱口而出所有这些他们以前从未告诉过任何人的事情”。很快，她和比尔就分居了，1972 年，加纳开始在菲茨罗伊高中任教。这些学生大多来自工薪阶层、移民家庭。有一天，加纳准备给 13 岁的孩子们上一堂关于古希腊的课，这时他们在课本上注意到了一些东西。加纳后来在一篇关于这次经历的文章中写道：“除了少数几本外，所有的副本中都添加了一只巨大的鸡巴，其中有一股巨大的精液射中了靶心，正面是一个女人的阴户。”这位页面正在谦虚地展示爱奥尼亚石鳖的褶皱。”学生们无法安定下来。加纳告诉他们，“看，人们画这些图画的原因，以及我们嘲笑他们的原因，是因为性比其他任何事情都更有趣，而且因为学校里的大多数孩子对性的了解远不如他们了解的多。”他们需要这样做。你想谈谈吗？”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;她邀请他们写下问题，并承诺坦诚地回答。 （这篇文章的标题就是这样一个问题：“小姐，为什么女人要承受所有的痛苦？”）接下来的讨论就变成了一种随心所欲的来回讨论，最后一位学生真诚地好奇地问道：“小姐—— &lt;em>;你&lt;/em>;曾经吸过吗？” “有那么一刻，”加纳写道，“我从远处看到了情况：&lt;em>;一个孩子刚刚问她的老师她是否吸吮鸡巴&lt;/em>;。”她告诉他是的。对于加纳来说，这次经历是对当时澳大利亚缺乏性教育的一个有益的纠正。不久之后，她以笔名在一本名为《The Digger》的杂志上发表了有关此事的文章。该杂志因淫秽内容被罚款七百五十美元，而加纳很容易被认出来，因此被解雇了。几年后，当她写下《Monkey Grip》时，她依靠一种澳大利亚福利形式生活，当时称为“支持母亲福利金”。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;中午左右，我们转向法尔科纳街，把车停在了“Monkey Grip”的棕色老房子。现在是深紫色；自从加纳住在那里以来，菲茨罗伊经历了多次中产阶级化浪潮。她戴上一顶帽子，递给我一顶她为我打包的帽子。房子前有一个小花园，周围有完美的树篱和线条分明的白色鹅卵石。我们绕着一侧走，一只小猎犬的鼻子从后门下探出来，嗅着。加纳说，现任业主是两名法官，其中一位是她在维多利亚司法学院的研讨会上教过如何撰写判决书的。她说，她担心会遇到他。加纳提到当天还有其他几个人不想见到，其中包括另一位法官和一位疏远的朋友。当我们在菲茨罗伊的房屋之间行走时，她几乎压低了声音。有一次，她从邮箱里抓起一封邮件，检查她是否认识邮件所有者的名字。&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;我们前往菲茨罗伊浴场 (Fitzroy Baths)，这是一座深受人们喜爱的古老公共游泳池，《猴子之握》(Monkey Grip) 中的许多场景都在此发生。那是一个炎热、阳光明媚的下午。一名年轻女子猛地转过头，认出了加纳。泳池最深处的墙上用大字写着“&lt;em>;危险深水&lt;/em>;”和“&lt;em>;ACQUA PROFONDA&lt;/em>;”，这是对许多意大利人的善意警告，但拼写错误。第二次世界大战后抵达该地区的移民。在《猴子之握》的早期，诺拉在决定与马丁和贾沃一起去旅行之前发现了这个警告。 “所以，之后，你就有可能看到事情的开始，”加纳写道，“你已经陷入了困境，而当时你认为你只是用脚趾试水。”&lt;/p >;&lt;p>;加纳首次在澳大利亚杂志《月刊》上发表了她的日记摘录。然后她的出版商推荐了一本书。她告诉我，她烧掉了七十年代末之前的大部分日记，因为它们“要么是揭露性的，要么是令人尴尬的，要么是空洞的，这是我一生中从未使用过的词，直到这一刻。”读完后来的条目，她很惊讶地发现它们并不令人尴尬。她对她所说的“同时代证据”产生了兴趣。她说，如果日记是诚实的，当你读到它时，你会发现自己也是一个罪犯。&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com /Yellow-Notebook-Diaries-One-1978-1986/dp/1922268143&quot;

rel =&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;黄色笔记本：日记第一卷，1978-1986&lt;/a>;，”在《猴子之握》出版后开始。加纳搬到法国写她的下一本书，并遇到了农学家让-雅克·波泰尔。他和她一起搬到了澳大利亚；他们于 1980 年结婚。回到家后，加纳为她的第一部小说改编的电影编写了剧本。爱丽丝饰演诺拉的女儿；她获得了相当于澳大利亚奥斯卡奖的提名，并在决定攻读博士学位之前拥有成功的演艺生涯。并成为一名历史学家。在日记中，加纳有时对自己的养育方式很严厉，但爱丽丝告诉我，她的童年是幸福的。 “She&#39;s pretty hard on herself, and always has been,” Alice said, of her mother. But Alice had good relationships with a lot of different adults, learning music from one, sewing from another. “I feel like I was well looked after, and that she was around a lot,” she said. “But I think she sometimes looks back and sees something different, and thinks that she was neglectful. And I don&#39;t actually think she was.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Garner then wrote other screenplays, including “Two Friends,” about a pair of young friends, which became &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tag/jane-campion&quot;>;Jane Campion&lt;/a>;&#39;s first feature, in 1986. “We thought she was very sexy and beautiful and boyish, with her short hair and her beautiful skin and all that,” Campion told me, describing the moment when she and the producer Jan Chapman first met the writer. “She told us that she put oil on her skin all over her body after her baths and Jan and I were flabbergasted, and, like, &#39;God, we&#39;ve got to remember to do that.&#39; ” Later, Campion spent time with Garner at her house. The marriage with Portail was falling apart; he&#39;d fallen in love with Garner&#39;s sister Catherine, who is Garner&#39;s junior by nineteen years. (Catherine said that she moved out after Portail confessed his feelings for her, and only reconnected with him years later; they are still together.) “It was a strange atmosphere,” Campion told me, “and I felt for her because she was really uncomfortable. But she was super generous, super kind. She really wanted to share with me how important details are to her. The truth of small domestic details—the cup on a windowsill.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The collapse of the marriage inspired another screenplay, “The Last Days of Chez Nous,” later directed by Gillian Armstrong. Garner wanted a likable actor to play the husband, Armstrong told me; in her view, it was not a story about a man who&#39;d ruined a marriage on his own. (Bruno Ganz got the part.) “I mean, she&#39;s very honest about her own bad behavior,” Armstrong said.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;vo79l8&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Garner&#39;s early work earned her a reputation as a feminist; she has described all her books as “the story of fighting with my father, and of course, by extension, fighting all others who represent the father-figure to me, like big institutions, powerful men, expert knowledge and theory and all those sorts of things.” Then, in 1992, two students at the University of Melbourne went to the police to accuse the master of Ormond College, Alan Gregory, of groping them at a party. (Gregory denied the claims and was ultimately cleared of sexual-assault charges in court.) Garner read about the case and found herself sympathizing, at least initially, with Gregory. “He touched her breast and she went to the &lt;em>;cops&lt;/em>;?” Garner recalls asking friends. She wrote Gregory a letter, telling him that it was “heartbreaking, for a feminist of nearly fifty like me, to see our ideals of so many years distorted into this ghastly punitiveness.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;That letter is included the book that Garner went on to write about the case, “The First Stone: Some Questions About Sex and Power.” It was published in Australia in 1995 and in the US two years later. Gregory photocopied Garner&#39;s letter and showed it to people; the young women who made the accusations against him read the letter and refused to talk to her. As Janet Malcolm, one of Garner&#39;s heroes, wrote in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://archives.newyorker.com/newyorker/1997-07-07/flipbook&quot;>;review&lt;/a>; of the book, for this magazine, Garner “did what a journalist must never do—she showed her hand too early.” But Garner told me that the young women&#39;s refusal hardened her determination to write the book. Later, they tried to stop it from being published, threatening to take Garner to court and applying, unsuccessfully, for access to her notes, transcripts, drafts, and diaries. (The book&#39;s first run was pulped ahead of publication after a journalist pointed out a moment where readers might be able to identify the complainants, who, along with Gregory, are given pseudonyms in the book.) “The First Stone” divided critics and was lambasted by academics. It also sold as briskly as “Monkey Grip” had. But, when I asked Lisa Lucas, the publisher at Pantheon who bought Garner&#39;s back catalogue, about the book, she said she hadn&#39;t read it: it wasn&#39;t part of the submission, she said, and Pantheon didn&#39;t buy it.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Garner agreed to pay a visit with me to Ormond College, where she hadn&#39;t been since she wrote the book, thirty years earlier. The campus is dominated by turreted neo-Gothic buildings surrounded by pathways lined with flowers and small trees. We arrived to find a locked security gate; Garner began to turn around, but a student happened to be leaving just at that moment and let us in. “This place gives me the creeps,” Garner said, as we entered. We kept coming to dead ends and turning back. “See, I always think I&#39;ll get stuck,” she said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I asked Garner whether she might have reached different conclusions if the accusers had spoken to her. “Quite possibly,” she said. “I might not have even written the book.” In the past few years, she told me, she has thought about how she hasn&#39;t really had a job since 1972. “And I really had no experience of the way that women get treated in institutions. I have no experience of an institutional working life.” As we walked around the campus, she described the vitriolic reactions the book generated, which surprised her. “You really can&#39;t imagine the shit I got for that book,” she said. “It was very, very bad.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;It wasn&#39;t just Garner who got shit for the book: when it was first published, Alice told me, strangers used to approach her to argue about her mother&#39;s opinions. These days, she said, women come up to her saying how much they love her mother&#39;s work. “Sometimes it&#39;s annoying,” she added, laughing. Garner&#39;s sister Linda, a retired nurse and hospital chaplain, told me that her sister came up in a reading group of hers recently, and one of the women said, “I think what Helen doesn&#39;t realize is that we&#39;re not all as brave as she is.” (I asked Linda if she&#39;d read the diaries; she said she stopped after the first volume. “What&#39;s hard about the diaries,” she said, “is that I feel it would be possible to drown in Helen&#39;s memories. It&#39;s taken me a long time to give authority to my own memories of growing up.”)&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;We didn&#39;t stay at Ormond long—we were in and out in about ten minutes. It was enough. “I can&#39;t tell you how sick I felt being there,” Garner said as we climbed back into her car.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Later that day, Garner told me that she has looked back on the period after she was fired from Fitzroy High, and was desperate for a job, and has wondered, “partly as a fantasy, partly as a joke,” why she didn&#39;t become a cop. She admires the “unshockability” of good police officers, she said. Although her writing exhibits a high degree of control, the Helen Garner we meet in her nonfiction is not unruffled; she tends to expose herself as fully as possible to the most difficult emotions in a story. In 1999, Garner began following the case of two women, Anu Singh and Madhavi Rao, who were accused of murdering a man named Joe Cinque, Singh&#39;s boyfriend, after Singh injected him with a lethal dose of heroin. Singh&#39;s defense was one of “diminished responsibility,” on account of mental illness; she was convicted of manslaughter, rather than murder, and eventually served just four years of a ten-year sentence. Rao was acquitted of all charges. Having seen Cinque&#39;s mother, Maria, at court, Garner spent time with her, trying to comprehend her overwhelming grief, then wrote a book, “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Joe-Cinques-Consolation-Story-Death/dp/0330421786&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Joe-Cinques-Consolation-Story-Death/dp/0330421786&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Joe-Cinques-Consolation-Story-Death/dp/0330421786&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;Joe Cinque&#39;s Consolation&lt;/a>;,” that is largely about the inadequacy of the justice system. Cinque&#39;s death “billowed like a dark curtain on every breeze that blew,” Garner wrote in her journal at the time, according to her biographer, Bernadette Brennan. “It seeped into everything I did.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In Australia, most trials are open to the public. I suggested to Garner that we go to one together. She wrote me an e-mail that night: “I checked the Supreme Court lists for tomorrow, and there&#39;s a part-heard trial of a guy called Hudson Martin who&#39;s accused of having killed a grandfather with a baseball bat in a Christmas Day brawl. Woman judge.” The next day, after having sandwiches near the courthouse, we made our way through security, past the court library—where, Garner said, she used to “feast on judgments”—and into the courtroom, decorated with cornices molded into seashells and flowers. We took our seats. “Before the lunch break,” the prosecutor began, “you told us that you heard a massive bang.” We were off.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The accused sat at the back, his hands clasped on the table before him. He had short hair and wore a tidy suit. His barrister maintained that he&#39;d swung the bat in self-defense. The prosecutor called one of his friends to the stand and asked several questions about a young woman named Chloe; he and the others had been drinking at her house before the alleged crime. “I don&#39;t know what you want me to say,” the friend kept repeating. Garner quietly took my notebook and pen. “He&#39;s the most hopeless, helpless witness I&#39;ve EVER SEEN,” she wrote.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;When court adjourned, we rushed to Queensmith, a small, hip bar nearby. Garner wanted to know more about Chloe; I wanted to know whether the friend was protecting Martin out of love or fear. (Martin was found not guilty.) Garner seemed pleased by my interest. In “This House of Grief,” Garner also attends a trial with a companion—a friend&#39;s daughter, Louise, then sixteen and on a gap year. A man named Robert Farquharson had been charged with drowning his three sons, ages ten, seven, and two, by driving his sedan into a dam; the presence of Louise alternately highlights and relieves the mournfulness of the book. (Farquharson was convicted.) Garner is candid about her emotions, analyzing them with a degree of remove which allows her to illustrate, with an unsparing empathy, how irrational we all can be, and how little we understand of our own behavior, let alone that of those around us.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Early on our second day together, Garner told me a scandalous story about a writer she knew well. It was somewhat shocking, and would be, I quickly realized, almost impossible to confirm. My notebook and recording device were on the table; this was clearly on the record. But, as she spoke, I wondered whether she was telling it on purpose.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Two days later, Garner suggested that we drive out to her sister Linda&#39;s small house in the Victorian countryside, Primrose Gully, roughly two hours away. This would make going to Garner&#39;s own house out of the question—she had hinted the previous afternoon that it might be possible after all, because none of her family would be there—but I had one more day, and decided not to mention it. Before we left, Garner brought up what she came to call the Terrible Story.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Listen, I don&#39;t want you to put anything about that in the article,” she said. I told her that I was unlikely to—I wasn&#39;t sure it was relevant—but that I couldn&#39;t agree not to. We then climbed into her car for what now risked being a tense two-hour drive. Worse, it was a public holiday, and we were soon stuck in standstill traffic as others fled the city. “Look,” Garner said, “we can go past my house, and go to the toilet. You can see my toilet,” she added, laughing.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The grass outside the house was soft with clover and miniature white daisies, her small front yard covered with the large leaves of violet plants not yet in bloom. The kitchen was slightly messy, and on her dining table was a copy of &lt;em>;The New York Review of Books&lt;/em>;, open to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2021/07/22/jacqueline-rose-power-of-questions/&quot;>;review&lt;/a>; of Jacqueline Rose&#39;s “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Violence-Against-Women/dp/0374284210&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Violence-Against-Women/dp/0374284210&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Violence-Against-Women/dp/0374284210&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;On Violence and on Violence Against Women&lt;/a>;,” with bits underlined in pen. (“Boys and men are taught that masculinity means an absurd omnipotence, mastery, comfort, and prowess. They fail—how could they not?—to live up to that ideal.”) Also on the table were pale-yellow daffodils, dark-yellow nasturtiums, and the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary. The giant book&#39;s cover creaked as I opened it, and inside was a note: it had been given to Garner by housemates on Falconer Street, in 1974, the year before she started “Monkey Grip.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Garner took me out to the back yard, walked up to the chicken coop, and sweetly greeted the chickens. She let them out and gave them water and some weeds. We had lunch, then got into the car and drove until we reached wide-open plains, fields of bright-yellow rapeseed. We talked about Australian roadkill, of which, unusually, there had been none so far. “The wallabies are the saddest, because they always look like they are holding a little handbag,” Garner said.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;3hgowr&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;il4ae&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Primrose Gully is three small buildings on a steep piece of land: one with a living room and kitchen, one for the outhouse, and one where people sleep. It once belonged to a friend of Garner&#39;s. She later bought it, then sold it to Portail, who finally sold it to Linda. Really, it seemed to belong to the birds—an eagle tipped its wing over the gully below us, upsetting magpies everywhere; wrens darted through bushes and into a birdbath. In the second volume of her diaries, Garner refers to the home again and again. “At Primrose Gully, a night of the most perfect stillness, hardly a sound, colossal wheeling fields of stars, and very late a small bright moon, lying on its back,” she writes.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Garner knew at an early age that she didn&#39;t want her mother&#39;s life of domestic work. It wasn&#39;t, though, that she minded the work itself. She liked the process of establishing order, the promise of a result. When she was first married to Bill, she remembered, she would sweep their staircase every Saturday morning. “It was a vigorous job, and it had to be done, and I wanted to do it,” she said. “And it was the sort of thing it would never have occurred to him to do.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Instead, she turned the marshalling of domestic details into art. This is most visible in “The Children&#39;s Bach,” which Garner wrote in the early eighties, and which has probably done the most to kindle interest in her writing in the US It centers on the home of a married couple, Athena and Dexter, who are visited by an old friend of Dexter&#39;s named Elizabeth, and her lover, Philip. Soon, Athena begins to spend time away from Dexter and with Philip instead. Garner based the characters on people she knew, but imagined the scenario—the people she turned into couples in the book had never met in real life.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The book is written in the close third person, and perspectives change between characters almost without signal, so that you are not quite sure, at first, who is kissing whom in the kitchen, and who is watching; for brief moments, you inhabit one interior life after another. “It&#39;s brutally and elegantly efficient,” the writer Ben Lerner told me. He heard about Garner from another writer, Jenny Offill, then fell in love with “The Children&#39;s Bach.” Writers were “passing it back and forth” among each other, he said. The novel, in his view, is about “the ways art influences us or connects us or pushes us however slightly towards transgression in our daily lives.” Eventually, he wrote an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/books/second-read/unheard-melodies-on-helen-garners-the-childrens-bach&quot;>;introduction&lt;/a>; to a new edition of the book. What he and Garner share, he said, is the idea “that fiction is not only about illuminating other minds, or giving you access to other people&#39;s experience, but also about running up against the unknowability of the self and other.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Sitting on the small deck at Primrose Gully, Garner watched the birds for a while, then started to speak. “I remember I had just moved from the apartment in Elizabeth Bay after Murray and I split up, and I was lying in this bed with the window open, which I was never allowed to do when we were together, and I thought, Oh, I&#39;ve died and gone to Heaven,” she said. (Bail disputed this description.) I thought of a moment on the last pages of “How to End a Story,” from that same period. She is in that new apartment, and has “moved a cane chair into the bedroom so I can survey my view,” she writes. “I sit there in the early evenings and contemplate it.” Then she adds, “One day I&#39;ll be light-hearted again. I swear I will. I will work my way there.” ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;0nw5di&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot;

has traced crime, greed, and corruption across American life. In his new film, he turns his gaze to the violence of whiteness. Set in nineteen-twenties Oklahoma, “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-front-row/the-silent-thunder-of-killers-of-the-flower-moon&quot;>;Killers of the Flower Moon&lt;/a>;” tells the story of a series of murders targeting the people of the Osage Nation, perpetrated by white settlers in pursuit of the community&#39;s oil wealth. On this episode of Critics at Large, the staff writers Vinson Cunningham, Naomi Fry, and Alexandra Schwartz discuss the trajectory of Scorsese&#39;s style, from the “whirling limbs” and “short, sharp cuts” of films like “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/scorseses-achievement-with-goodfellas&quot;>;Goodfellas&lt;/a>;” to the elegiac restraint of more recent works like “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-front-row/watching-the-irishman-on-netflix-is-the-best-way-to-see-it&quot;>;The Irishman&lt;/a>;.” They&#39;re joined by &lt;em>;The New Yorker&#39;s&lt;/em>; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/david-grann-the-osage-murders-and-the-birth-of-the-fbi&quot;>;David Grann&lt;/a>;, the author of &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Killers-Flower-Moon-Osage-Murders/dp/0385534248&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Killers-Flower-Moon-Osage-Murders/dp/0385534248&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Killers-Flower-Moon-Osage-Murders/dp/0385534248&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;the 2017 book&lt;/a>; that formed the basis for Scorsese&#39;s film, who describes how he first came upon the story and how members of the Osage community became involved in—and responded to—the adaptation. Then the hosts consider the multilayered coda of the film, which raises increasingly pressing questions about representation and ownership. “Killers of the Flower Moon” recounts the atrocities committed against the Osage, but it&#39;s also an indictment of racialized evil writ large. “The trauma of this experience of course belongs most intimately to the Osage people,” Cunningham says. “But the proclivities that gave rise to it, the sensibilities that survive in our culture today—that&#39;s something that every person that has anything to do with the United States needs to engage with.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;New episodes drop every Thursday.

Based on two lacerating, Surrealist Luis Buñuel films, “The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie” and “The Exterminating Angel,” it had, at various times in its decade of development, been called “Buñuel” and a title that Sondheim announced in a television interview—“Square One,” a reference to the work&#39;s preoccupation with recursion and stasis.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Sondheim, a dizzyingly complex lyricist with an unparalleled ear for syncopation and sour-sweet harmonies, could seemingly turn anything into a musical: a 1934 Kaufman and Hart play (“Merrily We Roll Along”), a Victorian penny dreadful (“Sweeney Todd”), a Post-Impressionist painting (“Sunday in the Park with George”). According to David Ives, a comic playwright best known for the claustrophobic “Venus in Fur,” and the director Joe Mantello, who won a Tony for his direction of the 2004 production of Sondheim&#39;s “Assassins,” the composer was still creatively sharp yet somehow unable to make progress on the Buñuel show&#39;s second act. Buoyed by the reading, Ives and Mantello apparently convinced Sondheim that they could complete it by using what he had already written and leaving the second half mostly without songs. The situation itself is surreal: the legendary Sondheim, like Penelope in the Odyssey, weaving and unravelling, promising and procrastinating—and then, after all delaying tactics fail, watching as the tapestry is cut from the loom.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;This tapestry, with its associated loose threads, became “Here We Are,” now in a handsome, starry production at the Shed, in Hudson Yards. Simultaneously the last Sondheim musical and the lost one, it contains familiar textures: barbs aimed at his own rarefied social set (there&#39;s tart treatment for those who clone their dogs), a measure of “Company” &#39;s loving-hurtful friends, and “Merrily” &#39;s bitter conviction that wealth kills creativity. Despite the multivalent talents of Ives and Mantello, though, the piece, finished without Sondheim, cannot mend the ragged edge torn by his absence.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;For the first act, Buñuel&#39;s dream-film about upper-crust corruption, “The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie,” from 1972, has been streamlined and modernized. We meet the brash, tracksuit-wearing one-per-center Leo (Bobby Cannavale) and his daffy wife, Marianne (Rachel Bay Jones), who&#39;s still in her nightgown. It&#39;s midmorning, and they aren&#39;t expecting company. But phone rings, door chimes, in come their dearest friends—a plastic surgeon, Paul (Jeremy Shamos), his power-agent wife, Claudia (Amber Gray), and Raffael (Steven Pasquale), a lustful ambassador from the made-up country of Moranda—all insisting that they&#39;ve been invited for brunch. Marianne&#39;s sister, Fritz (Micaela Diamond), a self-styled anticapitalist revolutionary, is borne along by the pack, which proceeds, in absurd(ist) fashion, to a series of cafés, none of which, for some reason, can feed them.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;The set designer David Zinn presents Leo and Marianne&#39;s apartment as a gleaming white box, as glassy as an Apple store, with a knockoff Damien Hirst dot painting in a corner. (Zinn also designed the costumes, and Hirst&#39;s gelato-bright shades show up in the characters&#39; clothes, like Leo&#39;s &lt;em>;frutti di bosco&lt;/em>; tracksuit.) At the klatsch&#39;s first stop, Café Everything, there&#39;s absolutely nothing in the kitchen. “I am so sorry, Madam,” the waiter (Denis O&#39;Hare, as slimy as two eels) sings in the show&#39;s crispest, patteriest number: “We do expect a little latte later / But we haven&#39;t got a lotta latte now.” (I sat in a row with other critics; this lyric prompted a great bustling of pens.)&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Along the way, the group is serenaded by a grieving waitress (Tracie Bennett, her voice beautifully weary) and joined by a rat-a-tat colonel (François Battiste) and a lieutenant (the exhilarating Jin Ha), who instantly falls for Fritz. Marianne remains the most blithe of the posse—even clues that society is breaking down around them can&#39;t diminish her enthusiasm. “Buy this day for us, sweetheart!” she sings to Leo. After each café, Leo tells his entourage, “Back to square one, everybody into the car!” Mantello articulates these resets by lining the characters up on the blank white stage, flanked by dioramas of a grassy field. It&#39;s an image borrowed from Buñuel, but it also makes the adventurers seem as if they&#39;re off to see the Wizard. Marianne, in a baby-blue silk peignoir, is our Dorothy; she certainly seems to be the one having the dream.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The group ends up at Raffael&#39;s embassy, where a nervous bishop thinking about changing careers (David Hyde Pierce, magnetically kind as always) joins them. In the second act, which adapts the “No Exit”-like “Exterminating Angel,” from 1962, the whole gaggle, bishop included, find themselves mysteriously trapped in Raffael&#39;s black-panelled library, along with two servants, played by Bennett and O&#39;Hare. After a lifetime of making out like bandits, the rich have to make do. Following one last gorgeously sung hymn from Marianne, existential paralysis sets in, and the songs stop. For the last forty-five minutes, Sondheim&#39;s musical presence is communicated mainly via underscoring, thanks to his gifted longtime arranger, Jonathan Tunick, and a vamp, one of his broken-in-the-middle arpeggios, that shocks the characters whenever they try to leave. This purgatorial situation is, of course, deliberately frustrating, and other perversities of “Here We Are” occasionally serve that mood: for instance, the choice to have the non-singers, like O&#39;Hare and Pierce, deliver solos in the first act, while the generational voices, like Gray and Pasquale, perform only small portions of ensemble numbers. (Hell is being at a Sondheim musical with so many great singers not singing.)&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I felt the composer&#39;s absence even more, though, as a guiding intellect. Surely the turn to sentiment in the second half was uncharacteristic? After all, Sondheim was our bard of ambivalence. The Buñuel films glint with class warfare: the parasitic rich are gunned down at dinner in a dream sequence in “Bourgeoisie”; in “Angel,” literal lambs run to their slaughter, barbecued on the charred splinters of a cello. But “Here We Are” has taken that same dramaturgy-as-bayonet and dulled it—mainly through sympathy for sweet Marianne and the gentle bishop, who finally discovers a talent for pastoral care. Ives has also bougified and depoliticized the story to the point that the only clearly villainous character is one of the servants, which upends Buñuel&#39;s social critique. The central metaphor moves from patrician complicity with totalitarianism to, seemingly, the “square one” of &lt;em >;COVID&lt;/em>; isolation, in which many of us were at the mercy of our inner resources. There&#39;s even a little coda in which the characters tell us what they most “miss about the room.” No one says sourdough, but I worry they were thinking it.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;At the Shed, unfortunate resonances emerge between the “Here We Are” scenario and the venue itself, a chilly culture palace, which contains a discombobulating stack of escalators that switch directions when you&#39;re not looking. You do carry warmth away, though, as you wander out of Hudson Yards. The rest of the city, like a huge singing wake, is full of Sondheim now, with stunning revivals of “Sweeney” and “Merrily” on Broadway and a concert staging of “The Frogs,” one of his deeper cuts, coming to Jazz at Lincoln Center. Even though the Sondheimiest stuff drains away at the two-thirds point in “Here We Are,” the evening is still full of a certain familiar sonic pattern, an only-Steve-could-do-it interval, which hops jarringly upward in the middle of a phrase. It&#39;s earwormy, so it follows you out of the Shed, into the subway, and all the way home. You hear it, and know Sondheim has been somewhere nearby. Perhaps he was here and you missed him? Perhaps he&#39;s just in another room. ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;5upx9b&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;ctu06r&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 26 Oct 2023 19:06:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[The Mystery of Florida’s Flamingos]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.newyorker.com/science/elements/the-mystery-of-floridas-flamingos]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-26T10:00:00.000Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/652076ca72931f9be606028c/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/adno_flamingo_florida.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;article >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attribute-verso-pattern=&quot;article-body&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;ArticlePageChunks&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Two months ago, in the aftermath of Hurricane Idalia, Anna Yu, a park ranger in western Florida, heard a rumor from a local birder: for the first time in years, somebody had spotted a flamingo near Fort De Soto Park, where she works. When Yu returned to the park, which encompasses more than a thousand acres of islands, she cleared debris and took stock of what did and didn&#39;t flood. In her three years as a park ranger, she&#39;d seen storms collect weird things in their wake, but she&#39;d never seen a flamingo. Then her radio crackled with the voice of another ranger. “A flamingo just flew over North Beach,” he said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Yu drove her truck down a service road and walked out onto North Beach. There, in the distance, she saw a pink spray of feathers against the backdrop of a blue lagoon. Five flamingos were standing by the water. A few seconds later, they spread their wings. “They flew right over my head,” she told me. “That moment was so enchanting.” Later, in a stand of mangroves, she found another three, scanning the mud for food. She called it “the rarest encounter that I&#39;ll probably ever have out there.” What she couldn&#39;t figure out was where they had come from.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;That week, reports of flamingos lit up the state. A flock appeared along the causeway that leads to Sanibel Island. More than a dozen dipped into a tide pool on Treasure Island. Another five landed near the mouth of Tampa Bay. By the time Fort De Soto Park reopened to the public, word had spread. Cars lined up before sunrise at North Beach, filled with Floridians who wanted a glimpse.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Florida&#39;s flamingos are a paradox. They&#39;re practically synonymous with the Sunshine State; more than twenty-three hundred Florida businesses have had the word “flamingo” in their name (and that&#39;s not even including Flamoongo LLC). But the birds are rare enough that few Floridians have ever seen one in the wild. In my thirty-two years in Florida, I had only seen captives in zoos. When I saw the news reports, I promised myself that, as soon as I was done dragging waterlogged furniture out of my parents&#39; house, I&#39;d find my own wild flamingo.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;That evening, near my home, in Sarasota, I slipped into the woods and hiked out to a spit of sand that divides a bayou from the Gulf of Mexico. I knew that black skimmers, bald eagles, and oystercatchers all nest there, and I thought a flamingo might turn up. I sweated through my clothes a few times before the sun set, but the only wildlife I could find were a few men in Speedos.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Back home, I sat on my porch and scrolled through forums, Facebook groups, and Instagram, trying to triangulate this elusive bird. I wanted to see the creature that was so central to the idea of Florida that it lent its name to Flamingo Auto Salvage, Flamingo Condo 69, and Flamingo Ham Shoppe. I read that one flamingo, spotted in the Florida Keys, was wearing bands on its legs, apparently from a scientific study in Mexico. Flamingos are not typically considered migratory birds. Could they have flown five hundred miles across the Yucatán Channel during a hurricane?&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;After clicking through a series of birder accounts, I saw an image of a flamingo, wading in a shallow pool with a radio tower in the frame. The location read “Pinellas County,” about fifty miles north of my house. I knew the area well enough to guess where the tower might be, so I called two friends and asked them if they wanted to go. We planned to leave before first light.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;For much of the past century, flamingos turned up in Florida now and then, but in tiny numbers. The scientific community tended to assume that these birds had escaped from captive populations, and were not native. But, in 2015, a pink bird landed on Boca Chica Key, at Naval Air Station Key West, and helped to rewrite the history of the American flamingo.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Initially, the Navy tried to scare its wayward flamingo away from a salt marsh between two airstrips. When that didn&#39;t work, someone called Frank Ridgley, Zoo Miami&#39;s head of conservation and research, and said that, unless someone captured the bird, they were going to kill it.&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Ridgley drove down to the base, taking with him a new hire, Steven Whitfield. They met with a team of wildlife specialists, caught the bird, and named him Conchy. They planned to band Conchy with a satellite transmitter, release him in Florida Bay, and see where he went. But, when they asked the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission for permission, the agency initially said no. Because “flamingos are not considered native,” the response said, “a permit would be needed” to release Conchy. (Curiously, a page on the agency&#39;s Web site also said that a species of flamingo “occurs naturally” and “was formerly abundant” in South Florida.)&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Whitfield, who had originally trained as a tropical-frog biologist, suspected that the scientific consensus about Floridian flamingos was wrong. “It&#39;s often not clear what actually belongs here and what doesn&#39;t,” he told me. He and his colleagues started looking for scientific evidence. “We found accounts of naturalists in the eighteen-hundreds that would describe flamingos,” he said. “But these were isolated things.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;One early American record of a flamingo appeared in “Letters from the Frontiers,” an 1827 account by a military officer named George A. McCall. He spotted the bird near Anclote Key, about thirty-five miles north of where Yu works. He wrote of the “brilliant hues my eyes dwelt upon in an ecstasy of delight.” But, after the glow of discovery dimmed, he put a bullet in the bird, carried it back to camp, and cut out its tongue to eat. Apparently, flamingo tongue was a delicacy in ancient Rome.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Five years later, John James Audubon, who had been looking for the birds, went sailing west of Islamorada, in the Upper Keys. “The ocean around glittered in its quiet beauty, and the light fleecy clouds that here and there spotted the heavens, seemed flakes of snow margined with gold,” Audubon wrote. Then he saw a flock of flamingos cutting a line across the sky. “I thought I had now reached the height of all my expectations, for my voyage to the Floridas was undertaken in a great measure for the purpose of studying these lovely birds in their own beautiful islands.” When Audubon completed his “Birds of America” portfolio, in 1838, it included a painting called “American Flamingo.” A peculiar bird, so pink that it borders on neon, cranes its neck toward the ground. That image haunted me as a kid, and I never forgot it.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In other nineteenth-century accounts, Whitfield found references to a brisk trade in bird plumes—and pink feathers were especially prized. One tiny town in the southern Everglades, where residents made their living fishing and plume hunting, even adopted the name Flamingo. But the sightings seemed to end there. “Around 1900, the reports of flamingos just stopped,” Whitfield told me. He wondered whether the frenzy for feathers had driven the bird nearly to extinction.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Strangely, the disappearance of Floridian flamingos coincided with their ascension to cultural ubiquity. On New Year&#39;s Eve, 1920, the Flamingo Hotel, a pink behemoth on Biscayne Bay, opened its doors. A few years later, the hotel imported six flamingos from Africa to attract guests. And, in the thirties, twenty to thirty flamingos were captured in Cuba and released in the center of the Hialeah racetrack, north of Miami. They quickly vanished—a biologist soon reported a sighting not far south, along Card Sound Road—but a second group of captives stayed put, and their descendants still live in Hialeah today.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Around the time that Elizabeth Bishop described Florida as the “state full of long S-shaped birds,” in 1946, flamingo designs started to appear on homes, cocktail menus, and monogrammed shirts. Some residents even released flamingos outside their homes, as living ornaments. In 1984, the Hialeah captives appeared in the opening credits for “Miami Vice”; in 1988, the state lottery chose the flamingo as its mascot. But, throughout those decades, flamingo sightings were incredibly rare, and the birds were usually assumed to be fugitives from the racetrack.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;When it came to releasing Conchy the flamingo, the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission relented after internal discussions and exchanges with Zoo Miami. Some flamingos, the commission said, were “vagrant native” birds that did not require a permit to be released. In December, 2015, with the agency&#39;s blessing, Ridgley placed a satellite band on Conchy&#39;s leg. The bird bounced around the Everglades for a couple of years, confirming that Florida could sustain flamingos year-round. Then, soon after Hurricane Irma passed, in 2017, the signal went dead.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;esp3a&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;gqunjb&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Ridgley, Whitfield, and their collaborators eventually published a study of flamingos in Florida. Two scientists at Audubon Florida, Jerry Lorenz and Pete Frezza, gave Whitfield a modern time line of sightings going back to 1999. He also searched natural-history-museum collections. If flamingos weren&#39;t native to Florida, he wouldn&#39;t expect to find early records of their nests. “What was really weird is that a flamingo egg popped up,” Whitfield told me. Written on a shell in the American Museum of Natural History, in red ink, was the word “Florida.” He found four more eggs, along with twenty-nine flamingo specimens from Florida, in other collections. He and his collaborators sent all of their findings to the commission.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In its 2018 paper, the team argued that plume hunting had driven the American flamingo out of America; in the Caribbean basin as a whole, hunting and development cut fifty nesting sites to fewer than ten. Around that time, a spokeswoman for the commission told the Miami &lt;em>;Herald&lt;/em>; that the agency had changed the bird&#39;s designation to native, though she didn&#39;t say when. Recently, when I reached out to the commission, a spokesperson wrote to me that “a growing body of evidence over the years suggests that at least some American flamingos living in Florida have arrived on their own from outside of the state.” It&#39;s now clear that the American flamingo was, and still is, native to Florida.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Many of the scientists who have studied flamingos over the years have noticed the curious association between sightings and storms. After Hurricane Michael lashed the Florida Panhandle, in 2018, a lone flamingo was spotted in the St. Marks National Wildlife Refuge; locals named it Pinky. After Hurricane Idalia made landfall, in late August, there were more reported sightings of flamingos in Florida than there were in the entire twentieth century. A flock joined Pinky in the Panhandle, ending a five-year stretch of solitude. Others turned up as far north as Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. “It&#39;s not clear why now,” Whitfield told me.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Andrew Farnsworth, a senior research associate at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, helped to explain the hurricane-flamingo connection. As a five-year-old, Farnsworth became fascinated by the movements of birds; when he started work as a researcher, he discovered historical records of epic avian journeys. In the late eighteen-hundreds, trade winds carried the cattle egret nearly two thousand miles from Africa to South America. Later, egrets expanded their territory and migrated to Florida, where they nest to this day. Sometimes, sudden rain or headwinds force migrating birds to settle in the closest available habitat. Mid-century biologists even had a term for this: the birds were said to “fall out.” “They drop into the nearest habitat they can find,” Farnsworth told me. “The combination of hurricane alley plus the trades can be a conveyor belt.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;To figure out why recent hurricanes seem to have carried so many flamingos into Florida, Farnsworth said, scientists might consider what made them take flight in the first place. Perhaps stormwater flooded their habitat, or high water temperatures threatened their source of food. “Thinking about the potential stress and then the vehicle to get them moving—that starts to tell the story of what&#39;s going on,” he told me.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;A flamingo named Peaches, who was found swimming near St. Pete Beach, could help solve the mystery. Last month, Lorenz and Ridgley banded Peaches, who was released along the eastern rim of Fort De Soto Park. “Whatever Peaches does, we&#39;re going to learn so much,” Ridgley said. Perhaps the bird will fly back to a breeding population in Mexico or Cuba, where scientists can study the reasons that flamingos are in flux. Lately, he&#39;s been wondering, Could hurricanes be the event that helps reintroduce the flamingo back to Florida permanently?&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The morning after my fruitless visit to Speedo Beach, my friends and I drove to Pinellas County and stopped near a lagoon. In the blue light of dawn, high on adrenaline, we spotted the radio tower that I had seen on Instagram. We ran down to the water&#39;s edge and took stock of the birds: a few egrets, some pelicans, but no flamingos. We pulled up an aerial view of the islands and decided to drive north, toward a little thumb of sand.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;A mile down the road, we parked, climbed out, and ran through the dunes to another beach. This time, the rising sun lit up a pink blur on the white sand. A lone flamingo was walking along the edge of the lagoon. The adrenaline faded, and a calm washed over me. Here was the mythical creature I&#39;d looked at countless times, but never actually seen.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;A moment later, a stranger with a camera crossed the flamingo&#39;s line of sight. The bird flared the black tips of its wings, flew over the dunes, and slipped into a gap in the mangroves. As quietly as we could, we followed.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Encircled by trees, we found another three flamingos wading, talking to one another with a hoarse honking noise. For a few moments, we watched them and whispered among ourselves. Then we turned to go, leaving them to what we hoped would become their home. ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;ecczj&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 26 Oct 2023 19:06:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[How Mike Johnson Went from Relative Obscurity to Speaker of the House]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/how-mike-johnson-went-from-relative-obscurity-to-speaker-of-the-house]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-25T22:57:23.018Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65397916faa7f50ba0802f28/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Blizter-Mike-Johnson-10-25-23.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;article >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attribute-verso-pattern=&quot;article-body&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;ArticlePageChunks&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;On Wednesday morning, after House Republicans nominated Representative Mike Johnson, of Louisiana, as their fourth candidate for Speaker in a span of three weeks, many in Washington were forced to admit how little they knew about the man who was about to be second in line for the Presidency. The Republican senator Susan Collins &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://twitter.com/foxreports/status/1717169079071494175&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://twitter.com/foxreports/status/1717169079071494175&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/foxreports/status/1717169079071494175&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;said&lt;/a>; she&#39;d have to Google him. In a conference of bracing personalities, Johnson&#39;s relative anonymity to the wider world was an advantage. Trim and bespectacled, with dark hair and a youthful face, he blends in rather than stands out. Democrats call him “Jim Jordan in a coat,” because of his history of taking radically conservative positions—especially on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tag/2020-election&quot;>;2020 election&lt;/a>;, which he refused to certify—and presenting them with lawyerly polish. Hours before Johnson won the vote on the House floor, on Wednesday afternoon, without a single Republican defection, I asked a former senior GOP aide how moderate members could justify voting &lt;em>;against&lt;/em>; Jordan but &lt;em>;for&lt;/em>; Johnson. Their politics are nearly indistinguishable; Johnson, who sits on Jordan&#39;s Judiciary Committee, once compared their relationship to being “like Batman and Robin.” The aide replied, “Have you ever heard of Mike Johnson?”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Johnson, a fifty-one-year-old constitutional lawyer, came to Washington the same year &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tag/donald-trump&quot;>;Donald Trump&lt;/a>; did. He had served briefly in the Louisiana state house, but he was better known as an attorney pursuing conservative causes. “Some people are called to pastoral ministry,” he &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.baptistmessage.com/mike-johnson-faith-family-freedom-motivate-run-seat-us-congress/&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.baptistmessage.com/mike-johnson-faith-family-freedom-motivate-run-seat-us-congress/&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.baptistmessage.com/mike-johnson-faith-family-freedom-motivate-run-seat-us-congress/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;said&lt;/a>;, when he first ran for Congress. “I was called to legal ministry, and I&#39;ve been out on the front lines of the &#39;culture war.&#39; ” As an attorney and spokesperson for the Alliance Defending Freedom, a right-wing advocacy organization, he appeared twice before the Louisiana Supreme Court to defend the state&#39;s ban on same-sex marriage. Within a few years in Washington, Johnson emerged as a trusted member of the Party—an unflinching partisan combatant in a conference lurching to the right. “Everyone likes him,” the former aide told me. He chaired the Republican Study Committee, the largest conservative faction in the House, and joined Trump&#39;s defense team during the President&#39;s first impeachment.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The key to Johnson&#39;s current standing among House Republicans is his role in the aftermath of the 2020 election. Trump&#39;s refusal to accept the result put his congressional supporters in a bind. Their base shared Trump&#39;s belief in the illegitimacy of the outcome, but privately the Party&#39;s top leaders admitted that the President was unhinged. Apostates such as Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger, who sat on the January 6th committee, have since been ostracized by the GOP But at the time even hard-right Republicans, including members of the notoriously obstructionist Freedom Caucus, were uncomfortable invalidating the vote. “History will judge this moment,” Chip Roy, the Texas Republican, said, in a closed-door Party meeting on January 5th. “If a majority of Republicans vote to reject the electors, it will irrevocably empower Congress to take over the selection of Presidential electors.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Johnson had proposed an alternative that allowed members to skirt the question. According to a detailed report, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/03/us/politics/republican-election-objectors.html&quot;>;published&lt;/a>; last year in the &lt;em>;Times&lt;/em>;, he suggested that House Republicans could vote against certifying the results not just because of fraud, which no one could prove, but on arcane legal grounds. “Constitutional infirmity,” Johnson called them. Many states had modified their voting procedures in response to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tag/coronavirus&quot;>;the pandemic&lt;/a>;. But in the process, he argued, they had violated the Constitution. According to Johnson&#39;s theory, they could only make changes to election protocol with the approval of each state&#39;s own legislature; as a result, Republicans could rule out the results. “I am a lawyer. I don&#39;t engage in conspiracy theory,” Johnson &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/q-and-a/why-representative-mike-johnson-thinks-that-the-election-isnt-over&quot;>;told my colleague&lt;/a>; Isaac Chotiner at the time. “I have gone to great lengths to say, &#39;We have to be intellectually consistent about this.&#39; It&#39;s not just about the support of Donald Trump in 2020. It&#39;s about the institutions themselves.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;That December, Johnson tweeted out his theory of the case around the time that the attorney general of Texas was filing a petition before the US Supreme Court to discount Joe Biden&#39;s wins in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, and Georgia. On the morning of December 9th, Johnson, who planned to submit an amicus brief in the case, was gathering signatures from House Republicans when he heard from Trump. “Someone showed the President my post, I guess, and he called me and said he was so glad we were doing this,” Johnson told Chotiner. Within an hour, Johnson wrote an e-mail to his colleagues with the subject line “Time sensitive message request from President Trump.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Dear Friends,” he began. “President Trump called me this morning to express his great appreciation for our effort to file an amicus brief in the Texas case on behalf of members of Congress.” Then, in bolded and underlined red type, he added, “He specifically asked me to contact all Republican members of the House and Senate today and request that all join on to our brief.” The next day, a hundred and five lawmakers signed on. Prominent leaders, including former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, held out—which enraged Trump. Within another day, twenty more had signed the letter. One of the last to do so, citing a technical glitch for his delay, was McCarthy.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;On Tuesday night, with the Party coalescing behind him, Johnson appeared on Capitol Hill to take questions from the press. Predictably, someone asked about the certification scheme. Johnson smiled and shook his head. The members surrounding him booed; one told the reporter to “shut up.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Johnson&#39;s power has followed from his discretion. In 2020, he managed to give Trump and the Republican base what they wanted, while claiming that he was plotting a principled course of his own. His canniness has paid off. Earlier this week, the Party&#39;s third-ranking member of leadership, Tom Emmer, of Minnesota, was eliminated from contention for Speaker after Trump and the far right attacked him for being insufficiently conservative. Of the viable candidates still in the running, he was the only one who&#39;d voted to certify the 2020 election. Yet there were others in the conference who&#39;d opposed the bids of Jordan and Steve Scalise because they had &lt;em>;refused&lt;/em>; to certify those results. One of them was Ken Buck, of Colorado. When he and I recently spoke, Buck told me that the old Jim Jordan wouldn&#39;t recognize the person he&#39;d become. But now Buck supported Johnson. On CNN, Abby Phillip asked him how he could square the two positions. “Jim Jordan was involved in much of the post-election activity,” he said, stammering a bit. “Mike Johnson was not. He voted to decertify, absolutely. That wasn&#39;t my vote. But we need to move forward.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Johnson is the most conservative Speaker in recent memory, perhaps ever. Last year, for instance, Johnson introduced a bill to prohibit discussions of sexual orientation and gender identity at any institution that receives federal funds. After the Supreme Court repealed Roe v.

Republican moderates, particularly those in districts that Biden won, may feel uneasy about their new leader, but they were apparently willing to suspend their misgivings in order to end the embarrassment of the past three weeks.

The first time, in 1979, it was a stunt to draw attention to the publication of a book of short stories he had written. Since then, the Brooklyn native, a former college instructor who divides his time between New York, Arizona, and St. Maarten (where he plans to move if Donald Trump wins next November), has run at least nineteen times. Undeterred by losing, he&#39;s been a candidate for the US Senate, the House of Representatives, the Democratic nomination for the Presidency, and the town council in Davie, Florida. On August 9th, Grayson signalled his intent to run again, this time for Arizona&#39;s Corporation Commission, the agency that regulates public utilities in the state. This was also a stunt, but a serious one. Grayson, very deliberately, chose to run under the banner of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/what-is-no-labels-trying-to-do&quot;>;No Labels&lt;/a>;, the “social welfare organization” that, while claiming not to be a political party, has been gathering signatures across the country to gain ballot access in every state in order to have the option of offering a Presidential “unity ticket”—one Democrat and one Republican—in the 2024 general election. The group will do so, according to its co-founder and CEO, Nancy Jacobson, only if &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tag/joe-biden&quot;>;Joe Biden&lt;/a>; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tag/donald-trump&quot;>;Donald Trump&lt;/a>; are their respective parties&#39; nominees, and if No Labels has a clear path to victory. In what might appear to be a disingenuous bit of timing, though, No Labels plans to have a nominating convention in April, not long after the Super Tuesday primaries but months before the Republicans and the Democrats hold theirs. (This week, the Democrat-aligned advocacy group Third Way accused No Labels of changing course and seeking to run a third-party candidate in order to insure that neither major party receives a sufficient number of electoral votes to declare victory—which, it said, would throw the election to the House and give No Labels an outsized role in determining the next President. The accusation was based on a CNN interview last May with No Labels&#39; chief strategist, Ryan Clancy, who said that “if a No Labels ticket won some electoral votes they can use that as a bargaining chip,” as well as No Labels&#39; own &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.politico.com/newsletters/playbook/2023/10/24/the-houses-purge-moment-00123137&quot;>;recently released polling&lt;/a>;. Clancy &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/24/us/politics/no-labels-third-party-democrats.html&quot;>;dismissed the idea&lt;/a>; as “a conspiracist&#39;s fever dream.”)&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;No Labels was founded in 2010 by a group of politicians and political strategists affiliated with both the Democratic and Republican parties, with a mission to break through partisan gridlock in Congress and to encourage across-the-aisle coöperation. Its signature accomplishment, sponsoring bipartisan caucuses in both the House and the Senate, has been criticized by Democrats for giving cover to conservative members of the Party to vote with Republicans; meanwhile, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2018/11/05/house-problem-solvers-caucus-has-solved-few-problems-bipartisan-critics-allege/&quot;>;Washington &lt;em>;Post&lt;/em>; analysis&lt;/a>; found that, during the Trump Administration, a number of Republican caucus members followed the dictates of the White House upward of ninety per cent of the time. Last year, No Labels pivoted away from a focus on Congress and reportedly set a goal of raising seventy million dollars for what it called an “insurance policy for 2024”: gaining ballot access in all fifty states in order to give Americans “the choice to vote for a presidential ticket that features strong, effective, and honest leaders who will commit to working closely with both parties.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;So far, No Labels has raised sixty million dollars, but it has been able to skirt Federal Election Commission disclosure rules that would require it to report the source of its funding. This is because it is a nonprofit organization and not, for the purposes of the Federal Election Commission, what is known as a political-party committee. (A political-party committee triggers FEC oversight.) But, since some of its donors have been reported to be Republican operatives and Trump supporters—most notably &lt;a href=&quot;https://newrepublic.com/article/172059/no-labels-took-100000-clarence-thomas-buddy-harlan-crow&quot;>;the billionaire&lt;/a>; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/clarence-thomass-friend-of-the-court&quot;>;Harlan Crow&lt;/a>; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2023/06/no-labels-exposed-heres-a-list-of-donors-funding-its-effort-to-disrupt-the-2024-race/&quot;>;private-equity investor Tom McInerney&lt;/a>;, a major financial supporter of the Republican National Committee—Democrats have accused the group of being a spoiler that will take more votes away from Biden than from Trump, allowing the twice-impeached, four-times-indicted former President to secure a second term. Jacobson, who has previously served as the finance chair for the Democratic National Committee, has denied that this is the case, saying that the group would drop its effort if it looked as if it would help Trump win—though it remains unclear how that would be determined. She added, “We will not spoil for either side. The only reason to do this is to win.” (A spokesperson for No Labels said Jacobson is no longer a Democrat.)&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Grayson told me that he has taken up the mantle of No Labels to compel the group to show its hand. “My goal right now is to say, look, they have to follow at least Arizona election law,” he said. “They&#39;re a party.” Indeed, earlier this year, after obtaining a sufficient number of signatures, No Labels was recognized by the Democratic secretary of state, Adrian Fontes, as a legitimate political party. (Every state has its own rules and requirements for getting on the ballot.)&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Since then, more than fifteen thousand Arizona residents have chosen to register their party affiliation as No Labels. (Biden won the state in 2020 by &lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-donald-trump-arizona-phoenix-elections-9638adedbe826b31b5d172ba3a1c7c3a&quot;>;ten thousand four hundred and fifty-seven&lt;/a>; votes.) The Arizona Democratic Party filed a complaint in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/science/elements/life-and-death-in-americas-hottest-city&quot;>;Maricopa County&lt;/a>; court against Fontes, to keep No Labels out of the state, on the ground that, in failing to register with the FEC and revealing its donors, it &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/30/politics/arizona-democrats-sue-no-labels/index.html&quot;>;was not playing&lt;/a>; by the rules. The Democratic Party lost, appealed the decision, and, on September 1st, withdrew its complaint.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;By then, Grayson had already filed his “statement of interest,” a non-binding document that prospective candidates in Arizona are required to submit, indicating that they are collecting signatures for a possible run; it is not a formal declaration of candidacy. No Labels was not amused. Its lawyers threatened to sue Fontes, to keep Grayson and other down-ballot hopefuls from running under its aegis. (Tyson Draper, a high-school coach, who has been mounting an effort to recall Katie Hobbs, the Democratic governor of Arizona, and has a TikTok channel on which he posts videos praising Trump and Kari Lake, has said that he&#39;s interested in running for the US Senate as a No Labels candidate.) But, even before Grayson had begun his effort to unmask No Labels, the group was contemptuous of a potential “rogue” No Labels candidate. In a tortuous letter to Fontes&#39;s office last June, the group detailed why it had the right to preclude down-ballot candidates from using its name, and why, even if such candidates did run, the group would not have to comply with state or federal financial-disclosure laws, citing a surfeit of case law to support its position. On October 19th, No Labels did, in fact, sue Fontes, in his capacity as the secretary of state, in an effort to keep potential down-ballot contenders from running as No Labels candidates.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;A few weeks earlier, Fontes had told me, “I certified the No Labels party because Arizona&#39;s law is very progressive and very pro-voter, and they got enough signatures to get registered as a party. And now they have notified me that they don&#39;t want anybody running under their party banner in Arizona. And I&#39;ve recently sent them a message that they&#39;re wrong. No Labels voters who are properly registered under that party can run for whatever they want. And the national party doesn&#39;t get to decide. They don&#39;t like that idea, because they believe that it might hook them into actually reporting their finances. They want to manipulate the system that way. So I basically told them to pound sand.” (An elections lawyer I spoke with, who has worked on ballot-access issues across the country, told me that No Labels&#39; assertion that it can pick and choose when a candidate decides to affiliate with it “is completely baseless.”)&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Jacobson and other No Labels leaders, including the former Democratic senator Joe Lieberman, now an Independent, and Pat McCrory, the former Republican governor of North Carolina, have stated on the group&#39;s Web site and in interviews that the public&#39;s political disaffection is what&#39;s driving their quest to pave the way for a unity ticket. They cite polls showing that a majority of Americans do not want to vote for either Trump or Biden and the group&#39;s own poll from August, in which nearly sixty-three per cent of registered voters in eight battleground states said they would “consider” a moderate third-party candidate if there is a Trump-and-Biden rematch, and they argue that this moment is especially ripe for a different kind of politics. But this is not the first time that a group of self-professed “centrists,” claiming that the established parties are too extreme and divorced from the concerns of average citizens, have organized to push a bipartisan ticket—and, if it had not been for that earlier effort, No Labels would have to reveal its funders&#39; identities.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In 2006, a group of prominent Democratic and Republican strategists created Unity08, “a kind of would-be post-partisan political party,” as US district judge Stephen F. Williams later described it, with the intention of running a bipartisan Presidential slate in the 2008 election. A press release announcing that effort reads very much like material on the No Labels Web site: “Unity08 is a recently established political movement attracting Americans deeply concerned with the polarization of our political system. Unity08 will provide American voters access to a new and highly participatory process to nominate and elect a bipartisan ticket to the White House in 2008, unconstrained by the limitations of the current system.” Doug Bailey, a Republican political consultant who was one of Unity08&#39;s co-founders, said at the time, “What we are trying to do is to create a forum for people who are in the middle who have been left out of politics.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Unity08 fell apart before the election, but its leaders continued a legal challenge to an FEC advisory opinion that the group needed to abide by campaign-finance disclosure laws, a pursuit undertaken, they said, “both for Unity08 and any similar movement in the future.” And in that they succeeded. The US District Court for the District of Columbia, reversing a lower-court ruling, sided with Unity08, finding that, as Judge Williams wrote in the opinion, until the group selected a “clearly identified candidate” it would not be subject to regulation. This opened the door for dark-money groups such as No Labels to operate without oversight, as it is now doing.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In July, on “Meet the Press,” Jacobson said that “there has never been a group in this country that represents the commonsense majority. Isn&#39;t it fair that they get a seat at the table?” Common sense, of course, means different things to different people. The group has posted a thirty-point “Common Sense Policy” on its Web site which, it says, “provides a clear blueprint for where America&#39;s commonsense majority wants this country to go—and it shows how we can address even the most contentious issues with civility and respect,” yet it is a remarkably unserious, anodyne, and unpracticable document. On &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/07/04/we-are-not-going-back-to-the-time-before-roe-we-are-going-somewhere-worse&quot;>;abortion&lt;/a>;, for example, the group proposes that “America must strike a balance between protecting women&#39;s rights to control their own reproductive health and our society&#39;s responsibility to protect human life.” Its big foreign-policy idea is that “America should make it a national priority to have the most efficient, most effective, and most powerful military in the world to protect democracy at home and abroad.” &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tag/climate-change&quot;>;Climate change&lt;/a>; does not explicitly make it onto the agenda, but an “all of the above energy strategy” does—one that is also favored by the fossil-fuel industry and by politicians such as Joe Manchin, the West Virginia Democrat and former honorary No Labels co-chair, who was the Senate&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.opensecrets.org/members-of-congress/joe-manchin/industries?cid=N00032838&amp;amp;cycle=2022&amp;amp;type=C&quot;>;No. 1 recipient&lt;/a>; of fossil-fuel-industry largesse in the most recent election cycle.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Manchin has been rumored to be considering a No Labels Presidential run; he says that he &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/first-read/manchins-presidential-flirtation-raises-big-2024-questions-rcna77875&quot;>;hasn&#39;t ruled it out&lt;/a>;. Jacobson, when asked, has said that the group has made no decisions yet about to whom it will “offer our ballot line.” That may seem a strange and dissembling way to describe a nominee for the highest political office in the land, but it dovetails with the group&#39;s declaration that “No Labels is solely getting ballot access.就是这样。 We will not run a presidential campaign.” Jacobson, on “Meet the Press,” reiterated the point, saying, “A party is running candidates up and down the ballot. That is not what we&#39;re doing.” Of course, by bowing out of the political process once it “offers its ballot line to a candidate”—who will then have to do the heavy lifting of running for office—No Labels might succeed in maintaining its status as a social-welfare organization, thus avoiding FEC scrutiny and having to reveal its backers.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Even if the group&#39;s leadership decides not to nominate a candidate in 2024, however, if state party organizations nominate a candidate themselves to run on the No Labels ballot line, it may not be able to keep its pledge that it will not be a spoiler. As Richard Winger, the editor of &lt;em>;Ballot Access News,&lt;/em>; wrote in 2012, after alumni of Unity08 had established another failed bipartisan “centrist” Presidential effort, this one called Americans Elect, “National leaders of Americans Elect may be unhappy if state units choose their own nominees, but history, the Constitution, and election law restrict their power over this matter.” Richard Grayson&#39;s provocation in Arizona illustrates that getting on the ballot in all fifty states does not guarantee that No Labels will be able to control its own fate—or ours. ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;s637q&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;bqhlgg&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 26 Oct 2023 03:06:01 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
