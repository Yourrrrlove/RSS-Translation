data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Fiction Studios 是位于伦敦市中心法灵登的录音场所，是一家一丝不苟地学习。乍一看，它就像是你再也见不到的二手书店了——书架上摆满了旧精装书、古董灯、红色天鹅绒窗帘、俱乐部式的皮革软垫沙发，以及靠在书架上的一幅巨大的镀金油画。书柜。只有到那时，人们才会注意到一个三十六轨混音控制台和各种放大器、合成器和钢琴。八月的一个晚上，一群歌迷、记者和音乐界人士挤进这个空间，参加一场“聆听派对”，庆祝这位 25 岁歌手兼词曲作者的 EP 《Well Well》的发行维多利亚运河。 “我以前从未来过这里，”Canal 告诉人群，但这个地方几乎无法更好地反映她的艺术项目：热情好客，但也非常有条理。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Canal 几乎始终面带微笑她强壮的颧骨将整个脸向上抬起，她经常耸起肩膀，做出一种笨拙的自嘲动作。 《观察家报》最近的一篇“值得关注”专栏形容她的存在“可爱”，并表示，“感觉就像她生在舞台上。”虽然她的歌曲涉及抑郁、悲伤、身体畸形和酷儿等问题，但她的方式有一种软化沉重话题的方式，而一种讨人喜欢的傻瓜式网络幽默已经成为 Canal 品牌的基石。 “我不知道你们中是否有人有心理健康问题，”卡纳尔有一次说道，并向观众投去一种心照不宣的表情。此前，在 TikTok 上，她曾引用变装皇后 Trixie Mattel 的话来描述她的粉丝群：“我很喜欢青少年、女孩、女同性恋、精神病患者和非常悲伤的人。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Canal介绍了“Well Well”中的六首曲目中的每一首，并用长篇大论讲述了它们的创作及其背后的灵感。 “Braver”是写给她母亲的，她在阿拉巴马州和乔治亚州长大，但移民到了西班牙。合唱团唱道：“你比我以往任何时候都勇敢。”卡纳尔谈到她的母亲不仅搬到了一个她不会说语言的国家，而且还解除了婚约，嫁给了一位她在西班牙遇到的第一个男人——后来成为卡纳尔的父亲。 （Canal 居住在伦敦，但自称是西班牙裔美国人。）在介绍《Yes Man》时，Canal 提到这首歌是她在西班牙与酷玩乐队主唱克里斯·马丁 (Chris Martin) 一起写作时创作的。 Martin 于 2021 年首次接触 Canal，此后成为她职业生涯的重要导师和助推器。在静修期间，他给她安排了一个任务，用他的 Veillette Gryphon 吉他创作一首歌，而他每天都在泳池里绕圈。 （在静修会上还有 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/01/25/how-jacob-collier-found-a-key-that-doesnt-exist&quot;>;Jacob Collier &lt;/a>;，可以听到她在最终的曲目中演奏维莱特。）&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“她走进来”让我们回想起威斯康星州隆冬时从雪地里挖出一辆汽车的情景。这是在经过改建的谷仓里，歌曲的制作人之一布莱恩·弗雷德里克·约瑟夫将其用作工作室。 （谷仓的另一位制作人是 S. Carey，他以 Bon Iver 乐队的鼓手而闻名。）这首歌是 EP 中解决身体形象和身体畸形的两首歌曲之一。 “她走进来”，歌曲开始，然后继续：&lt;/p>;&lt;blockquote >;&lt;div >;&lt;p>;每个人都在凝视&lt;br/>;因为她真的很伟大。&lt;br/>;有时我希望有人会凝视&lt;br/>;但出于这个原因&lt;br/>;有时我会被愚弄一秒钟，&lt;br/>;但他们盯着我看，因为我的身体不同。&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/blockquote>; &lt;p>;Canal 在成长过程中就敏锐地意识到人们可以用不同的方式盯着自己看。她显然很漂亮，有着一张开放、戏剧性的脸，似乎是为专辑封面而生的。由于患有羊膜带综合症，她出生时就没有右前臂和手。就音乐而言，她的残疾——她或多或少地交替使用“残疾”和“肢体差异”这两个词——本质上不是问题：她短小的右臂非常适合在钢琴上弹奏左臂上的旋律线。 - 手伴奏并用于在吉他上弹奏各种模式。更复杂的是受到关注——或者用职业术语来说，是音乐产业和媒体如何看待她的方方面面。她的残疾给她带来了机会——比如与耐克合作为残疾人士开发一款运动鞋——但也带来了羞辱。 （在她与马丁合唱之后，几个新闻头条都提到了“一位单手钢琴家”，但没有提到她的名字。）她面临着一个与表演轨迹与代表性和可见度问题密切相关的表演者所熟悉的挑战：如何伸张正义差异是她世界经历的一个重要组成部分，但又不让这种差异定义她。 “Well Well”的前两首歌标志着她第一次尝试直接解决这个问题。&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >; &lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Canal 正处于职业生涯的结束阶段。十年来，从十几岁开始，她就随时随地表演，逐渐登上流行事业的摇摇欲坠的阶梯：在网上发行歌曲；与 Hozier、Lawrence 和 JP Saxe 一起巡演；为小莱斯利·奥多姆和泰迪·斯威姆斯开场。现在她似乎正处于更大的事情的边缘。今年早些时候，在艾弗·诺韦洛奖 (Ivor Novello Awards) 上，她赢得了 &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://ivorsacademy.com/awards/the-ivors/rising-star/&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot ;element”:“ExternalLink”,“outgoingURL”:“https://ivorsacademy.com/awards/the-ivors/rising-star/”}&quot; href=&quot;https://ivorsacademy.com/awards /the-ivors/rising-star/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;新星奖&lt;/a>;，去年她在 Apple TV+ 的剧集《小美国》中首次亮相。两年前出现了一个转折点，克里斯·马丁在网上听到了她的歌曲并取得了联系并提供了支持。在 Parlophone 唱片公司向 Canal 介绍她后，Canal 与该唱片公司签约，目前正在制作她的第一张完整专辑，将于明年发行。今年秋天，在她的 EP 发行后，她开始了她在英国和欧洲的第一次头条巡演。 （上个月，她在美国各地演唱，支持 Sammy Rae &amp;amp; the Friends。）“她有唱歌的天赋，”马丁最近告诉我。 “我不知道它从何而来，也不知道你如何定义它，但歌曲通过她就像对某些人一样。”对他来说，她的音乐听起来与众不同。 “除此之外，她在情感上非常开放。”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot;

&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;歌曲结束时的脆弱感是显而易见的。随后，一位粉丝向卡纳尔赠送了一顶金色王冠，她戴上王冠摆出了“枪展”姿势，自豪​​地展示了自己较短的手臂。然后她坐回到钢琴凳上，钢琴凳立即倒塌，让她瘫倒在地板上。 “当时很混乱，”她后来告诉我。但卡纳尔已经把她的观众变成了一种降落伞，他们及时抓住了她，卡纳尔和观众咯咯笑着一直到演出结束，所有的界限都被抹去了。&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport- Monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;“我一直有一个不寻常的信念，就是要全力以赴”，当我在她巡演的第二次约会之前与她见面时，Canal 告诉我。曼彻斯特。这种信念可以体现在快速的直觉决定中——当纽约演出的一位观众提出免费纹身时，她就去纹身——但她的信念越来越坚定，更仔细地专注于不惜一切代价实现她的职业生涯。托尼·伯格（Tony Berg）为菲比·布里杰斯（Phoebe Bridgers）和博伊吉尼斯（boygenius）制作了唱片，他告诉我，卡纳尔“对讨论持开放态度，乐于接受新想法，但是，当她觉得某些事情不适合她，或者她强烈地觉得她正在做的事情是已经正是她想要的，她会让你知道。”他认为这种独立性对她很有好处：“她不是现在菲比模仿者的攻击者之一。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Canal 将她的决心归功于她的父亲，她是一位商人，主要从事商业领域的工作。医疗器械的营销。她还认为这来自她的祖母，她在古巴长大，但逃到了西班牙。如果她觉得孙女在练习钢琴时没有全心投入哪怕是最简单的音阶，她就会斥责卡纳尔。 （为了纪念这一点，卡纳尔在她的耳后纹了短语&lt;em>;con alma&lt;/em>;——西班牙语，意思是“有灵魂”。）卡纳尔的家人追随她父亲在世界各地的工作；当她十四岁的时候，她已经在德国、西班牙、中国、日本和阿联酋生活过。那时，当另一次搬家迫在眉睫时——从迪拜搬到巴塞罗那——卡纳尔问她的父母是否可以把她的教育转移到网上。部分原因是她在学校感到被排斥，部分原因是她想腾出时间进行练习，因为她相信音乐事业是不可避免的。她早上会参加在线学校，下午则在巴塞罗那的一所音乐学院度过，在那里她最终与通常比她大十岁的音乐家一起学习。 “他们都是成年人，所以他们实际上很友善、包容，并且足够成熟，能够克服自己的不安全感，”她说。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;就在她开始在线学校之前，Canal 在迪拜有一位音乐老师向她讲述了作为一名歌手的商业方面的内幕。 Canal 爱上了她所说的“取得进步的项目”，认为在 Facebook 上获得关注者或在 YouTube 上获得观看次数等事情“就像数独谜题一样”。她说她已经向未来的艺术家和制作人发送了数百封冷淡的电子邮件。 “我参加的每一次巡演几乎都是通过在 Instagram 上私聊艺术家的，”她说。 “我是忙碌文化的受害者，因为我一生只考虑我的职业生涯，”她说道，然后停下来重新表述。 “我不确定‘受害者’这个词是否正确，但绝对是，就像，一个参与者。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Canal 目前的生活是一个两极分化的生活：有时她是一名国际喷气机旅行者，随意地与其他人闲逛。音乐巨星，例如 1975 年的 Collier、Hozier 或 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/06/05/who-is-matty-healy&quot;>;Matty Healy&lt;/a>; ，但大多数时候她是一位突破性的艺术家，拼命地努力使巡演可持续发展。 Canal 的职业生涯就像音乐版的“根据你想要的工作着装”，她的日程安排很忙碌。除了巡演之外，还有国际旅行，与特定工作室的特定制作人合作，严格的锻炼计划——她目前正在努力掌握单臂引体向上——而且，在她的休息时间，很长一段时间都被标记为她不被允许的地方使用她的手机。与此同时，她的近期目标很平常：她想要一支更大的乐队、一名灯光工程师、一个负责前台的人以及一辆旅游巴士。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Canal 对这一切都非常开放，她经常在社交媒体上分享自己最大的弱点。伦敦演出一周后，她在 Instagram 上发布了一部幕后迷你纪录片。那天晚上，坎纳尔在伦敦北部的家中为演出挑选衣服。 “为什么我感觉这么肿？”她问。 “根据一天的不同，我对自己身体的感觉也不同。”卡纳尔从卧室里出来，穿着一身与她原本计划的不同的衣服，她的笑容明显苍白。在 Canal 的 Instagram 上，有一段她在听她第一首关于残疾的歌曲“She Walks In”时的情绪反应视频，还有另一个视频，其中她的身体上画着“Shape”的歌词（“别那么漂亮”）在我面前”）当她乘坐伦敦地铁时。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;她的表现力的一部分是一种叛逆的姿态；她妈妈一直监控她的社交媒体，直到她成年为止，偶尔会要求她删除帖子。但她的公众形象也令人不安，这反映了一个行业对真实性的美化，这创造了一种环境，让像卡纳尔这样的艺术家——以及大多数其他年轻女性——感到被迫将自己最深的不安全感展现给所有人看。毫无疑问，卡纳尔事业的蒸蒸日上是建立在她毫不畏缩地捕捉情感的能力之上，其中许多情感都来自她自己的经历，但这也表明，对于艺术家来说，重拾叙事和让创伤成为叙事的一部分之间的界限是多么模糊。一个品牌。 “没有人告诉我做任何我不想做的事情，”她有一次对我说，但她很清楚这个行业热衷于利用“人们喜欢音乐中的抑郁症”这一事实。&lt;/ p>;&lt;p>;曼彻斯特演出结束后，与伦敦演出一样，她从休息室出来与观众见面，其中大多数人都留下来聊天。她对身体形象和心理健康的直接态度为她带来了很多像她一样的观众。 “年轻的酷儿女性是甜蜜、温柔、友善、孤独、敏感的，”她告诉我。天生的过度分享者之间有拥抱、自拍和激烈的对话。其中一些互动是在 Instagram 上拍摄的，但大多数对话都在愉快地进行，直到大约二十分钟后，卡纳尔似乎融入了房间，与她的观众变得难以区分，正如她所计划和希望的那样。 ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;2g7hno&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;

The pop star rose to fame in the early two-thousands, and, after enduring a series of mental-health crises, was placed in a conservatorship through which her father controlled almost every aspect of her day-to-day existence. On this episode of Critics at Large, the staff writers Vinson Cunningham, Naomi Fry, and Alexandra Schwartz discuss the “horror story” that emerges in the memoir as the teen-aged Spears is betrayed by everyone around her: a family intent on profiting off her talent; a young Justin Timberlake, who used his romance with Spears as a stepping stone for his own career; a ravenous media that both sexualized and shamed her. The hosts consider how “The Woman in Me” fits within the broader canon of celebrity memoirs, citing the producer Julia Phillips&#39;s “burn-it-all-down” best-seller, “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Youll-Never-Lunch-This-Again/dp/0399590900&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Youll-Never-Lunch-This-Again/dp/0399590900&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Youll-Never-Lunch-This-Again/dp/0399590900&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;You&#39;ll Never Eat Lunch in This Town Again&lt;/a>;,” and the late Matthew Perry&#39;s 2022 meditation on his struggles with addiction, “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Friends-Lovers-Big-Terrible-Thing/dp/1250866448&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Friends-Lovers-Big-Terrible-Thing/dp/1250866448&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Friends-Lovers-Big-Terrible-Thing/dp/1250866448&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;Friends, Lovers, and the Big Terrible Thing&lt;/a>;.” Ultimately, these stories are just one facet of a broader narrative—and a kind of performance in their own right. “Once you submit to being a celebrity, your music, and how you appear in magazines, and what you produce as a memoir all contribute to this one big text,” Cunningham says. “It&#39;s this grand synthesis, and, in the end, the text is Britney herself.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;New episodes drop every Thursday.

He was just four years out of college, and this would be one of his biggest jobs yet: political director for the reëlection campaign of Ro Khanna, a Democratic representative from Silicon Valley. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-political-scene/ro-khannas-progressive-case-for-saving-silicon-valley-bank&quot;>;Khanna&lt;/a>;, a well-known and popular incumbent with plenty of money in the bank, is in no real danger of losing his election next year; many representatives in his position might not have been hiring campaign staff at all. But Khanna is also ambitious—it&#39;s frequently speculated that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/ro-khanna-not-running/&quot;>;he may run for President&lt;/a>; one day, staking out a pragmatic-populist lane slightly to the right of Bernie Sanders and to the left of Gavin Newsom. Part of Ramer&#39;s job would be to act as a liaison between Khanna and various activist groups, trying to keep the representative in the good graces of his progressive base and to burnish his future reputation.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;On October 7th, Ramer&#39;s sixth day on the job, he woke up to the news that Hamas militants had broken through the border fence in Gaza and started slaughtering and kidnapping Israeli civilians. “My first reaction was to be sickened by the bloodshed,” he said. “My second thought was, When Israel responds, it&#39;s going to get so much worse.” Ramer, a redhead with a mustache, is descended from Mennonite pacifists on both sides of his family. His grandfather, a conscientious objector during the Vietnam War, was later arrested while scattering blood on the walls of the Pentagon, as part of a civil-disobedience action against nuclear weapons. (Ramer&#39;s mother, then twelve, watched her father get arrested. “I&#39;m scared, but I understand why he did it,” &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/local/1978/12/30/42-arrested-at-pentagon-nuclear-weapons-protest/0337847a-6d8a-4b6c-b983-e635654c6901/&quot;>;she told the Washington &lt;em>;Post&lt;/em>;&lt;/a>; at the time, her glasses dotted with blood.) In conversation, Ramer talks less about earmarks and executive orders than about vines and fig trees. “I hate politics,” he said. “But it&#39;s the most direct way I have found to try to reduce people&#39;s suffering.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Ramer was working remotely from Madison, Wisconsin, dog-sitting for his parents while they were on vacation. (They were not on a cruise or at a Club Med; they were on a group tour of Northern Ireland, learning about the protracted peace process that ended the Troubles.) In the hours after Hamas&#39;s attack, American and Israeli politicians started referring to it as “Israel&#39;s 9/11” and invoking an unqualified right to self-defense, as if the magnitude of the atrocities could preëmptively justify whatever Israel did next. But Ramer reflected on what he took to be the abiding lessons of 9/11, and of its grinding, decades-long aftermath: “No matter how full of anger and legitimate grief you may be, how do you not turn that grief into endless war?”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Khanna was one of Bernie Sanders&#39;s most outspoken supporters in the 2020 Presidential primary, but since then he has put distance between himself and other Sanders-aligned House members, including those in the so-called Squad. He refers to himself not as a democratic socialist but as a “progressive capitalist.” (He represents Silicon Valley, after all, and has received sizable &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.marketwatch.com/story/rep-ro-khanna-defends-fundraiser-at-david-sacks-home-after-supporting-silicon-valley-bank-bailout-f6b0f0dc&quot;>;donations&lt;/a>; from some of the rich men south of Richmond, California.) Ramer, who worked on Sanders&#39;s campaign in 2020, went to work for Khanna knowing that he was not a doctrinaire leftist. “He&#39;s strong on unions, on climate, on Medicare for All,” Ramer said. But it wasn&amp;#x27;t clear that Israel-Palestine was at the forefront of Khanna&#39;s mind—or any Democrat&#39;s mind, really—until the events of October 7th.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Shortly after the Hamas attack, Khanna put out a &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://twitter.com/RepRoKhanna/status/1710749751275028629&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://twitter.com/RepRoKhanna/status/1710749751275028629&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/RepRoKhanna/status/1710749751275028629&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;statement&lt;/a>; condemning it—a statement that no one, or at least no one with any credibility in American politics, could have opposed. (A few leftists online, citing a superficial reading of anti-colonial theory, were memeing themselves into the position that wanton murder was actually praxis, but such views had no currency in DC) Ramer tried to urge his boss to move beyond denunciation and toward deëscalation: “We can condemn Hamas unequivocally while standing unequivocally with Palestinian lives and decry the drums of war that are being hit right now,” he texted Khanna, who responded, “Yes, that&#39;s what I try to do.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The Israeli Defense Minister, Yoav Gallant, ordered a “complete siege” of Gaza. “There will be no electricity, no food, no fuel,” he &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/defense-minister-announces-complete-siege-of-gaza-no-power-food-or-fuel/&quot;>;declared&lt;/a>;. “We are fighting human animals and are acting accordingly.” Nearly nine hundred scholars &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://twailr.com/public-statement-scholars-warn-of-potential-genocide-in-gaza/&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://twailr.com/public-statement-scholars-warn-of-potential-genocide-in-gaza/&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://twailr.com/public-statement-scholars-warn-of-potential-genocide-in-gaza/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;warned&lt;/a>; that such dehumanizing rhetoric (“human animals”) has, in the past, been a precursor to genocide. When the air strikes started, killing thousands of Palestinian men, women, and children—and then again, when Isaac Herzog, the President of Israel, &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.yahoo.com/israeli-president-says-no-innocent-154330724.html&quot;>;reiterated&lt;/a>;, “It is an entire nation out there that is responsible”—many &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://euobserver.com/opinion/157602&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://euobserver.com/opinion/157602&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://euobserver.com/opinion/157602&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;observers argued&lt;/a>; that Israel was carrying out a policy of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/world/un-experts-say-israels-strikes-gaza-amount-collective-punishment-2023-10-12/&quot;>;collective punishment&lt;/a>;, making the civilian population of Gaza pay for Hamas&#39;s crimes, which, &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2023/10/commission-inquiry-collecting-evidence-war-crimes-committed-all-sides-israel&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2023/10/commission-inquiry-collecting-evidence-war-crimes-committed-all-sides-israel&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2023/10/commission-inquiry-collecting-evidence-war-crimes-committed-all-sides-israel&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;international experts&lt;/a>; noted, is a &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://casebook.icrc.org/a_to_z/glossary/collective-punishments#:~:text=International%20humanitarian%20law%20prohibits%20collective,punishment%20is%20a%20war%20crime.&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://casebook.icrc.org/a_to_z/glossary/collective-punishments#:~:text=International%20humanitarian%20law%20prohibits%20collective,punishment%20is%20a%20war%20crime.&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://casebook.icrc.org/a_to_z/glossary/collective-punishments#:~:text=International%20humanitarian%20law%20prohibits%20collective,punishment%20is%20a%20war%20crime.&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;war crime&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;House members held a candlelight vigil for Israeli victims of Hamas, and Khanna attended. (A Muslim staffer who works in another progressive Democrat&#39;s office told me that she and a few other Hill staffers, both Muslim and Jewish, tried to organize a separate vigil, honoring both the slain Israelis and the innocent Palestinians who had been killed, but that several colleagues advised her against it, saying that it would be too harmful to her career.) More than four hundred representatives co-sponsored a bipartisan House resolution whose official title was “Standing with Israel as it defends itself against the barbaric war launched by Hamas and other terrorists.” The &lt;a href=&quot;https://democrats-foreignaffairs.house.gov/_cache/files/9/5/95e229f8-89d8-43cb-bb98-2bdcc77a879a/D19CC80B24526B64867AB83ADC5A4A9D.hamas-res.pdf&quot;>;resolution&lt;/a>; rightly mourned Israeli and American deaths, yet it referred to Palestinian civilian casualties only in passing, and with little sympathy; it pledged “support” for Israel with no stated &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.twincities.com/2023/10/22/thomas-friedman-to-win-the-war-defeat-hamas-and-stop-settlements/&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.twincities.com/2023/10/22/thomas-friedman-to-win-the-war-defeat-hamas-and-stop-settlements/&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.twincities.com/2023/10/22/thomas-friedman-to-win-the-war-defeat-hamas-and-stop-settlements/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;preconditions&lt;/a>;, and made no mention of international humanitarian law. Still, J Street, a center-left lobbying group that describes itself as “pro-Israel, pro-peace,” was &lt;a href=&quot;https://theintercept.com/2023/10/13/j-street-israel-gaza-resolution/&quot;>;joining&lt;/a>; with groups to its right, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/09/01/friends-israel&quot;>;&lt;em >;AIPAC&lt;/em>;&lt;/a>;, to push representatives to co-sponsor the resolution. Some pro-Israel lobbyists seemed to be implying that almost any attempt to constrain Israel&#39;s military options would be understood as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://theintercept.com/2023/10/13/j-street-israel-gaza-resolution/&quot;>;betrayal&lt;/a>;. This was another way in which the days after October 7th resembled the days after 9/11: a consensus was starting to take hold in Washington, one in which public calls for deëscalation were portrayed as soft-brained lunacy or traitorous extremism. “The pressure I was getting from activists was, &#39;Are we just giving Israel a blank check?&#39; ” Ramer told me. “People noticed that there were thirteen members who had decided not to co-sponsor that resolution, and I heard from a bunch of people asking why Ro wasn&#39;t one of them.”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;4uveb&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;The short answer, it seemed, was that the political lines were becoming clearer, and Khanna was trying to avoid finding himself on the wrong side of them—or, really, to avoid being too strongly associated with any side, if he could help it. “Most politicians see Israel-Palestine as a no-win issue,” a Democratic operative told me. “The people who care most about the issue are hard-core Zionists and Arabs with relatives living under apartheid, and everyone else mostly doesn&#39;t give a shit.” Even Bernie Sanders, the most consistently &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://jacobin.com/2019/07/bernie-sanders-israel-palestine-bds&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://jacobin.com/2019/07/bernie-sanders-israel-palestine-bds&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://jacobin.com/2019/07/bernie-sanders-israel-palestine-bds&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;pro-Palestinian senator&lt;/a>; (he also once &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/06/us/politics/bernie-sanders-kibbutz.html&quot;>;lived in Israel&lt;/a>;), was not eager to take a vanguardist position on the issue. “He finds the Israel situation depressing, and he&#39;s annoyed that people are talking about this instead of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/11/06/will-the-uaw-strike-turn-the-rust-belt-green&quot;>;labor strikes&lt;/a>;,” a progressive political staffer told me. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-political-scene/inside-the-democrats-battle-to-build-back-better&quot;>;Pramila Jayapal&lt;/a>;, a representative from Seattle and the chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, co-sponsored the bipartisan resolution, although she privately expressed anguish about it. “She actually gives a shit about Palestinian lives, but she feels politically boxed in,” the staffer told me. Around this time, Jayapal told a colleague who ran into her at the airport that she felt compelled to support the bipartisan resolution, despite her misgivings—J Street and other pro-Israel groups had left her no choice.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;In private, the Biden Administration was reportedly &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/22/us/politics/us-hostages-israel-gaza.html&quot;>;pressing&lt;/a>; the Netanyahu administration to delay a ground invasion of Gaza and allow in a trickle of humanitarian aid. All the more reason, some members of Congress told their staff, to avoid taking a public position that could restrict Biden&#39;s room to negotiate. Some staffers considered this a principled stance; others thought that it was a convenient excuse. Ramer, alone with the dog in Madison, was up at all hours, doomscrolling. “You have one internal voice going, Adam, you just started this job, your role is to be respectful and not cause problems,” he told me. “And then there&#39;s the other half of you that&#39;s thinking, If there&#39;s a chance of this spiralling into an ethnic-cleansing situation, or a world war, and there&#39;s anything the American government could be doing now to prevent it, and here I am texting with a US congressman, then I probably have a responsibility to keep pushing.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;American politics was bitterly partisan during the Presidencies of Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama, but one of the few areas of bipartisan consensus was staunch, often unquestioning support for Israel. The motif of an American left that was progressive “except for Palestine” became so familiar that Marc Lamont Hill, a CNN contributor who was fired after sharply criticizing Israel, used the phrase as a &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://thenewpress.com/books/except-for-palestine&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://thenewpress.com/books/except-for-palestine&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://thenewpress.com/books/except-for-palestine&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;book title&lt;/a>;. But, beginning in Obama&#39;s second term, two things started to happen simultaneously: the Democratic coalition &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.gallup.com/poll/246806/understanding-shifts-democratic-party-ideology.aspx&quot;>;shifted to the left&lt;/a>;, and Israeli politics &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/israel/2015-03-24/israels-right-turn&quot;>;shifted to the right&lt;/a>;. Democrats, both leftists and moderates, often spoke out against the authoritarian tendencies of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/07/04/does-hungary-offer-a-glimpse-of-our-authoritarian-future&quot;>;Viktor Orbán&lt;/a>;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/04/01/jair-bolsonaros-southern-strategy&quot;>;Jair Bolsonaro&lt;/a>;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tag/donald-trump&quot;>;Donald Trump&lt;/a>;—the sort of tendencies that were also exhibited, with increasing zeal, by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/in-israel-a-glimpse-of-a-trumpian-future&quot;>;Benjamin Netanyahu&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;When the Israeli military started to react to Hamas&#39;s attack, most Republicans, with the notable &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/12/us/politics/trump-hezbollah-israel-palestine.html&quot;>;exception&lt;/a>; of Donald Trump, stuck to the old script, with comments ranging from darkly &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2023/10/11/gop-rhetoric-hamas-00121051&quot;>;jingoist&lt;/a>; to candidly &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20231026-us-congressman-palestine-will-be-turned-into-a-parking-lot/&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20231026-us-congressman-palestine-will-be-turned-into-a-parking-lot/&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20231026-us-congressman-palestine-will-be-turned-into-a-parking-lot/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;exterminationist&lt;/a>;. Within the Democratic coalition, though, surprising new fissures started to emerge. Ben Rhodes, Barack Obama&#39;s former deputy national-security adviser, and Thomas Friedman, the stalwart moderate of the &lt;em>;Times&lt;/em>; Opinion page, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/29/opinion/israel-hamas-ceasefire.html&quot;>;found&lt;/a>; themselves &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nybooks.com/online/2023/10/18/gaza-the-cost-of-escalation/&quot;>;to the left&lt;/a>; of Senator John Fetterman, a salt-of-the-earth left-populist who also turned out to be an &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://twitter.com/SenFettermanPA/status/1716590914749993229&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://twitter.com/SenFettermanPA/status/1716590914749993229&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/SenFettermanPA/status/1716590914749993229&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;acerbic&lt;/a>; &lt;a href=&quot;https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2023/10/john-fetterman-israel-position-explained.html&quot;>;Zionist&lt;/a>;. Josh Paul, a high-ranking State Department official for more than a decade, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/posts/josh-paul-655a25263_explaining-my-resignation-activity-7120512510645952512-APhR&quot;>;resigned&lt;/a>; in protest of “our continued lethal assistance to Israel.” Nearly every institution—&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/dispatch/the-anguished-fallout-from-a-pro-palestinian-letter-at-harvard&quot;>;campuses&lt;/a>;, synagogues, families—seemed riven by internal conflict.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Beginning on Monday, October 16th, Ramer said, “movement folks started coalescing around a single demand”: a ceasefire in Gaza. In particular, he mentioned two left-wing Jewish groups: IfNotNow, founded in 2017, and Jewish Voice for Peace, founded in 1996. For its first two decades or so, JVP was a source of &lt;em>;tsuris&lt;/em>; within the Jewish-institutional world, but far from a political powerhouse. In recent years, though—and especially in recent weeks—both groups had seen a sharp increase in volunteers. “The old-line Zionist groups thought they had a monopoly on this issue,” a prominent Jewish critic of Israel told me. “Now they&#39;re freaking out because the next generation is joining the opposition—their kids are joining.” Two members of the Squad—Cori Bush, a former Black Lives Matter organizer, and Rashida Tlaib, the only Palestinian American in Congress—introduced a House &lt;a href=&quot;https://bush.house.gov/imo/media/doc/bushceasefirenowresolution.pdf&quot;>;resolution&lt;/a>; calling for a ceasefire. At one point, the progressive political staffer told me, “we had the text of the resolution, but we were wondering whether to wait and get someone to introduce it who would be perceived as less polarizing, like maybe Pramila or Mark Pocan”—a white progressive from Wisconsin who is not seen as a firebrand. “But then the feeling was, This is too urgent. Let&#39;s just put it out, and if it&#39;s perceived as a Squad thing, and other members feel they can&#39;t touch it, then so be it.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;This was more or less what happened. The word “ceasefire” became a shibboleth splitting the left in two, with politicians like Khanna and Jayapal, and even Sanders, stuck in the middle. The ceasefire resolution was introduced with thirteen co-sponsors—members of the Squad and their allies, essentially—all of whom were people of color. Waleed Shahid, a former staffer for Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, tweeted, “I&#39;ll buy gulab jamun for the first white member of Congress to endorse ceasefire in Gaza.” More than three hundred of Sanders&#39;s former staffers signed an open &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@formerberniestaff/open-letter-to-senator-bernie-sanders-9d1c10d99e99&quot;>;letter&lt;/a>;, and more than two hundred and fifty of Senator Elizabeth Warren&#39;s former staffers wrote &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@warrenstaff4peace/dear-senator-warren-9a8055d97f2f&quot;>;another&lt;/a>;, urging the senators to join the call. Kunoor Ojha, who worked on Warren&#39;s Presidential campaign, in 2020, told me, “I think she&#39;s engaging in good faith, but I suspect the pressure she&#39;s feeling from the other side is way more acute than what we&#39;ve seen on other issues.” JVP and IfNotNow started organizing demonstrations in support of the ceasefire resolution; &lt;em >;AIPAC&lt;/em>; started whipping votes against it. (“A ceasefire would only serve to leave Hamas armed and in power,” David Gillette, an &lt;em >;AIPAC&lt;/em>; lobbyist, wrote in an e-mail to congressional staffers.) Shortly after the air strikes on Gaza began, Antony Blinken, the US Secretary of State, had tweeted in favor of “advocacy for a cease-fire”—on its face, not an outlandish position for a diplomat to take. But this was cast as a dangerous capitulation—“The Biden Administration is showing its true colors,” a Republican representative from Florida wrote—and Blinken deleted the tweet.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;ddhph&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;JVP and IfNotNow led a rally on the National Mall, and five thousand people showed up. “We will not use the fact that many of our parents and grandparents and great-grandparents were refugees from genocide to justify making hundreds of thousands or even millions of new Palestinian refugees,” the author &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2008/12/08/outside-agitator&quot;>;Naomi Klein&lt;/a>; said, addressing the crowd. After the rally, more than three hundred protesters, including two dozen rabbis, entered the Cannon House Office Building, where they &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5ZAUrwiLsc&quot;>;occupied a rotunda&lt;/a>; for hours, chanting and davening and blowing shofars, until they were arrested by Capitol Police. Phillip Bennet, a staffer for Representative Summer Lee, could hear the commotion from his desk, and he visited during his lunch break. “I found it surprisingly beautiful,” he said. “I felt like I was in temple again.” He and another congressional staffer made the impromptu decision to join the group and get arrested. “Everyone was wearing these matching black T-shirts that said &#39;&lt;em >;NOT IN OUR NAME&lt;/em>;,&#39; ” he continued. “I was the only guy in the jail cell with a suit on.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;At the same time, down the hall, Klein and Beth Miller, a JVP staffer, were rushing among meetings with about a dozen members of Congress. “We talked to members who were still on the fence, and some of their staff was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2023/10/19/congress/hill-staff-call-for-cease-fire-israel-hamas-00122453&quot;>;pissed at them for not taking a stand&lt;/a>;,” Klein told me. An “inside-outside strategy,” she continued, “only works if you can build enough outside pressure to make your demands heard, and if there are people on the inside who are willing to be pressured. This was the first time, after decades of agitating from the left on this issue, when I&#39;ve seen both of those factors coincide.” Barbara Lee, the only member of Congress to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2021/08/17/barbara-lee-afghanistan-vote/&quot;>;vote against&lt;/a>; the authorization of the use of military force three days after 9/11, was wavering about the ceasefire resolution; by the end of the day, she had agreed to become a co-sponsor. The same afternoon, an organizer with IfNotNow told me, they called a staffer in Jayapal&#39;s office and said, “Just so you know, about fifty young Jewish activists are on their way to Pramila&#39;s office later today, and they&#39;re either going to be delivering a letter thanking her for joining the ceasefire resolution or they&#39;re going to be doing a sit-in to protest her for not joining.” The staffer responded, “Copy that,” and hung up the phone. (A spokesperson for Jayapal denied this version of events.) Shortly after, Bush&#39;s office heard that Jayapal wanted to co-sponsor the resolution.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Khanna still had not endorsed a ceasefire. The day the resolution was introduced, Adam Ramer, in his texts with Khanna, ramped up his internal advocacy. “People are reaching out and calling on us to support this resolution,” he wrote.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Who is?” the representative responded. Ramer listed various groups, including JVP and IfNotNow. “Can offer JVP and ifnotnow a zoom,” Khanna responded. Ramer said that he would try to placate the activists with a Zoom, but reiterated, with mounting urgency, that the movement was focussed on the demand for a ceasefire. Khanna demurred, writing, “Even Bernie has not called for this.”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;nt12v&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;“Just because Bernie and Biden admin is taking this line does not mean it is aligned with the progressive foreign policy moment,” Ramer wrote. “We are burning goodwill and the support of the organizers that I am here to build with.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;“Won&#39;t go further than Bernie/Warren on it as very complex,” Khanna texted. “So we need to highlight statements I have made—which is further than Buttigieg, Kamala, Newsom, Whitmer.” This was clearly his final answer. Ramer responded to the text with a thumbs-up emoji and put down his phone.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“I sat with that for a few hours,” Ramer told me. “I took a long walk in a park I really love. And I made up my mind: this is my red line.” That evening, he wrote Khanna a resignation letter. “I cannot in good conscience continue in this role,” he wrote. “Continued escalation will only kill more Israelis and Palestinians, and will impact American lives as well.” Khanna responded swiftly and tactfully: “You are a man of conviction. I respect that.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The following day, Ramer took a pre-planned flight to New York; the day after that, he and a few friends drove to DC, to join the rally on the National Mall. By the time he made it to Capitol Hill in person, he was no longer a political staffer, just another protester in the crowd.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Two Fridays ago, in the pouring rain, I joined Adam Ramer at another protest, on the steps of the New York Public Library. “Never Again Means Now,” the banners read, and “Free Palestine,” and “Colonized Since 1948,” and “Ceasefire Now.” Separately, across the street, a lone protester—or maybe a counter-protester, it was hard to tell—marched in tiny circles, holding a cardboard sign. “Jews Control US, UK &amp;amp; EU,” one side read. In case that was too subtle, on the other side were just two words: “&lt;em >;RICH JEWS&lt;/em>;.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;There were a few hundred people, a damp expanse of umbrellas and ponchos and keffiyehs and yarmulkes, filling the space between the steps and Fifth Avenue. They listened to a half-dozen speeches and then started walking east, toward Senator Kirsten Gillibrand&#39;s office. At one street corner, the protesters walked past two Israeli women who sat in a stopped car, seething with rage. “You support the terrorists!” one of the women, Sigal Gordon, screamed, honking and giving the protesters the finger. “You want women to be raped and murdered?”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;One of the protesters turned to face her. “Where does it say &#39;Hamas&#39; on my sign?” she shouted. “Show me where!” Her sign read “Let Gaza Live.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I identified myself as a journalist and asked Gordon what she thought of the protesters. “They&#39;re all terrorists,” she said. “Me, personally, I would murder all of them.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;As of this writing, the ceasefire resolution has eighteen co-sponsors, out of four hundred and thirty-five House seats; it&#39;s unlikely that it will ever come up for a vote. “Five years ago, that number absolutely would have been zero,” the progressive political staffer told me. “Now it&#39;s eighteen. That&#39;s kind of encouraging. It&#39;s also crushing, because that&#39;s how much power we have, and it&#39;s nowhere near enough.” Still, previous Presidents, in similar binds, have faced significant pressure almost entirely from flag-waving nationalists on the right; Biden is now being cross-pressured from his left, and this seems to be having an effect. “My guess is the Dems will find a way to triangulate,” the Democratic operative told me, on October 23rd. “The Squad supports a ceasefire, so they can&#39;t be for that, but, now that that&#39;s the left flank of the debate, they can support something else—a cessation, maybe, or a truce.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The following day, it became clear what that something else would be: a “humanitarian pause.” On October 24th, Antony Blinken &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://abcnews.go.com/International/blinken-backs-israel-unsc-humanitarian-pauses-considered-protect/story?id=104253042&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://abcnews.go.com/International/blinken-backs-israel-unsc-humanitarian-pauses-considered-protect/story?id=104253042&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://abcnews.go.com/International/blinken-backs-israel-unsc-humanitarian-pauses-considered-protect/story?id=104253042&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;told&lt;/a>; the UN that “humanitarian pauses must be considered”; the day after that, Bernie Sanders gave a speech on the Senate floor calling for a “humanitarian pause”; by the end of last week, Khanna had &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://twitter.com/RoKhanna/status/1717921836875354473&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://twitter.com/RoKhanna/status/1717921836875354473&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/RoKhanna/status/1717921836875354473&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;echoed&lt;/a>; the phrase, as had Jamie Raskin, Dan Goldman, and several other House Democrats, and NBC News &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/biden-blinken-humanitarian-pause-israel-military-campaign-hamas-gaza-rcna122206&quot;>;reported&lt;/a>; that “the White House is now backing the idea of a &#39;pause.&#39; ” In hindsight, it was reasonable to call for &lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://lithub.com/susan-sontag-reacting-to-9-11-in-the-new-yorker-remains-essential-reading/&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://lithub.com/susan-sontag-reacting-to-9-11-in-the-new-yorker-remains-essential-reading/&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://lithub.com/susan-sontag-reacting-to-9-11-in-the-new-yorker-remains-essential-reading/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;caution&lt;/a>; after 9/11, and I have joined in similar calls for caution &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/oct/19/biden-jewish-americans-israel-gaza-call-for-ceasefire&quot;>;now&lt;/a>;, signing an open letter in support of a ceasefire. “If there&#39;s any lesson here, after we get past this war, it&#39;s that the US&#39;s desire to pivot away from the Palestinian issue was a colossal blunder,” Khanna told me recently. “We can&#39;t just wish away the desire for Palestinian justice.”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;sntl6l&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;In New York City, the protesters stood outside of Gillibrand&#39;s office and made a few more speeches, and then more than a hundred of them sat on the wet street, in orderly rows, waiting to be arrested. A socialist brass band called Brass and Roses played, keeping morale high, and someone with drumsticks played a bus-stop shelter like a snare. The arrests began around 8 &lt;em >;PM&lt;/em>;; the protesters were flex-cuffed and loaded, with deliberate slowness, into double-length city buses. A young woman next to me held two burning candles in her hands. “I observe Shabbat, but I felt like I had to participate in this,” she told me. Ramer, who had volunteered to do jail support, collected people&#39;s belongings before they were arrested, then took a subway to 1 Police Plaza and waited for them to get out. The last of them were released at one-thirty in the morning. When I talked to Ramer about Gaza, after we had gone over all the political and legal and geostrategic arguments, he made a theological argument, the same one that Abraham makes in Genesis 18: “If there be fifty righteous men within the city, wilt thou also destroy and not spare the place?” ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot;

Those who owe loans should pay them. The country needs more victors than victims. This summer, at an event in Des Moines, an audience of largely white evangelical voters applauded him heartily as he made his way offstage. At a table in the back of the auditorium was Glenn Beck, the former Fox News host turned conservative media magnate, whose outlet had been running a live stream. Scott slipped on a pair of chunky headphones and sat down with Beck for an interview.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“I love you, you know that,” Beck told him. He felt differently, however, about Scott&#39;s home state.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Historically, I&#39;m pissed off at South Carolina,” Beck said. “The Civil War started—”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“In Charleston,” Scott interrupted, pointing to himself. “My home town.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Do you ever think about how far we have come?” Beck asked. “That the state that was the centerpiece at the beginning, that has caused all of these problems, and then started the Civil War—you are now a beloved senator of that same state?”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;It was the type of question, with its yearning for racial absolution, that Scott has often seized. “I&#39;m African American, as you can tell,” he said, and he invited Beck to “think about my journey.” His grandfather had only an elementary-school education; his mother grew up in a society in which Black people were not allowed to drink from certain water fountains; he pointed out to Beck that, despite all of that history, he was able to defeat white candidates with deep political legacies to become a member of Congress.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;“America works,” Scott told him.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The sins of the Civil War, made clean through Scott&#39;s powerful ascent. For a certain kind of white Republican voter, Scott&#39;s political career represents an escape valve in a society pressurized by its racist past. Black voters, many in his own community, have resented him for similar reasons. They&#39;ve warned for years that Scott looks at the country through a concave mirror shaped by his own experience, distorting his personal success and minimizing the larger struggles that come with being Black in America.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Speaking to Beck, Scott marshalled an early example of that personal success. When he was in eighth grade,“there was a race riot at the high school my brother was at, that I was going to attend the next year,” he told him. “Four years later, I&#39;m the president of the student government of that high school.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Wow,” Beck said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;He went on, “When people talk about American progress and they pretend like it stopped in 1963, it is a lie from the pit of hell.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Scott presents this high-school victory as a tidy tale of racism overcome by personal determination. But it&#39;s not quite the triumph that he has made it out to be. Scott&#39;s experience at RB Stall High School—and what happened both to him and to the school in the years that followed—offers a different kind of American story, one that&#39;s messier and more complicated, with very different implications for how progress works.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Go back to North Charleston, 1970, nearly a decade before the “race riot.” That spring, Black schoolchildren in the community received surprising news. More than fifteen years after Brown v. Board of Education, the school district conceded that it could no longer defy the Supreme Court&#39;s integration mandate. Many students who were scheduled to attend Bonds-Wilson, the city&#39;s all-Black high school, would instead be distributed among three of the city&#39;s previously white schools.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Bonds-Wilson had been built around 1950 in a last-ditch effort to prove that the state could adhere to the principles of “separate but equal.” It nevertheless became a beloved institution for the Black community, a school within walking distance for many of its students, with instructors who actually lived in the neighborhood. “Before a game, the marching band would come down my street,” Donna McQueen, now a lawyer, told me. As a child, she would sit on top of the stone wall in front of her family&#39;s home, listening for soul and rock music in the distance. Then she&#39;d see them: a mass of teen-agers in freshly pressed blue-and-gold uniforms, marching in unison alongside high-stepping, hip-shaking majorettes. “I remember saying to myself, &#39;I am going to lead that band,&#39; ” she said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The year after Bonds-Wilson was broken up, McQueen, who was in eighth grade, joined Black students who were being bused to the new schools. A small contingent went to Stall. “Stall was in an all-white neighborhood,” McQueen said. “Next to it was all forest. So, if something happened, there would be nowhere to run.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Juanita Sanders was a student on one of those buses. Her parents had encouraged her to focus on her schoolwork. But, as the bus pulled into the campus, Sanders saw a group of white classmates waiting in the parking lot, staring at them. “The problems started immediately,” Sanders told me. She was in the bathroom one day, early on, when a white student confronted her. “Get out of the bathroom, nigger,” the student said. “You don&#39;t belong here.” Sanders punched her. “It was a fight, every day,” she recalled.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Inside the classroom, Sanders confronted the limits of her supposedly “equal” previous education. In her old elementary school, she had been at the top of her class. Now she was so far behind that it felt like she had been using an entirely different set of textbooks. Although many staff members at Stall clearly treated Black students worse than their white counterparts, some teachers made an extra effort to help them catch up. In 1973, McQueen&#39;s sophomore year, a teacher named Karen Cabe Gibson joined the school. She had grown up in rural North Carolina and wanted to work at an all-Black high school in Charleston after college. She told me that the county superintendent rejected her request. “He said he was not going to put a young white girl over there,” Gibson said.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The teachers&#39; union fought the decision, but in the meantime Gibson was offered a job at Stall. She welcomed the sight of Black and white students sitting together in her classroom. Most hailed from poor and working-class neighborhoods—race was the biggest difference among them. “They had a hard time being friends with each other,” Gibson said. She taught civics and political science, and tried to ease tensions with class discussions. “If you do not allow people to be treated equally, then you&#39;re in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment,” Gibson would tell her students.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;borgf5&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;5i6cy9&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Black students often complained to Gibson that they felt powerless. They were never able to secure enough votes to win homecoming queen or to lead the student government. As a co-sponsor of the Afro-American club, Gibson tried to help them strategize. “Well, you guys need to learn how to pool your votes,” she told them. Multiple Black students shouldn&#39;t run for the same position. “At this point in the history of this country, you probably need to focus on who you want to get elected and put your votes all for that person.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;McQueen had dreamed of being a drum major, but after a couple of years performing in the Stall band—with its rigid rhythms and staid steps—she quit. In 1975, she decided to run for president of the student government. With encouragement from Gibson and other teachers, she figured she had a shot; she had good grades and was on the cheerleading squad. “You couldn&#39;t do things back then just because you wanted to do them,” McQueen told me. “There had to be a reason. It had to be for your people.” Black students made up around thirteen per cent of the school; they supported McQueen, and she gathered enough additional white votes to prevail. Tim Scott frames his election as the school&#39;s president as transformative, but it was McQueen who paved the way.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“I still don&#39;t believe I won,” she told me, and apparently neither could some in the community. One morning, not long after McQueen&#39;s victory, she was getting ready for school when she saw her father pick up the phone. It was the principal, who suggested that McQueen stay home—a burning cross had been found on the school&#39;s front lawn. McQueen refused. She had perfect attendance, and she did not want to seem intimidated. She later petitioned the superintendent and her principal to host a countywide summit on race. She and a diverse group of other school presidents discussed why Black students were punished more harshly than white ones, and they pushed for staff and teachers to provide more opportunities for Black students, such as recommending them for Rotary Club scholarships.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;McQueen sensed that her schoolmates, both Black and white, were rallying behind her. One time, she was in the school&#39;s main office when she overheard a white parent complaining to the principal that the school had gone too far in empowering Black students. It would have been a dispiriting moment had it not been for the woman&#39;s son, who was standing nearby. He made eye contact with McQueen and mouthed, “I voted for you.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“That was one of those moments that I believed I had done something to make a difference,” McQueen said. “The kids accepted you even when their parents would not.” For students at the beginning of this project of integration, McQueen said that “high school felt like work.” After graduating, in 1976, she wanted the chance to just be a student, so she headed to Spelman College, a historically Black institution. She left Stall thinking that the school was in a good place. Two years later, though, a violent incident put the progress that McQueen had presided over into question.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;n51b4w&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;No one knows for sure why the fight broke out. Gibson heard one explanation, a tale as old as the South: a Black boy said something to a white girl, which angered her boyfriend. Another story—possibly connected—was that two gangs, one Black and the other white, needed to settle a conflict. Earlier, a member of the white gang had supposedly punched a Black student so hard that his nose bled, and then bragged, “I got me a nigger.” According to an account published by the Charleston &lt;em>;Post &amp;amp; Courier&lt;/em>;, Black students had been upset because white teen-agers had destroyed mailboxes in their neighborhood.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;The different hypotheses shared a common theme: cross-racial coexistence at the school was so fragile that a minor incident could destroy it. On a Tuesday in April, 1978, Steve Brockmiller, a white underclassman, saw a group of Black students running through the parking lot. A group of white students burst through the school doors to confront them. The fight began, and then got bigger and bigger—Gibson recalled students jumping out of windows to join in. “Several of my friends got stabbed,” Brockmiller, who prided himself on having a multiracial circle of friends, told me. “They were all out there, and it was a bunch of fighting going on.” Police took about half an hour to calm things down. At least five students were arrested, and several were sent to the hospital.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Questions about interracial education resurfaced among parents and faculty. Police were stationed throughout the school, and students began to view one another with suspicion again. “Every time you passed someone that was Black, they looked at you,” Brockmiller said. “What were they sizing you up for? We all had gotten along. I didn&#39;t understand how something could change so quick.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;By the fall of 1979, nine years after integration, many white families had fled Stall, and the proportion of Black students continued to increase. The new classes mostly came from integrated middle schools, and many had friends of different races. “We knew each other,” Kathy Simmons, Juanita Sanders&#39;s younger sister, told me.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;One of the freshmen was Timothy Eugene Scott. He had large brown eyes, a small Afro, and two buckteeth that his mother couldn&#39;t afford to fix. His family had recently moved to a ranch home in one of North Charleston&#39;s better-off neighborhoods, but he had grown up in a poorer, underdeveloped part of town. Neighbors there remember him running down dirt roads as a little boy, tossing a football and talking about going pro.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“We played football, football, and more football,” Adrian Williams, a childhood friend, told me.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Williams and Scott wound up together on the team at Stall. Both played running back. Scott had a reputation for being diligent and hardworking, maybe a tad arrogant, but not the type to make rousing speeches in the locker room at halftime. Off the field, his classmates remember him as an introvert, someone who was well liked and seemed eager to find community. He was not a dedicated academic. During his freshman year, he failed geography, civics, English, and Spanish. He often says, “When you fail English and Spanish, they don&#39;t call you bilingual. They call you bi-ignant.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;As a sophomore, Scott began to improve. When he got to Gibson&#39;s political-science class, he found himself particularly engaged and curious. Gibson loved discussing elections and often invited lawmakers to the classroom. She organized debates in which students had to learn how to understand and defend positions they didn&#39;t necessarily hold, in subjects such as Latin American diplomacy and Middle East politics. Scott loved learning about the art of compromise, coalition building, and dealmaking.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;During his junior year, Scott toyed around with the idea of running for president of the student government. A close friend and future prom date (it was not romantic) named Donna Neighbors, who was white, encouraged him. Together, they pasted signs across the school that read “Great Scott for Student Government President!” His opponent was a Filipina student named Mary Anne Veloso. She was “brilliant,” Gibson recalled.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;2lx4ws&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;phbp1&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;The candidates had to deliver speeches in front of the student body. Veloso had many achievements to draw from: according to an alumni Web site, she had been class president her freshman and junior years, was a member of the art club and the orchestra, and read the announcements on the school&#39;s PA system.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Scott deployed a different strategy. “Who wants a free lunch?”他说。 The crowd laughed, and then cheered. Scott insisted he was going to be serious, then launched into his next joke: “Lunchtime is far too short!”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Gibson, who was moderating the event, started to smile. She wanted the school to take elections seriously—but Scott was charming. Students voted him in. In his victory, Gibson saw progress. Unlike McQueen, he didn&#39;t need to rely on consolidating Black votes, nor did he express the same obligation to use the position to eradicate prejudice. There were no summits on racism; Scott helped to plan homecoming and an overnight retreat in a cabin.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Scott has claimed that most racism he experienced at Stall came from other Black students, who called him an Oreo. He didn&#39;t sit in the predominantly Black section of the cafeteria, nor was he intensely involved in the Afro-American club. I spoke with some of his Black classmates from the time, who didn&#39;t remember there being animus toward him. Darlesa West Barron, who was a year behind Scott, told me, “I can still see him—a big smile, making speeches. When I think about Tim Scott, it was, like, look at him, he wanted to be successful in the world.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Growing up, Scott had witnessed two almost directly opposed ways of moving through the world as a Black person. His father, Ben, had fought in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tag/vietnam-war&quot;>;Vietnam War&lt;/a>;. Scott wrote, in his book, “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/America-Redemption-Story-Choosing-Creating-ebook/dp/B09RSZDDYS&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/America-Redemption-Story-Choosing-Creating-ebook/dp/B09RSZDDYS&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/America-Redemption-Story-Choosing-Creating-ebook/dp/B09RSZDDYS&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;America, a Redemption Story&lt;/a>;,” that after his father returned he&#39;d hear people call him “a n--- baby killer.” His pain transformed into bitterness, and from bitterness into rage. “All I remember is the green shag carpet, the shouting, the sound of fists slamming into walls,” Scott recalled in the book. (He denied multiple requests for an interview.) When Scott was seven, his mother, Frances, packed up her green Plymouth Cricket, loaded Scott and his nine-year-old brother into it, and left their father behind.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The family moved in with Frances&#39;s parents. Her father, Artis Ware, who had spent years picking cotton on his father&#39;s farm, offered a different outlook on racism. “You can be bitter or you can be better,” he told his grandchildren. “But you can&#39;t be both.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Ware introduced Scott to Bobo Brazil, the brawny brawler who broke the color line in the world of professional wrestling—a Black man who could get white audiences to cheer for him. Scott remembers seeing Ware each morning at the dining table, sitting with his newspaper open. Scott later learned that this was a pantomime: his grandfather didn&#39;t know how to read. The lesson stuck. Be self-reliant. Send the right message, even if it requires a bit of performative optimism.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;jfa5sg&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;In 1983, Scott graduated from Stall and went to Presbyterian College on a football scholarship. Sean Bennett, a state senator who graduated from Stall a couple of years after Scott, told me that Scott set a good example for how white and Black students could find some comity. But the struggles at Stall didn&#39;t go away. During the next few decades, there would be more fights—in the parking lots, in the cafeteria, and in the hallways. On their surfaces, they were about girls or neighborhoods or disrespect. The undercurrents, though, were often racial. Meanwhile, the school&#39;s white population continued to decrease as white families left the area. After electing multiple Black presidents, Stall was becoming segregated again.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;One day in the early nineties, a local chapter of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tag/republican-party&quot;>;Republican Party&lt;/a>; was gearing up for a meeting inside the North Charleston City Hall. Terrye Campsen Seckinger, who is now a commissioner on the state board of higher education, was chatting with a few attendees when she noticed something strange. “Out of the corner of my eyes, I see this Black guy,” Seckinger, who is white, told me. He was tall, and built, and seemed a little nervous—justifiably so. This was still South Carolina, where such meetings could be as segregated as church pews. An elderly woman approached him. “You are not welcome here,” she said. He made a face and headed for the exit. Seckinger chased after him.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Wait a minute, wait a minute,” she said. “I&#39;m excited that you&#39;re here. Tell me about you.” He told her that he was an insurance agent and that he had learned about business principles from a Republican who owned a Chick-fil-A, which was near a movie theatre where he worked in high school. He talked about the faith that he had found at a small Christian college before he transferred to Charleston Southern, and his interest in public service.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;“I&#39;ve been wanting to get involved for a while,” he said. “I&#39;m Tim Scott.” Seckinger hoped that his presence would mark a new era for the Party. In a state like South Carolina, with its toxic history of racism, an ambassador such as Scott could demonstrate that the GOP had moved past skin color. The local Republican Party poured money into a campaign to get Scott elected to the county council. A Black Republican? “This is going to be just one more nail in the Democrats&#39; coffin,” Henry McMaster, the state&#39;s current governor, said at the time.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;When Scott began to tell Black political leaders that he was running for office, they were not surprised. At events at the local NAACP, he had given speeches in which he&#39;d relay his own journey out of poverty and encourage attendees to start new businesses. What was shocking was the ticket he planned to run on.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“A Republican?” James Johnson, one of the state&#39;s leading civil-rights activists, said. “Why would you do that?” Scott&#39;s answer was “I want to be rich,” Johnson told me. Scott&#39;s campaign denied this, but Scott has said that the Democratic Party told him “to wait my turn and go to the back of the line.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Being a Republican had political advantages. The county was two-thirds white, and the council members weren&#39;t elected from specific districts. Many white Republicans could get behind a Black man who spoke the language of Christian conservatism, which would help secure the broad countywide coalition Scott needed. In 1995, Scott won a seat on the Charleston County Council with a raft of white support, a feat that he said many could not have imagined. He told the &lt;em>;Post &amp;amp; Courier&lt;/em>; that he had bigger ambitions: one day, he wanted to be Vice-President.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“Why not President?” someone asked.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“I thought about that,” he said. “But as Vice-President you get to speak more and have a forum to deliver messages.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;So began his political climb, to the state legislature, in 2009, to the US House of Representatives, in 2011, and then, two years later, to the Senate—where he became the first Black member from the South since Reconstruction. He focussed on balancing budgets and cutting government spending. In Washington, DC, he was cast as the conservative foil to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tag/barack-obama&quot;>;Barack Obama&lt;/a>;, the evidence that Republicans presented when their opposition to the first Black President was characterized as racist.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Many Black people in North Charleston had just about given up on Scott&#39;s politics long before. In 2001, the Department of Justice had filed a lawsuit claiming that the county&#39;s lack of voting districts violated the Voting Rights Act by diluting the power of Black votes: in the years leading up to the suit, candidates who won the majority of those votes were defeated in almost every instance. Scott&#39;s base of support was majority white, and in his electoral victories the county found its defense. “We&#39;ve already got a minority,” Barrett Lawrimore, the council chairman, told the New York &lt;em>;Times&lt;/em>;. Scott later said, “The system does not discriminate.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;After the court ordered the county to move toward district-based elections, Scott altered his position. He heard about someone in the county government using a racial slur, one of several instances that prompted him to think that maybe the institution wasn&#39;t color-blind. “I think the racial overtones of Charleston County government would be lessened with more minority representation, and my opinion has changed drastically since the beginning of last year,” Scott said. (Scott&#39;s campaign now denies that he ever changed his mind.) Edward Bryant III, the former head of the local NAACP, told me that it was the beginning of a pattern with Scott—it seemed as though he had to encounter racism on a personal level to acknowledge that it existed.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;ycpwzq&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;xmflbl&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;More than a decade later, two high-profile incidents—the police killing of Walter Scott and the mass shooting at Mother Emanuel AME Church in Charleston—took place in Scott&#39;s own community.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“What&#39;s happening in North Charleston?” Scott asked Bryant after the police shooting.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;“The same thing that always happens,” Bryant told him. He reiterated something that he had tried to convey to Scott since he had entered politics. “I don&#39;t care if you&#39;re a Democrat. I don&#39;t care if you&#39;re a Republican, or you&#39;re Green Party,” Bryant said. “Do something for your people.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;As proof that he has supported the Black community, Scott often cites his sponsorship of a piece of federal legislation, which passed in 2017, to give tax breaks to businesses that develop underserved, disproportionately minority neighborhoods, so-called opportunity zones. But, in 2019, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/31/business/tax-opportunity-zones.html&quot;>;&lt;em>;Times&lt;/em>; investigation&lt;/a>; found that the provision mostly helped wealthy developers with preëxisting plans to build high-end amenities in gentrifying neighborhoods, offering little to poor families who already lived there. Scott has fought successfully to reduce prison sentences for people convicted of nonviolent offenses and attempted to pass some federal police reform after the murder of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tag/george-floyd&quot;>;George Floyd&lt;/a>;, but he doesn&#39;t emphasize those parts of his record today—they don&#39;t jibe with his party&#39;s tough-on-crime talking points.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Scott has recognized that he is not immune to some of the experiences that come with being a Black man in America. On the Senate floor, he has talked about anxiously watching videos of police killings, and growing frustrated at being racially profiled. In high school, he found notes with racial slurs written in his locker. He handles that sort of thing now as he did back then: by minimizing, by emphasizing forgiveness, by delivering a message of faith. “America can do for anyone what she has done for me,” he tells people on the trail.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In August, Scott appeared at a town hall in Charleston, the beginning of a campaign jag across his home state. The crowd was overwhelmingly white and white-haired. They sat at tables and nibbled on Chick-fil-A nuggets. Scott discussed border security and tax policy, but the people in attendance seemed more interested in talking to me about race.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Seckinger, who had stopped Scott from leaving the local GOP meeting three decades ago, was there. She felt that Scott was heading toward his original political ambition. “I really want Tim to be Donald Trump&#39;s Vice-President,” she told me. “The liberals would go crazy! They cannot stand a Black Republican—it&#39;s, like, untenable for them. I don&#39;t see Tim as Black. I see Tim as my friend. But, because he&#39;s Black, it&#39;s going to drive them crazy if he&#39;s Vice-President. Isn&#39;t that something?”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Standing nearby was Margaret Rittenbury, a woman with long hair and thick glasses, who clapped along enthusiastically. She had fallen in love with Scott&#39;s politics after watching him at a Tea Party event in 2011. He&#39;d pepper his talks with amens and hallelujahs. He&#39;d describe Obama as a socialist and accuse Democrats of bankrupting the government. “We must be free to dream again,” Scott often said. “The entitlement mentality is simply uninspiring.” She marvelled at his grace, which she figured must have been hard-earned “coming up, as a Black man in the South, where, believe me, we can be mean.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;“I have metastatic cancer, but I&#39;m going to stay alive to vote for him,” she told me, her voice breaking. “He knows this country—you know the story about him growing up in poverty and all that. And, I tell you, Stall High School was horrible. At least when I was a kid. I don&#39;t try to be rude, but it was dangerous.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Stall is still trying to break its reputation as “the school that fights.” I visited the school the following day. Stephen Larson, the principal, was walking around the cafeteria, trying to connect his cell phone to the speaker system. “Two years ago, we had more fights than there were school days,” he told me. “Last year, we reduced fights by sixty per cent.” “Break My Soul,” by Beyoncé, started to play, and some students were nae-naeing in the corner. Larson had discovered that good dance music could defuse tensions.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;22dpvp&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;The fights at Stall today are no longer so-called race riots between Black and white students. Those ended—not because of a persuasive student-body president but because there are hardly any white students left. As in many schools across the country, white and Black students in North Charleston are more segregated now than they were in the eighties. Meanwhile, abundant construction jobs—partly the result of business development championed by Republicans—have drawn immigrants to the area, many of whom have settled in local trailer parks.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The school is in the midst of another demographic shift: from almost exclusively Black to Black and Latino. Its yearbook is printed in English and Spanish, and many of the new students are undocumented. As was the case in Scott&#39;s household, their parents struggle to pay the bills. But America can&#39;t do for them what it did for Scott. They would have a tough time getting to and from an after-school job—in South Carolina, being undocumented means that you can&#39;t get a driver&#39;s license. Taking accelerated courses at the local college would be a stretch, too—undocumented students don&#39;t qualify for in-state tuition. Many of the area&#39;s top students now go to charters and magnets; Stall is one of the worst-ranked schools in the state. (The best one in the county is a predominantly white magnet program that convenes on the old Bonds-Wilson campus.)&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Larson has tried to build a decent school anyway. He partnered with a local clinic so that students can receive free health care. He added more staff members to keep a closer eye on students who are struggling. Graduation rates are ticking up. He talks a lot about “showering students with love.” Recently, he told a group of students, “You go to one of the best high schools.” They laughed at him.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Larson understands that there&#39;s only so much he can control. He told me, “It&#39;s a handshake that doesn&#39;t feel right. We say, &#39;We&#39;ve got you. We&#39;re going to take care of you for four years, or longer if necessary.&#39; But I don&#39;t know what I can give you afterward.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;When Scott first became a US senator, he teared up after being told that students from his old high school were going to watch him get sworn in live on television. His campaign told me that he has tried to raise money and create internships for the school. He delivered a commencement address in 2014 and visited in 2016. “The biggest mistake I made in life . 。 。 was having dreams in high school that were too small,” he told students. “Whatever you think the best is that you can do, just double it.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Nowadays, most of the students don&#39;t even know that Scott went there, teachers told me. One of his most recent appearances was about six years ago, at an alumni event. Shawnta Brown, a parent and a racial-justice advocate, confronted Scott about the school&#39;s poor test scores and the high levels of violence, an interaction that Scott&#39;s campaign disputes. “You&#39;re not doing anything for the school at all,” she said. “You got your jersey up on the wall, and these kids look up to it, and you&#39;re not doing anything.” He smiled politely, Brown told me, then turned around and walked away. ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;q2o9zj&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 02 Nov 2023 03:06:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Remembering Robert Brustein, a Giant of the American Theatre]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.newyorker.com/culture/postscript/remembering-robert-brustein-a-giant-of-the-american-theatre]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-01T18:03:38.308Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/653fd8b10d137aa8cbc4ab10/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Shaw-Robert-Brustein-Postscript.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;article >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attribute-verso-pattern=&quot;article-body&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;ArticlePageChunks&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;When Robert Brustein died, at ninety-six, he concluded not one but four stunning careers. A critic at &lt;em>;The New Republic,&lt;/em>; off and on, for more than forty years, he was a university professor who founded two major theatres—the Yale Repertory Theatre, in New Haven, and the American Repertory Theatre, at Harvard. He authored more than a dozen books and produced hundreds of plays. Along the way, he supported and championed an entire American theatrical pantheon, including the playwrights &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1997/11/17/fortress-mamet&quot;>;David Mamet&lt;/a>; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2006/10/30/the-show-woman&quot;>;Suzan-Lori Parks&lt;/a>;, directors such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/05/30/robert-wilsons-light-installation-at-hermes&quot;>;Robert Wilson&lt;/a>; and JoAnne Akalaitis, and actors like Cherry Jones, F. Murray Abraham, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/meryl-streeps-twenties-and-my-own&quot;>;Meryl Streep&lt;/a>;. He himself was also a playwright: my favorite work of his is a klezmer-infused adaptation of Isaac Bashevis Singer&#39;s “Shlemiel the First,” produced at the ART in 1994.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Brustein held theatre to a high standard—one that was intellectual, visually audacious, international, explicitly noncommercial, and devoted to the now almost vanished model of a resident theatre company playing in a rotating repertory. One of his hallmark offerings at Harvard, for graduate students, was a class called Rep Ideal, in which he held forth on how a permanent company of actors could forge a bond between the institution and a community. Nothing else, he said, could create such a flexible acting instrument, nor offer a visiting director (say, from Eastern Europe) such a thrilling challenge. His well-forged ART company (mostly made up of gifted clowns) was, he felt, the reason his theatre could take on wild opportunities—a section of Robert Wilson&#39;s epic multimedia experiment “The Civil Wars,” for instance—that might boggle an ad-hoc ensemble.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Brustein had a fifth and more ill-defined career, too, as a public intellectual. Do we even have those anymore? A storm often brewed around Brustein—and his lightning strikes were visible across the country. His debate at Town Hall with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2001/04/16/august-wilson-been-here-and-gone&quot;>;August Wilson&lt;/a>;, in 1997, about race in American theatre, made national news: the two titans battled over everything from so-called “race blind” casting (Wilson was against it) to the formation of Black theatres (Brustein considered them self-segregating). Brustein valued the thrust and parry of the mind. In his seminal book of popular criticism, “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Theatre-Revolt-Studies-modern-drama/dp/0929587537&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Theatre-Revolt-Studies-modern-drama/dp/0929587537&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Theatre-Revolt-Studies-modern-drama/dp/0929587537&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;The Theatre of Revolt&lt;/a>;,” he asks you to understand the mutton-chopped, bourgeois Ibsen as a bomb-throwing rebel. I read “Theatre of Revolt” every year, yet, when I come across his theatrical reviews from the sixties, I sometimes recoil at their pugnacious tone—as, later in life, did he.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;At &lt;em>;The New Republic,&lt;/em>; he threw his own critical grenades, sometimes as a way to open a path for the more experimental work he loved. &lt;em>;The New Yorker&#39;s&lt;/em>; own John Lahr corresponded with Brustein in 2014 about a particularly lacerating line in a 1980 review of Tennessee Williams&#39;s “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Clothes-Summer-Hotel-Tennessee-Williams/dp/0811208710/&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Clothes-Summer-Hotel-Tennessee-Williams/dp/0811208710/&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Clothes-Summer-Hotel-Tennessee-Williams/dp/0811208710/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;Clothes for a Summer Hotel&lt;/a>;,” in which Brustein had written, “I suspect the playwright would just as soon let the moment pass in silence while he licks his wounds and ponders his next move (perhaps a flight to Three Mile Island on a one-way ticket).” In a warm e-mail exchange with Lahr, Williams&#39;s biographer, Brustein seemed sure he hadn&#39;t said any such thing. “I can&#39;t imagine myself making such a cruel and aggressive remark,” he wrote. By then, his approach to artists had softened, perhaps from age, or from the experience of being in the creative hurly-burly himself. “He disowned a lot of those fierce opinions,” Lahr told me.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Yet Brustein&#39;s legacy will, at least in part, be this air of combat. In a discussion group, the producer Rocco Landesman once laughingly reminded Brustein that he had held the rights to “Big River” when ART mounted it, after Brustein inveighed against nonprofits producing work in tandem with commercial producers. “Bob expressed great surprise but didn&#39;t change his opinion for a second,” the Public Theatre&#39;s artistic director Oskar Eustis told me over e-mail, admiring Brustein&#39;s ability to stick by a principle even while not entirely adhering to it. And, by Brustein&#39;s own account, he was partly to blame for some hostility between the Boston audience and his theatre, which lost early subscribers by the fistful after, among other things, a Lee Breuer production of Wedekind&#39;s “Lulu,” in which Jack the Ripper slashed Lulu&#39;s throat, then washed his bloody hands in a toilet bowl. “It didn&#39;t help when, in trying to account for the exodus, I opened my big mouth on radio to speculate that perhaps we had overestimated the extent of Boston&#39;s theatrical sophistication,” Brustein wrote, in a not-altogether-self-effacing essay.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;But there&#39;s another legacy, too. I first saw the great classical performer John Douglas Thompson at the ART, in a Ron Daniels production of Shakespeare&#39;s “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Henry-V-Folger-Shakespeare-Library/dp/0743484878&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Henry-V-Folger-Shakespeare-Library/dp/0743484878&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Henry-V-Folger-Shakespeare-Library/dp/0743484878&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;Henry V&lt;/a>;,” in 1995. Five actors, playing the entire French Army, appeared in a line with huge, silk-caparisoned horse puppets buckled around their waists—their feet, in platform shoes, became hooves. They pranced in place, too proud to notice that the floor (a mechanical elevator that lowered into the orchestra pit) was sinking beneath them. Thompson spoke wistfully with me about his time being honed by Brustein&#39;s year-in, year-out company model, which has since been abandoned. “With Robert being gone, the atmosphere is also gone,” Thompson told me. “It&#39;s the end of an era, of all the potential that regional theatre had built up—and what it could be going forward.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;I met Brustein as an undergraduate at Harvard in the mid-nineties, when the university was briefly reconsidering its relationship with the ART Brustein, who came to Cambridge in 1980, had installed his organization in the Loeb Drama Center, which the students had always rather assumed belonged to them. In the late nineties, Harvard held a series of panel discussions about the relationship; I was then the president of the Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club and gave a little testimonial in favor. Harvard at that time had no drama department, and so much of our education in theatre-as-practice was in making our own stuff—and in seeing the workings of a company up close.&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;I learned a lot from Brustein&#39;s classes and criticism, but perhaps even more from the plays he programmed: Shaw, Pirandello, Sophocles—writers I now too rarely get to see. My favorite place in the world was then a doorway at the back of the main-stage theatre, where you could slip in and watch the proceedings. One of the triumphs of that era was Andrei Belgrader&#39;s Rabelaisian “Ubu Rock,” in which Thomas Derrah sang a deliberately infuriating song. This “Button Song”—“My jacket has one button, one button”—goes on and on, à la “99 Bottles of Beer,” until the audience begins to jeer and fling things. A group of us would sneak in to see it every night, secure in the erroneous belief that no one would notice a line of scruffy undergrads lurking in plain view.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;hurm9d&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;uebexw&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Brustein, hearing my positive review on the Harvard panel, became both a friend and a mentor, which later led to my returning to the theatre&#39;s Institute for Advanced Theatre Training, and graduating in his final cohort in 2002. When he was retiring, I helped assemble a scrapbook of memories, which was presented to him at a ceremony. I still have the e-mail from F. Murray Abraham. “There is a line from the 23rd psalm that perfectly describes Robert Brustein for me: he restoreth my soul.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Brustein was immensely impressive. I don&#39;t mean that he was imperious—my main image of him is of a tall, slow loris, ambling around amiably, popping his head in every room—nor that he was regal, since he had a twinkly, just-about-to-pratfall affect. I mean instead that he made deep impressions on those who worked with and around him. I am a child of his mind: I see his stamp on my taste, but also my choice of career. Brustein made it seem like the most natural thing in the world to be a critic, and a surprising number of people who stood in that upstairs Loeb doorway went on to write about theatre.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Gideon Lester, another of Brustein&#39;s protégées, was in the literary department when I was there. He&#39;s now the artistic director at the Fisher Center at Bard. Lester follows the Brustein spirit of directorial empowerment (for example, the adventurous Daniel Fish version of “Oklahoma!”)—but not the letter of his anti-commercial law. (That same show went to Broadway.) Lester thinks that there&#39;s some special alchemy in the way Brustein was simultaneously an avuncular, loving figure and a bare-knuckle scrapper. “It takes real guts to run an institution which is, in certain circles, profoundly unpopular,” says Lester. “I remember, in my first years in Cambridge, going to dinner parties, meeting people, and they would say, &#39;Oh, you work at ART? I &lt;em>;hate&lt;/em>; that place.&#39; Nobody felt neutral about it.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Not feeling neutral about any of it—that was Brustein&#39;s way. He was a lion in a lost pride of critics—Eric Bentley, Harold Clurman, Richard Gilman—who had confidence in the theatre as a form and in their own ability to influence it. “It&#39;s the (critic&#39;s) job not to just look at theatre but to look after it,” Lahr said. These popular, widely read critics reviewed shows and wrote books of theory, but they also built institutions, made translations of international works, and stimulated a passionate national discussion. What we have now is close to the opposite of a thriving theatre scene—one where no one is shouting, or, if they are, they&#39;re only shouting into echo chambers. For seventy years, though, Brustein was a kind of warrior. Like those French knights in “Henry V,” he buckled on his armor, and rode into battle until—and this breaks my heart—he was playing an army all by himself. ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;2a7w1b&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 02 Nov 2023 03:06:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[The Gaza-ification of the West Bank]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.newyorker.com/news/q-and-a/the-gaza-ification-of-the-west-bank]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-01T10:00:00.000Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65414907f6fb6ae1a2e9178d/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Chotiner-West-Bank-10-31-23-site-social-image.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;article >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attribute-verso-pattern=&quot;article-body&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;ArticlePageChunks&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;A little more than three weeks ago, Hamas fighters murdered &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/11/06/israel-gaza-war-hamas&quot;>;fourteen hundred people&lt;/a>; after crossing into Israel from the Gaza Strip. Since then, much of the world&#39;s attention has been focussed on Israel&#39;s relentless &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/another-hospital-in-gaza-is-bleeding&quot;>;bombing campaign&lt;/a>; in Gaza, which has already killed thousands of Palestinians. But the West Bank, where millions of Palestinians currently live, has also seen increased violence, with more than a hundred Palestinians killed in raids conducted by Israel&#39;s military and clashes between Israelis and Palestinians. Israeli settlers—often with the support of the Army—have also kicked scores of Palestinian families off their land.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I recently spoke by phone with Hagai El-Ad, an Israeli activist and the former executive director of the nonprofit organization B&#39;Tselem, which works on human-rights issues in the occupied territories. During our conversation, which has been edited for length and clarity, we discussed what October 7th did and did not change in the West Bank, how the process of removing families from their land occurs, and Israel&#39;s long-term plans for the West Bank.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;What has been happening in the West Bank since the attacks of October 7th?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The Israeli goal of cleansing as much of Area C as possible from Palestinian communities is not a new goal. Area C is just over sixty per cent of the West Bank—basically, all of the West Bank outside of the major Palestinian population centers and towns. All of the Jewish settlements in the West Bank are in Area C. The major Palestinian population centers are like holes in Swiss cheese, where the cheese itself is Area C, engulfing everything: the Jordan Valley, the South Hebron Hills, part of the northern West Bank.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;These Palestinian communities have been under threat and pressure of military violence and settler violence and whatnot for years already. The legal phrase that describes it is creating a “coercive environment” so that the Palestinians will leave of their own volition—that they will just eventually, one day, collapse under this ongoing pressure. And this is not new.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;What has happened since October 7th is an escalation of this process. The Israeli state, through its settlers, is trying to take advantage of the fact that all eyes are on Gaza and is intensifying dramatically the pressure on Palestinian communities. I would assume from the Israeli perspective this has been a success. Thirteen Palestinian communities have basically fled in horror in the three weeks since October 7th.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;When you say “Palestinian communities,” I know that can refer to groups of different sizes. What is meant by a community?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Sometimes it can be the home of a few families, maybe some fifty individuals who live in a place, and then bigger communities. Think of a small village: around a hundred or two hundred people, who have been living on the land for decades, trying to make a living. Some of the communities in the South Hebron Hills, what they&#39;re really doing is making the desert bloom. They&#39;re working, trying to make a living from agriculture, in very difficult environmental conditions. And Israel systematically deprives them. I mean not only everything they&#39;ve destroyed already but, for instance, depriving them of running water, from being connected to the grid, from being connected to electricity and basic services.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;And also just to be very clear, everything that I&#39;ve been describing, all of these various mechanisms that the state has been using, are backed by Israeli courts, and backed by the Israeli legal system. This is not some random phenomena that is happening uniquely to a single unlucky community far from the eyes of the state. On the contrary, this is part of an ongoing Israeli state project of trying to push, to cleanse, as many Palestinians out of Area C, using all available state mechanisms in order to accomplish this goal. They refuse to give building permits for Palestinians there. And you should think of what is making the headlines recently—settler violence—as one of those tools that has been used by the state when other tools, again, from their perspective, haven&#39;t proved effective enough.&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;There have been &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-67173344&quot;>;reports&lt;/a>; that the Israeli Army has assisted or stood by as these settlers have ejected Palestinian communities. When we read that settlers are moving Palestinians out of an area, what does that look like? How does that operate and what specifically is the role of the state?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;First try to imagine a reality in which already, for years, you are living in this situation in which you can&#39;t get a building permit because Israel just doesn&#39;t give many to Palestinian communities. So you&#39;re under constant threat of home demolition, and sometimes not only the threat. Sometimes the bulldozers show up. You&#39;re not allowed to have running water or electricity; maybe you have electricity from solar panels that were donated to you by a European humanitarian agency. And even those solar panels sometimes get confiscated by the Army with the excuse that they&#39;re not legal. Sometimes the Army comes and trains on your field. Sometimes settlers show up and rough up some people, beat them, threaten them. Sometimes soldiers come and do that.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;There are checkpoints. There are threats. And all this goes on for years. And yet somehow you managed to stay on the land and make a living and try to raise a family under these conditions. And that in and of itself is horrific and criminal and appalling, and also happens in broad daylight. Everything I&#39;ve been talking about now and describing has been documented for years already by Palestinian, Israeli, and international human-rights organizations. But Israel never relented and never stopped because, as I said, it&#39;s part of the state&#39;s goal to accomplish that. What has escalated in recent weeks is that you have repeated reports of masked men showing up in the middle of the night. Armed, masked men.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;8ynv5&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;j3m5qc&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Maybe they are settlers, maybe they&#39;re soldiers, maybe they&#39;re a mix. And they openly threaten the people in the community and tell them that they have twenty-four hours to leave, and if you say otherwise we would wipe you out. You asked me specifically about the involvement of soldiers, if anyone is now shocked that Israeli soldiers are involved in this. You should have been shocked five years ago. You should have been shocked twenty years ago. Because the involvement of soldiers has been also documented for years, not only with testimonies but also with video footage.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;There will be a group of armed settlers who come to the outskirts of a Palestinian community and attack the community. There are soldiers with them who almost always protect the attacking settlers and sometimes join them in attacking the Palestinians. And of course Palestinians, if they try to act in self-defense, will almost always have that used as an excuse to frame them as terrorists and to use lethal force against them. It cannot be overstated how exposed the lives of Palestinians are in the West Bank under these conditions. This is the reality that Palestinian communities all over the West Bank are always facing.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;What&#39;s your understanding of what the Israeli government is doing here? And I don&#39;t mean to make a moral distinction necessarily, but I&#39;m just trying to understand how this operates. Is this the Israeli government, the Israeli military, pursuing an active policy of helping settlers uproot Palestinian communities? Or is it your sense that there&#39;s vigilantism among Israeli soldiers and the Israeli government is fine with that going on?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Some readers might think that there is a distinction between potentially “bad settlers” and the Israeli state. The question is to what extent is the state effective in handling these “bad settlers”? This is the wrong way of thinking about it. The uprooting of Palestinian communities all over the West Bank is not a project of the settlers, the bad ones, the good ones, or the other ones. It is a state project. All of these policies have been in place in a variety of ways. There are legal mechanisms that the state has been using to take land from Palestinians and settle Jewish communities on it instead. It&#39;s so cynical, it&#39;s really unbelievable. But that is the way things have been unfolding in the West Bank for more than half a century already. There are announcements of new state land. Who&#39;s the state in the West Bank? It&#39;s the Israeli state. So land that&#39;s announced as state land is public land, and then cannot be used for the benefit of the Palestinian population. It&#39;s used by the state for the purpose it wants to advance, which is Jewish settlement, right? And the regime issues building permits for Jewish settlements and issues demolition orders for Palestinian communities.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;All of these things that I&#39;ve been describing are official bureaucratic mechanisms backed by government ministries, the Army, the Israeli courts, all of these entities working jointly to achieve the same goal, pushing out Palestinians, taking over their land. When these official mechanisms fail and Palestinian communities show perseverance to stay on the land, then what you have is that other mechanism, the one that tends to make more headlines. You might catch sight of a violent settler torching a Palestinian&#39;s field or using weapons provided to the settlers by the Army.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;hyl31j&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;But a coercive environment rather than forcible transfer is more beneficial for the Israeli state. All of those boring, bureaucratic, complicated mechanisms that I&#39;ve described, the balance there is that, on the one hand, you need patience because you&#39;re making the lives of people a nightmare for a long duration of time. But the upside is that maybe after five years, maybe after ten years, they will just give up. And, if they give up, then you don&#39;t end up with sensational TV footage that might create alarm internationally.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;What we&#39;ve been seeing since October 7th, after all these years of suffering and orchestrated bureaucratic violence, are direct threats and direct actions against these communities. It happens very quickly, but it does create international friction, and that is the balance that Israel has been playing with, trying to accomplish as much displacement of Palestinians as possible while paying the minimal international price.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;My understanding of the Netanyahu government&#39;s approach to the Palestinians before October 7th was that Gaza, at least rhetorically, was largely ignored, but that many extremist officials would talk openly about the need to expand settlements in the West Bank. Has that changed? How much is this rhetoric about Israelis taking more land in the West Bank happening out in the open and how much is it quietly taking advantage of a situation when everyone&#39;s attention is focussed on Gaza?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The displacement of Palestinians and the growth of settlements—these are two processes that go hand in hand. This is not about this government, this is not about Netanyahu or his ministers. This is an Israeli project that has been unfolding under left, right, and center governments. Each and every one of them have been doing exactly this since 1967. Let&#39;s not be ahistorical. That is a key part of understanding what is unfolding here. Because if there&#39;s a sense that somehow this is about, as I said before, “bad settlers” or this is somehow about a specific individual who has been Prime Minister for a long time, then we&#39;re missing the bigger picture.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;I asked about the current government because I&#39;m interested in how they have rhetorically handled what has been going on in the West Bank during the last three weeks.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;There is almost zero media coverage in Hebrew in Israel about this. One of the only news outlet that professionally addresses this is &lt;em>;Haaretz&lt;/em>;. Almost no one else discusses it. And to the extent that it is being discussed by other outlets, it is in a very specific context, not about the brutality and the sickening efforts to try and take advantage of the current situation in order to destroy Palestinian communities. It is only discussed in the context of what is perceived to be the Israeli interest of trying to limit the military conflict to Gaza, so that there won&#39;t be another front that opens in the West Bank. So you would have commentators on TV saying, “This is bad for us because if this continues maybe we are risking an uprising of Palestinians in the West Bank.” Forcible transfer is a war crime, plain and simple. This is brutality against innocent civilians that are trying to have a life on their land. It&#39;s not discussed in that way.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;i3ffm&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;xxrhd&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;I&#39;m very cognizant of what you said. But we have heard over and over again that this is the most right-wing government in Israel&#39;s history. In the first nine months of this government&#39;s existence, before the current war, was the situation in the West Bank different at all?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I think it was indisputable that the situation was escalating, absolutely. But the situation was not new. These processes that I&#39;ve been describing have been unfolding for years already, and the differences from one decade to the next, one government to the next, have been in the pace, but not in the over-all trajectory. Even right-wing governments, when they feel international pushback, would take a step back for a month or two until attention moves somewhere else.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Then they would pick up the pace again. In that sense, it&#39;s always heading in the same direction. This is how Israel accomplished getting more than two hundred and fifty settlements and more than seven hundred and fifty thousand settlers into the West Bank, including East Jerusalem. One step at a time, always trying to fly below the level of international outrage that might trigger a real response. Think about a memorable moment from this government, the pogrom by Israeli settlers in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2023/06/15/middleeast/huwara-west-bank-settler-attack-cmd-intl/index.html&quot;>;Huwara&lt;/a>;. Many dozens of settlers were involved in the pogrom. That caused a lot of outrage because of the statement Bezalel Smotrich, the finance minister, made about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.timesofisrael.com/smotrich-says-his-call-to-wipe-out-huwara-was-an-emotional-slip-of-the-tongue/#:~:text=At%20a%20conference%20on%20Wednesday,law%20into%20their%20own%20hands.%E2%80%9D&quot;>;wiping out&lt;/a>; Huwara and so on. That&#39;s like a large-scale pogrom. I wouldn&#39;t say that this didn&#39;t happen before, but it wasn&#39;t a frequent occurrence. So that was definitely a moment of escalation under this government.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;How come so many settlers thought that they could be involved in that and get away with it? That there would be no consequences? They have been enjoying this kind of impunity for decades. Not just in recent months but also under previous governments that were more internationally digestible.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;What happens to these Palestinian communities who are kicked off their land? Is there any sort of infrastructure to help them? What&#39;s a typical journey like for a Palestinian family who&#39;s been forced to move?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;There are international agencies, and obviously they&#39;re doing their best, but what is not happening is the rebuilding of those communities on their land. People will be typically forced to move to other villages, other Palestinian communities, which is exactly as the Israelis desire. And Palestinians will be told openly by Israeli officials, by settlers, that their future is in Area A, not in Area C. Area A is twenty per cent of the West Bank—the large Palestinian population centers.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;So the goal seems to be to insure that more and more people in Area C are in Area A, so that the Palestinian communities in the West Bank are concentrated in several large, denser areas?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Yeah. And you can think about this process as the Gaza-ification of the West Bank. One step at a time, Israel is pushing Palestinians in that direction. There will be a number of Palestinian Bantustans, Gaza-style, all over the West Bank. And each one of these Palestinian enclaves is already surrounded and gradually will be more surrounded by this mix of measures, whether it be Israeli infrastructure such as roads or military bases or walls or fences or settlements and so on. And if one visits any one of the large Palestinian cities like Hebron, Jenin, or Ramallah, you will see this process gradually unfolding. ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;d7mb0h&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 02 Nov 2023 00:06:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Exploring the Imaginative Worlds of Blind Children in “The Unicorn in Snowpants Suddenly Ran Off”]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-new-yorker-documentary/exploring-the-imaginative-worlds-of-blind-children-in-the-unicorn-in-snowpants-suddenly-ran-off]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-01T10:00:00.000Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65416f7a4b957cead1177915/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/UNICORNS_THUMB_5.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;article >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attribute-verso-pattern=&quot;article-body&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;ArticlePageChunks&quot; >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;feature-large-callout&quot; >;&lt;figure >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;script-container&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;span >;&lt;p>;“I think for both blind children and seeing children, imagination and fantasy are important in constructing play worlds,” Philipp Schaeffer said. “What is striking is how different these play worlds look for blind and for seeing children.”&lt;/p>; &lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;At her desk, a young blind girl, Mia, types and reads aloud a story she is writing about her family. “A glowing sphere, large like a horse—it took in my great-grandfather, then it burst,” she says. “Ever since, something has been different with him. He no longer walked around like a normal person. He flew.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;And so begins “The Unicorn in Snowpants Suddenly Ran Off,” a short documentary by the German filmmaker Philipp Schaeffer, which follows three blind preteens as they invite us into their worlds of play and whimsy. “I think for both blind children and seeing children, imagination and fantasy are important in constructing play worlds,” Schaeffer told me over e-mail. “What is striking is how different these play worlds look for blind and for seeing children.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Throughout the film, we witness the kids delighting in their imaginations. Mia writes stories and devises her own secret language. Julian uses his family&#39;s phone and a digital recording device, creating a collage out of the music and voices he hears on the other line. Martha walks through a field of brush; she spins tales about unicorns and describes encoded messages communicated in birdsong. These moments of childhood wonder and joy come with assistive technologies and work-arounds: Mia types on a braille notetaker; Julian commits phone numbers to memory rather than jotting them down; Martha uses a white cane on her journey through the field.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Schaeffer, whose grandmother is blind, has a long-standing fascination with perception—he&#39;s interested in conveying what it would be like to experience life the way that a person who is unable to see does. He spent several weeks finding the short&#39;s three young subjects, and he filmed them in late 2020 and early 2021. He wanted to make a documentary about children on the cusp of adolescence, a formative time when kids are “at a threshold,” he told me—“that moment when increasing self-awareness and the onset of the questions of teenage life bring one to leave behind the world of play and fantasy.” Schaeffer added, “For blind children, that transformation is particularly defining, because it comes with the realization that one is fundamentally different.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;We are able to glimpse this tension, between the enjoyment of imagination and the yearning for reality, in a scene where Martha confides to her mother, Maike, that she wishes to attend a school where, she imagines, “you speak about real things, not fantasy.” The camera quickly catches her mother&#39;s silent reaction, of worry and understanding. It&#39;s a sobering moment, and one that speaks to the empathy and hope that underlie the film.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Mia, Julian, and Martha encounter challenges as they navigate a world that&#39;s built for those who see. The short seems to issue an invitation to sighted viewers, to have them imagine what it would be like to confront their surroundings without sight, by framing the children in visually arresting settings—a sprawling hillside, an empty dining-room table, a chilly grassland. How might one comprehend those places by close listening and careful interpretation? This scenario—to play deeply with perception—mirrors the games of invention at the heart of the documentary. “I imagined the story so well,” Mia says, at the end of the film, as we see her with her brother, silhouetted against a darkening sky. “I could see the images in my head.”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 02 Nov 2023 00:06:01 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[How Has Big Publishing Changed American Fiction?]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.newyorker.com/books/under-review/how-has-big-publishing-changed-american-fiction]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-01T10:00:00.000Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/654113606ae4e25e0932fa33/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Lozano-Big-Fiction-Static.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;article >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attribute-verso-pattern=&quot;article-body&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;ArticlePageChunks&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;In 1989, Gerald Howard had been a book editor for about ten years, and his future filled him with dread. His primary fear, he wrote in a widely read essay for &lt;em>;The American Scholar&lt;/em>;, was “a faster, huger, rougher, dumber publishing world.” He had entered the industry during a time of profound change. In the course of a few decades, American publishing had transformed from a parochial cultural industry, mostly centered on the East Coast, into an international, corporate affair. Starting in the nineteen-sixties, outfits like Random House and Penguin were seen as ripe targets for acquisition by multinational conglomerates like RCA and Pearson, which wanted to diversify their revenue streams, whether through oil, textbooks, calculators, or literary fiction. These parent companies changed the business of books, inciting an arms race that encouraged publishers to grow larger and larger, consolidating and concentrating the industry into a few giant players. Howard&#39;s career had overlapped with this period of flux, and he saw before him a brutal, profit- and growth-obsessed landscape, inimical to his work. Corporate publishers like Penguin moved and grooved “to the tune of big-time finance,” he wrote. This dance was no “fox-trot; it&#39;s a bruising slam dance,” he observed. “From down here on the shop floor, the results often look ludicrous and disastrous.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Last year, shortly before the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/is-publishing-about-art-or-commerce-penguin-random-house-simon-schuster-antitrust&quot;>;antitrust trial&lt;/a>; that successfully blocked a planned merger of Penguin Random House and Simon &amp;amp; Schuster, Howard, who had recently retired, wrote for &lt;em>;Publishers Weekly&lt;/em>; looking back on how the industry had changed in the course of his career. The slam dance had continued, its pace only more harried. The corporate houses had grown exponentially since the eighties, and swallowed up their competitors. Trade publishing was dominated by an even smaller group of companies that exerted an immense influence on the reading habits of Americans. When Penguin merged with Random House, in 2013, Howard took to calling the resulting behemoth Cosmodemonic Publishing. The scale of the company, the thousands of employees and hundreds of imprints, were, he says, “simply too large and abstract for a mere editor to get his head around.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Howard still had hope for publishing; his “worst fears,” that the Cosmodemonic realm would engender a “race to the commercial bottom and a relentless quest for profits above quality,” hadn&#39;t come to pass. Books were still good, the work still worthwhile, despite the stiff headwinds. But he admitted to a nagging unease: “At a certain point in my tenure at Penguin Random House I just gave up trying to understand a lot of the emails that arrived from corporate and would just hit delete, asking myself quizzically, &#39;And the contribution this makes to the actual publication of actual books is . 。 。 ?&#39; ”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;That discomforting riddle—what these business machinations contribute to the actual publication of actual books—is the central question of Dan Sinykin&#39;s “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Big-Fiction-Conglomeration-Publishing-Literature/dp/0231192959&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Big-Fiction-Conglomeration-Publishing-Literature/dp/0231192959&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Big-Fiction-Conglomeration-Publishing-Literature/dp/0231192959&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;Big Fiction: How Conglomeration Changed the Publishing Industry and American Literature&lt;/a>;.” Sinykin argues that the corporate ethos that dominates the modern publishing house has exerted such an overwhelming influence on the way books are written and published that it has inaugurated a new epoch: “the Conglomerate era.” As he sees it, the consolidation of the industry that began in the nineteen-sixties and seventies transformed American fiction and “changed what it means to be an author.” The stakes of Sinykin&#39;s inquiry are to explain “how we should read” fiction published in the US during the past half century or so, a period during which every book, no matter its preoccupations or themes, could be said to reflect a greater entity: the corporation.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Sinykin&#39;s study begins in the postwar years, when publishing was a smaller and more cloistered world. The companies were mostly family-owned and -run, bookstores and book critics were influential but far fewer in number, and costs were less daunting. The editor Jason Epstein recalls, at the time, an author could sell “six or seven thousand copies” and “make the average book profitable.” When Epstein joined Random House, in 1958, it was owned by its founders, Bennett Cerf and Donald Klopfer, a pair of cultured patricians who were famous for publishing James Joyce&#39;s “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Ulysses-James-Joyce/dp/1546586032&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Ulysses-James-Joyce/dp/1546586032&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Ulysses-James-Joyce/dp/1546586032&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;Ulysses&lt;/a>;,” in 1934. The company was housed in a Gilded Age mansion that served as a second home for its writers. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1975/01/20/remembering-wystan-h-auden-who-died-in-the-night-of-the-twenty-eighth-of-september-1973&quot;>;WH Auden&lt;/a>; felt comfortable enough to show up in house slippers to hand in his latest work.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Soon after Epstein started at Random House, Cerf and Klopfer decided to take the company public. The change had a tangible impact on the way the business was run. Epstein writes in his memoir “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Book-Business-Publishing-Present-Future/dp/0393322343&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Book-Business-Publishing-Present-Future/dp/0393322343&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Book-Business-Publishing-Present-Future/dp/0393322343&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;Book Business&lt;/a>;,” that Cerf, newly accountable to shareholders, “would chew the corner of his white linen handkerchief in anguish whenever the stock fell.” When Random House was privately owned, it could withstand a “slow season,” because publishers knew that selling books required patience. But the need to balance concerns of taste with sound financial decision-making made it harder to play the long game: enter the profit-and-loss statement, the five-year budget, and, eventually, the need to frame every book as a potential best-seller.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;This same story was unfolding across the industry. In 1960, New American Library, one of the country&#39;s largest and most successful mass-market-paperback publishers, was acquired by the newspaper company Times Mirror and then forced to reckon with a McKinsey-led reorganization. Another mass-market publisher, Pocket Books, went public that same year and merged with the trade publisher Simon &amp;amp; Schuster in 1966. A year after its IPO, Random House acquired one of its rivals, Knopf, and then the whole enterprise was gobbled up by the electronics conglomerate RCA, in 1965. Across town, Doubleday began a spending spree in the late sixties to keep up, launching a broadcast subsidiary and acquiring a number of radio and TV stations throughout the country. (In a little more than a decade&#39;s time, Doubleday would buy a majority stake in the New York Mets.)&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;As publishers scaled up their expansionary aspirations, new powers emerged: forces like literary agents and chain bookstores, intricate marketing campaigns and high-stakes auctions, helped to forge a different way of doing business, a process of diversifying and rationalizing that led to a larger, more stratified, and more economically conscious sphere, dominated by daunting hierarchies of power and money.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Today&#39;s publishing house is closer to a hedge fund than a tastemaker. Every book that it acquires is a bet on profitability. The financialization of the acquisition process, functions like an index of risk, creating a “system in which homogeneity . 。 。 is encouraged” to minimize bad bets. This system affects all houses, no matter their size. Every season, Big Five publishers are incentivized to pursue best-sellers, authors whose works can scale into a franchise or a movie. Meanwhile, independent publishers and nonprofits such as WW Norton and Graywolf Press seek to carve out their own niche in this ecosystem by focussing on books with small but ardent audiences (poetry, the literature of marginalized voices). Sinykin sidesteps the question of whether this system has made books worse. He wants to demonstrate something trickier: how the process of authoring a book has become subsumed by a larger and larger network of interests, changing what it meant to be an author. Critics and scholars, Sinykin contends, are uncomfortable displacing the author when studying literature. His book is an earnest attempt to focus attention on the non-authorial figures involved in a book&#39;s creation. Instead of individual writers, he wants us to think in terms of a “feedback loop.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;If there is a villain in “Big Fiction,” it is the “romantic” conception of authorship—the idea that writing a book is as simple as an author sitting down and marshalling their creative forces. This sense of the author, Sinykin thinks, is “a mirage veiling the systematic intelligences that are responsible for more of what we read than most of us are ready to acknowledge.” By “systematic intelligences,” he means the coördinated efforts of the dozens of people who touch a book before it makes its way into the hands of a reader.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Before conglomeration, Sinykin asserts, writing a book “was a completely different experience.” Once, a would-be novelist&#39;s chances of being published depended on “how easily you could get your book in the right editor&#39;s hands.” As the number of those involved in publication expanded, authors had to meet new criteria. “Could marketers see a market? What would the chain bookbuyers think? Could publicists picture your face on TV, your voice on the radio? Could agents sniff subsidiary rights? Would foreign rights sell at the Frankfurt Book Fair? Might your story be remediated? Would it work in audio? On the big screen?”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Sinykin calls authors who successfully navigated the maze of agents, marketers, and booksellers “industrial writers.” This group includes chart-topping genre writers, such as Danielle Steel, Michael Crichton, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1998/09/07/what-are-you-afraid-of-stephen-king-profile&quot;>;Stephen King&lt;/a>;, and also literary novelists who managed to work within the new system. Among Sinykin&#39;s most succinct and persuasive case studies involves the career of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/postscript/cormac-mccarthys-narrative-wisdom&quot;>;Cormac McCarthy&lt;/a>;. In 1965, McCarthy&#39;s first novel, an allusive Southern gothic called “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Orchard-Keeper-Cormac-McCarthy/dp/0679728724&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Orchard-Keeper-Cormac-McCarthy/dp/0679728724&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Orchard-Keeper-Cormac-McCarthy/dp/0679728724&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;The Orchard Keeper&lt;/a>;,” was published by a legendary editor at Random House named Albert Erskine. Erskine, who had been a steward for the company&#39;s most distinguished writers, including &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/11/30/william-faulkners-demons&quot;>;William Faulkner&lt;/a>; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1952/05/31/black-mans-burden&quot;>;Ralph Ellison&lt;/a>;, found a manuscript by McCarthy in the slush pile and committed himself to fostering his career. Though McCarthy&#39;s early books rarely sold, he was able to survive outside the market with the help of fellowships and grants secured through Erskine&#39;s influence.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;When Erskine retired, in 1987, McCarthy needed a new patron. He reached out to Lynn Nesbit, an agent who represented &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-dance-between-editor-and-writer-in-turn-every-page&quot;>;Robert Caro&lt;/a>;, among others. Nesbit passed McCarthy on to her protégée, Amanda (Binky) Urban. By chance, Urban was an admirer of McCarthy&#39;s work. She made it her mission to insure that his next book would be a hit. She called up Sonny Mehta, who had recently been installed as the editor-in-chief of Knopf. Mehta sent McCarthy to an ambitious editor named Gary Fisketjon. As Fisketjon went to work on McCarthy&#39;s prose, Mehta and his most trusted publicist, Jane Friedman, the woman credited with inventing the author tour, set about “aggressively marketing” McCarthy&#39;s reinvention. They enlisted the photographer &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/photo-booth/the-stories-behind-marion-ettlingers-author-portraits&quot;>;Marion Ettlinger&lt;/a>; to shoot a dashing author portrait and the designer Chip Kidd to create an enticing cover for his next book. That book was 1992&#39;s “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Pretty-Horses-Border-Trilogy-Book/dp/0679744398&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Pretty-Horses-Border-Trilogy-Book/dp/0679744398&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Pretty-Horses-Border-Trilogy-Book/dp/0679744398&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;All the Pretty Horses&lt;/a>;,” which sold a hundred and ninety thousand copies in its first six months and was adapted into a Hollywood movie in 2000, starring Matt Damon. By 2007, when Oprah&#39;s Book Club and the Pulitzer Prize anointed “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Road-Cormac-McCarthy/dp/0307387895&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Road-Cormac-McCarthy/dp/0307387895&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Road-Cormac-McCarthy/dp/0307387895&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;The Road&lt;/a>;,” McCarthy was no longer perceived as a writer of difficult, obscure fiction but an approachable mainstream celebrity author.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Many of Sinykin&#39;s claims about how fiction has changed in the past fifty years—that novelists are under pressure to bring in consistent profit, that literary writers have incorporated genre tropes into their work—are broadly true. But his account of how individual authors have responded to conglomeration requires us to take on faith many of his claims. We never see a manuscript page or editorial interventions that might illustrate these writers&#39; explicit acquiescence to the market interests of their stakeholders.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In an extended section on Toni Morrison&#39;s “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Beloved-Toni-Morrison/dp/1400033411&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Beloved-Toni-Morrison/dp/1400033411&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Beloved-Toni-Morrison/dp/1400033411&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;Beloved&lt;/a>;,” Sinykin argues that the novel&#39;s success was partly due to its incorporation of horror elements in a time when horror authors like Stephen King were the industry&#39;s most consistent commodities. In “Beloved,” Sinykin writes, Morrison “made good on the trend, deploying a ghost, a haunted house, terrifying violence, and trauma in her high modernist neo-slave narrative.” But there is no evidence that Morrison was consciously modelling her novel on horror fiction in response to the genre&#39;s success, or that her editor, or her publisher&#39;s marketing department, was urging her in this direction.&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Sinykin&#39;s reading of “Beloved” is part of a larger argument that “conglomeration led to the production of fiction that allegorized conglomeration itself.” “Beloved” is not just a horror novel, he argues; it is a novel about “publishing.” As evidence, he offers a preamble on Morrison&#39;s career as an editor and the challenges that she faced at Random House. One of the publishing house&#39;s only Black editors, she battled indifference from a white staff and grew to resent the demands placed on her as a trade editor. In 1983, she quit her job to write full time.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;bsp7lb&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;In a foreword she wrote to “Beloved” some years after the novel became her most successful, she returned to the frustrations of her editorial job, acknowledging that the book had been made possible when she was freed from her nine-to-five:&lt;/p>;&lt;blockquote >;&lt;div >;&lt;p>;I had no agenda and couldn&#39;t hear the telephone if it rang. I heard my heart, though, stomping away in my chest like a colt. 。 。 。 Then it slapped me: I was happy, free in a way I had never been, ever. It was the oddest sensation. Not ecstasy, not satisfaction, not a surfeit of pleasure or accomplishment . 。 。 Enter &lt;em>;Beloved&lt;/em>;.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/blockquote>;&lt;p >;Sinykin takes this as a testament that the book&#39;s meditation on the fragility of freedom after slavery was inspired by the freedom that Morrison felt after leaving her editorial job.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;“Big Fiction” is explicitly indebted to Mark McGurl&#39;s “&lt;a data-offer-url=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Program-Era-Postwar-Fiction-Creative/dp/0674062094&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.amazon.com/Program-Era-Postwar-Fiction-Creative/dp/0674062094&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Program-Era-Postwar-Fiction-Creative/dp/0674062094&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;The Program Era&lt;/a>;,” a historical study of the structural and creative effects of creative-writing programs on postwar American fiction. McGurl provides his own reading of “Beloved” that argues the plantation in the novel is a metaphor for the education system.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The clumsiness of these readings points to the limitations of works like “Big Fiction” and “The Program Era.” These are daring attempts to map the larger structures that shape how books are written and published, but their attention to the big picture can obscure how novels operate on a visceral, textual level. Still, Sinykin&#39;s study is valuable because it speaks to the same fear that Gerald Howard voiced in 1989: that the balance of culture and commerce at the heart of publishing is increasingly weighted toward profit.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Sinykin won&#39;t render a direct verdict on whether conglomeration has been bad for literature. But the processes he describes have been bad for writers, whose livelihoods are subject to the vicissitudes of a boom-and-bust economy. And they have been bad for publishing employees, from the warehouse to the cubicle, who are at the mercy of layoffs and constant reorganizations forced upon publishers by their parent companies. Nine months after the Justice Department won its case to block the merger between Penguin Random House and Simon &amp;amp; Schuster, a private-equity firm won the bidding sweepstakes to take over Simon &amp;amp; Schuster. The future of corporate publishing seems as uncertain and chaotic as ever.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In &lt;a href=&quot;https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2023/01/markus-dohles-failed-bid-to-eat-simon-and-schuster.html&quot;>;a postmortem of the PRH trial&lt;/a>;, a reporter for &lt;em>;New York&lt;/em>; pointed out that there has long been a fear that the company was “too bureaucratic, too unwieldy,” a place that stifled creativity. Resources were put behind books that were “safe bets,” homogeneity was rewarded, and risks were rarely taken. Though contemporary corporate publishing is superficially more diverse, less reliant on an exclusionary social sphere, than publishing of the postwar years was, the industry still struggles to foster a heterogeneous literary culture. According to a 2020 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/12/11/opinion/culture/diversity-publishing-industry.html&quot;>;study by the academic Richard Jean So&lt;/a>;, between 1950 and 2018, ninety-five per cent of the English-language fiction books major publishers put out were written by white authors. A 2019 survey showed eighty-five per cent of the people who acquire and edit books in the US are also white.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;2xshz2&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;When it comes to individual writers, the effect of corporatization on fiction is apparent less in the quality of any single novel than across an author&#39;s career. Cormac McCarthy benefitted from a close working relationship with a devoted editor that afforded him the opportunity to write without fear of having to earn back his advance. By the time he became a celebrity and best-selling author, he had established a distinctive style and had amassed a body of work, two key factors in his ability to secure a durable readership. As Sinykin points out, a career like McCarthy&#39;s would not be possible today. Most young writers never receive the attention and care needed for their talent to come to maturity; if their first novel fails, as most débuts do, they are written off as a bad investment before they have a chance to publish another.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In casting a spotlight on the many players—editors, publishers, agents, booksellers—whose coördinated labor is required to create a book, Sinykin makes a compelling case that books are not produced by a single author but through a collective effort. But does that mean that the corporation itself should be thought of as an “author,” as Sinykin suggests? At times, he seems to overstate the “systematic intelligence,” the machinelike efficiency, of the publishing houses under whose imprints books appear. As a parade of industry executives testified in the course of the PRH antitrust trial last year, a certain amount of randomness defines everything about literary success. No one ultimately knows which books will make money, let alone make it onto the classics shelf. The editor &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/postscript/remembering-daniel-menaker-a-lighthearted-champion-of-his-writers&quot;>;Daniel Menaker&lt;/a>; once compared the acquisition process to a bad night at a casino, saying, “You put your money down and most of the time you lose.” In this respect, at least, nothing about the math of publishing has changed in the conglomerate era. ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 01 Nov 2023 23:06:02 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
