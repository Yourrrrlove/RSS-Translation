data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;周六早上，凯文·麦卡锡 (Kevin McCarthy) 向华盛顿的每个人，包括他自己分裂的会议的成员，转向民主党将通过一项临时拨款措施以避免政府关闭。这是几天甚至几周以来唯一的前进道路。但他拒绝这样做，主要是因为他自己的政治生存受到威胁。不仅来自该党流氓右翼的大约二十名成员反对与民主党控制的参议院达成任何妥协，而且其中一些人还直接威胁麦卡锡：如果他投降，他们将剥夺他的议长职位。其中一位成员，&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/04/19/the-gops-matt-gaetz-problem&quot;>;Matt Gaetz&lt;/a>;，他一直更像是混乱的代理人而不是理论家，明确表示他无论如何都会试图驱逐麦卡锡。一名共和党工作人员将盖茨称为“我们只是讨厌凯文联盟”的领导人。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;麦卡锡的领导风格长期以来一直是一个优点和缺点：他是一个和解者，而不是一个议程制定者。 “他的做法是给每个人他们想要的东西，”一位高级希尔工作人员 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/12/26/what-kevin-mccarthy-will-do -to-gain-power&quot;>;曾经&lt;/a>;告诉过我。 “这都是关于会员管理的。他的选民是共和党会议的成员。”在过去的九个月里，麦卡锡竭尽全力安抚被称为众议院自由核心小组的极右派系。他最显着的让步是恢复一项名为“空出主席动议”的程序机制，该机制允许一名成员投票罢免议长。他还赋予自由核心小组成员对众议院规则的更多控制权，并在他们的坚持下成立了一个“联邦政府武器化”小组委员会。 9月12日，当代表们在夏季休会后返回华盛顿时，麦卡锡再次屈服，并宣布对总统进行正式弹劾调查。他说：“无论证据带我们去哪里，我们都会去哪里。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;尽管他尽了最大努力，但与自由核心小组的冲突还是不可避免的。自 2015 年成立以来，其成员一直与共和党领导层发生冲突，推翻约翰·博纳 (John Boehner)，阻止麦卡锡接替他，然后在保罗·瑞安 (Paul Ryan) 接任后与他对抗。博纳称他们为“立法恐怖分子”。周五，我与一位前共和党领导班子进行了交谈，他对麦卡锡的议长职位做出了严重的预测。在之前的共和党国会中，自由核心小组更加团结，但权力较小。 “我们拥有更多的多数，因此 HFC 必须一致行动才能发挥影响力，而且他们有一份要求清单，”这位前工作人员说。 “现在每个人都有不同的诉求，而且都有个人权力。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;共和党在众议院拥有五票多数，因此麦卡锡从一开始就很脆弱。一月份，他遭遇了尴尬的挫折，二十名保守派共和党人（几乎全部来自自由核心小组）阻止他当选议长。麦卡锡经过十五轮投票才赢得多数人的支持。在他闭门做出几项承诺后，抵制者的态度才有所缓和。这些都是握手协议，但其中一些是明确的并被广泛报道。例如，麦卡锡任命自由核心小组成员担任关键委员会和领导职务，实质上是将他们纳入其中。一位共和党人&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-political-scene/the-sound-and-fury-of -the-house-freedom-caucus&quot;>;当时告诉我的。 “他们会为此抱怨、抱怨，然后继续上福克斯。自从议长投票以来，情况发生了变化。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;今年春天，在&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-political-scene/the-risky-gamble-of -kevin-mccarthys-debt-ceiling-strategy&quot;>;关于提高债务上限的争论&lt;/a>;，众议院保守派愿意迫使联邦违约以削减政府支出。麦卡锡用来与白宫谈判的法案是由自由核心小组制定的。但是，当他修改它时，正如每个人都知道的那样，为了达成阵亡将士纪念日周末宣布的协议，自由核心小组的成员感到被背叛了。北卡罗来纳州代表丹·毕晓普告诉记者，作为回应，他准备投票反对麦卡锡的议长职务。 “这对我来说是不可避免的，”他&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2023/05/30/dan-bishop-mccarthy-debt-limit-00099262&quot;>;说&lt;/a>; 。 “这必须完成。”然而，核心小组的其他成员还没有准备好。据报道，该协会主席、来自宾夕法尼亚州的斯科特·佩里(Scott Perry)在一次仅限会员参加的电话会议上表示：“让我们看看。现在还为时过早。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;来自德克萨斯州的奇普·罗伊 (Chip Roy) 是一位著名的自由核心小组成员，他对债务上限的提高感到失望，但当我们上个月交谈时，他仍然不愿意破坏与议长的关系。 “我们在阵亡将士纪念日遇到了分歧，”他告诉我。 “我们一直在努力与领导团队携手合作，以实现我们普遍同意的目标。”罗伊希望有一些具体的政策成果，尽管这些成果在参议院都没有获得通过。他公开支持关闭政府的想法来表达自己的观点。几天前，他呼吁大幅削减开支，并继续采取与“我们所见过的最强有力的边境安全措施”相关的解决方案。他告诉我，更广泛地说，他和他的同事正在努力实现“方向转变、轨迹转变”。在他看来，领导层第一次没有用自上而下的指令来管理会议。采取了一种新的开放措施，允许最保守的成员发表意见。 “这不是‘你没有遵守X，所以打倒你！’” ”罗伊说道。 “事实是，我们正在努力寻求的是改变。”他补充道，“我们基本上已经做到了这一点。”&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;关门政府的投票涉及明年的联邦预算，是春季冲突的延续。众议院共和党人没有政策或原则来证明他们在政府关门前夕采取的极端立场是合理的。这可能是他们自己内讧的结果。本周早些时候，当清楚表明该党顽固的成员已经不可动摇时，麦卡锡试图为他的会议即将要做的事情重新找一个借口。他将边境安全资金附加到众议院的一项持续决议中，以保持政府开放。在很大程度上，这个想法是试图吸引异常者支持该措施。 “如果他们想与总统站在一起，保持边境开放，我认为这是一个错误的立场，”他说。但这也是一种明显的策略，目的是让民主党人处于守势，让政府关门看起来与实际政策有关。该决议没有机会在参议院获得通过，而且很快它就变得毫无意义：麦卡锡自己的成员投票否决了它。 “按照我的定义，CR 是南希·佩洛西支出的延续，这是乔·拜登的政策，”蒙大拿州共和党人马特·罗森代尔 &lt;a href=&quot;https://thehill.com/homenews/house/4224910 -麦卡锡全力以赴与第二届政府的权宜之计资助尝试/&quot;>;说&lt;/a>;。 “我两年来一直投票反对这些事情。因此，我现在不会转身投票支持继续实施这些措施。”&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;周六上午，在另一项权宜之计的措施如预期失败后，共和党举行了会议开会表达他们的不满。政府原定于当天结束前关闭。上一次发生这种情况是在 2019 年，有 42 万名公职人员被迫无薪工作，另有 38 万人被迫休假。这一次，经济和社会后果将是巨大的。根据 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2023/09/29/politics/what-happens-government-shutdown-dg/index.html，每周可能会给国民经济造成约 60 亿美元的损失”一项预测&lt;/a>;，一万名低收入学生将失去参加启蒙计划的机会。 &lt;em>;SNAP&lt;/em>;福利或食品券的资金可能会枯竭。由于可能关闭的原因是自相残杀的政治冲突，而不是政策上的分歧，因此没有明显的妥协可以结束它。成员们预计这种情况将持续数周，甚至更长时间。&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;一群来自摇摆不定的选区的温和派人士表示，他们的观点是：长期关闭会破坏他们连任的前景。其中一人将党所走的道路与玻利维亚山上被称为“死亡之路”的自行车路线进行了比较。 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/01/politics/mccarthy-government-spending-fight/index.html&quot;>;据 CNN&lt;/a>; 报道，麦卡锡插话询问他的情况成员们，“我们想堵塞参议院吗？”除了最保守的成员之外，所有人都欢呼雀跃。麦卡锡指的是一项继续决议，让政府再开放一个半月。参议院已经提出了一项“干净的 CR”，以争取时间通过一项几乎没有任何附加条件的法案；麦卡锡现在想提供另一项不包括为乌克兰提供额外资金的方案。任何“干净”的法案都会受到自由核心小组的憎恶，因为这意味着在参议院或白宫没有做出任何重大让步的情况下保持政府开放。&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;

&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;会议结束后，新的法案是通过一个晦涩的程序提出的，需要三分之二的票数才能通过。民主党声称在麦卡锡提出该法案之前并未看到该法案的文本，并恳求给予更多时间。他们的休会动议被否决，因此民主党少数党领袖哈基姆·杰弗里斯发表了一段曲折的演讲，而他的政党成员则仔细研究了该法案。民主党加入后，该法案很容易就通过了，麦卡锡出去向媒体发表讲话。 “如果有人想提出反对我的动议，就提出来，”他说。 “房间里必须有一个成年人。我将以对这个国家最有利的方式来执政。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;这实际上是麦卡锡的一个大转变，还是一种自我保护的行为？具有讽刺意味的是，他周六的出人意料的举动是他一直以来唯一的表现。无论他做了什么，自由核心小组的某些成员都会试图驱逐他。马特·盖茨的一位密友告诉 Politico，“他想要凯文……” 。 。就是这样，其他一切都围绕这个展开。”盖茨反对议长的盟友包括罗森代尔和毕肖普等人，他们的算盘比盖茨更具意识形态性，但同样不屈服。然而，在周六之前，针对麦卡锡的竞选活动疏远了自由核心小组的其他成员，这表明共和党会议上出现了骚乱。 “并不是所有人都同意辞职动议，”一位共和党高级工作人员周五告诉我。 “这不是一个统一的 HFC 立场。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;麦卡锡肯定希望通过用尽所有其他选项来避免政府关门，从而赢得众议院保守派的善意。但现在他似乎确实失去了理论家的支持，这些理论家可能会觉得盖茨令人厌恶，但仍然准备关闭政府以推进他们的议程。周日，盖茨在美国有线电视新闻网（CNN）的“国情咨文”节目中宣布，他将在下周提出一项腾出主席职位的动议。 “麦卡锡议长一月份与众议院保守派达成了一项协议，从那时起他就一直公然地、一再严重违反该协议，”他说。 “他与民主党达成的这项协议真正打破了我们设立的许多支出护栏，这是最后一根稻草。”这种观点在自由核心小组中得到了广泛认同，但目前尚不清楚盖茨将拥有多少支持者。根据 Politico 的&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2023/10/01/mccarthy-speakership-mercy-democrats-00119359&quot;>;报告&lt;/a>;，可能有十几名共和党人愿意投票反对议长。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;2015 年 7 月，当时来自北卡罗来纳州的极右翼代表马克·梅多斯 (Mark Meadows) 走上众议院，提出了一项腾出议长席位的动议反对博纳的自由核心小组没有足够的票数来罢免他，其他人都知道这一点。来自宾夕法尼亚州的温和派共和党人查理·登特（Charlie Dent）站在会议厅前部附近，看着梅多斯发起了登特后来告诉我的“小型神风特攻队任务”。登特向博纳的幕僚提出对策建议。 “投票吧，”他说。 “趁这个叛乱的婴儿还在摇篮里，让我们扼杀它吧。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;最终，博纳对党内日益恶化的派系主义感到恼火，决定下台。但是，如果他想反击以重申自己的立场，他完全可以做到。麦卡锡可能根本没有足够的选票来生存。现在似乎有足够多的极右翼共和党人反对他，因为他需要民主党获得多数席位并保住议长职位。这是他在最后一刻决定避免政府关门的另一个潜在理由：在最后可能的时刻，他表明，在必要时，他可以放弃他棘手的超级党派之争。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;但这就足够了赢得持怀疑态度的民主党人的支持？这个问题在本周早些时候的一次民主党内部核心会议上提出。 “我以为会爆发骚乱，”一位出席的高级助手告诉我。 “我们的成员没有心情这样做。”当我问为什么时，助手提到了对弹劾调查的不满。第一次听证会于周四举行，当时正值政府似乎即将关闭之前的最后几个小时。共和党自己的证人不得不承认没有证据对总统不利。周日，随着政府关门不再临近，我和助手再次进行了交谈。他说，民主党处于“观望状态”。如果麦卡锡最终需要他们的选票，这位助手怀疑民主党是否会来拯救他。 “仅仅因为他通过保持政府开放做了正确的事情，就指望民主党会救助他，这有些牵强。这是国会最基本的职能之一。鉴于他一直是弹劾的大力支持者，这个价格不足以帮助保住他的工作。” ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;be1r3&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;

Patti Ann&#39;s&lt;/a>; 和 Prospect Heights 7 号餐厅，&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/03/30/the-oldest-restaurant-in-manhattans-chinatown-faces -the-coronavirus-shutdown&quot;>;唐人街的南华茶馆&lt;/a>;、村里的罗斯玛丽茶馆、大多数比萨饼店、大多数食客、繁华的意大利美国连锁店 Parm 的大部分地点。也许桌子之间有足够的空间来容纳折叠起来的婴儿车，或者特别愉快和悠闲的服务员。 （值得注意的是，&lt;em>;适合婴儿&lt;/em>;的餐厅与&lt;em>;适合儿童&lt;/em>;的餐厅完全不同。一旦孩子们有了语言和/或运动能力，整个餐厅外出就餐游戏规则发生了变化。）当我在 Gus&#39;s 网上预订了餐厅的周日烤肉餐时，菜单上有各种美味的大块肉和一系列配菜，包括约克郡布丁、沾有浓郁芥末油醋汁的蔬菜和一堆蔬菜。金色薯条——我在特殊要求字段中提到，我们一行的六名成员中有两名是婴儿，我会很喜欢高脚椅。 （这是与婴儿一起用餐时提供的有用信息；如果婴儿使用普通椅子或高椅子，则出于预订目的，她将被视为头部。如果她将坐在您的腿上，则她不会。）许多产前焦虑是担心自己会迷失在为人父母的迷雾中，这种恐惧具体化为一种特定的愿景：带我的孩子去餐馆，并被视为蔑视和愤怒的对象。格斯的不仅有高脚椅，而且是&lt;em>;漂亮&lt;/em>;的高脚椅——木质、简约、带有黑色口音——与房间的其他部分在美学上和谐相处。我发现椅子是一个奇怪的感人细节：餐厅期待婴儿；他们计划要生孩子。我们不是强加的；我们是强加的。我们很受欢迎。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;关于喂养婴儿的内容和方式，存在无数相互冲突的学派。我自己的哲学大致可以归结为：给孩子吃任何东西。我女儿快一岁了，她很喜欢帕尼斯和大头菜，这是一种优雅的开胃菜，由圆形的鹰嘴豆馅饼制成，快速油炸，外皮酥脆，配上一小堆腌好的大头菜和一大勺辣酱。我们第二次订购了，然后是第三次。 （另一个婴儿也非常喜欢它。）我们的服务员祝贺我女儿对烤羊肉的欣赏——味道非常美味，尽管有点生熟——当她看着她疯狂地吸食烤羊肉上的油醋汁时，她笑了。一片生菜，然后把它扔到地板上，并专注地示意另一片。在其他桌子上，其他婴儿表演着他们自己的欢乐和痛苦的哑剧，尖叫和牙牙学语，母乳喂养，奶瓶喂养，伸手去拿父母的牛排刀和鸡尾酒杯。有一次，餐厅的主厨兼合伙人克里斯·麦克达德 (Chris McDade) 出现并四处巡视。他的最后一站是我们旁边的桌子，那里有一个女人正在和一个小男孩一起吃饭——那是麦克达德的小儿子格斯，餐厅的同名者。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;在我短暂而丰富的餐厅经历中-作为父母，我了解到带上正确工具的好处：给宝宝准备防水餐垫、带小口袋的围兜，用来接掉掉落的食物、防溢吸管杯以避免水灾，以及常用的工具库。擦脸巾、婴儿用具、配方奶、一个瓶子和一个替换瓶子、花生酱泡芙、酸奶袋、纸板书、毛绒玩具、尿布和换洗衣服。但你也可以什么都不带，特别是如果你愿意只递给宝宝一大块面包，让她去城里，而你则在考虑喝马提尼酒。顺便说一下，Gus&#39;s 的这款酒是用两种杜松子酒和两种苦艾酒混合而成的，口感微妙而复杂，份量较小，装在冰霜亲吻的小轿车中。 （我没能尝到那块面包，但餐桌上的婴儿似乎很认可。）除了尽责的餐馆光顾的标准规则之外，婴儿时光没有任何规则：善待你的服务员，为你的行为道歉。乱七八糟，而且小费过分。 ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;

She had to stop after half a mile because she got too hungry. She then tried to run after dinner, only to feel the stew that she&#39;d eaten sloshing around in her stomach, so she stopped and worked on curating the perfect running playlist instead. “Listen to your body,” they say, but also, confusingly, “Just do it.” She made a date to run with a friend that weekend, but got tired of trying to pretend that she could keep up with her friend&#39;s pace and still appear to breathe effortlessly. Finally, she decided to just take a walk and listen to a podcast.&lt;/p>;&lt;hr />;&lt;p >;She believed she could manifest a gorgeous bruschetta recipe featured in the &lt;em>;Times&lt;/em>;. She didn&#39;t place her grocery-pickup order early enough, so she had to substitute every single ingredient, including the bread (for whole-wheat sandwich bread). She also had to leave out the salt, so the baby could eat it, too.&lt;/p>;&lt;hr />;&lt;p >;She believed she could apply her analytical mind to the most formidable challenges. She didn&#39;t particularly want to apply it to the 35,256 options for diaper cream, crib sheets, baby bottles, and car-seat-stroller combos. But somehow the attractively calming ads featuring words like “organic,” “breast-shaped,” and “enhanced safety profile” seeped into her brain. If she could keep obsessing over these details, then she would magically figure out the answers to more essential questions, like how to download her human instincts and rely on those instead of a computer, and how to find fulfillment when your house is a mess, there&#39;s no food in the fridge, and everyone in the room is crying.&lt;/p>;&lt;hr />;&lt;p >;She believed her stomach could be flat without sucking it in. She started deriving energy from lemon water and celery smoothies, for which she set alarms at 10 &lt;em >;AM&lt;/em>; and 4 &lt;em >;PM&lt;/em>;, and at all other times just drank water and black coffee. She realized that nobody cared about their midriff silhouettes on their deathbeds, but tell that to someone who&#39;s only consumed unsweetened clear liquid for eighteen hours and see what happens.&lt;/p>;&lt;hr />;&lt;p >;She believed she could sleep when she was dead, because think of all the things you could accomplish if you slept six hours every night instead of eight. You could watch two more episodes on HBO, text your friend about how tired you are, or post on social media about what you&#39;re doing instead of sleeping and then refresh every ninety seconds to see how many new likes you get. Finally, you could reach that dissociative state where you stop fearing death because at least then you will finally have permission to sleep.&lt;/p>;&lt;hr />;&lt;p >;She believed she could accomplish anything with sheer will power. For a couple of decades, she did. While there was always more to accomplish, her will power finally reached its rebellious phase and basically said, “No.” She tried to drink it back through expensive lattes. She tried to buy it back with power pumps that were supposed to be both chic and orthopedic. She tried to barter it back in her gratitude journal but couldn&#39;t ever get past the initial entry about her cat. After several years of frantic searching, cajoling, and bribing, she was, at long last, ready for a nap. ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;shww0o&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;wp6ln&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 01 Oct 2023 19:06:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Biden, Trump, and What’s at Stake in the U.A.W.

But last week President Joe Biden and his eternal partner in argument, Donald Trump, found themselves sharing the spotlight with a third party. Enter a fifty-four-year-old former electrician from Kokomo, Indiana, named Shawn Fain, who won the presidency of the United Auto Workers in March, on a reform ticket—“The machine will churn no more,” an account of Fain&#39;s victory in the left-wing magazine &lt;em>;Jacobin&lt;/em>; began—and by September had launched a strike against all three major US automakers. Fain, who quotes Malcolm X and whose membership is now one-fifth graduate-student workers, made clear that he would go big.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In negotiations, the UAW is demanding across-the-board raises of forty per cent—to match the steep trajectory of CEO compensation—and the institution of a four-day work week. The reporting from Detroit has suggested that, with this strike, Fain hopes to show workers around the country what unions can do for them. Both Biden and Trump pride themselves on having managed the populist politics that emerged from the decline of manufacturing in the Upper Midwest, and last week the two men were in Michigan, each trying, in his own way, to take advantage of something rare in US Presidential politics—a genuinely radical point of view.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Behind the familiar positioning and chaos of the 2024 Presidential race, the economy is beginning a slow but profound transition, from being based on oil and gas to relying on renewable energy. The Biden Administration&#39;s work to make this change happen, in the face of the climate crisis, is its most forward-thinking undertaking, and the Inflation Reduction Act, which worked to enroll automakers in the transition, has been its chief legislative accomplishment. The UAW strike is about tangible labor issues—pay and benefits. But it is also about the emerging electric-vehicle industry, which insiders have publicly suggested may need many fewer workers—Ford&#39;s CEO estimated perhaps forty per cent fewer—though some studies have found that the new plants won&#39;t be less labor intensive. EV production does depend on battery plants, and, according to CNN, there are currently six operating in the country, only one of which is unionized. (Workers at Tesla, suddenly an important competitor, are not unionized, either.) In May, Fain said that the UAW was withholding an endorsement of President Biden over the issue. In a memo, the union declared, “The EV transition is at serious risk of becoming a race to the bottom.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;From Mar-a-Lago, Trump, despite the preoccupations of facing ninety-one criminal charges, recognized that two things Biden wants—to achieve the green transition and to be the most “pro-worker” President in US history—were in tension, and ripe for some political entrepreneurship. So his campaign confirmed that he would skip the second Republican debate and, instead, address autoworkers in Michigan. Certain Republicans, sensing a shift—one poll suggested that forty-one per cent of Republican voters now view unions as a “positive force”—had already begun to speak more sympathetically about the plight of union labor. This has not translated into policy, though, and the UAW is skeptical of some of its new admirers. Senator Josh Hawley, of Missouri, who visited a UAW picket line in his home state, previously enjoyed a rating of zero per cent from the union. And, ahead of Trump&#39;s visit, Fain said, “Every fibre of our union is being poured into fighting the billionaire class and an economy that enriches people like Donald Trump at the expense of workers.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;That was enough to draw Biden to join the striking workers in Michigan last Tuesday. No sitting President had ever before stood on a picket line—not Obama, not Clinton, not FDR—which itself suggests just how rapidly the Washington consensus on labor is changing. (Steve Rattner, Obama&#39;s auto czar, denounced Biden&#39;s trip as “outrageous.”) Biden, wearing a union ball cap and carrying a bullhorn, stood with Fain at the picket line. He told the crowd that they had earned “a hell of a lot more” than their current pay, and backed the call for a forty-per-cent raise, which surely troubled even the pro-EV executives at Ford and GM, who have already committed to spending heavily on the electric transition, with no guarantee that the new cars will sell.&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Biden&#39;s appearance also served as a bit of general-election positioning; he looks vulnerable to attacks on the economy, where a generally strong rebound from the pandemic has been complicated by high consumer prices. A mid-September &lt;em>;USA Today&lt;/em>; poll found that, by a margin of eleven points, voters trust Trump over Biden to improve the economy, and an ABC poll, conducted a few days later, gave Biden his lowest ever scores on the economy. Biden means to run on the economy (“Bidenomics”), but he tends to frame it in confusing metaphors—he often talks about remaking the economy not just from the bottom up but from the “middle out”—that can obscure how much is changing.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Trump&#39;s pro-labor appearance, a day later, turned out to be an invitation-only event at a non-union truck-parts manufacturing plant in Macomb County, hosted by the company&#39;s president, which had the effect of bypassing its supposed audience—union workers. A UAW vice-president sent an e-mail to a reporter at the Detroit &lt;em>;Free Press&lt;/em>;, which delicately redacted it for publication: “Let me be blunt. Donald Trump is coming off as a pompous [expletive].” Nevertheless, Trump found a way to make his point. “You can be loyal to American labor, or you can be loyal to the environmental lunatics,” he said. “But you can&#39;t really be loyal to both. It&#39;s one or the other.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Of course, it really has to be both, even if Trump&#39;s party doesn&#39;t yet admit that. At the second Republican debate, on Wednesday night, candidates rushed to champion fossil-fuel extraction, with Mike Pence calling for the US to “unleash” its oil and gas resources. This is already happening, to some extent, since Biden, even as he calls climate change an “existential threat,” has helped foster a gas boom. Still, drive across the Midwest, and you can see the first landmarks of the new economy: huge battery plants going up in small-town Michigan, wind-turbine blades spinning along ridgelines in Iowa, solar arrays wedged into highway cloverleafs. And yet, as a political cause, this transformation remains curiously under-heralded, hidden beneath the banner of the Inflation Reduction Act and enacted through a dense set of tax credits. In Michigan, Biden sought to demonstrate that he is on the side of the workers, but the UAW has yet to endorse him. In the general election, he might need to convince its members, and the rest of the country, that the new economy can still come with a forty-per-cent raise. ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;x7ji4m&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;wqztxi&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 01 Oct 2023 19:06:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Why Lydia Davis Loves Misunderstandings]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-new-yorker-interview/why-lydia-davis-loves-misunderstandings]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-01T10:00:00.000Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6513462851fd0515dd042358/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Emre-Lydia-Davis-Interview.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;article >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attribute-verso-pattern=&quot;article-body&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;ArticlePageChunks&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;In 2019, the literary magazine &lt;em>;NOON&lt;/em>; published a story by Lydia Davis called “The Language of Armagnac,” a quietly comic meditation on the difficulties of translating “the patois of the city of Auch, which is a local form of the language of Gascon, which is in turn a dialect language of Occitan.” A second version of the story much like the first was included in Davis&#39;s “Essays Two,” a collection of her writings on translation, a career that parallels her work as a writer of fiction. A third and notably different version appears in her story collection “Our Strangers,” under the title “Bothered Scholar on Train.” It refashions Davis&#39;s elaborate philological commentaries as the tirade of a scholar whose attempt to read in the language of Armagnac is disrupted by noisy passengers. Davis designed the story to open with an exclamation—“Oh, can&#39;t you quiet down, please!”—and end with an exclamation mark, too (“So, please!”). This symmetry would clue readers in to an irony underlying the scene. The bothered shouts at others to be quiet. He—or she—annoys strangers while insisting that they are the annoying ones.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;As always in Davis&#39;s fiction, an almost imperceptible line divides pedantry from precision, enthusiasm from solipsism. When I met Davis at her house in East Nassau, New York, this August, she eyed the galley of “Our Strangers” that I had brought with me and noticed that, in it, the final exclamation mark was missing from “Bothered Scholar on Train.” “You&#39;ve got to have the exclamation mark there,” she said. When we looked at a finished copy of the UK edition that she&#39;d been sent, we discovered that someone had blundered: the exclamation mark was still missing. “Well, that&#39;s too bad,” she said. “That was important.” Then, while trying to find another story, we discovered that almost all of the table of contents had been misnumbered. “There&#39;s so much trouble that goes into trying to get something right, and then they do something really basic wrong,” Davis said. She sat on the couch with Jack, her cat, curled at her side, and started to correct the errors with a pencil. “It&#39;s terrible,” she said. “But it&#39;s good we&#39;re doing this, because I might not have done this on my own.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Since the mid-nineteen-seventies, Davis&#39;s fiction has often taken as its subject matter the mistakes that creep into writing, or the misunderstandings that arise from speech and silence. The stories in “The Collected Stories of Lydia Davis” and “Can&#39;t and Won&#39;t” reward what I think of as too-close reading: an attentiveness to the marvel of the individual letter, the punctuation mark, and the italicized word, perfectly and savagely deployed. In “Mother&#39;s Reaction to My Travel Plans,” we hear, “Gainesville! It&#39;s too bad your &lt;em>;cousin&lt;/em>; is dead!” The shortest stories are often composed of a single sentence or a snatch of dialogue, as in “Overheard on the Train: Two Old Ladies Agree”:&lt;/p>;&lt;blockquote >;&lt;div >;&lt;p>;“Everything gets worse.”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/blockquote>;&lt;blockquote >;&lt;div >;&lt;p>;“Does anything get better?”&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/blockquote>;&lt;p >;The painstaking attention to how the smallest units of language can be used or misused scales up to momentous questions about errors or missteps in human relations. Davis&#39;s novel, “The End of the Story,” whose protagonist negotiates an agonized love affair and separation, rivals Marcel Proust&#39;s “Swann in Love” in its intimate yet analytic representation of the whirl of consciousness. One can see her great economy of style at work in her translations—of works by Proust, Michel Leiris, Maurice Blanchot, Peter Bichsel, and AL Snijders, and, most notably, of Gustave Flaubert. Her translation of “Madame Bovary” is the best English version by far, because its deadpan reminds us that the book is both a great realist novel and a satire of realism.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;On and off the page, Davis is reserved, droll, precise, and principled. She does not fly, eat meat, kill insects, or buy anything on Amazon; “Our Strangers” will be available for purchase only at independent bookstores or through Bookshop.org. She and her husband, the painter Alan Cote, live in a converted schoolhouse with their three cats. They—Davis and Cote, not the cats—are generous hosts. After speaking for several hours, Davis asked for half an hour of complete silence (she prepared lunch, I got on with some work), and then we ate: cucumber-mint soup, a vegetable quiche, chocolate-chip cookies on “teeny-tiny plates,” Davis and Cotes joked, and, from their garden, white peaches and strawberries in cream in teeny-tiny bowls. Cote told me that he was rereading “Ulysses,” while Davis and her book club were reading Matthew Desmond&#39;s “Poverty, by America.” She was hoping to persuade the club to read another hundred pages of “Don Quixote.” “There are still plenty of people who want to settle down with a big, fat, long novel,” she said. “But I hate to think that it&#39;s the only thing people should read.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Our conversation has been edited for length and clarity.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;What attracts you to scenarios in which speech causes confusion?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I&#39;m thinking of the story “Caramel Drizzle,” in which an airline flight attendant is stuck ordering her coffee because she doesn&#39;t know what the difference is between a caramel drizzle or a caramel syrup. She has to think about what the words mean. That thinking is what captures my attention. But it always emerges from a combination of language and character. I don&#39;t know if I would have been drawn to that scene the same way if the main character, the flight attendant, was someone else, someone different. But I liked her confusion and her alertness, and she seemed like a nice person. It feels natural to be drawn to a scenario like that because of my interest in language and then my interest in human relations. Where they intersect are these moments of dialogue and misunderstood dialogue.&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;It&#39;s a misunderstanding that is easier to see in certain characters. I&#39;m thinking of your story “Egg.” It begins with a paragraph on cognates for “egg” in several languages, and then shows us two little boys trying to say the word “egg” to describe a round, white object. It turns out to be a Ping-Pong ball.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;You would relate to that because you have two boys.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;I do, and I do relate to it. For those children, and for my children, too, there&#39;s often a mismatch between a word and an object. There&#39;s comedy in that mismatch, but there&#39;s also pathos, especially when the characters are little.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I&#39;m drawn to humor, but also how language, humor, and character create moving situations. And what is touching about “Egg” is that the boys are so earnest. Kids are very earnest. They&#39;re so earnest in their little tiny way because they couldn&#39;t have been very old. And yet they&#39;re working so hard at identifying an object, which isn&#39;t even an egg. And, at that age, they&#39;re playing parallel to each other, not together, but they&#39;re still influenced by each other.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The kernel of the story is obviously the kids and trying to identify that object. But then I added the first paragraph because they have their own way of saying the word. But then we have all these other languages that also have different ways of saying the word. And it&#39;s similar to the boys. The boys get very close. Their words for “egg” or “Ping-Pong ball” are very close. And we have neighboring languages that are very close, but then the comedy for me comes in, you know, with the Scots Gaelic word for “egg” is just “&lt;em>;ugh&lt;/em>;.” And the French is funny too, “&lt;em>;oeuf&lt;/em>;.” They suddenly have nothing to do with the thing itself.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;The Turkish for “egg” is “&lt;em>;yumurta&lt;/em>;.”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;It&#39;s a much more complicated word.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;It&#39;s entirely too irritating to say when all you want is a boiled egg for your breakfast.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Another reason I was drawn to that story is that an egg is so primordial. It&#39;s absolutely essential and basic.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;Those boys were eggs not too long ago.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;That&#39;s right. They were eggs until they got inspired.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;In other words, the yolk of that story was the boys and then you added the first paragraph to it?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Yes.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;Did you not feel like the second paragraph could have stood on its own?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;It could have. But sometimes I like to be mock scholarly, so I thought, Let&#39;s have a little preface to this story. I liked the balance—the dry information, very straightforward and plain, and then moving to the scene in the living room with the boys. I like making fun of stuffy academics.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;“Bothered Scholar on Train” gives us a stuffy academic who is offensive less for their stuffiness or pedantry than for the desire to impose themselves on everyone around him. Why are people comfortable with being so talkative and self-revealing?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;wnod58&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;f4o9k&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;There are several ways to answer that. One thing I think a lot about is Europe versus America. That may be changing in Europe, but there&#39;s sort of a code there, or there was, especially on trains. You would be quiet. You would keep your voice down. You would be quiet. And in restaurants, too. I was thinking about it in a restaurant the other night because people are extremely loud in restaurants. And it&#39;s not just New York City but even up here. And, in Europe, it used to be anyway that you kept your voice down because you were in a room full of people who all wanted to enjoy their dinner.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;It leads me to think about something that I&#39;m always amazed by: that some people I know are very aware of their own behavior, and then there are other people who just don&#39;t seem to be able to see themselves from the outside. They are not able to stand back and look at themselves, especially once they start talking. One friend and I have a running conversation about the people we know who will talk on and on almost neurotically—you know, the people you know, that you are friends with, who have no sense that they are dominating the conversation from start to finish and make it very hard for anyone else to comment. And they have strategies for it. They&#39;ll say “Ah.” They&#39;ll stop in mid-sentence so you don&#39;t dare intervene, or they&#39;ll fill up the silence with “Ah . 。 。 um.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;Situations in which people cannot see themselves from the outside while they&#39;re talking to others often become quite generative for you. The most striking story in “Our Strangers” is “Addie and the Chili,” in which the narrator goes to a restaurant with her friends Ellie and Addie, orders chili, and confronts Addie about her tendency to make herself the center of attention.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Yes, she is a good example of someone who&#39;s not aware of her whole situation, not aware of how she&#39;s fitting into it or not fitting into it.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;But it&#39;s also a case where the narrator intervenes.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Which is unusual. But, if you think of the opposite, if she hadn&#39;t said anything, that&#39;s very uncomfortable, too. Either way, if she said something to Addie or didn&#39;t say something to her, it would have been equally frustrating.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;The stories are not all necessarily close to reality and close to my life. But that one is. The character I&#39;m calling Ellie is the person I just mentioned, with whom I was having this ongoing conversation about people who talk so much. She was the one who went to this experience. And, soon after, she must have said, “You should write a story about it.” But, as I say in this story, she had no memory of that or really of the occasion. I enjoy this story because of the way it traces the shifting moods. Now the narrator is angry. Now she&#39;s not angry anymore. And the waiter is sort of the straight man among the ladies. And this weird thing, which I don&#39;t think would happen in New York City anymore: she takes the bowl of chili home with her. That would not really happen anymore.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;In “Our Strangers,” as well as in “Can&#39;t and Won&#39;t” and “The Collected Stories,” it is often women who are speaking to one another. Is there a way you think that women speak to one another that is different, or particularly amenable to scenarios like the one where Addie&#39;s friends take her to task?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I don&#39;t know about that. I&#39;m thinking of an earlier story, “Glenn Gould,” about friends watching “The Mary Tyler Moore Show,” in which the friend is Mitch. Even though the narrator is a married woman with a family and husband, it&#39;s her friend Mitch that she&#39;s relating to in somewhat the same way as the narrator is relating to Ellie here. I say “she” because it isn&#39;t me. When I write, the character becomes objectified. But I think there are male-female friendships that are comfortable in the same way and familiar in the same way. I&#39;d have to really look through and think, What&#39;s the role of men versus women here? I don&#39;t usually think that way. You&#39;re probably much too sophisticated to imagine that I&#39;ve set out to make a point. Because I don&#39;t set out to make a point. I don&#39;t set out to write about women in a certain way, or even to write about women, period.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;I am thinking about your story “Suddenly Afraid”: “because she couldn&#39;t write the name of what she was: a wa wam owm owamn womn.” I can&#39;t quite pronounce the semantically incoherent permutations. 。 。 .&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The permutations of the word “woman.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;It&#39;s difficult to read a story like that and not think you set out to write about gender.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I didn&#39;t mean to insult you. I was actually showing respect for you. Because I have been asked that so much: What was your intention? What were you setting out to do with the story? And I never set out beforehand to do something. That one just came out of the actual fact that I was trying to write the word “woman,” and I couldn&#39;t. I got it all mixed up. And I was probably typing, but I get things mixed up when I write by hand, too. That&#39;s all it was—capturing that moment. Of course, I saw the implications.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;92e8bg&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;For me, the difficulty that the story addresses isn&#39;t only about gender. It&#39;s about the difficulty of speech. When I teach it, and I ask students to read it aloud, they don&#39;t know what to do with it. It seems like the kind of utterance that can only exist in writing.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Although I have read it out loud.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;How do you read it?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I&#39;d have to have it in front of me, but I just pronounce it phonetically: whoa-hum-mana.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;Now your mouth looks like it&#39;s trying to say “egg” in Turkish.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;What is it again?&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;“&lt;em>;Yumurta&lt;/em>;.”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;It might be good to make students pronounce it. I don&#39;t know if kids are taught phonics anymore. It makes them read phonetically, and it makes them make weird sounds and be OK with it or do it anyway. I think that&#39;s a good thing.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;Going back to what you said about people who can&#39;t see themselves from the outside: as I was reading your story about singing lessons, “Learning to Sing,” I realized that singing was the experience that made it most evident to me that what I think I sound like is not, in fact, what I sound like. Singing is a deeply self-estranging experience for me. I wonder if it is for you as well.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;I was starting from rock bottom. As I write in the story, I had always sung some, and fairly musically in tune, but the quality of my voice was not great. What I wanted from the lessons was to be able to sing more musically. I never got very far. As the story shows, it&#39;s not just the quality of your voice but of your whole being. If you&#39;re very reserved most of the time, it&#39;s hard to produce a nice sound.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;You write that singing makes you imagine that you could be bigger than you are. A bigger woman.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;And to sing more like a woman.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;Did singing make you want to be bigger?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Oh, sure. Generally, I don&#39;t feel like I have to be bigger. But for that purpose it would be fun to inhabit that large, operatic persona. Oh, just less reserved or withheld and more generous. But I don&#39;t think I&#39;d want to live that way all the time.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Despite my voice not being great, I love singing with people. There&#39;s a group that sings shape singing, which is an early American form of singing. People who didn&#39;t read music could tell what the notes were by the shape and the notes. But they still print the shape-singing books, with music, too. On a historical day, at a historical site near here, they had a shape-singing activity. I did that on that day. And they said, “Oh, you should join our shape-singing group.” I was very happy. It made me think, OK, I could be a screechy old woman and be in a group and be screeching and not singing in tune and my voice may be awful but I don&#39;t care.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;It occurred to me as we were eating that I had forgotten to tell you that “The End of the Story” is one of my favorite novels. I&#39;ve never read anything that captures the torque of consciousness as it does, from the beginning to the end of an agonized love affair. I wonder how you managed to achieve this, because it&#39;s the kind of experience that seems impossible to get a grip on when you&#39;re in it, and impossible to remember once you&#39;re out of it.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I&#39;m really glad you like it, because it is not mentioned often just because it doesn&#39;t fit in. It&#39;s not a story. It&#39;s a novel. “She&#39;s not a novelist,” people said. But I worked very hard on it. And I thought it was really good.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;I&#39;m surprised that it doesn&#39;t get mentioned more, because it&#39;s truly excellent. I give it to many heartbroken friends as a gift.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;You can imagine that it was based on an experience. And it started, really, as scenes. I will write something, whether it&#39;s very small or that novel, if the material just interests me so much. All the observations in the novel, all the perceptions she has about this or that or all the strange things that go into it, it just interested me so much. I have to write about it.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;But it started out as two different novels. I don&#39;t know if I&#39;ve talked about this anywhere before. I thought, I&#39;ll write a story of this love affair. But then I was kind of bored by it as just a straight story of the love affair and the breakup. It just did not captivate me. At the same time, I started writing what I called Novel No. 2, which was about the process of writing Novel No. 1. And I kept Novel No. 2 a secret. My publisher was waiting for Novel No. 1. But I was at the same time writing Novel No. 2, and they didn&#39;t know about that.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;And then Alan, who doesn&#39;t usually play a crucial part in my work, strangely enough said, “If you&#39;re kind of bored with that one, why don&#39;t you write a second one that you don&#39;t tell anyone about?” He guessed what I was already doing. He didn&#39;t suggest it. I was already doing it. That was odd. And, at some point, I realized, Oh, I can merge them, and then I&#39;ll be perfectly happy with Novel No. 1 because it serves the purposes of Novel No. 2.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;syi321q&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;eqw1h&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;A friend was disappointed that there wasn&#39;t any sex in it. I just never wanted to have sex in it because it&#39;s almost demanded: writing about this passionate love affair, you have to have the crucial central scene with very good sex. But I just never wanted to because it seemed so rote and so required and so uninteresting. So I had a sort of negative sex scene with a later lover who doesn&#39;t do this and doesn&#39;t do that, to imply all that went on in the other one. It amused me to do it that way, but my friend—well, he should have been more sophisticated and not disappointed in my sex scene.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;I can remember the mood of the entire novel. But the detail I can visualize most clearly comes at the end, when the narrator feels the love affair is maybe finally over and is given a cup of tea by a stranger in a bookstore.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I wonder why.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;I was hoping you could tell me.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;I really didn&#39;t know how to end the novel, until I thought of this grim, sad tea ceremony. The narrator is tired. She&#39;s sitting in a bookstore for a tea ceremony, and although the tea is comforting, it isn&#39;t very good. It&#39;s strong, Lipton tea. But the gesture is comforting. So that can become the end. But it was very hard, especially since I had never written a novel. So how do you end it? And then what are the very last words of the ending? I labored over it.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;Perhaps I remember it because it is the gesture of a stranger who can choose to be kind to her or not. So much depends on that choice.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Yes, and he comes in from outside the story. He doesn&#39;t know the story. He doesn&#39;t know her. He just intervenes.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;It makes me think of the story “Judgment.” Maybe because his decision to give her the tea is a very small act of judgment.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;You mean my story about the ladybug? I thought maybe you meant Kafka&#39;s story about judgment.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;I suppose I could have meant Kafka&#39;s story. But I meant yours. “Into how small a space the word judgment . 。 .”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;—“can be compressed: it must fit inside the brain of a ladybug as she, before my eyes, makes a decision.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;And the judgments that ladybugs or strangers make can be small, but they can also be momentous.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;I was thinking of that story again, because just now there was an ant on the sink, deciding to go this way or that way. They do have to make a decision, however they do it.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;Do you think they do it differently from the way we do it?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;They&#39;re certainly not thinking in words. They&#39;re reacting. We do some of the same instinctive things, like choosing a chair in the living room. You don&#39;t think in words, but you go for the chair that feels comfortable for you. I&#39;m sorry to deprive you of what is obviously the best chair. We make instinctive decisions, which they must make.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I meant to tell you that there were a lot of daddy longlegs in the bathroom, in case you were bothered by that.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;I wouldn&#39;t have been, but I didn&#39;t see any daddy longlegs in the bathroom.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;They&#39;re pretty small. But that&#39;s another one of my principles. I don&#39;t dust away cobwebs. I just let the bugs live. Like, the spiders can live here and the ants can live here and the ladybugs upstairs could live there.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;Bugs, like strangers, can be small and large, important and not so important. You put strangers front and center in this new collection. Why?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I noticed after I chose the title that the word “strangers” recurs in other stories. But those particular strangers are neighbors. We&#39;re thrown into relationships with these people we don&#39;t know just because we live close to them.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;I think that “Our Strangers,” it may have been born from a story that impressed me very much, a true story, a news story. It was years and years ago. Three brothers living on the edge of a town together in a house, and they were kind of a little crazy or mentally not all there. And they were slovenly, and they were this and they were that. They were very much rejected by the townspeople. But then somehow—I don&#39;t know the story exactly—the authorities came down to move them, to force them out in some way. And the people of the town rallied behind them. There was the sense that, yes, they&#39;re outcasts, but they&#39;re &lt;em>;our&lt;/em>; outcasts. I thought this was the craziest paradox. They&#39;re strangers to us. But they&#39;re &lt;em>;our&lt;/em>; strangers.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;There&#39;s a phrase that I like from linguistic anthropology, “entextualization”: the process by which speech is extracted from its original context and turned into a text that others can read. I wonder if your genre of overheard conversations entextualizes the speech of strangers to make them &lt;em>;your&lt;/em>; strangers, or, for you and your reader, &lt;em>;our&lt;/em>; strangers.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I know that this has happened to me a few times, like with those two old ladies on the train. That wasn&#39;t the only thing I heard them saying. They were probably waiting, standing up in the aisle waiting to get off. They were talking to each other. But I really liked them. And I thought, Boy, I would really like to spend time with these women and get to know them. I would just love to get off the train and sit with them. That&#39;s not true of other scenarios. But I see what you mean. It&#39;s not that I want to make them my friends exactly but just possess them for a while.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;ydlatf&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;That&#39;s what&#39;s charming about it. It&#39;s dubious and off-putting to want to possess people for a long time, but it is all right to want to possess them for a very little bit.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Yes, people react to that. I&#39;m careful to ask friends, like the other Davis in the village. Because I didn&#39;t have to use our names. I could have said the two Harrises. But I wanted to use Davis. He didn&#39;t mind. He was fine with it. But people are very sensitive about being appropriated that way and being used, even if you do it in the friendliest way or the most positive or complimentary way. Because you are taking them and using them. That&#39;s tricky.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;When did you make the decision not to sell “Our Strangers” on Amazon?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I&#39;ve boycotted Amazon for many years. I shouldn&#39;t say “boycott” because it&#39;s not very effective when one person does it. But I have not bought anything from them. But what triggered it? I think it may have been Dave Eggers&#39;s decision to publish his last book—it&#39;s probably not the last one by now—by not selling through Amazon for the first six weeks. It was limited, but it was only available from bookstores. It was right around the time that the second book of my essays came out, and I regretted that Amazon would be selling that book. I thought, Oh, well, why don&#39;t I just not have Amazon sell it, period. And I vowed this out loud at a dinner table. And then I thought, Oh, well, now that I&#39;ve vowed this out loud at a dinner table, I will not go back on this decision.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;Was there an exclamation mark at the end of the vow?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Yes, there definitely was, and there was a very angry face. And then I heard various arguments like, well, if Amazon sells, it&#39;s widely available to people who don&#39;t have as much money. But the trouble is, you&#39;re still going along with a system that&#39;s very oppressive. They&#39;re selling it at a low price at the expense of the workers. There was an earlier version of a book called “How to Resist Amazon and Why,” and I read that, which gave me more reasons and more information. But you know how bad they are. And it goes beyond the business practices. And it goes beyond the bad working conditions, to the very idea of community. I think they&#39;re community wreckers, and I think now more than ever we need community. In every way, I wouldn&#39;t want to support them.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;Would you want other writers to do the same? How should we reseed the community they&#39;ve wrecked?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;It should be government-led, and I don&#39;t know if that ever will be because of the way our government functions, especially now. In France—and we found this out when selling foreign rights to the book—if you say, “We want to avoid Amazon,” the publishers say, “Oh, that&#39;s no problem. The government already doesn&#39;t allow Amazon to undersell and underprice.” It&#39;s &lt;em>;our&lt;/em>; government that allows this monopolistic situation.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;As for other writers, everyone&#39;s at different points in their careers. There might be a young writer who is so eager to reach an audience that she or he doesn&#39;t want to bypass Amazon. I&#39;m not blaming anyone. I understand people&#39;s different reasons. I have friends who buy books through Amazon, and they know that I don&#39;t approve, but they want the book fast. And I disagree with that whole idea, too. Getting things fast and conveniently is a value that I don&#39;t subscribe to. Occasionally, in an emergency or some vital situation, you need something the next day or the same day—OK But a book you want to read, you don&#39;t have to get it the same day or the next day.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I&#39;m slightly afraid that if there were suddenly a growing movement, and no authors or most authors would not want their books to be sold by Amazon—which is hard to believe—that Amazon would retaliate in some awful way. They&#39;re very retaliatory. I didn&#39;t do it to set an example or to lead the way or anything like that. I did it because I was just unwilling to let a company like that sell something that mattered to me.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;What you said earlier about a young writer who has a desire to reach a larger audience made me wonder if reaching an audience was ever something that felt important to you.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Even as a young writer, I never said, “I want to reach a large audience. I want to be famous.” It was more like “I want to do something as good as Beckett.” I would have high ambition, but it was not for fame and glory. I don&#39;t think you can chase after that. My ambition was to do something really good, like my heroes. Right now, I would like to have readers because I enjoy that kind of communion. People warned me, they said, “You might only have fifty per cent of the readers you would have, if you pull the book from Amazon.” I&#39;m willing to do that based on principle. If you steal from someone, maybe you get a lot of whatever you stole, but the principle is wrong.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;Speaking of principles of judgment, do you prefer the early Beckett to the late Beckett?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;I like both. I don&#39;t know how I would have reacted if there had been only late Beckett available. I think I would have been intrigued by it, because it&#39;s very intriguing. I think “Ill Seen Ill Said” is in one of my stories, the one about taking the bus down to the airport or something.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;qj9g6f&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;mwhkkp&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;“Southward Bound, Reads &lt;em>;Worstward Ho&lt;/em>;.”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Yes, I like having a very thorny text to just mull over like that. But I think the later texts can be too withholding and narrow, if fascinating and wonderful. I wouldn&#39;t emulate them.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;What do you mean by “narrow”?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;They&#39;re so stingy. “Ill Seen Ill Said”—this is not writing for the people. How many people could read this? There&#39;s a part of me that doesn&#39;t want to write things that no one can read or that only a small sector of people can enjoy. You and others can enjoy the particularity of the title “Southward Bound, Reads &lt;em>;Worstward Ho&lt;/em>;” because it&#39;s Beckettian already. It&#39;s just using a few words to construct a title. A very different title stylistically but that gives you a similar feeling is “On Their Way South on Sunday Morning (They Thought).” The language and the syntax for the title is very different, much looser and more open and easier: “On Their Way South on Sunday Morning (They Thought).” Whereas “Southward Bound, Reads &lt;em>;Worstward Ho&lt;/em>;” is thornier.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;Another one of my favorite stories of yours is “Kafka Cooks Dinner.” I read it at the same time that I read his letters to Milena Jesenská, which are passionate and beautiful and tortured, as well as quite tedious and irritating in their absolute neuroticism. But it&#39;s wonderful to imagine that neuroticism attending Kafka&#39;s preparation of “Kartoffel Surprise” for the woman he is obsessed with. Did writing it make you think differently about Kafka?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I used to read his diaries very closely and very often when I was younger. I think I felt very close to him. He was never proud or arrogant. I&#39;m sure he had many facets to him, but I found him a very sympathetic, lovable person. I felt very comfortable appropriating him for this dinner situation.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The story started as just a neat idea, because I was having trouble thinking what to make for dinner. And I thought how much more trouble he would have had because he was such a hesitater. It was going to be just a page or so, but then I decided to incorporate his language into it. It grew and grew because I went to his letters, too. And I wanted to incorporate all the wonderful things he says in them, like “Someone once said I swim like a swan, but it was not a compliment.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;This closeness can happen with translation, too. I felt very close to Proust. And even rather closer to Flaubert. Flaubert is not a very lovable person. Proust is, I think, even though he&#39;s weird. He may have his perversions, but I felt that he was very lovable.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;What about Michel Leiris?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;He&#39;s different. I did meet him once in person. He was very standoffish. No, he wasn&#39;t exactly lovable. But I would definitely feel in very close sympathy with anyone that I was translating that I respected and liked.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;You have translated the essays and fiction of Maurice Blanchot and Leiris&#39;s “The Rules of the Game,” which are marvellous on early language acquisition. Does the way we use language change at the extremes of life?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;At the early extreme, it&#39;s very dramatic and very interesting. I remember, when we took a trip to Florida, I said, “We&#39;re going to Miami,” and one of my sons—I think he was about seven or eight—didn&#39;t know Miami was a city and said, “When are we getting to your ami?” On the same trip, I talked about the co-pilot, and my son thought that was a pilot of a co. In the beginning, they&#39;re trying hard, but they might get it wrong.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In the end—it&#39;s a cliché, but I think it&#39;s true—old people are more outspoken. They&#39;re quicker to just say what they think. And then, all the way through life, there&#39;s the factor of misunderstanding: one person says this, but someone else misunderstood and thought it meant that. I know that, at the end of life, that can get very interesting, especially the last words on the deathbed. The last word could be something you can&#39;t quite make out. Or that you misunderstand. And, at the end of life, that misunderstanding can be crucial in a way that it isn&#39;t in the middle of life.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;strong>;My grandmother&#39;s last words were instructions to my grandfather about which woman he should marry next. My grandfather listened to her, but he and his second wife never got along, divorced quickly, and she stole all his good silver. I thought it was extraordinary of my grandmother to use her last words to misunderstand what would make him happy.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I thought that you were going to say that he misheard her. He heard “Please be with Anya,” but what she really said was “Please be with Anna. She would have been wonderful.” ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;4owrio&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot;

>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Americans may not know much about the South Korean President, Yoon Suk-yeol, but some will have noticed that he&#39;s not a bad singer. In April, when Joe and Jill Biden hosted Yoon and his wife, Kim Keon-hee, for a state dinner in Washington, DC, Yoon ingratiated himself, East Asian-style, by performing a nostalgic ballad. During a round of musical performances, he brought a microphone to his lips, at Biden&#39;s invitation, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.c-span.org/video/?527721-1/south-korean-president-yoon-sings-american-pie&quot;>;launched&lt;/a>; into an a-cappella version of one of his favorite tunes, “American Pie,” by Don McLean: “A long, long time ago, I can still remember / How that music used to make me smile.” Biden beamed and pumped his fists. Yoon looked the part of jovial statesman and ultimate US ally.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;South Korea is widely seen as an American-made democracy that, along with Japan, supports US efforts to counter China in East Asia—and around the world. This trilateral unity was exhibited publicly, in August, when Biden met with Yoon and Fumio Kishida, the Prime Minister of Japan, at Camp David. But, since taking office last year, after being elected by a margin of less than one per cent, Yoon, a career prosecutor with no previous experience in politics, has started to scrape away protections for women, the right to associate and organize, and, most strikingly, freedom of the press.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The trouble started about a year ago, just a few months into Yoon&#39;s term, when he was caught swearing into a hot mike in New York, on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly. “Biden will be fucking humiliated if those pricks in Congress don&#39;t pass this,” he said, in Korean, apparently referring to legislation that would fund a global health program. (Yoon&#39;s detractors had already nicknamed him Gaffe a Day.) The South Korean TV broadcaster MBC was the first to report the incident. Yoon&#39;s spokesperson went into denial mode, stating that the President had used a word that loosely rhymes with “Biden” (&lt;em>;nallimyeon&lt;/em>;, meaning to cast out) and that the comment was directed at the Korean legislature, not the US Congress. An ally of Yoon&#39;s filed a criminal-defamation complaint against MBC and affiliated journalists. (MBC said it was a “retaliatory investigation.”) Two months later, Yoon banned MBC from joining the media pool on his flights to meetings of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and the G-20.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Yoon has since intensified his attacks on the press. In May, police raided the home of Im Hyeon-ju, the MBC journalist who reported the hot-mike comment. (Her alleged offense, this time, was forwarding personal information about South Korea&#39;s justice minister to another journalist.) Earlier this month, prosecutors searched and confiscated materials from the offices of the investigative outlet Newstapa and the TV network JTBC, and from the homes of several journalists. The stated reason was again criminal defamation of Yoon. In early 2022, Newstapa had reported on the existence of a recorded interview in which a source alleges that Yoon, then a high-ranking prosecutor, covered up a banking and real-estate scheme. Yoon called this interview fake news—claiming the tape may have been manipulated—and accused Newstapa and JTBC of circulating it just before the Presidential election to undermine his campaign. The Journalists Association of Korea and other media groups compared the recent raids to a “military operation” and condemned the ruling party&#39;s disregard for “the rule of law.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;The Yoon administration doesn&#39;t always approach the media with such hostility. South Korea&#39;s newspapers and television channels are expressly political, and Yoon has shown favor to outlets aligned with his conservative People Power Party. In one instance, his government oversaw the indictment and firing of Han Sang-hyuk, a broadcast regulator who had scrutinized the license of TV Chosun, a network whose reports tend toward right-wing propaganda. (Han has denied the charges.) The man who replaced Han is now promising to scrub the Korean Internet of everything he deems “fake news.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Yoon has also engaged in petty forms of reputation management. Last year, his culture ministry denounced a local cartoon contest for awarding a prize to a teen-ager who had drawn Yoon as a train steered by his wife, a businesswoman and socialite. (During the Presidential campaign, she vowed to have any reporter who spoke poorly of her husband put in jail; her mother is currently in prison for forging a financial document in a real-estate deal.) The government celebrated the recent opening of a “children&#39;s garden”—at the defense-ministry compound, in central Seoul, where Yoon relocated the President&#39;s office—by distributing coloring sheets that depicted Yoon and his wife being fawned over by various segments of the population, including puppies.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;For many, Yoon&#39;s self-absorption and eagerness to target the media are reminiscent of the country&#39;s mid-century military dictatorship, which lasted until the nineteen-eighties. Local and national prosecutors went after reporters, publishers, student activists, labor organizers, and ordinary people as part of a vast anti-Communist dragnet. Many of those prosecutors facilitated arrests and torture by the police, the scope of which is still being catalogued. Prosecutors working for Yoon&#39;s government have used their investigatory powers to intimidate and threaten to arrest politicians in the liberal opposition party, including Lee Jae-myung, who ran against Yoon last year. Lee came under investigation for bribery and corruption shortly after the election; he has denied all charges and staged a twenty-four-day hunger strike, calling the new government a “dictatorship by prosecutors.” Recently, the South Korean legislature voted to override Lee&#39;s sovereign immunity, allowing for his arrest. (A court later rejected the warrant.) Yoon&#39;s prosecutors have also gone after the leaders of progressive trade unions. Early this year, police raided dozens of union offices and private homes, accusing labor officials of violating South Korea&#39;s National Security Act and coercing construction firms to use union workers.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;When Yoon became President, many South Koreans who had participated in the &lt;em>;minjung&lt;/em>;, or “people&#39;s,” democracy movement of the nineteen-seventies and eighties could not believe that the nation was willing to elect a prosecutor. Early in his career, Yoon had worked on important corruption cases in the southern city of Daegu; later, he rose through the prestigious Seoul prosecutors&#39; office and, in 2019, the liberal President Moon Jae-in made him the country&#39;s prosecutor general. Yoon soon began to pursue cases that benefitted the People Power Party. He cast himself as Moon&#39;s chief antagonist and seized on an opening in the 2022 Presidential race. (South Korean Presidents are limited to a single five-year term.) During the campaign, Yoon capitalized on a backlash against women, blaming feminism for the nation&#39;s frustrations with rising housing costs and dwindling upward mobility. He promised to eliminate the Ministry of Gender Equality and Family (a move that is now pending) and did away with a gender quota established by Moon that called for thirty per cent of the President&#39;s cabinet to be women. In addition to Yoon&#39;s attacks on trade unions, his labor ministry will soon close dozens of support centers for immigrants, a growing and necessary part of the workforce in South Korea, whose birth rate is the lowest in the world.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Publicly, Biden has not betrayed any concern about Yoon&#39;s autocratic tendencies. “So much of the foreign-policy establishment was gleeful when Yoon was elected,” Jake Werner, of the Quincy Institute, told me. The strategy of all-or-nothing competition with China has meant abiding the growth of other illiberal governments in the region. The White House, Werner said, has not dealt with the fact “that it&#39;s authoritarians who are welcoming the direction we&#39;re taking in foreign policy.” Narendra Modi, of India, has been fêted by Washington, despite abetting Hindu-nationalist violence, revoking Kashmir&#39;s autonomous status, and censoring the media. Vietnam&#39;s President, Vo Van Thuong, was untouched by criticism over crackdowns on press and civil society during Biden&#39;s recent visit; police in Hanoi arrested an environmental campaigner a few days later. Yoon, too, is pushing South Korea in a repressive direction, back to the bad old days of the dictatorship, with no protest from his American partners. ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;vf3f7i&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;2ml6ub&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 30 Sep 2023 19:06:01 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[The Quiet Revolution of the Sabbath]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-weekend-essay/the-quiet-revolution-of-the-sabbath]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-30T10:00:00.000Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.newyorker.com/photos/64cc1500f2c9e3423ae74484/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Cep_Sabbath.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;article >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attribute-verso-pattern=&quot;article-body&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;&quot; >;&lt;button id=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-label=&quot;Save this story&quot; >;&lt;span >;&lt;svg width=&quot;24&quot; height=&quot;24&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;>;&lt;title>;Save this story&lt;/title>;&lt;path d=&quot;M20 23.9508L12.5 19.7312L5 23.9508V2.95081H14V3.93211H6V22.1845L12.5 18.5536L19 22.1845V8.83866H20V23.9508Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;path d=&quot;M23 3H20V0H19V3H16V4H19V7H20V4H23V3Z&quot;>;&lt;/path>;&lt;/svg>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Save this story&lt;/span>;&lt;/button>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;ArticlePageChunks&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;Here is a story I wasn&#39;t sure my sister would ever let me tell. I come from a churchgoing family, but one Sunday my sister did not go to worship, even though the rest of us did. She wasn&#39;t sick. In fact, she was the opposite of sick: recently confirmed, she had simply decided to exercise one of the rights she understood to be hers through confirmation, namely staying home for no reason other than that she wanted to do so. I must have found this shocking—not only her decision but the willingness of our parents to abide—though I can&#39;t really summon a memory of how I felt before worship because of what happened after.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Back then, the sanctuary of our little country church was divided from the fellowship hall by a single doorway. Pitched high on the left and low on the right, the door is uneven, a fact I&#39;ve loved ever since someone told me an apocryphal story about Christ the carpenter helping his father, Joseph, correct a crooked doorframe. I looked at that door every week during worship. For a long time, it was right behind the pulpit, so I would watch it during the entire sermon, waiting expectantly for a similar miracle, for the right corner to rise to meet the left or for the left to fall to meet the right. Whenever I walked through, I dragged my fingers up and down its slanted frame; eventually, I was tall enough to touch its crooked corners.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Some of my earliest memories are of that doorway: stumbling through it with a me-size stuffed donkey for the pageant one Christmas Eve when I was seven; crying as I crossed its threshold toward my godmother&#39;s casket that sat open before the altar; ducking through it as acolyte to light candles in the hopeful silence of the congregation. I rarely enter another sanctuary that I don&#39;t first think of that door. A wonderful thing about the recent renovation of our more-than-hundred-year-old church is that they chose not to right the door, so that even today during worship, I find myself staring at it, although now the pulpit is on its lefthand side.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;When you walk through that crooked doorway into the fellowship hall, you find a sacristy and bathrooms and a kitchen and Sunday-school rooms and a small office. When I was little, there were always two folding chairs in that office for the tellers who counted the offering and a tiny footstool for children like me who liked to sit while their parents sorted checks and stacked cash and added all the figures on an adding machine; if we were lucky, there were loose coins to be sorted into envelopes, or, if we were really lucky, enough for a paper roll. The church had the first photocopier I ever used, and a paper cutter that looked like a machete. Those three pieces of technology—the copier, the calculator, and the cutter—lived in the office beside a telephone, which my father used to call my sister the day that she stayed home.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;My father was only checking on my sister, but, on hearing his side of their conversation, the pastor asked him for the telephone. I was there beside them and I could only imagine how she felt when she suddenly found herself talking not with our father but with our pastor. He had only one question for her: “Do you remember the third commandment?”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;If you are not Catholic or Lutheran, then the commandment in question is actually the fourth. The tablet with the Ten Commandments wasn&#39;t numbered, so the order is of some dispute; at any rate, our pastor was talking about the matter of the Sabbath and how to observe it. That is also the subject of a documentary by the American filmmaker Martin Doblmeier that, in the past few months, has been airing on public television stations and streaming online. Doblmeier has made more than a dozen documentaries about religion, including biographical films devoted to theologians such as Reinhold Niebuhr, Abraham Joshua Heschel, and Howard Thurman; a trilogy about Seventh-day Adventists; and interfaith explorations like “The Power of Forgiveness” and “Chaplains.” Those thematic films survey contemporary spirituality across traditions, looking at forgiveness in the Amish, Buddhist, Jewish, and Muslim faiths or interviewing chaplains of all kinds who work in prisons, meat-processing plants, and war zones.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In “Sabbath,” Doblmeier moves swiftly about the country, consulting with thoughtful sociologists and theologians, capturing the beauty and delight of summer camps and community gardens, talking with the clergy and parishioners at places such as &lt;em >;LIFE&lt;/em>; Adventist Church of Berkeley; the Stephen Wise Free Synagogue, in Manhattan; South Jackson Seventh-day Adventist Church, in Mississippi; the Islamic Center at New York University; and La Iglesia de Nuestra Señora la Reina, in Los Angeles. Viewers can compare b&#39;nai mitzvah, baptisms, Jumuah prayers, congregational potlucks and Shabbat meals, while watching college students figure out their own Sabbath disciplines for the first time away from their families, and pastors with decades of experience change their views on sabbaticals.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;The documentary can sometimes feel like a whirlwind tour, but whirlwinds have been known to produce wisdom. “Sabbath” begins by observing the hurried exhaustion and omnipresent stress of modern life—our digital addictions, our burnout culture, our depression—and then summons the scriptural roots of the film&#39;s core idea, presenting the Sabbath as a possible remedy for our cultural distress. In Genesis, God rests after creating the world; in Exodus, God commands the Israelites to rest: “Six days you shall labor, and do all your work, but the seventh day is a Sabbath to the Lord your God. On it you shall not do any work.” Ammiel Hirsch, a reform rabbi who appears in the film, argues that the fourth commandment was “a revolutionary concept” that “changed human history,” because it is believed to be the first time a religious or political authority, instead of requiring work, had required rest.&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Romans were contemptuous of the practice, maligning Jews as lazy, but even within Judaism interpretations of the commandment to rest varied in the ancient world, with people differing over not only what constituted appropriate worship but what constituted inappropriate work. Some of the most contentious arguments in the Gospels are between Jesus and religious leaders over what he was doing on the Sabbath, not only healing and performing miracles but one day simply gleaning grain with his hungry disciples. On that day, Christ appeals to the example of King David, who ate consecrated bread, telling the Pharisees: “The sabbath was made for man, not man for the sabbath.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;These were not trivial disagreements, and they persist into the present, even about fundamental issues, including which day is the one God intended for humanity to rest from labor. In Judaism, the Shabbat begins with sunset on Friday and ends after sundown on Saturday; Muslims observe Jumuah, coming together for congregational prayer on Fridays. We know from the Book of Acts that early followers of Jesus began gathering on Sundays, and in 321 AD Constantine formalized Sunday as the day of rest for the Roman Empire: “On the venerable day of the Sun let the magistrates and people residing in cities rest, and let all workshops be closed.” Christians today still mostly worship on Sundays, though Seventh-day Baptists and Adventists, for instance, observe their Sabbath on Saturdays.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Observance takes many forms even within the same faith, with those who keep the Sabbath engaging in different degrees of physical and spiritual rest, private meals or public worship, personal formation or collective service, silent prayer or active study. But a welcome corrective offered by the film is the insistence that, for the faithful, whatever happens on this consecrated day matters to all the other days of the week. “Sabbath isn&#39;t simply a pious teaching,” the Duke University professor Norman Wirzba explains. “What&#39;s at issue is the very meaning of life.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;That sense of the Sabbath&#39;s profound importance is part of what brought the Puritans to America. Their strict Sabbatarian beliefs put them in conflict with the English authorities, especially after King James published “The Book of Sports,” in 1617, in which he encouraged his subjects to follow Sunday-morning worship with dancing, games, and recreation in the afternoon. For the Puritans, such encroachments clearly undermined the fourth commandment, and when they could, they passed Sabbatarian laws to protect the Lord&#39;s Day—in Virginia, as early as 1610, it was decreed that “no man or woman shall dare to violate or break the Sabbath by any gaming, public or private abroad, or at home.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Such prohibitions became known as “blue laws,” although no one now remembers why; perhaps because of the color of the paper on which they were printed or bound, or because of the pejorative meaning of the color in the colonial era, as in bluestockings or later variations like bluenoses—those who were prudish or proper. Laws like that proliferated and persisted for the next three centuries, regulating commerce, labor, and recreation on the Lord&#39;s Day throughout the United States. The occasional exception, sparing certain industries or carving out certain activities, made its way through state legislatures here and there, but only during the Cold War, when school prayer and civic displays of religious iconography were challenged in the federal courts, did blue laws become a serious target, too.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Case after case argued that Sunday-closing laws violated the equal-protection clause and the establishment clause of the First Amendment. In 1961, the Supreme Court put the matter to rest, so to speak, when it found, in McGowan v. Maryland, that blue laws are not unconstitutional if they serve a secular purpose, and that choosing Sunday for a common day of rest is a practical choice, not preferential treatment of Christianity. “People of all religions and people with no religion regard Sunday as a time for family activity, for visiting friends and relatives, for late sleeping, for passive and active entertainments, for dining out, and the like,” Chief Justice Earl Warren wrote, in a decision representative of several others on the issue. “Sunday is a day apart from all others. The cause is irrelevant; the fact exists. It would seem unrealistic for enforcement purposes and perhaps detrimental to the general welfare to require a State to choose a common day of rest other than that which most persons would select of their own accord.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Even with that legal protection secured, Sabbatarian laws were revised and repealed around the country in the decades that followed. In some states, business owners argued successfully that these laws were applied capriciously across the same industry (say, only to stores of a certain size) or unfairly to certain industries (say, car sales but not camper sales); in other states, regulators conceded that they were overwhelmed and unable to enforce the law; almost everywhere, economic pressures prevailed, with Sabbath-law critics arguing that revenue was being lost and tax dollars were being forgone. Nonetheless, blue laws did not disappear. Some states still restrict hunting, horse racing, or the sale of alcohol on Sundays, and one segment of “Sabbath” is devoted to the last county in the country to still restrict shopping more broadly.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;That county isn&#39;t Lancaster, in Pennsylvania, or Salt Lake, in Utah. It&#39;s Bergen County, New Jersey, one of the wealthiest counties in one of the country&#39;s wealthiest states, home to Paramus, which boasts more retail sales than any other Zip Code in the United States. Tens of millions of people shop every year in the city&#39;s four large malls, which bring in some six billion dollars annually. New Jersey has had statewide blue laws on the books since 1693, and Bergen County specifically chose them in 1959, when small businesses banded together with clergy and other concerned residents to bolster the county&#39;s local prohibitions; as recently as 1993, the residents voted to preserve their blue laws, continuing to ban the Sunday sale of all sorts of items, including appliances, building materials, cars, clothing, electronics, and furniture. For some retailers, such as Costco, that means welcoming customers but allowing them to purchase only certain goods, blocking off whole aisles; for many others, it means staying closed entirely.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The Bergen County blue-laws advocates interviewed in “Sabbath” offer various nonfinancial arguments for keeping their stores closed on Sundays, from humdrum reasons like less traffic to loftier ones like strengthening community and promoting wellness. Health and longevity are integral to the interviews Martin Doblmeier conducted with Seventh-Day Adventists, too, who observe their Sabbath on Saturdays, and link spiritual well-being to physical well-being. Mostly vegetarian, they exercise regularly and abstain from alcohol and drugs, and, on Saturdays, share communal meals and focus on scripture and service; studies have shown that they have reduced risks of diabetes, cancer, and high blood pressure.&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Critics of blue laws have long argued that they benefit only those individuals who attend religious services on Sunday, not the community at large or creation more broadly. But secular labor unions fought for Sunday closures as a way of guaranteeing time off for weary workers, whether or not they avail themselves of religious services on that day or any other, reasoning partly that a day or set of days must be chosen, not as a means of promoting religion but to insure rest from work. Such activists did not see themselves as advocates for a particular religion or enemies of any other, only as protectors of workers from economic exploitation.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Concerns about exclusivism, although reasonable in a society that values pluralism, have made people afraid to champion a common day of rest, even though, originally, in Mosaic law, the Sabbath was intended to be shared by all, regardless of their religious practice. That day was set apart not only for the Jewish people; in Deuteronomy, it is written: “Six days you shall labor and do all your work; but the seventh day is a sabbath to the Lord your God; in it you shall not do any work, you, or your son, or your daughter, or your manservant, or your maidservant, or your ox, or your ass, or any of your cattle, or the sojourner who is within your gates, that your manservant and your maidservant may rest as well as you.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;This litany includes the usual suspects—you and your children—but also many more: your servants, your ox and your ass, even the strangers in your midst. Everyone is owed a Sabbath, not just those who worship your way; the Sabbath is not only for you and yours but for all. “There&#39;s not a single instance that I can find anywhere in Scripture where God gives Sabbath to an individual,” Nathan Stucky, a professor at the Princeton Theological Seminary, says in the documentary. “It&#39;s always to the community. It&#39;s to the whole creation. It&#39;s to the gathering of God&#39;s people. Sabbath in all its fullness is an exercise of a community.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;We understand this necessity from our own experience: the only effective truce is a collective one. Thus unplugging works best if everyone in your household or office unplugs, and holidays are most holiday-ish when as much of our society as possible is allowed to observe them, when the markets and the banks and the post offices close and all the rest of the busy commercial world does its best to accept that most commerce can wait. Pluralistic commitments have provided cover for economic pressures, when, instead of arguing for a different day of rest, we more often accept there can be no rest, no forgoing revenue or losing business; opposition to the Sabbath is often cloaked in secularism but motivated by greed.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;9kgekhr&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;RowWrapper&quot; >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;mkyksg&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;That opposition is all the more understandable when we consider the radical origins of the Sabbath. Doblmeier&#39;s documentary is most fascinating when it recovers some of how the idea of mandatory rest was integrated into larger ideas of justice in the Torah. He visits Abundance Farm, in Northampton, Massachusetts, where Congregation B&#39;nai Israel took a single acre of urban land on the site of a former alms house and transformed it with methods inspired by Halachic law; the congregation later added another half acre of land nearby. A free community-harvest program reflects an expensive definition of &lt;em>;Pe&#39;ah&lt;/em>;, allowing neighbors and the needy to take peppers, tomatoes, berries, basil, garlic, herbs, potatoes, and many other crops during the harvest season, and Rabbi David Seidenberg explains how the farm observes the &lt;em>;shmita&lt;/em>;, the so-called Sabbath of Sabbaths, which applied to the land itself.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The &lt;em>;shmita&lt;/em>; commands that the earth be allowed to rest every seven years, and that, just as often, debt should be forgiven. Scholars disagree about the extent to which this sort of jubilee was ever practiced in ancient Israel, but in both Leviticus and Deuteronomy, the command is to forgive whatever debts exist between neighbors and to share whatever is needed: “Open your hand,” the scripture says of this sabbath year, “to the poor and needy neighbor in your land.” Such a forgiving and generous scheme is hardly palatable to corporate interests; neither is a weekly rehearsal that echoes and culminates in that grand Sabbath, whatever day you heed it.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;If we regularly took an entire day off from the work and the worry of our lives, we might think about doing it more often; moreover, we might think about how much more others need time to rest, too. Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel once wrote that for Jews, whose sacred architecture isn&#39;t only physical but temporal, “Sabbaths are our great cathedrals.” “Six days a week,” he observed, “we wrestle with the world, wringing profit from the earth; on the Sabbath we especially care for the seed of eternity planted in the soul.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;One need not be religious to find such language arresting, to be stopped by that metaphor and moved by the arc of human history, in all its glory and failures. My wife is a Jewish atheist who has lately taken to baking challah and lighting Shabbat candles on Fridays. I start my Sundays, as best as I am able, with worship, generally at that same church where I first learned the commandments; three generations of my family have worshipped in those home-town pews, and I confess a stubborn preference for being there, where even the headstones in the graveyard are carved with familiar names, and when babies are baptized, I generally know their parents and grandparents and sometimes even great-grandparents. Other times I find my way to some unfamiliar sanctuary, wherever I am for work or whatever has carried me away from home.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;My sister isn&#39;t really a churchgoer these days, and I assumed that she would be embarrassed by the story I wanted to share from our childhood when I told her about Doblmeier&#39;s documentary. She wasn&#39;t at all. Instead, she told me, I was wrong: our pastor&#39;s question had never struck her as admonishing, only loving. She understood that someone who had devoted his life to the Sabbath was asking her to consider it anew, which she has never stopped doing, even if rarely in pews. ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;8p89mq&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot;

>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-journey-hook=&quot;client-content&quot; data-testid=&quot;BodyWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;p >;The Reverend Purlie Victorious Judson (Leslie Odom, Jr.), the hero of Ossie Davis&#39;s 1961 comedy, “Purlie Victorious: A Non-Confederate Romp Through the Cotton Patch”—revived on Broadway at the Music Box Theatre, directed by Kenny Leon—is, above all else, a hustler. You might know somebody like this: He blusters onto the stage of your life, pouring out plans before he&#39;s properly introduced himself, energized toward some vista that only he can see. He puts an arm over your shoulder and tries to convince you that you&#39;re on your way there together, as partners, but in his mind&#39;s eye, you can tell, he&#39;s up in the pulpit and you&#39;re down in the seats. Half of what he says sounds cockamamie, but something about him—his personal history, perhaps, or a kind of animal endurance in his bearing—persuades you that, somehow, he&#39;ll get what he wants.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In the case of this show, most of what Purlie wants is a fair shake for Black people. He&#39;s an itinerant minister who has come back to the postbellum Georgia plantation where he grew up. He wants to rally the people there—who now work as sharecroppers for Ol&#39; Cap&#39;n Cotchipee (the intensely funny Jay O. Sanders)—to take back their local church, Big Bethel. He cooks up a scheme that will, with one stroke, get them the deed to the church and free his family from their impossible debts to Ol&#39; Cap&#39;n.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Purlie&#39;s a benign enough con man whose con is social justice. He talks sonorously, in a nearly constant preacher&#39;s cadence; he always seems to be skiing downhill, with great skill and heedless abandon, toward some grand, irrefutable point. When he gets really wound up, he adopts a half-sung, high-flown, heavily syncopated tone whose aim is less to emphasize an argument than to stoke a frenzy in a row of invisible congregants. At a peak moment, he rattles off this rhyming confection: “Let us, therefore, stifle the rifle of conflict, shatter the scatter of discord, smuggle the struggle, tickle the pickle, and grapple the apple of peace!”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;It&#39;s clear that the clergy isn&#39;t his first racket, and it might not be his last. “Last time you was a professor of Negro philosophy,” his sister-in-law, Missy (Heather Alicia Simms), says, with a hint of acid in her voice. “You got yourself a license?” As the play unfolds, we watch Purlie oscillate between courage and cowardice, brilliance and haplessness, forthrightness and a penchant for telling tall tales. His plan is to pass off a girl whom he captivated via one of his sermons, Lutiebelle Gussie Mae Jenkins (Kara Young), as his long-lost cousin, Bee, and trick Ol&#39; Cap&#39;n into handing over a five-hundred-dollar inheritance that he owes the family.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Purlie&#39;s brother, Gitlow (the always impressive Billy Eugene Jones), works for Ol&#39; Cap&#39;n and plays his role as the Good Negro, singing and shuffling, to a T. He&#39;s been given the farcical title Deputy-for-the-Colored. Another Black member of Ol&#39; Cap&#39;n&#39;s household is Idella (Vanessa Bell Calloway), who has raised Ol&#39; Cap&#39;n&#39;s son, Charlie (Noah Robbins), as if he were her own. Purlie&#39;s got to corral all these co-racialists—and their divergent loyalties—and lead them all toward reclaiming Big Bethel.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;In creating Purlie, Davis took two long-lasting tropes of communal Black life and twinned them in a single body. On the one hand, Purlie is reminiscent of Father Divine, or, later, the Reverend Ike—a flashy, overconfident preacher who makes lofty promises of prosperity and wins wild, irrational allegiance from Black masses grown tired of living like the lowly Jesus. On the other hand, he&#39;s decided on a career as a self-appointed, semi-professional spokesman for the race. He&#39;s T. D. Jakes and Al Sharpton all at once, a study in the uses and abuses of oratory in Black life.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;A creature like Purlie, made up of cultural memory and social satire, is often hard to play. Cliché and niche obscurity, the Scylla and Charybdis of in-group commentary, lie to either side of the role. But Odom guides his performance cannily, playing each of Purlie&#39;s notes with a musician&#39;s tonal perfection. Sometimes he&#39;s an overbearing tuba, sometimes he&#39;s an earnest flute. Odom makes plain at every impasse that, sure, Purlie cares about his image, about collecting disciples—but that he also wakes up each morning with his mind on real freedom for his people.&lt;/p>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;“Purlie Victorious” is also an investigation of the allure of text in American life. There&#39;s lots of to-do about documents. Purlie&#39;s preaching draws richly from the American past instead of from the Bible. “I preached the New Baptism of Freedom for all mankind, according to the Declaration,” he tells Missy, describing the sermon that drew Lutiebelle to his flock, “taking as my text the Constitution of the United States of America, Amendments First through Fifteenth, which readeth as follows: &#39;Congress shall make no law—&#39; ”&lt;/p>;&lt;div data-attr-viewport-monitor=&quot;inline-recirc&quot; >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p >;Charlie, Ol&#39; Cap&#39;n Cotchipee&#39;s egalitarian, integrationist son, constantly refers to statutes. Integration is “the law of the land,” he says to his father, “and I intend to obey it!” The rightful inheritance that Purlie means to purloin by madcap deception is another promissory note whose power drives the action of the play. This obsession with text alienates Purlie and Charlie, and anybody who&#39;d follow them, from the more sensual, instinctual culture of the formerly slaveholding South. Guys like Ol&#39; Cap&#39;n Cotchipee and, in a different way, Gitlow Judson can&#39;t be bothered with the nuances of the law or the declamations of the Declaration: their rules, long held, are unwritten. You know where you fit in by following patterns deeply rooted in the past. Between Blacks and whites there&#39;s something “no Supreme Court in the world can understand,” Ol&#39; Cap&#39;n says.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;It&#39;s funny, then, that this production&#39;s greatest asset, by far, is its emphasis on physical comedy. Odom finds a lyricism in Purlie&#39;s body that&#39;s not always evident in his rhetoric. Jones pairs Gitlow&#39;s nostalgic singing of Negro work songs with a dancer&#39;s precision, allowing his body to convey an ironic subversion: even the most archetypal Uncle Tom might have wordless designs on a brighter future. The whole company moves in choreographed tandem—one bit, at a particularly melodramatic moment, has them running up and downstage like relay racers, skidding with cartoonish exaggeration.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Then there&#39;s Kara Young, whose turn as Lutiebelle is a pinnacle of her burgeoning career. Young&#39;s performances in recent plays such as C. A. Johnson&#39;s “All the Natalie Portmans,” Lynn Nottage&#39;s “Clyde&#39;s,” and last year&#39;s revival of Martyna Majok&#39;s “Cost of Living” showed off her otherworldly comic chops, which she grounds in what feels like a small, true place of personal pain. Here, though, in Lutiebelle, Young has found a perfect vehicle to transmit all the aspects of her talent.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Lutiebelle is a poor, sweet young woman who feels unequal to the task of impersonating Purlie&#39;s cousin Bee—Bee was a beautiful college girl, and Lutiebelle doesn&#39;t consider herself pretty, or smart—but she&#39;s been waiting for a long time, it seems, for a chance at adventure. She was abandoned by her parents at an early age, and it takes almost nothing for her to fall in love with Purlie and his talk. She worries and pines and pouts and puts on airs and tries to learn—in this way, she&#39;s almost a metaphor for an entire race trying to squirm itself, by hook or by crook, toward higher ground.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Young plays Lutiebelle with a physical and emotional energy reminiscent of Lucille Ball&#39;s or Carol Burnett&#39;s. She acts big and broad, then pulls the string of her imagination right back, showing how small, everyday hurt, the kind we all carry around, can fuel a great fire of productive delusion. Young&#39;s approach to acting is like the sophisticated engine of a sleek sports car—she floors the pedal around perilous curves and somehow stops on a dime. There&#39;s nobody quite like her in the theatre, or anywhere else, these days.&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Kenny Leon, with his flair for showmanship and sizzle, is the ideal director to match Young&#39;s indomitable energy. His frenetic pacing and elaborate physical setups create a framework in which her intricate riffs can add up to a meaning that stretches beyond the text. Young&#39;s hilarious, heartening Lutiebelle fulfills a hope shared by lovers of performance and workers for social peace—that freedom might be found not only on a page but written in a body, and on the heart. ♦&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;aside style=&quot;position:absolute;top:auto;height:auto&quot; data-testid=&quot;PersistentAsideWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;zzoko&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div data-node-id=&quot;t9b86&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;aside data-testid=&quot;PaywallInlineBarrierWrapper&quot;>;&lt;div role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/article>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 30 Sep 2023 19:06:01 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
