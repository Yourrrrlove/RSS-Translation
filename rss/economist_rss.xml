/div>;&lt;p data-caps=&quot;initial&quot;>;&lt;span data-caps=&quot;initial&quot;>;&lt;/span>;在英格兰南海岸城市南安普敦的一个阴沉的春日，一名身穿喷气背包的男子正要和一个跨栏运动员正面交锋。在附近，世界上最快的独轮手推车、马桶和带轮垃圾箱的发明者正准备与他们的机动装置相互较量&lt;!-- -->;（事实证明，最快的是马桶）。跑道的另一端站着一位留着胡须的裁判员，他身穿深蓝色的银色滚边西装，佩戴着写有“吉尼斯世界纪录”的徽章。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;当你想象一项世界纪录时，你会想到什么？也许是尤塞恩·博尔特和他跑完100米所需的9.58秒，或者是英国在位时间最长的女王伊丽莎白二世，或者是海洋最深点马里亚纳海沟。如果您不认为佩戴喷气背包的人完成跨栏训练的最快时间（顺便说一下，42.06 秒）是一个合理的记录，这也是情有可原的。 &lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div>;&lt;div id=&quot;econ-1&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;但是吉尼斯世界纪录（&lt;small>;GWR&lt;/小>;）自20世纪50年代以来一直在评判世界上最快、最强和最高的人，思想更加开放。这种态度部分源于真诚——&lt;small>;GWR&lt;/small>;员工往往对打破纪录表现出滑稽的热情和书呆子般的热情。但是，它也越来越与金钱有关。&lt;!-- -->; 南安普敦的破纪录活动是由一家试图推销手机充电器的电子公司赞助的。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;在我成长的过程中，在 20 世纪 90 年代，“吉尼斯纪录”是世界上最畅销的版权书籍。但数字时代的到来以及人们对纸质图书兴趣的下降迫使&lt;small>;GWR&lt;/small>;转向。如今，该公司的大部分收入来自品牌合作伙伴关系和数字内容的制作。公司或个人只需花费 11,000 英镑起，即可聘请 &lt;small>;GWR&lt;/small>; 来帮助他们创造或打破记录。 &lt;small>;GWR&lt;/small>; 的“顾问”将就此次尝试的筹划和评审所涉及的后勤工作提供建议，而其内部制作团队将拍摄内容并将其编辑成适合社交媒体的剪辑。&lt;/p >;&lt;p>;&lt;cite>;在当今的注意力经济中，GWR 授予“世界最伟大”称号的能力是宝贵的知识产权&lt;/cite>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;在当今的注意力经济中，品牌和影响者都迫切需要为了在源源不断的内容中脱颖而出，&lt;small>;GWR&lt;/small>; 能够授予“世界上最伟大”的称号，这是宝贵的知识产权。 Virgin Media 创造了最快的团队下坡滑板记录（宽带广告），本田则制作了最大的橄榄球马赛克作为团队凝聚力的练习。 （&lt;small>;GWR&lt;/small>; 网站上的一句生动的话：“我们不仅创造了最大的未装箱物品的吉尼斯世界纪录，还创造了北美沃尔沃卡车观看次数最多的电影记录。 ”) &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;出于对 &lt;small>;GWR&lt;/small>; 所谓的“基于记录的定制解决方案”的更多了解，我与 &lt;small>;GWR&lt;/small>; 的 Lewis Blakeman 进行了交谈唱片内容支持主管主动提出帮助我找到我可以特别擅长的一件事。布莱克曼首先问了我一些关于我的兴趣的问题；从很多方面来说，这一阶段的过程都充满了第一次约会时的所有尝试性尴尬。我告诉他我在《经济学人》的音频部门工作。我建议，也许我可以尝试在听大量播客的基础上录制一张唱片？ &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“问题在于如何定义倾听，”布莱克曼告诉我。 “读书也是一样。我们没有任何阅读记录本身，因为你如何证明某人确实阅读了他们所说的内容？”记录必须可由第三方验证且可标准化，以便其他人可以尝试完全相同的记录。他们还必须有一个单一的、明确的可测量变量。 （&lt;small>;GWR&lt;/small>; 确实有最长的大声朗读时间记录，因为这是可以测量的。）&lt;/p>;&lt;figure>;&lt;span itemscope=&quot;&quot; itemProp=&quot;image&quot; itemType=&quot; https://schema.org/ImageObject&quot;>;&lt;meta itemProp=&quot;url&quot; content=&quot;https://www.economist.com/img/b/1620/1081/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231107_1843_World_Record_02.jpg &quot;/>;&lt;img load=&quot;lazy&quot;

的早期员工有着不同的目标。事实上，吉尼斯世界纪录是由亚瑟·吉尼斯父子&lt;!-- -->; 创建的，作为营销啤酒厂黑啤酒的一种精明方式。董事总经理休·比弗爵士 (Sir Hugh Beaver) 聘请了罗斯·麦克沃特 (Ross McWhirter) 和诺里斯·麦克沃特 (Norris McWhirter)——这对受过牛津大学教育的双胞胎，经营一家报纸和其他出版物的事实调查机构——编写一本事实书，为人们在酒吧里可能争论的问题提供明确的答案。 。 1955 年出版的第一版《吉尼斯世界纪录大全》反映了其创建者所发现的世界，并由该书的编辑人员检查了其中的离散事实。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;cite>;吉尼斯世界纪录亚瑟·吉尼斯父子公司创造了这些纪录&lt;!-- -->; 作为营销啤酒厂烈性黑啤酒的一种精明方式&lt;/cite>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;尽管这本书非常受欢迎，诺里斯开始对这个方向感到厌烦&lt;小>;GWR&lt;/小>;正在占领（罗斯于1975年被&lt;小>;爱尔兰共和军&lt;/小>;杀害）。这本书不再是对世界的记录，而是反映了某些人为了被认为是某件事上的佼佼者而付出的努力。人们开始创造并打破记录，以进入这本书本身，并且它开始以更多涉及富人和名人的记录为特色，比如理查德布兰森，他创造了许多热气球和其他特技的记录。 1999 年，诺里斯（现已不再在公司工作）&lt;!-- -->; 出版了他自己的、更清醒的替代品，称为“千年记录之书”&lt;!-- -->;（失败了）。 2004年，他在打网球时去世；仅仅几个月后，《2004​​ 年吉尼斯世界纪录》就售出了第一亿本。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;但转变已经开始，这无疑会让麦克沃特更加失望。 2001 年，吉尼斯母公司决定出售&lt;small>;GWR&lt;/small>;。经过几次易手后，&lt;small>;GWR&lt;/small>; 于 2008 年被 Jim Pattison 集团收购，该集团是 Ripley&#39;s Believe it Or Not 特许经营权的所有者，该特许经营权以宣传奇怪或离奇的事件和物体而闻名。里普利的怪异博物馆与几十年来一直歌颂像史里达尔·奇拉尔（Shridhar Chillal）这样的人物（指甲最长的人）的书之间有明显的相似之处。 （66 年后，奇拉尔把它们剪掉了。这些钉子——其中最长的有 197.8 厘米——现在挂在纽约和阿姆斯特丹的 Ripley 博物馆中。）2009 年，&lt;small>;GWR&lt;/small>; 的“顾问”被出生。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;拉里·奥姆斯特德 (Larry Olmsted) 撰写了一本关于进入“吉尼斯世界纪录”的回忆录，他告诉我，他将破纪录和 &lt;small>;GWR&lt;/small>; 的早期历史视为“真人秀&lt;small>;电视&lt;/small>;的先驱”。奥姆斯特德打破了一天内两轮高尔夫球之间最远距离的记录（在悉尼和洛杉矶的球场）；他还创造了最长连续扑克比赛的记录（连续72小时）。 “吉尼斯世界纪录是一种原始的说法，‘嘿，看看我，我很重要。我很特别，”他说。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;他认为，吉尼斯世界纪录也有一些民主的成分，这有助于巩固其大众吸引力。 “当我打破高尔夫记录时，规则明确规定我必须乘坐商用喷气式飞机，”奥姆斯特德说。 “这样你就不会让像比尔·盖茨这样的人驾驶他的湾流飞机并打破纪录。”&lt;/p>;&lt;figure>;&lt;span itemscope=&quot;&quot;

文件。我的壮举必须由两名独立目击者用秒表记录下来，精确到百分之一秒。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;想起奥姆斯特德所说的关于&lt;small>;GWR&lt;/small>;的民主精神，我决定使用我上班时骑的那辆古老的单速自行车（一位参加铁人三项赛的朋友）在碳纤维自行车上，我将其描述为一对通过脚手架连接的垃圾箱盖）。一天晚上，我首先记录了办公室附近的站点：沿着斯特兰德街，沿着弓街，经过皇家歌剧院，穿过莱斯特广场，然后转向特拉法加广场。 &lt;/p>;&lt;figure>;&lt;span itemscope=&quot;&quot;

“从来没有一个时代有如此多的社会比较， ”罗伯逊说。 “每个人都是一个品牌，而这一切都是为了吸引人们的注意力。”对他来说，&lt;small>;GWR&lt;/small>; 在社交媒体时代蓬勃发展并不奇怪：它提供了验证，并将人们推向了他们自己创造的基座。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;他告诉我心理学的一项发现，即“在任何类别中获得奥斯卡奖的人平均比在同一类别中获得提名的人多活三年。诺贝尔奖获得者也是如此，他们的平均寿命比提名者多一年半。”这些人已经取得了如此伟大的成就，他们不再需要将自己与他人进行比较。一天晚上，我沿着白教堂路高速骑行，想知道我是否也能享受最短暂的不朽滋味。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;八月的一个周日早上，我终于进行了正式的记录尝试。我从老肯特路骑自行车出去；没有交通堵塞，天气恰到好处，20℃：温暖，但不足以让我出汗。我的两位计时员——我的室友和我们的一位朋友——打扮成大富翁的男人（和女人），在我出发时为我鸣响喇叭（按照布莱克曼指南的规定）。 &lt;/p>;&lt;figure>;&lt;span itemscope=&quot;&quot;

His name was Craig Glenday, and he has been the editor-in-chief and the institutional memory of the &lt;small>;GWR&lt;/small>; for the past two decades. He was carrying a water pistol, which he gingerly placed into a glass cabinet full of objects. Noticing my curious gaze he explained that it came from one of the world&#39;s largest water pistol fights (in 2007, between 2,671 people in Spain) and had been kicking around his living room for a few years. He beckoned me closer to the cabinet and pointed out some of its contents. (A piece of rock, inlaid with a fossilised fish bone and spine of an ancient cuttlefish, was apparently the oldest piece of vomit ever found.) “I need to set up an iPad here with info on everything,” he said. “Otherwise, who will know what all this stuff is when I&#39;m gone?” &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;cite>;It was no surprise to neuroscientist Ian Robertson that GWR had thrived in the social-media age: it offered validation, and hoisted people on to pedestals of their own making&lt;/cite>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I continued to chat with Glenday in the break room. He remembered his excitement at being offered a job at &lt;small>;GWR&lt;/small>; in the 1980s: “For me, it was like some weird magical castle in the sky or something, you know, and I expected to walk into the foyer and see conjoined twins on reception and giants filing things and all that.” &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;It still retained some magic, I thought, staring at a portrait of Glenday by the man with the world&#39;s longest tongue, who was able to curl his appendage round a paintbrush. (You could tell it was Glenday by the glasses.) I asked him whether &lt;small>;GWR&lt;/small>;&#39;s consultancy arm had changed the way he thought of the place. “People think we&#39;re a quango or like a governmental organisation,” Glenday said, “but we&#39;re a profit-earning business. We had to evolve to survive.” In a way he found it flattering that people thought the organisation might have sold out: “It just means that people see us as being more than just a book. We&#39;ve become a cultural phenomenon.” &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;It wasn&#39;t surprising that &lt;small>;GWR&lt;/small>; had realised that the fervent desire of people to have their odd skills and habits recognised as special created a business opportunity. But the book exists only because of &lt;small>;GWR&lt;/small>;&#39;s fastidiousness, and its embrace of strange feats. “We are very pedantic,” Jack Brockbank, an adjudicator who would assess my record attempt, told me with a chuckle before he went to look at my materials. He would parse through the various items I had uploaded to the &lt;small>;GWR&lt;/small>; records portal the night before, including the video I had taken of the route with a Go-Pro camera attached to my helmet, and all of the selfies. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Brockbank returned, 20 minutes later&lt;b>;,&lt;/b>; carrying a mounted certificate. With a flourish, he presented me with the record, in front of Glenday and a smattering of employees who happened to be using the staff kitchen. I felt childlike and giddy, amazed that this certificate actually meant something to me. Someone in full Lycra and with a fast bike will inevitably huff and puff their way around London in pursuit of my record, and of an ephemeral moment of greatness. Good luck to them – records are made to be broken. &lt;span data-ornament=&quot;ufinish&quot;>;■&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;b>;Barclay Bram&lt;/b>; produces podcast series for &lt;i>;The Economist &lt;/i>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;small>;PHOTOGRAPHS &lt;b>;WILL HARTLEY&lt;/b>;&lt;/small>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 12 Nov 2023 06:57:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[How the term “genocide” is misused in the Israel-Hamas war | The Economist explains]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2023/11/10/how-the-term-genocide-is-misused-in-the-israel-hamas-war]]><description> &lt;img src=&quot;https://images.weserv.nl/?url=www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/media-assets/image/20231111_BLP511.jpg&quot;/>;&lt;div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-caps=&quot;initial&quot;>;&lt;span data-caps=&quot;initial&quot;>;M&lt;/span>;&lt;small>;ANY GOVERNMENTS&lt;/small>; and citizens are appalled by the civilian casualties from Israel&#39;s bombardment and invasion of Gaza, which is its response to Hamas&#39;s attack on Israel. On October 10th the Palestinian envoy to the &lt;small>;UN&lt;/small>;, Riyad Mansour, described Israel&#39;s actions as “nothing less than genocidal”. Iran and Iraq have also accused Israel of genocide. Politically, it is clear why Israel&#39;s enemies should invoke the heinous crime. But the allegation has also been made by countries that have usually been friendly to Israel. Colombia, Honduras and South Africa have all withdrawn their ambassadors from Israel, accusing its government of committing “genocide”. &lt;/p>;&lt;aside>;&lt;p>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.com/israel-hamas&quot;>;&lt;i>;Read all our coverage of the war between Israel and Hamas&lt;/i>;&lt;/a>;&lt;/p>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;div>;&lt;div>;&lt;div id=&quot;econ-1&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Protesters and commentators in the West use the term too. “It is now clear that Israel is engaging in a genocide of the Palestinian people,” argued M. Muhannad Ayyash, a professor of sociology at Mount Royal University in Calgary, Canada. Craig Mokhiber, director of the New York office of the &lt;small>;UN&lt;/small>; High Commissioner for Human Rights, wrote on October 28th that “This is a text-book case of genocide.” Israel has both denied genocide and accused Hamas of the crime. Gilad Erdan, Israel&#39;s permanent representative to the &lt;small>;UN&lt;/small>;, said on October 26th that “This is not a war with the Palestinians. Israel is at war with the genocidal Hamas terrorist organisation.” What exactly is genocide, and how, if at all, is the term applicable to the current conflict? &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In December 1948, in the aftermath of the second world war, the &lt;small>;UN&lt;/small>; adopted the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. The convention defines a genocide as acts intended “to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group”. Contrary to the common understanding of the term, the &lt;small>;UN&lt;/small>; says not only killing counts. “Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction” does too, as does inflicting “serious bodily or mental harm”, “measures intended to prevent births”, and “forcibly transferring children of the group to another group”. Categorising atrocities as genocide has legal implications. The International Criminal Court is able to indict someone for the crime, for example. &lt;br/>;&lt;br/>;Interpretations of the convention differ because it is so broadly framed. So which atrocities constitute genocide? The systematic murder of 6m Jews by the Nazis was genocide. The organised butchery of perhaps 500,000 ethnic Tutsis by Hutu militias in Rwanda in 1994 was too. In both cases the intent, to destroy a people, was clear. Yet the case of Darfur, in Sudan, where about 300,000 people died in the years after fighting broke out there in 2003, is less clear. America called this a genocide. But in 2005 a &lt;small>;UN&lt;/small>; commission concluded that Sudan&#39;s government had “not pursued a policy of genocide” (although some individuals may have acted with “genocidal intent”). Donald Trump&#39;s administration called the Chinese government&#39;s treatment of the Uyghurs in Xinjiang a genocide but others&lt;!-- -->; disagreed. This newspaper concluded that China&#39;s persecution of the Uyghurs was “horrific”, but not genocidal.&lt;br/>;&lt;br/>;By the &lt;small>;UN&lt;/small>; definition, Hamas is a genocidal organisation. Its founding charter, published in 1988, explicitly commits it to obliterating Israel. Article 7 states that “The Day of Judgment will not come about until Moslems fight Jews and kill them”. Article 13 rejects any compromise, or peace, until Israel is destroyed. Hamas fighters who burst into Israel on October 7th and killed more than 1,400 Israelis (and other nationalities) were carrying out the letter of their genocidal law. &lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div>;&lt;div id=&quot;econ-2&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Israel, by contrast, does not meet the test of genocide. There is little evidence that Israel, like Hamas, “intends” to destroy an ethnic group—the Palestinians. Israel does want to destroy Hamas, a militant group, and is prepared to kill civilians in doing so. And while some Israeli extremists might want to eradicate the Palestinians, that is not a government policy. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Neither do the Israelis display any obvious intent to prevent Palestinian births. But those who accuse it of genocide point to the large number of civilians killed, at least 10,000 so far, and claim its blockade of the strip meets the “conditions-of-life” criterion. The Israelis have clearly inflicted “serious bodily or mental harm” on the Palestinians. They have also displaced people from the north of the strip. If those people are not allowed to return, this could be considered a partial destruction of their territory or, as Jan Egeland, a former &lt;small>;UN&lt;/small>; head of humanitarian and relief efforts, has warned, a forcible population transfer.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Even if an army&#39;s actions do not pass the threshold of genocide, they can still be wrong. As the &lt;small>;UN&lt;/small>; concluded during its report into Darfur, “crimes against humanity and war crimes that have been committed…may be no less serious and heinous than genocide”. &lt;span data-ornament=&quot;ufinish&quot;>;■&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 12 Nov 2023 06:27:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[The best films of 2023, as chosen by The Economist | Culture]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/culture/2023/11/10/the-best-films-of-2023-as-chosen-by-the-economist]]><description> &lt;img src=&quot;https://images.weserv.nl/?url=www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/media-assets/image/20231111_CUP508.jpg&quot;/>;&lt;div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;b>;“Anatomy of a Fall”&lt;/b>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;A man is found dead in the snow outside his Alpine chalet.他是从阁楼窗户跳下来的，还是被妻子推的？ The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.com/culture/2023/05/30/anatomy-of-a-fall-a-riveting-whodunnit-wins-at-cannes&quot;>;winner of the Palme d&#39;Or at Cannes&lt;/a>;, Justine Triet&#39;s courtroom drama is both a gripping whodunnit and an unsparing examination of the sexual and professional rivalries within a marriage.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;b>;The Boy and the Heron”&lt;/b>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/2020/06/04/for-hayao-miyazaki-flight-is-a-metaphor-for-freedom&quot;>;Hayao Miyazaki&lt;/a>;, a co-founder of Studio Ghibli, has said that this will be his final film—and what a swansong it is.

So, consequently, are the ethics of commenting on it.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;But in the war in Israel and Gaza, some things are simple: the horrendous atrocities committed by Hamas cannot be justified, under any circumstances.另一个简单的事实是，加沙的许多巴勒斯坦人完全是无辜的，是以色列和哈马斯的受害者，正在遭受可怕的灾难。 It is highly disconcerting that these two simple facts are in need of emphasising, but there are plenty who are happy to offer pseudo-sophisticated ways of denying at least one of them.&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div>;&lt;div id=&quot;econ-1&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Even when it comes to the morality of the war effort itself, some things are clear: Israel has not just the right to defend itself, but a duty to its citizens to protect them against the threats Hamas (and others) pose.同样明确的是：即使是在追求正义战争，也不能以平民为目标。 And when harm to innocents is a necessary and foreseeable result of legitimate attacks on combatants, in order to be morally acceptable it must be proportionate to the harm the military operation is intended to prevent.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Some of the underlying principles of the morality of war are, then, straightforward enough. (Not all, by the way: for instance, it is not at all clear whether a state using force should be neutral between harm to its own civilians and harm to the enemy&#39;s, and if it shouldn&#39;t, how much priority it should give to its own people.) But what follows from this as far as real-life conflicts are concerned is an extremely complicated matter, about which most of us don&#39;t have anything like the level of information needed to draw conclusions with any confidence.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;What are the dangers to its civilians that Israel is now fighting to eliminate?未来来自哈马斯、真主党或其他组织的袭击的可能性有多大？为了成功？以色列是否可以采取其他措施来减少对无辜者的伤害？ （不，结束占领虽然在道义上至关重要，但目前以色列无法采取替代措施来保护其公民。） 哈马斯的战术，包括使用巴勒斯坦平民作为“人盾”，是如何发挥作用的？ ”，影响病态但不可或缺的比例演算？在10月7日令人难以置信的情报失败之后，以色列如何才能恢复显着的威慑效果？ What can Israel do to free the hostages Hamas (and perhaps others in Gaza) continue to hold?&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div>;&lt;div id=&quot;econ-2&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Nothing at all can be responsibly said about what Israel should and should not do right now without at least partial answers to these complex questions.即使是善意的立即停火呼吁也无法逃脱这种命运，因为停火是否符合以色列保护其公民（甚至只是释放人质）的义务还远非显而易见。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Calls for an immediate ceasefire are entirely understandable: given the magnitude of the devastation in Gaza, as well as continued threats to Israelis, any decent person may feel a strong desire that it should all just stop.但这样的愿望虽然可以理解，但却不是健全政策的基础。如果你认为考虑到事实的不确定性，呼吁停火是合理的，这是一种在安全方面犯错误的方式，你应该记住，当谈到战争时，通常没有安全方面。 Any mistakes—using too much force, not using enough—will be paid for in the only relevant currency, the blood of innocents.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;It may be hoped that decision-makers have more information than the rest of us do, and that they give appropriate weight in their deliberations to the relevant moral constraints. But it can hardly be denied that in many of its policy actions over many years prior to October 7th, and in some of its current official and unofficial statements, Israel has rightfully earned the distrust of many—myself included.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;What is a conscientious public intellectual to do?对于正在我们眼前展开的可怕悲剧，我们肯定有话要说吗？事实上，哲学家和其他知识分子不仅以个人的形式，而且以团体的形式参与进来。 In one such intervention, 45 academics from the University of Oxford wrote an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttps://academicsongaza.wixsite.com/gazaopenletter&quot;>;open letter&lt;/a>; condemning Israel and calling on Britain&#39;s political leaders to urge an immediate ceasefire, without so much as a gesture in the direction of the uncertainties involved. In another &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttps://sites.google.com/view/philosophyforpalestine/home?pli=1&quot;>;public text&lt;/a>;, signed mostly by North-America-based academic philosophers, anti-colonialist jargon was lifted unmodified from the nice-sounding-slogans shelf and applied with no sensitivity to any of the facts relevant here.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Intellectuals &lt;i>;should&lt;/i>; comment on public affairs, and it&#39;s okay if they sometimes do it in a way that is not quite as nuanced as their next academic publication.但当他们这样做时，他们应该强调复杂性，而不是隐藏它们。他们可能是战争道德的一些一般原则的专家，但如果他们不认识到将这些知识应用于现实世界场景总是必然对事实敏感，那么他们毕竟不知道首先是关于他们的主题。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;When public intellectuals make confident but factually unfounded proclamations on such matters, they degrade their respective fields, and to the extent that they have an effect in the real world they risk taking part in bringing about disastrous policies. In short, they betray their role as intellectuals, serving to fuel legitimate doubts about how much they know or care about the real world, indeed about real people.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Perhaps moral philosophers can contribute to public discourse even now—for instance, in thinking about how decisions should be made given the tremendous uncertainty involved, or to insist on the relevance of some neglected considerations.或者也许我们应该承认，我们也感到尴尬，我们无法确定该说什么。根据您的期望，这可能会令人失望。但与当今公共话语中的许多其他干预措施不同，这样的回应至少是诚实的。 And probably less harmful as well.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;i>;David Enoch is a professor of philosophy of law at Balliol College, University of Oxford, and a professor in the philosophy department and the faculty of law at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.&lt;/i>;&lt;span data-ornament=&quot;ufinish&quot;>;■&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 11 Nov 2023 23:27:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Boston’s “cradle of liberty” was paid for with slavery profits | United States]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/11/09/bostons-cradle-of-liberty-was-paid-for-with-slavery-profits]]><description> &lt;img src=&quot;https://images.weserv.nl/?url=www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/media-assets/image/20231111_USP003.jpg&quot;/>;&lt;div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-caps=&quot;initial&quot;>;&lt;span data-caps=&quot;initial&quot;>;T&lt;/span>;&lt;small>;O MANY AMERICANS&lt;/small>;, Faneuil Hall is sacred ground. Built in 1742 as a market place and meeting hall, it became the centre of Boston&#39;s civic life. In the years leading to the American revolution, town-hall meetings became debates on the Sugar Tax of 1764, the Stamp Act of 1765 and taxing tea. It was where Bostonians like Samuel Adams voiced dissent against what they saw as oppressive British policies. Later it became a forum where anti-slavery advocates held rallies and organised against fugitive-slave laws. Abolitionists such as William Lloyd Garrison and Frederick Douglass, who had escaped from slavery, gave impassioned speeches. Suffragists also used Faneuil Hall to rally support for political and social rights for women. &lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;figure>;&lt;div>;&lt;figcaption>;Listen to this story.&lt;/figcaption>; &lt;span>;Enjoy more audio and podcasts on&lt;!-- -->; &lt;a id=&quot;audio-ios-cta&quot; href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttps://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/bed1b25&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;>;iOS&lt;/a>; &lt;!-- -->;or&lt;!-- -->; &lt;a id=&quot;audio-android-cta&quot; href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttps://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/7f3c199&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;>;Android&lt;/a>;.&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;audio controls=&quot;&quot; id=&quot;audio-player&quot; preload=&quot;none&quot; src=&quot;https://www.economist.com/media-assets/audio/020%20United%20States%20-%20Renaming%20landmarks-0d25c82305041b99e9e45cd1841896ce.mp3&quot; title=&quot;Boston&#39;s “cradle of liberty” was paid for with slavery profits&quot; controlsList=&quot;nodownload&quot;>;&lt;p>;Your browser does not support the &amp;lt;audio&amp;gt; element.&lt;/p>;&lt;/audio>;&lt;div>;&lt;div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;But the building known as the “cradle of liberty”, like much of American history, is scarred by slavery. Its construction was funded by, and named after, Peter Faneuil, a wealthy merchant who owned slaves and profited from the slave trade, including partially financing ships that went to Africa. Last month Boston&#39;s city council passed a resolution asking the city to give Faneuil Hall a nobler name, such as “Liberty Hall”, or perhaps rename it after Douglass or Crispus Attucks, a sailor of African and indigenous ancestry, who was killed by British soldiers in the Boston massacre. The resolution is toothless, because only the city&#39;s public-facilities commission can rename buildings owned by the city. But it is symbolically important. &lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div>;&lt;div id=&quot;econ-1&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Boston is the latest to contemplate changing a landmark name. Earlier this year America&#39;s military establishment began changing army-base names referring to Confederate officers: Fort Bragg became Fort Liberty. The navy renamed the &lt;i>;&lt;small>;USS&lt;/small>;&lt;/i>; &lt;i>;Chancellorsville&lt;/i>;, which commemorates a Confederate victory, for Robert Smalls, a black civil-war hero. Since 2015, more than 480 Confederate symbols have been renamed, removed or moved from public places, according to the Southern Poverty Law Centre, which keeps count.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Renaming Faneuil Hall is perhaps not such an obvious move. Arguments to remove Confederate names, many of which came into being decades after the civil war and were designed to reinforce segregation and Jim Crow laws, are clearer. Peter Faneuil is a bit more complicated, given the building&#39;s role in creating America and helping the abolitionist movement. “If you&#39;re not changing how the story exists,” says Noelle Trent of the Museum of African-American History in Boston &amp;amp; Nantucket, “if you&#39;re not changing people&#39;s awareness around that name-change and the conversation around it, then its impact is minimal.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;A newish exhibition in Faneuil Hall about slavery in Boston highlights individual slaves, including “Peter”, who ran away from the Faneuil family. It aspires to teach Faneuil Hall&#39;s visitors—the building welcomes 18m of them a year—about Boston&#39;s role in the slave trade, as well as about how its enslaved people lived. A portrait of Faneuil hangs in the meeting hall. Until recently, visitors would have assumed he was one of the country&#39;s founding fathers. George Washington&#39;s portrait hangs nearby. Now, there is context. Byron Rushing, a civil-rights activist and a former state representative, is reluctant to see the name change. “Eradicate it and no one will ever ask again, &#39;Who was Faneuil?&#39;”&lt;span data-ornament=&quot;ufinish&quot;>;■&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;i>;Stay on top of American politics with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.com/newsletters/checks-and-balance&quot;>;Checks and Balance&lt;/a>;, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter, which examines the state of American democracy and the issues that matter to voters.&lt;/i>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 11 Nov 2023 17:57:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[What is the American State Department’s “dissent channel”? | The Economist explains]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2023/11/09/what-is-the-american-state-departments-dissent-channel]]><description> &lt;img src=&quot;https://images.weserv.nl/?url=www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/media-assets/image/20231111_BLP512.jpg&quot;/>;&lt;div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-caps=&quot;initial&quot;>;&lt;span data-caps=&quot;initial&quot;>;A&lt;/span>;&lt;small>;MERICA&#39;S STATE DEPARTMENT&lt;/small>; has been working overtime since war between Israel and Hamas broke out in October. Antony Blinken, the secretary of state, has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/11/07/will-america-pull-the-plug-on-israels-invasion-of-gaza&quot;>;travelled&lt;/a>; twice to the Middle East to emphasise President Joe Biden&#39;s support for Israel and urge the country to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/11/07/will-america-pull-the-plug-on-israels-invasion-of-gaza&quot;>;act with restraint&lt;/a>; in its battle against Hamas. But not all American diplomats support their government&#39;s stance. Reports have emerged that State Department staff are drafting documents that criticise the Biden administration&#39;s handling of the war. Politico, a news website, reported that one letter, which is garnering signatures, demands that America support a ceasefire and publicly criticise Israel. Such a “dissent memo” is no ordinary diplomatic cable. Why was the dissent channel created, and how effective has it been in influencing policy?&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;State Department employees must, strictly speaking, execute policy whether or not they agree with it. If they don&#39;t, the highest-impact way to register their disapproval without jeopardising their jobs is to send a dissent cable, in which they express their reasons for opposing a specific policy. Under the department&#39;s rules, diplomats send such cables to the secretary of state&#39;s planning office in Washington, which must acknowledge receipt and pass them up the chain, including to the secretary. The director of policy planning is expected to reply within 30 to 60 days. Anyone in the department is supposed to be able to use the channel without fear of punishment; rules prohibit retaliation. Like most State Department records, cables are meant for internal use only.&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div>;&lt;div id=&quot;econ-1&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;The channel was created in 1971, when morale at the State Department had plummeted as a result of America&#39;s war in Vietnam. In 1968, 266 foreign-service officers resigned in protest against military operations ordered by President Lyndon Johnson, which were often secret. Richard Nixon, who succeeded Johnson in 1969, pledged to conduct the war openly and to “bring dissenters into policy discussions”. He also worried about leaks to the press of diplomatic grumblings and sensitive documents. Reformers within the State Department proposed a dissent channel as a way to placate and manage malcontents. Under Nixon the department adopted it. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The mechanism was quickly put to the test. In April 1971 Archer Blood, consul-general in East Pakistan (which became Bangladesh later that year), sent the first dissent memo. Blood warned that Pakistan&#39;s army was perpetrating genocide against Bengalis in the country, as it fought to prevent East Pakistan from seceding. His memo accused America of failing to condemn the atrocities and the perpetrators. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/2013/09/25/blood-meridian&quot;>;“Blood Telegram”&lt;/a>; had little impact, however. Nixon and his secretary of state, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/05/17/henry-kissinger-explains-how-to-avoid-world-war-three&quot;>;Henry Kissinger&lt;/a>;, saw Pakistan&#39;s leader as their conduit to China and ignored the cable. Blood&#39;s dissent became public. He was demoted. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Since then few if any dissent cables have changed policy. One from 1979, which opposed allowing the brutal &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.com/1843/2017/09/05/filming-in-the-killing-fields&quot;>;Khmer Rouge&lt;/a>; regime to represent Cambodia at the &lt;small>;UN&lt;/small>; General Assembly, persuaded the secretary of state to change course, but he was talked back around. Another, calling for signs to be posted warning Americans about the dangers of travelling on the Pan-American Highway, was acted upon. Dissent cables did not stop America from invading Iraq in 2003. In January 2017 one opposing an executive order by Donald Trump that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.com/democracy-in-america/2017/03/14/donald-trumps-new-travel-ban-faces-a-trio-of-lawsuits&quot;>;banned travel&lt;/a>; to America from seven Muslim-majority countries attracted more than 1,000 signatures. But it was court challenges, not department policy, that weakened the order. Mr Biden reversed it in 2021. &lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div>;&lt;div id=&quot;econ-2&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Hannah Gurman of New York University, the author of “The Dissent Papers”, a book, finds that leaks of cables have become more common. In August 2021 the &lt;i>;Wall Street Journal&lt;/i>; reported that staff at the American embassy in Afghanistan had, in July, sent one warning of the strength of the Taliban and the impending collapse of Kabul. A Republican-led congressional committee investigating the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.com/united-states/will-joe-biden-pay-a-political-cost-for-americas-chaotic-withdrawal-from-afghanistan/21804099&quot;>;chaotic withdrawal of American troops&lt;/a>; later subpoenaed the memo, and was eventually allowed to view it. Mr Blinken worried that the move would have a “chilling effect”. Some diplomats counter, however, that if policy change—not merely blowing off steam—is the goal, a powerful audience is helpful. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In the past few weeks, as news has trickled out about what one official called a “mutiny” at the State Department, Mr Blinken has organised “listening sessions” with employees and underscored the importance of “sustain[ing] and expand[ing] the space for dissent and debate”. He may be sincere. He may also hope, as one creator of the channel put it 50 years ago, to keep dissent “in the house”. &lt;span data-ornament=&quot;ufinish&quot;>;■&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 11 Nov 2023 17:57:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Has the West overestimated China’s military might? | Podcasts]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/podcasts/2023/11/10/has-the-west-overestimated-chinas-military-might]]><description> &lt;img src=&quot;https://images.weserv.nl/?url=www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/media-assets/image/20231111_PDP510.jpg&quot;/>;&lt;div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-caps=&quot;initial&quot;>;&lt;span data-caps=&quot;initial&quot;>;M&lt;/span>;&lt;small>;iscalculating the prowess&lt;/small>; of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.com/special-report/2023-11-11&quot; data-tegid=&quot;b1837kdg7op9iiptuq5jfsromp253oik&quot;>;People&#39;s Liberation Army&lt;/a>; is dangerous.

In Gaza he made no more than $10 a day as a labourer, when he could find the work; in Israel he could earn ten times as much on construction sites. Like many Gazans who found regular jobs in Israel, he lodged in Rahat, a Bedouin Arab city in the south of the country for several weeks at a time. “When the war began, we were worried. We didn&#39;t feel safe,” Abu Anas, who didn&#39;t want me to use his real name, told me.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;For a few days, he continued to go to work until he lost hope that the “situation would calm down”. On October 11th the Israeli government revoked all permits to enter Israel issued to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.com/1843/2023/10/23/life-in-gaza-is-a-series-of-calculations-how-much-water-do-you-really-need&quot;>;Gaza residents&lt;/a>;. It was now illegal for the 10,000 or so Gazans who found themselves in Israel to remain there. But the crossing into Gaza had been closed, so Abu Anas was stranded.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;cite>;It was now illegal for the 10,000 or so Gazans who found themselves in Israel to remain there. But the crossing into Gaza had been closed&lt;/cite>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Then his landlord asked him to leave. Under Israeli law, people can be fined or imprisoned for harbouring illegal Palestinians. Abu Anas&#39;s landlord advised him to present himself voluntarily at the police station and ask to be taken to the West Bank. When Abu Anas and a group of Gazans went to the Israeli police, about a week &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.com/1843/2023/11/05/the-biblical-archaeologist-finding-the-victims-hamas-burned&quot;>;after the war began&lt;/a>;, they were arrested. Abu Anas said their phones, belongings and clothes were taken away, they were searched and beaten, and put in a crowded cell, with no furniture or bedding, with around 40 other &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.com/1843/2023/10/27/ali-jadallah-has-lost-four-relatives-in-gaza-hes-still-taking-pictures&quot;>;Gazans&lt;/a>;. (A spokesman for the Israeli police said they couldn&#39;t comment on individual cases but said that any Gazans in the country illegally would be “lawfully arrested”.)&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div>;&lt;div id=&quot;econ-1&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;The following day, he and some other Gazans were blindfolded, handcuffed, put on buses and taken to Ofer, an Israeli military camp and prison in the West Bank, near Ramallah. According to Abu Anas, when they arrived they were pushed to the ground, beaten again and placed in a large tent with over 200 other workers from Gaza. “I met several people from the same neighbourhood as me,” he said. They were not permitted, he said, to leave their tent, but some learnt that there were several similar ones, also full of Gazan workers. No explanation was given for their detention and they had no access to lawyers or the Red Cross. &lt;/p>;&lt;figure>;&lt;span itemscope=&quot;&quot; itemProp=&quot;image&quot; itemType=&quot;https://schema.org/ImageObject&quot;>;&lt;meta itemProp=&quot;url&quot; content=&quot;https://www.economist.com/img/b/1618/1078/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231109_1843_TRAPPED_GAZA_12.jpg&quot;/>;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; width=&quot;1618&quot; height=&quot;1078&quot; src=&quot;https://www.economist.com/img/b/1618/1078/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231109_1843_TRAPPED_GAZA_12.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/133/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231109_1843_TRAPPED_GAZA_12.jpg 200w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/200/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231109_1843_TRAPPED_GAZA_12.jpg 300w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/267/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231109_1843_TRAPPED_GAZA_12.jpg 400w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/400/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231109_1843_TRAPPED_GAZA_12.jpg 600w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/426/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231109_1843_TRAPPED_GAZA_12.jpg 640w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/533/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231109_1843_TRAPPED_GAZA_12.jpg 800w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/666/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231109_1843_TRAPPED_GAZA_12.jpg 1000w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/853/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231109_1843_TRAPPED_GAZA_12.jpg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;figure>;&lt;span itemscope=&quot;&quot; itemProp=&quot;image&quot; itemType=&quot;https://schema.org/ImageObject&quot;>;&lt;meta itemProp=&quot;url&quot; content=&quot;https://www.economist.com/img/b/1773/1184/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231109_1843_TRAPPED_GAZA_03.jpg&quot;/>;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; width=&quot;1773&quot; height=&quot;1184&quot; src=&quot;https://www.economist.com/img/b/1773/1184/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231109_1843_TRAPPED_GAZA_03.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/134/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231109_1843_TRAPPED_GAZA_03.jpg 200w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/200/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231109_1843_TRAPPED_GAZA_03.jpg 300w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/267/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231109_1843_TRAPPED_GAZA_03.jpg 400w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/401/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231109_1843_TRAPPED_GAZA_03.jpg 600w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/427/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231109_1843_TRAPPED_GAZA_03.jpg 640w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/534/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231109_1843_TRAPPED_GAZA_03.jpg 800w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/668/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231109_1843_TRAPPED_GAZA_03.jpg 1000w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/855/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231109_1843_TRAPPED_GAZA_03.jpg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/>;&lt;/span>;&lt;figcaption>;&lt;b>;Stranded &lt;/b>;Gazan workers detained in Israel have been transferred to a sports complex in Ramallah in the West Bank &lt;i>;(opening image)&lt;/i>;.&lt;!-- -->; Abu Odeh, 34, had been working in Israel on a construction site (&lt;i>;top&lt;/i>;).

One of the Gazans HaMoked talked to said he had been held in a cage “like a chicken coop”, open to the elements and with no food, water, medication, bedding or toilets. A spokesman for the &lt;small>;IDF&lt;/small>; said that “no complaints were received regarding abuse and violence…Detainees were provided shelter, as well as food and water throughout the day.

They passed callused hands over their faces, chewing fingernails with their heads bent over the cracked screens of their mobile phones, as they scrolled through the terrible news from Gaza.

One newcomer told me he had been hiding for four weeks in Nazareth, a largely Arab city in the north of Israel, waiting for an opportunity to cross to the West Bank without being seized by the police. I spoke to three men who told me that they had remained in their flat in Ramle, near Tel Aviv, for more than two weeks, while friends brought them food. Even then, they were arrested by police who raided their apartment one morning in the early hours. They said they had been beaten, hooded, abused with insults in Arabic, imprisoned in Ramle for four days and dumped at the Ramallah checkpoint. I saw blisters and scabs, the hallmarks of cable ties, around the wrists of several men.

The three parties in government can now jointly muster barely 35%. The &lt;small>;CDU &lt;/small>;and its Bavarian sister party by themselves command around 30%, a respectable rise from the 24% that they actually scored in the 2021 vote. &lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;figure>;&lt;div>;&lt;figcaption>;Listen to this story.&lt;/figcaption>; &lt;span>;Enjoy more audio and podcasts on&lt;!-- -->; &lt;a id=&quot;audio-ios-cta&quot; href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttps://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/bed1b25&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;>;iOS&lt;/a>; &lt;!-- -->;or&lt;!-- -->; &lt;a id=&quot;audio-android-cta&quot; href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttps://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/7f3c199&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;>;Android&lt;/a>;.&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;audio controls=&quot;&quot; id=&quot;audio-player&quot; preload=&quot;none&quot; src=&quot;https://www.economist.com/media-assets/audio/045%20Europe%20-%20Germany_s%20Christian%20Democrats-a591d99b30cdf0472ad0f02d40714564.mp3&quot; title=&quot;Germany&#39;s Christian Democrats are unsure whom to hug&quot; controlsList=&quot;nodownload&quot;>;&lt;p>;Your browser does not support the &amp;lt;audio&amp;gt; element.&lt;/p>;&lt;/audio>;&lt;div>;&lt;div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;figure>;&lt;span itemscope=&quot;&quot; itemProp=&quot;image&quot; itemType=&quot;https://schema.org/ImageObject&quot; data-slim=&quot;1&quot;>;&lt;meta itemProp=&quot;url&quot; content=&quot;https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/739/90/media-assets/image/20231111_EUC544.png&quot;/>;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/739/90/media-assets/image/20231111_EUC544.png&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/243/90/media-assets/image/20231111_EUC544.png 200w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/365/90/media-assets/image/20231111_EUC544.png 300w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/486/90/media-assets/image/20231111_EUC544.png 400w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/729/90/media-assets/image/20231111_EUC544.png 600w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/778/90/media-assets/image/20231111_EUC544.png 640w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/972/90/media-assets/image/20231111_EUC544.png 800w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/1215/90/media-assets/image/20231111_EUC544.png 1000w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1556/90/media-assets/image/20231111_EUC544.png 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;336px&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;p>;The party has been doing well in recent local elections, too. In early October the &lt;small>;CDU &lt;/small>;romped to victory in the central state of Hesse, scoring an eight-point surge to grab 35%. In Bavaria the Christian Social Union (&lt;small>;CSU&lt;/small>;) retained the hold it has clamped on Germany&#39;s biggest state (by area) since 1957. “The majority of Germans now are voting for non-left parties,” says Jens Spahn, a &lt;small>;CDU &lt;/small>;parliamentarian and former health minister.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Yet far from being smug, the mood among mainstream conservatives is uneasy. Multiple challenges weigh down the &lt;small>;CDU&lt;/small>;. One is Mrs Merkel&#39;s legacy. The length of her dominance means that the party&#39;s successors as leaders inevitably look small by contrast; yet they remain damaged by some of her controversial policies, such as welcoming more than 1m refugees and phasing out nuclear power. A second challenge is that although the &lt;small>;CDU &lt;/small>;is Germany&#39;s strongest party it still needs coalition partners. Conservative voters know that the most likely ones are all to the left. “They say, if I vote for you we&#39;ll just get a variant of the same old thing,” says Mr Spahn.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In part because of those two challenges the &lt;small>;CDU &lt;/small>;now faces a third: a growing threat from the populist far right. Often dismissed as marginal since its founding ten years ago, the anti-immigrant, anti-elite, anti-Europe and pro-Russia Alternative for Germany (&lt;small>;A&lt;/small>;f&lt;small>;D&lt;/small>;) has profited more than the &lt;small>;CDU &lt;/small>;from disappointment with the government. Polls now suggest it is Germany&#39;s second-most-popular party, with nearly 22%. In three eastern states that will vote next year it is outpolling the &lt;small>;CDU&lt;/small>;. A seemingly pragmatic option would be a conservative alliance between the two. But most Germans, particularly in the more liberal west, view the &lt;small>;A&lt;/small>;f&lt;small>;D&lt;/small>; with horror.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;So, officially, does the &lt;small>;CDU&lt;/small>;. Hendrik Wüst, a rising star in the party who was elected last year as minister-president of North Rhine-Westphalia, the most populous state, is categorical. The &lt;small>;A&lt;/small>;f&lt;small>;D&lt;/small>; is not a democratic but a fascistic party, as ruled by the courts: “They put into question the foundations of our democracy, our freedoms, our attachment to the West, to Europe,” he says. “They are our opponent, not a potential ally.” Mr Wüst, who runs his state in coalition with the Greens, thinks the &lt;small>;CDU &lt;/small>;should stick to its own core values and centrist instincts.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;div>;&lt;div id=&quot;econ-1&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Friedrich Merz, the party&#39;s current national leader, also dismisses dealmaking with the &lt;small>;A&lt;/small>;f&lt;small>;D&lt;/small>;. But his more conservative faction of the &lt;small>;CDU &lt;/small>;has at the same time tried to steal the populist right&#39;s thunder by drumming on the same issues that appear to boost its support. The most obvious is immigration, a perpetual bugbear for the &lt;small>;A&lt;/small>;f&lt;small>;D&lt;/small>;. Given an influx last year of 1m Ukrainian refugees, a big jump in the number of asylum-seekers from elsewhere and obsessive popular-media coverage of crimes attributed to foreigners, public fears of immigration have risen markedly. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Mr Merz, a bespectacled former corporate lawyer, has helped stoke such fears, describing Ukrainian refugees as “benefit tourists”, implying that a Berlin district with many immigrants is no longer part of Germany, and dismissing the idea of accepting refugees from Gaza because “we have too many antisemites already.” Mr Spahn has also taken up the cudgels, asserting that people from “Muslim-Arab cultures” will make Germany more violent, and also suggesting that German authorities should use force to stop irregular immigration. “We need a simple recognition of the fact that &lt;i>;wir schaffen das nicht mehr&lt;/i>;,” he insists, pointedly contradicting the magnanimous declaration that “we can handle this” made by Mrs Merkel at the height of the Syrian refugee crisis of 2015.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Such rhetoric resonates with a souring public mood, underlined by recent surveys showing that immigration currently tops voter concerns. But the &lt;small>;CDU&lt;/small>;&#39;s adoption of hard-right talking points is risky, warns Julia Reuschenbach, a political scientist at the Free University of Berlin. In other European countries, centre-right parties that have similarly tried to outflank radical upstarts have in nearly every case ended up hurting themselves more. “Italy&#39;s conservatives tried to appease the far right and the result is that they no longer exist,” says Mr Reuschenbach. “In their place there are three far-right parties.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div>;&lt;div id=&quot;econ-2&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Tarik Abou-Chadi of Oxford University cites another strong example. In Bavaria&#39;s election Markus Söder, the &lt;small>;CSU&lt;/small>;&#39;s popular and long-standing leader, ran a boisterous campaign attacking the ruling coalition in Berlin, and particularly the Greens, for their allegedly bossy ways and out-of-touch idealism. This did win new votes for conservatives; but they accrued not to the &lt;small>;CSU &lt;/small>;but to the &lt;small>;A&lt;/small>;f&lt;small>;D&lt;/small>; and the Free Voters, a local populist party. Together they surged to 30%, while the &lt;small>;CSU &lt;/small>;just held steady at 37%. “The focus on culture wars simply allows and encourages the dominance of these issues in public discourse,” says Mr Abou-Chadi. “This helps to normalise the &lt;small>;A&lt;/small>;f&lt;small>;D&lt;/small>;.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Mr Reuschenbach notes that by contrast, the &lt;small>;CDU &lt;/small>;has performed strongly in recent state elections where it has emphasised competence and moderate conservative values. Mr Wüst would agree; his state is a prime example. “We can change and adapt,” he says, but only so long as this is “on the basis of our Christian values and on the attitudes of the middle class.” &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Given the nature of German politics, where it is impossible for any party to get an outright majority, and given the nature of a public that generally prefers calm assurance to stirred-up anger, the &lt;small>;CDU &lt;/small>;needs to take care not to alienate potential coalition partners with harsh rhetoric. Even if German opinion is shifting a bit to the right, the &lt;small>;CDU&lt;/small>;&#39;s only path to power is still through a deal with the left. By tilting right, Mr Merz only makes that harder. &lt;span data-ornament=&quot;ufinish&quot;>;■&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 11 Nov 2023 01:57:03 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
