Sizes=&quot;336px&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;p>;劳工改革至关重要。在洛佩斯·奥夫拉多尔上任之前，最低工资按实际价值计算多年来一直停滞不前。从那时起，他将费用增加了 90%，达到每天 207.45 比索（11.97 美元）。墨西哥学院 (Colegio de México) 大学的爱丽丝·克罗泽 (Alice Krozer) 表示，虽然只有 45% 的正式工作工人直接受益，但这一增长确实拖累了其他人的工资上涨。总统还打击了企业滥用外包的行为，以避免与员工分享利润的法律要求。当该法律于 2021 年 4 月生效时，据信参与非法计划的 290 万名工人将受益。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;洛佩斯·奥夫拉多尔先生的施舍是第二个因素。尽管直到今年他的政府的社会支出才超过他的前任，但更多的钱花在了施舍本身上。他通过削减项目数量并废除 Prospera 来实现这一目标。Prospera 是一项备受赞誉的现金转移计划，该计划以儿童上学和医疗预约为条件，因此管理成本高昂。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;这为农村人口植树和年轻人学徒（他的标志性项目）留下了更多的钱。他还领取了 4,800 比索的全民养老金，每两个月支付一次。随着洛佩斯·奥夫拉多尔先生在选举年增加支出，这一数字从 1 月份开始上涨至 6,000 比索。总而言之，新安排惠及的人数较少，但收到的人平均获得的现金是以前计划的两倍。 &lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;div>;&lt;div id=&quot;econ-1&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;figure>;&lt;span itemscope=&quot;&quot;

Sizes=&quot;336px&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;p>;与洛佩斯·奥夫拉多尔先生一样，也有另一面。在他任内，极端贫困现象日益严重。尽管最弱势群体的收入有所增加，但他们获得医疗保健的机会却减少了。洛佩斯·奥夫拉多尔先生没有兑现他的竞选承诺，即建立一个全民医疗保健系统来取代目前正式的就业相关计划。但他仍然废除了针对没有正式工作的人的保险计划“Seguro Pop”，这伤害了最贫穷的人。这使得 39% 的人口（约 5000 万人）无法获得医疗保健，这一比例高于 2018 年的 16%。克罗泽女士表示，癌症等疾病的治疗费用使许多墨西哥人陷入贫困，或阻止他们摆脱贫困。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;虽然更有效地分配资金确实让墨西哥总统总体上发放了更多现金，但这也意味着受救济金覆盖的最贫困家庭的数量有所下降。经济学家、前总统顾问赫拉尔多·埃斯基维尔表示，洛佩斯·奥夫拉多尔本可以通过使用 Prospera 的数据来确定他的施舍目标，从而避免这种情况。相反，他起草了一份自己的清单，该清单与他的政治目标一致。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;2024年贫困率可能会再次下降。经济正在复苏，救济金也有所增加。但洛佩斯·奥夫拉多尔先生的工具已经达到了极限。最低工资不可能以目前的速度继续上涨。社会项目已经难以负担。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;无论如何，这些施舍只是一块&lt;i>;curita&lt;/i>;，一种膏药，&lt;小>;非政府组织 Juventudes Manos en Acción 的曼努埃尔·拉米雷斯 (Manuel Ramírez) 说。 >; 总部位于墨西哥最贫穷的州恰帕斯州。来自恰帕斯州的 48 岁坎德拉里亚·洛佩斯·戈麦斯 (Candelaria López Gómez) 表示，她希望政府铺路并用管道输送饮用水，这样她就不必购买瓶装饮用水。还需要更多、更优质的健康和教育服务。&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;洛佩斯·奥夫拉多尔先生的可能继任者克劳迪娅·谢因鲍姆将不得不提高税收来支付不断增加的施舍成本（尽管她声称她不会这样做）。更重要的是，她的政府需要加快墨西哥的经济增长。过去 40 年来，&lt;small>;GDP&lt;/small>;平均每年增长 2%，微不足道。下一任总统也应该结束施舍的依附性质，洛佩斯·奥夫拉多尔先生的受欢迎程度很大程度上取决于这种施舍。&lt;span data-ornament=&quot;ufinish&quot;>;■&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 17 Nov 2023 15:57:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[If Labour is to succeed in power, it must fix the Treasury | Leaders]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/11/16/if-labour-is-to-succeed-in-power-it-must-fix-the-treasury]]><description> &lt;img src=&quot;https://images.weserv.nl/?url=www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/media-assets/image/20231118_LDD003.jpg&quot;/>;&lt;div>;&lt;

&lt;/p>;&lt;/audio>;&lt;div>;&lt;div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;工党也有自己的分歧，最明显的是加沙战争。但面对保守党持续的骚乱，它把自己定位为稳定的化身。民意调查领先20多个百分点，明年可能举行大选；其领导人凯尔·斯塔默爵士和影子财政大臣雷切尔·里夫斯承诺重建英国。然而，那些希望拥有重大授权的新政府足以解决英国问题的人是错误的。这个国家的萎靡不振比执政者还要严重。自 2008 年以来，生产率仅微弱增长了 1.7%；在过去的 16 年里，它增长了 27%。国家机构的运作方式也存在问题。这些都没有比财政部更强大的。 &lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div>;&lt;div id=&quot;econ-1&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;在大多数国家，财政部的权力受到限制。美国有一个单独的预算办公室。德国设有负​​责长期增长的经济事务部和强大的地区州。在英国，财政部具有至高无上的地位。它的 2,000 多名官员对每年 1 万亿英镑（1.2 万亿美元）公共支出的大部分进行了非凡程度的控制。它全权负责制定税收。它兼任经济部。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;没有人怀疑财政部的能力。它的力量吸引了白厅最聪明的头脑。许多攻击它的人只是希望增加支出，或者对不断膨胀的债务过于乐观。去年担任总理七周的利兹·特拉斯(Liz Truss)抨击其失败的“财政部正统观念”，因为它怀疑她通过无资金减税来释放增长的计划。她首相任期的失败证明了财政部严谨的价值。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;但财政部的权力过大，意味着它的缺陷会以特殊的力量向外扩散。这些缺陷是有意义的&lt;/a>;。该部门加剧并体现了英国根深蒂固的问题。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;其一，它本身就是短期主义的牺牲品，苏纳克先生和基尔爵士都说这种短期主义困扰着英国。部长们最终做出决定。但财政部有一种节俭的文化，这种文化可以追溯到维多利亚时代的政治家威廉·格莱斯顿(William Gladstone)，他在担任财政大臣时以“节约烛光”而闻名。强大的财务部门的工作方式是专注于控制短期支出，即使这意味着压制长期有意义的项目。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;国家医疗服务体系 (&lt;small>;NHS&lt;/small>;) 的困境部分是数十年来资本投资不足的结果。英国的医院摇摇欲坠，在发达经济体&lt;small>;OECD&lt;/small>;中，人均&lt;small>;CT&lt;/small>;扫描仪和&lt;small>;MRI&lt;/small>;设备数量排名第五。然而，财政部却允许从&lt;small>;NHS&lt;/small>;资本预算中挪用数十亿美元来填补日常支出缺口。其评估拟议支出的“绿皮书”流程导致了对变革性项目的偏见。财政部官员认为伦敦周围的&lt;small>;M&lt;/small>;25高速公路应该有两车道宽，并且反对延长伦敦地铁的银禧线。部长们是否决他们的人。这两项升级被认为物有所值。许多其他项目，尤其是东南部以外的项目，都毫无进展。 &lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div>;&lt;div id=&quot;econ-2&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;另一个有启发性的问题是，财政部对英国微不足道的经济状况并没有足够的担心。经济增长率。造成这种情况的罪魁祸首有很多，从英国脱欧到计划混乱。但财政部应该是激发行动的部门。相反，内部人士表示，晋升的途径是证明你可以消除支出竞标。当利率较低时，财政部放弃了增加投资的机会。每年两次的财政事件——亨特先生将于 11 月 22 日发表下一份秋季声明——会鼓励摆弄行为并播下不确定性。资本免税额是企业税收的一个组成部分，在过去四十年中平均每隔一年就会发生变化。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;如果没有第三个失败：该部门是一个事无巨细的管理者，短期主义和忽视增长就不那么重要了。英国是高度集权的，财政部是超级集权者。其他政府部门和地方议会必须克服重重困难才能表明他们将如何花费微不足道的资金。今年二月，升级部门被禁止未经批准决定任何新的基本建设项目。三分之一的财政部官员年龄在 30 岁以下；聪明的财政部毕业生最终告诉从陆军将军到科学家的每个人如何做好自己的工作。其他国家的财政部避免了这种巨大权力和幼稚的结合。 &lt;/p>;&lt;h2>;检查国库&lt;/h2>;&lt;p>;一些人认为答案是拆分财政部。那将是一个错误。这将是昂贵且具有破坏性的。哈罗德·威尔逊 (Harold Wilson) 的一次失败尝试表明，分手可能不会持续下去。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;相反，财政部需要改革。如果总理接受对其权力的限制，短期主义就会减少。对重要基础设施项目的重大修改应该需要议会的批准。资本预算应固定为五年，税收变化最多每年一次。财政部对钱袋的控制应该放松。一旦预算和目标确定，其他政府部门应该有更多的资金使用空间。城市的财政自由度有限：它们应该有更多。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;最困难的是，财政部的文化需要适应。它对严格支出的承诺至关重要，而且在危机中常常表现出灵活的思维。但这还不够。凯尔爵士和里夫斯女士表示，加速增长将是他们的首要任务。到目前为止，他们对可能阻碍他们的部门几乎没有说什么。这必须改变。 &lt;span data-ornament=&quot;ufinish&quot;>;■&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;i>;有关英国人投票意向的更多信息，请参阅我们的&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.com/ Interactive/uk-general-election/polls&quot;>;民意调查跟踪器，&lt;/a>;每日更新。&lt;/i>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href= &quot;https://feedx.net&quot;

尺寸 = &quot;336px&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;p>;该团伙于 2011 年成立，当时政府将监狱的​​治安交给囚犯以换取减少暴力。格雷罗先生接管了托科隆。他的第一个收入来源是一项名为“la causa”的税收，每月向每个囚犯收取“津贴”。获释后，该团伙成员开始在商店敲诈勒索并劫持汽车。到 2018 年，特伦·德阿拉瓜已经控制了与哥伦比亚边境的非法过境点。随着每天有成千上万的委内瑞拉人离开自己的国家，该团伙找到了新的生意。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;起初，它只是向走私者收取费用，以便将他们的人口货物运出委内瑞拉。但当 2020 年疫情导致边境关闭、费用飙升时，特伦·德阿拉瓜看到了机会。该团伙建立了自己的走私活动，租用巴士、提供食物和预订住宿。几个月内，他们收购了自己的运输公司和旅馆，并很快提供多程、多国包裹。几美元就可以步行进入哥伦比亚。只要花 500 美元，你就可以开车穿越非洲大陆到达智利。为了实现这一切，该团伙开始占领边境城镇并贿赂当地官员。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;控制权使该团伙进入了一个新的、更有利可图的行业：人口贩运。作为客户，移民只需支付一次费用，而且所获得的服务费用高昂，利润微薄。作为受害者，他们可能会被无限期地剥削。意识到这一点后，该团伙蔓延到城市并野蛮地垄断了性交易。他们谋杀了当地的皮条客和任何拒绝为他们工作的性工作者，将肢解的尸体扔在街角，并在社交媒体上传播杀戮视频。潜在的移民成为新的被迫卖淫的群体。数以千计的委内瑞拉年轻妇女被贩卖到波哥大、利马和圣地亚哥。大多数人都被承诺在国外工作。其他人则被网上认识的“男朋友”欺骗。抵达后，这些妇女被告知她们欠该团伙钱，并被迫在妓院和网络摄像头网站上工作。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;订单直接来自托科隆，格雷罗先生在那里像跨国公司一样经营着 Tren de Aragua。他通过控制移民的招募、运输和性剥削进行垂直整合。他派遣管理人员负责海外业务，并在警方发现情况后将他们轮流到新的国家。今年出版了一本关于特伦·德·阿拉瓜的书的罗娜·里斯克斯 (Ronna Rísquez) 说，这些副手也同样有进取心。在玻利维亚，他们通过强迫移民走私毒品来追求效率。在巴西，他们与该国最大的帮派 First Capital Command 建立了合作伙伴关系。&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;div>;&lt;div id=&quot;econ-1&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/ div>;&lt;p>;邻居的暴徒们印象深刻。许多人加入了特伦·德阿拉瓜，开启了从高利贷到电话诈骗等更加多样化的犯罪活动。里斯克斯女士表示，通过他们，特伦·德·阿拉瓜的成员已扩大到 5,000 名，使其成为当今南美洲最大的犯罪组织之一。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;军队入侵托科隆的原因尚不清楚。特伦·德·阿拉瓜多年来一直胡作非为。该团伙可能让委内瑞拉独裁者尼古拉斯·马杜罗感到尴尬，导致与邻国的关系恶化。与美国就取消制裁进行谈判可能是采取炫耀性镇压的合理诱因之一。在过去的两个月里，政府已经夺回了另外六座由犯罪分子控制的监狱，所有监狱都没有发生流血事件。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;委内瑞拉监狱观察站的温贝托·普拉多 (Humberto Prado) 表示，对托科隆的袭击很可能是预先商定的。 &lt;小>;非政府组织&lt;/小>;。 “我们统计了 3,000 名囚犯。他们说他们找到了 1,500 个。那么另外 1,500 个人在哪里呢？”他问道。突袭期间没有发生枪击事件，只有一人（意外）死亡。囚犯们说格雷罗先生和他的手下几天前就搬走了。他们的下落是个谜。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;格雷罗先生正在受到南美各国政府的追捕，担心他藏身在他们的国家。无论身在何处，帮派头目都必须迅速多元化。特伦·德阿拉瓜的扩张之所以成为可能，是因为拉丁美洲历史上最大规模的委内瑞拉人外逃。现在四分之一的人口已经离开，只剩下一小部分移民可供该团伙掠夺。仍在流动的人大多前往美国，超出了该团伙的网络范围。如果格雷罗先生想要在泛大陆镇压中失去监狱总部后幸存下来，他的犯罪行为很可能不会那么引人注目。&lt;span data-ornament=&quot;ufinish&quot;>;■&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;

Arguing that the exams stifled innovation in ancient times, Professor Huang sees lessons for Xi Jinping&#39;s China.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The &lt;i>;keju &lt;/i>;became more doctrinaire over time. First instituted in 587, the exams progressively shed such subjects as mathematics and astronomy. Soon, they only tested candidates&#39; mastery of dense Confucian texts filled with injunctions to revere fathers, officials and monarchs. The curriculum narrowed again in the 14th century, requiring candidates to memorise ultra-conservative commentaries on Confucian classics. The commentaries advocated unquestioning obedience towards rulers. A final refinement was added during the Ming dynasty: answers had to follow a rigidly scripted format, the “eight-legged essay”, described as “the greatest destroyer of human talent” by Ch&#39;ien Mu, a historian.&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div>;&lt;div id=&quot;econ-1&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;The system was a blessing and a curse, the book suggests. At a time when Europeans were recommended for public office by well-connected relations or patrons, the &lt;i>;keju &lt;/i>;offered diligent commoners a path to advancement (women could not take the exams). Most tests were taken anonymously, enhancing public confidence in them. Corrupt examiners, when unmasked, faced execution or exile. By the time of the Ming dynasty (1368-1644), qualifying tests for the &lt;i>;keju &lt;/i>;attracted millions of candidates, helping to explain high levels of (male) literacy. With such a large pool of aspiring scholar-officials, serving mandarins knew that they were replaceable, and thus vulnerable. Few dared to start palace coups.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Yet stability came at a cost, argues Professor Huang. Gui Youguang stands out for doggedness. But a dataset of 11,706 Ming-era &lt;i>;keju &lt;/i>;candidates shows that exam-takers who reached the third and final stage of the &lt;i>;keju &lt;/i>;got there&lt;!-- -->; in middle age, on average. Millions sat the exams and never passed. This focus on bureaucratic glory crowded out other paths to social mobility. It was handy for autocrats, as test preparation left scholars “no time for rebellious ideas or deeds”, the book argues. The &lt;i>;keju&lt;/i>;&#39;s Confucian values promoted conformity of thought and disdain for commerce. Over time, the exams smothered the scientific curiosity that saw ancient China develop many technologies before the West, including the compass, gunpowder, movable-type printing and paper, known in China as the country&#39;s “four great inventions”.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The &lt;i>;keju &lt;/i>;was scrapped in 1905, but its legacy&lt;!-- -->; lives on today, in civil-service tests and in the fearsome &lt;i>;gaokao&lt;/i>;, the college-entrance examination which rewards relentless toil. In the book&#39;s telling, the curse of the &lt;i>;keju &lt;/i>;spirit was broken once in China&#39;s history, when Communist Party leaders embraced market-based reforms after the disasters of Maoism and central planning (and revived the &lt;i>;gaokao&lt;/i>;, abandoned during the Cultural Revolution). During that reform era, lasting for 40 years after 1978, the book credits the party with successfully balancing stability, economic growth and technological progress. As in imperial times, a strong state overshadowed a weak society. But the reform-era party also praised private entrepreneurs and allowed policy experiments by regional governments. To harness the world&#39;s dynamism, officials sought out foreign capital and international academic exchanges.&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div>;&lt;div id=&quot;econ-2&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Then, in 2018, Mr Xi abolished the only term limits that constrained him as leader. His China is increasingly autocratic, statist and inward-looking. Private businesses endure more meddling by party cadres, and youth unemployment is high. In a flight to safety, almost 2.6m people applied to sit civil-service exams this year, chasing 37,100 posts. Too often, in public institutions that once boasted of being meritocratic, “merit” means fealty to one man. Officials and university students must devote ever more hours to studying Xi Jinping Thought and other dogma. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Outsiders wonder how ordinary Chinese can bear this more controlling age. One answer is that, to some at least, equality of opportunity matters more than the pursuit of diverse, individual dreams. A good place to hear such views is the Imperial Examination Museum of China in the eastern city of Nanjing. Its white-walled, grey-roofed courtyards are surrounded by statues of prize-winning test-takers from history. Civil-service exams are China&#39;s “fifth great invention”, signs declare. On this site in imperial times, 20,000 candidates took exams alone in tiny brick cells.&lt;/p>;&lt;h2>;Suffering can be endured, but not unfairness&lt;/h2>;&lt;p>;Chaguan met Ms Xing, a medical student, praying at the God of Examinations pavilion in the museum grounds. Yes, China teaches to the test and maybe that limits innovation, she ventured. But China is unequal, with very rich and very poor regions. In such a country, collective interests trump the “personal development” that is important to foreigners, she suggested. “Just as in ancient times, people are equal when they are in the same exam.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Inside the museum a young doctor, Ms Wang, pointed at a rowdy school group. In Western countries teachers can foster individual creativity, she said. “We have to stick to the tests, and we have no way to do tailored education.” The poor, including her former classmates from rural Henan, can change their destinies only with books and exams, she says. The party knows to take that sort of stubborn, unflashy ambition seriously. Bold talk of delivering a prosperous, high-tech China for all may have to wait, as the economy slows. But in these hard times, guaranteeing a fair shot for the diligent is one promise that rulers can ill afford to break. &lt;span data-ornament=&quot;ufinish&quot;>;■&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;b>;Read more from Chaguan, our columnist on China:&lt;/b>;&lt;br/>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.com/china/2023/11/09/a-chinese-dispute-with-the-philippines-is-a-test-of-america&quot;>;A Chinese dispute with the Philippines is a test of America&lt;/a>; (Nov 9th)&lt;br/>;&lt;i>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.com/china/2023/11/02/why-chinese-mourn-li-keqiang&quot; data-tegid=&quot;abmje42kt2ibiogus2updqnpva8dnn64&quot;>;Why Chinese mourn Li Keqiang, their former prime minister&lt;/a>; (Nov 2nd)&lt;/i>;&lt;br/>;&lt;i>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.com/china/2023/10/26/how-china-sees-gaza&quot;>;How China sees Gaza&lt;/a>; (Oct 26th)&lt;/i>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;i>;Also: How the Chaguan column &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.com/column-names&quot;>;got its name&lt;/a>;&lt;/i>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 17 Nov 2023 12:27:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[The Dutch farmers revolt | 1843 magazine]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/1843/2023/11/16/the-dutch-farmers-revolt]]><description> &lt;img src=&quot;https://images.weserv.nl/?url=www.economist.com/img/b/1446/813/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231116_1843_DUTCH_FARM_TEASER.jpg&quot;/>;&lt;div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-caps=&quot;initial&quot;>;&lt;span data-caps=&quot;initial&quot;>;T&lt;/span>;he farmers revolted on October 1st 2019. That day, a 15-year-old schoolboy named Björn Schütte was sitting in front of the &lt;small>;TV&lt;/small>; at his home in Emmen, a small town in the Dutch countryside. He watched in amazement as hundreds of tractors rolled into The Hague, ploughing over fences and snarling traffic for miles around. Enraged by government plans to cut the amount of livestock in the country in half and shut down big farms to get nitrogen emissions in line with European Union regulations, the protesters displayed banners reading “Proud to be a farmer”, “No farmers, no food”, and “Make our agriculture great again”. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Growing up in the agricultural heartland of the Netherlands, Schütte had known a lot of farmers. His grandparents had run &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/03/23/the-cucumber-saudis-how-the-dutch-got-too-good-at-farming&quot;>;a dairy farm&lt;/a>;, and many of his schoolmates&#39; parents were also in the profession. He appreciated their industrious, no-nonsense attitude to life. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Supporting farmers used to be a priority for the Dutch government. Through decades of intensive cultivation – encouraged by politicians and backed by generous loans – farmers had transformed the Netherlands into an agricultural powerhouse. It is now the world&#39;s second-biggest food exporter, a point of national pride. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;cite>;Through decades of intensive cultivation farmers had transformed the Netherlands into an agricultural powerhouse. It is now the world&#39;s second-biggest food exporter&lt;/cite>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;As Schütte was growing up, however, concerns about the levels of nitrogen produced by farming were moving up the political agenda. In 2019 the Dutch Supreme Court ordered a drastic reduction in nitrogen emissions. It seemed to people like Schütte that the farmers were being pushed aside. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In the days that followed, farmers continued to block roads throughout the country. In one town, protestors stormed a provincial council building and pelted police officers with straw. Public officials received threats of violence.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The demonstrations seemed to tap into a wellspring of agrarian discontent across the continent. Copycat protests broke out in Berlin, Brussels and Milan. Donald Trump lauded the Dutch farmers for standing up to “climate tyranny”. &lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div>;&lt;div id=&quot;econ-1&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Soon after &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.com/europe/2019/10/26/a-tiny-environmental-group-wins-a-huge-victory&quot;>;the farmers took to the streets&lt;/a>; a new political party was founded to channel their anger: The BoerBurgerBeweging (Farmer-Citizen Movement). More simply known as the &lt;small>;BBB&lt;/small>;, it described itself as “the voice of and for the countryside”. Its members called for an end to caps on nitrogen emissions, as well as improvements to rural transport, more house building and the establishment of a Ministry of Rural Affairs to be based outside The Hague, the seat of the Dutch government. In national elections in March 2021, the &lt;small>;BBB&lt;/small>; won a seat in parliament, bringing their perspective – and anger – to the national stage. &lt;/p>;&lt;figure>;&lt;span itemscope=&quot;&quot; itemProp=&quot;image&quot; itemType=&quot;https://schema.org/ImageObject&quot;>;&lt;meta itemProp=&quot;url&quot; content=&quot;https://www.economist.com/img/b/1034/1035/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231116_1843_DUTCH_FARM_04.jpg&quot;/>;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; width=&quot;1034&quot; height=&quot;1035&quot; src=&quot;https://www.economist.com/img/b/1034/1035/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231116_1843_DUTCH_FARM_04.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/200/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231116_1843_DUTCH_FARM_04.jpg 200w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/300/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231116_1843_DUTCH_FARM_04.jpg 300w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/400/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231116_1843_DUTCH_FARM_04.jpg 400w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/601/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231116_1843_DUTCH_FARM_04.jpg 600w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/641/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231116_1843_DUTCH_FARM_04.jpg 640w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/801/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231116_1843_DUTCH_FARM_04.jpg 800w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/1001/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231116_1843_DUTCH_FARM_04.jpg 1000w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1281/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231116_1843_DUTCH_FARM_04.jpg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;p>;Schütte had been one of the earliest members of the &lt;small>;BBB&lt;/small>;. Soon after he joined, the party sent him an email, looking for candidates to stand in local elections in early 2023. He applied to stand in Drenthe, his province, and, to his surprise, the party said yes. At the time, he wasn&#39;t even old enough to vote. But he waged a spirited campaign, distributing flyers while working as a pizza-delivery boy and hanging a massive banner over the main stairway at his school (teachers made him take it down). &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Before the election nobody thought the &lt;small>;BBB&lt;/small>; would grab more than a few of the 43 council seats in Schütte&#39;s province. Instead, they won over a third, more than the next six parties combined. Schütte, now 19, found himself a sitting member of the provincial council. Similar results played out all over the Netherlands. The &lt;small>;BBB&lt;/small>; became the biggest party in every one of the country&#39;s 12 provinces. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Despite these successes, the &lt;small>;BBB&lt;/small>; has yet to prove itself as a political force on a national level. This July, however, the centre-right government collapsed over an immigration debate. On November 22nd snap elections will be held, pitting the &lt;small>;BBB&lt;/small>; and an array of other right-leaning parties against a left-wing coalition led by Frans Timmermans, a former &lt;small>;EU&lt;/small>; climate tsar. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;cite>;The demonstrations seemed to tap into a wellspring of agrarian discontent across Europe. Copycat protests broke out in Berlin, Brussels and Milan&lt;/cite>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The &lt;small>;BBB&lt;/small>;&#39;s electoral fortunes will provide one answer to an increasingly important question: how can Europe manage the green transition without provoking a populist backlash? &lt;/p>;&lt;p data-caps=&quot;initial&quot;>;&lt;span data-caps=&quot;initial&quot;>;I&lt;/span>;n August I got the train to Deventer, a town of red-brick Hanseatic-era buildings and cobbled streets in central Netherlands. I was there to meet Caroline van der Plas, the party&#39;s leader and the holder of its first seat in parliament.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Like many of the &lt;small>;BBB&lt;/small>;&#39;s politicians, Van der Plas, 56, is not a farmer herself, though she has long been involved with the Netherlands&#39; agriculture sector. She began her career as a journalist covering the meat industry for a trade magazine, then moved into public-relations work on behalf of a variety of agricultural organisations, including the Dutch Association of Pig Producers, giving her a keen sense of the frustration that farmers felt as a consequence of the country&#39;s environmental policies. Growing convinced that farmers would be better off founding their own party, she teamed up with two other agricultural marketing professionals, and founded the BBB in 2019.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;She had an eye for spectacle: on her first day in parliament, she rode in on a tractor. The Dutch media took to her immediately, and her bright-green nail polish soon became a familiar sight on &lt;small>;TV&lt;/small>; news programmes. She pulled at heartstrings with tales of farmers&#39; woe and talked movingly about losing her husband to cancer.&lt;/p>;&lt;figure>;&lt;span itemscope=&quot;&quot; itemProp=&quot;image&quot; itemType=&quot;https://schema.org/ImageObject&quot;>;&lt;meta itemProp=&quot;url&quot; content=&quot;https://www.economist.com/img/b/983/983/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231116_1843_DUTCH_FARM_06.jpg&quot;/>;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; width=&quot;983&quot; height=&quot;983&quot; src=&quot;https://www.economist.com/img/b/983/983/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231116_1843_DUTCH_FARM_06.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/200/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231116_1843_DUTCH_FARM_06.jpg 200w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/300/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231116_1843_DUTCH_FARM_06.jpg 300w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/400/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231116_1843_DUTCH_FARM_06.jpg 400w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/600/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231116_1843_DUTCH_FARM_06.jpg 600w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/640/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231116_1843_DUTCH_FARM_06.jpg 640w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/800/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231116_1843_DUTCH_FARM_06.jpg 800w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/1000/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231116_1843_DUTCH_FARM_06.jpg 1000w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1280/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231116_1843_DUTCH_FARM_06.jpg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;p>;The &lt;small>;BBB&lt;/small>;&#39;s offices are located a 20-minute bicycle ride out of town, above a suburban veterinary clinic. A smiling cardboard cut-out of Van der Plas stands near the door, along with a colourful cow statue, and an old milk churn converted into a donation box. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Van der Plas greeted me warmly. She was eager to correct the popular perception of the &lt;small>;BBB&lt;/small>; as a party that only cared about – and appealed to – farmers. “We&#39;re a broad political party,” she said. “But the only time journalists call me is when it&#39;s about farmers. So you get the image of a farmers&#39; party. I don&#39;t want to blame the media for that, but…”&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div>;&lt;div id=&quot;econ-2&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;I pointed out that “farmer” was in their name.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“Yes, but the word &#39;citizen&#39; is also in the name,” she said. Farms do not operate in isolation, she told me. They employ drivers, butchers, builders, electricians and plumbers. Floats for Carnival, a festival in the country&#39;s south and east, are often built in barns. “The way we always put it is that every farmer keeps 12 people at work,” Van der Plas said. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The &lt;small>;BBB&lt;/small>;&#39;s concerns about cultural traditions and rural identity are shared with those further to the right. So far, though, the &lt;small>;BBB&lt;/small>; has eschewed the nativism and Euroscepticism of Party for Freedom, the stridently anti-Islam party led by Geert Wilders, and the even more extreme Forum for Democracy. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;cite>;How can European policymakers manage the green transition without provoking a populist backlash? &lt;/cite>; &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I asked Van der Plas whether she might be willing to enter into a coalition with such far-right parties to advance the &lt;small>;BBB&lt;/small>;&#39;s interests. Although she said she disagreed with them on subjects such as freedom of religion, she wouldn&#39;t rule out working with anyone. By ignoring their supporters, she said, “You&#39;re telling those voters, &#39;Your vote is worth nothing to us&#39;”.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;As Van der Plas showed me to the door, I looked out of the window at the farm next door and asked if the owner was a &lt;small>;BBB&lt;/small>; supporter. “Probably,” she said, and laughed. I cycled over to the main barn and called to see if anyone was there. A man who looked to be in his 60s emerged, wearing mud-splattered overalls. I asked him whether he intended to vote for Van der Plas. Yes, he said. “We need her.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-caps=&quot;initial&quot;>;&lt;span data-caps=&quot;initial&quot;>;E&lt;/span>;arlier this autumn I met Schütte at the provincial council building in Drenthe. He said he was enjoying his new role, and told me about the coalition the &lt;small>;BBB&lt;/small>; had agreed to with the main centre-right and centre-left parties. “That was very fun, to be involved in the part you normally only see on &lt;small>;TV&lt;/small>;,” he said.&lt;/p>;&lt;figure>;&lt;span itemscope=&quot;&quot; itemProp=&quot;image&quot; itemType=&quot;https://schema.org/ImageObject&quot;>;&lt;meta itemProp=&quot;url&quot; content=&quot;https://www.economist.com/img/b/981/981/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231116_1843_DUTCH_FARM_07.jpg&quot;/>;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; width=&quot;981&quot; height=&quot;981&quot; src=&quot;https://www.economist.com/img/b/981/981/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231116_1843_DUTCH_FARM_07.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/200/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231116_1843_DUTCH_FARM_07.jpg 200w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/300/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231116_1843_DUTCH_FARM_07.jpg 300w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/400/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231116_1843_DUTCH_FARM_07.jpg 400w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/600/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231116_1843_DUTCH_FARM_07.jpg 600w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/640/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231116_1843_DUTCH_FARM_07.jpg 640w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/800/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231116_1843_DUTCH_FARM_07.jpg 800w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/1000/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231116_1843_DUTCH_FARM_07.jpg 1000w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1280/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231116_1843_DUTCH_FARM_07.jpg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;p>;Despite Schütte&#39;s enthusiasm, the party&#39;s attempts at governing have yielded mixed results. Four years after it was established, the &lt;small>;BBB&lt;/small>; had managed to form governing coalitions in ten out of 12 provinces. In each one, the coalition agreements refused to commit to a reduction in nitrogen emissions by the deadline of 2030 – the government has now dropped this goal because of the opposition. But critics have alleged that the party has made too many concessions, a failing some have attributed to its inexperienced politicians.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Although Van der Plas had been at pains to stress that the &lt;small>;BBB&lt;/small>; was a party for everyone, critics say it&#39;s still not clear what it actually stands for, beyond support for farmers. Its policies are a jumble of left-wing and right-wing ideas: refugee quotas, the expansion of nuclear power, a minimum-wage increase and higher taxes on the very rich. And many members skirt close to conspiratorialism about vaccines and climate change. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Schütte took me to the hall of the council building to watch the day&#39;s proceedings. Several dozen representatives sat debating the funding of traditional festivities. Jur Faber, an avuncular man with a white moustache and reading glasses, who represented the left-wing Party for the Animals, which campaigns for animal rights, had the floor. “It&#39;s my view that not all traditions should be preserved,” he said. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;cite>;“We&#39;re a broad political party, but the only time journalists call me is when it&#39;s about farmers. So you get the image of a farmers&#39; party. I don&#39;t want to blame the media for that, but…”&lt;/cite>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;One of Schütte&#39;s colleagues in the &lt;small>;BBB&lt;/small>;, a stout balding man with round glasses named Gert Veltrop, seemed to take issue with this. “Does that include Easter bonfires and carbide shooting?”他问。 On New Year&#39;s Eve, some people in the rural Netherlands stuff calcium carbide – a chemical compound used in steelmaking and carbide lamps – into a milk churn and ignite it, firing footballs and other projectiles into the air. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Faber weighed in on the much-loved but dangerous tradition. “Carbide shooting is actually a tradition that comes from chasing away evil spirits. I have the impression that more and more evil spirits are coming into the world, and so it doesn&#39;t seem to have actually helped us.” &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;A lively debate followed. A young member of the Green party asked the &lt;small>;BBB&lt;/small>; representative if he might be willing to consider “evolving” new, less harmful holiday traditions. Chris Truong, an equally youthful member of a far-right party, took the &lt;small>;BBB&lt;/small>;&#39;s side against the modernisers. “Archery was started by medieval kings to keep a standing army. Should we ban archery, too?”&lt;/p>;&lt;figure>;&lt;span itemscope=&quot;&quot; itemProp=&quot;image&quot; itemType=&quot;https://schema.org/ImageObject&quot;>;&lt;meta itemProp=&quot;url&quot; content=&quot;https://www.economist.com/img/b/1034/1034/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231116_1843_DUTCH_FARM_03.jpg&quot;/>;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; width=&quot;1034&quot; height=&quot;1034&quot; src=&quot;https://www.economist.com/img/b/1034/1034/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231116_1843_DUTCH_FARM_03.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/200/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231116_1843_DUTCH_FARM_03.jpg 200w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/300/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231116_1843_DUTCH_FARM_03.jpg 300w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/400/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231116_1843_DUTCH_FARM_03.jpg 400w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/600/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231116_1843_DUTCH_FARM_03.jpg 600w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/640/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231116_1843_DUTCH_FARM_03.jpg 640w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/800/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231116_1843_DUTCH_FARM_03.jpg 800w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/1000/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231116_1843_DUTCH_FARM_03.jpg 1000w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1280/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231116_1843_DUTCH_FARM_03.jpg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;p>;The &lt;small>;BBB&lt;/small>; has capitalised on debates like this, which are intensely local in nature and less abstract than things like carbon emission or geopolitics. Afterwards I caught up with Schütte&#39;s colleague, Veltrop. He too was not a farmer, but worked in a nursing home in Emmen, Schütte&#39;s hometown. He seemed irked by the debate.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“You don&#39;t make traditions. They already exist,” he said. This sort of thinking was the reason people turned to the &lt;small>;BBB&lt;/small>;, he said. “The other parties mostly only have climate effects and everything around pollution in mind,” he said. “They completely forgot the human part.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;By successfully stoking anti-establishment grievances, the &lt;small>;BBB&lt;/small>;&#39;s success has inspired copycats. The New Social Contract (&lt;small>;NSC&lt;/small>;) is a recently established centre-right party that campaigns on rural issues and attracts many of the same voters as the &lt;small>;BBB&lt;/small>;. Since the &lt;small>;NSC&lt;/small>;&#39;s formation in August, the &lt;small>;BBB&lt;/small>; has dropped from the top of the polls to a distant fourth or fifth, threatening to leave it exactly where it wanted to avoid ending up – as a party just for farmers. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;cite>;The debates around what we should give up to live in a less environmentally destructive way will become only more volatile as global warming gets worse&lt;/cite>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;But the dynamics that fuelled the &lt;small>;BBB&lt;/small>;&#39;s shock victory in March are not going away, whether or not it is Van der Plas and her party that reap the votes. The debates around what we should give up to live in a less environmentally destructive way will become only more volatile as global warming gets worse. Migrants will not stop moving and cities will not stop growing. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Schütte has watched many of his friends and acquaintances leave their small town for life in one of the big cities. With each departure, he feels like his own community is a little closer to collapsing. “To have them disappear, the character of the Netherlands disappears. That&#39;s what makes us different as a country from other countries. I mean, if you stretch this out on a longer timeline, if the current trend continues, in a hundred years the Netherlands will just be one big metropolitan area.” Schütte paused. “And that would be a disaster, if you ask me.” ■ &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;b>;Alex Dziadosz&lt;/b>; is a writer based in Berlin&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;small>;IMAGES: Getty&lt;/small>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 17 Nov 2023 12:27:03 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Could newborn neurons reverse Alzheimer’s? | Science & technology]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2023/11/15/some-scientists-think-newborn-neurons-could-reverse-alzheimers]]><description> &lt;img src=&quot;https://images.weserv.nl/?url=www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/media-assets/image/20231118_STP002.jpg&quot;/>;&lt;div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-caps=&quot;initial&quot;>;&lt;span data-caps=&quot;initial&quot;>;O&lt;/span>;&lt;small>;NE OF THE&lt;/small>; first signs of Alzheimer&#39;s disease is confusion. Most people can park their car in a different space every morning and find it again in the evening. Those with Alzheimer&#39;s find this type of problem much harder. Memories of things they do often, like eating or taking medication, become tangled in their minds. &lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;figure>;&lt;div>;&lt;figcaption>;Listen to this story.&lt;/figcaption>; &lt;span>;Enjoy more audio and podcasts on&lt;!-- -->; &lt;a id=&quot;audio-ios-cta&quot; href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttps://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/bed1b25&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;>;iOS&lt;/a>; &lt;!-- -->;or&lt;!-- -->; &lt;a id=&quot;audio-android-cta&quot; href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttps://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/7f3c199&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;>;Android&lt;/a>;.&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;audio controls=&quot;&quot; id=&quot;audio-player&quot; preload=&quot;none&quot; src=&quot;https://www.economist.com/media-assets/audio/070%20Science%20and%20technology%20-%20Neuroscience-765327d130c5527ccba322f61ae27860.mp3&quot; title=&quot;Could newborn neurons reverse Alzheimer&#39;s?&quot; controlsList=&quot;nodownload&quot;>;&lt;p>;Your browser does not support the &amp;lt;audio&amp;gt; element.&lt;/p>;&lt;/audio>;&lt;div>;&lt;div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;The ability to distinguish between similar memories depends on a tiny strip of brain tissue called the dentate gyrus. Studies in mice have shown that the dentate gyrus is one of the few bits of the brain to generate new neurons even in adulthood. Those new neurons are thought to help keep similar memories distinct.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Whether something similar happens in humans is less clear. But a clutch of new results described this week at the Society for Neuroscience&#39;s conference in Washington, &lt;small>;DC&lt;/small>;, suggest that it might. And if it does, then encouraging the process might offer a new treatment for Alzheimer&#39;s disease. &lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div>;&lt;div id=&quot;econ-1&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Until the 1960s scientists thought adult brains did not produce new neurons. Then evidence began to emerge of young neurons in the brains of adult rats and mice&lt;sup>;,&lt;/sup>;—specifically in the olfactory bulb, which processes smell, and the dentate gyrus. These new neurons had developed from neural progenitor cells, a type of undifferentiated neuron akin to a stem cell, in a process scientists call neurogenesis.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;And there seems to be a link, at least in mice, between these new neurons and Alzheimer&#39;s disease. Mice genetically engineered to have Alzheimer&#39;s-like symptoms also have fewer young neurons in their brains. Two studies published in 2021 and 2022 showed that encouraging neurogenesis could improve memory in such animals. And a paper published in April this year found that boosting neurogenesis also caused other cells known as microglia to begin cleaning up tangles of protein, called amyloid-beta plaques, that are characteristic of Alzheimer&#39;s disease.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;So far so promising—if you are a mouse. But studying neurogenesis in humans is tricky. &lt;small>;MRI&lt;/small>; scanners cannot watch the growth of individual neurons. Scientists must take samples of brain tissue from cadavers and either stain them with chemicals that bind only to young neurons, or measure the genes that have been expressed within brain cells to look for the hallmarks of youth. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Dozens of such papers have been published. But for every one that has found evidence of neurogenesis, another has failed to do so. The pro-neurogenesis camp thinks the null results are down to poor-quality brain tissue or crude preservation techniques. The antis argue that either humans do not grow these neurons in the dentate gyrus, or if they do, there are too few of them to be useful. &lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div>;&lt;div id=&quot;econ-2&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;The research presented in Washington strengthens the case for human neurogenesis. Maura Boldrini of Columbia University, María Llorens-Martín of the University of Madrid, Orly Lazarov at the University of Illinois at Chicago and Hongjun Song of the University of Pennsylvania presented evidence of young neurons in the dentate gyruses of humans—though most of their findings have not yet been peer reviewed. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Three of these researchers also studied the brains of healthy older people or people with Alzheimer&#39;s disease. Their results suggested that the production of the supposed new neurons slows with age, and falls precipitously in Alzheimer&#39;s disease. Previous studies by two of the groups also found that Alzheimer&#39;s patients with more of these neurons had better memories. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;But while the new research strengthens the case for human neurogenesis, it is not yet definitive. One group of researchers from Yale University questioned whether the staining technique used in one of the studies was accidentally tagging other brain cells such as astrocytes. They are also concerned that the studies tend to find very few progenitor cells. “Where are all the mothers of these baby neurons?” asked Jon Arellano, one of the sceptics. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;There are other wrinkles. Dr Song found a different set of genes expressed in the supposedly young human neurons from those seen in neurons from other animals. And the few young neurons that both Dr Song and Dr Lazarov found in the brains of Alzheimer&#39;s patients looked very different from the same neurons in healthy brains. If the new cells are somehow defective, increasing their number may not help. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;But although not all the scientists at the conference were convinced, some drug-makers appear to be. In April, Biomed Industries, a pharmaceutical firm based in California, said that results from an early clinical trial suggested that a new drug that the firm claims increases neurogenesis in mice improved memory in people with moderate Alzheimer&#39;s. If subsequent trials prove to be equally encouraging, that could be further evidence that the neurogenesis theory of Alzheimer&#39;s may indeed have something to it. &lt;span data-ornament=&quot;ufinish&quot;>;■&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;i>;Curious about the world?

They have also, in effect dislodged Hamas from power, at least in the north of the enclave: the group that has controlled Gaza since 2007 is now scattered and reeling.&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div>;&lt;div id=&quot;econ-1&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;aside>;&lt;p>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.com/israel-hamas&quot;>;Read all our coverage of the war between Israel and Hamas&lt;/a>;&lt;/p>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;p>;All this raises two important questions.首先也是最紧迫的是如何缓解加沙南部的人道主义灾难。该领土 220 万人口现在几乎全部居住在南部。 A total siege imposed by Israel on its border crossings to Gaza, and the anaemic flow of aid across Gaza&#39;s border with Egypt, have left Gazans desperately short of food and water.燃料短缺使医院和援助机构陷入瘫痪。 And winter has arrived, bringing cold temperatures and rain that will further add to the misery.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Second is what happens next on the battlefield.逃往加沙南部的不仅仅是平民：一些哈马斯武装分子无疑也做了同样的事情。以色列尚未找到该组织在加沙的领导人叶海亚·辛瓦尔(Yahya Sinwar)或其军事首领穆罕默德·德伊夫(Muhammad Deif)，据信两人都藏身于飞地下方迷宫般的隧道中。以色列军队将在未来几周内炸毁这些隧道的入口，并在北部搜寻武器和武装分子。不过，到了某个时候，以色列将不得不将注意力转向南部。 How much it will be able to do there will depend on domestic politics and diplomatic pressure.&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;figure>;&lt;span itemscope=&quot;&quot; itemProp=&quot;image&quot; itemType=&quot;https://schema.org/ImageObject&quot; data-slim=&quot;1&quot;>;&lt;meta itemProp=&quot;url&quot; content=&quot;https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/1574/90/media-assets/image/20231118_MAM903.png&quot;/>;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/1574/90/media-assets/image/20231118_MAM903.png&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/518/90/media-assets/image/20231118_MAM903.png 200w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/777/90/media-assets/image/20231118_MAM903.png 300w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/1036/90/media-assets/image/20231118_MAM903.png 400w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/1553/90/media-assets/image/20231118_MAM903.png 600w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/1657/90/media-assets/image/20231118_MAM903.png 640w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/2071/90/media-assets/image/20231118_MAM903.png 800w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/2589/90/media-assets/image/20231118_MAM903.png 1000w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/3314/90/media-assets/image/20231118_MAM903.png 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;336px&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;p>;In recent days attention has been focused on al-Shifa hospital, the largest in Gaza, and other such facilities.以色列称哈马斯在希法地下设有地下总部。它还认为 239 名人质中的一些人藏在那里，至少是暂时的。 On November 15th, after encircling it for six days, Israeli troops entered the hospital compound.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The situation was still unfolding as &lt;i>;The Economist &lt;/i>;went to press, but initial reports suggest the &lt;small>;IDF&lt;/small>; found neither the leadership of Hamas nor any of the hostages. Most of the 60,000 or so Palestinians who had been sheltering at the hospital in the early days of the war had also vanished. When Israeli troops entered, only 1,500 or so people remained, a mix of medical staff, patients and displaced people.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Most fled south—as did everyone else.北部曾经居住着加沙一半以上的人口，现在却成了一片荒芜的荒地。据报道，驻扎在沙蒂的以色列军队只与小群平民发生过几次冲突。 There are no accurate figures for how many people remain, clustered around hospitals and relief centres. Israeli and foreign sources believe they number only in the tens of thousands.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The population of southern Gaza has doubled over the past month, an increase that would strain basic services even without a near-total blockade of the enclave. An estimated 1.5m people have been forced from their homes, mostly from the north but also from the south.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;div>;&lt;div id=&quot;econ-2&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Since October 21st, when Israel consented to allow in aid deliveries via Egypt, around 1,200 trucks have brought food, medicine and other essentials through the Rafah crossing (before the war, around 500 entered Gaza each day).南方的许多人不吃饭，努力寻找干净的水。 With shipments of fuel almost totally prohibited by Israel, some Palestinians have taken to burning furniture as firewood to cook.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The lack of fuel has paralysed basic services.近三分之二的医疗机构已经停止工作。污水泵站已离线。国际救援委员会表示，霍乱和伤寒等水传播疾病将不可避免地开始传播。 On November 14th the &lt;small>;un&lt;/small>; said that aid deliveries would soon cease; it lacked enough fuel even to operate forklifts.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The next day a tanker with 23,000 litres of diesel entered Gaza from Egypt, the first such shipment Israel has allowed since the war began.这总比什么都没有好——但也只是勉强。 Israeli restrictions mean the fuel can be used only by the &lt;small>;UN&lt;/small>;, not by hospitals, where generators have run dry. Tom White, the director of the &lt;small>;UN&lt;/small>; aid agency in Gaza, says the delivery covered just 9% of his organisation&#39;s daily needs.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Heavy winter rains have also arrived. 11月14日的一场倾盆大雨中，一些巴勒斯坦人发现他们的帐篷倒塌了；其他人则睡在泥里。 December and January are reliably cold and wet in Gaza, with night-time temperatures dipping to 8°C.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Before the war began, around two-thirds of the trucks entering Gaza went through Kerem Shalom, a crossing with Israel.自10月7日起一直关闭。 There is little support in Israel for helping Gazans after Hamas&#39;s atrocities, and the far-right parties in Binyamin Netanyahu&#39;s government are adamantly opposed to it.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;So supplies must take a circuitous route through Egypt.他们抵达北西奈省。然后，他们被卡车运到以色列边境口岸，接受武器检查，然后返回拉法。绕道增加了 100 公里的路程，而且拉法每天只开放几个小时。 “Relief organisations find it very difficult to operate in Egypt, which is why they have usually done so in Israel, where the distances are shorter and procedures used to be more efficient,” says Tania Hari, the director of Gisha, an Israeli &lt;small>;ngo&lt;/small>; that lobbies for more access to Gaza. “Kerem Shalom has to be reopened for Gazans to survive.”&lt;/p>;&lt;h2>;The next step&lt;/h2>;&lt;p>;Whether to do that is one question for Israel as it decides how to proceed with its war.在坦克、嗅探犬和爆破队的陪同下，士兵们花了两个多星期的时间挨家挨户搜寻武器和通往哈马斯地道的竖井。一名官员解释了有条不紊的程序。可疑建筑物成为坦克或空袭的目标。然后，士兵们与警犬和工兵一起进行检查。他们不被允许冒险进入隧道。 More shafts are constantly being found.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Weapons and explosives left behind in houses indicate that Hamas fighters left in a hurry.目前还不清楚他们去了哪里。有些人可能试图在剩下的隧道中生存。其他人可能已经逃往南方或撤退到城市的正中心。 “我们每天要处理大约 90 到 100 座建筑物，”营指挥官奥兹中尉说。 Dozens of battalions are on similar missions in and around Gaza city.&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div>;&lt;div id=&quot;econ-3&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Israeli generals know that they will not be able to act in southern Gaza with the same ferocity as in the north.相反，他们正在计划一场“更具机动性”的攻势。但任何行动都可能会阻碍救援工作，并引起国际社会的强烈抗议，而国际社会的抗议已经越来越强烈。 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/11/16/many-arab-governments-would-like-to-see-hamas-gone&quot; data-tegid=&quot;gecusf6t1045a2vvffujsc2p45jt9k29&quot;>;At a summit&lt;/a>; in Saudi Arabia this month Arab and Muslim countries demanded an end to the fighting.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Some Western leaders have begun to echo that demand. Emmanuel Macron, the French president, called for a ceasefire in an interview with the &lt;small>;BBC&lt;/small>;. Joe Biden still rejects a permanent truce, though he is under pressure from some in his party to push for a ceasefire. Talks are taking place about a pause in the fighting in exchange for the release of some of the hostages.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;A less brutal war could ease that pressure.在战争的头几周内，巴勒斯坦死亡人数每天激增数百人。不过，最近几天，伤亡率明显下降，北部地区几乎已无一人幸存。这可以为以色列赢得更多时间来继续其地面战役。 So would a greatly expanded humanitarian effort.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Israel must also consider what comes next in Gaza, something Mr Netanyahu has so far refused to do.目前，哈马斯已经失去了统治能力。它也可能失去了曾经统治的人民的支持。 “（加沙人）指责哈马斯给他们带来了这场悲剧，”一名陪同部队进入加沙地带的以色列情报官员说。 That is what one would expect the &lt;small>;IDF&lt;/small>; to say—but it rings true.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Even before the war, it was difficult to gauge public opinion in Gaza: Hamas ruled as an authoritarian one-party state, and the last Palestinian parliamentary elections were in 2006. It is even harder now.不过，轶事证据表明，加沙的许多人对其表面上的统治者感到愤怒。最近几天，许多巴勒斯坦人在加沙南部接到电话，描述了针对哈马斯的愤怒场面。 Policemen have been cursed and beaten while trying to jump queues for food and water.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;That is not to say desperate Gazans feel any warmth for Israel.哈马斯诞生于加沙； its most influential leaders, Mr Sinwar and Mr Deif, grew up in the refugee camp near Khan Younis, the city that now hosts untold Gazans displaced from the north. Israel may have dealt the group a fatal blow. But a long period of miserable displacement would ensure that something else rises in its stead. &lt;span data-ornament=&quot;ufinish&quot;>;■&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 17 Nov 2023 04:57:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Fear and goading in the West Bank | 1843 magazine]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/1843/2023/11/15/fear-and-goading-in-the-west-bank]]><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.weserv.nl/?url=www.economist.com/img/b/1337/752/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231115_1843_SETTLERS_TEASER.jpg&quot;/>;&lt;div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-caps=&quot;initial&quot;>;&lt;span data-caps=&quot;initial&quot;>;A&lt;/span>;t midday on Friday October 13th, a scant week after &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.com/1843/2023/10/13/how-one-kibbutz-defended-itself-from-hamas&quot;>;Hamas&#39;s horrific terrorist attack&lt;/a>; on Israel, Basel Adra, a human-rights activist from the Palestinian village of At-Tuwani heard a commotion and grabbed his camera. Children in the playground next to the village school were yelling and pointing across the valley. Two armed settlers and an Israeli soldier had walked down the road and were engaged in an altercation with the family that lived on the edge of the village. The men had come from an outpost of an Israeli settlement that was established on the hill opposite At-Tuwani in the 1980s, in spite of the fact that the area was outside Israel&#39;s internationally recognised boundaries. The settlers snatched at the Palestinian family&#39;s smartphones as they tried to film the encounter. One hit the father of the house on the forehead with his rifle butt. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;This kind of incident is common in At-Tuwani, a village of 300 people. The residents of Ma&#39;on, the neighbouring settlement, have harassed the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.com/1843/2023/10/27/ali-jadallah-has-lost-four-relatives-in-gaza-hes-still-taking-pictures&quot;>;Palestinian villagers&lt;/a>; for years, most often by threatening farmers in their fields and driving shepherds like Adra&#39;s father from the hills where they grazed their sheep. Adra, in his late 20s, told me he had a photograph of himself at the age of three among the pine trees of the hilltop where now I could see the grain silos and barns of the settler outpost. “I don&#39;t remember it,” he told me, “but the villagers used to go to these woods for walks and picnics.” After the settlers arrived, the Palestinians learned to band together to defend against incursions and protect each other from the beatings and arrests at the hands of the Israel Defence Forces (&lt;small>;IDF&lt;/small>;) and the police. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;As Adra filmed the scene, around 20 men came out of a nearby mosque to see what was happening. He zoomed in and saw his cousin, Zakaria al-Adra, walking up the road towards the settlers and the soldier. A settler wearing a red shirt raised his gun and, at a distance of only a few metres, shot Zakaria in the stomach. The Palestinians behind him ducked and began shouting in outrage. Some went to help Zakaria, who was slumped on the ground.

Israel mobilised over 300,000 reservists in the wake of the Hamas attacks, and many of soldiers serving in the West Bank were pulled out to fight in Gaza and the north of the country. Reservists have been called up in their place, some of them local settlers. One Israeli activist told me that the “level of settler violence is very different now. The fact that many settlers are in military uniform with military weapons makes a difference.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;B&#39;Tselem and other organisations have documented intimidation all over the West Bank in recent days: settlers entering Palestinian villages day and night, revving all-terrain vehicles around houses, beating men, smashing mobile phones, windows and solar panels, bulldozing livestock pens and water reservoirs, slashing plastic water tanks, irrigation hoses and car tyres.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Fifteen entire communities, many comprising a few families in tents and shacks but some much larger, have left their homes as a result. More than 900 people have been displaced. One man was shot and killed while harvesting olives near Nablus, one of eight Palestinians to be killed by settlers since October 7th.&lt;/p>;&lt;figure>;&lt;span itemscope=&quot;&quot; itemProp=&quot;image&quot; itemType=&quot;https://schema.org/ImageObject&quot;>;&lt;meta itemProp=&quot;url&quot; content=&quot;https://www.economist.com/img/b/1414/944/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231115_1843_SETTLERS_04.jpg&quot;/>;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; width=&quot;1414&quot; height=&quot;944&quot; src=&quot;https://www.economist.com/img/b/1414/944/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231115_1843_SETTLERS_04.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/134/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231115_1843_SETTLERS_04.jpg 200w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/200/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231115_1843_SETTLERS_04.jpg 300w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/267/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231115_1843_SETTLERS_04.jpg 400w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/401/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231115_1843_SETTLERS_04.jpg 600w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/427/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231115_1843_SETTLERS_04.jpg 640w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/534/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231115_1843_SETTLERS_04.jpg 800w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/668/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231115_1843_SETTLERS_04.jpg 1000w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/855/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231115_1843_SETTLERS_04.jpg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;figure>;&lt;span itemscope=&quot;&quot; itemProp=&quot;image&quot; itemType=&quot;https://schema.org/ImageObject&quot;>;&lt;meta itemProp=&quot;url&quot; content=&quot;https://www.economist.com/img/b/1440/960/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231115_1843_SETTLERS_05.jpg&quot;/>;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; width=&quot;1440&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; src=&quot;https://www.economist.com/img/b/1440/960/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231115_1843_SETTLERS_05.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/133/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231115_1843_SETTLERS_05.jpg 200w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/200/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231115_1843_SETTLERS_05.jpg 300w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/267/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231115_1843_SETTLERS_05.jpg 400w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/400/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231115_1843_SETTLERS_05.jpg 600w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/427/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231115_1843_SETTLERS_05.jpg 640w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/533/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231115_1843_SETTLERS_05.jpg 800w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/667/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231115_1843_SETTLERS_05.jpg 1000w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/853/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231115_1843_SETTLERS_05.jpg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;figure>;&lt;span itemscope=&quot;&quot; itemProp=&quot;image&quot; itemType=&quot;https://schema.org/ImageObject&quot;>;&lt;meta itemProp=&quot;url&quot; content=&quot;https://www.economist.com/img/b/1587/1058/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231115_1843_SETTLERS_06.jpg&quot;/>;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; width=&quot;1587&quot; height=&quot;1058&quot; src=&quot;https://www.economist.com/img/b/1587/1058/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231115_1843_SETTLERS_06.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/133/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231115_1843_SETTLERS_06.jpg 200w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/200/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231115_1843_SETTLERS_06.jpg 300w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/267/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231115_1843_SETTLERS_06.jpg 400w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/400/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231115_1843_SETTLERS_06.jpg 600w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/427/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231115_1843_SETTLERS_06.jpg 640w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/533/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231115_1843_SETTLERS_06.jpg 800w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/667/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231115_1843_SETTLERS_06.jpg 1000w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/853/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231115_1843_SETTLERS_06.jpg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/>;&lt;/span>;&lt;figcaption>;&lt;b>;Unsettling times &lt;/b>;Israeli men practise their shooting at a gun range in Migdal Oz, a settlement in the West Bank (&lt;i>;top&lt;/i>;).

When the settlers from Ma&#39;on tried to push him off his pasture, he resisted. Adra first saw his father attacked on his tenth birthday in 2005. Fifteen years later, he was beaten up in the same field. “I thought it would be the last day I would be alive. Soldiers were hitting me, dragging me towards their jeep, trying to wrest my arms behind me but I kept one hand under my stomach, so they couldn&#39;t handcuff me.” A crowd of locals rushed to his aid and distracted the soldiers, before an &lt;small>;IDF&lt;/small>; officer arrived and broke up the confrontation. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;From the late 1990s At-Tuwani became a hub of activism for the 20 Palestinian villages in the area. For more than two decades, Israeli and foreign campaigners and lawyers have helped the villagers to resist land appropriation, court cases, arrests and detentions.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Adra&#39;s parents helped build a school in the village, despite intimidation, a demolition order and soldiers confiscating their tools. Adra&#39;s class was the first to complete their whole education there. Adra then studied law at Hebron University, before turning to human-rights work. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;cite>;At the end of October settlers and soldiers began harassing the inhabitants of Zanuta. Over several days they threw stun grenades at doors, beat people up, smashed cars and solar panels and warned people to leave&lt;/cite>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Over the years Israeli peace activists have developed a policy of “protective presence”, accompanying villagers as they cultivated their lands and grazed their flocks, and sleeping overnight in villages to deter and monitor abuses by settlers and soldiers. Adra told me that soldiers “act differently” when there are Israelis around. They allow the Israeli activists to film confrontations on their phones and the police always respond when they call for help, which is not the case for Palestinians. Above all, they give the locals the feeling that they are not alone.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;There is a meeting place for activists in the basement of Adra&#39;s family home – a large room with a kitchen against one wall, a small dorm with bunk beds and a mural on a wall by the entrance depicting a Palestinian family under olive trees, a big orange sun and bunting of Palestinian flags. There were about a dozen people gathered there when I visited. One of them, a young man with blue eyes, didn&#39;t want me to use his real name because his employers don&#39;t know about his activism – he told me to refer to him as Yuval. He said he had been volunteering as “protective presence” for about two years. “Communicating with the soldiers in their own language can defuse a situation,” he said. “Sometimes, in normal times, some soldiers are even sympathetic. But it&#39;s increasingly hard now because the Israelis have been encouraged to see us as &#39;the others&#39;.

Some had skull badges on their uniforms. They threw our bags out of the car onto the road. There was a lot of testosterone.” A police officer calmed the situation but told the group not to provoke settlers by approaching them.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The weeks since the attack had been “hell”, said Yuval.

A Palestinian flag fluttered above the school, which has been shut since Hamas&#39;s attacks. Adra explained that, as a security measure, the army had blocked many roads in the area with checkpoints, gates and berms of bulldozed earth. Driving had become almost impossible and walking, given the tension, was discouraged.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;cite>;Over the years Israeli peace activists have developed a policy of “protective presence”, sleeping overnight in villages to deter and monitor abuses by settlers and soldiers&lt;/cite>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;He pointed across the shallow valley to where the lip of the settlement of Ma&#39;on was visible. Below it was a tent where settlers had occupied privately owned Palestinian land. An Israeli flag had been placed in the branches of a tree. Since October 7th the villagers have not dared graze their sheep on the surrounding hills. “We don&#39;t go there,” said Adra. “No way.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-caps=&quot;initial&quot;>;&lt;span data-caps=&quot;initial&quot;>;P&lt;/span>;alestinians with white-and-green licence plates and Israelis with yellow ones share the main road that runs south from Jerusalem to Hebron. The road winds through the bare rocky hills, striped with dusty grapevines and olive trees. It is potholed and rubbly; rubbish is piled in drifts next to broken cars. The Palestinian villages comprise groups of white square houses, often with unfinished flat roofs, sprouting black water tanks and the rusty ears of satellite dishes. The towns are often fenced off from the road; junctions are guarded by Israeli soldiers in concrete conning towers. Signs warn Israelis that entering is illegal and they risk death. &lt;/p>;&lt;figure>;&lt;span itemscope=&quot;&quot; itemProp=&quot;image&quot; itemType=&quot;https://schema.org/ImageObject&quot;>;&lt;meta itemProp=&quot;url&quot; content=&quot;https://www.economist.com/img/b/1440/960/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231115_1843_SETTLERS_11.jpg&quot;/>;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; width=&quot;1440&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; src=&quot;https://www.economist.com/img/b/1440/960/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231115_1843_SETTLERS_11.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/133/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231115_1843_SETTLERS_11.jpg 200w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/200/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231115_1843_SETTLERS_11.jpg 300w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/267/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231115_1843_SETTLERS_11.jpg 400w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/400/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231115_1843_SETTLERS_11.jpg 600w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/427/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231115_1843_SETTLERS_11.jpg 640w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/533/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231115_1843_SETTLERS_11.jpg 800w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/667/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231115_1843_SETTLERS_11.jpg 1000w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/853/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231115_1843_SETTLERS_11.jpg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;figure>;&lt;span itemscope=&quot;&quot; itemProp=&quot;image&quot; itemType=&quot;https://schema.org/ImageObject&quot;>;&lt;meta itemProp=&quot;url&quot; content=&quot;https://www.economist.com/img/b/1440/960/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231115_1843_SETTLERS_12.jpg&quot;/>;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; width=&quot;1440&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; src=&quot;https://www.economist.com/img/b/1440/960/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231115_1843_SETTLERS_12.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/133/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231115_1843_SETTLERS_12.jpg 200w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/200/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231115_1843_SETTLERS_12.jpg 300w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/267/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231115_1843_SETTLERS_12.jpg 400w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/400/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231115_1843_SETTLERS_12.jpg 600w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/427/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231115_1843_SETTLERS_12.jpg 640w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/533/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231115_1843_SETTLERS_12.jpg 800w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/667/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231115_1843_SETTLERS_12.jpg 1000w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/853/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231115_1843_SETTLERS_12.jpg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;figure>;&lt;span itemscope=&quot;&quot; itemProp=&quot;image&quot; itemType=&quot;https://schema.org/ImageObject&quot;>;&lt;meta itemProp=&quot;url&quot; content=&quot;https://www.economist.com/img/b/1263/843/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231115_1843_SETTLERS_13.jpg&quot;/>;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; width=&quot;1263&quot; height=&quot;843&quot; src=&quot;https://www.economist.com/img/b/1263/843/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231115_1843_SETTLERS_13.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/133/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231115_1843_SETTLERS_13.jpg 200w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/200/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231115_1843_SETTLERS_13.jpg 300w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/267/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231115_1843_SETTLERS_13.jpg 400w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/400/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231115_1843_SETTLERS_13.jpg 600w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/427/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231115_1843_SETTLERS_13.jpg 640w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/534/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231115_1843_SETTLERS_13.jpg 800w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/667/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231115_1843_SETTLERS_13.jpg 1000w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/854/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231115_1843_SETTLERS_13.jpg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/>;&lt;/span>;&lt;figcaption>;&lt;b>;Uprooting their lives &lt;/b>;Bringing in the olive harvest (&lt;i>;top and middle&lt;/i>;). A Palestinian shepherd leaves Zanuta (&lt;i>;bottom&lt;/i>;) &lt;/figcaption>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;p>;From the road, the Israeli settlements are identifiable by the red roofs of the houses, built in tiers around the summits of hills. I visited one of these, Carmel, to meet Tal Rachmani, a young mother and spokeswoman for the council of Har Hevron that administers 20 settlements in the region. When we arrived, two soldiers and two armed settlers in mufti called ahead to confirm we were invited and pulled back the heavy metal gate to let us in.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Rachmani was born in Carmel – her parents were among the first to settle here, 40 years ago. We sat outside in the main square in the shade of trees. As we were talking, Rachmani received a phone call from a member of Im Tirtzu, a right-wing campaign group. The caller barked loudly and aggressively that she should not be talking to journalists because we were antisemitic. After Rachmani put the phone down, a little taken aback by the vehemence, she explained that there was a concern that publicity about settler violence could cause the government to rein in the &lt;small>;IDF&lt;/small>; in the West Bank, “so the army won&#39;t defend our villages as they need to, they won&#39;t search houses for weapons, they won&#39;t arrest people.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“We are all heartbroken,” said Rachmani, referring to the massacre of October 7th. Two people from nearby settlements had been killed at the Nova music festival; the husband of a friend, a reservist, had rushed south as soon as he heard about the attacks. His body was found two days later. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;cite>;“You need to remember there are families in Hebron who are intermarried with people in Gaza. So while the war in Gaza is ongoing we feel the violence increasing in Hebron”&lt;/cite>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Most of the men in Carmel and the nearby settlements, including Rachmani&#39;s husband, had been called up for reserve duty; in the first week of war some mothers had taken their children to stay with their parents. “There were a lot of rumours and fear,” said Rachmani. “Here we are also surrounded by Arab villages.” She claimed that a “lot of terrorists” came from them. When she was growing up, there were incidents of Palestinians throwing stones and Molotov cocktails, and firing shots at cars. She remembered, as a ten-year-old, being in an armoured bus that came under gunfire. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Rachmani said there had been no violence by Palestinians in the area since Hamas&#39;s attacks. “But in the last month we feel the Arabs around us are considering whether they will be a part of this war,” she told me. Tensions were running high.

And they are typically discovered in remote places like rainforests or Antarctic plateaus. But not so a species of bacterium described in a paper just published in &lt;i>;Extremophiles&lt;/i>;. As Russell Vreeland and Heng-Lin Chui, the paper&#39;s authors, point out, the bug is new to science. But it is not new to Earth. In fact the microbe may have been slumbering for millions of years before being awakened by an industrial disaster. &lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;figure>;&lt;div>;&lt;figcaption>;Listen to this story.&lt;/figcaption>; &lt;span>;Enjoy more audio and podcasts on&lt;!-- -->; &lt;a id=&quot;audio-ios-cta&quot; href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttps://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/bed1b25&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;>;iOS&lt;/a>; &lt;!-- -->;or&lt;!-- -->; &lt;a id=&quot;audio-android-cta&quot; href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttps://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/7f3c199&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;>;Android&lt;/a>;.&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;audio controls=&quot;&quot; id=&quot;audio-player&quot; preload=&quot;none&quot; src=&quot;https://www.economist.com/media-assets/audio/069%20Science%20and%20technology%20-%20Microbiology-f53d61cc6dd4b5edae4902678134b609.mp3&quot; title=&quot;Was an ancient bacterium awakened by an industrial accident?&quot; controlsList=&quot;nodownload&quot;>;&lt;p>;Your browser does not support the &amp;lt;audio&amp;gt; element.&lt;/p>;&lt;/audio>;&lt;div>;&lt;div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;The bacterium in question lives below Lake Peigneur in southern Louisiana. The ground beneath the lake is rich in natural resources. In 1980 it boasted a mine producing rock salt, while a drilling rig run by Texaco was moving about on the surface looking for oil. But on November 20th, the two operations came together accidentally—and spectacularly. The oil rig&#39;s drill penetrated the third level of the salt mine, creating a drain in the lake&#39;s floor. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Over the next few days the resulting man-made sinkhole swallowed up the oil rig, 11 barges, a tugboat, 35 hectares of land and part of a house. A canal that drained the lake into the Gulf of Mexico began flowing backwards as the water level fell, briefly creating the tallest waterfall in Louisiana, while muddy geysers erupted from mine shafts. Somehow, all 50 people working in the mine managed to get out ahead of the rising floodwaters.&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div>;&lt;div id=&quot;econ-1&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;An official report could not determine whether the oil rig had been drilling in the wrong place, or whether the maps of the mine were inaccurate. Either way, the disaster created an entirely new environment. The water that flowed into the mine contained less than 2% salt. But rock salt dissolves readily in water. When Dr Vreeland, then at the University of New Orleans, was granted access to part of the flooded mine in 1987, he found the water within contained 32% salt, about nine times more than seawater.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;For most creatures, that much salt would be lethal. But Dr Vreeland found a species of bacteria, one of a salt-loving group called &lt;i>;Halobacteriales&lt;/i>;, in his samples. The bug grew best in water containing 18% salt—and died when concentrations fell below 10%. Since the bacterium could not have survived in the lake, how did it get into the water in the mine?&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Having access to only a small lab, and with comparatively few resources, Dr Vreeland decided to shelve the mystery and move on to other projects. During a visit to China in 2016, though, he met Dr Chui, another expert in salt-loving microbes, and decided to return to his cold case. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In the intervening years, scientists have found that some bacteria possess exceptional powers of self-preservation. When times are hard they can enter a form of stasis, shutting down all biological activity until things improve. The salt beneath Lake Peigneur was formed by the evaporation of a previous body of salty water. Some of the salt is 125m years old, meaning it was laid down during the heyday of the dinosaurs. The new species, the researchers suggest, is therefore antediluvian both literally and metaphorically. It was there before the mine was flooded, trapped in water pockets within the salt crystals—and it may have been there for millions of years. &lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div>;&lt;div id=&quot;econ-2&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Exactly how long bacteria can remain in suspended animation is difficult to test, because experiments cannot reasonably run for more than a few decades. But Dr Vreeland claimed in &lt;i>;Nature&lt;/i>; in 2000 that he and his colleagues had succeeded in reviving another salt-loving bacterium that was 250m years old. A study published last year argued that, in some circumstances, a particularly resilient species called &lt;i>;Deinococcus radiodurans &lt;/i>;might be able to manage 300m years in stasis.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;And Dr Vreeland points out that the conditions in the salt mine might have helped this latest species while away the aeons in relative safety. One problem faced by a somnolent organism is the gradual accumulation of damage to its &lt;small>;DNA&lt;/small>;. Oxygen is one source of such damage. But the element does not exist inside rock-salt crystals, and is only very slightly soluble in brine. Ultraviolet light is another danger, but none penetrates below the ground. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Background radiation can also damage genomes. But the only radioactive atom found in brine is potassium-40. With a half-life of over a billion years, it is only mildly radioactive. And bacteria that live in harsh environments, including &lt;i>;Halobacteriales&lt;/i>;, contain plenty of &lt;small>;DNA&lt;/small>;-protecting proteins to prevent damage. Now, thanks to a human mistake, Dr Vreeland&#39;s bacterium has been given an entire mine in which to live, where it can finally reap the rewards of its prodigious patience. &lt;span data-ornament=&quot;ufinish&quot;>;■&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;i>;Curious about the world?

Among tens of thousands of hours of video on its servers, the world&#39;s largest streaming platform has long ignored the category that draws bigger audiences to television than anything else: live sport.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;That changed at 3pm on November 14th in Las Vegas with the Netflix Cup, a celebrity golf tournament which was streamed live to the company&#39;s 250m subscribers.这场非传统的表演由职业高尔夫球手和一级方程式赛车手组成的团队组成，被宣传为一次性的。 It may turn out to be a warm-up for something bigger.&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div>;&lt;div id=&quot;econ-1&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Netflix says the purpose of the cup was to promote “Full Swing” and “Drive to Survive”, its successful docu-series about golf and racing. Lately the company has been active in a niche that it calls sports shoulder-programming, commissioning factual series such as “Break Point” (following professional tennis players) and “Unchained” (tracking the Tour de France), as well as profiles of stars such as David Beckham.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Showing sport itself has not tempted the streaming giant. Rights are wildly expensive—America&#39;s National Football League (&lt;small>;nfl&lt;/small>;) earns more than $10bn a year from its media deals—as well as low margin: the more value broadcasters get out of the games, the more the leagues demand when the rights come up for renewal. Last year Ted Sarandos, Netflix&#39;s co-chief executive, said the company was “not anti-sports, we&#39;re just pro-profit”.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;That wording left the door open to a different approach—and the Netflix Cup suggests one.通过拥有这项赛事，Netflix 将保留任何优势。研究公司 LightShed Partners 的布兰登·罗斯 (Brandon Ross) 表示：“如果他们创造了价值，他们就会享受其中的成果，而不是为另一个体育联盟创造价值，后者可能会转身要求他们增加价值。” Netflix has reportedly explored buying small sporting outfits such as the World Surf League on this basis.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The bigger question is whether the company might one day bid for rights to established leagues.分析师越来越相信这种情况会发生，尽管他们对于具体时间存在分歧。另一家研究公司 MoffettNathanson 的迈克尔·内桑森 (Michael Nathanson) 表示：“Netflix 的下一个前沿领域必须是更多的体育赛事转播权。”他将高尔夫杯视为对体育赛事吸引观众到该平台的能力以及 Netflix 执行直播节目能力的考验。他认为美国国家篮球协会的权利是未来可能的目标，该权利将于 2025 年续签。 Mr Ross thinks that is too soon.&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div>;&lt;div id=&quot;econ-2&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Netflix downplays all such talk.但它比过去更有理由申办体育赛事。自去年初用户增长陷入停滞并导致股价暴跌以来，Netflix 的高管们绞尽脑汁寻找新的扩张方式。去年，该公司推出了广告，但此前该公司曾拒绝这样做。今年，它对曾经鼓励的用户共享密码进行了打击。体育可能有助于吸引新订阅者，特别是在该流媒体一直难以突破的国外市场。 Cricket turbocharged the early growth of Disney+ in India—though it proved so expensive that Disney eventually dropped it.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Netflix&#39;s newish ad business also makes sport more attractive.体育对广告商来说很有吸引力，他们说体育比其他广告更能吸引观众，同时又具有可靠的品牌安全性（一些客户不愿在“鱿鱼游戏”的血腥戏剧旁边展示他们的产品）。真人表演意味着不能跳过广告插播；球迷们不愿意溜出去把水壶打开，生怕错过比赛。 And sport offers advertisers unmatched scale, with &lt;small>;nfl&lt;/small>; games reliably drawing more than 20m concurrent viewers in America on Sunday nights.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;If Netflix were to take to the field it could be game-changing. Sports-rights holders have cashed in following interest from deep-pocketed streamers such as Apple, Amazon and Google (which last year bought &lt;small>;nfl&lt;/small>; rights for YouTube).但他们担心老媒体竞标者正在勒紧裤腰带。 Disney (which owns &lt;small>;espn&lt;/small>;, a giant sports network) and Warner Bros Discovery are both aggressively economising as their legacy cable networks shrink. “现在整个（体育）内容世界……都希望 Netflix 参与体育版权的竞标，”罗斯先生说。 “And all of the traditional media buyers are praying that Netflix doesn&#39;t.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Netflix, meanwhile, is simply praying that its live-streaming technology holds up.它的首场现场表演是三月份与克里斯·洛克合作的喜剧特别节目，进展顺利。但四月份，约会竞赛“Love is Blind”的现场直播却遭遇了技术上的惨败。 Netflix 杯再次证明电视直播是很难实现的。主持人努力解释比赛的复杂形式，麦克风发生故障，在节目的前十分钟内，一名动物权利抗议者冲进球场，然后被摔出镜头。 Whether or not Netflix can do sport, it can certainly do drama.&lt;span data-ornament=&quot;ufinish&quot;>;■&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;i>;To stay on top of the biggest stories in business and technology, sign up to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.com/newsletters/the-bottom-line&quot;>;Bottom Line&lt;/a>;, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter.&lt;/i>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 17 Nov 2023 01:27:02 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
