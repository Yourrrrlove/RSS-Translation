/div>;&lt;p data-caps=&quot;initial&quot;>;&lt;span data-caps=&quot;initial&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;small>;法国和英国之间的竞争是长期且激烈的。维基百科的“法国与英国关系”条目超过 15,000 字，几乎相当于一部中篇小说的长度。自从征服者威廉在 1066 年做出了他的名字所暗示的事情以来，法国人和英国人就通过剑、枪、言语以及最近的艺术品拍卖来争夺优势。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;10 月 20 日，胡安·米罗 (Joan Miró) 的一幅画，一位西班牙艺术家，曾在巴黎佳士得拍卖行出售。这幅作品描绘了蜿蜒的人物、星星和金刚鹦鹉羽毛颜色的斑点，以 2070 万欧元（2200 万美元）成交，成为近几十年来法国最昂贵的画作之一。对于观众来说，前卫和意大利作品的拍卖会是巴黎日益增长的艺术影响力的象征。意大利拍卖会曾在伦敦举行，去年佳士得因英国脱欧而将其转移到巴黎。佳士得拍卖行老板纪尧姆·塞鲁蒂 (Guillaume Cerutti) 表示：“伦敦过去的吸引力之一在于它位于欧盟中心的地位。”他补充道：“现在巴黎的势头更大。” （巧合的是，Cerutti 先生是一位居住在伦敦的法国人。）&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div>;&lt;div id=&quot;econ-1&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;巴黎人在艺术界，打开香槟瓶塞的次数比平时还要多。去年苏富比在巴黎举办了 70 场拍卖会，比 2013 年增加了 140%；伦敦举办了 131 场拍卖会，比 10 年前增加了 75%。但拍卖行只是其中的一部分。最近著名的国际画廊，例如 Hauser &amp;amp; 画廊。瑞士公司 Wirth 开设了商店。 “巴黎开设画廊的浪潮非同寻常；奥地利画廊主达太斯·罗帕克 (Thaddaeus Ropac) 说道，他的前哨站包括伦敦和巴黎。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;与英国相比，法国的艺术市场仍然很小，英国占据了 18% 的市场份额。去年全球艺术品销售额达 678 亿美元。英国是仅次于美国的第二大市场，占销售额的 45%。伦敦也是欧洲大多数售价超过 1000 万美元的艺术品的拍卖地。 &lt;i>;相反&lt;/i>;法国仅占全球市场的 7%。但巴黎的份额正在增长，它在艺术品买家和爱好者心目中的地位也在不断提高，他们往往更多地受到情感而非统计数据的引导。研究公司 Arts Economics 的克莱尔·麦克安德鲁 (Clare McAndrew) 表示，按价值计算，法国目前占欧盟所有艺术品交易的 54%。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;一些人坚持认为这不是伦敦和巴黎之间的竞争，这表明它是。 Paris+ 艺术博览会将于 10 月 22 日结束，紧接着在伦敦举行的名为 Frieze 的竞争对手活动，该博览会今年庆祝了其 20 周年纪念日。许多“艺术家”没有时间两者都去。最近，伦敦弗里兹艺术博览会的参观人数有所减少。艺术咨询公司 Twentieth 的莱斯利·拉莫斯 (Leslie Ramos) 表示，选择去巴黎旅行的美国人较少。相比之下，自去年瑞士巴塞尔艺术展推出以来，Paris+ 一直引起热议。&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div>;&lt;div id=&quot;econ-2&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div >;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;英国脱欧是巴黎受到关注的原因之一。英国于 2020 年退出欧盟改变了艺术品买家和卖家的动态。以前，欧洲人可以在伦敦购买艺术品而无需缴纳任何进口税；现在，如果买家从伦敦将货物进口到&lt;小>;欧盟&lt;/小>;国家，则需征收价值的 5-20%。还有更多的文书工作和繁文缛节需要处理。 “作为一名艺术家，现在将你的作品进出英国变得非常复杂，”居住在伦敦但正在考虑搬到巴黎的苏格兰画家彼得·多伊格 (Peter Doig) 说道。&lt;/p>;&lt;巴塞尔艺术展的老板诺亚·霍洛维茨(Noah Horowitz)表示，一些欧洲艺术家已经离开伦敦前往欧洲其他城市。拥有充满活力的当代艺术和博物馆场景的柏林一直是赢家，但它的买家或卖家数量不如伦敦甚至巴黎。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;然而，英国脱欧并不能完全解释巴黎的繁荣，他说苏富比首席执行官查尔斯·斯图尔特 (Charles Stewart) 认为“奢侈品与文化、奢侈品与艺术的碰撞对巴黎产生了影响”。在赚钱的奢侈品公司的推动下，私人基金会提升了这座城市的艺术水平。这里有 Bourse de Commerce，前身是商品交易所，里面收藏着世界上最富有的人之一弗朗索瓦·皮诺 (François Pinault) 的收藏品，他通过时尚品牌发家致富。 （他还拥有佳士得。）卡地亚基金会由一家以黑豹及其珠宝万神殿而闻名的公司发起，将把其当代艺术藏品迁至卢浮宫对面的一座建筑。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;然后是路易威登基金会是伯纳德·阿诺特 (Bernard Arnault) 创建的，他的奢侈品公司使他成为世界第二富有的人。博物馆的展览和雄心受到艺术品运输和保险价格的限制。然而，路易威登基金会不必担心成本。美国画家马克·罗斯科 (Mark Rothko) 回顾展于 10 月 18 日开幕，展出了 115 件作品，其中许多是巨大的色彩浸透的画布。借来的作品价值数十亿美元。 “罗斯科的表演不可能在世界其他任何地方发生，”同样来自二十世纪的奥雷莉·柯西 (Aurelie Cauchy) 说道。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;巴黎的复兴有一种似曾相识的感觉。佳士得和苏富比前董事兼作家菲利普·胡克 (Philip Hook) 表示，从 19 世纪末到第二次世界大战，巴黎一直是“艺术市场的明星”，并且“比伦敦更重要，尤其是在现代艺术方面”。 “The Rogue&#39;s Gallery”的主题，探讨了艺术品交易的历史。艺术家涌入巴黎，买家也涌入巴黎。但在 20 世纪 50 年代，法国开始对艺术品交易征收新税，这推动了伦敦的发展。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;麦克安德鲁女士表示，三个因素造就了一个强大的艺术中心：财富、文化基础设施和无缝的监管体系。她认为，伦敦和巴黎在前两项方面得分都很高，但在监管方面得分较差。美国的官僚机构侵入性较小。麦克安德鲁女士指出，法国政府意识到该国以前是如何失去优势的，因此更加谨慎地努力保持法国的吸引力。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;一些英国人抱怨现任政府削减资金损害了艺术，而另一些人则表示，领导人应该推动政策，帮助伦敦保持其领先地位。 “如果&lt;小>;英国&lt;/小>;政府想要重新获得竞争优势，就需要改变一些法规，”塞鲁蒂先生说。英国艺术市场联合会主席安东尼·布朗（Anthony Browne）正试图说服政府取消艺术品进口税，他表示这不会“对政府收入产生任何重大影响，但会让我们与我们的全球主要国家处于同一水平”。竞争对手”，例如美国和香港。但保护艺术品交易免受进口税的影响，无论财务成本多么小，可能看起来都很糟糕，因为受益的主要是富人。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;最终，政策可能不如市场力量重要。艺术作为一种资产类别在面对更高的利率时出人意料地具有弹性，但不能保证它会保持这种状态。最近，由于中国的房地产和金融动荡，亚洲市场出现了波动。伦敦近期的销售情况好坏参半。一些经销商抱怨说，以色列和巴勒斯坦的暴力事件在一定程度上削弱了展会上随心所欲的情绪，并可能抑制了购买。但困难时期也会鼓励人们放弃竞争。也许对于巴黎和伦敦来说，很快就会出现&lt;i>;缓和&lt;/i>;。 &lt;span data-ornament=&quot;ufinish&quot;>;■&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 23 Oct 2023 23:57:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[How big is the role of luck in career success? | Business]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/business/2023/10/19/how-big-is-the-role-of-luck-in-career-success]]><description> &lt;img src=&quot;https://images.weserv.nl/?url=www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/media-assets/image/20231021_WBD003.jpg&quot;/>;&lt;div>;&lt;

Combinator 的合作伙伴通过谈论增加“运气表面积”来鼓励创始人申请他们的项目：将自己置于可能被拒绝的境地是一种给予运气的方式更多的罢工机会。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;对运气所扮演的角色的认识也应该影响管理者的行为。投资组合思维削弱了运气的作用：米尔科夫和纳维迪指出，如果公司完成大量独立油井，在石油勘探中碰上好运的可能性就会增加。如果运气可能意味着错误的决定会带来好的结果，反之亦然，那么管理者应该学会根据过程和结果来评估计划的成功。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;如果随着时间的推移，技能和运气之间的差异变得明显，那么就根据表现的一致性而不是一次性的高潮来奖励人们。巴菲特先生一开始可能有一点运气，但一生的投资成功表明他已经最大限度地利用了运气。&lt;span data-ornament=&quot;ufinish&quot;>;■&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;b>;阅读我们的管理和工作专栏作家 Bartleby 的更多内容：&lt;/b>;&lt;br/>;&lt;i>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.com/business/2023/10/12/Trialling-the- two-day-workweek&quot;

/div>;&lt;p>;食品工业是英国制造业的最大组成部分，几乎占总产量的四分之一，尽管政治家和电视记者在参观工厂时通常更喜欢戴安全帽而不是发网。其中大部分一直依赖国内劳动力、供应商和销售，因此，尽管英国脱欧使新鲜农产品的招聘和出口变得更加棘手，但它并没有让大多数公司脱轨。有些甚至以牺牲&lt;小>;欧盟&lt;/小>;进口为代价来增加国内市场份额。与此同时，在价值链的顶端，在航空航天和制药等领域，企业往往拥有定价权来克服新贸易摩擦带来的额外负担。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;即使事实证明，其影响确实是可以控制的。对于大多数行业来说，老板们仍在抱怨 2016 年投票后的不确定性。一家中型企业的负责人认为，真正的风险从来不是大多数制造商会直接关门，而是未来的投资会流向其他地方。他警告说：“现在判断这种情况是否会发生还为时过早。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;许多制造商认为，近年来的成功是在政府政策的推动下实现的，而不是因为政府政策。这种抱怨不仅仅是英国脱欧。对于投资周期长的企业来说，政策稳定性至关重要，但政府在过去十年中推行了六种不同的产业战略，甚至使中期规划变得困难重重。 2021 年，聚集了政策制定者和老板的工业战略委员会被裁，实业家们对此感到难以置信。他们认为最近政府淡化 2050 年净零排放目标以及取消从伯明翰到曼彻斯特的高速铁路具有象征意义。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;英国制造业的长期衰落伴随着许多人的咬牙切齿。相比之下，它的悄然成功却很少引起人们的注意。应该归功于制造商，而不是部长。 &lt;span data-ornament=&quot;ufinish&quot;>;■&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;i>;有关英国重大新闻的更多专家分析，&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.com /newsletters/blighty&quot;>;注册&lt;/a>;

alt=&quot;&quot;/>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;p>;Deif 的父亲以装饰家具为生，他的儿子有时会帮忙。汗尤尼斯可能没有提供传统的职业道路，但它是巴勒斯坦斗争未来领导人的补习学校。德伊夫成长的过程中，距离两个后来成为政治重量级人物的人只有几米远。加沙哈马斯现任领导人叶海亚·辛瓦尔 (Yahya Sinwar) 就住在附近的一条小巷里。穆罕默德·达赫兰后来成为哈马斯的世俗竞争对手法塔赫的安全负责人，他住在另一间房子里。德伊夫从小就和两人是朋友，孩子们一起踢足球。据埃尔达尔称，在达兰的父亲抛弃他们后，辛瓦尔和达兰与其他朋友联合起来为达兰的家庭提供经济支持。&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div>;&lt;div id=&quot;econ-2&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/ div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;那时候，巴勒斯坦抵抗运动主要由法塔赫主导——哈马斯还不存在。年轻的德伊夫似乎并不是特别虔诚（据报道，他在大学时加入了一个喜剧剧团，并被昵称为“小丑”），很可能很容易跟随他儿时的朋友达兰加入民族主义团体。在亚西尔·阿拉法特的领导下，法塔赫因在 20 世纪 70 年代从附近的阿拉伯国家对以色列发动袭击而受到欢迎。最初，法塔赫拒绝承认以色列，主张在这片土地上建立一个民主的巴勒斯坦国，并让所有难民返回该国。但慢慢地，这些要求转向接受 1967 年战争前夕设定的边界。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;20 世纪 80 年代末，当 Deif 在加沙市伊斯兰大学学习化学时，被占领土的气氛接近沸点。占领看不到结束的迹象。在加沙境内，以色列定居点正在扩张：他们的游泳池激起了肮脏难民营居民的愤怒。 1987年12月，这种愤怒爆发了。年轻人开始向以色列坦克投掷石块，第一次起义或起义诞生了。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;cite>;Deif 的家人来自耶路撒冷上方的山顶。当他出生时，他们住在沙子上的铁皮棚屋里，周围都是未经处理的污水流&lt;/cite>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;民众愤怒的力量和蔓延的速度让该地区的每个人都感到愤怒。惊喜。穆斯林兄弟会是 20 世纪初在埃及成立的致力于社会伊斯兰化的运动，它担心自己会变得无关紧要。起义开始后不久，加沙的一名隶属于兄弟会的巴勒斯坦神职人员创立了伊斯兰抵抗运动，该运动以其阿拉伯文缩写哈马斯而闻名。该组织的创始章程充满了狂热的反犹太主义，引用了先知穆罕默德的一句话：“除非穆斯林与犹太人作战（杀死犹太人），否则审判日不会到来”。据加沙市的一名哈马斯官员称，德伊夫在几周后加入了该运动。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;目前尚不清楚新组织将采取何种抵抗行动。该组织的创始人谢赫·艾哈迈德·亚辛 (Sheikh Ahmed Yassin) 是一位截瘫盲人，他管理着该地区最大的福利组织之一，尽管他的精神风度掩盖了他冷血地支持谋杀手段的意愿。最初，亚辛似乎对达瓦更感兴趣，让巴勒斯坦人回归伊斯兰教，而不是攻击以色列。以色列军方官员认为，哈马斯成员的宗教信仰是法塔赫活动人士民族主义的替代选择。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;哈马斯已经一年多没有在以色列开展武装行动了。然后，在1989年2月，它绑架并杀害了两名以色列士兵。作为回应，以色列围捕了数百名哈马斯成员和支持者，其中包括代夫。在接下来的 16 个月里，他未经审判就被监禁。在监狱里，他与其他囚犯讨论了这一新兴运动的未来。他们应该优先考虑达瓦还是圣战、武装抵抗？&lt;/p>;&lt;figure>;&lt;span itemscope=&quot;&quot;

Deif, then aged 30, was named his successor. Apparently he never used a mobile again. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The military wing Deif inherited was little more than a terrorist group consisting of a few hundred part-timers. He set about turning it into what one Hamas politician describes as an “army”. He organised loose collections of cells into military units and launched effective recruitment drives. He was even able to poach disaffected militants from Fatah.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;cite>;Deif joined a comedy-theatre troupe at university, and was nicknamed “the clown”&lt;/cite>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Fatah shed popularity during the second half of the 1990s. In 1993 Arafat had signed the Oslo accords, agreeing to recognise Israel in exchange for the establishment of a Palestinian “authority” (rather than a state). The authority was given limited autonomy over a fraction of historic Palestine. Disaffected Palestinians came to see the Palestinian Authority as Israel&#39;s policeman, as well as being self-serving and corrupt. Hamas&#39;s ranks meanwhile were swelling. By the start of the 2000s, Deif had over 1,500 men under his command (he was estimated to have up to 40,000 shortly before October&#39;s attacks). &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In the late 1990s and the early 2000s Hamas spent almost as much time on its rivalry with Fatah as it did confronting the Israelis. Events fell into a pattern: Fatah&#39;s leaders tried to get somewhere with negotiations, the Israeli government would build more settlements in the occupied territories (the number of settlers in the West Bank has quadrupled since Oslo), Hamas would send its suicide-bombers into Israel, and ordinary people on both sides would lose faith in the peace process. Israel demanded that Fatah arrest Hamas members, and it was the job of Dahlan, Deif&#39;s childhood friend, to enforce this. (Dahlan is reported to have imprisoned Deif for a while but allowed him to leave in the evenings.)&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In 2000 a second intifada broke out. This time Fatah backed its own militant network, a decision its leaders later came to rue. The intifada lasted until 2005 when Israel unilaterally withdrew from Gaza, without negotiations. This was a boost for Hamas, but the abandonment of the political process dashed lingering hopes of a Palestinian state along the lines promised in Oslo were dashed. The conflict was even further from being resolved. “Today you are leaving hell,” said Deif in a farewell communiqué to the Israelis. “But we promise you that tomorrow all Palestine will be hell for you, God willing.&lt;/p>;&lt;figure>;&lt;span itemscope=&quot;&quot; itemProp=&quot;image&quot; itemType=&quot;https://schema.org/ImageObject&quot;>;&lt;meta itemProp=&quot;url&quot; content=&quot;https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/1000/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231020_1843_DEIF_04.jpg&quot;/>;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; height=&quot;1000&quot; src=&quot;https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/1000/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231020_1843_DEIF_04.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/200/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231020_1843_DEIF_04.jpg 200w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/300/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231020_1843_DEIF_04.jpg 300w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/400/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231020_1843_DEIF_04.jpg 400w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/600/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231020_1843_DEIF_04.jpg 600w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/640/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231020_1843_DEIF_04.jpg 640w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/800/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231020_1843_DEIF_04.jpg 800w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/1000/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231020_1843_DEIF_04.jpg 1000w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1280/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231020_1843_DEIF_04.jpg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;p>;”Throughout the depressing collapse of the Oslo process, Deif&#39;s defiance and slipperiness made him something of a folk hero on the Palestinian street. Other Hamas leaders were killed: Ahmed Yassin was assassinated in his wheelchair by a helicopter gunship in 2004. Within months the Israelis killed his successor, Abdel Aziz al-Rantissi. But Deif eluded them. Palestinians dubbed him “al-Shabah”, the phantom. Even an Israeli intelligence official described his survival skills as “legendary”. Deif insisted that he wanted a martyr&#39;s death but that angels kept protecting him.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;He wasn&#39;t unscathed. Israel fired Hellfire missiles from helicopters at him in 2001 and again the following year. The second attack destroyed his car and killed two bodyguards as he was driving through Gaza city. He crawled away, having lost an eye, an arm and a leg. But the injuries only added to the mystique. The wheelchair they confined him to evoked memories of Yassin, Hamas&#39;s founder. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In 2006 Deif was visiting a lecturer from his old university when an Israeli F-16 dropped a one-tonne bomb on the academic&#39;s home, according to Eldar. Deif survived, but was forced to surrender command of the military wing after shrapnel lodged in his skull. He went to Egypt for three months of treatment and, it is said, still takes tranquillisers every day to treat crippling headaches.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;His absence coincided with a new era of Hamas&#39;s rule. Hamas politicians won a Palestinian election in January 2006, giving the movement its first chance to govern. Having campaigned on a platform of fighting corruption and delivering better public services, they set about creating what they saw as a model Islamic society in the ruins of Gaza. Morality squads took precedence over the armed struggle. Hamas leaders, enjoying the perks of office, began driving around in Mercedes cars. They didn&#39;t hold another election.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;cite>;“Today you are leaving hell,” said Deif in a farewell communiqué to the Israelis. “But we promise you that tomorrow all Palestine will be hell for you”&lt;/cite>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Deif had no interest in any of this. For him, Gaza was a bridgehead for the next assault. He didn&#39;t want Hamas&#39;s military wing restrained; his supporters argued that power and money were distracting the movement.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Also irking him was the de facto head of Hamas&#39;s military wing, who had taken over in 2003 after the various attempts on Deif&#39;s life. Ahmed Jaabari was a very different character to Deif. He mixed with Gaza&#39;s well-to-do and lived in a neighbourhood seen as fancy by local standards. Rather than unite Palestinian forces against Israel, which was what Deif wanted to do, Jaabari used Hamas&#39;s military wing to force Fatah out of Gaza. More than a hundred people were killed in the ensuing fighting; Hamas operatives threw one of Fatah&#39;s cooks off the roof of a building with his hands and legs tied. Jaabari then put the militants to work acting as his internal security apparatus, and digging tunnels to Egypt to bring in the goods Israel barred. Within three years, the tunnels were large enough to accommodate juggernauts. Critics complained that Jaabari pocketed the customs duties, and ran a sideline in luxury goods. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Jaabari spoke Hebrew from his 13 years in an Israeli jail and thought he could deal with Israelis. He repeatedly headed to Egypt to negotiate with them on ceasefires, while Egyptian intermediaries shuttled between the two sides&#39; hotel rooms. He was particularly focused on getting the Israelis to lift the blockade they had imposed on Gaza in 2007. In 2011 he pulled off a staggeringly beneficial prisoner swap in which one captured Israeli soldier, Gilad Shalit, was exchanged for more than a thousand Palestinian inmates, among them Sinwar.&lt;/p>;&lt;figure>;&lt;span itemscope=&quot;&quot; itemProp=&quot;image&quot; itemType=&quot;https://schema.org/ImageObject&quot;>;&lt;meta itemProp=&quot;url&quot; content=&quot;https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/1000/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231020_1843_DEIF_06.jpg&quot;/>;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; height=&quot;1000&quot; src=&quot;https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/1000/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231020_1843_DEIF_06.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/200/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231020_1843_DEIF_06.jpg 200w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/300/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231020_1843_DEIF_06.jpg 300w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/400/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231020_1843_DEIF_06.jpg 400w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/600/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231020_1843_DEIF_06.jpg 600w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/640/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231020_1843_DEIF_06.jpg 640w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/800/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231020_1843_DEIF_06.jpg 800w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/1000/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231020_1843_DEIF_06.jpg 1000w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1280/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231020_1843_DEIF_06.jpg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;p>;But some feared he was diluting Hamas&#39;s goals in the process. The politicians floated not just tahdias, or short-term ceasefires, with Israel but also hudnas: long-term truces. Some spoke of limiting their aspirations for a Palestinian state to the West Bank and Gaza, and co-existing with Israel. Some Hamas members began to forget they were at war. In 2012 Jaabari, then in the middle of contemplating a permanent truce with Israel, was carelessly driving through Gaza city when an Israeli missile struck his air-conditioned Kia sedan.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-caps=&quot;initial&quot;>;&lt;span data-caps=&quot;initial&quot;>;J&lt;/span>;aabari&#39;s assassination changed everything. Shortly afterwards Hamas renewed indiscriminate rocket attacks against its enemy and Israeli forces unleashed devastating air strikes on Gaza. Deif returned as commander-in-chief and shifted the pendulum back to armed struggle. Gone was the talk from the political leadership of “moving from armed to non-violent resistance”. For all their investment in bureaucracy, government and truce negotiations, Hamas politicians had failed to achieve anything that improved the lives of Palestinians. All they had succeeded in doing was creating another Middle East autocracy. Bombs destroyed what they built. Israel maintained a punishing blockade by land and sea, tightly restricting the entry of goods. Only force, Deif argued in his communiqués, would change the equation. Israel&#39;s leaders seemed equally uninterested in a political approach. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Instead of building vulnerable structures above ground, Deif channelled his efforts beneath the surface. He had started the tunnel network after Yassin was assassinated in 2004 to try and provide leaders with discreet escape routes, but Jaabari had commercialised it. Once back in charge Deif returned to his original project, dubbed the City of Tunnels.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;cite>;By the time Deif was done rebuilding the military wing, his arsenal could reach most of Israel&lt;/cite>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In the tunnels, some of which were are said to be 100 metres beneath the ground, Hamas could move around the strip, conduct training exercises and test weapons without being seen by Israel&#39;s drones. The network was used to store copious amounts of weapons, and facilitate the import of more from Iran and other allies. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;It&#39;s not clear why the armed movement gained so much capacity under Deif. One theory is that he was more willing to accept outside help than others in the movement. While Jaabari was in charge of Hamas&#39;s military wing, Deif, no longer needed for day-to-day operational activities, would travel around the Middle East soliciting foreign support.&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div>;&lt;div id=&quot;econ-4&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Some in Hamas opposed accepting money from Iran, arguing that it threatened the movement&#39;s independence. Deif disagreed, and Iran is now estimated to contribute at least $100ma year to Hamas&#39;s coffers. Qassem Suleimani, the mastermind behind Iran&#39;s network of regional militias, is said to have advised Deif on the Gaza tunnel network – among militants there is even a myth that he visited it in person. According to the leader of another Palestinian armed group in Gaza, the Iranians not only supplied Deif with missiles but trained Gazans to manufacture their own. In 2005 Hamas&#39;s rockets had a maximum range of 15km. By the time Deif was done rebuilding the military wing, his arsenal could reach most of Israel.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Deif had the chance to put his new systems to the test in July 2014 when another war broke out. The immediate cause was Israel&#39;s arrest of hundreds of Hamas activists in the West Bank after the killing of three Israeli teenagers there. But the background was Gaza. Israel had promised to lift the blockade after the last bout of fighting. Two years on it was as stifling as ever – and Gaza was even more dilapidated and depressed. Israel, for its part, was unnerved by Deif&#39;s military build-up. After bombarding Gaza for a week they sent in troops vowing to destroy Hamas&#39;s tunnel system and rocket arsenal. &lt;/p>;&lt;figure>;&lt;span itemscope=&quot;&quot; itemProp=&quot;image&quot; itemType=&quot;https://schema.org/ImageObject&quot;>;&lt;meta itemProp=&quot;url&quot; content=&quot;https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/1000/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231020_1843_DEIF_05.jpg&quot;/>;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; height=&quot;1000&quot; src=&quot;https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/1000/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231020_1843_DEIF_05.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/200/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231020_1843_DEIF_05.jpg 200w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/300/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231020_1843_DEIF_05.jpg 300w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/400/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231020_1843_DEIF_05.jpg 400w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/600/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231020_1843_DEIF_05.jpg 600w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/640/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231020_1843_DEIF_05.jpg 640w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/800/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231020_1843_DEIF_05.jpg 800w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/1000/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231020_1843_DEIF_05.jpg 1000w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1280/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231020_1843_DEIF_05.jpg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;p>;The war was the deadliest Gaza had yet seen. Deif issued a communiqué in the middle of it, goading Israel (“You&#39;ll never feel secure, as long as Palestinians can&#39;t live in peace”), but the Israelis managed to bomb his home, killing his seven-month-old son, his three-year-old daughter and his wife. He is thought not to have attended their funeral. When a ceasefire took hold seven weeks later 2,300 Palestinians were dead and more than 10,000 injured, a third of them children. Deif however had shown that Hamas was back as a fighting force. He had fought the Middle East&#39;s most powerful army for 50 days, and at the end of it he still controlled Gaza. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;For a brief while, the moderates in Hamas&#39;s political wing tried to stay in the game. In 2017 the organisation changed its charter, deleting much of the anti-Semitic language and vitriol that had populated the original one. But around that time, Deif&#39;s old friend Yahya Sinwar was put in charge of Hamas in Gaza. The hardliners were running the show. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Islamic rule eased up: clandestine armed struggle was once again the priority. The morality police established by Sinwar&#39;s predecessors no longer harried unveiled women. Municipal projects no longer mattered either. “They never built a hospital or a school,” said one Palestinian academic. “They just prioritise weapons.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;”Increasingly Deif looked beyond Gaza. The expansion of Israeli settlements in occupied territory in the West Bank had accelerated, particularly around the Haram al-Sharif compound. The area, which contains the al-Aqsa mosque, is holy to both Muslims and Jews, who call it the Temple Mount. Israel&#39;s security forces had also begun evicting Palestinians from East Jerusalem&#39;s most prosperous district, Sheikh Jarrah, to make way for more settlers. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;cite>;The attack killed his seven-month-old son, his three-year-old daughter and his wife. He is thought not to have attended their funeral&lt;/cite>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In May 2021 Deif issued another communiqué. If Israel did not withdraw its forces from al-Aqsa&#39;s compound and halt its evictions in Sheikh Jarrah, Hamas would strike. Hamas was “watching closely to what is happening in the neighbourhood,” he warned, predicting Israel would not listen. Days later the rockets flew and another conflict ensued. This one however was shorter and more contained than the war of 2014. Afterwards Gaza was surprisingly quiet. Israeli security experts felt that Hamas had been constrained, noting that it had stopped Islamic Jihad from firing rockets into Israel after the war ended. Some even predicted Hamas would become a more effective version of the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank: a way for the Israelis to outsource security. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;We now know that Israel was being lulled into complacency. Deif was merely biding his time. Palestinians looked destined to be trapped beneath ever-expanding settlements and economic blockades, the promise of their own state forgotten. Arab governments were starting to accept this and forge closer economic and even diplomatic ties with Israel. Deif&#39;s decision to commit mass murder in Israel on October 7th has invited a furious military response, which may well result in his own death. But it did create turmoil across the whole region and put Palestine at the top of the global agenda – which, as Deif made clear from his last communiqué, was one of Hamas&#39;s goals.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The inevitable suffering of ordinary Palestinians – the deaths of hundreds of children – do not hold much weight in Deif&#39;s decision-making. For men such as him, staying alive is not really the point. “How many have to die in this conflict?” I remember asking a veteran Hamas leader one afternoon as we sat in his garden in Gaza city a few years ago, the buzz of a nearby drone filling the air. Ten thousand Palestinians? Twenty thousand? Thirty thousand? He smiled and flicked the question away with his wrist as if it were a fly. In the grand sweep of historical struggles for freedom, he said, such suffering passes. “A small price.” &lt;span data-ornament=&quot;ufinish&quot;>;■&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;b>;Nicolas Pelham&lt;/b>; is The Economist&#39;s Middle East correspondent&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Additional reporting by Gareth Browne&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;small>;ILLUSTRATIONS: &lt;b>;DEBORAH STEVENSON&lt;/b>;&lt;/small>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;small>;Source images: Getty&lt;/small>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 22 Oct 2023 14:27:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Why big oil is beefing up its trading arms | Business]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/business/2023/10/19/why-big-oil-is-beefing-up-its-trading-arms]]><description> &lt;img src=&quot;https://images.weserv.nl/?url=www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/media-assets/image/20231021_WBD002.jpg&quot;/>;&lt;div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-caps=&quot;initial&quot;>;&lt;span data-caps=&quot;initial&quot;>;I&lt;/span>;&lt;small>;N THE&lt;/small>; 1950&lt;small>;s&lt;/small>; the oil market was in the gift of the “Seven Sisters”.这些西方巨头公司控制着全球85%的原油储量，以及从油井到泵的整个生产过程。他们固定价格并瓜分市场。在氏族之外进行石油贸易几乎是不可能的。到了 20 世纪 70 年代，这种统治地位被彻底打破。阿拉伯石油禁运、波斯湾石油生产国有化以及嘉能可、维多和托克等海盗贸易公司的到来，导致姐妹党失去了影响力。到 1979 年，独立交易商负责世界五分之二的石油交易。 &lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;figure>;&lt;div>;&lt;figcaption>;Listen to this story.&lt;/figcaption>; &lt;span>;Enjoy more audio and podcasts on&lt;!-- -->; &lt;a id=&quot;audio-ios-cta&quot; href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttps://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/bed1b25&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;>;iOS&lt;/a>; &lt;!-- -->;or&lt;!-- -->; &lt;a id=&quot;audio-android-cta&quot; href=&quot;https://www.economist.comhttps://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/7f3c199&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;>;Android&lt;/a>;.&lt;/span>;&lt;/div>;&lt;audio controls=&quot;&quot; id=&quot;audio-player&quot; preload=&quot;none&quot; src=&quot;https://www.economist.com/media-assets/audio/064%20Business%20-%20Big%20oil-11d8139f1dbfc7fdfcae69f7bf6f5439.mp3&quot; title=&quot;Why big oil is beefing up its trading arms&quot; controlsList=&quot;nodownload&quot;>;&lt;p>;Your browser does not support the &amp;lt;audio&amp;gt; element.&lt;/p>;&lt;/audio>;&lt;div>;&lt;div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;figure>;&lt;span itemscope=&quot;&quot; itemProp=&quot;image&quot; itemType=&quot;https://schema.org/ImageObject&quot; data-slim=&quot;1&quot;>;&lt;meta itemProp=&quot;url&quot; content=&quot;https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/739/90/media-assets/image/20231021_WBC097.png&quot;/>;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/739/90/media-assets/image/20231021_WBC097.png&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/243/90/media-assets/image/20231021_WBC097.png 200w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/365/90/media-assets/image/20231021_WBC097.png 300w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/486/90/media-assets/image/20231021_WBC097.png 400w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/729/90/media-assets/image/20231021_WBC097.png 600w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/778/90/media-assets/image/20231021_WBC097.png 640w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/972/90/media-assets/image/20231021_WBC097.png 800w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/1215/90/media-assets/image/20231021_WBC097.png 1000w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1556/90/media-assets/image/20231021_WBC097.png 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;336px&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;p>;The world is in turmoil again—and not only because the conflict between Israel and Hamas is at risk of escalating dangerously.俄罗斯在乌克兰的战争、西方与中国之间的地缘政治紧张局势以及全球遏制气候变化的努力都断断续续地给石油市场带来了波动（见图1）。奥纬咨询 (Oliver Wyman) 的数据显示，在不确定时期蓬勃发展的大宗商品交易商的毛利润在 2022 年增长了 60%，达到 1150 亿美元。 Yet this time it is not the upstarts that have been muscling in. It is the descendants of the Seven Sisters and their fellow oil giants, which see trading as an ever-bigger part of their future.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The companies do not like to talk about this part of their business.他们的交易员的利润隐藏在组织的其他部分。首席执行官们回避了刺探的问题。他们说，打开账本可能会向竞争对手泄露太多信息。但与分析师和业内人士的对话描绘了一幅庞大而复杂的业务的图景，而且这些业务的规模和复杂程度都在不断增长。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In February ExxonMobil, America&#39;s mightiest supermajor, which abandoned large-scale trading two decades ago, announced it was giving it another go.海湾国家的国营石油巨头也参与其中：沙特阿美公司、阿布扎比国家石油公司和卡塔尔能源公司正在扩大其交易业务，以跟上超级石油巨头的步伐。但贸易野心最为宏大的却是欧洲石油巨头。 &lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;div>;&lt;div id=&quot;econ-1&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;figure>;&lt;span itemscope=&quot;&quot; itemProp=&quot;image&quot; itemType=&quot;https://schema.org/ImageObject&quot; data-slim=&quot;1&quot;>;&lt;meta itemProp=&quot;url&quot; content=&quot;https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/662/90/media-assets/image/20231021_WBC081.png&quot;/>;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/662/90/media-assets/image/20231021_WBC081.png&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/218/90/media-assets/image/20231021_WBC081.png 200w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/327/90/media-assets/image/20231021_WBC081.png 300w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/436/90/media-assets/image/20231021_WBC081.png 400w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/653/90/media-assets/image/20231021_WBC081.png 600w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/697/90/media-assets/image/20231021_WBC081.png 640w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/871/90/media-assets/image/20231021_WBC081.png 800w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/1089/90/media-assets/image/20231021_WBC081.png 1000w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1394/90/media-assets/image/20231021_WBC081.png 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;336px&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;p>;&lt;small>;BP&lt;/small>;, Shell and TotalEnergies have been silently expanding their trading desks since the early 2000s, says Jorge Léon of Rystad Energy, a consultancy.研究公司 Bernstein 估计，2023 年上半年，这三家公司的交易总计产生了 200 亿美元的毛利润。这比 2019 年同期增加了三分之二（见图 2），占总收入的五分之一，而四年前为七分之一。奥纬咨询估计，2016 年至 2022 年间，全球最大私营石油公司的交易员人数增加了 46%。其中大部分归功于欧洲三大石油公司。这些交易员中每一位的利润也比七年前增加了一倍半。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Today &lt;small>;BP&lt;/small>; employs 3,000 traders worldwide.据信，壳牌的交易员也有数千人，TotalEnergies 的交易员可能有 800 人。几乎可以肯定，这比托克 (Trafigura) 和维多 (Vitol) 等（同样羞涩的）独立交易商要多，后者的员工人数估计分别约为 1,200 人和 450 人（根据披露了作为公司股东的员工人数）。 It is probably no coincidence that &lt;small>;BP&lt;/small>;&#39;s head of trading, Carol Howle, is a frontrunner for the British company&#39;s top job, recently vacated by Bernard Looney.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The supermajors&#39; trading desks are likely to stay busy for a while, because the world&#39;s energy markets look unlikely to calm down.正如托克 (Trafigura) 的萨阿德·拉希姆 (Saad Rahim) 所说，“我们正在从大宗商品周期的世界转向大宗商品飙升的世界。”而这样的世界正是交易者的梦想。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;One reason for the heightened volatility is intensifying geopolitical strife.以色列和巴勒斯坦之间的冲突只是最新的例子。另一个是乌克兰战争。 When last year Russia stopped pumping its gas west after the &lt;small>;EU&lt;/small>; imposed sanctions on it in the wake of its aggression, demand for liquefied natural gas (&lt;small>;LNG&lt;/small>;) rocketed.欧洲超级大国的贸易部门也在急于填补这一缺口，并在此过程中大赚一笔。 They raked in a combined $15bn from trading &lt;small>;LNG&lt;/small>; last year, accounting for around two-fifths of their trading profits, according to Bernstein. &lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;div>;&lt;div id=&quot;econ-2&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;This could be just the beginning.咨询公司麦肯锡最近的一份报告模拟了碳氢化合物区域贸易集团出现的情景。俄罗斯的燃料将向东流向中国、印度和土耳其，而不是向西流向欧洲。与此同时，中国正试图将海湾地区强大的生产商从美国及其盟友手中夺走。 All that is creating vast arbitrage opportunities for traders.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Another reason to expect persistent volatility is climate change.气温升高、海平面上升和极端天气的结合将更频繁地扰乱化石燃料的供应。 2021 年，德克萨斯州的一场寒流导致美国近 40% 的石油产量在两周内停产。风险咨询公司 Verisk Maplecroft 表示，全球约 30% 的石油和天然气储量面临类似气候破坏的“高风险”。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Then there is the energy transition, which is meant to avert even worse climate extremes.从长远来看，绿色能源系统很可能比当今基于化石燃料的能源系统波动性更小。它将更加分散，从而减少集中在世界不稳定地区的少数生产商手中。但从现在到气候友好型未来的道路充满了不确定性。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Some governments and activist shareholders are pressing oil companies, especially in Europe, to reduce their fossil-fuel wagers. Rystad Energy估计，部分原因是今年全球石油和天然气生产投资将达到5400亿美元，比2014年的峰值下降35%。与此同时，石油需求继续上升。 “这会给系统带来压力，”麦肯锡的罗兰·雷希斯坦纳 (Roland Rechtsteiner) 说。 &lt;/p>;&lt;h2>;Future traders&lt;/h2>;&lt;p>;This presents opportunities for traders, and not just in oil.雷希施泰纳先生指出，对可再生能源进行大量投资而不同时增加输电容量也会造成瓶颈。 In Britain, Italy and Spain more than 150-gigawatts&#39;-worth of wind and solar power, equivalent to 83% of the three countries&#39; total existing renewables capacity, cannot come online because their grids cannot handle it, says Bloomberg&lt;small>;NEF&lt;/small>;, a research firm. Traders cannot build grids, but they can help ease gridlock by helping channel resources to their most profitable use.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Europe&#39;s three oil supermajors are already dealing in electric power and carbon credits, as well as a lot more gas, which as the least grubby of fossil fuels is considered essential to the energy transition.去年，进行此类交易的交易者数量是 2016 年的两倍。奥纬咨询 (Oliver Wyman) 的恩斯特·弗兰克尔 (Ernst Frankl) 估计，在此期间，他们产生的毛利润从 60 亿美元增至 300 亿美元。接下来可能会出现其他绿色商品。 David Knipe, a former head of trading at &lt;small>;BP&lt;/small>; now at Bain, a consultancy, expects some of the majors to start trading lithium, a metal used in battery-making.如果氢经济如许多石油巨头所希望的那样起飞，这将提供另一种东西，不仅可以生产，还可以买卖。 &lt;span data-ornament=&quot;ufinish&quot;>;■&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;i>;To stay on top of the biggest stories in business and technology, sign up to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.com/newsletters/the-bottom-line&quot;>;Bottom Line&lt;/a>;, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter.&lt;/i>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 22 Oct 2023 12:57:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[This week’s covers | The world this week]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/the-world-this-week/2023/10/19/this-weeks-covers]]><description> &lt;img src=&quot;https://images.weserv.nl/?url=www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/media-assets/image/20230218_BLP902.jpg&quot;/>;&lt;div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-caps=&quot;initial&quot;>;&lt;span data-caps=&quot;initial&quot;>;T&lt;/span>;&lt;small>;HIS WEEK WE &lt;/small>;have one cover, on the daunting challenges in Gaza: the destruction, the obstacles a ground invasion will face and the options for the territory&#39;s long-term future.赌注再高不过了。加沙一家医院发生毁灭性爆炸后，阿拉伯国家纷纷谴责以色列。全副武装的黎巴嫩民兵真主党正一步步接近与以色列的全面战争。只有美国才能把中东从悬崖边拉回来。 &lt;/p>;&lt;figure>;&lt;span itemscope=&quot;&quot; itemProp=&quot;image&quot; itemType=&quot;https://schema.org/ImageObject&quot;>;&lt;meta itemProp=&quot;url&quot; content=&quot;https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1684/90/media-assets/image/20231021_DE_UK.jpg&quot;/>;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; width=&quot;1280&quot; height=&quot;1684&quot; src=&quot;https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1684/90/media-assets/image/20231021_DE_UK.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/263/90/media-assets/image/20231021_DE_UK.jpg 200w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/395/90/media-assets/image/20231021_DE_UK.jpg 300w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/526/90/media-assets/image/20231021_DE_UK.jpg 400w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/789/90/media-assets/image/20231021_DE_UK.jpg 600w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/842/90/media-assets/image/20231021_DE_UK.jpg 640w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/1053/90/media-assets/image/20231021_DE_UK.jpg 800w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/1316/90/media-assets/image/20231021_DE_UK.jpg 1000w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1684/90/media-assets/image/20231021_DE_UK.jpg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;p>;&lt;b>;Leader:&lt;/b>; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/10/19/the-stakes-could-hardly-be-higher-in-the-israel-gaza-conflict&quot;>;The stakes could hardly be higher in the Israel-Gaza conflict&lt;/a>;&lt;br/>;&lt;b>;Briefing:&lt;/b>; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/10/19/as-israels-invasion-of-gaza-ne&quot;>;As Israel&#39;s invasion of Gaza nears, the obstacles get more daunting&lt;/a>;&lt;br/>;&lt;b>;Briefing:&lt;/b>; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/10/19/israels-four-unpalatable-options-for-gazas-long-term-future&quot;>;Israel&#39;s four unpalatable options for Gaza&#39;s long-term future&lt;/a>;&lt;br/>;&lt;b>;Graphic Detail:&lt;/b>; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.com/interactive/briefing/2023/10/17/israel-gaza-map-hamas-war&quot;>;Mapping Israel&#39;s war in Gaza&lt;/a>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 22 Oct 2023 12:57:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Max Verstappen’s brilliance is hurting Formula One | Culture]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/culture/2023/10/20/max-verstappens-brilliance-is-hurting-formula-one]]><description> &lt;img src=&quot;https://images.weserv.nl/?url=www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/media-assets/image/20231021_BLP509.jpg&quot;/>;&lt;div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-caps=&quot;initial&quot;>;&lt;span data-caps=&quot;initial&quot;>;D&lt;/span>;&lt;small>;AVID “CROFTY” CROFT&lt;/small>;, one of Formula One&#39;s (&lt;small>;F1&lt;/small>;&#39;s) best-known broadcasters, had had enough. On October 8th Max Verstappen, a Dutch driver, claimed a third drivers&#39; championship at the Qatar Grand Prix with six races to spare. Many fans say they are bored. Crofty, though, believes the problem lies with the sport&#39;s whinging new-age fans. If the spectacle of the world&#39;s premier motorsport is something you find boring, he ranted on a podcast, “I can&#39;t help you. I really can&#39;t.” Look at the spectacle of the sport, he pleaded: “The sight of cars going at 200mph- [323kph-] plus…in the hands of some of the most talented human beings ever to grab hold of a steering wheel.” &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Crofty is partly correct. The drivers&#39; talents are extraordinary. But the true thrill of &lt;small>;F1&lt;/small>; lies in the competition between drivers. And on that measure the past two seasons have been mundane. In 2022 Mr Verstappen won 15 of 22 races; this year he has already won 14 of 17. Between May and September he took ten consecutive chequered flags, a new record. At the age of 26 he is already fifth in the ranking of drivers with most wins. &lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div>;&lt;div id=&quot;econ-1&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Much of that is down to Mr Verstappen&#39;s skill. Since becoming the youngest-ever &lt;small>;F1&lt;/small>; driver at the age of 17, Mr Verstappen has honed his natural talent to achieve complete mastery of the wheel. The engineering prowess of his team, Red Bull, has also made the most of his skills. Other teams have simply been unable to match the pace and consistency of Red Bull&#39;s car, comprising an ultra-reliable power unit and a remarkably light chassis. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The Verstappen-Red Bull supremacy has meant that some of this season&#39;s most memorable moments have been unrelated to racing. In Qatar, where the temperature inside cars neared 50°C, one driver almost passed out; another vomited inside his helmet. In Singapore in September Aston Martin&#39;s Fernando Alonso drove over a lizard.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Uncompetitive championships are nothing new. Before Mr Verstappen&#39;s breakthrough, Lewis Hamilton and his Mercedes team won four titles in a row. In the early 2000s, Michael Schumacher won five consecutive titles with Ferrari. But the recent spell of boredom has come at a particularly unfortunate time. Over the past few years the sport has gained many new fans, particularly from America. They have been drawn in by “Drive to Survive”, a newish &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.com/culture/2023/03/03/does-the-netflixisation-of-sport-spoil-the-action&quot;>;Netflix series&lt;/a>; that ushers them behind the scenes, showing them the sport&#39;s quirky personalities and political infighting. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;This year, though, the new fans have not been entertained. The audience for the broadcast of the Miami Grand Prix in May by ABC, an American network, was 25% smaller than it was last year. Social media are another way to measure fan sentiment. &lt;small>;F1&lt;/small>; engagement fell by 70.2% in the first five months of 2023, according to Buzz Radar, a social-media research firm. Terms like “boring” and “annoying” replaced “exciting” and “interesting” on many feeds. &lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div>;&lt;div id=&quot;econ-2&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;All this will be particularly disappointing to organisers who have tried hard, at some cost, to turbo-charge &lt;small>;F1&lt;/small>;&#39;s entertainment value. In 2021 they introduced a new format: drivers participate in occasional sprint races, shortened versions of the main event. Organisers have added full-length races, including two in America. (Next season will have 24 such races, up from 22 in 2021.) The expansion, though, adds to pressure to build and retain audiences: the average cost for organisers putting on a race is roughly $33m.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;No change of formats can replace the drama provided by tightly contested racing. When the scrap for the 2021 championship between Mr Verstappen and Mr Hamilton came down to the final corner on the final lap of the final race, more than 108m people tuned in. That is one of the biggest audiences the sport has ever attracted. But replicating such competition is difficult. &lt;small>;F1 &lt;/small>;officials can only influence so much on the track. The reality remains that Red Bull are a great team with a brilliant car made almost unbeatable by a genius driver. The competition is faltering. Mercedes are struggling to build a competitive car; Ferrari have problems with leadership. Until that changes, &lt;small>;F1&lt;/small>; fans will simply have to entertain themselves with Max Verstappen&#39;s prodigious talent. &lt;span data-ornament=&quot;ufinish&quot;>;■&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 22 Oct 2023 04:27:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Are artificial wombs the future? | Films]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/films/2023/10/19/are-artificial-wombs-the-future]]><description> &lt;img src=&quot;https://images.weserv.nl/?url=www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/media-assets/image/20231019_FLP003.jpg&quot;/>;&lt;div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;iframe height=&quot;360&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/eAUdVXPkDE8?enablejsapi=1&quot;>;&lt;/iframe>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-caps=&quot;initial&quot;>;&lt;span data-caps=&quot;initial&quot;>;A&lt;/span>;&lt;small>; team of&lt;/small>; &lt;small>;scientists&lt;/small>; and engineers from across Europe are hoping to build the world&#39;s first clinically approved artificial womb.

Fewer than 1% of Japan&#39;s 125m people live outside its five main islands, Honshu, Kyushu, Shikoku, Hokkaido and Okinawa. Remote islands make up about 2% of Japan&#39;s land mass. Yet they account for half of the exclusive economic zone (&lt;small>;EEZ&lt;/small>;) which helps Japan punch above its weight at sea: it is the world&#39;s 62nd-largest country yet has the sixth-largest marine area (see map). The combined coastlines of the &lt;i>;ritou&lt;/i>;, 20% of Japan&#39;s total, are longer than the whole of Brazil&#39;s. They are also storehouses of cultural and biological diversity.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Yet these quietly consequential islands face mounting pressures. On islands like Sado, off the northern coast of Honshu, or Rishiri, near Hokkaido, demographic change is hollowing out communities. Climate change threatens the already fragile supply chains of places like the Ogasawara, a group of islands halfway to Guam, which rely on ferries to connect them to the mainland. In the Nansei, the islands that stretch between Taiwan and Kyushu, residents are making flight plans in case of a war with China.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Remote islands closer to the mainlands have been Japanese for centuries. Visitors to Sado can find dozens of thatched-roof Noh theatres, a testament to the influence of Zeami Motokiyo, Noh&#39;s pre-eminent playwright, who was exiled to the island in the early 15th century. Those farther afield, including the Nansei, the Ogasawara and the islets around Hokkaido, are relatively recent additions. Incorporating them played a “crucial role in the Japanese nation-building process” of the mid-to-late 19th century, says Ishihara Shun of Meiji Gakuin University in Tokyo. Their strategic value came to the fore during the second world war, when Iwo To, a speck in the Ogasawara, became the site of a terrible, legendary battle. (Iwo Jima, its widely known anglicised name, resulted from a Japanese military mispronunciation.)&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;After the war, the &lt;i>;ritou&lt;/i>; struggled to keep up as Japan boomed. (The Nansei and the Ogasawara remained under American occupation for decades.) Many in Tokyo considered them an encumbrance. But perceptions changed as international maritime law evolved. In 1982, the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea granted states exclusive rights over marine resources extending 200 nautical miles (370km) beyond their territorial waters. That “changed the shape of the nation” and helped Japan become a “maritime great power”, says Iwashita Akihiro of Hokkaido University. The&lt;i>; ritou&lt;/i>; conferred it with vast fishing waters and undersea resources. &lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;div>;&lt;div id=&quot;econ-1&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Marine riches draw China&#39;s attention. Oil and gas reserves are one reason that it covets a group of uninhabited islands in the East China Sea that Japan controls and calls the Senkaku (China claims them and calls them the Diaoyu). Deposits of rare-earth minerals, perhaps equivalent to hundreds of years&#39; worth of global demand, have been discovered in hard-to-extract mud on the sea floor near Minamitorishima, which belongs to the Ogasawara; Chinese research ships have been spotted surveying the sea floor nearby. On distant Chichijima, the main island of the Ogasawara, locals recall with horror a night in 2014 when hundreds of large Chinese fishing boats descended on the island to harvest its coral. “The fact that China is interfering in these areas is a testament to their value,” says Itokazu Kenichi, the mayor of Yonaguni. China&#39;s threats to nearby Taiwan have also spurred Japan to reinforce defences on some remote islands in the south-west. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Yet the biggest challenge for most &lt;i>;ritou&lt;/i>; is a severe version of one that much of Japan faces: shrinking, ageing populations. “They cling to the memory of their golden age,” says Saito Jun, an author who has visited hundreds of islands. The population of remote islands shrank by nearly 60% between 1955 and 2010 (excluding those occupied by America). By contrast, Japan&#39;s overall population began declining only in 2008. On the 300-odd inhabited &lt;i>;ritou&lt;/i>; not linked to the mainland by bridge, 37% of the population was over 65 years old in 2020, compared with 29% nationally. If they were a prefecture, it would have been one of the most aged in the country. These trends worry security-conscious officials. “It&#39;s important that people live there—it serves to patrol the borders,” says Tsukamoto Kuniyoshi of the remote-islands department at the infrastructure ministry.&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div>;&lt;div id=&quot;econ-2&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Decades of state-backed investments have sought to make remote-island life more attractive. Yet health care remains far more precarious even than in rural areas on the mainland, acknowledges Kosaka Katsuya, a town-hall official on Rishiri. Locals there must trek to bigger islands to give birth; helicopters evacuate those who need emergency surgery. Many remote islands do not have high schools, and some are losing elementary and middle schools. Complex logistics mean higher prices for consumers. Businesses struggle with tiny local markets—some 70% of the &lt;i>;ritou&lt;/i>; have fewer than 500 inhabitants.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Many islands hope simply to arrest the slide. On Sado, the population of 49,000 is projected to drop to 19,000 by 2060; the local government&#39;s goal is to keep the decline to 30,000. Government subsidies aim to encourage migration to the island. But they are up against powerful social forces that are pushing young people away. “They hear from their parents and grandparents that there&#39;s no point in staying, that you should leave, go make it in Tokyo,” laments Watanabe Kazuya, a local official. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Remoteness is not in and of itself a death sentence. Take the Ogasawara, the most remote of all the inhabited &lt;i>;ritou&lt;/i>;, accessible only by a ferry that takes 24 hours to travel one way. The population has been stable for years; if anything, housing is in scarce supply. The internet keeps islanders connected to modern services; what cannot be found in the small handful of shops can be ordered from Amazon. Tropical weather, stunning vistas and an open-minded community attract many newcomers. For many of them, living so far off the map has its own wonderful appeal. &lt;span data-ornament=&quot;ufinish&quot;>;■&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 22 Oct 2023 00:27:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[American states wrestle with how to treat severe mental illness | United States]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/10/19/american-states-wrestle-with-how-to-treat-severe-mental-illness]]><description> &lt;img src=&quot;https://images.weserv.nl/?url=www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/media-assets/image/20231021_USD001.jpg&quot;/>;&lt;div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-caps=&quot;initial&quot;>;&lt;span data-caps=&quot;initial&quot;>;W&lt;/span>;&lt;small>;HEN AISLINN BIRD&lt;/small>; is not treating patients at her health clinic in downtown Oakland, she goes to see them where they live: in homeless encampments.

Two-thirds said they were currently struggling with a mental-health condition, ranging from anxiety to hallucinations. One third of respondents said they regularly use methamphetamine, which can cause psychosis akin to schizophrenia. This hazardous combination of drug use, mental illness and the physical hardship of sleeping rough has increased homeless deaths in big cities across the country. Some 2,200 homeless people died in &lt;small>;LA&lt;/small>; County in 2021, an increase of 70% from 2019. The daily tragedies playing out on America&#39;s streets are also changing the politics of homelessness in liberal states—and nowhere more than in California. &lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div>;&lt;div id=&quot;econ-1&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;A slate of reforms signed into law last week in California is meant to tackle this problem. Standing at a podium that read “Treatment not tents”, California&#39;s Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom, called the bills “a paradigm shift” and a message to voters that policymakers intend to clean up the streets. California&#39;s new laws also exemplify two broad shifts in mental health care in America: the building of more beds for patients suffering from mental illness and drug addiction, and an expansion of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.com/united-states/2022/12/19/is-forced-treatment-for-the-mentally-ill-ever-humane&quot;>;involuntary treatment&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;First, consider the billions that American states are pouring into facilities to treat and house mentally ill people. One bill Mr Newsom signed into law will put a $6.4bn bond measure to help build more than 10,000 treatment beds and housing units on the ballot for Californians to vote on in March. When asked what happens if Californians do not go for it, Mr Newsom told &lt;i>;The Economist&lt;/i>; that he cannot imagine it failing. His message to voters is “Vote no if you believe in the status quo.” Kathy Hochul, the governor of New York, set aside $1bn in her 2024 budget for psychiatric hospital beds and longer-term housing. The Texas legislature allocated some $2bn over the next two years to build and maintain mental-health hospitals. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;It is rare that Texas and California agree. But three things have raised the profile of mental health among Americans of all stripes: the anxiety and isolation many felt during the covid-19 pandemic; the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/08/24/the-rise-of-tranq-dope-is-making-americas-opioid-crisis-worse&quot;>;destruction opioids have wrought&lt;/a>;; and the visible suffering of unsheltered homeless people with mental illness. The need is also immense. The number of psychiatric beds per person in America is low compared with much of the &lt;small>;OECD&lt;/small>;, a club mostly of rich countries. America has less than half as many beds per person as France.&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div>;&lt;div id=&quot;econ-2&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Mr Newsom describes his overhaul as fulfilling a promise made by then-governor Ronald Reagan in the 1960s to replace overcrowded, often abusive state-run institutions with smaller, local facilities. Yet after Reagan, rightly, closed the asylums and expanded patients&#39; rights, he failed to fund community care. When Reagan became president, the country followed California down this road. But blaming Reagan ignores the nearly 50 years of inaction since he left Sacramento, the state capital. “The failure of successive state governments to uphold the community funding promise is one of the main reasons people are suffering so badly today,” says Darrell Steinberg, the current mayor of Sacramento and an advocate for reform. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The other striking feature in California is the expansion of involuntary treatment. Mr Newsom signed a law on October 10th, &lt;small>;SB&lt;/small>; 43, that loosens the criteria for people to be placed in a mental-health conservatorship, in which a person appointed by the state directs their care. Its passage follows the creation last year of &lt;small>;CARE&lt;/small>; Court, a programme that allows health workers, police and family members to enroll people with psychosis in court-mandated treatment. Alex Barnard of New York University, who is tracking state laws that expand forced treatment, finds that reforms are clustered in coastal Democratic states such as California, Oregon and Washington that are reckoning with very visible displays of mental illness among homeless people. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Growing anger from voters helps explain why Democratic politicians in liberal states are grasping for policies usually associated with law-and-order Republicans. Civil liberties and disability rights groups are fighting the political tide. They argue that &lt;small>;SB&lt;/small>; 43 and &lt;small>;CARE&lt;/small>; Court infringe on patients&#39; freedoms and bodily autonomy. Disability Rights California, a non-profit, worries that the laws will unfairly target black Californians, who are disproportionately represented among the state&#39;s homeless population, and will traumatise people. They have a point. The evidence for the efficacy of involuntary treatment is mixed. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“They&#39;re simply wrong,” Mr Newsom says of the civil-rights groups. “Look what&#39;s happening on the streets. It&#39;s night of the living dead in the Tenderloin in San Francisco...and people are dying.” He suggests that the extreme libertarianism displayed on the streets is an embarrassing abdication of state responsibility. To the governor and his allies, these new laws represent a move towards the centre and a recommitment to a social contract. To his opponents, they reek of state overreach. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Even while trumpeting the new laws, policymakers stress that involuntary treatment should remain a last resort. Their hope is that the expansion of beds makes it more likely that people suffering from mental illness get the level of care they need, and avoid languishing in jail or hospital for want of a safe alternative.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The neglect that California showed its most vulnerable when the institutions were closed is a prime example of good intentions gone wrong. Decades later, Mr Newsom hopes California can provide America with a model for how to fix things. He refers to the rest of his term as “the great implementation”. His focus on beds echoes those who spend the most time among homeless and mentally ill Californians. When asked what would make her job easier, Dr Bird laughs. Without any hesitation, she answers: “More housing.”&lt;span data-ornament=&quot;ufinish&quot;>;■&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;i>;Stay on top of American politics with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.com/newsletters/checks-and-balance&quot;>;Checks and Balance&lt;/a>;, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter, which examines the state of American democracy and the issues that matter to voters.&lt;/i>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 21 Oct 2023 22:27:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Biden pleads the case for Israel, Ukraine—and American leadership | United States]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/10/20/biden-pleads-the-case-for-israel-ukraine-and-american-leadership]]><description> &lt;img src=&quot;https://images.weserv.nl/?url=www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/media-assets/image/20231021_IRP503.jpg&quot;/>;&lt;div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-caps=&quot;initial&quot;>;&lt;span data-caps=&quot;initial&quot;>;W&lt;/span>;&lt;small>;ITH WAR &lt;/small>;raging in Israel as well as Ukraine, President Joe Biden made an impassioned plea for America to act again as “the arsenal of democracy” by providing tens of billions of dollars of military aid to both allies. He adapted the idea of America as the “indispensable nation”—a concept coined by the late secretary of state, Madeleine Albright—to cast the country as the “essential nation”, vital to holding back the forces of aggression, be they terrorists or bully states.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Mr Biden drew a direct connection between &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.com/israel-hamas&quot;>;Hamas&#39;s slaughter&lt;/a>; of Israeli communities on October 7th and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.com/ukraine-crisis&quot;>;Russia&#39;s invasion&lt;/a>; of Ukraine in February last year. “Hamas and Putin represent different threats, but they share this in common: they both want to completely annihilate a neighbouring democracy,” Mr Biden said in a televised address to Americans on October 19th. Another common thread, he noted, is that both foes are supported by Iran.&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div>;&lt;div id=&quot;econ-1&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;aside>;&lt;p>;Read more on the war between Israel and Hamas&lt;/p>;&lt;ul>;&lt;li>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/10/19/the-stakes-could-hardly-be-higher-in-the-israel-gaza-conflict&quot;>;Only America can save Israel and Gaza from greater catastrophe&lt;/a>;&lt;/li>;&lt;li>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/10/19/israels-four-unpalatable-options-for-gazas-long-term-future&quot;>;Israel&#39;s four unpalatable options for Gaza&#39;s long-term future&lt;/a>;&lt;/li>;&lt;li>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.com/israel-hamas&quot;>;All of our coverage on Israel and Hamas&lt;/a>;&lt;/li>;&lt;/ul>;&lt;/aside>;&lt;p>;Mr Biden was seeking to harness bipartisan sympathy for the Jewish state to reaffirm the United States&#39; global role. “American leadership is what holds the world together. American alliances are what keep us, America, safe,” he declared.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;He is also hoping the explosive crisis in the Middle East will bring a divided and paralysed Congress to its senses. It has been unable to pass bills because&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/10/19/americas-republicans-cannot-agree-on-a-speaker-good&quot;>; infighting among Republicans&lt;/a>; in the House of Representatives is preventing the election of a speaker. Mr Biden is reported to be preparing a request for roughly $100bn in supplemental funding for national-security priorities. If so, his calculation is that at least some sceptical Republicans will swallow the large pill of perhaps $60bn in additional aid for Ukraine by wrapping it in other causes they support more wholeheartedly—not least $10bn-14bn in aid to Israel, as well as help for Taiwan and funding to strengthen America&#39;s southern border. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Mr Biden was speaking a day after visiting Israel, where he sought to prevent the crisis from spiralling out of control. Hamas&#39;s onslaught killed about 1,400 Israelis, and led to the capture of over 200 hostages. More than 3,700 Palestinians have died in Israel&#39;s retribution against Hamas in the Gaza Strip. Israel has cut off supplies of food, water, fuel and electricity to Palestinians there. Both sides traded blame for an explosion at a hospital on October 17th that killed scores if not hundreds of people: Palestinians say it was caused by an Israeli strike; Israel contends it was the result of an errant Palestinian rocket. Mr Biden, for his part, was adamant that it “was not done by the Israelis”. &lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div>;&lt;div id=&quot;econ-2&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Amid anti-Israeli protests across the Arab world and beyond, “all the indications are that the worst is coming,” said Jordan&#39;s foreign minister, Ayman Safadi, at a press conference on October 19th. Despite Mr Biden&#39;s efforts, a promised humanitarian corridor between Egypt and the Gaza Strip has yet to open. America vetoed a UN Security Council resolution calling for a “humanitarian pause” in the fighting because it did not recognise Israel&#39;s right to defend itself. Israel&#39;s defence minister, Yoav Gallant, signalled that ground operations in Gaza, which may prove to be an even bloodier phase, would begin “soon”. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Signs are growing that Iran is pushing its proxies to expand the conflict. On Israel&#39;s northern border with Lebanon, Israeli forces and Hizbullah, a powerful Shia militia created by Iran, have been exchanging artillery and missile fire for days. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Meanwhile south of Israel, in the Red Sea, an American guided-missile destroyer, the &lt;i>;USS Carney&lt;/i>;, intercepted three cruise missiles and several drones launched by the Houthi militia in Yemen, another Iranian ally, towards targets assumed to be in Israel. The action on October 19th raises the prospect that the expanding fleet of American warships in the eastern Mediterranean—one American aircraft-carrier strike group has been deployed there and a second is on its way— may yet intervene if Israel and Hizbullah go to war. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Separately, American bases in Iraq and Syria have been repeatedly attacked with drones and rockets in recent days, according to the Pentagon. It did not identify the attackers, but they are likely to be pro-Iranian militias. “Any response, should one occur, will come at a time [and] in a manner of our choosing,” a spokesman said. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Despite growing left-wing protests, and the resignation of a State Department official, Mr Biden did not waver from his embrace of Israel. “We&#39;re going to make sure other hostile actors in the region know that Israel is stronger than ever—and prevent this conflict from spreading.” At the same time, though, he said Israel had to operate “by the laws of war” and protect civilians.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;He repeated the call he made in Israel, drawing from America&#39;s encounter with al-Qaeda&#39;s terrorism in 2001. “When America experienced the hell of 9/11 we felt enraged as well. While we sought and got justice, we made mistakes. So I caution the government of Israel not to be blinded by rage.” He also urged Israel not to “give up on peace” based on a two-state solution: that is, the creation of a Palestinian state. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Mr Biden&#39;s speech pinballed between Israel and Ukraine. Republicans, in particular, have grown increasingly sceptical of the cost of supporting Ukraine&#39;s war against Russia, now nearly 20 months old and close to stalemate. “If we walk away and let Putin erase Ukraine&#39;s independence, would-be aggressors around the world would be emboldened to try the same,” Mr Biden said, arguing that conflict and chaos could spread around the world.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Giving support to American allies and partners, he said, was “a smart investment that&#39;s going to pay dividends for American security for generations,” Mr Biden insisted. It would help keep American troops out of harm&#39;s way. He also argued that the money for Ukraine was being spent on American-made weapons, and served to replenish America&#39;s own arsenal with more modern weapons. Patriot air-defence missiles were made in Arizona, he noted; 12 states were involved in the manufacture of artillery shells.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;With an eye on the 2024 elections and questions about whether, at the age of 80, he is able to campaign for and serve a second term, Mr Biden highlighted his wartime visit to Kyiv in February and his recent trip to Israel, boasting that he was “the first American [president] to enter a war-zone not controlled by the United States military since President Lincoln”. &lt;span data-ornament=&quot;ufinish&quot;>;■&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 21 Oct 2023 22:27:02 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
