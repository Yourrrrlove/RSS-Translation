/aside>;&lt;div>;&lt;div>;&lt;div id=&quot;econ-1&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;以色列的初步行动引发了一波批评。以色列人权组织B&#39;tselem指责以色列实施“犯罪报复政策”，称其空袭和封锁规模构成“以色列高级官员公开下令的战争罪”。人道主义组织无国界医生组织指责以色列对加沙实施非法“集体惩罚”，“以全面围困、狂轰滥炸和潜在地面战威胁的形式”。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;在实践中，然而，国际法和管辖战争的具体规则——武装冲突法（&lt;small>;LOAC&lt;/small>;），也称为国际人道主义法（&lt;small>;IHL&lt;/small>;）——赋予以色列相当大的自由度据法律专家称，袭击哈马斯。 《联合国宪章》第五十一条赋予各国针对武装攻击进行自卫的权利，但条件是根据习惯国际法，它们使用的武力是必要且相称的。比例并不意味着使用的武器类型或造成的伤亡人数的对称。这意味着防御国可以使用尽可能多的武力来应对威胁，而不能使用更多武力。&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;figure>;&lt;span itemscope=&quot;&quot;

alt=&quot;&quot;/>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;p>;划定这条线是一个主观且有争议的过程。但为北约武装部队授课的埃克塞特大学法学教授奥雷尔·萨里 (Aurel Sari) 认为，以色列迄今为止的行动将符合这些标准。哈马斯袭击的规模、其所表现出的意图和经过验证的能力意味着&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/10/11/brutal-urban-warfare-await -israels-army-in-gaza&quot;>;入侵加沙&lt;/a>;，甚至暂时占领加沙以摧毁该组织，“相对容易在法律上证明其合理性”，他说。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;尽管如此，一些措施仍然是可行的。特别有争议。以色列在控制南部过境点的埃及的帮助下，多年来一直对加沙实行地面、空中和海上封锁，只允许部分货物和人员通过。围攻和封锁本身并不违法。但10月9日，以色列国防部长约夫·加兰特表示，这将变成“全面围困”，“没有电、没有食物、没有燃料，一切都关闭”。三天后，能源部长伊斯雷尔·卡茨警告说，在哈马斯&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.com 之前，不会“打开电气开关，不会打开消防栓，也不会进入加油车” /middle-east-and-africa/2023/10/08/israeli-hostages-now-face-a-terrifying-ordeal&quot;>;释放人质&lt;/a>;。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;以色列官员证明这一举动是合理的哈马斯将民用物资转用于军事用途的依据。耶路撒冷以色列民主研究所法学教授阿米哈伊·科恩表示，“显然，以色列应该允许一定程度的供应。问题是以色列是否应该向哈马斯明确控制的地区提供电力，以及哈马斯将在哪里使用电力来攻击以色列。”波士顿塔夫茨大学法学教授汤姆·丹南鲍姆等其他人则认为，加兰特的命令明显违反了禁止让平民挨饿的禁令——即使其目标是压制哈马斯。这可能就是为什么尽管加兰特发表了好斗的言论，以色列官员仍在私下与埃及合作，以确保一些物资能够从南部运入的原因之一。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;法律争议的第二个来源是 &lt;small>;IDF&lt;/small>; 在 10 月 12 日深夜做出的决定，告知生活在加沙北部的 110 万平民 &lt;a href =&quot;https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/10/13/as-war-looms-israel-calls-for-11m-people-to-evacuate-northern-gaza&quot; >;向南移动&lt;/a>;。 （哈马斯呼吁平民无视这一呼吁。）这一决定所造成的严重人道主义后果是毫无疑问的。加沙的基础设施已成废墟，可供这么多人去的地方很少。但法律方面更为复杂。 &lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;div>;&lt;div id=&quot;econ-2&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;律师区分战区平民临时疏散和可能是合法的、永久的流离失所，其目的是阻止他们返回，但事实并非如此。然而，人道组织红十字国际委员会（&lt;small>;ICRC&lt;/small>;）表示，疏散指示以及围困“不符合国际人道法”。在轰炸持续期间，移动也并不总是安全的。经《华盛顿邮报》证实的视频片段显示，包括几名儿童在内的多人被杀，显然是在周五他们逃往南方时遭到以色列袭击而丧生。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;撤离问题与加沙的具体情况密切相关，哈马斯与加沙平民的关系密切。 &lt;small>;国际人道法&lt;/small>;规范军队在发动战争时的行为，它要求士兵一方面区分战斗人员和军事物体，另一方面区分平民和民用物体。故意针对后者始终是非法的。但是，如果出于某种军事目的而有必要，并且“与预期的具体和直接的军事优势相称”，那么杀死平民（甚至是大量平民）的攻击就可以是合法的。雷丁大学的迈克尔·施密特和&lt;小>;美国&lt;/小号中校约翰·梅里亚姆认为，以色列的目标“基本上属于当代国家实践的主流”，并且符合美国的学说。 >; 陆军军法检察官，在 2014 年以色列对哈马斯进行 50 天战争“保护边缘行动”后不久，他们访问了&lt;small>;以色列国防军&lt;/small>;总部并研究了其程序，随后发表了论文。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;但相同的法律原则，即使以大致相同的方式解释，也可能因当地情况而导致不同的、有时甚至是不和谐的结果。施密特先生和梅里亚姆中校指出，哈马斯的大型火箭力量能够打击以色列大部分地区，这意味着预计袭击的“军事优势”很高。在&lt;小>;以色列国防军&lt;/小>;看来，这可以证明高水平的附带损害是合理的，对于一支平民没有面临类似威胁的军队来说，这种损害似乎太过分了——尽管相反，该国铁军的有效性圆顶导弹防御系统可以产生相反的法律效果。同样，以色列大量应征入伍的武装部队不愿伤亡，对士兵被俘很敏感。这可能会导致对火力的更大依赖。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;哈马斯的战争方式在加沙也发挥着作用。 “这不是一座普通城市，”2004 年至 2011 年间担任以色列首席军法总署 (&lt;small>;MAG&lt;/small>;) 和 2016 年至 2022 年间担任司法部长的阿维猜·曼德尔布利特 (Avichai Mandelblit) 表示，“这是一座军事城市。加沙地区有数千个合法军事目标。你无法区分它们。”以色列的战争目的是摧毁哈马斯。 “如果你想这么做，”曼德尔布利特先生说，“那么你就必须摧毁加沙，因为加沙的一切，几乎每一栋建筑，都是哈马斯的据点。”他说，因此平民的疏散是不可避免的。 “没有其他办法——否则他们就会被杀掉。” &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;尽管如此，法律仍然要求歧视。每个目标都必须单独判断。但以色列轰炸的规模——六天内投下 6,000 枚炸弹，而 2014 年至 2019 年美国领导的针对伊斯兰国的空袭期间，伊拉克和叙利亚每月投掷 2,000 至 5,000 枚炸弹——引发了人们对军事轰炸定义的担忧。目标正被延伸至临界点。新泽西州罗格斯大学法学院的阿迪尔·哈克认为，“许多罢工很难找到法律依据。” “很难相信所有这些建筑物在被夷为平地时都被哈马斯积极使用，或者它们的军事价值将超过对它们内部或附近平民造成的可预见的伤害。” &lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div>;&lt;div id=&quot;econ-3&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Sari 先生表示，&lt;small>;IDF&lt;/small>;，他的经验在法律专业知识和职业道德方面是“世界一流的”。 “我对以色列军队、律师和他们的制度充满信心。它非常坚固。”以色列军事总部从旅级到军事律师都在场，就目标定位提供建议。 “每个目标都经过法律审查，”曼德尔布利特先生坚称。法律政策由&lt;small>;MAG&lt;/small>;和民事总检察长共同制定，后者拥有最终决定权。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;但这个系统可能会在未来几周面临最大的考验。 10月10日，一名以色列官员对一家电视台表示：“加沙最终将变成一座帐篷之城。不会有建筑物。”以色列国防军发言人丹尼尔·哈加里 (Daniel Hagari) 吹嘘说，“数百吨炸弹”已投向加沙。然后，他补充道：“重点是伤害而不是准确性。”这两种说法都不符合法律。 &lt;/p>;&lt;figure>;&lt;span itemscope=&quot;&quot;

人数约为十人左右所以人们（对确切数字的记忆有所不同）。他们成对部署在外围围栏的战略要点上。佩莱德和土木工程师伊莱·米特曼 (Eli Mittman) 一起被派驻在靠近后门（即果园门）的一栋新建房屋旁边。从房子的屋顶上，您可以看到鸡孵化场，这是一个大型机库，距离牛油果田约 250 米。大约 15 分钟后，佩莱德听到孵化场传来枪声。对他来说，这听起来像是一场涉及少数人的枪战。很快，人们发现一排以色列士兵正在与一群哈马斯武装分子作战。 &lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div>;&lt;div id=&quot;econ-2&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;佩莱德努力弄清楚基布兹其他地方发生了什么。对讲机尚未分发，因此 &lt;i>;kitat konenut&lt;/i>; 的成员&lt;!-- -->; 通过手机进行交流。他没有被加入 WhatsApp 群组，因为他不是一名常规志愿者。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“突然，Eli 指着 100 米外的一个人影朝后门跑去。我分不清他是士兵还是恐怖分子。他穿着绿色制服和绿色背心。看起来他可能是我们中的一员。我跑向栅栏喊道：‘你是谁？你是谁？&#39;我举起枪，瞄准了他。我不知道该怎么办。然后他跑进了鳄梨地。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;cite>;司机停下车，他们都蹲了下来。在齐射中，三名加沙人被子弹擦伤：一名在臀部，一名在腿部，一名在太阳穴&lt;/cite>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;佩莱德低头看了看手机，发现他终于已添加至 WhatsApp 群组。消息一连串传来：几名哈马斯枪手已经逼近前门，那里的 &lt;i>;kitat konenut&lt;/i>; 成员向他们开枪，打死了一两个人。 “如果我知道这一点，我就会明白这个人是恐怖分子，我会杀了他。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;鸡孵化场的战斗持续了几个小时。士兵和哈马斯战士会来回奔跑，从鸡孵化场到周围的鳄梨田。以色列士兵看上去很年轻。佩莱德说：“我几乎对他们感到有些怜悯，但我无法离开基布兹来帮助他们。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;有好几次，哈马斯枪手会从掩体中逃跑。佩莱德会冲到栅栏前向他开枪。他不知道自己杀了多少人：可能是一两个，也可能更多。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“我以为军队会来，但它没有发生，”佩莱德说。几个小时后，一辆坦克出现了。他看到哈马斯战士向它发射火箭推进式手榴弹。 “坦克”，他挖苦地说，“在这种战斗情况下并不是特别有用。” &lt;/p>;&lt;p data-caps=&quot;initial&quot;>;&lt;span data-caps=&quot;initial&quot;>;B&lt;/span>;阿拉维和他的受伤工人仍然蜷缩在附近的柚园里。他每半小时与利伯曼通一次电话，但他掌握的信息越多，就越清楚基布兹的任何人都不可能营救他们。利伯曼告诉巴拉维保持隐蔽——他担心士兵们会把他和他的团队误认为是哈马斯战士。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;上午，巴拉维的父母从加沙给他打电话，告诉他他们无法联系到他的兄弟哈希姆。巴拉维给哈希姆的儿子打电话，他也在附近工作。他说，枪声一开始，他就设法开车离开，并很快就与哈希姆进行了交谈。从那以后，他就再也联系不上他的父亲了。&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-caps=&quot;initial&quot;>;&lt;span data-caps=&quot;initial&quot;>;下午早些时候，三点左右四辆哈马斯车辆——装有机枪的皮卡和卡车，每辆载着大约十名枪手——驶向鸡孵化场。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“他们屠杀了我们的士兵，”佩莱德说。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;i>;kitat konenut&lt;/i>; 的所有志愿者都知道他们处于危险之中。每个人都在拼命打电话给他们认识的军队里的任何人——将军、退役军官、特种部队、地区指挥部——请求帮助。他们说，如果你不派出援军，尼尔阿姆就会陷落。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;佩莱德估计有 40 至 50 名哈马斯枪手聚集。他告诉 &lt;i>;kitat konenut&lt;/i>; 的成员，“听着。他们已经屠杀了我们的士兵，并且正在前往后门。没有人能进入尼尔阿姆内部。”他重复了命令：“任何人都不要进入尼尔阿姆。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;cite>;鸡孵化场的战斗持续了几个小时。士兵和哈马斯战士会来回奔跑，从鸡孵化场到周围的牛油果田&lt;/cite>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;包括佩莱德在内的八名志愿者向哈马斯逼近的后门移动。 “我们八个人都拿着 M16——幸运的是我的能用，”佩莱德回忆道。 “我们都站在栅栏附近。我一遍又一遍地说，“没人能进入尼尔阿姆。”他们回答说：‘我们在这里。我们明白。&#39;我们八个人都明白，如果他们越过了我们，他们就会屠杀我们的家人。” &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;佩莱德在复述中几乎笑了。 “他们培养我是为了战斗，我在特种部队服役了十年。这不是我的第一次战斗，我认为这也不会是我的最后一次。但看到伊莱，一位穿着凉鞋、挺着小肚子的工程师站在我旁边——我看到一名战士站在我旁边。我们都留下来了。”&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div>;&lt;div id=&quot;econ-3&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;然后，其中一名志愿者“做了最简单的事情”佩莱德说，直到那时他们都没有想到这一点——他报了警。 “你知道吗？警方派出了战术反应部队。三辆汽车，五辆摩托车，三辆货车。他们改变了战斗。”增援部队扭转了战局。哈马斯武装分子被击退。一些人被杀。他们都未能突破尼尔阿姆的防御。该地区几乎没有其他社区如此幸运。&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-caps=&quot;initial&quot;>;&lt;span data-caps=&quot;initial&quot;>;在接下来的一个小时左右的时间里，以色列士兵和基布兹周围的田野里布满了武装警察。一整天，奥弗·利伯曼都与躲在柚园里的巴拉维保持着联系。 “奥弗给了我们很多帮助，我们爱他，”巴拉维告诉我。 “当我们听到周围都是枪声时，他并没有把我们留在果园里。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;下午 5 点左右，利伯曼给巴拉维打电话，说以色列士兵几分钟后就会来抓他。巴拉维请利伯曼陪他们一起去，因为他很害怕。利伯曼询问了以色列官员是否允许这样做，他们同意了。当他们发现这群人时，利伯曼告诉加沙工人举起手来。柚树下出现了十个人，其中三人流着血。 &lt;/p>;&lt;figure>;&lt;span itemscope=&quot;&quot;

&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;在视频中，您可以听到拍摄该场景的男子用希伯来语描述这一场景。当镜头转向那辆灰色货车时，他说：“还有一辆恐怖分子的汽车。”他将镜头对准一具从乘客座位上摔下来的尸体。 “又一个恐怖分子完蛋了。这就是现在的情况。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;第二个视频似乎是稍后拍摄的。该视频显示了 24 小时以色列新闻频道 I24 news 的阿拉伯语记者的广播。他身穿蓝色防弹衣站在现场。 By this time, the bodies have been taken away and the wrecked cars and the grey Volkswagen van moved to the side of the road. The reporter picks up a five-litre water bottle from the open boot of the van, and says: “Here is the car with the armed people from Hamas. They came here and we can see they were equipped with water.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“I cried,” Barawi told me. “Hashem was my closest brother. We worked at the kibbutz together and spent our whole lives together. He was the spine of the family, the leader, the one everyone relied on. He has many children and 25 grandchildren.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Barawi had no idea who was responsible for the killing of his brother. “I didn&#39;t see who did it. How can I tell if it was Israelis or Hamas? Truly, I don&#39;t know.” (The circumstances in which Hashem and his fellow workers died remain unclear.)&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-caps=&quot;initial&quot;>;&lt;span data-caps=&quot;initial&quot;>;A&lt;/span>;s the sun began to sink, the kibbutz&#39;s WhatsApp group started to fill with messages from people who wanted to flee. They could see the horror of the attacks across southern Israel on &lt;small>;TV&lt;/small>; and social media. Orna Schwartz, the head of the kibbutz&#39;s emergency committee, told me she tried to explain that leaving was forbidden. There were still Hamas fighters at large and the situation was chaotic. Some communities were still waiting for the army to arrive. “People said, &#39;We can decide for ourselves.&#39;” Families packed into their cars and began to drive out. Saar Paz, a member of the &lt;i>;kitat konenut&lt;/i>;, was posted on the front gate. “I told people to be careful on the roads. There are still terrorists in the area.

Orna Schwartz, head of Nir Am&#39;s emergency committee, tried to maintain calm &lt;i>;(bottom)&lt;/i>;&lt;/figcaption>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;p>;Schwartz put her elderly and infirm parents in her car. As they waited in the dark for the convoy to assemble, the alert sounded again and everyone had to disperse to shelters before regrouping. “Driving out, we saw so many cars overturned and dead bodies on the road that we had to turn the wheel like this and that to drive around them,” she told me. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Liberman drove his wife and other members of his family out that night. Later the following day, he called Barawi to check on the wounded workers. Bahawi told him Hashem had been killed along with seven other Gazan workers and their Israeli driver. Liberman recalls saying to Barawi: “You know now it&#39;s a war. We cannot cry yet for Hashem. We will mourn for him after this is over.”&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div>;&lt;div id=&quot;econ-4&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Liberman had known Hashem for 40 years. “They practically grew up together,” said Barawi. Liberman told me he had met Hashem&#39;s family in 1987, “the last time we could go into Gaza. We went to his house.” Sometimes Liberman would call Hashem. He would say a few words to his wife, who spoke a little English, if she answered the phone. When I asked Liberman if his relationship with the Gazans who worked at the kibbutz had changed as hostilities fluctuated, he said, “It is not between me and Hashem or between me and Nabil. It&#39;s between governments.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-caps=&quot;initial&quot;>;&lt;span data-caps=&quot;initial&quot;>;I&lt;/span>; met Barawi at a petrol station in southern Israel a few days after the attack happened. On the horizon, a puff of black smoke rose from Gaza. His forehead was creased with worry. Gazan day labourers like him are now stranded illegally in Israel. Meanwhile, his family is under siege in Gaza. The village where they live, Beit Lahia, is in the very north of Gaza and the Israelis have told Palestinians living there to move south if they value their lives. Barawi checks in on his family every half an hour if the internet connection allows it. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;He was desperate for the Israeli authorities to release the bodies of Hashem and the others so they could be brought back to Gaza and given an Islamic burial. He had received indications that many of the bodies recovered were at an army base and that they wouldn&#39;t be released without a &lt;small>;DNA&lt;/small>; identification. None of those killed has a family member inside Israel who could provide this, except for Hashem.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;We sat at a lone picnic table, away from the petrol-station café where soldiers and civilians were drinking coffee. Barawi was in touch with his brother&#39;s family. They were unable to stop crying. “The most important thing for me”, he said to me, “is to say that my brother and the workers who were killed with him are not terrorists as some in the media are saying. They were ordinary workers with legitimate work cards.” He showed me a photograph of his brother&#39;s &lt;small>;ID&lt;/small>; card and gave me a handwritten piece of paper listing the names and Israeli &lt;small>;ID&lt;/small>; numbers of the workers who had been killed. “All we want is to be able to bury them with respect.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Barawi said people from Nir Am were trying to intercede with the authorities to expedite the process of getting the labourers&#39; bodies released. Even if this were to succeed, it&#39;s hard to see how Hashem&#39;s wife and children will be able to retrieve his remains: a full-scale war is now going on between Israel and Gaza, and the crossing is closed.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;cite>;When I asked Liberman if his relationship with the Gazans who worked at the kibbutz had changed as hostilities fluctuated, he said, “It is not between me and Hashem or between me and Nabil. It&#39;s between governments”&lt;/cite>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The people of Nir Am and other communities close to Gaza that came under attack have been evacuated to hotels in Tel Aviv. I met several of them at Herods, a hotel on the beach. The lobby was noisy, full of children running around. The adults were still trying to make sense of what had happened, and what it meant.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“We were waiting and the army didn&#39;t come,” Paz told me, still digesting it. “You&#39;re used to relying on the army. You are sure the army will save you. And the army didn&#39;t come.” Schwartz told me that she had nightmares about gunmen coming to the hotel to which they had been evacuated. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Peled was angry. “How did they come and do exactly what they wanted and our military wasn&#39;t there?”他问。 I wondered if he could see himself living in Nir Am again. He said he would. “But my kids won&#39;t be the same. The kibbutz won&#39;t be the same. Nothing will be the same.” &lt;span data-ornament=&quot;ufinish&quot;>;■&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;b>;Wendell Steavenson&lt;/b>; has reported on Russia&#39;s invasion of Ukraine for &lt;i>;1843 magazine&lt;/i>;.

But it may soon face competition for that title. From 2028, cricket could feature in the Olympic games. On October 15th officials from the International Olympic Committee (&lt;small>;IOC&lt;/small>;), meeting in Mumbai, are expected to ratify cricket&#39;s inclusion at the Los Angeles games, along with lacrosse, squash, flag football and baseball (for men) or softball (for women). &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The additions feel radical. Cricket has featured only once in the Olympics, in Paris in 1900. (In a mockery of an international match, a minor English touring side, who happened to be in France, beat a French team made up mostly of English expats. They were the only entrants.) Squash has never featured, despite a clamour for its inclusion for decades. Flag football, a miniature version of American football, is barely played outside America. But radical inclusions are becoming more common. The games in Paris next year will feature breakdancing in a line-up of 32 sports. When the five new sports get ratified in Mumbai next week, Los Angeles 2028 will showcase 33. By contrast, the first games in Athens in 1896 had just nine. &lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div>;&lt;div id=&quot;econ-1&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Those first few games resembled parochial carnivals more than international sporting contests. In 1900, for example, the Belgian contestant bagged gold in the live-pigeon shooting, after blasting 21 birds out of the sky in a day. The event too was mercifully put out of its misery. As was the tug-of-war, which was pulled in 1920. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;As the Olympics gained seriousness and size, so did its array of sports. The &lt;small>;IOC&lt;/small>; has been determined not to miss out on new sports, although some of them can barely be called that. Its criteria for events in Paris next year was that they should be “inclusive, gender-balanced and youth-centred”. Hence the selection of breakdancing, skateboarding and surfing. Similarly Los Angeles wants sports “to engage new fans and athletes”. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Less platitudinously, more sports mean more money. That is understandable given that most Olympics make a loss. New sports are one obvious way to boost revenues. Take cricket. Its inclusion in Los Angeles is expected to bring in more viewers from the Indian subcontinent. The Indian broadcast rights for the Paris games are reportedly worth $20m; cricket&#39;s addition in Los Angeles is expected to add a nought. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The sports stand to benefit too. The Olympics are the biggest platform for niche endeavours, such as archery and wrestling, and a necessity for their financial survival. They get a share of the Olympics&#39; sponsorship revenue and funding from governments hungry for medals. At home and abroad, the games also shine a light on little-known athletes. Nationalism makes people do silly things, like tuning in to dressage. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Even mainstream sports can benefit from the Olympics. The presence of American basketball stars at the Barcelona games in 1992 increased the game&#39;s global appeal. Since then the number of foreign players in the &lt;small>;NBA&lt;/small>;, America&#39;s and the world&#39;s biggest league, has grown steadily. The governing bodies of cricket, which is played by a handful of countries, and American football (in essence, just one), are hoping for a similar effect from Los Angeles.&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div>;&lt;div id=&quot;econ-2&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;There are, of course, costs to a broader Olympics. A diverse selection of sports requires more specialised venues. Finding places in Los Angeles to play flag football should be straightforward; less so cricket grounds. The recent Olympics in Tokyo is estimated to have set the local organisers back $35bn. A significant chunk went on building new venues (including a national stadium that cost $1.4bn but sat empty during the games because of the pandemic). Cities are increasingly loth to take up such burdens. Paris and Los Angeles were awarded the games because no other city wanted them.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;To make the prospect more enticing the &lt;small>;IOC&lt;/small>; has allowed local organising committees to propose local sports (hence flag football in Los Angeles). To prevent bloated games, it has instituted a cap of 10,500 athletes. That will be met in Paris, but is unlikely to be in Los Angeles. So far the Los Angeles organisers have only cut breakdancing from their programme. Once sports are in the Olympics, they tend to stay. When the&lt;small>; IOC&lt;/small>; mulled ditching wrestling at the Tokyo games, it sparked outcry. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;There is a simpler solution: spread the Olympics across cities. Only tradition mandates that the games be hosted in one place. It is far better for the burden—and honour—to be shared across many cities in a country, or even the world. Lacrosse in Montreal, football in Manchester and cricket in Mumbai would require much less investment from each host, and would make the Olympics a truly global event. Fans who attend the games are unlikely to complain. Those travelling to Paris next year to catch the showjumping are unlikely to shuffle over to watch breakdancing. In a fractious world, the Olympics provide a rare shared celebration. A bigger selection of sports allows more to join the party. There is no reason why it has to be in one place. &lt;span data-ornament=&quot;ufinish&quot;>;■&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 16 Oct 2023 09:27:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Sex guru, cosplayer, economist: will Javier Milei be Argentina’s next president? | 1843 magazine]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/1843/2023/10/13/sex-guru-cosplayer-economist-will-javier-milei-be-argentinas-next-president]]><description> &lt;img src=&quot;https://images.weserv.nl/?url=www.economist.com/img/b/1716/965/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231013_1843_JAVIER_TEASER.jpg&quot;/>;&lt;div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-caps=&quot;initial&quot;>;&lt;span data-caps=&quot;initial&quot;>;I&lt;/span>;n 2019 Javier Milei – &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.com/news/2023/09/07/an-interview-with-javier-milei&quot;>;the front-runner in Argentina&#39;s presidential election&lt;/a>; later this month – attended a cosplay convention. He wore black and yellow spandex and wielded a golden staff. This alter ego, a character of his own invention, was called General Ancap, the leader of “Liberland”, a country “where nobody pays taxes”. The name was a portmanteau for anarcho-capitalist, a strand of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/09/07/can-javier-mileis-radical-libertarianism-save-argentina&quot;>;libertarianism&lt;/a>; that seeks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.com/by-invitation/2023/09/29/javier-milei-argues-that-argentinas-central-bank-should-not-exist&quot;>;abolish the state&lt;/a>; in favour of unfettered free markets. As Milei told a gaggle of amused adolescents, the general&#39;s mission was to “kick Keynesians and collectivists in the ass”.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Milei may soon become the leader of a real country, but it&#39;s hard to predict which sort of character he will play. In five years he has gone from being an economist known mostly for his eccentric television appearances to the man to beat in the race to lead South America&#39;s second-largest economy. At a recent campaign event, he channelled his inner rock star. Jumping frenetically around the stage in a leather jacket, he roared the lyrics of a rock song in front of 15,000 fans: “I am the king in a lost world!” In interviews, however, he prefers to look like a dishevelled academic, with a wild mop-top and glasses that threaten to slip off his nose. &lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div>;&lt;div id=&quot;econ-1&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;A century ago, Argentina was one of the world&#39;s richest countries; today, it is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.com/films/2023/09/07/why-is-argentinas-economy-in-such-a-mess&quot;>;synonymous with crisis&lt;/a>;. The economy has been mismanaged under both left-wing and centre-right administrations, resulting in annual inflation at 138%, the third-highest anywhere in the world. The share of people who cannot afford both a basic bag of groceries and an essential service like transport or health care has risen from 26% in 2017 to 40% today. Argentina owes the International Monetary Fund an eye-watering $44bn – almost a third of the fund&#39;s entire lending portfolio – yet the country&#39;s central bank has no dollar reserves to pay back the loan. Corruption is rampant, trust in institutions is low and voters are exhausted. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;cite>;He has boasted on television about being a sex guru whom former girlfriends call “the naughty cow”, introduced audiences to his four cloned English mastiffs and spoken openly about his complicated relationship with his parents&lt;/cite>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Milei entered public life amid this stew of discontent, blaming what he calls a political “caste” for stealing from hard-working Argentines. This caste, according to Milei, includes corrupt legislators; their cronies in the private sector whose businesses profit from government contracts; self-interested trade-union leaders; and media outlets that rely on state advertising. He also singles out the central bank for criticism, arguing that it does the government&#39;s bidding by printing money to finance the deficit, thus worsening inflation. Milei proposes to slash public spending by 15% of &lt;small>;GDP&lt;/small>;, eliminate most taxes, cut the number of ministries from 18 to eight, “blow up” the central bank and swap the country&#39;s flailing currency, the peso, for the United States dollar. &lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div>;&lt;div id=&quot;econ-2&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Milei&#39;s ideas have proved popular with Argentines, leading to a sea-change in the political discourse. The country&#39;s centre-right coalition recently floated the idea of allowing the dollar to become legal tender alongside the peso. The left-wing coalition in power criticises the welfare handouts it instituted over two decades ago. Politicians have adopted the term “caste” to describe everyone but themselves. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Since he exploded onto the public scene, Milei&#39;s complex personal life has been as prominent as his political pronouncements. He has boasted on television about being a sex guru whom former girlfriends call “the naughty cow”, introduced audiences to his four cloned English mastiffs and spoken openly about his complicated relationship with his parents, whom he long dismissed as merely his “progenitors”. In a country of 46m people, he has nearly 7m followers across his social-media accounts. Young men in particular like his rhetorical style, which often includes aggressive outbursts against opponents. The international media have labelled him as Argentina&#39;s answer to Donald Trump – an association he doesn&#39;t repudiate.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Although he enjoys experimenting with different personas, Milei&#39;s latest role – Argentina&#39;s president-in-waiting – doesn&#39;t seem to suit him. He claims to have lost 20kg since his campaign started this year; his pinstriped outfit now swamps his five-foot-eight frame. (Though he says it is because he has been eating healthier, it&#39;s hard to believe stress hasn&#39;t played a role.) If he were to win the election, he would become the world&#39;s first avowedly libertarian president.

His beginnings were not auspicious. Milei has claimed that his father regularly beat him up.

The Mileis moved there after his father became well-off in circumstances that remain unclear. Originally a bus-driver, Milei&#39;s father eventually bought a fleet of buses and later established a finance company and a small property firm.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;According to Juan Luis González, whose unauthorised biography of Milei, “El Loco” (The Crazy One), was published earlier this year, Milei&#39;s father considered his son a troublemaker and used to call him “crazy”. He bragged to friends about disciplining Milei with a belt. In interviews Milei has recalled how, when he was 11, he criticised the military dictatorship&#39;s declaration of war on Britain over the Falkland Islands. His father thrashed him for his lack of patriotism – so violently that his sister, who is three years younger, fainted at the sight. His mother was complicit in the abuse: she called Milei from the hospital to tell him that if Karina died, it would be his fault.&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div>;&lt;div id=&quot;econ-3&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Neighbours say Milei&#39;s parents kept to themselves. His mother was a housewife famed for her immaculately coiffed hair; his father was often absent. But the young Milei seemed different. Leonor Moro, a paediatrician who lived two doors down, and whose niece sometimes played with Milei, described him as “un liero, jorobón” – a cheeky boy with a reputation for cracking jokes. Others who knew him at the time also describe Milei as a &lt;i>;bonachon &lt;/i>;– a good guy. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In secondary school Milei was outspoken and seen as odd&lt;b>;, &lt;/b>;though classmates generally thought well of him&lt;b>;. &lt;/b>;“He was always very histrionic and energetic. But in my memory he was deeply good-natured – a very gentle and good person,” recalled Diego Vila, a former schoolmate who joined a Rolling Stones tribute band that Milei started in his final year of school. As frontman, Milei styled his beehive-sized hair to look more like Mick Jagger&#39;s. (Today he attributes his hairdo that ends in impressive sideburns to the work of the “invisible hand”, a wry reference to Adam Smith&#39;s description of the forces that move the free market.) &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;cite>;Today he attributes his hairdo that ends in impressive sideburns to the work of the “invisible hand”, a wry reference to Adam Smith&#39;s description of the forces that move the free market&lt;/cite>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Several times a week Milei would travel to a working-class suburb of Buenos Aires, where he trained at Chacarita Juniors, a football club. He earned a reputation for being a fearless goalkeeper. Eduardo Grecco, Milei&#39;s former football coach, said he was known as “el loco&lt;!-- -->; Milei”, the crazy Milei, “because he would throw himself at the ball, nothing mattered to him, not even hurting himself”. For a while he flirted with the idea of going professional, and Grecco told me he had a chance.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Milei&#39;s &lt;i>;loco &lt;/i>;personality on the football pitch earned him a degree of admiration. Although he was two years younger than his teammates, he “made himself respected”, remembered Marcelo Venturelli, who used to play with an older group. “In football changing rooms, when arguments get heated, they always end up the same way. Someone throws a punch. And when that punch flew, Milei knew how to defend himself.” &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Neither Venturelli nor Vila recognises the Milei of their youth in the Milei of today. “If you ask me, this Milei surprises me. He is not the Milei I knew,” Venturelli said. “I&#39;ve never seen him as angry as when he gets angry on television.” Vila agreed and worried that the character Milei created for the media eventually “ate him up”. “It&#39;s hard for me to see him on &lt;small>;TV&lt;/small>; now,” added Vila. “He&#39;s angry all the time.” &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Though sociable enough at school, Milei had few deep friendships and no girlfriends, according to González, the biographer. It took Milei until his early 30s to make a proper friend, another unorthodox economist with whom he later fell out. Since becoming a public figure, he has had several girlfriends – some of whom have been actresses or singers who look like pin-ups.&lt;!-- -->; Until recently, though, claims González, Milei was “an extremely lonely guy who spent a dozen Christmases and a dozen New Year&#39;s Eves toasting champagne alone with his dog.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-caps=&quot;initial&quot;>;&lt;span data-caps=&quot;initial&quot;>;M&lt;/span>;ilei&#39;s interest in economics stems from the financial crisis that engulfed Argentina in the late 1980s. Between 1989 and 1990 inflation reached annual average rates of over 2,600%. Milei recalls that he would go to the supermarket with his mother and see customers scrambling to stay ahead of the shopkeepers with sticker-guns, who would increase prices several times a day. &lt;/p>;&lt;figure>;&lt;span itemscope=&quot;&quot; itemProp=&quot;image&quot; itemType=&quot;https://schema.org/ImageObject&quot;>;&lt;meta itemProp=&quot;url&quot; content=&quot;https://www.economist.com/img/b/1181/1157/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231013_1843_JAVIER_03_RT.jpg&quot;/>;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; width=&quot;1181&quot; height=&quot;1157&quot; src=&quot;https://www.economist.com/img/b/1181/1157/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231013_1843_JAVIER_03_RT.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/196/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231013_1843_JAVIER_03_RT.jpg 200w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/294/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231013_1843_JAVIER_03_RT.jpg 300w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/392/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231013_1843_JAVIER_03_RT.jpg 400w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/588/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231013_1843_JAVIER_03_RT.jpg 600w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/627/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231013_1843_JAVIER_03_RT.jpg 640w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/784/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231013_1843_JAVIER_03_RT.jpg 800w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/980/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231013_1843_JAVIER_03_RT.jpg 1000w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1254/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231013_1843_JAVIER_03_RT.jpg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;figure>;&lt;span itemscope=&quot;&quot; itemProp=&quot;image&quot; itemType=&quot;https://schema.org/ImageObject&quot;>;&lt;meta itemProp=&quot;url&quot; content=&quot;https://www.economist.com/img/b/1143/1143/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231013_1843_JAVIER_04.jpg&quot;/>;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; width=&quot;1143&quot; height=&quot;1143&quot; src=&quot;https://www.economist.com/img/b/1143/1143/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231013_1843_JAVIER_04.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/200/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231013_1843_JAVIER_04.jpg 200w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/300/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231013_1843_JAVIER_04.jpg 300w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/400/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231013_1843_JAVIER_04.jpg 400w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/600/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231013_1843_JAVIER_04.jpg 600w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/640/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231013_1843_JAVIER_04.jpg 640w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/800/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231013_1843_JAVIER_04.jpg 800w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/1000/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231013_1843_JAVIER_04.jpg 1000w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1280/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231013_1843_JAVIER_04.jpg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;p>;Milei enrolled at the University of Belgrano, a private college in an exclusive neighbourhood. As the financial crisis worsened, he dropped his dreams of playing football professionally and focused on economics instead. Immediately, he stood out. “He was an outstanding student. Restless, very intelligent,” said Víctor Beker, the head of the university&#39;s economics department at the time. Milei would regularly go to Beker&#39;s office to ask questions after class. In one such drop-in he volunteered that he could write two assignments at the same time with both hands. “He was a person who valued himself very highly and who thought that he had skills that others did not have,” remembered Beker. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;On other visits, the office doubled up as a shrink&#39;s couch. (As it happens, Milei also saw a therapist for years until he died a few years ago.) Milei would walk in fuming about his abusive parents. Beker believes Milei felt he “had to prove to his parents that they were wrong about him”. &lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div>;&lt;div id=&quot;econ-4&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;At university, Milei had little to do with his peers, perhaps, suggested Beker, because he found them intellectually lacking. In his fourth year, Beker invited him to work on a project to evaluate the privatisation of Argentina&#39;s telecommunications firms. To end hyperinflation, the new president, Carlos Menem&lt;b>;,&lt;/b>; had pegged the local currency to the dollar, and then privatised many of Argentina&#39;s state-owned firms. For a while, the strategy worked: inflation was brought under control in the 1990s and millions of dollars poured in from abroad. Learning about these successes planted the seeds of Milei&#39;s love for the free market, though it took many years for him to embrace libertarianism.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;cite>;Until recently, though, Milei was “an extremely lonely guy who spent 15 Christmases and 15 New Year&#39;s Eves toasting champagne alone with his dog”&lt;/cite>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;While at university, Milei completed an internship at the central bank and became well-versed in Keynesianism – the economic philosophy of John Maynard Keynes, who believed that high government spending during a recession could stimulate consumer demand and economic growth. After completing his undergraduate degree, Milei finished a master&#39;s in economics. Alongside this, he worked as an independent consultant. Milei seemingly had no qualms about advising Antonio Bussi, a former military officer, during his run for a seat in Congress in 1999. Bussi was later convicted of crimes against humanity committed during the dictatorship that ruled Argentina from 1976 to 1983. (Bussi&#39;s son is running to be a legislator in Argentina&#39;s lower house for Milei&#39;s coalition, Liberty Advances, in the general election.)&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;By the time Milei started his second master&#39;s degree, in economic theory, he was becoming disillusioned with some of the key ideas of Keynesianism, which he felt had left Argentina&#39;s economy in tatters. Around 2008, a colleague shared an article by Murray Rothbard, the intellectual father of anarcho-capitalism. In an anarcho-capitalist world, the state would cease to exist and all of its provisions, including education, health care, environmental protection and transport infrastructure, would be supplied through voluntary contracts between individuals. This, argued Rothbard, would not only lead to a better-functioning economy, but was also morally correct, since the state finances itself through taxes which citizens pay involuntarily. Unlike classical economists, who believe that competition lowers prices and improves quality, Rothbard argued that single companies which dominated markets could provide superior goods through their ability to produce at scale.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;cite>;From 2018 Milei was increasingly invited on to TV and radio shows to entertain audiences as much as to rail against economic policy. He sang the praises of tantric sex, boasting that he could go without ejaculating for three months, and performed a song called “Tantric Bomb” with his popstar girlfriend&lt;/cite>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Milei claims he consumed the 150-page article in three hours. “When I finished reading it…I said, &#39;Everything I taught in the last 25 years on market structures is wrong.&#39;” (In fact, Milei had only been teaching economics since becoming a master&#39;s student.) Milei adopted anti-statist ideas with the zeal of a religious convert. Soon after, he started devouring books by anti-Keynesian economists. He particularly liked Friedrich Hayek, Keynes&#39;s nemesis, who argued that handing over economic control to the state, rather than to individuals, leads to tyranny. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Rothbard&#39;s influence may help explain why Milei, who often says he is a liberal, found no contradiction in working for a quasi-monopoly. In 2008 he began working for Corporación América, a holding group that controls 37 of Argentina&#39;s 56 airports. Milei eventually became the company&#39;s chief economist.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Eduardo Eurnekian, Corporación América&#39;s billionaire owner, used to control several media channels and would later help Milei in his rise to fame. (Initially, Eurnekian said he supported Milei&#39;s presidential campaign. Recently, however, the two began to clash after Eurnekian said, of Milei, that Argentina couldn&#39;t bear to have another dictator.) According to González, the biographer, it was no coincidence that Milei&#39;s first opinion pieces were published by an online newspaper in which Eurnekian&#39;s nephew has a large stake. &lt;/p>;&lt;figure>;&lt;span itemscope=&quot;&quot; itemProp=&quot;image&quot; itemType=&quot;https://schema.org/ImageObject&quot;>;&lt;meta itemProp=&quot;url&quot; content=&quot;https://www.economist.com/img/b/1013/1013/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231013_1843_JAVIER_05.jpg&quot;/>;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; width=&quot;1013&quot; height=&quot;1013&quot; src=&quot;https://www.economist.com/img/b/1013/1013/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231013_1843_JAVIER_05.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/200/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231013_1843_JAVIER_05.jpg 200w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/300/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231013_1843_JAVIER_05.jpg 300w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/400/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231013_1843_JAVIER_05.jpg 400w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/600/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231013_1843_JAVIER_05.jpg 600w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/640/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231013_1843_JAVIER_05.jpg 640w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/800/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231013_1843_JAVIER_05.jpg 800w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/1000/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231013_1843_JAVIER_05.jpg 1000w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1280/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231013_1843_JAVIER_05.jpg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;figure>;&lt;span itemscope=&quot;&quot; itemProp=&quot;image&quot; itemType=&quot;https://schema.org/ImageObject&quot;>;&lt;meta itemProp=&quot;url&quot; content=&quot;https://www.economist.com/img/b/768/768/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231013_1843_JAVIER_06.jpg&quot;/>;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; width=&quot;768&quot; height=&quot;768&quot; src=&quot;https://www.economist.com/img/b/768/768/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231013_1843_JAVIER_06.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/200/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231013_1843_JAVIER_06.jpg 200w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/300/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231013_1843_JAVIER_06.jpg 300w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/400/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231013_1843_JAVIER_06.jpg 400w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/600/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231013_1843_JAVIER_06.jpg 600w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/640/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231013_1843_JAVIER_06.jpg 640w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/800/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231013_1843_JAVIER_06.jpg 800w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/1000/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231013_1843_JAVIER_06.jpg 1000w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1280/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231013_1843_JAVIER_06.jpg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;p>;Although Milei made his first television appearance in 2015, he didn&#39;t become a celebrity until three years later. Eurnekian was feuding with the centre-right government and Milei himself didn&#39;t think much of the government&#39;s policies. According to González, Eurnekian tapped his media contacts, suggesting they give Milei airtime.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;From 2018 Milei was increasingly invited on to &lt;small>;TV&lt;/small>; and radio shows to entertain audiences as much as to rail against economic policy. He sang the praises of tantric sex, boasting that he could go without ejaculating for three months, and performed a song called “Tantric Bomb” with his popstar girlfriend. He destroyed a piñata shaped like Argentina&#39;s central bank, and he acted in a play called “Milei&#39;s Office”, where he played the role of therapist explaining Argentina&#39;s economic malaise to clients.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;As he became more famous, Milei&#39;s views and public persona&lt;!-- -->; grew more extreme. When a journalist asked a mundane question about Keynes, he replied: “All I&#39;m saying is that you&#39;re an idiot and you talk about things you don&#39;t know.” He called the centrist mayor of Buenos Aires “a leftist piece of shit” and “a worm” whom he could “squish even in a wheelchair”. Once, he suggested that a politician he disliked should be beheaded with a samurai sword. He has dismissed the pope, who is Argentine, as “a leftist son of a bitch”, “a donkey”, “a jackass” and “an ignoramus”. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;With alt-right leaders sweeping into power around the world, Milei began moving away from liberalism towards hard-right conservatism. In 2020, he signed a letter sponsored by Vox, an ultra-nationalist party in Spain, against the advance of international “communism” – in Milei&#39;s conception, a broad array of left-wing ideas that he sees as the world&#39;s greatest ill. Global warming, he later said, was just a “socialist lie”.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Fans urged Milei to enter politics, and in 2021, he announced that he would run for Congress with Liberty Advances, his newly formed coalition. Later that year Milei became the first libertarian deputy elected to the lower house in Argentina&#39;s history. His career had changed but the show went on: every month he would raffle off his congressional salary to fans on social media. He seemed less interested in the business of government – he did not participate in half the parliamentary votes during his first year in office – than in cosying up to the international right. He attended the Conservative Political Action Conference (&lt;small>;CPAC&lt;/small>;), which is hosted by American conservative activists, and posed for photos with a son of Jair Bolsonaro, the populist former president of Brazil, and José Antonio Kast, a Chilean politician and presidential hopeful who has shown sympathy for General Augusto Pinochet&#39;s military dictatorship. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;cite>;He seemed less interested in the business of government – he did not participate in half the parliamentary votes during his first year in office – than in cosying up to the international right&lt;/cite>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;When Milei first toyed with the idea of running for president, most people did not take him seriously. At an event in June 2022, which many thought would be the official launch for his presidential campaign, few fans turned up. His detractors smirked when Milei proposed that people should be able to buy and sell bodily organs legally, thinking voters would recoil. It often feels like Milei adopts provocative poses just to see how much he can get away with. When asked whether he thought parents should be able to sell their children, he responded: “it depends.” “Wouldn&#39;t the answer just be no?” the journalist replied, dumbfounded. “If I had a child, I wouldn&#39;t sell it…[but] maybe 200 years from now it could be debated,” said Milei. &lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div>;&lt;div id=&quot;econ-5&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;But Milei&#39;s ideas don&#39;t seem to have hurt his ratings. In the presidential primaries in August, he was the surprise winner, nabbing 30% of the vote. In September, Tucker Carlson, a former Fox News host, uploaded an interview with Milei on X (previously known as Twitter) that has been viewed 422m times. (Elon Musk, X&#39;s owner, tweeted that the interview was “interesting”, though he later deleted his post.) &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Critics worry that Milei has authoritarian instincts. “He gets angry with dissent, he gets angry with those who think differently to him,” said Carlos Maslatón, a former friend and political backer whom Milei purged from his coalition last year along with dozens of others. He claimed that Milei felt threatened by people who took away too much of his limelight (Maslatón is a financial influencer). “This is the behaviour of a king from the time of monarchical absolutism. He is not a democratic person.” &lt;/p>;&lt;p data-caps=&quot;initial&quot;>;&lt;span data-caps=&quot;initial&quot;>;M&lt;/span>;ilei seems to believe that leading Argentina is his destiny. Maslatón said he asked Milei in 2022 whether he would throw his hat in the ring for the presidency; he responded that God had told him to turn Argentina liberal. Other sources have claimed that Milei has supernatural visions. In one, Ayn Rand, the libertarian philosopher, supposedly appeared to him in a bookshop. In another, he saw the resurrection of Christ. &lt;/p>;&lt;figure>;&lt;span itemscope=&quot;&quot; itemProp=&quot;image&quot; itemType=&quot;https://schema.org/ImageObject&quot;>;&lt;meta itemProp=&quot;url&quot; content=&quot;https://www.economist.com/img/b/1326/1326/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231013_1843_JAVIER_07.jpg&quot;/>;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; width=&quot;1326&quot; height=&quot;1326&quot; src=&quot;https://www.economist.com/img/b/1326/1326/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231013_1843_JAVIER_07.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/200/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231013_1843_JAVIER_07.jpg 200w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/300/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231013_1843_JAVIER_07.jpg 300w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/400/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231013_1843_JAVIER_07.jpg 400w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/600/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231013_1843_JAVIER_07.jpg 600w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/640/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231013_1843_JAVIER_07.jpg 640w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/800/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231013_1843_JAVIER_07.jpg 800w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/1000/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231013_1843_JAVIER_07.jpg 1000w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1280/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231013_1843_JAVIER_07.jpg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;figure>;&lt;span itemscope=&quot;&quot; itemProp=&quot;image&quot; itemType=&quot;https://schema.org/ImageObject&quot;>;&lt;meta itemProp=&quot;url&quot; content=&quot;https://www.economist.com/img/b/1252/1252/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231013_1843_JAVIER_08.jpg&quot;/>;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; width=&quot;1252&quot; height=&quot;1252&quot; src=&quot;https://www.economist.com/img/b/1252/1252/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231013_1843_JAVIER_08.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/200/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231013_1843_JAVIER_08.jpg 200w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/300/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231013_1843_JAVIER_08.jpg 300w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/400/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231013_1843_JAVIER_08.jpg 400w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/600/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231013_1843_JAVIER_08.jpg 600w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/640/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231013_1843_JAVIER_08.jpg 640w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/800/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231013_1843_JAVIER_08.jpg 800w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/1000/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231013_1843_JAVIER_08.jpg 1000w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1280/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231013_1843_JAVIER_08.jpg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;p>;Esotericism crops up surprisingly often in Argentina&#39;s political history: Carlos Menem, the president who privatised state-owned companies in the 1990s, consulted a seer ahead of big decisions. But Milei&#39;s spirituality seems at least partly linked to an attempt to deal with loss and trauma. His visions appear to have become more frequent since the death of his beloved dog in 2017. According to González, he visited a medium to contact Conan in the afterlife. (Milei hasn&#39;t denied rumours that he consults his pets on political strategy; “​​if so,” he has said, “they are the best political analysts in the world.”) &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Before Conan&#39;s death, Milei had sent a sample of the dog&#39;s tissue to Per&lt;small>;PET&lt;/small>;uate in Massachusetts, a “genetic preservation” company. Scientists there grew cells from it and sent them to a cloning facility in Texas. After the puppies were born, researchers at the University of California, Davis, made sure their &lt;small>;DNA&lt;/small>; was identical to Conan&#39;s. The process cost $50,000. “[Milei] told me that these clones are the most important thing in his life,” said Dr Ron Gillespie from Per&lt;small>;PET&lt;/small>;uate. He remains in touch with Milei, who pays $100 a year to preserve Conan&#39;s cells in case he&#39;d like to clone more animals in the future. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;An interest in the mystical has also prompted Milei to consider converting to Judaism. He has begun consulting a rabbi and says his first trip abroad as president would be to Israel. The week I interviewed him, he told me he was travelling to New York to pray at an ultra-Orthodox congregation before Shabbat; he explained that Moses, who led the Jewish people out of Egypt and into the promised land, was an inspiration. In other interviews he has gone further, likening his sister, Karina, to Moses and himself to Aaron, Moses&#39;s brother and spokesperson.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;cite>;Milei hasn&#39;t denied rumours that he consults his pets on political strategy; “​​if so,” he has said, “they are the best political analysts in the world” &lt;/cite>; &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Milei calls Karina a being of supreme “spiritual purity”. Ever since he decided to run for Congress, she has been his gatekeeper. Everything related to Milei&#39;s career – including, according to one source, the catering for party meetings – must be approved by her. Despite her outsized role, little is known about her other than that she studied public relations, ran a pastry business and enjoys reading tarot cards. Like her brother, she is not married and loves dogs: both siblings refer to their pets as their “four-legged children”. Perhaps not coincidentally, Karina&#39;s dog is called Aaron.&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-caps=&quot;initial&quot;>;&lt;span data-caps=&quot;initial&quot;>;M&lt;/span>;ilei&#39;s autobiography includes a chapter written by his sister, in which she describes how she identified the aspects of her brother&#39;s personality that could make him a successful politician. Recalling his teenage rock concerts, Karina reports: “At every show he would do a kind of striptease, flinging his &lt;small>;T&lt;/small>;-shirt or some other piece of clothing, and I would fight with the screaming fans to recover the clothes.” Years later, when her brother became famous, she noticed “that people saw him as a rock star: they not only wanted to listen to him but also to touch him and have their picture taken with him.” She realised that the key to helping her brother spread his libertarian ideas was to organise events that “not only provided academic content but also made the audience feel passionate and excited”. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Karina&#39;s hand is evident in Milei&#39;s rock-inspired campaign events, which often feel more theatrical than political. Recently he has started wielding a chainsaw, to demonstrate how he plans to tear up the status quo. Such tactics seem to appeal to his young, male-dominated base. In a survey conducted in September by Premise, a research and data company based in San Francisco, for &lt;i>;The Economist&lt;/i>;, 60% of respondents aged 18 to 25 had a favourable or very favourable view of Milei, compared with only 39% of respondents aged over 45. In the same survey, among men aged 18 to 25, Milei&#39;s approval ratings reached 74%, compared with slightly less than half for women of the same age.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“In any other country in the world young people normally tend to be on the left. But here the youth has turned to the liberal or libertarian right in just a few years,” said Maslatón, the former friend. People in their 20s grew up mostly under the left-wing presidencies of Néstor and Cristina Kirchner, the husband-and-wife politicians who ruled the country separately between 2003 and 2015 (Cristina is currently Argentina&#39;s vice-president). After the Kirchners, the country was governed by a centre-right administration, and is now run by a centre-left one. Being left-wing in Argentina isn&#39;t rebellious. But becoming a libertarian? That&#39;s how to shock your parents. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Many on the left are unnerved by how popular Milei&#39;s ideas are with working-class voters. Héctor Abel Espinoza, a 32-year-old who lives in a slum called Villa 31 in Buenos Aires, opened a liquor store called Liberty 31 in honour of Liberty Advances. The yellow flag of libertarianism, which features a coiled snake over the motto “Don&#39;t tread on me”, hangs behind the counter. &lt;/p>;&lt;figure>;&lt;span itemscope=&quot;&quot; itemProp=&quot;image&quot; itemType=&quot;https://schema.org/ImageObject&quot;>;&lt;meta itemProp=&quot;url&quot; content=&quot;https://www.economist.com/img/b/2000/2000/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231013_1843_JAVIER_09.jpg&quot;/>;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; width=&quot;2000&quot; height=&quot;2000&quot; src=&quot;https://www.economist.com/img/b/2000/2000/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231013_1843_JAVIER_09.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/200/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231013_1843_JAVIER_09.jpg 200w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/300/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231013_1843_JAVIER_09.jpg 300w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/400/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231013_1843_JAVIER_09.jpg 400w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/600/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231013_1843_JAVIER_09.jpg 600w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/640/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231013_1843_JAVIER_09.jpg 640w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/800/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231013_1843_JAVIER_09.jpg 800w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/1000/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231013_1843_JAVIER_09.jpg 1000w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1280/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231013_1843_JAVIER_09.jpg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;figure>;&lt;span itemscope=&quot;&quot; itemProp=&quot;image&quot; itemType=&quot;https://schema.org/ImageObject&quot;>;&lt;meta itemProp=&quot;url&quot; content=&quot;https://www.economist.com/img/b/1168/1168/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231013_1843_JAVIER_10.jpg&quot;/>;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; width=&quot;1168&quot; height=&quot;1168&quot; src=&quot;https://www.economist.com/img/b/1168/1168/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231013_1843_JAVIER_10.jpg&quot; srcSet=&quot;https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/200/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231013_1843_JAVIER_10.jpg 200w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/300/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231013_1843_JAVIER_10.jpg 300w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/400/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231013_1843_JAVIER_10.jpg 400w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/600/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231013_1843_JAVIER_10.jpg 600w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/640/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231013_1843_JAVIER_10.jpg 640w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/800/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231013_1843_JAVIER_10.jpg 800w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/1000/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231013_1843_JAVIER_10.jpg 1000w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1280/90/media-assets/image/1843_20231013_1843_JAVIER_10.jpg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/figure>;&lt;p>;Espinoza grew up in a small mud house with a tin roof in one of Argentina&#39;s poorest provinces, on the border with Bolivia. His parents, who were street vendors, couldn&#39;t read or write; Espinoza recalls seeing officers kick his mother&#39;s fruit-juice stall down because she didn&#39;t have the proper permits. Later, when he moved to Buenos Aires, he couldn&#39;t find a flat without reams of paperwork he didn&#39;t possess. Like millions of other Argentines, Espinoza learned to hustle on the black market, saving up until he could open his own shop – but he still had to ask a better-off friend from university for help registering the store. For him, these experiences “generated hatred and contempt” towards the state. Milei&#39;s rhetoric and proposal to slash red tape were instantly appealing. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Milei&#39;s support with the working class outside city slums is even more striking: in the primaries, his strongest showing was in some of Argentina&#39;s poorest and most remote provinces. Even if Milei is not elected president, Espinoza said he “has already won” because “he has managed to initiate a discussion that didn&#39;t exist before.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p data-caps=&quot;initial&quot;>;&lt;span data-caps=&quot;initial&quot;>;W&lt;/span>;hen I met Milei this September, in a nondescript office building in Buenos Aires,&lt;!-- -->; he was disarmingly polite, with an impish air. He was back to being the wonky professor, rattling off names of obscure economists like Hans Hermann-Hoppe and Walter Block, and some better-known ones like Milton Friedman (many times). I caught glimpses of the &lt;i>;bonachon&lt;/i>;, or good guy, too. As if I was the one who had lost 20kg, he repeatedly implored the maid to bring me &lt;i>;medialunas&lt;/i>;, Argentina&#39;s syrup-covered answer to croissants. When, after an hour, I got up to leave, he asked me to stay for another two because he liked chatting with me. He gave me a copy of one of his books, and wrote in dedication: “Keep doing your marvellous work!” &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Yet I found our interaction somewhat unsettling as well. In appearance and demeanour, Milei seemed overwhelmed; he answered several of my questions robotically, as if he was looking for cues to play his part. He became most animated when I remarked that his vision for Argentina seemed to have a strong moral component. Raising his voice, he responded “it is absolutely moral!” and claimed that “the state is the institutional manifestation of violence.”&lt;!-- -->; When I asked in turn why he&#39;d made insulting remarks about his opponents, he insisted that &lt;small>;TV&lt;/small>; producers had wound him up to improve ratings. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;cite>;An adviser has heard that Milei often weeps with nerves. “This is a guy who has not been in politics and all of a sudden he is the leading candidate who says he is going to change Argentina”&lt;/cite>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Milei seems to get particularly vexed when asked probing technical questions. I spoke to an adviser who is unconvinced about his boss&#39;s&lt;!-- -->; grasp of macroeconomics. Whenever confronted by an analyst who claims it will be hard to dollarise the economy, Milei, said the adviser, will typically provide a complicated-sounding response that does not answer the question. “And you are left scratching your head, like &#39;what does he mean?&#39; But by then has moved on to another subject.” &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;He has heard that Milei often weeps with nerves. “This is a guy who has not been in politics and all of a sudden he is the leading candidate who says he is going to change Argentina. And he realises that he does not have the ability to sing, dance and play the music.” Rather than delegate to his advisers, some of whom are renowned economists, Milei often doubles down on what he thinks is right. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Doubling down on his instincts may be dangerous for Argentina. In recent weeks, Milei has continued attacking the viability of the peso (“The peso is the currency issued by the Argentine politician and therefore is worth less than excrement,” he recently said on the radio), hastening its decline. Economists worry that his flagship policy of dollarisation carries many risks – not least because the net reserves of Argentina&#39;s central bank are $5bn in the red, and the country cannot borrow dollars easily. Dollarisation would mean exchanging all the pesos in circulation plus those held in banks, which Milei&#39;s team estimates will require between $40bn and $90bn (&lt;small>;GDP&lt;/small>; is $630bn). The policy could represent a quick fix to inflation, but it may not solve the underlying issue of high government spending. &lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div>;&lt;div id=&quot;econ-6&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Since Milei&#39;s coalition is mostly a one-man show, he is not expected to get many deputies elected to Argentina&#39;s Congress. This means it might be difficult to implement what he calls his “chainsaw plan” through traditional avenues. In a recent interview, Milei said that if people surround the presidential palace to protest changes he wants to make to welfare policies, “they will have to drag me out dead.” He has also said that he would take some of his proposals to referendum if Congress does not approve them, which would further undermine the country&#39;s weak institutions. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;As I left the interview, I couldn&#39;t help but think that the well-mannered Milei bidding me farewell was not the one who would run the country – that Milei owes his fame to the provocative attacks he has made on the status quo. His tendency to get angry with his critics and deflect blame for his offensive behaviour suggests he would not remain a calm or rational decision-maker if challenged by Congress. “One of the things that has made him so popular is that he represents an important segment of society that is angry, and that wants to be represented by someone who is also angry,” said Beker, the university professor. Although Milei may yet lose the election (recent polls show that a more centrist candidate has made inroads by tapping moderate and apolitical voters), it is this version of him who could assume the presidency. If that happens, then Argentina had better brace itself. &lt;span data-ornament=&quot;ufinish&quot;>;■&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;b>;Ana Lankes&lt;/b>; is &lt;i>;The Economist&lt;/i>;&#39;s Latin America correspondent &lt;br/>;&lt;br/>;&lt;small>;IMAGES: GETTY, EYEVINE, Shutterstock&lt;/small>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 15 Oct 2023 21:57:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Scientists have published an atlas of the brain | Science & technology]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2023/10/12/scientists-have-published-an-atlas-of-the-brain]]><description> &lt;img src=&quot;https://images.weserv.nl/?url=www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/media-assets/image/20231014_STP002.jpg&quot;/>;&lt;div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-caps=&quot;initial&quot;>;&lt;span data-caps=&quot;initial&quot;>;L&lt;/span>;&lt;small>;ord Rutherford&lt;/small>;, the discoverer of the atomic nucleus, divided science into physics and stamp collecting. (He was, after all, a physicist.) But he had a point. Other sciences, such as astronomy, chemistry, geology and, most notably, biology, rely a lot on collecting things (not literally, in the case of astronomy) and classifying them in various ways that would delight philatelists. Physics, by contrast, relies on analysing phenomena.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;That said, the philatelist branches of science have been pretty successful, biology especially. And this week sees the addition of a new album to biology&#39;s collection, in the form of 21 papers about the brain and its cells. The work was done under the purview of the &lt;small>;BRAIN&lt;/small>; Initiative Cell Census Network, which is organised by the National Institutes of Health, in America. The papers are published in various bits of the American Association for the Advancement of Science&#39;s empire of journals, &lt;i>;Science&lt;/i>; and its spin-offs. They are intended to help answer three, related questions: what and where are a brain&#39;s cellular components; which cells are involved in neurological and psychiatric illnesses; and what makes the brains of &lt;i>;Homo sapiens&lt;/i>; different from those of other animals?&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div>;&lt;div id=&quot;econ-1&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Brains, particularly human ones, are the most complex objects in the known universe. That complexity is emphasised by the fact that, as these papers confirm, they are reckoned (depending on how you define such things) to contain about 3,000 different types of cell. For comparison, it was not so long ago that entire human bodies, brains included, were estimated to be built from just 300 cell types.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The estimate was confirmed by a team of researchers at the Karolinska Institute, in Stockholm, and the Allen Institute for Brain Science, in Seattle. They studied, post mortem, the brains of three men and a woman, taking 606 samples from nine regions of the organ and also one from the spinal cord. They then extracted the nuclei of individual cells and looked at the &lt;small>;RNA&lt;/small>; molecules therein.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;small>;RNA&lt;/small>; is chemically similar to &lt;small>;DNA&lt;/small>;, and comes in many varieties, each with a different job. One of the most important is to act as a messenger, carrying instructions for how to make particular proteins from the nucleus, where the genes that encode protein recipes are stored as &lt;small>;DNA&lt;/small>;, to the cellular factories, called ribosomes, which churn those proteins out. Analysing those &lt;small>;RNA&lt;/small>; messengers reveals which proteins are being made. And the proteins a cell produces determine what type of cell it is. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;On that basis, the two institutes&#39; researchers found 31 “superclusters” of cells with similar patterns of &lt;small>;RNA&lt;/small>; expression. These, in turn, divided into 461 clusters and 3,313 subclusters—in effect, individual cell types. Superclusters tended to be concentrated in one or a few brain regions (for example, the cerebral cortex had 16, the hippocampus had 12 and the cerebellum six). But there was an exception. This was a supercluster the team called “splatter neurons”. These turned up all over the place.&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div>;&lt;div id=&quot;econ-2&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Other groups dug into the details. Bing Ren of the University of California, San Diego and his colleagues, for example, attempted to characterise cells not directly by their messenger &lt;small>;RNA&lt;/small>; but rather by differences in the way the &lt;small>;DNA&lt;/small>; in their chromosomes was packaged. By allowing—or forbidding—access to the &lt;small>;DNA&lt;/small>;, such packaging helps regulate which genes are transcribed into &lt;small>;RNA&lt;/small>; messengers. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;This yielded 107 recognisable patterns. Intriguingly, some of these patterns could be correlated with neurological traits and illnesses. The team compared the locations of pieces of &lt;small>;DNA&lt;/small>; that control gene transcription, and which are known to have disease-associated variants, with the &lt;small>;DNA&lt;/small>;-packaging patterns of different sorts of cells. They found correlations with 19 conditions, including schizophrenia, depression, bipolar disorder, Alzheimer&#39;s disease and various forms of addiction.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;A third group, meanwhile, led by Rebecca Hodge and Trygve Bakken of the Allen Institute, compared the brains of humans with those of chimpanzees, gorillas, macaques (a group of old-world monkeys) and marmosets (a group of new-world monkeys), looking for clues to the elusive question of what makes human brains human. They found that part of the answer may lie not in the neurons themselves, but in the supporting cast of non-neuronal brain cells, called glial cells.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Clues to humanity&#39;s essence are likely to be found in parts of the genome called &lt;small>;HAR&lt;/small>;s and h&lt;small>;CONDEL&lt;/small>;s. &lt;small>;HAR&lt;/small>;s stands for “human accelerated regions”. These are bits of the genome that have remained unchanged in apes and monkeys, but which are altered in humans. h&lt;small>;CONDEL&lt;/small>;s—“human-conserved deletions”—are the opposite: places where &lt;small>;DNA&lt;/small>; found in apes and monkeys is missing in people. The team found that genes in and around both areas are often particularly active or particularly inactive in glial cells.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Glial cells come in three varieties: astrocytes, which regulate the flow of information across junctions between neurons; microglia, which prune links between neurons to keep the network in order; and oligodendrocytes, which insulate nerve fibres and tweak signals running along them. That suggests part of what gives human brains their humanness lies in these microscopic details of their architecture.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;A good start, then. But this work only scratches the surface of the brain&#39;s true complexity. To understand that properly requires not only listing and describing the various components, but also elucidating out how they are wired together into functional units. Collecting stamps is fine. But you need more than that to work out how a postal service operates. &lt;span data-ornament=&quot;ufinish&quot;>;■&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;i>;Curious about the world?

According to a post on October 12&lt;sup>;th&lt;/sup>; by OSINTtechnical, a reliable open-source intelligence account on X (formerly Twitter), during the attack&#39;s opening stages, probably within a period of 48 hours, Russia had lost 15 tanks, 33 infantry fighting vehicles and a number of artillery pieces, roughly an entire battalion&#39;s worth of kit. A source suggested Ukraine has continued to extract an enormous cost: perhaps 50 tanks and 100-odd armoured vehicles in total.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;As armoured columns begin advancing they are first &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2023/04/12/why-so-many-russian-tanks-fall-prey-to-ukrainian-mines&quot;>;slowed by minefields&lt;/a>; and then hit by artillery fire &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/08/27/inside-ukraines-drone-war-against-putin&quot;>;guided by drones&lt;/a>;.迄今为止，俄罗斯获得的领土估计不到两平方英里。同一天，总统弗拉基米尔·泽连斯基在 Telegram 上写道：“Avdiivka。我们坚守阵地。乌克兰的勇气和团结将决定这场战争如何结束。” &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Were it to happen, losing Avdiivka would be a blow to Ukrainian morale. Like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/12/06/russia-is-hurling-troops-at-the-tiny-ukrainian-town-of-bakhmut&quot;>;Bakhmut before it&lt;/a>;, the town, now in ruins with its 30,000 citizens long since evacuated, has become something of a symbol of Ukrainian resistance.自2014年以来，它已经抵御了俄罗斯支持的分裂分子长达八年的间歇性袭击。在过去18个月里，它经受住了俄罗斯军队的一系列袭击和大规模炮击。四月，俄罗斯包围该镇的尝试仅部分成功，仅在其北部和东部取得了进展。作为回应，乌克兰向该地区派遣了预备队，并建立了新的、坚固的防御阵地。 These are beside a 200 metre-high ash dump, created by the Avdiivka Coke and Chemical Plant (before the war one of the biggest coke producers in Europe), that towers above the battlefield.&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;div>;&lt;div id=&quot;econ-2&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;In the past couple of days some Russian sources have claimed that their forces have gained control of the coke plant.但智囊团战争研究所表示，没有证据证明这一点，并警告说，俄罗斯军事博客作者现在对他们可以报道的内容受到更多限制，以便军事指挥官控制流量的信息。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Russia&#39;s offensive ambitions may have been boosted in recent weeks by the arrival of 300 shipping containers full of munitions, according to America&#39;s government.武器输液于9月7日至10月1日期间抵达。官员们表示，此次转移包括大量炮弹，足以对战斗进程产生重大影响。乌克兰的反攻依赖于韩国的大量炮弹注入，未来几个月其射速将不可避免地下降。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The fight for the coke plant and the ash dump is likely to be hard and bitter in the days ahead.无论阿夫迪夫卡是否落入俄罗斯人手中，它仍然可能对乌克兰在南部的持续反攻产生负面影响。自八月份罗博坦解放以来，那里的进展已经放缓。西方官员怀疑，在冬季到来之前，前线是否会发生很大变化。如果乌克兰需要加强阿夫迪夫卡前线，它可能必须重新分配一些在奥里希夫以南作战的部队。这将进一步减少冬季到来之前取得突破的机会。 ■ &lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 15 Oct 2023 21:27:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Why films have become so ridiculously long | Culture]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/culture/2023/10/14/why-films-have-become-so-ridiculously-long]]><description> &lt;img src=&quot;https://images.weserv.nl/?url=www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/media-assets/image/20231014_CUP509.jpg&quot;/>;&lt;div>;&lt;

的数据来了解好莱坞的黄金时代。作品的平均时长增长了约 24%，从 1930 年代的 1 小时 21 分钟增加到 2022 年的 1 小时 47 分钟（见图表）。大片是最严重的罪犯。对于 10 部最受欢迎的影片（以 &lt;small>;IMDb 上有多少影评人对电影进行评分来衡量）&lt;/small>;，2022 年的平均长度延长至两个半小时左右，比 20 世纪 30 年代增加了近 50%。&lt;/small>; p>;&lt;p>;20 世纪 60 年代初，电影制作人开始制作长片。电影蓬勃发展，导演们希望将他们的艺术与电视区分开来。史诗片为银幕增光添彩，其中包括&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/2011/04/28/prince-of-his-disorder&quot;>;《阿拉伯的劳伦斯》&lt;/ a>; (1962)，超过了三个半小时的大关，以及 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.com/culture/2023/05/10/a-new-docu-drama -about-cleopatra-has-riled-officials-in-cairo&quot;>;《埃及艳后》&lt;/a>; (1963)，最初超过四个小时，但后来被删减。当时，电影演员们享受着中场休息，而放映员正在准备下一幕的胶片。 Runtimes of popular films ebbed and flowed over subsequent decades (and stretched long in some countries, such as India, known for its Bollywood sagas).但自 2018 年以来，它们一直在膨胀。&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div>;&lt;div id=&quot;econ-1&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;特许经营是这一趋势的驱动因素之一。电影公司希望从昂贵的知识产权中获得最大收益，但他们正在与流媒体平台争夺眼球。希望一部精彩、冗长的“事件”电影能够吸引观众离开小银幕，走进电影院。这种方法通常会得到回报：&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.com/search?q=avengers+endgame&quot;>;《复仇者联盟：终局之战》&lt;/a>;（2019 年），漫威长达三小时的超级英雄盛宴，是历史上票房第二高的电影。 2022 年，美国许多最成功的电影都是由长篇系列电影组成。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;任何吸引人们离开沙发去电影院看电影的事情对电影院来说都是好消息。英国电影集团兼电影发行商 Picturehouse 的董事总经理克莱尔·宾斯 (Clare Binns) 抱怨道，长时间的放映时间也带来了一个“根本问题”。长电影可能意味着放弃每晚放映两场，这会损害票房和利润。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;电影较长的另一个解释与导演影响力的增强有关。谁敢叫诺兰先生这样的人去修剪他的杰作？流媒体不必过多担心简洁性，因为观众可以随时暂停，这可能会吸引财力雄厚并承诺创作自由的大牌明星。 《花月杀手》上映后将在 AppleTV+ 上首播。 Netflix 资助并发行了斯科塞斯先生的同样长的&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.com/prospero/2019/10/31/the-irishman-is-an-engrossing-and-gloriously-funny-gangster-epic &quot;>;2019 年的《爱尔兰人》&lt;/a>;，这部电影如果有一个果断的剪辑师，无论是爱尔兰人还是其他人，都会受益匪浅。 &lt;span data-ornament=&quot;ufinish&quot;>;■&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 15 Oct 2023 18:57:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Ukraine war: what does victory look like? | Films]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.economist.com/films/2023/10/13/ukraine-war-what-does-victory-look-like]]><description> &lt;img src=&quot;https://images.weserv.nl/?url=www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/media-assets/image/20231013_FLP002.jpg&quot;/>;&lt;div>;&lt;
