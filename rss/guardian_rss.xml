&lt;p>;这些采访描述了根据美国法律和法律被视为潜在劳动力贩运标志的做法。联合国标准，包括使工人处于虐待性的工作和生活条件下，限制他们的行动，并对工资、工作条件和雇主身份做出虚假承诺。联合国标准还规定，私人招聘机构不得向工人收取任何费用或成本；应该由雇主向招聘公司支付费用。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;仓库工人描述的做法似乎也违反了亚马逊的劳工政策。在 2022 年的一份&lt;a href=&quot;https://sustainability.aboutamazon.com/modern-slavery-statement.pdf&quot;>;声明&lt;/a>;中，亚马逊表示其标准“认识到国内外移民工人的独特脆弱性”并且“明确规定，在招聘过程中的任何时候都不得向工人收取招聘费”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;人权组织国际特赦组织向《卫报》和其他媒体合作伙伴证实，它已经对这种待遇进行了自己的调查亚马逊沙特业务的尼泊尔工人。国际特赦组织表示，它与另一个非政府组织合作采访了 22 名工人，他们报告称自己遭受了虐待，包括被迫支付大笔招聘费以及在雇佣条款方面受到欺骗。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;艾拉·奈特 (Ella Knight)，伦敦人国际特赦组织的劳工权利研究员表示，该组织于 6 月份向亚马逊通报了这些问题，并于 8 月份提供了更全面的调查结果细节。奈特表示，国际特赦组织的调查和新闻媒体的单独调查很可能促使亚马逊决定公开承诺实施更强有力的控制，并确保工人得到招聘费用的补偿。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一些尼泊尔人工人们表示，他们不想将所有责任归咎于亚马逊。他们说，如果没有劳动力供应公司阻碍他们在这家跨国公司找到一份真正的工作，他们的处境可能还可以维持下去。一名现任员工表示，他希望公司创始人兼执行董事长杰夫·贝佐斯知道，他在目前的安排下正在遭受痛苦，但他“准备好去亚马逊的任何地方工作，如果是直接招聘的话”。&lt;/p >; &lt;p>;世界第三富豪贝索斯誓言要在 2021 年让亚马逊成为“地球上最好的雇主”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一位前员工向贝索斯传达了不同的信息：“你处于这个位置是因为我们的工作。如果没有来自尼泊尔、菲律宾、印度、孟加拉国、巴基斯坦和其他国家的劳工和帮助者的努力，你们就不会处于这样的境地。但你们却忽视了工人的担忧。”&lt;/p>; &lt;figure data-media-id=&quot;29bddad04b75576​​6664e04af55f624402569f712&quot;>;

&lt;p>;几位工人表示，亚马逊官员了解他们在沙特面临的许多问题阿拉伯。他们说，工人们向亚马逊仓库经理或人力资源代理抱怨工资低或少、住房条件差以及仓库工作压力大。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“他们了解我们的处境和痛苦，”阿米里·亚达夫 (Amiri Yadav) 说， 2021 年至 2023 年在沙特阿拉伯的亚马逊配送中心工作。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;亚马逊在声明中表示，“我们的供应链审计流程和我们自己的调查发现沙特阿拉伯违反了我们的标准”，这促使其采取行动处理投诉。该公司补充说，“我们工厂的工人可以通过多种方式报告他们所受到的待遇问题，包括 24 小时保密热线。”&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;贫穷的尼泊尔人希望在其中一家工作。全球最大品牌&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;亚马逊于 2017 年大举进军沙特阿拉伯，收购了中东在线零售巨头 Souq.com。后来，该公司将 Souq.com 的沙特业务重新命名为 &lt;a href=&quot;http://amazon.sa/&quot;>;Amazon.sa&lt;/a>;，并通过引进来自巴基斯坦、印度、孟加拉国和尼泊尔的工人来增加劳动力。亚马逊目前在沙特阿拉伯雇佣了近1,500名长期工和季节性工人。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;作为亚洲最贫穷的国家之一，尼泊尔长期以来一直是跨国工人的主要来源地。在2010-2011年的人口普查中，超过一半的尼泊尔家庭报告说他们从在国外工作的家庭成员那里收到了钱。 2021年，海外汇款占尼泊尔国内生产总值的近四分之一。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;曼苏尔感到有义务走向海外。他的家人每月靠大约 300 美元的收入以及在他们与叔叔的家人共享的五分之一英亩的土地上种植的稻米、小麦和草豌豆维持生计。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;许多尼泊尔工人都听说过关于出国的家人、邻居工作、生活条件差。他们知道要留意某些国家和雇主，并寻求直接就业，而不是为劳动力供应公司工作。但世界各地的移民和劳工政策往往对他们不利，导致他们最终受到剥削。 2017 年英国著名医学杂志《BMJ》发表的一项调查显示，大多数在国外工作过的尼泊尔男性表示，他们“在移民过程的各个阶段都经历过剥削”。一半的人报告称自己是欺骗性招聘行为的目标。&lt;/p>; &lt;aside>; &lt;blockquote>; &lt;p>;每个人都被困在国外就业中。不管你有多聪明，最后都会被骗&lt;/p>; &lt;footer>; &lt;cite>;在沙特阿拉伯亚马逊仓库工作的尼泊尔工人&lt;/cite>; &lt;/footer>; &lt;/blockquote>; &lt;/aside >; &lt;p>;“每个人都被困在国外就业”，一名目前在沙特阿拉伯亚马逊仓库工作的尼泊尔工人说道。 “无论你多么聪明，最终都会被欺骗。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这些条件迫使农民工做出惨淡的算盘——与其说是寻找最好的着陆点，不如说是寻找最不最糟糕的着陆点。可以赚到足够的工资，让交通和麻烦都值得。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当位于加德满都的尼泊尔招聘公司 Rove International 的代理人告诉他他可以在亚马逊找到一份工作时，曼苏尔做了一些研究。他认为像亚马逊这样的美国大公司可能与许多移民工人遇到的虐待雇主不同。他说，他知道“特工会撒谎”，因此他反复询问自己是否愿意成为亚马逊或劳动力供应公司的员工。曼苏尔说，该代理人“向我证实这是亚马逊的直接雇佣，这将改变我的生活”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当 Rove International 告诉他必须支付招聘费用时，他感到很惊讶费用约为 2,300 美元——特别是因为他知道尼泊尔政府将就业公司向前往沙特阿拉伯的工人收取的费用限制在 85 美元以下。另外六名在亚马逊沙特仓库寻找工作的尼泊尔人证实，Rove International 还向他们每人收取了超过 1000 美元的招聘费。与许多其他尼泊尔工人一样，曼苏尔表示，他支付这笔高昂的费用是因为他不想失去为亚马逊工作的机会。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;罗夫国际公司没有回答本文的详细问题清单。当记者周日参观其位于加德满都的办公室时，一名公司管理人员表示：“我们遵循政府制定的所有法律程序，这些工人知道他们将在哪里以及如何工作。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;尼泊尔工人正在前往据尼泊尔议会、最高法院和美国国务院称，沙特阿拉伯的工人尤其容易受到影响，因为尼泊尔政府未能执行禁止招聘机构收取高额费用的政策。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在一些阿拉伯国家寻找工作的工人由于&lt;em>;卡法拉&lt;/em>;制度，各国也面临风险，该制度是劳动法和移民法的矩阵，使雇主能够“几乎完全控制”移民工人的就业和移民身份，&lt;a href=&quot;https:/ /www.cfr.org/backgrounder/what-kafala-system&quot;>;根据外交关系委员会&lt;/a>;。在沙特阿拉伯和其他仍然存在&lt;em>;卡法拉&lt;/em>;制度形式的国家，许多外国工人担心如果离开雇主，他们会受到惩罚。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;抵达王国 – 前往令人不快的意外&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;2021 年 9 月，曼苏尔在贷款支付招募费后，从家中前往加德满都，搭乘半岛航空公司的航班——这是他第一次乘坐飞机，第一次离开尼泊尔。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当曼苏尔抵达利雅得时，亚马逊官员会见了曼苏尔和其他尼泊尔工人——至少曼苏尔是这么认为的。他说这些人要求他和其他人签署雇佣合同，但不允许他们阅读文件。曼苏尔说，他们被告知，如果不签字，他们将没有地方睡觉，也没有工作。&lt;/p>; &lt;figure data-media-id=&quot;68878906db00da8bf10908b37a1e8a8a74aa40b9&quot;>; &lt;img src=&quot;https: //media.guim.co.uk/68878906db00da8bf10908b37a1e8a8a74aa40b9/0_0_3448_2713/1000.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;插图：亚马逊工人在栅栏后面，保安在一旁观看。&quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; height=&quot;787&quot;>; &lt;/figure>; &lt;p>;“我没有阅读该文件就签署了文件，因为我很害怕，”他说。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;几天后，曼苏尔意识到在机场迎接他的人可能不是亚马逊官员。他开始在利雅得的亚马逊配送中心工作，并注意到他的绿色身份徽章与许多其他工人佩戴的蓝色徽章不同。一位巴基斯坦同事解释说，佩戴蓝色徽章的工人是亚马逊直接雇用的。那些佩戴绿色徽章的人毕竟不是亚马逊员工。他们是临时工。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;事实证明，曼苏尔的实际雇主是 Abdullah Fahad Al-Mutairi Co，这是一家沙特劳动力供应公司，通过向亚马逊和其他大公司出售劳动力来获利。记录显示，尼泊尔外国就业部门于 2021 年 9 月向曼苏尔和其他 36 名尼泊尔人发放了工作许可证，他们的劳动合同由尼泊尔招聘公司 Rove International 转给 Al-Mutairi。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;其中 49 人接受本文采访的 54 名尼泊尔工人表示，他们为 Al-Mutairi 工作。一些人表示，他们在离开尼泊尔之前就意识到了这一点，并继续前行，因为他们已经花了钱来支付招募费。但&lt;strong>; &lt;/strong>;42 人表示，他们直到抵达沙特阿拉伯之后才知道真相，而且在大多数情况下，是在他们贷款支付大笔招聘费用之后才知道真相。他们知道收回这些费用的机会很小，因此他们不得不留在沙特阿拉伯 - 为一个他们不想工作的雇主工作，以偿还贷款，使他们有可能找到不再工作的工作&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;更糟糕的是，工人们说，劳动力供应公司没有提供同工同酬。根据 ICIJ 获得的对工人的采访以及工资单和雇佣合同，在亚马逊仓库做白班的尼泊尔工人的月薪一般约为 350 美元。相比之下，几名尼泊尔工人表示，从事类似工作但属于亚马逊直接员工的同事每月收入约为 800 至 1,300 美元。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“搞什么鬼？”曼苏尔说。 “我们工作得越来越努力，但我们收到的薪水却少了很多。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Al-Mutairi 没有回应置评请求。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;亚马逊在声明中表示，自从在得知违反其标准的情况后，它与沙特公司密切合作，“以制定一项他们已同意的合规计划，以解决这些违规行为并遵守我们的标准。这包括确保他们的员工得到任何未付工资或工人支付的招聘费用的补偿，提供干净和安全的住宿，并且供应商致力于确保对工人的持续保护。”&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;梦想的工作成为一场噩梦&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;亚马逊在沙特阿拉伯的仓库非常庞大。其最新的配送中心于 5 月在利雅得开业，占地 390,000 平方英尺，共五层，容量为 270 万立方英尺。它可以容纳超过 900 万件商品，亚马逊表示，这足以填满 30 个奥林匹克规模的游泳池。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在亚马逊的配送中心内，速度非常快。拣货员在地板上走来走去，抓起物品并将其交给包装工，包装工一次要站几个小时。工人们表示，管理人员通过闭路摄像头和拣选员的扫描仪监视拣选员，如果他们扫描物品的速度不够快，就会将他们列为“空闲”。尼泊尔工人报告说，亚马逊的高级员工在仓库的过道里跟踪他们，大喊：“亚拉！亚拉！” Yalla！”——阿拉伯语感叹词，意思是“快点”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;曼苏尔说，在正常的轮班中，他和其他拣货员要在仓库地板上行走多达 9 英里。 “我会感到非常虚弱。我的腿会疼，”他说。 “当我回到家时，我会感觉自己被针扎着，或者赤脚走在石头上。我的整个身体都会疼痛。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在销售高峰期（例如销售或假期），主管会监控洗手间的活动，有时还会警告他们，工人们说，因为他们离开仓库地板的时间太多。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; >; &lt;p>;“他们希望我们在工作需求量很大时不要休息，”2021 年至 2022 年底在沙特阿拉伯亚马逊仓库工作的苏伦德拉·库马尔·拉马 (Surendra Kumar Lama) 说道。“他们会站在卫生间附近，水站，因为工人们害怕它们。很多时候，我等了半个小时或一个小时才去洗手间，因为他们就在那里。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在亚马逊仓库工作了很长时间后，工人们回到家，住在 Al-Mutairi 提供的住宿环境中。许多人说，这些住房单元狭窄又肮脏，蟑螂在地板上爬行，供水有限且含盐分高，导致出现皮疹和脱发。工人们说，通常有六到八个人挤在一个房间里睡觉和吃饭，房间里摆着双层床。&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;工人们说，当他们试图抽出时间参加尼泊尔家乡的葬礼、出生和其他家庭活动时，劳务供应公司也会让事情变得困难。 23 名现任和前任工人表示，在这种情况下，Al-Mutairi 为工人提供了两种选择。他可以预先支付一大笔罚款。或者，他可以说服同事签署一份“担保人”合同，同意如果他不返回沙特阿拉伯完成合同，则代表他支付罚款。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一名前工人说他错过了儿子的出生和父亲的葬礼，因为穆泰里不让他回家。他说，即使在他向公司出示了父亲的死亡证明后，公司仍表示，只有缴纳 1,600 美元的罚款（超过四个月的工资），他才能离开。他说，他负担不起，也找不到愿意签字作为他的担保人的同事。&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;“每天，我们都担心第二天可能会被解雇。一名仍在利雅得亚马逊仓库工作的尼泊尔人说：“我们每天都在工作，就像工作的最后一天一样。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;工人们表示，在亚马逊仓库的 iPhone 和其他物品被盗后，他们的恐惧感与日俱增。公司加强安全保卫。他们声称保安人员对尼泊尔工人更加怀疑，并对其中一些人提出虚假指控，以此为借口解雇他们。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“保安人员的权力如此之大，甚至经理也无法帮助工人， ”在沙特阿拉伯多个亚马逊仓库工作的 Hem Thapa 说道。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;担任拣货员的 Sanjay Kumar Mahara 表示，今年早些时候，他不小心取出了两块货物，因此被错误地指控盗窃。当他试图填写一件订单时，他从货架上取下珠宝。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一名警卫在过道上拦住了他，搜查了他用来将物品从货架上运送到包装工的手提袋，发现了两个马哈拉说，然后带他去见经理。当警卫和经理用阿拉伯语说话时——马哈拉听不懂——马哈拉试图用英语讲述他的故事。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;他被告知在问题解决期间不要回到仓库。他说，效果很好，但几天后 Al-Mutairi 把他送上了返回尼泊尔的航班。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“如果工作中出现任何错误，亚马逊应该调查并尝试解决问题，”Mahara说。 “但他们急于解雇工人。我感到不公平。但我能做什么呢？”&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;没有工作、肮脏的住房、很少的食物&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;工人们说，一旦他们被解雇或下岗，新的磨难就开始了。 They&#39;re booted out of housing reserved for those working at Amazon, they say, and shunted to even worse housing set aside for those without jobs. They receive no wages or food allowance. Many languish for weeks or months, they say, waiting for Al-Mutairi to place them back with Amazon or some other business.&lt;/p>; &lt;aside>; &lt;blockquote>; &lt;p>;I cry out when I look back at my past month. I never imagined I could have such a life&lt;/p>; &lt;footer>; &lt;cite>;A recently fired worker stuck in Riyadh&lt;/cite>; &lt;/footer>; &lt;/blockquote>; &lt;/aside>; &lt;p>;“I cry out when I look back at my past month,” says a recently fired worker who is stuck in Riyadh. “I never imagined I could have such a life.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Unemployed Nepalis describe their new lodgings as “dirty” and “abandoned” – a building without beds or internet service. When workers get laid off en masse, they often can&#39;t find even a tiny space in the building to sleep because it is already occupied by dozens of other jobless workers.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During Mansur&#39;s time there, he survived by eating &lt;em>;kuboos –&lt;/em>; Arab flatbread – once a day and borrowing money from his former co-workers. Some days, he says, he didn&#39;t eat at all. When his friends couldn&#39;t support him any more and Al-Mutairi didn&#39;t find him another job, he decided to ask his family to take out a big loan so he could pay the exit penalty and go back to Nepal.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The only way to escape, he says, was to pay the $1,300 fee demanded by the labor supply firm as a penalty for leaving before the end of his two-year contract. It was an enormous sum for Mansur and his family.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the end, his family sunk itself even deeper in debt by taking out a loan – at 36% interest – to pay the exit fee.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“It was better going home than dying of hunger,” he says.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Other jobless workers slipped away from the accommodations and worked illegal, off-the-grid jobs.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Loneliness, hunger and stress pushed many jobless workers toward dark turns of thought. Yadav, one of the workers who says he was fired after being falsely accused of theft, says Al-Mutairi managers refused to let him go home to Nepal until he threatened to “record a video complaining about you and commit suicide”.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Manish Kumar Sodari, another worker who landed in the oblivion of unemployment, says he spent days caring for another laid-off worker who was talking about hanging himself. Soon, Sodari says, he began having suicidal thoughts himself.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“How can one stay helpless for three to four months?” he told a reporter in January. “I have already suffered a lot. I am at the last stage.”&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Home – for now&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Sodari got home by getting himself arrested. He did this, he says, with help from a man who is familiar with how difficult it is for Nepali workers to escape Saudi Arabia. The man advised him to go to a certain street and loiter until he was approached by a police officer.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sodari says he was taken to jail after admitting he didn&#39;t have a job or valid residency permit. He spent about two weeks in detention, he says, then the Saudi government deported him. He stayed briefly in Nepal before heading out to seek a job in India.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another former Amazon warehouse worker, Thapa, returned to Nepal before taking a job in India at a garment store. He had to leave home again to find work, he says, because almost all of his earnings in Saudi Arabia went to repay the loan that had paid the recruiting fee for his Amazon job.&lt;/p>; &lt;aside>; &lt;blockquote>; &lt;p>;I couldn&#39;t save money working in Saudi. I went empty-handed. I returned empty-handed&lt;/p>; &lt;footer>; &lt;cite>;A former Amazon warehouse worker&lt;/cite>; &lt;/footer>; &lt;/blockquote>; &lt;/aside>; &lt;p>;“I couldn&#39;t save money working in Saudi,” he says. “I went empty-handed. I returned empty-handed.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Other former Amazon workers are in worse financial shape. They&#39;re deep in debt, they say, because of recruiting fees, low wages, layoffs and exit penalties.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Mansur feels guilty about the loans that he and his family took out to get him to the Persian Gulf and bring him back to Nepal. Interest charges are piling up. He fears the village moneylenders will seize the family&#39;s patch of land.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“I lost time and money working at Amazon. I lost everything,” he says. “I lost my body and my strength … My family&#39;s financial situation is devastated now.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But like many migrant workers around the globe, Mansur isn&#39;t going to let a harrowing experience stop him from trying to find an employer that pays a fair wage and treats him decently. He&#39;s begun to look again for an overseas job. He&#39;s open to working most anywhere – except Saudi Arabia.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;em>;Contributors: freelance journalist Shyam Karki; Delphine Reuter from the ICIJ; Andy Lehren and Anna Schecter from NBC News; Tanka Dhakal, Eman Alqaisi, Mara Kessler and Hoda Osman from Arab Reporters for Investigative Journalism&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>; &lt;p>;This story was supported by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://fij.org/&quot;>;Fund for Investigative Journalism&lt;/a>; and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mcgrawcenter.org/&quot;>;McGraw Center for Business Journalism&lt;/a>; at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.journalism.cuny.edu/&quot;>;Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism&lt;/a>; at the City University of New York&lt;/p>;&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 10 Oct 2023 17:22:01 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Global economy proving ‘remarkably resilient’ to recent shocks, says IMF]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/oct/10/global-economy-proving-remarkably-resilient-to-recent-shocks-says-imf]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-10T08:00:34Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/202a21b2281feb037444716003ad88c2972f638e/0_152_4554_2732/master/4554.jpg?w=600&amp;fit=bounds&amp;sig-ignores-params=true&amp;s=f1d5c8bfb118da5ba9305df6ae38247b&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;Shoppers on a wet Oxford Street in London&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Fears of a worldwide recession triggered by the war in Ukraine and a cost of living crisis will prove unfounded, according to a health check from the International Monetary Fund.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/apr/11/uk-economy-shrink-imf-euro-area-energy-costs-inflation&quot;>;half-yearly world economic outlook&lt;/a>;, which was produced before the surprise attack on Israel by Hamas, the IMF said growth had shown “remarkable resilience” in the face of a series of adverse shocks in recent years with activity slowing but not stalling.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Releasing its update at its annual meeting in Marrakech, the IMF said it detected little evidence of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jun/20/would-a-wageprice-spiral-cause-inflation-to-get-out-of-control&quot;>;wage-price spiral&lt;/a>; but warned central banks against cutting interest rates too quickly.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It said several headwinds to growth had subsided since its spring meeting in Washington in April. The World Health Organization no longer considered Covid-19 a global health emergency, supply chains had largely returned to normal, and financial conditions had eased after the US and Swiss authorities acted to contain turbulence in their banking sectors.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The World Economic Outlook (WEO) report said global growth was expected to fall from 3.5% in 2022 to 3% this year and 2.9% in 2024. The 2023 forecast was unchanged from the IMF&#39;s last set of predictions in July, with the 2024 estimate revised down by 0.1 percentage points.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The US is expected to grow by 2.1% in 2023 and 1.5% in 2024, up 0.3 and 0.5 percentage points respectively since July, while the eurozone is forecast to grow by 0.7% this year and 1.2% in 2024, down 0.2 and 0.3 points respectively.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The UK, despite having its growth forecast revised up by 0.1 points to 0.5% this year, is expected to be &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jan/31/britain-only-g7-economy-expected-shrink-2023-imf&quot;>;the second weakest economy&lt;/a>; in the G7 group of major industrial nations after Germany, and to fall to the bottom of the league table in 2024 with growth of 0.6%, down 0.4 points on July.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the 2024 forecast is based on an interest rate forecast that the IMF says is out of date. When the WEO was being prepared last month, the IMF&#39;s assumption was that the Bank of England&#39;s ceiling for borrowing costs would be 6%. After Threadneedle Street&#39;s decision to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/sep/21/bank-of-england-keeps-interest-rates-hold&quot;>;pause raising rates&lt;/a>; at the September meeting of its monetary policy committee, the IMF now believes the peak will be 5.25% or 5.5%.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The decline in UK growth reflected “tighter monetary policies to curb still high inflation and lingering impacts of the terms-of-trade shock from high energy prices”, the IMF said.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, the IMF&#39;s economic counsellor, said: “The global economy continues to recover slowly from the blows of the pandemic, Russia&#39;s invasion of Ukraine, and the cost of living crisis. In retrospect, the resilience has been remarkable.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“As a result, projections are increasingly consistent with a &#39;soft landing&#39; scenario, bringing inflation down without a major downturn in activity, especially in the US, where the forecast increase in unemployment is very modest, from 3.6 to 3.9% by 2025.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Gourinchas said the slowdown was more pronounced in advanced economies compared with emerging markets, and that the US had “surprised on the upside, with resilient consumption” while the eurozone had been revised downward.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He said that even though recession would be averted, the global economy was limping along rather than sprinting.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He highlighted five key risks to the forecasts, namely a real estate crisis in China, a rise in commodity prices, inflation remaining stubbornly high, a crash in financial markets or high levels of borrowing preventing governments from easing policy in the face of fresh shocks.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Gourinchas said labour markets in developed economies remained buoyant, with historically low unemployment rates helping to support activity.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“So far, there is scant evidence of a &#39;wage-price spiral&#39; and real wages remain below pre-pandemic levels,” he added.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The WEO said many countries were near the peak of their interest rate raising cycles and little further tightening of policy was warranted. “However, easing prematurely would squander the gains achieved in the past 18 months,” it said.&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 10 Oct 2023 16:22:01 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Poland’s polarised election campaign heats up ahead of crucial vote – live]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/oct/10/poland-polarised-election-campaign-crucial-vote-live]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-10T07:31:54Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6fea806f8f6ee2ed55826046990193d085b68e8f/0_106_8044_4826/master/8044.jpg?w=600&amp;fit=bounds&amp;sig-ignores-params=true&amp;s=a59829593c381b0155d10b83fc1f8b20&quot;

&lt;p>;But researchers also warn that the vast majority of new plant discoveries are endangered species, which should be listed as threatened with extinction by default, warning that three-quarters of undescribed species are likely to be at risk of disappearing.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From the residents of the human microbiome to the largest known terrestrial organism on the planet, fungi are second only to invertebrates in their diversity – they are found in the air, inside plants and animals, and in the soil and ocean, in many shapes and sizes. More than 90% of them remain unknown to science, according to researchers at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, &lt;a href=&quot;https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/hub/global-plant-diversity-and-distribution-special-collection&quot;>;who have released a new estimate&lt;/a>; of fungi diversity as part of a report on the health of the world&#39;s plants and fungi, finding that there are probably about 2.5m species with only 155,000 identified so far.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“This is uncharted territory,” said Prof Alexandre Antonelli, director of science at RBG Kew. “Over the last few years, we&#39;ve seen an increasing appreciation for the role of fungi in everything … They are sustaining our life, our vegetation, they are absolutely crucial for every single animal species.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Now we have DNA analysis, we are trying to push frontiers. It&#39;s quite similar thing to explore the outer universe. Fungi are the dark matter.”&lt;/p>; &lt;aside>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Related: &lt;/span>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jan/09/fungi-extreme-heat-aoe&quot;>;The burning question about fungi: what happens to them in extreme heat?&lt;/a>;&lt;/p>; &lt;/aside>; &lt;p>;Scientists&#39; excitement at this undiscovered world was tempered by concern at the threat of extinction faced by many newly discovered species. Of the vascular plant species identified in 2020, researchers found more than 77% already met the criteria for threatened, 59% of species were likely to meet the criteria for endangered, and 24% likely to meet the criteria for critically endangered. With 350,000 species of vascular plants known to science, researchers believe about 100,000 are yet to be identified, but as many as one in three of those are likely to be threatened with extinction, the RBG Kew report estimates.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Kew scientists say all newly described species should be treated as being threatened unless it can be shown otherwise.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Researchers around the world are encouraging the public to help with their identification efforts, which have been revolutionised by new DNA sequencing techniques that have found hundreds of fungi species in a single teaspoon of soil. &lt;a href=&quot;https://fungiforthefuture.org/&quot;>;In the Netherlands&lt;/a>;, one scheme offers the public the chance to name any new fungi species found in soil samples they send in to the laboratory.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since 2020, about 10,200 new fungi species have been formally described, but scientific advances mean that researchers are hopeful they could identify 50,000 new fungi species a year.

Initially we were only looking at mushrooms and lichens,” she said. “Now, it&#39;s the gut microbiome. Many, many human diseases now are shown to be caused by fungus or by an imbalance in your fungal community. Fungi underground connect trees and establish symbiotic relationships with the roots of trees and they exchange nutrients and water. You are breathing spores of fungi right now.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The report says identifying and describing new plant and fungi species is a crucial challenge for biodiversity science. Researchers highlighted 32 plant diversity “darkspots” where there are critical knowledge gaps, with Colombia, New Guinea and south-central China having the greatest shortfalls.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“The problem is that we have lots of knowledge gaps. We have lots of places around the world where we have not yet collected enough [plants] or collected a very biased proportion of the biodiversity,” Antonelli said. “The idea [with darkspots] was really to identify those areas where we can get the most cost benefits.

The principles of civilian government have been completely ignored in Rwanda.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;HRW calls on the UK to rescind the migration and economic development partnership that Braverman&#39;s predecessor, Priti Patel, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/13/priti-patel-finalises-plan-to-send-asylum-seekers-to-rwanda&quot;>;signed with Rwanda in 2022&lt;/a>;, in light of the “real risks” that asylum seekers would face, and to investigate threats to Rwandan residents in Britain and make future assistance to the aid-dependent African state conditional on significant change to its “repressive practices”.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A spokeswoman for the Rwandan government accused HRW of “distorting the reality of Rwanda”. A post on X, formerly known as Twitter, said: “Any balanced assessment of Rwanda&#39;s record in advancing the rights, wellbeing and dignity of Rwandans over the past 29 years would recognise remarkable, transformational progress. Rwanda will not be deterred from this work by bad-faith actors advancing a politicised agenda.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Rwanda, the scene of a 1994 genocide in which up to 1 million people died, is often hailed as a miracle of development. Paul Kagame, who has been president since 2000 and recently announced his intention to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-66865681&quot;>;run for a fourth term&lt;/a>;, is regarded as one of Africa&#39;s most proactive, if hardline, heads of state.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the picture that HRW paints is at odds with the former British prime minister Boris Johnson&#39;s description of Rwanda as a place where asylum seekers could “prosper and thrive”.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Drawing on interviews with more than 150 people in the UK, Australia, the US, Canada, Belgium, France and a handful of African states, HRW said it had documented more than a dozen cases of killings, kidnappings, enforced disappearances and physical attacks targeting Rwandans abroad. The lengths to which authorities go in order to silence exiles, who are sometimes &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/news/2021/jul/19/hotel-rwanda-activist-daughter-pegasus-surveillance&quot;>;tracked using Pegasus spyware&lt;/a>; and relentlessly harassed and smeared online, are extraordinary, the report says.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It documents the deaths on foreign soil of Rwandan opposition figures such as Seif Bamporiki, a senior member of the Rwanda National Congress who was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/22/world/africa/rwanda-seif-bamporiki-killing.html&quot;>;shot dead in a Cape Town township&lt;/a>; in 2021, and exiles such as Selemen Masiya, a football coach stabbed in northern Mozambique in 2022 who was merely an outspoken government critic.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Inside Rwanda, HRW details multiple cases of harassment, arbitrary detention, torture and sometimes the disappearance of relatives of suspected dissidents – tactics apparently adopted to persuade exiles to censor themselves or return home. “The targeting of relatives is a particularly vicious form of control,” the report&#39;s authors note.&lt;/p>; &lt;figure data-media-id=&quot;f50729153f5c825ef5caa0a726d304397cafe0ee&quot;>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://media.guim.co.uk/f50729153f5c825ef5caa0a726d304397cafe0ee/124_0_4544_2726/1000.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Paul Rusesabagina in court in Kigali in 2020&quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; height=&quot;600&quot;>; &lt;figcaption>; &lt;span>;The hotelier turned human rights activist Paul Rusesabagina in court in Kigali in 2020.&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;Photograph: AFP/Getty Images&lt;/span>; &lt;/figcaption>; &lt;/figure>; &lt;p>;The report cites the example of Lionel Richie Nishimwe, an advocate of the Rwanda refugee community in Zambia, who caved in to pressure to return to Rwanda.

When he refused to be recruited by the Rwandan high commission in Singapore, he was publicly threatened by the high commissioner. Two of his brothers who were based abroad later returned to Rwanda to buy land and were seized by police and tortured, along with a nephew. Both brothers have since disappeared.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The report&#39;s depiction of a politicised judicial system and police force and an intelligence service committed to crushing dissent raises questions about the kind of lives asylum seekers settling there could expect to lead.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Kerry Smith, of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.asylumaid.org.uk/what-we-do/rwanda-litigation&quot;>;Asylum Aid&lt;/a>;, said: “This report is another strong piece of evidence suggesting the original reasons the Foreign Office decided not to put Rwanda on the list of possible destinations for asylum seekers it drew up for the Home Office still hold good.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;HRW is critical of the UN – in particular its refugee arm, the UNHCR – and foreign governments and law enforcement agencies who it says are aware of Rwanda&#39;s tactics but do little more than alert Rwandan exiles to the dangers they face. In 2011, the Metropolitan police &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/may/20/rwanda-exiles-warned-assassination-threat&quot;>;warned three prominent Rwandan citizens in London&lt;/a>; that their government posed an immediate threat to their lives, but no one was arrested.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Turning a blind eye to Rwanda&#39;s human rights record has allowed the country to position itself as a valuable partner for peacekeeping missions in Africa and a safe haven for refugees while at the same time exporting its repression globally,” the report says.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Home Office and the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office received a summary of the report&#39;s findings before publication and were asked for comment. Tariq Ahmad, the minister for the Middle East and Africa, said Britain&#39;s “positive relationship with Rwanda ensures that we uphold our commitment to addressing critical global challenges. We have worked closely together on the partnership to protect vulnerable people seeking safety and opportunity; human rights are a key consideration.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;HRW also wrote to the Rwandan ministry of justice with its findings and received no reply. Rwandan authorities have previously accused government critics and rights groups of making baseless claims against the country.&lt;/p>; &lt;figure data-media-id=&quot;3fc2ca16a7728839cfdc6e44bfc8703743c4bb4f&quot;>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://media.guim.co.uk/3fc2ca16a7728839cfdc6e44bfc8703743c4bb4f/0_139_3888_2333/1000.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Protesters&#39; placards outside the Royal Courts of Justice&quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; height=&quot;600&quot;>; &lt;figcaption>; &lt;span>;A protest outside the Royal Courts of Justice in London in September 2022 over the government&#39;s plan to send some asylum seekers to Rwanda.&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;Photograph: Tom Pilgrim/PA&lt;/span>; &lt;/figcaption>; &lt;/figure>; &lt;p>;The readiness of Rwanda&#39;s ruling party to reach beyond its borders to eliminate perceived enemies of the state first made headlines in 1998 when the former interior minister Seth Sendashonga was shot dead in Nairobi.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2020, the government organised the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/sep/01/hotel-rwanda-activist-paul-rusesabagina-kidnapped-from-dubai&quot;>;high-profile kidnapping of Paul Rusesabagina&lt;/a>;, a former hotelier turned human rights activist who had moved to the US. The following year Freedom House, a US-based human rights group, listed Rwanda as one of the most prolific perpetrators of what it called “transnational repression”.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Rwanda&#39;s willingness to dispatch peacekeepers around the continent and to take in Europe&#39;s unwanted asylum seekers has muted criticism from western governments who are worried about the spread of jihadism in Africa.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The report&#39;s publication puts the British government in an awkward position. In 2021, British officials &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/37th-universal-periodic-review-uk-statement-on-rwanda#:~:text=The%20United%20Kingdom%20welcomes%20Rwanda%E2%80%99s,political%20rights%20and%20media%20freedom&quot;>;were outspoken in their criticism&lt;/a>; of Rwanda&#39;s human rights failings, pressing the state to conduct independent investigations into “allegations of extrajudicial killings, deaths in custody, enforced disappearances and torture” during the UN&#39;s universal periodic review.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But once Patel signed the asylum deal, British officials largely went silent on Rwanda&#39;s human rights record and its well-documented support for &lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/article/africa-genocides-rwanda-rwandan-genocide-united-nations-cf17860465724c5cced21150da16390e&quot;>;the M23 rebel movement&lt;/a>; that was destabilising the neighbouring Democratic Republic of the Congo.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Rwanda has received an upfront payment of £140m to cover the costs of integrating asylum seekers.

But Timmermans was particularly scathing about Sunak&#39;s policies, warning that the “radicals seem[ed] to be taking over” the British Conservative party.&lt;/p>; &lt;figure data-media-id=&quot;bf92f4aae97aa7ddd2e6496c3cdc00a3750834d2&quot;>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://media.guim.co.uk/bf92f4aae97aa7ddd2e6496c3cdc00a3750834d2/703_463_2146_1288/1000.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Rishi Sunak and Suella Braverman seated next to each other at Prime ministers questions.&quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; height=&quot;600&quot;>; &lt;figcaption>; &lt;span>;Timmermans says &#39;the radicals seem to be taking over&#39; the British Conservative party.&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;Photograph: Jessica Taylor/AP&lt;/span>; &lt;/figcaption>; &lt;/figure>; &lt;p>;He suggested it was a false economy for Sunak to push back a ban on new petrol and diesel vehicles. “I hope we can convincingly show &lt;em>; &lt;/em>;our citizens the longer you delay measures pertaining to the climate crisis, the more expensive they become, and the harder it becomes to change,” he said.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When Timmermans – a &lt;a href=&quot;https://nos.nl/artikel/2286046-pvda-winst-komt-door-het-frans-timmermans-effect&quot;>;popular Dutch Labour politician&lt;/a>; and former foreign minister with a formidable command of languages and new, white beard – was announced as head of the new coalition, it topped polls. It is now polling narrowly behind Mark Rutte&#39;s centre-right party, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/sep/23/dilan-yesilgoz-zegerius-former-refugee-wants-cut-immigration-first-female-dutch-pm&quot;>;the VVD&lt;/a>;, and New Social Contract, founded by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/sep/21/how-anti-establishment-parties-could-shape-europe-this-autumn&quot;>;the backbench “centrist-outsider” Pieter Omtzigt&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But trust in politics is at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scp.nl/actueel/nieuws/2023/04/20/scp-6-op-de-10-nederlanders-ontevreden-over-politiek&quot;>;desperate lows&lt;/a>;. In 2021 a&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2021/01/15/dutch-government-resign-childcare-subsidies/&quot;>; previous Rutte&lt;/a>; government was felled – partly thanks to Omtzigt&#39;s backbench scrutiny – after thousands of parents, often dual nationals, were falsely accused of childcare benefits fraud. The country is paying a &lt;a href=&quot;https://nos.nl/collectie/13902/artikel/2472804-groningen-krijgt-13-5-miljard-euro-extra-voor-schade-versterking-en-ereschuld&quot;>;€22bn &lt;/a>; debt of honour to the region of Groningen, where decades of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rtlnieuws.nl/nieuws/nederland/artikel/5410654/gaskraan-groningen-slochteren-aardbevingen-waakvlam&quot;>;extracting gas worth billions damaged&lt;/a>; about 85,000 buildings.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Timmermans, who has just spent five weeks touring the country, pledges to simplify bureaucracy and rely more on trusting people. “As somebody from a coal mining region, I still find [Groningen] astonishing because in the coal mining region, we had the same issues with houses being affected but there was an immediate response,” he said.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He said a recent scandal in which the tax authority was found to be marking people as more likely to be committing fraud based on their ethnic origin – a practice the finance minister &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dutchnews.nl/2022/05/van-rij-admits-institutional-racism-is-a-problem-at-dutch-tax-office/&quot;>;admitted &lt;/a>;was “institutionally racist” – was another reason for the trust gap in Dutch politics.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Timmermans said he found the revelations “terribly, terribly painful” and acknowledged that restoring trust among voters would “take quite some time”.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Despite the fact that the current four-party government, led by Rutte, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/08/mark-rutte-resigns-dutch-coalition-government-over-asylum-row&quot;>;fell in July&lt;/a>; over “unbridgeable” differences on asylum, Timmermans denied that immigration would be a divisive subject in the run-up to the 22 November poll.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Uncontrolled migration is one of the factors of insecurity in our society, so addressing it is a responsibility of the left as much as it is of the right,” he said. “We need a responsible migration policy, starting with the international agreements we have.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Taking aim at the UK again, where the home secretary, Suella Braverman, last week &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/oct/03/suella-braverman-claims-hurricane-of-mass-migration-coming-to-uk&quot;>;gave a populist speech warning of a “hurricane” of mass migration&lt;/a>;, he added: “We are not [Suella] Braverman. These are the bedrock of our values. This is what western democracy is all about.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Timmermans&#39;s manifesto proposes increasing the minimum wage, better support for those on lower incomes with pollution taxes, higher profit taxes for business, a new top rate income tax, “millionaire” wealth levy and crackdown on tax evasion, but also changes that will hit average households such as phasing out mortgage interest relief. He is aware, he says, that he can be divisive: “For some people climate policies are red flags: they get really excited in the negative sense thinking about climate policy, and the rightwing media have portrayed me as the &#39;climate pope&#39; for a long time.”&lt;/p>; &lt;figure data-media-id=&quot;4f0c249c0c35406db24b7a11cf8ec3a4d80f2726&quot;>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://media.guim.co.uk/4f0c249c0c35406db24b7a11cf8ec3a4d80f2726/0_400_6000_3600/1000.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Protesters sitting and lying in the road&quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; height=&quot;600&quot;>; &lt;figcaption>; &lt;span>;Climate protesters in The Hague last month.&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty Images&lt;/span>; &lt;/figcaption>; &lt;/figure>; &lt;p>;But he is selling a “better society”, he said. “There is a strong perceived sentiment of injustice in our society, and we have to address the issue of redistribution,” he said. “That will bring back a bit more self-confidence. We went from &#39;there&#39;s nothing we can&#39;t solve because we&#39;re the Dutch&#39;, to &#39;there&#39;s nothing we can solve because we&#39;re the Dutch&#39;.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This Monty Python fan, dressed in smart jacket and shirt above the table and jeans and trainers below, wrote &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/26/post-brexit-uk-always-welcome-back-in-eu-says-timmermans&quot;>;a heartbroken love letter to Britain&lt;/a>; about Brexit and believes there are still strong parallels between the UK and the Netherlands.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“To put it in my kids&#39; language, we&#39;ve lost our swag,” he said. “Remember Cool Britannia? Nobody talks about Cool Britannia today. If you are proud of your country, you&#39;re also more resilient. If you lose confidence in your ability to be resilient, then everything becomes a problem.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The power of the united left, building a greener future across a splintering political landscape, is his answer. “One of the reasons I returned to Dutch politics,” he said, “is because we now have an opportunity to have a movement in the other direction.”&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 10 Oct 2023 12:52:02 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
