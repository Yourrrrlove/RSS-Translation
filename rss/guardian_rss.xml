alt=&quot;&quot;>;马来西亚海岸失事巴勃罗油轮的卫星图像。&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;下午早些时候5 月 1 日，Oleksandr Lepyoshkin 进入他的小屋，发现里面充满了烟雾。几秒钟后，船体因多次爆炸而摇晃，窗户玻璃爆炸，大火开始淹没船体。他通知了轮机长，轮机长启动了船上的消防泵。当列皮约什金等待是否需要弃船的消息时，他清点了船员的人数。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这艘名为“巴勃罗”的油轮发生爆炸，立即引起了锚泊其他船只的注意。在马六甲海峡繁忙的入口处。停泊在地平线上的几艘油轮和货船开始发出船舶起火的报告，受灾船只周围的天空中弥漫着黑烟。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;长超过 230 米，火势仍在熊熊燃烧。帕布罗号很难被搜索，当火势明显无法控制时，救生筏从顶层甲板上被扔了出来。由于担心发生第二次爆炸，没有时间放下梯子，所以船员们从甲板顶部跳入水中。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“在这种情况下，就像战争一样。 “爆炸、烟雾……你会感觉到烟雾并失去理智，”巴勃罗号的船长 Lepyoshkin 后来告诉马来西亚当局。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当马来西亚海事部门开始救援任务时，拔掉了这艘船的船体。船员们从水中出来后，事故的规模很快就变得清晰起来。油轮空舱内气体积聚引发了爆炸，爆炸强度足以撕裂该船的几乎整个顶层甲板，并在此过程中摧毁了其通信系统。爬上几层楼到达船桥的楼梯已被吹走，无力地挂在海里。 co.uk/fe2fe00df2b3dff135c2fc9a0c84fea6135a8e9e/0_0_1417_798/1000.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;然而尽管灾难规模巨大，但海事专家几乎普遍认为，对于航运业这个日益靠借来的时间生存的行业来说，这次事件是一次幸运的逃脱，而且面临着发生更加致命和环境破坏性事故的风险。&lt; /p>; &lt;figure data-interactive=&quot;https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js&quot;

&lt;p>;专家警告说，此类船舶对环境以及与其接触的人的生命构成严重威胁。但像“巴勃罗”号这样的船舶影子贸易的规模和规模却在不断扩大——它们的旅程穿越了世界地缘政治热点地区；从伊朗的油田到中国的工厂，一直到俄罗斯对乌克兰战争的前线。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;***&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;五年前，巴勃罗号被定为作为废品出售。 21岁，远远超过了大多数油轮因磨损而退役的年龄。当时被称为“奥林匹克精神二号”的该船的拆除工作因对较旧且更便宜的油轮的需求突然激增而被取消。&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;在他们的 &lt;a href=&quot;https://commercial.allianz.com/ content/dam/onemarketing/commercial/commercial/reports/AGCS-Safety-Shipping-Review-2023.pdf&quot;>;2023 年安全和航运审查&lt;/a>;，保险公司安联指出，针对俄罗斯的制裁清单不断增加，意味着数量影子油轮的数量现在可能“超过 600 艘，约占全球原油油轮船队总数的五分之一”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“船舶更有可能是较旧的船舶……较低的维护标准。报告显示，2022 年至少发生了 8 起涉及运载受制裁石油产品的油轮搁浅、碰撞或险些发生事故的事件。” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“影子油轮数量的增加令人担忧，威胁着世界船队和环境。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;根据 &lt;a 办公室主任克莱尔·荣格曼 (Claire Jungman) 的说法href=&quot;https://www.unitedagainstnucleariran.com/&quot;>;美国监督组织伊朗反核联合组织（UANI）&lt;/a>;，巴勃罗号就是其中一艘构成威胁的船只。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“它是我们的惯犯之一。我们有一份定期运送伊朗石油的 50 艘油轮名单，Pablo 就是其中之一。&lt;/p>; &lt;figure data-media-id=&quot;8695624affe7feb290c35014f80048f171eff5d1&quot;>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://media. guim.co.uk/8695624affe7feb290c35014f80048f171eff5d1/101_0_1267_761/1000.jpg&quot;

&lt;/figure>; &lt;p>;Jungman 经常在世界各地追踪多达 300 艘违反制裁的油轮。一旦她的团队识别出一艘船只，他们通常会通知载旗承运商（油轮所在的国家），希望他们撤回国旗。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2021 年 6 月，Pablo 被称为 Adisa ，并在喀麦隆国旗下航行。在 UANI 向该国通报该船的活动后，该旗帜被撤回。仅仅几个月后，它就以新名称“赫利俄斯”和新旗帜“库克群岛”航行。但在 UANI 提供了受制裁贸易的证据后，这面旗帜也被撤回了。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;到 2022 年，它被称为 Mockingbird，并在坦桑尼亚注册，在 UANI 联系后，坦桑尼亚也撤回了旗帜。&lt;/p>; &lt; 4 月 4 日，UANI 联系了加蓬当局，后者现已将该船登记在 Pablo 名下。在承诺继续监控该船的同时，该国海事部门还表示，已进行尽职调查，并已收到船东的谅解书，表示将遵守美国、联合国和欧盟的所有制裁。&lt;/然而，巴勃罗号悬挂加蓬国旗的事实令哥本哈根大学海事安全专家扬·斯托克布鲁格（Jan Stockbruegger）感到震惊。 “如果你想等加蓬做某事，你会等很长时间。据了解，他们并不是对其所悬挂的船只负责的船旗国。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“许多船只在[小国家]注册是有原因的，”Stockbruegger 说。 “许多小型注册机构没有能力确保您遵守任何标准。你无需缴纳税款，只需支付注册费，而且旗帜不会显示船只在做什么”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Jungman 表示，装饰 Pablo 的旋转名单和旗帜并不罕见。她表示，自 2018 年以来，正是这种跳旗过程帮助该船转运了约 1,590 万桶（相当于 1,000 多个奥林匹克游泳池大小的伊朗石油）。&lt;/p>; &lt;figure data-alt=&quot;预计石油出口量图表来自伊朗&quot;>; &lt;iframe title=&quot;2023 年 8 月伊朗石油出口量预计达到五年来新高&amp;nbsp;&quot; aria-label =“交互式折线图”id =“datawrapper-chart-RK2wH”src =“https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/RK2wH/2/”滚动=“否”frameborder =“0”样式=“边框” ： 没有任何;” width=&quot;640&quot;

&lt;p>;荣格曼说，卫星图像显示，这种转移每天都会发生多次。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;斯托克布鲁格说，这个过程本身就非常危险。 “对于如何进行这些转账有具体的规定。在恶劣天气和旧设备下，风险会增加。如果你的油轮已经使用了 20 年，那么风险只会再次增加。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Stockbruegger 说，船员通常来自不富裕的国家，并且可能不知道这艘船正在运输受制裁的石油。 《卫报》没有发现任何迹象表明巴勃罗号的船员意识到该船的活动违反了制裁，也没有迹象表明船长或船员有任何不当行为。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但斯托克布鲁格强调，船对船的危险转移不仅是环保的，而且是经济的。&lt;/p>; &lt;figure data-media-id=&quot;201837e904168077962d1e4cbf8e65327e1c536c&quot;>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://media.guim.co.uk/201837e904168077962d1e4cbf8e65327e1c536c /0_0_761_548/500。 jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;“如果[马六甲海峡]发生石油泄漏......它将扰乱航运交通，这对全球经济非常不利。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;由于风险如此之大，荣格曼和斯托克布鲁格都质疑为什么政府不采取更多措施来杜绝这种做法。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;马来西亚海事局告诉《卫报》，当局“不断加强在沿海水域的执法力度”马来西亚的政策包括遏制非法活动，如非法转移石油、未经许可抛锚等。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;然而，斯托克布鲁格表示，即使对于破坏制裁的人来说，海洋法也保障航行自由。 “马六甲海峡的交通量巨大，很难确定谁是制裁破坏者，”他补充道。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;至于美国，荣格曼表示，预计美国可能会更严格地执行自己的制裁&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/sep/11/us-iran-sanctions-waiver-americans-detained-iran&quot;>;这不是本届政府的优先事项&lt;/a>; 。 “他们正在寻求与伊朗谈判一项新协议。他们试图不破坏潜在的谈判进程。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;***&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;截至目前，巴勃罗号仍被遗弃。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“我们的卫星图像Jungman 说：“这表明它基本上只是马来西亚海岸附近的一艘被烧毁的船。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;马来西亚海事部门已证实该船的所有者和经理已回应其处理该船的请求，但他们的通信细节将被保密。当地一家救助公司已被指定，该部门正在监视巴勃罗“以确保船舶及其航行的安全”。&lt;/p>;

Boebert reportedly asked “Do you know who I am?” when they were asked to leave.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Her first apology since then blamed her “public and difficult divorce” for her behavior. In May, she filed to divorce her husband of nearly two decades, Jayson.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Though Sunday marked Boebert&#39;s second apology for her Beetlejuice antics, the comments marked the third time the congresswoman had addressed the episode.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Initially, her campaign manager Drew Sexton told the Associated Press that “congresswoman Lauren Boebert is indeed a supporter of the performing arts (gasp!)”.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He added that Boebert “pleads guilty to singing along, laughing and enjoying herself”.&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 18 Sep 2023 04:52:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Russell Brand: broadcasters launch investigations into abuse allegations]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/sep/17/russell-brand-broadcasters-launch-investigations-abuse-allegations]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-17T19:43:36Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/57e81adb46b90a39865aa06e304b8fb9a09f1a55/0_226_3328_1996/master/3328.jpg?w=600&amp;fit=bounds&amp;sig-ignores-params=true&amp;s=d52a1c3c04b21a93b69dcea9dfa4b41b&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;Russell Brand&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Broadcasters have launched urgent investigations into the historical conduct of Russell Brand while the Metropolitan police has appealed for any potential victims to come forward after the comedian was accused of rape, sexual assault and emotional abuse.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The BBC said it was “urgently looking into the issues raised” by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/sep/17/amnesty-international-urges-women-to-come-forward-with-russell-brand-concerns&quot;>;the publication of allegations over the weekend that Brand harmed four women&lt;/a>;, including claims that he raped a woman in Los Angeles and sexually assaulted a British schoolgirl aged 16. Channel 4 has also pulled all of Brand&#39;s content from its streaming service while it investigates.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/russell-brand-rape-sexual-assault-abuse-allegations-investigation-v5hxdlmb6&quot;>;The claims were published in the Sunday Times&lt;/a>; after a years-long investigation into the comedian, alongside Channel 4&#39;s Dispatches. They relate to the period between 2006 and 2013, when the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/nov/12/biography.mikeleigh&quot;>;self-confessed sex addict&lt;/a>; was at the height of his fame, working for BBC Radio 2 and Channel 4 and starring in Hollywood films.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Brand denied the claims in a video posted online before they were published, saying he was facing a “litany of extremely egregious and aggressive attacks”.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The foreign secretary, James Cleverly, said on Sunday that the investigation prompted wider questions for the entertainment industry and that early intervention was needed when allegations involved a power imbalance.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;While he did not comment specifically on Brand, he told BBC One&#39;s Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg: “I think there are some real challenges where you have these very, very acute differentials in power, whether that be in the entertainment industry, whether that be in politics, and we see this in the commercial world as well.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“I think we have to be particularly careful when we listen to the voices of the people who are relatively powerless because we, I think, collectively have missed opportunities to do the right thing and intervene much, much earlier, and we&#39;ve got to be better at this.”&lt;/p>; &lt;aside>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Related: &lt;/span>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/sep/17/a-timeline-of-sexual-assault-allegations-against-russell-brand&quot;>;A timeline of sexual assault allegations against Russell Brand&lt;/a>;&lt;/p>; &lt;/aside>; &lt;p>;The comedian Katherine Ryan has previously spoken out on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/m001fhfl/louis-theroux-interviews-series-1-5-katherine-ryan&quot;>;an episode of Louis Theroux&#39;s BBC Interviews series&lt;/a>; about how she confronted a comedian whose “predatory behaviour” was an open secret in the industry. Ryan has never identified the comedian in question.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Metropolitan police said it had “not received any reports” in relation to a series of allegations of sexual assault by Brand but had spoken to the Sunday Times on Saturday and would be making further approaches to “ensure that any victims of crime who they have spoken with are aware of how they may report any criminal allegations to police”.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The force added: “If anyone believes they have been the victim of a sexual assault, no matter how long ago it happened, we would encourage them to contact police.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Brand, 48, who has lately recast himself as a health guru, is in the middle of a national standup comedy tour. He is due to appear in Windsor, Wolverhampton and Plymouth in the coming days, but there have been calls online for the venues to cancel the shows.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Channel 4 and the BBC are both conducting internal investigations about allegations relating to behaviour while he was working for the broadcasters.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A BBC spokesperson said in a statement that the reports “contained serious allegations, spanning a number of years … Russell Brand worked on BBC radio programmes between 2006 and 2008 and we are urgently looking into the issues raised.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Brand was also accused of pursuing audience members for sex while presenting Big Brother spin-off shows EFourum and Big Brother&#39;s Big Mouth on Channel 4. A researcher claimed that concerns about Brand&#39;s behaviour while he worked on the shows in 2004 and 2005 were reported to production managers at Endemol, the company that produced the programmes.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Channel 4 said it was “appalled” to learn of the “deeply troubling allegations” and was conducting its own internal investigations.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Banijay UK, which bought Endemol in 2020, said that it had “launched an urgent internal investigation and will cooperate with any requests for information from broadcast partners and external agencies … We also encourage anybody who feels that they were affected by Brand&#39;s behaviour while working on these productions to contact us in confidence.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The comedian London Hughes claimed “there&#39;s not a single comedian in the UK” who wasn&#39;t aware of Brand&#39;s behaviour. Hughes said she personally wasn&#39;t aware that the allegations included rape, but “I always had the understanding that he was, for lack of a better word, &#39;dodgy&#39; and I should avoid him.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another comedian, Jo Caulfield, wrote: “In whatever industry you work in, keep speaking out. Predatory behaviour and abuse is wrong.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Appearing on the Channel 4 Dispatches programme that revealed the allegations against Brand, the comedian Daniel Sloss said: “I know for many many years women have been warning each other about Russell.” He claimed there were “many stories with varying degrees of severity” but his fame and status meant he wasn&#39;t held to account.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Labour MP Jess Phillips said that she found watching the Dispatches documentary “harrowing” and hit out at those on social media who were questioning the accounts of women who made accusations against Brand.&lt;/p>; &lt;aside>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Related: &lt;/span>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/sep/17/russell-brand-reaction-metoo-mainstream-media&quot;>;Now we&#39;ll see how many bought Brand&#39;s anti-&#39;mainstream media&#39; shtick &lt;/a>;&lt;/p>; &lt;/aside>; &lt;p>;“Even somebody as hardened as me – I deal with rape cases, abuse cases – I found watching the Dispatches … really harrowing,” she said in an interview with Channel 4 News.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Now these women, rather than Russell Brand himself and the production companies where he was working throughout that period, are going to feel like they have questions that they have to answer. They&#39;re going to feel like they have to prove themselves.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She also said that she was unsurprised by the fact that people turned up to see Brand perform at the Troubadour theatre in Wembley, north-west London, as part of his stand-up comedy tour on Saturday night. “It doesn&#39;t surprise me that men fail up, specifically in that industry. It just makes it look like society accepts that women have to tolerate a certain amount of abuse.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Amnesty International has urged women to come forward if they have any concerns about Brand&#39;s behaviour during his participation in two of the charity&#39;s standup comedy events. In a statement, the charity said it found the allegations “shocking and distressing” and that it did not have a relationship with the comedian. Brand took part in the charity&#39;s Secret Policeman&#39;s Ball events in 2006 and 2012.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The charity said that while “no complaints or concerns” were raised at the time of the events, it was “very aware of the barriers women face in raising complaints of sexual assault, and would encourage any women to let us know if there is anything that they experienced at that time that is of concern”.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It followed the announcement by a charity that supports vulnerable women recovering from addiction that it would sever its links with Brand. The Trevi women and children&#39;s charity said it was “deeply saddened and upset” by the news and had ended its association with Brand and his charitable fund, the Stay Free Foundation.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Brand has received words of support from Twitter founder, Elon Musk, as well as Andrew Tate, who is awaiting a trial for rape and human trafficking.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Brand has been contacted for comment. In a video statement released on Friday, he claimed the reporting was a coordinated attack by the mainstream media and that the sex was consensual, saying: “Amidst this litany of astonishing, rather baroque attacks are some very serious allegations that I absolutely refute.”&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 18 Sep 2023 03:52:01 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Sick children’s health worsening as record numbers wait for NHS care in England]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/sep/17/sick-children-health-worsening-record-numbers-wait-for-nhs-care-in-england]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-17T17:52:15Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4b1258c51ccc867e817a8a8ad43e602fff0f3005/0_201_5500_3300/master/5500.jpg?w=600&amp;fit=bounds&amp;sig-ignores-params=true&amp;s=c3d5d5f718f9b91337e868ab75929524&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;Doctor using stethoscope on girl&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Sick children&#39;s health problems are getting worse as record numbers wait up to 18 months for NHS care, doctors treating them have warned.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The number of under-18s on the waiting list for paediatric care in England has soared to 423,500, the highest on record. Of those, 23,396 have been forced to wait over a year for their appointment.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Delays facing children and young people are now so common that Dr Jeanette Dickson, the chair of the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges, the body representing all UK doctors professionally, warned that children are “the forgotten casualties of the NHS&#39;s waiting list crisis”.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fewer than three-fifths (57%) of children are now seen within 18 weeks, even though NHS treatment targets say that 92% should be. The number on the waiting list has jumped by 52% since 2021.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“As a paediatrician, I&#39;ve seen first hand the damaging impact that long waiting times have on children, on their education and overall wellbeing, and of course on their families,” said &lt;a href=&quot;x-gu://list/mobile.guardianapis.com/international/lists/tag/profile/camilla-kingdon&quot;>;Dr Camilla Kingdon&lt;/a>;, the president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health (RCPCH).&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The figures came from the RCPCH&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.england.nhs.uk/statistics/statistical-work-areas/rtt-waiting-times/rtt-data-2023-24/&quot;>;analysis&lt;/a>; of official performance data recently published by NHS England.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The health of some children was deteriorating while they languished on the waiting list because their illness and age meant they needed to have their treatment fast, Kingdon added. “Many treatments and interventions must be administered within specific age or developmental stages. No one wants to wait for treatment, but children&#39;s care is frequently time-critical.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She cited the example of children with serious hearing problems being harmed as a result of being forced to wait to have surgery to receive cochlear implants. “It&#39;s critical for language development to get them in around a year of age,” she said.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Waiting lists for radiology – because you usually need a general anaesthetic for good-quality pictures – mean that the pre-op work up is often delayed for months, plus surgery can be delayed by 10 to 12 months. So instead of doing it at 10 months of age, it&#39;s done at 18-20 months. That&#39;s a massive difference developmentally in terms of speech and language development.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Under-18s were also facing long delays for community-based services, not just hospital care, added Kingdon, a consultant paediatrician in London. “I had a baby with an evolving cerebral palsy who desperately needed a special occupational therapy chair. This was a bright little boy of eight months who had every potential of making very good progress.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Because he [was in] a neighbouring borough with very long therapy waiting lists, there was a six-month delay for getting the chair. Six months&#39; delay when you&#39;re eight months old and wanting to sit but needing the extra support is an absolute disaster.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “Cutting waiting lists is one of the government&#39;s top five priorities and despite disruption from strikes, we have virtually eliminated 18-month waits and are taking immediate action to bring down long waits.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“We are improving support for children, young people, and their families by providing around £300m to fund a three-year Family Hubs and Start for Life programme, in 75 local authorities in England, and they are already making a difference by bringing together services and support for families with babies and children of all ages.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Dickson and Kingdon voiced their fears as the academy published a new report into children&#39;s health that criticised the government for ignoring young people&#39;s needs when devising key health policies.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“All medical Royal College leaders are genuinely horrified at the current lack of emphasis on the health of children and young people. It&#39;s as if they don&#39;t exist,” said Dickson.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The report highlights the government&#39;s controversial decision to publish a strategy covering a large number of major conditions, instead of having specific plans for each one. Although the strategy will replace several key child health plans, it mainly focuses on adult health.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The academy also criticises ministers for abandoning plans to tackle obesity, despite the growing number of school-age children who are dangerously overweight, and also for delaying publication of a vaccination strategy, even though take-up has declined across 13 of the 14 routine childhood vaccinations.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The report urges Rishi Sunak to create a cabinet-level minister for children and young people, offer free school meals to all primary school pupils, ramp up vaccination efforts, and expand mental health services for under-18s as part of a renewed drive to improve child health and prevent illness.&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 18 Sep 2023 02:22:01 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Tim Peake backs idea for solar farms in space as costs fall]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/sep/17/tim-peake-backs-idea-for-solar-farms-in-space-as-costs-fall]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-17T17:37:53Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/094696e483066197bf4ae9a7ce628f0f106cdad1/0_23_4940_2964/master/4940.jpg?w=600&amp;fit=bounds&amp;sig-ignores-params=true&amp;s=65cb293634b926cbc2a7b8ad9377478b&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;Tim Peake in astronaut gear&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Tim Peake has backed the idea of solar farms in space, saying the concept is “becoming absolutely viable”.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Astronaut Maj Peake said the falling cost of launching heavy cargoes into orbit means that complex structures, such as solar power farms, could soon be launched into space, and had the potential to provide significant power.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Peake – the first European Space Agency (ESA) astronaut from Britain to visit the International Space Station – said: “It boils down to hard numbers at the end of the day. Launching thousands of tonnes of hardware into low Earth orbit is becoming absolutely viable.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The ESA has been exploring the idea of space-based solar power plants, and commissioned two “concept studies” this year. It is hoping to present a business case to the EU by 2025.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Peake said the agency had calculated that solar farms in space would be financially viable when cargoes could be launched at a cost of $1,000 (£807) per kg or less.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“So far, the actual costs have been about $2,700 per kilo,” he told an energy tech summit last week, but he said two rockets designed by SpaceX, the aerospace company founded by Elon Musk, could cut this. “Launches using the Falcon Heavy can reduce that to about $1,500 and the so-called Starship brings that down by an order of magnitude to about $300 per kilo.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Falcon Heavy is already transporting cargo such as satellites into space, while the Starship is in development. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/apr/20/elon-musks-spacex-launches-test-flight-for-rocket-that-could-bring-people-to-mars&quot;>;An unmanned test flight in April exploded minutes after lift-off.&lt;/a>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Unlike previous launchers, they are programmed to return to Earth intact and are reusable. This means there is no need to construct a completely new rocket for each launch, bringing the overall cost down.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;ESA&#39;s Solaris programme aims to launch solar panels into space, each programmed to robotically link up with others to build a solar farm.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;While Earth-based solar farms are unable to generate electricity during times of darkness, such as at night or when the weather is bad, space-based panels are able to harvest the sun&#39;s energy continuously.&lt;/p>; &lt;aside>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Related: &lt;/span>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/oct/09/beam-me-down-can-solar-power-from-space-help-solve-our-energy-needs&quot;>;Beam me down: can solar power from space help solve our energy needs? &lt;/a>;&lt;/p>; &lt;/aside>; &lt;p>;Peake said: “If you can build solar farms in space, then you can beam that energy down to ground stations via microwaves. It means clean, limitless energy from space becomes an absolute possibility.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This year, it was announced that UK universities and tech companies were to receive £4.3m in government funding to develop &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/oct/09/beam-me-down-can-solar-power-from-space-help-solve-our-energy-needs&quot;>;space-based solar power&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It followed a 2020 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-government-commissions-space-solar-power-stations-research&quot;>;UK government-commissioned report into space-based solar farms&lt;/a>; which said the systems had the potential to provide energy equivalent to a large power station, up to a quarter of the country&#39;s electricity needs, and, in time, to become an unlimited and constant zero-carbon power source.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Such developments, though, would take many years and are unlikely to help solve any of the world&#39;s urgent energy challenges.&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 18 Sep 2023 01:52:01 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
