&lt;p>;提议的三年期合同得到了 86% 的美国演员工会 (SAG) 的支持，工会称该合同三年内价值超过 10 亿美元。 AFTRA 的国家委员会。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;该合同包括设立一项新基金，除了为电影或电视剧的放映支付的传统剩余费用之外，还向表演者支付未来在流媒体服务上观看其作品的费用。&lt;/p>; &lt;aside>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;相关：&lt;/span>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/oct/01/hollywood-writers-strike-artificial-intelligence&quot;>;如何好莱坞编剧战胜了人工智能 - 以及它为何重要&lt;/a>;&lt;/p>; &lt;/aside>; &lt;p>;工会领导人宣称背景演员的工资立即增加 11%，其他演员的工资立即增加 7%。&lt;/他们还强调了人工智能方面的艰苦胜利。首席谈判代表邓肯·克拉布特里-爱尔兰 (Duncan Crabtree-Ireland) 表示：“我们行业中人工智能的使用将首次建立知情同意和公平补偿的护栏。” 对于黑人演员和其他人来说，有色人种演员，他们长期以来一直强调好莱坞的&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2021/may/20/black-actors-hair-mistreatment-hollywood&quot;>;种族主义做法&lt;/a>;克拉布特里-爱尔兰表示，合同包括“新条款，以确保所有表演者，包括那些拥有多样化、有质感的头发和肤色的表演者，都拥有合适的发型和化妆”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;许多黑人演员们此前曾描述被告知制作“&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2021/may/20/black-actors-hair-mistreatment-hollywood&quot;>;没有预算&lt; /a>;”来设计他们的发型，或者遇到似乎没有处理他们的发型或肤色的经验的造型师。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;合同还将规定“在场景中配备亲密协调员的要求”涉及裸体或模拟性行为”，克拉布特里-爱尔兰说道。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;工会成员现在必须投票决定是否批准与 Netflix、华特迪士尼、华纳兄弟探索公司和电影电视联盟其他成员的协议制片人 (AMPTP)。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;克拉布特里-爱尔兰表示，投票预计将于 12 月初结束。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;SAG-AFTRA 主席 Fran Drescher 表示，工会仅&lt;strong>; &lt;/strong >;部分实现了让流媒体服务与演员分享更多收入的目标。虽然公司拒绝了包括按订阅者付费在内的早期提议，但他们同意支付新的奖金。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“我们开辟了新的收入来源，”德雷舍尔在新闻发布会上表示。 “我们又赚到了钱。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;根据交易条款，4000 万美元资金中的 75% 将捐给最受欢迎的流媒体节目的演员。剩下的 25% 将进入一个基金，该基金将分配给其他流媒体节目的演员。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;AMPTP 表示很高兴 SAG-AFTRA 董事会批准了该交易。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; >;“我们也感谢整个行业热情地恢复工作，”该组织在一份声明中表示。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;董事会的成功投票，其成员包括演员比利·波特、詹妮弗·比尔斯、西恩·奥斯汀莎朗·斯通 (Sharon Stone) 的加入是意料之中的，因为谈判该交易的委员会中有许多人都是同样的人。在周三与 AMPTP 达成临时协议后，工会领导人就宣布罢工结束，而不是等待批准，这在某种程度上消除了戏剧性。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;人工智能是问题之一克拉布特里-爱尔兰表示，这一问题在谈判的最后几个小时内得到了解决。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;工作室在使用演员的图像创建数字复制品之前必须获得演员的同意，并提供具体的描述，他说。演员将获得与数字复制品在屏幕上执行的工作类型相当的报酬。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;该合同还保护背景表演者不得在未经同意的情况下使用其数字复制品，克拉布特里-爱尔兰表示。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; >; &lt;p>;克拉布特里-爱尔兰表示，使用生成式人工智能来创造“合成的假表演者”引发了一场“非常严重的斗争”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;根据合同，公司必须获得表演者的同意，这些表演者的面部特征用于创建合成表演者，即使它是多个表演者。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;工作室必须在任何时候计划使用生成式人工智能创建合成表演者时向工会发出通知，工会赢得了代表演员（其特征被用于创作该数字表演者）谈判赔偿的权利。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;该协议于周三达成，结束了美国娱乐业两次重叠罢工中的第二次罢工，这场罢工造成了加州经济超过 60 亿美元。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;第一届由美国作家协会 (WGA) 主办，于 5 月开始，持续了 148 天。 SAG-AFTRA 于 7 月份罢工，并于本周结束了为期 118 天的罢工。&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 11 Nov 2023 11:22:01 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[UN warns violence against civilians in Sudan ‘verging on pure evil’]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/10/un-warns-violence-against-civilians-in-sudan-verging-on-pure-evil]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-10T21:44:16Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/292bfcc10669b15930a5c06eadd857e5768838e6/966_1027_5754_3452 /master/5754.jpg?w=600&amp;fit=bounds&amp;sig-ignores-params=true&amp;s=57f529c4c8fa24a94cc192cd0bb26cfa&quot;

&lt;p>;Outside government, Tomero was director of nuclear non-proliferation at the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation, an organization that has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.armscontrol.org/subject-resources/us-russia-nuclear-arms-control&quot;>;repeatedly&lt;/a>; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.armscontrol.org/act/2023-07/focus/plan-reduce-nuclear-dangers-time-peril&quot;>;called&lt;/a>; for reductions in the US nuclear weapons arsenal. Tomero is also on the board of the Council for a Livable World, which explicitly &lt;a href=&quot;https://livableworld.org/&quot;>;states&lt;/a>; that its goal is to eliminate nuclear weapons.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yet, in September, Tomero became a vice-president of government relations at JA Green &amp;amp; Company, a lobbying firm whose client &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jagreenandco.com/clients.html&quot;>;list&lt;/a>; includes a host of military contractors that could see revenues soar if the CCSPUS&#39;s recommendations are adopted. SpaceX, for example – which pays $50,000 every three months to JA Green for &lt;a href=&quot;https://lda.senate.gov/filings/public/filing/f0f9806b-fefd-435a-80a2-4fd49fb48da1/print/&quot;>;lobbying&lt;/a>; related to “issues related to national security space launch” – would probably benefit mightily from the commission recommendation that “the United States urgently deploy a more resilient space architecture and adopt a strategy that includes both offensive and defensive elements to ensure US access to and operations in space”.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“No clients of JA Green &amp;amp; Company sought to influence the work of the Commission or the Commission&#39;s recommendations in any way,” said Jeffrey A Green, president of JA Green, in an email. “We follow all applicable ethics rules and there are no conflicts of interest.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;None of the potential conflicts of interest between commissioners&#39; financial interests and the policy proposals laid out in their final report were disclosed by the CCSPUS itself within its final report or at any public event highlighting its findings.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;While many commissioners did not respond to requests for comment, the commission&#39;s executive director, William A Chambers, provided a statement on behalf of the CCSPUS and its members.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Members of [the commission] were chosen and appointed by Members of Congress based on their national recognition and significant depth of experience in such professions as governmental service, law enforcement, the Armed Forces, law, public administration, intelligence gathering, commerce, or foreign affairs,” wrote Chambers. “Before they began performing their role as Commissioners, they were instructed on the ethics rules that govern congressional entities and were required to comply with rules set forth by the Select Committee on Ethics of the Senate and the Committee on Ethics of the House of Representatives.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chambers did not respond to a request for a copy of the ethics rules.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But the opacity about potential conflicts of interest leaves some experts questioning the CCSPUS&#39;s recommendations.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“There&#39;s a huge argument raging over what is security, how much does it rely on transparency and, especially when it comes to nuclear weapons, there is a call for greater transparency,” said Snyder of the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons. “That light they&#39;re asking to shine on China, North Korea and Iran is a light they also need to shine on their own decision-making.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;em>;Co-published with &lt;a href=&quot;https://responsiblestatecraft.org/&quot;>;Responsible Statecraft&lt;/a>;&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 11 Nov 2023 04:52:01 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Letters containing fentanyl sent to several US states’ election offices]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/nov/10/election-offices-letters-fentanyl-usps]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-10T14:09:50Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ef4eba75913c1a38525e484d40897f19c1988593/0_0_8192_5464/master/8192.jpg?w=600&amp;fit=bounds&amp;sig-ignores-params=true&amp;s=568b9d4f19c2d665fd0aea3b8e50f8b0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;Emergency and law enforcement agencies respond to a possible hazmat situation at the King County Elections office in Renton, Wash., Wednesday, Nov. 8, 2023. Four county elections offices in Washington state were evacuated Wednesday after they received envelopes containing suspicious powders — including two that field-tested positive for fentanyl — while workers were processing ballots from Tuesday&#39;s election.&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Law enforcement officials in the US are searching for the people responsible for sending letters with suspicious substances sent to election offices in at least five states, acts some election officials described as “terrorism”.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Election offices in Georgia, Nevada, California, Oregon and Washington state all were sent the letters, four of which contained the deadly drug fentanyl, &lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/article/election-offices-letters-evacuations-fentanyl-threats-5d39155be4b2fcd5481b570cc109cb9c&quot;>;the Associated Press reported&lt;/a>;.

Steve Hobbs, Washington&#39;s Democratic secretary of state, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sos.wa.gov/about-office/news/2023/county-elections-offices-receive-suspicious-envelopes&quot;>;said the letters were&lt;/a>; “acts of terrorism to threaten our elections”.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Georgia, a letter was sent to Fulton county, the target of many of Donald Trump&#39;s baseless attacks. The Georgia secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, a Republican, said at a Thursday news conference the letters were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.axios.com/2023/11/09/fulton-county-georgia-election-office-threats&quot;>;“domestic terrorism”&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The episode is the latest event to underscore the intensity of the threats and harassment election officials have faced since the 2020 election. Many of them are choosing to leave the profession, prompting concern that there will be a vacuum of experience in election offices that could be filled by novices or election skeptics, producing errors and delays in 2024.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Twelve per cent of election officials started their jobs after the 2020 election, and another 11% say they may leave before 2024, according to an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/poll-election-officials-shows-high-turnover-amid-safety-threats-and&quot;>;April survey&lt;/a>; by the Brennan Center for Justice. Forty-five per cent of election officials say they fear for the safety of other election officials ahead of next year&#39;s presidential election.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Linda Farmer, the county auditor in Pierce county, released an image of the letter her office received. It said “end elections now”, and contained the antifascist symbol, a pentagram and a progress flag, according to the AP. “Stop giving power to the right that they don&#39;t have. We are in charge now and there is no more need for them,” the letter said.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Farmer told the Washington Post that a worker opening mail on Wednesday had discovered the letter and alerted her boss, prompting an evacuation of the facility. Farmer said she had later been told the substance contained in the letter was baking soda.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Oregon secretary of state&#39;s office also told the Washington Post that the election office in Lane county, which includes the city of Eugene, had received a letter, but that it would not affect completing the election.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The California secretary of state, Shirley Weber, a Democrat, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sos.ca.gov/administration/news-releases-and-advisories/2023-news-releases-and-advisories/california-secretary-state-confirms-united-states-postal-service-intercepted-suspicious-packages-headed-elections-facilities&quot;>;confirmed that letters&lt;/a>; had been intercepted and an investigation was ongoing. “Federal and state authorities are investigating the incident, but there has been no confirmation that these envelopes contained any toxic substances,” she said in a statement.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Cisco Aguilar, Nevada&#39;s Democratic secretary of state, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nvsos.gov/sos/Home/Components/News/News/3444/309?backlist=%2fsos&quot;>;also said in a statement&lt;/a>; his office was aware of letters sent to offices there.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Researchers have found that the risk of harm from accidentally touching fentanyl is low.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“This isn&#39;t anything new – this is just a different tactic,” David Becker, an election administration expert at the Center for Election Innovation &amp;amp; Research, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/11/09/fentanyl-letters-election-offices/?utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;utm_campaign=wp_main&quot;>;told the Washington Post&lt;/a>;. “It just represents the difficulty election officials have.”&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 11 Nov 2023 04:52:01 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Rishi Sunak faces Tory civil war as he holds off sacking Suella Braverman]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/nov/10/rishi-sunak-faces-tory-civil-war-holds-off-sacking-suella-braverman]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-10T19:03:30Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2fcb1abdff429fdbefb8ee2dabeef7e5bab83416/6_411_5159_3096/master/5159.jpg?w=600&amp;fit=bounds&amp;sig-ignores-params=true&amp;s=2667959f9c2c3fac82addf7ae4dcbcce&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;Suella Braverman and Rishi Sunak in No 10 last month&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Rishi Sunak is facing a civil war in the Conservative party over the future of the home secretary, as he held off sacking her for saying police were biased for allowing a pro-Palestinian march on Armistice Day.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before what is expected to be one of Britain&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/10/pro-palestine-march-will-be-one-of-uks-biggest-ever-protests-organisers-predict&quot;>;biggest ever days of mass protest&lt;/a>; on Saturday, allies of Suella Braverman claimed more than 50 Tory MPs were fighting to help her keep her job.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some of the MPs – from hard-right Tory groups labelled “the five families” – are also blaming the chief whip, Simon Hart, for orchestrating a plot to get rid of her.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the other side, moderate Tory MPs are furious with Braverman for stoking tensions before the pro-Palestinian protest, and are pressing No 10 and the chief whip to sack her, saying failure to act looks like weakness.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sunak is considering Braverman&#39;s future as home secretary after she defied Downing Street by submitting the controversial piece to the Times &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/nov/09/minister-dismisses-suella-braverman-accusation-met-police-bias&quot;>;without making changes&lt;/a>; it requested.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The home secretary has kept silent since then, but on Friday met Sir Mark Rowley, the Met commissioner, and issued a statement of support for the police in an apparent attempt to calm the furore and stay in post.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A source close to Braverman said: “The commissioner outlined plans to continue working to maintain public order, ensure compliance with the law and maintain the safety of participants, police officers and the general public.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“The home secretary emphasised her full backing for the police in what will be a complex and challenging situation and expressed confidence that any criminality will be dealt with robustly.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since Hamas triggered the war with Israel on 7 October by killing 1,400 people and taking approximately 240 hostages, there have been a series of marches in London and around the UK of up to 100,000 demonstrators. The protesters have been calling for a ceasefire, with Palestinian officials saying more than 10,000 have been killed in Gaza. The marches have largely been peaceful but there have been some arrests for inciting racial hatred.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sunak also said he had been assured by the police that they were “taking all steps to ensure Remembrance services are safeguarded from any protests”.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He added: “It is because of those who fought for this country and for the freedom we cherish that those who wish to protest can do so, but they must do so respectfully and peacefully.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The prime minister&#39;s spokesperson said on Friday that an “ongoing internal process” within No 10 was taking place and that there were no updates on what may happen to Braverman. Whitehall sources suggested Sunak could take the decision on her future next week.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, Tory moderates expressed anger that Sunak had not acted decisively against the home secretary, who has also departed from government policy in recent weeks by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/nov/04/suella-braverman-says-rough-sleeping-is-lifestyle-choice&quot;>;trying to ban charities from giving tents to the homeless&lt;/a>; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/oct/30/uk-ministers-cobra-meeting-terrorism-threat-israel-hamas-conflict-suella-braverman&quot;>;describing pro-Palestinian protests as “hate marches”&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Jeremy Hunt, the chancellor, refused to express confidence in Braverman on Friday, along with Robert Halfon, a senior minister, who said it was a decision for No 10.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Over the last two days, one nation Conservative MPs have privately expressed their discontent at Braverman&#39;s behaviour to the chief whip, with several sources saying they had rarely seen such anger within the moderate wing of the party.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One centrist former minister said they assumed Braverman would be removed within weeks in a reshuffle – unless she quit first. “As a party, our message on immigration and crime is strong, but the messenger has become toxic,” they said. “The only question now is whether Suella decides to resign in protest before she&#39;s sacked.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Senior MPs in the party also criticised the attempts to block the pro-Palestinian protests on Armistice Day and Remembrance Sunday. David Davis, a former Brexit secretary and advocate for civil liberties, said: “The Cenotaph is not an exercise in sentimentality but remembrance and what those wars were fought over – the right to protest, the right to freedom of speech … I am used to home secretaries behaving with a little more gravitas. It&#39;s not just an exercise of taste. It&#39;s an exercise in the necessity of the job. They behave above the fray as best they can because that does not inflame or flare up things that could go through perfectly peacefully.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;David Lidington, a Conservative former de facto deputy prime minister and ex-MP, also warned against the idea that ministers should be able to ban protests in advance. “Those, including some of my former colleagues, arguing or implying that ministers should be able to ban demonstrations might reflect whether they would be happy to see such powers exercised by a leftwing government,” he said.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In defence of Braverman, an ally of the home secretary said at least 52 MPs from the “five families” of hard-right Tory groupings had promised to stand by her if Downing Street attempts to sack her for defying Sunak.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A source close to this group said two of the MPs were on the government payroll and were threatening to resign if Braverman is sacked. Some have said they will write letters to Sir Graham Brady calling for a vote of no confidence in the prime minister if she is removed, the source said.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The MPs are said to be particularly angry with Hart, who they claim is attempting to gather support for Braverman to be removed from office.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The MPs come from among the members of the European Research Group, the Northern Research Group, the New Conservatives, the Common Sense Group and No Turning Back, who have been contacted since it became clear that the home secretary&#39;s position was under threat on Thursday.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The groups have been contacted by WhatsApp, texts and phone calls asking MPs if they were willing to come forward in the event that Sunak attempts to sack Braverman.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The source said the “five families” reference was a “darkly comic” reference to the five families who have been alleged to control the mafia in the US.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One MP said: “There are many people upset about this because Suella has made a very good point about the Met and the treatment of demonstrators, and she also represents what many of our members and constituents actually say and think. To hound her out would be untenable.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The MP declined to say whether they had discussed what action they might take if she was sacked or removed beyond protesting, but added: “It would not stop there. Colleagues are very upset about this – our voice must be heard in the cabinet.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Miriam Cates, a Conservative backbencher, told the BBC she thought Braverman&#39;s views were “mainstream” and much of the public agreed with her, while her colleague Danny Kruger also defended Braverman, saying: “Terrorist sympathisers are marching [through] London calling for the destruction of the Jewish state while the police stand by – but hey let&#39;s all focus on which version of an article was cleared by No 10. Can the media possibly please focus on the things that actually matter?”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Braverman&#39;s article was written in response to the announcement on Wednesday by Rowley that he &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/nov/07/no-grounds-to-ban-pro-palestine-march-in-london-on-armistice-day-met-believes&quot;>;did not have grounds to ban the march&lt;/a>; due to take place on Armistice Day. Sunak had previously urged the police to make full use of the law, suggesting he did not think the “disrespectful” march should go ahead, but ultimately he accepted Rowley&#39;s operational decision.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On Friday, the Met said the policing of the Remembrance weekend would be “far greater and more complex than we&#39;ve delivered before” and that officers would draw on “an extensive set of powers to prevent any disruption whatsoever”, with tight controls put on the movements of protesters.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/08/details-of-pro-palestine-march-in-london-agreed-with-police-says-organiser&quot;>;Ben Jamal&lt;/a>;, the director of the Palestine Solidarity Campaign (PSC), a lead organiser of the march, said he understood people would be travelling from all over the UK to march on Saturday from Park Lane towards the US embassy in south-west London.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On a stage set up near where Nine Elms becomes Battersea Park Road, speeches will be made by the former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, the actors Juliet Stevenson and Maxine Peake, and the head of the Palestinian mission to the UK, Husam Zomlot, among others.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“We think it is going to be huge,” Jamal said. In a statement issued on the eve of the march, the PSC said: “More than 500,000 people are expected to converge in London, making it one of the largest political marches in British history.”&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 11 Nov 2023 04:52:01 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Canada reels at ‘deliberate’ killing of boy, 11, in gangland hit targeting father]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/10/canada-edmonton-shooting-boy-11]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-10T20:09:09Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ca3c866ccf03d9f11ebe6c034c0e9eb3b93dfdbd/0_162_6435_3860/master/6435.jpg?w=600&amp;fit=bounds&amp;sig-ignores-params=true&amp;s=7421ad4a9aa908ac1510761c7b42d5f6&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;Flowers and a teddy bear lie at the scene of the shooting deaths of a father and his 11-year-old son, in Edmonton, on Friday.&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;An 11-year-old boy has been deliberately shot and killed alongside his father in what police called a “sick and twisted” escalation of gang violence in the Canadian city of Edmonton.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The boy, who has not been named, was sitting next to his 41-year-old father, Harpreet Uppal, in their vehicle outside an Edmonton gas station on Thursday when they were deliberately attacked, police said on Friday. Another child, a friend of the boy, was also present but unharmed.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Mr Uppal was followed with the intention of finding him and ending his life. And it happened,” Edmonton police Acting Supt Colin Derksen told reporters. “The young boy, his son … we don&#39;t know if he was targeted in that sense. What we do know is that once the shooter or shooters learned the son was there, they intentionally killed him … He wasn&#39;t caught in the crossfire or killed by mistake. That is sick and twisted.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Police said it was “just too early” to publicly identify the younger victim.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A burned-out vehicle found nearby is believed to be tied to the shooting.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Officers confirmed Uppal was known to police and had previously been shot and wounded in an attack at a pizza restaurant in 2021. On that occasion he was also with his family, when a man walked up to a window directly in front them and fired multiple shots through the glass. Only Uppal was injured in that attack.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Autopsies on Uppal and his son have been scheduled for early next week.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“With a heavy heart, I contemplate how it&#39;s conceivable for a child to be killed in such a tragic manner like this,” Alberta&#39;s premier, Danielle Smith, said in a statement. “Like many of you, I am concerned with the rise in gun violence in our neighbourhoods.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Edmonton, like other metropolitan areas across the country, is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.edmontonpolice.ca/CommunityPolicing/OrganizedCrime/GunsandGangsStrategy&quot;>;grappling with an increase&lt;/a>; in shootings and gang-related crimes. But the death of a child has intensified police efforts to solve Thursday&#39;s daylight shooting.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“We&#39;re going to give it everything we got,” said Derksen. “We&#39;re pulling out all the stops.

The owner of Wellington Rafting has just taken five tourists down the swollen rapids of the Te Awa Kairangi/Hutt river.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It has been a good morning for it – rain the previous day has lifted the river levels, giving customers a thrilling ride as they flew over gushing white water, hurling their rafts over hidden boulders and negotiating eddies near the gnarled banks.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It can be a dangerous sport, with potential problems around every bend – from slippery rocks to flash flooding and landslides, or being turfed out of the boat – but Watters has his safety protocols down pat.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“That stuff we can mitigate, by studying the environment … we find ourselves very, very connected to the elements,” Watters says.&lt;/p>; &lt;figure data-media-id=&quot;495c5fbf90b915869a9320ca9a57bc4dee8298f0&quot;>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://media.guim.co.uk/495c5fbf90b915869a9320ca9a57bc4dee8298f0/0_0_5472_3648/1000.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Hamish Watters, owner of Wellington Rafting.&quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; height=&quot;667&quot;>; &lt;figcaption>; &lt;span>;Hamish Watters, owner of Wellington Rafting.&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;Photograph: Eva Corlett/The Guardian&lt;/span>; &lt;/figcaption>; &lt;/figure>; &lt;p>;Customers are given a full run-down of the hazards before they go near the water and are prepared with a safety briefing “so they can 100% understand the risks involved”, Watters says.

Now, that responsibility will be even greater.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The safety of adventure tourism has been pulled into sharper focus after a court ruling last week found the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/31/white-island-volcano-eruption-whakaari-management-found-guilty-of-astonishing-safety-failures&quot;>;owners of Whakaari/White Island volcano guilty&lt;/a>; of failing to adequately communicate the risks to visitors touring active volcano. In 2019, the volcano – a popular tourist destination 48km off the east coast of the North Island – &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/09/white-island-new-zealand-volcano-eruption-with-tourist-present&quot;>;erupted&lt;/a>;, killing 22 people who were touring the crater and injuring 25.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The disaster has led to tougher regulations requiring tourist operators to tell customers about serious risks before they embark on an adventure, but questions remain over the lasting impact of the tragedy on the wider adventure tourism industry, which forms a crucial part of New Zealand&#39;s NZ$40bn (£19.3bn) tourism sector.&lt;/p>; &lt;figure data-media-id=&quot;5a619c30ff2b97d872b95c5d66873a740da356e7&quot;>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://media.guim.co.uk/5a619c30ff2b97d872b95c5d66873a740da356e7/0_0_5472_3648/1000.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The all-important safety gear at Wellington Rafting.&quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; height=&quot;667&quot;>; &lt;figcaption>; &lt;span>;The all-important safety gear at Wellington Rafting.

New Zealand is an outlier among other jurisdictions in requiring adventure activity operators to register their activities, thereby increasing the regulatory oversight of their business.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“New Zealand has a global reputation in international tourism for being an advanced democracy, with legal systems and tourism policies in place and a safe destination that people visit to experience nature,” Higham says.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Adventure tourism is not consistently tracked as a separate industry, but figures from 2011 show that 36% of international tourists that year took part in at least one adventure tourism activity while in New Zealand, contributing $4.1bn to the economy.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“It&#39;s fair to say that we&#39;ve become known internationally for the ability to get your blood pumping,” says Rebecca Ingram, the chief executive of Tourism Industry Aoteaora, the national body for tourism operators.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“We&#39;re not the sort of destination where you lie by the pool – you&#39;re likely really motivated by getting into the outdoors and experiencing the environment, because that&#39;s what a holiday in New Zealand entails,” Ingram said.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But the potential of natural risk looms large in New Zealand, an island nation that forms a spine over a tectonic fault line, and which is exposed to seismic, geothermal and meteorological hazards.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Activities such as bungee jumping look enormously risky, when in actual fact they are “planned to the nth degree”, Higham says. Meanwhile, “going off into the national park on a beautiful spring day has a very low perceived risk but circumstances can change and those can be extremely challenging environments.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When Whakaari erupted, the world became aware of just how sudden and how devastating New Zealand&#39;s natural hazards could be. Some survivors of the eruption told a New Zealand court in July they were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/13/white-island-volcano-eruption-trial-australian-witness-no-warning&quot;>;not informed of the potential dangers &lt;/a>;regarding a possible volcanic eruption until they were already on the volcano, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/12/couple-who-survived-white-island-volcano-tell-court-they-werent-warned-of-danger&quot;>;safety measures were lax&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Tougher regulations imposed&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;In response to the tragedy and lack of proper communication over risk, the Labour government announced the introduction of tougher safety regulations on the industry to come into effect in April 2024, with a further sector-wide review earmarked for 2026.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The incoming rules will heighten the onus on operators, as well as landowners, transport providers and tour companies, to communicate serious risks to customers before they buy a ticket. They will also be expected to consistently assess risk and work with agencies such as GNS, which monitors seismic activity, and meteorological services to provide day-to-day updates about hazards.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The country&#39;s primary workplace and safety regulator, WorkSafe, will also receive expanded powers to shut down operators immediately and refuse registrations if there is evidence of imminent risk to people.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many operators already working to meet the requirements, says Ingram, and the organisation will work with the industry to get everyone up to speed by next year. But WorkSafe has not yet released “really important information” about how the rules will be applied, she adds, including the degree of responsibility on operators throughout the supply-chain and how natural hazards will be managed.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fundamentally, however, operators understand that maintaining a reputation as a safe country for adventure sports will keep the sector booming.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“It is incredibly important that we take care of our manuhiri [guests] and that they leave the country with wonderful memories,” Ingram says.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Rafting guide Watters believes operators will take the new rules in their stride. Managing ever-shifting environments, be they regulatory or natural, is part of the job.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Adventure guides are really used to being dynamic and adapting to new changes – that&#39;s our work all the time, and that&#39;s why we love it.”&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 11 Nov 2023 03:22:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[The Beatles set record 54-year gap between No 1 singles as Now and Then tops UK chart]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/nov/10/the-beatles-54-years-no-1-singles-now-and-then-uk-chart]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-10T18:00:12Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8401c421f7a1a749a1d55ee92f606cdffe2f2982/0_509_4501_2701/master/4501.jpg?w=600&amp;fit=bounds&amp;sig-ignores-params=true&amp;s=40bbf5eb8182c2698e0ea44cdc522bf7&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;The Beatles in 1969, the previous year they topped the UK chart.&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;The Beatles have broken UK chart records as they return to No 1 with their “final” song together, Now and Then – their 18th chart-topper in total.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Their 17th No 1 was The Ballad of John and Yoko in 1969, meaning they are now the artists with the longest gap between No 1 singles: 54 years, smashing the record set last year by Kate Bush when she reached the top with Running Up That Hill, 44 years after her No 1 with Wuthering Heights. Neither of the new songs the living members of the Beatles released in 1995 and 1996, Free as a Bird and Real Love, topped the charts.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Now and Then, a midtempo ballad written by John Lennon in the late 1970s, uses his original demo recording combined with guitar lines recorded by the late George Harrison in 1994, plus new parts recorded by Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr.

With 19,400 vinyl copies sold, it&#39;s the fastest selling vinyl single of the century, and its total physical sales of 38,000 were the biggest single week of physical sales since 2014, when X Factor winner Ben Haenow reached Christmas No 1 with Something I Need.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Now and Then was also streamed more than 5 million times in the UK, by far the highest single week figure for any Beatles song. The Beatles&#39; return was so anticipated that Now and Then actually reached the charts last Friday after being on release for just 10 hours before that week&#39;s cutoff, reaching No 42.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The band extend their record as the British artist with the most No 1 singles, with Official Charts Company chief executive Martin Talbot saying: “If there were ever any doubts that the Beatles are the greatest band of all time, they have surely consigned them to history this week.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;They will need to find a fair bit more in the vaults if they want to beat Elvis Presley, who has 21 No 1s, though Peter Jackson, who directed Now and Then&#39;s music video, has said it&#39;s not beyond the realms of possibility. “We can take a performance from [Jackson&#39;s documentary film] Get Back, separate John and George, and then have Paul and Ringo add a chorus or harmonies,” he told the Sunday Times this week. “You might end up with a decent song but I haven&#39;t had conversations with Paul about that.
