alt=&quot;&quot;>;蒂姆·皮克穿着宇航员装备&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;蒂姆·皮克支持太空太阳能发电场的想法，称这个概念“变得绝对可行”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;宇航员 Maj Peake 表示，将重型货物送入轨道的成本不断下降，这意味着太阳能发电场等复杂结构很快就能发射到太空，并且提供强大电力的潜力。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;皮克是第一位访问国际空间站的英国欧洲航天局 (ESA) 宇航员，他说：“最终归结为硬数字。将数千吨硬件发射到近地轨道变得绝对可行。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;欧空局一直在探索天基太阳能发电厂的想法，并于今年委托进行了两项“概念研究”。它希望到 2025 年向欧盟提交一个商业案例。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Peake 表示，该机构已经计算出，当货物可以以 1,000 美元（807 英镑）的成本发射时，太空太阳能发电场在经济上是可行的。每公斤或更少。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“到目前为止，实际成本约为每公斤 2,700 美元，”他上周在一次能源技术峰会上表示，但他表示，两枚火箭是由 SpaceX 设计的。埃隆·马斯克（Elon Musk）可以解决这个问题。 “使用猎鹰重型火箭发射可以将其降低至约 1,500 美元，而所谓的星舰则将其降低一个数量级，达到每公斤约 300 美元。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;猎鹰重型火箭已经在运输卫星等货物进入太空，而星舰正在开发中。 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/apr/20/elon-musks-spacex-launches-test-flight-for-rocket-that-c​​ould-bring-people-to-mars &quot;>;四月份的一次无人试飞在升空后几分钟就爆炸了。&lt;/a>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;与以前的发射器不同，它们被编程为完好无损地返回地球并且可重复使用。这意味着每次发射无需建造全新的火箭，从而降低了总体成本。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;欧空局的 Solaris 计划旨在将太阳能电池板发射到太空，每个太阳能电池板都经过编程，可以通过机器人与其他电池板连接来建造太阳能发电场。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;虽然地球上的太阳能发电场无法在黑暗时期（例如夜间或天气恶劣时）发电，但太空电池板能够持续收集太阳能.&lt;/p>;

&lt;/aside>; &lt;p>;皮克说：“如果你可以在太空中建造太阳能发电厂，那么你就可以通过微波将能量传输到地面站。这意味着来自太空的清洁、无限的能源成为绝对可能。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;今年，英国大学和科技公司宣布将获得 430 万英镑的政府资金来开发&lt;a href=&quot;https ://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/oct/09/beam-me-down-can-solar-power-from-space-help-solve-our-energy-needs&quot;>;太空太阳能&lt;

&lt;p>;不过，这种发展需要很多年的时间，而且不太可能帮助解决世界上任何紧迫的能源挑战。&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 18 Sep 2023 01:52:01 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Top US and Chinese diplomats meet in Malta to smooth strained relations]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/sep/17/china-united-states-jake-sullivan-wang-yi-meeting-malta]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-17T17:31:28Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/918e80c8cc974a1b3cb526c76254a6b3499d7548/0_175_8114_4872 /master/8114.jpg?w=600&amp;fit=bounds&amp;sig-ignores-params=true&amp;s=c6afec170d3ec3dafdeb11a5578ace42&quot;

&lt;p>;上周，中国最高安全机构暗示，两国领导人之间的任何会晤都取决于美国“表现出足够的诚意”。拜登和习近平自 2022 年 11 月以来就没有见过面，当时他们在印度尼西亚巴厘岛举行的 G20 峰会上举行了三个半小时的会外会议。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在那次会面后，拜登表示，美国将“与中国“积极竞争”，同时坚称自己“&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2022/11/14/remarks-by-president-biden-in-a -press-conference-bali-indonesia/&quot;>;不寻找冲突&lt;/a>;”。习近平表示，各国需要“探索正确的相处之道”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但习近平没有出席上周末在印度新德里举行的 G20 峰会。拜登后来表示失望，但补充说他将“去见他”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;白宫周日提供的消息称，沙利文和王之间的会面是“持续努力保持开放”的一部分声明补充说，此次会谈是在巴厘岛会谈、沙利文和王毅五月份的会晤以及过去几个月美国对北京的外交访问的基础上进行的。布林肯、财政部长珍妮特·耶伦、气候特使约翰·克里和商务部长吉娜·雷蒙多。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;美国通知称，沙利文在会议期间“指出了台湾海峡和平与稳定的重要性”。根据中国外交部的声明，王毅警告美国，台湾是“中美关系第一条不可逾越的红线”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;em>;路透社提供报道&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 18 Sep 2023 01:52:01 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[New York City daycare owner charged with murder after infant overdose death]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/sep/17/bronx-daycare-owner-murder-charge-opioid-overdose-infant]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-17T17:05:03Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0a6161897343375d0a39d40ae40dbfbbde2155ab/0_200_6000_3600 /master/6000.jpg?w=600&amp;fit=bounds&amp;sig-ignores-params=true&amp;s=963963664b569b50c324cffa2596d56f&quot;

&lt;p>;“看到人们有更多的时间能够与孩子、家人在一起，能够做更多的事情……文化活动，接受更好的教育，这将是一件了不起的事情。因此，……确保人工智能[和]机器人技术造福我们所有人——而不仅仅是上层人士——的想法绝对是我们需要讨论的。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;桑德斯，一位独立党员，与在国情咨文主持人杰克·塔珀向国会民主党人询问美国汽车工人联合会寻求的每周四天工作制后，他发表了上述评论。该工会约 13,000 名工人在放弃前一天结束时到期的续签合同谈判后，于周五对美国三大汽车制造商——通用汽车、福特和克莱斯勒母公司 Stellantis 进行了罢工。&lt;/p >; &lt;p>;塔珀问桑德斯，&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/sep/15/bernie-sanders-uaw-auto-workers-strike-detroit-rally&quot;>;谁出现了周五在一次支持罢工的集会上，缩短工作周的概念是否可能只是美国汽车工人联合会在其他一些要求得到满足后会放弃的一种谈判策略。但桑德斯为这一要求的有效性进行了辩护，同时也抓住时机重申了对汽车制造商高管收取的花哨工资的批评。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;桑德斯 - 参议院健康、教育、劳工和养老金委员会主席– 暗示通用汽车、福特和 Stellantis 的首席执行官如何赚到比工人工资中位数高出数百倍的钱。根据 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.epi.org/blog/uaw-automakers-negotiations 的数据，2013 年至 2022 年间，他们的工资上涨了 40%，而工人的实际时薪自 2008 年以来下降了约五分之一。 /&quot;>;经济政策研究所&lt;/a>;。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;根据美国汽车工人联合会的说法，这种差异表明，在 2008-09 年金融危机之后，工人从未因老板要求他们做出的牺牲而得到充分补偿，当时他们同意以救助汽车行业的名义进行大量削减。工会罢工成员的要求包括，除了每周 32 小时工作制外，工资增加 40%、更好的退休福利和工作保障。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;75% 的美国人支持罢工的汽车工人，根据盖洛普&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/americans-side-with-striking-uaw/&quot;>;最近的一项民意调查&lt;/a>;。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;尽管如此，罢工的规模之大可能会扰乱整个美国经济，并最终可能意味着本已陷入困境的通勤者的汽车价格上涨。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;与此同时，美国汽车工人联合会主席肖恩·费恩 (Shawn Fain) 周日告诉 MSNBC 和 CBS工会与汽车制造商之间的谈判进展缓慢。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在桑德斯露面之前，美国前共和党副总统迈克·彭斯 (Mike Pence) 试图将汽车工人的损失归咎于乔·拜登 (JoeBiden) 的白宫。彭斯说：“所有那些辛勤工作的汽车工人都生活在与其他美国人相同的现实中，那就是工资跟不上通货膨胀。”但桑德斯声称汽车行业的高层管理人员应对这次罢工负全部责任。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“在我看来，美国人已经厌倦了......企业的贪婪，最富有的人变得更加富有，”桑德斯说。 “在我看来，你在汽车行业看到的情况，就是我们在整个经济中看到的情况——上层的贪婪，工人阶级的痛苦，人们对此感到厌倦。&lt;/p >; &lt;p>;“你们这些高高在上的人——你们从来没有过得这么好。 ……因此，UAW 正在奋起反抗企业的贪婪。我为他们所做的事情鼓掌。”&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot;

&lt;p>;“如果有人认为我们面临的这场危机可以在意大利境内解决，这将是一个非常大的错误，因为这个问题涉及到每个人，需要每个人共同解决，”梅洛尼说。 “我继续说，我们永远不会仅仅通过谈论[移民]的重新分配来解决这个问题——解决这个问题的唯一方法就是停止离境。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;冯德莱恩承诺将迅速驱逐那些非法移民。未能获得庇护，也未能打击人口走私的“残酷行径”。 “我们将决定谁加入欧盟，以及在什么情况下加入。不是走私者，”她说。&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;Over 127,000 people – more than double the number over the same period last year – have landed on Italian soil so far in 2023.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“I&#39;m travelling to fulfil my dream, which is to go to England, finish my studies and become a doctor,” said Musa Adam, from Sudan, as he waited to be transferred off the island on Saturday night.

These people deserve respect, and so do we.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Meloni, whose election pledge was to stop illegal immigration, is hoping the deal with Tunisia can provide a solution. The EU has insisted that the budget allocated to Tunisia would be paid out – it is currently refitting 17 vessels for the Tunisian authorities to use in search and rescue operations.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, a group of MEPs from the European parliament were refused entry to the country, raising fresh concerns about President Kais Saied&#39;s commitment to address questions of human rights abuses. He has previously declared that Tunisia would not be Europe&#39;s border guard.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The EU migration pact was driven by Meloni, but is backed by the rest of Europe, where migration is seen as a critical issue in elections, particularly those looming in Poland and the Netherlands.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A further £150m is available under the deal with Tunisia to help with economic reforms and develop industrial ties with Europe including green energy.&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 18 Sep 2023 00:52:01 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Balmain chief says at least 50 pieces for Paris fashion week have been stolen]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/sep/17/balmain-chief-says-at-least-50-pieces-for-paris-fashion-week-have-been-stolen]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-17T15:54:10Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/34355812a7578fecba1bf2b43777790ed0033219/0_72_2999_1800/master/2999.jpg?w=600&amp;fit=bounds&amp;sig-ignores-params=true&amp;s=9e2f5f412c3dfcfdd871f703b593055c&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;Olivier Rousteing&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Balmain artistic director Olivier Rousteing has said robbers have made off with more than 50 pieces of the new collection that his Paris house intended to show at fashion week later this month.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Posting overnight on Sunday on Instagram, Rousteing said a group of people hijacked his delivery driver on the way from an airport to Balmain&#39;s Paris headquarters.

I frankly think testing would be a good thing.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2020, it was revealed that some of the early questions in that test involved Trump identifying an elephant and counting backward from 100.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Asked if it is time for a new generation of US leadership, Trump said: “It&#39;s always time for a new generation.” But he qualified his answer: “Some of the greatest world leaders have been in their 80s.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Those remarks from Trump came after retiring Republican US senator Mitt Romney of Utah called for a “new generation of leaders”.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Trump notably defended Biden, his Democratic rival, on his age. A poll last month from the Associated Press and Norc Center for Public Affairs showed 77% of Americans – including 69% of Democrats – think the 80-year-old Biden is too old to serve a second term.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“I don&#39;t think Biden&#39;s too old,” Trump said to Welker. “But I think he&#39;s incompetent, and that&#39;s a bigger problem. It&#39;s really a level of competency, not the age.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Two days before Trump attacked Biden&#39;s acuity, Trump told a summit in Washington that a “cognitively impaired” Biden would lead the US into “world war two”, which occurred between 1939 and 1945.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Meanwhile, Trump said he “liked the concept” of having a woman as his running mate if he wins the Republican nomination, adding that he had his eye on Noem, the South Dakota governor. “I think she&#39;s fantastic,” he said. “She&#39;s been a great governor. She gave me a very full-throated endorsement, a beautiful endorsement actually. Certainly she&#39;d be one of the people I&#39;d consider.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Noem recently confirmed that she was a candidate for the position. “Of course, I would consider it,” &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/south-dakota-gov-kristi-noem-consider-trumps-vice-president-spot-asked&quot;>;she told Fox News&lt;/a>;.

How do you do it?&#39; I don&#39;t even think about it.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“I truly feel that, in the end, we&#39;re going to win.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Trump has maintained he would not pardon himself if he is re-elected, but he revealed to Welker that he had discussed pardoning himself in the dying days of his presidency – a sign that he and his legal team understood the legal peril he brought on to himself by challenging the election&#39;s results.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He said his failed election challenges eventually prompted him to ignore advice from his attorneys “because I didn&#39;t respect them”.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mediaite.com/tv/sold-her-soul-boycottmeetthepress-trends-big-over-welkers-trump-interview/&quot;>;Sunday&#39;s interview earned NBC criticism&lt;/a>; from many commentators who questioned the wisdom of giving such a soapbox to Trump after his alleged criminal misdeeds from before, during and after his presidency.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One question by Welker that some dismissed as a soft-ball sought to discuss the contents of a message that Trump left for Biden when he left the White House.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Earlier this year, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/media/2023/may/10/donald-trump-cnn-town-hall-media-analysis&quot;>;CNN was pilloried&lt;/a>; for giving Trump a town hall-style platform in New Hampshire that indirectly led to the dismissal of its programming architect, former morning TV producer and CNN chief Chris Licht.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;NBC has said the network has also invited Biden to sit down for an interview with Welker.&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 17 Sep 2023 23:52:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Women urged to come forward with Russell Brand concerns as charity cuts ties]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/sep/17/amnesty-international-urges-women-to-come-forward-with-russell-brand-concerns]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-17T13:12:52Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c9c9a70767922f9c2e43583517b8ab0563c747e8/0_307_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?w=600&amp;fit=bounds&amp;sig-ignores-params=true&amp;s=9057299b1ae26832a387e5d225d96ca4&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;Russell Brand in 2006.&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Amnesty International has urged women to come forward if they have any concerns about the behaviour of Russell Brand during his participation in two of the charity&#39;s standup comedy events in 2006 and 2012, after the publication of allegations of rape, sexual assault and emotional abuse.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It follows the announcement by a charity which supports vulnerable women recovering from addiction that it would sever links with Brand. The Trevi women and children&#39;s charity said it had ended its association with Brand and his charitable fund, the Stay Free Foundation.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On Saturday, the Sunday Times published allegations that Brand had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/russell-brand-rape-sexual-assault-abuse-allegations-investigation-v5hxdlmb6&quot;>;sexually assaulted four women&lt;/a>;, after a years-long investigation into claims about Brand&#39;s behaviour in collaboration with Channel 4&#39;s Dispatches.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The allegations date between 2006 and 2013, at the height of Brand&#39;s fame, when the comedian was working for BBC Radio 2 and Channel 4 as well as starring in Hollywood films.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The 48-year-old, who has lately recast himself as a health guru, is in the middle of a national standup comedy tour. He is due to appear in Windsor, Wolverhampton and Plymouth in the coming days, amid calls online for the venues to cancel the shows.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A production company that allegedly received complaints against Brand while he was working for them has also launched an “urgent” internal investigation into allegations of serious misconduct while he was presenting shows.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A researcher claimed that concerns about Brand&#39;s behaviour while he worked on Big Brother spin-off shows in 2004 and 2005 were reported to production managers at Endemol, the company that produced the programmes.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Banjay UK, which bought Endemol in 2020, said that in light of the “very serious allegations” it had “launched an urgent internal investigation and will cooperate with any requests for information from broadcast partners and external agencies”.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“We also encourage anybody who feels that they were affected by Brand&#39;s behaviour while working on these productions to contact us in confidence,” it added.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In a statement, Amnesty International said it found the allegations “shocking and distressing” and that it did not have a relationship with the comedian. Brand took part in the charity&#39;s Secret Policeman&#39;s Ball event in 2012 and 2006.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The charity said that while “no complaints or concerns” were raised at the time of the events in relation to his conduct, it was “very aware of the barriers women face in raising complaints of sexual assault, and would encourage any women to let us know if there is anything that they experienced at that time that is of concern”.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Trevi, which is based in south-west England, said it was “deeply saddened and upset” by the news and that it had ended its association with Brand and his charity. Brand&#39;s Stay Free Foundation funds charities that work to support people “through recovery from addiction, their mental health issues and the non-profit organisations that help them”.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Announcing its decision to cut ties on its Instagram account, Trevi said: “Russell became aware of our charity in 2022 after hearing about some of the incredible mothers we have helped to become drug-free over the years. He wanted to support our cause and raise money through his Stay Free Foundation.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Today&#39;s media revelations have been difficult to process but our priority remains and continues to be the safety and wellbeing of all women and girls now and in the future. We have ended our association with Russell Brand and the Stay Free Foundation.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It added: “As a charity whose values put women&#39;s voices at the heart of what we do, we always prioritise supporting women affected by violence and abuse and empower them to live without violence and fear.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The allegations published on Saturday included the claim that Brand entered into a relationship with a schoolgirl when she was 16 and he was 31. She reportedly said he referred to her as “the child” during an alleged emotionally abusive and controlling three-month relationship.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another woman alleged that Brand raped her in 2012 in his Los Angeles home, according to reporting in the Sunday Times, which said she received treatment at a rape crisis centre the same day.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In a video statement, posted online ahead of the publication of the claims, Brand claimed he was facing a “litany of extremely egregious and aggressive attacks”.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He continued: “These allegations pertain to the time when I was working in the mainstream, when I was in the newspapers all the time, when I was in the movies and, as I have written about extensively in my books, I was very, very promiscuous.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Now, during that time of promiscuity the relationships I had were absolutely, always consensual. I was always transparent about that then, almost too transparent, and I am being transparent about it now as well.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“To see that transparency metastasised into something criminal, that I absolutely deny, makes me question is there another agenda at play.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Brand has been contacted for comment.&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 17 Sep 2023 22:22:01 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Libya floods: warlord using disaster response to exert control, say observers]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/sep/17/ibya-floods-derna-warlord-khalifa-haftar-libyan-national-army]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-17T14:19:47Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/040eb8c728040bbbb8910058848b1459c98de60b/0_11_3543_2126/master/3543.jpg?w=600&amp;fit=bounds&amp;sig-ignores-params=true&amp;s=00a80bd78cef3ecb10b72d253b743d6a&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;Search and rescue operation teams continue their efforts in Derna, Libya on 17 September 2023.&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;As search and rescue teams continue to hunt for bodies trapped underneath the mud and rubble of their homes in the Libyan coastal city of Derna, observers say the warlord Khalifa Haftar and his sons are using &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/sep/16/second-humanitarian-crisis-feared-in-wake-of-libya-floods-as-hopes-of-finding-survivors-fade&quot;>;the disaster response&lt;/a>; as a way to exert control rather than ensure vital humanitarian relief reaches civilians.&lt;/p>; &lt;aside>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Related: &lt;/span>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2023/sep/16/libyan-reporters-floods-journalists-storm&quot;>;&#39;Towns were erased&#39;: Libyan reporters on the &#39;horrifying, harrowing&#39; aftermath of floods&lt;/a>;&lt;/p>; &lt;/aside>; &lt;p>;At least 11,300 people have died and over 10,000 are missing, according to the Libyan Red Crescent, after two dams burst during a powerful storm last week.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The resulting floods have completely destroyed almost 900 buildings in Derna, according to the country&#39;s National Unity government, based in the north-western city of Tripoli.

He praised the actions of first responders as well as members of the LNA, a coalition of militias overseen by the ageing former CIA asset and US citizen, whom critics accuse of running areas under his control akin to a military dictator.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“On the public relations side, they are leveraging their pre-existing propaganda channels to appear in control, while being the main interface for administering crisis relief and being the custodians of the city,” said Badi. “But again, that&#39;s creating bottlenecks everywhere.

On the same day that disaster struck Derna, Khalifa Haftar&#39;s eldest son, Elseddik, declared his interest in running for president of Libya in long-delayed elections.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Observers said 32-year-old Saddam Haftar, often seen as the likely heir despite his brothers&#39; efforts, quickly used his role as the head of Libya&#39;s disaster response committee to legitimise his international standing while keeping a tight grip on aid.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Saddam Haftar heads the Tariq Ben Zayed brigades, a militia that is part of the LNA and was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2022/12/libya-hold-commanders-of-tariq-ben-zeyad-armed-group-accountable-for-catalogue-of-horrors/&quot;>;recently accused by Amnesty International&lt;/a>; of “inflicting a catalogue of horrors, including unlawful killings, torture and other ill-treatment, enforced disappearance, rape and other sexual violence, and forced displacement – with no fear of consequences”.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Jalel Harchaoui, a specialist on Libya and associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, pointed to Saddam Haftar&#39;s efforts to demonstrate control over international aid teams arriving in Derna and how this has slowed vital disaster response in a time of crisis: “Everything is concentrated in the hands of the Haftar family. I wish I could tell you that there are other power centres in eastern Libya, but there&#39;s no such thing.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For much of the past decade Libya has remained fiercely &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/04/fears-for-libyan-oil-production-amid-military-action-threats&quot;>;divided between eastern and western factions&lt;/a>; with their own patchwork of military interests, after a military intervention by Nato forces to support an uprising against the former dictator Muammar Gaddafi.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Harchaoui said the Haftar clan&#39;s control over response efforts, particularly the prominent role of Saddam Haftar, provided little hope that any domestic or international investigation into the loss of life in Derna could fully scrutinise their roles as the officials in charge, as well as any others responsible.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Libyan prosecutor general, al-Sediq al-Sour, promised &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/sep/16/second-humanitarian-crisis-feared-in-wake-of-libya-floods-as-hopes-of-finding-survivors-fade&quot;>;to investigate the collapse of both dams&lt;/a>; in Derna, as well as the allocation of millions of dollars in funding intended to maintain the structures, which were built in the 1970s. While pledging to probe local authorities in Derna and previous governments, al-Sour also met with Saddam Haftar. Local television reported that Derna&#39;s mayor was suspended pending investigation on Saturday.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Saddam is positioning himself as the boss. You need to physically access victims and the city, and to do that they depend on his goodwill,” said Harchaoui. “Slowly things are orienting towards one conclusion, which is that only mid-level officials can be blamed. A large part of the conclusion is excluded from the start, it&#39;s not an open investigation.”&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 17 Sep 2023 22:22:01 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[Halliburton equipment worth $7.1m exported to Russia in past year, customs records show]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/sep/17/russia-trade-halliburton-equipment-export-us-oil]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-17T13:37:02Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fee69d5dcd361df7736781821a8c8409fbc4a0d7/0_129_1280_768/master/1280.jpg?w=600&amp;fit=bounds&amp;sig-ignores-params=true&amp;s=691ad635c1f20ea4b207cdd297b8132b&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;Ukrainian soldiers holding a flag of Ukraine on an oil platform in the Black Sea&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;US oil and gas multinationals are facing fresh questions over their trade with Russia after customs records revealed that more than $7.1m (£5.7m) worth of equipment manufactured by Halliburton has been exported into the country since it announced the end of its Russian operations.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Last September Halliburton, one of the world&#39;s largest providers of products and services for oil and gas exploration, sold its Russian office to local management amid pressure on all US companies to cease their trade after the invasion of Ukraine.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Russian customs records seen by the Guardian show that despite this move to sell up on 8 September, Halliburton subsidiaries exported equipment of a value of $5,729,600 to its former operation in Russia in the six weeks that followed the sale.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The equipment was largely shipped from the US and Singapore although the records show it originated in a range of countries, including the UK, Belgium and France.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The bulk of exports from the subsidiaries ended on 6 October but the last shipment to Russia from a Halliburton company, recorded as Halliburton MFG in the records, was of a sealing element priced at $2,939.40 on 24 October 2022 from Malaysia to a firm called Sakhalin Energy, a consortium that is developing the Sakhalin-2 oil and gas project in eastern Russian. Its investors include Gazprom. Shell disinvested from the consortium after the invasion of Ukraine.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After a short pause, imports of Halliburton equipment to Russia then resumed in December 2022 from two companies unrelated to the US multinational.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The products were imported from Turkey, bringing the total value of exports of Halliburton equipment to Russia since the company closed its operations to at least $7,163,317.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of all the exports to Russia made since last September, 98% were supplied to Halliburton&#39;s newly independent former operation, known as BurService, whose clients have included Gazprom, Rosneft, TNK-BP and Lukoil.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to customs records, exports to Russia of Halliburton equipment, which range in type from pumps, to wrenches for the drilling of wells, and cement additives, continued until at least the end of June this year. More recent records are yet to be made available.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is exasperation in Ukraine at the lethargy of many large industrial players in the west in extracting themselves from the Russian economy.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The findings illustrate the difficulties multinational companies have had in unpicking their trading relationships and in controlling the distribution of their products via third parties.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some of the world&#39;s largest US oil and gas field service companies are already facing questions over their conduct. The Kremlin is heavily dependent on its oil and gas sector for the revenue that funds its military.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Earlier this month, the head of the US Senate foreign relations committee, Bob Menendez, wrote to Halliburton and their competitors SLB and Baker Hughes, after reports that the companies had continued to trade with Russia to various degrees after the invasion of Ukraine in February last year.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Menendez, in letters to the chief executives of the three companies, said he was “extremely disturbed” by an AP report that sales had continued in 2022. He accused the management of seeking to “make a profit” rather stand in solidarity with Ukraine.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Baker Hughes sold its oilfield services business in Russia nine months after the invasion. SLB, which reportedly had 9,000 employees working in Russia, announced only in July this year that it would stop exporting technology to Russia.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is no suggestion that any of the companies breached the sanctions regime of the US or its western partners.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is understood that the sale date of Halliburton&#39;s operations in Russia was not fixed until late in the day, which may account for those shipments from its subsidiaries that left for the country shortly before and soon after 8 September.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A spokesperson for Halliburton said: “Halliburton was the first major oilfield services company to exit Russia, in full compliance with sanctions. It has been more than a year since we have conducted operations there.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Halliburton wound down its Russia operations and completed the sale of its Russia business in less than six months while prioritising safety and securing the necessary government approvals, including for shipments to Russia. Halliburton no longer conducts operations in Russia.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Halliburton, which was led by the former US vice-president Dick Cheney, posted a gross profit for the 12 months ending 30 June 2023 of $4.052bn, a 63.19% increase year-on-year despite writing off $300m on the sale of the Russian operation.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Glib Kanevskyi, chief executive of the Kyiv-based thinktank StateWatch, said that western governments needed to do more to persuade their large companies to better control the distribution of products which could be useful to the Russian economy.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He added that companies such as Halliburton should be encouraged to be transparent about how they are ensuring their products are being kept out of the Russian market.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Kanevskyi said: “When we talk about the Halliburton case, we need to understand that it cannot be effective if, for example, the USA or other countries will try to punish some company involved in this scheme to ship Halliburton equipment to Russia. It cannot be effective in my opinion.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“If the international community will collaborate and involve businesses then it can be helpful. It&#39;s not easy. What countries can do today is dialogue with its own businesses. If we talk about Halliburton it is a serious player in the world and the US government can have a conversation with it and see how it can better control its distribution process”.&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 17 Sep 2023 21:52:02 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
