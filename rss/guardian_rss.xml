It will be published in the US next Tuesday. The Guardian obtained a copy.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Murdoch&#39;s “hand suddenly hit the table, a hard blow, shaking it”, Wolff writes in the book. “This might have appeared like sudden fury at his wife … But, no, it was directed somewhere else.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“At Trump, apparently. Here, nearly under his breath, was a rat-a-tat-tat of jaw-clenching &#39;fucks&#39;. Murdoch was as passionate in his Trump revulsion as any helpless liberal.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Wolff, Hall said Murdoch should “do something” about Trump, only for a friend to say: “But he can&#39;t. He&#39;ll lose money.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wolff writes: “Money. &#39;This lawsuit could cost us fifty million dollars,&#39; [Murdoch] said quietly, but clearly.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Dominion sued for $1.6bn but settled for $787.5m. The terms of the settlement were not released. Tucker Carlson, the former far-right star of Fox News&#39;s prime-time lineup, has said he “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jul/26/tucker-carlson-fox-news-firing-condition-dominion-settlement&quot;>;knows&lt;/a>;” his later dismissal was part of the deal.

His Republican supremacy unchallenged, he enjoys &lt;a href=&quot;https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-primary-r/2024/national/&quot;>;vast leads in national and key state polls&lt;/a>; and is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2023/09/18/trump-desantis-campaign-iowa-00116452&quot;>;reportedly&lt;/a>; planning to attack DeSantis in Iowa, the first state to vote, in an attempt to kill off his flatlining campaign.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wolff, once a Guardian columnist, achieved global fame with three tell-all books on the Trump presidency, starting in January 2018 with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jan/03/donald-trump-russia-steve-bannon-michael-wolff&quot;>;Fire and Fury&lt;/a>; and ending in 2021 with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/jul/12/landslide-review-michael-wolff-donald-trump-book-&quot;>;Landslide&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But he is also the author of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/28/books/review/Carr-t.html&quot;>;The Man Who Owns the News&lt;/a>;: Inside the Secret World of Rupert Murdoch. Now, in the introduction to The Fall, he says he may be “the journalist not in his employ who knows [Murdoch] best”.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;His new volume, Wolff writes, is based on “conversations specifically for this book, and other conversations that have taken place over many years, and on scenes and events that I have personally witnessed or that I have recreated with the help of participants in them”.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The scene in St Barts is described in terms that seem to indicate sources among those present.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Then soon to turn 91, Murdoch was “full-time on the job running the Fox News cable channel, its sister Fox Broadcasting Company, the television stations he owned across the country, newspapers in the US, Britain and Australia, and the book publisher HarperCollins”, writes Wolff, in the book published in the US by Henry Holt.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Describing tension between Hall and Murdoch – in a marriage that would &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/aug/12/jerry-hall-and-rupert-murdoch-finalise-divorce&quot;>;end&lt;/a>; in August 2022 – Wolff says Murdoch was sitting with “a few friends – really, his wife&#39;s friends … at the patio table”.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Murdoch, Wolff writes, “seemed to have just gotten off the phone” and to be continuing a conversation or train of thought.

Scientifically, it can&#39;t be stored forever, but anything less than 100 years is too little in the context of the climate crisis.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Non-additional – the project would have happened anyway, with or without the VCM – and doesn&#39;t lead to additional emission cuts. Common in large renewable projects.&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;4. Strong evidence of at least one failing means the promised emission reductions can not be guaranteed and should be presumed junk. Some evidence of at least one failing means the project is problematic and is potentially junk as it cannot guarantee the advertised emission cuts.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;5.

He said all leaders “who do not tolerate any aggression” would be invited to a peace summit. He did not say when or where the meeting would be held, but he has previously expressed the hope it would happen by autumn this year.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zelenskiy, dressed in an olive green long-sleeved polo shirt, used the word “genocide” to refer to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/17/vladimir-putin-war-crimes-icc-arrest-warrant-ukraine-children&quot;>;the abduction of tens of thousands of Ukrainian children by Russian occupation authorities&lt;/a>;, who the Ukrainian president said were being brainwashed into hating their homeland.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Never before has mass kidnapping and deportation become a part of the government policy.

If the Russians succeeded, he warned, “many seats in the general assembly hall may become empty”.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He said the Ukrainian peace blueprint, which involves a Russian withdrawal from Ukrainian territory, accountability for war crimes and restitution for damages, represented “a real chance to end aggression on the terms of the nation which was attacked”.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zelenskiy added: “While Russia is pushing the world to a final war, Ukraine is doing everything to ensure that after this Russian aggression, no one in the world will dare to attack any nation.”&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 20 Sep 2023 04:52:01 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[UK could become an ‘EU lite’ member of bloc, suggests Franco-German report]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/sep/19/uk-could-become-an-eu-lite-member-of-bloc-suggests-franco-german-report]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-19T19:48:46Z&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/755be034ed23c51e475b66e84cf91f7364e92430/0_338_5343_3206/master/5343.jpg?w=600&amp;fit=bounds&amp;sig-ignores-params=true&amp;s=c1f32b26670b1c3a5a0965463db3c904&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;>;A committee session at the European Parliament in Brussels.&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;A vision of a future EU with four types of membership – including an “EU lite” for countries such as the UK – has been tabled by a group of academics commissioned by France and Germany to consider future reforms.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The proposal comes as the UK&#39;s opposition leader, Keir Starmer, told France&#39;s president, Emmanuel Macron, that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/sep/19/keir-starmer-wraps-up-foreign-mini-tour-with-visit-to-emmanuel-macron-in-paris&quot;>;he wanted to build an “even stronger” relationship between the two countries&lt;/a>; if he wins power at a national election pencilled in for next year.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;With the Ukraine war accelerating the appetite for enlargement, the EU leadership has acknowledged the urgent need to start thinking about the shape of the bloc, which could increase from 27 members to as many as 36 countries.&lt;/p>; &lt;aside>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Related: &lt;/span>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/sep/19/keir-starmer-europe-talk-new-brexit-deal-labour-leader-emmanuel-macron-eu&quot;>;Daring or delusional?
