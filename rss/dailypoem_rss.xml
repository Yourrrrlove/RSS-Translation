After cutting the candlesticks many times, it&#39;s almost midnight. &lt;br />;The shadow of the moon between the sycamore trees outside the window is mottled on the cold bed mat, but the moon seen from the sycamore trees is still so bright. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Notes&lt;br />;&lt;/strong>;Autumn air: refers to the desolate and chilling air of autumn. &lt;br />;Candleflower: The flower-like object formed by burning the wick of a candle. &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;Appreciation&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;p>; The first two sentences are narrative. The first sentence goes straight to the title of the poem, with the words &quot;night&quot; and &quot;autumn&quot; dotted between them, explaining the time, mentality, and environment. &quot;Long sleepless nights&quot; have already seen the resentful woman full of sorrow, and now it is autumn. The autumn wind is bleak, the night air is cool, the brocade quilt is thin, and the beautiful lady cannot sleep at night, adding a layer of sorrow. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The second sentence follows &quot;Sleepless&quot; and writes about personnel activities. Since it is difficult to fall asleep after tossing and turning, it is difficult to pass the long night. The empty room was lonely, the red candles were burning high, and she was bored, so she had no choice but to cut candle flowers to relieve her loneliness. &quot;Candleflower&quot; refers to lanterns. The ancients believed that lanterns were a sign of happy events. Du Fu&#39;s poem says: &quot;How can we be so happy with the lights and flowers? The wine and greenery are the perfect match&quot; (&quot;Drinking Alone into a Poetry&quot;). The lanterns and lights were pleasing to the eye, but she couldn&#39;t resolve the gloomy and painful mood in front of her. The word &quot;frequency&quot; is used to describe the heroine&#39;s anxiety and uneasiness. &quot;The third watch of desire&quot; continues the word &quot;Yejiu&quot;, which expresses the suffering of loneliness and loneliness of the missing woman. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The last two sentences describe the scene. The third sentence makes a twist, writing about the moon shadow on the bed. One &quot;cool&quot; is unique, which is the poetic eye of the whole poem. It echoes the &quot;clear autumn air&quot; in the first sentence and writes the visual image in a tactile state. The shadow of the dancing moon filtered through the cracks of the plane trees outside the window was mottled and covered with cold, empty bed mats. No one would bring her warmth tonight. This scene is heart-wrenching. On the surface, the word &quot;man&quot; refers to the density of light and shadow, but in fact, it refers to the feeling of being full of worries and depressing things. This sentence clearly expresses the sadness and beauty of the moonlight in the house, and implicitly expresses the loss of people&#39;s hearts. The virtual and the real are intertwined, and the charm is far-reaching. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The last sentence writes about the moon outside the window and ends with a scene language, leaving the reader with endless space for imagination. This sentence is a continuation of the previous sentence, with a true transition from the moonlight and tree shadows on the bed to the bright moon in the sky, expressing the poet&#39;s sudden joy and worry when looking at the moon and cherishing people. &quot;The moon shines brightly in the missing part of the phoenix tree&quot;, showing a lofty and sparse picture of the moonlight on an autumn night. Under the bright moonlight, she seems to have recalled the sweetness and romance of the past when &quot;the willow trees were above the moon, and people made appointments after dusk&quot;; but now, at the moment of &quot;losing weight for another night&quot;, no one can &quot;cut the hair together&quot; with her. Window Candle&quot;. I want to be detached but cannot. The brightness of the &quot;moon&quot; just illuminates the indelible gloom deep in the human heart. &quot;The missing part of the sycamore tree&quot;, the freeze-frame of this background image, implies the sorrow of the missing woman who cannot be reunited with the person she loves. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The whole poem is in order, starting from the outside (the autumn air is clear) to the inside (the candles are frequently cut), and then from the inside (the bed is cool) to the outside (the moon is bright in the missing place), layer by layer. Repeatedly exaggerating the depression of being alone. The stitches are fine, the four sentences are closely connected, and the connection is smooth. There is no word &quot;love&quot; and there is no emotion anywhere. The imagery is clear and prominent, the artistic conception is empty and quiet, and the details are concise and vivid, giving people endless aftertaste. &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;About the author&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;div>;&lt;center>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://song.gushiwen.cn/authorImg/zhushuzhen.jpg&quot; width=50 %>;&lt;/center>;&lt;/div>;Zhu Shuzhen (about 1135~about 1180), also known as Youqi Jushi, was a female poet in the Song Dynasty and one of the female writers with the richest surviving works since the Tang and Song Dynasties.
