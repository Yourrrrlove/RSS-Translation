Go up to Xie Tiao Tower and overlook the clear sky. &lt;br />;Between the two rivers, a pool of lake water is like a bright mirror; Phoenix Bridge and Jichuan Bridge are like rainbows falling into the world. &lt;br />;The thin cold smoke rising from the villages lingers among the oranges and pomelos. In late autumn, the sycamore trees are already withered and yellow. &lt;br />;Who else but me would think of coming to Xie Tiao North Tower, facing the bleak autumn wind, and missing Mr. Xie? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Notes&lt;/strong>;&lt;br />;Xie Tiao North Tower: Xie Tiao Tower was built by the Qi poet Xie Tiao in the Southern Dynasty when he was the prefect of Xuancheng. of tourist attractions. Xie Tiao is a poet whom Li Bai admires very much. &lt;br />;Jiangcheng: generally refers to the city by the water, here it refers to Xuancheng. In the dialect of the Jiangnan area in the Tang Dynasty, both large and small rivers were called &quot;jiang&quot;. &lt;br />;Two waters: refers to Wanxi and Juxi. There is Phoenix Bridge on Wanxi River and Jichuan Bridge on Juxi River. &lt;br />;Dingjing: refers to the circular shape formed by the arch bridge hole and its reflection in the water, like a bright mirror. &lt;br />;Shuangqiao: refers to Phoenix Bridge and Jichuan Bridge, built during the reign of Emperor Kaihuang of the Sui Dynasty (the reign of Emperor Wen of the Sui Dynasty, 581-600 AD). &lt;br />;Rainbow: refers to the shadow of the bridge in the water. &lt;br />;Human smoke: smoke from people’s homes. &lt;br />;North Tower: namely Xie Tiao Tower. &lt;br />;Xie Gong: Xie Tiao. &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;Appreciation&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;p>; The Xie Zao North Tower was built by the Southern Qi poet Xie Zao when he was the prefect of Xuancheng. A tourist attraction in Xuancheng. Xuancheng is surrounded by mountains and rivers. Lingyang has winding hills and three tall peaks. The streams of Juxi and Wanxi reflect the whole suburb. It is really like &quot;when birds go and birds come back, in the mountains, people sing and people cry.&quot; &quot;In the sound&quot; (Du Mu&#39;s &quot;Inscribed on the Water Pavilion of Kaiyuan Temple in Xuanzhou, a resident of Wanxi River Jiaxi&quot;). This poem was written in the thirteenth year of Tianbao (754). After the Mid-Autumn Festival of this year, Li Bai came to Xuancheng again from Jinling. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;The river city is like a painting, and the mountains look at the clear sky at night.&quot; The first couplet says that the city by the river is as beautiful as in the painting. One clear autumn evening, the poet climbed up to Xie Gong Tower alone. The shadow of Languang Mountain is so clear! Looking down from a height, this &quot;River City&quot; looks like it is in a painting. In the first two sentences, the poet summarizes the scenery he saw when he visited, and takes the entire article, which immediately attracts the reader deeply and enters the artistic conception of the poem. This is Li Bai&#39;s commonly used &quot;getting to the point&quot; expression technique. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;Two rivers hold a bright mirror, and two bridges hold a rainbow.&quot; The couplet means that between the two rivers, a lake is like a bright mirror; the two bridges on the river are like rainbows falling from the sky. &quot;Two waters&quot; refers to Juxi and Wanxi. Wanxi originates from Yishan Mountain, meets Juxi in the northeast of Xuancheng, and merges around the city, so it is called &quot;clip&quot;. Because it is autumn, the stream is clearer and flows calmly, with crystal light shining on the surface of the waves. &quot;Dingjing&quot; is the most appropriate way to describe it. &quot;Double Bridge&quot; refers to the upper and lower bridges across the stream. The upper bridge is called Fenghuang Bridge, outside Taihe Gate in the southeast of the city; the lower bridge is called Jichuan Bridge, outside Yangde Gate in the east of the city. They are both buildings built during the Kaihuang Period (581-600) of Emperor Wen of the Sui Dynasty. These two long bridges are built over the stream, reflecting in the water. Looking from a distance from a high-rise building, the clear stream water and the bright red sunset are reflected in the bright and dim light, and the shadows of the bridges reflect infinite and strange bright colors. Where is the bridge here? They are simply two rainbows in the sky, and the shadow of this &quot;rainbow&quot; falls into the &quot;mirror&quot;. Here the poet&#39;s imagination is rich and wonderful, and his writing is lively and ethereal, which is once again amazing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;The orange and pomelo trees are cold among the people, but the old sycamore trees look beautiful in autumn.&quot; The neck couplet says that the tangerine and pomelo trees are hidden in the chilling smoke; the autumn colors are vast, and the sycamore trees also look old. In the evening of autumn, the wilderness is quiet, and wisps of cooking smoke emerge from the jungles on the hills. The deep green of the oranges and pomeloes and the faint yellow of the sycamores present a cold scene, making people feel that it is time for the autumn light to grow old. . It is not difficult for us to imagine that the poet&#39;s mood at that time was completely immersed in his vision, his observations were profound and meticulous, and his descriptions were not sticky. He stood high, looked far, captured the feeling of the moment, and used extremely concise language to outline the outline of a late autumn with random touches, deeply revealing the atmosphere of the season and environment. It not only writes the autumn scenery, but also writes the autumn mood. If we understand it carefully, we will find that it is highly summarized and is very precise. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The two middle couplets are specific descriptions. The artistic images created in these four lines of poetry are all derived from the word &quot;wang&quot; in the first couplet. From the structural relationship point of view, the first two sentences say &quot;the river city is picturesque&quot; and the next two sentences say &quot;the mountains are clear at night&quot;; the four sentences are a complete unity, but they are layered. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;Whoever misses Mr. Xie in the North Tower will miss Mr. Xie in the wind.&quot; The last couplet means, who else but me would think of coming to Xie Tiao&#39;s North Tower, facing the bleak autumn wind, to miss Mr. Xie? ? These last two sentences seem very simple on the surface. They just echo the first two sentences and indicate that the place to visit is in the North Tower. This North Tower was built by Xie Zao. From the visit to the nostalgia, It seems to be the usual formula, so Li Bai couldn&#39;t help but say something in memory of the ancients. What is worth noting here is the word &quot;who reads&quot;. The &quot;Huai&quot; in &quot;Huai Xie Gong&quot; refers to the author himself; the &quot;Nian&quot; in &quot;Who Nian&quot; refers to others. The meaning of the two sentences is that no one can understand the feeling of lamenting that one is &quot;feeling grateful to the father in the face of the wind&quot;. This is no ordinary nostalgia. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; After Li Bai was politically marginalized by the powerful and abandoned his official position, he was politically frustrated and lived a wandering life. The depression and sentimentality among the guests, especially when the autumn wind is blowing, can be imagined. Xuancheng is his old travel place, and now he is here again. As soon as he arrived in Xuancheng, he would miss Xie Zhen. This was not only because Xie Zhen left behind such historical sites as Diezhang Tower in Xuancheng, but more importantly, Xie Zhen had the same feelings towards Xuancheng as he did. When Li Bai was alone on Xie Zhen&#39;s tower, facing the mountains and rivers that Xie Zhen had admired, he remembered the tragic life of this poet of the previous generation whom he had always admired. Although ancient and modern times are different, the spirit of their cultural genes But they are far apart. This confused mood reflects his political depression and loneliness; precisely because he was politically suppressed and could not find a way out, he had no choice but to devote himself to the mountains and rivers and to be friends with the ancients. Who could understand his complicated feelings at that time? &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;Creative background&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>; The specific creation time of this poem is unknown, but it should be similar to &quot;Farewell to the School Secretary Shu Yun at Xietiao Tower in Xuanzhou&quot;, shortly before the Anshi Rebellion broke out. Li Bai came to Xuancheng twice in the autumn of 753 AD (the twelfth year of Tianbao) and 754 AD (the thirteenth year of Tianbao). This poem is considered to be after the Mid-Autumn Festival in 753 or 754 AD. &lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;About the author&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;div>;&lt;center>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://song.gushiwen.cn/authorImg/libai.jpg&quot; width=50%>;&lt;/ center>;&lt;/div>;Li Bai (701-762), also known as Taibai, also known as Qinglian Jushi, also known as &quot;Exiled Immortal&quot;, was a great romantic poet in the Tang Dynasty. He was hailed as the &quot;Poetry Immortal&quot; by later generations, and was the same as Du Fu They are collectively known as &quot;Li Du&quot;. In order to distinguish them from the other two poets Li Shangyin and Du Mu, who are known as &quot;Little Li Du&quot;, Du Fu and Li Bai are also collectively known as &quot;Big Li Du&quot;. According to the &quot;New Book of Tang&quot; records, Li Bai was the ninth grandson of Emperor Xingsheng (Liang Wuzhao King Li Hao) and the same clan as the kings of Li and Tang Dynasties. He is a cheerful and generous person who loves drinking, writing poetry, and making friends. Li Bai was deeply influenced by Huang Lao Liezhuang&#39;s thoughts. The &quot;Collection of Li Taibai&quot; has been handed down from generation to generation. Most of his poems were written when he was drunk. His representative works include &quot;Looking at Lushan Waterfall&quot;, &quot;The Road is Difficult&quot;, &quot;The Road to Shu is Difficult&quot;, &quot;About Drinking&quot; and &quot;Early Morning&quot;. &quot;Fa Baidi City&quot; and so on. &lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 17 Sep 2023 04:23:05 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[江南曲 | 李益]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://feedx.net/read?r=shiwen&d=239162]]><description> &lt;h2>;Jiangnan Song&lt;/h2>;[Tang Dynasty] Li Yi&lt;div style=&quot;color: #5b4636;&quot;>;married to Qutang Jia, but he missed the date of his concubine. &lt;br />;If you had known the trend and had faith, you would have married into the trend. &lt;/div>;&lt;h3>;Translation and annotations&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Translation&lt;/strong>;&lt;br />;I really regret marrying a businessman in Qutang,&lt;br />;He would meet me every day The best time was delayed. &lt;br />;If I had known the ebb and flow of the tide and had been so trustworthy,&lt;br />;it would have been better to marry a husband who was into the tide. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Notes&lt;/strong>;&lt;br />;Jiangnan Song: the name of an ancient song. Title of Yuefu&#39;s &quot;Xianghege&quot;. This is a Yuefu song, written very much like a folk song. &lt;br />;Qutang Jia: a businessman doing business in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. Qutang: refers to Qutang Gorge, one of the Three Gorges of the Yangtze River. Jia: Businessman. &lt;br />;Concubine: A modest word for an ancient woman to call herself. &lt;br />;Chao Youxin: The tide rises and falls within a certain period of time, which is called &quot;Chao Xin&quot;. &lt;br />;Tidal wavers: people who play in the water when the tide rises, or people who take boats into the river when the tide comes. &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;Appreciation&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;p>; This poem draws on the strengths of Yuefu folk songs. The language is as clear as words, but it is also thought-provoking. The poem uses line drawing to describe the thoughts of a business woman. The first two lines of the poem are known for their plainness, while the last two lines are astonishing: &quot;If I had known the tide and had faith, I would have married into the tide.&quot; The husband has no faith, but the tide has faith. If I had known this, I should have married the man who makes the tide. The &quot;tide waver&quot; will at least follow the trend of Youxin and come on time, so that he will not miss the date of his concubine! This is the fantasy that the missing woman came up with in all kinds of helplessness. The two words &quot;I knew it&quot; describe the depth of her resentment, and she couldn&#39;t help but hurt herself and regretted her past. &quot;Marrying and being a trendy boy&quot; is both a silly saying and a bitter saying. It describes the mental state of missing a woman and being extremely resentful. Although it is a fantasy, it is from the heart. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; This poem is written naturally, but its internal logic is very strict. The missing wife&#39;s husband &quot;comes to court&quot; and breaks his promise, but thinks that the tide &quot;comes to him&quot; and trusts him, which in turn creates regret for marrying someone who is not a human being. It delicately demonstrates the inner contradiction of hope and resentment, and resentment and regret. The whole poem is emotionally sincere and has a strong flavor of folk songs. &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;Creative background&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>; In the Tang Dynasty, a large number of poems with the theme of feud between women appeared. These poems mainly have two main contents: one is about missing the husband, and the other is about missing the husband. It&#39;s a blame businessman. Li Yi&#39;s &quot;Jiangnan Song&quot; belongs to this type of poem about boudoir. &lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;Evaluation&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;p>; In &quot;Wrinkle Water Xuan Ci Quan&quot;, He Shang believes that Li Yi&#39;s poem is similar to &quot;Shen Hate Xixi&quot; in Zhang Xian&#39;s &quot;A Cluster of Flowers&quot; &quot;Thinking, not as good as peaches and apricots, is like marrying the east wind&quot; are all &quot;unreasonable but wonderful&quot;. Zhong Xing commented on this poem in &quot;Return of Tang Poems&quot; and said: &quot;It&#39;s a ridiculous thought, but the resentment is real.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Huang Shucan said in &quot;Notes on Tang Poems&quot;: &quot;I don&#39;t know how to get this idea. I am eager to speak. I know that &quot;Zheng Feng&quot; &quot;If you don&#39;t think about me, how can there be no one else&quot;, which is the ultimate expression of resentment.&quot;&lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;About the author&lt;/h3>;&lt;p >;&lt;div>;&lt;center>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://song.gushiwen.cn/authorImg/liyi.jpg&quot; width=50%>;&lt;/center>;&lt;/div>;Li Yi (about 750-about 830) , a poet of the Tang Dynasty, with the courtesy name Junyu, his ancestral home is Guzang, Liangzhou (now Liangzhou District, Wuwei City, Gansu), and later moved to Zhengzhou, Henan.
