Chen Zican, his brother from Beiping Province, came to Henan Province and met General Song&#39;s family. In the Song Dynasty, he was a native of Qinghua Town, Huaiqing. He was good at martial arts. All the good people from the seven provinces came to learn martial arts. People praised him as a general of the Song Dynasty because of his strength. Gao Xinzhi, a disciple of the Song Dynasty, was also a native of Huaiqing. He was very powerful and good at shooting. His eldest son Can was seven years old and he was a junior classmate, so he had some experience with the Song general. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;At that time, there was a healthy guest sitting in the seat. He looked very sleepy and had a large iron vertebra on his right side, weighing forty or fifty kilograms. The iron handle is folded and the ring is folded, like a lock, and the lead is about ten feet long. He rarely talks to others, and his language is similar to Chu&#39;s. I asked him about his hometown and surname, but he didn&#39;t answer. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>; After we slept together, at midnight, the guest said, &quot;I&#39;m leaving!&quot; After saying that, he disappeared. When Zi Can saw that the windows were all closed, he was surprised and asked Xin Zhi. Xinzhi said: &quot;When the guest arrived for the first time, he had no hat or socks. He wrapped his head in a blue handkerchief and wrapped his feet in white cloth. He held nothing except the big iron spine, and his waist was full of platinum. Neither I nor the general dared to ask.&quot; Zican When I wake up from a deep sleep, the guest is snoring and sleeping on the kang. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;One day, he resigned from the Song Dynasty general and said: &quot;I heard your name for the first time and felt proud of it, but it is of no use. I&#39;m leaving!&quot; The general forced him to stay, and said: &quot;I will kill the horse thieves several times. , seize their belongings, so you hate me. If you stay here for a long time, disaster will happen to you. At midnight tonight, I will duel at a certain place.&quot; General Song happily said: &quot;I ride on horseback and carry arrows to help the battle.&quot; The guest said: &quot;Stop! The thieves can and there are many. , I want to protect you, but I am not happy with my wishes.&quot; General Song was so conceited and wanted to observe what the guests did, so he tried his best to entertain the guests. The guest has no choice but to go with me. When they were about to arrive at the battle, they sent the general to the castle and said, &quot;Just watch and be careful not to make any noise, so that the thieves will know.&quot;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;At that time, the rooster crows and the moon sets, the stars illuminate the wilderness, and people can be seen at a hundred paces. As the guests drove off, they blew several whistles. In a moment, more than twenty thieves on horseback gathered on all sides, and hundreds of followers on foot, carrying bows and arrows. A thief rushed towards the guest with a knife. The guest shouted and waved his spine. The thief fell off his horse and his horse&#39;s head was split open. The thieves circled in and attacked from left and right. The men and horses fell to the ground, killing about thirty people. The general of Song Dynasty held his breath and looked at it with tremors in his chest. Suddenly I heard the guest shouting: &quot;I&#39;m leaving.&quot; The dust was billowing and galloping eastward. Then he never came again. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>; Wei Xi said: The most powerful person in the ovary is the emperor of Qin Dynasty, Bolang Shazhong. Who is the big iron spine? Those who are born strange must be put to some use. I read Chen Tongfu&#39;s &quot;Zhongxing Inheritance&quot; and found out how many heroes, heroes, heroes, and heroes have never seen their fame in the world! How can it be that the creatures of heaven do not need to be used by humans? Is it better to use it naturally? Zican met Da Tiezhui when he was Renyin years old. He thought he was thirty years old, but Da Tiezhui had forty ears this year. Zican also saw him writing posts about market things, and he was very skilled in regular script. &lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;h3>;Translation and annotations&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Translation&lt;br />;&lt;/strong>; In November of the Gengxu year, I returned home from Yangzhou and met Chen Zican Same boat. Zican was twenty-eight years old at the time and liked to use guns and sticks. When I was teaching him the art of war in Zuo Zhuan, I took the opportunity to ask: &quot;Have you ever met any strange people in your travels?&quot; Zican asked me. After telling about the story of Da Tiezhui, I wrote &quot;The Legend of Da Tiezhui&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Big iron spine, I don’t know where he is from. Chen Zican from Peiping went to Henan to visit his brother and met Da Tiezhui at the home of General Song. General Song is a native of Qinghua Town, Huaiqing. He is good at martial arts. People who love martial arts from seven provinces come to learn from him. People call him General Song because he is tall and strong. General Song&#39;s apprentice Gao Xinzhi was also from Huaiqing. He was strong and good at archery. He was seven years older than Chen Zican and was his classmate when he was a child. Therefore, Chen Zican once visited General Song with him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; At that time, there was a guest with a big appetite. He was very ugly. He had a large iron vertebra under his right arm, weighing forty or fifty kilograms. He would not put it down for a moment while eating or bowing his hands. . The iron chain on the handle of the big iron vertebra is folded around, like a chain on a lock, and it is stretched over a foot long. He rarely talked to people, and his accent sounded like that of Chu Di (now Hubei, Hunan). I asked him where his hometown was and what his name was, but he didn&#39;t answer. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; We slept together, and in the middle of the night, the guest said, &quot;I&#39;m leaving.&quot; As soon as he finished speaking, the person disappeared. When Chen Zican saw that the windows and doors were closed, he asked Gao Xinzhi in surprise. Gao Xinzhi said: &quot;When the guest first arrived, he didn&#39;t wear a hat or socks, wrapped his head in a blue handkerchief, and wrapped his feet in white cloth. He didn&#39;t carry anything except a large iron spine, and there was a lot of silver wrapped in his belt. . Neither General Song nor I dared to ask him.&quot; When Chen Zican woke up, the knight was already snoring in bed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One day, the knight said goodbye to General Song: &quot;When I first heard about your reputation, I regarded you as a hero. However, your martial arts are of no use. I left.&quot; General Song Trying his best to retain him, he said: &quot;I have repeatedly killed the robbers who blocked the road and seized their property, so they hate me. If I stay here for a long time, disaster will involve you. At midnight tonight, the robbers are making an agreement Come with me to a duel somewhere.&quot; General Song said happily: &quot;I am riding a horse with a bow and arrow to help fight.&quot; The knight said: &quot;Don&#39;t go, the robbers are strong and there are many people. If I want to protect you, I can&#39;t Let&#39;s kill him with all his heart.&quot; General Song always thought he was a great person, and also wanted to see the knight&#39;s skills, so he tried his best to ask the knight to come with him. The knight had no choice but to take him with him. When they were about to arrive at the duel, the knight escorted General Song to a deserted fortress and said, &quot;You can only watch and be silent, lest the robbers discover you.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; At this time, the rooster crows, the moon sets, the stars illuminate the open field, and people can be seen within a hundred steps. The knight galloped down on horseback and blew several whistles. After a while, more than twenty bandits on horseback gathered from all sides, followed by more than a hundred people walking on foot carrying bows and arrows. A robber rushed towards the knight with a knife on his horse. The knight shouted: &quot;Look at the spine.&quot; He waved the iron spine, and the robber fell off the horse, and the horse&#39;s head was smashed into pieces. The group of robbers moved forward to surround them. The knights swung their iron spines and struck left and right. The robbers fell to the ground, including men and horses, and more than thirty people were killed. General Song held his breath while watching this fierce battle. His legs were shaking with fear and he almost fell off the fortress. Suddenly, I heard the knight shout loudly: &quot;I&#39;m leaving!&quot; The dust was billowing and he flew towards the east. He never came back after that. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Wei Xi commented: Zhang Liang found a strong man and used an iron vertebrae to beat Qin Shihuang at Bolangsha. Is the big iron vertebrae probably the same kind of person? If someone is born with extraordinary talents, there must be a place where they can be used. But when I read Chen Liang&#39;s &quot;Zhongxing Inheritance&quot;, I found that there are so many people with outstanding intelligence, chivalrous spirit, and majesty who are silently unable to show their achievements and reputation in the contemporary era. Why are there so many of them? Is it true that talents born from heaven may not necessarily be appointed by others? Or will there be a certain opportunity for them to be appointed? Chen Zican met Da Tiezhui in the Renyin year. Judging from his appearance, he should be thirty years old, so Da Tiezhui was already forty years old at that time. Zican once saw him writing a shopping list. His regular script was very neat and beautiful. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Notes&lt;br />;&lt;/strong>;The Biography of Da Tiezhui: Selected from &quot;Wen Shuzi Wenchao&quot;, with some abridgements.

His &quot;Zhongxing Inheritance&quot; is a biography of ministers, generals, dead men, capable ministers, and able figures before and after the Song Dynasty&#39;s southern crossing. Among them, there are two categories: chivalrous and righteous. The characters are similar to big iron spines, so it is said that, To elicit the following sentiments. &lt;br />;泳泯(mǐn): to describe the disappearance of one after another. &lt;br />;Renyinsui: year (the first year of Kangxi). &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;Creative background&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;p>; In the late Ming and early Qing dynasties, the creation of biographical essays showed a boom. The reason for this was to praise the loyal and martyrs. , are inseparable from the concept of preserving history through literature, so it has a distinct and complex connotation of the times. It is a concrete manifestation of the complex thoughts of scholars in the early Qing Dynasty (especially the survivors of the Ming Dynasty), of which Wei Xi is a model. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Wei Xi was the head of the famous literary group &quot;Nine Sons of Yitang&quot; in the early Qing Dynasty. He was famous all over the world for his articles on integrity and was one of the three masters of ancient prose in the early Qing Dynasty. Throughout Wei Xizhi&#39;s ancient prose creation, biographical prose is a very important component. Examining his biographical writings, we can see the complex spiritual trajectory of scholars in the early Qing Dynasty, and we can also interpret the cultural connotations and aesthetic pursuits of the articles in the early Qing Dynasty. Among such biographies, the most widely praised is undoubtedly &quot;The Legend of Da Tiezhui&quot;, which created the image of a legendary &quot;outlander&quot; with superb skills, strange behavior and legendary color. &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;Appreciation&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;p>;&amp;nbsp; Because the author did not know the name of the man, he used his weapon &quot;Big Iron Vertebral&quot; instead. In a delicate and vivid way, the article depicts the &quot;stranger&quot; image of a strong man who is knowledgeable, upright, skilled in martial arts, literate, and capable of using iron vertebrae. It depicts such a heroic figure who could have accomplished a lot at that time. However, he encountered mismatches and had no place to use his skills. He could only fight the thieves in a sad situation. It revealed the author&#39;s dissatisfaction with the rulers and ministers of the Ming Dynasty&#39;s subjugation, expressed his pain of the subjugation, and expressed the author&#39;s hope that someone would rise up to &quot;resist the Qing Dynasty and restore the Ming Dynasty.&quot; Patriotic thoughts. &lt;br />;&lt;br />; &quot;The Legend of Da Tiezhui&quot; belongs to the author&#39;s so-called biography of &quot;the commoner lone traveler&quot;. Iron vertebra (chuí), ancient weapon. It is said that the name of the master is unknown, he is very brave, and he is named after his weapons. The main part of the biography adopts the perspective of a specific character in the biography, describing the biography&#39;s unusual appearance, mysterious actions, and fighting scenes, vividly portraying the image of a heroic figure invisible to the people, like a dragon that sees its head but not its tail. The concluding remarks also leave endless meaning. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The article is a legendary biography. The author is good at raising doubts, making it fascinating to read. But until the end of the article, we only knew that the protagonist was a man with special skills. As for why he came to see General Song, and why he later said that General Song was &quot;not useful&quot;, he was kept secretive. It can be seen from this that the author had some hope in writing this character. General Song set off Da Tiezhu&#39;s character. &quot;General Song&quot; also alluded to those silent old officials of the Ming Dynasty at that time, who had only a false reputation and lacked the courage and strength to resist. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The language of the biography is very concise, but readers can still feel the hero&#39;s bold and deep character from the appearance, language, actions and other aspects. Da Tiezhui came to visit General Song in order to make friends with real heroes who can do great things. After he carefully observed and discovered that General Song&#39;s martial arts were mediocre and lacked courage, he decisively concluded that &quot;none of them were of any use&quot; and decided to leave. This was a side of his deep character. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The part about the starry night duel is the most exciting part of the whole article. Write the environment: the cock crows, the moon sets, and the stars illuminate the wilderness, highlighting the solemn atmosphere of the duel. The large number of people who wrote, the abundance of weapons, the massed steps, and the huge momentum further highlighted the bravery of the &quot;big iron spine&quot;. As for General Song, who was a &quot;skilled martial artist&quot; with a false reputation and was quite conceited, he was watching from the sidelines. He was so frightened that he didn&#39;t dare to breathe. His legs were trembling and he almost fell down. This description further highlights the extraordinary bravery of the &quot;Big Iron Vertebrae&quot; from the side. The front depicts him striking with all his strength, with men and horses falling on the ground on all sides. With just a few strokes, his extraordinary power, superb martial arts, and heroic character are vividly portrayed. &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;About the author&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;div>;&lt;center>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://song.gushiwen.cn/authorImg/weixi.jpg&quot; width=50 %>;&lt;/center>;&lt;/div>;Wei Xi (March 2, 1624 - November 17, 1680) was a prose writer in the late Ming and early Qing Dynasties.
