Only then did the floods get under control, and people all over the world returned to a peaceful life where men farmed and women weaved. &lt;br />;Although the water damage was eliminated, the disaster of wind and sand remained. &lt;br />;In ancient times, there was a crazy man. He rushed out early in the morning with disheveled hair to cross the river on foot. &lt;br />;Others just watched the excitement, and only his wife went to stop him, shouting from behind to ask him not to cross the river, but he insisted on jumping into the river. &lt;br />;Although the tiger can be restrained, the river cannot be crossed. As expected, the madman was drowned in the water, and his body drifted with the current to the sea. &lt;br />;Being swallowed by the long whale with white teeth like mountains. &lt;br />;The wife played the harp and sang tragic songs. Unfortunately, her husband never came back. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Notes&lt;/strong>;&lt;br />;Kunlun: Kunlun Mountain. &lt;br />;Longmen: Longmen Mountain is located fifty miles northeast of Hancheng, Shaanxi Province, with the Yellow River flowing through it. &lt;br />;Li: that is, governance. People in the Tang Dynasty avoided the taboo of Emperor Gaozong of the Tang Dynasty and changed &quot;governance&quot; to &quot;li&quot;. &lt;br />;Peering into the home: Dayu went out to control floods for eight years, but failed to enter his home three times. &lt;br />;Wind and sand, this sentence means that although the water will not cause monstrous disasters, it will still be harmed by wind and sand. &lt;br />;By: Crossing the river on foot. &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;Appreciation&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;p>; At the beginning of Li Bai&#39;s poem &quot;The Public Does Not Cross the River&quot;, he extends his huge pen to the vast and distant past - &quot;The Yellow River comes west to decide... Kunlun, roaring for thousands of miles, touches the dragon gate!” The poem uses words of sudden exclamation to describe how it instantly clashed with the Kunlun Mountains, a symbol of power and momentum that spans the sky and the earth; then with a thunderous &quot;roar&quot;, it hit the &quot;Dragon Gate&quot; &quot;thousands of miles away&quot; (Today&#39;s northwest of Hejin County, Shanxi). With only two strokes, the poet showed the infinite prestige of the Yellow River &quot;coming from the west&quot; amidst the vibrations of &quot;Kunlun&quot; and &quot;Longmen&quot;. &quot;The waves surged into the sky, and Yao Zhi groaned&quot;! The huge waves swallowed up countless living people, and the vast wilderness of ancient times was suddenly filled with the awe-inspiring sighs of Emperor Yao Fangxun: Because the poem uses short sentences of three words, the sigh sounds more passionate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Then, &quot;Dayu&quot; appeared. The myth and legend of Dayu&#39;s flood control could have inspired many strange thoughts in poets. However, this section focuses on describing the Yellow River, so the poem only uses four lines of &quot;Dayu managed all the rivers&quot; to show how the unruly and violent floods were tamed under the feet of this hero. However, in the close scene of &quot;killing the flood&quot;, the poet added a few words of &quot;son of Yu&quot; &quot;son cry&quot;, &quot;son cries but does not return home&quot;, just five words make a man forget his own selfishness and &quot;three faults&quot;. The heroic demeanor of flood control &quot;without entering the house&quot; emerges vividly from this. The ancient harm of the Yellow River has since been eliminated, but when its waves returned in a turbulent way, they left behind &quot;borderless wind and sand&quot; on both sides! The above section starts from the ancient river damage to the relief of monstrous floods. It not only shows the majestic state of the Yellow River in the west &quot;defeating Kunlun&quot; and the east &quot;touching the Dragon Gate&quot;, but also allows readers to appreciate its unique violent and raging nature from its &quot;roaring waves&quot; historical harm. It lays the foundation for what follows. Now, the white-haired old man wants to cross the river &quot;by the river&quot; (wading across the river). Isn&#39;t he afraid of being swallowed up by it? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In the last stanza of the poem, Zheng, with great confusion, calls out to the tragic hero: &quot;The old man who was attacked is crazy and crazy, and he wants to laugh at him in the morning?&quot; This cry seems to be &quot;Crazy man&quot; &quot;My wife suddenly exclaimed! Because the poet immediately introduced the affectionate wife who &quot;others do not hesitate to stop&quot; after the mad husband &quot;comes to love&quot;. As a result, the scene of the whole poem undergoes an astonishing sudden change: amidst the roaring waves, the poet himself disappears, leaving only a shaggy-haired woman mourning and singing in front of him: &quot;Tiger can be fought, but rivers are difficult to rely on.&quot; . The male fruit drowned in the waves of the sea (waterside). There is a long whale with white teeth like a snow mountain, male! Male! Hanging in the middle!&quot; The poem uses exaggerated pen and ink to sing about the drowning of the crazy old man in the waves, and finally writes He killed the whale-toothed ghost as huge as a &quot;snow mountain&quot;. The sight was horrific. What&#39;s more, it is written from the wailing of the mad husband&#39;s wife who &quot;sings to the help of the harp and harp&quot;, and it feels even more tragic that the world is spinning and the earth is spinning, wailing pitifully. The cry of &quot;Gonghu! Gonghu&quot; trembles in the readers&#39; ears, which is really unbearable to listen to. At the end, the poet suddenly changed from a double line to a single line. He seemed to be enveloped in grief and indignation, and could not say anything more, so he threw up his pen and sighed: &quot;The sorrow of Kong Hou is not returned!&quot; The whole poem ends like this. The waves on the cracked bank of the Yellow River are still raging, but the pitiful cries of the &quot;crazy husband&#39;s&quot; wife still overwhelm the waves and echo throughout the world! &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Judging from the description of the Yellow River in the poem, its violent and raging shape, which harms the people, seems to be quite symbolic; as for the &quot;long whale&quot; with &quot;white teeth like snow-capped mountains&quot;, it seems to be something else. Something pointed out. If it is a metaphor for the Anshi Rebellion that was rampant in &quot;Hebei&quot; (such as the poem &quot;Northward Journey&quot;, which uses &quot;running whales across the Yellow River&quot; as a metaphor for the Anlu Mountain rebellion), then the &quot;distribution of hair&quot; of &quot;linliu&quot; and &quot;by the river&quot; Who does &quot;the old man&quot; refer to? Or is this just a tragic song that expresses the &quot;ability&quot; of &quot;The Public Does Not Cross the River&quot; without any other sentiments? It is certain that the story of the &quot;white-headed madman&quot; crossing the river in the ancient song has a stronger tragic color after Li Bai&#39;s re-creation. The &quot;crazy and crazy&quot; old man with disheveled hair seemed to be pursuing something hard. There are traces of poets persistently pursuing their ideals. &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;Creative background&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;p>; The specific year of creation of this poem is difficult to verify. Most people believe that this poem was written before An Lushan&#39;s rebellion, when Li Bai went to Youzhou (Beijing) to conduct detective work at his own expense. Some people also think that it may have been written after King Yong Li Lin was suppressed, when King Yong&#39;s envoy Wei Zichun came with five hundred taels of gold to invite Li Bai down the mountain. &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;About the author&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;div>;&lt;center>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://song.gushiwen.cn/authorImg/libai.jpg&quot; width=50 %>;&lt;/center>;&lt;/div>;Li Bai (701-762), also known as Taibai, also known as Qinglian Jushi, also known as &quot;The Exiled Immortal&quot;, was a great romantic poet in the Tang Dynasty and was hailed as the &quot;Poetry Immortal&quot; by later generations. &quot;, together with Du Fu are called &quot;Li Du&quot;. In order to distinguish them from the other two poets Li Shangyin and Du Mu, namely &quot;Little Li Du&quot;, Du Fu and Li Bai are also collectively called &quot;Big Li Du&quot;. According to the &quot;New Book of Tang&quot; records, Li Bai was the ninth grandson of Emperor Xingsheng (Liang Wuzhao King Li Hao) and the same clan as the kings of Li and Tang Dynasties. He is a cheerful and generous person who loves drinking, writing poetry, and making friends. Li Bai was deeply influenced by Huang Lao Liezhuang&#39;s thoughts. The &quot;Collection of Li Taibai&quot; has been handed down from generation to generation. Most of his poems were written when he was drunk. His representative works include &quot;Wang Lushan Waterfall&quot;, &quot;The Road is Difficult&quot;, &quot;The Road to Shu is Difficult&quot;, &quot;About Wine&quot; and &quot;Morning&quot;. &quot;Fa Baidi City&quot; and so on. &lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 24 Sep 2023 05:23:05 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[渡荆门送别 | 李白]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://feedx.net/read?r=shiwen&d=239241]]><description> &lt;h2>;Farewell across Jingmen&lt;/h2>;[Tang Dynasty] Li Bai&lt;div style=&quot;color: #5b4636;&quot;>;crossed Jingmen to visit the Kingdom of Chu. &lt;br />;The mountains end with the plains, and the river flows into the wilderness. &lt;br />;Under the moonlight, there is a flying mirror, and the clouds form a sea tower. &lt;br />;I still feel sorry for the water in my hometown, and send my boat sailing thousands of miles away. &lt;/div>;&lt;h3>;Translation and annotations&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Translation&lt;/strong>;&lt;br />;I took a boat across the river to the distant Jingmen, and came to the Chu State during the Warring States Period. Domestic tours. &lt;br />;The mountains gradually disappear with the emergence of flat and vast wilderness, and the rivers flow in the endless wilderness. &lt;br />;The moonlight on the river is like a mirror flying from the sky, and the clouds create a mirage outside the city. &lt;br />;I still love this water from my hometown, which came all the way to see my eastbound boat. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Notes&lt;/strong>;&lt;br />;Jingmen: The name of the mountain is located on the south bank of the Yangtze River in the northwest of Yidu County, Hubei Province. It faces Huya Mountain on the north bank. The terrain is dangerous and has been the throat of Chu and Shu since ancient times. say. &lt;br />;Far: far from. &lt;br />;Chu State: Chu Land refers to the Hubei area and belonged to the Chu State during the Spring and Autumn Period. &lt;br />;Pingye: a flat and vast wilderness. &lt;br />;River: Yangtze River. &lt;br />;Great wilderness: vast and endless fields. &lt;br />;Flying Sky Mirror under the Moon: The bright moon reflects in the river, like a flying sky mirror. Down: Move down. &lt;br />;Hailou: mirage, which describes the beautiful scene of clouds on the river. &lt;br />;Still: Still. &lt;br />;Pity: love. One book is &quot;Lian&quot;. &lt;br />;Hometown water: refers to the Yangtze River water flowing from Sichuan. Because the poet has lived in Sichuan since he was a child, he calls Sichuan his hometown. &lt;br />;Wanli: means a long journey. &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;Appreciation&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;p>; This poem was written by Li Bai when he came out of Shu. Li Bai left Shu this time and took a long boat ride by water, passing through Bayu, out of the Three Gorges, and headed straight beyond Jingmen Mountain. The purpose was to visit the hometown of the Chu Kingdom in Hubei and Hunan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;Crossing the distance outside Jingmen, coming to travel from the state of Chu&quot; refers to this grand tour. At this time, the young poet was very interested. He sat on the boat and admired the towering mountains on both sides of Wushan Mountain. Along the way, the scenery in front of him gradually changed. When the boat passed the Jingmen area, it was already a plain wilderness, and the field of vision suddenly broadened. Scenery:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;The mountains end with the plains, and the rivers flow into the wilderness.&quot; In this couplet, in just ten words, the author describes four scenes: rolling mountains, flat fields, and rushing rivers. Yangtze River, a vast wasteland. Every scene is so vast that it makes people look at it and think about it thousands of miles away. This sentence means that the mountains gradually disappear with the appearance of low plains, and the rivers flow in the endless wilderness. It describes the magnificent scenery of crossing Jingmen and entering the Chu region, and uses a flowing perspective to describe the changes in the scenery. The terrain on both sides of the ship from Shu to Jingmen transitions from mountains to plains. The mountains disappear from the sight little by little, and the river rushes down the mountains toward the river. The vast wilderness rushes away, drawing a majestic picture of the Yangtze River, which is a long-term view. Among them, the word &quot;sui&quot; gradually changes and shifts the position of the mountains and wilderness, truly expressing it and making it vivid, giving people a sense of space and flow. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; How to integrate four scenes into the same picture? The author uses the word &quot;sui&quot; to connect &quot;mountain&quot; and &quot;wild&quot; together, and the word &quot;ru&quot; to connect &quot;river&quot; and &quot;wild&quot; together. The word &quot;sui&quot; depicts the direction and trend of the mountains, with a sense of flow and space, as if a picture is slowly unfolding in front of you. As the mountains go lower and lower, and finally submerge into the earth, the plains become wider and wider, and the poet&#39;s vision becomes wider. The word &quot;end&quot; expresses the joyful feeling of the poet&#39;s eyes suddenly opening up when the mountains disappear and the plains appear. The word &quot;ru&quot; has a strong sense of wedge, depicting the power of the Yangtze River impacting the wilderness, and also inspiring the author&#39;s pride. The author&#39;s inner passion and progress also rush to the distant sky with the current. The word &quot;enter&quot; in Wang Wan&#39;s &quot;Under the Cibeigu Mountain&quot; has the same connotation in &quot;The sun is rising in the sea and the night is lingering, and the spring in the river is entering the old year&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;Under the moon, there is a flying mirror, and the clouds form a sea tower.&quot; It means that the reflection of the moon in the water is like a sky mirror flying down from the sky. The clouds rise and change endlessly, forming a mirage. This sentence is a description of a close-up view of the Yangtze River. The &quot;Flying Mirror under the Moon&quot; is what you can see when looking down on a moonlit night. &quot;Yunshengjiehai Tower&quot; is what you can see when you look at it during the day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;I still pity the water of my hometown, and it sends me on a long journey thousands of miles away.&quot; It means that I still pity the water of my hometown, which flows thousands of miles to send me on a long journey. This sentence uses the rhetorical technique of personification to personify the water in my hometown. It expresses the poet&#39;s reluctance and longing for my hometown when he leaves his hometown. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The poet traveled along the Yangtze River to Jingmen, and the Shu land through which the river flowed was the hometown where he had been raised. How could he not be infinitely nostalgic and reluctant to leave when we parted for the first time? But the poet did not say that he missed his hometown, but said that the water of his hometown reluctantly sent me away all the way. With deep affection, he sent me off thousands of miles away. Writing from the opposite side, it became more and more obvious that he was homesick. The poem ends with a strong feeling of nostalgia and farewell, with endless words and endless emotions. The &quot;farewell&quot; in the title of the poem should be a farewell to one&#39;s hometown rather than a farewell to a friend. There is no emotion of farewell to a friend in the poem. Shen Deqian of the Qing Dynasty believed that &quot;there is no farewell meaning in the poem, and the two words can be deleted&quot; (&quot;Tang Poems&quot;), which is not unreasonable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The beginning and end of this poem are integrated, with lofty artistic conception and vigorous style. &quot;The mountains follow the plains and the fields end, and the river flows into the wilderness.&quot; The writing is lifelike and picturesque, just like a long-axis landscape painting of the Yangtze River emerging from the gorge and crossing Jingmen, and has become a popular saying. If it is said that an excellent landscape painting &quot;should be judged by thousands of miles if it is close at hand&quot;, then this majestic and majestic Five Rhymes can also be said to be able to see the big from the small, and one to ten. It is rich in capacity and encompasses the scenery of mountains and water flows tens of thousands of miles in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River. It has Highly concentrated artistic generalization ability. &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;Creative background&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;p>; This poem was written by Li Bai as a farewell to his hometown when he came from Shu to Jingmen in his youth. The specific writing time of this poem is uncertain. There are three specific theories: one is that it was written in 724 (the 12th year of Kaiyuan), the other is that it was written in 725 (the 13th year of Kaiyuan), and the third is that it was written in 726 (the 14th year of Kaiyuan). &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;About the author&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;div>;&lt;center>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://song.gushiwen.cn/authorImg/libai.jpg&quot; width=50 %>;&lt;/center>;&lt;/div>;Li Bai (701-762), also known as Taibai, also known as Qinglian Jushi, also known as &quot;The Exiled Immortal&quot;, was a great romantic poet in the Tang Dynasty and was hailed as the &quot;Poetry Immortal&quot; by later generations. &quot;, together with Du Fu are called &quot;Li Du&quot;.
