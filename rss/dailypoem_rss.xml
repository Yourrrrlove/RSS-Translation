Title of Yuefu&#39;s &quot;Xianghege&quot;. This is a Yuefu song, written very much like a folk song. &lt;br />;Qutang Jia: a businessman doing business in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. Qutang: refers to Qutang Gorge, one of the Three Gorges of the Yangtze River. Jia: Businessman. &lt;br />;Concubine: A modest word for an ancient woman to call herself. &lt;br />;Chao Youxin: The tide rises and falls within a certain period of time, which is called &quot;Chao Xin&quot;. &lt;br />;Tidal wavers: people who play in the water when the tide rises, or people who take boats into the river when the tide comes. &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;Appreciation&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;p>; This poem draws on the strengths of Yuefu folk songs. The language is as clear as words, but it is also thought-provoking. The poem uses line drawing to describe the thoughts of a business woman. The first two lines of the poem are known for their plainness, while the last two lines are astonishing: &quot;If I had known the tide and had faith, I would have married into the tide.&quot; The husband has no faith, but the tide has faith. If I had known this, I should have married the man who makes the tide. The &quot;tide waver&quot; will at least follow the trend of Youxin and come on time, so that he will not miss the date of his concubine! This is the fantasy that the missing woman came up with in all kinds of helplessness. The two words &quot;I knew it&quot; describe the depth of her resentment, and she couldn&#39;t help but hurt herself and regretted her past. &quot;Marrying and being a trendy boy&quot; is both a silly saying and a bitter saying. It describes the mental state of missing a woman and being extremely resentful. Although it is a fantasy, it is from the heart. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; This poem is written naturally, but its internal logic is very strict. The missing wife&#39;s husband &quot;comes to court&quot; and breaks his promise, but thinks that the tide &quot;comes to him&quot; and trusts him, which in turn creates regret for marrying someone who is not a human being. It delicately demonstrates the inner contradiction of hope and resentment, and resentment and regret. The whole poem is emotionally sincere and has a strong flavor of folk songs. &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;Creative background&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>; In the Tang Dynasty, a large number of poems with the theme of feud between women appeared. These poems mainly have two main contents: one is about missing the husband, and the other is about missing the husband. It&#39;s a blame businessman. Li Yi&#39;s &quot;Jiangnan Song&quot; belongs to this type of poem about boudoir. &lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;Evaluation&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;p>; In &quot;Wrinkle Water Xuan Ci Quan&quot;, He Shang believes that Li Yi&#39;s poem is similar to &quot;Shen Hate Xixi&quot; in Zhang Xian&#39;s &quot;A Cluster of Flowers&quot; &quot;Thinking, not as good as peaches and apricots, is like marrying the east wind&quot; are all &quot;unreasonable but wonderful&quot;. Zhong Xing commented on this poem in &quot;Return of Tang Poems&quot; and said: &quot;It&#39;s a ridiculous thought, but the resentment is real.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Huang Shucan said in &quot;Notes on Tang Poems&quot;: &quot;I don&#39;t know how to get this idea. I am eager to speak. I know that &quot;Zheng Feng&quot; &quot;If you don&#39;t think about me, how can there be no one else&quot;, which is the ultimate expression of resentment.&quot;&lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;About the author&lt;/h3>;&lt;p >;&lt;div>;&lt;center>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://song.gushiwen.cn/authorImg/liyi.jpg&quot; width=50%>;&lt;/center>;&lt;/div>;Li Yi (about 750-about 830) , a poet of the Tang Dynasty, with the courtesy name Junyu, his ancestral home is Guzang, Liangzhou (now Liangzhou District, Wuwei City, Gansu), and later moved to Zhengzhou, Henan. In the fourth year of Dali (769), he was a Jinshi. He was first appointed as the captain of Zheng County, but he was not promoted for a long time. Due to frustration in his official career, he abandoned his official position and wandered around Yanzhao. He is famous for his frontier poems and is good at quatrains, especially Qijue. &lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 16 Sep 2023 06:23:05 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[瞻卬 | 诗经·大雅·荡之什]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://feedx.net/read?r=shiwen&d=239161]]><description> &lt;h2>;Looking at the Haotian&lt;/h2>;[Pre-Qin] The Book of Songs·Daya·Dangzhishi&lt;div style=&quot;color: #5b4636;&quot;>;&lt;p>;Looking at the Haotian, will you not benefit from me? The holes are filled with restlessness, so the punishment is so severe. The state is in ruins, and the soldiers and the people are in trouble. There are thieves and diseases, and there are barbarians everywhere. If the crime is not taken away, there will be chaos! &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Men have land, but women have it. People have people, and women overthrow them. This should be innocent, but the woman will accept it. Bi Yi is guilty, and the woman replies. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;A wise husband makes a city, and a wise wife charms a city. Yi Jue is a wise woman, and she is an owl and an owl. The woman has a long tongue and is powerful! Bandits descend from heaven and are born from women. Bandit religions and bandit teachings were at the Weifu Temple. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The people in Jiu are worried about it, but they are afraid of it. How can it be said that Yihu is not extremely? Like Jia three times, a gentleman is knowledgeable. If a woman has no official business, she should stop weaving silkworms. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Why is the sky thorny? Why is God not rich? Sheer Jiedi, Weiyu Xuji. Not hanging is ominous, and the majesty is not the same. When people die, the country will die! &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Heaven’s bestowal on him is to maintain his superiority. People&#39;s clouds are dying, and their hearts are worried. Heaven&#39;s surrender is just a matter of a few. When people die, their hearts are filled with sadness! &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Looking at the boiling spring, it is very deep. The heart is worried, would you rather stay from now on? Don’t put yourself first, don’t put yourself last. Anyone who despises Haotian can defeat Gong. There is no anger for the emperor, and he will save you later. &lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;h3>;Translation and annotations&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Translation&lt;br />;&lt;/strong>;Looking up at the sky means deep things, but the sky is merciless to me. The world has not been peaceful for a long time, and great disasters have caused great harm to the world. There is no peace in the country, and the scholars and common people are harmed. Pests and diseases destroy crops year after year without end. If the criminal law is not restrained, the abyss of suffering will not be alleviated. &lt;br />;People have a good piece of land, but you take it for yourself. Others have strong labor force, but you take advantage of it. This man was originally innocent, but you turned against him and arrested him. That person should be a sinner, but you forgive and forgive. &lt;br />;A talented man will dominate, but a talented woman will destroy the country. It&#39;s a pity that this woman is so arrogant and has a bad reputation like an owl or an owl. They are good at telling lies with their sweet words, and they hide the root of disaster and evil. Disasters do not come from heaven, but from the side of women. It is not for others to teach me, just because I am close to the girl Hongzhuang. &lt;br />;Luo Zhi was accused of being framed, and his words were contradictory. Isn&#39;t she cruel? Who is so cruel and evil? Just like a profiteer making a fortune, a gentleman has clear insight. Women should not be involved in government affairs, and all silkworm and weaver girls should be put aside. &lt;br />;Why does heaven punish suffering? Why don’t gods protect us? The culprit and stubborn enemy didn&#39;t care at all, he was just jealous of me. People show no mercy when suffering disasters, and pretend to be ignorant when their discipline is corrupted. All the good ministers and wise men have fled, and the country is in crisis without help. &lt;br />;The sky is merciless and has cast down the net of law, and it is difficult to hide in the harsh and numerous ways. All the good ministers and wise men are in exile, and they taste the bitter fruits when they worry about the country. The sky is mercilessly raining down the law, and frequent crises are unstoppable. Kill all the good ministers and wise men, and feel sad when you are worried about the country. &lt;br />;The gushing spring boils and sprays water, and the gurgling spring has deep roots. When you are worried about the country, your heart is sad. Could it be that today your worries are increasing? Disasters will not befall you during your lifetime, and disasters will not follow you after your death. The Thousand Earth Emperor is unpredictable, controlling all living beings and determining the universe. Do not dishonor your ancestors and save your country for your descendants. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Notes&lt;br />;&lt;/strong>;卬 (yǎng): means &quot;Yang&quot;.

The first chapter describes natural disasters and man-made disasters, the current situation is difficult and dangerous, the country is unstable, and the lives of people are in ruins. The &quot;heaven&quot; here refers to the heaven of nature, and also refers to the &quot;heaven&quot; of human society - the supreme ruler of mankind. Therefore, the &quot;disaster&quot; here includes both natural disasters and man-made disasters. And man-made disasters are even worse than natural disasters. Chapter two exposes the perverse tyranny through two &quot;reverse&quot; and two &quot;overturn&quot; accusations. Chapter 3 believes that the root cause of trouble is that women are favored, and the main means of harming others are slander and gossip. Chapter 4 proposes that an effective way to eliminate &quot;female troubles&quot; is to let &quot;women&quot; work as female workers in silkworm weaving and not participate in government affairs. The fifth chapter directly accuses King You of not guarding against the Rong and Di, but resenting the virtuous ministers, which resulted in the destruction of the country. In the sixth chapter, in the face of natural and man-made disasters, he expresses his sincere concern for the times and the country. In Chapter Seven, he hurt himself and was born in troubled times, and put forward a plan to remedy the situation to admonish the king. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The questions raised in &quot;Zhan Yan&quot; can not only be confirmed from historical books, but also supplement the omissions and deficiencies in historical records. The main historical fact that King You of Zhou favored Bao Si and destroyed the country with his desolate government is: Ever since King You received Bao Si, he pampered her endlessly, became extravagant and ignored the affairs of the state. One is to use the beacon tower to buy a thousand pieces of gold. The princes thought that the enemy was invading and came to rescue him, but they were deceived and returned angrily. After teasing him many times, he broke his trust with the princes and never came to King Qin again. The second is to reuse the sycophant Guo Shifu. This person is &quot;a sycophant, good at flattery, and a profit-loving person&quot; and &quot;all the people in the country are resentful&quot; (&quot;Historical Records·Zhou Benji&quot;). Third, he wanted to depose Empress Shen and Prince Yijiu, and make Bao Si the empress and Bao Si&#39;s son Bofu as the crown prince. This angered Empress Shen and colluded with the Western Yi and Quan Rong to attack the Zhou Dynasty, kill King You and destroy the Western Zhou Dynasty. The content reflected in &quot;Zhan Yen&quot; is more extensive, specific and profound than the historical records. The poem lists the evil deeds of King You of several weeks, including: making accusations and killing scholars; being harsh and oppressive, making the people miserable; occupying land and plundering slaves; and indulging sinners. , persecution of the innocent; corrupt political style, disordered discipline; jealousy of the virtuous and capable, traitors gain power; crimes are so dense that loyal ministers flee. It comprehensively and vividly presents a historical picture on the eve of the collapse of Western Zhou society in front of readers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; It is unknown who the author of &quot;Zhan Xian&quot; is. He was either a bloody clan member of the Zhou Dynasty, an upright and powerful official in the court, or a persecuted remonstrator. No matter who he was, he deeply hated the social darkness, political corruption and perverse behavior under the rule of King You of Zhou Dynasty, so he ruthlessly exposed and severely criticized what King You had done. Feeling sorry and heartbroken. The poet is particularly saddened by the fact that &quot;when a person dies, a country dies.&quot; The &quot;death&quot; of a person may include death, killing, demotion, seclusion, or flight. Wise men and gentlemen are the pillars of the country, and the old and mature weeds are the vitality of the country. Now that the vitality has been damaged, the pillars will collapse, the people will perish, the country will be exhausted, and the gods will be angry. The poet&#39;s emotions are uncontrollable, like lava erupting from a volcano, stuck in the throat, and he is unhappy if he doesn&#39;t spit it out. In the fifth chapter, there are two sentences at the beginning: &quot;Why is the sky stabbed? Why is the god not rich?&quot; He is really crying out to the gods, beating his chest and feet, and feeling sad. Incessantly. Then three sentences &quot;Man&#39;s death in the clouds&quot; welled up from his heart, lamenting the indescribable meaning of regret and loss, and repeatedly stating &quot;Wei Qi is excellent&quot;, &quot;Wei Qi is few&quot;, &quot;Wei Qi is deep&quot;, sighing and worrying. , in &quot;My heart is worried&quot; and &quot;My heart is sad&quot;, the pain is fully expressed, and the stirring emotions are tragically expressed. The poem is in such loops and sad syllables, which makes people cry, and presents the sincere heart of the lonely minister and evil son in broad daylight. It makes people read it as if they hear his voice and see his person. He is a person who cares about the country and cares about the time. The image of a warm-hearted character appears on the page and is ready to be seen. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The number of sentences in each chapter of &quot;The Book of Songs&quot; is roughly the same. There are only a few chapters of varying lengths. &quot;Zhan Xian&quot; is an example. The poem has seven chapters in total, with the first, third and last chapters having ten lines, and the remaining four chapters having eight lines. This jagged chapter and sentence makes it easier for hearty narrative, lyricism and discussion. The structure of the poem is extremely majestic at the beginning, with a high-level view, sweeping everything in, and it is as vigorous as vomiting. The language in the article is very fresh and sharp, but it also has a straightforward meaning. The words in the poem are finished but the meaning is still unfinished. The rhetorical sentences are quite distinctive, or use contrasting and contrasting sentence patterns to express the accumulated anger in the chest, or to reflect on the feelings of deep contemplation. Or it is ingenious with vivid metaphors, rich connotations, and profound expressions. In terms of rhyme, each chapter is different. There is a rhyme used at the end of each sentence, such as Chapter 4, which may have the same rhyme or co-rhyme. This kind of rhyme used in sentences is a common rhyme example in the Book of Songs. The &quot;Bai Liang style&quot; of seven-character poems in the Han, Wei, Southern and Northern Dynasties inherited this tradition. There are also a few ancient seven-character poems in the Tang Dynasty that use rhyme in every sentence. There are two rhymes in one chapter of this poem, such as Chapter 5 and Chapter 6. As the poet&#39;s emotions change, the rhythm of the poem slows down or accelerates, rises or falls, and the rhyme also changes accordingly, either in flat tones, or oblique tones, or in conjunction with each other, which increases the beauty of the sound and style and makes the poem more vivid. . &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;Creative background&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>; This is a poem that satirizes King You of Zhou for his chaos and ruin of the country. King You of Zhou was stupid and decadent, favored his concubines, corrupted discipline, appointed traitors, expelled the virtuous, and went against the grain, which led to the wrath of heaven and the resentment of people. The dogs and soldiers from the north took the opportunity to invade and killed King You of Zhou at the foot of Mount Li, thus leading to the demise of the Western Zhou Dynasty. Therefore, the poet wrote this poem &quot;Daya Zhanyi&quot; to satirize it. &lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;About the author&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 16 Sep 2023 04:23:06 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
