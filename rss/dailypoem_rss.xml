The light rain in the night moistens the sand on the embankment, and the fragrant breeze blows through thousands of houses. The mandarin duck tiles in the painting building are washed, and the colored ropes are half wet and the swing is fragrant. When I wake up to the red sun, I put up the window screen and listen to the apricot blossoms being sold on the street. &lt;/div>;&lt;h3>;Translation and annotations&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Translation&lt;/strong>;&lt;br />;One after another, the little crow kept shouting for joy, breaking the dark night and welcoming Here comes the glory of spring. The slight spring rain last night moistened the soft sand on the river bank, and the fragrant breeze filled thousands of homes. I washed the mandarin duck tiles in the painting building clean and wetted the swing with colorful ropes tied with incense. When I woke up, the red sun was already shining on the window screen, and I heard someone selling apricot blossoms on the street. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Notes&lt;/strong>;&lt;br />;Cold Food: The day before Qingming Festival is the Cold Food Festival, and fire is prohibited for three days in memory of Jie Zitui. &lt;br />;Milk crow: young crow. &lt;br />;Sheng: Yes, no matter what. Shaohua: Good times, leading to spring. &lt;br />;Yuanyang tiles: paired tiles. &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;Brief Analysis&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;p>; Cold food occurs in the early third month of the lunar calendar, one or two days before Qingming, when spring is already halfway through. Wang Yuanding&#39;s set of &quot;Cold Food&quot; consists of four poems, and this is the second of them. The other three poems mainly describe the rich and complex feelings caused by the passing spring in the author&#39;s heart, which may cause inexplicable sleepiness, lingering emotions, or the desire to have timely pleasure. The subjective color is relatively strong. This song is different. The author does not express his emotions directly, but uses a subtle and implicit lyrical technique that blends his emotions with the scenery, completely melting his joy for spring into a vibrant and interesting sound and light picture. among. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In this little order, &quot;the crow crows&quot;, &quot;the rain moistens the sand on the embankment&quot;, &quot;the painted building has clean tiles&quot;, &quot;the colorful rope is half wet&quot; and &quot;the red sun goes up the window screen&quot;, &quot; &quot;Apricot blossoms are sold on the street&quot; and so on, which outline the vibrant and interesting scene of the cold food season and express the author&#39;s joy for spring. The language is fresh and elegant. Although it uses famous poetic lines from previous generations in many places, it is natural and smooth without any feeling of being forced or outdated. &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;About the author&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;Wang Yuanding: In the words, he was alive during the Dade period of Chengzong in the Yuan Dynasty (around 1302 AD). At the same time as Aruwei, he became a Hanlin bachelor. &lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https:/ /feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br >;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 17 Oct 2023 05:23:08 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[生查子·旅思 | 吴伟业]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://feedx.net/read?r=shiwen&d=2310171]]><description> &lt;h2>;Shengchazi·Lvsi&lt;/h2>;[Qing Dynasty] Wu Weiye&lt;div style=&quot;color: #5b4636;&quot;>;One ​​foot crosses the river and the mountain, and thousands of Huai trees grow. The water gurgled on the rocks and flowed into the green stream. &lt;br />;The north wind is cold in June, and the leaves fall without morning or evening. Duyue and Chuanyun are walking around in the dark forest. &lt;/div>;&lt;h3>;Translation and annotations&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;One foot: describes the low mountains in the distance. &lt;br />;Changhuai: Huaihe River. &lt;br />;Qingxi: The East Canal dug by the Wu State during the Three Kingdoms period passed through present-day Nanjing and entered the Qinhuai River. &lt;br />;Duyue: Passing through the shade of trees. Yue: shady trees beside the road. &lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;Appreciation&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>; This word expresses the thoughts of traveling by describing the scenery. The distant mountains and trees gradually recede into the distance, and the clear spring water beside me flows over the rocks and merges into the green stream. Even though it was midsummer in June, when Duyue passed through the clouds on the gloomy mountain road, he still felt cold and windy, the forest was dark, and it was difficult to distinguish between morning and dusk. &quot;Lvsi&quot; is not written clearly, but &quot;Lvsi&quot; appears by itself. &lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;About the author&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;div>;&lt;center>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://song.gushiwen.cn/authorImg/wuweiye.jpg&quot; width=50%>;&lt;/ center>;&lt;/div>;Wu Weiye (1609～1672), also known as Jungong, also named Meicun, also named Lu Qiaosheng, Guanyin Master, and Dayun Taoist.
