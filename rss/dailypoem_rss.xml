The pond is twenty miles east of the city, and it often corresponds to the increase or decrease in the clarity and turbidity of the Surabaya River. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Jujube flowers are falling on clothes and towels, a milling wheel is ringing in the south of the village and in the north of the village, and cucumbers are sold by ancient willows in water clothes. (町通:环)&lt;br />;I am sleepy after being drunk for a long time, and I am thirsty and thinking about tea when I am high in the sun. Knock on the door and ask the savages. &lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;h3>;Translation and annotations&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Translation&lt;/strong>;&lt;br />;Jujube flowers fell on the lapels of passers-by, and the sound sounded from the south of the village to the north. There was the sound of a wheel reeling silk, and a farmer in coarse cloth was selling cucumbers under the old willow tree. &lt;br />;The road is far away, the drunkenness is on my mind, I feel dizzy and just want to take a nap, the sun is high, I am tired and thirsty, I want to drink some tea to quench my thirst. So I knocked on the door of a villager&#39;s house in the wild and asked if I could give him a bowl of tea. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Notes&lt;/strong>;&lt;br />;Xumen: Xuzhou. &lt;br />;Xie Yu: Thank God after the rain. &lt;br />;簌猌: The appearance of falling one after another. It is pronounced as &quot;甔茌&quot; with the same pronunciation and meaning. &lt;br />;Reeling wheel: spinning wheel. Reeling, making a &quot;reeling&quot;, soaks the silkworm cocoon in hot water and pulls out the silk. &lt;br />;Water clothing: coir raincoat and the like. This generally refers to clothes made of burlap. &quot;Han Shu. Food and Huo Zhi&quot; has a saying that &quot;poor people often wear clothes like water and horses&quot;. &lt;br />;Mansi Tea: I want to find some tea anywhere. Romantic, casual, one word is &quot;詩&quot;. &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;Creative background&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;p>; This poem was written by the 43-year-old Su Shi when he was the prefect of Xuzhou (now Jiangsu). In the spring of 1078 AD (the first year of Yuanfeng in the Northern Song Dynasty), a severe drought occurred in Xuzhou. As a local official, Su Shi once led his people to a stone pond twenty miles east of the city to pray for rain. After it rained, he went to Shitan with the people to thank him for the rain. Su Shi wrote the poem &quot;Huanxi Sand&quot; on his way to Xie Yu in Shitan, Xumen. &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;Appreciation&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;p>; The poem &quot;Huanxisha&quot; was written by Su Shi when he was 43 years old when he was the prefect of Xuzhou. In the spring of 1078 AD (the first year of Yuanfeng), a severe drought occurred in Xuzhou. As a local official, Su Shi once led his people to a stone pond twenty miles east of the city to pray for rain. After it rained, he went to Shitan with the people to thank him for the rain. Su Shi composed the poem &quot;Huanxi Sand&quot; on his way to Xie Yu in Shitan, Xumen. This is the fourth of five poems in total. The work describes his experiences and feelings in the countryside. It is artistically ingenious. The words start from typical things commonly seen in rural areas, and express the honest rural flavor in an interesting way. Fresh and simple, clear as words, vivid and lifelike, are the distinctive features of this word. The first part of this poem describes the scenery, and the second part is lyrical. It should be pointed out that the scene described in this poem is not a unified picture formed through visual images in general, but a scene reflected on the screen of the poet&#39;s consciousness through various different sounds transmitted to the ear drum. A series of continuous memories. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; This poem was written by Su Shi when he was an official in Xuzhou (in today&#39;s Jiangsu Province). According to the superstitious customs at that time, a local official who was concerned about farming would ask the &quot;Dragon Lord&quot; for rain when there was a severe drought; when it rained, he would also thank the &quot;Dragon Lord&quot; for the rain. This poem is one of the things Su Shi recorded when he passed through the countryside to thank Yu. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;The jujube flowers are falling off the clothes and towels&quot;, according to the literary meaning, it should be &quot;the dates are falling off the clothes and towels.&quot; When ancient people wrote poetry, they often adjusted the order of sentence components according to the needs of meter and rhetoric, as is the case here. &quot;簌簌&quot; describes the appearance of jujube flowers falling one after another. &quot;Yijie&quot; refers to clothes and headscarves. In ancient clothing, men often wore headscarves. Jujube trees bloom small yellow-green flowers in early summer. The author did not see the falling jujube flowers from the side, but walked under the jujube tree or stood under the jujube tree so that the jujube flowers could fall on the clothes and towels. Next, &quot;the sound of reeling in the south of the village and the north of the village&quot;. &quot;缩[sāo]车&quot;, a hand-operated tool for extracting silk. The sound of silk reeling was heard from the south end to the north end of the village. It turned out that the silkworm farmers were working nervously. Here, there are jujube flowers scattered, there are winding cars singing, and under the ancient willow trees on the roadside, there is also a farmer wearing a water jacket selling cucumbers. &quot;Water clothing&quot; is a kind of fabric made of hemp or grass and used to cover the water body. Here it refers to things like coir raincoat. There are three sentences in the film, each of which describes an aspect of the scenery. This time Su Shi came to the countryside by chance and sensitively captured these characteristics, especially things with seasonal characteristics such as jujube flowers, silk reeling, and cucumbers, and sketched them. With just a few strokes, a custom painting of a rural area in early summer was painted. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; This poem not only describes the scenery, but also remembers the events. In the next film, it turns into the writer&#39;s own activities. At this time, he was already &quot;drunk but sleepy after a long journey&quot;. &quot;Drunk from alcohol&quot; means sleepiness after drinking, indicating that he drank before going on the road. &quot;The road is long&quot;, it seems, has traveled a long distance, but is still far away from the destination. &quot;Wei&quot;, only. This sentence expresses the sleepiness of his journey. &quot;People in Rigao are thirsty and think about tea.&quot; &quot;Sun Gao&quot; means the sun has risen very high. While driving under the early summer sun, I felt hot and thirsty, and I couldn&#39;t help but want to drink a cup of tea to soothe my throat and quench my thirst. &quot;Man&quot; here means can&#39;t help it. If you are thirsty, you need tea; if you are sleepy, you probably want tea to relieve your sleepiness. So he &quot;knocked on the door and asked the savages.&quot; &quot;Savage family&quot; refers to rural people, that is, ordinary people in the countryside. Su Shi was the chief executive of a state at the time. He called local farmers &quot;savage families&quot; in his writings, which was just out of his official tone. But the word &quot;question&quot; shows that he has no official air. He did not order his attendants to ask for it, but he himself knocked on the door of a common man&#39;s house and politely discussed with them: &quot;Fellow, can you give me some tea to quench my thirst?&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In this way, with a few simple sentences, he not only painted a picture of a rural area full of life, but also recorded an experience of knocking on the door of a fellow villager to ask for tea. It’s something that you can’t touch in other places, so it feels fresh and interesting. This poem seems to have been written casually, but in fact the words are vivid and expressive, giving this short poem a narrative style an artistic life. This is the &quot;inexhaustible meaning, seen beyond the words&quot; that is emphasized in classical poetry. Why does the author want to &quot;knock on the door and ask questions&quot;? 1. He is a good parent official who is considerate of the people and loves them as his own son. He is modest and polite and will not rush into the farmhouse; 2. He just asked for rain after the drought. The owner may be out farming in the fields and not at home, so he wants to test the family. Is anyone there? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In the poem &quot;Huanxisha&quot;, the sentence &quot;Jujube flowers rustle on clothes and towels fall off&quot; is actually the reverse text of &quot;Jujube flowers rustle off clothes and towels&quot;; in Du Fu&#39;s poem &quot;Autumn Xing&quot; there is &quot;Fragrant rice&quot; The original meaning is: Parrots peck at the remaining fragrant rice grains, and the phoenix perches on the old phoenix branches. While the subject and object are inverted, the objects &quot;fragrant rice grains&quot; and &quot;biwu branches&quot; are also split into the positions of the subject and the guest. Regarding the inversion of verses in classical poetry, Hong Liangji from the Qing Dynasty said: &quot;Poets often use inversion to find it strange and vivid.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The whole poem of &quot;Huanxisha&quot; contains scenery and people, tangible and colorful, and has a strong local flavor. The sun is high, the road is long, the person is drunk, and the person is thirsty. It literally represents the fatigue of the journey, but it still conveys joy and joy, and conveys the spirit of the protagonist, the county magistrate, who is considerate of the people. This poem not only paints a realistic picture of rural life in early summer, but also records the author&#39;s experiences and feelings during the journey, opening up a new world for the social content of Northern Song Dynasty poems. &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;Appreciation&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;p>; This poem was written by Su Shi when he was an official in Xuzhou. According to the superstitious customs at that time, a local official who was concerned about farming would ask the &quot;Dragon Lord&quot; for rain when there was a severe drought; when it rained, he would also thank the &quot;Dragon Lord&quot; for the rain. This poem is one of the things Su Shi recorded when he passed through the countryside to thank Yu. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; This word describes his experiences and feelings in the countryside. It is artistically ingenious. The words start from typical things commonly seen in rural areas, and express the honest rural flavor in an interesting way. Fresh and simple, clear as words, vivid and lifelike, are the distinctive features of this word. The first part of this poem describes the scenery, and the second part is lyrical. It should be pointed out that the scene described in this poem is not a unified picture formed through visual images in general, but a scene reflected on the screen of the poet&#39;s consciousness through various different sounds transmitted to the ear drum. A series of continuous memories. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;Jujube flowers are falling on clothes and towels&quot; begins with the sound of date flowers falling on clothes and towels, reflecting the joy of a prefect who cares about people&#39;s lives for the new scene in the countryside after the rain. The author was on the &quot;Xie Yu Road&quot;. After a long journey, he was still drunk and sleepy, so he couldn&#39;t help but feel a little tired. Suddenly, a &quot;swishing&quot; sound came to my ears, and it seemed like something was hitting my body and headscarf. Only then did he realize: it was a jujube flower falling on him. The sound of jujube blossoms falling on the clothes and scarves is slight, but it is so real to the author&#39;s ears. Then, there was another squeaking sound in my ears. The further I walked, the stronger the sound became. It came from the south, from the north, and from all directions. There was no need to look or ask. This was the sound of the reeling car that the author was familiar with. sound. &quot;South of the village and north of the village&quot; summarizes the sound of &quot;reeling&quot;, which shows how seriously, how carefully and how excited the author listened. From the sound, the author realized that he had entered the village. At this time, a sudden burst of hawking sound reached my ears. I looked closely and saw that it was a farmer wearing a &quot;water coat&quot; sitting in the shade of an ancient willow tree with a pile of cucumbers in front of him. &quot;Shuiyi Guliu&quot;, the author changes his perspective to write about his joy at the vegetable harvest. Three sentences, three images, seemingly scattered and completely unrelated. But when strung together with the line &quot;Xie Yu&#39;s Road&quot;, people feel that this comic strip has a strong three-dimensional sense. This group of pictures is not only beautiful in color, but also beautiful in music. Whether it is the sound of falling flowers, the buzzing sound of cars, or the cries of melon farmers, they are all full of rich flavor of life, vividly showing the prosperous scene of the countryside. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The first part describes the busy scene of rural production and labor, and the second part turns to the hardships of Xie Yu’s journey, highlighting the author’s feelings and conscious activities. &quot;Drunk but sleepy after a long journey&quot; is a supplement to the previous film. Structurally, this sentence is a flashback. It shows that the reason why the first three sentences were written from the auditory perspective is mainly because the drunkenness has not passed, the journey is long, and the body is tired, so what is written down is just a snippet that was heard in a sleepy state. , is not a complete and unified picture of visual composition. The two sentences &quot;The sun rises and people are thirsty&quot;, although they describe the conscious activities of eager to find water at farmers&#39; homes due to thirst, they also reflect the author&#39;s informal and happy-go-lucky character. Walking from village to village, it was already hot and sunny, and people were thirsty and sleepy due to the wine. They couldn&#39;t help but think of tea to quench their thirst and refresh themselves. The word &quot;question&quot; is used very carefully. It not only expresses the author&#39;s full hope of asking for a cup of tea to quench his thirst, but also worries that there will be no one in the farm during the busy farming season and it will be inconvenient for him to rush in. The letter is written without any polish, but it is lifelike, portraying the image of a humble and approachable magistrate, and describing the relationship between a prefect and ordinary farmers in a cordial and natural way. &quot;Knock on the door and ask the savages&quot;, the words stopped abruptly here. What was the result of the poet&#39;s knocking on the door, whether he got tea, and how the farmers entertained him? There is no explanation in the poem, leaving it to the reader&#39;s imagination, which leaves an endless aftertaste. This is the &quot;inexhaustible meaning, seen beyond the words&quot; that is emphasized in classical poetry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In the poem &quot;Huanxisha&quot;, the sentence &quot;Jujube flowers rustle on clothes and towels fall off&quot; is actually the reverse text of &quot;Jujube flowers rustle off clothes and towels&quot;; in Du Fu&#39;s poem &quot;Autumn Xing&quot; there is &quot;Fragrant rice&quot; The original meaning is: Parrots peck at the remaining fragrant rice grains, and the phoenix perches on the old phoenix branches. While the subject and object are inverted, the objects &quot;fragrant rice grains&quot; and &quot;biwu branches&quot; are also split into the positions of the subject and the guest. Regarding the inversion of verses in classical poetry, Hong Liangji from the Qing Dynasty said: &quot;Poets often use inversion to find it strange and vivid.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The whole poem is vivid and lifelike, and the narrative is fresh and elegant, full of emotion, which contributed to the expansion of the realm of Song poetry. &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;About the author&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;div>;&lt;center>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://song.gushiwen.cn/authorImg/sushi.jpg&quot; width=50 %>;&lt;/center>;&lt;/div>;Su Shi, (January 8, 1037 - August 24, 1101), also known as Zizhan and Hezhong, also known as Tieguan Taoist and Dongpo layman, known as Su Dongpo and Su Xian in the world.

The fragrance of rice flowers tells of a good harvest, and the sound of frogs sounds. &lt;br />;Seven or eight stars are out in the sky, and two or three points of rain are in front of the mountain. In the old days, by the forest of Maodian Society, I suddenly saw a bridge over a stream when the road turned. (Xiqiao No. 1: Xitou) &lt;/div>;&lt;h3>;Translation and annotations&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Translation&lt;/strong>;&lt;br />;The bright moonlight passed between the branches, startling Magpies flew from the branches, and the cool evening breeze seemed to hear the cicadas chirping in the distance. The fragrance of rice flowers and the sound of frogs in the fields seem to tell people that this is a good harvest year. &lt;br />;A few stars in the sky flickered brightly and dimly, and a light rain began to fall in front of the mountain. The small thatched house of the past is still next to the woods of Tutu Temple. When the road turns around the source of the stream, it suddenly appears in front of you. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Notes&lt;/strong>;&lt;br />;Xijiang Moon: the name of the word brand. &lt;br />;Huangsha: Huangsha Ridge is located to the west of Shangrao, Jiangxi. &lt;br />;Start the magpies from the branches: startle the magpies and fly away from the branches. &lt;br />;Cicada: The sound of cicada. &lt;br />;Old times: the past. &lt;br />;Maodian: a thatched country inn. &lt;br />;Shelin: The forest near the Tutu Temple. Society, Temple of the Land. In ancient times, there was a community tree in the village, which was used as a place for worshiping gods, so it was called community forest. &lt;br />;See: same as &quot;appear&quot;, appear, appear. &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;Appreciation&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;p>; Judging from the first two sentences of &quot;Moon on the West River&quot;, &quot;The bright moon leaves the branches startled by magpies, and the gentle breeze sings the cicadas in the middle of the night&quot;, it seems that it is written about the wind. , the moon, the cicada, the magpie, these are extremely ordinary scenery, but through the author&#39;s clever combination, the result is ordinary and extraordinary. The magpies were flying unsteadily, not hovering around the treetops, but flying around the slanting and abrupt branches. Because the moonlight is bright, the magpie is awakened; and when the magpie flies away, it will naturally cause the &quot;different branches&quot; to sway. At the same time, the chirping of cicadas also has a certain time. The chirping at night is different from the chirping under the scorching sun, and when the cool breeze blows slowly, it often feels particularly peaceful. In short, the two sentences &quot;frightened magpie&quot; and &quot;singing cicada&quot; contain stillness in the movement, and describe the scenery under the &quot;cool breeze&quot; and &quot;bright moon&quot; in the middle of the night in a leisurely and fascinating way. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Next, &quot;The fragrance of rice flowers talks about a good year, and listens to the sound of frogs.&quot; Shifts people&#39;s focus from the sky to the fields, showing that the poet is not only infiltrated by the soft taste of the yellow sand road at night, but also cares about it The fragrance of rice flowers that spread all over the village reminds us of the coming harvest. At this time and place, the joy that the poet and the people breathe together is all expressed in words. The &quot;fragrance&quot; of the fragrant rice flowers not only describes the blooming rice flowers, but also expresses the sweetness in the poet&#39;s heart. In the poet&#39;s mind, it is as if he can hear a group of frogs clamoring in unison in the rice fields, arguing about a good harvest. First tell the content of &quot;said&quot;, and then add the source of &quot;sound&quot;. It is the poet&#39;s creation to use the sound of frogs to talk about a good harvest. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The first four sentences simply describe the scenery of the mountain road at that time and the poet&#39;s feelings. However, the core is the summer night filled with harvest scenes. Therefore, it is not so much the summer scene as it is the happiness that the summer scene in front of us will bring to people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; At the beginning of Xia Que, the poet built a steep and steep peak, and used confrontation techniques to strengthen the stable tone. &quot;Seven or eight stars are outside the sky, and two or three drops of rain are in front of the mountain.&quot; Here, &quot;stars&quot; are sparse stars, and &quot;rain&quot; is light showers. These are all to match the quiet night, tranquil atmosphere and simple wildness of Shangyu. It matches the local flavor of Chengqu. In particular, the &quot;outside the sky&quot; and the &quot;mountain front&quot; were originally distant and elusive, but as soon as the pen was turned and the small bridge was crossed, the shadow of the thatched cottage beside the rural forest unexpectedly appeared before people&#39;s eyes. Although the poet is very familiar with the path on the yellow sand road, he is always so absorbed in the sound of frogs talking about the joy of a good harvest that he forgets to cross the &quot;outside of the sky&quot; and the &quot;mountain front&quot;, and even the nearby shrine. The thatched cottage next to the woods didn&#39;t even notice. The first part &quot;the road turns&quot; and the second part &quot;suddenly see&quot; not only express the poet&#39;s joy at suddenly seeing the old house clearly approaching, but also express his contentment that he was so immersed in the fragrance of rice flowers that he forgot about the distance of the road. The degree of fascination complements each other, reflecting the author&#39;s profound artistic skills, and is endlessly entertaining. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; On the surface, the subject matter of this poem is nothing more than some seemingly ordinary scenery. The language has no embellishment, no allusion is used, and the hierarchical arrangement is completely plain. However, precisely in the seemingly plain, there are the poet&#39;s painstaking conception and honest feelings. Here, readers can also appreciate another realm of Jiaxuan&#39;s poetry beyond the majestic and heroic. &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;Creative background&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>; In 1181 AD (the eighth year of Chunxi reign of Emperor Xiaozong of the Song Dynasty), Xin Qiji was dismissed from office because he was marginalized by traitorous ministers. He returned to Daihu, Shangrao, and lived there. Have lived here for nearly fifteen years. During this period, although he also had a brief career as an official, he mostly lived in Shangrao, where he left many poems. This poem was written when he was passing through Huangshaling Road in Shangrao, Jiangxi Province in his middle age. &lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;Sentence explanation&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;p>; &lt;strong>;The bright moon scares the magpies on the other branches, and the breeze sings the cicadas in the middle of the night. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The first two sentences of the word, composed of six noun phrases, depict a fresh rural summer night scene: the night sky is clear, the moon rises quietly, casting water-like moonlight, startling The black magpies are flying on the branches; in the middle of the night, the breeze blows slowly, bringing with it the chirping of cicadas. Using movement to contrast stillness, it expresses the tranquility and beauty of summer nights in the countryside. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Magpies are extremely sensitive to changes in light. When the moon is up, they are often startled by the moonlight and fly around and cry. Cao Cao&#39;s &quot;Dan Ge Xing&quot; has &quot;The moon and stars are sparse, and the black magpies are flying south. They circle the tree three times and there are no branches to rely on.&quot; Su Shi&#39;s &quot;Hangzhou Peony&quot; has &quot;The moon is bright and the magpies are frightened but the branches are not yet planted.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; There have been different opinions on the meaning of &quot;separate branches&quot; in the first sentence. Some interpret it as &quot;distant branch&quot;; some interpret it as &quot;slanting branch&quot;; some interpret it as &quot;the black magpie wants to leave the branch and fly away&quot;; some interpret it as &quot;the black magpie chooses the branch&quot;; others interpret it as &quot;the moon bids farewell to the branch&quot; &quot;. Although it is difficult to draw a conclusion, considering the parallelism between one and two sentences, &quot;biezhi&quot; corresponds to &quot;midnight&quot;, and the word &quot;bie&quot; should be used to describe and modify &quot;branch&quot;, so it is interpreted as &quot;distant branch&quot; or &quot;slanting branch&quot; seems more appropriate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although the poet traveled at night, he seemed to be in no hurry at all. We seem to see him walking leisurely on the mountain road, looking at where the bright moon is for a while, listening to the chirping of birds and the chirping of cicadas, leisurely and contented. At this time, he had no urgent business matters to deal with quickly, nor did he need to stay up all night over other people&#39;s accusations and slander. Although he was impeached and removed from office, he still had a lot of anger and sorrow in his heart, but the beautiful nature and tranquil rural life relieved some of his anger. So, on this beautiful summer night, walking on the quiet mountain path, he was completely immersed in the breeze and the bright moon, blending into the heaven and earth. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>;The fragrance of rice flowers speaks of a good year, and the sound of frogs sounds. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In the rice fields beside the road, the fragrance of rice flowers heralds the arrival of another good harvest. The frogs in the field couldn&#39;t bear the loneliness, and their cries kept coming and going, forming a continuous sound, which conveyed the author&#39;s love for nature and the vitality of summer. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>;Seven or eight stars are outside, and two or three points of rain are in front of the mountain. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Under the moonlight, smelling the fragrance of rice flowers and listening to the cicadas and frogs, the relaxed and happy poet continued to walk forward. Looking up at the sky, &quot;seven or eight stars&quot; hang sparsely on the horizon. It turns out that the stars are all blocked by dark clouds. Suddenly, it started to rain lightly in front of the mountain, and &quot;two or three drops of rain&quot; fell on the poet. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; At this time, the poet who was so leisurely just now couldn&#39;t help but become a little anxious. Summer weather can change at any time. Maybe a downpour will follow? He quickened his pace and hurried to find shelter from the rain. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>;In the old days, by the forest of Maodian Society, I suddenly saw a bridge over a stream when the road turned. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; After turning around the mountain path and crossing a stream bridge, just outside the woods next to the Tutu Temple, a thatched hut appeared in front of the poet. He was so happy that when he took a closer look, it turned out to be the small shop where he had stayed before! &quot;She&quot;, the woods near the Tutu Temple. &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;About the author&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;div>;&lt;center>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://song.gushiwen.cn/authorImg/xinqiji.jpg&quot; width=50 %>;&lt;/center>;&lt;/div>;Xin Qiji (May 28, 1140 - October 3, 1207), whose original name was Tanfu, later changed to You&#39;an, and in his middle age was also nicknamed Jiaxuan, Shandong East Road, Jinan A native of Licheng County (now Licheng District, Jinan City, Shandong Province).

He once published &quot;Ten Comments on Meiqin&quot; and &quot;Nine Discussions&quot; to lay out strategies for war and defense. His poems express the patriotic enthusiasm of trying to restore the unity of the country, express the grief and indignation of unrealized aspirations, and condemn the humiliation of the then rulers for peace; there are also many works that praise the country&#39;s mountains and rivers. The subject matter is broad and he is good at using allusions from previous generations into the lyrics. The style is majestic and heroic yet not lacking in delicacy and tenderness. Because Xin Qiji&#39;s anti-golden ideas were inconsistent with the political views of the peace faction in power, he was later impeached and dismissed from office, and retired to Daihu, Jiangxi. &lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https:/ /feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br >;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 20 Sep 2023 05:23:05 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
