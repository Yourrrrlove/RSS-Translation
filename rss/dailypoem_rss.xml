I just lazily watched the children chasing catkins flying in the air. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Notes&lt;/strong>;&lt;br />;Plum: A very sour fruit. &lt;br />;Soft teeth: one means splashing teeth, which means that the sour smell of plums penetrates the teeth. &lt;br />;Plantains are green: The green of plantains is reflected on the screen window. &lt;br />;And the window screen: &quot;Chengzhai Collection&quot; of &quot;Four Parts&quot; is called &quot;window screen&quot;, which is based on &quot;Selected Works of Yang Wanli&quot;.

Thoughts, intentions, emotions. &lt;br />;Catching willow flowers: Playing with catkins flying in the air. Willow flowers are catkins. &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;Brief Analysis&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;p>; The author of this poem had just woken up from a nap and was listless. When he saw the children chasing catkins, his childish innocence returned and he couldn&#39;t help but I was immersed in it expectantly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The banana trees are green, the willows are dancing, the poet&#39;s feelings are also there, the scenery is fresh and leisurely, full of childishness. Children catch willow flowers, and the willow flowers seem to have infinite childlike innocence, playing hide and seek with the children in the wind. From time to time there was laughter, which should have awakened the poet from his sleep. The first two sentences mark the summer season in the early Ming Dynasty, and the last two sentences indicate the long days in summer and the boredom. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; This poem uses plums, bananas, willow flowers and other objects to express the seasonal characteristics of early summer. The poet lives leisurely in the countryside. After taking a nap in early summer, he leisurely watches children catching and playing with catkins flying in the air, feeling happy. The word &quot;soft&quot; is used in the poem to express his leisurely mood; the word &quot;fen&quot; is also very expressive, with profound connotations but not sticky; especially the word &quot;xian&quot; not only vividly expresses the tranquility, leisure and harmony in the poet&#39;s heart The love for rural life is shown and echoes the title of the poem very cleverly. &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;About the author&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;div>;&lt;center>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://song.gushiwen.cn/authorImg/yangwanli.jpg&quot; width=50 %>;&lt;/center>;&lt;/div>;Yang Wanli (October 29, 1127 - June 15, 1206), named Tingxiu and Chengzhai.
