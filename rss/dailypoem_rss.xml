The thorny people are anxious, and the hard work is unbearable. &lt;br />;See you in plain clothes? My heart is sad and sad, and I want to talk about returning home with my son. &lt;br />;Common people see Sui Xi? My heart is full of knots, and I talk to my son as one. &lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;h3>;Translation and annotations&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Translation&lt;br />;&lt;/strong>;I am honored to see you wearing a white crown and observing etiquette, and seeing that your body is like this Thin and haggard, they are all sad and tired from doing the rituals. &lt;br />;I am honored to see you wearing white clothes and observing etiquette. I can&#39;t help but feel sad and sad. I really want to go home with you all the way. &lt;br />;I am honored to see you with your white crown, white clothes, and white covering your knees. Deep in my heart, I am filled with sadness, and I wish I could merge with your sorrow! &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Notes&lt;br />;&lt;/strong>;Su Guan: white hat. &lt;br />;Shu: Fortunately. &lt;br />;thorny man: sinner. Thorns, the place where prisoners are held. One thing is to say, thin. Luan Luan: Restricted, not free. One thing to say, he is thin and barren. &lt;br />;Tuán (tuán) Tuán: distressed and restless. &lt;br />;Chat: wish. Say &quot;and&quot;. &lt;br />;韠(bì): Covering the knees, decorated in ancient official uniforms, made of leather, sewn on the knees under the abdomen. &lt;br />;Yunjie: depression, worry and incomprehension. &lt;br />;Ruyi: Just like the same person. &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;Appreciation&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;p>; If this poem is regarded as a poem that laments the persecution and ostracism of virtuous ministers, then the first chapter writes about the persecution and ostracism of the virtuous minister. He is a virtuous minister. He wears a plain crown, has a thin and weak body, and is worried. From his external appearance to his inner activities, the character&#39;s image is gradually revealed. It is quite similar to Qu Zi&#39;s poem about the bank of the river, &quot;the description is haggard and the color is haggard&quot;. With a strong tragic atmosphere. In the second and third chapters, the first sentence still writes about the clothing of &quot;thorn people&quot;. In the previous chapter, &quot;Su Guan&quot; and &quot;Su Yi&quot; and &quot;Su Ji&quot; describe the whole body clothing of &quot;thorn people&quot; from top to bottom. The word &quot;Su&quot; It reminds people of the innocent and noble image of a wise minister. The second sentence, &quot;My heart is sad,&quot; directly expresses the poet&#39;s feelings. The third sentence, such as &quot;returning together&quot; and &quot;ruyi&quot;, shows the poet&#39;s wishes, and his thoughts and emotions are a step further than &quot;sadness&quot; and &quot;condensation&quot;. The characters in the whole poem are vivid and the poet has deep emotions. Each sentence ends with the modal particle &quot;xi&quot;, and the sad sound lingers in the ears. In a dangerous political environment, when virtuous ministers were persecuted and ostracized, the poet showed no scruples and clearly expressed his sympathy and his attitude of sharing the same fate with them. This kind of spirit is commendable and is very instructive in the world of friendship and friendship. It can be seen that the poet is also a virtuous man. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; This poem starts from the first chapter about plain crowns, the second chapter about plain clothes, and the third chapter further switches to plain covering the knees, from top to bottom, all the way down, the gentleman whom the poet meets is all in plain clothes. His pure white attire and simple moral character are awe-inspiring. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; If this poem is regarded as a love poem, then the first sentence of each chapter represents the person with clothing, expressing the eagerness to see the other person, the second sentence expresses the sorrow and sadness due to not being able to see the other person, and the last sentence says May we always be united. &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;Creative background&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>; Regarding the background of this poem, old theories such as &quot;Preface to Mao&#39;s Poems&quot;, Zheng Jian, Zhu Xi&#39;s &quot;Collected Poems&quot;, etc. are mostly limited to &quot;plain crown&quot; , &quot;plain clothes&quot;, this is considered to be a fierce and filial dress, which means that in the poem written in the late Zhou Dynasty, the rites and music were broken, and most people who were sons of human beings could not observe the three-year funeral, but in the poem, those who wore &quot;plain clothes&quot; could fulfill their filial piety and observe the funeral rituals. . &quot;Modern Notes on the Book of Songs&quot; says: &quot;This is a poem praising a filial son.&quot; Some people think it is a love poem. &lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;About the author&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 18 Sep 2023 05:23:05 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[送内寻庐山女道士李腾空二首 | 李白]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://feedx.net/read?r=shiwen&d=239182]]><description> &lt;h2>;Two poems by Li Tengkong, a female Taoist priest from Mount Lu, are sent to you&lt;/h2>;[Tang Dynasty] Li Bai&lt;div style=&quot;color: #5b4636;&quot;>;&lt;p>;If you are looking for an opportunity, you should go to Bishan&#39;s house. &lt;br />;The water pounded the mica and the wind swept away the heather. &lt;br />;If you like living in seclusion, invite me to enjoy the purple clouds. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The daughters of many princes and ministers learn Taoism and love gods. &lt;br />;The bare hands are holding the green mist, and the robes are dragging the purple smoke. &lt;br />;As soon as I folded the screen, I rode a luan with a jade whip. &lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;h3>;Translation and annotations&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Translation&lt;/strong>;&lt;br />;My wife is looking for Li Linfu’s daughter, the Taoist priest Li Tengkong. She should go Her thatched cottage on Lushan Mountain. &lt;br />;She is crushing mica with water to make elixirs. There must be heather growing in the thatched cottage. &lt;br />;If you like her quiet place, you might as well stay and practice with her. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The good wife is the descendant of the prime minister, and also likes to learn Taoism and practice magic. &lt;br />;The delicate white hands tease the green mist, and the embroidered clothes float with purple smoke. &lt;br />;As soon as you arrive at Lushan Pingfengdian, you can hold a white jade whip and fly on a crane with Taoist Master Tengkong. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Notes&lt;/strong>;&lt;br />;⑴Inside: refers to the wife. &lt;br />;⑵With a jade whip: One is &quot;without a whip&quot;. &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;Appreciation&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;p>; Li Bai walked out from the hustle and bustle of the world and came to the screen folding of Lushan Mountain with green mountains and green forests. &quot;Water pounded the mica, and the wind swept away the heather&quot; is an exquisite landscape painting that adds mystery and elegance to the trip. The poet&#39;s emotions changed from bold and unbridled to gentle, showing the artistic mentality of &quot;everything comes from and enters the machine&quot;, which comes from nature and returns to nature. So he wrote without any ambiguity: &quot;If it is good to live in seclusion, I invite you to play with Zixia.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Tengkong is the daughter of Li Linfu, the Prime Minister of the Tang Dynasty. She is extremely intelligent and very beautiful. However, she did not admire glory and wealth, but she was obsessed with learning Taoism. She came from Chang&#39;an, Kyoto, to live in seclusion in Mount Lu, and lived a life of poverty, which shows the strong admiration for Taoism in the Tang Dynasty. &quot;The bare hands are holding the green mist, and the robes are trailing the purple smoke.&quot; A few strokes of the pen highlight the image of a prime minister woman with a pure heart and no filth, a nature that is not corrupted by worldly desires, and a quiet Taoist image. If a person has no pursuit of worldly desires, glory and profit, the best destination is to &quot;go to the screen, ride on the luan and hold the jade whip.&quot; Li Bai&#39;s wife is also a prime minister, so some people think that the second song &quot;Many Queens and Prime Minister Women&quot; refers to Li Bai&#39;s wife. Li Bai and his wife, like Li Tengkong, longed for the fairyland life of being free from worldly affairs and immortality, and &quot;knowing that nothing can be done about it&quot; (Guan Yinzi&#39;s &quot;Cauldron&quot;). &quot;Be at ease as if you were destined&quot; (Zhuangzi&#39;s &quot;Human World&quot;) as one&#39;s own attitude towards life. &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;Creative background&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>; Li Bai once accompanied his wife to find Li Tengkong, a female Taoist priest in Lushan Mountain, who climbed many mountains and crossed steep mountains. At that time, I wrote the poem &quot;Two Poems for the Female Taoist Priest Li Tengkong in Lushan Mountain&quot; based on my feelings. &lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;About the author&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;div>;&lt;center>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://song.gushiwen.cn/authorImg/libai.jpg&quot; width=50%>;&lt;/ center>;&lt;/div>;Li Bai (701-762), also known as Taibai, also known as Qinglian Jushi, also known as &quot;Exiled Immortal&quot;, was a great romantic poet in the Tang Dynasty. He was hailed as the &quot;Poetry Immortal&quot; by later generations, and was the same as Du Fu They are collectively known as &quot;Li Du&quot;. In order to distinguish them from the other two poets Li Shangyin and Du Mu, who are known as &quot;Little Li Du&quot;, Du Fu and Li Bai are also collectively known as &quot;Big Li Du&quot;. According to the &quot;New Book of Tang&quot; records, Li Bai was the ninth grandson of Emperor Xingsheng (Liang Wuzhao King Li Hao) and the same clan as the kings of Li and Tang Dynasties. He is a cheerful and generous person who loves drinking, writing poetry, and making friends. Li Bai was deeply influenced by Huang Lao Liezhuang&#39;s thoughts. The &quot;Collection of Li Taibai&quot; has been handed down from generation to generation. Most of his poems were written when he was drunk. His representative works include &quot;Looking at Lushan Waterfall&quot;, &quot;The Road is Difficult&quot;, &quot;The Road to Shu is Difficult&quot;, &quot;About Drinking&quot; and &quot;Early Morning&quot;. &quot;Fa Baidi City&quot; and so on. &lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 18 Sep 2023 04:23:08 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
