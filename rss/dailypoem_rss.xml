Double curtains were raised on the high platform, allowing the band to play the beautiful harps and pipa. &lt;br />;Pursue happiness and let your hats fall in the wind, and persuade each other to drink and blow the chrysanthemums in the cups. &lt;br />;The shape of the stream after the rain is so clear and bright, and the pale sunlight of the early clearing day cannot be reflected into colorful clouds. &lt;br />;I, the white-headed prefect, am so foolish that I planted dogwood trees all over my temples in the hope of warding off evil spirits. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Notes&lt;br />;&lt;/strong>;Nine Days: Double Ninth Festival on the ninth day of the ninth lunar month. Set up wine: Arrange a banquet. &lt;br />;Wuhua: natural scenery. &lt;br />;Double account: double curtain. Stay: stay. Huajia (jiā): generally refers to playing music. Jia, Hu Jia, is the name of an ancient wind instrument. It was popular among ethnic minorities in the Western Regions during the Han Dynasty. It was first played with reed leaves, which harmonized with the instrument, and was later made of bamboo. &lt;br />;Invite happiness: seek happiness. Falling Wind Front Hat: Use Meng Jiashi. &quot;Book of Jin·Biography of Meng Jia&quot;: &quot;Meng Jia joined the army for Huan Wen. On September 9, he held a warm banquet at Longshan, and his subordinates gathered together. When the wind blew, Jia&#39;s hat fell to the ground, and Jia didn&#39;t realize it... Wen Ming Sun Sheng wrote and mocked Jia.&quot;&lt;br />;Promote drinking: urge people to drink. Flowers on wine: refers to chrysanthemums. Liang Zongmao of the Southern Dynasty wrote in &quot;The Chronicles of Jingchu Years&quot;: &quot;On September 9th, I wore dogwood, ate bait, and drank chrysanthemum wine.&quot;&lt;br />;Stream status: still a stream. &lt;br />;Sun marks: sunlight. &lt;br />;Baitou Taishou: The author refers to himself. &lt;br />;The sentence &quot;Manchu&quot;: In ancient times, it was customary to wear dogwood on the Double Ninth Festival, September 9, to dispel evil and avoid disasters. Cornus officinalis, the name of the plant, includes three types: Cornus officinalis, Cornus officinalis, and Cornus officinale. They grow in Sichuan Valley and have a strong flavor. Pi, the same as &quot;avoid&quot;. &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;Creative background&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>; Song Qi went abroad in his later years and knew military states such as Shou, Chen, Xu, Bo, Chengde, Ding, Yi and Zheng. The poet was fond of guests, banquets, and luxury all his life, but he was able to deal with the ups and downs of officialdom with an open mind and an open-minded attitude. This poem was written after a banquet. It reflects the poet&#39;s positive and optimistic mental outlook. &lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;Appreciation&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;p>; Chen Yan, a recent scholar, said: &quot;I climbed high for nine days without any words of emotion. It seems that this is the only poem.&quot; (&quot;The Essence of Song Poetry&quot;) commented very highly good. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first couplet of the poem breaks the title. The starting and ending points make the festival clear, and the tone is high. The gorgeous things and the pleasant autumn colors make the poet fascinated. The word &quot;heavy&quot; reveals the poet&#39;s lingering mood and leads the whole poem. Writing about the autumn morning similarly, &quot;the clouds are clear and the dawn is flowing, and the palaces of the Han Dynasty are moving in the high autumn&quot; (Zhao Gu&#39;s &quot;Autumn View of Chang&#39;an&quot;), which expresses the sadness of seeing off the autumn; &quot;The white wild geese flying south are about to frost, the wind and rain are rustling and the Double Ninth Festival&quot; ( Lu Yuan&#39;s &quot;Chongjiu&quot;), there is a feeling of nostalgia for the country. However, Song Qi&#39;s sentence does not express sadness, but has a new attitude. This is also due to the poet&#39;s situation and temperament. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The second sentence is introduced by the word &quot;heavy&quot;. &quot;Gaotai re-account stationed in China&quot; is full of magnificence. It is also a &quot;high platform&quot;, a &quot;complex account&quot;, and a &quot;huaqie&quot;. The scene is magnificent and the atmosphere is warm, vivid and vivid. This is by no means a common people&#39;s climb, but a scene of wealthy people enjoying the autumn. The poet achieved great success at a young age and became prominent throughout his life. He served successively as Zhi Zhi Gao, Minister of the Ministry of Industry, and Imperial Academy Scholar. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The chin couplet follows the above, describing the good day and the meeting, with a vivid image. The first sentence and the couplet describe two scenes: climbing and drinking. The two words &quot;happy&quot; and &quot;drinking&quot; express the grand occasion of being full of guests and drinking wine. &quot;Let the wind fall before the hat&quot; is a useful allusion. &quot;Book of Jin·Biography of Meng Jia&quot;: &quot;Meng Jia joined the army for Huan Wen, and he traveled to Longshan for nine days. When the wind came, he blew his hat, and Wen ordered Sun Sheng to mock him.&quot; The ancients regarded this matter as a romantic event, but Du Fu once opposed it. And it is used as: &quot;I am ashamed to blow my hat with my short hair, but others are smiling and beautiful.&quot; (&quot;Cui&#39;s Village in Lantian in Nine Days&quot;) was highly appreciated by the people of the Song Dynasty. Song Qi also opposed Du&#39;s poems. One uses &quot;shame&quot; and the other uses &quot;live&quot;; one is depressed and the other is free and easy. It shows that the mood is different and the poetic state is also different. &quot;Strive to blow wine and put flowers on it&quot; means competing to drink chrysanthemum wine. Climbing mountains and drinking chrysanthemum wine during the Double Ninth Festival has been a traditional and elegant event since ancient times. The words &quot;Ren Luo&quot; and &quot;Zheng Chui&quot; are opposite to each other. The poet is in a state of great excitement. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The neck couplet is turned around, and it is written in the language of scenery, describing what it saw while climbing the mountain. The poet put his wine in the wind and wandered his eyes. He saw only the sky above and below, and it was clear and bright. &quot;The stream is clear and clear after the first rain, and the sun marks are light and not cloudy.&quot; After a lot of autumn rain, the sky is clear and the autumn appearance is light. The second sentence has a broad realm and a magnificent atmosphere. The characters &quot;Ming&quot; and &quot;Qing&quot; express the characteristics of the autumn morning. Its artistic conception is somewhat similar to Han Qi&#39;s &quot;Although the autumn appearance of the old garden is pale, it is also fragrant with the late festival fragrance of yellow flowers&quot; (&quot;Nine Days Water Pavilion&quot;). Qi of the Song Dynasty compiled Tang Shu for more than ten years. In his later years, he &quot;miweijinjing&quot; (&quot;Summary of the General Catalog of Sikuquanshu&quot;). He was &quot;erudite and able to write articles, with abundant talents. He loved to entertain and enjoy himself in being reserved. In his later years, he got to know Chengdu Prefecture and took the &quot;Book of Tang&quot; to be published and revised at this time... Viewers from far and near all know that Shangshu revised the Book of Tang. What an immortal.&quot; (&quot;Dongxuan Notes&quot;) The realm of this poem is related to his positive attitude towards life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The final couplet is full of writing power, becoming more and more exciting, and ends with a joyful mood and vivid image. The sentence &quot;The White-headed Prefect is really stupid&quot; is humorous and is a self-portrait of the poet, both in form and spirit. The word &quot;stupid&quot; is self-deprecating on the surface, but in reality it is reserved. &quot;Baitou Taishou&quot; not only depicts the poet&#39;s distinctive appearance, but also shows the poet&#39;s identity as a Taishou. It means that &quot;purchasing wine for nine days&quot; is not an ordinary climb, but a prefect&#39;s banquet. An air of wealth and nobility comes out of it, echoing the first couplet. The concluding sentence &quot;Manjia&quot; provides a footnote for &quot;Foolishness&quot;. The ancients had the custom of climbing up to high places and planting dogwood trees to suppress evil spirits. &quot;Xu Qixie Ji&quot;: &quot;Fei Changfang ordered Huan Jing to pack dogwood on September 9th to climb high to avoid disaster.&quot; The poet therefore used the exaggerated brushwork of &quot;full of dogwood&quot; to depict himself as bohemian, open-minded and cheerful. Du Mu&#39;s line &quot;You must go home with your head full of chrysanthemums&quot; (&quot;Climbing the Mountain in Nine Days&quot;) is a pretense of broad-minded speech and a forced smile; Du Fu&#39;s poem &quot;Cui Shizhuang in Lantian in Nine Days&quot; also ends with dogwood, &quot; &quot;Look carefully at the dogwood when you are drunk&quot; is a poignant statement, expressing the emotion of a wandering life. The reason why Song Qi&#39;s sentence is different is that his life experiences are different. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; This poem is elegant and fluent, and is skillfully written, especially the last couplet, which adds a comic atmosphere to the whole poem and a strong sense of life. It was a good time to enjoy the beautiful scenery and enjoy the things. The poet took the opportunity to turn it into a poem and wrote this interesting work. &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;About the author&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;div>;&lt;center>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://song.gushiwen.cn/authorImg/songqi.jpg&quot; width=50 %>;&lt;/center>;&lt;/div>;Song Qi (998-1061) was a writer of the Northern Song Dynasty. Zi Jing, born in Anlu, Anzhou (now Anlu, Hubei), later moved to Yongqiu, Kaifeng (now Qixian, Henan). In the second year of Tiansheng&#39;s reign, he was a Jinshi, a bachelor of the Imperial Academy, and a historian. Together with Ouyang Xiu and others, he compiled the &quot;New Book of Tang Dynasty&quot; and completed it. He became the Minister of the Ministry of Industry and became a scholar of Hanlin Academy. His posthumous title was Jingwen, and he had the same literary name as his elder brother Song Xiang, and was called the &quot;Second Song Dynasty&quot; at that time. The language of the poem is beautiful. Because the poem &quot;Spring in the Jade House&quot; contains the sentence &quot;Spring is stirring on the branches of red apricots&quot;, it is known as &quot;The Book of Red Apricots&quot; in the world. &lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 01 Oct 2023 07:23:05 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[出车 | 诗经·小雅·鹿鸣之什]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://feedx.net/read?r=shiwen&d=231012]]><description> &lt;h2>;Getting out of the cart&lt;/h2>;[Pre-Qin] The Book of Songs·Xiaoya·Lu Ming Zhishi&lt;div style=&quot;color: #5b4636;&quot;>;I got out of my cart and drove there. From the place of the emperor, it is said that I have come. Call the servant and call him Zai. The king&#39;s affairs are many and difficult, and maintaining them is extremely difficult. &lt;br />;I got out of my car and went to the suburbs. Set up this one and build that one. He is so sad, why is he so sad? Worry is quiet, and the servant is exhausted. &lt;br />;The king ordered Nan Zhong to go to the city in Fang. When we get out of the car, Pengpeng, the flag is flying. The emperor ordered me to go to the other side of the city. He is famous in Nanzhong, and he is in Xiang. &lt;br />;I have left in the past, and the millet and grass are blooming. Now I come to think about it, rain and snow carry the road. The king&#39;s affairs are many and difficult, so he should not hesitate to leave. Wouldn’t you like to return home? Fear this simple book. &lt;br />;The grassworms are buzzing, and the katydids are buzzing. I haven&#39;t seen the gentleman yet, so I am worried. Now that I see a gentleman, my heart drops. He was powerful in Nanzhong, but he was weak in attacking Xirong. &lt;br />;Spring is late and the flowers and trees are luxuriant. Kung Geng Jie Jie, mining Fan Qi Qi. He was found ugly when he was sentenced, but his words were returned. He is famous in Nanzhong, and he is in Yi. &lt;/div>;&lt;h3>;Translation and Notes&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Translation&lt;br />;&lt;/strong>;I was riding in a tall chariot to prepare for the expedition, while the front army was lined up and waiting on the outskirts of the capital. An order came from King Zhou&#39;s palace to obey the call of the country and come here. Call my servant Ma Bian to my side and tell them to get in the car and go to the front line together. In the troubled times of the country, security has become a major threat, and we must face the crisis and move forward bravely. &lt;br />;I rode in a tall chariot to prepare for the expedition, while the rear army lined up and waited at the gate of the capital. There are flags with patterns of turtles and snakes everywhere, and beautiful feathers are stuck on the top of the flags. Those big flags with turtles, snakes, eagles and falcons are all fluttering in the mighty wind. I am worried about my safety and my victory here, and Ma Bian&#39;s entourage is full of sorrow and worry. &lt;br />;The King of Zhou gave an order to General Nan Zhong and sent him to build a fortified city in the distant Shuofang. Many chariots were dispatched together, and the flags were flying in the sky, colorful and clear. Emperor Zhou issued a strict order to us and rushed to Shuofang to build a defensive city. The famous General Nan Zhong led his army to fight and defeated the 玁灁 in one fell swoop. &lt;br />;I remember that when I left home for a long journey, it was the time when millet, wheat, grains, and flowers were blooming. Now I finally embark on the long journey home, with heavy snowfall accompanying me along the muddy journey. The national security crisis is full of disasters and difficulties, and it is impossible to get a moment of rest and peace. Don’t we miss our hometown bitterly? It’s just that we respect the emperor’s edict. &lt;br />;Nameless insects hissed and sang in the grass, and grasshoppers jumped lightly on the grass tips. My wife has not seen me for a long time, and she looks worried and pitiful. You can imagine that when she sees me coming back, her eager and restless heart will be put to rest. The famous General Nan Zhong wiped out Xirong on his way back home. &lt;br />;The spring is bright and the sunshine is so warm, and the flowers, plants and trees are full of life and luxuriant. The oriole birds showed off their songs to their heart&#39;s content, and the pretty village girls picked sweet wormwood leisurely. Capture and interrogate the prisoner who had his left ear cut off. After packing up, he hurried home. The famous General Nan Zhong, come and wipe out the arrogant Yixi. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Notes&lt;br />;&lt;/strong>;Mu: a place outside the suburbs of the city. &lt;br />;Thorn: urgent. &lt;br />;旐 (zhào): a flag with a pattern of turtles and snakes. &lt;br />;Build: to erect.旄 (máo): a flag decorated with a yak tail on the flagpole. &lt;br />;旟 (yǔ): a flag with an eagle pattern. &lt;br />;旆（pèi）旆: The way the flag is flying. &lt;br />;Quietly: with a heavy heart. &lt;br />;Cuì: haggard from hard work. &lt;br />;Peng Peng: describes the numerous carriages and horses. &lt;br />;Flag (qí): a flag with a cross-dragon pattern and a bell. Yangyang: A clear look. &lt;br />;Hehe: A majestic appearance. &lt;br />;Xiang: It means &quot;stirring&quot; and calming down. remove. &lt;br />;Fang: Positive value. Hua: blooming, referring to the earing of millet in the poem. &lt;br />;Thinking: auxiliary words. &lt;br />;Yu (yù) snow: snowing. Tu: means &quot;road&quot;. &lt;br />;Not to mention: idle. Qiju: Sit down and rest. &lt;br />;Jian Shu: A document sent by the King of Zhou to send orders for expedition. &lt;br />;哓 (yāo)哓: The sound of insects. &lt;br />;趯(tì)趯: Jumping up and down.霜螜(zhōnɡ): grasshopper. &lt;br />;Gentleman: A man who goes to war with Zhong Zhong and others. &lt;br />;I: The person at home as imagined by the author.

Yi: sweep away. &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;Appreciation&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;p>; The choice of materials in the poem &quot;Xiaoya·Getting out of the Car&quot; is different from the poems that describe the war positively. The poet closely It captures the two key typical scenes of pre-war preparation and triumph, and highly summarizes a long-lasting war with frequent changes in space and location into a short poem. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The poet cleverly combined the carefully selected main plots such as ordering troops to build flags, cutting down the 玁狁, conquering the Xirong, and returning in triumph to present prisoners, etc., unifying the complicated threads into a chapter, and narrated it from different angles. Primary and secondary. It not only shows the entire development process of the event in an orderly manner, but also avoids the disadvantage of listing the events. This structure makes the poem neatly laid out, highlights the theme, and makes the poem twists and turns moving. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The first three chapters of the poem describe the preparations before the war, and the detailed descriptions adopt the technique of superimposing the depiction of the picture and the psychological suggestion. The first chapter says, &quot;I got out of my chariot and went to herd there; from where the emperor came, it was said that I had come.&quot; The four words &quot;getting out of my chariot&quot;, &quot;arriving to herd&quot;, &quot;passing the order&quot; and &quot;assembling&quot; are close in time and space, and extremely close in time. The coherent movements create an atmosphere of emergency mobilization before the war. The last two sentences use the words &quot;difficult&quot; and &quot;thorny&quot; to imply the psychological dignity and depression of the commander and his soldiers. The second chapter uses the &quot;旐&quot;, &quot;旄&quot;, &quot;flag&quot;, &quot;旟&quot; and &quot;旗旆&quot; standing under the sky to describe the awe-inspiring momentum of the army marching to the &quot;suburbs&quot;. At the end, &quot;quietly&quot; and &quot;conditionally exhausted&quot; are used to describe the anxious and nervous psychology of the soldiers during the rapid march to the front line. The third chapter recounts the grandeur of the military with the words &quot;Pengpeng came out of the chariot, and the flag was raised to the Yangyang&quot;. While correctly deploying the battle, the use of &quot;Hehe&quot; and &quot;Xiang&quot; hints at the author&#39;s confidence in winning the war. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The descriptive techniques used here make the first three chapters have both the grandeur of the rural pastoral oaths and the grandeur of the field march, as well as the meticulous psychological activities of the characters, achieving the overall and detailed, objective and realistic A clever combination of subjectivity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The last three chapters of the poem overcome the inherent shortcomings of poetry in narrative space, skipping the specific process of the war and directly describing the scene of the triumphant return. In this part, the poet avoids the truth and resorts to fiction, and dramatically uses a technique similar to the &quot;montage&quot; of modern movies to unexpectedly draw the reader&#39;s attention from the tense atmosphere to the first expedition of &quot;Millet Fanghua&quot;, and then to The dislocation of time and space caused by the comparison between the past and the past (&quot;I am gone in the past&quot; and &quot;I am thinking about today&quot;), and the long journey home from &quot;rain and snow&quot; to &quot;spring is late&quot;, guide readers to use their imagination to fill in the gap. An understanding of the length and hardship of the war. The transformation of the people in the family from the &quot;worry&quot; of &quot;having never seen the gentleman&quot; to the joy and peace of mind of &quot;having seen the gentleman&quot; also uses imagination to write about people&#39;s concern about the war and their suffering mentality from the other side. In the end, it naturally led to sincere joy at the victory and praise for the coach. On the surface, this kind of writing that avoids the truth and makes up for the fictitious seems to be a waste of time. However, because it contains the profound and subtle psychological changes of the participants from worry to joy, these seemingly &quot;idle&quot; descriptions of the scenes become the most important part of the poem. The background or externalization of the character&#39;s mind and emotions is more touching and delicate than the frontal description. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; There is something wonderful about the spatial composition of poetry. The whole poem depicts six scenes in different time and space, including ordering troops, erecting flags, setting off for the Northern Expedition, fighting in Xirong, feeling homesick on the way, and returning victoriously. The poet combines these unrelated scenes and plots with the help of emotional expression. , connect it through, and unfold a true and broad picture of ancient battles. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In addition, the poet absorbed lines from folk songs into his poems. The language has a simple and natural atmosphere, and the artistic conception has the beauty of blending scenes. &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;Creative background&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>; This is a poem by a warrior describing his expedition and triumphant return following the commander Nan Zhong. At that time, the enemies faced by the Western Zhou Dynasty were the Qixi in the north and the Kunyi in the west. In order to stabilize the dynasty, the Zhou Dynasty sent troops to conquer them many times. This expedition, with Nan Zhong as the commander, achieved brilliant results. This poem can be said to be a true record of this war. &lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;About the author&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 01 Oct 2023 04:23:05 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
