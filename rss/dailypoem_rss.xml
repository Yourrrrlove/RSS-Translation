(First work before plum blossom: plum blossom)&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;h3>;Translation and annotation&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Translation&lt;/strong>;&lt;br />;I heard that the plum blossoms on the mountain have already welcomed the plum blossoms. They bloom in the morning breeze, and from a distance, the plum trees on the surrounding mountains look like piles of white snow. &lt;br />;Is there any way to transform yourself into hundreds of millions of figures? Let there be a Lu You always in front of every plum tree. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Notes&lt;br />;&lt;/strong>;Wen Dao: Hearing and hearing. &lt;br />;Chè: to split.

It was written in January of 1202 AD (the second year of Jiatai) when Lu You retired to his hometown of Shanyin. Lu You was seventy-eight years old. At this time, it was the Southern Song Dynasty. Lu You was on the edge of political power and could not be reused by the establishment for a long time, but he did still have expectations in his heart. The author was inspired when he saw the plum blossoms. &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;Brief Analysis&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&amp;nbsp; The first sentence of this poem &quot;I heard the plum blossoms blowing in the morning wind, and the snow piles are all over the four mountains.&quot; It describes the scene of plum blossoms blooming. For example, the word &quot;坼xiaofeng&quot; in the first sentence highlights the proud attitude of plum blossoms that are not afraid of the severe cold; in the second sentence, the plum blossoms are compared to white snow, which not only describes the characteristics of plum blossoms&#39; pure whiteness, but also expresses the grand scene of plum blossoms all over the mountains and plains. . The language is clear and the scene is broad. And the three or four sentences &quot;How can I transform into hundreds of billions of people, just a plum blossom tree and a man blooming.&quot; It is even more unexpected, noble and refined. I would like to transform into hundreds of billions of land tourists, and there is a plum tree in front of each land travel, so that the obsessed My love for Mei was vividly expressed. &lt;p>; In the following two sentences, a sudden thought came to mind: &quot;How can one transform into hundreds of billions, one plum blossom and one plum blossom?&quot; This means, how can one use a method to transform into tens of millions of plum blossoms? Everyone is there to enjoy it. The idea of ​​being able to incarnate hundreds of billions of people is amazing. The plum blossoms correspond face to face with the poet. Who is Meyer? Who is he? It is difficult to tell easily at the moment. This is another peculiarity of the poet&#39;s life style. Although these two sentences are inspired by Liu Zongyuan&#39;s poetic meaning of &quot;If I could transform into hundreds of billions, I would spread out on the top of the mountain and look at my hometown&quot;, it is not appropriate to use them in the world of plum blossoms where &quot;snow piles are all over the mountains&quot;. Natural, and the scenes are very interesting. There are at least three reasons: As a 78-year-old poet, facing the sea of ​​flowers and trees in Meishan with different postures, of course he can&#39;t search for them one by one, so he can appreciate them in their incarnations. This is one of his wonderful ideas. In addition, although Lu You was old, his childlike innocence was still intact. He often attracted attention with his &quot;extraordinary&quot; behavior of &quot;plum blossoms weighing heavily on the brim of his hat, dragging his stick and singing songs in the spirit of immortality&quot;. At this time, he suddenly had a strange idea and wanted to imitate the immortal&#39;s behavior. The clone method is also inspired by childish innocence and is very consistent with psychology. This is the second one. Moreover, Lu You often compares himself with plum blossoms, and he always has a feeling of indifference among the best. Now facing thousands of plum blossoms in full bloom, the poet is naturally not willing to look up at them with his whole body. He has to transform into hundreds of billions to compete with them. Proportionate, Fang lives up to the poet&#39;s feelings for plum blossoms. Looking at these three aspects, although this sentence has reference points on the surface, if you deeply understand it, it is actually a sentence that reflects the situation. Just like Lin Bu inspired Jiang Wei to write the poem &quot;Plum Blossom&quot;, it has been re-created by the poet and integrated with the ancient poetry of Tao Zhu. And it comes from its own ideas and can come up with new ideas, making the poem more poetic and charming. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The first two sentences about plum blossoms serve as a foil for the last two sentences about people. Facing the wonderful scene of plum blossoms in full bloom, the poet suddenly had a whim and wished to transform into hundreds of billions of land tourists, and there would be a plum blossom tree in front of each of them. This rich and bold imagination vividly expresses the poet&#39;s love for plum blossoms, and also expresses the poet&#39;s elegant and refined character. Try to imagine the feeling of the last sentence in your mind, it can make people smile knowingly. &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;About the author&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;div>;&lt;center>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://song.gushiwen.cn/authorImg/luyou.jpg&quot; width=50 %>;&lt;/center>;&lt;/div>;Lu You (November 13, 1125 - January 26, 1210), named Wuguan, nicknamed Fangweng, Han nationality, was from Shanyin, Yuezhou (now Shaoxing, Zhejiang), Shangshu Right The grandson of Cheng Lu Dian, a writer, historian and patriotic poet of the Southern Song Dynasty. Lu You was born when the Northern Song Dynasty was overthrown, and he was deeply influenced by his family&#39;s patriotism when he was young.
