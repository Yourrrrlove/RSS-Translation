The Kun was so big that it was unknown how many thousands of miles away it was; when it turned into a bird, its name was Peng. The Peng&#39;s back is thousands of miles away, and it flies away in anger, its wings are like clouds hanging down from the sky. It is a bird, and the sea will migrate to Nanming. Nan Ming is also Tianchi. Those who are &quot;Qixie&quot; are also those who are ambitious and strange. &quot;Xie&quot; said: &quot;The Peng migrates to Nanming. The water hits three thousand miles, and the one that swings upward is ninety thousand miles away. It goes to breathe in six months.&quot; Wild horses are also dust, and living things breathe. Phase blow also. The sky is blue, is it righteous or evil? Is it so far away that it is extremely evil? It looks down upon it, and if so, that’s it. Moreover, if the accumulation of water is not thick, it will not be able to carry a large boat. Put a cup of water on the col hall, and the boat will be made of mustard; if you place the cup on top, it will be glued. The water is shallow and the boat is big. If the accumulation of wind is not thick, its large wings will be weak. Therefore, for ninety thousand miles, the wind is blowing down, and then it is today&#39;s Peifeng; those who carry the blue sky on their backs and do not care about Yaolan, then they are today&#39;s general Tunan. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Xu and Xuejiu laughed and said: &quot;I will rise and fly, grab the elm and Fang, and stop. The time will not come, and I will only control the ground. How can I go south for ninety thousand miles?&quot; &quot;Those who are suitable for the wilderness will have three meals, but their belly will still be full; those who are suitable for a hundred miles will be able to grind grain; those who are suitable for a thousand miles will gather grain in three months.&quot; How do you know about the two insects? (The first work of Qian Yu Fang: Qian Yu Fang)&lt;/p>;&lt;p>; Small knowledge is not as good as great knowledge, and small years are not as good as big ones. Xi Yi knows this? The bacteria in the morning don&#39;t know Hui Shuo, and the crickets don&#39;t know the spring and autumn. This is the young year. There are ghosts in the south of Chu who regard five hundred years as spring and five hundred years as autumn. In ancient times, there were people with big trees who regarded eight thousand years as spring and eight thousand years as autumn. This is also the new year. But Peng Zunai has heard about it for a long time now, and everyone is equal to it. How sad! &lt;/p>;&lt;p>; Tang Zhi also asked Jiji: &quot;To the north of Qiongfa, there is the Minghai, Tianchi. There is Yuyan, which is thousands of miles wide. No one knows how to cultivate it. His name is Kun. There is a bird, and its name is Peng. Its back is like Mount Tai, and its wings are like clouds hanging from the sky. It holds a sheep&#39;s horn and flies up ninety thousand miles away. Said: &#39;He is also arrogant? I jumped up, but only a few feet down, soaring among the basils, this is also flying. And he is arrogant?&#39;&quot; This is the debate between small and big. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;My old husband knows that he can serve as an official, his behavior can be compared with that of a village, his virtue can be matched with that of a king, and he can conquer a country, he thinks of himself, and this is the same. But Song Rongzi still laughed at it. And it is enough to praise him in the world without admonishing him, to criticize him in the world without discouraging him, to distinguish between internal and external, to argue about honor and disgrace. He is alive in this world, but it is impossible to count him. Although, there are still no trees. Fuliezi walked against the wind, calm and kind, and then turned around after five days. He has brought blessings to those who have not yet been counted. Although this is unnecessary, there is still something to be expected. If you take advantage of the righteousness of heaven and earth and guard against the debate of the six qi, and you want to swim infinitely, how can you treat him badly? Therefore, it is said: A perfect person has no self, a god has no merit, and a saint has no name. &lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;h3>;Translation and Notes&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Translation&lt;br />;&lt;/strong>; There is a fish in the North Sea, and its name is Kun. Kun is very huge, and it is unknown how many thousands of miles it is. Kun transformed into a bird, and its name was Peng. Peng&#39;s back is thousands of miles long; when it flaps its wings and flies straight up, its wings are like clouds hanging in the sky. This bird will migrate to the southern sea when strong winds blow the sea water. The sea in the south is a large natural pool. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>; The book &quot;Qixie&quot; is a book that records some weird things. The book records: &quot;When Peng migrates to the sea in the south, its wings beat on the water, stirring up waves of three thousand miles, flying around the whirlwind to an altitude of ninety thousand miles, and leaving with the strong winds of June.&quot; Like a wild horse galloping. The same wandering air and flying dust are all caused by the breath of various creatures in nature. The sky is vast and vast, perhaps it is the true color of heaven? Is its vastness and loftiness also endless? When Peng looked down, he should have seen something like this. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>; If the collected water is not deep, then it will not have the strength to carry a large ship. Pour a glass of water into the low-lying area in front of the hall, and a small piece of grass can be regarded as a boat. If you put a cup on it, it will stick to it. This is the reason why the water is shallow but the boat is big. If the gathering wind is not strong enough, then there will be no power to carry a huge wing. Therefore, Peng flew at an altitude of 90,000 miles, with the wind beneath him. With the force of the wind, it carried the blue sky on its back without any obstruction, and then began to fly south. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>; The cicada and the little turtle dove laughed at Xiaopeng and said: &quot;We fly hard and stop when we encounter elm and sandalwood trees. Sometimes we can&#39;t fly up and just fall to the ground. Why fly 90,000 miles to the South China Sea? What?&quot; People who go to the suburbs only bring three meals of food for the day, and they come back full. People who go to a hundred miles away have to spend a whole night pounding rice to prepare dry food; people who go to thousands of miles away have to prepare food in advance. Three months to prepare food. What do these two little insects and birds, the cicada and the little turtle dove, know? &lt;/p>;&lt;p>; Small wisdom is not as good as great wisdom, and short life is not as good as long life. How do you know this is the case? Juncao, which lives and dies, does not know night and dawn. The cicada that lives in the summer and dies in the autumn does not know the time of a year. This is short-lived. There is a big tree in the south of Chu State called Ming Ling. It regards five hundred years as one spring and five hundred years as one autumn. In ancient times, there was a tree called Dachun, which regarded eight thousand years as one spring and eight thousand years as one autumn. This is longevity. However, Peng Zu, who lived for more than 700 years, is still particularly famous for his longevity. When most people talk about longevity, they would cite Peng Zu as a comparison. Isn&#39;t it sad? &lt;/p>;&lt;p>; Shang Tang asked Ji about the same thing: &quot;In the far north where no vegetation grows, there is a deep sea, which is Tianchi. There is a fish in it, and its body is thousands of miles across. Wide, no one knows how long it is, its name is Kun. There is a bird, its name is Peng. Peng&#39;s back is like Mount Tai, and its wings are like clouds in the sky; it spirals ninety thousand miles up in the whirlwind, surpassing the clouds , carrying the blue sky on its back, and then flying south, about to fly to the South China Sea. The sparrows in Ozawa laughed at Peng and said, &quot;Where is it going to fly? I flew up as soon as I jumped, but fell down after only a few feet. Hovering among the bushes, this is also an excellent flight. And where is it going to fly?&#39;&quot; This is the difference between small and large. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>; Therefore, those who are talented and capable of fulfilling the duties of an official, whose behavior can protect the people of a village, whose virtue can please a king, and whose ability can win the trust of the whole country, they regard themselves as mentioned above. Like that little bird. Song Rongzi laughed at such people. Song Rongzi was praised by everyone in the world, but he was not particularly diligent because of it. Even though everyone in the world criticized him, he was not depressed because of it. He determines the appropriateness between himself and external objects, and clearly distinguishes the boundaries between honor and disgrace, and feels that this is all. He didn&#39;t pursue everything in the world desperately. Even so, he still has a realm he has yet to reach. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>; Liezi rode on the wind, feeling at ease and at ease. He returned fifteen days later; he did not pursue the matter of seeking blessings desperately. Although this eliminates the need for walking, it still has some advantages. If he complies with the nature of everything in the world, controls the changes of the six qi, and travels through infinite realms, what else will he rely on? Therefore, it is said that the most highly cultivated people can let nature take its course and forget themselves; those who have cultivated themselves to the level of deification and unpredictable events have no intention of seeking merit; and saints with moral knowledge have no intention of seeking fame. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Notes&lt;br />;&lt;/strong>;Ming: Tongxiao &quot;溟&quot; refers to the deep black color of the sea. &quot;Bei Ming&quot;, Beihai.

A creative method based on fables. &quot;Zhuangzi&quot; claims that its creative method is &quot;to use 卮yan as the main source, to use tautology as the truth, and to use fables as the broad&quot;. Fables are the main way of expression. Many articles use fables as the backbone of the article. A large number of fables are used to make the composition of &quot;Zhuangzi&quot; scattered, intermittent, endlessly changing, and elusive. For example, the first half of &quot;Xiaoyaoyou&quot; spares no effort in writing and uses a lot of fables and tautology to exaggerate and exaggerate. The content from Kunpeng spreading his wings to Liezi walking on the wind is not the main theme of the work, but &quot;A perfect person has no self, a saint has no merit, and a god has no merit.&quot; The title sentence &quot;Unnamed&quot; is like a dragonfly touching water, passing by in one stroke. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; 2. Unexpected imagination and fiction. The fables in &quot;Zhuangzi&quot; show extraordinary imagination and form a unique world of images, &quot;unexpected and strange in writing&quot;. The imagination and fiction of &quot;Zhuangzi&quot; often transcend the limitations of time and space and the distinction between things and myself, and are strange, fantastic, and ever-changing. For example, in &quot;Xiaoyaoyou&quot;, the fish in Beiming turns into a roc, &quot;flying in anger, its wings are like clouds hanging from the sky&quot;. The strange imagination of &quot;Zhuangzi&quot; is to express its philosophical thoughts. Combining truth with creation and reality with mystery are the main features of &quot;Zhuangzi&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; 3. Debate with a strange image. 1. Use metaphors and symbols instead of logical reasoning. 2. Less direct expression of one&#39;s own opinions and attitudes, but allowing readers to experience and understand from strange, absurd and vivid fables. For example, at the end of &quot;Xiaoyaoyou&quot;, Zhuangzi adds another fable to the fable, using &quot;the medicine that does not make trouble&quot; to illustrate the &quot;difference of use&quot;, and what is useless becomes useful. &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;Explanation&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;p>; &quot;Xiaoyao&quot; is also written as &quot;Xiaoyao&quot;, which means to travel leisurely and contentedly; &quot;Xiaoyaoyou&quot; means to be free and free without any restrictions. Move freely. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The full text can be divided into three parts. The first part to &quot;The Nameless Saint&quot; is the main body of this article. By comparing many examples of people who cannot be &quot;free&quot;, it is shown that in order to truly achieve the state of freedom, one must &quot;No self&quot;, &quot;no merit&quot;, &quot;no name&quot;. The second part to &quot;Xiaoran loses his world&quot; follows the previous part and further elaborates, explaining that &quot;selflessness&quot; is the only way to get rid of all kinds of constraints and dependence. As long as you truly forget yourself and everything, you can achieve freedom. Only those who are &quot;selfless&quot; are the ones with the highest spiritual realm. The remaining part is the third part, which discusses what is truly useful and useless, explaining that we should not be stagnate by things, but should make use of the useless, further expressing our opposition to actively participating in social activities, and our ambition to pursue a leisurely and contented life without any restraint. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; This chapter is one of the representative chapters of &quot;Zhuangzi&quot; and a famous chapter among hundreds of philosophers. It is full of peculiar imagination and romantic color, and contains reasoning in fables and vivid metaphors, forming a unique style. &quot;Happy wandering&quot; is also an important aspect of Zhuangzi&#39;s philosophical thought. The whole article repeatedly elaborates on the idea of ​​having no basis to rely on and pursues absolute freedom in the spiritual world. In Zhuangzi&#39;s eyes, everything in objective reality, including human beings themselves, are antagonistic and interdependent. This means there is no absolute freedom. If you want to have nothing to rely on, you must have no self. Therefore, he hopes that everything will follow nature and transcend reality, deny all human roles in social life, and mix human life with the survival of all things; he advocates not being stuck in things and pursuing unconditional spiritual freedom. &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;Content analysis&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>; This article uses fables skillfully, the writing style is varied, and it is full of romanticism. The idea advocated by Zhuangzi is to be quiet and do nothing, and to live in peace and prosperity. . His explanation of the world&#39;s size, nobility, longevity, right and wrong, gains and losses, honor and disgrace, etc. is relativistic. His ideological attitude towards society and life, whether negative or inspiring, has a profound impact on future generations. He despised the society in which &quot;those who steal hooks will be punished and those who steal the country will be martyrs&quot;, refused to cooperate with the rulers, despised wealth and wealth, and denied the existence of ghosts and gods. These all have positive meanings and are worthy of recognition. However, his delusional thought of escaping reality and pursuing unconditional spiritual freedom was a negative and impossible to achieve absolute subjective idealist view at that time or now. &lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;About the author&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;div>;&lt;center>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://song.gushiwen.cn/authorImg/zhuangzhou.jpg&quot; width=50%>;&lt;/ center>;&lt;/div>;Zhuangzi (about 369 BC - about 286 BC), surnamed Zhuang and given name Zhou, was a Mongolian native of the Song Dynasty during the Warring States Period. A representative figure of the Taoist school in the middle of the Warring States Period, a thinker, philosopher, writer, and the founder of Zhuangxue. Together with Laozi, he was known as &quot;Laozi and Zhuangzi&quot;. The earliest proposed idea of ​​&quot;inner sage and outer king&quot; had a profound influence on Confucianism. Having an insight into the theory of changes, it is pointed out that &quot;Yi is based on Yin and Yang&quot;, and its idea of ​​&quot;three sounds&quot; is consistent with the three talents in &quot;Yi Jing&quot;. His writing is extremely imaginative, he uses language freely and flexibly, and he can express subtle and difficult-to-speak philosophies in a fascinating way. His representative work is &quot;Zhuangzi&quot;, among which famous articles include &quot;Xiaoyaoyou&quot;, &quot;Equality of Things&quot;, &quot;Yangshengzhu&quot;, etc. His works are called &quot;philosophy of literature, literature of philosophy&quot;. It is said that Zhuangzi lived in seclusion in Nanhua Mountain and was buried in Nanhua Mountain. Therefore, Emperor Xuanzong of the Tang Dynasty was named Nanhua Zhenren by imperial edict, and his book &quot;Zhuangzi&quot; was regarded as &quot;Nanhua Zhenjing&quot;. &lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 20 Oct 2023 05:23:08 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[秋江晓望 | 皮日休]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://feedx.net/read?r=shiwen&d=2310201]]><description> &lt;h2>;Autumn River Xiaowang&lt;/h2>;[Tang Dynasty] Pi Rixiu&lt;div style=&quot;color: #5b4636;&quot;>;The vast lake and sky are blue, and one star is flying like a white egret. &lt;br />;At this time, let go of your hopes and never get tired of being a wanderer. &lt;/div>;&lt;h3>;Translation and annotations&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Translation&lt;br />;&lt;/strong>;At dawn, the sky is clear and the water is clear.

In the Tang Dynasty, he served successively as military judge of Suzhou (&quot;History of Wu and Yue&quot;), Zuo Lang, Dr. Taichang, and deputy envoy of Piling. Later, he participated in the Huangchao Uprising, or was said to be &quot;trapped among thieves&quot; (&quot;Tang Caizi Biography&quot;), and served as a Hanlin bachelor.
