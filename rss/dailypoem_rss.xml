Although the jade is small, it is very precious. &lt;br />;I know I have no intention of competing with the autumn light, so I go to make offerings in the cold weather across the window. &lt;br />;Recalling my first visit to the capital of the Emperor, thousands of these trees were planted in the Western Wall. &lt;br />;I would like to be granted the title of Pei from today, and there will be thousands of families in Zhuya. &lt;br />;The autumn fragrance will live up to the heaven and earth, I hope the flute and flute will be in chaos. &lt;br />;Although I have come back, I want to return to power, so don’t disobey me lightly. &lt;br />;In the future, I will pick flowers and drink under the forest. Who will look at the clear frost and the green light? &lt;/div>;&lt;h3>;Translation and annotations&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;① Chrysanthemum: According to the local records in Volume 8 of &quot;Zhengde Qiongtai Chronicle&quot;: &quot;Chrysanthemums are the most common, with similar leaves but different colors.

When the chrysanthemums bloom, it is the Double Ninth Festival. It does not need to be separated by the sun and the moon. The chrysanthemums bloom in early October. This is especially true in Hainan.&quot;&lt;br />;② Haipu: seaside. &lt;br />;③ Double Ninth Festival: the name of the festival. The ninth day of the ninth lunar month is called &quot;Double Ninth Festival&quot;, also known as &quot;Chongjiu&quot; and &quot;Duanyang Festival&quot;.

The wind blew his hat off, but Meng Jia didn&#39;t notice it. Huan Wen ordered Sun Sheng to write an essay to ridicule him, and Jia responded with his pen. His essay was very beautiful. See &quot;Jin Shu·Meng Jia Biography&quot;. Later, &quot;dropping one&#39;s hat&quot; was used as an allusion to climbing during the Double Ninth Festival. &lt;br />;⑦ Zhuya: Hainan Island has expanded its territory since the Han Dynasty and established two counties, Zhuya and Dan&#39;er. Later it was also used as another name for Hainan Island. &lt;br />;⑧ Qiankun: the names of two hexagrams in &quot;The Book of Changes&quot;.

Li Bai&#39;s poem &quot;Going down Zhongnan Mountain and passing Husi Mountain where people stay and buy wine&quot;: &quot;But looking at the path from where I came, the green is slightly green.&quot; &lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;Appreciation&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>; Hu Quan was demoted to Yazhou. It was the Double Ninth Festival, and the governor asked him for poems. However, the climate in Hainan was different, and the chrysanthemums were not in bloom at the end of the season. I am not uninterested in spending the holiday sightseeing, it is just a perfunctory entertainment. I remember that the chrysanthemums were in full bloom every Double Ninth Festival in the capital, and it was so lively to enjoy the flowers and write poems, so I suddenly felt like returning to Kyoto to serve the country. This poem expresses Hu Quan&#39;s feelings of thinking more about his family and country during festive seasons. &lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;About the author&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;div>;&lt;center>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://song.gushiwen.cn/authorImg/huquan.jpg&quot; width=50%>;&lt;/ center>;&lt;/div>;Hu Quan (1102-1180), named Bangheng and Danan.

The desolate evening scene makes Song Yu feel desolate. The water is gentle and the wind is gentle, the apple blossoms are getting older, the moon is cold and the dew is cold, and the phoenix leaves are turning yellow. Feeling sad. Where is the old friend? The smoke and water are vast. &lt;br />;Unforgettable, we have a wine party, a few lonely romances, many times changing into stars and frost. The sea is vast and the mountains are far away, and it is unknown where Xiaoxiang is. Thinking of the two swallows, it is difficult to rely on distant faith, pointing to the dusk sky and empty consciousness to return home. Looking at each other sadly. In the sound of broken Hong, the setting sun rises. &lt;/div>;&lt;h3>;Translation and Notes&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Translation&lt;br />;&lt;/strong>;I quietly leaned on the railing and stared, the rain had stopped, the clouds had dispersed, and I watched The autumn colors fade into the horizon. In the autumn evening, the scenery is bleak and desolate, which really makes people sigh with Song Yu&#39;s sorrow for autumn. The gentle breeze blows over the water, and the white apple blossoms gradually wither and fade. The cool moon freezes the dew. The sycamore tree cannot withstand the invasion of the cold dew on the moonlit night, and its leaves have withered and turned yellow. This situation makes one feel lonely and sentimental. My old friends, where are you? All I can see in front of me is the endless autumn water, and the smoke is confusing. &lt;br />;The elegant gathering of literati and the indulgent feast are still vivid and unforgettable. After parting, we have let down so many romantic moments, and the stars have passed, all because of the distance between you and me, separated by the sky. The sea is so far away, the mountains are so far away, I don’t know where and what year we meet? It makes people feel miserable and hesitant. Thinking of the swallows flying away in pairs, it is difficult to rely on them to send messages and messages to old friends; looking forward to the return of old friends, pointing to the vast sky and identifying the returning ships, who knows that all the thousands of sails have failed, and it is also a vain hope. I stood silently, looking at each other sadly, only to see that the setting sun had faded, and the mournful cry of the lone wild goose was still floating in the sky. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Notes&lt;/strong>;&lt;br />;Jade Butterfly, the name of the brand. This tune has two types: Xiaoling and long tune. The Xiaoling was created by Wen Tingyun of the Tang Dynasty. It is a double tune. The upper part has four lines, rhymed with Sanping rhyme, twenty-one characters; the lower part has four lines, rhymed with Sanping rhyme, twenty-one characters, a total of four Eleven words. The long tune originated from Liu Yong of the Song Dynasty, also known as &quot;Jade Butterfly Slow&quot;. It has a double tune, ninety-nine characters, and a flat rhyme. There are also ninety-eight fonts. &lt;br />;The rain has stopped and the clouds have dispersed: the rain has stopped and the clouds have dispersed. &lt;br />;Desolate: cold and scattered, sparse. Kan: Okay. &lt;br />;Song Yu&#39;s desolation: refers to Song Yu&#39;s &quot;Nine Bian&quot;, which is extended to the sad autumn. Song Yu&#39;s &quot;Nine Bian&quot; said: &quot;What a tragedy! Autumn is the air, and the grass and trees are bleak and decaying!&quot;&lt;br />;Apple blossom: a kind of duckweed with small white flowers in summer and autumn. &lt;br />;Sentiment: sad. Send: make. &lt;br />;Literary wine party: a gathering where literati meet to drink wine and compose poems. Period: approx. &lt;br />;Jigu Fengyue: I have let down so many beautiful scenery. Ji: How many times. Gu: means &quot;to live up to&quot;, to let down. Fengyue: beautiful scenery. &lt;br />; Repeated changes in star frost: It has been several years. Star Frost: A star has one day every year, and frost falls every year. Therefore, it is called one star frost per year, and it is also used as a metaphor for the year and month. &lt;br />;Xiaoxiang: Another name for Xiangjiang River. This refers to the place where the person you miss lives. &lt;br />;Mutian: evening. &lt;br />;Empty: in vain. Return: A ship returning. &lt;br />;Standing under the setting sun: Standing under the setting sun in the evening for a long time until the sun sets. &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;Appreciation&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;p>; This poem is mainly lyrical, integrating scenery and narrative, recalling the past and nostalgia, travel and farewell, time and space. It forms a complete artistic whole with strong artistic appeal. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;Looking at the place where the rain has gathered and the clouds have broken down&quot; is a description of the scenery that can be seen with the naked eye. You can see the traces of the changing wind and clouds in the distance, making the autumn scenery even more sparse. The four words &quot;quietly by the lantern&quot; describe the worries of leaning alone in the lantern and looking into the distance. This kind of feeling is again based on &quot;watching the autumn light&quot;. &quot;Quietly&quot;, looking sad. Facing the desolate autumn scenery at dusk, it is natural to feel the sadness of autumn and think of the poet Song Yulai, the ancestor of the eternal sadness of autumn. &quot;The evening scene is desolate and desolate, which makes Song Yu feel desolate.&quot; The following sentence summarizes this feeling. Song Yu&#39;s sad autumn feelings and emotions about life experience all rushed into Liu Yong&#39;s heart and resonated with him. He suppressed thousands of thoughts, looked from far to near, selected the things that best expressed the characteristics of the autumn scenery, and made detailed descriptions. &quot;The water breeze is gentle, the apple blossoms are growing old, the moon dew is cold, and the phoenix leaves are floating yellow.&quot; The two sentences seem to be a very poetic picture taken with a close-up lens: I saw the autumn wind gently blowing on the water surface, and the white apple blossoms were blooming. The flowers are getting older. In autumn, when the moon is cold and the dew is cold, the sycamore leaves turn yellow and are gently floating down leaf by leaf. The desolate and rustling autumn night naturally gives people a sense of desolation and silence. The words &quot;light&quot; and &quot;cold&quot; describe the feeling of autumn. &quot;The apple blossoms grow old&quot; not only describes the scenery before the eyes, but also embodies the poet&#39;s feelings about the world and the growing beauty. The word &quot;yellow&quot; in &quot;The Wu leaves are falling yellow&quot; is used well, highlighting the image of the falling Wu leaves. The word &quot;gone with the wind&quot; has a sound, and the word &quot;yellow&quot; has a color. The word &quot;gone with the yellow&quot; is written in a vivid and colorful way. The word &quot;yellow&quot; exaggerates the atmosphere and embellishes the autumn scenery. The author captures the most typical autumn scenery such as water wind, apple blossoms, moon dew, and phoenix leaves, and uses the four words &quot;light&quot;, &quot;old&quot;, &quot;cold&quot; and &quot;yellow&quot; to highlight it, interweaving it into a deserted and lonely autumn scene. The pictures of objects fully pave the way for the following lyricism. The sentence &quot;removing feelings and hurting&quot; comes from the description of the scenery above. From the scenery to the feelings, there is a turning point in the word. After describing the scenery, the poet introduces the two sentences &quot;Where is the old friend, the smoke and water are vast&quot;, which not only connects the previous and the following, but also unifies the whole article, which is the main theme of the whole poem. &quot;The vastness of smoke and water&quot; refers to the misty and invisible scenery, which is vast and rich. It is also the confused emotion caused by missing the old friend. Here, emotion and scenery are intertwined. These few sentences are short and solemn, saturated with large strokes, full of ups and downs of emotion, and are the essence of the whole article. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The word &quot;unforgettable&quot; in the change of head evokes memories and expresses the feeling of missing the old friend, which is ups and downs and well-proportioned. The poet recalled the &quot;Wenqi Drinking Party&quot; when he was with his friends. It was a pleasant event that is still unforgettable. After the separation, things have changed, the stars have changed, the autumn light has changed several times, and I don’t know how many beautiful moments have passed in vain because I didn’t care to watch them. &quot;Several orphans&quot; and &quot;repeated changes&quot; refer to the long separation and are intended to strengthen the feeling of sadness after separation. The sentence &quot;The sea is vast and the mountains are far away&quot; turns from memories to the thoughts in front of me. &quot;Xiaoxiang&quot; here refers to the place where friends live. Since I don&#39;t know where my old friend is, it is said that &quot;I don&#39;t know where Xiaoxiang is.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;Thinking of the two swallows, it is difficult to rely on distant faith, pointing to the dusk sky, and returning to the sky.&quot; It writes about the helpless mood caused by not being able to meet the person I miss. The swallows flying in front of you cannot deliver news to old friends, so if you want to communicate with friends, no one can trust you. Looking forward to the return of friends, but failed again and again, so the saying &quot;refers to the dusk sky, and the empty consciousness returns home&quot;. This sentence expresses the deep and sincere feelings of missing a friend with great affection. Seeing Guizhou in the sky, I suspected that it was an old friend returning, but in the end it was a misunderstanding. Guizhou was just an in vain to arouse lovesickness, as if mocking his own infatuation. The word &quot;empty&quot; brings to life the feeling of eagerly awaiting the return of friends. It pushes the feeling of missing friends to the climax and climax. The poet thinks about the other person and writes from the other person&#39;s perspective, thus reflecting his own feelings of wandering and wandering for many years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Following &quot;looking at each other sadly&quot;, the pen turns back to itself. The poet uses Duanhong&#39;s wail to set off his loneliness and melancholy, which can be described as a wonderful combination of boundless beauty and a sad voice. The four words &quot;standing up to the setting sun&quot; draw the image of the lyrical protagonist. He stands in the sunset for a long time, as if in a daze, and his emotions are completely immersed in memories and longing. The two words &quot;Li Jin&quot; mean standing on the railing for a long time, thinking deeply about people far away, thus making the unbearable hardship of traveling alone appear outside the words. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Yong&#39;s poem has clear layers, complete structure and smooth context, which effectively conveys the rhythm of the poet&#39;s emotions. At the same time, the rhetoric is neither polished nor frivolous, but elegant in the vulgar, strange in the ordinary, meaningful and meaningful, so it can be appreciated by both refined and popular people. &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;Creative background&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;p>; The poem &quot;Jade Butterfly·Watching the Rain and Gathering the Clouds&quot; was written by the author in memory of his old friends in central Hunan. &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;About the author&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;div>;&lt;center>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://song.gushiwen.cn/authorImg/liuyong2.jpg&quot; width=50 %>;&lt;/center>;&lt;/div>;Liu Yong (about 984-about 1053) was a famous poet in the Northern Song Dynasty and a representative of the graceful school.
