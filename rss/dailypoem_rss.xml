She should go Her thatched cottage on Lushan Mountain. &lt;br />;She is crushing mica with water to make elixirs. There must be heather growing in the thatched cottage. &lt;br />;If you like her quiet place, you might as well stay and practice with her. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The good wife is the descendant of the prime minister, and also likes to learn Taoism and practice magic. &lt;br />;The delicate white hands tease the green mist, and the embroidered clothes float with purple smoke. &lt;br />;As soon as you arrive at Lushan Pingfengdian, you can hold a white jade whip and fly on a crane with Taoist Master Tengkong. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Notes&lt;/strong>;&lt;br />;⑴Inside: refers to the wife. &lt;br />;⑵With a jade whip: One is &quot;without a whip&quot;. &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;Appreciation&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;p>; Li Bai walked out from the hustle and bustle of the world and came to the screen folding of Lushan Mountain with green mountains and green forests. &quot;Water pounded the mica, and the wind swept away the heather&quot; is an exquisite landscape painting that adds mystery and elegance to the trip. The poet&#39;s emotions changed from bold and unbridled to gentle, showing the artistic mentality of &quot;everything comes from and enters the machine&quot;, which comes from nature and returns to nature. So he wrote without any ambiguity: &quot;If it is good to live in seclusion, I invite you to play with Zixia.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Tengkong is the daughter of Li Linfu, the Prime Minister of the Tang Dynasty. She is extremely intelligent and very beautiful. However, she did not admire glory and wealth, but she was obsessed with learning Taoism. She came from Chang&#39;an, Kyoto, to live in seclusion in Mount Lu, and lived a life of poverty, which shows the strong admiration for Taoism in the Tang Dynasty. &quot;The bare hands are holding the green mist, and the robes are trailing the purple smoke.&quot; A few strokes of the pen highlight the image of a prime minister woman with a pure heart and no filth, a nature that is not corrupted by worldly desires, and a quiet Taoist image. If a person has no pursuit of worldly desires, glory and profit, the best destination is to &quot;go to the screen, ride on the luan and hold the jade whip.&quot; Li Bai&#39;s wife is also a prime minister, so some people think that the second song &quot;Many Queens and Prime Minister Women&quot; refers to Li Bai&#39;s wife. Li Bai and his wife, like Li Tengkong, longed for the fairyland life of being free from worldly affairs and immortality, and &quot;knowing that nothing can be done about it&quot; (Guan Yinzi&#39;s &quot;Cauldron&quot;). &quot;Be at ease as if you were destined&quot; (Zhuangzi&#39;s &quot;Human World&quot;) as one&#39;s own attitude towards life. &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;Creative background&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>; Li Bai once accompanied his wife to find Li Tengkong, a female Taoist priest in Lushan Mountain, who climbed many mountains and crossed steep mountains. At that time, I wrote the poem &quot;Two Poems for the Female Taoist Priest Li Tengkong in Lushan Mountain&quot; based on my feelings. &lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;About the author&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;div>;&lt;center>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://song.gushiwen.cn/authorImg/libai.jpg&quot; width=50%>;&lt;/ center>;&lt;/div>;Li Bai (701-762), also known as Taibai, also known as Qinglian Jushi, also known as &quot;Exiled Immortal&quot;, was a great romantic poet in the Tang Dynasty. He was hailed as the &quot;Poetry Immortal&quot; by later generations, and was the same as Du Fu They are collectively known as &quot;Li Du&quot;. In order to distinguish them from the other two poets Li Shangyin and Du Mu, who are known as &quot;Little Li Du&quot;, Du Fu and Li Bai are also collectively known as &quot;Big Li Du&quot;. According to the &quot;New Book of Tang&quot; records, Li Bai was the ninth grandson of Emperor Xingsheng (Liang Wuzhao King Li Hao) and the same clan as the kings of Li and Tang Dynasties. He is a cheerful and generous person who loves drinking, writing poetry, and making friends. Li Bai was deeply influenced by Huang Lao Liezhuang&#39;s thoughts. The &quot;Collection of Li Taibai&quot; has been handed down from generation to generation. Most of his poems were written when he was drunk. His representative works include &quot;Looking at Lushan Waterfall&quot;, &quot;The Road is Difficult&quot;, &quot;The Road to Shu is Difficult&quot;, &quot;About Drinking&quot; and &quot;Early Morning&quot;. &quot;Fa Baidi City&quot; and so on. &lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 18 Sep 2023 04:23:08 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[六么令·次韵和贺方回金陵怀古鄱阳席上作 | 李纲]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://feedx.net/read?r=shiwen&d=239171]]><description> &lt;h2>;Liu Moring Ciyun and He Fang returned to Jinling to write at the Poyang banquet in nostalgia for the past&lt;/h2>;[Song Dynasty] Li Gang&lt;div style=&quot;color: #5b4636;&quot;>;The Yangtze River is thousands of miles away, and the mist and fresh water are vast. The song sinks into the jade trees, and there are sparse bells and hair in the ancient temple. The rise and fall of the six generations is like a dream, and Ran Ran is shocked by the time and the moon. The war was destroyed. Luxury items are sold out, and silver toads are rarely seen. &lt;br />;The ebb and flow create waves, and the trees in the river are as dense as hair. Whoever wants to move back will damage the boss&#39;s reputation. Even if the years are cold and the journey is far away, this ambition should be difficult to capture. Who builds tall buildings? Leaning on the lantern and gazing, the independent fisherman is full of snow in the river. &lt;/div>;&lt;h3>;Translation and annotations&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;Appreciation&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;p>; To understand Li Gang’s thoughts and feelings in this poem, we must first understand him Have a general understanding of their political stance and life experiences. Li Gang firmly advocated resisting the Jin Dynasty throughout his life and was one of the famous representatives of the Anti-Japanese War faction. As early as the seventh year of Xuanhe, when the Jin soldiers invaded and Song Huizong panicked and was eager to escape, Li Gang stabbed his arm and wrote a letter in blood, urging resistance to the war. Emperor Qinzong of the Song Dynasty appointed Li Gang as the Minister of War, and later as Minister Youcheng. In the first year of Jingkang (1126), Jin soldiers besieged Bianjing. Li Gang appointed Shangshu Youcheng as his personal camp envoy. He &quot;climbed to the city to supervise the battle, killed thousands of people, and then retreated.&quot; (&quot;Da Jin Guo Zhi&quot;) The Lord He sent Li Bangyan and others to depose Li Gang to thank the Jin people. When Emperor Gaozong of the Southern Song Dynasty came to the throne, he once appointed Li Gang as prime minister. Li Gang actively prepared for war and the enemy did not dare to attack. Later, because Emperor Gaozong listened to the capitulation faction&#39;s slander, Li Gang only reigned for seventy-five days and was dismissed and reviled. In the second year of Shaoxing (1132), he was appointed as the envoy of Hunan Xuanfu and also knew Tanzhou, and moved to Hongzhou. Although he was appointed in his later years, he was appointed as a foreign official and had no right to interfere in the government affairs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; From Li Gang&#39;s life experience, it can be seen that with the fierce conflict between the imperial court and the war, he set off huge waves in his official career, and he also rose and fell in these ups and downs. A patriotic enthusiasm of loyalty and resentment is poured into the words. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; This song &quot;Liu Mo Ling&quot; was probably written after Li Gang was demoted in the early days of the southern crossing. By using Jinling to recall the past, I can express my resentment that my ambitions are hard to achieve and my determination to resist the Jinling resolutely. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The first film is about nostalgia for Jinling. &quot;The Yangtze River is thousands of miles away, and the fresh water is full of smoke and clouds are vast.&quot; The Yangtze River is thousands of miles away, rolling eastward. Looking around, the river is broad and the clouds are low. Du Fu once lamented that &quot;the endless Yangtze River is rolling in&quot; (&quot;Deng Gao&quot;). Su Shi also said, &quot;The wanderers have collected all the romantic figures of the ages&quot; (&quot;Niannujiao&quot;). Li Gang couldn&#39;t help but feel nostalgic about the past. &quot;The song is silent in the Yushu, and there are sparse bells in the ancient temple.&quot; &quot;Flowers in the Backyard of the Yushu&quot; created by Queen Chen of the Southern Dynasty, the song has long since fallen silent and can no longer be heard. All that was heard was the sparse bells of the ancient temple, echoing over the thousands of miles of Yangtze River. &quot;Flowers in the Backyard of Yushu&quot; is a representative of the obscene music at that time. The silence of singing marked the demise of the Chen Dynasty. Several pestles and clocks, intermittent and intermittent, exaggerate the lonely and desolate nostalgic atmosphere, arouse people&#39;s feeling of &quot;thinking about the leisurely time of heaven and earth&quot; (Chen Zi&#39;ang&#39;s &quot;Deng Youzhou Terrace&quot;), and constitute a specific situation in terms of time and space. Back then, the Wu, Eastern Jin, Song, Qi, Liang, and Chen dynasties all had their capitals in Jiankang (Jinling, today&#39;s Nanjing City), and the capital of Zuo was relatively short-lived. The Six Dynasties had one thing in common: their monarchs had no ambitions, were extremely extravagant, did not try to cheer up, and had excessive sexual pleasures, which eventually led to the collapse of the Six Dynasties one after another, like a dream. Li Shangyin, a poet of the late Tang Dynasty, said with profound emotion: &quot;Three hundred years of dreaming of the same dawn&quot; (&quot;Ode to History&quot;). Wei Zhuang also lamented that &quot;the Six Dynasties are like dreams and birds crowing in the sky.&quot; (&quot;Taicheng&quot;) Therefore, the poem laments that &quot;the rise and fall of the six generations is like a dream, and the time is astonishing.&quot; Time flies by, and the years are shocking. Now, due to the passage of time, the traces of war have been wiped out, and luxury has been sold out. , &quot;The old things of the Six Dynasties flow with the flowing water&quot; (Wang Anshi&#39;s &quot;Fragrance of Guizhi&quot;), &quot;Dancing on the pavilion and singing stage, the wind is always blown away by the rain.&quot; (Xin Qiji&#39;s &quot;Yong Yu Le&quot;) &quot;It is rare to see the silver toad self-recovery.&quot; Silver toad refers to the moon. The author believes that only the bright moon in the sky can see the changes of dynasties, the ups and downs of the human world. No matter &quot;the song sinks to the jade tree&quot; or &quot;the prosperity disappears&quot;, it will still be round and missing year after year, and round again when it is missing. She is a witness to history. This meaning is quite similar to Liu Yuxi&#39;s &quot;The old moon on the east side of the Huai River came over the female wall late at night.&quot; (&quot;Stone City&quot;). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The nostalgia in the previous film is not nostalgia for the sake of nostalgia, nor is it an elegy for the fall of the Six Dynasties. Behind the nostalgia, the author&#39;s political opinions and historical lessons are placed, hoping that the rulers of the Southern Song Dynasty can use the rise and fall of the Six Dynasties as a mirror of history and not repeat the mistakes of the fall of the Six Dynasties. His loyalty can shine through the sun and the moon. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The next film is lyrical about the scene, &quot;The ebb and flow create waves, and the trees in the river are as dense as hair.&quot; Sen means dense; hair means hair. &quot;The trees in the river are as dense as hair&quot; refers to the trees in the river being as dense as hair. The two sentences &quot;Ebb and flow&quot; transition from the nostalgia of the scene in the first film to the lyrical expression of the scene in the second film. Poyang is close to Poyang Lake, and the lake water flows into the Yangtze River, which is related to the above sentence &quot;The Yangtze River is thousands of miles away, and the smoke is &quot;The clouds are vast in the fresh water&quot;, so I think of &quot;the ebb and flow of the tide&quot;, and my heart is also ups and downs, and I have a lot of things on my mind. Thinking that I have been repeatedly denounced, as a immigrant, who can pity my &quot;boss&#39;s reputation&quot;? &quot;The boss&#39;s reputation&quot; The core of &quot;Festival&quot; still refers to the fact that he was the eldest son in his old age and was repeatedly demoted. His ambition to fight against the Jin Dynasty was not fulfilled, and he was unable to achieve success and fame. He was deeply lamented. But he said that &quot;even if the years are cold and the journey is long, this ambition should be difficult to win.&quot; &quot;The year is cold&quot;, see &quot;The Analects of Confucius&quot;: &quot;The year is cold, and then we know that the pines and cypresses will wither. &quot;This ambition should be difficult to seize&quot;, paraphrasing &quot;The Analects of Confucius&quot;: &quot;An ordinary man cannot seize his ambition.&quot; &quot;Capture&quot; means change. Li Gang said that although it is &quot;cold&quot; (a metaphor for the dangerous and difficult environment), he will be as green and tall as pines and cypresses, not afraid of ice and snow; although the &quot;distance is long&quot;, he will drive away the Jin soldiers. , the goal cannot be achieved in the short term, but he is not afraid of the persecution of the capitulationists. No matter how dangerous the environment is, no matter how long the road to achieve the goal is, he decides to persevere and remain determined.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Conclusion &quot;The independent fisherman is full of snow on the river&quot;. This is adapted from Liu Zongyuan&#39;s poem &quot;A man in a boat with a coir raincoat, fishing alone in the snow on the cold river&quot; (&quot;Snow on the River&quot;). Liu Zongyuan was demoted to Yongzhou, and as a immigrant, he described himself as a fisherman who stood proud of the snow despite the wind. Li Gang felt that he had some similarities with Liu Zongyuan, so he also used the image of a fisherman to describe himself, allowing readers to understand his tenacious fighting spirit from the artistic image of a fisherman who is proudly independent at the head of the river and is not afraid of the wind and snow in the river.&lt;/p >; &lt;p>; This poem has some similarities with the four poems &quot;Jinling Nostalgia&quot; written by the author in the third year of Xuanhe (1121). For example: &quot;Song of the Yushu as the moon sinks and becomes full&quot;, &quot;The battle destroyed the ancient city&quot; &quot;Desolate&quot;, &quot;Luxury has spread all over the city.&quot; His poems and lyrics are consistent in thoughts and feelings. The language style of this poem is also quite like poetry. The lyrics are deeply emotional, nostalgic for the past and sad for the present, low and depressed.&lt; /p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;About the author&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;div>;&lt;center>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://song.gushiwen.cn/authorImg/ligang.jpg&quot; width=50% >;&lt;/center>;&lt;/div>;Li Gang (1083-February 5, 1140), a famous official and national hero who fought against the Jin Dynasty in the late Northern Song Dynasty and early Southern Song Dynasty.
