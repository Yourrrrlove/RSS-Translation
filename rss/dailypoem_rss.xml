How could it be that we were cut off from music and music, and everyone was separated from each other. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Notes&lt;/strong>;&lt;br />;Liuzhou: Today it belongs to Guangxi. &lt;br />;Zhangzhou and Tingzhou: today belong to Fujian. &lt;br />;Fengzhou and Lianzhou: Today they belong to Guangdong. &lt;br />;Provincial governor: The chief executive of a state, equivalent to the prefect in later generations. &lt;br />;Connect: connect. As soon as you say it, you can see it with your eyes. &lt;br />;Dahuang: generally refers to remote and remote areas. &lt;br />;Haitian&#39;s sorrow: The sorrow is like the sea and the sky. &lt;br />;Jingfeng: strong wind; strong wind. &lt;br />;Luansha (zhǎn): blowing. &lt;br />;Hibiscus: refers to lotus. &lt;br />;Xu Mang: a creeping plant, also called magnolia.

The word &quot;high&quot; in &quot;high buildings on the city&quot; shows the poet&#39;s eagerness to climb up the tower to see his friends as soon as he arrived in Liuzhou. The higher you stand, the farther you can see, which shows how deeply you think. Because the five of them were persecuted together, their fates were closely related, and their friendship was sincere. Although they were far apart, they couldn&#39;t help but miss each other. &quot;Jie Dahuang&quot; writes about what he saw, saying that Liuzhou City is surrounded by desolate and remote places, and writes about the hardships of their exile. As far as the eye can see, the sea and the sky meet in a vast expanse. On the one hand, it is written that the places that the four of them derogated were all close to the sea. On the other hand, it also implies that their &quot;sorrows&quot; are as endless as the &quot;sea and sky&quot;. This is a way of writing from reality to virtuality. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The three or four sentences &quot;The trembling wind disturbed the hibiscus water, and the dense rain slanted into the vast wall&quot; are written about what was seen close up. But it is a close-up view, so it can be seen clearly, so it is written in detail. In terms of describing the scene of violent wind and rain, this is a &quot;Fu&quot; pen, and Fu also contains Bixing. There is a saying in Qu Yuan&#39;s &quot;Li Sao&quot;: &quot;I made lotus flowers to make clothes, and gathered hibiscus to make clothes. I didn&#39;t know that they were already gone, but I still love them and believe in their fragrance.&quot; It also said: &quot;Gather the roots of the wood to make tadpoles, and they will fall through the vast expanse of grass. The pistil; the fungus and the osmanthus are used to embroider the hui, and the rope is tied to the genggen. I practice it in front of my Dharma, which is not subject to the world.&quot; Here, hibiscus and Xiumang symbolize the beauty and purity of personality. Climbing the tower and looking nearby, I picked out Hibiscus and Ximang from among the people I saw. It was obviously their situation in the storm that made the poet&#39;s soul tremble. The wind is called shock, the rain is called dense, the roar is called chaos, and the invasion is called slanting, which shows that the poet&#39;s feelings are projected on objective things. When the hibiscus comes out of the water, why is it hindered by the wind, but the sudden wind will still blow randomly; the thick grass covers the wall, and the rain is difficult to invade, but the dense rain will invade diagonally. This can&#39;t help but make the poet think and feel sad. Here, the emotion in the scenery, the meaning in the environment, and the excitement in the poem are like salt in the water, leaving no trace. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Write five or six sentences about the vision. It is also &quot;Fu&quot; and has both &quot;Bi&quot; and &quot;Xing&quot;. Take a look at the endless mountains and forests. This is a realistic representation of the scenery in the southwest. Doesn’t it also symbolize the layers of siege and imprisonment by stubborn forces? Doesn&#39;t the meandering flow of the river also remind us of the twists and turns of the author&#39;s life and future? Sima Qian of the Han Dynasty said in his &quot;Report to Ren An&quot; that after being tortured, his &quot;intestines returned nine times a day&quot;, describing his extremely depressed mood; Wang Zhihuan of the Tang Dynasty&#39;s &quot;Ascending the Stork Tower&quot; expressed a feeling of &quot;wanting to see a thousand miles away and reach a higher level&quot;. Heroic spirit. This poem is more developed. Although the mountains are covered with trees, he can still overcome obstacles because he can see far away from a high place. He can look thousands of miles away and his sight is not blocked. The answer can be obtained from the description of looking at the Jiuzhui River from a distance in the next sentence. Despite the twists and turns of the river, the river is still rushing forward. This can be seen from the word &quot;liu&quot;. Therefore, the two sentences reflect that the author has encountered many obstacles and setbacks, but still has the indomitable will to break through the cage. The exquisite duality is both melancholy and bold, and the artistic conception is far-reaching. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The last two sentences come from the previous couplet. In addition to expressing the melancholy of caring about the situation of friends and turning a blind eye, they also have a deeper meaning: turning a blind eye naturally leads to the thought of mutual visits or exchange of messages; When looking at the land route, the mountains overlap, and when looking at the water route, the rivers flow meanderingly. Not to mention that it is not easy to visit each other, even exchanging messages is also very difficult. This naturally comes down to the fact that &quot;music and books are stagnant in one village&quot;. However, it ends like this, with a shallow and direct style. The author’s brilliance. Because he first used &quot;Come to a hundred Guangdong tattoo places&quot; as a pad, and then used &quot;Yu Zi&quot; to conclude that &quot;music and writing are stagnant in a hometown&quot;, he received a melancholy artistic effect. The sentence &quot;Gonglai&quot; not only corresponds to the &quot;Dahuang&quot; in the first sentence, but also unites the &quot;Liuzhou&quot; and &quot;Zhang, Ting, Feng, and Lianzhou&quot; in the title. It was painful enough to be banished to the wilderness together, but they were also isolated from each other, and even the news could not be sent. The lingering rhyme is lingering and the aftertaste is endless, and the spirit of the word &quot;send&quot; in the title also comes from this song. This shows the poet&#39;s skill in using his pen. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The whole poem uses the technique of &quot;comparison in the poem&quot; to express interest in the scene through the description of the scene in front of the eyes, and uses &quot;shocking wind&quot; and &quot;dense rain&quot; to describe evil forces, with the intention of criticizing political opponents; The &quot;ridges and trees&quot; are heavy and the &quot;river flow&quot; is more difficult to look at and the pain of longing. The sadness and sorrow are beyond words, and the feeling of depression and frustration is shocking! &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;Creative background&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>; This poem was probably written in Liuzhou in the autumn of 815 AD (the tenth year of Emperor Xianzong of the Tang Dynasty). Liu Zongyuan, Han Tai, Han Ye, Chen Jian, and Liu Yuxi were all demoted for participating in the Yongzhen reform movement led by Wang Shuwen. In the tenth year of Yuanhe, Liu Zongyuan and others were summoned to the capital as usual and were demoted to the governor of Bianzhou again. After the poet arrived in Liuzhou, when he climbed up the stairs, facing the foreign scenery, he couldn&#39;t help but have mixed feelings and wrote this poem. &lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;About the author&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;div>;&lt;center>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://song.gushiwen.cn/authorImg/liuzongyuan.jpg&quot; width=50%>;&lt;/ center>;&lt;/div>;Liu Zongyuan (773-819), courtesy name Zihou, was a native of Hedong (now Yuncheng, Shanxi) in the Tang Dynasty. He was an outstanding poet, philosopher, Confucianist and even an outstanding politician. He was one of the Eight Great Masters of the Tang and Song Dynasties. . Famous works include &quot;Eight Notes of Yongzhou&quot; and more than 600 articles, which were compiled into 30 volumes by later generations, called &quot;Liuhe East Collection&quot;. Because he was from Hedong, he was called Liu Hedong, and because he was finally appointed as the governor of Liuzhou, he was also called Liuliuzhou. Liu Zongyuan was born in the Liu family in Hedong. He was called &quot;Liu Liu&quot; with Liu Yuxi, &quot;Han Liu&quot; with Han Yu, and &quot;Wang Meng Wei Liu&quot; with Wang Wei, Meng Haoran and Wei Yingwu. Liu Zongyuan wrote more than 600 poems and essays in his lifetime, and his achievements in writing were greater than those in poetry. There are nearly a hundred parallel prose pieces. The prose is highly argumentative, sharp and satirical. &lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 13 Sep 2023 06:23:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[春风 | 袁枚]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://feedx.net/read?r=shiwen&d=239132]]><description> &lt;h2>;Spring Breeze&lt;/h2>;[Qing Dynasty] Yuan Mei&lt;div style=&quot;color: #5b4636;&quot;>;The spring breeze is like a distinguished guest, and it becomes prosperous as soon as it arrives. &lt;br />;Come and sweep away the snow from thousands of mountains and bring back the flowers from all over the world. &lt;/div>;&lt;h3>;Translation and annotations&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Translation&lt;br />;&lt;/strong>;The spring breeze is like a distinguished guest.
