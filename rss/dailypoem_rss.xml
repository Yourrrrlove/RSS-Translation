A few friends got together, drank wine and chanted poems. &lt;br />;In the deep courtyard where it is located, the door inside has long been closed, and everything outside is completely silent. A breeze blows, rustling the branches and leaves, causing an infinite chill. &lt;br />;The awakened birds fluttered and flew up suddenly, shaking off the autumn leaves. Qiuying flew past the eyes, and suddenly disappeared into the dusk, seeming to fly away with the smoke. &lt;br />;Facing this moonlight, it will arouse the sorrow of many people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Notes&lt;br />;&lt;/strong>;Pei Di: Friends of Qian Qi and Wang Wei, many of them wrote poems and sang harmonies. &lt;br />;Xie Gong: This refers to Pei Di’s study. The original meaning generally refers to Xie Tiao Tower in Xuancheng, Anhui. Xie Tiao served as the prefect of Xuancheng during the reign of Emperor Qi Ming of the Southern Dynasties. He built a room on the top of Lingyang Mountain near the city gate and named it &quot;Gaozhai&quot;. In the early Tang Dynasty, Xuancheng built a new building on the old site of &quot;Gaozhai&quot; to commemorate Xie Tiao. Because the building was located in the north of the county, it was called &quot;Bei Tower&quot; or &quot;Beiwang Tower&quot;. Li Bai came to Xuancheng many times and climbed this building to pay his respects. The poem expresses feelings. The last couplet of &quot;Ascending Xie Tiao North Tower in Xuancheng in Autumn&quot; reads: &quot;Whoever misses the North Tower will feel grateful to the Duke in the wind. &quot;Therefore, the building is also called &quot;Xie Gong Tower&quot; and &quot;Xie Tiao Tower&quot;.&lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;Appreciation&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;p>; &quot;When the night comes, I am full of poetry and wine, and when the moon is full, I am grateful. &quot;Gonglou&quot;, a few friends gathered together, drank wine and recited poems. Unknowingly, the night got darker, the moon rose, and the moonlight filled the courtyard and tower. Xie Gonglou, Xie Zhuang wrote the famous &quot;Xie Gonglou&quot; in the Jin Dynasty. &quot;Moon Poems&quot; here refers to Pei Di&#39;s study. The lively scene of drinking and reciting poems was completely replaced by a sense of tranquility and remoteness as the moonlight fell.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;The shadows are closed and the door is quiet, The poet only noticed that the doors of the deep courtyard where the owner was located had long been closed, and everything outside was completely silent. A breeze blew, rustling the branches and leaves, causing an infinite chill. People suddenly felt the chill of the autumn night. Cool.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;The magpies scatter with the leaves, and the fireflies disappear into the smoke.&quot; These two sentences switch from describing the surrounding silence and the coolness of early autumn to writing about the moonlight, but it is not a positive description yet. The moonlight is invisible Without a shadow, it is indeed difficult to describe it positively. While Qian Qi drew on the experience of his predecessors, he also used their poems. Cao Cao&#39;s &quot;Dan Ge Xing&quot; said: &quot;The moon and stars are sparse, and the birds and magpies fly south. Three twists and turns around the tree, where is the branch to lean on? &quot;This is where the phrase &quot;magpie is frightened&quot; comes from. The moonlight was so bright that the magpie mistakenly thought that the sky was already dark, and suddenly flew up with its thorns, shaking off the autumn leaves. When the magpie rose, the leaves fluttered and scattered in all directions, making it look unique. Interesting. Compared with Cao&#39;s poem, Qian Qi&#39;s poem is more concise and poetic.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;Fireflies are far away into the smoke&quot; also uses a side description method. Shen Deqian said: “On a moonlit night, the fluorescent light disappears, but if you go far into the smoke, you can still see it flowing. This works best on physical objects. &quot;Using the dimness of the mist to set off the fluorescent light, and using the loss of the fluorescent light to set off the bright moon, is a wonderful way of thinking. With these two sentences, the silvery world of a bright moon thousands of miles away is presented to the reader with extraordinary clarity.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;Today is far away and the sky is over. How sad is the clear light? &quot;The poet gradually fell into deep thought after appreciating and appreciating the beautiful moonlight. &quot;The bright moon rises on the sea, and we share this moment with the world.&quot; Facing such moonlight, how many people will be saddened? The last two sentences end with questions. , leaving the readers to figure out and think about it, seems to be meaningful.&lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;Creative background&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>; This poem was written in the mid-Tang Dynasty. The poet and a few friends were writing in the early autumn evening They gathered together, drank wine and recited poems. The poet looked up at the bright moon in the sky, and felt homesick, so he wrote this poem. &lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;About the author&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;div>;&lt; center>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://song.gushiwen.cn/authorImg/qianqi.jpg&quot; width=50%>;&lt;/center>;&lt;/div>;Qian Qi (722?-780), named Zhongwen, Han nationality, native of Wuxing (now Huzhou City, Zhejiang Province), poet of the Tang Dynasty.

I say that autumn is better than spring. &lt;br />;A crane flies above the clouds in a clear sky, bringing poetry to the blue sky. &lt;/div>;&lt;h3>;Translation and Notes&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Translation&lt;br />;&lt;/strong>;Since ancient times, poets and poets have lamented the depression of autumn, but I say that autumn is far better than spring. . &lt;br />;On an autumn day when the sky is clear and a crane flies up through the clouds, it triggers my poetry to soar into the sky. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Notes&lt;br />;&lt;/strong>;Sadness and loneliness: Lamenting depression. &lt;br />;Chun Dynasty: Spring. &lt;br />;Paiyun: means to push away the clouds. &lt;br />;Pai: Push, which means breakthrough. &lt;br />;Bixiao: blue sky. &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;Appreciation&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;p>; Liu Yuxi&#39;s &quot;Autumn Poems&quot; is unconventional and takes a new approach. It sings the beauty of autumn with the greatest enthusiasm. What is even more rare and valuable is that &quot;Autumn Poems&quot; was written after the poet was demoted to Langzhou, which makes people admire Liu Yuxi&#39;s way of dealing with others. There are two original poems, this is the first of them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;Since ancient times, autumn has been sad and lonely. I say that autumn is better than spring.&quot; Since Song Yu left a famous sentence in &quot;Nine Bian&quot;, &quot;It is sad, autumn is also the spirit&quot;, sadness has become It has become a color and an emotion of autumn; sadness has become the autumn in my heart. However, the poet started with a discussion, categorically denying the previous concept of mourning the autumn, and showing an exciting and upward poetic sentiment. &quot;I say&quot; expresses the poet&#39;s self-confidence. Although this self-confidence is tainted with an unfortunate color, the poet&#39;s broad mind remarkably dissolves this misfortune. &quot;Victory in the Spring Dynasty&quot; is the poet&#39;s fullest recognition of the autumn scenery. This kind of recognition is by no means just a momentary emotional impulse, but is integrated into the poet&#39;s higher-level rational thinking about autumn. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;A crane flying over the clouds in the clear sky brings poetry to the blue sky.&quot; The poet grasped the &quot;a crane flying over the clouds&quot; in autumn. The description of this unique landscape shows the crisp air in autumn and the clear sky. An open view of floating white clouds. The crane flying in the clouds also carries the poet&#39;s poetry and flies to the sky together. Although this crane is lonely, the momentum it displays is extraordinary. The profound meaning contained in the word &quot;Pai&quot; cannot be expressed in words. Perhaps, the poet refers to himself as &quot;crane&quot;, or perhaps the poet regards &quot;crane&quot; as the embodiment of unyielding. Here, there are philosophical implications and artistic charm, which are thought-provoking and chantable. What it gives readers is not only the vitality and plain color of autumn, but also a noble spirit and noble sentiment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; When reading such poems, what fills our hearts is by no means a sad atmosphere. Following the poet&#39;s &quot;poetry&quot; and with the help of the wings of the poet&#39;s imagination, we gallop through the blue sky like a flying horse. As a result, the cranes soar into the sky, the poetry is far-reaching, &quot;real&quot; and &quot;virtual&quot; are merged together, and what is obtained is an inspirational and emotional beauty. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The whole poem is powerful and magnificent, integrating emotions, scenery and principles. It shows a high spirit and broad mind, and sings an extraordinary autumn song, leaving a legacy for our descendants. What is left is a rare spiritual wealth. &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;Creative background&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>; In 805 AD (the first year of Yongzhen), Shunzong ascended the throne and appointed Wang Shuwen to reform the government. Liu Yuxi also participated in this reform movement. Failure is demoted. But he has a strong desire for differences and wants to be different in everything he does, and refuses to follow what others say. &quot;Two Autumn Poems&quot; was written by Sima Shi, who was demoted to Langzhou. &lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;About the author&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;div>;&lt;center>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://song.gushiwen.cn/authorImg/liuyuxi.jpg&quot; width=50%>;&lt;/ center>;&lt;/div>;Liu Yuxi (772-842), courtesy name Mengde, was born in Luoyang, Henan, and in Xingyang, Zhengzhou, Henan. He said that he was a descendant of King Jing of Shanzhong Mountain in Hanzhong. During the Tang Dynasty, he was a minister, writer, and philosopher, and was known as the &quot;Poetry Hero&quot;. His family is a scholarly family with Confucianism passed down from generation to generation. He advocated political innovation and was one of the central figures in the political innovation activities of Wang Shuwen School. Later, Yongzhen&#39;s reform failed and he was demoted to Sima of Langzhou (now Changde, Hunan). According to Mr. Zhou Xinguo, a historian and collector in Changde, Hunan, Liu Yuxi was demoted to Sima of Langzhou and wrote the famous &quot;Spring View of Han Shou City&quot; during his demotion. &lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 18 Oct 2023 05:23:08 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
