The fragrance of rice flowers tells of a good harvest, and the sound of frogs sounds. &lt;br />;Seven or eight stars are out in the sky, and two or three points of rain are in front of the mountain. In the old days, by the forest of Maodian Society, I suddenly saw a bridge over a stream when the road turned. (Xiqiao No. 1: Xitou) &lt;/div>;&lt;h3>;Translation and annotations&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Translation&lt;/strong>;&lt;br />;The bright moonlight passed between the branches, startling Magpies flew from the branches, and the cool evening breeze seemed to hear the cicadas chirping in the distance. The fragrance of rice flowers and the sound of frogs in the fields seem to tell people that this is a good harvest year. &lt;br />;A few stars in the sky flickered brightly and dimly, and a light rain began to fall in front of the mountain. The small thatched house of the past is still next to the woods of Tutu Temple. When the road turns around the source of the stream, it suddenly appears in front of you. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Notes&lt;/strong>;&lt;br />;Xijiang Moon: the name of the word brand. &lt;br />;Huangsha: Huangsha Ridge is located to the west of Shangrao, Jiangxi. &lt;br />;Start the magpies from the branches: startle the magpies and fly away from the branches. &lt;br />;Cicada: The sound of cicada. &lt;br />;Old times: the past. &lt;br />;Maodian: a thatched country inn. &lt;br />;Shelin: The forest near the Tutu Temple. Society, Temple of the Land. In ancient times, there was a community tree in the village, which was used as a place for worshiping gods, so it was called community forest. &lt;br />;See: same as &quot;appear&quot;, appear, appear. &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;Appreciation&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;p>; Judging from the first two sentences of &quot;Moon on the West River&quot;, &quot;The bright moon leaves the branches startled by magpies, and the gentle breeze sings the cicadas in the middle of the night&quot;, it seems that it is written about the wind. , the moon, the cicada, the magpie, these are extremely ordinary scenery, but through the author&#39;s clever combination, the result is ordinary and extraordinary. The magpies were flying unsteadily, not hovering around the treetops, but flying around the slanting and abrupt branches. Because the moonlight is bright, the magpie is awakened; and when the magpie flies away, it will naturally cause the &quot;different branches&quot; to sway. At the same time, the chirping of cicadas also has a certain time. The chirping at night is different from the chirping under the scorching sun, and when the cool breeze blows slowly, it often feels particularly peaceful. In short, the two sentences &quot;frightened magpie&quot; and &quot;singing cicada&quot; contain stillness in the movement, and describe the scenery under the &quot;cool breeze&quot; and &quot;bright moon&quot; in the middle of the night in a leisurely and fascinating way. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Next, &quot;The fragrance of rice flowers talks about a good year, and listens to the sound of frogs.&quot; Shifts people&#39;s focus from the sky to the fields, showing that the poet is not only infiltrated by the soft taste of the yellow sand road at night, but also cares about it The fragrance of rice flowers that spread all over the village reminds us of the coming harvest. At this time and place, the joy that the poet and the people breathe together is all expressed in words. The &quot;fragrance&quot; of the fragrant rice flowers not only describes the blooming rice flowers, but also expresses the sweetness in the poet&#39;s heart. In the poet&#39;s mind, it is as if he can hear a group of frogs clamoring in unison in the rice fields, arguing about a good harvest. First tell the content of &quot;said&quot;, and then add the source of &quot;sound&quot;. It is the poet&#39;s creation to use the sound of frogs to talk about a good harvest. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The first four sentences simply describe the scenery of the mountain road at that time and the poet&#39;s feelings. However, the core is the summer night filled with harvest scenes. Therefore, it is not so much the summer scene as it is the happiness that the summer scene in front of us will bring to people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; At the beginning of Xia Que, the poet built a steep and steep peak, and used confrontation techniques to strengthen the stable tone. &quot;Seven or eight stars are outside the sky, and two or three drops of rain are in front of the mountain.&quot; Here, &quot;stars&quot; are sparse stars, and &quot;rain&quot; is light showers. These are all to match the quiet night, tranquil atmosphere and simple wildness of Shangyu. It matches the local flavor of Chengqu. In particular, the &quot;outside the sky&quot; and the &quot;mountain front&quot; were originally distant and elusive, but as soon as the pen was turned and the small bridge was crossed, the shadow of the thatched cottage beside the rural forest unexpectedly appeared before people&#39;s eyes. Although the poet is very familiar with the path on the yellow sand road, he is always so absorbed in the sound of frogs talking about the joy of a good harvest that he forgets to cross the &quot;outside of the sky&quot; and the &quot;mountain front&quot;, and even the nearby shrine. The thatched cottage next to the woods didn&#39;t even notice. The first part &quot;the road turns&quot; and the second part &quot;suddenly see&quot; not only express the poet&#39;s joy at suddenly seeing the old house clearly approaching, but also express his contentment that he was so immersed in the fragrance of rice flowers that he forgot about the distance of the road. The degree of fascination complements each other, reflecting the author&#39;s profound artistic skills, and is endlessly entertaining. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; On the surface, the subject matter of this poem is nothing more than some seemingly ordinary scenery. The language has no embellishment, no allusion is used, and the hierarchical arrangement is completely plain. However, precisely in the seemingly plain, there are the poet&#39;s painstaking conception and honest feelings. Here, readers can also appreciate another realm of Jiaxuan&#39;s poetry beyond the majestic and heroic. &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;Creative background&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>; In 1181 AD (the eighth year of Chunxi reign of Emperor Xiaozong of the Song Dynasty), Xin Qiji was dismissed from office because he was marginalized by traitorous ministers. He returned to Daihu, Shangrao, and lived there. Have lived here for nearly fifteen years. During this period, although he also had a brief career as an official, he mostly lived in Shangrao, where he left many poems. This poem was written when he was passing through Huangshaling Road in Shangrao, Jiangxi Province in his middle age. &lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;Sentence explanation&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;p>; &lt;strong>;The bright moon scares the magpies on the other branches, and the breeze sings the cicadas in the middle of the night. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The first two sentences of the word, composed of six noun phrases, depict a fresh rural summer night scene: the night sky is clear, the moon rises quietly, casting water-like moonlight, startling The black magpies are flying on the branches; in the middle of the night, the breeze blows slowly, bringing with it the chirping of cicadas. Using movement to contrast stillness, it expresses the tranquility and beauty of summer nights in the countryside. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Magpies are extremely sensitive to changes in light. When the moon is up, they are often startled by the moonlight and fly around and cry. Cao Cao&#39;s &quot;Dan Ge Xing&quot; has &quot;The moon and stars are sparse, and the black magpies are flying south. They circle the tree three times and there are no branches to rely on.&quot; Su Shi&#39;s &quot;Hangzhou Peony&quot; has &quot;The moon is bright and the magpies are frightened but the branches are not yet planted.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; There have been different opinions on the meaning of &quot;separate branches&quot; in the first sentence. Some interpret it as &quot;distant branch&quot;; some interpret it as &quot;slanting branch&quot;; some interpret it as &quot;the black magpie wants to leave the branch and fly away&quot;; some interpret it as &quot;the black magpie chooses the branch&quot;; others interpret it as &quot;the moon bids farewell to the branch&quot; &quot;. Although it is difficult to draw a conclusion, considering the parallelism between one and two sentences, &quot;biezhi&quot; corresponds to &quot;midnight&quot;, and the word &quot;bie&quot; should be used to describe and modify &quot;branch&quot;, so it is interpreted as &quot;distant branch&quot; or &quot;slanting branch&quot; seems more appropriate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although the poet traveled at night, he seemed to be in no hurry at all. We seem to see him walking leisurely on the mountain road, looking at where the bright moon is for a while, listening to the chirping of birds and the chirping of cicadas, leisurely and contented. At this time, he had no urgent business matters to deal with quickly, nor did he need to stay up all night over other people&#39;s accusations and slander. Although he was impeached and removed from office, he still had a lot of anger and sorrow in his heart, but the beautiful nature and tranquil rural life relieved some of his anger. So, on this beautiful summer night, walking on the quiet mountain path, he was completely immersed in the breeze and the bright moon, blending into the heaven and earth. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>;The fragrance of rice flowers speaks of a good year, and the sound of frogs sounds. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In the rice fields beside the road, the fragrance of rice flowers heralds the arrival of another good harvest. The frogs in the field couldn&#39;t bear the loneliness, and their cries kept coming and going, forming a continuous sound, which conveyed the author&#39;s love for nature and the vitality of summer. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>;Seven or eight stars are outside, and two or three points of rain are in front of the mountain. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Under the moonlight, smelling the fragrance of rice flowers and listening to the cicadas and frogs, the relaxed and happy poet continued to walk forward. Looking up at the sky, &quot;seven or eight stars&quot; hang sparsely on the horizon. It turns out that the stars are all blocked by dark clouds. Suddenly, it started to rain lightly in front of the mountain, and &quot;two or three drops of rain&quot; fell on the poet. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; At this time, the poet who was so leisurely just now couldn&#39;t help but become a little anxious. Summer weather can change at any time. Maybe a downpour will follow? He quickened his pace and hurried to find shelter from the rain. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>;In the old days, by the forest of Maodian Society, I suddenly saw a bridge over a stream when the road turned. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; After turning around the mountain path and crossing a stream bridge, just outside the woods next to the Tutu Temple, a thatched hut appeared in front of the poet. He was so happy that when he took a closer look, it turned out to be the small shop where he had stayed before! &quot;She&quot;, the woods near the Tutu Temple. &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;About the author&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;div>;&lt;center>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://song.gushiwen.cn/authorImg/xinqiji.jpg&quot; width=50 %>;&lt;/center>;&lt;/div>;Xin Qiji (May 28, 1140 - October 3, 1207), whose original name was Tanfu, later changed to You&#39;an, and in his middle age was also nicknamed Jiaxuan, Shandong East Road, Jinan A native of Licheng County (now Licheng District, Jinan City, Shandong Province). He was an official, general, writer, and bold poet of the Southern Song Dynasty. He was known as the &quot;Dragon of Ci&quot;. Together with Su Shi, he is called &quot;Su Xin&quot;, and together with Li Qingzhao, he is called &quot;Jinan Er&#39;an&quot;. When Xin Qiji was born, the Central Plains was already occupied by the Jin soldiers. At the age of 21, he joined the anti-Jin rebel army and soon returned to the Southern Song Dynasty. He has successively served as the pacifier of Hubei, Jiangxi, Hunan, Fujian, and eastern Zhejiang. He devoted his life to resisting gold. He once published &quot;Ten Comments on Meiqin&quot; and &quot;Nine Discussions&quot; to lay out strategies for war and defense. His poems express the patriotic enthusiasm of trying to restore the unity of the country, express the grief and indignation of unrealized aspirations, and condemn the humiliation of the then rulers for peace; there are also many works that praise the country&#39;s mountains and rivers. The subject matter is broad and he is good at using allusions from previous generations into the lyrics. The style is majestic and heroic yet not lacking in delicacy and tenderness. Because Xin Qiji&#39;s anti-golden ideas were inconsistent with the political views of the peace faction in power, he was later impeached and dismissed from office, and retired to Daihu, Jiangxi. &lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 20 Sep 2023 05:23:05 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[送菊 | 胡铨]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://feedx.net/read?r=shiwen&d=239201]]><description> &lt;h2>;Sending chrysanthemums&lt;/h2>;[Song Dynasty] Hu Quan&lt;div style=&quot;color: #5b4636;&quot;>;is ill in Haipu in the late autumn, and it will be more stormy tomorrow on the Double Ninth Festival. &lt;br />;The moss grows in Dumen, which makes me feel lonely at the end of the world. &lt;br />;The yellow flowers in the corner of the fence were planted by myself, but they have not bloomed in recent seasons. &lt;br />;The fragrance and beauty are so bright that you came to collect poems yesterday evening. &lt;br />;I tried to send frost roots in the early morning.

It was the Double Ninth Festival, and the governor asked him for poems. However, the climate in Hainan was different, and the chrysanthemums were not in bloom at the end of the season. I am not uninterested in spending the holiday sightseeing, it is just a perfunctory entertainment. I remember that the chrysanthemums were in full bloom every Double Ninth Festival in the capital, and it was so lively to enjoy the flowers and write poems, so I suddenly felt like returning to Kyoto to serve the country. This poem expresses Hu Quan&#39;s feelings of thinking more about his family and country during festive seasons. &lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;About the author&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;div>;&lt;center>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://song.gushiwen.cn/authorImg/huquan.jpg&quot; width=50%>;&lt;/ center>;&lt;/div>;Hu Quan (1102-1180), named Bangheng and Danan.
