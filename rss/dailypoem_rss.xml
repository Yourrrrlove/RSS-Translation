(It’s a pity to take a piece of work: it must be taken)&lt;br />;The flowers bloom and they must be broken, but don’t wait until there are no flowers to break the branches. (花开一片：有花) &lt;/div>;&lt;h3>;Translation and Notes&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Translation&lt;/strong>;&lt;br />;I advise you not to pay too much attention to the pursuit of fame and fortune. Cherish the best period of your youth&#39;s study. &lt;br />;Put off the flowers when they are ready to be harvested. Don’t wait until the flowers fade and only end up with an empty branch. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Notes&lt;/strong>;&lt;br />;Gold threaded clothing: Clothing decorated with gold threads is a metaphor for glory and wealth. &lt;br />;Cherish: Cherish. &lt;br />;Kan: Yes, I can. &lt;br />;Naosu: Although. Straight: direct and straightforward. &lt;br />;Don’t wait: Don’t wait. &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;Appreciation&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;p>; The meaning of this poem is very easy to understand and can be summarized by the word &quot;cherish time&quot;. This is a truth that everyone understands. However, it makes readers feel the simple and strong desire, which makes people feel extremely shocked and has an irresistible charm. Every sentence in the whole poem seems to repeatedly emphasize &quot;Don&#39;t let the good times pass by&quot;, and each sentence has some subtle changes. It is repeated without being verbose, and the loop is neither fast nor slow, forming a beautiful and light melody. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;I advise you not to cherish your gold-threaded clothes; I advise you to cherish your youth.&quot; The sentence structure is the same, starting with &quot;Encourage you&quot;, and the word &quot;Cherish&quot; also appears twice. This is the second sentence Repeated factors. But the first sentence says &quot;to advise you not to cherish&quot;, and the second sentence says &quot;to advise you to cherish&quot;. The meanings of &quot;mo&quot; and &quot;be&quot; are opposite. These are some changes in the repetition, but the main thing is The meaning remains unchanged. The &quot;gold-threaded garment&quot; is a very expensive piece of clothing, but &quot;I advise you not to cherish it&quot;, which shows that there are things in the world that are more precious than it. This is the &quot;youth&quot; that &quot;advises you not to cherish it&quot;. Why do you say that? The poem does not say it directly, but it is self-evident: &quot;An inch of time is worth an inch of gold, and an inch of gold cannot buy an inch of time.&quot; However, youth is very precious, and once it is gone, it can never be returned. He repeatedly &quot;persuaded you&quot; in a persuasive tone, sincere and sincere, with a strong sense of song and eloquent charm. One of the two sentences is negative and the other is affirmative. Negating the former is to affirm the latter. It seems that the real and the real are combined, and the virtual and the real complement each other, forming the first repetition and chant in the poem. The melody and rhythm are light and soothing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;Flowers are ready to be broken when they are in bloom. Don&#39;t wait until there are no flowers to break the branches.&quot; This constitutes the second repetition and chant. In terms of poetic meaning, it is almost the same as the first and second sentences. It is still &quot;Don&#39;t bear the burden of good things.&quot; Time&quot; means. In this way, in addition to the repetition between sentences, there is also a larger roundabout repetition between the first couplet and the second couplet. However, the expression techniques of the two couplets are different. The first couplet directly expresses the feelings, which is a metaphor; the second couplet uses a metaphor, which is a metaphor. So there is still variation in the repetition. Three and four do not have the neat sentence structure of one and two, but they are symmetrical to each other in meaning. The upper sentence says what it should be like if there are flowers, and the next sentence says what it will be like if there are no flowers. The upper sentence says what it should be like if it is &quot;must&quot;, and the next sentence says what it should be like if it is &quot;mo&quot;. There are also positive and negative oppositions. The meanings of the two sentences are closely related: &quot;If there are flowers, you must break them straight away&quot; means &quot;please wait until spring&quot; from the positive side, &quot;Don&#39;t wait until there are no flowers to break branches&quot; means &quot;please wait until spring&quot; from the negative side, which is like It is a continuation of &quot;persuading you&quot; to express the same feelings repeatedly, but the tone and rhythm change from slow and slow to urgent and passionate. The phrase &quot;Ken Zhe - Zhi Xu Zhe&quot; has a short rhythm and extremely strong intensity. The &quot;Zhi Xu&quot; is more emphasized than the previous &quot;Xu&quot;. This is a bold song of youth and love. The enthusiasm and unrestrainedness here are not only straightforward and bold, but also vivid and beautiful. The word &quot;花&quot; appears twice, and the word &quot;Zhe&quot; appears three times; &quot;Xu——Mo&quot; and so on, and &quot;Mo——Xu&quot; in the first couplet, naturally form a palindrome-style overlapping beauty. This series of natural and wonderful repetitions of words, sentences, and couplets make the poems catchy and the language sung. In addition to the beauty of the form, its emotions change from a slow loop to a passionate turbulence, which also constitutes the internal rhythm of the poem, making people feel even more soul-stirring when read. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Another notable feature of this poem is its unique and novel rhetoric. Generally speaking, the metaphorical techniques in old poems are often combined and used at the beginning of the poem; while the quatrains often start with scene language and then love language. This poem goes against the usual conventions. It is full of interest in the poem. It first adds poems and then compares them, and first expresses emotions and then expresses the scenery. It is unique. The sentence &quot;I advise you not to cherish your gold-threaded clothes&quot; is a poem, and using things to arouse feelings also has the effect of excitement. The second couplet of the poem is a metaphor, and it is also a continuation of the poetic meaning of the previous sentence &quot;I must cherish my youth&quot;. Instead of using the &quot;Geometry of Life&quot; style of direct emotion, flowers are used to compare the good times of youth, and folded flowers are used to compare the good youth of great youth. It is both vivid and beautiful, creating a world of imagery. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; This is the expression of art, image thinking. Missing youth will lead to endless regrets. This poem could have used idioms such as &quot;the boss is sad&quot; but did not use it to express this meaning. Instead, it moved closely towards the metaphor of folding flowers, and then created &quot; There is such an unheard-of strange saying. There is no word of regret, but the three words &quot;empty broken branches&quot; are thought-provoking and full of artistic appeal. &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;Creative background&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;p>; The author of the lyrics is no longer known, and the specific creation time is unknown. This is a popular lyric from the mid-Tang Dynasty. It is said that Li Qi, the governor of Zhenhai during the Yuan Dynasty, loved this word so much that he often ordered his concubine Du Qiuniang to sing it at banquets (see Du Mu&#39;s &quot;Poems of Du Qiuniang&quot; and his own notes). Some anthologies of Tang poetry are titled Du Qiuniang&#39;s work or Li Qi&#39;s work, which is inaccurate. &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;About the author&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;div>;&lt;center>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://song.gushiwen.cn/authorImg/duqiuniang.jpg&quot; width=50 %>;&lt;/center>;&lt;/div>;Du Qiuniang (about 791-?), called Du Zhongyang in &quot;Zi Zhi Tong Jian&quot;, and often called &quot;Du Qiuniang&quot; in later generations, was a native of Jinling in the Tang Dynasty. At the age of 15, she became Li Qi&#39;s concubine. In the second year of Yuanhe (807), Li Qi officially launched an army to rebel. Later, Li Qi&#39;s rebellion failed and Du Qiu was included in the palace. Later, he was favored by Emperor Xianzong of Tang Dynasty. In the fifteenth year of Yuanhe (820), Tang Muzong ascended the throne and appointed her as the wife of his son Li Chou. Later, Li Min was deposed as King of Zhang, and Du Qiuci returned to his hometown. When Du Mu passed by Jinling, he saw her poor and old condition, so he wrote &quot;Poems of Du Qiuniang&quot;, the preface of which briefly describes Du Qiuniang&#39;s life experience. &lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 14 Oct 2023 05:23:06 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[采莲曲二首 | 王昌龄]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://feedx.net/read?r=shiwen&d=2310141]]><description> &lt;h2>;Two Lotus Picking Songs&lt;/h2>;[Tang Dynasty] Wang Changling&lt;div style=&quot;color: #5b4636;&quot;>;&lt;p>;Wu Ji, the more beautiful Princess Chu, fights over the lotus boat and wets her clothes. &lt;br />;When you come, you will be greeted by Pukou flowers, and you will be sent home after picking them up in the first month of the Yangtze River. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The lotus leaf skirt is cut in one color, with hibiscus slit to both sides of the face. &lt;br />;He entered the pool without being able to see him, but when he heard the song, he felt that someone was coming. &lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;h3>;Translation and annotations&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Translation&lt;/strong>;&lt;br />;The lotus-picking girls are all beautiful and moving, like the beauty of Wuyue and Chu The princesses and concubines competed to row the lotus-picking boats, and their clothes were wet by the lake water. &lt;br />;Lotus flowers welcomed them into the river mouth when they came, and after picking them, the bright moon sent them back to the riverside. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The green skirt of the lotus-picking girl blends into the fields of lotus leaves, as if one color, and the face of the lotus-picking girl contrasts with the blooming lotus. &lt;br />;He disappeared into the lotus pond and only realized someone was coming when he heard singing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Notes&lt;/strong>;&lt;br />;Lotus Picking Song: the name of an ancient song. The content mostly describes the scenery of the water country in the south of the Yangtze River and the working and living mood of the lotus picking women. &lt;br />;&quot;Wu Ji&quot; sentence: In ancient times, the three kingdoms of Wu, Yue, and Chu (now the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River and northern Zhejiang) were popular in the drama of picking lotus. Therefore, this sentence says that the lotus picking girls are all beautiful, like the beauty of Wu and Yue, and like the king of Chu. Concubines. &lt;br />;Pu (pǔ)kou: the meeting place of rivers and lakes. Pu, waterside. &lt;br />;Luo skirt: a skirt made of soft and porous silk fabric. One-color tailoring: It seems to be cut from the same color of clothing. &lt;br />;Hibiscus: refers to lotus. &lt;br />;Invisible: It means that you can’t tell which is the green leaves and red flowers of the hibiscus, and which is the red dress of the girl. &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;Appreciation&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;p>; The first poem describes the lotus-picking activities of girls in the water town. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The three words Wu Ji, Yue Yan, and Princess Chu are used together to create a scene of lotus girls vying for beauty and beauty. The second sentence is about the activity of picking lotus. Judging from the &quot;fighting about the lotus boat&quot;, it seems to be a competition game of picking lotus. Ruxun of the Tang Dynasty said: &quot;The drama of picking lotus flourished in the Three Kingdoms, so it was promoted together.&quot; (&quot;Explanation of Tang Poetry&quot;) Because he had to row a boat to pick it, he didn&#39;t care about the water getting his clothes wet. The competitive, lively and cheerful mood of the lotus picking girl is expressed through the detail of &quot;wet clothes&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; They rowed a lotus boat and came to a world of flowers, and the last two sentences pointed out that they did not go back until the moon was over the river. The poet is not in a hurry to write about the return journey, but narrates the situation of the lotus-picking girls. When they came, they were greeted by flowers. It can be seen that the flowers were happy to be visited by them, and there was a hidden layer of writing about their feelings about the activity of picking lotus. I love it very much, almost enjoying it. When they went back, the moon was actually a flower, so they reluctantly sent it to them. &quot;Flowers welcome people&quot; and &quot;moon sends home&quot; use personification techniques to bring the entire lotus-picking activity to life, which is very poetic. The lotus greets the lotus-picking girl and the moon bids farewell to the lotus-picking girl. In fact, it is for expression. The cuteness of the lotus-picking girl. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; This poem vividly expresses the lively and cheerful character of a lotus-picking girl through several verbs, and uses flowers, moons, boats, and water to set off the woman&#39;s appearance. It can be said that this is A small movie that depicts characters very vividly and has a unique charm. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The second poem can be said to be a &quot;Picture of Lotus Picking&quot;, and the center of the picture is naturally the girls picking lotus. However, the author did not let them appear clearly in this moving picture from beginning to end. Instead, they were mixed in the fields of lotus leaves and bright lotus bushes, looming or absent, making the lotus-picking girl and the beautiful lotus The integration of nature gives the whole poem a unique and beautiful artistic conception that attracts people&#39;s imagination. This kind of artistic conception is unique. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;The lotus leaf skirt is cut in one color, and the hibiscus is slit to both sides of the face.&quot; At the beginning of the poem, a beautiful picture of harmony and unity between people and the environment is shown. The skirt of the lotus picking girl is as green as the color of the lotus leaves. Although the metaphor is not new, its use here has an unexpected effect. It not only depicts the lotus leaves in the fields, but also writes about the beautiful clothes of the lotus picking girl. The two set off each other and seem to be one. Especially the word &quot;cut&quot; is used very cleverly. The skirt is cut out, but here it is also used on the lotus leaf, which seems to be from He Zhizhang&#39;s &quot;Ode to the Willow&quot; poem &quot;I wonder who cuts out the thin leaves? The spring breeze in February is like scissors.&quot; &quot;I got inspiration from the sentence, which makes people feel that the lotus leaf and the skirt are not only the same color, but also seem to be made of the same material by the same pair of skilled hands. From this, people can&#39;t help but think of Qu Yuan&#39;s &quot;Li Sao&quot; &quot;making lotus flowers to make clothes, gathering hibiscus to make clothes&quot;, and feel the lotus-like souls of these women. The delicate hibiscus flowers seem to be blooming towards the beautiful face of the lotus-picking girl. The lotus is clearly written, but in fact it is to bring out the beauty of people. The beauty of the lotus-picking girl is not the stunning beauty of a woman who is shy of the moon, but is as healthy and warm as the sun. It seems to be able to encourage the lotus flowers in the pond to bloom. These two lines of poetry are originally from the &quot;Jasper Poems&quot; written by Emperor Yuan of Liang Dynasty, &quot;Lotus flowers are in confusion on the face, and lotus leaves are mixed with fragrance in clothes.&quot; Wang Changling&#39;s poem is better and more meaningful. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;You can&#39;t see anyone entering the pool, but you can only feel someone coming when you hear the song.&quot; The third sentence of the poem, &quot;Invisible in the pool,&quot; is a supplement and in-depth explanation of the first two sentences. It has two meanings: one is to highlight the density of the lotus field, making it more real and credible for people to distinguish the lotus; the other is to highlight the feelings and psychological activities of the spectators. The word &quot;chaos&quot; is used very delicately. The last sentence &quot;I heard someone coming when I heard the song.&quot; In addition to explaining from the other side that the girl is covered and melted by the lotus field, making it difficult for onlookers to see, it also writes a kind of beauty of sound, adding to the lively interest of the poem. The word &quot;Luan&quot; is both It refers to the scene where lotus-picking girls enter the pond one after another, laughing and having fun. It can also refer to the feeling that people and flowers are equally delicate and difficult to distinguish. The feeling of being &quot;invisible&quot; in front of the eyes echoes the above, and also adds to the imagination of the lotus leaf skirt and the human face of hibiscus. At the same time, it also describes the scene of luxuriant flowers and leaves in the lotus pond, with people looming in it, and leads to the following sentence: &quot;When I heard the song, I felt that someone was coming.&quot; This sentence is described in a delicate and subtle way, as if the reader can experience the poet personally. The real feelings at that time. &quot;Begin to awaken&quot; echoes the &quot;invisible&quot; sentence in the previous sentence, and together create an artistic conception of &quot;lotus flowers passing over people&#39;s heads&quot;. &quot;Wen Ge&quot; also echoes the word &quot;Luan&quot;. The melodious and beautiful singing voice shows their lively and cheerful nature, and also adds a touching touch to the whole lotus picking scene. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; This poem is closely connected with each other and has far-reaching meaning. It is meticulously crafted but gives people a sense of elegance and nature. It can be seen that Wang Changling&#39;s superb skills in refining words and meanings are very important to the poetry of the late Tang Dynasty. has an important impact. &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;Creative background&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>; This poem was written in the summer of 748 AD (the seventh year of Tianbao reign of Emperor Xuanzong of Tang Dynasty), when Wang Changling was demoted to Longbiao. At that time, Wang Changling had been serving as the captain of Longbiao for some time. Once, Wang Changling was playing alone outside Longbiao City. In the lotus pond of Dongxi, he saw the local chief&#39;s princess, the barbarian girl Aduo, picking lotus flowers and singing in the lotus pond. Deeply attracted by it, he composed &quot;Lotus Picking Song&quot;. &lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;About the author&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;div>;&lt;center>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://song.gushiwen.cn/authorImg/wangchangling.jpg&quot; width=50%>;&lt;/ center>;&lt;/div>;Wang Changling (698-756), courtesy name Shaobo, was born in Jinyang, Hedong (now Taiyuan, Shanxi).
