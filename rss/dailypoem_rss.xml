From the place of the emperor, it is said that I have come. Call the servant and call him Zai. The king&#39;s affairs are many and difficult, and maintaining them is extremely difficult. &lt;br />;I got out of my car and went to the suburbs. Set up this one and build that one. He is so sad, why is he so sad? Worry is quiet, and the servant is exhausted. &lt;br />;The king ordered Nan Zhong to go to the city in Fang. When we get out of the car, Pengpeng, the flag is flying. The emperor ordered me to go to the other side of the city. He is famous in Nanzhong, and he is in Xiang. &lt;br />;I have left in the past, and the millet and grass are blooming. Now I come to think about it, rain and snow carry the road. The king&#39;s affairs are many and difficult, so he should not hesitate to leave. Wouldn’t you like to return home? Fear this simple book. &lt;br />;The grassworms are buzzing, and the katydids are buzzing. I haven&#39;t seen the gentleman yet, so I am worried. Now that I see a gentleman, my heart drops. He was powerful in Nanzhong, but he was weak in attacking Xirong. &lt;br />;Spring is late and the flowers and trees are luxuriant. Kung Geng Jie Jie, mining Fan Qi Qi. He was found ugly when he was sentenced, but his words were returned. He is famous in Nanzhong, and he is in Yi. &lt;/div>;&lt;h3>;Translation and Notes&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Translation&lt;br />;&lt;/strong>;I was riding in a tall chariot to prepare for the expedition, while the front army was lined up and waiting on the outskirts of the capital. An order came from King Zhou&#39;s palace to obey the call of the country and come here. Call my servant Ma Bian to my side and tell them to get in the car and go to the front line together. In the troubled times of the country, security has become a major threat, and we must face the crisis and move forward bravely. &lt;br />;I rode in a tall chariot to prepare for the expedition, while the rear army lined up and waited at the gate of the capital. There are flags with patterns of turtles and snakes everywhere, and beautiful feathers are stuck on the top of the flags. Those big flags with turtles, snakes, eagles and falcons are all fluttering in the mighty wind. I am worried about my safety and my victory here, and Ma Bian&#39;s entourage is full of sorrow and worry. &lt;br />;The King of Zhou gave an order to General Nan Zhong and sent him to build a fortified city in the distant Shuofang. Many chariots were dispatched together, and the flags were flying in the sky, colorful and clear. Emperor Zhou issued a strict order to us and rushed to Shuofang to build a defensive city. The famous General Nan Zhong led his army to fight and defeated the 玁灁 in one fell swoop. &lt;br />;I remember that when I left home for a long journey, it was the time when millet, wheat, grains, and flowers were blooming. Now I finally embark on the long journey home, with heavy snowfall accompanying me along the muddy journey. The national security crisis is full of disasters and difficulties, and it is impossible to get a moment of rest and peace. Don’t we miss our hometown bitterly? It’s just that we respect the emperor’s edict. &lt;br />;Nameless insects hissed and sang in the grass, and grasshoppers jumped lightly on the grass tips. My wife has not seen me for a long time, and she looks worried and pitiful. You can imagine that when she sees me coming back, her eager and restless heart will be put to rest. The famous General Nan Zhong wiped out Xirong on his way back home. &lt;br />;The spring is bright and the sunshine is so warm, and the flowers, plants and trees are full of life and luxuriant. The oriole birds showed off their songs to their heart&#39;s content, and the pretty village girls picked sweet wormwood leisurely. Capture and interrogate the prisoner who had his left ear cut off. After packing up, he hurried home. The famous General Nan Zhong, come and wipe out the arrogant Yixi. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Notes&lt;br />;&lt;/strong>;Mu: a place outside the suburbs of the city. &lt;br />;Thorn: urgent. &lt;br />;旐 (zhào): a flag with a pattern of turtles and snakes. &lt;br />;Build: to erect.旄 (máo): a flag decorated with a yak tail on the flagpole. &lt;br />;旟 (yǔ): a flag with an eagle pattern. &lt;br />;旆（pèi）旆: The way the flag is flying. &lt;br />;Quietly: with a heavy heart. &lt;br />;Cuì: haggard from hard work. &lt;br />;Peng Peng: describes the numerous carriages and horses. &lt;br />;Flag (qí): a flag with a cross-dragon pattern and a bell. Yangyang: A clear look. &lt;br />;Hehe: A majestic appearance. &lt;br />;Xiang: It means &quot;stirring&quot; and calming down. remove. &lt;br />;Fang: Positive value.

Yi: sweep away. &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;Appreciation&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;p>; The choice of materials in the poem &quot;Xiaoya·Getting out of the Car&quot; is different from the poems that describe the war positively. The poet closely It captures the two key typical scenes of pre-war preparation and triumph, and highly summarizes a long-lasting war with frequent changes in space and location into a short poem. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The poet cleverly combined the carefully selected main plots such as ordering troops to build flags, cutting down the 玁狁, conquering the Xirong, and returning in triumph to present prisoners, etc., unifying the complicated threads into a chapter, and narrated it from different angles. Primary and secondary. It not only shows the entire development process of the event in an orderly manner, but also avoids the disadvantage of listing the events. This structure makes the poem neatly laid out, highlights the theme, and makes the poem twists and turns moving. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The first three chapters of the poem describe the preparations before the war, and the detailed descriptions adopt the technique of superimposing the depiction of the picture and the psychological suggestion. The first chapter says, &quot;I got out of my chariot and went to herd there; from where the emperor came, it was said that I had come.&quot; The four words &quot;getting out of my chariot&quot;, &quot;arriving to herd&quot;, &quot;passing the order&quot; and &quot;assembling&quot; are close in time and space, and extremely close in time. The coherent movements create an atmosphere of emergency mobilization before the war. The last two sentences use the words &quot;difficult&quot; and &quot;thorny&quot; to imply the psychological dignity and depression of the commander and his soldiers. The second chapter uses the &quot;旐&quot;, &quot;旄&quot;, &quot;flag&quot;, &quot;旟&quot; and &quot;旗旆&quot; standing under the sky to describe the awe-inspiring momentum of the army marching to the &quot;suburbs&quot;. At the end, &quot;quietly&quot; and &quot;conditionally exhausted&quot; are used to describe the anxious and nervous psychology of the soldiers during the rapid march to the front line. The third chapter recounts the grandeur of the military with the words &quot;Pengpeng came out of the chariot, and the flag was raised to the Yangyang&quot;. While correctly deploying the battle, the use of &quot;Hehe&quot; and &quot;Xiang&quot; hints at the author&#39;s confidence in winning the war. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The descriptive techniques used here make the first three chapters have both the grandeur of the pastoral oath taking in the countryside and the grandeur of the field march, as well as the meticulous psychological activities of the characters, achieving the overall and detailed, objective and realistic A clever combination of subjectivity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The last three chapters of the poem overcome the inherent shortcomings of poetry in narrative space, skipping the specific process of the war and directly describing the scene of the triumphant return. In this part, the poet evades the truth and uses a technique similar to the &quot;montage&quot; of modern movies in a dramatic way, unexpectedly drawing the reader&#39;s attention from the tense atmosphere to the first expedition of &quot;Millet Fanghua&quot;, and then The dislocation of time and space caused by the comparison between the past and the past (&quot;I am gone in the past&quot; and &quot;I am thinking about today&quot;), and the long journey home from &quot;rain and snow&quot; to &quot;spring is late&quot;, guide readers to use their imagination to fill in the gap. An understanding of the length and hardship of the war. The transformation of the people in the family from the &quot;worry&quot; of &quot;having never seen the gentleman&quot; to the joy and peace of mind of &quot;having seen the gentleman&quot; also uses imagination to write about people&#39;s concern about the war and their suffering mentality from the other side. In the end, it naturally led to sincere joy at the victory and praise for the coach. On the surface, this kind of writing style that avoids the truth and makes up for the fictitious seems to be a waste of time. However, because it contains the profound and subtle psychological changes of the participants from worry to joy, these seemingly &quot;idle&quot; descriptions of scenes become the most important part of the poem. The background or externalization of the character&#39;s mind and emotions is more touching and delicate than the frontal description. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; There is something wonderful about the spatial composition of poetry. The whole poem depicts six scenes in different time and space: ordering troops, setting up flags, setting off for the Northern Expedition, moving to Xirong, feeling homesick on the way, and returning victoriously. The poet combines these unrelated scenes and plots with the help of emotional expression. , connect it through, and unfold a true and broad picture of ancient battles. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In addition, the poet absorbed lines from folk songs into his poems. The language has a simple and natural atmosphere, and the artistic conception has the beauty of blending scenes. &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;Creative background&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>; This is a poem by a warrior describing his expedition and triumphant return following the commander Nan Zhong. At that time, the enemies faced by the Western Zhou Dynasty were the Qixi in the north and the Kunyi in the west. In order to stabilize the dynasty, the Zhou Dynasty sent troops to conquer them many times. This expedition, with Nan Zhong as the commander, achieved brilliant results. This poem can be said to be a true record of this war. &lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;About the author&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 01 Oct 2023 04:23:05 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[感遇十二首·其二 | 张九龄]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://feedx.net/read?r=shiwen&d=239302]]><description> &lt;h2>;Twelve poems about encounters·Part 2&lt;/h2>;[Tang Dynasty] Zhang Jiuling&lt;div style=&quot;color: #5b4636;&quot;>;The lonely man returns home and lies alone, washing away his worries. &lt;br />;I thank the tall bird for this, and spread my love for you. &lt;br />;With empty thoughts day and night, who feels the most spiritual? &lt;br />;Fei Chenli is separated from himself, how can I comfort my sincerity? &lt;/div>;&lt;h3>;Translation and annotations&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Translation&lt;br />;&lt;/strong>;Since I retired to this quiet mountain forest, I have been lying alone under the forest spring every day. The accumulated worries were washed away. &lt;br />;I want to use these to thank the high-flying bird, because I want her to convey my distant feelings. &lt;br />;I carry this infinite affection day and night, but who can understand my sincere affection? &lt;br />;The flying bird and the sinking fish are originally different in love, so how can they comfort my feelings? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Notes&lt;br />;&lt;/strong>;Tall Bird: A bird that flies high. &lt;br />;Feishen: refers to birds and fish. &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;Appreciation&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;p>; This poem is a five-character poem. The third character of each sentence is a verb, and the contrast between the upper and lower words is neat. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>; The poet in the first couplet explains that he lives in a place far away from the officialdom and further than the secluded forest. He is alone as a sleeping dragon and has an empty time. Such days seem to mock his aloofness and purity. The words &quot;return&quot; and &quot;wash&quot; in the sentence seem like a kind of punishment, but the author still &quot;returns&quot; to his mountain home, and is not afraid of the lonely &quot;wash&quot; to return home and become Mr. Wolong. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>; The author of the couplet uses metonymy, referring to the tall bird as the slanderer, and the distant sentiments as the poet&#39;s firm stand. The words &quot;thank you&quot; and &quot;chuan&quot; here are ironic, otherwise why would the poet thank those who said bad things about him? Set up a foreshadowing in the first sentence, saying that you want to thank them, and then say thank you to them in the second sentence to convey your profound attitude. This shows the author&#39;s inner disgust for those tall birds, but at the same time he expresses his gratitude to those people on the surface. There seems to be a sense of insincerity here, but given the author&#39;s situation at the time, this is all he can do. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>; In the neck couplet and the tail couplet, the poet continuously asks questions, expressing &quot;who knows my loyalty?&quot;, which is quite similar to &quot;Although I am good at repairing my hair, I will replace it overnight, and even though I will die nine times, It means &quot;I still haven&#39;t regretted it&quot;. The words &quot;sensation&quot; and &quot;comfort&quot; in the sentence are quite touching, which fully reflect the author&#39;s feeling of being unable to express his sufferings and feeling heartbroken after drinking wine. &quot;Rixi&quot; and &quot;feishen&quot; refer to the state in which the laws of nature are constantly being carried out, and refer to Refined, even in this tasteless life, the poet still has a pure state of mind, shielding his attitude and being Mr. Wolong, only hoping that one day he will still have the opportunity to meet &quot;Liu Bei&quot; and return to officialdom to revitalize it. Then he sighed, &quot;Whoever feels the most profound will comfort me sincerely.&quot; &quot;It can be seen that the poet still hopes to be reused by Xuanzong. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>; The whole poem talks about his aloofness and seeks for close friends, expressing the poet&#39;s feeling that although he is old and helpless, he is ambitious for a thousand miles. &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3 >;About the author&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;div>;&lt;center>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://song.gushiwen.cn/authorImg/zhangjiuling.jpg&quot; width=50%>;&lt;/center>;&lt;/div>; Zhang Jiuling (678-740) was the prime minister and poet of Kaiyuan in Tang Dynasty.
