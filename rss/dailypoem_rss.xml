It is a flock with the wrens, and does not follow the phoenixes and the like. Carrying and nurturing four chicks, the milk intake was often insufficient. When I eat the chaff of the world, I am often afraid of the black kite coming to snatch me away. It is shameful to venture into the dangers of Taixing, and it is shameful to follow the overturned millet and fly to eat it. Destiny has its own destiny, and to maintain one&#39;s duties, one has to cut off this little desire of one&#39;s own. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Notes&lt;/strong>;&lt;br />;Wren: The name of the bird, which is like a yellow bird but small. &lt;br />;Yellow mouth: young bird. &lt;br />;Kite: Bird of prey of the hawk family. &lt;br />;Wuchiesu: Allusions are used here. &lt;br />;Min: status, position. &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;Brief Analysis&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>; &quot;The Bird in the Empty City&quot; is an old title of Yuefu&#39;s &quot;Miscellaneous Songs and Songs&quot;. In this poem, the poet expresses his resentment and helplessness of being unable to stretch his ambitions, but not wanting to compromise, and can only live a miserable life. &lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;About the author&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;div>;&lt;center>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://song.gushiwen.cn/authorImg/libai.jpg&quot; width=50%>;&lt;/ center>;&lt;/div>;Li Bai (701-762), also known as Taibai, also known as Qinglian Jushi, also known as &quot;Exiled Immortal&quot;, was a great romantic poet in the Tang Dynasty. He was hailed as the &quot;Poetry Immortal&quot; by later generations, and was the same as Du Fu They are collectively known as &quot;Li Du&quot;. In order to distinguish them from the other two poets Li Shangyin and Du Mu, who are known as &quot;Little Li Du&quot;, Du Fu and Li Bai are also collectively known as &quot;Big Li Du&quot;. According to the &quot;New Book of Tang&quot; records, Li Bai was the ninth grandson of Emperor Xingsheng (Liang Wuzhao King Li Hao) and the same clan as the kings of Li and Tang Dynasties. He is a cheerful and generous person who loves drinking, writing poetry, and making friends. Li Bai was deeply influenced by the thoughts of Huang Lao Liezhuang. There is &quot;Collection of Li Taibai&quot; handed down from generation to generation. Most of his poems were written when he was drunk. His representative works include &quot;Looking at Lushan Waterfall&quot;, &quot;The Road is Difficult&quot;, &quot;The Road to Shu is Difficult&quot;, &quot;About Drinking&quot; and &quot;Morning&quot;. &quot;Fa Baidi City&quot; and so on. &lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 09 Oct 2023 06:23:06 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[多丽·咏白菊 | 李清照]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://feedx.net/read?r=shiwen&d=231091]]><description> &lt;h2>;Dolly·Yong White Chrysanthemum&lt;/h2>;[Song Dynasty] Li Qingzhao&lt;div style=&quot;color: #5b4636;&quot;>;The small building is cold, and the night is long and the curtains are drooped. Hate the rustling, the ruthless wind and rain, the night comes and rubs the beautiful skin. It doesn&#39;t look like the imperial concubine&#39;s drunken face, nor does it look like Sun Shou&#39;s frown. Han Ling steals the fragrance, and the lady&#39;s wife is a fan. Don&#39;t compare them with each other. Take a closer look at the Qi and Qu Ping pottery orders, and you will see that the charm is just right. The breeze rises, and the fragrance brews, not reducing the fragrance. &lt;br />;As autumn falls, the snow becomes clearer and the jade becomes thinner, relying infinitely on people. It seems like the worry is condensing, Han Gao is undressing the pendant, it is like the tears are falling, the Wan fan is writing poems. The moon is bright, the breeze is clear, the smoke is thick and the rain is dark, the heavenly religion is haggard and beautiful. Even though I cherish it, I don’t know how long I will keep it from now on. The favor is good, why should we remember it more? The east fence beside the river. &lt;/div>;&lt;h3>;Translation and Notes&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Translation&lt;/strong>;&lt;br />;During the long night, even though the curtains were lowered, it was still freezing cold in the small building. I hate the ruthless wind and rain that rustles and destroys the jade-like white chrysanthemums at night. Looking at the white chrysanthemum, it doesn&#39;t look like Concubine Yang&#39;s slightly red drunken face, nor does it look like Sun Shou&#39;s delicate and frowning brow. Han Ling&#39;s behavior as a cheater and a MILF&#39;s fan can&#39;t be compared to Bai Ju&#39;s. Looking carefully, Qu Yuan and Tao Ling&#39;s aloof and noble character is exactly the same as Bai Ju&#39;s. The breeze blows, and the fragrance of the white chrysanthemum is no less than the elegant tea. &lt;br />;Autumn is coming to an end, and the white chrysanthemum is becoming more and more beautiful and thin, seeming to reveal its infinite attachment to people. You can see that it seems to be a gathering of sorrow, undressing the pendant in the Han Dynasty; it seems like tears spilling on a fan and writing a poem. Sometimes there is a bright moon and a clear breeze, and sometimes there is thick fog and autumn rain. God allows the white chrysanthemum to spend its beauty in the increasingly haggard weather. Even though I cherish it, I don’t know how long I can keep it from now on. well! If the world knows how to cherish and appreciate chrysanthemums, why should we recall and emphasize the chrysanthemums loved by Qu Yuan and Tao Yuanming? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Notes&lt;/strong>;&lt;br />;Duoli: Ci brand name, one is &quot;Yatoulu&quot;, the other is &quot;Longtouquan&quot;, 139 words. This poem is the longest one in &quot;Shuyu Ci&quot;. &lt;br />;Xiaoxiao: the sound of fierce wind and rain. One is &quot;Xiao Xiao&quot;. &lt;br />;Qiongji: refers to the white chrysanthemum whose petals are like jade. &lt;br />;The drunken concubine’s face: This sentence means: Yang Guifei’s face after being drunk is as beautiful and charming as the peony flower in Li Zhengfeng’s poem. &lt;br />;Han Ling stole the fragrance: Han Ling refers to Han Shou. Xu Niang Fu Fan: Xu Niang refers to Xu Zhaopei, the concubine of Emperor Liang Yuan. &lt;br />;Look at: look at. Take, auxiliary word. &lt;br />;Qu Ping Taoling: Qu Ping is Qu Yuan&#39;s first name, with the courtesy name Yuan, and also named himself Zhengze, with the courtesy name Lingjun. Tao Ling: refers to Tao Yuanming, whose surname is Qian and whose courtesy name is Yuanliang. He once served as Peng Zeling. &lt;br />;Yùn jiè: broad and inclusive. &lt;br />;酴龾(tú mí): That is Tumi, the name of the flower. It blooms white flowers in early summer. &lt;br />;Qiulan: deep autumn. &lt;br />;Thinness: one means &quot;degree&quot;. &lt;br />;Han Gao (gāo) Jiepei: Han Gao, the name of the mountain, is located in the northwest of Xiangyang, Hubei Province. Pei: Jade ornaments on the clothes and belts of ancient people. This should refer to a man having an affair. &lt;br />;Wán (wán) fan poem: Wán fan, a round fan made of fine silk. &lt;br />;Zepan Dongli: refers to Qu Yuan and Tao Qian, two poets who loved chrysanthemums. &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;Appreciation&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;p>; In Li Qingzhao&#39;s poems, &quot;flower&quot; is the most common image. The flowers in her paintings not only have human emotions, such as &quot;pampering willow flowers&quot; (&quot;Nian Nujiao·Desolate Courtyard&quot;), &quot;plum blossom hearts are frightened&quot; (&quot;Lone Goose·Rising from Sleeping in the Rattan Bed and Paper Canopy&quot;); they also have eyebrows, The cheeks are like &quot;willow-eyed plum cheeks&quot; (&quot;Die Lian Hua·Warm Rain and Sunny Wind First Break Freeze&quot;); there are muscles and bones, such as &quot;jade bones and ice muscles&quot; (&quot;Rui Partridge·Double Ginkgo&quot;); therefore there are also fat and thin, Such as &quot;green, fat, red and thin&quot; (&quot;Ru Meng Ling·Last night it rained and the wind blew&quot;). Chrysanthemums are slender, so here we use the word &quot;rubbing to damage the skin&quot; to describe the delicate bones of chrysanthemums. Then we further use four historical figures as analogies. The imperial concubine&#39;s drunken face is a metaphor for the peony. Li Zhengfeng&#39;s &quot;Ode to the Peony&quot; has &quot;the beauty of the country is drunk with wine, and the fragrance of the sky is dyeing clothes at night&quot;. Emperor Xuanzong of the Tang Dynasty thought it was comparable to the drunken concubine Yang (see &quot;Song Chuang Miscellaneous Records&quot;). The author uses allusions to Yang Guifei, Sun Shou, Han Ling, Xu Niang and other allusions to explain that the white chrysanthemum is neither as rich and plump as Yang Fei nor as enchanting as Sun Shou. Its fragrance is far-reaching, not as fragrant as Han Shou&#39;s, and its color is crystal white, not as white as Xu Niang&#39;s, which is full of pink powder. She was eaten by Qu Zi and picked by Tao Qian. Qu Yuan&#39;s &quot;Li Sao&quot; has &quot;Drinking magnolias in the morning with falling dew, and dining with autumn chrysanthemums in the evening&quot;; Tao Yuanming&#39;s &quot;Drinking&quot; No. 5 has &quot;Picking chrysanthemums under the eastern fence, leisurely seeing the Nanshan Mountain&quot;. Appreciating this flower carefully is like treating a noble scholar to a direct minister. The fragrance is light and the breeze is gentle, and the clear fragrance is lingering, not less than the fragrance of wine. Yuxiu is a tea flower with yellow flowers like wine and blooms in late spring. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>; The writing continues in the next part, using the word &quot;gradual&quot; to express the passage of time and the decline of chrysanthemums in autumn. &quot;Snow is clear and jade is thin&quot; echoes &quot;rubbing the beautiful skin&quot;, closely following the Baiju&#39;s attitude of struggling to stand on its own in the wind and rain, from blooming to withering. Here we don’t talk about people’s attachment to Can Ju, but instead talk about Ju’s sorrow and tears, and she reluctantly said goodbye. Use Zheng Jiaofu&#39;s allusion of &quot;Han Gao explains the pendant&quot; and Ban Jieyu&#39;s &quot;Autumn fan saw donation&quot; as a metaphor. These two classics talk about the sorrow of gain and loss, the loss of love but abandonment, and the sadness of abandonment. The feeling of melancholy blends into the bright moon, the clear breeze, the thick smoke and the dark rain, and is embodied through this clear and blurred realm. At the same time, it also implies that since the chrysanthemum is different from the popular customs, it can only be left to be fragrant and haggard in this quiet, noble, yet misty and dim environment. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The poet cherishes the flowers and cherishes himself, which reflects that even if he loves the flowers to the extreme, he cannot keep the flowers for a while. Unable to deal with the situation, he suddenly started to write a broad-minded saying: As long as human feelings adapt to their own needs, chrysanthemums are appreciated at the right time, and there is no need to recall that Qu Zi was loyal and walked by the riverside; Tao Qian was unrestrained and picked chrysanthemums on the eastern fence. &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;Creative background&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;p>; This word should be Li Qingzhao’s early work. Chen Zumei&#39;s &quot;Concise Chronology of Li Qingzhao&quot;: In the third year of Chongning (1104), the third year of Emperor Huizong of the Song Dynasty, Li Qingzhao was affected by the party&#39;s disaster. He lived in Bianjing and returned to his hometown in Jinan. He wrote &quot;Little Heavy Mountain&quot;, &quot;Dolly&quot;, etc. It is said that this poem was written in the first year of Daguan (1107). &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;About the author&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;div>;&lt;center>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://song.gushiwen.cn/authorImg/liqingzhao.jpg&quot; width=50 %>;&lt;/center>;&lt;/div>;Li Qingzhao (March 13, 1084 - May 12, 1155), named Yi An, was a Han nationality and a native of Zhangqiu, Jinan, Shandong Province. A poet in the Song Dynasty (at the turn of the Southern and Northern Song Dynasties), a representative of the Wanyue Ci School, she is known as &quot;the most talented woman in the ages&quot;. In the early stage of his poems, he wrote mostly about his leisurely life, while in the later stage, he mostly lamented his life experience and had a sentimental mood. In terms of form, he makes good use of line drawing techniques, creates his own channels, and uses clear and beautiful language. The argument emphasizes the law of association, advocates elegance, puts forward the saying &quot;don&#39;t be the same family&quot; in lyrics, and opposes writing lyrics in the same way as poetry. He is capable of poetry, but not much remains. Some of his chapters are timely and historical, and his sentimental words are generous, which is different from his style of writing. There are &quot;Collected Works of Yi An&quot; and &quot;Yi An&#39;s Ci&quot;, which have been lost. Later generations have a compilation of &quot;Shu Yu Ci&quot;. Now there is &quot;Li Qingzhao&#39;s Collection and Annotations&quot;. &lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 09 Oct 2023 04:23:06 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
