Red and pink, delicate as drunk, leaning against the red leaf. When I remember the year, I can see the newly painted face, facing the water bank. It is almost half spring, the clouds are warm and the sun is warm, and the inclined bridge turns to the west of the city. The grass is soft and the sand is flat, the horses are crossing with hanging poplar trees, and the jade poles are neighing. Recognize the eyebrows, condense the smiling face, and brush the swallow fat. The embroiderer once peeped and hated Yiyi. &lt;br />;Together we hold hands, the fragrance is like mist, the red color follows every step, and we complain about the late spring. Who can ask about weight loss? Only flowers know, tears fall empty. In front of the old hall, Yan and Yanyu flew together again. People grow old, have good spring, and have good dreams. I visited Liu Lang in the past, and the flowers should also be sad in a romantic place. But in the dim dusk, with Wuling River as far as the eye can see, it is difficult to trace the past. &lt;/div>;&lt;h3>;Translation and Notes&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Translation&lt;/strong>;&lt;br />;The east wind flew up to the small peach branches with affection. The beauty is delicate in pink, charming and charming, leaning against the vermilion door. I remember last year, her new makeup lined her face with hibiscus, which faintly contrasted with the peach blossoms. She came to the water bank, half of spring had passed, the clouds were warm and the sun was melting, and she turned along the inclined bridge until she reached the west side of Jiacheng. The green grass is soft and flat, the horses are running happily, the weeping willows are dancing on the ferry, and Yule&#39;s horses are neighing and galloping to be the first. I recognized her beautiful eyebrows, the smiling face that glanced attentively, and the light rouge on her cheeks. The beauty who once secretly peeped in front of the embroidered window is no longer seen today, and her longing for her is endless. &lt;br />;Where we traveled hand in hand, the peach blossoms were still as fragrant as mist, and the falling red on the ground danced with the steps, resenting that the spring had come to an end. People in Xichun are also losing weight, so who can they rely on to express their condolences? Only the peach blossom knows the heart, and the sky will be filled with clear tears. The swallows that built their nests in front of the old hall flew back to their old homes with the misty spring rain. People who cherish spring are aging in vain, and the spring scenery renewed every year will always be beautiful. I hope that the dream-like good times will come again with spring. Liu Lang is here again. How many traces of the former romantic place are left? Seeing this, the peach blossoms should also feel sad and distressed. I could only see the misty clouds at dusk, the Wuling River was no longer visible, and the past was hard to look back on. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Notes&lt;/strong>;&lt;br />;Zhuó: carry. &lt;br />;Zhu Fei: Vermilion door. &lt;br />;Suō: grass name, Cyperus rotundus. &lt;br />;Bama: galloping horse. &lt;br />;Yule: A horse title made of jade, also generally refers to a horse. &lt;br />;Mo Mei: This refers to beautiful women. &lt;br />;Xiuhu: refers to a woman’s boudoir. &lt;br />;To save Liu Lang in the past: It is adapted from Liu Yuxi’s poem and Liu Chen and Ruan Zhaoren’s encounter with fairies in Tiantai Mountain. This is the author’s own reference. &lt;br />;Wuling River: Using the story of Tao Yuanming&#39;s &quot;Peach Blossom Spring&quot;, it also alludes to Liu Chen and Ruan Zhao&#39;s troubles. &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;Appreciation&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;p>; This poem is titled &quot;Peach Blossom&quot;. It tells a fragrant and sad love story by writing about peach blossom, combining chanting flowers and cherishing people. Combined. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;The east wind is interested, and it first climbs up the small peach branch. It is red and pink, delicate as drunk, leaning against the red leaf.&quot; The opening chapter is the touching image of peach blossoms. The spring light is bright, the warm wind is blowing, and the little peaches are blooming, handsome and fragrant. &quot;Red and pink, delicate as drunk, leaning against the red leaf.&quot; The author uses people to compare flowers to show the beauty and loveliness of peach blossoms. The blossoming peach blossoms, delicate and delicious, red and fragrant, dazzle the windows. Isn&#39;t this just like a beauty who is covered with pink and white, charming and drunk, leaning against the red door? The word &quot;greasy&quot; highlights the beauty of red, and the word &quot;zui&quot; expresses the charm of Xiaotao. The author&#39;s metaphor is clever and ingenious, but it is also appropriate, natural and precise. Writing in this way not only gives the still life people beauty and vitality, but also pave the way for the following writing by Hua Capture, and then bring out the &quot;time of remembering years&quot; naturally. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;Remembering the Year&quot; to &quot;Thin-faced Sweeping Swallow Branches&quot; are all memories of the beautiful woman, and the author unfolds the narrative with delicate writing. At that time, the spring was beautiful and warm. The grass was luxuriant and the weeping willows curled up. The poet was riding a horse and inadvertently caught a glimpse of the beautiful lady&#39;s face. On the shore of the water, it was faintly set against the peach blossoms. &quot;Le Zheng hisses&quot;, he stopped and stared. The two sentences &quot;Recognizing the eyebrows and smiling&quot; are the elegant image of a beautiful woman. She has graceful eyebrows, a smile as bright as a flower, a little bit of makeup, and a graceful appearance that makes the author fall in love with her. However, the author suddenly inserted the sentence &quot;The embroidered household once peeked. Hate Yiyi&quot;, which is worth savoring and appreciating. This implies the twists and turns of his love experience with a beautiful woman. &quot;The Embroidered House Peeped&quot; is a picture of him searching for and pursuing a beautiful woman; &quot;Hate Yiyi&quot; describes his lonely mood of missing someone or not being able to fulfill his wish. The author&#39;s words are vague and implicit, which is correct. It coincided with his subtle mood at that time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The next chapter moves from memories to reality. The three desolate lines of &quot;Hand in Hand&quot; reveal the vast differences between the past and the present. The peach blossoms used to be delicate and beautiful, but now their fragrance is as thin as mist, and their redness fades slowly. They have lost their past beauty and charm, which makes people feel pity for them. The author Bu Nan complains about the late spring because it brings too much sadness. &quot;Those who have lost weight. Who can ask? Only flowers know. Tears are hanging down&quot; is the poet&#39;s embrace at this time. The beauty is gone and the love is far away, but he still persists in reminiscing and becomes haggard in the sorrow of separation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The sentence &quot;The Yan in front of the old hall&quot; comes from Liu Yuxi&#39;s &quot;Woyi Lane&quot; of the Tang Dynasty, but the author changed its meaning to highlight not the changes in world affairs of &quot;flying people in ordinary people&#39;s homes&quot;, but &quot;flying together with mist and rain&quot; &quot;The cold loneliness. Swallows can also stay and fly together, inseparable, but people are alone and solitary. The contrast is strong and breathtaking. The three sentences &quot;people grow old&quot; are written in a desolate way. The spring is still good, but people are getting old, and their official career can only be dreamed of. &quot;I lived with Liu Lang before, and my son was promised a romantic place, and he should be sad after his death.&quot; This is a metaphor from Liu Yuxi&#39;s &quot;Revisiting Xuandu Temple&quot;: &quot;The hundred-acre courtyard is half covered with moss, and the peach blossoms are all gone and the cauliflowers are blooming. Where do Taoist priests who grow peach go? &quot;I came here to visit Liu Lang today.&quot; It also contains an allusion to Liu Chen&#39;s return to Tiantai Mountain, once again capturing the peach blossoms and expressing the sorrow and loss of things. After some lingering chanting, the author finally concludes with &quot;But in the vast dusk, my eyes are broken by Wuling River. The past is difficult to recover&quot;, which highlights the theme that the past is sad and the old dream is difficult to continue. The appearance of &quot;Wuling&quot; is not sudden. It is an allusion to Liu Chen&#39;s visit to Tiantai Mountain. He once strayed into Wuling River, and later he was often called &quot;Wuling man&quot;, such as &quot;In the morning, the way back was lost, and the green peach turned to Wuling.&quot; &quot;Stream&quot; (&quot;Melancholy Poems&quot; by Tang Gonghuan), so this is still consistent with the title &quot;Peach Blossom&quot;. The poet has long built a beautiful paradise for his soul, carrying all his dreams, but living in the vast dusk and looking through the Wuling stream, he cannot find the graceful warmth at that time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; This poem begins with a peach blossom and ends with a peach blossom. The chanting of flowers is intertwined with writing about people. It expresses emotions through borrowing objects and cherishes people through borrowing objects. The emotions are graceful and lingering, and the language is charming and moving. In the poem, the poet&#39;s memories constantly change with the seasons. This writing method of time and space is a major feature of Chinese classical poetry. &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;Creative background&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>; In the leap November of the second year of Longxing (1164), Han Yuanji went to Zhenjiang to visit his mother as the new Poyang Shou. At that time, Lu You happened to be Zhenjiang Tong. Judgment. The two of them had known each other for a long time, and when they met in Zhenjiang this time, they visited the country together, drank together, and even sang together. From the leap eleventh month of the second year of Longxing to the first month of Qiandao Kaiyuan, there were a total of 30 songs and poems sung by them, among which this poem was written. &lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;About the author&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;Han Yuanji (1118～1187), a poet in the Southern Song Dynasty.

Song Qin Guan&#39;s &quot;Ci rhyme Pei Zhongmo and He Xianxian&quot;: &quot;After getting drunk on the pillow across the stars, flying catkins into the curtain to announce the depth of spring.&quot; Chaos: the appearance of being complicated. &lt;br />;Lover: a like-minded person. &lt;br />;Wei Zhou: Mooring the boat. Wei: tie. The poem &quot;Farewell to Hu Xing&#39;an at Night&quot; written by Liang Hexun of the Southern Dynasties: &quot;The people in the house turn to Shi, and the guests stay in their boats for a while.&quot;&lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;Appreciation&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;p>; This poem The poem tells about a young man who uses &quot;fishing&quot; as a cover to anxiously wait for the arrival of his lover in a pleasant fishing bay. This fresh little poem integrates spring, spring water, spring flowers, spring trees and youth, and paints a beautiful picture of spring for readers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Write one or two sentences about the moving scenery of Fishing Bay in late spring. There are several red apricot trees dotted in the green shade, and the branches are full of flowers, which is extremely beautiful. At this time, the dusk was getting darker, and the young man drove a small boat to the fishing bay. After he gently tied the boat cable to the poplar stump, he started &quot;fishing&quot;. However, &quot;the drunkard is not interested in drinking.&quot; No matter how he fiddled with the fishing rod and pretended to be calm, he still couldn&#39;t hide his inner uneasiness. The numerous apricot blossoms just set off his eager expression at this moment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;The pond is clear but the water is shallow, and the fish scatter when the lotus moves.&quot; Further writes about the young man&#39;s inner activities. This couplet of verses, rich in folk song flavor, contains thought-provoking puns: On the surface, it is said that when he was fishing, he bowed his head in the blue pool, and the water was clear to the bottom, so he doubted that there would be no fish to take the bait in the shallow water; suddenly he saw the lotus Ye shook his head and realized that the fish in the water were frightened and swam away. In fact, it is a metaphor for the young man&#39;s uncertainty about the success or failure of this date. He is &quot;suspecting that the water is shallow&quot; and there is no fish. He is worried that the journey will be difficult and the girl may not be able to come. When I saw the &quot;moving lotus&quot;, I mistakenly thought that the girl was paddling a small boat and came as promised, and my eyes suddenly lit up. However, upon closer inspection, it turned out that the fish were scattered under the water, and my heart sank again, feeling disappointed and confused. Growing latent and growing in darkness. Here, the very subtle psychological changes of the young man in the expectation of love, which are full of longing and joy, but also slightly worried and fearful, are really precise and vivid. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The first four sentences are clearly about fishing, but they say they are about love. This is not an attachment. Because the last two sentences of the poem point out: &quot;The sunset is waiting for the lover, the boat is green and the poplar banks are green.&quot; The poet does not put these two sentences that point out love in the poem, but puts it straight to the point at the beginning of the chapter. This is the beauty of the structural art of the poem. If the last The two sentences are placed at the beginning of the chapter, and the spirit of the poem is fully exposed and can be seen at a glance; there is no euphemistic sentiment anymore. And in this way, that couplet of puns will inevitably become the ending, causing the meaning to be suddenly interrupted, without any clue, and unable to contain the whole poem. This ending, from the perspective of the whole poetic structure, is full of twists and turns, clouds and mist, and wonderful changes. It makes the previous &quot;fishing&quot; suddenly become an emotional activity, and also connects the psychological descriptions such as &quot;doubt&quot; and &quot;knowledge&quot; with love, thus possessing the characteristics of pun. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The poem ends with lingering feelings and rich spring scenery. Under the reflection of the setting sun, with the green willows lingering and the boat gently swaying, the young man sometimes lowered his head to arrange the fishing line, and sometimes gazed affectionately at the sparkling waves in the distance - the lover in his heart. &quot;The sunset is waiting for my lover, the boat is green and the poplar banks are green.&quot; This is simply an eternal picture, the most beautiful shot, which will be deeply imprinted in the minds of readers. &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;Creative background&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>; This poem is the fourth poem in Chu Guangxi&#39;s &quot;Five Miscellaneous Odes&quot;. &quot;Five Miscellaneous Odes&quot; was written when Chu Guangxi was unhappy as an official and lived in seclusion in Zhongnan Mountain. &lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;About the author&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;div>;&lt;center>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://song.gushiwen.cn/authorImg/chuguangxi.jpg&quot; width=50%>;&lt;/ center>;&lt;/div>;Chu Guangxi (about 706-763) was an official of the Tang Dynasty, a native of Yanling, Runzhou, and his ancestral home in Yanzhou.
