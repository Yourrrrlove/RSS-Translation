Under the setting sun, it looks like a thin and barren mountain. Who will take pity on it? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Notes&lt;/strong>;&lt;br />;The Thin Horse Picture: This is a self-inscribed poem on Gong Kai&#39;s painting &quot;The Horse Bone Picture&quot; (also known as the Thin Horse Picture). &lt;br />;Jiang Tianguan: It means that he has made military exploits. &lt;br />;Xian Dynasty: refers to the fall of Song Dynasty. &lt;br />;Twelve leisure: refers to the royal stables. Free, stable. &quot;Zhou Li·Xia Guan·School Ceremony&quot; says: &quot;The emperor has two leisures out of ten and six kinds of horses.&quot;&lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;Creative background&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>; This is a painting inscription The poem is a self-inscribed poem written by the author in &quot;The Picture of Horses and Bones&quot; (also known as the Picture of Slender Horses). It was written probably after the death of the Song Dynasty and is a work of the poet in his later years. This self-titled poem titled &quot;Seven Horse Pictures&quot; contains the deep meaning of the poet&#39;s sustenance. The poet once worked with Lu Xiufu in the Guangling shogunate and participated in the resistance against the Yuan Dynasty. After the death of the Song Dynasty, he lived in seclusion and did not serve as an official, selling paintings for a living, and finally died keeping his ambition. Let’s look at the thin horse in his painting. It is a rugged and mountain-shaped horse. It has become extremely thin, but it still maintains the majestic and mountain-like appearance of the &quot;Xian Dynasty&quot;. Why the horse of the past is so thin today may be because it would rather be a skinny horse than eat &quot;Yuan millet&quot;. The poems in &quot;The Picture of Horses and Bones&quot; are the artistic expression of this thought. &lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;Appreciation&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;p>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The first two sentences of this poem describe this magical horse falling from the sky, which is more powerful than the emperor&#39;s royal horse. The last two sentences It is written that this horse is standing on the beach on the shore today, and the setting sun casts its shadow on the ground, like a barren mountain. The actual description of the horse today is that although it is thin, it is still standing, firm as a mountain, which highlights the precious spiritual temperament of this horse. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The poem begins with the word &quot;horse&quot;, &quot;as soon as the clouds and mist descended from the sky&quot;, the horse passed through the clouds and fell from the sky. In the Han Dynasty, Dawan, a domestically produced horse in the Western Regions, was known as the &quot;Tianma&quot;. This sentence describes the magic of the horse. It rises suddenly and has the momentum to break through the air, which increases the intensity of the beginning of the poem. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;The sky is empty and the first dynasty is twelve leisurely hours&quot;, connected to the previous sentence, means that the horse fell from the sky, and its extraordinary grace and grace eclipsed all the horses in the palace. &quot;Empty&quot; means to be washed away. The two sentences, starting and ending, describe the magical posture of the horse in the past. This is a magical horse. It rides on the clouds and rises into the mist, descending from the sky. There is no better horse in the world than the emperor&#39;s royal horse. Even all the royal horses are dwarfed by the thousand-mile horse. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The third and fourth sentences turn to &quot;today&quot; and describe the current situation of the horse, which forms a strong contrast with the first two sentences. Now, the horse is so skinny that no one cares about it anymore. The last line of the poem, &quot;The shadows on the beach at sunset are like mountains,&quot; is an image depiction of &quot;thin bones.&quot; The thin horse has no one to trust and stands alone on the beach in the sunset. The figure cast diagonally on the beach is as rugged as a mountain. The word &quot;mountain&quot; is used to describe the horse&#39;s thin appearance, which also has an implicit meaning: even if it is old, sick and sleepy, it still stands tall and tall, without changing its awe-inspiring and inviolable spirit. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The whole poem is dedicated to horses, describing horses in every sentence, which resembles the shape of a horse, and captures the spirit of the horse; it also sings about people, using horses to describe people&#39;s temperament, and people&#39;s ambitions, broadmindedness, and emotions can be seen everywhere. Encounter. The comparison between the past and present of Ma expresses the poet&#39;s deep emotion of not being able to appreciate his talent. Due to the changes of the times, people no longer favor it and pity it, leaving it skinny and skeletal. But it itself is neither inferior nor discouraged. It stands alone on the beach where the setting sun shines, its memory is like a mountain, and its majestic wind is still as strong as before. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; There is pride in the poem, and although it is a tragic song, it is also generous. Gong Kai&#39;s poem &quot;Skinny Horse&quot; actually reflects the poet&#39;s own image. The &quot;Skinny Horse&quot;&#39;s extraordinary talents, majestic bones and unshakable integrity are all very similar to Gong Kai&#39;s life experience and spirit. tolerance. &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;About the author&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;A native of Huaiyin in the Song Dynasty, his courtesy name was Shengyu, his nickname was Cuiyan, and his nickname was Guicheng Sou. He lived with Lu Xiufu in the Guangling shogunate. Lizong Jingding appointed supervisory officials for the Lianghuai system. After the death of Song Dynasty, there was no official position. The family was very poor and had few seats to sit at.

This man is not kind-hearted, why do you think of him as your brother? &lt;br />;Magpies still fly in pairs, and quails fly in pairs. This man has no conscience at all, why treat him as a king? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Notes&lt;br />;&lt;/strong>;鄘(yōng): the name of a vassal state in the Zhou Dynasty of China, located in the north of Ji County in present-day Henan Province. &lt;br />;Quail: The name of the bird, that is, quail. It is as big as a chicken, with a thin head and no tail, and spotted fur. Ben Ben: Jump and run. &lt;br />;Magpie: magpie. Qiang (qiáng): to fly gracefully. Ben Ben and Qiang Qiang both describe the way quails and magpies live with their companions and fly with them. &lt;br />;Unscrupulous: unkind. &lt;br />;Wo: A borrowed word for &quot;He&quot;, the ancient pronunciation of &quot;Wo&quot; and &quot;He&quot; are similar. One is called personal pronoun. &lt;br />;Jun: monarch, a gentleman. &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;Appreciation&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;p>; The whole poem has two chapters, each with four lines, both starting from &quot;the quail&#39;s running&quot; and &quot;the magpie&#39;s strength&quot;. It is said that animals still have fixed spouses, but the behavior of the male protagonist in the poem can be described as decadent and inferior to animals, and he is in vain to be called &quot;brother&quot; and &quot;king&quot;. In the two chapters of the poem, only the words &quot;brother&quot; and &quot;jun&quot; are not repeated. Although the poet dare not not refer to him as &quot;brother&quot; and &quot;jun&quot;, he seems to be gentle and honest, but in fact he uses the words &quot;brother&quot; and &quot;jun&quot;. , is tantamount to verbally criticizing the male protagonist, cutting directly and penetratingly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The author of this poem may be a woman who spurns the man she respects but has bad moral character. This means that quails and magpies know how to stay together and fly together. But this man whom she respected was corrupt, incestuous, and reckless. He was worse than a beast. But she always regarded him as an elder brother and a gentleman. Little did she know that he was not a humble and kind-hearted person, and he was disrespectful and disrespectful, which made her feel very sad. So, in a rage, she wrote a poem to denounce him to relieve her anger. The main theme of this poem should be based on the principle of &quot;women criticize men&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The whole poem uses metaphorical techniques to warn people that quails and magpies still have constant companions to live in, and they have constant companions to fly. However, the &quot;unscrupulous&quot; people in the poem are actually worse than beasts, and the author made a mistake. He treats him like a gentleman. Based on this, the author forms a strong inverse contrast between the feelings and attitudes of &quot;unscrupulous&quot; people and animals towards love and marriage, which strengthens the critical power of the poem. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Although the whole poem only has two chapters and eight sentences, and does not directly provide any objective description of the image of the male protagonist, it can make his image very vivid and prominent. This is rooted in the dramatic and extremely powerful emotional gap constructed by the poetic text. This gap comes from the different attitudes of humans and animals towards opposite-sex spouses. This difference in attitudes creates this huge and disparate inverse contrast. . As a result, the male protagonist&#39;s bad image hits him directly, which is chilling but disgusting. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The first two sentences of the two chapters of the poem are exactly the same, but the position has changed, but it can give people a sense of looping and interlacing. Although the difference between the last two lines of each chapter is only one word, it avoids the monotonous feeling that is easily caused when chanting repeatedly. This should be an important artistic strategy in &quot;The Book of Songs: Guofeng&quot; for this kind of poetry with repeated chapters and lines. &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;Creative background&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>; Ancient and modern scholars mostly believe that the background of this poem is a satirical poem, but there are debates about the satirical object of the poem and the author of the poem. Scholars throughout the ages believed that this poem was written to condemn and satirize the monarch of the Wei Kingdom. Because Xuan Jiang and his son were stubborn, it was not virtuous to accompany him, and most of them were satires of the Wei people, so this poem was written. &quot;Preface to Mao&#39;s Poems&quot; states that this poem was written by &quot;Xuan Jiang of the Wei Dynasty&quot; and said that &quot;the people of Wei thought that Xuan Jiang was inferior to a quail and a magpie.&quot; &lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;About the author&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot; _blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 29 Sep 2023 04:23:06 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
