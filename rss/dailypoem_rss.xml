The day is long and there is no companion, so I talk to the oriole. &lt;br />;There are shadows and fragrant apples, spring is everywhere. Move the boat. Before a new sentence is formed, a pear blossom rains. &lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;h3>;Translation and annotations&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Translation&lt;br />;&lt;/strong>;Wake up from a dream in the afternoon, roll up the curtains and fill the room with spring sorrow Disperse. The days are long, there is no one to keep company, and it is very boring. I can only speak to the oriole in the tree alone. &lt;br />;Catkins are flying in the air, and the fragrance of apples is faintly heard. The spring that cannot be found is here! Taking a small boat to visit old friends, the two of them were contemplating ideas under the pear tree. A drizzle of rain knocked down the pear blossoms and covered the inkstone. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Notes&lt;br />;&lt;/strong>;Inkstone: Inkstone. &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;Appreciation&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;p>; &quot;When I first return to my noon dream, the rolling curtain lets go of the spring sorrow.&quot; The spring weather makes people sleepy, and the poet fell into a drunken dream in the afternoon. , after waking up, I felt that the room was unusually quiet, and the air seemed to be stagnant. This kind of environment makes people depressed. So the poet opened the curtains, and the bright sunshine and fresh air poured into the room, making him feel relaxed. &quot;The rolling curtain lets go of the sorrow of spring.&quot; Spring sorrow is an invisible thing. When the curtain is rolled up, it is let out like a bird. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; This sentence is very distinctive, and the author successfully gives abstract things a vivid feeling. &quot;The day is long and there is no companion, so I say to the oriole.&quot; The lonely poet can only talk to the oriole, but he writes the lonely emotion in a leisurely and interesting way. It is annoying that the spring is getting better and better. In the long day, the poet has no poets or wine lovers, and he feels extremely bored. It&#39;s really strange to think that the oriole can talk to you. This highlights the loneliness of being without a partner, and also reflects the stillness of leisure and sorrow. The so-called &quot;letting go of spring sorrow&quot; actually does not let go. The beauty of the words lies in their subtlety. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Since the spring sorrow is difficult to deal with, and because there is no one to talk to, the poet moved a boat to visit friends, and it was a natural transition to Xiaqing. &quot;The shadows and apples are fragrant, spring is everywhere.&quot; The poet has left the room and merged into the embrace of nature. In late spring, catkins are flying, and the scenery is extremely beautiful under the sunlight. The place with floating shadows and the fragrance of apples is naturally full of spring. I looked for spring but didn&#39;t see it, but it turned out that spring was here. The poet was filled with joy. At this point, the endless spring sorrow was truly released. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;Moving the boat. Before I could write a new sentence, there was a rain of pear blossoms.&quot; The end of the poem was a visit to Yi&#39;s Garden. &quot;Move the boat&quot; is written leisurely and gracefully. The poet only captured one scene in the garden - a big pear tree next to the Shuoguoxuan; he only wrote about one elegant thing - a poem under the tree. Just as he and the owner of the garden were contemplating the idea, but before the poem could be completed, it suddenly started raining. &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;About the author&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;div>;&lt;center>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://song.gushiwen.cn/authorImg/zhoujin.jpg&quot; width=50 %>;&lt;/center>;&lt;/div>;Zhou Jin (date of birth and death unknown), named Mingshu and named Xiaozhai, was originally from Jinan (now Shandong) and lived in Wuxing (now Huzhou, Zhejiang) since his ancestors. In the fourth year of Jin Dynasty in Shaoding (1231), he was an official of Fuyang Order. At the end of Jiaxi and the beginning of Chunyou, he was an official of Fujian Transport Envoy. He was imprisoned repeatedly in Quzhou and sentenced to Keshan. In the third year of Baoyou&#39;s reign (1255), he knew Tingzhou. Jin Fu collected books and Gongci. Most of the lyrics are lost. The third volume of &quot;Exquisite Good Ci&quot; contains three of his poems, namely &quot;Dian Crimson Lips&quot;, &quot;Qing Ping Le&quot;, and &quot;Liu Shao Qing&quot;. &lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 15 Oct 2023 04:23:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[金缕衣 | 杜秋娘]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://feedx.net/read?r=shiwen&d=2310142]]><description> &lt;h2>;Gold-Threaded Clothes&lt;/h2>;[Tang Dynasty] Du Qiuniang&lt;div style=&quot;color: #5b4636;&quot;>;I advise you not to cherish your gold-threaded clothes, but to cherish your youth. (It’s a pity to take a piece of work: it must be taken)&lt;br />;The flowers bloom and they must be broken, but don’t wait until there are no flowers to break the branches. (花开一片：有花) &lt;/div>;&lt;h3>;Translation and Notes&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Translation&lt;/strong>;&lt;br />;I advise you not to pay too much attention to the pursuit of fame and fortune. Cherish the best period of your youth&#39;s study. &lt;br />;Put off the flowers when they are ready to be harvested. Don’t wait until the flowers fade and only end up with an empty branch. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Notes&lt;/strong>;&lt;br />;Gold threaded clothing: Clothing decorated with gold threads is a metaphor for glory and wealth. &lt;br />;Cherish: Cherish. &lt;br />;Kan: Yes, I can. &lt;br />;Naosu: Although. Straight: direct and straightforward. &lt;br />;Don’t wait: Don’t wait. &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;Appreciation&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;p>; The meaning of this poem is very easy to understand and can be summarized by the word &quot;cherish time&quot;. This is a truth that everyone understands. However, it makes readers feel the simple and strong desire, which makes people feel extremely shocked and has an irresistible charm. Every sentence in the whole poem seems to repeatedly emphasize &quot;Don&#39;t let the good times pass by&quot;, and each sentence has some subtle changes. It is repeated without being verbose, and the loop is neither fast nor slow, forming a beautiful and light melody. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;I advise you not to cherish your gold-threaded clothes; I advise you to cherish your youth.&quot; The sentence structure is the same, starting with &quot;Encourage you&quot;, and the word &quot;Cherish&quot; also appears twice. This is the second sentence Repeated factors. But the first sentence says &quot;to advise you not to cherish&quot;, and the second sentence says &quot;to advise you to cherish&quot;. The meanings of &quot;mo&quot; and &quot;be&quot; are opposite. These are some changes in the repetition, but the main thing is The meaning remains unchanged. The &quot;gold-threaded garment&quot; is a very expensive piece of clothing, but &quot;I advise you not to cherish it&quot;, which shows that there are things in the world that are more precious than it. This is the &quot;youth&quot; that &quot;advises you not to cherish it&quot;. Why do you say that? The poem does not say it directly, but it is self-evident: &quot;An inch of time is worth an inch of gold, and an inch of gold cannot buy an inch of time.&quot; However, youth is very precious, and once it is gone, it can never be returned. He repeatedly &quot;persuaded you&quot; in a persuasive tone, sincere and sincere, with a strong sense of song and eloquent charm. One of the two sentences is negative and the other is affirmative. Negating the former is to affirm the latter. It seems that the real and the real are combined, and the virtual and the real complement each other, forming the first repetition and chant in the poem. The melody and rhythm are light and soothing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;Flowers are ready to be broken when they are in bloom. Don&#39;t wait until there are no flowers to break the branches.&quot; This constitutes the second repetition and chant. In terms of poetic meaning, it is almost the same as the first and second sentences. It is still &quot;Don&#39;t bear the burden of good things.&quot; Time&quot; means. In this way, in addition to the repetition between sentences, there is also a larger roundabout repetition between the first couplet and the second couplet. However, the expression techniques of the two couplets are different. The first couplet directly expresses the feelings, which is a metaphor; the second couplet uses a metaphor, which is a metaphor. So there is still variation in the repetition. Three and four do not have the neat sentence structure of one and two, but they are symmetrical to each other in meaning. The upper sentence says what it should be like if there are flowers, and the next sentence says what it will be like if there are no flowers. The upper sentence says what it should be like if it is &quot;must&quot;, and the next sentence says what it should be like if it is &quot;mo&quot;. There are also positive and negative oppositions. The meanings of the two sentences are closely related: &quot;If there are flowers, you must break them straight away&quot; means &quot;please wait until spring&quot; from the positive side, &quot;Don&#39;t wait until there are no flowers to break branches&quot; means &quot;please wait until spring&quot; from the negative side, which is like It is a continuation of &quot;persuading you&quot; to express the same feelings repeatedly, but the tone and rhythm change from slow and slow to urgent and passionate. The phrase &quot;Ken Zhe - Zhi Xu Zhe&quot; has a short rhythm and extremely strong intensity. The &quot;Zhi Xu&quot; is more emphasized than the previous &quot;Xu&quot;. This is a bold song of youth and joy. The enthusiasm and unrestrainedness here are not only straightforward and bold, but also vivid and beautiful. The word &quot;花&quot; appears twice, and the word &quot;Zhe&quot; appears three times; &quot;Xu——Mo&quot; and so on, and &quot;Mo——Xu&quot; in the first couplet, naturally form a palindromic overlapping beauty. This series of natural and wonderful repetitions of words, sentences, and couplets make the poems catchy and the language sung. In addition to the beauty of the form, its emotions change from a slow loop to a passionate turbulence, which also constitutes the internal rhythm of the poem, making people feel even more soul-stirring when read. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Another notable feature of this poem is its unique and novel rhetoric. Generally speaking, the metaphorical techniques in old poems are often combined and used at the beginning of the poem; while the quatrains often start with scene language and then love language. This poem goes against the usual conventions. It is full of interest in the poem. It first adds poems and then compares them, and first expresses emotions and then expresses the scenery. It is unique. The sentence &quot;I advise you not to cherish your gold-threaded clothes&quot; is a poem, and using things to arouse feelings also has the effect of excitement. The second couplet of the poem is a metaphor, and it is also a continuation of the poetic meaning of the previous sentence &quot;I must cherish my youth&quot;. Instead of using the &quot;Geometry of Life&quot; style of direct emotion, flowers are used to compare the good times of youth, and folded flowers are used to compare the good youth of great youth. It is both vivid and beautiful, creating a world of imagery. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; This is the expression of art, image thinking. Missing youth will lead to endless regrets. This poem could have used idioms such as &quot;the boss is sad&quot; but did not use it to express this meaning. Instead, it moved closely towards the metaphor of folding flowers, and then created &quot; There is such an unheard-of strange saying. There is no word of regret, but the three words &quot;empty broken branches&quot; are thought-provoking and full of artistic appeal. &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;Creative background&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;p>; The author of the lyrics is no longer known, and the specific creation time is unknown. This is a popular lyric from the mid-Tang Dynasty. It is said that Li Qi, the governor of Zhenhai during the Yuan Dynasty, loved this word so much that he often ordered his concubine Du Qiuniang to sing it at banquets (see Du Mu&#39;s &quot;Poems of Du Qiuniang&quot; and his own notes). Some anthologies of Tang poetry are titled Du Qiuniang&#39;s work or Li Qi&#39;s work, which is inaccurate. &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;About the author&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;div>;&lt;center>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://song.gushiwen.cn/authorImg/duqiuniang.jpg&quot; width=50 %>;&lt;/center>;&lt;/div>;Du Qiuniang (about 791-?), called Du Zhongyang in &quot;Zi Zhi Tong Jian&quot;, and often called &quot;Du Qiuniang&quot; in later generations, was a native of Jinling in the Tang Dynasty. At the age of 15, she became Li Qi&#39;s concubine. In the second year of Yuanhe (807), Li Qi officially launched an army to rebel. Later, Li Qi&#39;s rebellion failed and Du Qiu was included in the palace. Later, he was favored by Emperor Xianzong of Tang Dynasty. In the fifteenth year of Yuanhe (820), Tang Muzong ascended the throne and appointed her as the wife of his son Li Chou. Later, Li Min was deposed as King of Zhang, and Du Qiuci returned to his hometown. When Du Mu passed by Jinling, he saw her poor and old condition, so he wrote &quot;Poems of Du Qiuniang&quot;, the preface of which briefly describes Du Qiuniang&#39;s life experience. &lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 14 Oct 2023 05:23:06 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
