Fishing gear. &lt;br />;Why am I so overestimating my abilities and asking for trouble and suffering the poverty on this journey? &lt;br />;It turns out that I am not tired of farming because I can enjoy the warmth of Mother Cheng Huan’s knees every day. &lt;br />;&amp;nbsp;Now that I am thousands of miles away, my heart is not here. &lt;br />;With my long and loving mother&#39;s heart, I just hope that everything goes as I wish for her to be healthy and well. &lt;br />;The silk produced by tiny silkworms is not much, but it allows us to change our clothes frequently. &lt;br />;Just like a silkworm who only needs a meal but spins out silk to benefit others. Who has ever seen a person in the world who does not ask for anything in return like a mother. &lt;br />;That’s all, I’d better say goodbye to my friends and go back to farming! Remove the wheels from the vehicles and use them as firewood. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Notes&lt;br />;&lt;/strong>;Lun: fishing thread. &lt;br />;Wei: only, only. &lt;br />;Wish: Pray, hope. &lt;br />;&lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;About the author&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;div>;&lt;center>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://song.gushiwen.cn/authorImg/baorong.jpg &quot; width=50%>;&lt;/center>;&lt;/div>;Bao Rong, courtesy name Deyuan, whose dates of birth and death are unknown and his place of origin is unknown, was a Jinshi scholar in the fourth year of Yuanhe and was an important poet in the mid-Tang Dynasty.

It is difficult to tell whether it is true or not. Now I see it. The Yellow River can turn into turbid waves in an instant. &lt;br />;The storms in the world are more dangerous than this, but people say that the dangerous path is only in the middle of the Yellow River. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Notes&lt;br />;&lt;/strong>;Pour down the Milky Way: Water in the Milky Way pours down. &lt;br />;For a moment: all of a sudden. &lt;br />;Translate: say instead. &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;Creative background&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>; In 1661 AD (the 18th year of Shunzhi), Song Wan was accused by his tribe of being in contact with Yu Qi, the leader of the rebel army, and his family members were searched. He was escorted to Beijing by car. He was released from prison after three years and spent another eight years in disgrace. During this period, he had a profound understanding of the recurrence of human relationships and the dangers of the world. This poem was written after Wan of the Song Dynasty was released and returned home. He suffered a great setback in his life in his later years, so he also used the opportunity to cross the Yellow River to sing a tragic song generously. &lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;Appreciation&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;p>; The first two sentences of this poem describe the turbid waves of the Yellow River rushing to the sky, and use the hope of the Milky Way in the sky as a foil to describe its danger; the last two sentences say Human feelings are more dangerous than the turbid waves of the Yellow River, so we should not say that the Yellow River is a dangerous road. This poem uses the technique of contrast to express the understanding of social life. It is very profound. It contains feelings of sorrow for the world, poverty, sorrow, loneliness and anger. The poem style is mature and the writing is strong. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The first two sentences say that once people come to the shore of the majestic Yellow River, which flows thousands of miles away, they will inevitably be frightened by the mysterious legend that it &quot;flows down the Milky Way&quot;. The poet has great contempt for such people who are hesitant and timid. Of course, there is some danger in crossing the Yellow River, but it is just a matter of enduring the &quot;turbulent waves&quot; that can shake the sky &quot;for a moment&quot;. In the eternal time and space, human life is just like a small boat in the dangerous peaks of the rapids: when the huge waves of life crash down overwhelmingly, no one can foresee it in advance, and no one can know how long this disaster will last. . Song Wan was once a poet with a rare reputation. He was a high school scholar in his early years. When he was an official, he also benefited a lot from politics and was deeply loved by the people. But he didn&#39;t want to be framed, so that he would be &quot;immediately arrested and imprisoned&quot; and &quot;taken as a wife&quot;. During the three years of imprisonment, he almost suffered unexpected disasters. It is no wonder that he would use the topic of &quot;crossing the Yellow River&quot; to sigh heavily that &quot;the world is more dangerous.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The last two sentences describe the turbulent Yellow River. The ancients did not know its origin and thought it was caused by the Milky Way in the sky turning upside down. Therefore, there is a saying that &quot;the water of the Yellow River comes from the sky&quot;. It has sky-shaking waves, but it doesn&#39;t take long to get over it. The risk of rough waves is very short-lived, and you can usually get through it. The real risk is in the human world. Ordinary people in this dangerous world are accustomed to a life of intrigues, intrigues, rampant wolves, darkness, evil, and conscience-killing. They are not aware of its dangers. Instead, they say that the dangers and waves of the Yellow River are the most terrifying and they dare not cross it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Song Wan believed that the poet was in poverty and had a &quot;gloomy&quot; feeling in his heart, so he was prone to &quot;generous tragic songs&quot;. (&quot;Preface to Dong Langshi&#39;s Poems&quot;) The Yellow River is a dangerous path in nature, but no matter whether it &quot;waters down the Milky Way&quot; or &quot;raises the turbid waves in the sky&quot;, in the eyes of the poet, compared with the path of life that is full of intrigues and conflicts, All insignificant. The poet uses a contrasting technique to express his understanding of social life, which is very profound. It contains feelings of sorrow for the world and sounds of poverty, sorrow, loneliness and anger. The poem style is mature and the writing force is strong, which shows one aspect of his poetic style. &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;About the author&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;div>;&lt;center>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://song.gushiwen.cn/authorImg/songwan.jpg&quot; width=50 %>;&lt;/center>;&lt;/div>;Song Wan (1614-1674) was a famous poet in the early Qing Dynasty and one of the eight great poets of the Qing Dynasty. The courtesy name is Uncle Yu, the nickname is Lishang, Han nationality, and a native of Laiyang (now Shandong). In the fourth year of Shunzhi, he became a Jinshi and was appointed as the head of the household department. He moved to Yongping Bingpu Road and Ningshaotai Road. Because of a long-standing regret, the clan&#39;s son falsely accused him of conspiring with Wen and was imprisoned for three years. For a long time, he got Bai and lived between Wu and Yue. He found an envoy in Sichuan. Wan poetry entered the houses of Du and Han, and was as famous as Shi Runzhang. He had the purpose of Southern Shi and Northern Song Dynasty. Together with Yan Hang, Shi Runzhang, Ding Peng, etc., he was collectively known as the Seven Sons of Yantai. He was the author of &quot;Anya Tang Ji&quot; and &quot;Er Xiang Ting Ci&quot; 》. &lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 27 Sep 2023 06:23:05 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
