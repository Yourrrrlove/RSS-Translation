Chinese Valentine&#39;s Day, the seventh day of the seventh lunar month every year, is the day when Altair and Vega meet. It is a beautiful folk legend. The author took a boat with magnolia trees as oars and went boating on Weishan Lake, known as the &quot;Land of Lotus Roots&quot;. At this time, the singing on the boat stopped from afternoon to evening. The weather on the lake is slightly cool, and the willows are shrouded in light smoke, which is reflected in the quiet water. The green distant mountains are like ripples in the water, just like eyebrows; the pale yellow moon is also curved and high, like a beautiful eyebrow. &quot;The mountain&#39;s eyebrows are blue and the moon&#39;s eyebrows are yellow&quot; is a very good sentence. It refers to the mountains and the moon of Weishan Lake as &quot;eyebrows&quot;. They face each other from a distance, and it is vaguely visible that the Cowherd and the Weaver Girl are &quot;encountering each other&quot; and expressing affection with each other&#39;s eyes. &lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;About the author&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;div>;&lt;center>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://song.gushiwen.cn/authorImg/yaoxie.jpg&quot; width=50%>;&lt;/ center>;&lt;/div>;Yao Xie (1805-1864) was a writer and painter in the late Qing Dynasty.

A few friends got together, drank wine and chanted poems. &lt;br />;In the deep courtyard where it is located, the door inside has long been closed, and everything outside is completely silent. A breeze blows, rustling the branches and leaves, causing an infinite chill. &lt;br />;The awakened birds fluttered and flew up suddenly, shaking off the autumn leaves. Qiuying flew past the eyes, and suddenly disappeared into the dusk, seeming to fly away with the smoke. &lt;br />;Facing this moonlight, it will arouse the sorrow of many people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Notes&lt;br />;&lt;/strong>;Pei Di: Friends of Qian Qi and Wang Wei, many of them wrote poems and sang harmonies. &lt;br />;Xie Gong: This refers to Pei Di’s study. The original meaning generally refers to Xie Tiao Tower in Xuancheng, Anhui. Xie Tiao served as the prefect of Xuancheng during the reign of Emperor Qi Ming of the Southern Dynasties. He built a room on the top of Lingyang Mountain near the city gate and named it &quot;Gaozhai&quot;. In the early Tang Dynasty, Xuancheng built a new building on the old site of &quot;Gaozhai&quot; to commemorate Xie Tiao. Because the building was located in the north of the county, it was called &quot;Bei Tower&quot; or &quot;Beiwang Tower&quot;. Li Bai came to Xuancheng many times and climbed this building to pay his respects. The poem expresses feelings. The last couplet of &quot;Ascending Xie Tiao North Tower in Xuancheng in Autumn&quot; reads: &quot;Whoever misses the North Tower will feel grateful to the Duke in the wind. &quot;Therefore, the building is also called &quot;Xie Gong Tower&quot; and &quot;Xie Tiao Tower&quot;.&lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;Appreciation&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;p>; &quot;When the night comes, I am full of poetry and wine, and when the moon is full, I am grateful. &quot;Gonglou&quot;, a few friends gathered together, drank wine and recited poems. Unknowingly, the night got darker, the moon rose, and the moonlight filled the courtyard and tower. Xie Gonglou, Xie Zhuang wrote the famous &quot;Xie Gonglou&quot; in the Jin Dynasty. &quot;Moon Poems&quot; here refers to Pei Di&#39;s study. The lively scene of drinking and reciting poems was completely replaced by a sense of tranquility and remoteness as the moonlight fell.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;The shadows are closed and the door is quiet, The poet only noticed that the doors of the deep courtyard where the owner was located had long been closed, and everything outside was completely silent. A breeze blew, rustling the branches and leaves, causing an infinite chill. People suddenly felt the chill of the autumn night. Cool.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;The magpies scatter with the leaves, and the fireflies disappear into the smoke.&quot; These two sentences switch from describing the surrounding silence and the coolness of early autumn to writing about the moonlight, but it is not a positive description yet. The moonlight is invisible Without a shadow, it is indeed difficult to describe it positively. While Qian Qi drew on the experience of his predecessors, he also used their poems. Cao Cao&#39;s &quot;Dan Ge Xing&quot; said: &quot;The moon and stars are sparse, and the birds and magpies fly south. Three twists and turns around the tree, where is the branch to lean on? &quot;This is where the phrase &quot;magpie is frightened&quot; comes from. The moonlight was so bright that the magpie mistakenly thought that the sky was already dark, and suddenly flew up with its thorns, shaking off the autumn leaves. When the magpie rose, the leaves fluttered and scattered in all directions, making it look unique. Interesting. Compared with Cao&#39;s poem, Qian Qi&#39;s poem is more concise and poetic.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;Fireflies are far away into the smoke&quot; also uses a side description method. Shen Deqian said: “On a moonlit night, the fluorescent light disappears, but if you go far into the smoke, you can still see it flowing. This works best on physical objects. &quot;Using the dimness of the mist to set off the fluorescent light, and using the loss of the fluorescent light to set off the bright moon, is a wonderful way of thinking. With these two sentences, the silvery world of a bright moon thousands of miles away is presented to the reader with extraordinary clarity.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;Today is far away and the sky is over. How sad is the clear light? &quot;The poet gradually fell into deep thought after appreciating and appreciating the beautiful moonlight. &quot;The bright moon rises on the sea, and we share this moment with the world.&quot; Facing such moonlight, how many people will be saddened? The last two sentences end with questions. , leaving the readers to figure out and think about it, seems to be meaningful.&lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;Creative background&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>; This poem was written in the mid-Tang Dynasty. The poet and a few friends were writing in the early autumn evening They gathered together, drank wine and recited poems. The poet looked up at the bright moon in the sky, and felt homesick, so he wrote this poem. &lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;About the author&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;div>;&lt; center>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://song.gushiwen.cn/authorImg/qianqi.jpg&quot; width=50%>;&lt;/center>;&lt;/div>;Qian Qi (722?-780), named Zhongwen, Han nationality, native of Wuxing (now Huzhou City, Zhejiang Province), poet of the Tang Dynasty.
