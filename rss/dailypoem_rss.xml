Once the golden wind and jade dew meet, they will win over countless others in the world. &lt;br />;Tenderness is like water, good times are like dreams, and I can’t bear to look at the magpie bridge on my way back! If the love lasts for a long time, how can it last day and night? &lt;/div>;&lt;h3>;Translation and annotations&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Translation&lt;/strong>;&lt;br />;The light colorful clouds transform into various ingenious patterns in the sky, and the meteors in the sky convey With the sorrow and resentment of lovesickness, I quietly cross the vast and distant Milky Way tonight. Meeting on the Chinese Valentine&#39;s Day in the autumn wind and white dew is better than those couples in the world who stay together forever but seem to be inseparable. &lt;br />;The lingering tenderness is as continuous as flowing water, the reunion date is as ethereal and illusory as a dream, and when we part ways, I can&#39;t bear to look at the Magpie Bridge Road. If two people are in love with each other and will remain together until death, why should they covet the happiness of each other in the morning and evening? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Notes&lt;/strong>;&lt;br />;Xianyun: light clouds. &lt;br />;Miscellaneous: refers to the clouds turning into various clever patterns in the sky. &lt;br />;Flying Star: Meteor. One theory refers to the two stars Morning Glory and Weaver Girl. &lt;br />;Yinhan: Milky Way, Tianhe. &lt;br />;Far away: distant appearance. &lt;br />;Darkness: Pass quietly. &lt;br />;Golden Wind and Jade Dew: refers to the white dew in the autumn wind. &lt;br />;Can&#39;t bear to look back: How can I bear to look back. &lt;br />;Morning and evening: refers to getting together day and night. The words come from Song Yu&#39;s &quot;Gaotang Fu&quot;. &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;Appreciation&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;p>; Borrowing the story of the Cowherd and the Weaver Girl to express the joys and sorrows of the world in a superhuman way, which has been around since ancient times, such as &quot;Nineteen Ancient Poems: Far Away Altair&quot;, Cao Pi&#39;s &quot;Yan Ge Xing&quot;, Li Shangyin&#39;s &quot;Xinwei Qixi&quot; and so on. Ouyang Xiu, Zhang Xian, Liu Yong, Su Shi and others in the Song Dynasty also chanted this theme. Although the words and sentences were different, they all followed the traditional theme of &quot;joy is short&quot;, with a sad and sad style. In contrast, Qin Guan&#39;s words can be said to be unique and witty, with lofty intentions. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>; This is a stanza preface to the Chinese Valentine&#39;s Day. The beginning of the sentence shows the unique lyrical atmosphere of the Chinese Valentine&#39;s Day. &quot;Qiao&quot; and &quot;hate&quot; combine the theme of &quot;begging for cleverness&quot; in the Chinese Valentine&#39;s Day and &quot;Cowherd, Cowherd,&quot; The tragic characteristics of the story &quot;Weaver Girl&quot; are clear, sophisticated and poignant. The story of the Cowherd and the Weaver Girl&#39;s joys and sorrows is used to sing the praises of steadfast and sincere love. The concluding sentence &quot;If love lasts for a long time, how can it last day and night&quot; is the most profound. These two sentences not only refer to the characteristics of the love model of Cowherd and Weaver Girl, but also express the author&#39;s view of love. They are highly condensed quotes. Good sentences. This poem therefore has aesthetic value and artistic taste across eras and countries. This poem combines scenery, lyricism and discussion, narrating the mythical story of the love between the Morning Glory and the Weaver Girl. It gives the fairy couple a strong human touch and sings the praises of sincere, delicate, pure and steadfast love. The poem clearly describes the twin stars in the sky, and implicitly describes the lovers in the world; its lyrical expression uses happy scenes to describe sorrow, and sad scenes to describe joy, doubling the sorrow and joy. It is soul-stirring and touching when read. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>; At the beginning of the poem, it says &quot;Slender clouds make clever things&quot;. The soft and colorful clouds change into many beautiful and clever patterns, showing how exquisite the Weaver Girl&#39;s craftsmanship is. However, such a beautiful person cannot live a beautiful life with the one he loves. &quot;Flying stars convey hatred&quot;, those shining stars seem to convey their sorrow and hatred, flying across the sky. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>; Regarding the Milky Way, &quot;Nineteen Ancient Poems&quot; says: &quot;The river is clear and shallow, how far apart is it? It is full of water, and the pulse is speechless.&quot; The water is full of water, so close that it seems to be connected to each other. His expression and voice are all astonishing. Here, Qin Guan wrote: &quot;The Milky Way and Han Dynasty are so far apart&quot;, using the word &quot;far away&quot; to describe the vastness of the Milky Way and how far apart the Milky Way is. This change makes the relationship deeper and highlights the pain of lovesickness. The vast distance of the Milky Way separates two people who love each other. How difficult it is to meet each other! The word &quot;darkness&quot; not only embodies the meaning of the Chinese Valentine&#39;s Day, but also closely links to the word &quot;hate&quot;. They walked at night and came all the way to meet each other. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>; Next, the poet started writing and praised with emotional comments: &quot;Once the golden wind and jade dew meet, they will win countless people in the world!&quot; A long-separated couple on the golden wind and jade dew night, the blue sky We met on the bank of the Milky Way. This beautiful moment is worth meeting thousands of times in the world. The poet passionately praises an ideal holy and eternal love. &quot;Golden Wind and Jade Dew&quot; is based on Li Shangyin&#39;s poem &quot;Xinwei Qixi&quot;: &quot;I&#39;m afraid it&#39;s a good time to say goodbye to the immortal family, so I teach you to make a good time. It comes from the blue sky beside the Milky Way, and it&#39;s the golden wind and jade dew.&quot; It is used to describe the time when we meet on the Chinese Valentine&#39;s Day. The scenery, but also has a profound meaning. The poet sets this precious meeting against the background of golden wind, jade dew, ice and pure jade, showing the noble purity and otherworldliness of this kind of love. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>; &quot;Tenderness is like water&quot;, the affection between two lovers is like the silent flowing water, so gentle and lingering. &quot;Tenderness is like water&quot;, &quot;like water&quot; echoes &quot;Yinhan is far away&quot;, it is a metaphor based on the scene, which is very natural. How could it not be heart-breaking that the one-night-long wedding suddenly passed away like a dream, only to see each other and then be separated again? &quot;A good time is like a dream&quot;, in addition to describing the short time of meeting, it also describes the complex emotions of lovers when they meet. &quot;Endurance to look at the magpie bridge and the way back&quot; is a transliteration of separation. The magpie bridge where we just met has suddenly become the way back to separate from the lover. Not saying that I couldn&#39;t bear to leave, but saying that I couldn&#39;t bear to see the Magpie Bridge on my way back. The euphemistic meaning contained infinite feelings of farewell and infinite bitter tears. Looking back on the tryst during the wedding day, I doubted whether it was true or false, it was like a dream or an illusion. When we went to the Magpie Bridge to say goodbye, our love was at its peak. At this point, the word pen suddenly turned around and burst out with a high-pitched sound: &quot;If the love lasts for a long time, how can it last day and night!&quot; Qin Guan&#39;s two lines reveal the true meaning of love: love must withstand long-term separation. The test of love, as long as we can sincerely love each other, even if we are separated all year round, it is much more valuable than the vulgar taste of being together day and night. These two highly emotional comments have become an eternal masterpiece among love hymns. They echo the discussion in the first film. In this way, the upper and second films have the same structure, with narrative and discussion alternating, thus forming a continuous and ups and downs of emotion in the whole article. This correct view of love and this noble spiritual realm far exceed similar works in ancient times and are very commendable. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The discussion of this poem is free and smooth, easy to understand, but also elegant and subtle, with endless aftertaste. The author combines the finishing touch of argumentation and prose syntax with beautiful images and deep emotions to sing the ups and downs of the beautiful love in the world, achieving excellent artistic effects. &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;Creative background&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>; Regarding the creative background of this word, Liu Yonggang, a professor at Yangzhou University, believes that this word was written by Qin Guan in Chenzhou, southern Hunan, to express his feelings for Changsha. , the time is the Chinese Valentine&#39;s Day in the fourth year of Emperor Zhezong&#39;s reign in the Song Dynasty (AD 1097). In the spring of 1096 AD (the third year of Shaosheng&#39;s reign), Qin Guan took charge of Chenzhou by supervising the prefecture&#39;s wine tax and cutting the state&#39;s wine tax. Changsha was the only way to go. Regarding Changsha&#39;s righteousness advocacy, Volume 2 of Hong Mai&#39;s &quot;Yijian Zhibu&quot; has a more detailed description: &quot;The righteousness advocate is from Changsha, and I don&#39;t know his surname. He has a family background and is good at praising. He is especially fond of Qin Shaoyue Mansion and gets a title. &quot;Psalms, often written or spoken,&quot; Qin Guan moved south, passing by Changsha, visiting the local customs of Tan, and met this geisha. Qin Guan saw that her appearance was beautiful and her words were sincere, so she revealed her identity. The geisha was surprised and happy, and she entertained Shao You attentively and sang all over the Huaihai Yuefu. Qin Guan was in love with her for several days. When she was leaving, the geisha expressed her wish to serve her. Qin Guan promised her that he would meet again when he returned to the north and it would be the day of Yu Fei. After several years of separation, Qin Guan died in Teng County, Guangxi. Geisha traveled hundreds of miles to pay tribute to Qin Guan and died in mourning. The story of the geisha &quot;is still passed down by Hunan people as a strange thing.&quot; Hong Mai mentioned that Changzhou school official Zhong Jiangzhi was inspired by the incident and wrote a biography of the geisha, which was named &quot;Yi Shang Zhuan&quot;. At that time, Qin Guan&#39;s road to relegation was still going south, and he and the Changsha singer had to say goodbye in tears. After arriving in Chenzhou, Qin Guan missed his lover day and night, but with his sinful body and life in danger, it was not easy to get together. In fact, the heavy sigh in the last two sentences of &quot;Tasha Xing·Chenzhou Hostel&quot; &quot;The Chenjiang River has fortunately circled Chenshan Mountain, for whom did it flow down to Xiaoxiang&quot; also contains the longing for the geisha in Changsha. On the Chinese Valentine&#39;s Day in 1097 AD (the fourth year of Shaosheng&#39;s reign), Qin Guan wrote the song &quot;Magpie Bridge Immortal&quot; in Chenzhou. He expressed his love for the Changsha singing girl through the meeting of the two stars of Ox and Girl on the Magpie Bridge. &lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;About the author&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;div>;&lt;center>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://song.gushiwen.cn/authorImg/qinguan.jpg&quot; width=50%>;&lt;/ center>;&lt;/div>;Qin Guan (1049-1100), also known as Taixu and Shaoyou, was also nicknamed Hangou Jushi and known as Mr. Huaihai in the world.
