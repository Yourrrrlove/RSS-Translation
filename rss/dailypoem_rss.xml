Today I climbed up the tower and watched the sky clear after the snow. of beautiful scenery. &lt;br />;The snow piled up in front of the Xia Yu altar outside the city is like a white building, and Xishi Pu in the distance seems to be covered with a hazy veil. &lt;br />;Between the windows under the curtains of the city tower, there was a strong cold wind blowing at dusk, and the setting sun outside the city wall had slanting rays of light pouring down from the top of the building. &lt;br />;Looking far into the distance, there are still a few dim lights in the cold twilight, and the green shadows of the lakes and mountains reflect the homes in this area. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Notes&lt;br />;&lt;/strong>;Yingke: refers to the poet. &lt;br />;Curtains: Curtains and window panels. &lt;br />;Looking squinting: looking squinting, showing arrogance. &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;Appreciation&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;p>; Climbing high to look far, drinking wine and composing poems have been the hobbies of literati throughout the ages. After the chest is full of joy, anger, sorrow, and daydreaming, it often becomes one with the things in front of you, forgetting both things and myself, and thus entering a wonderful realm. It&#39;s just that the emotions expressed by ancient poets were more sad, sad, and lost, and less joyful, exciting, and happy. Xie Lingyun was frustrated in his official career. He went upstairs to the pond in early spring and fell in love with the beautiful scenery of &quot;spring grass grows in the pond and willows in the garden turn into songbirds&quot;. He retreated and meditated, but he lamented that &quot;it is easy to live in isolation forever, but it is difficult to live in isolation&quot;, which was quite self-pitying. the taste of. Xie Tiao, Li Bai&#39;s favorite poet, is very famous for his &quot;Climbing Three Mountains at Night and Looking at the Capital City&quot;. He admired the beautiful scenery of &quot;The noisy birds cover the spring continent, and the miscellaneous heroes fill the fields&quot;. However, when thinking of his own experience, he longed for his hometown. However, when I was born, I had the sorrow of &quot;How sad is the good time, my tears are like falling raindrops&quot;. When Chen Ziang climbed up to Youzhou Terrace, his eyes were filled with desolation and vastness, and his resentment for not being able to recognize his talent was palpable. Du Fu had been wandering for many years, suffering from old age, illness, and loneliness. His feeling when he climbed up was that he was &quot;a frequent guest in the sad autumn for thousands of miles, and he came to the stage alone after suffering from a hundred years of illness.&quot; When Li Bai ascended the Phoenix Tower, Jiang Liu&#39;s history was ridiculed by the government; when Cui Hao ascended the Yellow Crane Tower, everything he saw turned into nostalgia. Empress Li was the king who had subjugated his country. He &quot;went up to the west tower alone without a word&quot;, and looked at each other, making anyone who saw him sad. Wang Anshi was a man of reform, &quot;he came to see him off, it was the late autumn of his homeland, and the weather was beginning to be calm.&quot; Ying Huai Those who only have feelings of concern for the country and the people. Zhang Ji&#39;s life did not have many ups and downs, but due to the times, society and other reasons, it was difficult for him to overcome sadness and sadness when he climbed high. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Zhang Ji is good at describing scenes. He often embodies sincere emotions in his vivid descriptions. When Xue Ji climbs a building, his emotions, scenes, images and images are perfectly combined in his writing, making them completely indistinguishable. realm. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; When the clouds were clearing and the snow was falling, the poet climbed up to the ancient county city tower and took a closer look and a distant view. The building was made of silver and was white, beautiful and quiet. It was as if he was in a fairyland. His soul was purified and he was very happy. However, the Ying Chu wanderers who were &quot;alone as strangers in a foreign land&quot; took refuge in Wuyue County. Although they were overjoyed, they had a special realization: on Wolong Mountain not far away, there is the tomb of Wenzhong, a great master in the Spring and Autumn Period. Thinking back to those days, He made great contributions to the revival of the Yue Kingdom, but in the end he was given a sword by Gou Jian to commit suicide. From a distance, in front of Xia Yu&#39;s mausoleum, there are clearly snow-covered buildings, which are extremely beautiful. This man had great merit in controlling floods, and then went east to hunt for Kuaiji and died. The ancient sages were loved and respected by the people. Looking from another direction, the waterside of Xishi Huansha seems to have plain silk and white gauze swaying in front of the eyes. It is a pity that this peerless beauty who was appointed to the national crisis was still criticized and criticized by the world after she sold her house and died. The poet writes about the scenery due to love, and has entered the realm of self. His emotions are extremely complicated and difficult to describe. He combines admiration, admiration, and regret in one ink, and then he is worried about the chaotic life of taking refuge in Jiangnan after the Anshi Rebellion. It alludes to the declining Tang Dynasty. Therefore, in the evening, I feel so cold that I have to put down the curtains and have no intention of admiring the &quot;red-clad scenery&quot; under the afterglow of the setting sun. At this time, the red sun is fading, and the scenery of Wolong Mountain and Jinghu Lake are still clearly distinguishable. , making the poet feel sad and happy. It can be said that &quot;there is a true meaning in this, but I have forgotten to tell it&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The first couplet is &quot;rising&quot;, and the scenery is so beautiful and pleasant that even a person who is desperate and seeking refuge cannot turn a blind eye; the chin couplet is &quot;fu&quot;, mourning the past and regretting the present, and admiring at the same time; the neck couplet is &quot;fu&quot; again , facing the reality, the relationship seems to have hit the bottom; the last couplet is slightly &quot;rising&quot;, which echoes the first couplet, there is &quot;twilight&quot; and &quot;clear reflection&quot;, which gives people some comfort. It&#39;s really hard to tell whether it&#39;s love or scenery. &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;About the author&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;Zhang Ji (about 715~about 779), courtesy name Yisun, Han nationality, was from Xiangzhou (now Xiangyang, Hubei). A poet of the Tang Dynasty, little is known about his life. According to various records, we only know that he was a Jinshi in the twelfth year of Tianbao (AD 753). In the Dali calendar, Wai Lang, a member of the Jixiao Temple, was the salt and iron judge of Hongzhou (now Nanchang City, Jiangxi). His poems are hearty and exciting, without any refinement, deep in metaphor, and both logical and logical. They have a great influence on later generations.

It is a flock with the wrens, and does not follow the phoenixes and the like. Carrying and nurturing four chicks, the milk intake was often insufficient. When I eat the chaff of the world, I am often afraid of the black kite coming to snatch me away. It is shameful to venture into the dangers of Taixing, and it is shameful to follow the overturned millet and fly to eat it. Destiny has its own destiny, and to maintain one&#39;s duties, one has to cut off this little desire of one&#39;s own. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Notes&lt;/strong>;&lt;br />;Wren: The name of the bird, which is like a yellow bird but small. &lt;br />;Yellow mouth: young bird. &lt;br />;Kite: Bird of prey of the hawk family. &lt;br />;Wuchiesu: Allusions are used here. &lt;br />;Min: status, position. &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;Brief Analysis&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>; &quot;The Bird in the Empty City&quot; is an old title of Yuefu&#39;s &quot;Miscellaneous Songs and Songs&quot;. In this poem, the poet expresses his resentment and helplessness of being unable to stretch his ambitions, but not wanting to compromise, and can only live a miserable life. &lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;About the author&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;div>;&lt;center>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://song.gushiwen.cn/authorImg/libai.jpg&quot; width=50%>;&lt;/ center>;&lt;/div>;Li Bai (701-762), also known as Taibai, also known as Qinglian Jushi, also known as &quot;Exiled Immortal&quot;, was a great romantic poet in the Tang Dynasty.
