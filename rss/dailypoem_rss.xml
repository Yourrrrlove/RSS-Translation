The song sinks into the jade trees, and there are sparse bells and hair in the ancient temple. The rise and fall of the six generations is like a dream, and Ran Ran is shocked by the time and the moon. The war was destroyed. Luxury items are sold out, and silver toads are rarely seen. &lt;br />;The ebb and flow create waves, and the trees in the river are as dense as hair. Whoever wants to move back will damage the boss&#39;s reputation. Even if the years are cold and the journey is far away, this ambition should be difficult to capture. Who builds tall buildings? Leaning on the lantern and gazing, the independent fisherman is full of snow in the river. &lt;/div>;&lt;h3>;Translation and annotations&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;Appreciation&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;p>; To understand Li Gang’s thoughts and feelings in this poem, we must first understand him Have a general understanding of their political stance and life experiences. Li Gang firmly advocated resisting the Jin Dynasty throughout his life and was one of the famous representatives of the Anti-Japanese War faction. As early as the seventh year of Xuanhe, when the Jin soldiers invaded and Song Huizong panicked and was eager to escape, Li Gang stabbed his arm and wrote a letter in blood, urging resistance to the war. Emperor Qinzong of the Song Dynasty appointed Li Gang as the Minister of War, and later as Minister Youcheng. In the first year of Jingkang (1126), Jin soldiers besieged Bianjing. Li Gang appointed Shangshu Youcheng as his personal camp envoy. He &quot;climbed to the city to supervise the battle, killed thousands of people, and then retreated.&quot; (&quot;Da Jin Guo Zhi&quot;) The Lord He sent Li Bangyan and others to depose Li Gang to thank the Jin people. When Emperor Gaozong of the Southern Song Dynasty came to the throne, he once appointed Li Gang as prime minister. Li Gang actively prepared for war and the enemy did not dare to attack. Later, because Emperor Gaozong listened to the capitulation faction&#39;s slander, Li Gang only reigned for seventy-five days and was dismissed and reviled. In the second year of Shaoxing (1132), he was appointed as the envoy of Hunan Xuanfu and also knew Tanzhou, and moved to Hongzhou. Although he was appointed in his later years, he was appointed as a foreign official and had no right to interfere in the government affairs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; From Li Gang&#39;s life experience, it can be seen that with the fierce conflict between the imperial court and the war, he set off huge waves in his official career, and he also rose and fell in these ups and downs. A patriotic enthusiasm of loyalty and resentment is poured into the words. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; This song &quot;Liu Mo Ling&quot; was probably written after Li Gang was demoted in the early days of the southern crossing. By using Jinling to recall the past, I can express my resentment that my ambitions are hard to achieve and my determination to resist the Jinling resolutely. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The first film is about nostalgia for Jinling. &quot;The Yangtze River is thousands of miles away, and the fresh water is full of smoke and clouds are vast.&quot; The Yangtze River is thousands of miles away, rolling eastward. Looking around, the river is broad and the clouds are low. Du Fu once lamented that &quot;the endless Yangtze River is rolling in&quot; (&quot;Deng Gao&quot;). Su Shi also said, &quot;The wanderers have collected all the romantic figures of the ages&quot; (&quot;Niannujiao&quot;). Li Gang couldn&#39;t help but feel nostalgic about the past. &quot;The song is silent in the Yushu, and there are sparse bells in the ancient temple.&quot; &quot;Flowers in the Backyard of the Yushu&quot; created by Queen Chen of the Southern Dynasty, the song has long since fallen silent and can no longer be heard. All that was heard was the sparse bells of the ancient temple, echoing over the thousands of miles of Yangtze River. &quot;Flowers in the Backyard of Yushu&quot; is a representative of the obscene music at that time. The silence of singing marked the demise of the Chen Dynasty. Several pestles and clocks, intermittent and intermittent, exaggerate the lonely and desolate nostalgic atmosphere, arouse people&#39;s feeling of &quot;thinking about the leisurely time of heaven and earth&quot; (Chen Zi&#39;ang&#39;s &quot;Deng Youzhou Terrace&quot;), and constitute a specific situation in terms of time and space. Back then, the Wu, Eastern Jin, Song, Qi, Liang, and Chen dynasties all had their capitals in Jiankang (Jinling, today&#39;s Nanjing City), and the capital of Zuo was relatively short-lived. The Six Dynasties had one thing in common: their monarchs had no ambitions, were extremely extravagant, did not try to cheer up, and had excessive sexual pleasures, which eventually led to the collapse of the Six Dynasties one after another, like a dream. Li Shangyin, a poet of the late Tang Dynasty, said with profound emotion: &quot;Three hundred years of dreaming of the same dawn&quot; (&quot;Ode to History&quot;). Wei Zhuang also lamented that &quot;the Six Dynasties are like dreams and birds crowing in the sky.&quot; (&quot;Taicheng&quot;) Therefore, the poem laments that &quot;the rise and fall of the six generations is like a dream, and the time is astonishing.&quot; Time flies by, and the years are shocking. Now, due to the passage of time, the traces of war have been wiped out, and luxury has been sold out. , &quot;The old things of the Six Dynasties flow with the flowing water&quot; (Wang Anshi&#39;s &quot;Fragrance of Guizhi&quot;), &quot;Dancing on the pavilion and singing stage, the wind is always blown away by the rain.&quot; (Xin Qiji&#39;s &quot;Yong Yu Le&quot;) &quot;It is rare to see the silver toad self-recovery.&quot; Silver toad refers to the moon. The author believes that only the bright moon in the sky can see the changes of dynasties, the ups and downs of the human world. No matter &quot;the song sinks to the jade tree&quot; or &quot;the prosperity disappears&quot;, it will still be round and missing year after year, and round again when it is missing. She is a witness to history. This meaning is quite similar to Liu Yuxi&#39;s &quot;The old moon on the east side of the Huai River came over the female wall late at night.&quot; (&quot;Stone City&quot;). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The nostalgia in the previous film is not nostalgia for the sake of nostalgia, nor is it an elegy for the fall of the Six Dynasties. Behind the nostalgia, the author&#39;s political opinions and historical lessons are placed, hoping that the rulers of the Southern Song Dynasty can use the rise and fall of the Six Dynasties as a mirror of history and not repeat the mistakes of the fall of the Six Dynasties. His loyalty can shine through the sun and the moon. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The next film is lyrical about the scene, &quot;The ebb and flow create waves, and the trees in the river are as dense as hair.&quot; Sen means dense; hair means hair. &quot;The trees in the river are as dense as hair&quot; refers to the trees in the river being as dense as hair. The two sentences &quot;Ebb and flow&quot; transition from the nostalgia of the scene in the first film to the lyrical expression of the scene in the second film. Poyang is close to Poyang Lake, and the lake water flows into the Yangtze River, which is related to the above sentence &quot;The Yangtze River is thousands of miles away, and the smoke is &quot;The clouds are vast in the fresh water&quot;, so I think of &quot;the ebb and flow of the tide&quot;, and my heart is also ups and downs, and I have a lot of things on my mind. Thinking that I have been repeatedly denounced, as a immigrant, who can pity my &quot;boss&#39;s reputation&quot;? &quot;The boss&#39;s reputation&quot; The core of &quot;Festival&quot; still refers to the fact that he was the eldest son in his old age and was repeatedly demoted. His ambition to fight against the Jin Dynasty was not fulfilled, and he was unable to achieve success and fame. He was deeply lamented. But he said that &quot;even if the years are cold and the journey is long, this ambition should be difficult to win.&quot; &quot;The year is cold&quot;, see &quot;The Analects of Confucius&quot;: &quot;The year is cold, and then we know that the pines and cypresses will wither. &quot;This ambition should be difficult to seize&quot;, paraphrasing &quot;The Analects of Confucius&quot;: &quot;An ordinary man cannot seize his ambition.&quot; &quot;Capture&quot; means change. Li Gang said that although it is &quot;cold&quot; (a metaphor for the dangerous and difficult environment), he will be as green and tall as pines and cypresses, not afraid of ice and snow; although the &quot;distance is long&quot;, he will drive away the Jin soldiers. , the goal cannot be achieved in the short term, but he is not afraid of the persecution of the capitulationists. No matter how dangerous the environment is, no matter how long the road to achieve the goal is, he decides to persevere and remain determined.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Conclusion &quot;The independent fisherman is full of snow on the river&quot;. This is adapted from Liu Zongyuan&#39;s poem &quot;A man in a boat with a coir raincoat, fishing alone in the snow on the cold river&quot; (&quot;Snow on the River&quot;). Liu Zongyuan was demoted to Yongzhou, and as a foreigner, he described himself as a fisherman who stood proud of the snow despite the wind. Li Gang felt that he had some similarities with Liu Zongyuan, so he also used the image of a fisherman to describe himself, allowing readers to understand his tenacious fighting spirit from the artistic image of a fisherman who is proudly independent at the head of the river and is not afraid of the wind and snow in the river.&lt;/p >; &lt;p>; This poem has some similarities with the four poems &quot;Jinling Nostalgia&quot; written by the author in the third year of Xuanhe (1121). For example: &quot;The Yushu Song sinks and the moon becomes round&quot;, &quot;The war destroyed the old city&quot; &quot;Desolate&quot;, &quot;Luxury has spread all over the city.&quot; His poems and lyrics are consistent in thoughts and feelings. The language style of this poem is also quite like poetry. The lyrics are deeply emotional, nostalgic for the past and sad for the present, low and depressed.&lt; /p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;About the author&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;div>;&lt;center>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://song.gushiwen.cn/authorImg/ligang.jpg&quot; width=50% >;&lt;/center>;&lt;/div>;Li Gang (1083-February 5, 1140), a famous official and national hero who fought against the Jin Dynasty in the late Northern Song Dynasty and early Southern Song Dynasty.

(Later work: Xiao)&lt;br />;Two waters hold a bright mirror, and a rainbow falls on the two bridges. &lt;br />;The crowds are cold and the orange and pomelo trees are crowded, while the old sycamore trees are in autumn colors. &lt;br />;Whoever reads the North Tower will feel grateful to the Duke in the wind. &lt;/div>;&lt;h3>;Translation and annotations&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Translation&lt;/strong>;&lt;br />;The city on the riverside is as beautiful as in a painting, and the mountains are getting darker. Go up to Xie Tiao Tower and overlook the clear sky. &lt;br />;Between the two rivers, a pool of lake water is like a bright mirror; Phoenix Bridge and Jichuan Bridge are like rainbows falling into the world. &lt;br />;The thin cold smoke rising from the villages lingers among the oranges and pomelos. In late autumn, the sycamore trees are already withered and yellow. &lt;br />;Who else but me would think of coming to Xie Tiao North Tower, facing the bleak autumn wind, and missing Mr. Xie? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Notes&lt;/strong>;&lt;br />;Xie Tiao North Tower: Xie Tiao Tower was built by the Qi poet Xie Tiao in the Southern Dynasty when he was the prefect of Xuancheng. of tourist attractions. Xie Tiao is a poet whom Li Bai admires very much. &lt;br />;Jiangcheng: generally refers to a city by the water, here it refers to Xuancheng. In the dialect of the Jiangnan area in the Tang Dynasty, both large and small rivers were called &quot;jiang&quot;. &lt;br />;Two waters: refers to Wanxi and Juxi. There is Phoenix Bridge on Wanxi River and Jichuan Bridge on Juxi River. &lt;br />;Dingjing: Refers to the circular shape formed by the arch bridge hole and its reflection in the water, like a bright mirror. &lt;br />;Shuangqiao: refers to Phoenix Bridge and Jichuan Bridge, built during the reign of Emperor Kaihuang of the Sui Dynasty (the reign of Emperor Wen of the Sui Dynasty, 581-600 AD). &lt;br />;Rainbow: refers to the shadow of the bridge in the water. &lt;br />;Human smoke: smoke from people’s homes. &lt;br />;North Tower: namely Xie Tiao Tower. &lt;br />;Xie Gong: Xie Tiao. &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;Appreciation&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;p>; The Xie Zao North Tower was built by the Southern Qi poet Xie Zao when he was the prefect of Xuancheng. A tourist attraction in Xuancheng. Xuancheng is surrounded by mountains and rivers. Lingyang has winding hills and three tall peaks. The streams of Juxi and Wanxi reflect the whole suburb. It is really like &quot;when birds go and birds come back, in the mountains, people sing and people cry.&quot; &quot;In the sound&quot; (Du Mu&#39;s &quot;Inscribed on the Water Pavilion of Kaiyuan Temple in Xuanzhou, a resident of Wanxi River Jiaxi&quot;). This poem was written in the thirteenth year of Tianbao (754). After the Mid-Autumn Festival of this year, Li Bai came to Xuancheng again from Jinling. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;The river city is like a painting, and the mountains look at the clear sky at night.&quot; The first couplet says that the city by the river is as beautiful as in the painting. One clear autumn evening, the poet climbed up to Xie Gong Tower alone. The shadow of Languang Mountain is so clear! Looking down from a height, this &quot;River City&quot; looks like it is in a painting. In the first two sentences, the poet summarizes the scenery he saw when he visited, and takes the entire article, which immediately attracts the reader deeply and enters the artistic conception of the poem. This is Li Bai&#39;s commonly used &quot;getting to the point&quot; expression technique. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;Two rivers hold a bright mirror, and two bridges hold a rainbow.&quot; The couplet means that between the two rivers, a lake is like a bright mirror; the two bridges on the river are like rainbows falling from the sky. &quot;Two waters&quot; refers to Juxi and Wanxi. Wanxi originates from Yishan Mountain, meets Juxi in the northeast of Xuancheng, and merges around the city, so it is called &quot;clip&quot;. Because it is autumn, the stream is clearer and flows calmly, with crystal light shining on the surface of the waves. &quot;Dingjing&quot; is the most appropriate way to describe it. &quot;Double Bridge&quot; refers to the upper and lower bridges across the stream. The upper bridge is called Fenghuang Bridge, outside Taihe Gate in the southeast of the city; the lower bridge is called Jichuan Bridge, outside Yangde Gate in the east of the city. They are both buildings built during the Kaihuang Period (581-600) of Emperor Wen of the Sui Dynasty. These two long bridges are built over the stream, reflecting in the water. Looking from a distance from a high-rise building, the clear stream water and the bright red sunset are reflected in the bright and dim light, and the shadows of the bridges reflect infinite and strange bright colors. Where is the bridge here? They are simply two rainbows in the sky, and the shadow of this &quot;rainbow&quot; falls into the &quot;mirror&quot;. Here the poet&#39;s imagination is rich and wonderful, and his writing is lively and ethereal, which is once again amazing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;The orange and pomelo trees are cold among the people, but the old sycamore trees look beautiful in autumn.&quot; The neck couplet says that the tangerine and pomelo trees are hidden in the chilling smoke; the autumn colors are vast, and the sycamore trees also look old. In the evening of autumn, the wilderness is quiet, and wisps of cooking smoke emerge from the jungles on the hills. The deep green of the oranges and pomeloes and the faint yellow of the sycamores present a cold scene, making people feel that it is time for the autumn light to grow old. . It is not difficult for us to imagine that the poet&#39;s mood at that time was completely immersed in his vision, his observations were profound and meticulous, and his descriptions were not sticky. He stood high, looked far, captured the feeling of the moment, and used extremely concise language to outline the outline of a late autumn with random touches, deeply revealing the atmosphere of the season and environment. It not only writes the autumn scenery, but also writes the autumn mood. If we understand it carefully, we will find that it is highly summarized and is very precise. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The two middle couplets are specific descriptions. The artistic images created in these four lines of poetry are all derived from the word &quot;wang&quot; in the first couplet. From the structural relationship point of view, the first two sentences say &quot;the river city is picturesque&quot; and the next two sentences say &quot;the mountains are clear at night&quot;; the four sentences are a complete unity, but they are layered. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;Whoever misses Mr. Xie in the North Tower will miss Mr. Xie in the wind.&quot; The last couplet means, who else but me would think of coming to Xie Tiao&#39;s North Tower, facing the bleak autumn wind, to miss Mr. Xie? ? These last two sentences seem very simple on the surface. They just echo the first two sentences and indicate that the place to visit is in the North Tower. This North Tower was built by Xie Zao. From the visit to the nostalgia, It seems to be the usual formula, so Li Bai couldn&#39;t help but say something in memory of the ancients. What is worth noting here is the word &quot;who reads&quot;. The &quot;Huai&quot; in &quot;Huai Xie Gong&quot; refers to the author himself; the &quot;Nian&quot; in &quot;Who Nian&quot; refers to others. The meaning of the two sentences is that no one can understand the feeling of lamenting that one is &quot;feeling grateful to the father in the face of the wind&quot;. This is no ordinary nostalgia. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; After Li Bai was politically marginalized by the powerful and abandoned his official position, he was politically frustrated and lived a wandering life. The depression and sentimentality among the guests, especially when the autumn wind is blowing, can be imagined. Xuancheng is his old travel place, and now he is here again. As soon as he arrived in Xuancheng, he would miss Xie Zhen. This was not only because Xie Zhen left behind such historical sites as Diezhang Tower in Xuancheng, but more importantly, Xie Zhen had the same feelings towards Xuancheng as he did. When Li Bai was alone on Xie Zhen&#39;s tower, facing the mountains and rivers that Xie Zhen had admired, he remembered the tragic life of this poet of the previous generation whom he had always admired. Although ancient and modern times are different, the spirit of their cultural genes But they are far apart. This confused mood reflects his political depression and loneliness; precisely because he was politically suppressed and could not find a way out, he had no choice but to devote himself to the mountains and rivers and to be friends with the ancients. Who could understand his complicated feelings at that time? &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;Creative background&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>; The specific creation time of this poem is unknown, but it should be similar to &quot;Farewell to Secretary Shu Yun at Xietiao Tower in Xuanzhou&quot;, shortly before the Anshi Rebellion broke out. In the autumn of 753 AD (the twelfth year of Tianbao) and 754 AD (the thirteenth year of Tianbao), Li Bai came to Xuancheng twice. This poem is considered to be after the Mid-Autumn Festival in 753 or 754 AD. &lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;About the author&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;div>;&lt;center>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://song.gushiwen.cn/authorImg/libai.jpg&quot; width=50%>;&lt;/ center>;&lt;/div>;Li Bai (701-762), also known as Taibai, also known as Qinglian Jushi, also known as &quot;Exiled Immortal&quot;, was a great romantic poet in the Tang Dynasty. He was hailed as the &quot;Poetry Immortal&quot; by later generations, and was the same as Du Fu They are collectively known as &quot;Li Du&quot;. In order to distinguish them from the other two poets Li Shangyin and Du Mu, who are known as &quot;Little Li Du&quot;, Du Fu and Li Bai are also collectively known as &quot;Big Li Du&quot;. According to the &quot;New Book of Tang&quot; records, Li Bai was the ninth grandson of Emperor Xingsheng (Liang Wuzhao King Li Hao) and the same clan as the kings of Li and Tang Dynasties. He is a cheerful and generous person who loves drinking, writing poetry, and making friends. Li Bai was deeply influenced by Huang Lao Liezhuang&#39;s thoughts. The &quot;Collection of Li Taibai&quot; has been handed down from generation to generation. Most of his poems were written when he was drunk. His representative works include &quot;Wang Lushan Waterfall&quot;, &quot;The Road is Difficult&quot;, &quot;The Road to Shu is Difficult&quot;, &quot;About Wine&quot; and &quot;Morning&quot;. &quot;Fa Baidi City&quot; and so on. &lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 17 Sep 2023 04:23:05 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
