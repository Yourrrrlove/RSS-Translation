Jian Lang laughs at Ao, but the center is mourning. &lt;br />;At the end of the wind and haze, Hui Ran is willing to come. Don&#39;t go there, don&#39;t come back, I&#39;ll think about it for a long time. &lt;br />;The wind is windy at the end of the day, and it will be windy soon. If you don&#39;t want to talk, you won&#39;t sleep; if you want to talk, you will sneeze. &lt;br />;Zhao is its yin, and the scorpion is its thunder. If you don&#39;t talk, you won&#39;t sleep, but if you want to talk, you will be pregnant. &lt;/div>;&lt;h3>;Translation and annotations&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Translation&lt;br />;&lt;/strong>;The wind blows all day long, strong and urgent, and sometimes he turns back to me and just smiles A smile. It was all teasing, debauchery, ridicule and arrogance, which made me feel deeply sad and lonely. &lt;br />;The wind is blowing all day long and the rain and mist cover the air. Is he willing to come home happily? This heartless person never comes or goes, leaving me missing him for so long and far away. &lt;br />;The wind has been blowing all day long and the sky is gloomy. It was gloomy the day before yesterday and I felt dizzy for a few days. As soon as I wake up from the dream, it is difficult to fall asleep again. I miss you so much when I catch a cold. &lt;br />;The wind was miserable, the sky was dark and the ground was dark, and the thunder could be heard faintly in the distance. When I woke up from my dreamland, I couldn&#39;t fall asleep again. I couldn&#39;t relieve my sadness. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Notes&lt;br />;&lt;/strong>;End: One talks about the end of the day, the other talks about the end. Violent: sudden, violent. &lt;br />;谑(xuè) langxiaiaoao: joking: teasing, teasing. Lang, debauchery. Ao, indulgence. &lt;br />;Center: the heart. It&#39;s mourning: mourning is. Mourning, sadness and fear. &lt;br />;Haze (mái): haze. Turbidity caused by large amounts of smoke and dust suspended in the air. &lt;br />;Hui: Shun. &lt;br />;Don&#39;t go back and don&#39;t come back: don&#39;t interact with each other. &lt;br />;曀 (yì): cloudy and windy. &lt;br />;No sun: no sun. Yes, same as &quot;you&quot;. &lt;br />;寤: Awake. Words: me. Meng: fall asleep. &lt;br />;Sneeze (tì): sneeze. There is a folk proverb that &quot;when you sneeze, someone thinks.&quot; &lt;br />;曀怀: The sky is dark and dark. &lt;br />;虺 (huǐ): describes the sound of thunder. &lt;br />;Huai: missing. &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;Appreciation&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;p>; This poem has four chapters in total. In a woman&#39;s voice, she was devastated by her husband&#39;s wanton teasing, but after her husband left, she turned to hatred and worried that he would never come back. She had trouble sleeping late at night, hoping that her husband would repent and miss her too. His emotions change again and again, truly conveying the ambivalence of hating and loving, knowing that there is no hope but being unable to let go. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first chapter, about entertainment, is written from the perspective of both men and women. &quot;Jie Lang laughs at Ao&quot;, &quot;Lu Shi&quot; says: &quot;Jie means joking. Lang means cuteness. Laughter means joy. Ao means comfort.&quot; Four verbs are used to describe the man&#39;s indulgence and roughness, and his intention is For the joy of the time. &quot;The center is mourning.&quot; mourning means worry and worry. It means that the woman is worried about being abandoned in the future and is focused on the fear of the future. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The second chapter uses &quot;mourning&quot; to describe the woman&#39;s mood after being abandoned. &quot;Hui Ran is willing to come&quot;, the doubtful tone is filled with a woman&#39;s hope; &quot;Don&#39;t go and never come&quot;, the affirmative answer is filled with a woman&#39;s despair. &quot;Longer I&#39;m Thinking&quot; leads to the second level of emotional thoughts, which also leads to the following two chapters in terms of structure. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The third and fourth chapters show the depth of &quot;thinking&quot;. &quot;If you wish to speak, you will sneeze&quot; and &quot;If you wish to speak, you will be pregnant&quot; are written in a tortuous way, which means that the woman imagines whether the man misses her. And when it comes down to men, it corresponds to the story about men having fun in the first chapter. The structure of the whole poem is natural and regular. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Each chapter of the poem adopts the expression technique of &quot;comparison&quot;. Inspired by the comparison, the poem shows horrifying scenes such as the rushing wind, flying dust, lack of light from the sun and moon, and the faint sound of thunder, which set off the tragic fate of the heroine and has a strong artistic impact. This is unique among ancient poems about love and marriage. &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;Creative background&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>; Regarding the background of this poem, &quot;Mao&#39;s Preface&quot; believes that it was written when Zhuang Jiang was bullied by Zhouxu, the son of Duke Zhuang&#39;s concubine. Zhu Xi believed that Zhuang Jiang was bullied by his husband, Duke Zhuang of Wei. Modern scholars generally believe that this poem describes a woman&#39;s experience of being teased, ridiculed, and abandoned by her husband. It should come from a folk song and has nothing to do with Zhuang Jiang. &lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;About the author&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 30 Oct 2023 05:23:10 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[梦中作 | 欧阳修]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://feedx.net/read?r=shiwen&d=2310302]]><description> &lt;h2>;Written in a Dream&lt;/h2>;[Song Dynasty] Ouyang Xiu&lt;div style=&quot;color: #5b4636;&quot;>;Playing the flute in the cold night, thousands of mountains and moonlight, the dark road is charming and charming with hundreds of flowers. &lt;br />;After playing chess, I don’t know how people have changed. When I’m in the wine market, I feel helpless and homesick. &lt;/div>;&lt;h3>;Translation and annotations&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Translation&lt;br />;&lt;/strong>;The night is as cool as water, the moon covers thousands of mountains, and the lonely sound of the flute drifts into the distance; on the road It was dark, and thousands of flowers were scattered all over the ground, confusing people&#39;s vision. &lt;br />;After playing a game of chess, I discovered that the world has changed, and I don’t know how many years have passed. I have exhausted my drinking to drown my sorrows, and I can’t relieve my deep homesickness. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Notes&lt;br />;&lt;/strong>; Qianshan: It is said that there are many mountains. Liu Zongyuan&#39;s poem &quot;Jiang Xue&quot; of the Tang Dynasty: &quot;Thousands of mountains and birds have disappeared, and thousands of people have disappeared.&quot;&lt;br />;The sentence &quot;Chess is over&quot;: the story of secretly using Wang Zhi. Liang Renfang of the Southern Dynasty said in &quot;Shu Yi Ji&quot;: During the Jin Dynasty, Wang Zhi went to the mountain to collect wood. When he saw two boys playing chess, he put his ax and watched. The boy gave Wang Zhi something like a date stone. He put it in his mouth and he didn&#39;t feel hungry. After the game of chess was over, the boy urged him to go back. Wang Zhi saw that his ax handle was also rotten. After returning home, all my relatives and friends have passed away and have long since changed their lives. &lt;br />;Jiu Lan: It means that the wine feast is about to end. &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;Creative background&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>; This poem describes what was seen in a dream and is contained in Volume 12 of &quot;Ji Shi Ji&quot;. The original annotations of the two poems before and after it are marked as 1049 AD. Year (the first year of Emperor Renzong of Song Dynasty), it may have been written at the same time. At that time, the author was demoted to Yingzhou for supporting the Qingli New Deal led by Fan Zhongyan. &lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;Appreciation&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;p>; This poem is about a dream. The dream is hazy, confusing and full of mystery. The theme is not easy to grasp. What the poet expresses here is a tortuous and complex feeling. , seems to imply the poet&#39;s ideological contradiction of wanting to be born in the extraordinary world but also being very nostalgic for the human world. The whole poem is one sentence at a time, each of which is independent, depicting four different artistic conceptions of autumn night, spring night, chess game, and wine court. It is like four single-axis paintings, but they are completely natural; Seamless. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first sentence describes the scenery of a quiet night. From the words &quot;cool&quot; and &quot;moon&quot;, we can tell that the time is around autumn. A bright moon illuminates the mountains near and far like daylight. The author plays the flute in the cool night and the silence. The surrounding environment seems particularly peaceful. The three words &quot;Moon over Thousand Mountains&quot; are already spacious, giving people a sense of exquisiteness and clarity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The second sentence depicts another realm. &quot;The road is dark&quot; indicates that the time is also at night, and &quot;hundred kinds of flowers&quot; are mentioned below, which means that the season at this time is changed to spring when hundreds of flowers are blooming. The road here is dark and the flowers are abundant. The scenery of the spring night is so confusing, just like the scene of writing poems in a dream. These two sentences have a hazy artistic conception and meaningful language, which set off the next two sentences. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The third sentence uses a legend to describe the changes in the world. Ren Fang of the Liang Dynasty said in &quot;Shu Yi Ji&quot;: During the Jin Dynasty, Wang Zhi went to the mountain to collect wood. When he saw two boys playing chess, he put his ax and watched. The boy gave Wang Zhi something like a date stone. He put it in his mouth and he didn&#39;t feel hungry. After the game of chess was over, the boy urged him to go back. Wang Zhi saw that his ax handle was also rotten. After returning home, all my relatives and friends have passed away and have long since changed their lives. This sentence reflects the author&#39;s transcendence from the world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The last sentence of the poem describes the mood of drinking, and homesickness arises spontaneously. It shows that although the poet wants to be detached, he cannot forget his feelings in the world, which is consistent with what Su Shi said in &quot;Shui Diao Ge Tou&quot; &quot;I want to ride on the wind.&quot; When I go back, I am afraid that the beautiful buildings and jade buildings will be too cold at high places.&quot; The mood is similar. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Although the four-line poem describes four different artistic conceptions, they form a harmonious unity, implying the poet&#39;s contradictory thoughts of wanting to transcend time and space while still lingering on the human world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;Poetry expresses ambition&quot;. By the end of the poem, the meaning gradually becomes clear. The poet&#39;s depression and trance were related to his political frustration at that time. When Ouyang Xiu wrote this poem, he was still in Yingzhou and had not yet been reused by the imperial court. So these four sentences express the emotions in my heart. The beauty of them is that they do not express these emotions directly. This kind of implicit technique requires careful observation to understand its true meaning. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Another characteristic of this poem is that the antitheses are ingenious and seamless, with the front and back couplets facing each other. This is influenced by Du Fu&#39;s poem &quot;Queju&quot;. &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;About the author&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;div>;&lt;center>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://song.gushiwen.cn/authorImg/ouyangxiu.jpg&quot; width=50 %>;&lt;/center>;&lt;/div>;Ouyang Xiu (August 6, 1007 - September 8, 1072), courtesy name Yongshu, nicknamed Zuiweng, late nicknamed Liuyi Jushi, was born in Yongfeng, Luling, Jizhou, Jiangnan West Road ( A native of Yongfeng County, Ji&#39;an City, Jiangxi Province today, he was born in Mianzhou (now Mianyang City, Sichuan Province) in the fourth year of Jingde (1007).
