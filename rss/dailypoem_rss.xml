I sigh that the rain is wet with dew, but I still think about the cypress trees. The wind is soft and the sun is beautiful, and I am ashamed to see the flying flowers. Wheat rice and paper money, chickens fighting for wine, and crows making noise in the forest. Tian smiled and said, This is not up to me, nor is it up to him. &lt;br />;The cinnabar is cooked in the cauldron. Make Zifu Qingdu one family. I think of my predecessors who often traveled to Jiangque and saw the cicadas sloughing off. How could I fall in love with the yellow sand? The emperor ordered the tombs to be guarded, the king ordered the tombs to be repaired, and the man was right and wrong. Why bother, stay at home and go to the tomb, where the books and brocade are prosperous. &lt;/div>;&lt;h3>;Translation and annotations&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Translation&lt;br />;&lt;/strong>;For the past fifteen years, every Cold Food Festival, I have been far away from home and wandering in the world. In rainy weather, I miss the cypress trees on the tomb; in sunny weather, I am ashamed to see flying flowers. During the Cold Food Festival, I cannot offer wheat rice, paper money, chickens, or wine to my ancestors, and the magpies and crows in the forest are waiting in vain! God smiled and said: This is not because of me, nor is it because of the invasion of the Yuan army. &lt;br />;I have already thought deeply about it and am as confident as the cinnabar in a cauldron. I am ready to ascend to heaven at any time and make the Zifu Qingdu Immortal World my home. I think of the past when immortals rode cranes and often traveled around the Jiangque in the sky. Our worldly bodies were discarded like cicadas shedding their shells. How can we linger on the dusty world? The emperor ordered his ministers to guard the tombs and repair the cemeteries. Men should serve the king in this way. Why wait until you return home to visit your grave, displaying your splendor just like returning home in fine clothes during the day! &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Notes&lt;br />;&lt;/strong>; Qinyuanchun: Ci brand name, also known as &quot;Dongxian&quot;, &quot;Shouxingming&quot;, &quot;Dongting Spring&quot;, etc. &lt;br />;Yunzhou: The name of the state in the Northern Song Dynasty. The city where it was governed was now Dongping, Shandong. The old name of the Northern Song Dynasty is used here to show that we do not forget our homeland. &lt;br />;Zaibai: The cypress tree on the tomb is also called Zaishu or Zaimu. &lt;br />;Feihua: Qiehan Food Festival. &lt;br />;Chickens fighting for wine: both refer to sacrifices. &lt;br />;Occasionally, the crows were noisy in the forest: After the sacrifices were swept, the crows and magpies in the forest could come to eat the sacrifices. Since they had not been able to sweep the sacrifices for many years, the crows and magpies were delayed. Several, many times. &lt;br />;Zifu Qingdu: Taoists call the place where immortals live Zifu; Qingdu refers to the official residence of the Emperor of Heaven. &lt;br />;Jiangque: refers to the Palace of Immortals. Su Shi&#39;s &quot;Shui Long Yin&quot;: &quot;In ancient times, the sea of ​​clouds was vast, and where was the Jiangque on Daoshan Mountain?&quot; &lt;br />;Huangsha: means the dusty world. &lt;br />;Playing house and going to the grave: Go back to your hometown and visit the grave. This is not a general term, but refers specifically to returning home to pay homage to the ancestors on the emperor&#39;s order and to show the emperor&#39;s favor. &lt;br />;Shu Jin: means returning home after wealth. &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;Creative background&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>; This poem was written by Xie Fangde when he visited Yunzhou. After the fall of the Song Dynasty, the Yuan Dynasty continued its southern expedition. During this period, the author lived in seclusion in central Fujian until the twenty-sixth year of the Yuan Dynasty (1289), when the rulers of the Yuan Dynasty forced the poet to go north. During the Cold Food Festival on the way, he wrote this poem. The poet arrived in Yanjing in April, but eventually went on a hunger strike and died at the age of sixty-four. &lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;Appreciation&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;p>; The first film mainly expresses the poet&#39;s homesickness. It has been fifteen years since I went home to celebrate the Cold Food Festival, which shows that the poet has been wandering away for a long time. &quot;They are all in Tianzhou&quot; is an exaggeration, which shows that the poet is deeply homesick. It also implies that the country was destroyed and the family was destroyed, and the people suffered from displacement. . Although the writer of the four lines &quot;Sighing on the Rain&quot; has left his hometown, he misses his family all the time. He has not returned home for fifteen years to sweep the tombs of his ancestors and pay homage to his ancestors. Even &quot;Zai Bai&quot; makes the poet miss him endlessly. But in the sunny season, the poet is ashamed to see &quot;flying flowers&quot;, and the reason for his shame is that he does not want to know. &quot;Flying flowers&quot; here refers to a place where warmth and prosperity are common. When the country is ruined and the family is destroyed, as a minister, he is unable to save the building. It’s about to fall, which is really shameful. The three lines of “Maifan” describe the happy crows in the forest who could have eaten the sacrificial things, but because I haven’t sacrificed them for many years, even they have to wait in vain. On the surface, the poet is pitying the crows , in fact, he is lamenting his own misfortune. In the last sentence, the poet euphemistically expresses his indignation towards the rulers of the Yuan Dynasty.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The next film changes from the sad and melancholy style of the first film to expressing heroic feelings. Beginning In these two sentences, the poet borrows Taoist theory to reveal that he has already seen through life and death and is willing to become a family with the gods and emperors. It shows that the poet sticks to his integrity and regards death as home. The four sentences &quot;thinking about what has been done before&quot; further illustrate that the poet does not love the poet. In this mortal world, one does not want to live an ignoble existence, and even longs to be like his predecessors, to fly around on a crane after liberation, and be free and at ease. &quot;The emperor ordered to guard the tomb, the king ordered to repair the tomb, this is what men should do.&quot; In the three lines, the poet once again made it clear that he was determined to die. Loyal to the Song Dynasty, one would rather die than surrender. It is precisely because of this idea that &quot;a loyal minister will not serve the two masters&quot;, so the poet finally said that although he was forced by the Yuan people to go north this time, he had made up his mind and they could not do anything about it. . Again emphasizing his firm belief.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; This poem was written from the Cold Food Festival. The poet first wrote about his homesickness, and then went from home to country, showing that he would never be a traitor who betrayed his trust and country. , even if you risk your life, you must preserve your integrity, thus sublimating the ideological realm of the whole poem and enhancing the artistic appeal of the poem.&lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;About the author&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;div>; &lt;center>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://song.gushiwen.cn/authorImg/xiefangde.jpg&quot; width=50%>;&lt;/center>;&lt;/div>;Xie Fangde (1226～1289): Jinshi of the Southern Song Dynasty, A native of Yiyang, Xinzhou, Jiangxi Province, his courtesy name was Junzhi, his nickname was Dieshan, and his alias was Yizhai.

The sunset on the beach has shadows like mountains. &lt;/div>;&lt;h3>;Translation and annotations&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Translation&lt;/strong>;&lt;br />;Imagine the time when this horse fell from the sky, and its extraordinary spirit made the emperor&#39;s horse look magical. dismal. &lt;br />;Today, I am standing on the beach. Under the setting sun, it looks like a thin and barren mountain. Who will take pity on it? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Notes&lt;/strong>;&lt;br />;The Thin Horse Picture: This is a self-inscribed poem on Gong Kai&#39;s painting &quot;The Horse Bone Picture&quot; (also known as the Thin Horse Picture). &lt;br />;Jiang Tianguan: It means that he has made military exploits. &lt;br />;Xian Dynasty: refers to the fall of Song Dynasty. &lt;br />;Twelve leisure: refers to the royal stables. Free, stable. &quot;Zhou Li·Xia Guan·School Ceremony&quot; says: &quot;The emperor has two leisures out of ten and six kinds of horses.&quot;&lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;Creative background&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>; This is a painting inscription The poem is a self-inscribed poem written by the author in &quot;The Picture of Horses and Bones&quot; (also known as the Picture of Slender Horses). It was written probably after the death of the Song Dynasty and is a work of the poet in his later years. This self-titled poem titled &quot;Seven Horse Pictures&quot; contains the deep meaning of the poet&#39;s sustenance. The poet once worked with Lu Xiufu in the Guangling shogunate and participated in the resistance against the Yuan Dynasty. After the death of the Song Dynasty, he lived in seclusion and did not serve as an official, selling paintings for a living, and finally died keeping his ambition. Let’s look at the thin horse in his painting. It is a rugged and mountain-shaped horse. It has become extremely thin, but it still maintains the majestic and mountain-like appearance of the &quot;Xian Dynasty&quot;. Why the horse of the past is so thin today may be because it would rather be a skinny horse than eat &quot;Yuan millet&quot;. The poems in &quot;The Picture of Horses and Bones&quot; are the artistic expression of this thought. &lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;Appreciation&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;p>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The first two sentences of this poem describe this magical horse falling from the sky, which is more powerful than the emperor&#39;s royal horse. The last two sentences It is written that this horse is standing on the beach on the shore today, and the setting sun casts its shadow on the ground, like a barren mountain. The actual description of the horse today is that although it is thin, it is still standing, firm as a mountain, which highlights the valuable spiritual temperament of this horse. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The poem begins with the word &quot;horse&quot;, &quot;as soon as the clouds and mist descended from the sky&quot;, the horse passed through the clouds and fell from the sky. In the Han Dynasty, Dawan, a domestically produced horse in the Western Regions, was known as the &quot;Tianma&quot;. This sentence describes the magic of the horse. It rises suddenly and has the momentum to break through the air, which increases the intensity of the beginning of the poem. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;The sky is empty and the first dynasty is twelve leisurely hours&quot;, connected to the previous sentence, means that the horse fell from the sky, and its extraordinary grace and grace eclipsed all the horses in the palace. &quot;Empty&quot; means to be washed away. The two sentences, starting and ending, describe the magical posture of the horse in the past. This is a magical horse. It rides on the clouds and rises into the mist, descending from the sky. There is no better horse in the world than the emperor&#39;s royal horse. Even all the royal horses are dwarfed by the thousand-mile horse. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The third and fourth sentences turn to &quot;today&quot; and describe the current situation of the horse, which forms a strong contrast with the first two sentences. Now, the horse is so skinny that no one cares about it anymore. The last line of the poem, &quot;The shadows on the beach at sunset are like mountains,&quot; is an image depiction of &quot;thin bones.&quot; The thin horse has no one to trust and stands alone on the beach in the sunset. The figure cast diagonally on the beach is as rugged as a mountain. The word &quot;mountain&quot; is used to describe the horse&#39;s thin appearance, which also has an implicit meaning: even if it is old, sick and sleepy, it still stands tall and tall, without changing its awe-inspiring and inviolable spirit. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The whole poem is dedicated to horses, describing horses in every sentence, which resembles the shape of a horse, and captures the spirit of the horse; it also sings about people, using horses to describe people&#39;s temperament, and people&#39;s ambitions, broadmindedness, and emotions can be seen everywhere. Encounter. The comparison between the past and present of Ma expresses the poet&#39;s deep emotion of not being able to appreciate his talent. Due to the changes of the times, people no longer favor it and pity it, leaving it skinny and skeletal. But it itself is neither inferior nor discouraged. It stands alone on the beach where the setting sun shines, its memory is like a mountain, and its majestic wind is still as strong as before. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; There is pride in the poem, and although it is a tragic song, it is also generous. Gong Kai&#39;s poem &quot;Skinny Horse&quot; actually reflects the poet&#39;s own image. The &quot;Skinny Horse&quot;&#39;s extraordinary talents, majestic bones and unshakable integrity are all very similar to Gong Kai&#39;s life experience and spirit. tolerance. &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;About the author&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;A native of Huaiyin in the Song Dynasty, his courtesy name was Shengyu, his nickname was Cuiyan, and his nickname was Guicheng Sou. He lived with Lu Xiufu in the Guangling shogunate. Lizong Jingding appointed supervisory officials for the Lianghuai system. After the death of Song Dynasty, there was no official position.
