Even spring walks in a hurry before me. &lt;br />;In the morning and evening in Lingnan, you can only stay with the apes and monkeys, or bear the wind and smoke with the willows by the river. &lt;br />;I have suffered the same fate as Jia Yi, who was demoted to Changsha Taifu. I wonder how many years will it take before he can return home? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Notes&lt;br />;&lt;/strong>; Tianbian: Tianbian refers to Panzhou Nanba, which is now Maoming, Guangdong. &lt;br />;游(shān) Ran: the look of crying. &lt;br />;Below others: Refers to officials, who are below others. &lt;br />;Ke: The poet refers to himself. &lt;br />;Ling: refers to five ridges. The author was demoted to Nanba in Panzhou and passed this ridge. &lt;br />;Changsha Fu: refers to Jia Yi. He was once slandered and demoted to the position of Prince Taifu of Changsha. Here he uses it as a metaphor for himself. &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;Creative background&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>; This poem is a New Year&#39;s song written by the author after he was demoted to Nanba Lieutenant. In the spring of 758 AD (the third year of Emperor Suzong&#39;s reign in Tang Dynasty), the author was demoted from Suzhou Captain to Nanba Lieutenant in Panzhou (now Maoming City, Guangdong Province). This poem was written the year after moving to Panzhou, that is, the second year of Qianyuan (759). &lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;Appreciation&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;p>; In the Tang Dynasty, the area south of Changsha was very desolate. The hardships in Panzhou can be imagined. The poet was wronged and demoted. The beautiful Suzhou in Jiangnan was moved to the remote Panzhou, and the grievances are self-evident. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;My hometown is full of nostalgia for the new year, and the sky is alone with my tears.&quot; These two sentences mean that the New Year is here, and I am thousands of miles away from my relatives, so my homesickness is naturally even more intense. &quot;Hometown&quot; refers to the feeling of homesickness; &quot;New Year&quot; refers to the New Year. During the festive season, the poet&#39;s homesickness becomes more urgent and uncontrollable when he misses his relatives more than ever. &quot;Tianpan&quot; refers to the horizon, here refers to Lingnan; &quot;moaning&quot; refers to the appearance of tears; being alone in a foreign land and on the New Year, how can a poet who is homesick not feel sad and shed tears? The words &quot;cut&quot; and &quot;lone&quot; at the beginning set the emotional tone of loneliness and sorrow in the whole poem. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;When you grow old, you live under others, and when you return in spring, you come first&quot; is derived from Xue Daoheng&#39;s &quot;When people return after the wild geese, their thoughts are in front of the flowers&quot;. It is integrated into the simple homesickness of the predecessors and is integrated into the officialdom. The sense of life experience expands the capacity and enhances the thickness of emotion. &quot;Old&quot; and &quot;living under others&quot; are the poet&#39;s self-expression; the word &quot;to&quot; is full of the bitterness of losing time in old age and the grief and indignation of frustrated career: he was upright and upright, but he ended up being framed and living under someone else&#39;s roof! The sad feeling is even more painful when expressed plainly; &quot;guest&quot; refers to the poet himself; &quot;spring returns&quot; means spring returns to the earth and hometown, which is personified; the word &quot;Xian&quot; expresses envy: if only I could be like spring Same, it would be great to return to my hometown early! There are even more complaints: I am still wandering at the end of the world, why does spring return first? Frustrated in old age, spring has returned to oneself, which is the reason for the poet&#39;s &quot;randomness&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The two sentences &quot;Apes in the mountains share the same day and night, rivers and willows share the wind and smoke&quot; describe the scenery of the barren mountains and rivers on the horizon. The cry of apes accumulates sad poetic images. &quot;Ling Yuan&quot; refers to the apes in the mountains of Lingnan; &quot;Dan Du&quot; refers to morning to evening; &quot;Wind Smoke&quot; refers to the morning breeze and evening mist; the words &quot;Tong&quot; and &quot;Gong&quot; describe the poet&#39;s loneliness and confusion. Yi&#39;s miserable state: exiled in a foreign land, can only associate with heartless animals, can only associate with indifferent plants, the apes in the mountains mourn, the rivers and willows are confused, even if they have all kinds of worries, where can they talk about it? The misery he encountered and the confusion of his uncertain future are all in the scene. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;Already like a master in Changsha, how many years will it take from now?&quot; Here I borrow an allusion from Jia Yi. Jia Yi, a talented man from Luoyang, had the ambition to help the world and the country. For Changsha Taifu. When the poet was demoted this time, it was because of his fault that he had failed. He was depressed and lamented, and sometimes expressed: &quot;The earth is far away and the Mingjun abandons it, and the sky is high and the cruel officials bully him&quot; (&quot;First Demotion from Nanba to Poyang, Inscribed on Li Jiayou Jiangting&quot;), so Jia Yi is quoted as the same tune. , and there is a feeling of &quot;similarity&quot; of &quot;the same people who have fallen into the world&quot;. However, since he disobeys the powerful family and worries that he will never be able to return, he will inevitably have the worry of &quot;how many years from now on&quot;. At this point, the poet craned his neck to look at Chang&#39;an in the distance, his heart returning, and his lingering back seemed to be right in front of him; he seemed to be able to hear deep sighs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Any poem that describes a scene and expresses emotions is always very particular about the choice of words. Either one sentence describes the scenery and one sentence expresses emotion, or one sentence describes both scenery and emotion, or the first couplet describes the scenery and the last couplet describes the emotion. This poem has more sad elements, so it has more lyrical sentences. The first two lines are about feelings, the third lines are about sceneries, the fourth lines are about scenes and feelings, the fifth and sixth lines are about feelings arising from the scene, and the seventh and eighth lines are about lyrical feelings. Among them, &quot;New Year&quot; refers to scenery, and &quot;Several Years&quot; refers to love. The infinite sorrow of separation is vividly reflected on the paper. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The emotion of the poem is profound and sorrowful, the couplets are full of emotions, and there are sighs from beginning to end. Only the neck couplet describes the scene, which is light and dense but not brilliant, and the mood is pathos. The whole poem has a deep structure, with the style of &quot;the threads are lingering and continuous, the taste is connoted and the purpose is strengthened by chanting&quot; (Lu Wenzhao&#39;s words). In terms of his character, he belongs to the Dali family, showing signs of sudden decline. &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;About the author&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;div>;&lt;center>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://song.gushiwen.cn/authorImg/liuchangqing.jpg&quot; width=50 %>;&lt;/center>;&lt;/div>;Liu Changqing (zhǎng) (709-789), courtesy name Wenfang, Han nationality, from Xuancheng (now Anhui), was a poet of the Tang Dynasty. Later he moved to Luoyang, where he became the county commander in Hejian (now part of Hebei Province). He was a Jinshi during the Tianbao reign of Emperor Xuanzong of the Tang Dynasty. Su Zong served as the imperial censor in De Zhongguan, the county lieutenant of Changzhou County in Suzhou, and the transfer envoy judge in Daizong Dali Zhongzhong. After knowing that he was transferred to Huaixi and Eyue, he was falsely accused and demoted to Sima Muzhou again. He was relegated twice because of his stubbornness. During the Jianzhong period of Dezong, he was appointed governor of Suizhou and was known as Liusuizhou in the world. &lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https:/ /feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br >;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 26 Oct 2023 06:23:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[后赤壁赋 | 苏轼]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://feedx.net/read?r=shiwen&d=2310262]]><description> &lt;h2>;Hou Chibi Ode&lt;/h2>;[Song Dynasty] Su Shi&lt;div style=&quot;color: #5b4636;&quot;>;&lt;p>; It is the tenth month of the year, and I will return to Lingao after walking from the Xuetang. The two guests followed me across the yellow mud slope. When the frost and dew fell, all the leaves fell off the trees, and the figures were on the ground, looking up at the bright moon, looking at it with joy, and singing songs in response to each other. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>; He sighed and said: &quot;There are guests but no wine, there is wine but no food, the moon is white and the wind is clear, what a good night it is!&quot; The guest said: &quot;It is dusk today, and I catch fish with a net, with a big mouth and thin scales, like Like the perch in the Songjiang River. Did Gu An get the wine?&quot; He returned to seek help from his wives. The woman said, &quot;I have a bucket of wine, which I have kept for a long time, just in case my son needs it from time to time.&quot; So she took the wine and the fish and swam under the Red Cliff again. The river flows with sound, and the bank is broken for thousands of feet; the mountains are high and the moon is small, and the water falls and rocks come out. The sun and the moon were as old as before, but the mountains and rivers cannot be recognised. I took my clothes and climbed up, walking on the rocky rocks, covered with velvet, perched on tigers and leopards, climbed on horned dragons, climbed on the dangerous nests of falcons, and looked down on Feng Yi&#39;s secluded palace. Gai Ergu can&#39;t follow him. Suddenly there was a long roar, the grass and trees shook, the mountains rumbled and the valleys responded, the wind blew and the water surged. I am also quiet and sad, solemn and frightened, so awe-inspiring that I can&#39;t stay. Instead, he boarded the boat, let it go into the middle of the current, and waited until it stopped. It was almost midnight, and everything was lonely. There is a lone crane coming across the river from the east. The wings are like wheels, and the silk clothes are black and white. They scream loudly and sweep towards the boat heading west. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;After a while, the guest left, and I fell asleep. I dreamed that a Taoist priest in fluttering feathers was passing under Lingao. He bowed to me and said, &quot;Are you having fun at Red Cliff?&quot; When asked his name, he bowed his head and did not answer. &quot;Woohoo! Hehe! I know it. Those who flew past me at night in the past are not my sons, are they evil?&quot; The Taoist priest smiled, but I was also shocked. Open an account and look at it, but you can&#39;t see it. &lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;h3>;Translation and annotations&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Translation&lt;br />;&lt;/strong>; On October 15th of this year, I set out from Xuetang , preparing to return to Lingaoting. Two guests followed me and walked through Huangni Ban. By this time the frost and dew had fallen, and all the leaves had fallen off. Our figures were reflected on the ground, and we looked up to see the bright moon hanging high in the sky. Looking around, I felt very happy, so I recited poems while walking and responded to each other. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; After a while, I sighed and said: &quot;There are guests but no wine, and even if there is wine, there are no dishes. The moon is bright and the breeze is blowing. How can we spend such a beautiful night?&quot; A guest said: &quot;This evening, I cast a net and caught a fish. It has a big mouth and fine scales, and its shape is like the bass from Wusong River. But where can I get wine?&quot; I went home to discuss with my wife, and she said: &quot;I have a bucket of wine that I have kept for a long time to meet your sudden needs.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In this way, we took the wine and fish and visited the bottom of Red Cliff again. The flowing water of the Yangtze River makes a sound, and the steep river banks stand tall and straight; the mountains are very high, the moon looks smaller, the water level drops, and the rocks are exposed. It’s only been a few days, but the river scenery and mountains I saw during my last trip are no longer recognizable! I lifted up my clothes and went ashore, stepping on the steep rocks and pushing aside the tangled weeds. I squatted on the strange rocks shaped like tigers and leopards, and from time to time I pulled on the branches shaped like horned dragons. I climbed up the cliff where the raptors nested, and looked down at the water god. Feng Yi&#39;s deep palace. Neither guest could follow me to this extreme height. I roared loudly, the grass and trees were shaken, the mountains resonated with me, the deep valleys echoed, the wind blew, and the waves surged. I also felt sad and sad, and I felt scared and held my breath silently. I felt that this place was scary and I couldn&#39;t stay for a long time. Go back to the boat, row it to the center of the river, let it drift wherever it goes, and anchor there. It was almost midnight, and when I looked around, I felt very deserted and lonely. There happened to be a crane flying across the river from the east. Its wings were as big as a wheel, the black feathers on its tail were like a black skirt, and the white feathers on its body were like white clothes. It screamed in a long and loud voice, and passed by our boat. Fly west. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After a while, the guests left and I went home to sleep. I dreamed that a Taoist priest, wearing clothes woven from feathers, walked briskly, passed under the Lingao Pavilion, bowed to me and said, &quot;Did you enjoy your visit to Red Cliff?&quot; I asked his name, but he lowered his head and did not answer. . &quot;Oh! Oops! I know your details. Last night, the person who passed me while flying and shouting, wasn&#39;t you?&quot; The Taoist priest turned around and laughed, and I suddenly woke up. When I opened the door, I couldn&#39;t see where he was. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Notes&lt;/strong>;&lt;br />;Walking from Xuetang: Starting from Xuetang on foot.

These words are related to the previous visit to Red Cliff. The last time I visited Red Cliff was in &quot;July&quot;, it was only three months since this time, so the time was very short, so it was said that &quot;the sun and the moon were as old as the sun&quot;. What we saw last time was &quot;the light of water touches the sky&quot; and &quot;the vast expanse is vast&quot;, but what we saw this time is &quot;the broken bank is thousands of feet&quot; and &quot;the water falls and the rocks are revealed&quot;, so it is said that &quot;the country and the mountains cannot be recognised&quot;.

In the first paragraph of this article, the author responds to the guest&#39;s song on a bright moonlit night. First there were the regrets of &quot;having guests but no wine&quot; and &quot;having wine but no food&quot;, and then there was the joy of &quot;taking wine and fish&quot; for swimming. The writing is gentle and stretched, with twists and turns. The second paragraph starts from the night view of the river bank where &quot;the river flows with sound, and the bank is cut off thousands of feet&quot;, to the dangerous situation of the cliff where &quot;we walk on the craggy rocks, covered with hair...&quot;; from the sigh that &quot;the sun and the moon were so geometric, but the river water cannot be recognised&quot; , the mood changes from &quot;quiet but sad, solemn and frightened&quot;, extremely ups and downs. The third paragraph uses the dreamlike state of Taoist Guhe to express his open-minded mind and the thought of admiring immortals. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;Chibi Fu&quot; is divided into two parts, the front and back, which are perfectly integrated into one. The article uses the same place (Red Cliff), the same way (boating and drinking on a moonlit night), and the same subject (the clear breeze and bright moon in the mountains and rivers) to reflect different seasons, depict different natural scenery, express different tastes, and express Different themes. Every word is like a painting, every sentence is like a poem, the poems and paintings are integrated, and the scenes are blended together. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;Later Chibi Fu&quot; is the sequel to &quot;Former Chibi Fu&quot;, which can also be said to be a sister volume. The first Fu mainly talks about mysteries and reasoning, while the second Fu mainly focuses on narrative description of scenes; the first Fu describes the night scene on the river in early autumn, while the second Fu mainly describes the activities on the river bank, and the time also moves to Meng Dong; both articles start with &quot; &quot;Fu&quot; is a style of travel prose. The scenery of Red Cliff is the same, but the realm is different. However, they are all poetic and picturesque. The first poem is &quot;The breeze blows slowly, the water waves are calm&quot;, &quot;The white dew flows across the river, the water light touches the sky&quot;, and the second poem is &quot;The river flows with sound, the broken bank is thousands of feet, the mountain is high and the moon is small, and the water falls and rocks appear&quot;. The landscape characteristics of different seasons are vividly and realistically reflected in Su Shi&#39;s works, giving people the enjoyment of magnificent and natural beauty. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The full text is divided into three levels. The first level describes the activities before the trip, including explaining the time, itinerary, companions and preparations for the trip. Writing about the scene of the moonlit night in early winter and the joy of walking on the moon not only conceals the interest of travel, but also naturally leads to the dialogue between the host and the guest. Facing &quot;such a good night&quot; with &quot;white moon and clear wind&quot;, good friends, delicious food and fine wine, it was inevitable to visit Red Cliff again. In a few lines, I wrote about the scenery and narrated it. Things, and emotions, the three are integrated into one, and now it can be transferred to the main text, but Dongpo inserted a few lines of &quot;returning to seek wives&quot; as an &quot;extra&quot;, which not only added life to the article breath, and makes the whole &quot;foreshadowing&quot; text even more unique. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The second level is the focus of the whole text. There are only four sentences that purely describe the scenery, &quot;The river flows with sound&quot;, but it describes the steep cliffs of Red Cliff, the high mountains, the clear sky, the small moon, the slow splashing water and the rocks. The unique night scene in early winter with sound arouses the enthusiasm of the host and guest to abandon their boats and climb ashore to climb the cliffs and visit the mountains. Here, the author spares no effort in describing the artistic conception of the night tour in Chibi, which is quiet and quiet, the mountains and rivers are cold, &quot;walking on the rocky rocks, covered with mist&quot; The velvet, the tiger and the leopard, the horned dragon; the perilous nest of the Western Magpie, and the secluded palace of Fengyi.&quot; The strange and thrilling scenery makes people open-minded and lofty. However, when Su Shi was alone on the verge of death, the scene of &quot;a sudden roar, the vegetation shook, the mountains rang and the valley echoed, the wind and the water surged&quot; could not but make him feel desolate and worried, and had to Return to the boat. At this point in the article, another stroke of inspiration suddenly occurred, and he wrote about a lone crane &quot;coming across the river to the east&quot; and &quot;making a sudden cry&quot; before sailing away to the west. As a result, the already lonely author became even more compassionate, and the article started again. The ups and downs also paved the way for the following dreams. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Finally, at the third level of the text, Su Zi, who fell asleep after traveling, saw the Taoist priest who had turned into a lonely crane in his dream. The mysterious hallucinations of &quot;Gu Xiao&quot; and &quot;Gu Xiao&quot; reveal the author&#39;s inner anguish caused by the contradictory thoughts of being out of the world. Su Shi, who was repeatedly frustrated in politics, wanted to seek detachment from the joy of mountains and rivers, but it was not only in vain, but also added new sorrow to the deep wounds in his soul. After a dream, he returned to the depressing reality. The last eight words &quot;Open an account and look at it, but you can&#39;t see where it is&quot; is quite confusing, but it also has a pun meaning. On the surface, it seems like the Taoist priest in a dream has suddenly disappeared, but the deeper connotation is &quot;Su Zi&#39;s future and ideals&quot; Where are the pursuits and ambitions?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The scene of Su Zi climbing alone in the article is really &quot;every sentence is picturesque and every word is like poetry&quot;. Through exaggeration and exaggeration, it makes people feel like they are there. The feeling of its environment. The article describes the beautiful scenery of mountains and rivers with bright colors and the author&#39;s sincere personal feelings. The clever use of parallelism and contrast adds to the musicality of the text. It makes reading more interesting. But in general, the latter Fu is inferior to the former Fu both ideologically and artistically. Mysterious color, depressive mood, lighter &quot;fu&quot; flavor and slightly stronger &quot;literary&quot; flavor are probably the main reasons why it is inferior to the previous one. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;Hou Chibi Ode&quot; was written when Su Shi was demoted to Huangzhou due to the &quot;Wutai Poetry Case&quot;. His relegation career gave Su Shi a deeper understanding of society and life, and also made his life more profound. The creation expresses the inner emotional waves more deeply. &quot;Hou Chibi Fu&quot; follows the traditional pattern of question and answer between the subject and the guest, suppressing the guest and expressing the subject. It expresses his own philosophy of life and also describes the beautiful scenery of the Yangtze River on a moonlit night. The whole text uses both parallel and prose, with both scenes and scenes, making it a beautiful prose poem. Not only does it make us feel the author&#39;s superb expression ability and language skills, but the image of the lonely crane in the article also makes us feel the transcendent philosophy of life. The solitary, lonely, noble, elegant and otherworldly lone crane has always been a Taoist god. Riding a crane is a symbol of Taoism and immortality. Su Shi not only used the crane to express his noble, elegant, otherworldly and free state of mind, but also expressed the painful spirit of leaving the world beyond reality. Then let&#39;s take a look at how he vividly displays Guhe&#39;s loneliness, loneliness, nobility, elegance, and otherworldliness in &quot;Hou Chibi Fu&quot;. The mountains and rocks are tall and weird, which not only represent the natural force that opposes and oppresses him, but also symbolizes his lingering depression. The crane is the image of this depressed and lonely emotion. The lonely crane resting on the pines and cypresses, not making any plans for rice and grain, was in Su Shi&#39;s mind, just like in the minds of other hermits, a symbol of being high in the world. Su Shi once wrote &quot;The Pavilion of Flying Cranes&quot;, which used flying cranes to attract cranes and coexistence with cranes to exaggerate the inner feeling of abandoning the world. The image of the lonely crane was particularly dear to him. At this time, when Su Shi felt most lonely, suddenly a lone crane from the east fluttered its wings across the river and passed the small boat to the west. This crane flying alone in the dark night and singing alone is lonely. It can borrow the heart of Su Zi who is in the same state of feeling. Therefore, Su Zi, who had never spoken to the guest, paid great attention to it. And it is not only a symbol of Su Zi&#39;s feelings at this time, but also a new image of the Taoist priest on July Night. Su Shi used the realization that &quot;anyone who flew past me in the past night was not a son&quot;, and associated it with the Taoist priest who came to dream, indicating that the author placed his nostalgia for his old friend on this lonely crane. The thoughts of Taoist priests were originally an aspect of Su Zi&#39;s thoughts. The connection between Su Zi - Guhe - Taoist priests implies that Su Shi has spiritually turned to a recluse who lives high in the world. &quot;Open an account and look, but you can&#39;t see where it is.&quot; At the end, he said that after waking up from a dream, he opened the door to look for it. It was a vast night, but he could not see the lone crane and there was no Taoist priest. A pun with a profound aftertaste. Mixing depression and hope in a poetic realm. The shapes of mountains and cranes correspond to Su Shi&#39;s mental discomfort due to changes in nature and ignorance of human affairs, and his longing for freedom in loneliness. Throughout the entire text, a beautiful picture of &quot;the Zen state of water and moon, and the distant sound of cranes and mountains&quot; naturally unfolds before our eyes! &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;Creative background&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;p>; &quot;Red Cliff Ode&quot; was written during one of the most difficult periods in Su Shi&#39;s life - when he was demoted to Huangzhou. In the fifth year of Yuanfeng (1082), Su Shi traveled to Red Cliff twice, on July 16 and October 15, and wrote two poems with the theme of Red Cliff. Later generations called the first one &quot;Previous Red Cliff&quot;. &quot;Ode&quot;, the second part is &quot;Ode to Hou Chibi&quot;. &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;About the author&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;div>;&lt;center>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://song.gushiwen.cn/authorImg/sushi.jpg&quot; width=50 %>;&lt;/center>;&lt;/div>;Su Shi, (January 8, 1037 - August 24, 1101), also known as Zizhan and Hezhong, also known as Tieguan Taoist and Dongpo layman, known as Su Dongpo and Su Xian in the world.
