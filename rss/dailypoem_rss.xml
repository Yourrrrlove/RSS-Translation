When it rains, the plain clothes are undressed, and the pure clothes are reversed. The dog didn&#39;t know it and barked at him. Yang Bu was angry and would pounce on him. Yang Zhu said: &quot;You don&#39;t pounce, and you are still like this. Is it not strange that Xiang made your dog white and then came to the black?&quot; &lt;/div>;&lt;h3>;Translation and annotation&lt;/h3>;&lt;p >;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Translation&lt;/strong>;&lt;br />; Yang Zhu’s younger brother was named Yang Bu. He went out wearing white clothes. It started to rain, so Yang Bu took off his white clothes and went home in black clothes. His dog didn&#39;t recognize Yang Bu, so he barked at him. Yang Bu was very angry and prepared to beat the dog. At this time Yang Zhu said: &quot;Don&#39;t beat the dog. If it were you, you would do the same thing. If your dog was white before leaving and turned black when it came back, how could you not Are you surprised?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Notes&lt;/strong>;&lt;br />;Yang Zhu: a pre-Qin philosopher, a native of Wei during the Warring States Period, with the courtesy name Ziju. &lt;br />;Said: Name. &lt;br />;Clothes: to wear. &lt;br />;Plain: white. &lt;br />;Rain: Rain. &lt;br />;Yi: Top, here refers to clothes. &lt;br />;缁(zī): black. &lt;br />;Reverse: Same as &quot;hui&quot;, return, go home. &lt;br />;Zhi: Understand, know. &lt;br />;And: conjunction, indicating compliance. &lt;br />;Bark: (dog) barks. &lt;br />;Nu: angry, angry. &lt;br />;Will: plan. &lt;br />;Put: hit, knock. &lt;br />;Zi Wu pounces on it, Zi: You&lt;br />;Yue: Like this. &lt;br />;Xiang: Just now. Toward, in the past, in the past. &lt;br />;If: if, if. &lt;br />;Qi: How? &lt;br />;None: Same as &quot;Wu&quot;, no, don&#39;t. &lt;br />;Strange: Feeling strange about.... &lt;br />;Yi Suyi: wearing white clothes. &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;Implication&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;1. When a friend misunderstands you, don’t get hot-headed or get angry; instead, you should put yourself in other people’s shoes and learn to empathize. , and understand others. &lt;br />;2. It is wrong to see the surface of things without seeing the essence of things with a short-term vision. &lt;br />;3. Things are ever-changing. If you want to understand things correctly, you cannot look at things with an unchanging perspective, let alone be confused by temporary superficial phenomena. You must grasp the essence of things. &lt;br />;4. Whenever you encounter right or wrong, you must first look within yourself and don’t be too busy blaming others! &lt;br />;5. When encountering other people’s unfriendly behavior, you should put yourself in their shoes and ask yourself instead of blaming others blindly. &lt;br />;6. If you change, you can&#39;t blame others for treating you differently. If others look at you differently, you must first find the reason from yourself. Otherwise, you will be like Yang Bu: his clothes have changed, but the dog doesn&#39;t recognize him. &lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;Comments&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;p>; Yang Bu was wearing white clothes when he went out. It rained and the environmental conditions changed. He changed into black clothes. Yang Bu was still Yang. cloth. But his dog ignored these changes and barked at Yang Bu who had changed his clothes. It turned out that the dog was only loyal to Yang Bu in white clothes, but ignored Yang Bu in black clothes! Yang Bu&#39;s dog only looked at the clothes but not the person, and ended up biting the wrong person. It’s not funny for dogs to make such mistakes. When people look at problems, if they only pay attention to superficial phenomena and fail to grasp the essential characteristics, they will also make similar low-level mistakes. In real life, nothing remains unchanged. Change is relative and change is absolute. You cannot look at changed things with the old eyes. You must learn to see the essence through phenomena. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Center: When others misunderstand us because of superficial phenomena, we must be sober, explain the truth, and eliminate misunderstandings. But you can&#39;t get angry like Yang Bu did, which is not conducive to solving the problem and may intensify the conflict. &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;Story&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;p>; Once upon a time, in a little-known mountain village, there lived a family named Yang, who lived by planting a piece of mountain land next to the village. . This family has two sons, the eldest son is named Yang Zhu, and the younger son is named Yang Bu. The two brothers help their parents cultivate land and carry water at home, while reading poetry and books diligently. Both brothers were good calligraphers and made a lot of poetry friends. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One day, his younger brother Yang Bu, wearing white and clean clothes, went out to visit friends happily. On the way to his friend&#39;s house, unexpectedly, it suddenly began to rain. The rain became heavier and heavier. Yang Bu was walking on a mountain trail with no village in front and no store behind him. He had no choice but to brave the heavy rain and was caught by the heavy rain. I was so drenched that I ran to my friend&#39;s house. They were good friends who often discussed poetry and reviewed calligraphy and painting together. Yang Bu took off his white coat that was soaked by the rain at his friend&#39;s house and put on his friend&#39;s black coat. A friend&#39;s house hosted Yang Bu for dinner, and the two talked about poetry for a while and commented on the calligraphy and paintings of their predecessors. The more they talked, the more they talked, and the more they played, the happier they were. Unconsciously, it was getting dark, so Yang Bu hung his white coat, which was soaked by the rain, at his friend&#39;s house to dry, and he wore his friend&#39;s black clothes and said goodbye to his friend and went home. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Although the mountain trail is wet after the rain, there is no accumulated mud because there are many pebbles on the road. The sky gradually darkened, but the winding mountain road was still clearly distinguishable. The evening breeze blew gently, bringing bursts of fragrance of new branches and leaves from the mountains. If it weren&#39;t for the fact that it was getting darker and darker, Yang Bu would really be in the mood of roaming the hills after the rain! He walked, walked, and reached the door of his house, still immersed in the interest of talking with friends during the day. At this time, Yang Bu&#39;s dog didn&#39;t know that its owner was back, and rushed out from the dark ground and barked at him. After a moment, the dog suddenly stood up on its hind legs and raised its front legs, as if it was about to pounce towards Yang Bu. Yang Bu was startled by his dog&#39;s sudden barking and its imminent pounce. He was very annoyed. He immediately stopped and ducked to the side, angrily yelling at the dog: &quot;You&#39;re blind!&quot; You don’t even recognize me!” So ​​he picked up a wooden stick by the door and wanted to beat the dog. At this time, his brother Yang Zhu heard the sound and immediately came out of the house. While stopping Yang Bu from beating the dog with a wooden stick, he called the barking dog and said, &quot;Don&#39;t beat it! You should think about it.&quot; , you went out in white clothes during the day, and came home so late in black clothes. If it were you, would you be able to tell clearly at once? Can you blame the dog?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Yang Bu said nothing more and thought calmly for a while, feeling that what his brother Yang Zhu said made sense. The dog stopped barking, and the family returned to its original happiness. &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;About the author&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;div>;&lt;center>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://song.gushiwen.cn/authorImg/lieyukou.jpg&quot; width=50 %>;&lt;/center>;&lt;/div>;Liezi (about 450 BC - 375 BC during the Warring States Period, died at the age of 75), a representative figure of Taoism in the early Warring States Period.
