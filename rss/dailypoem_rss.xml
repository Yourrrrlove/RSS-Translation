Heartbroken, boundless smoke and water, endless mountain scenery. &lt;br />;As we get closer to the Qianlong Festival, our eyes are filled with tears and blood. The sky is crying with blood, outside the sound of Zigui, the dawn wind is waning and the moon is waning. &lt;/div>;&lt;h3>;Translation and annotations&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Translation&lt;br />;&lt;/strong>;In late spring, when the fragrance is falling, I climb high and look at my motherland in the distance, feeling sad and aching in my heart. The blurred smoke and hazy mountain scenery made me even more heartbroken. &lt;br />;What is even more unbearable is that the Qianlong Festival is coming soon. Looking back on the past, tears run down from my eyes, crying out blood like a cuckoo bird. Beyond the mournful sounds of the regulations, there are the ruined rivers and mountains of the motherland. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Notes&lt;br />;&lt;/strong>;Qin Louyue: also known as Yi Qin&#39;e. Double tone, forty-six characters. The first paragraph has five sentences, three oblique rhymes, one repeated sentence, and twenty-one characters. The second paragraph has five sentences, three oblique rhymes, one repeated sentence, and twenty-five words. &lt;br />;Fangfeixie (xiē): refers to the scene of the dying flowers in spring. Xin Qiji&#39;s &quot;Congratulations to the Bridegroom: Farewell to the Twelfth Brother of Maojia&quot;: &quot;I can&#39;t find a place to cry when I return in spring, and I hate my beauty and have a rest.&quot;&lt;br />;Hometown: This refers to the occupied land. &lt;br />;Looking ahead: Looking ahead. &lt;br />;Kān: What’s more. &lt;br />;Qianlong Festival: April 13th is the birthday of Emperor Qinzong Zhao Huan of the Song Dynasty, so it is named Qianlong Festival. &lt;br />;Cry (tí) for blood: Chen Zangqi&#39;s &quot;Supplementary Materials on Materia Medica&quot; states that the cuckoo &quot;crows until the blood comes out&quot;. This refers to the poet&#39;s extreme grief. &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;Appreciation&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;p>; In the &quot;Jingkang Incident&quot; in 1127 AD, the two emperors Hui and Qin were kidnapped by the Jin people and went north, and the Central Plains was lost. In this current situation, all the people with lofty ideals in both the government and the public drew their swords to cut the ground and gnashed their teeth. As a result, a number of works were produced in the world of poetry that are generous and sad after reading, and whose generous and upright spirit can still be seen hundreds of years later. Xiang Ziyi&#39;s poem &quot;Moon in the Qin Lou&quot; has the same theme. Although it is short in length, its emotional capacity is not small. In addition, the performance of this poem also has its own characteristics. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The structure of the whole poem is divided into upper and lower columns, and the meaning of the words can be divided into three levels. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The three characters &quot;Fangfeixie&quot; at the beginning describe the scene of the disappearing spring, which seems real but virtual. Because the poet is not reciting the preface and expressing the general feelings of sadness about spring and farewell, I will not describe the scenery below. In this late spring and early summer season, what is lingering in the heart of the poet? It is &quot;the hometown is broken and the heart is broken&quot;. The &quot;hometown&quot; in this sentence can be interpreted as hometown, but Xiang Ziyi&#39;s home in Linjiang, Jiangxi Province did not fall into the hands of the Jin people. This obviously refers to the lost land. The poet climbed high and looked at his homeland in the north, but the homeland was invisible. For a poet who was crossing to the south with a patriotic feeling, how could he not feel sad and painful? This sentence is a direct expression of the poet&#39;s inner feelings. But if you let your emotions drive you and write along this line of thinking, you will be in trouble. The lyrics are chanting, but it is best to refer to specific things. At this point, the poet&#39;s pen moves from straight to curved, about to vomit and then stop. Instead of expressing emotion, he writes about the scenery: &quot;Boundless smoke and water, endless mountain scenery.&quot; What the poet sees in his eyes is only blurred smoke and water, and hazy mountains. color. This scene not only enriches and expands the meaning of &quot;My hometown is broken&quot;, but also visualizes the psychological activity of &quot;sadness&quot;; at the same time, the boundless natural landscape appropriately conveys the poet&#39;s emotions at this time and place. Distant melancholy. Therefore, after reading this, the reader can hardly tell whether the poet is describing scenery or expressing emotions. Scenery and emotion are combined, emotion is born from scenery, scenes blend together, &quot;sadness and joy are also revealed in things&quot; (Wang Fu&#39;s words), which is the beauty of &quot;boundless smoke and water, endless mountain scenery&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The word &quot;Kekan&quot; in Xiayu means unbearable. This is the poet&#39;s deliberate effort. It is these two words that deepen the feeling of &quot;the hometown is broken and heartbroken&quot;. Why does the poet miss his motherland in late spring and early summer? Because it is &quot;closer to Qianlong Festival&quot;. &quot;Yi Qian&quot;: &quot;Nine Five, Feilong Tian.&quot; The Qian hexagram uses dragon as its image, so the ancients used &quot;Qianlong&quot; to describe the emperor. Qianlong Festival is the birthday of Zhao Heng, Qinzong of the Northern Song Dynasty. According to the &quot;History of the Song Dynasty·Book of Rites&quot;: &quot;On April 13th of the first year of Jingkang, Grand Prime Minister Xu Churen and others invited him to celebrate the Qianlong Festival.&quot; From the records, we can imagine that on this day, the ministers in the court congratulated the emperor on his birthday, and Qin Zong gave him a gift. Banquet, what a grand birthday banquet! At this time, it is April again, and the Qianlong Festival is approaching. However, at this time, China is in a state of chaos, and the mountains and rivers are changing hands. How could the poet endure such drastic changes when looking back at the present and recalling the past? So thousands of feelings turned into words that people can&#39;t bear to read: &quot;The tears in the eyes are empty and the blood is crying.&quot; This sentence is sad and sad, and it is soul-stirring. Xiang Ziyi was a general who advocated resistance to the Jin Dynasty. In 1130 AD (the fourth year of Emperor Jianyan&#39;s reign), the Jin soldiers marched southward in large numbers, killing all the way to Jiangxi and Hunan. At this time, when Xiangzi was appointed as the magistrate of Zhengtan Prefecture (now Changsha), someone suggested that he should temporarily avoid the enemy&#39;s attack. He shouted: &quot;What kind of disloyalty is there! Let one or two of Xiangzhi&#39;s counties be able to defend the country. The enemy is here? The imperial court asked me to guard Panye, and it is unjust to leave here!&quot; (See Wang Yingchen&#39;s &quot;Xiang Gong&#39;s Epitaph&quot; and Hu Hong&#39;s &quot;Xiang Shilang&#39;s Departure&quot;) He personally led the army and the people to fight in bloody battles for several days, and finally The city was destroyed due to lack of strength. Afterwards, his good friend Chen Yuyi gave him a poem, in which he praised &quot;Zhu Tian&#39;s meritorious deeds are due to you&quot; (&quot;Picture of Xiang Bo Gong&#39;s Crossing the Gorge&quot;). However, the poet thought about the destruction of the family and the country, the humiliation of the king and the humiliation of his ministers, but he was unable to recover, and his heart could not help but be filled with extreme resentment and sorrow. Such deep and difficult emotions are stagnating in my chest, and they cannot be extinguished by just &quot;the eyes are full of tears and the blood is crying&quot;. The above is the second level of word meaning. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Immediately afterwards, the poet associated the human &quot;empty cry of blood&quot; with the rules of nature, and his emotions took on another level. According to the requirements of the tone of &quot;Qin Lou Yue&quot;, &quot;empty crying blood&quot; is inherited from the previous sentence. It is not a simple repetition of the sentence, but is used to evoke the meaning of the following sentence. The poet set up the scene according to the situation, and ended the whole poem with such a sad and desolate artistic conception as &quot;outside the sound of Zigui, the dawn wind is waning and the moon is waning&quot;. Zigui is the cuckoo bird. Zigui cries for blood is commonly used in ancient poetry, such as Bai Juyi&#39;s &quot;Pipa Xing&quot;: &quot;What did I hear at dawn and dusk? The cuckoo crows and the blood ape screams.&quot; Li Shanfu&#39;s &quot;Wen Zigui&quot;: &quot;I miss my homeland with a broken heart, and the blood splashes on the branches when I cry.&quot; &quot;The dawn wind is waning and the moon is waning&quot; is a famous line in Liu Yong&#39;s poem &quot;Yulin Ling&quot;. Although this poem is a transfer, the poet obviously transformed the connotation of &quot;cuckoo cries blood&quot;. What this word expresses is no longer the sorrow of parting, but the longing for the homeland caused by the destruction of the country and the death of the family. &quot;Beyond the sound of Zigui, the dawn wind is waning and the moon is waning&quot;, the scenery is set up due to emotion, which is what Wang Guowei calls &quot;viewing things with me, all old things have my color&quot;, &quot;a state of self&quot;. With its rich connotation, it conveys the infinite sadness in the poet&#39;s heart and hits the readers&#39; hearts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The whole poem is full of sincere emotions and blends with scenes. In &quot;Wine Side Ci&quot;, it is a successful poem. But in the end, it is more loyal and indignant than bold, and the artistic conception in the poem is less original and lacks freshness, which inevitably affects its artistic appeal and is not the best among Song Dynasty poems. &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;Creative background&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>; This poem was written in the late spring after the Jingkang Incident (1126-1127), when the second Huiqin clan was kidnapped by the Jin people. The Central Plains fell into the hands of the Jin people, while the Southern Song Dynasty court stayed in a corner and did not want to regain the lost territory and welcomed back the two Huiqin sects. The poet wrote this poem to express the sadness and resentment of his family and country. &lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;About the author&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;Xiang Ziyi (yīn) (1085-1152), courtesy name Bo Gong, also known as Xianglin Jushi, was born in Linjiang (now Qingjiang County, Jiangxi Province). In the third year of Zhe Zong&#39;s Yuanfu reign (1100), he supplemented his official position with Yin. During the reign of Emperor Huizong&#39;s Xuanhe period, he served as deputy transit envoy to the capital and deputy shipping envoy. Gaozong Jianyan was appointed as the shipping envoy to the Jianghuai River. Su and Li Gang were good, Li Gang was dismissed as prime minister, and Zi Yan was also dismissed. After learning about Tanzhou, the following year Jin soldiers surrounded Tanzhou, and Ziyi led the army and civilians to hold on for eight days. In Shaoxing, he was a minister of the Ministry of Household Affairs and knew Pingjiang Prefecture. He was dismissed from his post because he opposed Qin Hui&#39;s peace proposal and lived in Linjiang. His poems were bounded by the southern crossing. The style of the early period was gorgeous. After the southern crossing, many of his poems were about sadness and concern for the country. There are two volumes of &quot;Wine Bian Ci&quot;. &lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 26 Sep 2023 10:23:05 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[题郑所南兰 | 倪瓒]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://feedx.net/read?r=shiwen&d=239262]]><description> &lt;h2>;Inscribed on Zheng Suo Nan Lan&lt;/h2>;[Yuan Dynasty] Ni Zan&lt;div style=&quot;color: #5b4636;&quot;>;&lt;p>;The autumn wind turns orchids into grass, and the desolation of the southern country has disappeared. &lt;br />;Only Suo Nan’s heart remains unchanged, and the tears and ink are used to write about Li Sao. &lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;h3>;Translation and annotations&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Translation&lt;br />;&lt;/strong>;The autumn wind is fierce, the orchids turn into grass, and the quiet life of Jiangnan is gone remove. &lt;br />;Only Suonan remained loyal and expressed his patriotism with tears and ink. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Notes&lt;br />;&lt;/strong>;Zheng Suonan: a survivor of the Southern Song Dynasty and a painter. His poems and paintings mostly express his nostalgia for his motherland and his steadfast national integrity. &lt;br />;Lanhui: orchid grass, cymbidium grass. Mao: thatch. &lt;br />;Nanguo: generally refers to the vast area south of the Yangtze River. Qi has disappeared: the vitality of all things has disappeared. This is a metaphor that the remnant’s ambition to restore the country has disappeared. &lt;br />;So-nam’s heart has not changed: Zheng So-nam’s desire to restore the country has never changed. &lt;br />;Fountain of Tears: Tears. &lt;br />;Li Sao: A patriotic poem by the patriotic poet Qu Yuan. &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;Appreciation&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;p>; At the beginning of the poem, he expresses his feelings about the orchids painted by Zheng Suonan. But this feeling was expressed by the author through his own imagination, after transforming the orchid painted by Zheng Suonan. Zheng Suonan paints orchids that have no contact with the earth. The author imagines that the orchids in this painting have turned into thatch in the chilling autumn wind. Here the author uses the poetic meaning in Qu Yuan&#39;s &quot;Li Sao&quot; that &quot;the orchids have changed and become less fragrant, and the water chestnuts have turned into grass; the grass was fragrant in the past, but it is now Xiao Ai.&quot; In this way, it shows that the death of the Song Dynasty After that, not only was the country ravaged by the Mongolian rulers, but many people were tortured, some rebelled, and some had their willpower to resist the Yuan Dynasty and restore the country exhausted. Moreover, the entire &quot;Southern Country&quot; is desolate and lifeless. These two sentences describe how after the fall of the Southern Song Dynasty, under the cruel rule of the Mongols, the struggle to resist the Yuan Dynasty and restore the country had gradually declined. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The next two sentences turn to praise Zheng Suonan. It is said that only Zheng Suonan remained loyal to the Southern Song Dynasty. He used his tears and ink to paint orchids, and wrote another &quot;Li Sao&quot; in the form of painting. This shows Zheng Suonan&#39;s steadfast national integrity and firm patriotic belief. The author praises Zheng Suonan, and actually expresses his national integrity of never succumbing to any violence. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The whole poem uses contrasting techniques. The first two sentences use the method of comparison to show the increasingly depressed scene of people&#39;s struggle to resist the Yuan Dynasty and restore the country under the cruel rule of the Mongolian Yuan Dynasty. The last two sentences describe that Zheng Suonan&#39;s loyalty to the country remains unchanged. The first two sentences are used to contrast the last two sentences, which shows the meaning. The value of Nanjian’s steadfastness and patriotism. As Confucius said: &quot;When the cold comes, the pines and cypresses will wither.&quot;&lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;Creative background&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>; &quot;Inscribed on Zheng Suo Nanlan&quot; is a poem on painting. It is the Qijue inscribed for the ink orchid painted by Zheng Suonan. Ni Zan knew Zheng Suonan&#39;s heart well, so he wrote this poem to express his national consciousness. &lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;About the author&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;div>;&lt;center>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://song.gushiwen.cn/authorImg/nizan.jpg&quot; width=50%>;&lt;/ center>;&lt;/div>;Ni Zan (1301～1374), a painter and poet in the Yuan Dynasty.
