Xijing: Chang&#39;an. &lt;br />;Yazhang: A military talisman used to send troops in ancient times. It is divided into two pieces, and the joint is shaped like a tooth. The court and the commander each hold one half. Refers to a general who is ordered to go on an expedition. Fengque: the name of the palace. There was a golden phoenix on the round tower of Jianzhang Palace in the Han Dynasty, so the phoenix tower refers to the imperial palace. &lt;br />;Dragon City: Also known as Dragon Court, it is located on the east bank of the Orkhon River in present-day Mongolia. An important place for the Xiongnu during the Han Dynasty. Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty sent Wei Qing to attack the Xiongnu, and he won here. This refers to the enemy stronghold outside the wall. &lt;br />;Wither: The original meaning is that the vegetation has withered and withered, which means it has lost its bright color. &lt;br />;Centurion: The leader of a hundred soldiers, generally referring to junior officers. &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;Appreciation&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;p>; This poem borrows the old Yuefu title &quot;Joining the Army&quot; to describe the whole process of a scholar joining the army at the frontier and participating in the battle. In just forty words, it not only reveals the psychological activities of the characters, but also exaggerates the atmosphere of the environment. The writing is extremely powerful. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>; The first couplet was written as a side report, arousing the patriotic enthusiasm of the patriots. The poet did not directly state the emergency of the military situation, but said that &quot;the beacon fire shines on Xijing&quot;, expressing the emergency of the military situation through the visual scene of &quot;beacon fire&quot;. The word &quot;zhao&quot; exaggerates the tense atmosphere. &quot;I feel uneasy&quot; was caused by the war. Every man is responsible for the rise and fall of a country. He does not want to waste his youth between pens and inkstones. The word &quot;自&quot; expresses the scholar&#39;s heartfelt patriotic passion and describes the character&#39;s spiritual state. The first two sentences explain the background of the entire incident. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Zhao Lian writes about the process of the commander-in-chief bidding farewell to the capital, rushing to the front line to fight, and surrounding the enemy&#39;s castle with an overwhelming force. The word &quot;ci&quot; shows the solemnity of those who are ordered to lead an expedition; the word &quot;circuit&quot; shows the infinite power of the cavalry, which surrounds the enemy troops. Dragon City is a famous city of the Xiongnu, here it refers to the enemy&#39;s fortress. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>; The neck couplet follows the chin couplet closely. The poet captures the main images of nature in mid-winter, &quot;snow&quot; and &quot;wind&quot;, and depicts the tense scene of the confrontation between the two armies. The visual of the first sentence: the battle flags were fluttering everywhere in the heavy snow; the auditory of the second sentence: the roar of the wind mixed with the sound of marching war drums. The two poems are full of sound and color, and each is wonderful in its own way. The poet uses the &quot;flag&quot; and &quot;drum&quot; that symbolize the army to express the strong and fearless spirit of the soldiers fighting the enemy in the snow and the tragic and fierce scenes of fighting the enemy bravely inspired by the sound of the war drum. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>; The last couplet &quot;It is better to be a centurion than a scholar&quot; expresses the common wish of the intellectuals in the early Tang Dynasty to make contributions to the country. Li Zehou said, &quot;At that time, from the high school to the humble scholar, from the upper class to the market, in the early Tang Dynasty, in the era of Tian Khan (Taizong) who conquered the east and west, defeated the Turks, defeated Tufan, and recruited Huihe, there was a sense of honor and merit for the country. Heroism permeates the social atmosphere.&quot; These two lines of Yang Jiong&#39;s poem were the strongest voice of the scholar class at that time and had the characteristics of the times. The same spirit is also reflected in Yang Jiong&#39;s other poems. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>; This short poem describes the whole process of a scholar joining the army and going out to join the war. Being able to condense such rich content into a limited space shows the poet&#39;s artistic skill. First of all, the poet grasped the most representative fragments of the whole process and made a general description. As for how the scholar joined the army, how he said goodbye to his parents and his wife, and what the march was like along the way, the poet could not leave it out. Write. Secondly, the poem adopts a jumping structure, jumping from one typical scene to another, developing and advancing in leaps and bounds. For example, the third sentence has just written &quot;Resigning to Beijing&quot;, and the fourth sentence has already surrounded the enemy, and then shows the scene of fierce battle. However, this kind of jump is very natural, and each span leaves a lot of room for imagination. At the same time, this jumping structure gives the poem a lively rhythm, like the rushing water on the cliff, giving people a straight-forward and indomitable momentum, which effectively highlights the strong patriotic passion of the scholar and the heroic spirit of the Tang army&#39;s generals. face. &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;Creative background&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>; From 679 to 681 AD (the Tiaolu and Yonglong years of Emperor Gaozong of the Tang Dynasty), Tubo and Turks invaded the Gansu area many times, and Pei Xingjian was ordered to go out to conquer them. In Tang Ruxun&#39;s &quot;Interpretation of Tang Poetry&quot;, he believed that the author felt unfair when he saw that the imperial court emphasized martial arts but neglected literature, and only military officers were favored, so he pretended to write poems to vent his complaints. &lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;About the author&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;div>;&lt;center>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://song.gushiwen.cn/authorImg/yangjiong.jpg&quot; width=50%>;&lt;/ center>;&lt;/div>;Yang Jiong (650-692), named Lingming, was born in Hongnong Huayin (now Shaanxi) and ranked seventh. A poet of the Tang Dynasty, one of the four outstanding figures of the early Tang Dynasty. In the sixth year of Xianqing (661 AD), Yang Jiong, who was only 11 years old, was promoted as a child prodigy.

Later, he was appointed as a bachelor of Chongwen Hall and moved to Zhan Shi and Sizhi. In the first year of Chui Gong (685), he was demoted to Zizhou Judiciary and joined the army. In the first year of Tianshou (690), he taught in the Luoyang Palace Academy. In the autumn of the first year of Ruyi (692), he was appointed magistrate of Yingchuan County. He was famous for his harsh administration and died in his post. Therefore, later generations called him &quot;Yang Yingchuan&quot;. &lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 08 Oct 2023 04:23:07 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[九日 | 文森]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://feedx.net/read?r=shiwen&d=231071]]><description> &lt;h2>;Nine Days&lt;/h2>;[Ming Dynasty] Vincent&lt;div style=&quot;color: #5b4636;&quot;>;Three years have passed since the Double Ninth Festival chrysanthemum was bloomed. &lt;br />;How can I drink wine today and suddenly see the flowers in my hometown? &lt;br />;There are clouds and trees in the wilderness, and geese gather on the sand in the cold weather. &lt;br />;When you come to Infinity, you can see Beijing. &lt;/div>;&lt;h3>;Translation and annotations&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Translation&lt;/strong>;&lt;br />;Three years later, the chrysanthemums in the courtyard are still in full bloom on the Double Ninth Festival. Unfortunately, I am not here at this time. A stranger in a foreign land. Who would have thought that I would be drinking alone today? I could only hold my candle to the chrysanthemums in my hometown and look far into the distance. The clouds in the distance seemed to be connected to the trees. The weather begins to turn cold, and the wild geese move south in groups. I climbed up alone during the Double Ninth Festival and felt filled with emotions. Everywhere you look you see unfamiliar scenery, but there is no trace of your hometown. &lt;br />;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Notes&lt;/strong>;&lt;br />;When: Where did I think of it. &lt;br />;There are clouds and trees in the wilderness: Meng Haoran &quot;The sky is vast and the trees are low.&quot; &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;About the author&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;Wensen (1462-1525), a poet and Jinshi, named Zongyan, was born in Changzhou County, Nazhili (now Suzhou, Jiangsu Province).
