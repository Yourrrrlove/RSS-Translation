There are many ancient tombs on Beimang Mountain in the north of Luoyang City. &lt;br />;Polar: In ancient times, trees such as poplar, pine, and cypress were often planted on tombs as symbols to facilitate the sacrifices of descendants. &lt;br />;Chen Shiren: a person who has been dead for a long time. Chen, long. &lt;br />;杳杳: dark appearance. That is: Just, it still means &quot;being present&quot;. Changdu: long night. This sentence means that when a person dies and is buried in a grave, it is like being in darkness forever. &lt;br />;Qian sleep: deep sleep. &lt;br />;寤(wù): wake up. &lt;br />;Haohao: appearance. Yin and Yang: The ancients regarded spring and summer as yang, and autumn and winter as yin. This sentence means that the passage of time is like a river flowing eastward, endless. &lt;br />;Year: It still means &quot;life span&quot;. &lt;br />;Sudden: sudden appearance. Send: sojourn. &lt;br />;Update: change. Long live: I still say &quot;since ancient times&quot;. This sentence means that since ancient times, life and death have changed, and one generation has sent another generation away. &lt;br />;Du: too far, still means &quot;beyond&quot;. This sentence means that even sages cannot transcend the law of &quot;life must lead to death.&quot; &lt;br />;Quilt: Same as &quot;draped&quot;, worn. &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;Appreciation&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;p>; This poem is written in the form of a lyrical protagonist expressing his true feelings. It expresses a part of the people who lived a prosperous life during the great turmoil in the late Eastern Han Dynasty. The desolate mentality of intellectuals who cannot find a way out in politics. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Luoyang, the capital of Eastern Han Dynasty, has a total of twelve city gates. There are three gates to the east, and the one to the north is called the &quot;upper east gate&quot;. Guo, outer city. In the Han Dynasty, the old custom was followed, and most of the dead were buried in Guobei. Beishan Mountain in the north of Luoyang City is a place of mass burials; the &quot;Guobei Tomb&quot; in the poem refers to the Mangshan Tombs. The protagonist drove out of the upper east gate, looked to the north of the city, and saw the trees in the Mangshan Cemetery. He couldn&#39;t help but feel sad, so he wrote about what he saw and felt with two sentences: &quot;The poplars are swaying, and the pines and cypresses are sandwiched between the wide roads.&quot; &quot;Xiao Xiao&quot; is the sound of leaves. The protagonist parked his car outside the Shangdong Gate, which was still some distance away from the Beimang Cemetery. He should not have heard the rustling of the poplars on the tomb. The reason why the poplar leaves rustle is the result of the swaying of the long wind; but the scene of the wind shaking the poplar branches and the turning of the leaves can be seen from a distance. Looking at its shape, thinking about its sound, and forming synaesthesia, the visual image and the auditory image are combined into one. There is another layer: the protagonist originally lived in Luoyang City, and had nothing to do, but he wanted to leave the city, and he happened to go out of the upper east gate. As soon as he left the city gate, he &quot;looked at Guobei Tomb in the distance&quot;, which showed that he had already left the city. Negatively thinking about the fate of life, I feel very sad. Therefore, when he saw the poplars and cypresses, he first fell in love with the scene, and then he was moved by the scene. &quot;How&quot; is used as an adverbial before &quot;Xiao Xiao&quot;, which has a very strong emotional color. The sentence that writes &quot;pines and cypresses&quot; seems to be relatively plain, but only the tombs of wealthy people have broad tomb passages. Nowadays, there are only pine and cypresses on &quot;Jiaguang Road&quot;, and the scene of Xiaoqin can also be vaguely imagined. So I thought of the dead people under the tomb from the trees on the tomb, and said it in ten lines:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; When a person dies, it is like falling into a long night, sleeping under the underworld, for thousands of years, never to wake up again . Spring, summer, autumn, and winter flow endlessly; but human life is like morning dew, which disappears as soon as the sun shines. Life is like a hotel where a traveler spends a night, walks out of the hotel, and never returns. Human life is not as solid as gold and stone, and cannot withstand many stumbles. As the years pass by, they are replaced by new ones, and the cycle continues endlessly; even saints and sages cannot surpass it and live forever. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In Taoist classics, &quot;life is like a message&quot; is a metaphor, which means that life is temporary, like returning home from a journey; while Tao is eternal, like one&#39;s own home. Taoists believe that everything in the world is nothing but the transformation of one Qi. When Qi gathers, life occurs, and when Qi disperses, death occurs. Therefore, &quot;Xi Zi&quot; quotes &quot;Lao Lai Zi&quot; as saying: &quot;Life is sent between heaven and earth. Those who send it return together. The ancients said that the dead are the people who return, and their lives also exist, and their deaths also die, and their lives are also small. Yes, and the years pass by quickly.&quot; &quot;Lieh-tzu&quot; says: &quot;Death and life go in and out of the same direction, so those who die in this way know that they will not be reborn in the other.&quot; &quot;Zhuangzi&quot; says: &quot;If life and death are shortened, How can we force it? If we do evil, we know that rejoicing in life is not because of delusion. If we do evil, we know that it is evil to die because we are weak and lost and do not know how to return. If we do evil, we know that the dead will not regret the original life.&quot; Some scholars believe that these are Buddhist ideas of reincarnation. In fact, this statement is intended to prove that the Taoist idea of ​​​​equalizing life and death belongs to the idea of ​​&quot;equalizing things&quot;, which is consistent with what &quot;Zhuangzi Zhibeiyou Chapter&quot; said: &quot;Life is also the disciple of death, and death is also the beginning of life. Who knows it?&quot; Similar to &quot;Ji&quot;, the Taoist theory of biochemistry is a pure theory of biochemistry of all things without any religious overtones. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Here, the poet discussed in great detail the natural law that life is inevitable, and no matter who it is, the result is the same. This lays the foundation for further explaining that those who &quot;take food to seek immortality&quot; want to live forever but cannot achieve it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Everyone hopes that they will live forever. At that time, it was very popular to make elixirs and ask for medicines to seek immortality. In this regard, the poet said: &quot;Taking food to seek immortality is mostly mistaken for medicine. It is better to drink fine wine and be taken to be rich and simple.&quot; These four sentences mean that even if you take elixirs and seek immortality, you will not be able to live forever. In this case, it is better to drink fine wine, wear silk and satin, enjoy the happiness in front of you, and live a short life happily. Here, on the surface, the poet feels wistful about the shortness of life. In fact, the poet&#39;s lament about life not only expresses the decadent thoughts and desolate mentality of the intellectuals at that time, but also implies his love for life. The reason why the poet said this is not only a kind of anger, but also a kind of helplessness. &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;Creative background&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;p>; This poem is one of the &quot;Nineteen Ancient Poems&quot;. Modern people comprehensively examine the emotional tendencies expressed, the social life situations reflected in &quot;Nineteen Ancient Poems&quot; and its sophisticated artistic skills. It is generally believed that the age of these nineteen poems should be several dozen years before Emperor Xian&#39;an in the late Han Dynasty. Years. &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;About the author&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;Also known as anonymous, it refers to a person whose identity is unknown or whose name has not yet been learned. Literary and musical works originating from ancient times or among the people and whose author is unknown will be named anonymously. &lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 19 Sep 2023 04:23:17 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[素冠 | 诗经·国风·桧风]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://feedx.net/read?r=shiwen&d=239181]]><description> &lt;h2>;Su Guan&lt;/h2>;[Pre-Qin] The Book of Songs · National Style · Cypress Wind &lt;div style=&quot;color: #5b4636;&quot;>;&lt;p>;See a common man with a plain crown? The thorny people are anxious, and the hard work is unbearable. &lt;br />;See you in plain clothes? My heart is sad and sad, and I want to talk about returning home with my son. &lt;br />;Common people see Sui Xi? My heart is full of knots, and I talk to my son as one. &lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;h3>;Translation and annotations&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Translation&lt;br />;&lt;/strong>;I am honored to see you wearing a white crown and observing etiquette, and seeing that your body is like this Thin and haggard, they are all sad and tired from doing the rituals. &lt;br />;I am honored to see you wearing white clothes and observing etiquette. I can&#39;t help but feel sad and sad. I really want to go home with you all the way. &lt;br />;I am honored to see you with your white crown, white clothes, and white covering your knees. Deep in my heart, I am filled with sadness, and I wish I could merge with your sorrow! &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Notes&lt;br />;&lt;/strong>;Su Guan: white hat. &lt;br />;Shu: Fortunately. &lt;br />;thorny man: sinner. Thorns, the place where prisoners are held. One thing is to say, thin. Luan Luan: Restricted, not free. One thing to say, he is thin and barren. &lt;br />;Tuán (tuán) Tuán: distressed and restless. &lt;br />;Chat: wish. Say &quot;and&quot;. &lt;br />;韠(bì): Covering the knees, decorated in ancient official uniforms, made of leather, sewn on the knees under the abdomen. &lt;br />;Yunjie: depression, worry and incomprehension. &lt;br />;Ruyi: Just like the same person. &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;Appreciation&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;p>; If this poem is regarded as a poem that laments the persecution and ostracism of virtuous ministers, then the first chapter writes about the persecution and ostracism of the virtuous minister. A virtuous minister, he wears a plain crown on his head, his body is thin and weak, and he is worried. From his external appearance to his inner activities, the character&#39;s image is gradually revealed, which is quite similar to Qu Zi&#39;s poem about the bank of the river, &quot;the description is haggard and the color is haggard&quot;. With a strong tragic atmosphere. In the second and third chapters, the first sentence still writes about the clothing of &quot;thorn people&quot;. In the previous chapter, &quot;Su Guan&quot; and &quot;Su Yi&quot; and &quot;Su Ji&quot; describe the whole body clothing of &quot;thorn people&quot; from top to bottom. The word &quot;Su&quot; It reminds people of the innocent and noble image of a wise minister. The second sentence, &quot;My heart is sad,&quot; directly expresses the poet&#39;s feelings. The third sentence, such as &quot;returning together&quot; and &quot;ruyi&quot;, shows the poet&#39;s wishes, and his thoughts and emotions are a step further than &quot;sadness&quot; and &quot;condensation&quot;. The characters in the whole poem are vivid and the poet has deep emotions. Each sentence ends with the modal particle &quot;xi&quot;, and the sad sound lingers in the ears. In a dangerous political environment, when virtuous ministers were persecuted and ostracized, the poet showed no scruples and clearly expressed his sympathy and his attitude of sharing the same fate with them. This kind of spirit is commendable and is very instructive in the world of friendship and friendship. It can be seen that the poet is also a virtuous man. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; This poem starts from the first chapter about plain crowns, the second chapter about plain clothes, and the third chapter further switches to plain covering the knees, from top to bottom, all the way down, the gentlemen the poet meets are all in plain clothes. His pure white attire and simple moral character are awe-inspiring. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; If this poem is regarded as a love poem, then the first sentence of each chapter represents the person with clothing, expressing the eagerness to see the other person, the second sentence expresses the sorrow and sadness due to not being able to see the other person, and the last sentence says May we always be united. &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;Creative background&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>; Regarding the background of this poem, old theories such as &quot;Preface to Mao&#39;s Poems&quot;, Zheng Jian, Zhu Xi&#39;s &quot;Collected Poems&quot;, etc. are mostly limited to &quot;plain crown&quot; , &quot;plain clothes&quot;, this is considered to be a fierce and filial dress, which means that in the poem written in the late Zhou Dynasty, the rites and music were broken, and most people who were sons of men could not observe the three-year funeral, but in the poem, those who wore &quot;plain clothes&quot; could fulfill their filial piety and observe the funeral rituals . &quot;Modern Notes on the Book of Songs&quot; says: &quot;This is a poem praising a filial son.&quot; Some people think it is a love poem. &lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;About the author&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 18 Sep 2023 05:23:05 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
