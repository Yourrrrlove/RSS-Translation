There are thirty thousand hectares of Yujian and Qiongtian fields, one leaf of which is on my boat. The plain moon shines separately, the bright river shares its shadow, and both the outside and inside are clear. I have a leisurely heart, but it’s hard to tell you the beauty of it. (Same as: Author; First Jade Mirror: Jade World)&lt;br />;I should remember the years of Linghai, the lonely light shines on me, and my liver and lungs are all ice and snow. The short hair is fluttery, the sleeves are cold, and the waves are steady and wide. Stroll the Xijiang River, pour the Beidou carefully, and treat everything as a guest. The boat is whistling alone, I don’t know what night it is! (The first work of Liver and Lung: liver and gallbladder; the first work of Canglang: Cang Ming; the first work of Zuyi: Zui Su; the first work of Linghai: Lingbiao)&lt;/div>;&lt;h3>;Translation and annotation&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong >;Translation&lt;/strong>;&lt;br />;Dongting Lake and Qingcao Lake are connected and are vast and boundless. As the Mid-Autumn Festival is approaching, there is no wind at all. The calm and clear lake surface is like a mirror made of white jade, like a field paved with beautiful jade. It is as wide as 30,000 hectares. There is only my small boat floating on the lake. The bright moon and the brilliant Milky Way reflected their beauty in the vast jade mirror, and the water above and below was bright and clear. I feel the emptiness of all things, but I don’t know how to share this wonderful experience with you. &lt;br />;You should consider that during the year or so of official life outside the mountains, the moonlight always shone and accompanied you, and your mind was as bright and clear as ice and snow. Nowadays (although) I feel that my short hair is sparse due to old age, and my clothes are thin and cold, (but) I can still calmly paddle in this vast and vast sky. Let me hold up all the clear water of the Xijiang River and pour it carefully into the wine spoon made of the Big Dipper. I invite all the heaven and earth to be my guests. I slap the side of my boat to my heart&#39;s content and sing loudly alone. How can I remember? What year is this! &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Notes&lt;/strong>;&lt;br />;Zhang Xiaoxiang: courtesy name Anguo, nickname Yuhu Jushi, a famous patriotic poet in the Southern Song Dynasty. &lt;br />;Dongting: the name of the lake, located southwest of Yueyang, Hunan. &lt;br />;Wind color: wind force. &lt;br />;Qiong: Beautiful jade. &lt;br />;With: attached. Bianzhou: small boat. &lt;br />;Suyue: the white moon. &lt;br />;Minghe: Tianhe. Minghe&#39;s work &quot;Galaxy&quot;. &lt;br />;Inside and outside: inside and outside. Here it means that the light of the moon and the Milky Way in the sky are reflected in the lake, making it clear above and below. &lt;br />;Linghai: outside the ridge, that is, the Guangdong and Guangxi area south of Wuling. The author was previously an official in Guangxi. Linghai: One is &quot;Lingbiao&quot;. &lt;br />;Guguang: refers to moonlight. &lt;br />;Liver and lungs: one means &quot;liver and gallbladder&quot;. &lt;br />;Ice and snow: a metaphor for an upright and aboveboard heart as pure as ice and snow. &lt;br />;Xiao Sao: sparse. Xiao Sao wrote &quot;Xiao Shu&quot;. Cold sleeves: describes thin clothes. &lt;br />;Canglang: blue water. Canglang wrote &quot;Cangming&quot;. &lt;br />;挌(yì): scoop. One stroke means &quot;suck&quot;. Xijiang: The Yangtze River connects to Dongting Lake, and its middle and upper reaches are to the west of Dongting, so it is called Xijiang. &lt;br />;Beidou: the name of the constellation. It consists of seven stars arranged in the shape of a ladle for ladling wine. &lt;br />;Wanxiang: all things. &lt;br />;Buckle: knock. One button is used as &quot;knock&quot;. Xiao: making a sound with a small mouth. Xiao Yi said &quot;laugh&quot;. &lt;br />;I don’t know what to say, praising the beauty of the night makes people so intoxicated that they forget everything (including time). &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;Appreciation&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;p>; The first part of this poem first describes the moonlight scenery of Dongting Lake, highlighting its clarity. &quot;The green grass in Dongting is almost the Mid-Autumn Festival, and there is no wind at all.&quot; Green grass is another lake connected to Dongting. These few sentences express the crisp autumn air and clear jade scenery, which is the general impression of Dongting. It is easy to overlook the word &quot;风色&quot;, but it is actually worth pondering. The wind has different directions, strong and weak, and is there also different colors? Maybe it can be said that there is no. But sensitive poets can feel the changes in the wind and clouds. Li Bai&#39;s &quot;The Ballad of Mount Lu&quot;: &quot;Climbing high is a spectacular sight. Between heaven and earth, the vast river will never return. The yellow clouds are thousands of miles away, and the wind is moving, and the white waves are flowing over the snow-capped mountains.&quot; Those thousands of miles of yellow clouds change the color of the wind. Zhang Xiaoxiang said here that &quot;there is no trace of beauty&quot;, which means that there are no clouds in the Dongting Lake and the water is calm. The reading is cold and casual, which makes people yearn for it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;The Jade Mirror has 30,000 hectares of Qiongtian, and one leaf of my flat boat.&quot; The Jade Mirror is a jade mirror. Qiong is a beautiful jade, Qiongtian is a jade field. &quot;Jade Mirror Qiongtian&quot; describes the clearness and smoothness of the lake. &quot;Thirty thousand hectares&quot; shows the vastness of the lake. With, still with, or interpreted as attached. The boat is floating and flowing on the lake. How can it be said to be attached? Author, An Ye, Zhi Ye, Rong Ye. Chen Yuyi&#39;s &quot;He Wang Dongqing&quot;: &quot;Whenever I stick to the stern of my boat, my sleeves are full of west wind.&quot; Lu You&#39;s &quot;Ti Zhaibi&quot;: &quot;Jishan has been green for thousands of years, and I have a fishing boat in front of the mountain.&quot; This is the meaning. Zhang Xiaoxiang said: &quot;There are thirty thousand hectares of Yujian Qiongtian, and I have a leaf on my boat.&quot; On the thirty thousand hectares of lake, I placed my little boat, which means that all nature is at my disposal, which effectively sets off the The heroic spirit of the poet. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;The moon shines separately, and the bright river shines together, both inside and outside are clear.&quot; These three sentences describe the water and sky reflecting the crystal clear light. &quot;Su Yue divides the brilliance&quot; means that the bright moon shines on the lake, and the reflection of the lake water is very bright, as if Su Yue has given some of its brilliance to the lake. &quot;Minghe reflects together&quot; means that the Milky Way in the sky is projected into the lake very clearly, and the upper and lower Milky Ways are equally bright. The plain moon separates its brilliance, and the bright river shares its shadow.&quot; These two sentences highlight the brilliance of the moon and stars, and implicitly write the color of the water, which expresses the transparent situation above and below, as if it were a world of glass. So the next sentence says: &quot;Both the outside and the inside are clear. &quot;This sentence is the main theme of the whole poem. After all, what is the beauty of Dongting&#39;s autumn colors? The poet pointed out in this sentence that the beauty lies in &quot;clarity&quot;. The beauty here is that the outside and the inside are the same, which is smooth and transparent Beauty is the highest state. The five words &quot;clear on the outside and inside&quot; describe everything around it, from the sky to the water. Dongting Lake is transparent up and down, without a trace of turbidity. This is not just The description of the scene also contains a deep meaning. These five words mark an extremely noble state of mind, such as being upright, open-minded, consistent in words and deeds, and consistent in appearance and inside. These meanings are all included in it. Du Fu has a poem: &quot;My heart and mind are both happy and clear.&quot; &quot; (One of the three poems in &quot;Screen Tracks&quot;), the heart is the inner heart, that is, the inside, and the traces are the deeds, that is, the appearance. The clearness of the heart and traces means the clarity of the outside and the inside. &quot;Both the exterior and the interior are clear, and the heart traces and joy are both clear.&quot; It is just right. It can be integrated into a couplet to establish a code for us to live in the world. We might as well use it as our motto. When Zhang Xiaoxiang was boating in Dongting, he was admiring the natural scenery and at the same time entrusting his aesthetic ideals in nature. . The beautiful scenery he writes makes us feel that his own personality is in it. The poet has noble aesthetic ideals and a pure heart, which is why his pen and ink can be so clean.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The last part of the film says: &quot;Youran It’s hard for me to tell you the beauty of my heart. &quot;Dongting Lake is clear, and the poet&#39;s heart is also clear. The object state and the state of mind are in harmony with each other. This beauty is difficult to express in words. The leisurely, leisurely and contented look is a natural way to describe the relationship between the mind and the object. This state is not obtained by force. On the surface, the beauty seems to refer to the beauty of the Dongting scenery, but in fact it is not. The beauty of the Dongting scenery has been mentioned above. This indescribable beauty should be the wonderful experience of the fusion of mind and body. , only this kind of wonderful experience is difficult to put into words.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The next film focuses on lyricism, writing about the clarity of one&#39;s own heart. &quot;Ying Nianling has been exposed for many years, and the lonely light shines on itself, and the liver and gallbladder are all ice and snow. &quot;Lingbiao refers to the area outside Wuling and present-day Guangdong and Guangxi. The years of Lingbiao refer to the period when the author served as the economic and strategic pacifier on Guangnan West Road. The word &quot;ying&quot; usually means speculation. What I am talking about here is my time at that time. Thoughts do not matter speculation. The tone of the word &quot;ying&quot; is relatively positive, close to the meaning of &quot;cause&quot;. Du Fu&#39;s &quot;Lv Ye Shu Huai&quot;: &quot;It is not famous to write articles. Officials should retire due to old age and illness.&quot; &quot;It still says &quot;the official retired due to old age and illness&quot;, and the word &quot;ying&quot; is also an affirmative tone. &quot;Ying Nian Ling Biao Nian&quot; refers to the scenery of Dongting Lake written in the previous film, so it reminds me of one year&#39;s life in Lingnan. The same light and aboveboard. Lonely light refers to the moonlight. Su Shi&#39;s &quot;Xijiang Moon&quot;: &quot;Who can share the lonely light with me during the Mid-Autumn Festival, looking northward sadly. &quot;The solitary light is used to refer to the moonlight. &quot;The solitary light shines on oneself&quot; means that the solitary moon is the companion and the clear light shines on it, which expresses the aloof mood that is neither understood by others nor needs to be understood by others. &quot;The liver and gallbladder are both ice and snow.&quot; , Ice and snow are all white and crystal clear, which is used to describe the openness of one&#39;s mind. The poet Bao Zhao of the Southern Dynasties said in &quot;Baitou Yin&quot;: &quot;Straight as a red silk rope, as clear as the ice of a jade pot. Another poet from the Southern Dynasties, Jiang Zong, said in &quot;Enter the Qixia Temple in the Photographic Mountain&quot;: &quot;Pure your heart and embrace the ice and snow.&quot; &quot;Wang Changling, a poet of the Tang Dynasty, said in &quot;Farewell to Xin Jian at Furong Tower&quot;: &quot;Relatives and friends in Luoyang are like asking each other, and a heart of ice is in a jade pot. &quot;These all use ice and snow as a metaphor for the purity of the heart. Zhang Xiaoxiang said in this poem: &quot;Ying Nian Ridge has been exposed for many years, and the lonely light shines on itself, and the liver and gallbladder are all ice and snow. &quot;Combined with his experience of being slandered and dismissed, it also means that he has a clear conscience. During that time in Lingnan, he was upright and courageous, just like the 30,000 hectares of Jade and Qiongtian under the plain moon. It is clear on the outside and clear on the inside. The indignation contained in the poet&#39;s confession is easy for me to understand.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;Short hair, slender collar, cold sleeves, stable and empty. &quot;These two sentences are turned back to write about the present. Xiao Sao, describing the sparse and short hair, like autumn vegetation. Combined with the word &quot;cold&quot; at the end to describe me, this Xiao Sao is probably a psychological effect, because the night air is cold , so I feel that my hair is sparse. &quot;Short hair, slender sleeves and cold sleeves&quot; are now dismissed, which inevitably brings a bit of depression and neglect. But the poet&#39;s spirit has not diminished at all: &quot;The sky is steady and the sky is wide.&quot; No matter what the situation is , I can hold it steadily. Cangming originally refers to sea water, but here refers to the vastness of Dongting Lake. This sentence means that I can safely row on the vast Dongting without wavering in my mind. Not only that, the poet also has more Majestic spirit:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;Walk the Xijiang River, pour the Beidou carefully, and treat everything as a guest. &quot;This is the emotional climax of the whole word. Xijiang, the Yangtze River coming from the west. To draw, to draw. &quot;To draw all the water from the Xijiang River&quot; means to drain all the water of the Xijiang River into wine. &quot;Pour the Big Dipper carefully&quot; means to use the Big Dipper as a wine vessel slowly. Slowly pour the wine to drink. The meaning of &quot;Nine Songs: Dongjun&quot; is used here: &quot;Help the Beidou and drink osmanthus syrup&quot;. The poet&#39;s self-image is extremely grand. &quot;Everything&quot; means everything in the world. These sentences are assumptions. I am my own master, and I invite all things to be my guests, and accompany me to drink as much as I want. A man who has been dismissed from office can have such a magnanimous attitude, how confident he must be to do it!&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The last two sentences of the poem have been updated This shows the author&#39;s superb artistic skills: &quot;I&#39;m screaming alone on the side of the ship, I don&#39;t know what night it is!&quot; &quot;The side of the ship. To buckle the side of the ship and knock on the side of the ship is to beat time. Su Shi&#39;s &quot;Red Cliff Fu&quot;: &quot;Buckle the side of the ship and sing. &quot;Xiao, frowning and making a long and crisp sound. Zhang Xiaoxiang said: &quot;Hold the side and whistle alone&quot;, which may have the meaning of Xiao Yong or Xiao Song. &quot;I don&#39;t know what night it is today&quot;, using a sentence from Su Shi&#39;s &quot;Niannujiao·Mid-Autumn Festival&quot;: &quot;Dancing and wandering under the wind and dew, I don&#39;t know what night it is tonight!&quot; &quot;Zhang Xiaoxiang changed slightly and said that he was completely intoxicated and forgot what kind of day it was. These two sentences ended the whole poem, which was very loose and lingering. From such a broad image, he returned to The time pointed out by the three words &quot;near the Mid-Autumn Festival&quot; at the beginning comes up. The beginning and the end echo each other, ending the whole poem.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Zhang Xiaoxiang enjoyed a high status in the poetry world of the early Southern Song Dynasty. He was one of the great poets Xin Qiji A pioneer. He was straightforward and magnanimous, and his writing style was vigorous and vigorous, and he could write it instantly. His style of writing is closest to Su Dongpo&#39;s boldness. Take this song &quot;Niannujiao&quot; as an example. It is very similar to Su Dongpo&#39;s &quot;Shui Diao&quot;. The style of &quot;Gotou&quot; is very similar. &quot;Shui Tiao Getou&quot; was written on the night of the Mid-Autumn Festival. It asks at the beginning: &quot;When will the bright moon come?&quot; Ask the sky for wine. I don’t know what year it is today in the palace in the sky. &quot;Introducing the concept of time and space into the poem contains philosophical implications in the lyrical description of the scene. At the end, it says: &quot;I hope that people will live forever and share the beauty of the moon thousands of miles apart. &quot;I want to break the limitations of time and the barriers of space and build a beautiful life in the world. The whole poem is written boldly and unrestrainedly, and it is superb. Zhang Xiaoxiang&#39;s song &quot;Nian Nujiao&quot; was written on a night close to the Mid-Autumn Festival. He put himself in In the clear and vast lake and moonlight, the lake water and moonlight were transparent, and his heart, liver and gallbladder were also transparent. He felt that he was integrated with nature. He regarded himself as a master, inviting all things to be his guests, and interacted with When nature makes friends, it is equally bold and unrestrained, and it is superb. Su Dongpo&#39;s &quot;Shui Tiao Ge Tou&quot; seems to be in dialogue with the bright moon, exploring the philosophy of life in the dialogue. Zhang Xiaoxiang&#39;s &quot;Niannujiao&quot; turns itself into the moonlight, Turn into the lake water and fly together towards the ideal state of clarity. The two poems are written in different ways and from different angles, but the bold spirit and spirit are very close.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Huang Liaoyuan comments on this The poem says: &quot;If you cannot describe the scenery, you will not be able to describe the emotions, and you will be short of beauty. This title is about the Dongting. If you only think about the Dongting, even though the writing is spectacular, it will be tasteless. This poem starts from Dongting to the thirty thousand hectares of Qiongtian in Jade World. After finishing the title, it introduces the leaf of Bianzhou. The following is written from the reflections of the people in the boat and the lake light. The clutches and couplings are looming, but it is not obvious. The mirror, the mirror, the water and the moon, are two and one. You are in high spirits, and I am overflowing with joy. &quot;(&quot;Selected Poems of Polygonum Garden&quot;) This poem is indeed unique in the blend of emotion and scenery. The skylight and water color, the physical environment and the state of mind, yesterday and tonight, all blend together harmoniously, bright and clear, giving me a sense of joy. People are inspired by the feeling and education of beauty.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; This Mid-Autumn Festival poem was written by the author to express his feelings while boating on Dongting Lake. It starts with the place and time, and then writes about the lake, the boat, the moon, and the Milky Way. At this time, the author remembered During his one-year official career in Lingnan, he felt guilty because of his inaction. He also felt sad when he thought that life was short, but he felt a little comforted because he insisted on the right path. He wanted to use the Beidou as a wine spoon and scoop out all the Yangtze River to make wine. Drink. The whole poem has an exciting style and twists and turns.&lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;Creative background&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>; This song &quot;Nian Nujiao&quot; is Zhang Xiaoxiang&#39;s masterpiece. In 1166 AD (the second year of Emperor Xiaozong&#39;s reign in the Song Dynasty) , Zhang Xiaoxiang was dismissed from office because he was slandered by political enemies. When he returned from Guilin north, he passed by Dongting Lake and fell in love with the scene, so he wrote this poem.&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;Appreciation&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt; p>; This Mid-Autumn Festival poem was written by the author while he was boating on Dongting Lake. It starts with the place and time, and then writes about the lake, the boat, the moon, and the Milky Way. At this time, the author thought of his one-year official career in Lingnan and felt that he had done nothing but accomplished something. He felt guilty. He also felt sad when he thought that life was short, but because he insisted on the right path, he felt a little comforted. He wanted to use the Beidou as a wine spoon to scoop up the Yangtze River to make wine slurry and drink it. The whole poem has an exciting style and twists and turns.&lt;/p >; &lt;p>; &quot;Dongting Spring Grass&quot; refers to Dongting Lake and the connected Spring Grass Lake. It points out the location and the title is &quot;Crossing Dongting&quot;. The title is closely linked to the beginning of the word. &quot;Nearly Mid-Autumn Festival&quot; points out the time, autumn The sky is high and the air is crisp, and &quot;the moon is exceptionally bright during the Mid-Autumn Festival.&quot; The autumn moon must have a special meaning for ancient literati who lived in an agricultural society and were closely related to nature. The word &quot;wind color&quot; is worth noting. The wind has direction and strength. Weak, I have never heard that the wind has color. In fact, Zhang Xiaoxiang’s use of &quot;wind color&quot; has its origins. Li Bai&#39;s &quot;The Ballad of Mount Lu&quot; &quot;Climbing high is spectacular. Between heaven and earth, the vast river will never return.&quot; The yellow clouds are moving thousands of miles, and the white waves are flowing over the snow-capped mountains. &quot;It talks about the thousands of miles of yellow clouds changing the color of the wind; Zhang Xiaoxiang&#39;s &quot;There is no wind at all&quot; talks about the fact that there are no clouds in the Dongting Qingcao Lake, the water is calm, not only there is no wind, but there is no shadow of the wind. This This way of expression is innovative and adds a bit of poetry. &quot;Jade World Qiongtian&quot; describes the vast lake under the autumn moon. &quot;Jie&quot; is also called &quot;Jian&quot;, whether it is Jade World or Jade Mirror Whether it is the jade-like Qiongtian, jade is used to describe the beauty of the clear and transparent lake water, and &quot;ten thousand hectares&quot; expresses the vastness of the lake. With such beautiful scenery on a good day, it would be so pleasant to travel in a small boat. This is a ; points out the way to cross the Dongting, and goes one step closer to the topic, this is the second step.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;The moon is shining separately, the bright river is shadowing together, and both the outside and inside are clear. &quot;Su Yue&#39;s brilliance means that the bright moon distributes its brilliance to the lake. The Milky Way in the water is the reflection of the Milky Way in the sky, and they have the same image of brilliance. The two images of &quot;Su Yue&quot; and &quot;Ming River&quot; point out The characteristics of the sky, &quot;separate brilliance&quot; and &quot;shared shadow&quot; describe the beautiful scenery of autumn water and long sky. Although there are only eight words, it concretely and vividly shows the poet&#39;s talent. &quot;Both the outside and the inside are clear&quot; is this poem The main theme of the word is that it contains two levels of meaning. The first one is to describe the beauty of the autumn moon and autumn water. Where is the beauty? The beauty lies in clarity. Clarity means clear water, and clear means clear water. Up and down, inside and outside, there is no trace of turbidity. There is no trace of pollution, it is so clear and bright, just like the unearthly glass world; the other layer is that I am on the boat on the 30,000-hectare lake, just like the autumn moon, like the autumn water, I am upright and upright, my words and deeds are consistent, and I am the same on the outside. He is a man and a real man. Therefore, being clear on the outside and inside is not only a description of scenery, but also a description of people and the beauty of his own character. Du Fu&#39;s poems have &quot;a happy and clear heart&quot;, and the deeds are the appearance and the heart is the inside. &quot;The happy and clear heart&quot; is Du Fu&#39;s poem. The Master&#39;s Self-Tao; &quot;Both the outside and the inside are clear&quot; is Zhang Xiaoxiang&#39;s Tao of the Master. Yuan Xingpei, director of the Chinese Museum of Literature and History, believes that &quot;both the outside and the inside are clear&quot; and &quot;the heart is both clear and joyful&quot; can be integrated into a couplet, and provide people with a way to live in the world. This is a good rule of thumb.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qu Yuan&#39;s &quot;Li Sao&quot; &quot;Fenwu not only has this inner beauty, but also attaches great importance to cultivation; Hu Jiangli and Pi Zhixi are admired by Ren Qiulan&quot; It describes the unity of Qu Zi&#39;s own inner and outer beauty. Zhang Xiaoxiang further writes about the clear self and unity of the external world and the inner world. It is a kind of self-healing in which nature and man are one, and the beauty of this self-healing is only It is the highest, most beautiful, and most poetic peak experience in life. Therefore, the poet uses &quot;I feel happy, and the beauty is difficult to describe&quot; as the conclusion of the first part, and at the same time cleverly leads to the lower part. The upper part describes the scene. , and the following chapter starts from looking back at the year of Lingbiao to express his feelings.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Lingbiao refers to the area outside Wuling, which is today’s Guangxi. The original biography of &quot;Song History&quot; records that Zhang Xiaoxiang lived in the first year of Emperor Xiaozong&#39;s reign in Song Dynasty (1165) Zhi Jingjiang Prefecture and the Guangnan West Road Manager and Comfort Envoy. He was dismissed from his post due to slander the following year. He returned north from Guilin and passed through Yueyang, so he wrote &quot;Crossing the Dongting&quot;. &quot;Ying&quot;, Yin Ye, Du Fu&#39;s poem &quot;Ying&quot; Isn&#39;t it famous for writing articles? Officials should retire due to old age and illness. &quot;It means that the name was written in articles, and the official retired due to old age and illness. The tone of &quot;Ying&quot; here is quite affirmative. The poet recalled his experience of being dismissed from his post due to slander one year in Lingbiao from the clarity of Dongting Lake, and sighed with emotion. . Su Shi&#39;s &quot;Moon over the West River&quot;: &quot;Who can share the lonely light with me during the Mid-Autumn Festival, looking northward sadly?&quot; Zhang Xiaoxiang used the allusion of &quot;lonely light&quot; from this. &quot;The lonely light shines on itself&quot;, on the one hand, refers to the moon in the sky, only He can shine alone; on the other hand, he thinks of his own mountain for a year and is not understood by others. At the same time, the poet does not need others to understand. He can only keep company with the lonely moon and draw the cold moonlight to shine. The characteristics of ice and snow are White and crystal clear, Jiang Zong, a poet of the Southern Dynasties, once said, &quot;A pure heart embraces ice and snow.&quot; Therefore, &quot;the liver and lungs are all ice and snow.&quot; Tang Wang Changling once said, &quot;A heart of ice is in a jade pot.&quot; Therefore, &quot;the liver and lungs are all ice and snow.&quot; In fact, It means that although I have been dismissed from my post, I am aboveboard, pure-hearted, and courageous. Another meaning is that I have a clear conscience. There is indignation, disappointment, and self-comfort in my words, but it is mainly mixed with pride. , The feelings are sincere and complicated.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;Short hair, slender collar, cold sleeves, steady and clear sky. &quot;This is from Lingbiao over the years to the present. &quot;Jinxiu&quot; uses part to replace the whole. The moonlit night is cold, the clothes are thin, and the coolness suddenly arises. More importantly, the officialdom and human relations are cold and warm, and it is inevitable to feel depressed and neglected. Despite this, , I am a person who can afford to take things up and let them go. Regardless of the wind and waves, I sit firmly on the fishing boat. Now I am boating on the endless Dongting Lake. Isn’t it proof that all these things reflect the poet’s distinctive personality.&lt;/p >; &lt;p>; &quot;Walk across the Xijiang River, pour the Beidou carefully, and treat everything as a guest. &quot;This is the climax of the whole poem, and also the climax of the poet&#39;s emotion. In Volume 8 of &quot;Jingde Chuan Leng Lu&quot;, Mazu said: &quot;The maid drank all the water of the Xijiang River in one gulp.&quot; This is a Zen discourse, which shows that he is open-minded. The Big Dipper is a constellation composed of seven stars, like a long spoon for ladling wine. &quot;The Book of Songs·Xiaoya·Dadong&quot; states: &quot;There is a dipper in Weibei, so you cannot scoop out wine pulp.&quot; Qu Yuan&#39;s &quot;Nine Songs·Dongjun&quot; states the opposite. The meaning is used, &quot;Support the Big Dipper and drink the osmanthus syrup.&quot; The poet is the host, invites all phenomena (all things in the world) to be the guests, scoops out all the water from the Yangtze River in the west, uses the Big Dipper as the wine vessel, and entertains the world with a low drink. All things, what a momentum this is, a person who was slandered and dismissed from office, so confident, so open-minded, really like Li Bai&#39;s words when he said &quot;Whenever the moon comes in the blue sky, I will stop drinking now&quot;, or &quot;I never tire of looking at each other, only Jingting.&quot; The fearless romantic spirit of &quot;Mountain&quot;.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;I don&#39;t know what night it is now.&quot; &quot;Su Shi&#39;s &quot;Qian Chibi Ode&quot; has the words &quot;sing along the side of the ship&quot;, while Zhang Xiaoxiang raps on the edge of the boat, looks up to the sky and roars, expressing his full of pride. Inspired by Su Shi&#39;s &quot;Niannujiao·Mid-Autumn Festival&quot;: &quot;I&#39;m drunk and clapping my hands. Sing wildly, raise a glass to the moon, and become three guests facing each other. In the image of &quot;dancing and wandering under the wind and dew, I don&#39;t know what night it is tonight&quot;, Zhang Xiaoxiang concluded with &quot;I don&#39;t know what night it is today&quot;, returning to himself from the autumn moon and autumn water, buckling the side is the movement, and the solo whistle is the sound. From a spatial perspective, it is the vastness of the Dongting. From the perspective of time, it is from the beginning of this evening to the steady state; from the psychological perspective, it is from knowing to not knowing. Through comparison, it shows that the poet has forgotten his feelings on this white moon and windless night, and has forgotten his feelings in blending with nature. Among them.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; This poem is full of emotions in the scene, the writing style is majestic, and the realm is broad. It shows the author&#39;s open mind and grandeur, and shows the author&#39;s noble quality. Therefore, Wei Liaoweng, a scholar of the Southern Song Dynasty, It is believed that: &quot;Zhang Yuhu has a heroic appearance... Dongting&#39;s gifts are the most outstanding among them.&quot; &quot;This poem has always been praised by people, and because of the unique artistic conception he created in the poem, which embodies the concept of the unity of nature and man, it has been valued by future generations.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In general: the night is deeper, A man rows a small boat on the vast Dongting Lake. He is the only one in the world. &quot;Both the outside and the inside are clear.&quot; My liver and lungs are all ice and snow.&quot; During my tenure, I had no regrets in my heart, so I dealt with the past. Don&#39;t think about the infinite things outside your body, and you will only have a limited cup during your lifetime. &quot;Watch the Xijiang River, pour the Beidou carefully, and everything is a guest.&quot; - Xijiang Water is used as wine, the Big Dipper is used as a cup, and all things in the world are invited to be guests, toasting and drinking. The roar of the boat will dissipate all the depression in the heart into nothingness. Its majestic momentum makes people feel cheerful immediately.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Zhang Xiaoxiang&#39;s poems are inspired by Su Shi and Xin Qiji. He is one of the representatives of the bold and unrestrained style of poetry in the Southern Song Dynasty. In this poem, the upper part mainly describes the scenery, embodying emotions in the scene; the lower part focuses on lyricism and passionate meaning. . The emotions are seen in the scenery throughout the article, the writing style is majestic, and the realm is broad, showing the author&#39;s open mind and grandeur, showing the author&#39;s noble quality. Therefore, Wei Liaoweng, a scholar in the Southern Song Dynasty, believes: &quot;Zhang Yuhu has a heroic appearance...Dongting The endowment, in the concentration is the most Jet. &quot;This poem has always been praised by people, and because of the unique artistic conception he created in the poem, which embodies the concept of the unity of nature and man, it has been valued by future generations.

A small boat sails slowly from the west where the sun sets. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Notes&lt;/strong>;&lt;br />;Tianmen Mountain: Located on both sides of the Yangtze River in He County, Anhui Province and Wuhu, the one in the north of the Yangtze River is called Xiliang Mountain, and the one in the south of the Yangtze River is called Dongliang Mountain (also known as Dongliang Mountain in ancient times) Bowang Mountain). The two mountains face each other across the river, forming a natural portal, hence the name Tianmen. &lt;br />;Interruption: The river separates the two mountains. &lt;br />;Chujiang: the Yangtze River. Because the middle reaches of the Yangtze River belonged to the Chu State in ancient times, it was called Chujiang. Open: split, break. &lt;br />;At this point: It means that the river flowing eastward turns northward here. One is &quot;Zhibei&quot;. Hui: whirlpool, turn around. It means that the direction of the river in this section has changed due to the steep terrain, and it has become more turbulent. &lt;br />;The green mountains on both sides of the Taiwan Strait refer to Dongliang Mountain and Xiliang Mountain respectively. Out: to stand out, to appear. &lt;br />;Coming from the Sun: Refers to the lone boat coming from the distance where the sky and water meet. Looking from a distance, it seems as if it is coming from the Sun. &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;Appreciation&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;p>; This poem describes clear water, green mountains, white sails and red sun, which form a colorful picture. But this picture is not static, but flowing. As the poet rows, the mountains break, the river opens, the eastward water flows back, the green mountains face each other, the lone sail sails towards the sun, and the scenery unfolds from far to near and then to far. Six verbs are used in the poem: &quot;break, open, flow, return, come out, come&quot;. The landscape and scenery present an exciting dynamic, depicting the majesty and vastness of the Tianmen Mountain area. The first and second sentences describe the majestic, precipitous and unstoppable momentum of the Tianmen landscape, giving people a thrilling feeling; the third and fourth sentences also vividly describe the vast and vast water potential. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;The Tianmen interrupts the opening of the Chu River, and the clear water flows eastward here.&quot; These two lines describe the poet&#39;s view of the confrontation between the Tianmen Mountain and the river. The river passes through the Tianmen Mountain, and the water is rushing and swirling. The first sentence closely follows the title, always writing about Tianmen Mountain, and emphasizing the majestic momentum of the mighty Chu River flowing eastward, rushing through Tianmen Mountain. It gives people rich associations: the two mountains of Tianmen were originally a whole, blocking the raging river. Due to the impact of the raging waves of the Chu River, the &quot;Tianmen&quot; was opened, interrupting it and forming two mountains, the east and west. This is quite similar to the scene described by the author in &quot;Song of Yuntai in Xiyue to Danqiuzi&quot;: &quot;The giant spirit (river god) roared and smashed the two mountains (referring to Huashan in the west of Hexi and Shouyang in the east), and the torrents sprayed out Shoot at the East China Sea.&quot; But the former is hidden and the latter is revealed. In the author&#39;s writing, Chujiang seems to have become a thing with great vitality, showing the magical power to overcome all obstacles, and Tianmen Mountain seems to have silently made a way for it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The second sentence describes the river water at the foot of Tianmen Mountain, which in turn focuses on the binding force and reaction of Tianmen Mountain, which is in confrontation with Jiajiang River, on the surging Chu River. Due to the confrontation between the two mountains, when the vast Yangtze River flows through the narrow channel between the two mountains, it stirs up swirls and forms a spectacle of turbulent waves. If the previous sentence uses the power of the mountains to describe the turbulence of the water, then this sentence uses the power of the water to express the strange dangers of the mountains. In some books, &quot;back to this point&quot; is called &quot;back to the north&quot;. Interpreters think it means that the east-flowing Yangtze River turns north at this point. This may be called a detailed explanation of the flow of the Yangtze River, but it is not poetry, and it cannot express the strange and dangerous momentum of Tianmen. It can be compared with &quot;Xiyue Yuntai Song Farewell to Dan Qiuzi&quot;: &quot;How majestic the Xiyue Mountains are! The Yellow River comes from the sky like silk. The Yellow River touches the mountains for thousands of miles, and the vortex hub turns to the Qin land mines.&quot; &quot;The vortex hub turns around&quot; is also called &quot;Blue Water East&quot; &quot;Flow back here&quot; also describes the scene when a thousand-mile river is blocked by towering and dangerous mountains, but as a seven-character ancient poem, it is written vividly. From the comparison, we can see that &quot;Wangtianmen Mountain&quot; as a quatrain advocates simplicity and implicitness. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;The green mountains on both sides of the strait face each other, and the lone sail comes from the sun.&quot; These two sentences are an inseparable whole. The third sentence follows the first sentence and describes the majesty of the Tianmen Mountains seen in the gaze; the fourth sentence follows the previous sentence and writes the distant view of the Yangtze River, reminding the foothold of &quot;looking&quot; and expressing the poet&#39;s vivid excitement. The poet is not standing somewhere on the shore looking at Tianmen Mountain in the distance. The point of his &quot;looking&quot; is the &quot;lone sail&quot; coming from the &quot;sunside&quot;. Most people who read this poem appreciate the word &quot;chu&quot; in &quot;The green mountains on both sides of the Taiwan Strait come out relative to each other&quot; because it brings dynamic beauty to the originally motionless mountain belt, but few consider why the poet feels &quot;relatively out&quot;. . If you are standing on a fixed footing on the shore and &quot;looking at Tianmen Mountain&quot;, it will probably only produce a static feeling of &quot;green mountains on both sides of the strait facing each other&quot;. On the contrary, when the boat is sailing on the river and going down the river, when the two mountains of Tianmen in the distance come into view and their figures become clearer and clearer, the feeling of &quot;green mountains on both sides of the bank facing each other&quot; is very prominent. The word &quot;out&quot; not only vividly expresses the unique posture of Tianmen Mountain when &quot;looking at Tianmen Mountain&quot; during the boat trip, but also contains the fresh joy of the people in the boat. Tianmen Mountain, which faces the Jiajiang River, seems to be approaching him, expressing its welcome to visitors on the river. Since Qingshan is so affectionate to distant visitors, the distant visitors should be even more delighted. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;The solitary sail comes with the sun&quot; vividly depicts the scene of the solitary sail riding the wind and waves, getting closer and closer to Tianmen Mountain, and the poet&#39;s admiration for the famous mountain scenery and the longing for it. Since the last sentence in the narrative is full of the poet&#39;s passion, this poem not only depicts the majestic scenery of Tianmen Mountain, but also highlights the poet&#39;s heroic, unrestrained, free and unrestrained self-image. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; This poem has a broad artistic conception, heroic spirit, harmonious and smooth syllables, vivid and vivid language, and bright pictures. Although there are only four short sentences and twenty-eight words, the artistic conception it constitutes is beautiful and magnificent, and people feel like they are immersed in it when they read the poem. The poet leads the readers&#39; vision along the vast Yangtze River to the infinitely vast world, making people suddenly feel that their minds are broadened and their horizons are expanded. From the poem, we can see the poet Li Bai&#39;s bold and uninhibited spirit and his broad mind that is unwilling to limit himself to a small world. &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;Creative background&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>; &quot;Looking at Tianmen Mountain&quot; was written in 725 AD (the thirteenth year of Kaiyuan) when Li Bai first left Bashu and took a boat to Jiangdong via Dangtu (now Anhui) On the way to Tianmen Mountain, I made this with my thoughts when I saw Tianmen Mountain for the first time. &lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;Artistic Features&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;p>; &lt;strong>;The word &quot;Wang&quot; dominates the whole poem&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; This is a poem about the scenery of the river. , titled &quot;Looking at Tianmen Mountain&quot;, it can be seen that the scenery of Tianmen Mountain as the object of description is derived from the poet&#39;s &quot;looking&quot; in the boat. The whole poem unfolds under the guidance of the word &quot;Wang&quot;. The mountain shape and water color of &quot;Tianmen&quot; merge into one, and the majestic and majestic scene is fully displayed. The poet was on the boat, looking at the green mountains on both sides of the strait. He had the illusion that the boat was stationary but the mountains were moving, so he wrote the beautiful line &quot;the green mountains on both sides of the strait come out relative to each other&quot;. It seems that the green mountains are sentimental, and they happily set out to welcome the lonely sail from afar, which is quite interesting. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>;Landscapes set off each other&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The mountains and rivers in the poem are closely related and set off each other. The mighty Chu River seems to have &quot;opened&quot; the &quot;Tianmen&quot;, and the &quot;interruption of the Tianmen&quot; allows the Chu River to rush out. The two peaks of Tianmen cross the Chu River, and the Chu River flows through Tianmen. The mountains stand on the water, the water flows out of the mountains, and the mountains and rivers are connected, creating a spectacular scene. The &quot;blue water flowing eastward&quot; is contained by the mountain peaks, so it turns around when it reaches the Tianmen. The mountains are opened by the water, and the water is the mountain loop. They restrict each other and merge into one. The &quot;green mountains on both sides of the strait&quot; &quot;facing each other&quot; and the &quot;lone sail&quot; in the water are combined point by point, and the movement and stillness contrast, forming a complete and moving picture. Looking through the whole poem, the mountains, shapes and water potentials are either combined or written separately, mentioned explicitly or implicitly. They are closely related and reflect each other, showing an extremely grand and spectacular scene. &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;About the author&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;div>;&lt;center>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://song.gushiwen.cn/authorImg/libai.jpg&quot; width=50 %>;&lt;/center>;&lt;/div>;Li Bai (701-762), also known as Taibai, also known as Qinglian Jushi, also known as &quot;The Exiled Immortal&quot;, was a great romantic poet in the Tang Dynasty and was hailed as the &quot;Poetry Immortal&quot; by later generations. &quot;, together with Du Fu are called &quot;Li Du&quot;.
