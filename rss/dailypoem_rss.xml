I stood up and saw that the Big Dipper had tilted sideways. &lt;br />;Will there be no New Year&#39;s Eve next year? I&#39;m just afraid that my worries will go wrong again. &lt;br />;Trying to cherish this night, young people can still boast of their spirit. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Notes&lt;br />;&lt;/strong>;End: It’s almost over. &lt;br />;呑(hè): valley. &lt;br />;Scaling: refers to the body of a long snake. &lt;br />;Qiang (qiǎng): reluctantly. &lt;br />;Wow: one means &quot;noisy&quot;. &lt;br />;Lao (zhuā): hit, beat, here refers to the sound of drums. &lt;br />;Dengji (jìn): lamp flower. Embers are the remaining parts of an object after burning. &lt;br />;Beidou Xian: It means it is midnight. &lt;br />;Waste (cuō tuó): Time passes in vain, time is wasted. &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;Creative background&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>; This poem was written in the seventh year of Renzong Jiayou&#39;s reign (1062). &quot;Farewell&quot;, three poems sent to Su Che. &lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;Appreciation&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;p>; &quot;Shou Sui&quot; has sixteen sentences, which can be divided into three levels. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The first level has six sentences: &quot;If you want to know that you are dying at the end of your life, it is like going to a snake. The scales are half gone, who can cover up the intention? If you want to tie it to its tail, you can do nothing even if you work hard. &quot;A vivid metaphor is used here to illustrate the futility of staying up late, and the topic is approached from the negative side, which is different from the previous two poems. This metaphor is not only vivid, but also shows that the dragon and the snake are the same, and the snake is used to compare the years. It is not a general metaphor. The first four of these six sentences are about the year approaching, and the last two sentences are about trying to save the situation, but it is in vain. Although the literal meaning of &quot;tying its tail&quot; is from &quot;Jin Shu·Jia Hou Zhuan&quot; &quot;tying a dog to its neck, now it is tied to its tail&quot;, in the text, it is completely used as a metaphor of &quot;going to kill a snake&quot;: By New Year&#39;s Eve, it is already It’s impossible to pull out the snake upside down since it’s distal end. What’s more, if you only grasp the end of the snake’s tail, how can you tie it? Starting with these six sentences seems to say that this custom is unreasonable. If you want to write about keeping the New Year&#39;s Eve, you should first write that you can&#39;t keep it, and you don&#39;t have to keep it. This is a trick of playing hard to get and making the text more complicated. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The middle six sentences are the second level: &quot;Children are forced not to sleep, and they stay together all night chatting. Don&#39;t sing the rooster in the morning, for the drums are more tiring. When you sit for a long time, the lamp embers are falling, and you watch the Big Dipper diagonally. .&quot; This level describes the scene of staying up late on New Year&#39;s Eve. The word &quot;strong&quot; describes the characteristics of children celebrating New Year&#39;s Eve: they obviously want to doze off, but they still have to force themselves to have fun. These two sentences are still the author&#39;s recollection of the customs of his hometown, not the scene when he was in Fengxiang. Su Shi was only twenty-six years old that year (his age was twenty-seven), and he had only one son, Su Mai, who was five years old. The scene described in these two sentences could not have happened. The two sentences &quot;morning chicken&quot; describe the psychological state of staying up late at night in detail, and the two lines &quot;sitting for a long time&quot; describe the scene of staying up late at night very realistically. These two sentences are mainly aimed at adults staying up late on the New Year&#39;s Eve. Ji Yun admired these ten words very much and said they were &quot;real scenes&quot;. In fact, this is a feeling that everyone has experienced. He was able to write it down effortlessly, adding a lot of intimacy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The last four sentences are the third level: &quot;Will there be no year next year? I&#39;m afraid it will be wasted. If you work hard today, you can still be proud of the young man.&quot; This level contrasts with the hard-to-get game of the first level at the beginning, which shows that It makes sense to stay up late and cherish the passing time. Confess positively that you should stay up until the end of New Year&#39;s Eve. The last two sentences use Bai Juyi&#39;s &quot;still exaggerated youthfulness&quot; to encourage Su Che. Su Che served his father in the capital, and Su Shi hoped that the two places would stay together and cherish the years together. This conclusion contains a positive and energetic meaning and is the finishing touch, which suddenly lifts the spirit of the whole poem. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Su Shi&#39;s &quot;Shou Sui&quot; is poetic and easy to understand, aiming to encourage oneself to cherish time like gold. The author uses the image of a snake shedding its skin as a metaphor for not being able to waste time, implying that we must seize the time to do things from beginning to end, lest the time will be over half, and no matter how hard we work, it will be difficult to make up for it. Efforts should start today and don’t let your ambitions go to waste. &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;About the author&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;div>;&lt;center>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://song.gushiwen.cn/authorImg/sushi.jpg&quot; width=50 %>;&lt;/center>;&lt;/div>;Su Shi, (January 8, 1037 - August 24, 1101), courtesy name Zizhan and Hezhong, also known as Tieguan Taoist and Dongpo layman, was known as Su Dongpo and Su Xian in the world.

If you want to stay in the wrong place, try to merge into the old nest. There is also a Diaoliang caisson. Also soft-spoken and indecisive. The floating flowers are blowing quickly, and the green tail separates the red shadow. &lt;br />;Fragrant path. Celery mud is moistened by rain. They love to stick to the ground and fight to fly, competing to praise their beauty. Returning to the Red Mansion late, I can see the dim willow trees and dim flowers. You should live in a stable and fragrant environment. Then I forgot, Tianya Fangxin. Worried about the loss of the two moths of Cuidai, I draw alone every day. &lt;/div>;&lt;h3>;Translation and annotations&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Translation&lt;/strong>;&lt;br />;Spring Society Day has just passed, and you are flying through the curtains of the pavilion. The beams were covered with dust from the old year and were deserted. I parted my wings and wanted to stop, and then I tried to get into the old nest and sleep together. He looked curiously at the Diaoliang caisson, and murmured softly to discuss it. Suddenly, it floats up and passes over the flower tips, and the cut green tail cuts through the red flower shadow. &lt;br />;The aroma fills the path, and the spring rain melts the celery mud. They like to stick to the ground and compete with each other, as if they are competing to see who is more handsome and light. It was getting late when I returned to the Red Mansion, and I had seen enough of the shadows of willow branches and flowers in the dim light. But I only cared about resting safely in my nest, and I forgot to read the letter from the wanderer from the end of the world. This makes the haggard beauty in the boudoir very sad. She looks through her eyes and draws fences every day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Notes&lt;/strong>;&lt;br />;Chunshe: A social day in ancient spring to worship the Earth God. On the fifth Wu day after the beginning of spring. &lt;br />;Degree: through. Curtain: In ancient times, wealthy people hung many curtains in their courtyards. &lt;br />;Cī Chi: When swallows fly, they fly first and then later, with the tail fins stretched. &quot;The Book of Songs·Beifeng·Yanyan&quot;: &quot;The swallow is flying, but its feathers are incomparable.&quot;&lt;br />;Phase (xiàng): look at it, look carefully. Carved beams: roof beams with carved or painted patterns. Caijing: A ceiling decorated with colorful patterns, shaped like a well railing, so it is called a caisson. &lt;br />;Soft words: the murmuring of swallows. &lt;br />;Cuiwei: green swallowtail. Red shadow: flower shadow. &lt;br />;Fragrant Path: a path with flowers and grass. &lt;br />;Celery mud: the soil where celery grows near the water. &lt;br />;Red Mansion: The residence of wealthy people. &lt;br />;The willows are dim and the flowers are dim. Ming: The sky is dim. &lt;br />;Qixiang: The habitat is sweet and sleeps well. &lt;br />;Tianya Fangxin: Deliver letters from far away to your loved ones. In ancient times, there was a saying about Shuangyan passing down letters. &lt;br />;Cuidai Shuangmo: refers to the young woman in the boudoir. &lt;br />;Dai moth: Luozi Dai is the pigment used by women to paint their eyebrows. Its color is blue and black, or it can be used to replace eyebrows. The eyebrows are as thin as moth whiskers, which are called moth eyebrows. Some even use eyebrows to refer to beauty. &lt;br />;Painting: carved railing. Ping: rely on. &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;Appreciation&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;p>; Swallow is a commonly used image in ancient poetry, such as poems by Du Fu, poems such as Yan Shu, etc. However, the beauty of swallows is that the whole poem in classical poetry As for lyrics, the first one to recommend is &quot;Shuang Shuang Yan&quot; by Shi Dazu. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The description of swallows in this poem is extremely wonderful. The word &quot;Yan&quot; does not appear in the whole article, but every sentence is written about &quot;Yan&quot;, which is extremely beautiful and full of beauty. And it doesn’t feel complicated. &quot;It&#39;s time to celebrate the Spring Festival&quot;, &quot;Spring Club&quot; is around the vernal equinox, which is the season when spring flowers bloom. According to legend, swallows return from the south to the north at this time. The poet only points out the festival time, so that readers can naturally think of the return of swallows. The wonderful thing here is that there is a hint of preparedness for a rainy day, which not only saves words, but also makes the poem implicit and implicit, mobilizing the reader&#39;s imagination. &quot;In the middle of the curtain&quot; further hints at the return of the swallow. &quot;Last year the dust was cold&quot; implies the return of the old Yan and new changes. In the beautiful spring scenery of nature, the swallows returning from the north fly into the curtain of their old home. The red mansions and the carved beams and caissons are still the same, but the difference is that there is no one in the empty house and the eyes are full of dust, which inevitably makes the swallows feel a little desolate and desolate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The four sentences &quot;I want to live in the wrong place&quot; describe the scene of Shuangyan wanting to live but hesitating. Because it has been some time since the swallows left their old nests, and the &quot;last year was cold and dusty&quot;, there seems to be some changes, so they must first &quot;walk&quot; between the curtains and &quot;experience&quot; them to take a closer look at the familiar environment. After all, the swallows were nostalgic for the old nest, so they &quot;wanted to live in the wrong place and tried to merge with the old nest.&quot; Because he &quot;wanted to live in it&quot; and &quot;tried it in&quot;, he was hesitant, so he looked at the &quot;Diaoliang Caojing&quot; carefully and &quot;weakly discussed it&quot;. The little love story is written in a delicate and tortuous way, like a young couple spending their time at home, which is quite interesting. Shen Jifei commented on these lines and said: &quot;The words &#39;desire&#39;, &#39;test&#39;, &#39;huan&#39;, and &#39;you&#39; are wonderful.&quot; (&quot;The Complete Collection of Caotang Poems&quot;) The beauty lies in these four empty characters. Layer by layer, Shuangyan&#39;s psychological and emotional changes are conveyed vividly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;The soft words are undecidable&quot; describes Yan&#39;s murmuring, which is very expressive and wonderful. &quot;Undecided&quot; expresses Shuangyan&#39;s intimate discussion with one sentence for you and one for me. &quot;Soft Words&quot;, with its soft and gentle voice and vivid image of tenderness, depicts the two swallows as a couple full of tenderness and affection. People often use swallows to describe a couple, and this description is very suitable for the characteristics of the swallow couple. Perhaps it was inspired by the wonderful writing of poems! Sure enough, as a result of the &quot;discussion&quot;, the Yan couple decided to settle down here. As a result, they &quot;floated quickly, their green tails separated their red shadows,&quot; and began a busy, tense and happy new life in the beautiful spring scenery. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;The path is fragrant, and the celery mud is moist with rain.&quot; Purple swallows often use celery mud to build their nests. Precisely because the weather here is smooth and the celery mud is particularly moist, it is really a good place to settle down and set up a business. The swallows are in the right place, and both are happy. Soaring down from the sky and flying close to the ground, you chase each other, as if competing to see who can fly more lightly and beautifully. The vast and fertile north is far more than just qinni. There are flowers, willows, everything here, and the scenery is endless. The swallow was intoxicated, flying around for sightseeing, playing until dark before flying back. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;When I return home late from the Red Mansion, I can see the willows dim and dim.&quot; The spring scenery is so beautiful, and their lives are so happy, free, and perfect. Returning in the evening, living and breathing in both places, it is endless fun. However, with this joy, &quot;I forgot about the wonderful news from the end of the world.&quot; Before Shuangyan returned, a wanderer from the far end of the world asked them to bring back a letter to his family, but they all forgot about it! This sudden stroke of fortune was unexpected. With this turning point, the scene of a missing woman in a red building leaning on the railing and gazing out appeared: &quot;Sorrowful about the loss of the emerald green moths, I draw the railing alone every day.&quot; Because of Shuangyan&#39;s negligence, the recipient was sad and disappointed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; These last two sentences seem to have left the swallows chanted throughout the article and turned to writing about the missing wife in the Red Mansion. It seems to be off topic, but it is not. This is the originality of the poet. Just imagine why the poet spent so much pen and ink describing the swallows lingering in the old nest, wanting to stay but still resting? For Yanzi, he felt the new change of &quot;last year&#39;s cold dust&quot;. In fact, this was a personnel change that suggested that people left the world and became lonely in the boudoir, but it was never revealed. At the end, the meaning is pushed aside a layer, and it blends into the boudoir feeling and has a lingering charm. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; It turns out that when the poet described the two swallows, he intended to write them in the cold environment of the Red Mansion, where he misses his wife and misses his spring. He uses the happy life of the two swallows inseparable, secretly and thinking He contrasts the lonely life of the woman who is &quot;alone with the painting fence&quot;; then he writes about a pair of swallows enjoying the beautiful scenery of nature, secretly contrasting it with the fate of the missing woman who is &quot;sorrowful about the loss of the two moths.&quot; Obviously, the author&#39;s description of Yanzi&#39;s free, happy and happy life implies some kind of emotion and sustenance of life. This writing method breaks the convention of writing about people as the main subject in the theme structure of Song Dynasty poems, and writes about Yan as the main subject and people as the guest; writing about the sorrow of the missing woman in the Red Mansion is just to contrast the happy life of Shuang Yan, giving people a refreshing feeling. Readers will naturally think of human tragedy from Yan&#39;s happiness, but the author intentionally leaves it to the readers to experience it themselves. This kind of writing is full of charm because of the extra twists and turns, so it can reflect life more implicitly and profoundly, which is really unique. However, when writing about swallows and people, they are in contrast to each other and are closely connected, neither inseparable nor inseparable. This is indeed a desperate situation in the poem about swallows. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; As a poem about things, &quot;Two Swallows&quot; has received the highest praise from its predecessors. Wang Shizhen said: &quot;To this point in chanting things, man&#39;s ingenuity is extremely ingenious!&quot; (&quot;Flowers and Grass&quot;) This poem successfully portrays the beautiful image of swallows living and sleeping in love and admiration. While personifying swallows, Describing their movements and expressions, and striving to match the characteristics of swallows in every aspect, to the point where they are similar in form and spirit, the swallows are really brought to life. For example, the same story depicts the flight of swallows, with several different postures. &quot;Floating quickly, brushing the flower tips, and the green tail separates the red shadow&quot; describes the situation of swallows catching insects in flight and passing by the branches of flowers and trees. &quot;Piaoran&quot; not only expresses the lightness of the swallow, but it is not flying aimlessly in the sky, but hunting for food, so it is also said to be &quot;quickly flying to spend money&quot;. Precisely because swallows fly lightly and are small in size, when they fly, their green tail is like an open pair of scissors passing over the &quot;flower tips&quot;, as if &quot;parting the red shadow&quot;. &quot;Love to stick to the ground and fight to fly&quot; is another unique flying posture of swallows. When the sky is cloudy and it is about to rain, swallows fly very low. It can be seen that the poet&#39;s observation of swallows is extremely delicate and his words are very precise. The poem describes the habit of swallows chewing mud to build nests, and the soft whispering sounds, both of which are unflattering. &quot;Curtain&quot;, &quot;Carved beam caisson&quot;, &quot;Fragrant path&quot;, &quot;Qinniyu moistening&quot;, etc. are also common examples of describing swallows in poetry. &quot;Cai Chi wants to live&quot;, the word &quot;Cai Chi&quot; originally comes from &quot;The Book of Songs·Beifeng·Yanyan&quot;: &quot;Yanyan is flying, and it is a waste of its feathers.&quot; &quot;Qinni is moistened by rain&quot;, &quot;Qinni&quot; comes from Du Fu&#39;s &quot;Xu Bu&quot; &quot;Poetry: &quot;The celery mud follows the swallow&#39;s mouth.&quot; &quot;Then I forgot about the fragrant letter from the end of the world&quot; is an adaptation of the poetic meaning of &quot;Miscellaneous Poems: Pretending Captain Li to Join the Army&quot; by Jiang Yan of the Liang Dynasty in the Southern Dynasty, &quot;But I am thousands of miles away, and my hair is knotted and I don&#39;t see each other; I have short sleeves, and I would like to send two flying swallows.&quot; Shuangyan forgot to send a book to write. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; This poem depicts the two swallows, and has the merits of Huan Qi Jingmai. It is worthy of being a top-notch poem about things. As for seeking a deeper metaphor, there is no such thing. Some commentators believe that the four sentences &quot;Returning to the Red Mansion at Night&quot; have an overtone metaphor for the events of Han Guanzhou. Although an explanation can be prepared, it will inevitably go too deep, which will damage the story. The first poem has a profound and detailed rhythm. &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;About the author&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;div>;&lt;center>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://song.gushiwen.cn/authorImg/shidazu.jpg&quot; width=50 %>;&lt;/center>;&lt;/div>;Shi Dazu 1163～1220?
