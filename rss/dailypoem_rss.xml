I think people are unscrupulous! &lt;br />;The magpie is strong and the quail is running fast. People are unscrupulous, I think you are the king! &lt;/div>;&lt;h3>;Translation and Notes&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Translation&lt;br />;&lt;/strong>;Quails still fly in pairs, and magpies also fly in pairs. This man is not kind-hearted, why do you think of him as your brother? &lt;br />;Magpies still fly in pairs, and quails fly in pairs. This man has no conscience at all, why treat him as a king? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Notes&lt;br />;&lt;/strong>;鄘(yōng): the name of a vassal state in the Zhou Dynasty of China, located in the north of Ji County in present-day Henan Province. &lt;br />;Quail: The name of the bird, that is, quail. It is as big as a chicken, with a thin head and no tail, and spotted fur. Ben Ben: Jump and run. &lt;br />;Magpie: magpie. Qiang (qiáng): to fly gracefully. Ben Ben and Qiang Qiang both describe the way quails and magpies live with their companions and fly with them. &lt;br />;Unscrupulous: unkind. &lt;br />;Wo: A borrowed word for &quot;He&quot;, the ancient pronunciation of &quot;Wo&quot; and &quot;He&quot; are similar. One is called personal pronoun. &lt;br />;Jun: monarch, a gentleman. &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;Appreciation&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;p>; The whole poem has two chapters, each with four lines, both starting from &quot;the quail&#39;s running&quot; and &quot;the magpie&#39;s strength&quot;. It is said that animals still have fixed spouses, but the behavior of the male protagonist in the poem can be described as decadent and inferior to animals, and he is in vain to be called &quot;brother&quot; and &quot;king&quot;. In the two chapters of the poem, only the words &quot;brother&quot; and &quot;jun&quot; are not repeated. Although the poet dare not not refer to him as &quot;brother&quot; and &quot;jun&quot;, he seems to be gentle and honest, but in fact he uses the words &quot;brother&quot; and &quot;jun&quot;. , is tantamount to verbally criticizing the male protagonist, cutting directly and penetratingly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The author of this poem may be a woman who spurns the man she respects but has bad moral character. This means that quails and magpies know how to stay together and fly together. But this man whom she respected was corrupt, incestuous, and reckless. He was worse than a beast. But she always regarded him as an elder brother and a gentleman. Little did she know that he was not a humble and kind-hearted person, and he was disrespectful and disrespectful, which made her feel very sad. So, in a rage, she wrote a poem to denounce him to relieve her anger. The main theme of this poem should be based on the principle of &quot;women criticize men&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The whole poem uses metaphorical techniques to warn people that quails and magpies still have constant companions to live in, and they have constant companions to fly. However, the &quot;unscrupulous&quot; people in the poem are actually worse than beasts, and the author made a mistake. He treats him like a gentleman. Based on this, the author forms a strong inverse contrast between the feelings and attitudes of &quot;unscrupulous&quot; people and animals towards love and marriage, which strengthens the critical power of the poem. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Although the whole poem only has two chapters and eight sentences, and does not directly provide any objective description of the image of the male protagonist, it can make his image very vivid and prominent. This is rooted in the dramatic and extremely powerful emotional gap constructed by the poetic text. This gap comes from the different attitudes of humans and animals towards opposite-sex spouses. This difference in attitudes creates this huge and disparate inverse contrast. . As a result, the male protagonist&#39;s bad image hits him directly, which is chilling but disgusting. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The first two sentences of the two chapters of the poem are exactly the same, but the position has changed, but it can give people a sense of looping and interlacing. Although the difference between the last two lines of each chapter is only one word, it avoids the monotonous feeling that is easily caused when chanting repeatedly. This should be an important artistic strategy in &quot;The Book of Songs: Guofeng&quot; for this kind of poetry with repeated chapters and lines. &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;Creative background&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>; Ancient and modern scholars mostly believe that the background of this poem is a satirical poem, but there are debates about the satirical object of the poem and the author of the poem. Scholars throughout the ages believed that this poem was written to condemn and satirize the monarch of the Wei Kingdom. Because Xuan Jiang and his son were stubborn, it was not virtuous to accompany him, and most of them were satires of the Wei people, so this poem was written. &quot;Preface to Mao&#39;s Poems&quot; states that this poem was written by &quot;Xuan Jiang of the Wei Dynasty&quot; and said that &quot;the people of Wei thought that Xuan Jiang was inferior to a quail and a magpie.&quot; &lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;About the author&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 29 Sep 2023 04:23:06 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[塞下曲 | 卢纶]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://feedx.net/read?r=shiwen&d=239282]]><description> &lt;h2>;Saixiaqu&lt;/h2>;[Tang Dynasty] Lu Lun&lt;div style=&quot;color: #5b4636;&quot;>;The wild geese fly high in the moonlight, and the Chanyu escapes at night. &lt;br />;I want to chase Qingqi away, but the heavy snow covers my bow and sword. &lt;/div>;&lt;h3>;Translation and annotations&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Translation&lt;/strong>;&lt;br />;In the dead of night, dark clouds cover the moon, and wild geese fly in the sky. Shanyu’s army wants to To escape quietly under the cover of night. &lt;br />;Just as he was about to lead the light cavalry in pursuit, heavy snow fell on his bows and knives. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Notes&lt;/strong>;&lt;br />;Foreign Song: A military song from the ancient frontier fortress. &lt;br />;Dark Moon: No moonlight. &lt;br />;Chan Yu (chán yú): leader of the Huns. This refers to the supreme commander of the invaders. &lt;br />;Escape: escape. &lt;br />;Will: lead. &lt;br />;Light cavalry: light and fast cavalry. &lt;br />;Chasing: chasing. &lt;br />;Man: full. &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;Appreciation&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;p>; &quot;Song under the Fortress&quot; is an old title of Han Dynasty Yuefu and belongs to &quot;Hengchui Songs&quot;. The content is mostly about the frontier fortress. There were originally six poems in total, and Hengtang retired scholars selected four of them. This is the third poem in Lu Lun&#39;s poem &quot;Song under the Sai&quot;. Lu Lun once served as a marshal judge in the shogunate and had experience in military life. His poems describing this kind of life are relatively substantial and vigorous in style. This poem describes the general&#39;s heroic and heroic preparations to lead his troops to chase the enemy on a snowy night. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The poem begins with a description of the scene. &quot;Moonlight and black geese flying high&quot; is not the scene in the eyes, but the scene in the mind. The snowy night and dark moon were not a normal time for wild geese to fly; but the startled flying geese revealed that the enemy was taking action. These five words not only indicate that the time is winter, but also highlight the tense atmosphere before the war. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;Chan Yu fled at night&quot;, the enemy moved at night, not leading troops to attack, but fleeing hastily under the cover of moonlight. The tone of the poem is affirmative, the judgment is clear, and it is full of contempt for the enemy and our army&#39;s belief in victory, which makes readers excited. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The last two sentences describe the scene of the general preparing to chase the enemy, which is extraordinary. &quot;In order to drive the light cavalry away&quot;, the general discovered that the enemy was absconding and wanted to lead the light cavalry to pursue him; not only because the light cavalry was fast, but also showed a high degree of confidence. When the warriors lined up and prepared to set off, a heavy snow began to fall. Although they could not stand for a moment, the bows and knives were covered with snowflakes in an instant. The cold light that obscured their weapons. They are like arrows about to leave the string. Although they have not yet set off, they are full of confidence that they will win. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The last sentence, &quot;The bows and knives are covered with heavy snow&quot; is a description of the severe cold scene, which highlights the hardship of the battle and the brave spirit of the soldiers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Although this poem only has twenty words, it describes the actual situation at that time: Chanyu led his army to flee under the scene of &quot;black moon and wild geese flying high&quot;, and the general was in &quot;heavy snow full of bows and swords&quot;. Prepare to lead the army to attack under extremely cold weather conditions. The escape and pursuit exaggerated the tense atmosphere. Although the poem does not directly describe a fierce battle scene, it leaves readers with a broad imagination and creates an atmosphere of long-lasting meaning in the poem. &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;Creative background&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;p>; When the author wrote this poem, his life and career were extremely difficult. After the Zhusi Rebellion, King Hunyang of Xianning came out of Zhenhezhong and promoted Lu Lun to be the judge of the Marshal&#39;s Mansion. In the military camp, all Lu Lun saw were the majestic and solemn frontier fortress scenes, and all he came into contact with were rugged and heroic soldiers, so he composed this frontier fortress poem. &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;Appreciation 2&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;p>; This is a poem about the guards chasing deserters at night. It is the third poem in Lu Lun&#39;s &quot;Song under the Sai&quot; group. head. This poem is only 20 words long, but it contains a lot of information and inspires readers&#39; endless imagination. The author did not directly describe the battle scene, but by reading the poem, one can completely understand the poetic meaning and enrich the imagination, and draw a picture of the war with both iron and steel. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The poem begins with a description of the scene: &quot;The wild geese fly high in the dark moon.&quot; Such a scene is difficult to describe: if the moon is dark, nothing can be seen; if the geese are flying high, there is no trace to be found. The geese fly high. It is perceived by sound. This kind of scenery is not the scenery in the eyes, but the scenery in the mind. Snowy night and dark moon are not a normal time for wild geese to fly. Su Yan&#39;s frightened flight revealed that the enemy was taking action. These five words not only tell the time, but also heighten the tense atmosphere before the battle, directly forcing the next sentence &quot;Shan Yu escapes at night&quot;. Shanyu was originally the monarch of the ancient Xiongnu, here he refers to the commander-in-chief of the enemy army. There should be every possibility for the enemy to move at night. However, the poet said that &quot;Chan Yu fled at night&quot;. When I read the poem, I suddenly felt a sense of heroism coming over me. When the enemy moves at night, he does not lead his troops to attack, but flees in panic under the cover of night. The tone of the poem is affirmative, the judgment is clear, and it is full of contempt for the enemy and the belief that our army will win. It is enough to excite readers and make them startled in the mysterious atmosphere created by the previous sentence. When the enemy chief fled, our army sent troops to pursue him. This was a natural development. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Three or four sentences describe the situation of our own army preparing to pursue, showing the mighty spirit of the soldiers. &quot;I want to chase the Qingqi away&quot; means that the pursuing troops are about to attack but have not yet done so. Not using a large army but only sending &quot;light cavalry&quot; was not only due to speed, but also showed a high degree of self-confidence, as if the enemy was already a turtle in the urn, and only a small number of &quot;light cavalry&quot; were needed to pursue and suppress it, and they could be captured easily. When the warriors lined up to set off. Although he could only stand for a moment. But the heavy snow actually covered the bow and knife. The sentence &quot;The heavy snow is full of bows and knives&quot; is full of surprise and excitement, pushing the artistic conception of the whole poem to a climax. In the vast darkness of night, on the pure white snow, a group of light cavalry was gathering. Snowflakes instantly covered their bodies, covering up the cold light of their weapons. They are like arrows about to leave the string. Although they have not yet set off, they are already full of confidence that they will win. This is a very moving picture: there is a cry in the silence, and there is lightning brewing in the darkness. Although it was a dark night, the heroic figures of the warriors outlined by the white snow were still &quot;eye-catching&quot;. Judging from this poem, Lu Lun is very good at capturing images and opportunities. He can not only capture typical images, but also express them at the most artistically effective moment. The poet does not describe how the army attacks, nor does he tell readers whether it has caught up with the enemy. He only describes a scene of preparations for pursuit, which effectively highlights the atmosphere and emotions at the time. &quot;If you want to drive away the light cavalry, the heavy snow will cover your bow and sword.&quot; This is not the climax of the battle, but the moment approaching the climax. This moment is like an arrow on the string, about to be fired, and it has the most attractive power. Although the results are not explained, it is more enlightening and can arouse readers&#39; imagination and imagination. This is called exhaustive words but endless meaning. The dragon&#39;s head but not its tail does not mean that it has no tail. The tail is looming in the clouds, which is more interesting and charming. &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;About the author&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;div>;&lt;center>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://song.gushiwen.cn/authorImg/lulun.jpg&quot; width=50 %>;&lt;/center>;&lt;/div>;Lulun (739-799), whose courtesy name was Yunyan, was from Puzhou in Hezhong (now Yongji County, Shanxi).
