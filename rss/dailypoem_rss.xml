The teacher said: &quot;Why do you cry, boy?&quot; The original saying is: &quot;A lonely person is easily hurt, and a poor person is easily affected. Anyone who has learned a book has relatives. One is to hope that he will not be alone, and the other is to envy him to learn. The center I feel sad, so I cry.&quot; The teacher said sympathetically: &quot;I want to write a book!&quot; The original said: &quot;I have no money.&quot; The teacher said: &quot;The boy is ambitious, and I will teach you, and I don&#39;t ask for money.&quot; So he started writing. . During the winter, I recited &quot;The Classic of Filial Piety&quot; and &quot;The Analects of Confucius&quot;. &lt;/div>;&lt;h3>;Translation and Notes&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Translation 1&lt;/strong>;&lt;br />;Bing Yuan lost his father when he was young. When he was a few years old, he passed by a book school. He started to cry. The teacher of the book school asked him: &quot;Child, why are you crying?&quot; Bing Yuan replied: &quot;People who have lost their parents are easy to be sad, and poor people are easy to be sentimental. Anyone who can study has parents. Children. The first thing I envy is that they have parents, and the second thing is that they can go to school. I feel very sad inside, so I cried.&quot; After hearing Bing Yuan&#39;s words, the private school teacher sympathized with him and said: &quot;(You) want to study, just go Read it!&quot; Bing Yuan said: &quot;(I) have no money to pay tuition.&quot; The private school teacher then said to him: &quot;If you really have this ambition, I will treat you as my apprentice and won&#39;t charge you tuition.&quot; From then on, Bing Yuan So he entered school to study. After one winter passed, Bing Yuan could memorize &quot;The Classic of Filial Piety&quot; and &quot;The Analects of Confucius&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Notes&lt;/strong>;&lt;br />;Bookhouse: Book School. &lt;br />;Center: In the heart. &lt;br />;Pity: pity, sympathy. &lt;br />;Guoshi: Outstanding talents in the country. &lt;br />;Go to school: start learning. &lt;br />;Why: why. &lt;br />;Shaogu: Lost his father when he was young. &lt;br />;Go to school: go to a private school (study). &lt;br />;Orphan: Lost parents in childhood. &lt;br />;Pao: pass by. &lt;br />;Cry: cry quietly. &lt;br />;Compassion: Sadness in the heart. &lt;br />;Parents: parents. &lt;br />;Envy: envy. &lt;br />;It: they refer to the students in the library. &lt;br />;De: able. &lt;br />;Center: In the heart&lt;br />;Sense: Sadness. &lt;br />;Injury: sadness. &lt;br />;Gou: If, if. &lt;br />;Wish: admire. &lt;br />;Book: Study. &lt;br />;Apprentice: Free, here means no charge. &lt;br />;Capital: expenses. &lt;br />;Sui: Just do it. &lt;br />;Pu: Finally. &lt;br />;Chan: recite. &lt;br />;Jiu: close, here refers to studying, that is, going to school. &lt;br />;Fan: Anything. &lt;br />;With: use. &lt;br />;So: reason; reason. &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;Inspiration&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;We must be eager to learn and cherish our hard-won opportunities to study. &lt;br />;You should also learn from teachers in the text, selflessly help others in their studies, and respect people who love learning and have ambitions. &lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;Introduction&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;p>; Bing Yuan, a native of the Three Kingdoms period, was a famous scholar and celebrity at that time. Together with Guan Ning and Hua Xin, he was known as the &quot;Three Heroes of Liaodong&quot;. Although he lost his father at a young age and lived in extreme poverty, he still determined to learn cultural knowledge. He eventually moved the teachers in the school and created a good story about learning and teaching. The word &quot;cry&quot; expresses Bingyuan&#39;s strong desire to study. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; This article uses a sequential narrative to explain how Bingyuan, a young boy from a poor family, cried out to study. After getting the opportunity to go to school, he studied hard and was able to recite two classics proficiently in just one winter. Clearly, the image of a young child who is determined to study and has achieved outstanding results stands before us vividly. The article adopts touching dialogue descriptions and focuses on describing the process of Bing Yuan&#39;s weeping studies.

An official, thinker, and writer of the Ming Dynasty, he was a master of the Taizhou School. Li Zhi&#39;s first surname was Lin, and his given name was Zai Zhi. Later, he changed his surname to Li, his given name was Zhi, his courtesy name was Hongfu, his nickname was Zhuowu, and his nicknames were Wenling Jushi, Baiquan Jushi, etc. During the Li Gongcheng period, he was a doctor of Imperial College, and during Wanli period he was the prefect of Yao&#39;an. He abandoned his official position and settled in Huang&#39;an (now Hong&#39;an County, Hubei Province) and Zhifo Temple in Macheng, Hubei Province. When he was giving lectures in Macheng, there were thousands of followers, including many women. In his later years, he traveled between Beijing and the South, and was eventually falsely accused and imprisoned. He committed suicide in prison. His important works include &quot;Collection of Books&quot;, &quot;Extension of Collection of Books&quot;, &quot;Book Burning&quot;, &quot;Extension of Book Burning&quot;, and &quot;Review of the Historical Outline&quot;. He has commented on &quot;Water Margin&quot;, &quot;The Romance of the West Chamber&quot;, &quot;The Story of Huan Sha&quot;, &quot;Moon Worship Pavilion&quot;, etc., which are still popular today. &lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https:/ /feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br >;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 03 Nov 2023 04:23:06 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[两小儿辩日 | 列子]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://feedx.net/read?r=shiwen&d=231122]]><description> &lt;h2>;Two children arguing on the day&lt;/h2>;[Pre-Qin] Liezi&lt;div style=&quot;color: #5b4636;&quot;>;Confucius traveled eastward and saw two children arguing and asked why. (Part 1 of Debate: Debating the Sun)&lt;br />;Yi&#39;er said: &quot;When the sun begins to rise, people are near, but when the sun is at midday, people are far away.&quot; &lt;br />;Yi&#39;er said: &quot;I think when the sun begins to rise, people are far away. And when the sun is noon, it is close.&quot;&lt;br />;One son said: &quot;At the beginning of the sun, it is as big as a car hood, and at noon, it is like a pan. Isn&#39;t this why the far ones are small and the near ones are big?&quot;&lt;br />;1 The son said: &quot;At the beginning of the day, it is cool in Cangcang, and in the middle of the day, it is like exploring the soup. Isn&#39;t it hot when you are near, and cool when you are far?&quot;&lt;br />;Confucius couldn&#39;t decide. &lt;br />;The two children laughed and said: &quot;Who knows more about you?&quot; &lt;/div>;&lt;h3>;Translation and Notes&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Translation&lt;/strong>;&lt;br />; Confucius traveled eastward and saw two children arguing. He asked them the reason for their argument. &lt;br />;A child said: &quot;I think the sun is close to people when it just rises, but it is far away from people at noon.&quot;&lt;br />;Another child said: &quot;I think when the sun just rises, it is far away from people. It is far away from people, but it is closer to people at noon.&quot;&lt;br />;A child said: &quot;When the sun first rises, it is as big as the hood of a car, but by noon it is as small as a plate. This is not far away. Is it true that the small is near the big?&quot;&lt;br />;Another child said: &quot;It&#39;s cool when the sun first comes out, but at noon it&#39;s as hot as putting your hand into hot water. Do you think it’s cool?”&lt;br />;After hearing this, Confucius couldn’t judge who was right and who was wrong. &lt;br />;The two children smiled and said to Confucius: &quot;Who said you are wise?&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Notes&lt;/strong>;&lt;br />;East: the east. &lt;br />;Travel: travel, study tour. &lt;br />;See: see. &lt;br />;Baidu: Debate, argue.&lt;br />;Baidu: Fight. &lt;br />;Its: pronoun, they. &lt;br />;Gru: reason, reason. &lt;br />;With: think. &lt;br />;Shi: Just now, just now. &lt;br />;Go: away; distance. &lt;br />;Sunday: noon. &lt;br />;At the beginning: just now. &lt;br />;Car hood: The hood on the car in ancient times was round like an umbrella. &lt;br />;And: to. &lt;br />;Then: Just. &lt;br />;Pan Yu: A container for holding things. The round one is called a plate, and the square one is called a bowl. &lt;br />;For: Yes. &lt;br />;Cangcang Liangliang: describes the feeling of coolness. Cangcang: means cold. &lt;br />;Exploring the soup: Put your hand into the hot water. Soup, hot water, boiling water. (In ancient times, it also specifically referred to hot water for bathing.) In the text, it means that the weather is very hot. &lt;br />;Jue: decision, judgment, judgment. &lt;br />;Which: Who. &lt;br />;For: same as &quot;predicate&quot;, say, think. &lt;br />;Ru: You. &lt;br />;Zhi: zhì, Tongjiazi. &quot;Zhi&quot; is connected with &quot;Zhi&quot;, which means &quot;cleverness&quot; and &quot;wisdom&quot;. &lt;br />;Laughing: This is not a mockery, it highlights the innocence and cuteness of the children&lt;br />;Cangcang Liangliang: Describes cool and slightly chilly. &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;Brief description&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;p>; From the center of the sun to a fixed point on the earth&#39;s surface, the distance is definitely longer in the morning and shorter at noon. It&#39;s just that this change in distance is not enough to cause it to be hot at noon and cool in the morning. Hot at noon and cool in the morning is caused by the angle of incidence of the sun, which is not the truth mentioned in &quot;Two Children Debating the Sun&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; This article is a fable. The article describes that in ancient times, two children relied on their own intuition. One believed that the sun was close to people in the morning, and the other believed that the sun was close to people at noon. For this reason, they each held their own opinions and couldn&#39;t argue. Even a learned man like Confucius Nothing can be done. This story illustrates that in order to understand nature and explore objective truth, one must dare to think independently and question boldly; it also illustrates that the universe is infinite and knowledge is infinite, and even the most knowledgeable people will not know something, and learning is endless. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The story can be understood in three parts. First, it writes about Confucius&#39; encounter with two children arguing on the road, and points out the time, place, characters and causes of the story. The two children expressed two completely different views on the issue of how far the sun is from the earth at different times. Then write about two children using the intuition (visual, tactile) that people can experience in daily life to clarify their opinions to refute the other party&#39;s opinions. Finally, it is written that Confucius was unable to make a decision when facing the argument between the two children, which caused the two children to &quot;laugh&quot;. The full text is only about a hundred words, but it can give people many enlightenments. It is characterized by language expression to express characters and unfold the storyline through dialogue description, which expresses the innocence and loveliness of the two children and the scientific attitude of Confucius&#39; modesty, prudence, and seeking truth from facts. &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;After-class questions&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;p>; 1. What do you think of the two children laughing at Confucius? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; It is certainly wrong for the two children to ridicule Confucius, but on the other hand, the knowledgeable Confucius still cannot answer the question, which reflects that there is no end to learning, so we must live to learn. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; ⒉What inspiration does this story have for you? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The meaning of the above question is roughly the same, which means that people should live to learn. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; 1. The two characters are in the last sentence: wei-shuo, zhi-zhi-wisdom. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; 2. Its——refers to the matter of two children debating the sun and——waiting——decision, judgment, decision&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Cangcang——the feeling of cold weather&lt; /p>; &lt;p>; 3. I think that the sun is close to people when it first rises, but it is far away from people at noon. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; 4. Why is the sun so bright when you look at it in the morning and evening? Especially small at noon? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In the morning and evening, the angle of the sun is low, and the atmosphere it penetrates is very thick. It is greatly affected by the gradient refractive index of the atmosphere, and the light path is significantly curved, so the sun is seen by people. At noon, the angle of the sun is large, and it penetrates The transparent atmosphere is relatively thin, and is less affected by the gradient refractive index of the atmosphere. The bending of the light path is not as obvious as in the morning and evening, so the sun seen by people feels smaller. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In addition, when the sun rises from the ground in the morning, the houses or mountains in the distance are in sharp contrast to the big sun, which is smaller and larger, but there is no east rise around noon. Compared with it, it will obviously look small. This is because our naked eyes deceive us. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; You draw two circles of the same size, then draw a larger circle outside one circle and a smaller circle outside the other. You will feel that the two circles that are originally the same size seem to be different sizes. &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;Appreciation&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;p>; This article reflects the ancient Chinese people&#39;s understanding of natural phenomena by describing two children arguing about the distance between the sun and people in the morning and noon. The valuable spirit of exploration and independent thinking, bold questioning, and pursuit of truth. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; This short story is run through dialogue. The full text uses Confucius&#39;s inability to decide as a running clue, and narrates the process of the two children&#39;s debate about the sun in a very orderly manner. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; First, write two children&#39;s clear opinions on the distance between the sun and people, which makes people think. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Then the basis is presented separately. The two refused to give in to each other, and both used rhetorical questions to capture the word &quot;debate&quot; in the title and enhance the argumentative nature. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;Laugh&quot; obviously means &quot;ridicule&quot; in the original text. As for whether you should &quot;laugh&quot; or not, you can look at it from many aspects. From the perspective that the author is a Taoist and Confucius is a Confucian, it is obvious that Confucius should be &quot;laughed&quot;; but from the perspective of Confucius&#39; attitude, it is not appropriate to &quot;laugh&quot;, because Confucius seeks truth from facts and &quot;knows what he knows, and does not know what he doesn&#39;t know.&quot; There is no &quot;strong ignorance and ignorance&quot;, so why should you &quot;laugh&quot; at him? &quot;Confucius cannot decide&quot; tells people that a person should seek truth from facts and cannot pretend to understand; &quot;Confucius cannot decide&quot; also tells us that a great scholar like Confucius still has problems that cannot be solved. From this point of view, knowledge is useless. To the end, everyone should keep learning and never give up exploring. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Confucius once said: Knowing something is knowing it, and not knowing it is not knowing. This is knowing. Confucius did not make any hasty decisions when facing the argument between the two children, which reflected his scientific attitude of seeking truth from facts. The two children are good at observing common life phenomena, discovering problems from them, and triggering thinking. It can also be seen from the fact that the two children observe and understand things from different angles, and the results are naturally inconsistent. This shows that they usually pay attention to observing life and comprehend life, and they are diverse. scientific thinking; at the same time, they also have the scientific spirit of independent thinking and bold questioning. This article also profoundly elaborates on the principle that &quot;learning has no end&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In fact, modern science has a scientific explanation for this phenomenon: in the morning and evening, the angle of the sun is low, the atmosphere it penetrates is very thick, it is greatly affected by the gradient refractive index of the atmosphere, and the optical path is significantly bent. , so the sun that people see is bigger; at noon, the angle of the sun is large, the atmosphere it penetrates is relatively thin, and it is less affected by the gradient refractive index of the atmosphere. The bending of the light path is not as obvious as in the morning and evening, so the sun that people see feels smaller. . In addition, when the sun rises from the ground in the morning, and the houses or mountains in the distance are in sharp contrast to the big sun, smaller and larger, and there is nothing around to contrast with it at noon, it will obviously appear Small, this is our naked eyes deceiving us. Moreover, due to natural factors such as the shape of the earth, the atmosphere, and the laws of operation, it is impossible to give a correct explanation simply by using the laws of life or common sense. But making a correct explanation is a long process, and what is needed is the spirit of independent thinking, bold questioning, and seeking truth from facts of the &quot;two children&quot; and Confucius. &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;Reference materials&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;p>; 1. This article is selected from Liezi Tangwen. Liezi is said to have been written by Lieyu Kou (approximately 450 BC - 375 BC) from the Zheng State during the Warring States Period. It contains many excellent fables and folk tales from the pre-Qin era. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; 2. Confucius (551 BC - 479 BC), whose name was Qiu and whose courtesy name was Zhongni. A native of Zouyi of the state of Lu (now southeast of Qufu, Shandong), he was a thinker, politician, educator and founder of the Confucian school in the late Spring and Autumn Period. His words and deeds throughout his life were compiled into the book &quot;The Analects of Confucius&quot; by his students and passed down to the world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; 3. When does the sun get closer to people? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Is the sun closer to people at noon? Or is it closer to people in the morning and evening? The fact that the sun is brighter in the morning and evening than at noon is due to people&#39;s misconception; the sun at noon is hotter than in the morning and evening because the sun is directly shining at noon. The distance traveled by the sun in the atmosphere is shorter and less heat is absorbed. First, we should understand why people observe the sun from different distances at noon and in the morning and evening. There are many reasons: (1) The earth is spherical and constantly rotating. If the earth has no other motion except rotation, and the axis of rotation is perpendicular to the straight line between the sun and the earth, then for a person on the equator, the sun will always be closer at noon than in the morning and evening. That is to say, the closer distance is equivalent to the earth&#39;s radius of 6,400 kilometers. . (2) Depending on the latitude of the earth, the observer may not be on the equator. The greater the latitude, the further away from the equator, the smaller the distance difference between the sun at noon and morning and evening. (3) The earth not only rotates, but also orbits the sun. The axis of rotation and the axis of revolution form an angle of 235°. The direction of the spin axis changes very slowly. Therefore the height of the sun at noon in the sky changes throughout the year. (4) The earth’s orbit is elliptical, so the distance between the earth’s center and the heliocenter changes day by day. (5) The sunrise and sunset times change day by day throughout the year, and the sunrise and sunset times on the same day vary with latitude. (6) Due to the slow change in the direction of the Earth&#39;s rotation axis and the impact of planetary gravity on the Earth&#39;s orbit, the date when the geocenter and the heliocenter are closest is not fixed. (At present, the closest distance between the heliocenter and the earth&#39;s center is January 2, and thereafter it advances by 17 and a half days every thousand years.) Taking into account the above reasons, appropriate formulas can be derived to calculate the distance between the sun and the observer at noon, morning and evening Difference. The necessary information can be found in the astronomical almanac. The calculation results are as follows: For a city such as Beijing with a latitude of 40 degrees north, currently from January 22 to June 5 at noon every year, the sun is farther than when it rises. It is 1,000 kilometers farther in early February, 4,000 kilometers farther in early March, and 4,000 kilometers farther in early March. At the beginning of the month it was as far as 6,400 kilometers, and later the difference was reduced to zero. After June 5th, the sun is closer at noon than at sunrise. It is nearly 5,800 kilometers in early July and 16,000 kilometers in mid-September. After that, the difference decreases to January 22nd of the following year. The difference between noon and evening is very different. From August 1st to December 15th, noon is farther than evening, and in the remaining seven and a half months, noon is closer than evening. In mid-April, the distance reaches 17,000 kilometers. …The above calculations were made in 1954. However, since the sixth cause has little impact in a short period of time, the above calculation results are still applicable to the next hundred years. It can be seen that all phenomena must be explained by science to be correct. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; (Devense &quot;Is the sun closer to us at noon than in the morning and evening&quot;)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; 4. What&#39;s the reason why it&#39;s cold when it&#39;s close in the morning and hot when it&#39;s far away at noon? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The sun looks bigger in the morning than at noon. Is it because the sun is closer to us in the morning and farther away from us at noon? no. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Under certain conditions, people&#39;s vision of objects will cause illusions. An object will appear larger among some small objects, and an object will appear larger among some large objects. Smaller. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Similarly, in the morning sun, only a corner of the horizon is the sky, while the rest is backed by trees, houses, etc. At noon, the sun is extremely large above the head. The sky serves as its backing, so the sun at noon appears smaller than the sun in the morning. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In addition, we see white graphics larger than black graphics of the same size. This is called &quot;light penetration&quot; in physics. When the sun first rises, the surrounding sky is dark, so the sun appears bright. However, at noon, the surrounding sky is very bright. In contrast, the brightness difference between the sun and the background is not that great. This also makes us look The reason why the sun is larger in the morning than at noon. In short, the distance of the sun from us is the same in the morning and at noon, so its size is also the same. The fact that the sun in the morning seems larger than at noon is an illusion of the eyes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Also, it is hotter at noon than in the morning. Is it because the sun is closer to us at noon than in the morning? Neither. So why? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; It is hotter at noon than in the morning because the sun shines directly on the ground at noon, while in the morning the sun shines obliquely on the ground. It can be seen that when the sun shines directly on the ground, the ground and the air are at the same time. The same area receives more radiant heat from the sun than when the morning sun is slanting, so the heating is the strongest. Therefore, it is hotter at noon than in the morning. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In fact, the hot or cold weather is mainly determined by the air temperature. The main factor affecting air temperature is determined by the radiation intensity of the sun, but solar heat is not the main reason that directly increases the temperature. Because the heat energy directly absorbed by the air is only a small part of the total heat energy of solar radiation, most of which is absorbed by the ground. After the ground absorbs solar radiation heat, it is then conducted upward to the air through heat transfer methods such as radiation and convection. This is the main reason for the increase in temperature. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In short, it is hotter at noon and colder in the morning every day, not because the sun is far or near from our ground. &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;Creative background&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>; This article is excerpted from Chapter 7 of &quot;Liezi·Tangwen&quot;, and the title was added by later generations. This article records the story of two children during the Spring and Autumn Period and Confucius, a great scholar at that time. &lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;Teaching Suggestions&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;p>; 1. Before class, teachers can review the scientific knowledge involved in the text. You can also assign students pre-class homework: Does the distance between the sun and the earth change throughout the day? Why does the sun look bigger in the morning and smaller at noon? Why does it feel cooler in the morning and hotter at noon?&quot; Collect information on your own. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; 2. Although this article is concise, the different meanings of ancient and modern words are still a difficulty for students to read and understand. For example, the modal particle &quot;hu&quot;, which rarely appears in modern texts, appears three times in the article. Solve this problem It is recommended to divide a difficult point into three steps. (1) After students read the text, they can initially understand the meaning of each sentence based on the annotations. For students who do not understand, the teacher can give a little guidance so that students can understand the context. (2) Read it repeatedly to understand the content of the story . ⑶ Tell this story in your own words. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; 3. This story contains profound truth. Teachers can organize students to discuss and share what they think of after reading this text. Students should be encouraged to speak freely and start from Gain insights from multiple angles. For example, the two children like to explore, and their spirit is commendable; the two children understand things from different angles, and the results are different; Confucius can correctly treat the questions raised by the children, not knowing what is not known, and seeking truth from facts.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; As for the end of the article, Confucius &quot;cannot solve it&quot;, students should know that many natural phenomena are common scientific knowledge to us, but in ancient times they were mysteries that were difficult to solve due to underdeveloped science and technology, so Confucius &quot;Unable to decide&quot; is understandable. It can be seen that the universe is huge and the knowledge is vast, up and down. Even a wise man cannot know everything. Confucius did not &quot;pretend to know what you don&#39;t know&quot;, but in the spirit of &quot;knowing what you know, knowing what you don&#39;t know&quot; &quot;I don&#39;t know&quot; attitude of seeking truth from facts. Therefore, when teaching, do not take the joke about Confucius as the main theme.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; 4. When learning classical Chinese, repeated reading is the most important method. When learning this article, you should still pay attention to guided reading.
