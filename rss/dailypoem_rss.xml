He once lived in Lumen Mountain. He called himself Lumenzi, and also called Mr. Jianqi Buyi and Zuiyin. A writer and essayist in the late Tang Dynasty, he is as famous as Lu Guimeng and is known as &quot;Pi Lu&quot; in the world. Today, he is from Tianmen, Hubei (&quot;Beimeng Suoyan&quot;), Han nationality. In the eighth year of Xiantong (867), he passed the Jinshi title. In the Tang Dynasty, he served successively as military judge of Suzhou (&quot;History of Wu and Yue&quot;), Zuo Lang, Dr. Taichang, and deputy envoy of Piling.

Chinese Valentine&#39;s Day, the seventh day of the seventh lunar month every year, is the day when Altair and Vega meet. It is a beautiful folk legend. The author took a boat with magnolia trees as oars and went boating on Weishan Lake, known as the &quot;Land of Lotus Roots&quot;. At this time, the singing on the boat stopped from afternoon to evening. The weather on the lake is slightly cool, and the willows are shrouded in light smoke, which is reflected in the quiet water. The green distant mountains are like ripples in the water, just like eyebrows; the pale yellow moon is also curved and high, like a beautiful eyebrow. &quot;The mountain&#39;s eyebrows are blue and the moon&#39;s eyebrows are yellow&quot; is a very good sentence. It refers to the mountains and the moon of Weishan Lake as &quot;eyebrows&quot;. They face each other from a distance, and it is vaguely visible that the Cowherd and the Weaver Girl are &quot;encountering each other&quot; and expressing affection with each other&#39;s eyes. &lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;About the author&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;div>;&lt;center>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://song.gushiwen.cn/authorImg/yaoxie.jpg&quot; width=50%>;&lt;/ center>;&lt;/div>;Yao Xie (1805-1864) was a writer and painter in the late Qing Dynasty.

Daoguang raised people and taught through his writings for life. His scholarship covers classics, history, geography, Buddhism, drama, and novels. He is good at poetry and painting, especially figures and plum blossoms.
