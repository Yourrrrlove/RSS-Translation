Don’t rush. &lt;/div>;&lt;h3>;Translation and annotations&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Translation&lt;/strong>;&lt;br />; Our army is stationed at Qingban outside the east gate of Wugong County. The weather is very cold and all the soldiers are there. Horses drink in the spring caves of Taibai Mountain. The yellow-headed Xi soldiers were advancing westward every day. Only a few cavalrymen dared to bend their bows and shoot arrows to attack our army. At this time, there was snow on the mountains, ice in the river, and a bleak atmosphere in the wilderness. The green ones are the beacon smoke that raised the alarm, and the white ones are the bones of the soldiers who died in battle. How can we ask someone to bring a message to our army, instructing them to be patient for the time being and wait until next year to counterattack again? Don&#39;t be impatient. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Notes&lt;/strong>;&lt;br />;East Gate: refers to the east gate of the county where Qingsaka belongs. &lt;br />;Taibai Grottoes: the main peak of the Qinling Mountains, located in today&#39;s Wugong and Taibai counties of Shaanxi. It is said here that Qingban is located in Taibai Grottoes. The mountains are high and the weather is cold. It is difficult to drink horses and the conditions are extremely difficult. &lt;br />;Huangtou Xi&#39;er: Many of An Lushan&#39;s troops are from Xi and Khitan tribes. &lt;br />;Sunward to the West: Advancing westward day by day. Qingban is west of Chentao. &lt;br />;Chitu: Flying cavalry makes a breakthrough, describing the courage to fight. &lt;br />;Mountain snow and river ice: Snow and ice are both verbs, referring to snow on mountains and frozen rivers. &lt;br />;Wild desolation: refers to the cold wind and howling. &lt;br />;⑧Beacon smoke: beacon fire, a signal of military emergency. &lt;br />;How can I attach a letter? How can I entrust a letter? &lt;br />;Haste: haste. &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;Creative background&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>; In the fifteenth year of Tang Xuanzong Tianbao&#39;s reign (756), Fang Guan was defeated in two battles. More than 40,000 people were killed and injured, and only a few thousand remained. people. At this time, Du Fu fell in Chang&#39;an City. When he heard the news, he wrote two poems, &quot;Sorrow for Chen Tao&quot; and &quot;Sorrow for Qingban&quot;. These two poems reflect the fact that the Tang army was defeated. &lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;Appreciation&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;p>; The words &quot;shuqi&quot; and &quot;dare&quot; in this poem are both tempered words. In just three words, the strength of Anlushan&#39;s rebels and the cowardice of the officers and soldiers were expressed. The sentence &quot;green is the smoke of the beacon fire and white is the bones of the human being&quot; should have been said &quot;green is the smoke of the beacon fire and white is the bones of the human being&quot;. To reduce it to seven sentences, I had to omit the word &quot;yes&quot;. There is a saying in &quot;Tong Google&quot; that &quot;the goose flies in front and the eagle flies behind&quot;. It originally meant &quot;the goose flies in front and the eagle flies behind&quot;. The word &quot;fly&quot; is omitted. There is also a sentence in &quot;Li Chao&#39;s Bafen Xiaozhuan Song&quot; that &quot;Qin had Li Si, Han and Cai Yong&quot;, omitting the word &quot;you&quot;. This kind of syntax is only seen in seven-character ancient poems and is absolutely impossible to find in five-character poems. It is also rare in seven-character rhyme poems. &quot;Green is the white bones of the beacon smoke&quot; is not only a descriptive sentence, but &quot;white bones&quot; is also an exaggeration. The bodies of fallen soldiers were left exposed in the wilderness for at least several months until nothing was left but a pile of bones. Du Fu&#39;s sentence only expresses the scene of &quot;dead bodies everywhere&quot;. He has a poem &quot;Relief from Boredom&quot;, in which there is a couplet: &quot;The jackals block the road and cut off all people, and the beacon fire illuminates the night with corpses.&quot; It is also about the wilderness after the war. It is two ways of writing the same artistic conception as &quot;Green is the white bones in the beacon smoke&quot; . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The second couplet of this poem describes the strength of An Lushan&#39;s troops, and the third couplet is the aftermath, so it writes about the tragic death of the officers and soldiers. In another poem &quot;Sorrowful Chen Tao&quot; that narrates the same incident, the second couplet describes the officers and soldiers&#39; morale is weak and lacks combat effectiveness; the third couplet is the consequences of this, so it describes the domineering &quot;qunhu&quot;. It can be seen that Du Fu&#39;s artistic method of describing the same event from two different perspectives. The fourth couplet is about the people trapped in Chang&#39;an City and the author&#39;s own thoughts and feelings. After Chen Taoxie&#39;s defeat, the people in Chang&#39;an City were crying bitterly and hoped that the government troops would counterattack again immediately. However, after Qingsaka was defeated again, the people knew that the enemy&#39;s and our own forces were far apart, so they had to give up the idea of ​​&quot;watching the troops day and night&quot;. When Du Fu heard the news of the defeat of the Tang army in Chang&#39;an City, he was very anxious. Instead, we had to imagine asking someone to bring a message to the officers and soldiers, hoping that they would reorganize their forces and counterattack next year. The concluding sentences of these two poems profoundly express the logical changes in the people&#39;s thoughts and feelings towards the officers and soldiers who have experienced repeated successes and failures. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;Du Shi Jingquan&quot; quoted Shao Zixiang&#39;s comment: &quot;Watching the officers and soldiers day and night, this is the human sentiment; wait patiently for the next year and don&#39;t rush, this is the military aircraft. The reason why this Du is the history of poetry.&quot; This comment , reflecting that Shao Zixiang believed that the two conclusions were contradictory, so he said that the conclusion of &quot;Bei Chen Tao&quot; was the people&#39;s feelings; he said that the conclusion of &quot;Bei Qingban&quot; was that the military situation required it. He thought this could explain the contradiction. In fact, it is specious. You know, &quot;Military aircraft are like this&quot; is also the understanding and emotion of the people in Chang&#39;an City after hearing about the defeat of Qingban. Du Fu wrote about the changes in people&#39;s thoughts and feelings. It is impossible to think that the endings of the two poems are contradictory. &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;About the author&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;div>;&lt;center>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://song.gushiwen.cn/authorImg/dufu.jpg&quot; width=50 %>;&lt;/center>;&lt;/div>;Du Fu (712-770), whose courtesy name is Zimei, who calls himself Shaoling Yelao, is also known as &quot;Du Gongbu&quot;, &quot;Du Shaoling&quot;, etc., Han nationality, Fugong County, Henan (now Henan Province Gongyi City), a great realist poet in the Tang Dynasty, Du Fu is respected by the world as the &quot;Sage of Poetry&quot;, and his poems are called &quot;the history of poetry&quot;.
