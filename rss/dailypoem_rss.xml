The water is clear and the sand is bright with moss on both sides. &lt;br />;Twenty-five strings are played on the night moon, and all the resentment comes flying. &lt;/div>;&lt;h3>;Translation and Notes&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Translation&lt;/strong>;&lt;br />;Why did you come back from such a beautiful place as Xiaoshui and Xiangshui so easily? The stream there is clear, the sand and stones are clear, and there is moss on the shore for you to forage for. Why don&#39;t you want to stay? &lt;br />;Dayan replied: The harp tune played by the God of Xiangling on the moonlit night was too sad. I couldn&#39;t stand the sad and resentful tune, so I had to leave Xiaoxiang and fly back to the north. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Notes&lt;/strong>;&lt;br />;Xiaoxiang: the name of Ershui, in present-day Hunan. &lt;br />;Easy: easy and casual. &lt;br />;Shui Bi Sha Ming: moss, food for birds, especially geese. &lt;br />;Twenty-five strings: finger harp. &lt;br />;Sheng (sound shēng): bear. &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;Appreciation 1&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;p>; Although this song &quot;Returning Wild Geese&quot; was written in the north, it is about the spring geese returning from the south. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The poem chants &quot;Returning Geese&quot;. Geese are migratory birds. They fly to the south to spend the winter in late autumn and fly back to the north in the warm spring. The ancients believed that geese flying south in autumn do not cross Huiyan Peak in Hengshan Mountain, Hunan. They fly to the north of the peak and inhabit the lower reaches of the Xiangjiang River, and then fly back to the north after winter. Based on this understanding, the author thought of the Xiangjiang River, the habitat before their return, from the returning geese, and from the Xiangjiang River, he thought of the myth that the goddess of the Xiangjiang River was good at playing the harp. Then, based on the harp song &quot;Guiyan Cao&quot;, he combined the harp and the harp with the wild geese. The return of the poem is connected, thus forming the whimsical thoughts in the poem. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;Why wait to return to Xiaoxiang? The water is clear and the sand is bright with moss on both sides.&quot; The first two sentences are inverted. The ancients generally did not know much about the living habits of wild geese, and believed that they would stop flying south when they fly to Huiyan Peak in the south of Hengyang County, Hunan Province, and return north when the flowers bloom in the spring of the next year. Xiaoxiang is located in the south of Dongting Lake, with warm water, sufficient food, and a good climate. The ancients thought it was a good place for wild geese to spend the winter, so the poet imagined that returning geese flew from Xiaoxiang. As a migratory bird, it is a normal natural phenomenon for wild geese to return from the south to the north whenever spring comes. However, the poet insisted on asking a question, using two sentences in a row. This is contrary to the common practice of poets in the past who took the return of spring geese to the north as a matter of course. He deliberately expressed his confusion about the return of the wild geese and asked why they were willing to leave the Xiangjiang River with beautiful environment and abundant water and grass and come back. This sudden inquiry immediately leads the reader&#39;s thinking to the track arranged by the poet - ignoring the habits of the wild geese, and exploring the reasons for the wild geese&#39;s return. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The author answered on behalf of Yan in the third and fourth sentences: &quot;Twenty-five strings play the moon at night, and all the grievances fly away.&quot; The goddess of the Xiangjiang River plays the harp (twenty-five strings) under the moonlit night. , the sad and plaintive sound of the whistle, the wild geese couldn&#39;t bear to listen to it any longer, so they flew back to the north. These two sentences use the legend of Xiangling drum and harp. According to ancient legend, the goddess of the Xiangshui River was good at playing the harp. The harp originally had fifty strings, but because the goddess played it with a sad and sorrowful tone, God ordered it to be changed to twenty-five strings. The poet used his rich imagination and used beautiful myths to show readers the sad artistic conception of the God of Hunan and the harp, and deliberately created the image of the wild goose who is sentimental and knowledgeable in music. So why did the poet write the Xiang God&#39;s drum and harp in such a sad way? Why are the wild geese so &quot;unbearable&quot;? In fact, the wild geese described by the poet are derived from the phrase &quot;Chu guests are unbearable to listen to&quot;. The author created the image of the traveling geese living in the Xiangjiang River based on the &quot;Chu guests&quot; who were demoted to other places. When the traveling geese heard Xiang Ling&#39;s mournful whistle, they felt homesick and unbearable, and resolutely left the beautiful and rich Xiangjiang River and flew back to the north. The poet uses the wild geese filled with the sorrow of traveling to euphemistically express the sorrow of traveling in a foreign country. From the returning geese, I thought of their habitat before their return, and also thought of the myth that the goddess of the Xiangjiang River was good at playing the harp, and then based on the harp song &quot;Guiyan Cao&quot; and then connected the harp with the return of the geese, thus forming the poem. of fantastic ideas. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; A short four-line poem with novel ideas and rich imagination. Although the night view of Xiaoxiang and the sound of the whistle in the poem are all imaginary words, through such questions and answers, the geese are described as beings who understand music and are full of emotions. This poem appears to be about wild geese, but it is actually about the poet&#39;s feelings on a spring night. The poem does not directly say what this feeling is. It is precisely because it is not stated clearly that it leaves readers with unlimited room for imagination. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The sentence &quot;The grievances are flying away&quot; in &quot;Guiyan&quot; turns out to be this seven-character quatrain with ingenious and novel conception, rich imagination, ethereal writing style, tactful lyricism, and interesting meaning. With its unique artistic features, it has become one of the most eye-catching and famous poems about chanting wild geese. &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;Appreciation 2&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;p>; Sentimentality is a characteristic of ordinary poets. But just being sentimental without being able to express this emotion appropriately and beautifully to arouse the resonance of others is not a successful poet. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Qian Qi&#39;s poem &quot;The Return of the Wild Goose&quot; is a masterpiece that uses the question and answer between the poet and the wild goose to reveal a certain feeling on a spring night. It embodies deep emotions in a tactful and fluent form. Here, the poet&#39;s own travel sadness and homesickness are the driving force behind the poem, while the wild geese coming from the south, or the song related to the returning wild geese, are the opportunity for the poet to get inspiration and turn the erratic inspiration into a vivid image. The abundant emotions in the poet&#39;s heart give birth to his creative passion, and once this passion finds the appropriate language form, it will become a beautiful poem. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first couplet is the poet&#39;s inquiry about Guiyan. Legend has it that wild geese fly south for the winter and turn back when they reach Huiyan Peak in Hengshan Mountain. So the poet has this question: Oh, geese from the south, why did you leave Xiaoxiang, a quiet and fertile place with clear water and clear sand and covered with berries and moss, and fly all the way back to the north? The second couplet is Dai Guiyan&#39;s answer: Because there is Xiang Ling playing the harp under the moonlight, and I couldn&#39;t help the coldness and sadness of the tune, so I turned back. Of course, this answer is completely imaginary, but such an answer secretly (rather than directly or explicitly) leads to the legend of Xiangling Guzi, allowing the reader to close his eyes and imagine someone playing music by the river on a moonlit night. The image of a woman pouring out her sorrows creates an unbearable reaction. As a result, the reader understands the reason why the wild geese &quot;fly away&quot; (that is, turns back and flies), and further, through the poet&#39;s questions and answers with Tong Guiyan, a visitor from the south, he can experience the poet&#39;s feelings of being in the north and missing his hometown in the south. And this is what Qian Qi really wanted to express when he wrote this poem. &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;About the author&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;div>;&lt;center>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://song.gushiwen.cn/authorImg/qianqi.jpg&quot; width=50 %>;&lt;/center>;&lt;/div>;Qian Qi (722?-780), courtesy name Zhongwen, Han nationality, from Wuxing (now Huzhou City, Zhejiang Province), was a poet of the Tang Dynasty.

When we were young, we were walking together, fighting for a sheepskin, and each of them asked for something to borrow on his back. After a long time without success, he sued the official. When Hui sent the contenders out, Guzhou Jigang said: &quot;Can you know the master with this sheepskin?&quot; There was no reply from the crowd. Hui ordered him to place it on the sheepskin mat, hit it with his stick, and when he saw a few salt flakes, he said: &quot;It&#39;s true.&quot; The person who made the argument looked at it, and the person who paid the salary fell down and committed the crime. &lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;h3>;Translation and Notes&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Translation&lt;/strong>;&lt;br />; There are two people carrying salt and firewood, and they put them down at the same time.

Li Hui asked them to go out, looked at the chief register of the state capital and said, &quot;Can the owner of this sheepskin be found out?&quot; None of the subordinate officials could answer. Li Hui asked someone to put the sheepskin on the seat, beat it with a stick, and when he found a little salt, he said: &quot;We have the truth!&quot; Then he asked the two parties to come in to see, and the person carrying the firewood fell on the ground and admitted his crime. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Notes&lt;/strong>;&lt;br />;Negative: Back. &lt;br />;Fuel: firewood. &lt;br />;Relieving the burden together: (two people) letting go of the burden at the same time.
