Amid the sound of horns being drawn, horses come and go frequently. Who can talk about the desolation? The west wind blows the old red maple tree. &lt;br />;In the past, there were countless grievances. The iron horse fights, the road to Qingzhong at dusk. How deep is the love? The sunset in the deep mountains and the deep autumn rain. &lt;/div>;&lt;h3>;Translation and annotations&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Translation&lt;/strong>;&lt;br />;From ancient times to the present, the rise and fall of the country has been uncertain. Before our eyes, it seems as if war horns are blowing, beacon smoke is billowing, and war horses are billowing. Who can say that the yellow sand covers the sun and the desolation is everywhere when galloping back and forth? The autumn wind was blowing, and only a few maple trees had their leaves blown red again. &lt;br />;In the past, there were endless sad and desolate memories, but in the land of war and iron horses, it was the way Zhaojun sacrificed his life to seek peace. How deep was the love once? It is like the continuous autumn rain in the deep mountains under the afterglow of the setting sun. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Notes&lt;/strong>;&lt;br />;No definite basis: There is no certainty. Mao Kai of the Song Dynasty wrote a poem in &quot;The Fisherman&#39;s Proud Ci Danyang Recalls an Old Friend&quot;: &quot;It is unbearable that there is no fixed date of return, and the end of the world has already been heard.&quot;&lt;br />;Huajiao: an ancient wind instrument, passed down from Xiqiang. It is called because of the painted surface. It makes a mournful and high-pitched sound and is shaped like a bamboo tube. It is thin in nature and large in size at the end. It is made of bamboo wood or leather. In ancient times, it was often used in the army to warn people at dusk, boost morale and calm the appearance of the army. When the emperor went on patrol, he also used it to call for martial law. &lt;br />;Herding horses: refers to war horses used in ancient battles. &lt;br />;Who can talk: Does anyone want to talk to me? &lt;br />;Grudges in the past: wars between various ethnic groups and tribes in the past. &lt;br />;Iron Horse and Jin Ge: describes the majestic soldiers and horses. Refers to war. Military affairs. &lt;br />;Green Tomb: A grave covered with weeds. This refers to the tomb of Wang Zhaojun. It is said that the grass on the tomb is evergreen, hence the name. Du Fu&#39;s poem &quot;Ode to Ancient Relics&quot;: &quot;Once I go to the purple terrace and the desert, I am left alone with the green tomb facing the dusk.&quot;&lt;br />;How deep is the love: paraphrased from Ouyang Xiu&#39;s &quot;Butterfly Love Flower&quot;: &quot;How deep is the courtyard?&quot; The meaning of the sentence . How much: How much. &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;Appreciation&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;p>; This poem expresses feelings about the rise and fall of past dynasties and historical changes through the description of the ancient battlefield outside the Great Wall. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The first part of the poem describes the scene, describing the desolate scene of the ancient battlefield outside the Great Wall. &quot;There is no definite basis for ancient and modern rivers and mountains.&quot; The first sentence starts with a discussion. The simple words have a sense of historical depth and form an atmosphere that envelopes the entire article. The word &quot;modern and ancient&quot; includes the past and present. Facing the great rivers and mountains, many influential people competed for it, occupying it for a long time or temporarily, but no one occupied these places permanently. &quot;Amidst the sound of the horn being drawn, the herding horses come and go frequently.&quot; Two lines of line drawing paint a picture of peace beyond the Great Wall. The sound of the horn is drawn, and the vigorous herding horses come and go frequently. &quot;Who can talk about the desolation? The old red maple trees are blowing in the west wind.&quot; The two sentences are still descriptive. Looking around, the entire northern part of the Great Wall is covered with flat sand for thousands of miles. The desert is desolate, and it is difficult to find even a person to speak. The west wind blew, and only a few maple trees had their leaves turned red again. It reminds people of the tragic scenes of fierce fighting for this land, with corpses strewn across the fields and rivers of blood flowing. These red leaves once again bring people into the memory of history, deepening the deep sense of history in the work. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The second part of the poem is lyrical, describing your own feelings of being out of trouble. &quot;There used to be countless grievances.&quot; The first sentence of discussion is directly derived from Shangqiu&#39;s description of the ancient battlefield. Facing the desolate scenery of the ancient battlefield, the sorrow and hatred in my heart cannot be calculated. Just as Li Qi of the Tang Dynasty said in &quot;Ancient Military Journey&quot;: &quot;Pedestrians fight against the wind and sand, and the princess plays the pipa with many grievances.&quot; The next two sentences of the narrative: &quot;Golden arms and iron horses, on the road to the green tomb at dusk.&quot; &quot;Golden arms and iron horses&quot; represent war. &quot;Qingzhong Dusk Road&quot; uses the story of the marriage between King Zhaojun of Han Dynasty to represent the marriage. The two sentences summarize the two methods of war and peace. It shows that since ancient times, in order to compete for the country, war and peace, or both, are used. This is history. &quot;How deep is love? The sunset in the mountains and the autumn rain.&quot; The last two sentences combine love with scenery, expressing the author&#39;s feelings: Looking back on history, facing this ancient battlefield outside the Great Wall, the poet has a deep love for his motherland. This deep feeling is like the continuous autumn rain in the deep mountains under the afterglow of the setting sun. The meaning of the words is deep and implicit, with hidden meanings. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>; During the reign of Emperor Yuan of the Han Dynasty, Zhaojun was ordered to go to Fortress and Fan. With her communication and mediation, the Xiongnu and the Han Dynasty lived in harmony for sixty years. After her death, she was buried in Hudi. Because her tomb is close to Daqingshan and the Yellow River, Zhaojun&#39;s tomb is also called the &quot;Green Tomb&quot;. Du Fu wrote a poem, &quot;When I go to Zitai Lianshuo Desert, I leave the Green Tomb alone to the dusk.&quot; &quot; Nalan thought of Wang Zhaojun from the Qingzhong and asked her: &quot;How deep can the passion be? Is it as deep as the sunset in the mountains and the bitter rain in late autumn?&quot; As the personal bodyguard of Emperor Kangxi, the author often has to follow the saints He went on a patrol, so his heart was filled with the desire to serve the country, but he obviously did not want to achieve his ideals and ambitions through the method of &quot;one general succeeds and thousands of bones wither&quot;, so in the last sentence the author returned to his sentimental nature, he Ending with the scene language, I integrate my infinite deep feelings into the silent scenery, which contains both boldness and tenderness, and we can even experience a little desolation and helplessness. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>; This poem depicts the desolate peaceful scene in front of the poet through his &quot;out of the fortress&quot;. Looking back on history, he summarizes the two situations of war and peace. It is a regular summary of the replacement of dynasties in Chinese history. Therefore, Mao Zedong commented: &quot;See the rise and fall&quot;, which affirmed the ideological significance of this poem. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>; Xie Zhangqing once said in &quot;Words of Gambling and Chess Villa&quot;: &quot;It is difficult to combine long and short tunes. The only ones in the country are Zhutuo, Jialing, and Rongruohu. Zhutuo is won by learning. Jialing wins with talent, Rongruo wins with emotion.&quot; After reading the author&#39;s desolate and generous poem, we can know that Xie&#39;s words are true. &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;Creative background&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;p>; This poem was written by Nalan Xingde in August 1682 AD (the 21st year of Kangxi) when he was ordered to talk to Vice President Lang It was composed on the way to Suolong after leaving the fortress. The poet was twenty-eight years old at the time. &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;About the author&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;div>;&lt;center>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://song.gushiwen.cn/authorImg/nalanxingde.jpg&quot; width=50 %>;&lt;/center>;&lt;/div>;Nalan Xingde (1655-1685), a Manchurian with the courtesy name Rongruo and Lengya Mountain native, was one of the most famous poets in the Qing Dynasty. His poem &quot;Nalan Ci&quot; enjoyed a high reputation in the Qing Dynasty and even the entire Chinese poetry circle, and also occupied a glorious place in the history of Chinese literature. He lived during the period of integration of Manchu and Han Dynasties, and the rise and fall of his aristocratic family was typically related to the state affairs of the dynasty. Although he serves the emperor, he longs for ordinary experiences. The special living environment and background, coupled with his personal extraordinary talent, give his poetry creation a unique personality and distinctive artistic style. The &quot;Magnolia Order·Ancient Judgment&quot; that has been passed down to this day - &quot;If life is only as it was when we first met, why is the autumn wind sad and painted on the fan? It is easy to change the heart of the old, but it is said that the heart of the old is easy to change.&quot; Full of artistic conception, it is one of his many representative works one. &lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https:/ /feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br >;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 06 Oct 2023 04:23:06 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[残菊 | 曹雪芹]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://feedx.net/read?r=shiwen&d=231051]]><description> &lt;h2>;Canju&lt;/h2>;[Qing Dynasty] Cao Xueqin&lt;div style=&quot;color: #5b4636;&quot;>;The dew and frost are gradually falling, and the feast has just passed the light snow. &lt;br />;The pedicle has a lingering fragrance of gold and is indifferent, and the branches are not all covered with green leaves. &lt;br />;The moon falls on the bed and the crickets sound sick, thousands of miles of cold clouds and wild geese arrive late. &lt;br />;The autumn wind will see us again next year, so don’t miss us if we break up for the time being. &lt;/div>;&lt;h3>;Translation and annotations&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Translation&lt;br />;&lt;/strong>;When the cold dew and frost are getting heavier and heavier, the chrysanthemum branches gradually tilt, feast and enjoy the chrysanthemums It’s just passed and it’s the light snow solar term again. &lt;br />;The petals on the receptacle have not yet fallen off, but their color has gradually become lighter. The leaves on the branches have gradually fallen off, leaving them scattered and scattered. &lt;br />;A waning moon half shines in front of the bed, the chirping of crickets gradually becomes fainter, and the flight of the geese becomes slower in the sky covered with cold clouds. &lt;br />;We will definitely meet again next fall. Please don’t miss us too much after we break up for now. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Notes&lt;br />;&lt;/strong>;Qing Jie (qī): refers to the chrysanthemum leaning sideways. &lt;br />;Xiaoxue: a solar term after the beginning of winter. &lt;br />;Yuxiang: It actually means &quot;remaining petals&quot;, which is a metaphor for the beautiful girls who grew up under the shadow of this noble family. &lt;br />;Indifferent: refers to a dull color. &lt;br />;Li Phi: also means &quot;Phi Li&quot;, looking scattered. &lt;br />;Zhi see you again: &quot;I don&#39;t know if I can see you again&quot; means. Autumn Wind: Cheng Gao&#39;s &quot;Autumnal Equinox&quot; in &quot;A Dream of Red Mansions&quot; refers to the season, and there is not much difference between the two. But if the author has a moral, then each word has a different meaning. Since Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty wrote the poem &quot;Autumn Wind Ci&quot;, &quot;There is so much joy but so much sorrow, and when you are young and old, you are so helpless.&quot; In order to facilitate the inference of the original meaning, we will refer to the fat version. &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;Appreciation&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;p>; &quot;Chrysanthemum Poetry&quot; concludes with &quot;Remnant Chrysanthemum&quot;, which &quot;summarizes the prosperity of the previous title&quot; (Baochai&#39;s words). It is an irresistible law of nature to prosper and then decline, and it is the same in the human world. This poem uses the description of the broken chrysanthemum to hint at the decline of the Jia family and the ending of the separation of everyone. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In the first couplet, &quot;The dew is heavy with frost&quot; indicates that the crisis faced by Jia&#39;s family is getting more and more serious. The building is already crumbling, but everyone is unaware and still feasting and having fun. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The second couplet hints at the fate of everyone after the decline of the Jia family. They once lived a life of fine clothing and fine food, but now they are scorched and dull, losing their former color. Not only them, but the entire family will &quot;disperse and go their separate ways.&quot; &quot;Jin Danbo&quot; and &quot;Cui Li Phi&quot; not only describe the dazzling and prosperous scene of the past, but also vividly depict the later dilapidated situation, which shows the author&#39;s skill in choosing words and phrases. No wonder Baoyu was convinced by these words. This couplet of chrysanthemums has been described to the most vivid degree. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The neck couplet turns to write about people. &quot;Talent comes from being shrewd and ambition comes from being high.&quot; As a talented and ambitious girl, Tanchun had already been aware of the lurking crisis in her family, but she was unable to save herself. He married in a foreign land, which made her worry about her family members day and night, so much so that she could not sleep at night. She listened to the chirping of autumn insects outside the window getting weaker and weaker. In the sky, the belated geese flew slowly against thousands of miles of cold clouds, leaving behind A shrill wail. In this gloomy background picture, Jia Tanchun cheered up, comforted the chrysanthemums, and comforted himself: &quot;Next autumn, there will be a time to meet again. This is just a temporary separation, so there is no need to be too lovesick.&quot; This makes readers I am reminded of Tan Chun&#39;s tone in &quot;A Dream of Red Mansions: Dividing Flesh and Bones&quot;: &quot;Since ancient times, poverty and prosperity have all been determined. How can there be no fate for separation and reunion? From now on, we are divided into two places, each keeping safe. If you go, please don&#39;t get involved!&quot; But next year&#39;s chrysanthemums , is no longer the chrysanthemum of this year. As Zhen Shiyin sang in &quot;Commentary to the Good Song&quot;: &quot;Withered grass and withered poplars, it was once a singing and dancing venue.&quot; Life is like a dream, but it is not a dream; what disappears will disappear forever, and the new arrival does not know when it will come. The play is still going on, but the protagonists change again and again. The loneliness after the play is over can only be experienced by the person involved alone. Cheng Ben&#39;s continuation of the book hints at the ending of &quot;Lan Gui Qi Fang&quot; for readers. This is just like Tan Chun&#39;s wish to &quot;temporarily break up&quot;, which is nothing more than an expression of a good wish. Real life is often full of hope and helplessness. Facing the intertwined reality of sentimentality and ruthlessness, readers experience a more profound sadness. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The first six sentences of this poem gradually describe the extremely vital chrysanthemum, which is now in ruins, revealing Tanchun&#39;s calm insight into the tragic fate of Qunfang. However, among all the girls in the Grand View Garden, Tanchun is the most positive. She is not decadent when facing Canju. In the last couplet, she expresses the feeling that there is no need to be sad about the dead flowers, &quot;the flowers will bloom only when they fall, and they will be fragrant for the coming year.&quot; She places her hope in the future. Later, she angrily stated that she wanted to break out of this declining family and go out to &quot;build a career&quot; as evidenced by this. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Judging from the overall concept of &quot;Dream of Red Mansions&quot; and &quot;Chrysanthemum Poems&quot;, &quot;Remnant Chrysanthemum&quot; contains the meaning of &quot;End Game&quot;. The entire life course of the chrysanthemum implies the rise and decline of the Jia family, and the tragic life course of the young people in the Grand View Garden. It has far-reaching connections and is intricately linked. It is not enough to read it as an isolated poem. . &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;Creative background&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>; This poem comes from the 38th chapter of &quot;A Dream of Red Mansions&quot;, &quot;Lin Xiaoxiang&#39;s Chrysanthemum Poem, Xue Hengwu&#39;s Satire and Crab Ode&quot;. After the inscription of the Grand View Garden, through the Begonia Poetry Society and the Chrysanthemum Poetry Society, this period seemed to be the &quot;peaceful and prosperous age&quot; of the Grand View Garden, but fierce battles between orthodoxy and heresy, and life-and-death struggles between concubines and concubines, had occurred one after another. The feudal aristocracy and its younger generation enjoy flowers and drinks in this &quot;paradise&quot; that is actually full of dangers, and the premonition of decline is also invading their hedonistic life. For this event, Shi Xiangyun and Xue Baochai drafted the topic. There were a total of twelve topics, limited to seven rhymes, but not limited to rhyme. Baoyu, Daiyu, Baochai, Xiangyun, Tanchun and other five people were free to choose the topics. Jia Tanchun is &quot;talented and ambitious&quot;. He has already discovered the hidden crisis in his family, but he is unable to save the family. Jia Tanchun chose the title &quot;The Broken Chrysanthemum&quot; to imply that the family will end in ruins. &lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;About the author&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;div>;&lt;center>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://song.gushiwen.cn/authorImg/caoxueqin.jpg&quot; width=50%>;&lt;/ center>;&lt;/div>;Cao Xueqin (about May 28, 1715 - about February 12, 1763), named Zhan, also named Mengruan, also known as Xueqin, also known as Qinxi and Qinpu, is the author of the Chinese classic &quot;A Dream of Red Mansions&quot; The author&#39;s ancestral home is disputed (Liaoyang, Liaoning, Fengrun, Hebei, or Tieling, Liaoning). He was born in Jiangning (now Nanjing). Cao Xueqin was born in the Zhengbai Banner wrapping family of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Qing Dynasty. He was the grandson of Cao Yin, a weaver in Jiangning, and the son of Cao Yong (one theory is that Cao Fu&#39;s son). In the twenty-seventh year of Qianlong (1762), his youngest son died young. He fell into excessive sadness and grief and became bedridden. He died on New Year&#39;s Eve (February 12) in the 28th year of Qianlong&#39;s reign (1763) due to poverty and illness without medical treatment. Regarding the year of Cao Xueqin&#39;s death, there are also theories about New Year&#39;s Eve in the 29th year of Qianlong (February 1, 1764) and the early spring of Jiashen (1764). &lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 05 Oct 2023 08:23:06 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
