It is drizzling along the way, and the villages passing by have fallen flowers. &lt;br />;The weather is cold and the meager wine cannot keep me drunk. When I climb a tall building, I can only see the huge difference between the sky and the earth. It makes me feel extremely sad when I miss my hometown and my friends. &lt;br />;Looking back at my hometown thousands of miles away, who can I tell it to when I am full of emotions of separation? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Notes&lt;br />;&lt;/strong>;Hanshi: Cold Food Festival. One hundred and five days after the winter solstice every year, fire is forbidden and cold food is eaten, which is called cold food. Zheng Qi: Yu Menglong. In the later Zhou Dynasty, he served as Youshiyi and Zhishiguan, and moved to the palace to serve as the censor. After entering the Song Dynasty, he was demoted in 963 (the first year of Qiande) and died without taking office again. &quot;Servant&quot; may be a mistake for &quot;Servant&quot;. &lt;br />;Qingming Festival: Two days after the Cold Food Festival is the Qingming Festival, so Cold Food and Qingming Festival are often celebrated together. Jiaoyuan: suburban wilderness. Ancient customs include outings to visit tombs during Cold Food Festival and Qingming Festival, and spring outings in the countryside. &lt;br />;Liu Yingmen: During the Qingming Cold Food Festival in the Song Dynasty, there was a custom of inserting willows on the door, which is recorded in Volume 7 of &quot;Tokyo Menghua Lu&quot; and Volume 2 of &quot;Mengliang Lu&quot;. &lt;br />;Xiuzhu Temple: a Buddhist temple with slender bamboos. &lt;br />;Luohua Village: A village of falling flowers. &lt;br />;Jiuban: The wine tastes light. &lt;br />;迥(jiǒng): far. Broken Soul: This is used to describe extreme sadness. &lt;br />;Gushan: hometown. &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;Appreciation&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;p>; The first sentence &quot;Qingming&quot; is suffixed with the word &quot;season&quot;, which includes cold food. It was a custom in the Song Dynasty to &quot;go out to the countryside&quot; for a spring outing at this time. For example, there is a sentence in Shao Yong&#39;s &quot;Spring Outing&quot;: &quot;Only cold food can be eaten during the festivals in the world.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The second sentence &quot;Mountain City&quot; points out the poet. Travel location. &quot;Silent&quot; is a redundant word used to enhance the surrounding environment. Willow is a plant with seasonal climate characteristics. Not only did Han Xu of the Tang Dynasty have a famous saying that &quot;cold food makes the east wind protect the willows from slanting&quot;, but also people in the Song Dynasty used willows and other objects to decorate the top of the sedan chair and cover it with hanging willows every time they had cold food. Each household also made &quot;flying swallows made of jujube flour, strung with wicker sticks, and inserted at the root of the door&quot; (Volume 7 of &quot;Tokyo Menghua Lu&quot;). Therefore, &quot;Liu Yingmen&quot; is a unique scene of Hanshi. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; There are two sentences and two scenes in the chin couplet: one far and one close, one hazy and one clear, just like the composition of a painter, with harmonious tones and well-proportioned brushstrokes. Also written about the cold food Qingming Festival, Liu Yong&#39;s &quot;Magnolia Slowness&quot; poem: &quot;The tung blossoms are blooming, and the rain is sparse, washing the Qingming Festival. The apricots are burning in the forest, the peach fields are embroidered, and the scenery is like a screen.&quot; And in Yang Huizhi&#39;s poem In the description of the painting, &quot;a bamboo temple is built across the water and there is light smoke, passing by Shuyuluohua Village&quot;. Such a scene with elegant colors and desolate scenery echoes the &quot;silent mountain city&quot; in the past, and forms a distinct contrast with the bustling and lively scene of the capital during the cold weather. In contrast, the twists and turns euphemistically express the poet&#39;s sorrow after being demoted. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The neck couplet expresses emotions instantly. &quot;The weather is cold&quot; points out the climate characteristics of the Cold Food Festival, which is warm and then cold. &quot;The wine is thin&quot; implies the remoteness of the mountain city. From the Tang Dynasty to the Song Dynasty, there was a custom of sweeping graves with cold food. At this time, seeing this scene from a high place makes me miss home even more. In the poem, &quot;it&#39;s easy to lose one&#39;s soul&quot; comes from &quot;the place is far away&quot; and &quot;looking back to the old mountain thousands of miles away&quot;; and &quot;it&#39;s difficult to become drunk&quot; is also inseparable from this. These two sentences are similar to the lyrics in Fan Zhongyan&#39;s &quot;Royal Street Journey&quot;: &quot;My heart has been broken and I can&#39;t get drunk. Before the wine arrives, I will burst into tears.&quot; It is said that Song Taizong admired Yang Huizhi&#39;s poems very much and specially selected ten couplets to be written on the screen, including this couplet. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The beauty of the last couplet lies in ending it with a question. The poet originally had a &quot;feeling of separation&quot; that was ready to burst out. Here it is expressed as &quot;To whom&quot;, in the &quot;exposed bones&quot;, it is still the sound of singing and sighing, which is in harmony with the tone of the whole poem. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; When Xikun style was popular, the author could avoid carving gold and jade or piling up allusions. The forehead couplets are slightly changed in level and obliqueness. Although the neck couplets are perfectly aligned, they still have a slight meaning of &quot;flowing water pairing&quot; and still have the beauty of natural flow. The whole poem appears natural and fresh, both in content and artistic technique. &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;Creative background&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;&lt;p>; This poem was written from the beginning of the Qiande period of the Northern Song Dynasty (963-968) to the beginning of the Taiping and Xingguo period (976-984). Yang Huizhi was demoted to When I was a foreign official. Confessing the &quot;feelings of separation&quot; to his old friend Zheng Qi is the main theme of the whole poem. &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h3>;About the author&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;Yang Huizhi (921-1000) was an official in the Song Dynasty and a leader among the first generation of poets in the early Song Dynasty. His courtesy name was Zhongyou, a native of Pucheng, Jianzhou (now part of Fujian). In the second year of Xiande&#39;s reign in the later Zhou Dynasty, he was promoted to Jinshi Jia Ke, and he started as a school secretary, Jixian school manager, and was a retired official. Because of his outstanding literary talent, he was once ordered to participate in the editing of &quot;Wenyuan Yinghua&quot; and was responsible for the poetry section. During the reign of Emperor Zhenzong, he went to the Imperial Academy to study for a bachelor&#39;s degree. He was a pure and honest person, abiding by the rules, and respected the teachings. He was especially unfavorable to those who did not follow the Tao and worked hard. He later died of foot illness and was given the posthumous title of Wenzhuang. &lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 15 Sep 2023 06:23:06 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[饮马长城窟行 | 杨广]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://feedx.net/read?r=shiwen&d=239152]]><description> &lt;h2>;Drinking Horses in the Great Wall Grottoes&lt;/h2>;[Sui Dynasty] Yang Guang&lt;div style=&quot;color: #5b4636;&quot;>;The autumn wind blows solemnly and he travels thousands of miles leisurely. &lt;br />;No matter where you travel for thousands of miles, build the Great Wall across the desert. &lt;br />;Qitai Xiaozizhi, the camp of the sages. &lt;br />;This is a policy that will last forever to ensure the survival of hundreds of millions of people. &lt;br />;Don&#39;t worry about worrying about your thoughts, so you can sit back and relax in Beijing. &lt;br />;See the martial arts festival in Beihe, and roll the Rong banner thousands of miles away. &lt;br />;Mountains and rivers come and go, and the wilderness is impoverished. &lt;br />;Hitting the gold stopped the formation, and the drums sounded to encourage the soldiers. &lt;br />;Thousands of flags are moving, and horses are drinking in the Great Wall Grotto. &lt;br />;In autumn there are clouds outside the Great Wall, and the fog obscures the moon behind the mountains. &lt;br />;Yuanyan Post is on horseback, and the beacon fire breaks out in the air. &lt;br />;I would like to ask the Marquis of Changcheng, Shanyu came to the court to pay a visit. &lt;br />;The turbid air is calm in Tianshan Mountain, and the morning light shines on the high tower. &lt;br />;Release the troops and still revitalize the brigade, and we must do everything possible. &lt;br />;Drink until you say goodbye, and the credit goes to the Qing temple. &lt;/div>;&lt;h3>;Translation and Notes&lt;/h3>;&lt;p>;Serious: gloomy; bleak; cold. &lt;br />;Youyou: Long and long appearance. &lt;br />;What to do: What to do. &lt;br />;Hengmo: Crossing the desert. &lt;br />;Taiwan boy: It’s me.
