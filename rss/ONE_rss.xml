Nowadays, young people start to be involved in involution in kindergarten. One year’s tuition for a private kindergarten in a third-tier town It is three or four times the annual tuition of the university. During the holidays, students have to make up for their classes crazily. Interest classes in piano, chess, calligraphy and painting take up the children’s entertainment time. When they reach middle school and face the high school entrance examination and college entrance examination, the countdown usually makes students race against time. Is it okay not to learn? If you don&#39;t learn from others, you will fall behind others. This is involution. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I was chatting with a high school student who had just been admitted to a university a few days ago. He said that he had been admitted to a good undergraduate program, majoring in law. I said to him like a person who has come before: Congratulations, you can have a lot of fun during the summer vacation. This is the most stress-free and longest summer vacation ever! But the other party said that he didn&#39;t. He had already started self-study for the judicial examination and signed up for an IELTS training class. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Well, it seems that my situation is too small. I was filled with emotion. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Even so, there are still a large number of talented students who cannot find jobs after graduation and join the army of postgraduate entrance examinations. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Every young person understands what I am saying. Growing up in such an environment, &lt;strong>;with high housing prices and cheap wages, it is difficult for young people to gain a foothold in society and cannot satisfy themselves. needs, and gnawing on the elderly has gradually changed from a derogatory term to a normal thing&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;, not to mention those young people who have no old people to chew on. , allowing them to give birth to the next generation is not financially feasible in the first place. It is difficult for a clever woman to make a meal without straw. This is not a question of whether or not she wants to, but a question of whether she can. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The older generation may have a more difficult life, but they still firmly believe that having more children means more blessings, and a house full of children must have &lt;strong>;raising costs&lt;/strong>;. For example, the pursuit of &lt;strong>; >;Raising children scientifically&lt;/strong>;, whether it is diet, nutrition, education, training, or interest cultivation, is incomparable with the original &lt;strong>;free-range parenting&lt;/strong>;. The quality, ability, and thinking of children today are also the same as those of old. Children raised in this way are incomparable. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;We will not elaborate on the above clichés. Let’s talk about the root cause-&lt;strong>;The liberation of human nature&lt;/strong>;. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Today’s post-00s are more open, free and self-conscious than those born in the 90s. They dare to clamor for tradition and are not bound by tradition. Therefore, the post-00s rectify the workplace, the post-00s rectify the naughty children, and the post-00s rectify the marriage. Wait a minute, this is actually the collision of the open minds of the post-00 generation with traditional ideas. Lu Xun once said: This has always been the case, is it right? It can be seen that things passed down from ancestors are not suitable for every individual, and these children who have received higher education dare to ask questions and break the rules. They are paying more and more attention to independent thinking and making decisions, and no longer follow the crowd like the previous people. , get married when it’s time to get married, and have children when it’s time to have children, they have never asked a question why, as if the crowd is pushing the crowd, and the collective unconsciously buries their heads and moves forward. Once people have self-awareness, they will Think:&lt;strong>;Who am I? Why? What&#39;s the point? And this is the beginning of the liberation of humanity. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;When women’s self-awareness begins to awaken and women do not need to rely on marriage to live, they are not willing to serve as a “machine” for childbearing. After marriage, they will support their husbands, raise children, and contribute to the family. After working hard all your life, you lose the meaning of your life blooming. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;When men begin to awaken their self-awareness, they are no longer &lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>; bound by the idea of ​​​​passing on the family line. In order to marry a wife and have children, they are forced to live in a house. , cars, betrothal gifts, and children were so overwhelming that I couldn’t breathe. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Monogamous marriage binds two people together for decades. This thing itself is not in line with human nature. Human feelings are fluid and people are constantly changing. What has changed is that monogamy can no longer meet the needs of everyone. When people have higher requirements for the quality of life, they will no longer choose to make do and compromise, and the divorce rate will naturally increase. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The economic base determines the superstructure. Both men and women feel that marriage is not a worthwhile deal, and new marriage and love models have emerged, such as celibacy, AA marriage, DINK families, and those in the economically developed Jiangsu and Zhejiang regions. The &quot;two-end marriage&quot; is a break and reinvention of the traditional marriage model. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Teacher Li Yinhe once said that the trend of the decline of the marriage system first started in the Nordic countries. More and more people do not enter into marriage. Of course, there are also cases of cohabitation and living alone, but many people do not get married. In the United States and France, the proportion of people living alone accounts for 30% of the population, and the number is constantly increasing. In many Western countries, the data on people living alone has increased exponentially. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;The institution of marriage will still exist, and there will still be a large number of people in the world who believe in the love principle of &quot;one person for a lifetime&quot; and become soul mates and stay together for life, but this does not hinder this Institutions will also decline. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Judging from the current attitudes of young people, we are bound to follow this path, spreading from first-tier cities to the whole country. In the future, marriages will become diversified: some people choose to enter the traditional When it comes to marriage, some people choose to live together, live alone, or have an open marriage. The emancipation of people&#39;s minds has changed the marriage model. Even if it is difficult for the older generation to accept it, it is still an inevitable result of social development. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Love is free and cannot be bound for life by a contract. When marriage becomes more diverse, people will become freer. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;/p>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;Editor-in-charge: Mei Butan onewenzhang@wufazhuce.com&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Please see the @ONE Studio pinned Weibo for the call for papers information.

If you can&#39;t keep up with the rhythm of the times, then stop rightfully. If someone laughs, then let them laugh. &lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Autumn finally comes after several rains, and the anxiety of the whole summer is swept away by the white noise of falling rain. Lying in bed at night, there was the rustle of rain and thunder, and the cars on the street sounded their sirens, and I fell asleep in a daze. It’s great to get up after getting enough sleep. Autumn is here, the heat is blown away by the north wind, and I sit alone in front of the window again, and my life returns to the way it was before. This year I always feel very confused, as if there is a heavy fog in front of me. Not only can I not see the environment clearly, but I can also see myself clearly. In the past few years, I could identify my anger, pain, and depression, but this year, most of the time, I just sat at my desk in silence, unable to even understand what was happening to me. The only thing that is clear is that the times are roaring, but the direction is uncertain. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Perhaps there is no hope, or maybe I am tired. In the intensive events, I have seen too much, which has consumed energy and emotions. At this moment, my body is trying to retain energy. Qi Shen turned on the weak mode and no longer responded. Many times, I feel empty, neither wanting to see anything nor having any emotions. I used to think this was normal, but now it seems that my body is sending a warning. In fact, I am not as tough as I thought. I think too much, which is not good for my personal health. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;What I need at this moment is quietness, sleep, a bowl of hot soup, and living silently in an unnoticed corner, waiting for hope to come again. Something I&#39;ve been saying a lot lately is, I don&#39;t know. There are too many things here that I don’t understand, and there are too many current situations that I don’t understand. Everyone is very restless, running around, using up all their strength and venting their emotions without any clue. There is nothing wrong with this, I have done the same. After being suppressed for too long, we all need to relax for a moment, but there is something more important than relaxing at the moment, that is, what about the future? We are so depressed, so discouraged, and the future is unclear, and we cannot move forward quickly. So how should we live? &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I don’t know, I’m still sitting here. One day when autumn first arrived, I wanted to go hiking and made an appointment to meet at the gate of the park. We bought water and food and set off on time. As soon as we reached the bottom of the mountain, my feet hurt. So we walked by the lake and sat in silence for the whole afternoon. We listen to birds chirping and record their sounds into our phones to identify what kind of bird they are. We take photos of leaves and record their sounds into our phones to see what kind of tree they are. We watched people fishing by the lake. They were careless and did not lift their poles even if there were fish biting the hook. We have nothing to do, but we rarely feel happy. We wanted to do everything and go nowhere this afternoon, and so did the people around us. It was like pressing the pause button in autumn, finally stopping everything. Let us take a break. This era is too noisy and there is no peace anywhere. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;We must create opportunities for ourselves to rest. In the past, we had to live a collective life because of fear, and that exhausted me. I want to live my own life, which may be too extravagant. I want to decide my own time, decide where I want to go, find hope and motivation, and no longer look at myself through the eyes of others. We want to live, to play, to rest, to move forward when we are strong and to pause when we are weak. All these are truths that nature tells us, but they are too noisy. I haven’t heard such simple truths for a long time. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;We are accustomed to the context of the times moving forward. When we come here now, it is inevitable that we feel panic in our hearts. But the more we are at this moment, I think the pause becomes more and more precious. When the times are confused and disorderly, we must find our own rhythm. Although times and people are related, we can work hard to distance ourselves from them. I just live a simple and simple life. As for other things, I don’t want to know too much. If I can&#39;t distance myself from it at this moment, then I will put my life on hold and wait. There is no shortage of me in this world. I won&#39;t waste any time watching the clouds by the lake. It&#39;s time to separate yourself from your environment, stop joining the crowd and just live at your own pace. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I want to try my best to live in silence until a certain moment, until hope comes, and I can restart myself and my life. I&#39;m tired now, I want to rest, I want to suspend everything in the autumn, without any guilt, close to being righteous, that&#39;s about it. &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;Editor in charge: Nana&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Su Gengsheng’s column &quot;At This Moment&quot; is updated exclusively on the &quot;ONE&quot; APP every two weeks on Wednesdays. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Author&lt;/p>; &lt;hr style=&quot;margin-top: 15px;&quot;/>; &lt;table>; &lt;tr>; &lt;td style=&quot;width: 50px;&quot;>; &lt;img src=&quot;http: //image.wufazhuce.com/Fg_e6teZsb3lZ1QStYtdnAkh6bO8&quot; alt=&quot;Su Gengsheng&quot;>; &lt;/td>; &lt;td>; &lt;div>;Su Gengsheng&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10px&quot;>;&amp;nbsp;@ False Su Gengsheng&lt;/span >; &lt;/div>; &lt;div style=&quot;&quot;>;&quot;ONE·One&quot; resident writer. &lt;/div>; &lt;/td>; &lt;td width=&quot;60px&quot;>; &lt;!-- &lt;span onclick=&quot;OneAPP.openDetail(2, )&quot;>;Follow&lt;/span>; -->; &lt;/td>; &lt;/tr>; &lt;/table>; &lt;p>;Related recommendations&lt;/p>; &lt;hr/>; &lt;table>; &lt;tr>; &lt;td style=&quot;width: 40px;&quot;>; &lt;span>;Reading&lt;/span>; &lt;/td>; &lt;td>; &lt; a href=&quot;/article/6070&quot; data-ajax=&quot;false&quot;>; &lt;div>;Like a stone&lt;/div>; &lt;div>;Text/Su Gengsheng&lt;/div>; &lt;/a>; &lt;/td>; &lt;/tr>; &lt;tr>; &lt;td style=&quot;width: 40px;&quot;>; &lt;span>;Read&lt;/span>; &lt;/td>; &lt;td>; &lt;a href=&quot;/article/6034&quot; data-ajax=&quot;false&quot;>; &lt;div>; The weather is not as expected&lt;/div>; &lt;div>;Text/Su Gengsheng&lt;/div>; &lt;/a>; &lt;/td>; &lt;/tr>; &lt;tr>; &lt;td style=&quot;width: 40px;&quot;>; &lt;span>;Read&lt; /span>; &lt;/td>; &lt;td>; &lt;a href=&quot;/article/5999&quot; data-ajax=&quot;false&quot;>; &lt;div>;Escape is useful&lt;/div>; &lt;div>;Text/Su Gengsheng&lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; a>; &lt;/td>; &lt;/tr>; &lt;/table>; &lt;table>; &lt;tr>; &lt;td>; &lt;div style=&quot;text-align:center;padding:5px;&quot; onclick=&quot;OneAPP.openDetail(2,6088) &quot;>;Click to download ONE app&lt;/div>;&lt;/td>; &lt;/tr>; &lt;/table>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>; Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 13 Sep 2023 06:25:03 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[VOL.3994]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://m.wufazhuce.com/one/4127]]><description>&lt;div>;13 Sep. 2023&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;main&quot;>; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;http://image.wufazhuce.com/FniTvN-laA6HCIL3j5DUE2-vNTWP&quot; alt=&quot;Homepage Picture&quot; />; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;VOL.3994&lt;/span>;Illustration | Hu Yifan&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;13&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sep. 2023&lt;/p>; &lt;div>;&lt;/div>; &lt;p>; Someone once asked me, among the many touching qualities of your parents, which one has the greatest impact on you?
