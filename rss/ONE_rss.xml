data-source=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://image.wufazhuce.com/FvCwIvqV9fA1VZMuvTtpeiVPWixy&quot;>;&lt;/div >;&lt;div>;&lt;div style=&quot;font-size:26px;line-height: 1;&quot;>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;In the process of dying, a person sees all the misses and regrets in life moment. Living is a difficult race, and getting a head start is an unattainable privilege. &lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;1&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;When I woke up, I saw Lu Xiaobei sitting on the edge of the hospital bed, wiping away tears. I said, what? Farewell to the body? When she saw that I was awake, she wiped a few random things on my face with her hands and said, &quot;Bah, bah, bah, what time is it? It&#39;s not clear yet.&quot; It was approaching evening at this time, and the early autumn sunshine was very soft, with yellow and red colors. It reflected on her face through the gauze curtain, with mottled light and shadow. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I said, Mrs. Qi, please come. She said, want to sit? I said, hmm. She quickly got up and walked to the end of the bed, shaking the rocker. I felt my body slowly lifting, as if I was ascending. I said, when did you come? She said she had just arrived. I said, there is no need to run every day and put in more trouble. She ignored me, took out an apple from the plastic bag on the table, sat back in her chair, and peeled it. I also want to say, don’t bother, I can’t eat it. The words came to my lips and I swallowed them back. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Today is the third round of chemotherapy. I used a targeted drug called Jialuohua. It sounds like words from Buddhist scriptures. One injection costs 10,000 yuan. After the first chemotherapy, I lost my sense of taste, my tongue was always numb, and everything I ate tasted tasteless. In fact, it doesn&#39;t matter. It doesn&#39;t matter whether you eat it or not. You can&#39;t keep it anyway and you will have to vomit it out sooner or later. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Stomach pain is an old problem. It comes and goes with no pattern. When it hurts, it feels like someone is driving a nail into the stomach. The company arranges physical examinations every year, but nothing has ever been found, so I didn&#39;t take it seriously. I thought that as a young and strong person, it would be fine if I turned around. A month ago, I vomited blood, not much, but I was shocked. When I went for another check-up, as soon as the results came out, the doctor briefly glanced at me and asked if I had any family members following me. I said, just tell me, it can’t be cancer, right? After saying that, I smiled a little. The doctor didn&#39;t smile. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;It was Qi Ran who helped me get in touch with the hospital. It was the best specialist hospital in Beijing. He was very unruly. I would definitely not have any beds if I came by myself. Ever since he got close to Lu Xiaobei, I rarely had contact with him, and this time too, I didn&#39;t want to tell him, but I couldn&#39;t resist my mother&#39;s quick talk, so she called him in tears. On the day of going through the hospitalization procedures, Qi Ran was busy upstairs and downstairs, working as a reminder all day long. My mother told me that Xiao Qi is an interesting friend and you are the right one. Lu Xiaobei was there that day, and I didn&#39;t expect Qi Ran to bring her. When Lu Xiaobei saw me, his eyes became as moist as melted ice. I glared at Qi Ran next to me, meaning, is this necessary? Qi Ran didn&#39;t look at me at all, he was pretending to help my mother carry the bag. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;During the next period of time, Qi Ran was too busy and came less frequently. Lu Xiaobei comes every day and does a lot of examinations with me. Gastroscopy, CT, genetic testing, biopsy pathology, etc., from morning to night. The test results were not ideal. No need to ask, it was written all over the faces of my mother and Lu Xiaobei. I said, what&#39;s going on now? There is no need to hide it, I was the first to discover it. Lu Xiaobei turned away. My mother said, son, it’s okay, we don’t need surgery. She said this with a smile, which was worse than crying. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Later I learned that retroperitoneal lymph node metastasis is a distant metastasis and is a stage four disease. To put it bluntly, it is late-stage gastric cancer. More importantly, there was already ascites, so surgery was pointless. I asked the doctor, how long can I live? The doctor smiled and said, &quot;Don&#39;t be afraid, young man. I have a patient who is much more serious than you. He survived for more than eight years and is still alive and kicking now.&quot; I said, doctor, let’s not give an example, just follow common sense. How long will it take? The doctor heard someone calling him in the next ward and went out. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Lu Xiaobei told me that he asked my mother to go back and rest. She was on duty today. The old lady has lost a lot of weight recently, the lines on her face have become increasingly steeper, and her waist has slumped, like a stray dog ​​that has been hungry for a long time. Sometimes I really want to tell her, just leave me alone and let her do whatever she wants. What came out of her mouth was, Mom, I&#39;m fine, I feel much better recently. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Lu Xiaobei handed me the peeled apple, and I took a bite. It tasted like chewing gum, and I couldn’t spit it out in front of her, so I had to hold it in my mouth. After a while, Qi Ran came, said hello to me, and patted Lu Xiaobei on the shoulder, as if she was being tortured and not me. When Lu Xiaobei turned around, I spit out the apple in my mouth and hid it under the quilt. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I said, Lao Qi, I just dreamed of you. Lu Xiaobei was staring at me with a suspicious look on his face. Qi Ran said, what did you dream about me? I said, I dreamed of a long-distance running competition. At the sports meeting of my sophomore year of high school, I saw you trying to trap me. I tried my best to swing my legs, but I couldn&#39;t outrun you. Lu Xiaobei stretched out his hand and said, &quot;Stop hiding it. Where did you vomit?&quot; I took out the apple from under the quilt and stuffed it into her hand. Qi Ran said, you remembered wrongly, that time you wanted to trick me, and everyone else except me let you trick me. In the end, you were first and I was second. I asked Lu Xiaobei, is this true? Lu Xiaobei threw the apple I spit out into the trash can, sighed and said, I don’t remember. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Lu Xiaobei and Qi Ran are both my high school classmates. When I was a freshman in high school, Qi Ran and I were in the same class, and Lu Xiaobei was in another class. In the second year of high school, the classes were re-divided according to liberal arts and science. Lu Xiaobei and I were in the liberal arts class, and Qi Ran was in the science class. Qi Ran and I both like running. We would run around the playground twice if we had nothing to do. Lu Xiaobei likes to watch us running. He sits in the stands and builds an awning with his hands, as if he is saluting us. When running, I always have trouble controlling my pace, sometimes going faster and sometimes slower. Can&#39;t blame me. Qi Ran is about the same height as me, maybe a little taller, but his legs are too long. According to my observation, for every one step he takes, I need to take two steps, otherwise I can&#39;t keep up. So every time after running, he was calm and relaxed, but I was huffing and puffing. At this time, Lu Xiaobei would hand each of us a bottle of mineral water. I always feel that she should take out a handkerchief to wipe our sweat. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;When I first met Qi Ran, there was something I didn’t quite understand. I didn’t see how hard he worked, but when his results came out, he always beat me. I have studied carefully. In the three main subjects, we are about the same in mathematics. I am a little better than him in Chinese. The main gap is in English. Every time he falls behind me by a big margin. My English learning is no different from that of most people. Memorizing words, grammar, and sentence patterns is so standard that it doesn&#39;t feel like learning a language, but more like doing assembly line work. Of course, the common problem is the same: I can see but not speak, and my mouth gets stuck. Qi Ran is much better than me in this aspect. Not only does he have good grades, but he can also speak eloquently. Even his English teacher praised him for speaking English with a London accent. I asked Qi Ran about the secret, and he said it was taught by Uncle Barry. I said, who? He said that Uncle Barry, his parents&#39; business partner, lived in China all year round. Yellow hair, big nose, smokes Dubao, and drinks Erguotou. You speak Chinese very fluently. Have you eaten? Please be okay with you. Why don&#39;t you go? Damn it. Later, I became familiar with Qi Ran and I went to his house several times. His home is a duplex structure, decorated in European style, and the living room is big enough to play badminton. A huge plasma TV was placed in the middle, surrounded by large and small speakers. The TV cabinet was neatly stacked with popular movie DVDs at the time, and the effect was extremely shocking. His parents were away during the day, and an aunt named Gao looked after the house. Qi Ran said that Aunt Gao has been in his family for many years and is familiar with eight major cuisines. She is best at Sichuan cuisine. Uncle Barry likes to eat the boiled pork slices she makes. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;To be honest, I am not convinced. I think Qi Ran took advantage of knowing foreign friends, otherwise he might not be better than me. From then on, I fell in love with him and wanted to compete in everything. We had to stand on tiptoes even when we were taking pictures together. I have always been a competitive person since I was a child. My mother said that I am as stubborn as my father. My dad used to work as a maintenance man in a belt factory. When the belt factory was reorganized, it was privately contracted by the factory director. At the workers&#39; meeting, the factory director cried and told everyone that his ability was limited and he could only save the jobs of some people. My dad is among this group of people, but he doesn’t appreciate it at all. In front of everyone, he pointed at the factory director&#39;s nose and said, &quot;I work for the country, so I should get my share. If I work for you personally, who do you think you are?&quot; So I laid off my job, started working on my own, and set up a breakfast stall on the street in front of my house. When I came back from the stall, I sat in the living room and did nothing. I just drank peanuts and drank until I went to bed at night. When I was in the sixth grade of elementary school, my father died of a sudden cerebral hemorrhage. That morning, as he was about to take to the street, he suddenly felt dizzy and squatted on the ground for a long time without standing up. My mother advised him to go to the hospital, but he refused and lost his temper at my mother. Just a few steps out of the building, he fell straight to the ground. By the time he was taken to the hospital, he had already passed away. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I forced Qi Ran to participate in the sports meeting in my sophomore year of high school. After running for so long, we should carefully distinguish the winner and loser. Qi Ran and I made a bet, and whoever lost would not be allowed to use the bathroom in school for three days. Qi Ran smiled and said, I can&#39;t run away from you. I looked at him and said, who are you following? I don&#39;t care about it at all. He said with a smile, my father taught me that being friendly makes money, and the rest is all nonsense. I said, my dad also taught me that if you don’t compete with steamed buns and have a reputation, I don’t believe that I can’t compete with you in everything. Qi Ran said, no, at least there is one thing, you are better than me. I said, what is it? He smiled and didn&#39;t answer. I didn&#39;t take it seriously and continued, &quot;Don&#39;t talk nonsense. If you don&#39;t want to run away, please give me a nice word.&quot; Qi Ran said, it&#39;s okay to run, just forget it. I said, that won’t work, no matter whether you win or lose, you have to make a sound. Qi Ran thought for a while and said, let&#39;s do this. If I lose, I will do as you say. If you lose, just pretend it doesn&#39;t matter. I said, fuck, who are you trying to squeeze? If you want to just leave it like this, it&#39;s boring. Qi Ran saw that I was anxious and said quickly, &quot;Okay, let&#39;s do as you say, I will accompany you.&quot; I said, OK, this is still a human saying. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The dream I described to Qi Ran was the memory of the day of the sports meeting. I still remember that that day he was running a thousand and five. After he crossed the line, he squeezed in front of Lu Xiaobei and asked for a drink of water. For the next three days, I didn&#39;t drink any water. The first thing I did when I got home from school was to go to the toilet. But Qi Ran refused to admit it and insisted that I remembered it wrong. Later, Lu Xiaobei also agreed, saying that I had remembered it wrong. She remembered that day very clearly. I was first place, and the grade director even gave me a certificate. I wanted to scold him again, but after a few words I became tired and didn’t even know when I fell asleep. In the middle of it, I heard them talking quietly. Lu Xiaobei seemed to be crying again. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;After the third round of chemotherapy, the doctor brought good news. The cancer cell antigen had dropped to less than 300, and the highest was 630. I want to tell the doctor that there is no need to make you cough so much. The normal value is 0 to 5, which is too far off. Besides, I had a vague feeling that the pain had gotten worse recently, but I didn’t tell anyone. Despite this, my mother and Lu Xiaobei were still very happy and even hugged each other. That afternoon, Lu Xiaobei went home early. She said she hadn&#39;t showered in several days and felt stinky. My mother sat next to me and chatted. She said, What a wonderful daughter, but it’s a pity that my son is not blessed. I said, Mom. She said, originally, she always came to our house at that time, who would have thought it would be so cheap. After a pause, she shook her head and said, you can&#39;t say that, Xiao Qi is also a good boy. It’s not that you’re not blessed, it’s mom that’s not blessed. I choked up while talking. I quickly closed my eyes and pretended to sleep. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In high school, Lu Xiaobei was really clingy with me. He would often drag me shopping and then go to my house for dinner. She especially likes to eat the fried noodles made by my mother. In the summer, she pours some water into the pot and in the winter, she pours in my mother’s homemade meat sauce, mixes it with chopsticks, and makes a big bowl of it. Later, Qi Ran found out and went shopping with us, and also came to have a meal after shopping. I don’t understand. Lu Xiaobei is a girl. It’s not appropriate for us to go to her house, but why does it have to be at my house? My home is a small two-bedroom house of 50 square meters. It is an old house divided into my father&#39;s factory. The living room is so small that only two people can fit on the sofa. It is incomparable to Qi Ran&#39;s house. I mentioned several times that I could go to Qi Ran’s house to watch a movie, but neither of them responded. Once when he asked an urgent question, Lu Xiaobei stamped his foot, turned around and went home, glaring at me before going out. Qi Ran followed behind and actually glared at me. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;After graduating from high school, Lu Xiaobei and I went to different universities. Qi Ran was sent to study in England by his parents, and Uncle Barry had made arrangements for him. Before leaving, we went to the airport to see him off. Qi Ran leaned into my ear and said, &quot;Don&#39;t rush away.&quot; I was stunned by what he said and didn&#39;t react for a while. He pursed his lips in the direction of Lu Xiaobei. Lu Xiaobei was lying on the bright floor-to-ceiling window looking out. She wore a light blue dress that day, and her hair was dark and thick, hanging naturally on her shoulders. The sun was hanging high outside the window, the sunlight was pouring in, and the waiting hall was filled with brilliance. Lu Xiaobei&#39;s body glowed with a layer of white light, like an exquisite sculpture. She suddenly turned her head and grinned. My heart twitched violently, and I suddenly understood why I was better than Qi Ran. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;2&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Xiao Meng is the manpower of the company. When he came to see me, he had just finished the fifth round of chemotherapy. My weight I dropped from 130 pounds to 98 pounds, and my hair basically fell out. Lu Xiaobei found an electric clipper and simply shaved my bald head. After shaving, she brought me a mirror to show me. The face in the mirror was gloomy and pale, with no flesh and blood, leaving only a thin layer of scalp, loosely covering the head. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Lu Xiaobei and Qi Ran were both there that afternoon. Xiao Meng brought a bag of nutritional supplements with him and walked in with a smile on his face. He was stunned for a moment when he saw the two of them. I introduced them to each other. Xiao Meng sat down and chatted with me for a while, then fell silent. The atmosphere was a bit awkward. I took the initiative to ask, Xiao Meng, is there anything else? He smiled and said, It&#39;s okay, Brother Chen, I&#39;m here to see you on behalf of the company. I said, I&#39;m pretty good, help the leader take care of me. Xiao Meng nodded, still looking like he was hesitant to speak. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;After a while, Xiao Meng sighed and said, Brother Chen, let me tell the truth. The leader asked me to talk to you. I said, what to talk about? He said, talk about leaving the company. Lu Xiaobei suddenly interrupted and said, do you know what disease he has? Qi Ran tugged Lu Xiaobei&#39;s arm, but she shook him off. Xiao Meng glanced at me and said, I know. Lu Xiaobei said again, do you know why you are sick? Xiao Meng said, this is not clear. Lu Xiaobei said, I can tell you that it’s all about drinking. Xiao Meng looked at Lu Xiaobei, then at me, and sighed. Lu Xiaobei said, do you know who you drink for? Xiao Meng stopped talking. Lu Xiaobei was still aggressive and asked Xiao Meng, are you still embarrassed to talk? The tone was so high that it was almost harsh. Xiao Meng smiled bitterly and said, &quot;Sister, don&#39;t rush at me. I just work part-time, and it doesn&#39;t matter what I say.&quot; Lu Xiaobei still wanted to talk, so I waved my hand to her and told Xiao Meng, &quot;Brother, I have no problem, I can go through the formalities at any time.&quot; In addition, when you go back, tell your boss that I have medical insurance and will not be a drag on the company. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Xiao Meng came with resignation procedures. During the signing process, he scolded the leader for being unsympathetic and unjust, while constantly apologizing to me. Before leaving, he bowed to me with a solemn expression, as if I had turned into a black and white photo. Before signing, I winked at Qi Ran and asked him to persuade Lu Xiaobei to leave the ward first. I understand how Lu Xiaobei feels, but it’s just not necessary. Besides, I can’t talk about this with Xiao Meng. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;My disease is not only caused by drinking, but also by irregular eating. After graduating from college, I joined my current real estate company, starting as a salesperson and later transitioning to development. People in our industry don&#39;t have much to eat, and everyone is the same. Those who do sales depend on customer hours, those who do engineering depend on construction site hours, and those who do development depend on government hours. In short, it is up to you to decide when to catch up. Most of the wine shops are engaged in development. They start with half a pound of liquor at a time, occasionally mix in some foreign wine, and have countless beers. There&#39;s nothing you can do about it. In a human society, getting things done depends not only on money, but also on face. The leader once said that there is no problem that cannot be solved by a drink. If there is any problem, it must be because we did not drink enough. Alcohol is the fastest way to bring people closer. It may not be the best, but it is the easiest to use. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Drinking is not all about work. To be honest, I have an alcohol addiction. This thing is actually quite new, because I was born with an alcohol allergy. One cup causes my face to turn red, two cups to make me dizzy, and three cups to irritate my skin. When I first started drinking, to me, any drink was the same. Whether it&#39;s bitter or spicy, two words can sum it up - it tastes bad. Every time I drink alcohol, I feel like I&#39;m being tortured. After drinking alcohol, I always feel a subtle pain, as if someone is roasting my intestines over a low fire. Sometimes when I drink too much, my stomach becomes turbulent and stuck in my chest, unable to go up or down, so I have to run to the bathroom and pick my throat. After picking too much, the amount of alcohol increased by leaps and bounds. When it was time to drink, it was time to drink, and the time to drink became indispensable. Someone told me that beer is sweet and liquor is fragrant, but I don&#39;t feel it at all. But I still became addicted to alcohol, and what made me addicted was actually the fleeting courage after being drunk, and the delirium that made me forget everything. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I started drinking when I was about to graduate from college. During college, I still had contact with Lu Xiaobei, but not very frequently. The two schools are located on the north and south sides of Beijing, dozens of kilometers apart. Several times Lu Xiaobei took the initiative to ask me to meet, but I used the distance to talk him down. I admit that I was suppressing myself and deliberately maintaining an aloof relationship with Lu Xiaobei. I will always remember what Qi Ran said before leaving. I think it&#39;s better to maintain the status quo until he returns to China. In fact, I often have the urge to have further contact with Lu Xiaobei. But whenever this happens, I will immediately say to myself, this is a competition, the premise is fairness. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Qi Ran has always been in frequent contact with me. He often makes cross-border phone calls to share his experiences in the UK and inquire about the domestic situation. Almost every time, he ends with asking about Lu Xiaobei&#39;s current situation. He told me that London is known as the Fog City. In fact, there are only a few foggy days throughout the year, but it rains often. It rained irregularly and stopped within ten minutes. The city was always cold and damp. He missed the warmth and dryness of Beijing in his dreams. I told him that everything was fine in Beijing, and that everything was fine with Lu Xiaobei. I heard that two people had chased her, but both of them were rejected, so there was nothing to worry about. Qi Ran said, I don&#39;t worry about others, I worry about you. I said, everything is fine with me too, don’t think about it. He said, why are you pretending to be a grandson? What I&#39;m worried about is that you don&#39;t abide by the rules of the game. I said, sometimes I wonder, aren’t foreign girls bad? Blonde hair, blue eyes, big hips and thin waist, why have to stick to the firewood girl from China. Qi Ran was a little anxious after hearing this and asked me, did you get away? I said, don&#39;t be so impatient, keep your heart in your stomach, it&#39;s rare that I can win against you, and I won&#39;t let you find out the reason. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In the second half of the senior year, Qi Ran returned to China. At that time, I had just signed a three-party agreement with a financial website and became an online editor. The company is small and the daily work is simple and boring. My most proficient skill is copying and pasting news from other websites into my own website without marking the source or stating the reprint. The busiest times are during the market opening hours in the morning and afternoon. I need to stare at the computer all the time and pay attention to the news at any time. The department director is in his early thirties and speaks very arrogantly. He often emphasizes in regular meetings that even when the market is open, I have to poop at my desk. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I did a good job in that job, I was conscientious and responsible. At that time, the company had just developed a stock software that could realize all the functions of Great Wisdom level-2 and above. Some were even better than Great Wisdom, and there were no competitors on the market. According to the boss, it is equivalent to being one position ahead at the start. The company is very optimistic about the market prospects of the software. It is said that the director has also invested in the company and has become the boss&#39;s partner in this project. One time I met him in the toilet. The director shook his gadgets and patted my shoulder with the same hand and said, Xiao Chen, follow me and work hard, you will have a lot of potential in the future. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;During that time, Lu Xiaobei and I began to have frequent contacts. Can&#39;t blame me. She was an intern at an advertising company, and she happened to be in the same office building as me. We couldn&#39;t see each other when we looked up, and I really couldn&#39;t continue to play the no-war card. We often have dinner together, but we only talk about work, not about romance. Occasionally, she would show some resentment in her words, but I pretended not to know. This is the greatest restraint I can do. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;After Qi Ran came back, he invited Lu Xiaobei and I to dinner. After not seeing each other for a few years, he has grown taller again, and the gap between him and me is obviously widening. The skin color also turned white, as if infected by a foreigner. When he first sat down, he pulled out a chair for Lu Xiaobei, with one hand behind his back and the other stretched forward, like a polite young gentleman, which made Lu Xiaobei cover his mouth in joy. During the whole process, the two of them talked to each other and chatted endlessly. I seldom interrupted and kept my head down while eating. I found that Qi Ran had a very close relationship with Lu Xiaobei in recent years, but he never mentioned it in front of me. I was a little angry, but when I thought about it carefully, I felt it was unreasonable. Qi Ran did nothing wrong, and the rules did not prohibit him from contacting Lu Xiaobei. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;When he was about to finish eating, Lu Xiaobei got up and went to the bathroom. Qi Ran and I sat opposite each other, neither of us spoke. After holding it in for a long time, I couldn&#39;t help but hurt him. You can do it. You can build the plank road openly and cross Chencang secretly. Qi Ran spread his hands and smiled at me innocently. I said, since you are back, can the game begin? Qi Ran suddenly said to me seriously, &quot;Chen Mo, to be honest, don&#39;t listen, you are quite childish.&quot; I was stunned and didn&#39;t understand what he meant. Qi Ran said, if I were you, I wouldn&#39;t care about any rules or irregularities at all. I smiled and said, foreigners are not honest, right? He said, no kidding, I&#39;m serious. I said, if you say that, you are losing interest. Is fair competition still wrong? Qi Ran shook his head and said that being obsessed with fairness is naive. I said, okay, just be childish if you call it childish. He said, I have always known that Lu Xiaobei likes you, and you also like her, I can see it. I didn&#39;t answer any questions. He continued, &quot;She has been waiting for you to clarify, but I don&#39;t understand, why don&#39;t you open your mouth?&quot; I adjusted my sitting posture, trying to look calmer. Qi Ran said, later I figured it out, you have low self-esteem. I said, shut up. Qi Ran smiled and said, Lao Chen, what I want to tell you is that in fact, I have never regarded you as an opponent. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;When I came to my senses, I was already riding on Qi Ran, and my fists fell like raindrops. I said, you know what a dick, does it have anything to do with you that I don’t feel inferior? If you want Lu Xiaobei, I can give it to you, I don’t fucking care. Three-legged toads are hard to find, and two-legged women are plentiful. Qi Ran&#39;s nose dripped blood, and he said with a half-smile, &quot;No woman here can compare to Lu Xiaobei.&quot; I found that when he spoke, his eyes were not looking at me, but looking behind me. I turned my head, and Lu Xiaobei was standing there, biting his lips. I don&#39;t know how long he had been standing there. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Two months later, one day when the market was open, Qi Ran sent a text message with only a few words: Lu Xiaobei and I are getting along. I put down my phone, picked it up again, and reread it word for word. Putting down my phone again, I looked at the computer screen and then at my colleagues who were working around me. Suddenly, I felt that the office was as empty as a wilderness, the space was extending infinitely, and everything in sight was moving away from me. I understand that everything is business as usual. What makes me feel empty are floor-to-ceiling windows, cubicles, shadows, London rain, my mother’s noodles, and loneliness. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Another month later, the company went bankrupt. The reason was that the software was not authorized by the China Securities Regulatory Commission and was reported by users. Software revenue was deemed illegal income, with a case value of more than 100 million. The boss is a fat middle-aged man in his fifties. I heard that his family ran away to Norway and lived in a small town called Trondheim, where they can see the magical aurora every year. The director was also deeply involved and lost contact after the incident. Some people say that he took the blame for his boss and is serving his sentence in prison. Some people also say that he can run faster than his boss. He is currently in Tibet, drinking butter tea all day long and watching the colorful wind horse flags fluttering in the wind. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I received one month’s salary as compensation. I haven&#39;t told anyone about this, including my mother. For a long time after that, I still went out on time and came home on time, pretending to be working normally. Every morning, I take a bus with no idea where it ends. I ride all the way to the terminal. After getting off, I change to another bus, and so on. Later, my student card ran out of money, so I switched to traveling by bicycle. Start from home and walk along the Third Ring Road. When you get tired, you will stop and sit on the curb to rest. Keep riding as long as you are not tired, and ride until you are tired. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;That’s when I started drinking, not for self-harm, but as a substitute for sleeping pills. It was difficult for me to fall asleep in those days. I spent the whole night staring at the ceiling, watching the morning light fall on my body through the curtains. I often had the illusion that I was covered in snow. My mother quickly discovered the abnormality and asked me why I was drinking. I said, the company has a lot of entertainment, so practice. My mother said, is there something on your mind? Don&#39;t hold it in, talk to mom. I said, it’s okay, I’m just too tired recently to relieve my fatigue. My mother said, son, your health is the most important, living well is better than anything else, but you can’t imitate your father. He was the hands-off shopkeeper, and it was your mother who suffered the hardship. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Three months after the company closed down, I had almost spent all the money I had. During this period, I submitted a lot of resumes, covering all walks of life, and interviewed many companies, but most of them came to nothing. Being hired by my current real estate company was by chance. I don’t even remember sending my resume to them. The interview process went smoothly. The interviewer only asked a few simple questions and immediately informed me that I was hired, which made me suspect that I had encountered a scammer. After joining the company, I was assigned to do sales on a new project in Changping. That place is deserted and far away. Every day I take the bus, take the subway, get off and then walk, which takes two hours one way. It&#39;s not too far for me, and the journey is just as bumpy as I wanted it to be. I imagined myself as an ascetic, braving the cold and heat just for inner peace. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Qi Ran took over from his parents and started international trade. He went to various high-end places in suits and leather shoes every day, and became a businessman like his parents. Two years after graduating from college, he married Lu Xiaobei. After marriage, Lu Xiaobei had no job and became a full-time housewife. Their wedding was held in a high-end hotel near China World Trade Center and was extremely luxurious. Qi Ran sent me an invitation letter and I arrived as scheduled, but did not enter the auditorium.我给门口的登记人留下了两个红包。一个给齐冉，写着：你赢了。另一个给陆小北，写着：对不起。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;3&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;病情还是恶化了。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;第六次化疗之后，我变得无比虚弱，全身像散了架一样，连走路的力气都没了，是我妈和陆小北一人一边把我架回病房的。这几天，疼痛感已经不局限在胃部了，哪儿哪儿都疼，但又说不上具体是哪儿，反正浑身难受，一宿一宿睡不着。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;有一天医生来查房，我妈和陆小北跟医生商量，要给我增加止疼药的剂量。医生没有回答，而是用眼神示意她们出去谈谈。等谈完回来，两个人眼圈儿都发红，明显是刚刚哭过。我什么都没问，自己的身体自己清楚，我知道，我的时间不多了。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;那天傍晚，日头西沉，齐冉来接陆小北。我想跟齐冉单独聊聊，让我妈和陆小北出去了。齐冉穿着一身笔挺的西服，坐在病床边的椅子上，先是松了松自己的领带，又解开了领口的两个扣子。他的目光在窗帘和棚顶之间游移着，始终没有看我。我这才意识到，我们已经很久没有单独相处了。我笑着说，老齐，你丫紧张了。齐冉看向我，也笑了。我说，这回好了，先冲线的一定是我，谁也拦不住。齐冉说，别胡说八道，好好养着，如果这家医院不行，咱就换一家，如果还不行，我可以联系国外的医院。我摇了摇头说，老齐，你知道我最讨厌你哪点吗？他说，不知道。我说，我最讨厌你的善良，永远带着一股居高临下的劲儿。他看着我，似乎想说点儿什么，被我伸手拦住了。我说，一直以来，我在意的都不是输赢，而是公平。现在我明白了，还是你说得对，连死亡都是不公平的，还有什么好争的？天完全黑了下来，齐冉走到门口把灯打开了。突然亮起的强光晃得我睁不开眼，我用一只手蒙住眼睛说，老齐。他说，哎。我说，我为当初的事儿向你道歉。齐冉说，早翻篇儿了。我说，帮我照顾照顾我妈。齐冉没有说话，我听见他叹了口气，接着感到他在我的另一只手上轻轻拍了两下。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;齐冉临走的时候问我，要不要叫陆小北进来，让我们单独聊会儿。我笑眯眯地看着他，压根儿没搭茬儿。齐冉拍了自己的脑门儿一下，说，真他妈不长记性。我说，回去路上慢点儿，最好别让齐太再来了。我特地在齐太两个字上加了重音。等他们走了，我妈进来了。她在我旁边坐了一会儿，终于没忍住，呜咽起来。我挣扎着坐起身，抱住了她。我妈死死地抱紧我，一边哭一边嘶喊，你们爷俩全都是王八蛋，我恨你们，把我也带走吧，我也不想活了。几个听到动静的护士在门口站着，没有过来制止。我同样哭着跟我妈说，妈，对不起，对不起。我们的后背都被彼此的眼泪沾湿了，我感到彻骨的冰冷，仿佛寒冬早至。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;不知道从什么时候开始，我陷入了断断续续的昏睡。有时醒来，有种刚刚睡下就被人叫醒的烦躁，有时又像是睡了一个世纪之久，疲惫不堪。病床边的人也在不断变化。我妈，陆小北，齐冉，医生，护士，轮番出现。有一次醒来，似乎还见到了几个走动得比较勤的亲戚。我的身上不知何时插上了几根管子，床头也摆上了一台监控器，屏幕上是花花绿绿的线条和密密麻麻的数字。那些数字我看不懂，但有条绿色的线我明白了，它在随着我的心跳而波动，划出一个一个对勾。我的生命变成了可视化的图形，我明白，当图形变成单调的一字时，我就会死去。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;记得电视剧里常有类似的情节，一个人在临死之时，紧紧攥住挚爱亲朋的双手，尽力说出只言片语，或承认些什么，或否认些什么，给自己做个总结，也给生者留个念想。那些镌刻在生命中的记忆，会像走马灯一样，在脑中一幕幕闪现，最后停留在某个印象最深的画面上，然后戛然而止，生命就此逝去。实际上，我没有这样的感觉。经历过一次次短暂的昏迷和间歇性的清醒后，我根本没有说话的力气，也没有说话的欲望。我的脑中空空如也，只是觉得很累，很困，只想好好休息，不想被任何人打扰。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;再醒来时，我发现自己站在学校的运动场里。看台上稀稀拉拉地坐着一些人，陆小北就在上面。她穿着高中时的校服，手搭凉棚，微笑注视着我。我妈我爸也在，还有小孟，部门总监，一些我认识的其他人。看台上的人都在向我挥手叫好。我回过头，看见齐冉站在旁边，已经穿上了运动服，披着一件白底儿黑字的号坎儿。侧面站着一名老师，举着发令枪对我说，这位同学，请尽快做好准备。我低头看了看，自己身上也披着同样的号坎儿。站到起跑线上，我弓起脊背，微微下蹲，做好了准备。我感到旺盛的精力不断从身体溢出，快要将我淹没。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;枪响，摆腿，蹬地，一气呵成。我像一只离弦的利箭一样蹿出，直射向跑道的前方。柔和的风如同一只温柔的手，抚摸着我，使我浑身舒畅。我转过头，看见齐冉正在肉眼可见地被我甩开，变得越来越小，最后成了一个小小的黑点。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;突然，一道绿色的闪电在我面前的天空划过，呈一字型，宛如一柄利刃。我没有停步，继续向前跑着，感到前所未有的安宁。 &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;责任编辑：李嘉龙&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;征稿信息见@ONE一个工作室置顶微博。更多编辑部的有趣日常请关注小红书：ONE一个编辑部。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;作者&lt;/p>; &lt;hr style=&quot;margin-top: 15px;&quot;/>; &lt;table>; &lt;tr>; &lt;td style=&quot;width: 50px;&quot;>; &lt;img src=&quot;http://image.wufazhuce.com/FmeP5rZ0UGuNGbmhXfqoEh6dpKK5&quot; alt=&quot;二老坏&quot;>; &lt;/td>; &lt;td>; &lt;div>;二老坏 &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10px&quot;>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div style=&quot;&quot;>;人如其名&lt;/div>; &lt;/td>; &lt;td width=&quot;60px&quot;>; &lt;!-- &lt;span onclick=&quot;OneAPP.openDetail(2, )&quot;>;关注&lt;/span>; -->; &lt;/td>; &lt;/tr>; &lt;/table>; &lt;p>;相关推荐&lt;/p>; &lt;hr/>; &lt;table>; &lt;tr>; &lt;td style=&quot;width: 40px;&quot;>; &lt;span>;阅读&lt;/span>; &lt;/td>; &lt;td>; &lt;a href=&quot;/article/6111&quot; data-ajax=&quot;false&quot;>; &lt;div>;孤儿院&lt;/div>; &lt;div>;文/ 二老坏&lt;/div>; &lt;/a>; &lt;/td>; &lt;/tr>; &lt;/table>; &lt;table>; &lt;tr>; &lt;td>; &lt;div style=&quot;text-align:center;padding:5px;&quot; onclick=&quot;OneAPP.openDetail(2,6161)&quot;>;点击可下载ONE一个app&lt;/div>;&lt;/td>; &lt;/tr>; &lt;/table>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 12 Nov 2023 06:25:02 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[VOL.4054]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://m.wufazhuce.com/one/4202]]><description>&lt;div>;12 Nov. 2023&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;main&quot;>; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;http://image.wufazhuce.com/Fv3hc_hHXxGy0Lq2XgWYlafb2gVy&quot; alt=&quot;首页图&quot; />; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;VOL.4054&lt;/span>;摄影| Ben Griffiths&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;12&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Nov. 2023&lt;/p>; &lt;div>;&lt;/div>; &lt;p>;有的人哦，支持什么，就给什么丢人，主张什么，就给什么抹黑。&lt;/p>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 12 Nov 2023 06:25:02 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
