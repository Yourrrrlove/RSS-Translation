&lt;div>; &lt;p>;Text/Ren Shuoran&lt;/p>; &lt;div>; &lt;p>;&lt;div contenteditable=&quot;false&quot;>;&lt;img data-author=&quot;&quot; data-original-src=&quot;http://image.wufazhuce.com/Fp3XnLSiVxDQ3VNMEkaKmXQicdS7&quot; data-source=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://image.wufazhuce.com/Fp3XnLSiVxDQ3VNMEkaKmXQicdS7&quot;>;&lt;/div >;&lt;div>;&lt;div style=&quot;font-size:26px;line-height: 1;&quot;>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;As a female intellectual with a sense of introspection, &quot;looking&quot; is Tian Qin &#39;s Achilles&#39; heel. The topic of a thesis was chosen, but the balance between looking and not looking was shaky. The more she was stared at, the more she had to stare at others. &lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;1&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;At first, it was Lao Wang who pulled Tian Qin into that group. Lao Wang is Tian Qin&#39;s boyfriend. He is 28 years old. He and Tian Qin have been in love for six years, from Tian Qin&#39;s sophomore year to his last year as a graduate student. When Lao Wang was a student, he liked to join forums about cars, decoration, and digital electronics. In the era when forums were declining, Lao Wang&#39;s friends moved from forums to WeChat. Lao Wang was drawn into various WeChat groups, including those who bought houses, collected credit cards, shared coupons, scolded women, and even told dirty jokes. The group that Lao Wang dragged Tian Qin into was a group that specialized in talking about girls, or to be more precise, it was a group that shared how to chat with girls, pursue girls, and even sleep with girls in the end. Knowing that Lao Wang has such a group, Tian Qin is actually not angry at all. Tian Qin is the kind of person who has a clear vision and a clear heart, and can handle everything very clearly. She majored in philosophy, studying the philosophy of the body, especially the female body. It can be said that it was the ideas of the people in that group that led to the vigorous development of the subject Tian Qin studied. In the past few years, from the Mi Rabbit Movement in the United States to Room N in South Korea to middle-aged domestic actresses complaining about not being able to act, Tian Qin’s professionalism has been relevant to hot searches every time. Her tutor, a master&#39;s tutor who has &quot;learned both Chinese and Western knowledge&quot; in this field, has been offering courses for money on major paid knowledge websites, and the lecture notes were compiled by Tian Qin and her fellow students. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Philosophy of the female body, simply put, is the study of how the female body is gazed at by men, and the reasons for such gaze. The female body is cut based on the male perspective, such as the current beauty culture, the Victoria&#39;s Secret show, the Produce 101 girl group, and female celebrities losing weight and gaining weight on hot searches. These are all things Tian Qin wants to study. Now Tian Qin is about to start a research topic, but only two research questions have been found. The tutor said that the two research questions were a bit weak and asked her to look at his published articles and think of another one. After that, he patted her on the shoulder. Tian Qin felt that a piece of his shoulder had collapsed where he had been patted, and what followed was unwillingness to do so. She didn&#39;t want to talk to him about this issue again, and the result would still be the same. It was impossible for the tutor to let his students use other people&#39;s theories as a framework, even if his theory could not support a master&#39;s thesis. In the words of the instructor, theory must be developed. He is the leader and lays the foundation. His students have to build the building. The higher you build, the more likely you are to become famous. When engaging in philosophy, you must pay attention to inheritance. Tian Qin had no choice but to list the practical significance of the theory in a separate chapter and study it as a problem. Studying this issue requires a realistic context. For this reason, Tian Qin begged Lao Wang to join her in the group. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;You can talk about whatever you want, Tian Qin said, just treat me as air. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In this way, Tian Qin became the second woman in this group. There are about 300 people in the entire WeChat group, and there was only one woman before. When Tian Qin entered the group, there was a small climax in the group. After discovering that Tian Qin and Lao Wang were a couple, the group became excited. Tian Qin and Lao Wang were like two grains of rice thrown into a pot of boiling water, causing them to boil. One said, brother, you are really brave and careful. Leniency for confession? said another. Are you two going to play swap in the group? Several people looked excited. The words gradually got out of control. Tian Qin couldn&#39;t help it anymore and said, I want to write my graduation thesis, find some contextual information, and observe everyone&#39;s language and opinions. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The group burst into laughter. It doesn&#39;t matter, one said. If you hang around in this group, you will not only have material, but also stories and accidents. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Tian Qin posted a laughing emoticon in the group. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Sister, a person named &quot;Sister-in-law&quot; on WeChat said that your boyfriend is not active in this group. He probably has other groups. I suggest you go to other groups to supervise him. . &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;These words made Tian Qin feel a little uncomfortable, as if she was the kind of woman who always looked at a man&#39;s phone and couldn&#39;t live without him at all. There is no supervision. Tian Qin said, I just want to collect some linguistic viewpoints, complete a chapter of my thesis, and get the word count for the thesis. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Why bother, &quot;sister-in-law&quot; said, they are all women, no one knows who is who. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Please say goodbye, one person in the group said, you are not an ordinary woman, you are the sister-in-law and darling of all of us! &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The group laughed again, like a stone thrown into water, emoticons, jokes, and dirty jokes came one after another. Tian Qin watched the conversation in the excitement, feeling as if there was cotton wool in his heart and his throat was sore. The only woman in that group, she seemed to regard her as a rival. In a group of more than 300 people, there was only one woman before, and she was the queen of this group. Although she accepted the sexually suggestive flattery and compliments in this group, more than 300 people watched her once she opened the screen. When she opened the screen, she also exposed her not-so-pretty butt—Lao Wang showed her to Tian Qin. In the selfies taken in the group, under the smooth toning of the beauty camera, she could still tell that she was a little tired. The faint wrinkles at the corners of her eyes actually betrayed that she was not as energetic, capable of joking, and not as careless as she appeared in the group. Even in a sense, this is a lonely woman who relies on being stared at by men to dissolve the banality of daily life. She didn&#39;t expect that she was actually bodyized, objectified, commercialized, viewed, desired and even consumed by more than 300 men. Instead, she was so proud of it. She was really a woman who wasn&#39;t smart enough. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;After completing these slightly philosophical analyses, Tian Qin felt much better. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Tian Qin often does these analyses, which can be regarded as applying what he has learned. The overview of the introductory book &quot;History of Western Philosophy&quot; of the Department of Philosophy says that philosophy raises and studies problems but is not responsible for solving them. Therefore, studying philosophy is not of great use. In this era where everything is practical and efficient, bamboos like Wang Yangming&#39;s &quot;seven days and seven nights&quot; are heard as stories in the philosophy department. But Tian Qin likes this kind of realism, and hopes that he can become a little different because of this kind of realism in such an era. In a sense, Wang Yangming&#39;s &quot;unity of knowledge and action&quot; guides Tian Qin&#39;s study. In the current context, he is concerned about whether he is consumed and stared at as a woman, and participates in discussions on social media. Let feminist perspectives be heard by more people. Tian Qin is young and beautiful, and cares about the experiences of other women. She replies to private messages on Weibo one after another. Over time, she looks a bit like an emotional blogger, dealing with unspeakable emotional disputes. This can&#39;t help but make her a little frustrated. What really had something to do with her profession was Lao Wang&#39;s attitude towards her. Tian Qin and Lao Wang were together because he always respected her choice, never regarded her as his vassal, and never stared at her body. She can read useless body philosophy, and she doesn&#39;t have to worry about making money or getting married, he just depends on her. Of course, Tian Qin does not restrict him. Lao Wang can hold up a photo of Scarlett Johansson and discuss with her the sexy factors of the &quot;widow sister&quot;, and he can also tell her the unforgettable past of his first love. Tian Qin is a transparent person, and he does not like the love quotes that are widely circulated on social media such as &quot;There is only one you&quot; and &quot;We are each other&#39;s only one&quot;. In a sense, love should be free and equal, and it is always life or death. It is not at all unfair to the efforts of human beings to evolve to this level. In this sense, Lao Wang is a very qualified boyfriend. There is no one more suitable to be Tian Qin&#39;s boyfriend than Lao Wang. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;2&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Someone added Tian Qin’s WeChat account in the group. It turns out that Honda Qin didn&#39;t join. She just wanted to find some material to graduate smoothly. If some accident or story happened, she didn&#39;t know how to tell Lao Wang. Of course, Tian Qin can choose not to say it, but isn’t freedom and equality based on candor. Lao Wang knew about every relationship Tian Qin had before him, and also knew that she was pursued by many people. Tian Qin knew that Lao Wang liked European-style women, and even dragged Lao Wang to look at girls in the university cafeteria. While pulling Lao Wang to look at the girl, she forgot about the female body being stared at. But having said that, there is a difference between a woman being gazed at by a woman and being gazed at by a man. For example, when it comes to the girl who walks in front of them, Tian Qin thinks that she has graceful posture, dignified temperament, or is lively and attractive, with youthful eyebrows, while Lao Wang thinks that the girl&#39;s neck is not long enough, or her legs are a little short, in short, one is metaphysical, and the other is metaphysical. At this time, Tian Qin felt that it was boring. Men are always like this. They are visual animals and lower body animals. To be more intuitive, it is actually superficial viewing. A woman&#39;s gaze on a woman is a kind of appreciation, a kind of sympathy between the same sex, so it can penetrate deeper and reach understanding. When she saw that her skin was a bit dark, she would think that she might have been ridiculed by her classmates during her long adolescence, which was a period of loneliness and helplessness for young girls. Tian Qin was often moved by his own reveries, and he became more determined to be as sincere as Wang Yangming and to resist men&#39;s gaze on women. She even felt that women should, as the slogan of proletarian struggle calls out, women all over the world unite and appreciate each other. The more they are in front of men, the more noble and beautiful they must appear to set off the vulgarity of men and educate them at the same time. male. Tian Qin remembered that some of the luxury cars and delicacies often posted in that group were probably second-generation children who had no worries about food and clothing. Tian Qin became even more angry. Tian Qin could not let go of the men who were so proud of themselves for occupying social resources that women rarely had. Thinking of this, she agreed to add friends. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The person who added her is called Chen Weiyi. According to his circle of friends, he is thirty-three years old, married, has a three-year-old daughter, and works in the school office of Tian Qin&#39;s university. Tian Qin thought he added her to tell a story, but after adding Tian Qin, Chen Weiyi sent her a questionnaire link. The school office often conducts useless surveys, such as whether they are satisfied with the school&#39;s work and whether they have any suggestions for teachers&#39; teaching. They are always happy to do so. It seems that these problems can be improved after students fill out the questionnaire. As time went by, Tian Qin and the others stopped filling in the form. It seems that Chen Weiyi is under a lot of pressure to complete his work, and he seizes every opportunity to catch Tian Qin in the girl chat group. After Tian Qin finished filling it out, he sent the link to several classes, grades, and other groups, claiming that it was a questionnaire from a friend of his, calling on everyone to help, and sent a few more red envelopes, and finally completed Chen Weiyi&#39;s questionnaire. work goals. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Chen Weiyi seemed very happy and said that Tian Qin had done him a big favor and insisted that she wait for him in front of the administrative building on Wednesday afternoon. He had a small gift that he wanted to give her. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In April, when catkins were flying all over the sky, Tian Qin was fighting against the catkins under the willow tree in front of the administrative building. The catkins are thin and soft, and they are like a baby&#39;s hands gently scratching people&#39;s faces. Together with the spring breeze, they are warm and warm. But even such catkins will be put into the mouth without discrimination. In the nasal cavity. What touches the cheeks is enjoyment, but what enters the nose and mouth is annoying trouble, which may even be fatal in severe cases. Du Fu once said, &quot;The wild catkins dance with the wind, and the light peach blossoms chase the water.&quot; Yan Shu also said, &quot;The spring breeze does not release the poplar flowers, and they flutter in the faces of passers-by.&quot; For the poet, catkins are not only annoying, but also promiscuous. . What does such catkins feel like to people? It&#39;s like an affair. If handled properly, it can be beautiful, but it can also be dangerous. Tian Qin felt that he was really affected by some of the language in that group. This thought was a bit scary when he thought about it. She and Lao Wang are now on good terms. Even though she is an independent woman, she does not agree with the so-called view that whoever sleeps with is her. This view is that the female body is regarded as a appendage of the male, and women are still being treated as slaves. The object of the gaze. Just thinking about it, I was tapped on the shoulder:&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Hey, Tian Qin? &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Tian Qin was startled and looked up to see a tall, short-haired, young man. The man&#39;s face suddenly placed in front of Tian Qin&#39;s eyes and he looked at her carefully. Tian Qin was forced to look at him and found that he looked a bit like a simplified version of Tony Leung. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Hi, are you Chen Weiyi? Tian Qin suddenly realized, how do you know I am Tian Qin? &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The man smiled, his dark skin touched his thin lips, showing his big white teeth, and said, I guessed it, I just asked which one was the prettiest in front of the administration building. I didn’t expect that I actually got asked. Why is there a beauty like you in the Philosophy Department? I thought all the beauties were in the Foreign Languages ​​Department or the Chinese Department. You are the missing piece. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Tian Qin was a little annoyed that he was being admired like this. She dislikes the term &quot;beauty&quot; very much. &quot;Beauty&quot; means that she is a visual and consumable medium, which is a stereotype of female gender. She usually goes shopping for clothes. If the clothing store owner calls her this, she would rather not buy this piece of clothing. But nowadays, &quot;beauties&quot; are really bad. She can only correct others and say, just say what you say without adding prefixes. It makes people who call her beautiful baffled. But to his annoyance, Tian Qin found that he was actually looking at Chen Weiyi and felt that he looked like a simplified version of Tony Leung. They evened it out, thinking about it, and thought it would be good to joke around, but they were not forgiving, saying, &quot;Yes, I am the relic, so all of you are blind.&quot; &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Chen Weiyi smiled and said, his mouth is quite powerful. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;As he spoke, he led Tian Qin to the parking lot and took out a bag from the trunk for her. Before Tian Qin could say thank you, Chen Weiyi got in the car, stretched out his left hand from the window, and said, thank you. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Tian Qin opened the bag after returning and found that it was a set of Estee Lauder skin care products. This made Tian Qin a little embarrassed. Although she also likes Estee Lauder, she likes to buy it with her own money. And the little money she spent helping Chen Weiyi distribute red envelopes was nothing compared to Estee Lauder. They say etiquette is less important than friendship, but I don’t know how to explain it. Tian Qin was not sure what Chen Weiyi meant, so he had to thank him cheerfully on WeChat and find another opportunity to return it. When dealing with Chen Weiyi, Tian Qin was sure that she didn&#39;t have to be sincere and truthful. This was probably the feeling that the WeChat group gave her. Besides, he also has a wife and daughter, so he is probably rich and willful. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The WeChat group often shares short videos of young women drinking and dancing in the city’s KTV. Tian Qin knew that there was a bar street on Renmin Road, with countless such bars and KTVs on both sides of the street. One weekend, Tian Qin took Lao Wang&#39;s electric car back to Lao Wang&#39;s house and passed by there. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;It is midsummer, and the green clouds and fragrant mist in front of the bar are quite similar to the &quot;Gold Sales Cave&quot; in the novel. The young girls wore hot pants and short skirts, exposed their shoulders and navels, and shot various short videos with their mobile phones. It&#39;s a long way out. Tian Qin felt that the smell of the perfume had not dissipated and was still lingering on her and Lao Wang&#39;s clothes. Back at Lao Wang&#39;s house, Tian Qin asked if all men like to go to bars. Of course Lao Wang knew what Tian Qin meant. After taking off her clothes, Lao Wang buried his face in Tian Qin&#39;s breasts and said, I don&#39;t like to go there, but I just like here. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Lao Wang is indeed a good marriage partner. In addition to the two people getting along without much quarrels and having similar outlooks, Lao Wang also has a stable mood, a stable job, a regular life, simple family relationships, and a similar family background to Tian Qin. His family has bought the house where they got married, and this is the one they live in now. Both parents knew about their relationship and were satisfied with it. After Tian Qin graduates from graduate school, studies for a Ph.D., or gets a stable job, she will get married. Lao Wang is the biggest stabilizer in the relationship between two people. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;But after having sex that day, the stable Lao Wang said something that made Tian Qin unstable: It would be better if your butt was raised a little more. Tian Qin therefore ignored Lao Wang for half a month. How come she didn&#39;t dislike him for Lao Wang&#39;s lack of chest muscles and lack of body, so why could he stare at her body and make comments? Tian Qin was awkward for a long time. But when she had an argument with Lao Wang, she stopped with just one sentence. Lao Wang said, you didn&#39;t take the initiative to say that I don&#39;t have breast muscles and I&#39;m not strong. It&#39;s because you didn&#39;t take the initiative to say it. I just said it. We are equal. . &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;This sentence made Tian Qin think about it for a long time. This also made her firmly choose to study the philosophy of the female body until she graduated with a PhD. In adolescence, Tian Qin&#39;s mother began to criticize her. When she was serving the second bowl of rice, her mother would say that girls would gain weight if they ate so much. When she fell in love with something unconventional and wanted to perm her hair, her mother would say that it was unladylike. When she finally became what her mother wanted in college - thin and with long, straight black hair, her mother sighed in front of her again, saying that she was a little too thin and that it would not be conducive to breastfeeding when she got married in the future. He said she looked dull, not lively, and didn&#39;t know how to do her hair. Tian Qin was shocked and puzzled by her mother&#39;s inconsistent thoughts. It was not until she learned body philosophy that she realized that her mother&#39;s criticism during her growth was just a reflection of the harsh treatment of women&#39;s bodies by men. In other words, the mother doesn’t want this. She is also unconsciously disciplining her daughter and letting her grow into a woman who is liked by men according to men’s standards. Tian Qin even discovered that this kind of thinking is a form of thinking that has been passed down for thousands of years. From the three-inch golden lotus to the view that thinness is beautiful and that a big butt is conducive to fertility, they are all manifestations of the objectification of the female body. It seems that women&#39;s bodies should be stared at harshly. Even if women themselves are not harsh on themselves, there are always people who are harsh on women. On the day when the college entrance examination ends, many beauty salon advertisements outside the examination room accurately target people from the examination room. For girls who come out of love - because one day men will be harsh to women. It is better to let women be strict with their bodies first than for men to be strict with women one day. This is the original intention of young women’s plastic surgery and liposuction. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In that WeChat group, Tian Qin could see more than 300 men staring harshly at women. From blind dates or dating, to girls they meet in bars or KTVs, they can all talk about whether their skin is white, whether their eyes are big or not, whether their breasts are plump or not, and whether they have had plastic surgery. A strange girl, in that group, was searched from inside to outside, top to bottom, just like the selection of oiran in ancient times, without the girls knowing. There is even a plastic surgeon in the group who can explain clearly which part of the girl&#39;s body was plastic surgery based on the photos, and what kind of surgery was performed, from orthognathic surgery to nose and breast augmentation to bone removal. Tian Qin felt pain in a certain part of his body just by looking at those words. The plastic surgeon finally advertises his plastic surgery hospital, which is a perfect example of the perfect combination of capital logic and patriarchal culture. In these discussions, Chen Weiyi never spoke. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;3&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Tian Qin&#39;s &quot;why&quot; finally came out. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Tian Qin saw the most real and harsh gaze of men on women, and felt sorry for every analyzed girl who appeared in the group. But she still has papers to finish. She thought bitterly that all these men should go to hell. But hell is not certain to exist. Tian Qin could only be more serious in his heart and try to express his attitude in some way. The Estee Lauder Tianqin set given by Chen Weiyi must not be kept, and it is not in line with her consistent principles, and it goes against her basic attitude towards the WeChat group. Tian Qin sent a red envelope to Chen Weiyi. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;He did not click accept. Tian Qin had no choice but to buy things and send them back. Thinking that his daughter had been posted in his circle of friends, looking like a daughter slave, Tian Qin went to the mall and bought the most expensive Barbie doll suit. Tian Qin has her own little calculation. She has bought all the Barbie dolls, so it’s hard not to accept them. After all, she has passed the age of playing with dolls, and there is no one else to give them to. More importantly, she has passed the age of playing with dolls. , taking the doll back, it finally reminded Chen Weiyi of his wife, and the most important thing was to remind Chen Weiyi that Tian Qin was not the kind of person he thought. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Although Tian Qin did not investigate carefully what kind of person he was. Although there are rumors from classmates that are half fact and half kitsch, there are always some young women who are willing to exchange their bodies for something, such as a mobile phone, a computer, a set of cosmetics or even a lipstick. When I attended a class taught by a professor at the School of Liberal Arts who studied women&#39;s literature, the female professor once seriously told the story of a girl from the School of Art who took advantage of youth and time and turned into a canary. Girls should love themselves, the professor said sincerely, and don’t be vain! &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Tian Qin doesn’t think there is anything wrong with girls’ vanity or this kind of exchange. She even believes that &quot;vanity&quot; is just the attribution people make when summing up these things afterwards. The distance between the real cause and the attribution is probably as far as the distance between the Forbidden City in Shenyang and the Forbidden City in Beijing. Moreover, &quot;exchange&quot; is, in a sense, the beginning of women realizing the value of their bodies. But the body is your own, and the exchange must be for real pleasure. The pleasure brought by material things is always short-lived and cannot be called true and pure pleasure. But Tian Qin didn&#39;t know what pure pleasure was, maybe it was sex, maybe it was something else. She hasn&#39;t thought this far yet. However, after giving away the Barbie doll, Chen Weiyi communicated more with her. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;On the day when the doll was given to Chen Weiyi, he looked at the things in her hand and said, Give me a papaya and give me a Qiongju in return. You don’t even ask me if I need this Qiongju. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Then I don’t need this papaya, Tian Qin said. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Chen Weiyi squinted at Tian Qin, his eyes fell on her breasts, and said, there is really no need, yours is already very plump. Tian Qin was ashamed and angry, and Chen Weiyi&#39;s words were obviously flirting. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Tian Qin didn&#39;t want to talk to him, but he was also angry. He thought women were accustomed to being disciplined, gentle, respectful and frugal, but she was not like that today. Thinking of this, Tian Qin said, I really don&#39;t need papaya, but you may need something to supplement it, such as leeks, seafood and so on. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;She just kept going back and forth with Chen Weiyi. Chen Weiyi is very good, really very good, and even broke her previous stereotypes about the members of the WeChat group. He is very smart, and they don&#39;t take the initiative to meet each other. They just bump into each other sometimes on campus, smile and nod to each other. But there are always several WeChat messages sent to Tian Qin every day, just when Tian Qin is tired from writing papers or can’t stand reading the literature. These WeChat messages were not as explicit as the flirting he had with her in person. They were just trivial things in life and current affairs anecdotes. For example, Chen Weiyi sent him a fat cat that slipped out of the pet shop and chased a female cat. Video of a pet shop owner who was unable to get down from a 20-meter-high tree and was bullied by a bird. He had to call for help from a firefighter after holding his fat cat&#39;s mate and calling it to no avail. I was afraid that she wouldn’t want to watch the video, so I described it again in vivid words, and attached some vicious and wonderful comments. “The plot is quite twists and turns, the story is very bizarre, it combines the love triangle of cats, the sense of territory of birds, and the rescue.” The twists and turns, &quot;discussion of humanitarian and social resources&quot;, &quot;the first time I saw the news that people are nice, but cats are so bad&quot;, etc., made Tian Qin laugh so much that he burst into tears. Occasionally, if the conversation didn&#39;t go well, or she felt offended, she would leave him alone, and he would send her several interesting WeChat messages of tactful apology, making her reluctant to block him. If he doesn&#39;t receive Chen Weiyi&#39;s WeChat messages for a day or two, Tian Qin always feels empty in his heart, as if something is missing. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Chen Weiyi was going on a business trip for a month, so he told Tian Qin before the trip. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Tell me what to say, Tian Qin said, I am not yours. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;But in my heart you already are, Chen Weiyi said. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;What? What is it? Tian Qin asked deliberately. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Sister, Chen Weiyi said. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Tian Qin was filled with complex emotions of grief, anger, loss and sadness. She originally thought that she would not have so many emotions. Why, she was indeed not someone of his, she could be considered a friend. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Chen Weiyi’s next words made Tian Qin’s heart agitate again. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;It’s my loving sister, Chen Weiyi said. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Tian Qin’s face turned red little by little, then turned dull again. She seemed to have created a problem for herself. This problem is more difficult than a graduation thesis and has no solution. It is more difficult than all the love problems Tian Qin has encountered in the past. She didn&#39;t want to have anything to do with Chen Weiyi, but in fact it seemed like something was going to happen. At least she didn&#39;t refuse. Not only did she not refuse, she also enjoyed it. What Chen Weiyi has - thoughtfulness, liveliness, humor, and eloquence - are things that Lao Wang doesn&#39;t have. It turns out that Honda Qin thought that she did not desire these things, and she also believed that people do not live by these things, but she did not understand herself well enough, at least not as well as she thought she did. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;When Chen Weiyi was on a business trip, he had fewer WeChat messages and fewer jokes. When he is not busy, he should be on the phone with his wife, Tian Qin thought, and felt embarrassed by this kind of fussing. Tian Qin lost weight and explained to Lao Wang that he was busy with his graduation thesis. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;One day in June, Chen Weiyi asked her to meet outside the west gate. As soon as they met, Chen Weiyi was shocked and said, &quot;What happened to you? I left you for a month. How could you have done this to yourself?&quot; &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Nothing, Tian Qin felt that his smile was a little sad, and said, I am actually quite good, but I have been too tired from writing papers recently. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;What the hell, Chen Weiyi said, pulling her arm and taking her to eat. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;She and Chen Weiyi walked in tandem. He took a taxi and took her to a farmhouse in the countryside. It was the middle of the week, so there was no one at the farmhouse, and the vast swaths of wild flowers were in bloom. Tian Qin felt that she hadn&#39;t been so relaxed for a long time. She had been tense because of the paper and her relationship with Chen Weiyi. At this moment, the sky is dazzlingly blue and the flowers are blooming brilliantly. While eating, Chen Weiyi said, you know, one time you came in from the west gate with your classmates, and I saw you as soon as I left the administration building. You are so beautiful, you are so beautiful. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The word &quot;look&quot; has always been Tian Qin&#39;s Achilles&#39; heel. She doesn&#39;t like to be looked at. She feels beautiful just for herself. &quot;Looking&quot; means being stared at and judged. Even &quot;being different&quot; is also the result of judgment, which means that if she Tian Qin If she is with a more beautiful beauty, isn&#39;t it just mediocre? Can&#39;t she have her own unique beauty that won&#39;t be compared? Even more, couldn&#39;t she be the only one? &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;You are also good-looking, uniquely good-looking, Tian Qin said sarcastically. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Really, Chen Weiyi said in surprise, but I am serious. That day I suddenly remembered the poem &quot;The bright wrist condenses the frost and snow&quot;. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Tian Qin is still immersed in the anger towards that &quot;look&quot;, and even this anger has turned the target and turned into a criticism of herself. A man who can only stare at women, and you, Tian Qin, are still feeling sorry for him, why should he deserve it? He is just like Chinese men for thousands of years, who regard women, painted boats and spring water as the same thing. They have not thought about whether the people around him care about him or not, and they only covet the youth and youth of the people around him. Beauty. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;At this moment, Tian Qin stared sternly at the poet from a thousand years ago and Chen Weiyi in front of him. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Huh? Why don&#39;t you speak anymore? Chen Weiyi said, aren&#39;t you always very venomous? As he said this, he gave Tian Qin a piece of food with chopsticks. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;我不光嘴巴厉害，田沁近乎暴怒地说，我哪哪儿都很厉害，初中的时候就有老师说女孩子不擅长学习，脑袋不如男生灵光，我不服，一路从重点高中考到重点大学，没补过习，没让父母为我求过人，我哪里不厉害了。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;说完这些，田沁自己都有些心惊，搞不懂自己为什么跟陈惟义说这么多，为什么这么生气。而这些话，她此前都未曾与老王讲过。她愣住了，周身像掉进了一个冰窟窿，手凉脚凉。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;陈惟义抱着她，说，你好让人心疼。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;田沁的眼泪就下来了。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;为什么，田沁啜泣着问。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;陈惟义并没有回答，轻轻地笼着她，像哄孩子那样哄着她。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;4&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;从农家乐回来后，陈惟义好像获得了田沁的秘密，或者秘密的一部分，从而跟她有了一类亲近感。他依旧每天几条微信，但更严肃地敦促她吃饭和注意身体，从某种意义上，确实像她的哥哥。但田沁无法在前面加一个&amp;ldquo;情&amp;rdquo;。不知不觉间，田沁已经默许了陈惟义半推半地进驻到她的心里。偶尔，她的心是不安的，但更多的时候，她是心安的。这心安来自于她和他并没有越界的身体接触，没有加上&amp;ldquo;情&amp;rdquo;字的原因也在此。这段关系缺少身体愉悦的关系让田沁感到道德的安宁。毕竟她是女性，还是漂亮女性，毕竟在这整个社会语境下，她是被认为能愉悦别人的那个，况且她研究身体哲学，知道身体的愉悦意味着什么，没有身体的愉悦能让她对这个男人获得更全面而深刻的凝视。虽然有时她也有欲望。她也不是为谁守贞，只是觉得，事情不能滑向俗套的那一面。陈惟义也未曾提出过什么，虽然他一次又一次地赞美他，看上去既真诚又笃定。仿佛她是他无法触碰的女神，她只静静地美就好了，他只远远地望就好了。 &amp;ldquo;望&amp;rdquo;就不代表凝视，&amp;ldquo;望&amp;rdquo;是形而上的。田沁的生活中充满了这类哲学的解释。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;田沁的心，安得越来越瓷实。她可以和老王在一起，但心里也会有一个陈惟义。在她心里，她和陈惟义，是两个永远无法抵达的彼岸，像哲学上所说的能指和所指，永远无法契合一致。因而面对陈惟义的微信，也就回得越来越从容。他有时候发的某些带有挑逗性的微信，她也能回得越来越轻快，毕竟，他们没有上过床，只是相互在嘴上过过瘾罢了。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;快要期末的某一天，田沁和同学从校外聚完餐独自一个人回来，迎头赶上了陈惟义。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;陪我去喝点，陈惟义说。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;为什么，田沁说。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;因为你，陈惟义红了眼睛，愤怒似的死死盯住田沁，说。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;我怎么了，我又不欠你的，田沁愣了半晌，说。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;你欠，陈惟义说，你长这么漂亮，还这么厉害，又这么让人心疼，从见你那天起我眼跟前就老有你的影子晃来晃去的，我他妈为了夸你把《唐诗三百首》都搬出来了。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;田沁笑了。陈惟义又回到了她熟悉的那个陈惟义。 《唐诗三百首》的哪句呀，她说，我怎么记得&amp;ldquo;皓腕凝霜雪&amp;rdquo;是词啊？她觉得这个男人坦诚得有些可爱了。况且，以女性的眼光审视陈惟义，他长得可以说是标致。这让田沁有些得意&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;不是为了这个男人为她着迷而得意，而是为她也有机会好好地凝视这个男人而得意。她对此一直很较真儿。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;陈惟义带田沁去了一家日式的居酒屋，跟人民路上的酒吧们相比，这里显得素净，气氛很适合清谈。陈惟义毕竟跟群里的那些人不大一样的，田沁在心里这样轻轻地判断着。到了之后，田沁又问陈惟义：&amp;ldquo;为什么？ &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;他知道她问的是什么。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;因为你傻呗，陈惟义说，你读书把自己读傻了，还傻得可爱。从第一次见你开始，我就知道你劲劲儿的，柳絮不可能不飞到嘴里的，你倒是往行政楼里面站啊，但你偏要站在树底下还要防着柳絮。其实那套护肤品是我买给我老婆的，我给你另准备了东西，看到你人之后，我就想跟你有来有往。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;田沁心里有什么东西在涌动着。但不知道说什么。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;你是我见过的很特别的人，我知道你很在乎群里面的那些言论，甚至把你激怒了吧，陈惟义打开新的一瓶酒，说，你一边跟那些人打着哈哈，让大家不排斥你，一边心里面把这些只把女人看成工具的男人当成傻逼，是吧？你这种人啊，太贪心了，就是那种又想安稳，又想要自由，想当个好人，但又软弱的人，你太纠结了，你只能二选一，明白吗？人不能既要酒喝得爽又要肝不出问题。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;田沁怔住了，她没想到陈惟义会说出这种话来，她没想到他对她真的达到了一类超越表层的凝视。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;我就不是啊，我想要自由，陈惟义做出一个飞翔的姿势，说，也选择承担自由的风险。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;5&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;半年后田沁完成了论文，没有选自己的导师继续读博，成为了哲学系系主任的门下高足。其实系主任此前只招男生，他认为只有男人才能搞好哲学。但陈惟义活动了一下，让系主任顺利地接受了田沁&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;这也是陈惟义承担的风险之一。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;田沁从群里面退了出来。退群是陈惟义要求的。退群吧，陈惟义说，我看到你和老王的头像那么像，就觉得不舒服，老王也不会想到我才是那个隔壁老王，靠，我得遭天打雷劈。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;说这话的时候田沁正玩弄着陈惟义的手指。田沁已经熟悉陈惟义身体的各个部分，是真正意义上的凝视，并提出自己的看法，类似陈惟义你最近有肚腩了哦，陈惟义你最近床上表现没有之前好了哦，之类的。事实上，田沁也觉得这类凝视毫无意义，就像学校校办公室发的各种问卷，好像说了他陈惟义就能改了似的。而她田沁，又有什么理由要求陈惟义去改呢？ &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;那天从居酒屋出来后，分手时，陈惟义抱了一下田沁，贴着田沁的耳朵说，其实我也是有正常生理需求的男人。他呼出来的热气喷在她的耳朵里，让她获得了久违的高潮。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;田沁承认，陈惟义对自己的剖析入木三分，而她也终于承认，身体的愉悦是双方都想要的，逃避没有用。他们一如所有偷情的男女一样，安顿好各自的伴侣，说谎或者别的什么。在老王那里没有的愉悦感，在陈惟义这里倒是获得了。田沁没有更多的体验样本，只能比较老王。陈惟义有时候也会问他，他和老王，她喜欢谁，而田沁也不甘示弱，问她和他老婆，他喜欢谁。他们很平等，陈惟义也说她脚腕有点粗。一次欢爱之后，陈惟义被电话叫走了，田沁一个人在浴室里洗澡。浴室里有面大镜子，田沁凝视着镜子里自己的身体，陌生又熟悉。她好像一会儿变成了老王，一会儿变成了陈惟义。老王说她胸长得好，丰满柔软，像两只抓不住的兔子，陈惟义说她皓腕凝霜雪，老王说她屁股不够翘，陈惟义说她脚腕有点粗。两个声音比赛似地在脑袋里炸开。她受不了自己这样，啪，打了自己一巴掌，啪啪啪啪，又打了自己几巴掌，唯有这样，才能让别人都走开。只剩下她。她凝视着镜子里的自己，因为刚刚洗完澡的缘故，脸红红的。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;好像她被她自己凝视得不好意思了一样。 &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;
