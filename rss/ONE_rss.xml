When you can&#39;t control your own destiny, blame others and the situation. &quot;Shifting the blame&quot; and escaping can temporarily make people&#39;s lives easier. &lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;1&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;At that moment, I returned to the past. I became the eight-year-old girl again. I stood at the back door of the classroom, looking at his back. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;He sat in the window seat in the first row of the classroom, with his back to me. His body is bent forward. His right shoulder was shaking slightly. He is doing homework, I know he is doing homework. But it has been a long time since school ended. My homework has been finished long ago, and his homework should have been finished long ago. I guess he is copying the text. My mother told me that he copied every text at least ten times. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;He remained bent over for a long, long time. I stood at the back door of the classroom and stared for a long time. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Our classroom is at the east end of the school. The wooden doors and wooden window frames of the classroom have faded to gray and black. The window was originally equipped with glass, but half of the glass had been broken and was just empty. It was June at that time, I remember it was June, because after a month, I never saw him again. It was evening at that time, and I knew it was evening because we had finished school early, and my mother was still correcting homework in the room where my mother and I lived at the far west end of the school. My classmates have all gone home. They live in the mountains on both sides of the Qingshui River. Only I live on campus. I had finished my homework long ago and was playing hide-and-seek with myself in the straw piles drying in the playground. I got tired of playing, so I looked at the Qingshui River from the edge of the playground for a while, and at the end of my sight was a ferry as small as a black comma on the Qingshui River. Tired of looking at him, I walked back to the back door of the classroom and saw him. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;He was still wearing the Sea Soul short-sleeved shirt. He wears that sea soul shirt almost every day. The blue and white striped round-neck sea soul shirt had been washed countless times and was as thin as butterfly wings. Not only is it thin, it also has holes. I could see his tanned skin through the circular holes on his back, big and small, like butterfly spots. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;He is a very thin child. His hair was black and thick, growing like weeds falling in the wind on the top of his head. His back was like an upright, slightly curved pole, and his shoulders were slightly splayed, like two hillsides, climbing up to his bean sprout-like head buried in his homework book. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;He is still writing, still writing. I can picture his homework without even looking at it. The words in his homework book are densely written. Once the inner pages are finished, write them on the second cover, third cover and back cover, and then write on the top and bottom edges of each page. Every inch of his workbook is filled with thin, slightly curved fonts that look just like him. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Liu Wang, you haven’t gone back yet? &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;My mother’s voice came from behind me. I don&#39;t know when my mother came. I don&#39;t know how long my mother stood behind me. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Liu Wang turned around. He saw my mom and he saw me. When he saw me, he smiled sheepishly and blinked his eyes several times involuntarily. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Liu Wang said, &quot;Teacher Zhang, I will go back right away.&quot; &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Mom walked over, and I followed. As expected, Liu Wang was copying the text. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Mom picked up Liu Wang’s homework and read it again and again. His mother said to him with half praise and half distress: &quot;You work too hard.&quot; Your parents will be lucky to have a promising child like you in the future. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;My mother turned back to me and said, &amp;ldquo;It would be great if you worked so hard. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I don’t know how many times I have heard my mother say similar words. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Liu Wang began to pack his cloth bag. I stood next to my mother and looked at him with great envy. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Liu Wang said goodbye to us and walked along the Qingshui River bank towards the ferry. I stood next to my mother and looked at his back. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Just like this moment forty years later, I am standing in front of Starbucks, looking at the back of the young man by the window. That back is exactly the same as the one burned into my mind. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;But now, the person standing next to me is my daughter. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;My daughter is urging me: &quot;Mom, what are you waiting for?&quot; Go ahead. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;2&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In the fall when I was nine years old, my mother was transferred from Qingshuihe Primary School to my father. The provincial capital where I work. Since then, I have never returned to the mountain col where I spent my childhood. A few years later, I heard that Qingshuihe Primary School was canceled due to insufficient students. The only primary school building was demolished, and the rammed-earth playground was plowed into rice fields. Qingshuihe Elementary School seems to have never existed. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The ferry on the Qingshui River did leave traces. The ferry originally disappeared earlier than Qingshuihe Primary School. After the commune was transformed into a township, the township borrowed money to build a hydropower station by the river and a cement bridge across the river. Ferries are no longer essential for locals’ daily travel. I heard that the awning boat was towed to the shore and placed in a slightly wider river beach. It was exposed to the wind and sun, and gradually only the frame was left. Later, rural tourism became fashionable. This boat frame looks like a cultural relic and a symbol of the times, attracting tourists to take selfies and group photos in front of the boat frame. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I was also one of those who took selfies in front of the boat rack. In the summer when my daughter was admitted to college, I finally took a five-hour train ride from the provincial capital alone, got off the train and took an hour-long bus ride back to this mountain col. The bus station is opposite the township government. Along the way, cars were circling on the mountain road, which made me feel dizzy after not going out for a long time. But when I got out of the car, I was still surprised by the grandeur of the township government building. This ten-story office building with its exterior walls all covered with marble looks like an alien spacecraft that has landed in the local area and may fly away at any time. There is a row of black Passat cars parked at the entrance of the office building, like small cruisers sent out from alien spaceships to perform missions. But I didn’t come to see the peep show. After standing at the door of the bus station for a few minutes and trying to figure out the direction, I walked along the highway in the direction of the roar for five minutes, and then I saw the hydropower station and the two-lane wide cement bridge. I walked to the middle of the cement bridge and looked around. The sky is blue, the mountains are lush, the rivers are clear, and the rice fields are golden. In the valleys extending on both sides and on the slopes at the end of the valleys, there are houses dotted with red glazed tile roofs and white tile walls. Except for that office building, everything in my eyes is like a peach blossom garden, with natural beauty. I stood on the bridge for a few more minutes, and even the office building seemed coordinated and necessary. With the existence of that office building, people can realize that the beautiful scenery in front of them is not the primitive chaos, but the voluntary modernity. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;This mountain col, which has become a prefecture-level tourist attraction, is more beautiful than I expected, but it has no connection with the scene in my memory. But there was no mistaking it, the boat frame was lying on the river beach a dozen meters downstream. There happened to be a group of young people laughing and playing on the pebbled river beach. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I remember that boat. There is no way I can forget that boat. My mother once took me on that ferry to the mountains across the river for home visits. The punter is Liu Wang&#39;s father. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;3&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Liu Wang’s father was originally an orphan. After liberation, thanks to the kindness of the People’s Commune, he lived on the Qingshui River. Row the ferry, live on the boat, and earn work points. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;One day in the late 1960s, Liu Wang’s father ferried a Henan woman who had fled from famine. The woman got on the boat and never got off the boat again. The next year, the government gave the couple a homestead at the foot of the mountain. The couple built an adobe house. The woman gave birth to three daughters in succession in the adobe house, and Liu Wang was her fourth child. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Liu Wang is my elementary school classmate. My mother is our class teacher. From the first grade to the third grade, I always came first and Liu Wang came second. It’s just that my mother never praises me, only Liu Wang. My mother said that my good grades were just a little clever, but Liu Wang was the one who really worked hard. It is not enough to be smart, you must work hard to achieve success. My mother said this to me sincerely every day. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Not only verbal education, but my mother also took me with her during her home visit at the end of the term. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Qingshuihe Primary School has only three classes, and they are all duplex classes. Mom teaches one of them. Mom&#39;s more than twenty students walk to school every day. Liu Wang&#39;s family lives farthest away, and it takes an hour to walk. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;That was the first time I took Liu Wang’s father’s ferry to the other side. The ferry was a awning boat, and there was a tattered black curtain in front of the cabin under the awning. In front of the curtain is the curved bow of the ship. There are benches for people to sit on the inside of the ship&#39;s side on both sides. Liu Wang&#39;s father dragged a bench out of the cabin and placed it at the hatch for my mother and me to sit on. With a smile on his face, Liu Wang&#39;s father stammered: &quot;Teacher, sit in the middle. Don&#39;t shake in the middle. Sit more comfortably.&quot; &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Liu Wang’s father is dark, thin, short, and his face is covered with wrinkles. His eyes were small and narrowed. His cheeks had no flesh at all, his buck teeth protruded, and he could hardly close his mouth. I can&#39;t believe that this man is the father of the delicate and handsome Liu Wang. The two of them have nothing in common. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;But this ugly old man does not make people feel scary. On the contrary, when he talks to people, he bends his body, which makes me feel approachable, and when he shakes the oar, he stretches his body, which makes me feel relieved. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;There is no use meeting him. My mother must meet Liu Wang’s mother to complete the home visit. Home visits are not a necessary part of my mother&#39;s job, but my mother has done home visits for as many semesters as she has worked at Qingshuihe Primary School. My mother told me that we must let the children’s parents know how they are doing in school and let them have plans for their children’s future. Especially Liu Wang. She adds this to me every time. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;But I only did this one home visit with my mother, and no matter what, I never wanted to go again. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;4&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;There were about ten young people in that group. The boys among them were wearing T-shirts and jeans, and some of the girls were also wearing T-shirts and jeans, and some were wearing fashionable shorts or skirts. The boys all have black hair and fresh faces. Some of the girls have straight long hair, some have buns, and their facial features are all straight and harmonious. Some of them were floating in the water, some were building stone towers, some were soaking their feet in the river, and some were sitting on the boat frames to enjoy the cool air. They were playing and playing, and their laughter was carried far by the summer wind. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The scene in front of me was as beautiful as a movie scene, and I couldn’t help but watch it again and again. I initially thought they were tourists, but the familiar local dialect blowing in the wind proved my guess wrong. But if they are locals, they are very different from the rural children I remember. These young people are almost indistinguishable from my daughter’s classmates in terms of their dress and facial features. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I couldn’t help but ask them where they were from. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;A girl replied: &quot;We are locals.&quot; We all live on the other side of the river. &amp;rdquo;She raised her finger and pointed to the other side. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;This answer confirmed my judgment, but still surprised me. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;A boy continued: &quot;We are classmates and graduated from high school this year.&quot; We will go out to study after summer vacation, so now we hurry up and have more fun together. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;As expected, they are my daughter’s peers. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I asked: &quot;Where do you go to study?&quot; &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The boy said a little embarrassedly: &amp;ldquo;My grades are not good, I only passed the second exam in one area. She did well in the exam and was admitted to Central South University. &amp;rdquo;He pointed to the girl who was talking to me just now. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The girl heard it and smiled reservedly. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The boy asked: &quot;Auntie, where are you from?&quot; &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I said: &amp;ldquo;I’m from Changsha. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I continued: &amp;ldquo;But I can also be considered a local. I grew up here until I was nine years old. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;When the boy heard this, he was very enthusiastic. He said that his home was by the river, and he invited me to sit at his home. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The houses on the other side of the river are still dotted as before, but the appearance of the houses has changed dramatically. Looking up, there is no more adobe house in sight. Every household has built a two- or three-story small Western-style building. The white tiles from bottom to top of the floor are particularly pleasing to the eye against the backdrop of the green mountains. When you walk up to it, you can see that there is a cement-paved yard in front of each house, and white or black cars are parked in some yards. The front doors of the houses are all made of stainless steel or brass, with various complex patterns cast on them. If it weren&#39;t for the chickens and ducks constantly walking around in the yard and the farm tools such as hoes and dustpans piled in the corner of the yard, this place might be mistaken for a suburban vacation villa area. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I sat on a bamboo chair in front of the boy’s house and chatted with the boy’s grandmother. Young people were scattered in the courtyard and main room, some looking at their mobile phones, some chatting, and some walking around aimlessly in the courtyard. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I asked grandma: &quot;Where are Liu Weiguo&#39;s parents?&quot; &amp;rdquo;Liu Weiguo is the boy who brought me here, grandma’s grandson. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Grandma said: &quot;It&#39;s not just working outside to make money.&quot; This guy will go to college for four years, and he has a younger brother who graduated from junior high school this year. Plow on the back of an ox. It still costs a lot of money. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Grandma sighed and added: &quot;Last year my eldest granddaughter got married and received a small amount of gift, which was considered a transition.&quot; Otherwise, the family would have no money at all, and it cost over 100,000 yuan to build this house. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I couldn’t tell whether grandma’s tone was pride or worry. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I hesitated for a while, and then asked my grandma the question I wanted to ask. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I asked: &quot;Do you know Liu Wang?&quot; &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Grandma replied: &amp;ldquo;Why don’t you know me? He and my son and his wife work in the same place. They joined a construction team, which built roads and bridges. They followed the foreman everywhere. I have been to Beijing, Henan, Guizhou, and Sichuan. Now he is building a highway in western Hunan with my son and his wife. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;After grandma finished speaking, she asked me: &quot;Do you know Liu Wang?&quot; &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I said: &amp;ldquo;Yes, I went to Qingshuihe Primary School, and Liu Wang was my primary school classmate. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;When grandma heard this, she stared at me for a while and said, &quot;You are Teacher Zhang&#39;s daughter!&quot; &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I said: &amp;ldquo;Yes. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Grandma suddenly became excited and said repeatedly: &quot;Teacher Zhang is a good person.&quot; She was afraid that these rural girls didn&#39;t study. It&#39;s a pity that these rural girls have no income and can&#39;t study well. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Only Liu Wang has good grades. It was a pity for Liu Wang. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I said: &amp;ldquo;Oh. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Grandma said: &amp;ldquo;You don’t know, do you? After the people&#39;s commune was transformed into a township government, the ferry boat that Liu Wang&#39;s father had rowed all his life was taken away by the township government and contracted to others. He had no choice but to go back to farming. He had never farmed in his life, so it was hard for him. After farming for several years, the northern wife he picked up on the boat ran away. Do you know Liu Wang’s mother, right? All four children are gone. &amp;ldquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I said: &amp;ldquo;Oh. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Grandma continued: &amp;ldquo;The next year, Liu Wang’s father drowned in the river. Who would believe it? After rowing all my life, I will eventually die in the water. He drank at least a pound of liquor that day, walked by the river in the middle of the night, fell into the river, and couldn&#39;t get out. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;It’s just a pity for Liu Wang. It&#39;s hard for his three sisters to treat him well and support him in education until he graduates from high school. But I don’t know why. He had such good grades and was ranked first in the township after graduating from junior high school. But when he graduated from high school, he didn’t even get into college. He went to Shenzhen to work. Two years later, he brought a wife back. His wife heard that she was from rural Henan, and her hometown was much harder than ours. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;His wife gave birth to a male child for him. This man is a classmate of my grandson. He is very well-behaved and well-read. This year he also entered college in the college entrance examination, apparently at Changsha Railway University. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Liu Weiguo smiled and said, &quot;It&#39;s Changsha Railway College.&quot; &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Grandma just continued: &quot;It&#39;s a pity that Liu Wang&#39;s wife fell ill after giving birth to this child and can&#39;t have another child. It saves the women&#39;s director the effort of not having to delay the sterilization.&quot; &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I asked: &amp;ldquo;Grandma, is Liu Wang’s child at home? &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Grandma said: &amp;ldquo;Not here. He and his father went out to work. But his mother is at home. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;5&lt;/strong>;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Before leaving the river beach, I stood in front of me after thirty-five years. In front of the boat rack, I asked Liu Weiguo to take a photo for me with my mobile phone. After taking the photo, I stood by the river and looked across. I couldn&#39;t believe that the beautiful tourist attraction in front of me was that mountain col. The field ridge was so narrow that there was only room for footing, and the dirt road was full of gravel and potholes. That mother took her with her. I walked for a full hour before reaching the col of Liu Wang&#39;s house. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;After getting off the boat, my mother thanked Liu Wang’s father, then led me to climb up the river bank in a hurry, one foot deep and one foot shallow, towards the foot of the mountain. My mother was afraid that I would fall, so she held my hand tightly. When we encountered a field ridge where we couldn&#39;t walk parallel, my mother asked me to walk in front. She followed me closely, always telling me to be careful, for fear that I would fall into the rice field. But my attention was not at all on my feet. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;When I look at the other side from the school corridor, I see the mountains are covered with indigo, like a freehand landscape painting, distant and lacking in details. But when I was in it, the scenery changed irrevocably. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The path under our feet was not only rugged, but also deserted, as if no one had walked on it for a long time. The half-meter-wide dirt road was occasionally interrupted by puddles in the middle. The puddles were filled with sewage and mosquitoes and flies flying low against the water. There are some thorngrass, sawgrass, dandelions and foxtail grass growing on the roadside. From time to time, thorny branches stretched out into the middle of the road. I couldn&#39;t get out of the way, and a bloody gash was drawn on my calf. This winding road is flanked by rice fields on both sides. The rice in the commune has matured, and the ears of rice are hanging low. However, the distance between ridges of rice is wide, and the ears of rice that are only in strips appear sparse and lonely, like wild crops that are self-sustaining. The mountain at the end of the rice field is not a whole, but is divided and fragmented by shrubs, miscellaneous trees, stones, mounds and small patches of sweet potato fields. Nowhere on the mountain is there a continuous forest, not even a patch of grass. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Farmer houses in twos and threes are located among the rice fields and on the hillsides. Those adobe houses are so integrated into the land that you can barely tell them unless you look carefully. As I walked closer, I saw that all these houses only had two or three rooms. The main room was built in the middle of the three-room house, and there was a room on each side. The two rooms are just a right-angled trapezoid, which seems to have been abandoned and occupied by others. None of these houses had their exterior walls painted, and the adobe bricks exposed to the air were all peeling and damaged, and some places were smoked black. The wooden doors of these houses have been bleached gray by the sun, as if they have existed for thousands of years, or as if they were shipwrecks that had just been washed ashore, riddled with holes and exhausted. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;My mother took me and walked under the eaves of those houses. The middle-aged woman who was cutting pigweed in the main room and the middle-aged man who was walking on the field carrying a pair of buckets saw my mother and said with smiles on their faces: &quot;Teacher Zhang, you are here.&quot; &amp;ldquo;Teacher Zhang, walk slowly. &quot;My mother also nodded and replied with a smile: &quot;Sister-in-law of the Liu family, cut the pigweed. &amp;rdquo;&amp;ldquo;Brother Liu Gui, carry the water. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Then we came to the main hall of a family. There are no adults in this family, only two children sitting on the threshold of the main room. The older child is a girl who looks six or seven years old, and the younger child is a boy who looks four or five years old. Both children have dark skin and sparse hair. I saw the girl first. The girl&#39;s eyes are very far apart, so small that there is only a slit left. The nose is flat, the nostrils are everted, and under the two thick lips is a protruding chin. I see the boy again. I didn&#39;t see what the boy looked like at all, I only saw his mouth. His upper lip split in half at the philtrum, leaving his lips in three pieces. Between the two split upper lips, the red gums were exposed, as if the internal organs were turned over. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I was shocked, grabbed my mother&#39;s hand tightly, and kept leaning against her. The mother was still smiling and greeting the two children: &quot;Aibao, Zhongbao, mom and dad are not at home.&quot; &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The girl replied: &amp;ldquo;Dad went up the mountain to chop wood. Mom went to the river to wash clothes. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I dragged my mother and asked her to leave quickly. We finally left the house, which was as small as a matchbox. Mom sighed slightly and held my hand tightly. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;After a long time, many details of that day gradually appeared in my memory like sediment. I remember that when I left that house, my mind went blank, and I could no longer see anything except my mother. I remembered that I just wanted to follow my mother closely, and I was afraid of being left behind by my mother. I remembered , we walked for a long time, and finally reached Liu Wang’s house; I remembered that Liu Wang’s mother was thin and tall, taller than the people I met on the road; I remembered that Liu Wang came from the jujube tree behind the house. They gave me a dustpan of green dates, but I didn’t eat any. I remembered that the sun had set that day, and we finally walked back to the river. I remembered that Liu Wang’s father was waiting for us by the river, and we got on the boat. , he punted the boat. The sunset in the river is broken by the oars, like a broken dream. After a long time, the cause and effect of that dream were lost from memory. Only the faces of the two children seemed to be engraved on the senses and nerves and could not be erased no matter how hard they were erased. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;6&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I stopped outside Liu Wang’s house. Liu Wang&#39;s family is still the most remote in the village and the furthest away from Qingshui River. If I were standing on the Qingshui River Bridge, I would not be able to see this house hidden in the deepest part of the mountain, nor would I be affected by the pleasing harmony that is reflected in my eyes by this house that is incompatible with its surroundings. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;But this house is not the house of Liu Wang’s house when my mother first brought me for a home visit. The memories suppressed deep in the brain by the faces of the two children suddenly became as clear as the developed film. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;At that time, Liu Wang’s family only had one room. The house is built of adobe bricks with no painted walls, and each adobe brick has missing edges and corners. The roof is covered with thatch, and the thickness of thatch is uneven, probably the result of continuous replenishing. At that time, the door panel of Liu Wang&#39;s house was an old door panel that was unwanted by other people. The cracked gap in the door panel from top to bottom was fixed by several horizontal strips of wood with rusty iron nails. The door panels and wooden horizontal strips are covered with Chinese characters written in white chalk. The white chalk was given to Liu Wang by my mother. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;After so many years, I remembered my mother’s praise of Liu Wang again. I felt a touch of sadness again. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The Liu Wang house in front of me has obviously been renovated. My grandma told me that after Liu Wang graduated from high school, two of his three sisters married into the surrounding villages in more remote places. One also went to Shenzhen, worked for two years, and married a colleague. My colleague’s family is from rural Guangdong, so this sister became a rural person from another place. A few years after his child was born, Liu Wang dug the hillside behind his house into a flat and started building a new house. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;But the house was never completed. So many years have passed, and Liu Wang&#39;s children have graduated from high school. What I see before me is still a one-story house with only a second floor and no roof. This house is a red brick house. It seems that in addition to the main room, there are at least four rooms. The floor at the door was plastered with cement, red bricks were laid to the top of the first floor, and the second floor was entirely paved with cement prefabricated boards. But there is no second floor above the cement prefabricated board, let alone a roof. The red bricks end abruptly at the ceiling of the first floor. The whole house looks like an unsealed packaging box or an abandoned container. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The door in the center of the front of the house is the same as other houses I passed. It is an iron door with patterns and handles. The door is slightly deformed, probably because it is not thick enough. The window on the left side of the door has glass installed. There is a layer of dust on the glass and you can&#39;t see inside. The window to the right of the door was just a hollow, covered with a piece of plastic film that had turned grayish-yellow from dust. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Before I came back to my senses, Liu Weiguo had already knocked on the door of Liu Wang’s house. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The iron gate made a hollow echo. I wanted to quickly say, &quot;No, no, I&#39;ll just look outside,&quot; but it was too late. The door opened. Liu Wang&#39;s wife held the door and stood inside. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Her haggardness and old age are not much different from my imagination. The only thing that struck me as slightly odd was that it was summer and she had a sheet wrapped around her lower body. The sheet was tied at the waist with a rope and the hem fell to her calves. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Liu Weiguo said: &quot;Aunt, this aunt is a classmate of Liu Siyu&#39;s father.&quot; Her mother is Liu Siyu’s father’s primary school teacher. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Her eyes suddenly became alert with a trace of doubt. She opened her other hand and moved inside, saying, &quot;Come in and sit down.&quot; Come in and sit. &amp;rdquo;She spoke Mandarin. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;She continued: &quot;The house is too dirty, don&#39;t blame me.&quot; &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;As she said this, she turned around and walked into the main room. She walked unsteadily, her feet slightly spread apart. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I stood there for two seconds and already began to regret my decision to visit Liu Wang’s home. But you have come, you cannot go back. I calmed down, smiled, and followed her to the room on the left side of the main room. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The room has a briquette stove, a sink, a square dining table, a cupboard, two benches, and two bamboo chairs. A slight surprise was that there was a running water tap above the sink. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I said: &quot;We have running water at home, which is much more convenient.&quot; &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Siyu’s mother smiled and said, “Yes, thanks to the government.” &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;She slowly bent down, picked up the thermos next to the stove, and made me a cup of tea. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;It can be seen that the tea is native tea grown and stir-fried at home. Pieces of green tea leaves spread out in the boiling water in the white porcelain cup, quickly dyeing the water into emerald color. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I picked up the tea cup, and a refreshing fragrance hit my nose, temporarily covering up the looming smell in the room. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Siyu’s mother said: “I know you. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I said: &amp;ldquo;Really? &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;She said: &amp;ldquo;Yes. When I first met Liu Wang in Shenzhen, he told me about you. He said that you have been smart and naughty since you were a child, which made your mother worry a lot. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;But he is particularly envious of you. He said you never have to review your homework, and you always get first place in the exam. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;He also said you are beautiful. You are really pretty. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;He said that you were very kind to him, but he was not worthy of you. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;7&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;I am not good enough for you. &amp;rdquo;Yes. These are Liu Wang&#39;s original words. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;When I was nine years old, my mother was transferred to Changsha No. 8 Primary School, and my parents ended their separation. Mom was so busy trying to open up new horizons that she didn&#39;t notice that her daughter had changed from a beloved teacher&#39;s daughter to a country person who had never seen the world in her new school. In her view, I have been playful since I was a child, have many clever ideas, and have many tricks, so I have no problem adapting to the new environment. Besides, my grades haven&#39;t declined. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;But I never had the chance to tell her about my loneliness in those years. Only three years later, when my Changsha dialect was finally the same as that of a girl born and raised in Changsha, and I could no longer recognize the accent, my mother suffered a cerebral hemorrhage during class and died in the hospital. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Dad works at China Construction Fifth Engineering Bureau and is stationed at the construction site for a long time. My junior high school life was basically a solitary one. After graduating from junior high school, my score in the high school entrance examination was 70 points, but my father asked me to study in a technical secondary school. He said that girls are easily distracted, so it is better to start working early. At that time, my father had remarried and was transferred back to the Changsha headquarters. I would also like to leave home early. So I went to technical secondary school, and three years later, I became my father’s colleague. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;After working for two years, I went to Shenzhen on leave without pay. I have been working in Shenzhen for two years. In the past two years, I have worked as a clerk in the real estate company of my father’s classmate. Two years later, I left Shenzhen and returned to my original employer to work. Two years later, I followed my father&#39;s orders and got married to a college student who worked for me. A few years later, he left our workplace and opened his own building materials company. By the time our daughter was in middle school, the building materials company had assets worth tens of millions. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;It’s just that none of this seems to have much to do with me. Except my daughter. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;But my daughter had no way of knowing that her mother was not always the taciturn and aloof person she saw. My daughter has no way of knowing that her mother has also laughed, cried, resisted, and escaped. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;But the reply her mother got was: &quot;I&#39;m not good enough for you.&quot; &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;8&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Actually, I guessed the ending from the beginning of that night. The first time I saw Liu Wang at the door of the restaurant, my heart collapsed silently. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;It’s just that I don’t believe it. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The next day, I decided to leave Shenzhen and go back to Changsha. But I didn’t know I was going to do this the first day. My boss told me about the hometown gathering in Qingshuihe area. He knew that my mother worked in that area. I didn&#39;t want to go, I didn&#39;t want to revisit the past that I had finally overcome. But after work, I couldn&#39;t help but call a taxi and go to the &quot;Xiangyuan&quot; restaurant in Nanshan District. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;On the blackboard supported by a tripod at the entrance of the restaurant, there are eight characters written in red chalk: &quot;The love for hometown is deep, the Qingshui River is long.&quot; I saw Liu Wang in front of the blackboard. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I recognized Liu Wang at a glance, but after just a second, I began to suspect that I had recognized the wrong person. The man in front of me, with one hand in his trouser pocket and a cigarette held in the other, has the same facial expression as I remember. But the feeling this person gave me was completely different from what I remembered. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;When Liu Wang was a child, he was thin and taller than his peers. The man in front of him was only just over 1.7 meters tall. She is still very thin, but her back is hunched, as if she is afraid of the cold. When Liu Wang was a child, he followed his mother&#39;s example. He had delicate features and his skin would turn white in winter. The man in front of me has yellow and black skin. When he smokes, his eyebrows lift up, and his forehead is covered with forehead wrinkles. When Liu Wang was a child, his clothes were very shabby, but they didn&#39;t make people feel pitiful. The man in front of me wore jeans that were so dirty that it was hard to tell what they were, and a wrinkled horizontal striped polo shirt on his upper body. Needless to say, it was sold on the street for ten yuan a piece. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;But none of this matters. The important thing is that when he was a child, Liu Wang was full of vitality, like a thriving young tree, but the Liu Wang in front of him was dull and dull, turning into a sweet potato vine spreading close to the ground. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;我试探着叫了一声&amp;ldquo;刘旺&amp;rdquo;，他转过身来，立即并拢双脚，扔掉了手里的烟。他是刘旺。没有错。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;我们没有坐在一张餐桌上。他和他的几个高中同学坐在一起。我随便找了个座位。席上的人们说着像河水一样缺乏棱角的清水河方言，劝酒劝菜声此起彼伏。酒席快结束时，我走过去，把刘旺叫了出来。我叫刘旺陪我走走。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;刘旺迟疑了一下，点了点头。他进去和他同学交代了几句，然后和我并排走到街上。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;这一走，我们走了两个小时。深南大道上的大榕树垂挂无数粗粗细细的气根，好像无数计数用的绳子。汽车一辆辆呼啸而过。路灯亮了。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;该叙的旧都叙过了，能说的话都说完了。眼前这个确定无疑是刘旺的人，仍然让我感到陌生，仍然和我之间隔着看不见的距离。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;只是我不相信。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;于是我转过身，对着他，我说：&amp;ldquo;刘旺，抱抱我。 &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;我的双手抱在胸前。如果他搂住我的腰，我就会张开双手，抱住他的脖子。我以为，如果我能够触摸到他，我就能够触摸到我再也回不去的过去和我总也看不清的未来。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;可是他只是站立在原地，一动不动。我的身体变得僵硬。他终于抬起双手，却只是把两只手在他自己的身体前面绞在一起。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;他笑了一下，说：&amp;ldquo;我配不上你。 &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;9&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;青年穿了一件白衬衣和一条黑裤子。青年站起来，满脸笑容，对我们点头，嘴里说：&amp;ldquo;颜总好。林总好。 &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;他嘴里的颜总是我的女儿。我看了一眼女儿，她的表情波澜不惊。她早就习惯别人这样叫她了。我看着青年说：&amp;ldquo;你好。别这么见外，叫我林阿姨就好。 &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;青年笑了笑，说：&amp;ldquo;那我就不见外了。林阿姨好。 &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;青年的笑容里有一种既熟悉又陌生的味道，像很久很久以前我在那条渡船上看到过的那个令我信任的笑容，也像很久很久以前我在妈妈的教室里看到过的那个令我倾羡的笑容，又像很久很久以前我在深圳的夜空下，看到过的那个令我悲凉的笑容。但这笑容里还有另一种东西，一种我在他的爷爷和他的爸爸的笑容里都没有看见过的，远远超出他年龄的东西。好像他为我们的会面排练过，又或者他为一切类似的场面排练过。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;我说：&amp;ldquo;你叫刘思豫。对吧。我是你爸爸的同学。 &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;刘思豫说：&amp;ldquo;是的，我早就知道您了。 &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;很可惜，我考上大学那年没有在家，错过了和您的会面。我妈妈一直说您人好，念旧。我妈妈说您那年特意去看我们，她心里很感激。 &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;刘思豫说这些话的时候坐在椅子前半部，身体倾向我的方向。他的脸上一直挂着那个稍显过于热情的笑容。我往后坐了坐，略略感到一丝压力。我心想，不是这么回事。我不是特意去看你们的。但是我没有说。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;我说：&amp;ldquo;你妈妈很客气。你妈妈泡的茶很好喝。我很感谢你妈妈。 &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;刘思豫的嘴咧得更开了。他从脚下提起一个枕头大的塑料袋，双手递给我。他说：&amp;ldquo;阿姨，这是我们家今年炒的新茶，都是一片一片摘的最嫩的叶子，商店里买不到的。我妈妈要我带给您。 &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;我有些意外，接过袋子。我说：&amp;ldquo;难得你妈妈这么有心。多谢了，那我就收下了。 &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;刘思豫接着说：&amp;ldquo;颜总，林阿姨，你们喝什么？我去买。 &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;我说：&amp;ldquo;不用你买。哪能要你买呢。思清，你去买吧。 &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;女儿去点了单。我说，&amp;ldquo;思豫，你手机里有你爸爸妈妈的照片吗？ &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;有！ &amp;rdquo;刘思豫好像早有准备，兴冲冲把手机拿了出来。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;照片上，刘旺和他老婆并排站在他家房子的门口。那栋房子已经完工了。二楼以上砌到了屋顶，顶上没有铺琉璃瓦，盖的是老式的黑瓦。房子外墙也没有贴白色瓷片，但是刷了白色涂料。所有的窗户也都安上了玻璃。照片上，对比分明的白墙黑瓦，干净明亮的玻璃窗，映衬着屋后的葱茏青山，一眼看去，好像一幅古意盎然的中国画。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;刘旺却老得让我不敢认。他的两只手仍然在身体前面绞在一起，肩越发下溜，背越发佝偻。但是他在笑。他的笑容变得和他爸爸的笑容一模一样，他的牙齿也和他爸爸一样，全部&amp;ldquo;龅&amp;rdquo;了出来。刘旺的老婆几乎和他一般高。她的五官依然如我记忆里的那般清秀，只不过肤色十分暗哑，不知道是不是被身后的白墙映衬的结果。她穿了一件红花衬衣，一条黑色长裤。她也在笑，她的双手整齐地垂在身体两侧，挺直了腰在笑。但是她的腰却似乎折叠过，无法复原，她的身体无法形成向上的直线。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;我问：&amp;ldquo;你爸爸妈妈都好吧？ &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;刘思豫说：&amp;ldquo;还是那样。爸爸一直在建筑工地打工，到处走。他说这一两年没有那么多活干了。好在家里的房子完工了，了结了他一个大心愿。我跟他说，你怎么不去找一下林阿姨，林阿姨那里肯定有活干。他还怪我不该那么说。 &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;刘思豫说着，自我解嘲地笑了一下。我也笑了笑，没有接他的话头。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;我追问了一句：&amp;ldquo;你妈妈呢？ &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;刘思豫说：&amp;ldquo;我妈妈也还是那样。好不了，就一直吊着命。唉，我妈妈还是蛮受苦的。 &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;他的语气明显下沉了些。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;但是这是命，个人有个人的命。没办法的，不能怨别人。林阿姨您说是吧？ &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;他的语气又浮了上来。 &amp;ldquo;我妈妈说您是她见过最好的人。今天看到您，真的是，您好和气啊。您肯花时间和我见面，我真的太高兴了。 &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;我说：&amp;ldquo;别这么说。刘旺是我的同学，我们见个面是应该的。 &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;一会你和思清到公司去吧，让思清给你办入职手续。新员工要从工地做起，先到工地办公室上班，可以吗？ &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;刘思豫的眼睛顿时亮了。他连连点头，说：&amp;ldquo;当然。 sure.林阿姨，太谢谢您了。我会努力工作的。太谢谢您了！ &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;我说：&amp;ldquo;那就这样吧。你向你爸爸妈妈问好。思清，你再陪思豫坐会，问问他还有什么地方需要帮忙的。 &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;女儿点点头。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;我提起脚边的茶叶，站起来，走出去。我伸手到手袋里拿车钥匙时，触碰到那张折叠得整整齐齐的纸条。昨天晚上思清回家，带给我这张纸条。她说这是一个来公司求职的青年请她转给我的。纸条上是我亲笔写的我的名字、电话、公司名称和地址。四年以前，我从背包里拿出我随身携带的便笺本和中性笔，写下这些信息，把纸从便笺本上撕下来，递给了刘思豫的妈妈。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;我觉得手袋里的纸条舒展开来，鼓涨起来，好像要挣脱束缚，变成一面帆，飞回到清水河边的船架上去，让船架活过来，重新变成渡船。可是不对，我小时候的那条渡船从来就没有帆。那艘渡船只有一把船桨，刘旺的爸爸划着桨，过去又过来，过来又过去，一遍又一遍，循环往复，无止无休。 &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;
