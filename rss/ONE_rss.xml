But it seems that with the money in place, everything is not unbearable. If you were &quot;I&quot; in the article, how would you choose? &lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;1.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Li Fei was lying next to me, touching my chin with her hand Bearded, looking at the ceiling blankly, he asked me: When are you going to resign? I turned over and turned my back to her: Why do you always expect me to resign? She sat up from the bed, with an undisguised questioning expression and tone: I think your female leader has thoughts about you, and the way she looks at you is wrong. If you don’t resign, I will think that you have feelings for her. I also have an idea. I asked her: Which leader? Zhou Yuanyuan? You haven&#39;t even met her. Li Fei patted me: You forgot, one time when you were working overtime, I met her when I went to deliver food to you. She looked at me like she was looking at an enemy. I said: You are overthinking, she looks like this to everyone, don&#39;t worry, I can&#39;t sleep with her - if you are worried about this. She asked dubiously: Why, she still looks pretty and has a good figure, but she is a bit older. I said: You are right, she is too old, so what are you still worried about? Li Fei nodded: Let&#39;s not talk about her anymore. Get up. It&#39;s time for you to go to the company. She got out of the bed and put her clothes on one by one. I lay on the bed and looked at her. I like to watch women put on clothes, and I also like anything that is &quot;covering up.&quot; Li Fei always likes to turn her back to me when she gets dressed. She says she feels embarrassed when she gets dressed facing me. I don&#39;t care, her back is more beautiful than her front - of course, in her opinion, this sentence is not a compliment. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I just arrived at the company, and before I could sit down at my desk, Zhou Yuanyuan walked out of her office, took a bunch of information in her hand, and threw it on my desk with a look of disdain. The posture of all beings looked me up and down, frowned and said to me: I wonder if there will be an interview later? It would be silly to give you an annual leave. Let’s tie the tie again. See you in the conference room in five minutes. I picked up the stack of information. It was the resume information of three people. Their photos were posted in the upper right corner, two men and one woman, but I felt that they all had the same face. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;After interviewing the last person, it was already half past twelve. I started arranging the conference table that we had messed up, imagining that a cannonball would come and level the place. Zhou Yuanyuan sat leisurely on a chair and asked me: What do you think of these three people? I said: Aren&#39;t you hungry? I&#39;m starving to death. Can you let me eat first? She glared at me: Come to my office at two o&#39;clock in the afternoon, and please don&#39;t bring your mobile phone in from now on, otherwise it will be muted and it will keep ringing. What, something big is coming to you? She took her work permit and left the conference room. Her movements were so angry that her walking posture was somewhat deformed, and the clicking sound of her high heels was nauseating. I turned on my phone and saw a message from Li Fei, which contained some photos of food. I was about to reply when she called and asked me: Why don&#39;t you reply to my message. I said: I had an interview this morning and it just ended. She said in an unhappy tone: Well, our school has opened a new restaurant and it tastes pretty good. Come and try it when you have time. I said: OK. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Zhou Yuanyuan was nestled in her office chair, crossing her legs. I said: If you cross your legs like this, the uneven force on your hip bones will cause deformation. You don’t want to walk with a limp for the rest of your life. . She looked at me as if she was mentally ill, put her right leg down heavily, and the heel of her high-heeled shoe slammed against the floor. If only it could poke a hole in the floor, a hole big enough to swallow everything, and she would be the first to fall in, or conversely, everyone would fall in, leaving her alone in this pale office, Endlessly processing resumes that look like scraps of paper. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;She motioned for me to sit down and asked sarcastically: Are you full and do you have the strength to work? I said: I ate quite well. Zhou Yuanyuan shook her legs impatiently, her heels hitting the ground again and making a clicking sound. I said: Stop it quickly. This voice makes me want to kill you. Do you believe it? She stopped and flashed a confused look. At least for a second, she believed what I just said. Zhou Yuanyuan quickly adjusted her expression, put on her best look that no one looked down on, raised her chin, and told me to get down to business. I opened the resume in front of me: none of the three people in the morning were very good. If I had to choose one, it would be the third one. She stared at me and asked: Why? &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Why why why, you have been a human resources manager for ten fucking years and you ask me why, are you an idiot? - I thought about it, but my words changed: The first person&#39;s resume is the most informative among the three, but his dress is more perfunctory than my tie this morning. He doesn&#39;t pay attention to it. After one interview, I may have applied for many similar positions, and I have already settled on one or two companies that I am satisfied with. Did you see the dark circles under his eyes? When I got up to leave, I smelled alcohol. It hadn’t evaporated all night. I’m afraid he didn’t just come here after staying up all night. The big boss probably doesn’t want his assistant to be an alcoholic... ;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Speaking of wine, I stopped and thought of Zhou Yuanyuan, who drank too much at last year’s annual meeting. She was spread out on a seat in the corner, watching the crowd of people coming and going to toast without saying a word, and her cheeks were floating. There were two patches of red on his face, and his brows were still furrowed. The difference is that it no longer conveys a signal of impatience, but simply tells of fatigue. Li Fei also drank too much. She hugged me on the balcony and cried and made trouble. She threatened to go to my company to have a fight with Zhou Yuanyuan, and threatened to push me off the balcony if I dared to cheat. It&#39;s amazing, alcohol can make people quiet, but it can also make people hysterical. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Zhou Yuanyuan knocked on the table: Keep talking! What are you stunned for? I came back to my senses: Cough... The second person spoke too softly and never looked directly into my eyes from the beginning to the end, looking submissive. Maybe he has some childhood shadow, school violence? obscene? He cannot express himself fluently when facing strangers. He is as useless as I was when I first graduated. But I am better than him. I am a useless person who can grow. He said that he had five years of working experience as an assistant to the president. I think that is nonsense. If it were true, there would be no need to keep such a person who has made no progress. The third woman is too young, has no experience, and did not graduate from a prestigious school, but she is quite good-looking. Although the big boss did not specify the gender of his assistant, he is a man, not gay, and will be interested in beautiful women. You also know how incompetent the big boss is. He is as stupid as a donkey. A stupid donkey does not need a smart assistant, as long as he can understand the donkey&#39;s bray, the third woman is enough for him. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Zhou Yuanyuan sneered and said: Are you writing a mystery novel, Mr. Conan Doyle? I said: This is my opinion, I have finished reporting it. She raised her eyebrows: Of all the men I know, you are the meanest. Don&#39;t look at me like that. This is a compliment. I laughed: Speaking of being mean, you really should find a mirror and take a good look at yourself. Zhou Yuanyuan picked up the pen in her hand and threw it at me, causing ink to splash all over me. I picked up the broken pen, put it back on her desk, took away a few paper towels, roughly cleaned the ink marks on the floor, and left her office. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I went to Li Fei’s school to have dinner with her. The newly opened restaurant tasted really good. Li Fei asked me while swiping her mobile phone: Why is your company always recruiting? I said: Our big boss keeps changing assistants, and there is nothing I can do about it. She asked again: I am about to graduate. Is there any suitable position in your company that I can try so that we can work together? I told her: We can&#39;t work in the same place. Li Fei was a little unhappy, put down her phone, and asked seriously: Why do you find me annoying? I said: I don’t mind you, but believe me, if we work in the same place, the conflicts will only increase, just like Zhou Yuanyuan and I. She almost killed me with a pen today. Look at the few ink marks on my body, they are her work. Li Fei&#39;s eyes fell on my shirt: If I don&#39;t go, I won&#39;t go, but don&#39;t compare me with that woman, she is a madman, I am not. I took a piece of meat from the plate and put it in her bowl: You are right. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Li Fei asked me: Why does your big boss keep changing assistants? You have gone through several batches of interviews. I shook my head: I don’t know why. I originally thought that those assistants who resigned were fired by him, but later I found out that they all resigned on their own initiative, all of them... Maybe he has something that ordinary people cannot accept. Quirks, no one could stand him for long. Li Fei continued to ask: Have you met your big boss? What kind of person do you think he is? I shook my head: It’s not like you don’t know that I have only been in this company for a short time, and I am just a small employee in the human resources department. You don&#39;t usually have the opportunity to meet a leader of his level. I just heard from others that he is a very private person. Our company&#39;s self-built office building has a total of six floors. The sixth floor was originally shared by him and the employees in the finance department. Later, he wanted to renovate it, so he rushed all the people from the finance department to our floor. I heard from people in the operations department that many entertainment and leisure venues were added to the original six floors, including a gym, swimming pool, badminton room, bathroom, etc., for his own use. I think he&#39;s stupid for doing this. Li Fei shrugged and didn&#39;t think anything was wrong: isn&#39;t he a big boss? He can do whatever he wants with his own company. I nodded perfunctorily: What you said makes sense. It&#39;s just that after the people from the finance department moved in, the WI-FI became very slow and it was harder to wait for the elevator. Li Fei laughed with a &quot;poof&quot;: Is this considered a problem? I said: You don’t understand this feeling. I already hate my job. The Internet speed is slowing down. I can’t even enjoy myself when I’m lazy. Videos will load very slowly. Also, I hate stairs, they attack my lungs along with the smell of smoke in the air. Li Fei glanced at my belly and said: Climbing the stairs is like losing weight. Your belly is getting bigger and bigger. Aren&#39;t you afraid that I will dislike you? I whispered to myself: I hope you dislike me completely. Li Fei didn&#39;t hear clearly and asked me: What did you say? I took a bite of the food and shook my head: nothing. She said: You shouldn&#39;t hate work, you have to learn to love it. I didn&#39;t want to argue with her anymore, I had forced myself to fall in love with enough things. Li Fei was very stubborn and added: I will definitely do the job I like in the future. I said you are much better than me. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;2.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Lin Sheng blinked his eyes, made a simple expression, and said with a sweet He asked me in a greasy voice: Listen to Manager Zhou, is it because of you that I got this job? I said: I don’t know where you heard the news, but it’s impossible for Zhou Yuanyuan to tell you this. Don&#39;t think too much. To me, interviewing is like choosing cabbage. The leaves of the other two cabbages interviewed in the same batch as yours are almost rotten. After comparison, you are indeed more suitable. Lin Sheng smiled and said: No matter what, I am able to join the job thanks to you. I will treat you to a meal after I get off work. I rejected her: No, I have a date tonight. She was a little unhappy: It&#39;s just a meal. What are you afraid of? Do you want to avoid suspicion? I said: I&#39;m not afraid. I can understand your feelings when you first arrived at the new company and wanted to be a team player, but you chose the wrong person. I&#39;m not very popular. Neither my boss nor my colleagues like me. It&#39;s useless for you to spend time with me. of. You have just graduated, and you may not know much about it. You are the assistant to the president, and everyone will be polite to you. As long as you take care of the big boss, you don&#39;t have to worry about anyone bullying you. She came closer to me and asked softly: Are you done? Which one can be done? I took a step back and told her: work hard. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The big boss seemed very satisfied with Lin Sheng and made her a regular employee half a month in advance. Zhou Yuanyuan had strong opinions on this matter and was helpless. When Lin Sheng came to our department to fill out the regularization form, Zhou Yuanyuan put on an expression of disgust. It was me who took Lin Sheng&#39;s suggestion in the first place. I knew that she would eventually vent all her grievances on me. After Lin Sheng completed the formalities and left, Zhou Yuanyuan pointed at me: You, come to my office. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I took a look at her desktop to make sure there was nothing sharp enough to be used as a weapon, then I pulled out a stool and sat down in front of her. You&#39;re pretty good at choosing people. Her voice was mean and high-pitched, like ten fingernails scratching on a blackboard. I looked at her and said: I know you are jealous, but I don&#39;t understand. Are you jealous that the big boss treats her well, or that she is younger and more beautiful than you, or both. Zhou Yuanyuan’s fists were clenched, and the bulging blood vessels were clearly visible. I knew that my words had angered her. She and I kept doing things that irritated each other every day. She was silent for a while, her mood eased slightly, and she said to me: It doesn&#39;t matter, just watch, she will eventually leave here like those employees who took the initiative to resign. I smiled: She can&#39;t leave, I don&#39;t care, I look forward to one day you can leave. I thought she would throw the stack of A4 papers in front of me at me when she heard what I said, but she didn&#39;t. With an unpredictable smile on her face, she squinted and said to me: You&#39;d better pray that she doesn&#39;t resign too soon, otherwise you will be the unlucky one. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Two months later, Lin Sheng resigned. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;She passed by my work station holding a large cardboard box, stopped, and looked at me: Please help me move the things. She looked panicked and her shoulders were shaking slightly. I hesitated for a moment, stood up, took the box from her hand, and followed her. I walked with her to the underground garage. She took out the car keys and opened the trunk. I put the box in my hand and looked back at Lin Sheng. She was crying. I asked her: What&#39;s wrong with you? She wiped it randomly with her hand and said: Did you know this already? I wondered: What do we know? She stared at me: Even if you don&#39;t know, Zhou Yuanyuan should know. I was confused: What on earth are you talking about? She suddenly smiled, with two obvious tears still hanging on her face, looking weird and weird. She took a deep breath and said lightly: Your boss, he is a beast. I was shocked: Is he bullying you? I can accompany you to the police. Lin Sheng suddenly laughed loudly, and her strange laughter echoed throughout the parking lot. Her laughter made me numb: Are you sick? What happened? She said: It&#39;s not me who&#39;s sick, it&#39;s you, it&#39;s this company. Then she got into the car, and a stream of dirty smoke spewed out from the back of the car. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I told Li Fei about this, and she pretended to be mysterious and said to me: Is the Lin Sheng you are talking about very beautiful and young? I said: Yes. She suddenly became excited: That&#39;s right, she was probably slept with by your big boss. I said: Why do you think about sleeping every day? She said: Stop pretending. I know you think so too, but you like to pretend to be serious. I just expressed your thoughts. I nodded: It turns out you know me so well, I don’t even know what I’m thinking about every day. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;After Lin Sheng resigned, I didn’t hear Zhou Yuanyuan mention the recruitment of assistants again for two months, until she called me to the office and said to me: Assistants are no longer recruited from outside. Too bad. Trouble, the person you found is not reliable enough. I recommended you to the big boss. I said: Are you fucking sick? Do you feel a sense of accomplishment by calling me around like a dog? Her lipstick was not evenly applied, and the sneer on her mouth looked even more sinister. She was very satisfied with my reaction and pretended to be helpless: If you have any objections, please tell the big boss. But there is no need. Anyway, it will be a matter of time before you resign. The company can also save a severance pay, which really makes me happy. I thought of the pen she threw at me. The day I picked it up, I should have plunged it into Zhou Yuanyuan&#39;s neck. I scanned her desk and couldn&#39;t find it. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Li Fei hopes that I can resign as soon as possible: Your big boss must have character flaws. He has had almost twenty assistants. Now it’s your turn. Doesn’t he even sleep with men? ? I refused her: I can&#39;t resign yet, I resigned, let&#39;s drink the northwest wind together? Li Fei looked at me tenderly: No, I will graduate from graduate school soon. When I find a suitable job, I will support you for a few months at most. I looked at her, trying to hide my pity: You may have stayed at school for too long. Let&#39;s put the resignation aside for now. There&#39;s nothing wrong with the assistant. Besides, the salary offered is many times what I am now. Don&#39;t worry about anything that hasn&#39;t happened yet. Li Fei turned over and changed her tone to an indifferent tone: &quot;It&#39;s up to you.&quot; &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;3.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;He was sitting on the office chair, with his back to me, looking out the window at the haze, Hold a cigarette between the index and middle fingers of your right hand and let it burn into long ash. I knocked carefully on the open door. He turned around and stared at me with a dry and stiff face. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;This is the first time I have met the big boss after two years of joining the company. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Since the assistants left one after another, I have been curious about him, and I have secretly imagined his appearance many times, thinking that he would be short, fat and greasy. But he was very thin, with clear bones on his face, and a dark complexion—not black, but dull and dull. His eye sockets were sunken, giving him a sickly look, like a person who was tired of breathing. His hair was abnormally thick, and his beard extended from his chin to his temples. It had sharp edges like a razor blade and looked carefully trimmed. When he saw me, he pointed to another desk outside the suite and said feebly: Go get busy. When he said this, his neck twitched unnaturally, and he made one or two strange sounds in his throat, like phlegm stuck in his throat. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I sat down at my desk. Office supplies were neatly placed on the table, and a pen was placed in the middle. It was exactly the same as the one Zhou Yuanyuan tried to use to murder me. I unscrewed the pen cap and drew a few lines on the blank A4 paper. The water flow was smooth and gentle, and the paper did not hang. How could she be willing to use such a handy pen to vent her anger. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Ever since I became my boss’s assistant, Zhou Yuanyuan has been waiting for me to resign. She probably couldn’t wait to handle my resignation procedures in person. We occasionally met in the elevator. She was obviously very proud and pretended not to care. Obviously, controlling my work brought her a lot of pleasure. I couldn&#39;t help but laugh when I saw her like this. Once I actually laughed out loud, and she immediately switched to looking at trash. I knew that in her eyes, I was not much different from a mental patient. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The assistant&#39;s job is easier than I thought. I just need to &quot;convey&quot; and &quot;record&quot; it. He is often away from the office. When I have free time, I can play with my mobile phone for a while and be lazy. The Internet speed here is much faster. When my assistant job was about to be completed for three months, the big boss said to me: The facilities on this floor...you can use them in normal times, it&#39;s okay...swimming... ; Keep fit and don’t play with your phone all the time. He spoke slowly and hissed like a deflated ball. I avoided his gaze, lowered my head and answered: Okay, I&#39;m sorry... He waved his hand, and I said nothing more. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In the evening, I was getting ready to get off work when there was movement from the swimming pool. At first I thought he was swimming, but then the sound became more and more strange. The sound of water splashing was messy and irregular, loud and dense, as if someone was slapping the water like crazy. I was worried that he was drowning, so I hurriedly walked over and saw a few clothes scattered on the edge of the pool. In the middle of the pool, there was a donkey, which was hitting the water with its front hooves. I was stunned for a moment and was about to call security. The donkey seemed to hear my movements. It turned its body, &quot;swimmed&quot; to the edge of the pool with its two front hooves, kicked up suddenly, walked slowly towards the pile of clothes scattered on the ground, put its head under the suit jacket, and its body trembled. The tail swung back and forth along with the butt. Gradually, the donkey&#39;s raised front hooves stretched forward and turned into the shape of two hands. The wet gray-brown hair gradually faded away, and the blood vessels were crisscrossed on it, and it was slowly covered by dull skin. When I moved my eyes upward, the donkey&#39;s long ears had disappeared, and what appeared in front of me was the dry and dull face of the big boss. I felt a ringing in my ears, and densely packed patterns of snowflakes came to my eyes. The world began to turn upside down, my stomach turned, and his skinny face gradually turned into a ball of black - I fainted. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;My boss is a donkey. This is his secret. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I woke up from the sofa in the office. The big boss was sitting on the chair. His hair was still wet, and he held a cigarette in his right hand. The ash had burned out for a long time, but it had not fallen off yet. He saw that I was awake and pointed to a cup of hot water on the coffee table. I cautiously sat up and drank the water in the glass. He put out his cigarette in the ashtray, and the long ash suddenly collapsed. He said: Now... you should know... why... those assistants... keep... leaving their jobs. His voice was weak and tired, but he had a vigorous and determined expression, and his eyes were bulging like goldfish. I looked at the fine bloodshot eyes on his eyes and his temples were twitching. I stood up tremblingly and went to get another glass of water. He continued: Actually...I...selected you. I asked him: Why me? He said: You look like... you don&#39;t care about anything. I said: Actually that&#39;s not the case, I care about money. He smiled: That... would be easier to handle. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Li Fei was lying on the bed, staring at the ceiling, and asked me absentmindedly: How many months have you been an assistant? It&#39;s already a record. My temples continued to hurt, and I said perfunctorily: Maybe. She said: Maybe your big boss is tired of all the hard work, so I won’t urge you to resign anymore. After saying that, she stretched out her right hand and raised it in front of herself, looking with satisfaction at the Tiffany bracelet I just gave her shining under the light. The donkey in the center of the swimming pool appeared in front of my eyes. It was covered in rough and dull hair. After being wetted by the water, it became strands and strands, which were also shining. I said to her: You are right. My current job allows me to get rid of Zhou Yuanyuan and earn a higher salary than before. I think it is good. Li Fei seemed very satisfied with my answer. She came over and kissed me on the cheek: I finished my thesis and ran a few campus recruitments last week. They were all pretty good. I can help you share some of the work in the future. I turned my head away from her overly tender eyes when she looked at me. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;After learning the big boss’s secret, he changed from his previous indifferent attitude, and his conversations with me became more intensive, even a little intimate, and he occasionally asked me to have dinner with him. He also asked me to attend several important decision-making meetings and take notes. Before this, I could only organize the meeting content through partial recordings. These changes made me very uncomfortable. I had no experience working for a donkey, and now, this donkey seemed like he wanted to be my friend. Zhou Yuanyuan was very dissatisfied with my current situation: I failed to resign as she wished, but instead gained the trust of the big boss and earned as much as her. She looked at me more viciously than before, wishing she had a sharp pen in her hand and pierced all of my eyes. I looked at her angry and resentful look, and a feeling of compassion arose in my heart: It&#39;s time for the grudge game between us to end, which kept irritating each other. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Before the meeting started, Zhou Yuanyuan unceremoniously ordered me to pour her coffee. I didn’t show any expression of resistance or disgust, and went up to her with a smile and took the cup from her hand. She was a little surprised by my compliance and muttered under her breath: You laugh so disgustingly. After I took the coffee, I handed the cup to her. She bumped my arm deliberately - the force was actually very light, and I poured the coffee into her laptop. She stood up hurriedly, pulled out some tissues and covered them on the keyboard. The white tissues were instantly dyed taupe. Zhou Yuanyuan quickly checked her clothes, and after confirming that she had not been spilled by coffee, she breathed a sigh of relief, and then shouted to me: &quot;Do you know how to do something? You are as stupid as a donkey!&quot; Everyone stopped sorting the documents and looked at us blankly. The sound of turning pages stopped suddenly, and the room fell into dead silence. I found the big boss among a dozen faces that looked almost identical. His face was ashen, and his originally gloomy face became even more weird and distorted. His hands were shaking all the time, his nostrils were shrinking with anger, and his eyes were bulging. It seemed like it was going to explode in the next second. And Zhou Yuanyuan was still immersed in the pleasure of insulting me in public, not knowing what she had done or said wrongly. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;That afternoon, Zhou Yuanyuan was fired. I told Li Fei about this, and she was very excited: Fortunately you didn&#39;t resign. Funny, she tried to force you away, but she suffered the consequences. You haven&#39;t told me why she was fired. I told her: Because I said something wrong. She was confused, but she didn&#39;t continue to ask, as if she suddenly remembered: By the way, I found a job, the same position as you, assistant to the president. I originally felt that my major was not suitable for me and wanted to give up, but the salary was really not low. It’s just that the big boss always seemed weak when he spoke. Could he be suffering from some illness? &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;Editor in charge: Nana&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For information about the call for submissions, please see the @ONE Studio pinned on Weibo.
