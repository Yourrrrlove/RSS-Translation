Or looking for a change? &lt;/p>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div>;&lt;/div>; &lt;div>; Yekada&lt;/div>; &lt;div>; &lt;p>;&lt;div contenteditable=&quot;false&quot;>;&lt;img data-author=&quot;&quot; data-original -src=&quot;http://image.wufazhuce.com/FjFqh05rje-raPzvJ-TUVGZ_i-YP&quot; data-source=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://image.wufazhuce.com/FjFqh05rje-raPzvJ-TUVGZ_i-YP&quot;>; &lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Faced with this problem, I recall that when I graduated from college and got together with my friends, everyone drank and drank drunkenly, smiling and promising &quot;forever young, forever filled with tears.&quot; ” Declaration of youth. Later, whenever I was beaten down by the pressure of work and the embarrassment of life, and I had to settle for perfection, I couldn&#39;t help but think back to the passion of that year. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I asked my friend: Do you like yourself now? &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;She replied: I don’t like it, but I don’t hate it either. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I asked again: Do you think it’s worth it for you to make yourself suffer in order to live? &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;She answered awkwardly but with dignity: You must first adapt to the rules before you can change them. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I have asked my heart repeatedly at night, &lt;strong>;Does patience mean adapting to obedience, does adapting to obedience mean complicity&lt;/strong>;, and finally Will that dragon-slaying boy really turn into a dragon? &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The young heart is like a triangle rolling on the boundless land of life. As it rolls, the edges and corners are worn to pieces. Therefore&lt;strong>;Some people choose to become a smooth circle, so their road becomes smoother and smoother, and their speed is so fast; some people still don’t want to change their original intentions easily, but are tortured by the pain of collisions. You have to question your life and ask yourself whether you should endure or change. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;My answer is that when we find that life is not as smooth as a fairy tale, when people and the objective environment (people, things, and things other than ourselves) ) When a conflict occurs, you cannot rely on others to be merciful and help, or you can just let things go and wait for fate to take care of you. Instead, you should look to yourself and wait for the opportunity. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;First of all, we must make it clear that rational patience does not mean &quot;being a coward and letting others bully&quot;, but the patience of &quot;hiding a dragon, don&#39;t use it&quot; and being able to endure &quot;humiliation under the crotch&quot; ; realm. All of this has a purpose - when one&#39;s own strength is insufficient, &quot;Don&#39;t waste time growing up,&quot; practice quietly and wait for yourself to become stronger. &lt;strong>;As long as our core is stable, our chassis is solid, and our trajectory is upward, no matter how humiliated we are, one day we will become strong enough to overthrow everything we had to endure. . &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Momentary outbursts, heroic acts, and emotional catharsis cannot change your situation, nor can you change the things you hate. They can only &quot;momentarily happy, crematorium&quot; to put yourself in a more short-sighted situation. , a more exposed and disadvantaged position. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;So,&lt;strong>;If your patience is meaningful and promising, then endure it again. Children who know how to delay gratification will be rewarded with more candies. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Secondly, if you have thought through the above and still cannot bear it, then there is no need to bear it anymore. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;But my suggestion is that instead of changing yourself, leave immediately. If you are forced to change, just change some external and unimportant things. If we always change easily, will that person still be ourselves? How can we be truly happy? &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;For a person, the most important thing is the values ​​​​that he chooses to live and fight for - values ​​​​determine who we choose to accompany us, and determine our entire life The ultimate goal pursued diligently. &lt;/strong>;A person&#39;s appearance can undergo countless changes, but his values ​​​​are often constant, just like the rose carefully cared for by the little prince, which is as unique and only belongs to him. And all the behaviors and characteristics displayed by this person are just the appearance and product of value selection and processing. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Being with people or groups that don’t share your values ​​is simply the most painful thing in the world. As the saying goes, good birds choose trees to roost in, and wise ministers choose their masters to serve. Instead of being cut off and subject to chaos,&lt;strong>;why not leave the unsuitable environment and change the things you value most? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;If values ​​can be changed at will, then where is the dignity and significance of human beings that are different from lower animals? &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Promise me - don&#39;t change easily due to the noise of the outside world, and protect those precious things. Then, don’t surrender or give up easily. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Because this is the only possibility I can think of to prevent life from becoming a puppet and prevent life from decaying. &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;Editor in charge: Mei Butan onewenti@wufazhuce.com&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For the call for papers information, please see @ONE Studio pinned on Weibo.

In this article, the author Wang Daye presupposes the worst situation between friends. Making friends is risky, and you need to be careful when borrowing money. I hope you can take this article as a lesson. &lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;As a person, I guess I am afraid of poverty, and I am most afraid of others borrowing money. why? Afraid of borrowing money but not repaying it, afraid of losing face. Mr. Lu Xun’s talk about the bad nature of the nation is very insightful, but I think there is still one thing missing, and that is borrowing money. As we all know, in our country, those who owe money are uncles, who must be provided for, taken care of, and served well. Every holiday, I send you a sentimental quote: In March, the grass grows and the orioles fly. In this prosperous season, has your salary been paid? Has the project payment come down? If it comes down, then look at the 5,000 yuan you lent me three years ago...the ellipses must be added to indicate that you are hesitant to speak and put a little psychological pressure on the other party. However, most of the other people don&#39;t like this. They dress in mink, drink wine, hug girls, and say directly in the bar: What, Brother Wang, I remember your money. The project funds have come in, but my brother has been very busy recently. He has another job before spring, and the capital chain cannot be turned around. Please wait a few days, ah. He said it as if the building couldn&#39;t be built without your five thousand yuan. After waiting for a long time, until the day when the money is finally paid back, the depository will make you burst into tears. The loss and recovery is an understatement, and pie in the sky is not as exciting as pie in the sky. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;It happened to be the weekend when Lao Zhao lent me the money. I finally had a day off, cracked two bags of melon seeds and played games. Then Xiao Liu called me and asked me to go fishing. Xiao Liu and Lao Zhao are both colleagues in the company. I joined the company not long ago. I changed jobs last year and have been working for three and a half months. Xiao Liu is similar. He just graduated from college, has a clever mind, and is very good at flattering. Only Lao Zhao is a veteran employee of the company, and he can be said to be the second-in-command. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Xiao Liu called me. I didn’t want to go. There was no good location for this. But Xiao Liu yelled on the phone, and Lao Zhao was also there, and he left me a second side. The fish were prosperous, and a lot of fish were caught. I looked at the sky outside. The sun was shining brightly. I hadn’t gone fishing in a long time. I couldn&#39;t get up so early in the morning, so I had to cherish the opportunity I had. Besides, it wouldn&#39;t be easy to flatter Xiao Liu. Fishing was also a way to build closer relationships. I told my wife to put my backpack on and went out. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The weather is really nice and the sun is shining brightly. Old Zhao was on the big side, I was on the second side, and Xiao Liu went outside to buy water. Looking around, dozens of fishing rods are constantly going up and down by the lake, making people feel like the fish are queuing up and waiting to take the bait. I opened my backpack and assembled the fishhook. At this moment, Xiao Liu came back and said: Brother Wang is here, I have been waiting for you for a long time. I smiled and asked: Xiao Liu doesn’t fish? Xiao Liu said: &quot;Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll catch a cucumber egg and see how good the two guys are. Brother Zhao was very powerful a while ago, and he can catch one accurately every time.&quot; After hearing this, Lao Zhao turned his face and said: Hey, just so-so, it all depends on luck. You see, not all of them have run away now. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I don’t like to talk much about fishing. I concentrate on it as a career. Over there, Xiao Liu moved a bench and was already chatting with Lao Zhao. The two of them started chatting about their parents, about the situation between China and the United States, and then about eating, drinking, whoring and gambling. Each of them laughed louder than the other. I squeezed in between them and felt my ears grinding. I couldn&#39;t help it anymore, so I stood up and said, &quot;Xiao Liu, how about we switch sides?&quot; Xiao Liu was stunned and said: Oh, Brother Wang, I&#39;m sorry, maybe our two men have affected your fishing. I quickly waved my hand and said: No, no, don’t switch sides, it’s easier for you two to communicate. At this time, Lao Zhao said: Let&#39;s change, Xiao Liu, Brother Wang is getting addicted to fishing right now! Let&#39;s not disturb other people&#39;s interest. After hearing this, Xiao Liu stared at the phone with one hand and lifted the bench with the other hand to change with me. I also stood up. At this moment, Lao Zhao suddenly grabbed my arm and said: Lao Wang, you can just sit on the big side and fish. I am also wasting resources. Xiao Liu, please sit down and rest. Xiao Liu was playing a game at that time. He threw his head downwards and shouted &quot;Ming Shiyin&quot;. I had no choice but to pat Lao Zhao and say: I&#39;m sorry. Old Zhao laughed and said: You&#39;re welcome, there&#39;s no need to be so serious about catching a fish. My face turned red and I quickly said: Yes, yes. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;There are indeed a lot of fish in Dabian, but several of them felt like they were hooked, sucked and ran away again. I repeated this several times, which made me feel quite bad, and I was disturbed several times. Lao Zhao saw it and asked: What bait did you use? I said: I didn’t use any good bait, just some reeds and grass. When Lao Zhao heard this, he said: That won&#39;t work. There are a lot of crucian carp here, so we have to use small particles of sweet bait. I was stunned and said: You know it, I haven&#39;t heard the words you said. Lao Zhao said: If you fish a few times, you will understand everything. If you use reeds and grass, they are used to catch grass carp. I said: Is this still true? Old Zhao chuckled and said: Of course, grass carp, of course it eats grass. I said: It makes sense. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In the evening of fishing, my wife called and asked me to go home for dinner. I don’t really want to go back. Where did I catch it? Lao Zhao and Xiao Liu were also advising beside them, saying: After finally coming out, my sister-in-law will let Brother Wang have a good time. When the wife heard that there was a colleague nearby, she smiled and said: &quot;Then you two should be optimistic about him, don&#39;t let him catch him and end up in the lake.&quot; &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;After fishing for a while, I felt tired. I looked at my net bag and saw eight crucian carp, two carp, and a bunch of shrimp and loach. He was also hungry, so Xiao Liu suggested eating braised noodles. He knew there was a local restaurant not far from here. I went there with my pocket in hand. The noodles were really good. I ordered a small bowl of mutton. Xiao Liu and Lao Zhao ate two large bowls of beef, two plates of cold dishes, three heads of sugar and garlic, and then drank a bottle of Erguotou. Xiao Liu was still young. He and I took turns guessing, but we both failed miserably. Erguotou did half the job. After eating and drinking enough, Lao Zhao stood up and said he should go to the toilet to pee. I nodded, already thinking about paying the bill. Logically speaking, I should pay for this meal, and it&#39;s not expensive. It just so happens that they invited me to fish. While he was thinking about it, Xiao Liu had already waved to the waiter. I hurried up and said, &quot;I&#39;ll treat you to this meal.&quot; Xiao Liu stood up, waved his hand and said: Brother Wang, no need! The price of a meal, we are all colleagues, no matter who pays for it! I stretched Xiao Liu&#39;s arm and tried to push him down on the table, but the young man was so angry that he pushed me down again noisily. I didn’t bring any change, so I put Alipay on the table. As soon as I drew it out and scanned it, I heard a beep, fifty-nine yuan, and Xiao Liu had already paid the money. At this time, Lao Zhao also came out slowly, shaking the water on his fingers, and said: Are you all full? &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Xiao Liu was half-conscious after drinking, and I thought about going back early. Xiao Liu said: It’s not a big deal, I’m not drunk, I’ll go shopping for a while, then I won’t follow. I had no choice but to hold Xiao Liu in my arms, and the three of us wandered along the river. After wandering around for a long time, I happened to encounter a fishing gear shop. Xiao Liu mumbled and said: Brother Zhao, don’t you want to change your fishing rod? Go and have a look. After saying that, he pushed Lao Zhao into the store. When we got inside, there were indeed many good poles. Xiao Liu drank too much and was confused on the sofa in the store. I was just a &quot;wild fisherman&quot; and couldn&#39;t see the door. Only Lao Zhao, with his hands behind his back, faced a group of people. I kept looking back and forth while arranging the fishing rods. After a while, Lao Zhao stopped in front of a black and blue pole. Now that I think about it, I was really mean at that time. I actually stood up and walked over with my hands behind my back and said, &quot;This rod looks good.&quot; Lao Zhao was watching in concentration, and when he turned around, he realized it was me. She smiled evilly. Of course, I didn&#39;t notice whether she was evil or not at the time. It was all an afterthought. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Lao Zhao asked me: Do you know what this pole is? I shook my head and said: I don’t know. Lao Zhao said: This is a high-carbon rod, Dawa brand, imported from Japan. I went up and touched it and asked: It must be expensive, right? At this time the boss came over and said: Buy a pole? Lao Zhao said: Just take a look. The boss said: Then you have caught up with the good times. Now this pole has activity, and the carbon content is 95%. It only costs 1,500 yuan, which is 2,000 yuan less than the original price. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;When I heard this number, my heart skipped a beat. The pole I&#39;m using now only costs 200 yuan. This pole can hold me seven or eight times. After hearing this, Lao Zhao took the pole in his hand, knocked it here, and pulled it there. He was so frightened that the boss shouted next to him: What do you do if you break it? Lao Zhao said: How can it be folded? I just touched it lightly, but the force was not as strong as that of a carp. The boss asked again: Do you want to buy it? Lao Zhao said: One thousand and five? Make it cheaper. The boss said: We can’t make it any cheaper. No matter how cheap it is, we won’t be able to get our money back. Lao Zhao said: It’s still cheaper, and it’s not a loss. The two started a price war there, and Xiao Liu also became confused and asked me: Where is Brother Zhao buying a fishing rod? I said: Yes, I am bargaining there. Xiao Liu took out a cigarette from his pocket, and I quickly waved my hand and said not to smoke. Xiao Liu said: Brother Wang is a cultural person, and I could tell it when I first entered the company. I asked: How can you be a cultural person if you don’t smoke? Xiao Liu said: It’s hard to explain, but there is a sense of distance and mystery. Unlike Brother Zhao and I, it’s easy to get along. It is said that people tell the truth after drinking. When I heard Xiao Liu&#39;s words, I felt a little embarrassed, thinking that I was too pretentious and had not integrated into the company. At this moment, the boss clapped his hands and said: OK, one thousand and two is one thousand and two. After saying that, he went to wrap the pole. Xiao Liu and I got together and asked: Is the negotiation done? Lao Zhao said: It’s done. Xiao Liu said: Brother Zhao, why did you only cut a few hundred yuan? It’s not like your style. Lao Zhao said: That&#39;s right. I&#39;ve seen this pole before. It costs at least 1,800 yuan in other stores. I said: There can’t be anything bad about this pole, right? Lao Zhao said: If you touch it, you will know whether it is stable or not. Besides, it also comes with a one-and-a-half-year warranty, which is worth the price. I nodded and said: That&#39;s OK. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;At this time, Lao Zhao touched the waistband of his trousers with both hands and touched the two pockets. He suddenly panicked, clapped his hands, and sighed &quot;Hey&quot;. I asked: What&#39;s wrong, Lao Zhao? No money? Lao Zhao said: Yes, I once slipped my mobile phone into the lake while fishing, but I never dared to take it. My wallet was still in the car and I forgot to take it. Xiao Liu said: It’s okay, Brother Zhao, I’ll scan your WeChat account first! When I saw this scene, I felt stingy if I didn&#39;t show off. I happened to have my own wallet, so I pushed Xiao Liu away with the strength of my drink and said: &quot;Old Zhao, how much is the difference? I&#39;ll pay for it for you!&quot; &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Lao Zhao shouted from the side: No, no, no, why is this so embarrassing? Xiao Liu was also chanting beside him: Brother Wang, I’ll come, I’ll come. There was a melee between the three parties, and only the boss stood there calmly drinking tea. I couldn&#39;t lose. I was so dizzy at the time, that was all I thought. I pushed Xiao Liu away hard: Regardless of our age, Lao Zhao and I can be your uncles. You paid for the meal just now. Uncle Wang, no, Brother Wang, I am already old and reluctant. Lao Zhao supported me and said: Lao Wang, you must have drunk too much. I shouted loudly and said: I didn’t drink too much! Then add the bills in your wallet and tell the boss to settle the bill! &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Was I awesome at that time? Fucking awesome! There was a total of one thousand yuan in the wallet, and I paid for it all. Xiao Liu later added two hundred yuan. I don’t remember much about what happened next. I just remember that the three of us walked away for a while, arm in arm, and the new fishing rod that Lao Zhao bought was so hard that it touched my neck. When I wandered over to Lao Zhao&#39;s Cadillac, I thought that Lao Zhao was going to get me money, but when I got in, I made a phone call and asked for a driver. Xiao Liu and Lao Zhao followed the road and watched the two people leaving in the dust. They had no choice but to fall down in confusion and walk back home. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I woke up at almost noon the next day. I didn’t sleep well all night. There seemed to be countless crucian carp jumping around in my mind. As soon as I put on my clothes, my wife came over with a sulky look on her face and asked me how much I drank yesterday. I scratched my head and said: Not much, less than half a catty. The daughter-in-law said: I&#39;m brave, but I drift off after drinking too much. Look at your wallet, has it been stolen by a thief? I just remembered to stuff you a thousand dollars the day before yesterday, and now I only have a few steel coins! &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;After my wife finished speaking, my heart skipped a beat, and I hurriedly checked to see that it was indeed just steel. After rummaging through the mezzanine, I remembered that I lent it to Old Zhao yesterday! My wife asked me: Why did you lend him money? I said: How about borrowing money from colleagues? The daughter-in-law said: It’s okay, just borrow and pay back. I said: Look, Lao Zhao bought a fishing rod yesterday, but he didn’t take his mobile phone. Xiao Liu and I helped him get it together. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;After lunch, Xiao Liu called again and asked if he could go fishing? I ask, is it still a big side? Xiao Liu laughed and said, what does Brother Wang want? Dongfeng Lake, just grab a seat and chat, Brother Zhao is also here, hurry up after eating. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;When I heard that Lao Zhao was there, I thought he could go and pay me back the money. It was windy that day and there were no people at the lake. Lao Zhao and Xiao Liu were wearing big pants and had already eaten melon seeds all over the ground. I saw the Dawa fishing rod at a glance, black and blue, shiny. When Lao Zhao saw me coming, he kicked the melon seed skins into the lake with his feet and asked me to come over and sit down quickly. The three of us sat down, and Lao Zhao handed me the pole and said: Fishing? I said: OK. When you hold it in your hand, it is very light. When you swing the rod, it is like water flowing down, it is light and natural. Although the pole is good, I know it does not belong to me. I handed the pole back to Lao Zhao. Lao Zhao took the pole and said, &quot;Let&#39;s fish for a while longer.&quot; I said: No, your pole is too good and I can’t bear it. Although my pole is weak, I can use it with ease. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I said this to remind Lao Zhao that the pole is yours, but the one thousand yuan is mine. But Lao Zhao and Xiao Liu just laughed after hearing this. Xiao Liu said: Brother Wang, you have to go to higher places. If you have a pole of one to two hundred, you can fish crucian carp, if you have a pole of one to two thousand, you can fish for bass, and if you have a pole of one to two thousand, you can fish for goldfish. Fish made of gold! Lao Zhao said: Xiao Liu can say this better than I can. Xiao Liu scratched his head and said: Where is it? At this time, Lao Zhao waved his hand, swung his big gold watch, and said: &quot;This way, after fishing, I will treat everyone to dinner!&quot; When I heard this, I felt a chill in my heart. There is no free lunch in the world, and this meal would probably cost a thousand yuan. But then I thought about it, it’s okay to treat me to a big meal for 1,000 yuan. We are all colleagues and it’s really hard to ask. If you can treat me to Yueyang Tower for a meal, and then drive a Cadillac to take a bath and sing a song. , also counts as the same thing. Unexpectedly, Lao Zhao then said: If we eat fish, we should eat the fish we catch ourselves! &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;There were three small crucian carp and one big grass carp. Old Zhao drove his Cadillac and not even walked half a kilometer when he arrived in front of a shantytown Sichuan restaurant. He said this is the place. I know the owner of this restaurant. Although the appearance is poor, cooking is a skill! When I looked at the door curtain, there was a fan whirring inside. The three of us could not spend more than 200 yuan, plus we had to pay for the food ourselves, so if we share it, we would have to pay for the processing fee. My heart felt cold, but I still comforted myself: What if Lao Zhao paid back the money while eating this meal? Don&#39;t think too badly of people. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Entering the hotel, there was a middle-aged man in his forties or fifties, stooped at the waist. When he saw the figure of Lao Zhao, he turned around with a &quot;clang&quot; sound. At this time, Lao Zhao shouted: Lao Li, where are you sitting? After the man heard this, he turned around while holding the table, wiped his nose with the handkerchief on his shoulder and came up to him, saying: Lao Zhao is here, sit down, sit down, sit down with your friends, you are welcome, sit down wherever you want. , what do you want to eat today? Lao Zhao picked up the bucket and said: Lao Li, please make these fishes today. Lao Li&#39;s face darkened and he asked: Did you do everything? Lao Zhao said: Yes, the crucian carp is fried and crispy, and the grass carp is stewed. Yes, yes, yes, I almost forgot about you guys. Braised in braised, steamed or stewed in beer, which one to choose? Xiao Liu said: Braise it in braised sauce, add more spiciness, this will be the best. Asked me again: OK? I wanted to say no, I can&#39;t eat spicy food, but I didn&#39;t want to offend Xiao Liu, so I had to say: No problem, OK. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Lao Li was going to cook fish, and there was a sound of sizzling fish coming from the kitchen. The three of us sat down, Xiao Liu called the waiter, Lao Zhao smiled and said: I guess Lao Li&#39;s wife hasn&#39;t come yet. Xiao Liu said &quot;Oh&quot; twice and said: Well, Lao Li is very busy at the moment. By the way, Brother Zhao, what is your relationship with Lao Li? Lao Zhao said: Lao Li and I used to be high school classmates. Lao Li&#39;s family is in a poor family, so I will help him if I can. Xiao Liu sighed, then gave a thumbs up and said: Brother Zhao, you are really kind-hearted. Old Zhao laughed and said: It depends on what you said, Brother Wang next to you is a great philanthropist. I smiled sheepishly and said: No, no, no. What Lao Zhao said was to praise me, but I always felt that it was not the same. The kindness of a great benevolent person is like an eel, slippery and disgusting. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;After saying that, the three of us just sat there. I couldn&#39;t help it anymore, so I picked up the recipe and said, &quot;How about I write down two dishes first and give them to Lao Li so he can cook them later.&quot; After hearing this, Lao Zhao put the recipe on the table again, waved his hand and said: Hey, forget it, Lao Wang, the master is here again now, Lao Li&#39;s wife hasn&#39;t come yet, so let&#39;s not add any more trouble. I had no choice but to give up. Seeing that I didn&#39;t speak anymore, Lao Zhao curled his lips, quickly touched his beard, and said: Otherwise, Xiao Liu, you go and bring two plates of cold dishes and three bottles of beer, and we&#39;ll drink them first. After hearing this, Xiao Liu said &quot;Okay&quot;, then got up and went to the counter to load the cold dishes. I ordered two plates, one with yuba, fungus, and peanuts, and the other with gluten, celery, and lentils. The old village chief opened the wine, the five-yuan kind, which was very spicy, but the fish was not good either. Maybe there were too many people and Lao Li didn&#39;t cook it carefully. Maybe the fish in Dongfeng Lake was really not that good. Anyway, today&#39;s dish didn&#39;t taste very good. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I don’t like to talk. During the whole scene, only Lao Zhao and Xiao Liu were chatting away. Xiao Liu was still blushing and gave a piece of fish to Lao Zhao. Their faces were close to each other and they were as red as a monkey&#39;s buttocks. Xiao Liu rubbed his hands and said: Brother Zhao will be more responsible in the company from now on. Lao Zhao patted Xiao Liu&#39;s back with his left hand wearing a big gold watch and said: That&#39;s nothing. Xiao Liu added: The main thing is cargo insurance. I wasn’t familiar with it a few days ago. I didn’t do it well, which caused losses to our company, and the boss... Before Xiao Liu could finish, Lao Zhao stretched out his hand. He waved his right hand holding the chopsticks and said, &quot;It&#39;s not a big problem. I&#39;ll talk to the boss!&quot; Xiao Liu quickly shouted: Thank you, thank you, I brought this cup. After saying half a cup, the old village chief went straight to it. It was so spicy that the boy gritted his teeth. Lao Zhao pointed at the crucian carp that had been poked to pieces with his chopsticks again, and muttered: I have people for freight, including sales, and even after-sales. real. Ah, whether our company is big or small, except for the boss, I can basically handle all the little things. Do you understand what I mean? Xiao Liu shrank his neck and kept shouting: &quot;Understand, understand, understand.&quot; &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;As I listened to what the two of them said, I knew I couldn’t say anything, so I had to sit and drink. After Lao Zhao finished speaking, he saw me sitting in the corner, clapped his hands, burped, and called me over with the hand wearing the gold watch, saying: I&#39;m sorry, Lao Wang, we were so busy talking that we almost forgot about you. I quickly said: It’s okay. Lao Zhao held Xiao Liu in his left hand and me in his right hand, smacked his lips, sighed and said: Seriously, let me tell you the truth, don&#39;t call me hypocritical. I am so lucky to have met you two in the company. Xiao Liu said: Brother Zhao, what you said is so serious. I reluctantly followed suit and said: We are all colleagues, as we should. Lao Zhao went on to say: As the old saying goes, a person&#39;s life is only as long as he has a close friend. Look at me, I got two at once, I&#39;m really, really happy. Xiao Liu handles things openly and quickly; Lao Wang, you are also a great writer in our company. From time to time, you help me, a big boss, draft a few manuscripts. I&#39;m looking at this year&#39;s party, so I won&#39;t let my boss buy the script. Lao Wang, just you write it! I won’t watch it without you! Xiao Liu followed up: Yes, the manuscripts written by our brother Wang are better than those of Xinhua News Agency! I thought to myself, let me write? It would definitely be free for me to write it, and maybe Lao Zhao would eat the script fee. Lao Zhao went on to say: The friendship between the three of us does not stop at work. We also have friendship outside of work, and that is fishing. Yesterday, I distributed the fishing rods you two bought for me to the fishing group. All the fishermen said it was great and envied me having such good colleagues like you two! Good confidant! &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;After leaving the hotel, Lao Zhao and Xiao Liu stopped by and called a driver to drive away. I watched the thick smoke and exhaust fumes emitted by the Cadillac alone, and the vehicle gradually moved away, and I realized that my thousand yuan was hanging in the balance. Although Xiao Liu also chipped in the money, he definitely didn&#39;t lose. For two hundred yuan, he got closer to Lao Zhao and got one thing done. And me? One thousand yuan bought two plates of cold dishes. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Back home, my wife is making pickles. A few days ago, my father-in-law suffered a serious illness. He was a smoker and had advanced lung cancer. He spent a lot of money on treatment. His life was saved, but it was still a maintenance. He had to pay for it in the future. My family is not in peace either. There was a flood in my hometown and the living room was completely washed away. It cost 20,000 to 30,000 yuan to repair it. Coupled with the mortgage debt that lasts for thirty years, life is as overwhelming as a mountain. My wife and I both come from rural families, so we haven’t dared to have children even after being married for almost five years. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;During meal time, my wife took out the accounting book from under the dining table and began to calculate the recent expenses again. The wife holds a three-color pen: red, blue, and black. Small ledgers are black, medium ledgers are blue, and large ledgers are red. The black one was pressed down by my wife, and I didn&#39;t change it for three minutes. I was chewing on the spicy cabbage, feeling uneasy. Sure enough, my wife pressed the blue button, raised her head and asked me: Did Zhao return the thousand yuan to you? I got stuck in a mouthful of cabbage, gasped for air, swallowed a sip of water, and said: No. The wife said: Didn’t you go to see him today? I said: Where are you looking? Didn’t they ask us to go fishing? The daughter-in-law asked in a stiff tone: Is there any difference? I said: Why don’t you have it? It’s only one thousand yuan. How can you still ask for it after you? After hearing this, the daughter-in-law clapped her chopsticks, and the glass table buzzed, and said: Why, you have become a rich man, and a thousand yuan seems to be missing? When my wife got angry, I also lost my temper and said, &quot;It&#39;s quite a lot, but I really can&#39;t say it out loud.&quot; The daughter-in-law said: Why can&#39;t you tell me? It&#39;s only right to pay back debts! I said: It&#39;s natural, but I drank too much at that time, so the money has an emotional component. It can be borrowed or given. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;After hearing this, my wife frowned and raised her right index finger to point at my nose: It’s not like you don’t know what kind of family we are. The debt is almost chasing your ass, so you’re starting to pretend this time. If it&#39;s one or two hundred, just give it as a share of the money. Good guy, as soon as you get emotional, a thousand yuan will be gone. How will I live in the future? As my wife spoke, she kept patting me with her hand. While patting me, she shouted, &quot;Prodigal son!&quot; spendthrift! &amp;rdquo;I was also angry, put down my chopsticks, and shouted: I won’t eat anymore! &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;That night, the suffocation continued. I was lying on the sofa in the living room, listening to the noisy cars outside, and felt mixed emotions in my heart. What the wife said makes sense. She is so poor, so why are she pretending? Tell Lao Zhao directly to return the thousand yuan to me. But how to say this? It was true that the money was his, but he didn&#39;t know how to get rid of it. It seemed that no matter how he asked Lao Zhao for money, he would lose face. Yes, that’s right, losing face. The poorer a person is, the more he cares about face. I remember when I was in college, I never dared to tell my classmates that I was from a rural area. Even when I was writing a poverty subsidy, I would hide in a corner alone and then secretly hand it in after I finished writing. On the contrary, those students in the class who were fashionably dressed and well-dressed not only copied their poverty applications online, but also went around to build relationships and treat them to meals, and finally received the poverty subsidies with great fanfare and glory. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Thinking of this, I suddenly felt &quot;hot-blooded&quot;. I opened WeChat and switched to Lao Zhao&#39;s column. I quickly pressed &quot;Are you there, Lao Zhao&quot; on the window and immediately clicked send? . After a while, Lao Zhao responded to me, and it was a voice message. I clicked play. It seemed that Lao Zhao was in a restaurant, where people were drinking and drinking, and it was really lively. Lao Zhao breathed out the smell of alcohol and said: Hey, Lao Wang, I am here, drinking. I&#39;m with a group of aquarists, I&#39;m a little drunk, we&#39;ll talk later. By the way, um... and what else, yes, yes, I will send you the QR code of the fishing group chat later, Xiao Liu is also there. If you don’t understand anything about fishing in the future, feel free to chat inside. That’s all. I won’t talk anymore. I’ll drink first. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;After listening to the voice, I was just thinking about what to say, when Lao Zhao sent me the QR code, and also took a video of them eating to me: I know the hotel, it’s the Yueyang Tower, it’s magnificent, The dishes on the carousel are also full of dishes, which is many times better than Lao Li&#39;s restaurant. And next to Lao Zhao, I also found a familiar figure, Xiao Liu. It seems that I have been kicked out of the inner circle by Lao Zhao. I stared at the QR code he sent me, and I just felt that those black and white lines were twisting and turning. If I was in it, I might not be able to get out. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I didn’t scan the QR code. When I came to the company the next day, I thought Lao Zhao would ask me, but unfortunately he didn’t. I know that the processed crucian carp and this QR code are all Lao Zhao&#39;s chips to replace the thousand yuan. Unfortunately, this chip is not equal in my opinion. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;This incident made me wary of Lao Zhao, and gradually, I began to stay away from Lao Zhao’s circle. However, the company is so big, and if I leave Lao Zhao&#39;s circle, I am basically alone. Many times, I came to Lao Zhao&#39;s work station and watched him casually chatting with his colleagues during work breaks. Just because he is a popular person around the boss, all kinds of social interactions and conversations are inseparable from Lao Zhao&#39;s sharp teeth. But in my eyes, Lao Zhao’s teeth have become fangs. And when I got home, my wife&#39;s three-color pen also made me extremely afraid. Although she no longer mentioned the one thousand yuan, her pressure on the end of the pen every time I ate made me tremble. In my spare time, I didn’t dare to go fishing at the lake anymore, for fear of running into Lao Zhao and not knowing what to say. I&#39;m afraid of meeting him, even though he obviously owes me. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;There were many times when I thought about forgetting it and shouted magnanimously in my heart: It’s just a matter of one thousand yuan. But even if I could agree, life won&#39;t. When I encounter shoes that I want to buy but can&#39;t bear to buy, or food that I want to eat but don&#39;t dare to eat, all these money-related things will remind me of the one thousand yuan: as if only that one thousand yuan can come back to me. In my hands, I can get everything I want. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I started to try to make some extra money and worked overtime, and my monthly salary was almost one or two thousand yuan. However, these multiple times of money could not make up for the one thousand yuan. The harm to me. Time passed faster and faster, and I hoped that time would help me forget this. However, just when I was about to succeed, a turning point suddenly happened: my father-in-law&#39;s lung cancer worsened and he was admitted to the ICU. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;My wife also has a sister, but she has already married away and is unwilling to pay a penny more.残酷的人生让人变得冷漠，我看着躺在病床上干瘪的老丈人，内心生出了邪念，希望他能早早死去，不再连累我的家庭。媳妇日夜忙碌，虽然才三十出头，但鬓角已然有了白发。她辞去了工作，专心照顾父亲，放缓了生活节奏，但只有一件事却愈加变得频繁：记账。本子上的红色字迹越发变多，笔芯颜色的转化也愈加频繁，噼里啪啦的响动，搅动得我心情烦躁。我告诉妻子：别记了，记得再多，开销也不会变少。妻子抬起头，叹了口气，说：不记，不记心痒痒，总觉得是种罪过。在巨大的压力之下，看来妻子早已忘了那一千块。但是不知怎么的，我却对那一千块念念不忘。是啊，一千块是我的，为什么自己都不敢去要一下？一千块是老赵亲手拿的，为什么他就没有一丝羞愧？ &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;翻来覆去想了好久，终于，我决定了，要与老赵来次开诚布公的交涉，要回我那一千块钱。这件事我考虑了很久，也准备了很久。每次上班，我都会看着老赵那颗光秃秃的头颅，思考如何开口。直接讲&amp;ldquo;老赵，还了我那一千块吧&amp;rdquo;，听起来没有人情味。我觉得还是得绕着来，通过一个点，布置迷雾，引诱老赵上钩。用什么钩呢？鱼钩。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;计划是这样，周末大清早，邀请老赵顺便还有小刘，仨人一块在湖边钓鱼。老赵也欠了小刘钱，没人跟钱过不下去。到时候时机成熟，直接向老赵发难，逼他还掉我那一千块钱。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;周末五点，我趁着夜色，也没跟妻子讲就出去了。骑了一个共享单车，四月清晨还泛着凉气，手冻得直哆嗦，半骑半晃荡中，我便来到了东风湖。四野无人，我找了个大边坐下，裹紧帽子，抛下鱼竿，突然感觉这事儿挺别扭的。我一直等到了八点多，才敢给老赵和小刘打电话。期间的两个多小时，我手握鱼竿，湖面平静，但却总感觉有什么力量在牵引我的手臂。九点半，老赵跟小刘如约来临。老赵戴了个鸭舌帽，揣着保温杯，站在台阶上，对着坐在小板凳的我笑眯眯地讲：老王来得挺早呀。我说：是，七点就来了。突然来了瘾。你俩快坐吧，湖里的鱼可闹腾呢。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;钓了半个多小时，我几乎没跟老赵说一句话。反倒是小刘跟老赵谈得欢腾。言语中，我听到小刘要调到市场部做管理了，那可是个肥差事。我鼓起勇气，把凳子往二人身边挪了挪，问他俩在谈啥。小刘这时瞥了一下我，眼神已经没有了以往那种恭敬。他不耐烦地说了句&amp;ldquo;没啥&amp;rdquo;。我吃了瘪，阵脚大乱，不知如何是好。这时老赵嘿嘿笑了声，说：就侃了侃国家大事，老王，你怎么不钓鱼了呢？ &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;老赵说到钓鱼，顿时我便有了主意。于是我借坡下驴，说：嗐，鱼竿好像不行了，这不钓了快俩小时，一个上钩的没有。说罢，我便盯着老赵的鱼竿。老赵似乎是明白了我的念头，他愣了一下，旋即把自己的鱼竿捞上来，说：老王，用我的吧，这竿子，也有你的一份力呢。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;也有我的一份力，老赵这一句，直接又把我给将住了。力气和水一样，泼出去就收不回来了。但为了那一千块，为了生活，我不能认输。大不了就是跟他撕破脸皮呗。于是我一咬牙，一狠心，旋即笑着说：看来老赵还记得呀，我还以为你忘了呢。这个竿子花了多少钱呢？我记得是一千两百块吧？ &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;我把话说到这里，小刘已经把头扭了过去，仿佛我在说一些肮脏至极的话语。其实话说到这儿，我也觉得有些太吝啬了，可是话和水也是同样的道理，说出去就收不住了。老赵此时冷笑一声，讲：我说老王今天怎么这么勤快，看来有事在心中呀。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;这一招太狠，主动出击，直接把我的路给堵死了，而且还把我塑造成了一个贪财忘义的小人形象。我脸庞发红，连带着手里的鱼竿也抖动起来。想了半天，我说：老赵，对不起，这几天我家里也比较困难，一千块也是钱呀，你说是不？没想到老赵一听这，打起了迷糊眼。他说：一千块？我赵忠平欠钱绝对不会不还，但是这一千块也该有理有据吧？我听到这里，着急站起，也不顾什么形象和正义了，讲：当然有，那天不是你买鱼竿，没有带够钱，我借给你一千块？这事儿小刘也知道，他也帮你凑了点。老赵听完，假装思索，然后哈哈大笑，讲：你说那天的事儿啊。那我问问小刘：小刘，我欠你钱不？小刘正坐板凳上打着游戏，他抬起头，嘿嘿笑，说：当然没有，还有我记得王哥说的是掏，掏钱怎么能叫借？王哥，掏了的钱再要，有点不够意思吧？ &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;掏。我的脑袋一懵：什么是掏？掏就是拿的意思，放到语句里面就是还差多少钱，我帮你拿了！小刘的话让我哑口难辩，此时老赵乘胜追击，&amp;ldquo;腾&amp;rdquo;的站起，招呼小刘说：咱走吧，这湖太大，鱼龙混杂，咱可别钓出事儿来了！ &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;老赵说完，二人勾肩搭背地走了。我愣愣地看着他俩背影，感觉鼻子冒酸，头颅发胀，有话想对着背影发出，可终究还是没说出口。风又刮了起来，没有鱼儿上钩，可是钓竿的右手却颤抖不停，我用左手死死攥住右臂，让它不至于颤抖。慢慢地，人渐渐散去，湖面变得平静，我的思绪也变得平静，可想的事还是跟那一千块脱不了干系：都说欠钱的是大爷，这种无形之中就把钱给钓走的，顺带给借钱的泼了盆冷水的，在我看来更是大爷中的大爷。我操起鱼竿，对着空中狠命一甩，绳线晃荡，颤颤悠悠落入湖中。我闭上眼睛，想象自己在一望无际的太平洋上垂钓，海中到处都是沙丁、金枪、比目鱼。微风吹拂我的脸颊，如果真的是这样，我便不会再在乎那一千块：因为一条金枪鱼的价格就能抵得过那一千块，甚至抵得过老赵那把鱼竿。想来想去，让我愁心的最大问题还是金钱。我又想起来一句搞笑语录：这世界上一大半的问题都可以用金钱来解决，剩下一小半的问题，则可以用金钱来缓解。如今我再琢磨着这句搞笑语录，心里却渗出了丝丝难过。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;微风渐凉，夜空骤起，口袋中的手机震动，妻子发来信息，让我赶快回家，该去医院了。回去吃完小米饭腌咸菜后，我还要与她一块前往医院照看老丈人。寒风中骑电动三公里，只为省那二十块的打车费；肺癌化疗五千一次，一共得六个疗程，做完之后存款也所剩无几；房贷两千一月，妻子休假在家，全靠我的工资忙活。可是如今我与老赵交恶，在这个公司的日子想必也不会好过。这么想着，我将脸映入漆黑的湖水上：鱼儿啊鱼儿，你们多么安详自在。如果有来生，我愿做一条鱼，呼吸、游动、等待捕捞，可惜的是，今生我是个人，一个老实懦弱的普通人。我叹口气，明儿去买瓶好酒吧，找个像样的饭店，就老赵那派头，估计还得去岳阳楼，请他吃一顿，道个歉，让他大人不记小人过，以后在公司还得多照顾。这么想着，我撑起沉重的身躯，长舒了一口闷气。就在此时，鱼竿抖动了一下，似是有鱼上钩。但我看也没看，捞起鱼竿，快步向家走去。 &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;
