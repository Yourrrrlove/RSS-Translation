data-source=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://image.wufazhuce.com/FlHz3FGj662ejPSf53IGSxO0cU_1&quot;>;&lt;/div>; &lt;div>;&lt;div style=&quot;font-size:26px;line-height: 1;&quot;>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;On this night, time and memories overlap, and everyone will move towards their own unknown future. destiny. &lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I admit, I don’t understand women. I am twenty-three years old and have never been in love. So far, I am still a virgin. Most of my knowledge about women comes from my junior high school classmate. Her first name is Yu Wenjie and her nickname is Jie Zi. We were not at the same desk in elementary school, but we studied in the same class. She is also my neighboring village. I am in Fucun, and she is in Lucun. The three villages of Fulu and Shou have the same ancestry and have produced both good men and women. Not only Mr. Kong knows this, but everyone around him says so. She has very black hair, very long legs, and a pair of high-hanging red phoenix eyes. Her first menstruation was in the summer of the second year of junior high school. She stood up from her seat and her pants were red. I lent her my school uniform jacket to tie around my waist. When it was returned to me the next day, it had been washed, neatly folded, and put in a plastic bag, as if it were new. From then on, she would prepare in advance every few days, put the sanitary napkin in the book, and take it to the toilet to change. Sometimes she would have abdominal pain. When she felt really uncomfortable, she would lie on the table and ask me to beat her waist twice. The above is my most secret understanding of the female gender. Beyond that, I had some unformed opinions about them, not from themselves, but from other men. For example, my college roommates, such as Li Zhifei at the front desk, Huang Pu and Gan Gouyu, and my partner Shan Guangzong. They both like to talk about women, but with different emphasis. My roommates mainly discuss the girls in the school, which department has good-looking girls, which girl has a good family background, which girl’s parents are civil servants and can get a job after graduation; Li Zhifei at the front desk likes to show details, and I learned from his mouth I learned what the missionary position was and that they could be fucked three times a night. Li Zhifei&#39;s girlfriend is a clerk at the 711 supermarket at the foot of the mountain. She is five years older than him. I heard that they have been quarreling recently, discussing whether to get married or break up. Huang Pu and Gan Gouyu do not talk specifically about women, but only drink too much. We occasionally chatted a few words when we were together, and what impressed me most was the phrase they often said: Women, I really can’t get used to them. Shan Guangzong&#39;s talk about women is different from them. He likes to research, so he always makes new discoveries. For example, he recently discovered that women cannot be &quot;pursued&quot; but need to be &quot;fixed&quot;, and before getting a woman, he must first learn to classify women. Shan Guangzong said that if he wants to classify women, he needs to know more about them, so his Douyin account not only follows famous cars and watches, but also follows many beautiful anchors, plus a lot of emotional accounts. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Women are divided into four categories: only for fun, suitable for love, suitable for marriage and stay away from her. It was three o&#39;clock in the morning when I said this. Shan Guangzong and I were lying side by side in the cypress forest behind the club, extremely drunk. The cypress forest is behind the parking lot. It is a large and dense area. There is an open space in the middle of the forest, connected to a rock cliff that sticks out. It is very strong and quite secluded. Sitting on it, you can overlook the entire city. On Monday or Tuesday nights, the guests disperse the earliest, around 11:30, and we often make appointments to meet at Shiya. Shan Guangzong was carrying the good wine that came along, as well as the side dishes that the guests had not touched much, such as chicken feet, peanuts, braised beef and drunken crab legs. I pointed out to him the back entrance of the school not far away. Counting from front to back, the yellow building in the second-to-last row was my dormitory. There is also a night market at the foot of the mountain. When it is busy, students come out of the back door to find a place to drink, or go to the e-sports hotel next to the street to play all-night games. Shan Guangzong also showed me the place where he first worked, only in the general direction. That place has long since been demolished, and many high-rise buildings have been built. The tallest building is also nearby, wrapped in a circle of neon, like a shining ham sausage. Mr. Shan Guangzong said he would take a look at the top of the tallest building when he had time. I agreed to accompany him, maybe because I was afraid that the security would not let us go up, but it has not happened yet. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I found that Shan Guangzong only likes to talk about certain things and not to act. For example, several times I asked him to have dinner in the cafeteria of our school, and he always readily agreed, but never went. We also agreed to visit each other’s homes during the Spring Festival. These words were spoken while lying on the rock cliff. After drinking, we always talked about our hometown unconsciously. Shan Guangzong&#39;s village is far away from the city and nestled in a mountain valley. It takes four bus rides to get into the city. I&#39;m a little better than him, I&#39;m just on the outskirts of the city, just two trips. Shan Guangzong said that they have many villages and mountains but little land, and they are all small, like patches. This is different from me. Our village is located on a plain, with a lot of land, one after another, like sheets. But we grow the same things, wheat, corn, cotton, and rice. Shan Guangzong didn&#39;t like farming, and neither did I. Shan Guangzong said that he didn&#39;t want to go home now. He couldn&#39;t stand the dry toilet and would vomit when he went in. I said that I didn&#39;t want to go home either. I couldn&#39;t sleep because there was a rooster crowing all the time in the middle of the night. We talked about the homes we could not go back to, and how we could have our own home here. As we were talking, we stopped and looked at the sparse vehicles on the road, strung together in front of the red light. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;After more drinks we started talking about women. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Mr. Shan Guangzong talked about Han Xiaoxue. Han Xiaoxue likes potato chips, Han Xiaoxue changed her hairstyle, Han Xiaoxue entered Gan Gouyu&#39;s office, and Han Xiaoxue was criticized... Shan Guangzong had to talk about everything about Han Xiaoxue, and it would affect her blood type and constellation family The background is clear. Han Xiaoxue is also from the countryside, but her Mandarin is very good and she looks more fashionable than us. Han Xiaoxue went to college and graduated several years ago. Although she is a junior college, her major sounds good, import and export trade. Shan Guangzong said that Han Xiaoxue should not come here. She has too much temper and cannot work in the service industry. I said that I did it, and the performance was good. Recently, Han Xiaoxue has been in and out of Gan Gou Yu&#39;s office frequently. Shan Guangzong asks me every two days: Yu Yang, do you think Han Xiaoxue is having sex with Gan Gou Yu? Shan Guangzong also asked me this question when he was lying on the stone cliff. I asked him back with the help of wine, if Han Xiaoxue doesn&#39;t follow Gan Gou Yu Gan, how can he do it with you? Shan Guangzong stopped talking and opened a can of beer with a &quot;pop&quot; sound, small bubbles sizzling at the mouth of the can. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Han Xiaoxue is not that kind of person, Shan Guangzong said. He also said that he always sees people very accurately. Then what kind of person is Han Xiaoxue? I asked. Shan Guangzong took a long puff of cigarette and tried to spit it out, but was blown back by the wind, making him unable to open his eyes. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Fuck, Shan Guangzong said, stop talking about her, talk about you, what kind of woman do you want to find? &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I have moved down from the stone cliff and lie under a cypress tree. The branches of the cypress trees are thin and dense, layered one on top of another, as soft as gauze. The gauze is black gauze, and the sky behind the gauze is also black. There are a few stars in the gap between black and black. They are not big and not bright, but they are shining. When I opened my eyes, I saw these stars, and when I closed my eyes, I thought of her. There are also wheat fields. The wheat fields spread out in my mind like a picture, one after another. The wheat fields are connected to my village, and my village is connected to her village. In the morning, I wore my school uniform and rode out from home, crossing the rows of green rice fields on both sides of the road. She was waiting for me on the other side of the green rice fields, her eyes were raised high, her pupils were dark and large, and the morning mist shrouded her body, glowing slightly. The wheat is green and yellow. When the wheat is harvested, corn and sorghum are planted. The corn and sorghum have also grown taller, and she is still waiting for me on the other side of the field, with still such beautiful eyes and such good skylight. We rode bicycles side by side along the crop fields, first riding seven or eight miles of dirt roads, and then turned onto the asphalt road. The road is connected to the school. There are two buildings side by side in the school. The sun rises high from behind the buildings, and the playground is shining with golden light. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Maybe I should have had a relationship earlier, such as when I was sixteen, with my deskmate. My deskmate’s nickname is Yu Wenjie and his nickname is Jiezi. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Now Jiezi is married and the mother of two children; but I am still a virgin and have not learned how to classify women. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Their appetite is getting better. The Longjing shrimps and beef tenderloin that were served first were barely touched with chopsticks, and most of the steamed mandarin fish was eaten as soon as they were served. I didn’t eat the crab at first, but now I asked to take it out and heat it up. The kitchen moved very quickly, and Shan Guangzong brought out the steaming crabs in just two cigarettes. They stopped drinking and split up to eat crab. Huang Pu broke off a crab leg and bit it. He put his head in front of Mr. Kong and talked about the project. I poured a circle of tea and finally understood the general idea: there is a key figure here, Huang Pu calls him the boss. The boss can influence Huangpu&#39;s projects, but Huangpu can&#39;t handle the boss, and the boss is close to Mr. Kong, so Huangpu invited Mr. Kong to get information from him or ask him to make peace. Huang Pu said, did the boss misunderstand me? Mr. Kong didn’t speak, just smiled. Huang Pu added, &quot;Didn&#39;t the boss tell you everything?&quot; Mr. Kong didn’t speak yet, but still smiled. I don’t know why, but when I look at Mr. Kong’s smile, I think of Shan Guangzong’s appearance: he looks at me sideways, making me look like a country bumpkin. Now Huang Pu&#39;s face was red, he didn&#39;t know whether he was drunk or anxious. Is it because the money is not in place? This sentence was whispered, and I read it from the shape of his mouth. Huang Pu started chattering again, but I was too far away to hear him clearly. I only saw him clasping his hands together, shrugging his shoulders and spreading his hands. Mr. Kong patted him on the shoulder twice and asked him to eat the crab while it was hot. After talking again, he picked out a piece from the remaining mandarin fish and looked at Mr. Kong’s face while eating it. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Mr. Kong drank tea with a smile and stared at the girl again. She was eating crabs attentively, holding the crab lid in her left hand and a small spoon in her right hand, digging the crab roe into her mouth bit by bit. Her fingers are thin and long, with a little pink on the fingertips, which further shows the whiteness of her skin. His head was slightly lowered, and there were two hints of red on his cheekbones due to drinking. Huang Pu said, Brother Kong, you don’t know yet, An Qi majored in bel canto. Mr. Kong had a surprised expression on his face, as if he had heard some good news, and the good news fell on the girl, so he needed to look her up and down. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Huang Pu said, why not ask An Qi to sing a song to add splendor to this good night. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The girl had finished eating the crab and was wiping her hands with a hot towel. After hearing this, she threw the towel on the table and rolled her eyes at Huang Pu. Huang Pu gestured towards the screen with his hand, meaning to ask her to stand over and sing. The girl lowered her eyelids, as if thinking about something, and soon glanced at Huang Pu again. Huang Pu just laughed. Come on, he said, don’t be shy if you have talent, be generous and share it with us. The girl also smiled and said yes, great. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The two men were the first to applaud, and Shan Guangzong also followed. The girl said that I would sing &quot;Happy Flowers and Full Moon&quot;, and both Mr. Kong and Huang Pu agreed. The girl stood up, walked to the screen, with her left foot facing forward and her right foot facing out. She stood still, clasped her hands, and sang: The clouds disperse and the bright moon shines on us. As the girl sang, Mr. Kong beat time with his hands on the table. Huang Pu came over to discuss how to open another bottle of red wine. Mr. Kong tilted his head, but still refused to take his eyes away from the girl. Mr. Kong said no need, just drink more. Huang Pu said how could it be possible? You have a lot of energy. Besides, it doesn’t matter if you drink too much. We have already booked the Dingjian Hotel on the top of the mountain. Mr. Kong finally looked at him and said with a smile, you are such a brat. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Huang Pu asked Shan Guangzong to open the wine, and I started to clear away the crab shells on the table. When the song ended, the two men applauded again, the red wine was poured, and the dishes and glasses were replaced with new ones. They cheered up and toasted again, as if they were starting a new round. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Mr. Kong was clearly interested. He moved his butt forward towards his seat and put his hands on the table, like a leader preparing to speak to the camera. Mr. Kong first praised Huang Pu, saying that if he had known that they were so close, they would have gotten together more often. When Mr. Kong mentioned this, Huang Pu quickly picked up the conversation and said, &quot;Thanks to Brother Kong for not giving up, he is willing to be backward compatible.&quot; After Mr. Kong praised Huang Pu, he praised the girl again, saying that the song was suitable for the occasion and made people feel emotional. He also praised her eyes for their classical beauty and asked if she had moved the corners of her eyes. The girl shook her head. Mr. Kong said, An Qi, remember, don’t touch your face, natural beauty is the best. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;After another clinking of glasses, Mr. Kong said he wanted to pay homage to An Qi alone because she reminded him of his first girlfriend. Mr. Kong said I did it, you can do whatever you want, but Huang Pu was unwilling, saying that this fate was hard-won and should not be taken lightly. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Just do it, the girl said, feeling bored. After the girl finished, she turned the empty cup over and showed it to Huang Pu, as if to demonstrate. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Huang Pu said, An Qi, I also respect you, firstly, to thank you for your appearance, and secondly, to thank you for your singing voice, so I respect you both, and you return one to me, which represents our three lives together. Fortunately. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Her hand holding the cup was trembling slightly. In just a short period of time, she drank four glasses of red wine in a row. The wine burned her eyes red and ignited her enthusiasm. She even insisted on replying to them both regardless of the obstruction. I couldn&#39;t tell whether her happiness was fake or whether she was really enjoying it. Anyway, I couldn&#39;t tell the difference even when she was drunk. I grasped the balance in my hands and tried to give her as little as possible, but she kept urging me to move faster. Just like this, she drank two more glasses, finishing each one. She drank until her eyes blurred and her body began to shake. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;After she walked crookedly to the bathroom, the two men put their heads together again. This time it was Mr. Kong who started first. He stretched out an arm to hold the back of Huang Pu&#39;s chair and put his mouth close to his ear to speak. His voice was very low and he could not hear anything clearly. He covered his mouth with his hand and could not see anything. Not sure. As Mr. Kong talked, a smile appeared on Huang Pu&#39;s face, and the corners of his mouth pulled back further and further. After Mr. Kong finished speaking, Huang Pu slapped his thigh and said that&#39;s enough. With Brother Kong&#39;s help, I have nothing to say, my heart is all in the wine. Huang Pu asked me to pour three glasses of wine, but Mr. Kong tried to stop me. Huang Pu refused to say anything and drank all three glasses of wine in one go. Mr. Kong said, Xiao Huang, who among us is following whom? You are sincere and I know it in my heart. Huang Pu said, brother, my good brother, I will prepare wine next week, and we will invite the boss to the top of the mountain to drink. Mr. Kong waved his hand and said that I will make arrangements next month and you can call a few more friends. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The girl came out of the bathroom. She washed her face and put on lipstick. Maybe she was drunk, and her eye circles were very red. Mr. Kong said, An Qi, you are coming next week, and I will bring you good hawthorn fruit wine. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;She said her name was An Qi, but I bet that’s not true. She also said that she was from Shoucun, which was definitely a lie. As an authentic Fucun person, I can say this responsibly: among the three villages of Fu, Lu and Shou, there is not a single name like that. The girls in Fu Lu Shou are named Nana, Ping Ping, Shuang Shuang, and Di Di, but there is no An Qi. Among the girls of Fu, Lu and Shou, there is also someone named Jie Zi, the one with red and phoenix eyes. I don’t know why, but I thought of Jiezi frequently tonight, of her high-hanging eyes and dark pupils, of her standing under the dark clouds in her school uniform and skirt, on the edge of the endless cornfield, biting Have tight lips. After I entered high school, I rarely thought of Jie Zi. Every time I went to town and passed her village, I would always speed up as hard as I could without raising my head. But I know that one day, everything about Jiezi will emerge in my mind from beginning to end. I can’t hold it down or grasp it, just like the sand and gravel will always be exposed when the tide recedes. I I could only watch, but couldn&#39;t do anything. Same as now. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Jiezi is from Lucun, his parents are farmers, and they have no other livelihood except farming. Jie Zi&#39;s brother is a fool with albinism. He always hangs around the village. Passers-by are scared when they see him and walk around him. The villagers didn&#39;t pay much attention to Jiezi, so Jiezi didn&#39;t talk to the villagers. The news of Jie Zi&#39;s situation reached the school, and few people in the school paid much attention to Jie Zi. After class, the girls gathered together to say bad things about her: She had such high eyes and high braids, so she was pretending to be a princess. Throughout elementary school, Jiezi spent his time being excluded. But she didn&#39;t care much. She played a skipping game during class, and regardless of the supercilious looks from her classmates, she pushed her way to the front to jump. Jiezi has had long legs and a flexible body since he was a child. He can jump half a meter above the ground, as if he is flying. By the second day of junior high school, Jie Zi had grown to 1.65 meters tall, which made him taller among the girls in the class. He also had a longer face, big eyes, white skin, and a small bulge in his chest that attracted people to look at. There were more and more people chasing her, from every grade. After class, they leaned at the door of our class and called me out to help deliver love letters. At that time, I already knew the importance of studying. I was annoyed by them and even looked at Jie Zi with displeasure. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Once, Feng, a street kid who dropped out of school, stopped me on the way to school and asked about Jiezi’s daily life. Feng, a street kid, was a bully in school. He got into fights and even used a knife. My legs were shaking when he stopped me, thinking he was trying to steal money. I actually had twenty yuan in my pocket at the time, which I had saved from half a year&#39;s food expenses, and wanted to buy myself a pair of sneakers. As a result, Jie Liuzi Feng just asked me some simple information: does Jiezi have a boyfriend, where is his home, what color does he like, and what does he like to eat. I answered everything truthfully. Feng, a street runner, asked me what my relationship was with her. I said it didn&#39;t matter, it was just that our villages were next to each other and we often walked together after school. Street boy Feng said, you are not allowed to come together with her in the future, and if you let me see her again, take off your arm. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Since then, I have really become estranged from Jie Zi. I would ride my bicycle to school before dawn in the morning so that she could not wait for anyone; in the evening after school, I would pedal my bicycle very fast so that she could not catch up with me. She passed a note asking me why I was like this, but I didn&#39;t reply. I tore up the note in front of her and threw it in the trash can. It will be my third year of junior high school soon. I study day and night and just want to get into a key high school. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In the second half of the third semester of junior high school, the wave of dropouts began. Most of the girls in the town stopped studying. Some went to the county to sell tea, and some worked odd jobs in the clothing city. They could go far. , go directly to the city, work as a waiter or do some unspeakable things. Jie Zi also dropped out of school and soon got engaged to Feng, a street kid. I heard that he got a lot of gifts and the engagement party was a lively one. Street Liu Zifeng&#39;s parents own a furniture factory and are wealthy households in the town. The family owns a car and a pickup truck, as well as two Tibetan mastiffs and a wolfdog. Jie Zi’s parents are quite satisfied, but I don’t know if Jie Zi is satisfied. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Jie Zi suddenly dropped out of school, and we hadn’t spoken to each other for several months before dropping out. I haven&#39;t seen Jiezi in the three years of high school. I didn&#39;t go to the town when there was a fair, for fear of running into her, or Feng, the streetwalker. Should I stay away or go up and talk? &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The year I was admitted to college, there were ten banquets at my house. Villagers from all over the country came to drink and praised me for my great achievements. Jiezi&#39;s father also came, wearing a brand-new jacket, saying that his daughter bought it for more than 500 yuan. When the villagers talked about it, they all envied Jiezi&#39;s father. On the first day of school, my dad used a bicycle to push my luggage to see me off. While waiting for the bus on the side of the road, I suddenly saw her, Jie Zi, my junior high school classmate. She was standing at the door of a supermarket opposite, wearing a round-neck maternity skirt with a big belly, and holding a red plastic bag with half a watermelon in it. She has gained a lot of weight, her face is rounder, her eyes are not as high as before, and her pupils are not as dark and big as I remembered. There were gold ornaments on her neck and ears, which hung heavily. Her whole body looked heavy. The moment she looked at me, my heart started churning uncontrollably. I wanted to walk over and say a few words to her, but as soon as I took my step, she turned around and walked into the supermarket while holding her waist. Went to the barber shop. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;While taking out the trash in the food delivery room, Shan Guangzong asked me if I had fallen in love with that girl. I said no. Shan Guangzong said that without you, he would always look at her secretly. I stacked the removed plates one by one without raising my head, saying that there was none. There is no best, Shan Guangzong said, that kind of girl is &quot;just for fun.&quot; Shan Guangzong was right, I didn&#39;t mean classification, but I was indeed looking at her secretly. But I&#39;m quite reluctant to call this behavior a liking. To be precise, she aroused a strange emotion in my heart. This strangeness is reflected in the fact that I dislike her arrogance, vanity and pretentiousness, but at the same time I can&#39;t help but pay attention to her every move. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;After coming back from the lobby, she not only became cooperative in drinking, but also showed a strong sense of service. She poured wine for Mr. Kong and tea for Huang Pu. Between the two men Drilling around and laughing. I found that she is a veteran at the wine table. As long as she wants to, she can tell several authentic jokes in a row to persuade people to drink. Waiter, waiter, she ordered us loudly, her brows hanging upside down. Waiter, open another bottle of wine, she said. Waiter, change the cup, she said again. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The atmosphere at the wine table is now quite harmonious. If it gets too harmonious, it becomes sticky. Mr. Kong untied the collar of his shirt, revealing his Adam&#39;s apple the size of a walnut. He also untied his cuffs and rolled them up in two sections. Huang Pu gasped for breath and sank into his chair, giggling non-stop. The two men chatted about stocks for a while, and she sat aside and listened, half-joking from time to time, saying that she wanted to learn or become a disciple. After going to the toilet, Huang Pu leaned on the long sofa in the lounge in the name of replying to the message. Mr. Kong took off his glasses, held the back of the girl&#39;s chair with one hand, put the other hand on the table, and played an arm-wrestling game with her. She tried to break him off with both hands. After losing several times, she still tried to break him off. Huang Pu fell asleep quickly (at least it seemed that way), snoring louder and louder, as if he wasn&#39;t ready to wake up tonight. I counted and the three of them drank one bottle of white wine and two and a half bottles of red wine. Huang Pu got drunk a little quickly tonight. I once saw him drink a whole bottle of high-strength liquor and still walk smoothly. He thought clearly when answering the phone and didn&#39;t eat a word. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;She must have been fucked by many people - as long as there is a girl who is drunk at the drinking party, with blurred eyes, someone talks to her ear or touches her thigh; as long as she still laughs loudly , socializing as usual, Shan Guangzong always said this in my ear. The voice was small, but the tone was fierce. After finishing speaking, he let out a long breath, like a person who had been thirsty for a long time in the desert and finally took his first sip of ice-cold soda. But this time, I thought of these words earlier than him, just after she was pulled by Kong and sat on his lap. The thought popped into my mind fiercely - she must have been fucked by many people, maybe a long time ago, maybe in many places, in hotel suites or luxury cars, even in the bathroom of a restaurant or in the wild woods. . Once something like this happens, it can never be erased. Even if her name and address are changed, sooner or later her misdeeds will spread among acquaintances. Guys like to spread it, they like to see a girl&#39;s reputation ruined and then hold her hand behind her back and say what a shame, I know you&#39;re not like that. Serious boys will not fall in love with her. They think the same as Shan Guangzong: this kind of girl is &quot;just for fun.&quot; I can&#39;t be excluded either. For example, the only thought that flashes through my mind now: She must have been fucked by many people, no matter what the reason was. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Now she struggled to stand up from his lap. The man named Kong was pulling her from behind (maybe he was helping her, I couldn’t tell). She shook off his hand and walked towards the bathroom, leaning Askew, unable to form a straight line. She almost banged her head through the door. The man surnamed Kong followed closely, and the door was slammed shut with a muffled sound. The sound was like a chef chopping half a fan of pork onto the chopping board. Shan Guangzong and I hid in the food delivery room with our ears pressed against the door. There was no additional sound other than vomiting and flushing. Huang Pu&#39;s snoring came occasionally, muffled and muffled, like a low-quality speaker with a broken channel. After a while, I heard her scream, followed by laughter, loud and sharp, mixed with curses. The person named Kong seemed to be saying something, but it was quickly covered up by her laughter. Let me explain here why I changed my name to the person named Kong: From the time he took off his glasses, Mr. Kong no longer looked like Mr. Kong. Following my heart, I called him the person named Kong. &amp;nbsp;The two of them stayed in the bathroom for a while before they came out. Her lipstick had been wiped off, and Kong held her arm, both of them swaying. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;She must have been fucked by many people, Shan Guangzong whispered--he finally said those words. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Everyone in the town said that Jiezi slept with Jieliuzi Feng before they got engaged. People in the town also said that Jiezi not only slept with Jieliuzi Feng Sleep, sleep with me, after all, we get into the cornfield together every day. This word spread the most during the wave of students dropping out. Someone came to inquire about it. I had a fight with him and got a good punch and was covered in dirt. It was all because of dropping out of school, I thought bitterly at the time. Jie Zi shouldn&#39;t drop out of school, she is obviously doing well in her studies. We always tied for first place in elementary school exams, with scores of 100 in both Chinese and math. In junior high school, I ranked in the top five in the class, and Jiezi ranked around fifteen, not much behind me. If things develop smoothly, even if Jiezi fails to pass the undergraduate examination, he will definitely be able to go to a junior college. If Jiezi went to college, where would she be now? Either study in the school library, work a part-time job in the supermarket, or, like me, go to a KTV or a club and earn more money to buy yourself two luxury gadgets, a motorcycle or an iPhone. Or maybe she changed her name to something like Angelina Anne, put on makeup and sat under a gorgeous and dazzling crystal lamp, sitting among a dazzling array of food and wine. Shan Guangzong is right, a girl like her can only play for fun. And there is another hidden meaning behind this sentence: Girls like her will not fall in love with us. I hate her even more because she won&#39;t fall in love with me. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;There was a time when I also disliked Jie Zi. I despised her bulging breasts and slender waist. I despised the dark and bright pupils in her high-raised eyes, as if they contained a pool of spring water. And she seemed to deliberately offer the treasure, always using it to look around and arouse people&#39;s imagination. Otherwise, why would Feng, the street liar, have his eye on her? What I hated the most was that gloomy evening. She neither asked me to stay nor said no to Feng, the street kid. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;That evening, the clouds were thick and the rain stopped in mid-air, refusing to fall. We almost went out of the school at the same time. She rode quickly, and Feng also rode quickly. I followed them behind them, listening to them all the way, talking and laughing, and quickly turned off the road. The street slippery Feng dragged her handle, shaking it for a while, and she smiled and screamed. After turning around, three of us were left. Rows of corn and sorghum stood in rows, sticking to the fainted sky. I tightly gates, slipped past them, and rode less than ten meters. I asked back and asked. Fengzi Feng said, who do you talk to? I said, two with you. Feng Zi, Feng, said, walking with you, less fucking nonsense. I glanced at Jiezi, she grabbed the handlebats with both hands and supported the ground, as if she had to jump at any time. I said, do you go? She bit her lips and looked at me straight. Her pupils were really dark, darker than ink, and deeper than well. She didn&#39;t speak in the end. I rode on the car and didn&#39;t go back. I was afraid that I saw the eyes when I turned around. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;br>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; I think I should talk about a love. A real love. Speaking of fun, I am 23 years old, but I don&#39;t know the taste of a woman. But I think that I know what real love is. In other words, I was sure that love was not a simple missionary position. She took her three times or tried her to drunk in the club three times a night. At the age of sixteen, in the evening before the storm, on the gray -green and boundless corn ground, love once climbed up my shoulder, like a hemp pocket, which was filled with corn. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; If you really want to fall in love, I better leave this place. But I need to save money to buy a 310R. I can&#39;t talk about a real love because of a motorcycle, which sounds ridiculous, but the ridiculous person is more than one. For example, Shan Guangzong said that each woman in the Mid -Mountains is not worth a look, and at the same time, he believes that the real life is a yacht and bikini queue. Occasionally, there were a few gentle nights. He was lying on the Shi Ya. He was worried that Han Xiaoxue&#39;s white fingers were stained by the mud of the back kitchen. These things appeared on him at the same time, and mutual questions and answers. When I mentioned them one by one, confused on his face: Fuck, he said, fuck you. He always scolded after drinking. He said, fucking them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; She cried while drinking sober soup. It was always laughing. The surname Kong came out and sat in the soft sofa in the lounge. She covered her chest and said it was a little disgusting. The surname Kong had been pinching her shoulders, and asked for a few times. She reached out to push her hand without any strength, and was caught by him. Don&#39;t make trouble, she still said with a smile. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Shan Guangzong brings up the sober soup, a total of three bowls, all on the coffee table. A bowl of surname Kong was lifted to her mouth. She picked it up and drank two. Is it better? The surname Kong asked again. She nodded, but her eyes looked at Huangpu. Huangpu was still asleep, one arm folded, covering his eyes, and the other one hanging down, almost touching the ground. Shan Guangzong walked over and put Huangpu&#39;s arm into the sofa, and I saw his eyes staring at the Rolex. The surname Kong also lifted a bowl of sober soup to drink, while drinking and asked us about staying. Shan Guangzong said that he could drive on his behalf and help him drive the car to Dingjian Hotel on the top of the mountain. The surname Kong nodded, walked to the hanger and picked up the trench coat and the girl&#39;s bag. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; You follow me, he handed the bag to her. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; She picked up with one hand, put it on her knees, and reached out the two Huangpu two, without response. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; You go with me, and the last name is Kong. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; She looked at him and looked at the Huangpu again. By the way, Yu Guang wiped me and Shan Guangzong. Her other hand was holding the bowl of sober soup, and took a sip of her head. At this time, I saw tears hanging on her eyelashes, shaking, and falling into the bowl. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The surname Kong went to the dining table to find the falling things. The mobile phone was put into the pocket, and the glasses were worn, and they turned back to the general appearance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Let&#39;s go, President Kong said, with a consistent smile on his face. Don&#39;t worry about him &amp; mdash; &amp; mdash; he used his chin to order the yellow garden, and then ordered us &amp; mdash; &amp; mdash; someone would control him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; She suddenly cried at this moment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Kong&#39;s smile was stuck, stiff on his face. What&#39;s wrong? he asks. She didn&#39;t answer, Kong always walked over, squatted down, reached out and patted her shoulder, and pushed her hard. Mr. Kong stood up, frowned, and the smile on his face disappeared. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Now she is crying even more, shaking her shoulders, and her voice is getting louder and louder. Her voice has been heard that everyone in the corridor can hear. Soon someone pushed the door to look at it, Wang Guanghui in the Greek hall, his best thing. But President Kong scolded him back. President Kong scolded people to be majestic, his voice was stout, and his momentum was like a rainbow. Get out, Mr. Kong said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; For a while, we didn&#39;t speak. There was only her crying in the room. What&#39;s up with her? President Kong put his sights on us, probably because he was too imposing just now, and neither Shan Guangzong and I dared to answer. President Kong did a shrugging action. I know what he wants to say: it has nothing to do with me. I really don&#39;t understand, what are you doing? President Kong said that he started organizing clothes, the cuffs were buckled, and the neckline was tied, just like the beginning of the dinner. Now that President Kong wears a trench coat and walks towards the door, the step is very big. It was strange, and no one forced you to come here. He said that he pushed the door and walked out, and never looked back at her. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Mr. Kong left, Shan Guangzong followed, and soon returned. Shan Guangzong said that Kong would not let him follow, but let Li Zhifei in the front desk lead the way to find a car in the backyard. As for where he is going to go, whether it is drunk driving, it has nothing to do with us. Anyway, people like him will not cause himself to be dangerous. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;br>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Now there are only three of us left in the room, Shan Guangzong, Wang Anqi and I. By the way, there are also drunk Huangpu, I already believe that he is really drunk. His snoring sounded, one arm fell down again, and the other was still on his eyes; his mouth was slightly open, his nose and chin were glowing. . The Rolex watch was stuck on the wrist, and the blue dial flashed with dazzling glory under the light. Shan Guangzong squatted down, didn&#39;t touch him in his hand, just put his face over, staring at the watch. I dragged him up. He leaned his lips, glanced at me, and glanced at the girl again. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; She had stopped crying, her eyes were swollen, but her eyes were sharp and looked at us up. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; What&#39;s wrong? I asked unconsciously, no head and tail. She didn&#39;t say anything, she received her eyes and got up and walked towards the bathroom. I found that she was walking so much, and her butt was not as twisted as before. After entering the bathroom, she didn&#39;t close the door. She quickly washed her face at a speed. When she came out, she carried the bag on her body, and then walked in front of Huangpu to push him hard. Huangpu pumped his mouth and still didn&#39;t wake up. She pulled his arm up and loosen again, and the arm fell from the air and hit the sofa along the sofa. Don&#39;t pretend, she said, her voice is quite loud. But Huangpu still didn&#39;t wake up, and the snoring sounded again. She returned to her and asked me if I could send her down the mountain. No, Shan Guangzong caught her, and his voice was a bit sharp. The ferry vehicle can&#39;t get up, Shan Guangzong said. She ignored it, and still looked at me and said, I know you. ah? I said. Damn, I don&#39;t know why I pretend to be stupid. She sneered and said, let&#39;s have seen it when I was in political class, and you always peeped at me at that time. Shan Guangzong smiled behind me, and I pounded him with his elbow. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; I didn&#39;t wait for me to distinguish something, she had squatted down and started to stun the watch of Huangpu. Huangpu&#39;s wrist was short and thick, and the watch was stuck on the wrist. She turned Huangpu&#39;s hand, put it on her leg, and broke the buckle a little bit. What are you doing? I said. But I stood still, I don&#39;t know if I should stop her as my status. Shan Guangzong&#39;s eyes were fast, and when she got up as soon as she got up, she jumped forward and grabbed the watch in her hand. What are you doing? I said another word. Still not moved, I was not sure whether his behavior was based on the order of maintaining order or simply grabbing. Give me back, the girl whispered, and I saw a fierce gaze that I never saw in her eyes. She stared at him, drank again, quickly. Shan Guangzong took the watch in his hand, provocative, and he took a lot. She stepped forward to grab, but he raised his hands over the top of his head. She grabbed it once and could no longer have a new action, but stopped, and hugged her chest like the two hands before. Give me back, she said, otherwise I will call, but now the table is in your hands. Her tone was quite calm, as if she was completely sober. Don&#39;t call it, don&#39;t call, I whispered, and at the same time refers to Huangpu. I think she and Shan Guangzong can understand what I mean, and Huangpu is not necessarily drunk. But no one of them looked at me. I rarely see the kind of smile floating on Shan Guangzong&#39;s face, not very friendly, but not very evil. Maybe he, like me, has a weird feeling for this girl. As if she was attracted to her, but was very resistant to this feeling. After stalemate for a while, Shan Guangzong returned the watch to her. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; She put the watch into the bag, quickly pulled the zipper, and asked how long it would take to go down the mountain. She asked this words towards Shan Guangzong. One hour, Shan Guangzong said. One hour is to take Panshan Highway, I added. Is there a close way? she asked again. Shan Guangzong raised his eyebrows to look at her, and some were that he said that as long as there is a path in the mountains, you are afraid that you dare not. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; His words have just fallen, and she has passed us and ran out of the house. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;br>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; I chased it out for a few seconds. He seemed to have no intention to chase at all. After the girl ran out, he slowly walked into the passing room. I heard the voice of the lighter coming from it, and then there was a scent of smoke. The grandson took the last one. Chinese smoke was smoked. I walked over and asked him what to do. He didn&#39;t answer, only handed the cigarettes, and let me smoke two. I pushed his hand away. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; There is no one over the corridor. The door of the Greek hall was open, and the group of people in a suit had gone most of them. Some of the remaining ones tied the tie on their heads, some were shirtless, and they were singing together. We are the masters of the world. &amp; rdquo; They sang very well, and they were a little running. I also heard the sound of high heels downstairs, and knocked on the steps. I ran down the stairs in three steps and did not see her back until chasing out of the hall. She was running to the door of the yard, and a Mercedes -Benz car drove there, and she pushed her two horn. She didn&#39;t stop, rushed straight, and the car stopped with a sudden brake. I heard someone scolded to find death. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; She didn&#39;t go back to the courtyard without returning to the door. When the car opened the door, I finally chased it out, and she was disappearing. She seemed to have disappeared out of thin air, leaving no trace in which direction. Hey &amp; mdash; &amp; mdash; I shouted. I don&#39;t know why I shouted, just like I don&#39;t know why I was chasing her, do I want to help Huangpu to recover his watch, or do I want to escort her back to the mountain safely? I stood on the mountain road four weeks, and the road down the mountain was already dark. The street lights leading to the top of the mountain were still on. Their laughter was blown by the wind in the night, and the trees and weeds rushed. The moon came out, and the mountains were hung on the top of the mountain, and the mountains in the mountains were mottled. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; She must have ran into the forest, and I think the thorns will cut her calf. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; I and Shan Guangzong returned to the dormitory very late that night. Shan Guangzong smoked in the passing vegetable room, caught by Han Xiaoxue, and was very happy to scold. I didn&#39;t tell him what happened next: I wanted to find the girl along the highway, but I accidentally saw the driving cars parked on the road to the road. Go into the backyard of the Mid -Mountains. I also saw that she stretched her head in the window before leaving, and kissed her face on her face. Later, when Shan Guangzong studied Han Xiaoxue and the problem of doing it, I always supported it. I thought something should be said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Later, Shan Guangzong did not study the problem of having Han Xiaoxue and doing it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Huangpu still comes to our club, but I have never asked the whereabouts of the table. Shan Guangzong said that the table was simply fake. People like them were always drunk, and they didn&#39;t dare to bring them on their bodies. When Shan Guangzong said this, he still looked at me obliquely, making me feel like a soil. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; About that girl, we are like quietly, and no one has mentioned it again. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Two months later, I finally met her once in school. She wore a white down jacket and passed me and didn&#39;t speak.
