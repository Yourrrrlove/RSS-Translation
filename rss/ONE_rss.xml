In the history of novels, studying medicine and writing have always been in conflict, but this is not the case for the author Shen Xia-sheng. She is in a hospital and is destined to witness many misfortunes in the world. She can always cover up the cold reality with warm words. In the face of misfortune, some people pretend to avoid it, while others face it sincerely. This article is a contrast in this situation. &lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;This year’s Mid-Autumn Festival and National Day came together to form an eight-day long holiday. During the early days of a long holiday, the hospital will always experience a small peak in hospitalizations, and the number of operations will increase to about double the usual number. Patients admitted to the surgical department have a set of procedures: asking for medical history, physical examination, issuing medical orders and examinations, assessing the condition, asking the superior physician for elective surgery, preoperative conversation, surgery, postoperative dressing change, and discharge. If the number of patients surges, the above process will need to be repeated more times. The process must not be less, and the speed of completing the process must be accelerated. The ward after the ward rounds is like a lively vegetable market, crowded with patients asking about beds, conditions or treatments. Talking too much with family members is a waste of energy. This was especially apparent to me before the holidays. Having been studying medicine for many years, I have no idea about holidays. I even get a big headache when I hear about holidays because it means being busier. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;As for holidays, it is almost impossible for the medical industry, because the wards will have doctors on duty every day, and each treatment group will also arrange people to do ward rounds in the morning during the holidays. Outpatient clinics are even more crowded during holidays, including New Year&#39;s Eve and New Year&#39;s Day. It seems that everyone has reached a consensus - take advantage of the holidays to see if your body, which is usually overloaded, is okay. No problem. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The pressure of modern society does not allow people to have physical problems, so they are forced to learn to choose their days when they are sick. If a patient undergoing non-emergency surgery goes to the hospital for treatment before a holiday, the holiday can naturally become a time for him to recuperate. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In recent days, the number of patients who come to the department to make appointments for hospitalization has increased significantly. As the person responsible for bed registration, I have to do dozens of rounds of Tai Chi with the patients every day. Patients are all anxious to move in for surgery. It is best to be discharged before the holidays, so as not to delay their return home for the holidays or delay their treatment. Unfortunately, medical resources are limited and cannot meet everyone&#39;s needs. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The most common reason why patients state that they urgently need to be hospitalized is that my home is far away and it is inconvenient to come and go. Although I can understand the hardship of patients traveling back and forth from home to the hospital, most of the patients admitted to the hospital are from out of town, and it is more fair to sort based on first come, first served rather than based on distance. In addition, patients usually say that they have just asked for leave. In view of the many things at work and at home, we must be more accommodating. Although I can understand that patients will consider all aspects before seeking medical treatment, these days almost everyone is entangled in trivial matters and cannot prioritize based on this. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;After being in contact with patients for a long time, we have to find our own set of words. The principle is that no matter what the patients say, we will always refuse in the end and let the registered patients go home and wait for notification by phone. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;On this morning, another patient registered for hospitalization came to the department. She was pushed in by her mother in a wheelchair. She was not very old, about twenty-five years old, and wore a comb. Ponytail, wearing a colorful coat, eyes looking dull. The outpatient examination sheet indicated that she was highly suspected of thyroid cancer. After registering her name, disease, and contact information, her mother began to engage in a tactical pull with me. The aunt first pointed at the patient and said that her daughter was disabled. As he said this, he took out the disability certificate from his pocket and wanted to show it to me. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Of course I cannot be easily persuaded. After all, there is a steady stream of patients coming to register for their own reasons. The number of beds is limited, so I must strictly abide by the rules. I answered her politely: &quot;I can understand your anxiety about being hospitalized, but if you look at the registration book, there are more than a dozen patients who came to register before you. I have to arrange them one by one.&quot; &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The aunt did not give up after hearing this. She continued to describe her daughter’s misfortune to me. She said that her daughter used to be a nurse at W County Hospital. One day three years ago, her daughter was waiting for the bus on the side of the road after get off work and was hit by a car that suddenly lost control. It took a long time to save her life, but due to the injury to her pelvis, her daughter could no longer walk normally after the operation. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The aunt lamented that she was really unlucky. She only had such a daughter, and it was not easy to train her to work. Who expected that this kind of thing would happen again. The words she spat out quickly were full of resentment, which made me feel a little depressed. I couldn&#39;t help but take a serious look at her. She was wearing an old-style brown coat. She was thin and had permed curly hair. A mess on the head. Perhaps due to long-term frowning, the corners of her eyes tilted downwards on both sides, and there were several obvious vertical lines between her eyebrows. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;When I heard that the patient had been a colleague, and that what he had suffered was indeed an unreasonable disaster, and that people are not like trees and grass, I did not continue to reject people thousands of miles away as usual. My aunt noticed that I was trying to relent, and immediately changed the disability The witness unfolded and placed it in front of me: &quot;Look, my daughter is really disabled!&quot; Her legs and feet are inconvenient, so I have to take care of her alone. I am old and pushing her back and forth is a lot of work! &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The aunt looked at me, then at her daughter, and kept sighing. Seeing this, I decided to make an exception and call the director for instructions. I told the director that a patient with lower body paralysis due to a car accident had come to the ward and asked if a bed could be arranged for her in advance. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;After listening to my description, the director immediately searched for the relevant image of the patient in his mind. The director said on the other end of the phone that he knew the patient&#39;s general condition and allowed me to provide her with appropriate conveniences. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Unfortunately, the full beds in the ward have just been arranged, leaving only extra beds. An extra bed is a simple folding bed placed in a corner of the ward for transition during bed turnover. Unexpectedly, when my aunt heard that it was an extra bed, she immediately shook her head and said no. She pushed her daughter in the wheelchair towards me and said, &quot;Look, how can she sleep in an extra bed in this condition?&quot; ! &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Auntie, there is really no full bed today. The extra bed is arranged for you in advance. I can’t pull the patient sleeping in the full bed and put your daughter in it. Bar? Besides, I have nothing to do today. When the bed becomes available tomorrow, I will give it to you first. If you find it inconvenient to stay in an extra bed, you can write a leave request at the nurse&#39;s station after completing the formalities, take your daughter to a hotel outside for one night, and remember to come for the blood draw tomorrow morning. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Staying in a hotel? Wouldn&#39;t that cost more? Okay, just add an extra bed. &amp;rdquo;Auntie made a decision quickly. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;When the aunt pushed the patient out of the office, I couldn&#39;t help but sigh: &quot;What a pitiful person!&quot; He encountered unexpected disasters at a young age, and now he has a thyroid problem! &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Fortunately, the prognosis of most thyroid cancers is good, so luckily among misfortunes! &amp;rdquo;I comforted myself. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;When I went to work in the afternoon, I clicked on the doctor&#39;s order system to sort out the newly admitted patients today, and found that the patient in a wheelchair was actually admitted to the full bed. I found it strange, so I went to the nursing department and asked about it, and learned that the patient’s mother went to the patient who was in the same bed in the same ward after being admitted to the hospital in the afternoon, saying that her daughter was disabled and wanted to change beds to rest. The patient saw that the patient was in a wheelchair, so he agreed. . &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I vaguely felt something was wrong. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;For several days, this aunt often appeared in the office. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Early the next morning, I was changing into a white coat, and my aunt broke into the dressing room. She asked me if I could arrange surgery for her daughter today. I looked helpless and said that her daughter had just moved in yesterday and had not done any inspections and could not arrange them. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I saw the aunt took out the disability certificate again and showed it to me as if it were a pass: &quot;Doctor, you see my daughter is disabled. She encountered a car accident on the way to get off work. She is leaving now.&quot; There is no road, and there is something wrong with the thyroid gland. Can&#39;t you make a move in advance? &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I was speechless, so I had to excuse myself as this was the dressing room and ask her to wait outside. I was just thinking about how to answer her when I went out and found that she was not outside. As soon as I entered the office, I saw her talking to the director. I guess she just saw the director and moved her position. The aunt held out the worn-out disability certificate in front of the director and said again: &quot;Director, my daughter is disabled. Can you perform surgery on her as soon as possible?&quot; &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Didn’t we arrange for you to move in yesterday? Haven&#39;t you checked yet? We will arrange the surgery as soon as possible, so don&#39;t be too anxious. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;My daughter can’t walk, so it’s better to start early. &amp;rdquo;The aunt emphasized to the director. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The director glanced at the aunt: &quot;I know, we have to hand over the shift soon. You can go back to the bed and wait for the ward rounds!&quot; &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The aunt held the dark green disability certificate tightly and left the office muttering. From the syllables she whispered, I still heard the keywords of disabled, pitiful, and unlucky. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;After completing the ward check, the director initially arranged for the patient to undergo surgery on Thursday. During this period, my aunt came to see me several times and said she wanted to do a check-up in advance. I took a look at the appointment form, but it was to arrange the afternoon examination to the morning. I felt that the afternoon examination would not affect the surgical process at all, and I did not want to increase the burden on the auxiliary department for no reason, so I did not call the auxiliary department. I could already predict the reasons that my aunt was going to say. Before she started to talk about it, I deliberately got up and left the office for a while to avoid too much contact with her. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;On Wednesday afternoon, I found the patient and her aunt for a routine preoperative conversation. As expected, the aunt’s first sentence was: &quot;Doctor, can you arrange for us to be on the first station?&quot; My daughter is disabled, she cannot go hungry! &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Because the aunt used this reason N times, I became immune to it, and my initial sympathy was gradually diluted by the aunt&#39;s statements again and again. People tend to have a rebellious mentality, and fate often plays the opposite joke on people. The more you pray for something, the harder it is to get it, such as care, concern, good luck and love. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I told my aunt very seriously: &quot;The number of operations is decided by the director. Her daughter is the second one and will be taken to the operating room at about nine o&#39;clock.&quot; If she really feels hungry, you can give her fluids first. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;How can this be done? ! Can&#39;t you explain my daughter&#39;s situation to the director? &quot;The aunt was a little anxious, and she was about to take out the disability certificate from the bag she carried with her. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Everyone in our department knows your situation. Tomorrow, the first channel scheduled is an old woman in her nineties. She is very old and came earlier than you. Besides, the time difference is only an hour or two, so your daughter shouldn&#39;t be hungry, and it won&#39;t delay your work. We have already provided you with a lot of convenience. &amp;rdquo;My tone was not as polite as usual. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;When the aunt saw this, she stuffed the half-taken disability certificate back into her bag and stopped talking. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I told them the risks related to the operation in a formal manner, told the patients not to eat or drink after twelve o&#39;clock tonight, and then asked them to sign. After they left, I took a deep breath and said to my colleagues next to me: &quot;This aunt is really good. She can do anything because her daughter is disabled.&quot; &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Yes, I have heard her say it many times. Although her daughter is quite miserable, there is no need to talk about it all the time. It is a bit moral. It means coercion. &amp;rdquo;The colleague nodded. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;After the operation is done on her tomorrow, if there is no problem, she must be discharged from the hospital as soon as possible to prevent her mother from being nagging every day! &amp;rdquo;I shook my head. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Fortunately, everything went well for the patient after the operation, and her mother started asking me when I could discharge her daughter from the hospital. After the evaluation met the discharge standards, I quickly handled the discharge procedures for her. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I feel relieved that my ears can finally be quiet. On the day they were discharged from hospital, I passed by the elevator area on my way to other departments and happened to see my aunt and her daughter waiting for the elevator. The aunt was pushing a wheelchair, and the wheelchair was filled with daily necessities. The patient on crutches stood aside. When they saw me, they didn&#39;t shy away from me. I specifically observed the way the patient walked, and it was not much different from normal people. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I returned to the department in disbelief and hurriedly told my colleagues what I had just seen. A colleague said that he had also seen it. He said that the patient seemed to be unable to move while sitting in a wheelchair while being hospitalized. However, when he was discharged from the hospital, he was walking smoothly. Thanks to me for providing them with so much convenience. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Colleagues said: &quot;Isn&#39;t this a clear case of &#39;bullying others&#39;?&quot; &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I think it is true that the young patient encountered an accident. After all, she has a certificate of disability. Why do they deliberately highlight and magnify the suffering they have experienced? Is it just for a little convenience? &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In my contact with my aunt, I felt that there were obvious differences between her and Mrs. Xianglin. Mrs. Xianglin was just complaining repeatedly. She was expressing her unwillingness to accept the suffering. As for this aunt, she seems to be trying her best to find out the possible benefits from the suffering, and she wants to take advantage of it to the extreme. She turns the suffering into a hallucinogen in order to achieve her own selfish goals. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;But can anything really be gained from this? The patient remained silent, sitting in a wheelchair, pretending to be a paralyzed person, and staring blankly at her mother. She may not really agree with her mother&#39;s actions from the bottom of her heart. She was obviously able to walk, but because of her mother&#39;s plan, she became unable to walk during the few days she was hospitalized. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;It is true that she has endured too much after suffering a double blow from a car accident and illness. People who understand her situation will generally be willing to take the initiative to help her within their ability. There is really no need to deliberately exaggerate one&#39;s own strength. Fragile. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;What I saw was only a small part of her long life after the car accident. At other times, she would most likely have to follow her mother&#39;s design and play various incapacitated people. In the end, she entered the play. If it goes too deep, she will become a mentally paralyzed person. Compared with the small conveniences gained, isn&#39;t it worth the loss? &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;What is even more frightening is that after experiencing suffering, some people are not limited to seeking convenience for themselves. They even try to make up for their own shortcomings by depriving others of their happiness, and ultimately lose the bottom line of being a human being. and dignity were also lost. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;So how should we deal with suffering? &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Every patient who comes to my hospital for surgical oncology can be regarded as someone who has suffered great suffering. Even though the prognosis of thyroid malignant tumors and breast malignant tumors is much better than other malignant tumors, However, most patients after being diagnosed will have a tension in their hearts. They feel that the God of Death has only left temporarily, not far away. Moreover, the God of Death has encountered them face to face. With the impression, they may think of them one day. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Most people are worried and their emotions are unpredictable, which makes the family members who accompany them also feel frightened. Being sick means that you have the privilege of making unreasonable troubles. No one will care too much about a patient. They extend their suffering to those close to them. A small number of people respond passively, surrender to the disease in advance, and plan a deadline for themselves in advance, which aggravates their suffering. On the other hand, a small number of optimistic people will regard suffering as a passer-by and will not let it affect their lives. They are like flowers blooming on the cliff, because the harsh environment can better show their inner positive vitality. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;When I first joined the company three years ago, I treated a patient with breast cancer. She was in her forties and had just finished a combination of surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy, and was extremely weak. Surgery removed her left breast. Chemotherapy made her bald. The high-dose hormones used during the procedure made her swollen and fat. Radiation therapy made a large area of ​​skin on her left chest wall black and rough. If I hadn&#39;t looked at her age beforehand, I would have thought she was at least fifty. I couldn&#39;t help but feel distressed when I saw her, thinking that the disease not only deprives a woman of her physical integrity, but also destroys her appearance and body. It affects people almost in all directions. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I see that patients are quite calm about this. During the examination, she expressed a sense of excitement that the treatment was finally over. When she asked me about the test results, she kept saying: &quot;Great!&quot; I don’t have a problem with this, I don’t have a problem with that either, but I got through it! &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I reminded her that even if there is no problem now, it does not mean that everything will be fine. Regular review after tumor surgery is very necessary, especially in the first five years, and must not be taken lightly. I told her again that when her body recovers, she must exercise to lose weight. Excessive BMI is related to many diseases. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The patient nodded repeatedly and was discharged with a smile. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I occasionally learn about her current situation from her attending doctor, because her mental state has always been very good, and the attending doctor is deeply impressed by her. But a few months ago, the attending doctor told me that she was admitted to the hospital again. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I didn’t recognize her at first because she had successfully lost twenty pounds, which was a whole lot thinner than I remembered. She had thick black hair again, which she pinned with a pink hairpin at the back of her head. Because she wears a prosthetic breast, she cannot see the missing left breast while wearing a dress. She put on makeup, bright lipstick, and had her hands done with manicure. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;This admission was due to a newly discovered nodule in her right breast. Considering that she had a history of breast cancer, the attending doctor recommended that she be hospitalized for further examination. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I reassured her that there might not be a big problem. She said that she was not afraid of breast cancer. She told me with great satisfaction that her son was admitted to a key university this year. She has lived a happy life in the past few years. Her life is enough and she no longer wants too much. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;If there is a problem, continue to treat it. If it is cured well, you will earn money. If it is not cured, then you will accept your fate. Of course, no problem is the best! In life, everything can never go as you wish! &amp;rdquo;She said with a smile. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I was amused by her free and easy attitude, and I praised her: &quot;You have such a good attitude!&quot; &quot;She said: &quot;What else should we do? Things happen and you can&#39;t stop them. Being happy is just a day, and being unhappy is just a day. It&#39;s better to live happily! Anyway, my son has a bright future. I don’t think I have any regrets in life. Just live one day at a time! &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The patient was familiar with the hospital environment because he had been hospitalized many times three years ago. He told me that returning to the hospital felt like returning home. In addition to conducting examinations, she also counseled other newly diagnosed patients in the ward. She spoke from her own experience, shared her journey of treating the disease, and told others that breast cancer is not scary at all. When the patients around me saw her spirit, they unconsciously had some visions for the future, which made my communication with them much easier. The most important step in communicating with cancer patients is to tell them that early- and mid-stage cancer is not an incurable disease and they must actively cooperate with treatment. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;To my relief, the biopsy of her right breast nodule was confirmed to be benign.
