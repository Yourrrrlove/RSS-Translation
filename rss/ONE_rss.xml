The B&amp;B area she rented was expanded in the past few years in response to the skyrocketing number of tourists. They are all two-story farmhouse buildings, which are very similar. In addition, once the popularity of B&amp;Bs passed, the supply now far exceeds demand. Since she moved in, she has been almost the only resident in this small courtyard. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;There are three rooms on each floor of the small courtyard. There is a public living room and kitchen on the first floor, and there is also a lonely swing in the yard. She has never met the hostess of the B&amp;B. They only communicate through WeChat. If she was short of something, she would go to a nearby canteen to buy it. Every time she went out when it was dark, she would quickly get the needed items from the store, pay and leave without saying a word or staying for a second. . Of course she is not afraid of viruses, but of people. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;She lost her job due to pneumonia the year before last. The company she had worked for for many years kicked her out when the results were not good. When she received the layoff notice, she was confused and couldn&#39;t figure out why she was one of the first batch of employees to be laid off. She has always been conscientious in her work, never being late or leaving early, nor taking any sick leave. Although she is obsessed with love, she has avoided the impact of marriage leave and maternity leave on her career. The reasons given by the leader were even more ridiculous, saying that she was old and senior, the company was in difficulty, and her price/performance ratio was too low. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I don’t know how many things she has done for the leader in private, all of which takes up her precious personal time. Fortunately, the leader is also a woman and will not take advantage of her body, but it will also consume her not-so-splendid youth. Being treated as an outcast, no matter how many moves she made on the chessboard, it was all in vain. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;She was already thirty years old when she was laid off. Where can she find a job now? Especially since she was unmarried and had no children, she was directly thrown into the HR taboo queue. After all, the company is for profit, and no one will choose to hire her because of her miserable situation. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The house leaked and it rained all night. Shortly after she was laid off, the H city where she lived was under lockdown for a while. Prices have risen sharply after the lockdown was lifted, and her rent was about to expire. The landlord informed her that the monthly rent would increase by 30%. If she could accept it, she would renew the lease. If she didn&#39;t, she would leave immediately. She thought about it and decided to pack up and return to her hometown. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;She called her mother, who sounded a little unhappy after hearing this. The first thing she said back to her was, when the situation gets better, you should return to City H, right? You can&#39;t stay at home all the time, the neighbors will laugh at you! &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;She didn’t respond, not knowing how to answer in such a way that she would neither deceive her mother nor herself. Anyway, let&#39;s go home for a while. The company gave her unemployment compensation according to normal procedures. If she saves money, she should be able to persist for a longer period of time, she thought. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Things should be thrown away and given away. She has been working in City H since she graduated from college, and her room has been filled to the brim with all the purchases she has made over the years. She never thought that she would leave H City, just like she never thought that the company would fire her. There are always many unexpected things in life. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Every time she moved before, she felt that she couldn’t lose any of her belongings. Until this time when she was leaving City H and would probably never come back again, she suddenly felt relieved about her belongings. After some disposal, When she left, she found that her two suitcases were not completely full. Many things that were originally considered inseparable will become inseparable under restrictions, just like everyone must give up their physical bodies in the end, so there is nothing that cannot be lost. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Her life after returning home was not easy. The small county town has a high population density and poor mobility. People usually talk about only so many people and so many things. I am worried that there is no new topic, so she adds spice to the peaceful small town life. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;At first, she thought it was nothing. When she went out with her mother, she met uncles and aunts who were 90% unfamiliar and 100% familiar. She greeted them politely. Her uncle and aunt asked her if she was on vacation, and she answered truthfully that she had just resigned. The uncle and aunt looked at each other, and asked her in a tone that was three parts embarrassed, four parts curious, two parts testing, and one part comforting: &quot;Oh, the employment situation is not good due to pneumonia recently. You can rest for a while first, and then look for a job after you have enough energy.&quot; Big money job. By the way, do you have a partner? ” After hearing this, she could only smile and shake her head. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;You are not young anymore, it’s time to find someone, age waits for no one! &amp;rdquo;My uncle and aunt hurriedly advised me. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;She felt a little uncomfortable, and her mother beside her looked even more displeased. She scolded her when she got home, complaining about why she was embarrassed by going out on the street. She didn&#39;t know where she had lost her person. This society seemed unable to tolerate the temporary frustration of young people. Oh, by the way, she was not considered a young person when she was over thirty years old. In order to reduce the criticism from people around her, she tried to reduce the chances of going out. If she had to go out, she tried to do it at night. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Even with all this care, she was still troubled. Whenever her mother gets angry at her for no reason when she comes home, she knows that her mother must have just heard gossip about her outside. People have terrible reputations, and rumors about her returning home have even evolved into the fact that she is the mistress of a company leader for many years. Recently, the leader&#39;s wife found out about the itinerary code problem, so he ordered her to be expelled from H City. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Similar rumors have their own noses and eyes. If she hadn&#39;t been the person involved, even she would have mistakenly thought they were true. Her mother said: &quot;You have been in Company &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Her mother’s words made her even more confused. She reluctantly explained that she had actually had several relationships, but they were short-lived and did not lead to success, so she did not mention it to her parents. She also explained that the 50,000 yuan was the compensation paid by the company in accordance with the labor law when she was laid off. She thought that she could not live and eat for free when she returned home, so the money should be used as food expenses. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Her mother was dubious after hearing this, and finally came to the conclusion: &quot;I think when the pneumonia situation gets better, you&#39;d better go back to City H.&quot; &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;She smiled. Even though she took on most of the housework at home and laughed with her uneasily all day long, she still couldn&#39;t resist the malice brought by others&#39; suspicions. She felt a little sour in her heart, and suddenly felt that her company didn&#39;t want her, and her family didn&#39;t want her either. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Later, pneumonia spread to her hometown, and her county went into silence several times in succession, which lasted for more than three months. She and her mother were facing each other day and night, and she felt more and more that she was being talked about so hard that she couldn&#39;t breathe. She felt that it was time to change her life. When she was browsing her phone, she saw some netizens sharing their daily life living on Penglai Island. The photos showed bright sunshine, blue sky and blue water, which made her yearn for it. She checked and found that during the pneumonia period, the accommodation fee on Penglai Island, which was once a popular tourist attraction, was only one-fifth of the usual price. If you rent it for a long time, there will be an additional discount. It is a good place for her. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;She picked a B&amp;B, negotiated the price, and paid three months&#39; rent in advance. Then she lied to her mother that she had found a job. After simply packing her luggage, she embarked on her escape to Penglai Island. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;First she took the bus, then the high-speed rail, then transferred to the bus, and then boarded the boat. After many twists and turns, she finally arrived at Penglai Island after scanning the code countless times. Penglai Island is an independent small island in the sea located in the east. There are many temples on the island, and most of the people who come here are pilgrims who have requests. She didn&#39;t have much interest in praying to gods and Buddhas, she just wanted to seek peace and quiet. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;It turns out that she also wanted something. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;She was reading books and watching dramas in her room. When she was hungry, she went to the kitchen downstairs and cooked meals that only she could eat. At first, she felt that she was finally relaxed, and no one was pointing fingers at her in front of her. But once she got used to the extreme silence and her vigilance against the outside world dropped, many unnoticeable thoughts emerged from her heart. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;She thought about the bad words her first love said to her, the yelling at her by her cooperating partner, and the disdain of people in her hometown for spreading rumors about her... When she thought about it, she would lie in bed and shed tears. Tears, difficulty falling asleep, frequent dreams, and easy awakening. When she can&#39;t sleep, she likes to watch some vulgar videos. She didn&#39;t understand why such nutritious videos were so popular on various platforms, but now she understands the secret--you don&#39;t need anything to watch them. think. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;She didn&#39;t want to have any thoughts. Her desire to survive gradually dropped, as if she had entered a deep well. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;July 3rd is her thirty-second birthday. In the past, there was no ceremony. The company would not give any extra holidays or rewards for employees&#39; birthdays. Instead, insurance companies and Taobao stores sent her greetings on time and told her that she could enjoy a limited-time birthday discount when placing orders now. She knew that they only paid attention to her for the sake of RMB. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;When she got up early, she shed a lot of tears again. She cried more and more frequently and for longer and longer periods of time. She was losing weight rapidly, mentally and physically. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Until he comes. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;At noon on her birthday, she was lying on the bed and heard the sound of a suitcase mopping the floor. The sound seemed very noisy in the quiet surroundings. She had long been accustomed to living alone in this courtyard, so she naturally disliked this uninvited guest, although she felt sorry for the proprietress who was operating at a loss. The room she lived in faced the courtyard, and she was not interested in caring about who was coming, but at that moment, she decided to stand up. She opened the curtains a crack, and she saw him carrying a big bag and dragging a black The suitcase went upstairs. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Next she heard the sound of him carrying his suitcase, footsteps going upstairs, and the sound of the electronic unlocking of the door in the next room. She couldn&#39;t help but feel a little annoyed. She thought she could stay here quietly, but God didn&#39;t even grant her this wish, not to mention that today was her thirty-second birthday. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Haha. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Fortunately, the sound in the next room quickly disappeared. She fell back to bed, feeling dizzy. When she woke up, she was going to go downstairs to cook something. She had not eaten much for several days. . He also came to the kitchen on the first floor. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;She didn’t care about the disheveled appearance. There was no one in the world that she cared about. She only paid attention when she heard the sound of him opening the refrigerator door. All the things in the refrigerator were purchased by her and were her material guarantee when she didn&#39;t go out. When she saw him taking a piece of bread, she had to say: &quot;Sorry, this bread is mine.&quot; &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;He was stunned for a moment, shrugged, and put the bread back in the refrigerator. He asked where he could buy food nearby. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Go out and turn left for 200 meters, then turn right for 300 meters, and there is a supermarket. ’ she said. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;The sun is so strong now and it’s so sunny when you go out. Can you give me an extra noodle and I’ll pay you. &amp;rdquo; he requested. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;She looked up to see him, a feeling of déjà vu came to her face, but she was sure that today was the first time she met him. Probably because of the familiar feeling, she nodded in agreement. She suddenly felt a vague sense of security in a strange place. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;She laid an egg for her and him respectively. Today is her birthday after all, so there needs to be a sense of ceremony. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;She brought a bowl of noodles to the table on the first floor, and he was playing with his mobile phone with his head down. She was carrying another bowl of noodles and was about to go upstairs. This was a habit she had developed while living in a B&amp;B, and she wanted to minimize the chance of meeting people. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Hello, give me your QR code so I can pay you. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;No, it’s my birthday today and I’ll treat you to it. &amp;rdquo;She didn&#39;t know why, but she could mention it to him so naturally that today was her birthday. In the past, she had solemnly mentioned it to others in the hope of getting a gift or a happy birthday, but What she got was always an emotionless &quot;Oh&quot;. She felt that she was asking for trouble, and later she had the consciousness not to mention it again. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Really? What a coincidence that I came here! In this way, I will buy you a cake to celebrate tonight. Happy birthday! &amp;rdquo;He said. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;She smiled and continued to go upstairs. The stranger&#39;s happy birthday in front of her satisfied her. After all, she had already learned not to expect anything from anyone. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;She returned to the room, put the noodles on the table, and began to feel sad again as she ate. After eating, she went back to bed. In fact, she couldn&#39;t sleep, lying down was just a way for her to pass the time. She doesn&#39;t know where the future lies. Constantly scrolling through her phone will cause severe pain in her eyes, so lying down is her best choice. It&#39;s a sad daily life of doing nothing. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In a trance, she went back to her seventh birthday. When she took the cake brought back by her mother, she failed to hold it firmly and accidentally dropped the cake to the ground. Her mother was furious, saying that she did it on purpose, that she deliberately made her mother have a hard time, that she made it difficult for her mother and that she would not be able to feel better either. She stayed aside, feeling that she had made a huge mistake and not daring to breathe. Her mother opened the box and the cake had already been smashed into a pile. Her mother pressed her face on the cake and scolded her fiercely: &quot;I made you clamor for cake, I made you clamor for cake, I let you Eat enough. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Afterwards, she never took the initiative to eat cake again. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Drowsily, she heard a knock on the door. She forgot that there was a guest checking in, and couldn&#39;t help but get up excitedly. She asked who it was, and he said it was him. Then she remembered that there was a guest in the next room. She opened the door and saw him outside carrying a small cake. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;He held up the small cake: &quot;Well, thank you for the noodles this afternoon. This cake is my birthday gift to you. Happy birthday to you!&quot; &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;When she saw the cake, it reminded her of the memory of being seven years old. She was afraid of dropping the cake to the ground again, so she stood still. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Thank you, I, I don’t eat cake. &amp;rdquo;She quickly closed the door, returned to the bed and began to sob. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Are you okay? Why are you crying? &amp;rdquo;He was at a loss outside the door. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;It’s none of your business, thank you, thank you, but I don’t eat cake. ” She barely managed to form a complete sentence from crying. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;After some time, she felt better. She thought that today was her birthday, so she should be more careful than usual, so she picked up the bowl she had used in the afternoon and prepared to put it back downstairs. kitchen. When the door opened, he was still outside. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Why are you still here? &amp;rdquo;She was puzzled. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;He held up the cake in his hand and said, &quot;This cake looks delicious. How about we try it together?&quot; &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;She didn’t respond and went straight downstairs. He followed her, and she simply washed the bowl and put it back in the cupboard. When she turned around, she saw that he had placed a cake on the table with two candles representing the number 18 on it. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;It’s really funny, I’m thirty-two this year. she thought. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Come and make a wish! After the wedding, let&#39;s cut the cake. &amp;rdquo;He talked to her very cordially and naturally, as if he had known her for a long time. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Seeing the hospitality, she sat down and faced him. He lit candles and after singing happy birthday, asked her to make a wish. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;She closed her eyes and raised her hands together between her eyebrows. What could she wish for? She searched her mind carefully and couldn&#39;t think of any ambitious goals, so she prayed, &quot;I want to live well.&quot; &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;It may have taken an unusually long time. By the time she opened her eyes, more than half of the candle had been burned. She looked at him sheepishly, and he shook his head and said it didn&#39;t matter. She blew hard, but she couldn&#39;t blow out the candle, so she finally relied on him to help her. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Cut the cake! &amp;rdquo;Although it is a small cake, it has all the accessories. He handed her a plastic cutter and a paper plate, and she cut the cake in half and handed him half. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;She ate cake with him, and it tasted really good. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;The boss said the buns were delicious, but it seems he didn’t lie to me. &amp;rdquo;He said while eating. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;She smiled and thanked him again. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Are you coming to Penglai Island alone? &amp;rdquo;he asked. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Hmm. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Why are you here? &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Please be quiet, I can’t stay at home. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Haha, me too! I was told by my mother at home that my ears were calloused, so I had to sneak out for some air. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;She didn’t answer the call again. What she said today has seriously exceeded the standard, and her social interaction has also exceeded the standard. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;By the way, how long have you lived here? &amp;rdquo;he asked. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;More than a month? &amp;rdquo;His familiarity made her unable to bear to refuse to respond. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Wow, you have lived here for a long time, are you familiar with the surrounding area? Is there anything delicious and fun nearby? &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;I haven’t been there. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Huh? Then why don&#39;t you just change your home? This would be too expensive for the room fee! &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;She was silent, not knowing how to answer. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;How long are you going to stay? &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;She shook her head and said she had no plan. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;You should still be here these days, right? &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;She nodded. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Shall I take you out for a walk? &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;She looked at him, and that familiar feeling came over her again, making her nod her head without knowing why. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;During the day, he was afraid of the heat and stayed in his room playing games. Apart from the occasional uncontrollable rants like &quot;Holy shit,&quot; he made almost no sound. She gave him free access to the food in the kitchen and would bring him a portion when cooking. Anyway, it was noodles and frozen dumplings, so it wouldn&#39;t be too much trouble to have an extra portion. For his sake, she would symbolically wash a few green vegetables, break them into leaves one by one, put them in the pot, and then take them out and put them on top, adding a bit of life to the monotonous food. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;On the first day, he took her to visit the temple at night. This was the first time she went out for fun on Penglai Island. She was not used to it and followed him closely. On the way, he said to her: &quot;Don&#39;t look at Penglai Island for its small size. There are a total of 108 temples on the island. Start worshiping from the first temple when you enter the island, then go to the Temple of the Reclining Buddha in the west, and finish worshiping them all.&quot; The fastest it takes is three full days. Do you know why there are one hundred and eight temples? &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;She shook her head. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Because there are twelve months in a year, twenty-four solar terms, and seventy-two periods, the total number is exactly one hundred and eight. It is said that people have one hundred and eight kinds of troubles. If you pray sincerely on the island, all the troubles for a year can be eliminated. &amp;rdquo;He explained to her quite proudly. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Really? But I...&quot; She thought for a while, but still didn&#39;t say anything. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Most temples are closed after five o&#39;clock. In front of the closed temples, he tried his best to peek in through the cracks in the doors, as if he could see something out of the ordinary. She looked at him and looked at him, feeling a little naughty and cute. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;A very few temples were still open at night. He wanted to drag her in, but she shook her head helplessly, saying that she felt dizzy as soon as she entered the temple, and the world was spinning. He asked her if she was an evil ghost in her previous life, otherwise how could she explain this strange phenomenon. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;So, am I destined to be troubled? ’ she thought. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;When he saw that she didn’t go in, he didn’t go in either. He pulled her to kneel on the ground with her hands clasped together at the gate of the temple, praying to the inaccessible Buddha statue. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;May I be safe and happy. &amp;rdquo;She muttered silently. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;He occasionally glanced at her secretly and felt that she seemed to have a lot on her mind. He wanted to ask, but felt that he shouldn&#39;t ask. Maybe she would say it naturally when she wanted to say it. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;After many days of continuous worship, he actually took her to complete the 108 temples on Penglai Island. However, due to her special reaction to the temple, both she and she just knelt down and worshiped outside the temple. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;After visiting the last temple, he said to her: &quot;Look, we will have no worries in the next year!&quot; &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;It’s a pity that we are just worshiping outside the temple. Will Buddha complain that we are not sincere, so he only helps us eliminate half of our troubles? &amp;rdquo;She was actually worried that she was dragging him down. After all, there were some temples that he could enter. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;How? ! Buddha only cares about who is sincere and does not care whether it is inside or outside the temple! &amp;rdquo;He smiled to comfort her. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;She nodded thoughtfully, as if she felt that the Buddha had exerted his strength, and her mood was much better than the previous few days. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;He took her to the dam to enjoy the cool air. He and she chose a place with few people and sat on the embankment. The sea breeze that faces you brings the smell of distant places, an ethereal smell far away from human habitation. When the night was not completely dark, she and he saw the patrol staff walking around under the dam. After the night completely darkened, she and he heard the sound of water under their feet and looked down the dam. , the sea water has already overflowed the embankment, and is constantly pulling against the dam. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;You guys, put your feet down quickly. &amp;rdquo;She and he turned their heads and saw the patrolman coming down from the dam to the dam at some point. She and he were sitting facing the sea. This was a dangerous posture. If they were not careful, they would roll down and be swallowed by the rising tide. She suddenly felt that the sound of the tide lapping at the shore below the dam was like the sound of hungry bowels, waiting to eat someone. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;He turned around with her. The island in front of him was lit up with lights, and he asked her: &quot;From here, can you find the yard where we live?&quot; &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;She looked towards the brightly lit place, but found no clues. The yard where she lived with him didn&#39;t seem to have anything special, just like her, she would be lost if she was thrown into the crowd. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Seeing that she was confused, he raised his finger and pointed to a yard, asking her to take a closer look. He said: &quot;That&#39;s our small courtyard, with a bright word &quot;福&quot; on the roof. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;She looked in the direction of his finger and could indeed find a place with the word &quot;福&quot; lit up. The character &quot;福&quot; that was lit up at night may be because the name of the small courtyard where she and he lived was &quot;福&quot;. Come to Yuan Inn! &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;She turned to look at him through the moonlight. His profile was like a mountain, giving people an unusual sense of stability. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;He seemed to notice something and turned to look at her. She and he were sitting relatively close to each other, but suddenly they became even closer. She could feel his warm breath, and she felt her heart beating very fast. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;She always felt that her heart stopped beating many years ago. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;She quickly turned her head back to its normal position, and the atmosphere between her and him became subtle. She didn&#39;t speak, and he didn&#39;t speak again. They sat on the dam for a long time until they heard the buzzing of mosquitoes. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;When she and he were about to get up and leave, he said: &quot;When I was doing the guide, I saw on the Internet that there would be very few tourists in Qianbusha after 8:30. How about you go there with me?&quot; Transfer it? It is said that the sand there is very fine. I think it may be the original site of Liusha River. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Okay. ’ she said. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;She and he walked through the light and darkness together and came to Qianbusha. He took off his shoes and threw them aside, encouraging her to follow his example and take them off as well. The beach was full of deep, shallow, large and small footprints left by tourists during the day. She felt that the soles of her feet were soft and crisp. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Wow, this sand is so comfortable to walk on! ” He said excitedly, and then stepped hard several times. Perhaps he felt that he was still not satisfied, so he simply took off his shirt and ran on the beach. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Wow, wow. &amp;rdquo;He ran and screamed at her. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Come on, come and run with me! &amp;rdquo;He ran towards her, urging her to go crazy with him. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;She was about to refuse, but unexpectedly he took her hand and ran. There was a strong force in his hand that she couldn&#39;t refuse, so she had no choice but to follow him automatically and start running. He put his other hand to his mouth, pretending to be half a trumpet and shouted loudly to the sky. He looked at her, and she followed suit, and the two of them ran along the coastline while shouting. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;After running and sweating profusely, he fell down. There was soft and elastic sand underneath, so there was no need to worry about safety. She fell down, and the two of them looked at the moon and stars in the sky, as if the entire universe appeared in front of them. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Look, that’s Cancer. &amp;rdquo;He pointed to the sky and said. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;She thought he was so amazing that he could find her constellation among so many stars. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Haha, don’t take it seriously, I was just guessing. &amp;rdquo;After he finished speaking, he laughed, and she laughed too. In the silent night, their laughter was so penetrating that it seemed to tear a hole into the night. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;After resting enough, they stood up. He looked back for the clothes he had thrown away, saying that if he hadn&#39;t seen her by his side, he would have taken off his pants and ran away. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;He said that people seem to be in bondage all the time. They will be wrapped in swaddling clothes when they are born, and they will be put on shrouds after they die. Except for bathing and sex, clothes are always around the body. Visible clothes, intangible clothes. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;He said that his biggest wish is to become a psychopath. People are taught to follow a set path from birth, and are told what to do is reasonable behavior, but a cookie-cutter life is really boring. . Once you become a psychopath, you can rationalize unreasonable things according to your own wishes, and people around you will not dare to point fingers in your face. Just thinking about it will make you feel satisfied. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Do you know how to be a psycho? &amp;rdquo;he asked. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;She said she didn’t know, but she also wanted to know the answer. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;They walked into the small courtyard, and there were still no new residents in the courtyard. She saw the swing and wanted to sit on it. She asked him to push her from behind, and he exerted so much force that the swing went up so high. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Oh, you pushed it too high! ’ she said. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Haha, didn’t I just ask you how you became a psychopath? It suddenly occurred to me that if I swayed so hard, I might lose my mind and become a psychopath. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Okay, please try harder. ” She changed her request to him. She held the swing tightly and rose and fell under his push. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Okay, little sister, are you okay? My arms are a little sore! &amp;rdquo; he requested. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;It doesn’t seem like you’ve been completely swung away, but seeing that you’re tired, I’ve had enough. &amp;rdquo; she replied. He immediately stopped pushing, and the swing, which lacked external power, swung back and forth a few times based on inertia, and slowly stopped. She jumped down and looked up at him from a close distance. She said regretfully: &quot;It&#39;s a pity that after hanging around for so long, I still haven&#39;t become a psychopath.&quot; &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;It doesn’t matter, just take your time. &amp;rdquo;He laughed. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;She went upstairs and he followed her. They each went back to their rooms. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The next morning, he knocked on her door and said that he had cooked dinner early in the morning and asked her to go downstairs to eat. She thought to herself that he could eat all the dark dishes she cooked for so many days. He didn&#39;t look like someone who could cook. Could it be that he was a hidden chef? Similar to the secretive sweeping monk in the temple. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;She went downstairs and saw that he had prepared a glass of milk and a homemade sandwich for her - two pieces of bread with ham, lettuce and eggs sandwiched between them. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;She ate slowly. Except for breakfast with her parents at home, she rarely eats with anyone in the morning. Her relationship was short-lived, far from the point of living together with them. The only way to get up together occasionally was to order takeout or find something to eat. She had never enjoyed being taken seriously. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;He sat opposite and ate big mouthfuls. He asked her again: &quot;What do those pilgrims come for?&quot; &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;She widened her eyes, wanting to hear what he had to say. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;He said with a slightly profound meaning: &quot;Those pilgrims are just seeking wealth, health, children and marriage. In the final analysis, life is nothing more than wealth, sex, fame, food and sleep.&quot; But there are so many people asking for help, can the Buddha take care of them? Wouldn&#39;t it be unfair if this person&#39;s wish was met but that person&#39;s wish was not met? &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;As for you, you seem to be making your vows seriously every time you go to the temple. &amp;rdquo; she asked. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;quot;I am not a pilgrim. I came here simply to seek peace and quiet. I pray that the Buddha can bless my ears and ears and stop being nagged by my mother. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;You see, when we see others begging, we feel that we have nothing to ask for, but we still have a vision. &amp;rdquo;After she finished speaking, she ate the last bit of toast in her hand. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;It is good to ask for something, but the worst thing is to ask for nothing. Once the vision is gone, the meaning of life is gone, life is like a walking corpse, and death is close. Those who seek wealth, health, children, and marriage are ordinary people who just want to live a good life. Of course, there are also people who ask others to make everyone&#39;s life better, so-called saving all sentient beings. Wishes are nothing more than high or low, they are thoughts in the impermanent world, and the Buddha is just a bystander. The realization of thoughts in the end depends on their own chance and coincidence, not to mention that everyone is his own Buddha. &amp;rdquo;She continued. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In so many days together, he rarely heard her take the initiative to speak, especially when she talked so much, she always smiled and responded seriously. He was surprised by how much she said at once, how deeply she said it. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;When I was a kid, a monk came to my family to beg for alms. He said he was from Puji Temple on Penglai Island. My mother gave him ten yuan and was about to send him away. When he saw me, he took the money and offered to show me my horoscopes. My mother happened to believe this, so she reported my birth date to the monk. He pinched his fingers and said that I was destined to be a Buddha. He also told me that when I was thirty, I should kowtow at a temple with a sea. He didn&#39;t say anything more. When he left, he emphasized to me again the keywords of thirty years old and a temple with sea, so I was deeply impressed. I actually don’t understand why I feel dizzy as soon as I enter the temple because I have a predestined relationship with Buddha. &amp;rdquo;She held her head. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;About the past few years, I have been dreaming about visiting various temples. Some temples are in deep mountains and old forests, some are in the ice and snow, and some are in mass graves. I always go to the temple alone, crossing mountains and tombs on the way, and the temple is usually empty. In the dream, I didn&#39;t feel dizzy. The Buddha statues in front of me were so lifelike that I even knelt down and kowtowed to them. You think it&#39;s strange or not, but things that cannot be done in real life can be realized repeatedly in dreams with ease. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;He did not interrupt her and allowed her to continue. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Last year, I lost my job and was laid off by the company I had worked for for many years. I actually don’t like that company either, I’m just used to it.我的领导是个单身妈妈，她的情绪很不稳定，经常对我乱发脾气，我理解她的处境，所以没怎么怨恨她，可能正因为这点，我才能在这家公司待上这么长时间。你看，我学历平平，长相平平，没什么出挑的地方。领导也喜欢让我帮她的忙，我想这是人之常情，从不拒绝，偶尔暗自得意，觉得是领导信任我才愿意这么麻烦我，我喜欢将别人不合理的要求自我合理化。 &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;我谈了几段恋爱，都没成功，那些人给我的感觉糟糕透顶。他们对我不好，我却没有勇气说不，也许是习惯了别人对我不好。我想，根源可能在我妈，她年轻时不情不愿地嫁给了我爸，他们两个人的关系很差，三天一小吵两天一大吵。后来我爸申请调到外地工作躲着我妈，我和我爸长得像，于是我便成为了我妈出气的对象。我之所以选择那些人，是因为和他们的相处模式带给我一种该死的熟悉感，而这种熟悉感又会带来一种安全感，我对他们像对我妈一样，无法说不。 &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;我去年回家待了一段时间，这是我高中毕业以后，在家待得最长的一段时间，与我妈朝夕相处。理智告诉我不要回家，可是我还是想回家，我长大了，我想修正我与我妈的相处模式，妄图以此改变以后的生活。可惜我一见到她，我就会不自主退缩回小时候无能为力的自己。 &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;我今年不是十八岁，而是三十二岁。我没工作，没爱人，似乎也没未来。我妈在家天天对我冷嘲热讽，我忽然想到了那个和尚对我说过的话，他说让我三十岁，要去有海的寺庙磕头，于是我来到了这里。 &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;但你知道的，我不能进寺庙。在你来之前，我并不想磕头。是你带着我，去所有的寺庙外拜了一遍。 &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;我想，生活可能会好起来。 &amp;rdquo;她说完，长舒了一口气。他看着她良久，问：&amp;ldquo;今天的早餐怎么样？ &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;特别好吃。 &amp;rdquo;她说。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;嗯，你觉得好吃就好。明天一早我就要回去了，在外时间长了，家里不放心，总是催我。 &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;她瞬间有点失落，但她很快就用正常的语气说：&amp;ldquo;天下无不散的宴席，还好我们今天仍然能在一起。 &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;晚上她喊他再去大坝吹海风，趁巡逻员离开，她直接把双脚甩到朝着海的一面，让他也跟着做。她抬头，将脖子完全展露开，充分感受海风的吹拂。他见状，伸过手来，一手握住了她的脖子。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;怎么，你要在走之前对我实施谋杀吗？我们无冤无仇。 &amp;rdquo;她笑。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;他的手顺势在她身上滑下来，滑到她胸口的位置停住。她心跳得厉害，和着海浪拍岸的声音，形成只有他和她听得见的二重奏。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;就这样，不知过了多久，直到巡逻人员的探照灯刺了过来，勒令他们转过身，二重奏才被打破。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;她也伸手过去，从他上衣底部往上游走，她觉得她在耍流氓。他没有制止。她手心贴着他的皮肤，来到他的胸口前，感受着他的搏动。他的心脏离她的手心仅有几公分的距离。有那么一刻，她想伸进他的胸腔，把他的心带走。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;她说：&amp;ldquo;你的心跳很有力，真好！心要不跳了，人就没了。很多年前，我外婆去世后，我和我妈回家奔丧，我看外婆躺在卸下来的门板上一动不动，和往常并无什么不同，可大家都说她死了。我那时不信，趁大人在一旁交谈哭泣，跑上去把头放在外婆胸前，像她平时揽我入怀一样。不过我却感受不到那种熟悉的搏动了，那时我才明白，此时的外婆是与之前见到的外婆不一样了。 &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;我喜欢近距离体会活着的感觉，但是说不清多久了，我没有活着的念头了。你说人死后会去哪呢？是去西方极乐世界吗？会不会有大势至菩萨照亮前路，净瓶菩萨手挥甘露前来接引呢？抑或是黑白无常拿着锁链拖着去地府报道？ &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;你说得对，前世的我一定是恶鬼，一定修炼了很长很长时间才能在今世来到人间报道。不过我不知道自己费那番功夫干嘛，人间没什么快乐可言，要经历生老病死，爱别离，怨憎会和求不得。 &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;你觉得你前世是什么？ &amp;rdquo;她问他。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;他思考了一会：&amp;ldquo;也许我还是人吧！是蓬莱岛的某个僧人？我常常梦到我住在海边小岛最高处的一座寺庙里，每天重复着晨钟暮鼓，诵经念佛。 &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;她抽出手，手心沾了不知是他流出来的还是她沁出来的汗。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;她接着问：&amp;ldquo;世间本来就是幻境吗？金刚经云，一切有为法，如梦幻泡影，如露亦如电。人为什么还要活着？还要执着许多相啊？ &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;也许活着是为了去体验，相是为了去破除吧？ &amp;rdquo;他答。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;她听后愣住，不知怎么接话。他也沉默。海风阵阵，潮声阵阵，周围寂静得厉害。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;时间到了，我们去剧场看《观世音》吧？明天我就要离开这里了。 &amp;rdquo;他看了看手机，对她说。他早就和她提过想去看看网友推荐的舞台剧。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;好。 &amp;rdquo;她答。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;验完票，他们入座。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;沉浸式的演出，中途扮演观音的演员跑到观众席中，正好站在了他们旁边。演员手中的杨枝甘露洒了她一脸，她莫名哭了起来，哭得很大声，引发周围人的关注。他将她搂在怀里，任由她的泪水浸满他的T恤，最后她太累了，倒在他肩上睡了过去。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;快散场时她醒了过来。她急迫地拉着他说：&amp;ldquo;走，我们再去千步沙。 &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;她拉着他一路疾驰，直到脚下变成了沙。她将衣服全部脱光，丢下他向前一直跑，跑到脚下变成了水。水漫过她的脚背，小腿，大腿，胸膛，脖颈，头部。她浸入水中，看到远处升起了光。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;她醒来时是清晨，头晕得厉害，像是在水里泡过一样。朦胧间她看见床边有一瓶安眠药，才想起瓶里的药在三天前被她一次性吞了下去。服药计划是她来蓬莱岛的目的，这一瓶安眠药，是她攒了很久才攒齐的。这三天，她做了很长很长的一个梦。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;也许，这个世界，我还有很多没体验，很多相没破除。她努力站了起来，用力拽开门，准备下楼找水喝。 &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;
