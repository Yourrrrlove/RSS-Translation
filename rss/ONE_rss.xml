Gradually, you realize that those comments seem to represent what the whole world thinks, and what the netizens say is the attitude of everyone in the world. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Originally you had a crush on a new starlet, but when you accidentally read some negative gossip about him, your view of him immediately changed; originally you wanted to go there with all your heart. When you do something, there are overwhelming &quot;dissuades&quot; on the Internet, so you hesitate. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Sometimes, when you turn off your phone and leave the Internet, you will ask yourself, have I been &quot;suggested&quot; by something? Am I subconsciously influenced by what I say online? &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;There is an idiom in &quot;Warring States Policy Wei Ce Er&quot; &quot;Three people become tigers&quot;. This idiom means &quot;one thing, if more people talk about it, people will easily misunderstand it.&quot; &quot;Rumors become facts&quot;. &lt;strong>;On the Internet, because the cost of sending information is low and there are no barriers, there are many people talking about it. Over time, those gossipy comments on the Internet have become a fact recognized by everyone. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;So, how are we &quot;suggested&quot; by these online information? &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;1. The overload of information on the Internet makes people overwhelmed and loses the ability to think independently&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Every day when you open the door Before your eyes, a huge amount of information is rushing towards you, and before you have time to figure out one thing, another thing pops up. You don’t have time to get to the bottom of a piece of news, you can only take a few seconds to get an overview. And those netizens who speak or comment before you become the &quot;leaders&quot; of everything. They rush to conclusions hastily, and you follow them without knowing that you have gone astray. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;2. Believe in other people’s conclusions too easily and lack the spirit of exploration&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In fact For many things, you can find the correct answer by checking it yourself and thinking more.&lt;strong>;But the Internet has turned us into lazy people in the information age. We are used to being fed information. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;After forming the inertia of thinking, it is actually difficult for people to really break out. Over time, we tend to become passive recipients of information. You are no longer a hunter with a pioneering spirit, you are just a person who habitually selects information. The information is placed in front of you, you choose to believe it or not, just make a multiple choice question. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Of course, for most ordinary people, it is natural to follow the crowd. People tend to adhere to the opinions that are louder on the Internet. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In fact, if we think about it carefully, many times, are we &quot;suggested&quot; by information on the Internet, and then misunderstand a person for many years? For example, I used to think that a certain female celebrity was immoral in her private life, but recently when I actually read her interviews and her studies, I realized that she is not the kind of person described in online information at all. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Of course, it is personal freedom to choose what to believe or not to believe, but we need to be wary of online information and be wary of the negative impact it has on us. &lt;/strong>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;So, how to get rid of the negative impact of the &quot;suggestions&quot; of online information on us? &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;&amp;middot; Connect more with the real world and &quot;disconnect from the Internet&quot; appropriately;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Nowadays, we are constantly connected with the Internet every day, and there is always an illusion that &quot;the Internet is the world.&quot; But when you take a look at the offline world you are in, you will find that it is completely different from the perception you get online. on the contrary. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;For example, on Weibo and Douban, we often see the statement &quot;Unmarried and childless will keep you safe&quot;, but when you return to your hometown, you will receive a lot of wedding invitations; for example, Xiaohongshu’s monthly salary of 10,000 yuan is embarrassing, but if you look offline, 5,000 yuan seems to be a good salary...&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;The audience of each platform is different , the same type of audience will produce the so-called &quot;strata&quot;, which will lead to information distortion and imbalance. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Instead of being trapped in the panic of being invaded by the &quot;distant world&quot; on the Internet, it is better to look at your mobile phone less and go to the park more, take a walk, and be with nature. touch. During the time spent with the vegetation and mountains, you will only enjoy the beautiful scenery without being overwhelmed by any information. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;&amp;middot; Read more books, think more, and cultivate your independent thinking ability&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In fact, we now live in a In an era of competition for attention. &lt;strong>;You only have so much attention and energy every day. Once it is used up, it is finished and cannot be replenished. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;At this time, we must know the importance, be targeted, and give ourselves some time to read paper books to form our own methodology, values, and thinking patterns. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Only when you truly develop your own judgment and thinking abilities can you truly get rid of the personal impact of online information. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;/p>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;Editor in charge: Zhou Ziheng onewenti@wufazhuce.com&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Please see @ONE Studio’s pinned Weibo for information on the call for papers.

Go do something and seize the last tenderness before winter arrives. &lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Recently, when I got up, the sky outside the window was still clear, but under the bright sun, the temperature was very low. The figure seems to have calmed down as the temperature plummeted. When the weather gets cooler, people start moving. Recently I was cleaning the house and cleaning the windows. The glass was as clean as new and the sky outside the window seemed brand new. I put away the summer skirts and hung up the windbreakers and coats. The last and most time-consuming part was to wax the floor, move all the furniture out of the way, mop the floor spotless, and then apply wax. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;It took three to five days to get this set, which was time-consuming and laborious, but I was very happy. The past few years have been boring. I was supposed to do it every year, but I haven&#39;t done it in three years. At that time, I was in a low mood and didn&#39;t bother to check whether the windows were clean. But now after cleaning them, I realize how bright and clean the windows are, which makes people so happy. The city I live in is dry. In the past few years, the wooden floor has been dry and dull. After waxing, the floor feels smooth and clean. Everything feels comfortable. I am waiting for this short autumn to pass and winter will soon enter. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;When I was younger, I liked summer. The weather was hot and the emotions were full. Love and hate were both strong. But now I no longer like it. I hope everything is the same. Everlasting, as long as winter in the north, so deserted. It&#39;s good to be lively, but it&#39;s not bad to be alone. So I tidied up the house, kept it in order, and waited for the arrival of winter. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;It was only after this that I realized that I had finally come out of the depression of the past few years. People always like miracle moments. It seems that at a certain moment, people will suddenly get better, just like the grace of God. But this is not the case. It was only after a long break that I gradually regained my vitality, feelings, desires, and motivation. The end result was that I got better and started looking forward to the days to come. But this process is long and complicated. I can’t explain what made me feel better. From the moment I regained my freedom, I felt uncomfortable, reserved, and nervous. At this moment, I am back to myself a few years ago, accustomed to freedom. Come and go. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;During this period, there were many awkward moments. At the beginning of the year, when I walked out of the opportunity, no one stopped me. I looked around and thought, is that it? I was traveling around in the middle of the year and was agonizing over filling out forms at customs, how did I do this before? At this moment, I feel confident entering any situation, and there is no need to be frightened. Everything is normal. Occasionally before going to bed, I would lie on a warm and fluffy bed, lean on the pillow and read a few pages of a book, and I would feel comforted. I still remember that last year, I lay in the dark with my eyes open many nights. At that time, I told myself not to cry anymore and to harden my heart. In such difficult days, I always cry and cry. Unexpectedly, only a year later, I would still be reading happily on this bed. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;People are always forgetful. So many things and strong feelings at that time have gradually faded away now. The joy at this moment, the relief of lying down, and the moment of happiness are clear. It&#39;s just that deep down in my heart, I&#39;m still worried. We have a way out and no way back. No matter in the past or now, we still don’t know what the future will look like. Now we are living day by day and can still breathe a sigh of relief. Maybe we are really lucky. Those who were more worried had left, leaving us dumbfounded. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I only have so many abilities, including cleaning the house, reading a few books, and writing some unimportant novels. Days passed day by day, and I spent all my energy enjoying myself in this small world in front of me. We are like the autumn leaves at this moment. Although the leaves are yellowing and the veins are shrinking, they are still hanging firmly on the trees. When winter really comes, maybe with just a gust of cold wind, we won’t know where we will be blown. Fortunately, it is still autumn, a relatively mild season. I am nostalgic and reluctant to leave, waiting for the arrival of winter, hoping that I will still remember the comfort of autumn by then. &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;Editor in charge: Nana&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For information about the call for submissions, please see the @ONE Studio pinned on Weibo.
