These pits may be large or small. Small pits will only cause us a little trouble, but large pits may cause us lifelong trauma. Over time, we may gradually forget about those traumas. However, &lt;strong>;if we don’t face it, clean it up, and treat it, these latent traumas will suddenly make waves one day and induce various mental illnesses. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Why does the long past still cause harm to us now? Why can’t we “get out” and “let go”? &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Research from the University of Adelaide in Australia shows that trauma experienced in childhood can damage the brain&#39;s adrenal hormone and oxytocin secretion systems, resulting in problems with the growth and development of the emotional control system. You may be more familiar with adrenaline, a hormone that is secreted in large amounts during stressful situations to prepare us for fight or flight. Oxytocin sounds like a substance unique to females, but it is actually a substance secreted by both men and women, commonly known as the &quot;love hormone.&quot; Oxytocin can stimulate the desire to socialize, help people actively control emotions, feel love and give love. The amount of oxytocin produced in each person&#39;s body is different based on different genes and gender. One of the leading factors behind whether you are affable or dignified in your dealings with others is the magical oxytocin. The level of development of the oxytocin system greatly affects our ability to receive and feel love. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The oxytocin system is located in the posterior lobe of the pituitary gland. Its growth and development begins when we are in the womb, continues to grow through infancy and childhood, and is finally finalized in adolescence. Psychological injuries, severe setbacks, or physical illnesses suffered during childhood will affect the growth and development of the oxytocin system, resulting in a significantly lower amount of oxytocin in the body as an adult. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;If we think of the brain as a sophisticated instrument, then emotions are the center of this instrument. The biggest obstacle to the development of this center is trauma. &lt;/strong>;We already know from existing research that trauma continues to harm people. Depression, anxiety, personality disorders, self-harm, rage, addiction, complex post-traumatic stress disorder and even suicide are all related to childhood trauma. Even if we have forgotten the trauma, sudden stress, such as the loss of a job, the loss of a loved one, or the dissolution of a marriage, can still trigger a trauma response and keep us trapped in the past. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;What &lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;injury constitutes trauma&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The decisive factor in determining whether an injury is &quot;trauma&quot; is not the severity of the injury, but the individual&#39;s feelings at the time. &lt;strong>;If you feel in danger and alone, that&#39;s trauma. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;When I was a child, I was very small and moved schools frequently, so I was often bullied. When I was eleven years old, I transferred from Heilongjiang to Shanghai. As soon as I entered the classroom, I could feel the unfriendliness of my classmates. The teacher shouted to me: &quot;Hurry up and sit down, why are you standing there in a daze!&quot; &amp;rdquo;I still remember the embarrassing state of mind at that time. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;More than twenty years later, I went to a hospital to apply for a job. Because I needed to use a printer, I went to the front desk to ask for the printer password. The front desk staff yelled: &quot;You don&#39;t know how to look for it yourself!&quot; &amp;rdquo;At that moment, the feeling of being at a loss suddenly emerged. I seemed to be in the classroom more than 20 years ago again. The teacher was shouting at me and the whole class was watching with cold eyes. I was extremely embarrassed and ashamed. Inexplicably, my eyes turned red at that time. Fortunately, all these years of professional training have not been lost. I quickly walked to the bathroom to calm down my emotions, and then accurately found the source of that familiar emotion in the dark room of emotions. In fact, it was the eleven-year-old me who was sad. &lt;strong>;When you know the source of your emotions, it will be easier to comfort yourself, and you won’t let the hurt continue, and you won’t belittle yourself easily. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Sharing such experiences and feelings, some people may think that I am making a fuss out of a molehill - can such a small thing cause &quot;trauma&quot;? Doesn’t every child experience this? It may not be worth mentioning to others, but to me, it was trauma. &lt;strong>;Don’t use other people’s feelings as the standard, but pay more attention to your own inner experience, which is an important criterion for defining trauma. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;How to Deal with Inner Trauma&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Healing from psychological trauma is very difficult. But&lt;strong>;if you don’t pay attention to the pain of the past, the consequences may be more serious. The small splash of water stirred up in the past may turn into a huge wave after time brewing, swallowing us up now. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I worked as a clinical counselor in a public hospital in one of the most deprived areas of London. The residents there have poor economic conditions and low education levels, so the people who came to see me were all patients with severe mental illness. One of the patients impressed me deeply. She was born in an Indian family that favored boys over girls, and she had been responsible for all the housework since she was a child. When she was five, her brother began sexually abusing her, which continued until she was married. What&#39;s even more frightening is that her parents have always acquiesced in her brother&#39;s behavior and forced her to take birth control pills. The marriage was also arranged by the parents. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Growing up in such an environment, she suffered from long-term post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), along with depression and alcohol addiction. During the first diagnosis and treatment, she cried bitterly and told me that she felt that her life was hopeless. I handed her a tissue and gently told her: &quot;But, you survived.&quot; You did very well. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;After that, I accompanied her on the journey of self-rescue. The root cause of post-traumatic stress disorder is &quot;the reoccurrence of past injuries in the present.&quot; Although the sexual assault ended after she got married, in her consciousness, she was still involved in it for more than 20 years. She would unconsciously replay those traumatic scenes in her mind, and then feel the fear, panic, anger, helplessness and sadness she felt at that time again and again. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;So, how should we deal with inner trauma? I usually use the &lt;strong>;following steps to help clients&lt;/strong>;. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;The first step is to process the trauma in an emotionally stable state. &lt;/strong>;It is difficult for people to think rationally under the impact of emotions, so first make sure that your emotions are stable enough, and then start healing. I often take deep breaths to calm myself before I receive a visitor. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;The second step is to salvage memories. &lt;/strong>;Sifting out the most painful memories from the thousands of thoughts in the past. If there is a lot of hurt, don&#39;t rush to remember it together. It takes patience and time to appease your heart. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;The third step is to identify the emotions you felt when you were hurt. &lt;/strong>;Was it shame, fear, humiliation, or anger? Only after you figure it out can you prescribe the right medicine. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;The fourth step is to acknowledge the legitimacy of those feelings and forgive yourself for your initial inaction. &lt;/strong>;What happened in the past may not seem like much now, but it was very serious to me at the time, so it became a knot in my heart. One thing is certain, I tried my best at that time. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The most difficult step in treating post-traumatic sequelae is to recreate the traumatic history, which means creating a safe environment to allow the patient to repeatedly face the person he or she has been hurt by, and to become psychologically desensitized step by step. . This part is very painful. It is not an exaggeration to describe it as painful as picking off bones. &lt;/strong>;Just like my female patient, she broke down and got angry many times, and mentioning those injuries was like opening unhealed wounds again and again. Her narrative is laced with remembered sights, sounds, smells and physical pain. She said that the betrayal of her parents and brother broke her trust in the entire world and made her lose her sense of security, which she could not make up for even after having her own family. At this time, the psychological counselor must help the patient re-establish rules and boundaries while ensuring safety. Just like a film editor, he re-edits the fragments into a movie and gives them a new meaning. These meanings include: becoming more aware of one&#39;s own reactions to stress, reintegrating one&#39;s worldview, getting along better with oneself, and rebuilding reliable social networks. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;After one year of treatment, she plucked up the courage to file a lawsuit against her brother and found a new job that suited her. She also founded a charity to help Indian women who have been through the same thing as her. She said: &quot;I used to really long for my mother to admit that my brother had sexually assaulted me, instead of ignoring my pain just because I was a woman.&quot; My brother and I are both her children, right? Now I know that I have the ability to face my pain, even if the whole world chooses to ignore it. &lt;strong>;Just because you haven&#39;t been cherished doesn&#39;t mean you can&#39;t learn to cherish it. This may be the meaning of pain. &lt;/strong>;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;/p>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;Editor in charge: Mei Butan onewenti@wufazhuce.com&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For the call for papers information, please see @ONE Studio pinned on Weibo .

When walking in a maze and can&#39;t find the direction, backtracking is also a way out. &lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;1.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Mingfang works as an operator in an Internet company. Her work station is outside. I can see the landmark TV tower in H City. My colleague said that the city looks very big, but the only place where people really live their lives is the area where the TV tower can be seen with the naked eye. Urban planning uses this to draw a circle and divide life and survival. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Mingfang was noncommittal, thinking about the streets here more than ten years ago: half-demolished crumbling residential buildings, middle-aged people carrying spittoons into public toilets on summer mornings, dried fish in the lanes, The smell of fried dough sticks, the cold and humid winter air inhaled into the nose, and the faint fragrance of elegant frost. Mingfang followed her parents and the construction team in the village who brought her whole family to the village to continue demolition and construction. Among the ruins, construction sites and rough materials, she completed the most primitive &quot;disenchantment&quot; of the place. At that time, many people, including Mingfang, did not have an overlooking perspective and had no floating tone. They all thought that they could sneak into it with intelligence and diligence, and then stay here decently and for a long time. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;No matter how unrealistic the words are, colleagues in the company, like Mingfang, cannot afford to rent a house near the company, and the daily commuting time alone takes up four to five hours. She shared a house with others, which was said to be two bedrooms and one living room. In fact, the living room was just a narrow corridor. The girl who originally lived in the next room fell in love with her boyfriend and moved out. The second landlord brought a new family, sister, brother-in-law and brother. The door of the room was wide open, Mingfang took a sneak peek, and a shameful curtain was drawn between the two beds. Both men are always sloppy. Ming Fangqi was sitting on the toilet seat in a daze at night. She felt damp and turned on the light, and found urine hanging on the toilet seat. Mingfang wanted to knock on the door and quarrel, but was afraid of something happening in the middle of the night, so she had to endure it. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Mingfang browsed the housing listings on the rental software and could not find a place that was cheaper and more convenient than here. Mingfang thought, wait, wait until the salary on the bank card becomes more abundant, wait until she gets a promotion and a salary increase, or wait until she changes jobs. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Mingfang doesn’t remember how she fell asleep, but she remembers that the dream was not good. Ever since her junior year in college, Mingfang dreamed that her two wisdom teeth had fallen out. When she woke up, she received a call from her mother asking her to go home. Her grandfather was doing a small job and on the day when the roof of the house was poured, he collapsed beside the cement pile and walked away. After that, Mingfang believed that dreams would give her predictions. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;She thought that the safest and most cost-effective way was to talk to the woman in that house and ask her to talk to the men and let them talk about hygiene. The woman was in a hurry to go out and agreed perfunctorily. Mingfang followed her out the door and ran ahead of her until she reached the breakfast shop at the subway entrance. Mingfang bought an extra portion of Shaomai and a cup of soy milk, hung them on the handle of the shared bicycle she unlocked, and said kindly: &quot;Sorry to trouble you, everyone.&quot; None of it is easy. But that night was still the same as the day before. Mingfang had no choice but to find another woman, but the other woman said impatiently: I can&#39;t control them, and I don&#39;t have any control. Ming Fanghuo burst out and said: Come to the police station, you can&#39;t pee in the toilet, what&#39;s wrong with you? She took out her phone and saw three missed calls on the screen, from her mother. Mingfang didn&#39;t bother anymore, ran to the subway station and called back. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Mingfang’s mother was sitting at the food stall in front of the cancer hospital, making fried noodles. There was a dollar of ice dew under the bench. Her grandmother was sitting in a wheelchair next to her, having just finished a bowl of porridge. Mingfang blamed her mother: Why didn&#39;t you tell her in advance? My mother asked back: Can I still choose the time when taking someone else’s car? Grandma&#39;s illness was diagnosed by the county hospital doctor, and my mother was worried. Many people came not to see a doctor in a big hospital, but to give up. Like Mingfang, my mother has lived in this city for many years. It is modern, dazzling, and more importantly, authoritative and trustworthy. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;We can’t wait for hospital beds, and there is no need to wait. The doctor read grandma&#39;s medical records and the films taken by the county hospital, repeated the same conclusion, prescribed medicine, and said: Just go home and take care of her, old man. Mingfang received her assignment. She needed to prescribe medicines for her grandmother on a regular basis and mail them back to her hometown. The county hospital did not have them. The pain and drugs often make grandma unconscious. When she wakes up, she doesn&#39;t know whether it&#39;s day or night. She doesn&#39;t recognize Mingfang or her mother, and she only talks about her uncle. Mom&#39;s spirits are high when she&#39;s tired, but being forgotten can bring tears to her eyes. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Mingfang took her grandmother and mother to the place where they lived, and happened to meet a man who got up to work the night shift. The mother obviously did not expect that there would be a man in the shared house. She thought that Mingfang, who had studied in college, should rent a house like a student dormitory. My mother held my grandma’s wheelchair and stood in the narrow public area, not wanting to go in. She said she wanted to go out and find a hotel. Mingfang grabbed her mother and lowered her voice and said: It&#39;s late at night, do you have a lot of money? Nowadays, all shared apartments are owned by the second landlord, so they don&#39;t care about gender matching. Besides, they are a family, and there is a girl, so we are not compatible with me. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;At night, grandma was asleep, but mother couldn&#39;t sleep. Mingfang said: Order some midnight snacks. This is a small hobby that Mingfang&#39;s mother has retained. For a while, when she worked the night shift at the county&#39;s fiberglass factory, she would leave a bowl of sweet tea for herself in the electric cooker in advance. Apart from that, like all mothers, she has no hobbies. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Before there was no sister, their family was still in H City. My mother cooked in a narrow rental house. At noon, she would cook crayfish, seal them with plastic wrap, and let Mingfang take them to the canteen at the entrance of the alley. Put it in their refrigerator, and then ask the boss to leave two bottles of cold beer in advance, and pay for it together when Mingfang&#39;s father comes back in the evening. In the evening, when the temperature drops, the crayfish is cooked again, the family of three turns on the TV, and the parents drink some cold beer. It is a rare leisure time. At that time, &quot;Little Yu&#39;er and Hua Wuque&quot; was broadcast on TV. Jiang Yuyan was still looking pitiful. Xiao Yu&#39;er and the little fairy were fighting and making trouble, but the tragedy had not yet begun. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Mom dipped her hands in the soup and suddenly said: Crayfish grow up eating feces and mud. Mingfang smiled. This is what grandma often said. In summer, the rivers and ponds near grandma&#39;s house are full of crayfish. It is said that there were not so many in the past. After someone raised them, the lobster seedlings leaked out. Grandpa would take a clean paint bucket and use cotton thread and bamboo poles to catch lobsters. While grandma despised the crayfish as dirty and an invasive species, she washed the crayfish in the paint bucket until the flesh turned white, removed the heads, pulled out the threads, and cut off the tips of the shrimp claws. The next moment, the lobster is put into the pot, the water drops meet the rapeseed oil, the cooking wine shakes hands with the ginger and garlic, and the aroma wafts from the kitchen to the front of the hall. Grandpa retorted: Go fishing with mud and see if you can catch it? He wiped his face with a wet towel and poured hot water into the blue plastic teacup with the welcoming pine printed on it. Because the tea stain was too thick, the color of the tea was not light at all. Ask Mingfang to stand in front of the electric fan and let her cool down. She will drink this when doing small jobs in the afternoon to cool her down and relieve the heat. She will also swallow a pack of rendan before going out. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Now that Mingfang thinks about it, it was a really good time, and everyone at home was ready. But she had just returned to the village from H City and was in no mood to eat. Even if we are a family, our happy times cannot overlap. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;My mother cleaned up the takeout boxes, laid the floor, and asked her how much money she still had. Mingfang handed the phone to her mother. Mom looks at Mingfang’s savings balance just like she looked at Mingfang’s report card many years ago. Finally, she sighed and said slowly: It&#39;s not that long ago, and it&#39;s not like ordinary people can get ahead in H City. You want to stay, I thought the same way back then, but unfortunately the opportunity has passed, so consider going home. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Only then did Mingfang realize that her mother had come here for another purpose: her experience card had expired. Graduates from ordinary universities and liberal arts majors from a small family and a small place have a limited time limit to live here. The depreciation rate of her bank card balance, academic qualifications, profession, ability to endure hardships and stand hard work, and even the rate of death of her conscience are all damaging her progress bar. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;2.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Although her mother has been working and Mingfang went to work directly after graduating from university, the family is still short of money. When she was in college, Mingfang was drawn into a part-time job group, which gathered a group of students with the worst conditions in the school. There are all kinds of jobs in the news: helping others with classes for ten yuan, helping others run a physical test for 800 meters for fifty yuan, working in a small restaurant near the school, calculated based on the length of time, including three meals a day, and there are also people who can pay for orders. You can exchange your identity information for money. In the year of graduation, the group was blamed and the group was about to go to jail. When she dragged her suitcase out of the school gate, there were banners hanging at the door and parents gathered together. There were photos posted on the telephone poles--probably from the entrance interview--with a dark face and combed hair just after military training. A girl with bright eyes who can’t draw her eyebrows yet. Looking from a distance, green smoke and firelight float in the air, rising from the enamel basin depicting the Chinese characters for &quot;Yuanyang&quot; and &quot;Happiness&quot;. What is the currency of that world, what difficulties or desires does the protagonist of the incident have, and when did she sink into the lake in the school? No one knows, but everyone only remembers the money, because of the money. The message sent by the group owner was &quot;Software loan, complete an order, commission 400, professional team.&quot; Mingfang also saw it. When her fingertips crossed the line of words, she brushed against some danger. Mingfang felt that the dead girl was herself, life and death were delicate, and for whom the death bell tolled. When Mingfang saw the face crying in pain, her tears turned into snot. She breathed in her sorrow and ran towards the oncoming bus. She raised her suitcase with all her strength and squeezed on. Mingfang has to catch a train to H City, where she has been away for many years, to take the first class in her life. Even if she was embarrassed, she planned to rush forward. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Mingfang was very difficult and sad. She couldn&#39;t tell her mother about the dangers and unreachable situations that were just one step away. Likewise, her mother would not tell her. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In the past, her mother said that she did not want Mingfang to stay in the village and spend the whole year with her when she had a runny nose and spent the New Year in a sloppy way so that the whole family could see her. The mother wanted to stay at home, but the father needed the boy and the mother&#39;s spare uterus after a short rest, so they formed an outside family of three in H city. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;After working in decoration for several years, my father slowly tried to contract construction sites and decoration. He contacted fellow villagers in H City and would bring people out from the village. Trying to bring together bricklayers, masons, painters, as well as young, middle-aged and elderly people without retirement wages who have physical strength. They build and paint the houses in H City, hoping that one day, they will emerge from among the countless ruins. , earn a bright future. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In Mingfang’s impression, her father was always dusty and covered in debris from building materials. They moved frequently, wherever there was a construction site and surrounded by blue iron sheets, the Mingfang family would move there. During the years when the three of them lived in a tin work shed, Mingfang&#39;s father was on the construction site, and her mother had to cook for them in a big iron pot that didn&#39;t taste good, heated unevenly, and the rice was cooked. No one tasted it except Mingfang. Heavy salt and heavy oil, wrapped in protein and carbohydrates, are replenished into the exhausted body one bite at a time. Hungry and tired people can&#39;t taste the food. On weekends, my father took Mingfang and her mother to play under the landmark TV Tower. They took the elevator up to buy tickets, and they stretched their necks below to look. Mingfang bought a ticket and went up after work, and realized that what she saw when standing under the tower were human heads, while what she saw when standing on the tower was the scenery. She and her mother listened to her father&#39;s heroic words. He said: After a few more years of hardship, his son will be able to take the college entrance examination here. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;On the way home, they went in the wrong direction and wandered around in the intricate alleys. Scenic spots, landmarks, and high-rise buildings are always surrounded by dilapidated houses, like a symbiotic relationship in nature. There are smelly ditches, garbage dumps, pickled goods hanging under the eaves, and you can see a face of salt when you look up. Dad found a small shop and was only willing to buy a bottle of mineral water. He gave it to Mingfang and her mother to drink. After being called &quot;outsider&quot; many times, he asked for a way out and walked home without saying a word. He was so thirsty that he went straight to the tap and drank a lot of raw water. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&quot;Outlander&quot; is a curse word in Mingfang&#39;s heart. Mingfang heard it more than once from when she remembered it to when she left H City. Later, she and her local classmates in H City learned to speak the local dialect fluently, and she went out on her own. Even her Mandarin had a hint of the H City dialect. The final sound of the H City dialect is soft and gentle, even if it comes out through a boy&#39;s vocal cords, someone will be willing to reach out and support it. Mom and Dad said that Mingfang was already a local, but Mingfang knew that no, she was far from here. It was just that there were almost no locals on her parents&#39; construction site, so she could fake it. The area where Mingfang Junior High School is admitted is very strange, like the Mandarin Duck Hot Pot, the Tai Chi Bagua Diagram or the Three-Colored Cup. It is something with clear boundaries, stable internal structure, and cannot be dismantled. Dad&#39;s engineering team demolished it here, and other engineering teams built it here. The protected buildings that must not be harmed are also here. They are guarded by towering plane trees and exquisite copper fences. In the first semester, the school organized a trip to the botanical garden. As spring and summer transitioned, the temperature rose. It was too warm in the bus before the air conditioner was turned on. Mingfang got motion sick, but could not open the window. After getting off the bus, she carried a plastic bag on the roadside. Vomit. Strangely, no one in the class got carsick. They seemed to be used to the smell of gasoline and the sudden braking at traffic lights. Even when Mingfang felt nauseous, they would keep stuffing sweet snacks into their mouths. The teacher gently stroked Mingfang&#39;s back and said: Little girl, you are missing a seat in the car. Mingfang suddenly realized that they all had cars at home. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;This is the period when Mingfang’s family is in the best economic situation, so Mingfang can go to school here. They moved into an old building that will be demolished in a few years. They have a toilet and a TV, but no air conditioning or refrigerator. At the same time, Mingfang&#39;s mother became pregnant. During the prenatal check-up, my father couldn’t wait to ask the doctor: Is it a boy or a girl? can not say? Then bring a handle? The doctor scolded him sternly, but he not only did not refute, but also showed a flattering and tolerant smile. An aunt from the same hometown who came to H City to work as a nanny secretly told Mingfang: If it were a younger brother, I&#39;m afraid your parents wouldn&#39;t have so much time to spend on you. You should study hard. When her mother was pregnant, Mingfang&#39;s unpleasant feeling was a spark. After hearing her aunt&#39;s words, the spark touched the air and completely ignited. The gender of the fetus is a choice between two choices. People always have to choose between one of the two. Fifty percent is luck or risk, hard to say. Mingfang is worried about herself, and even more worried about her mother. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;My mother gave birth before the winter vacation, and Mingfang transferred to another school at this time. Dad&#39;s salary, mother&#39;s energy, and the space of the rental house seemed to always be enough for three people. If there was one more person, Mingfang would end up in the same place. However, even if you can finish junior high school, if you don&#39;t have a hukou in H City, you have to go back to your hometown to study in high school, change a set of textbooks, and write a different set of test papers to take the college entrance examination. This day will definitely come, but it’s just ahead of time. Before leaving, her deskmate gave her a set of &quot;Unsolved Mysteries of the World&quot;. He said she should read it as a novel, it was very interesting. On the day after the exam, Mingfang told him that she might not come to school next semester. He nodded steadily, because Mingfang had warned him about his future since his mother was pregnant. For this purpose, he specially prepared loose-leaf student records in advance, took out one sheet for Mingfang to write on, and then took out another sheet for himself to write on. The one in his hand was his contact information and message. He wrote: Never be sad about separation. People who want to meet can always meet. He is a man of great confidence, and is far more interested in things past and future than in the present. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;3.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Mom and dad are a bonding alliance, but when gender comes to the fore, the alliance collapses . At her sister&#39;s full-moon banquet, no one teased Mingfang with words like &quot;brother&quot;. Instead, they advised Mingfang&#39;s father very sensibly, saying: It doesn&#39;t matter if it&#39;s a daughter, it&#39;s the same with daughters. The father was persuaded not to look at his sleeping sister, but to drink heavily. He couldn&#39;t even squeeze out a perfunctory smile when he saw Mingfang, and asked mechanically: Are you full? There was a banquet in the yard, and the cook who was &quot;happy to the door&quot; was a smiling, fat young man. He was too big. He stood at the gate of the yard drinking fruit oranges and blocked Mingfang&#39;s path. Mingfang walked around her, ignored her father, and walked around. A large circle of smoke created by the men&#39;s communication entered the house. My mother was holding her sister and sitting on the bench in front of the hall. When she saw Mingfang coming in, tears welled up in her eyes. There were red envelopes, gift cards, cigarettes and wine stacked on the Eight Immortals table, and my sister&#39;s diapers, milk powder, and baby bottles were piled on the bed in the room. Mingfang put down her schoolbag and walked over to take a look at her sister. It was wet and cold in the winter, and the heater was turned on very loudly. The blowing made parts of her body hot, but her body was cold. She was very small, with a red face, and fell asleep with her mother&#39;s nipple in her mouth. Today is not a celebration for her, but a gift from her. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Dad finished smoking and went into the house. Mom got up and put her sister on the bed, pulled off her clothes, covered her chest, and finally tore and beat her father: Do you really want your son that much? Who are you showing your face to? Dad glanced at Mingfang, lowered his head, and said: No more, I don’t have that life. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;It turns out that giving birth to a daughter means accepting your fate. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;After confinement, Mingfang’s mother hugged her sister and got on the bus to the county seat. Her grandmother did not give up persuading Mingfang’s mother, telling her to go back later and take good care of her body until her sister is older. Mom shook her head and said to grandma: You don’t know how many stores like this are around where you live, and it’s hard to guard against them. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Mingfang knew what kind of store it was. A woman sat in front of a narrow door knitting a sweater or crocheted slippers, squatting on the ground and eating watermelon. When her mother walked past her, she ran and pulled her flip-flops away from their toes and the other four. Mingfang lowered her head and saw that the meaning was unclear. tattoo with cigarette burn scars. The proprietress of the canteen downstairs came here from her hometown just to guard against these shops. She said: If this guy hadn&#39;t been unconscious and I would have stayed at home to study with him, my son wouldn&#39;t have failed to pass the high school entrance exam. Her husband was sipping wine and smiling, as if the &quot;chasing&quot; and &quot;preventing&quot; between husband and wife were natural. For him to be easy-going on this matter makes his wife appear to be mean and rude. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Mingfang’s mother told her grandma: Do you think he doesn’t want to? During this period of my pregnancy... grandma interrupted in time: “Don’t say a few words, your life will never be so good. The car is here, let’s go.” Bar. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Her mother couldn’t move her hands in her arms, so she asked Mingfang to take the money from her pocket. She said: If you want to buy anything, just go to the county and buy it yourself. Be good and be obedient. Qian Mingfang never spent any money. During that time, she often woke up early in the morning and looked at the rafters, not knowing where she was, let alone what she needed to buy. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The few steps from grandma&#39;s house to school in H City have not yet detoured from the alleyway where Mingfang lives. After a short journey, grandma asked Wenjie, who lived next door, to come with her. Grandma was afraid of dogs and gangsters begging for money on the road. Wenjie and Mingfang were in the same class, and there were not many people there. Children of the same age from several nearby villages were all in the same class. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The year before last, when Wenjie went back to his grandmother’s house for the Chinese New Year, Wenjie was not as tall as Mingfang. His cheeks and nose were so chapped because he didn’t apply moisturizer. He wore earmuffs, and when he took them off, he saw frostbite on his ears. City H has a strict entrance age limit. Mingfang&#39;s birthday at the end of the year was a year late for school. Although he was in the same grade, he seemed older and more generous than Wenjie. Mingfang handed him chocolates through the courtyard door. Speaking in Mandarin, he declined for a long time before accepting it with an embarrassed look on his face. He turned around and went into the room to pick out two packs of Mosu Candy as a gift in return. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;After it was decided that Mingfang would study at home, Wenjie came more frequently. He had grown taller and was not ashamed to speak his &quot;local dialect&quot;. In his opinion, Mingfang was originally like a guest. , Mingfang, who is from H City, has become ordinary. In the yard of Wenjie&#39;s house, there was a bamboo rocking chair placed under the shade of the eaves. Across the low courtyard wall, Wenjie lay on it and looked up and down at Mingfang without hesitation. On the way to school, Wenjie showed extra enthusiasm, bragging, boasting, and giving advice, which every boy seemed to automatically master when he got older. In his description, his father was already powerful and omnipotent in the construction industry in H City. He lifted up his trousers and showed Mingfang the check mark on his shoes that indicated his identity. I have never eaten pork, but Mingfang has seen pigs running around. The color of the shoes, the position and wiring of the check marks are completely fake. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;People working outside the whole village are trying their best to save water, electricity, oil and rice. Just like the ancients carried dry food on their backs when marching, they carried the support from their parents in the fields at home, which can save wages. To get to the east and west, wait at the entrance of the village for the minibus to the county seat, then transfer to the bus from the county seat to the city, take the subway, go through security check, wait for the bus, and finally move to your residence. At the end of the year, I just go back and dress up during the New Year days. At other times, Wenjie couldn&#39;t see it, but Mingfang could. Mingfang couldn&#39;t help but ask: Have you been to the place where your dad works? Wenjie showed a disappointed look and said, &quot;I&#39;ve never been there. What&#39;s the matter? None of our classmates have been there.&quot; Mingfang said: Have you ever thought about why your dad doesn’t want you to go? Wenjie seemed to understand something, Mingfang cut off his words and remained silent on the road. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Wenjie’s father was also brought out to work by Mingfang’s father. When he first came to work in H city, the old house in his family fell down, and the new house was built on an empty shelf. There was no paint or furniture, and he still owed some money. money. Wenjie&#39;s father saves money and skips lunch. Everyone saves money, but those who eat will laugh at those who skip lunch for no reason. Mingfang&#39;s mother couldn&#39;t stand it, so she gave him the leftovers that she couldn&#39;t sell. Mingfang&#39;s father sneered and said to his mother: He is just a pickpocket, and you can make a lot of money every penny, so don&#39;t take advantage of him. Later, Mingfang saw Wenjie&#39;s father standing at the door of the bank, counting money, stacking stacks of money, and depositing them into the ATM machine. The day before returning home for the Chinese New Year, Wenjie&#39;s father put on a refurbished down jacket and a red tie on the bus on the return trip. The woolen vest on top of his shirt was neatly ironed. He smoked when he saw people in the village. At the end of the vacation, he touched cement and steel bars with his hands, put on his Jiefang shoes, and still skipped lunch. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;He will not let his son Wenjie and other family members know. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The dialect of H City took away Mingfang’s Mandarin, which also caused her to be unable to return to the “dialect” of her hometown. Standing on the podium of the new classroom, she just introduced herself a few words, and the audience booed her. one slice. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The students here seem to be more mature. The underwear popular in this small area and suitable for girls who have just grown up has two ropes overlapped around the neck and knotted in place. Mingfang looked at the cotton string and felt a pair of hands gently squeezing her throat. The boys would reach out and untie the two elastic ropes, which was met with screams and laughter. Mingfang had a premonition that they would become her parents or the canteen proprietress and her husband when they grow up. Sometimes they pull and fight, and all the mistakes end up in ambiguous words and eyes, and the days go on in confusion. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;明芳刚转来的几个星期，最愿意上的只有微机课。很简单的office操作，她小学就学过，很快完成课堂任务后，她从来不理会没做完任务的同学求助，剩余时间自顾自地、翻来覆去地进同桌的QQ空间。他们俩对话框的聊天记录停留在一个星期前，同桌发来自己养的叫&amp;ldquo;忍者&amp;rdquo;的乌龟照片，还说过两天爸妈休年假，和家人去日本旅游，要给明芳寄来明信片，他询问明芳地址，明芳没好意思把自己家某村某组的家庭住址发送过去，写了自己学校和班级。下周上微机课，明芳看到同桌回复：太迟了，已经回家了！没有邮戳，明信片没意思，等周末我给你寄点吃的东西吧！有如此时差，隔天明芳就收到了一盒巧克力饼干，门卫送到班上，盒子上印了很多白色的小雪花和日文&amp;ldquo;白い恋人&amp;rdquo;，她在班里拆开，同学们指着恋人两字大惊小怪，问：你男朋友是H市人？明芳高兴又虚荣。他们就这样像写信一样聊天，直到某天，同桌发来的信息变成了&amp;ldquo;性感荷官在线发牌&amp;rdquo;，再没联系上。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;4.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;妹妹周岁过完没多久，明芳的爸妈离婚了。外公做完工回来，抬脚就朝爸爸小腿踹，厉声骂：你是想找别的女人给你生儿子是吧！妈妈哭着说&amp;ldquo;&amp;rdquo;就是！少瞒我，我有什么不知道，为了小孩跟你熬，我都没提，你哪来的脸。明芳爸爸垂着头，泄了气一般坐在门槛上，低声说：这是一方面&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;哪有男的&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;算了，跟你讲不清，离了好，我欠债了。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;准备迎接儿子的爸爸，一年前斗志昂扬，又找了更多人，承包了工程，可活干到一半，企业资金出问题，工程款不到位，钱没赚到，工资又发不出来。中午放学，刚进家门的明芳听见爸爸对妈妈说：离婚吧，没有钱给你，债算我的，两清。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;妈妈抱着妹妹和明芳哭，没吃午饭，但离了婚。那天以后，不愿让明芳一人留守的妈妈，把更小的妹妹放在了外公外婆身边。她进县里的玻纤厂干活，给双职工的家庭烧饭、做钟点工，没问爸爸要过抚养费。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;下午上学，哭了一中午的明芳觉得光线太强，在自己眼皮上一排排地踩踏。文杰在楼道口就堵住了她：怎么了，怎么哭了。明芳闻到他头油的臭味，厌恶地推开，走进教室。明芳从未比那时更期待课间眼保健操到来，她需要闭上双眼，放松双眼。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;在挤按睛明穴的那节，闭着双眼的明芳感觉到什么东西顺着自己的头发往脖颈处爬，还有轻微的痛痒，她伸手一摸竟摸到冰凉的皮肉，她以为是虫子，就想弹开，没想到这东西远比明芳以为的要大和结实。明芳感觉到自己的脖子在拉扯中破了，伸手拽了下来。在眼保健操的音乐中，明芳惊吓尖叫，扰乱了节奏。她从凳子上蹿起来，转过身，背对黑板，坐第一排的她，发现所有人都在笑，唯独她流着眼泪，被她拽落的，是一条蛇，现在躺在地面上一动不动。明芳的眼睛还是肿的，睁不开，几秒后害怕理应消失，可她太难过了，想逃避就闭上眼，身体被眼睛和心情牵连，不可控地倒在了地面上。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;明芳醒来，看见自己躺在家里的床上，身边有碗和米，还有一块红布。外婆说：你被吓着了。明芳说：文杰把蛇扔在我身上。外公说：已经上门骂过了，是假蛇，软塑料的，他爸不在家管不着他，爷爷奶奶拿了吃的来道过歉了。外公指了指床边放的旺旺大礼包。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;休息了几天，再回去上课，明芳不想闻教室里的怪味：韭菜馅的锅贴、猪肉馅的包子、油很大的麻球糍粑。明芳把电风扇的挡位开大一档，驱赶气味，但坐在吊扇下的同学不同意，他们相信吊扇年久失修，风速加快会带来吊扇坠落的风险。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;把你头旋出去，晓得吗，外地佬？ &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;久违地，明芳在家乡听到这三个字。明芳依然不会说&amp;ldquo;土话&amp;rdquo;，不愿意和文杰一样的男生多言语，不认为男生手贱的捉弄可以表达爱意。所以她是&amp;ldquo;外地佬&amp;rdquo;。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;那时明芳还不知道，全国各地都有讨薪欠薪的事故，多少人因为拿不到工资而失望、丧命。爸爸是被别人欠、被骗，也亏欠别人，腹背受敌。他卡住了，就像明芳的普通话，明芳在班里的局面。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;文杰告诉同学，明芳是为了骗他家送来的慰问品吃才装作被吓晕的。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;你们都晓得，这条假蛇，我吓了班上多少女生了，她们怎么没事，就她逼事多呢。 &amp;rdquo;明芳听到文杰说，随后是其他人的附和。明芳的外号由&amp;ldquo;外地佬&amp;rdquo;又加了一个&amp;ldquo;好吃佬&amp;rdquo;。从文杰坐在凉椅上打量明芳那刻起，就充满危险。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;他们中的很多人，父母在H市打工，被欠着工钱，过年没能回家，或者回家了，买不来年货。砖匠、瓦匠、保姆、保安，拆解出来的家人们缩在H市小小的阁楼里生活，迷失在H市的地铁站、汽车站、火车站，扛着蛇皮袋被挤来挤去，最后收获一枚嫌恶的眼神。家乡的孩子们收到了信号，是整座城市在羞辱他们的父母，而明芳是他们能接触到的，H市的唯一元素。在外面读了几年书有什么了不起，又不能在那考大学，说普通话也够装腔作势，H市不要明芳，她还无耻地靠上去。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;明芳很愤怒，想站在讲台上揭穿文杰冒牌的耐克，却发现自己脚上也是外婆乱买的假牌子，镇上的街道、小店充满了这样别扭的鞋服。明芳想说上一句&amp;ldquo;你轻狂什么啊，你爸爸连午饭都舍不得吃一口&amp;rdquo;，可明芳的爸爸，欠着他家账。明芳在心里朝对方挥了无数次拳，但每一拳都打在毫无底气的自己身上&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;我和他是一样的人，一样的家人，一样的处境。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;可是为什么，明明是一样的人，总在相互戕害，为什么，明芳在H市是外地人，在家乡也是。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;明芳要通过中考，去全县唯一一所高中，考上重点班，甩掉这帮注定要去到职高，或者尽完受教育义务就流向劳务市场的同学。她决心，回到H市，才会回到温和而沉稳的人身边。 H市扎伤过明芳，拒绝了明芳，嘲讽过明芳，但明芳与家人和同学最好的记忆都在那里。此刻，家乡糟糕透了，不宜久留。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;中考前，明芳的模拟考试不理想，她哭到值日生都离开教室，才往家走。房子后面是田，田背后是山，明芳不熟悉作物和树木的名称，只有山与田中间的小河，亲切而清澈。天已经黑尽，明芳被蚊虫叮咬，水声滔滔，明芳觉得人生不过如此。当河水冲过她的小腿，有个什么东西柔软地卡在了明芳脚下，是个破旧的布娃娃。她本来该有衣服的，但水流冲刷、河道漫长让她赤裸，她本该健康完整，但石子割穿了她的胸腹，翻出体内的填充物。她几乎空了，留下涤纶的、薄透的表皮。明芳捡起了她。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;5.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;妈妈先明芳一步回家，坐村里人的顺风车。妈妈这次来，是在向明芳求助。毕业后这三年，明芳在H市自给自足，但现在，家里需要她，妈妈能给她最大限度的支持，到此为止了。妈妈和舅舅两人轮班照料，还是没办法抵御死亡、病痛的威力。死亡胁迫老去的肉体，蚕食着年轻的耐心。明芳早做准备，退掉了房子和递了辞呈，决定去家乡的一个私立小学教书，那边很缺老师。 &amp;ldquo;过渡，再慢慢考个编制。 &amp;rdquo;负责招聘的领导这样对明芳说。她的确如此打算，无数人都做此打算。又是年关，明芳入职前，先过了教师的寒假。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;返乡的大巴车上混乱而拥挤。车里的人都已经不年轻了，他们背着巨大的行李，大巴车就格外拥挤。多少年了，明芳还是没能学会&amp;ldquo;土话&amp;rdquo;，但同乡们的交谈在&amp;ldquo;走调&amp;rdquo;，还有普通话、土话、H市的方言、抖音外放尖锐的笑声。明芳感到沮丧，今后，总有这些声响了。大巴车下了高速，天色渐渐暗下来，明芳不用打开手机地图，便知道快要到家了，手机里视频软件自动播放起教高考生填志愿的老师的话语：为什么报师范，现在出生率这么低，偏远地区今后能攒上几个鸟人？多少中小学要关门，看看韩国就知道了。路面不再平整，比从前好，但是永远跟不上。她闭上眼睛，睡不着，心和车同时颠簸。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;明芳接替妈妈照顾外婆，她才得空休息，明芳早起，屋里已全是红枣稀饭的香气，这是妈妈晚上提前煮好的，放在电压力锅中。以前，外婆也是这样给她准备早饭。她掀开锅盖等待冷却，此间隙站在院子里刷牙，她看文杰家屋檐下的躺椅已经不知所终，堂前挂起两张遗像。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;文杰穿着快递员的衣服，满脸倦容，应该是刚下夜班。他初中后没再读书，也无吹嘘的本钱&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;至少在明芳跟前。他又变成了那个比明芳小、没有明芳高的男孩，站在对面的院子里吸溜着鼻涕，手里攥着一根擦炮，看着穿新衣服回来的明芳，不愿意讲嘴里含着的&amp;ldquo;土话&amp;rdquo;。文杰匆忙地推门回家，没和明芳说话，连眼神交流都没有。在H市，她每天收到快递，都会诚恳地和陌生的快递员说&amp;ldquo;谢谢&amp;rdquo;。不知道为什么，明芳想起那晚沾着男人尿液的马桶圈，明芳希望他有着与文杰相似的脸，她竟然有了报仇的快感。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;县城终于开了一家肯德基，明芳掏钱，拉着妈妈和妹妹进去吃。妹妹无意间说：爸爸有时会来学校看她，隔着铁栅栏给她塞零食和红包。妈妈说：他还说什么了？妹妹说：问了姐姐在哪工作。妹妹没告诉爸爸明芳从H市回来，在学校当老师。明芳问妹妹为什么，妹妹吸着可乐说：他见我得塞钱，见你就要讨饭了，这点我还是拎得清的。离异、负债的爸爸，在H市晃了几年，还掉了债，没有儿子，念起旧来。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;明芳搬家那天按照同桌同学录上的地址去看了一眼，旧建筑、新校区、商厦很好地融合，不像当年混乱的状态。不过，在这样的秩序之下，应该挤不进任何一个如明芳这样的家庭了。树木繁茂，散步遛狗的行人步履缓慢，来来往往的多是老人家，明芳坐在石凳上和他们聊天，H市方言还没有忘，不过走了调。明芳提起同桌的名字。老人家讲：出国了，日本。他妈妈早年就是在日本留的学，多少年前的事情，他是高中就出去念书，早走掉了。明芳说：哦哦，再会啊再会。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;再会就是游客了，明芳在心里说。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;在H市漂泊、工作的人其实都是游客，满腹心事与牢骚，一周只能自由活动一天的游客。握着体验卡，盯着进度条，以为命运的齿轮会在自己的头顶失去精度，可惜进度条浮于显示器，外地人有一根插头，插在家乡的电站。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;外婆去世后，连下了一个星期的雨，好不容易等雨停了，妈妈翻出棉被、旧衣服和所有潮湿的东西，晒在院子里。阳光经过的棉被松软舒适，母女三人挤在一张床上睡觉说话。妹妹问明芳，大学和工作期间有没有恋爱。明芳说：没有，我有喜欢的人。妹妹从床上坐起来问，谁啊谁啊。明芳说：你不认识，你当时还没出生。她就又躺下了。妈妈问，什么时候的事情。明芳说：初一。去植物园那次，全班只有我晕车，老师说是我车坐少了。我同桌跟我说，没关系，这地方马上通地铁了，就算不晕车的人也不愿意坐大巴，它们总会被淘汰，没有活人去适应死物件的道理，大巴算什么，迈巴赫也不行。他把iPod的耳机分了一只给我，里面放着日本乐队的歌，他说听歌能分散注意力缓解晕车。我问他，歌的中文译名是什么，他说中文译作《蜉蝣》，第一句唱&amp;ldquo;想你的心情如同蜉蝣&amp;rdquo;，他看着我笑了一下。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;妹妹问，现在呢，现在明芳还喜欢吗。明芳裹紧了身上被子，没有回答。很多年之后，她才听到大学广播台在放熟悉的旋律，主持人用浮夸的播音腔说：将暗恋的情感比作蜉蝣，多么动人啊！她站在食堂入口，下课的同学从她身边涌过，众声喧哗，那首歌逆着风走。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;妹妹在等待的过程睡着了，明芳轻声说：喜欢，就像喜欢一种感觉，体面的、自由的、被尊重的感觉。后来我想，如果他成为丈夫、父亲，应该不会问医生，小孩&amp;ldquo;带把吗&amp;rdquo;。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;妈妈伸手抚摸她的脊背。睡吧，妈妈说。明芳阖上眼。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;冬日的村庄安静极了，万物都在低频地呼吸。窗外、田边、山与山的空隙之中，当年的河流转入枯水期，孱弱得像穿针的棉线，或许载不动破损的娃娃。时间改变了很多，又什么都没有，明芳想起曾有人这样说。忙碌地经营生活，奋力在林中路上砍去枝蔓，以为绕过了几重迷宫，其实多年的冲锋与前进，不过为自己蹚出一条退路，退与进，如天地平行。 &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>; &lt;/div>;
