When did you lose the desire to talk? &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Recently, I have fallen into a state of nothingness. I feel that life is absurd. My attitude towards work and life is becoming more and more like Camus&#39;s &quot;outsider&quot;, and I can&#39;t enter the drama at all. , and can no longer find the meaning of living. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I often wake up in the middle of the night and fall into a meaningless state. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;If it were in the past, I would definitely call my friends to talk to them. No matter what time it was in the middle of the night, I would definitely be able to find one or two people who were awake, and then I would wake them up to talk about life with me and help me. Get out of this meaningless state. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;However, now I suddenly found that I didn’t. I just watched this emotion spread there, and then waited for it to dissipate, then went to sleep quietly, and went to work very normally the next day. It was as if nothing had happened. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I suddenly found that I seemed to have no desire to talk. &lt;strong>;It was not that I had no friends worth talking to, but that I had lost the desire to talk. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Is this the case for you too? So, why? I think the reasons should be the following:&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;1. Know rationally the fundamental reasons behind the generation of emotions&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;We know what causes this emotion, and we also know clearly how to solve it, or it cannot be solved at all. &lt;strong>;We know very clearly what the result of talking to friends is, which is nothing more than the venting of emotions, so we lose the desire to talk to friends. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;2. Human beings’ joys and sorrows are not the same&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Those who can truly understand our feelings There are too few people, and we know very well in our hearts that we can’t get the feedback we need from our friends, or actually know what kind of feedback our friends will give us, and that is not what we want, so we naturally lose the opportunity to talk. desire. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;3. Don’t want to add burden to others&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;As our experience increases, we clearly understand the lives of those around us &lt;strong>;We have become more and more cautious about dumping negative energy, and we don’t want to affect others who already have low energy because of our unhappiness. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;What kind of pressure puts young people into this state of emptiness? &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;1. Don’t want to refer to the lifestyle of the previous generation&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;There is this in &quot;Destiny&quot; by Mr. Cai Chongda In a sentence: &lt;strong>;&amp;ldquo;Living for others is actually the simplest way to live.&amp;rdquo; &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Indeed, we observe the people around us, our previous generation, and even the previous generation, their way of living is to live for others, the most common ones are young people When you are young, you live for your sons and daughters. When you get old, you start living for your grandchildren. But this way of living can no longer be recognized by young people, and we have begun to look for our own way of life. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;2. It is easy to live for others, but too difficult to live for yourself&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;When we really When I started to stop living for others and started to look for my own way of life, I discovered that it is really easy to live for other people&#39;s requirements, for parents, bosses, teachers... at least we will do it every day Knowing exactly what we should do, although it is just filled with the trivial matters of life and has nothing to do with happiness, at least we have a very clear goal. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;But living for yourself requires very high energy. One of the more popular sayings nowadays is:&lt;strong>;What is success? Just spend your life the way you like. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;But ask today’s young people, within their own capabilities, what is their preferred method? Few people can answer it. &lt;strong>;So most young people are at this crossroads. On the one hand, they do not want to live a defined life, but on the other hand, they do not have the ability to define their own life. So we are confused, empty, and at a loss as to what to do. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;3. Unable to balance one’s own desires and abilities&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In &quot;A Brief History of Today&quot; , Yuval said: This is a world where information is exploding but mostly useless, and clear insights become a power. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In this era where self-media is developed and it is too easy to obtain information, fragmented reading often brings out-of-context insights. Do we really have the ability to distinguish? &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;This era has given us a lot of freedom, but if we don’t have a strong enough core, the more we know and the more choices we have, the easier it will be to be impetuous and lost. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I saw a speech by writer Mai Jia before. His first novel &quot;Decryption&quot; was rejected 17 times, which took 11 years. He said: I want to be an &quot;old&quot; person in this &quot;everyday new and fast&quot; world, a person who insists on ideals. When others are rushing forward, I want to be an &quot;old&quot; person. Stand aside to avoid being swept away by the torrent of time. I think this is probably the calmness that the younger generation lacks. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;The world is big, but the space we need is actually very small. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;/p>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;Editor in charge: Zhou Ziheng onewenzhang@wufazhuce.com&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For information on the call for papers, please see @ONE Studio’s pinned Weibo.

If interviews are treated as spring outings, can the world become a playground? &lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;On February 14, 2023, I came to Guangzhou and defected to Acan. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;It only takes 3 stops from arriving at the airport at 10pm to her home. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Acan is a friend I met in Beijing. I rented the single room next door to hers. It was 6 square meters and very cramped. It was about the width of my split. On the other side was the bathroom. Hearing the sound of every tenant peeing, no windows, no sunlight, 1,100 yuan per month. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;She was also poor at that time. She had a dozen or so credit cards to pay for, and her job changed every three months, but there was nothing she could do for a long time. When I get out of the subway after get off work in the evening, I will buy honey-roasted sweet potatoes and spicy duck necks to come back to have some cheap and easy happiness. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Later we left Beijing one after another. She raised a cat named Zhaocai, a very clever cat. Her life gradually got better and she was able to help her friends around her. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;This time I came to Guangzhou, it was her invitation. Guangzhou has a subtropical monsoon climate, with plenty of light and heat, and long summers. You don’t need to buy expensive and heavy winter clothes. A homeless person can get by just lying on the ground. It’s great, so I came here. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I went for an interview the day after I landed. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The first one is in Panyu, which is quite far away. It takes two hours by subway and bus. While riding in the car, I searched for the company name on Xiaohongshu and found some lightning protection posts, which made me want to quit. Discuss with HR whether you should cancel the interview because the distance is too far and commuting every day is impractical. He said he was here, let’s talk. &quot;It&#39;s all here.&quot; It&#39;s indeed a panacea, I&#39;ll take it! &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The job content is to write articles for Kuaishou anchors, 11 a.m. to 8 a.m., single day off, probation period 3-6 months, salary 12k, 20% off during the probation period. I said I wouldn’t accept the 20% discount, the 6-month trial period, or the five social insurances and one housing fund during the trial period. He wouldn’t accept me. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The next company is also in Panyu, recruiting investment for an unmanned billiards hall, and asked me to do IP incubation and copywriting output, with a salary target of 12-20k. There are only a few people in the office, and it smells like a small workshop that can run away at any time. The boss is a man. He may have studied for two years. He speaks very fast and pops out two English words from time to time. After chatting for a long time, he realized that recruiting a copywriter is to create personal accounts for dozens of employees in the company. Every one! indivual! people! Later, we will also create accounts for franchisees. I am an honest person, and I would rather believe that I was responsible for the launch of Chang&#39;e-6. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Finally, I was asked to evaluate my suitability for this position and think of an answer for him. I couldn&#39;t help but ask: What is our basic salary? His fierce fighting rooster-like arrogance finally calmed down at this moment: 6-8. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I kept smiling and picked up my mobile phone that was charged to 70% here: I understand, I will consider giving you a reply. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;After the interview, I went to find the restroom and saw a construction company called &quot;Qiang Sheng&quot; in the building. The sequelae of &quot;Cyclone&quot; immediately broke out: It is indeed my hometown of Brother Qiang, who focuses on a big business and flourishing branches. Mao, the centipede insect is dead but not stiff. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Afterwards, HR asked me how the conversation went. I wanted to ask her: Is your boss really mentally normal? Do you want to take some Chinese medicine to adjust it? &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Click on the boss to report, select &quot;Fake Salary&quot;, and pass. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The schedule on February 16th was busy and I interviewed four companies. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The first one was in Yuexiu, an advertising and creative company that engaged in full-scale marketing. It&#39;s quite old-school. There is a tall and slender beauty in uniform on the first floor who is responsible for checking the door control. In the elevator, the men are in suits and leather shoes, and the women are full of fragrance. The store I am in front of has Wong Lo Kat upstairs and GF Securities downstairs. Presumably as a sandwich, it can&#39;t be too bad. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;We have weekends off, and the salary is negotiable. I heard that I occasionally work overtime, and I had a great time chatting with the leader. After I finished, I told him to send the written test questions to my email, and if there was no problem, I would arrange a final meeting with the big boss. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;When I was hesitating whether to have lunch nearby or go to Haizhu to catch the next show, I received a call from a first-class public institution jointly run by the National Health Commission and a biotechnology company. It had weekends off and the salary was 12- 15. Food and accommodation are provided, and six insurances and one fund are paid according to civil servant standards. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Sounds good, the HR said, &quot;Are you married?&quot; Do you have any plans to have children in the past two years? &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;No, no. But head down. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Ask me what do you value in the workplace? &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I talked about work content, salary and direct leadership. I say that direct leadership determines 80% of the happiness of a job. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Thanks to me for talking so much, there is also a bright person there: I have to say something in advance, this job requires dealing with two superiors, and the number of revisions will be relatively high? &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I am mentally prepared: What does this mean? Two or three times? &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Him: Maybe five or six times. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Me: Do I need every draft? &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Him: Yes. Is this OK with you? &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I took a deep breath: OK, I had to connect three operations before, that’s understandable. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Him: Okay, we will finalize a time for the supervisor to arrange an offline interview with you. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Hang up. Reviewing this phone call, it feels like a compliance test. He was paid to turn each question into four words: Can you bear it? Can you bear it? Can you bear it? &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I said yes, but I also know that a conceptual yes may have to be repaid with countless moments of wanting to die when revising the draft in the future. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The third one is in Haizhu. The office building is ostentatious, just like Zhang Yuqi&#39;s part in Stephen Chow&#39;s &quot;The Mermaid&quot;, with a style made of money, style and the expensive fragrance of luxury goods. The female staff who guided guests on the first floor had a neat hairstyle and a neat bun. After taking my identity information and visiting the floor, she returned my ID card to me and kept smiling the whole time. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;A-Chan and I expressed our shock: they actually used a ladder system and could only reach certain floors. The elevator doesn&#39;t even have a button. It turns out that you can only get in by swiping your face. It&#39;s so advanced. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;This restaurant is a tea shop, and the boss maintains a privilege consistent with the style of the building. I was having a lively chat with my supervisor when he suddenly appeared: You go and send the suppliers, and I will be there to recruit people from now on. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The supervisor walked away angrily. I&#39;m going to introduce myself again. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;He looked at my resume: Which one is on the hot search list? Can you still find it? Turn it out and take a look. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I turned it over to him. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;He finished reading it casually, and then asked: Which of these tens of millions of readers is it? &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I showed it to him. It was a collection with the theme of &quot;boredom&quot; because I was bored at home during the epidemic. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Him: So you just found a bunch of &quot;boring&quot; things and made a &quot;boring&quot; collection, right? &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Having said that, I couldn&#39;t help it: That&#39;s it, the supervisor just said that the basic salary is 8. If this is the case, there may be no need to talk. I expect it to be xx. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Him: Before tax and after tax? &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Me: Got it. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Him: Who is the supervisor? &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Me: Wasn’t that the one just now? &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;He sneered: No. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;You see, this man doesn’t just look down on me, he looks down on everyone equally. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Very mean, pass it hard. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The fourth one is in Baiyun. The environment is relatively simple, which is in sharp contrast to the previous one selling tea. I went there and waited. The interview registration form was full of control, photography, editing, and directing. The live broadcast room was still under construction. There was an atmosphere of starting from scratch and expanding online recruitment. I understood the significance of this trip and skillfully handed my phone to the front desk. Charge. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;It turns out that the Kuaishou anchor wants to get a matrix account. The supervisor asked me how to set up a plot for two girls, one beautiful and one handsome. I blurted out: Let them form CP. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The supervisor frowned, puzzled. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I have to add: Do you know Sun Yining? &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;She shook her head. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I rose to the challenge: Do you know &quot;Chen Qing Ling&quot;? &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Her brows tightened. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I bite the bullet: It’s just Danmei, a lot of little girls fall into this trap. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;She finally found her home court: Our target group is mothers in their thirties and forties in fourth-tier cities. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Please tell me: I didn’t know this configuration before I came here. I will look for the benchmark account when I go back and send it to you for reference. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;She agreed. I took my mobile phone with a long battery life and took pictures of the paddy fields in the south, the huge banana trees and the sunset at six o&#39;clock in the evening on the way back. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;We will fight again on Friday. The first one is a milk powder seller in Baiyun District. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;On the way there, I had to take a bus. I saw two homeless people buying a house in the green belt. It is difficult for office workers to have such leisure at this point. Once again I feel that coming here is a wise decision! &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;With the fearless spirit of &quot;I&#39;ll sleep in the green belt at worst&quot;, I filled in the astronomical price of 20k in the expected salary column of the registration form. If you dare to mark it, I dare to write it, focusing on a two-way fraud. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Chat with HR first, he doesn’t understand very well. We also found the project manager, a gloomy boy with long hair. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;He looked at my resume carefully and said: We work alone here. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Me: I know, I knew it before coming here. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;He wants to confirm: What is your expected salary? &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I said: Oh, that’s right, I have a price for weekend breaks and a price for single breaks. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;He kept talking about my resume and asked: You have worked on many projects, why do you have no management experience? I think you have this ability. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I said that although I have a rich resume, my formal work experience after graduation is actually only two years. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;He showed me the account numbers, the boss ladies who are constantly striving to improve themselves, the official accounts with bleak data, and the matrix accounts with equally bleak data. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I showed him the work I had taken before. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Him: You are very good and have great development potential. Normally I would not say more about this, but there is still a gap between your current stage and your expected salary. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;No, don’t take it seriously. Don’t you bargain? &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;But I am stubborn: Can we give it here? &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;He started to give an official statement: If the ability is good, it will not be a big problem. The boss is from the Northeast and is relatively generous. His concept is that the money everyone earns should be shared with everyone. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I am also official: Yes, it’s really good. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;A happy end to the conversation and a happy farewell. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I met a man with short sleeves in the elevator, pushing a dining cart. The eldest sister next to him scolded him: Everyone else wears windbreakers, but you wear short sleeves. The eldest brother has a distinct accent: Anyway, I’m from the Northeast and I’m not afraid of the cold. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I forgot to press the elevator button and missed the floor. My elder brother said: It feels like you are going to our company, but I haven’t seen you before. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I said it’s okay, I’ll just get off next time. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I watched him park on the 17th floor and push the dining cart out, which was the floor where the restaurant where I was interviewing was located. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The afternoon scene was more dramatic, and it was a vicious response to the wage-based theory of finding a job. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The two of us went through a few tricks on the recruitment website first, and it was my fault that I was too inexperienced to detect the scam. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Hr: Can you accept this work location? &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;This is actually the basics of greeting, and Baiyun can go anywhere. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I can. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Is it okay if I say I have no relevant experience in the auto parts industry? &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;She said yes. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I had lingering fears about the previous ones that said, &quot;The operation is as fierce as a tiger, and the basic salary is 6-8.&quot; This time I took the initiative and said: What is my expected salary? Balabala, can you see if there is an interview? necessary. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;She is more arrogant than me: If I bid, it’s true. You don’t have to come if you don’t want to come. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I said don’t be angry, I am afraid of being deceived, you wait for me to come and I will appoint you. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Who knows who can send me to the wilderness? It is no exaggeration to say that there are mountains not far away and wild dogs in the deserted villages nearby. I got off the car and wanted to escape. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Send a message to the driver: I don’t feel good, don’t care, let’s talk first. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The little brother replied instantly: Okay, okay, I can come back to pick you up later. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;What happened next confirmed how accurate my first feeling was: Run away! &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Hidden in a large and deserted factory area is a not so deserted office. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;As soon as I entered, the elder sister held the computer and asked me to copy the information to save time when the CEO interviewed me later. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Hey, CEO, it’s such a grand event, let me copy it! &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Then she took me to the conference room and introduced a dark, short, middle-aged bald man: This is our CEO. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Giao, my overbearing president’s lifelong belief has been impacted. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I explained my resume and works to the CEO in front of the computer. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The CEO only cares about what my family does. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I laughed: Just an ordinary family. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Him: He must be very rich. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I don’t laugh anymore. If I have money, can I work out? He said coldly: This has nothing to do with work. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I took pictures of the factory environment to my brother, and he gave me fifty yuan without saying a word: I wanted to buy a cup of milk tea to soothe my psychological trauma. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The summary of this interview is: some clumsy pretentious behavior by a rich man from the urban-suburban fringe of Baiyun District pretending to be the Secretary-General of the United Nations. Looking back at Sister HR&#39;s words &quot;You don&#39;t have to come if you don&#39;t want to come&quot;, it&#39;s not the anger of a righteous man being insulted, but more like the anger of being exposed to the truth. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;After three days of intense interviews, the weekend came. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;My classmates sent me condolences and recommended some well-known local FMCG companies for my reference. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;We talked about the job market we are facing. For women with liberal arts majors, even if they have a master&#39;s degree, they are not as popular as men with a bachelor&#39;s degree. It really makes people look bad. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;It will be dark until Monday. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;A-Chan asked me if I had met anyone I liked, and I said no. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The schedule began to become empty, and I only had to make one trip a day. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;On Tuesday, I ran to a tonic store in Liwan. Near the end of the bus, there were only two people left on the bus. We got off the bus together and took out our mobile phones to navigate. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I spoke first: Are you here for an interview too? &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I showed her the mobile phone page, and she showed me the mobile phone page, oh! We are in the same company and in the same position. I know you are not short of people, but do you have to pay attention to this peak shift? &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;We went there together and interviewed separately. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I told her: You finish the interview first and you wait for me. I finish the interview first and I wait for you. Let’s go together and have a meal together. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;She nodded sharply. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The person who met me was a handsome young man with matching rings on his fingers and asked me where I was from. I said where. He actually knew that his mother was also from there. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;He is knowledgeable and asks very professional questions, such as how to improve the 5s completion rate, 2s bounce rate, and how to optimize the picture and plot. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;But I don’t understand. Asking such a deep question almost makes me confused. I can only bite the bullet and talk about some things that are big and empty on paper, and then turn to the customer: Can you show me your matrix account? &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;He couldn’t take it, so he said sheepishly: It was taken by our partner’s wife, and the data is average. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I understood and looked at each other with a smile. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The good news is that the boss lady ended up engaging in new media. How can she not be self-improvement? &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The bad news is that when the boss lady intervenes in new media, how can she not be regarded as an outsider managing an expert? &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I finished chatting here first, waited at the door for a while and decided to go to the toilet first. When I came back, the girl disappeared. The passages in the building extend in all directions, and I waited for a long time without seeing anyone. I regretted not adding a WeChat account just now so that I could contact him. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;While waiting for the bus at the bus stop, she always harbored the hope that she would be able to wait here. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I am worried that she is still waiting for me somewhere, and I am also worried that she will think that I am not trustworthy and have not waited for her. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;This feeling of missing out lasted until I finished my meal and sat on a bench holding a cone, next to a purple-haired grandma pushing a vegetable basket. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;She tilted her head towards me and said: Pretty girl, you are so beautiful. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I held up the ice cream and said blankly: Ah, thank you! &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Grandma: You have beautiful skin and a beautiful figure. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Me: Maybe I don’t get enough sun. Your hair color is also beautiful. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Grandma is sure: No, this is innate. Are your parents pretty too? &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;A straight shot makes me unable to resist, but my identity outside the home is given by myself. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I said: My mother is as good-looking as my father. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Grandma: Do you have any brothers or sisters? &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I started to make up random things: I have a sister. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Grandma: Is she as beautiful as you? &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I am shameless: No, I am the most beautiful in the whole family. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The bus took grandma away, and I sat there eating ice cream, feeling better no matter what. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Feeling that the subway was crowded and depressing, I got off at a random stop, picked up a bicycle and rode, and unexpectedly saw the Pearl River. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Yuexiu District, the central city, is adjacent to the Pearl River to the south and Baiyun Mountain to the north. I think this place is good. I opened the boss and found a nearby company to invest in. I found this place today and called it a day and went home. . &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;On Wednesday, we welcomed our old friends and went to Panyu again. This time it went directly to the terminal of Line 3, Panyu Square. It’s also where I ended up. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I looked for a place along the route given by HR, but I got sidetracked once and almost was late. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;This time it was a very pleasant conversation in every sense of the word. I talked directly with the supervisor. After chatting for an hour and a half, she directly told me where to rent a house. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Finally, when we talked about salary, she said that my authority here was xx, and if it was OK, I could make an offer on the spot. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Actually, I have been moved. I mentioned my prejudice earlier - 80% of the happiness in a job is determined by the direct superior. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I think in the same position, women need to be more capable than men to reach management level. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;And when working under a female boss, you often just need to do your job well. Male bosses, on the other hand, often have to endure overflowing male egos outside of work. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I feel really connected with her. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;But I stabilized my shaky psychological defense: But I expected it to be xx. Adding more information, &quot;Before I came here, I looked at the job requirements here and compared them one by one. I found that every one of them corresponded. Everyone has relevant experience. The matching is indeed very high. I also had a great time chatting with you. I sincerely hope to have the opportunity.&quot; Opportunities to work together. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;She took a step back: This way, you make a plan to start the number and give it to me on Friday. I will use this to help you talk to the big boss. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;When saying goodbye, she walked me to the elevator entrance and pointed out the window: We usually rent a house there. There are supermarkets and vegetable markets nearby. There are many people and it is relatively safe. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I thanked him and said I would go take a look now. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;After wandering around the area, I disappeared into the crowded subway crowds and took advantage of the starting station, heading to Tiyuxi, Jiahe Wanggang, and all the way to Baiyun. After arriving at the community, I didn&#39;t go back directly to my residence. I climbed up to the rooftop in one go. Only one of the moon&#39;s teeth poked out. The sky was like a purple mousse cake. There was a gentle breeze in the evening and I felt calm. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;This calmness collapsed at 7 o&#39;clock the next day. Since I had an interview appointment at 10 o&#39;clock in Huangpu District, I had to get up early to catch the morning rush hour. The death line 3 did not deceive me. It reminded me of being crowded in Beijing. The fear of two eggs being squeezed into pieces on the Batong Line, eggs. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;It’s just that the front of the seat is squeezed into the back and the back is in dire straits. The person with the seat is not necessarily happy. The expression is dull, the face is dull, the head is drooped, and it is drowsy. You simply can&#39;t use your skills to know people and accurately predict which station they are going to play. You just feel that none of them are ready to play. If a terrorist shows a bomb, they will not object: &quot;You can&#39;t blow it up.&quot; Blow it up, or don’t blow it up for me, I’ll blow it up.” &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Being squeezed together like this, I basically have no ideas. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;This time I am going to interview someone who has been revised five or six times and paid six insurances and one fund as a civil servant. There are many checkpoints to enter the office building. There is a door for every two steps and a card swipe for every three steps. I was actually meeting the FBI&#39;s delusion. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;When we arrived, we had to wait for half an hour for their director to hold a meeting and for the consultant to come to the door. I didn&#39;t clear out my inventory before I left the house, but waiting until I was so overwhelmed that my sphincter failed. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;While solving personal problems in the bathroom, HR called to greet: Ms. x just saw you walking out. Did you go to the bathroom? ! Are you feeling unwell? ! &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I thought there was no need to be so diligent, I was just going to take a shit. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Finally I met the legendary director, a greasy-headed and trendy guy. For details on his configuration, see the cricket guy who sells jade on Douyin. That’s the one. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;He asked me what I was doing during the gap period, and I said I started a business with my friends. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;What field he was talking about, I said supply chain. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;He asked why he quit, and I said his partner had gone abroad. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;He asked where he went, and I said Spain. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;He said that Spain is not high on the list of despised students studying abroad. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;It’s up to you to take care of people wherever they like. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Then there is the consultant, an exquisite woman wearing a silk scarf and a windbreaker with false eyelashes like spider sperm and crow&#39;s feet like spider webs. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;She cares about her business ability, and all the questions she asked are correct, but I have a gut feeling that this person is difficult to get along with, and it will be more difficult to get along with her. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;At the end of the day, I wanted to take the portfolio away. Printing cost me 12 yuan. As a result, the consultant said that I still want to use it, so I gave up. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;After interviewing with HR, I asked how it was going. I said it was not very good and I felt there was little hope. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;But this place is lush and green with trees. When you open the map, you will see that it is surrounded by high-tech industrial parks and there are shared bicycles on the trails. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I drove one car, feeling that I should not be too thin-skinned, so I sent a message: If I fail the interview, can you reimburse me for the printing fee? I originally planned to take it back and reuse it. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Hr replied quickly: This can be reimbursed even after this. Then transfer the money to me quickly. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I accept it, ride on the bicycle, the white skirt is flying, and the mood is also. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The bicycle climbed slowly uphill and then fell rapidly. On the lawn beside the river, young men and women spread out flower mats and sat around for a picnic. The trees were large and lush, and a few beams of sunshine came through. After a while, a thought suddenly popped into my mind: the world is a playground. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;My thoughts suddenly opened up. I spent a week visiting Yuexiu, Baiyun, Panyu, Haizhu, Huangpu, Liwan, Tianhe, and almost all the districts in Guangzhou; I visited magnificent office buildings and strayed into the wilderness. Ridge; there were those who got to the bottom of the problem and asked about the blank period, and there were those who lightly exposed them; there were those who I answered seriously but were rejected because the style of writing was not in line with the tonality, and there were also offers that I dismissed as false and false. I refused for some reason; I squeezed through the crowded morning rush hour, and also took the bus where I was the only one. Sometimes I was so confident that I had to find someone who was sincere, and sometimes I just gave up and just forgot about it. It would be nice to have a job; I thought I have been an interviewer who rectified the job market, and I have also been a humble girl who worked hard; I have waited for the speeding subway, taken a leisurely bus, and measured the streets with my feet. If I regard these interviews as On a spring outing, isn’t the world just a playground? &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Anyway, I dare to poop before the interview, and I dare to ask for reimbursement. My current mentality is - whenever I think I am bound to die, I spread my cloak on the On the ground, I will sleep more and more soundly. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I sent the plan early on Friday morning and received a reply half an hour later: I can follow your request and hope to join the company as soon as possible. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The dust has finally settled. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;According to the invitation from the website, there are still three companies that have not met, one is a short video operation position in the home furnishing industry, one is a creative planner for FMCG beauty, and one is a general assistant. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I went as promised, mainly to satisfy the curiosity of some general assistants about why they came to me. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;When I was an intern at a marketing company in Beijing during my junior year, that cool girl who was skinny, wore European and American makeup, false eyelashes, dark eye shadow, and wore an oversize T formed all my imagination of the general assistant. I don’t understand how an aunt like me can always help. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I had the offer in hand. After chatting with the first company, I asked directly: Can you return my resume? This is my last resume, but there are still interviews below. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The supervisor kindly printed another copy for me. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The interviewer at the FMCG store was from a fellow villager and asked: Does my family agree with traveling so far? &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Me: At least in recent years, I still agree. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;We exchange an understanding smile. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The general assistant is really ridiculous. He gives written test questions as soon as he enters. They are some mathematical calculation questions that celebrities can give out to the top students. If I were still in elementary school, I would calculate them quickly, but Now I am a loser who has graduated from college three years ago. I can only guess. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I was said to be a general assistant, but in fact I was still engaged in business and projects. After my curiosity was satisfied, my 11-day interview trip to 13 companies across 6 districts came to an end, and I officially started work the next day. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I was 21 years old when I left Beijing in 2019. Acan and Xiaofei followed suit. Xiaofei said: &quot;Xiaoxia, you are coming to Beijing after graduation, and you will rent a house next door to us.&quot; We continued to be roommates. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I thought about it too, and said: Sister, please look forward to lighting me up. Next time, we will have windows all over the place with sunlight. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Now I am 24, in a place where the sun hardly ever comes off work. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Pang Bo had a very moving talk show: The moment before the cabin door closed, the stewardess said to the outside, &quot;Are there any more people going to Shanghai?&quot; I really heard a voice saying I want to When I went to Shanghai, I listened carefully and realized that it was my eighteen-year-old self. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;At the age of eighteen, I might not have imagined that I would end up where I wanted to be after the plane door closed many times. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Perhaps there will be some pedantic writers who feel sour grapes at this ending, but when I was riding a bicycle downhill that day, I firmly believed: the world is a playground, and there is no first-class cabin in heaven. &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;Editor-in-charge: Mei Butan&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Please see the @ONE studio pinned Weibo for information on the call for papers.
