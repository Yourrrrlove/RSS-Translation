Ten years ago today, &quot;I&quot; met my first love. The love and time of those years turned into a domineering and arrogant animal trap, tightly trapping part of &quot;my&quot; soul in place. &lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Ten years ago in the spring, I went to a small town called Jurong, Zhenjiang. I was eighteen years old that year - such a poetic age. This age is always juxtaposed with words such as ignorance, sprouting, rainy season, and first kiss. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;It was March, and I went to take the single-entry examination at a pheasant school. Unfortunately, the bus from Huai&#39;an to Jurong ran every two days at that time. The single-entry examination was on Wednesday, so I could only take the bus. The bus departs on Monday. My mom gave me money to stay in a hotel, and she told me to stay in the hotel for two days and not go anywhere. That was the first time I went out alone. The bus swayed for nearly five hours. When I arrived in Jurong, it was evening and the weather suddenly turned cold. Carrying my schoolbag, I was reluctant to take a taxi and walked out of the station. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;This is a small, solid town, and I walked to the center of the county in a few minutes. There is a stumbling stone road, with some businesses that are struggling to operate scrawled on the side, similar to reselling mobile phone cards, or selling cultural and sports supplies. There is a huge Hailan House on the street, and at the end of the road is a food court with fried rice, fried noodles and other stalls arranged in a circle. I walked around this circle three times and couldn&#39;t find what I wanted to eat. There is an Internet cafe in the corner of the food city called &quot;The Storm Rises Again,&quot; which should be &quot;The Storm Rises Again,&quot; but half of the neon sign with the word &quot;rising&quot; is broken. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;What a dilapidated scene. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The wooden stairs of the Internet cafe are narrow and shaky, which match the broken neon lights so well. I dove in and played League of Legends all night long. Around the second or third round, I met a brother from Hunan, and he said that I played very well. So we added friends and started a passionate duo queue. Finally, during a game in the early hours of the morning, I fell asleep on the sofa in a twisted posture. It was already noon when I woke up, and my back was sore from sleeping. I looked at the computer and saw that the Hunanese had already deleted me. Before deleting, he even insulted me for hanging up, saying, &quot;You stinky idiot&quot; and the like. Our friendship ends here. I&#39;m really sorry. I don&#39;t know if you reading this are from Hunan, but this incident has indeed caused me to be slightly biased against Hunanese. I think you can scold me, it must have been my fault first, but you can&#39;t delete me and prevent me from talking back. The only thing I know about him is that he is from Hunan. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;At that time, I had only eaten a bowl of instant noodles all night, but miraculously I had no appetite. After drinking a bottle of mineral water, I felt full of energy and walked from the center of the county to the school where I was about to take the exam. . It was a school that specialized in gardening, but the gardens in the school were in a mess. Chaos also has its advantages, that is, it can hide people. I have written many times before that the garden in our school has almost become a place for men and women to fall in love. It is dark and quiet. There is a saying in the school that &quot;even cooking wine and ginger cannot cover up the fishy smell in this garden.&quot; It is really not elegant to write this sentence, but not to write it down is a waste of the talent of the person who invented this sentence. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;While hanging out in school, I met my first friend in college, named Xunzi. Xunzi also came to take the single-entry exam. He arrived in Jurong at noon and came to the school in the afternoon to visit. We had dinner together, two portions of shredded pork fried rice, and he said, &quot;You pay first, and I&#39;ll pay it to you later.&quot; &amp;rdquo;Xunzi said this to me countless times in the following years. Unfortunately, Xunzi has never looked back after ten years. They use &quot;dig&quot; to describe Xunzi, and I use &quot;xunzi&quot; to describe Xunzi. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;We still became good friends. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;We successfully passed the single-recruitment interview and became students majoring in gardening at this Pheasant School. Later, we moved into a dormitory after adjustment. That year the word &quot;diaosi&quot; suddenly became popular. I felt that our whole school was full of diaosi. I like to tell the truth. This loser didn&#39;t just say &quot;including me&quot;, but a more precise statement was &quot;especially me&quot;. Xunzi and I learned to smoke. On countless nights while reading online novels, we sat on the balcony wrapped in quilts and smoked. I asked which chapter you had read, and he said that in chapter 3700, the male protagonist became the King of Douzong. I said: &quot;Have you done it?&quot; &amp;rdquo;He said, &amp;ldquo;No. &quot;I stamped out the cigarette butts, wrapped myself in a quilt and ran into the dormitory, &quot;Damn, the person who wrote this novel is really amazing. There are 3,700 chapters in, and the hero has not yet married the heroine. &quot;Xunzi chased me in and said, &quot;If I haven&#39;t finished Chapter 4,000 yet, I&#39;ll masturbate while watching it. If the male protagonist doesn&#39;t do it, I&#39;ll finish it first. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Ten years ago today, November 11th. A note posted on ONE&#39;s homepage that day was &quot;What&#39;s wrong with a man not having a wife?&quot; More importantly, that day, Han Han exposed five photos of Han Xiaoye on Weibo for the first time. I played games all night that day, and then went back to the dormitory to sleep in the early morning. At noon, I was woken up by Xunzi&#39;s cry. He stood on the balcony and shouted to the downstairs, &quot;Wait a minute!&quot; &amp;ldquo;I woke up and said, &amp;ldquo;What are you waiting for? &quot;He said: &quot;There is a woman downstairs who can lend me a lighter and light candles. &quot;I jumped out of bed and ran to the balcony and said, &quot;Female? ! &amp;rdquo;I stretched my head and saw a beautiful woman. She raised her head and I said: &quot;Wait a minute, beautiful woman, I have it.&quot; &amp;rdquo;I went back to the dormitory, put the lighter into an empty cigarette case and threw it away. She bent down to pick it up and waved her hand to indicate that the lighter was not broken. I shouted: &quot;Give it back to me.&quot; &quot;She said: &quot;How can I give it back to you? &quot;I said: &quot;In the evening, at seven o&#39;clock, on the bridge over there. &amp;rdquo;I pointed to the cross bridge over the pond in front of the playground. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I said: &quot;Xunzi, you are really useless if I give you a chance.&quot; &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;This is how the story begins. Someone in the girls&#39; dormitory had a birthday and they didn&#39;t have a lighter, so they borrowed a lighter downstairs from the boys&#39; dormitory. It was an era when men and women were not so antagonistic. We successfully struck up a conversation through this, and she did not judge us as &quot;whimsical low-end men.&quot; What a great era, I miss it so much. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;That night Xunzi and I went to the appointment on time. I was wearing a huge headset and a special hip-hop style iron necklace hanging around my neck. Coupled with the yellow hair I dyed some time ago, I was dressed like a character in QQ Dance. That&#39;s a really stupid look. To be honest, when I see people like this on the street now, I want to kick them. But that was the trend I understood at the time. The other party also arrived as scheduled and brought a sister from the dormitory. At that time, Double Eleven was still purely Singles’ Day, with no shopping spree. Through the street lamp, I caught a glimpse of the girl at the end of the crowd. She was so beautiful, tall and well-proportioned. This is how my heroine appears. The first words she said when she appeared in my life were: &quot;This man is quite handsome.&quot; &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I looked around and found that she was looking at me and saying this. My unconventional look was recognized, and I suddenly blushed. With Xunzi&#39;s encouragement and assistance, I pushed through the crowd and left the girl&#39;s phone number. She told me her name. Let’s call her Dalai in the story. In my first novel &quot;Quiting Smoking&quot;, the heroine also used this name. The reason is that n and l in Northern Jiangsu dialect are not the same. Yes, big breasts sound like Diners. She has big breasts, so she is codenamed &quot;Dale&quot;. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;No matter what version you have heard me say or write before, I can responsibly say that this is the most authentic version of my first love. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The time was Singles’ Day ten years ago, November 11th, at 7pm. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;No one used WeChat at that time, unlike now where we can simply understand each other through Moments. After I returned to the dormitory, I could only make a blunt call, but the line was busy. Three days later, I called again, and Diner answered the call. I said, &quot;The beauty is out for dinner.&quot; &quot;She said: &quot;What to eat? &quot;There seemed to be a discussion about the plot of some TV series in her dormitory. She was participating in the discussion while talking to me, intermittently, which was very impolite. After several awkward conversations, I felt bored, so I suddenly hung up the phone to show my anger. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The anger did not last long. The next day, Diner called me back. The first sentence was: &quot;Aren&#39;t you going to call me for dinner?&quot; &amp;rdquo;We had a simple meal of dumplings at school, and our mouths were full of the taste of leeks after we finished it. Then we walked out of school. Next to the school is a huge tea garden, and we walked around there for nearly two hours. She was wearing a khaki windbreaker and long boots. I never thought I would be walking with a girl dressed in such fashionable clothes, and I wanted to bring all my diaosi friends over to watch. Finally, when the school was about to lock the door, we returned to school. Downstairs in the dormitory, she said: &quot;Actually, you can hug me.&quot; &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I said: &amp;ldquo;Huh? &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I think this is a very strange girl. She talks strangely, does strange things, and does not follow the normal route when it comes to love. She suddenly said this sentence when she went out for a walk for the first time. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I smiled and waved my hand. She smiled back and turned around and entered the dormitory. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;On November 17, I specifically asked Xunzi to borrow two hundred yuan. I thought to myself that this grandson has eaten so many meals from me without giving me any money. Today is the time for you to pay with your life. . Xunzi decisively lent me two hundred, which greatly improved my evaluation of this person&#39;s character. That was my first official date with Dinai. We watched a movie. During the process, I tried to hold hands several times but failed. When we left the cinema, I was waiting for her at the bathroom door. After she washed her hands, she ran towards me and naturally held my hand. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Puberty is so wonderful, so simple. She smells so good. As a freshman at Pheasant School, I was fascinated by the scent of conditioner in her hair. Who knows, my family, I started with poor grades in junior high school. I went to a third-rate junior high school in my hometown, and then went to a fourth-rate high school. My family conditions were below average, and my life was basically ruined. When I decided to give up on my life, suddenly, life gave me a girl who I once thought was wrong even when I looked at her. This girl even said she liked me. I don’t even like myself, so what does she like about me? &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I was held by Dalai’s hand. My whole body was stiff and I walked like a zombie. Only after being held for a whole night did I dare to feel it seriously. It was a girl&#39;s hand, as thin as a bone, white, tender, fragrant, with long nails. Friends, I am not a writer of romance novels, but I want to tell you that when she stood in front of me, with her arms stretched out, her hands around my neck, and her eyes looking at me, I wouldn’t even stab me with a knife. Shouting pain. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;But I am not deceived by love. During that time, Xunzi kept reminding me, brothers, be careful not to be played by this kind of woman. I took a drag on my cigarette and fell into deep thought. In fact, I thought so in my heart at the time. I thought I was just one of her many playthings, so I had reservations about everything. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;But I don’t want to keep the suspense here in the story—Dai Lai is not “that kind of woman.” In fact, she is such a brave and upright girl, she will fight for it unabashedly if she likes it, and this behavior is usually understood by us as &quot;not reserved&quot;. I have always been worried that there are many men around her. In fact, she is such a simple person. During the five years she was with me, she always liked me. Until the moment we broke up, she seemed to finally be in her five-year dream. I woke up so determined. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;It was a late autumn night with one foot into winter, and we held hands and walked everywhere inside and outside the school. We drank two cups of milk tea for five yuan a cup, ate a roasted sweet potato, and bought a bag of sugar-roasted chestnuts. Finally, the dormitory was about to close, and we were so reluctant to leave. I swear I really didn’t want to leave Dalai for a moment. Being with her not only satisfied my vanity, but also satisfied the loneliness of adolescence. Finally we reached a consensus that we would never separate tonight. So she rushed back to the dormitory to pack things for girls to spend the night, and I ran to the supermarket to buy snacks and beer. About fifteen minutes later we met at the school gate and took a black taxi to the city. I confessed my first time at a place called &quot;Baidu Hotel&quot;. Damn, I even thought it was funny when I wrote this. I don’t know how many versions of “first time” have appeared in my novels. Anyone who writes is a shameless liar, don’t believe it. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;This first experience was really exciting for me at the time. We kissed naked for a long time, our legs intertwined like twine, my hands passed under her armpits, and then I caressed the back of her neck. The roots of her hair were so soft and I smelled behind her earlobes like a pervert. I never thought that what stimulated me at the time would also hurt me later in my long life. &lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div style=&quot;font-size:26px;line-height: 1;&quot;>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;The most beautiful long hair is wrapped around the back of the neck and is not left in my hand . &lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;After we came back, we experienced a sensational breakup. Two people who had no intention of breaking up said a lot of decisive words to each other. It seemed that the cause of the matter was that she was going to Wuxi to celebrate the birthday of a high school classmate. The classmate was female, but they also had a group of male classmates who had a good time in high school who were also going. I have low self-esteem, and I feel that as soon as Dai Lai leaves my side, he will definitely return to the mountains and become completely free. Xunzi was jealous of me and fanned the flames. He: &quot;Brother, you still don&#39;t understand men. These men and women drink two glasses of wine together, right?&quot; Xunzi clapped his hands vigorously and spread them out, as if everything was over, and said: &quot;Then it&#39;s all over.&quot; &amp;rdquo;When I think about it, it’s true that men can have some good things. It’s not unreasonable for many sisters to call men stinking country men nowadays. It is normal for our Chinese men to get interested when they see Dalai&#39;s figure. Besides, they already know each other and are very familiar with her, so she is not wary. I said: &quot;Brother, don&#39;t worry, I won&#39;t let Dalai go.&quot; Xunzi said: &quot;That&#39;s good. By the way, when did you give me back the two hundred you took from me last time?&quot; &amp;rdquo;I was shocked, and suddenly felt that this person might have been waiting for this sentence for a long time. I waved my hand and said, &quot;Waiting for you to talk about a girlfriend, now is the time for me to spend money.&quot; &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;While Xunzi and I were communicating, Dalai was already on the bus to Wuxi. I asked her on QQ: &quot;Where are you? Are you going downstairs for dinner?&quot; &quot;She said: &quot;I went to Wuxi. Didn&#39;t I tell you? &amp;rdquo;I said: &amp;ldquo;Didn’t you say I would go on Saturday? &amp;rdquo;She said: &amp;ldquo;I was talking about Friday. &amp;rdquo;I immediately started to look through the chat history, and found that the person was really talking about Friday. I didn’t know how to remember it as Saturday. I suddenly felt like I had a mouthful of old blood in my mouth, and I had nowhere to vent my anger. I said: &quot;Okay, you go.&quot; &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;At that time, I realized that my emotions had been completely controlled by her. I was so passive and started to be incompetent and furious. I decided to break up and not get stuck in it anymore. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I tossed and turned in bed that night, unable to fall asleep. Xunzi asked me to go to the balcony to smoke. We wrapped ourselves in thick quilts and sat on stools, while the smoke rose gently. The cold air penetrated through the gaps in the quilt, making people shiver for a while and then wake up quickly. &amp;ldquo;I have never been more vulnerable. &amp;rdquo;I said. Xunzi took a deep breath from the cigarette, then turned to look at me with squinted eyes. I said: &quot;I miss her so much.&quot; &amp;rdquo;Xunzi took another deep breath of cigarette and said nothing. We wore headphones and sat on the balcony to smoke. I listened to four songs, which I still remember. They were &quot;When I Miss You&quot; by Wang Feng, &quot;Ms. Dong&quot; by Song Dongye, and &quot;In My Life&quot; by Eason Chan. Favorite&quot;, and a &quot;Midnight Serenade&quot;. It&#39;s great, &quot;but my heart is still occupied by her every minute.&quot; I still can&#39;t listen to these four songs calmly, because at that time, my heart was really occupied by her every minute. Every minute, every moment. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;After she came back from Wuxi, I started to quarrel with her. She couldn&#39;t resist and finally broke through. I was satisfied and broke up. She cried in front of me for the first time. Small town boys are so vindictive, but it all stemmed from my low self-esteem. In fact, deep down in my heart, I should be very jealous that she has such a good group of friends that we can celebrate her birthday together across the city. I don&#39;t have these friends. They were too lively, which made me feel even more lonely. I said, &quot;You really don&#39;t care about how I feel, so let&#39;s leave it at that.&quot; &quot;She said: &quot;No matter what, there is no time when I don&#39;t care about you. &amp;rdquo;After saying that, she cried even harder. I was sitting on the stairs in front of the library, and she was standing on the steps below me. The winter wind was biting, she looked up at me and said, &quot;I&#39;m going back.&quot; &amp;ldquo;I said: &amp;ldquo;You go. Then she left. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I originally planned to sit alone in front of the library all night, but after fifteen minutes I was so cold that I ran back to the dormitory. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Soon after, I started to have a fever and a cold and stopped going to class. One day Xunzi said to me: &quot;Da Lai came to our classroom to look for you. I said you didn&#39;t come, so she left.&quot; &amp;rdquo;I was lying in bed with a high fever, with tissues stuffed in both nostrils to block the runny nose. When I heard this, I felt extremely aggrieved. Then he sat up and opened his laptop, hovering the mouse over Dali&#39;s avatar over and over again, and then clicked on her QQ space icon. Before I met Dai Lai, my understanding of myself was &quot;I am a person who has never been liked by others and will never be liked by others.&quot; At that time, I really I would rather I still be this kind of person, I would rather she never appeared in my world. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;After I recovered, Xunzi and I had a big drink. The two of us drank about a bottle of white wine. For me at that time, it was already the limit of breaking up. When I woke up in Baidu Hotel, she was lying next to me. I was shocked at first, and then I got up and took a shower without any expression. When I came back, she looked at me and I looked at her. I was silent, then lay back on the bed and crawled into her arms. I said: &quot;Don&#39;t make me feel that you don&#39;t love me.&quot; &quot;Dalei said: &quot;I have never been like this. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I said: &amp;ldquo;I miss you so much, actually. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;She said: &amp;ldquo;I know, actually I know that your self-esteem is just a little hurt, but you have to learn to grow up. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I suddenly cried in her arms. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I was too naive at that time. So now I particularly believe in fate. I feel that I will definitely meet Dai Lai at that time in my life and let her help me grow. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Every time I think about it, I feel ashamed. What have I helped her in the five years we have been together? &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;At the beginning of my sophomore year, she helped me make my bed in the dormitory. She found that my quilt had been burned with several holes when I went to the balcony to smoke, so she gave me a blanket. She said she brought it from home and had been using it for many years. I still have this blanket at home and I wrap my son in it every time I give him a bath. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In the summer vacation of my sophomore year, I went to her home for the first time. Her parents went to Zhejiang to visit. We went out to walk the dog in the morning, and then went to the market to buy a lot of vegetables, and the plastic bags were heavy on our hands. I was sweating profusely when I came back. While taking a shower, she shouted loudly from the kitchen next door: &quot;The shower gel is on the shelf on the left, the shampoo is next to the shower gel, the facial cleanser is in the cabinet below, the conditioner is behind me, and my towel is the pink one.&quot; &amp;rdquo;I stood under the shower head, the sound of gurgling water pouring in. &amp;ldquo;Did you hear that? &amp;rdquo;I said: &amp;ldquo;I know! &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;She opened the bathroom door, stuck her head in, and said, &quot;I bought you a toothbrush and put it on the sink. The black one and the bath towel were hung on the door handle.&quot; Love you, my Qi. &amp;rdquo;She blinked her eyes, oh my god, my heart melts like the water pouring down from above. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;After I took a shower with her shower gel and shampoo, my body was filled with the same fragrance as hers. I could smell the fragrance of her hair when I shook my head. It felt very good. After lunch we took a nap. It was the first time I slept in her bed, and it felt more peaceful than the cold white sheets of the hotel. That was the deepest nap I&#39;ve ever had. It may have been evening when I woke up, the sunshade curtains were drawn tightly, and the room was almost dark. I was afraid of disturbing her sleep, so I didn&#39;t dare to move. But when I turned around, I found her eyes blinking in the faint light. She smiled, which was amazing. Although I couldn&#39;t see the corners of her mouth, I seemed to feel her presence. laugh. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Later I often dreamed that she opened my bathroom door, blinked and said, &quot;I bought you a toothbrush.&quot; I felt like my life had stopped at that moment, and I was telling the truth. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Later, Xunzi and I drank a lot, and then I quit smoking. When I told Dalai that I wanted to quit smoking, she sneered and said, &quot;Quickly stop me.&quot; &amp;rdquo;We had graduated by then, and she knew me too well, so she didn’t believe I could succeed at all. As a result I have never smoked again, to this day. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I think she really knew me too well, and her disdain at that time really helped me quit smoking successfully. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In 2016, I went to Shanghai, and in the second half of the year I went to Ningbo. It was August when I arrived in Ningbo. I lived in an attic with no air conditioning. As long as it was sunny, the temperature in the room was always above 45 degrees, like a steamer. Men are cheap in this place. When they are in pain, they start to miss their lover. I spent the whole night thinking about her and drinking beer. Sometimes I would climb to the rooftop and look at the port city and the dim stars in the sky. Life is really hard, you know that, Diners? Especially those who are pretentious and want to do many extraordinary things, but we are all too small, as small as dust, or smaller than dust. I love you so much, I can&#39;t stop thinking about it. These broken thoughts helped me survive the hot summer in the low-rent housing. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;At the end of that year, we went to Zhouzhuang together and stayed in a B&amp;B in Zhouzhuang for three days. There is a temple at the end of Zhouzhuang Old Street. What is very disrespectful is that I have forgotten the name of the temple, and who it is dedicated to is also unclear. But I remember we knelt on the futon in front of the Buddha statue and made a lot of promises. I really remember. Dalai later told me that before and after going to Zhouzhuang, she actually had the idea of ​​breaking up with me for the first time, and it was also the first time in more than three years since we were together. I asked why, and she said: &quot;I feel that I have never appeared in the future you planned. You have always been a free child, and you think so yourself.&quot; &amp;rdquo;我想否认，但是无从否认，好像我毕业以后去任何地方都是如此果断。我才是真的挣脱了牢笼，开始肆意追求自由的那一个，即使过程中有很多辛苦，例如那个阁楼里的炎热夏天，但我还是快乐的。她补充了一句：&amp;ldquo;所以你那天跪在佛像前，突然说了一句，希望我们能白头偕老，我突然沉默，思考了很久，我不知道你是真的这么认为，还是只是随口说说。 &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;我想了想，说：&amp;ldquo;随口说说。 &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;2018年底，我跟随我们项目团队去成都。我把飞去成都的机场选在苏南硕放机场&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;离大莱的家很近。我们短暂地见了一面，吃了一顿日料，然后开了个钟点房，不是你理解的做那种事&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;是开了个钟点房洗了个澡抱着睡了一觉。事实上我们大多数住在一起都只是抱着睡觉。然后她开车送我去往苏南硕放机场，像你猜到的那样，我们最终在苏南硕放机场外面分手。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;这段分手的经历我写过多个版本，有时候是接近事实的版本，有时候我加入了很多自己的臆想&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;这也是写作者的权利了，我可以把每个角色塑造成自己想要的那样，把每段故事写成我愿意看到的那样。此时此刻我不想再写一遍，我只想记录一下当时她说过的一段话，她说：&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div style=&quot;font-size:26px;line-height: 1;&quot;>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;其实五年很漫长，十八到二十三岁，最美妙的年华，我们互相陪伴，现在的确走到了无法支撑的尽头。就这样吧，祁，你要有快乐的人生。我说的快乐不是旅行、喝酒、唱歌，你要正视你的人生、努力和责任，温柔，还要坚定。还有，不要总是怀念我，更不要忘记我。还有，珍惜下一个爱你的人，会有的，在未来。 &lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;内容大概如上。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;2020年秋天，我从成都回到江苏，我和勋子喝了一顿大酒。他不知道我和大莱早已分手，居然带了个礼物，什么海什么迷的化妆品，花里胡哨的。我说这是干吗，他说送给大莱的。我说还懂化妆品啊，他说客户送的。我说，我和大莱早就分手了。他沉默，拍了拍我的肩膀。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;这些迅速消逝的时间里，勋子也经历了很多事。他升了本科，然后离谱地读了研。他好像走上了我和他都从未想过的一条路，他突然爱上了这种感觉。勋子跟我形容：&amp;ldquo;刚好我前面十几年该学习的时候都没有学习，突然有一天学了一下，感觉还挺有意思，他妈的。 &amp;rdquo;那时候勋子在南京，在学校的组织下和各个单位研讨学习，然后他很快就爱上了一个公司的女中层，是正经公司的正经女中层。她经历了一段漫长的婚姻，然后回归了生命的本质，也就是孤独。上面这句是勋子的原话。我说：&amp;ldquo;是不是离过婚？ &amp;rdquo;勋子说：&amp;ldquo;反正是回归了孤独。 &amp;rdquo;离过婚的中青年女性的心有多难走进去，就有多难走出来。很难想象这是勋子的初恋，他用一手好菜，彻底征服了中层离婚女，两人日复一日的在夜晚的餐桌上对饮。女中层的家外面是高铁轨道，夜晚高铁&amp;ldquo;唰&amp;rdquo;的一声呼啸而过。 &amp;ldquo;像是我短暂的年轻，&amp;rdquo;勋子说，&amp;ldquo;其实我挺羡慕你的，有一段这样的校园恋情，我想想我跟她在一起三年半，从未在朋友圈发过她，从未认真说过一句爱她。不像你们，每天躺在宿舍互相打电话，肉麻得要死。 &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;在我研究生毕业那年，我爸死了。 &amp;rdquo;勋子突然说了一句，又沉默。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;我们在烧烤店对坐，面前放满了啤酒瓶。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;他突发急性脑出血，躺床上嗯嗯呀呀半天，我妈也没打120，也没打车，就骑着电动车带他去医院，半路上就一头栽下去了。从我家到医院，打车费也就10块钱。 &amp;rdquo;勋子眼睛一湿，摆摆手，我不知道他是不想再喝了，还是不想再说了。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;我们喝到第二天凌晨店里打烊，我居然越喝越清醒。勋子自然是到了买单的时候又开始呼呼大睡，这人一贯如此，一到买单的时候就装死。在我和大莱刚在一起的时候他一再提醒我，千万当心，越漂亮的女人越会骗人。他说这话的时候我从来没有想到，这辈子骗我最多的不是女人。我们打车离开的时候他特别清醒，说：&amp;ldquo;兄弟，我刚才是真喝多了，不是骗你。 &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;我说：&amp;ldquo;我特别想她，那么些年兜兜转转，像他妈一场梦，两手空空。 &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;勋子想了想，说：&amp;ldquo;兄弟，等我们一觉睡醒，我带你去找她。 &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;彼时，终于有辆出租车在我们面前停下来，勋子头伸进主驾驶的窗户，说：&amp;ldquo;万达多少钱？ &amp;rdquo;司机一闻浑身酒气，看也没看他，回答道：&amp;ldquo;二十。 &amp;rdquo;勋子冲上去就要打他，说：&amp;ldquo;你个逼养的真以为我喝多了是吧，起步价就能到你他妈收我二十。 &amp;rdquo;司机骂了句&amp;ldquo;傻逼&amp;rdquo;，然后一脚油门就走了。我和勋子在尘土飞扬的施工路段，像是两个被扔掉的蛀了虫的瓜子。勋子突然蹲下来哭了，哭得歇斯底里，嘴里的槟榔都掉了出来。勋子说有些时候他会发现，自己骨子里始终和自己的父母是一样的人。我安慰他，我说：&amp;ldquo;勋子没事的，你会成为真正的Old money，成为贵族，但是你首先的第一步，就是从下次买单的时候再也不装醉开始。 &amp;rdquo;勋子听完更伤心了，说：&amp;ldquo;我他妈是真醉了。 &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;我们在足疗店睡到了下午四点，然后打车去烧烤店地下停车场，勋子的车停在这。我在副驾驶坐定，看了一眼硕大的奔驰标志，说：&amp;ldquo;看来这些年混得还行啊。 &amp;rdquo;他说：&amp;ldquo;别扯没用的，我现在就问你，我们去不去找她？ &amp;rdquo;我说：&amp;ldquo;废话，我酒都醒了。 &amp;rdquo;勋子叹了口气，放倒座椅，点燃一根烟，然后躺下去。车很智能地放起音乐，唱道&amp;ldquo;是否你走过了我身边，恍恍惚惚一瞬间&amp;rdquo;。眼看秋深，又是我们相遇的季节。是否你真的走过了我身边，我真的不知道。因为这些年写东西，又经常喝酒，记性不好，我开始怀疑很多事到底是我创作出来的，还是的确真实发生过。甚至我开始怀疑，到底她这个人物是否的确真实存在&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;我是真的怀疑过，并且去看过心理医生。咨询费一个小时六百二，当场康复，复诊都没去。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;勋子说：&amp;ldquo;要不你来我这吧。 &amp;rdquo;他当时是一个数码大厂的城市总经理，这个数码大厂的产品最近特别火，特别&amp;ldquo;遥遥领先&amp;rdquo;。我欣然同意，入职了这家数码大厂。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;最后一次见到大莱，2020年的冬天。大莱给我打了三个电话，我和勋子正在洗澡，手机锁在柜子里。一个小时的大澡泡完，准备去按个脚休息一下。勋子穿好衣服，说：&amp;ldquo;走啊，快穿衣服。 &amp;rdquo;我站在柜子面前，拿着手机，皱着眉头。勋子感觉不对劲，走过来一看，大莱的三个未接来电，红色的，特别显眼。他看看我，我看看他。他说：&amp;ldquo;先穿衣服。 &amp;rdquo;我不敢回她电话，真的不敢，我完全想不到她会有什么事找我。我沉默着按完脚，然后正襟危坐，点燃一根烟。我说：&amp;ldquo;勋子，抽完这根烟，我回她电话。 &amp;rdquo;未曾想一根烟刚点着，电话又来了。勋子说：&amp;ldquo;这大莱还是在乎你，一般人打俩不接就不会再打了，大莱还是当你是自己人，不介意。 &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;其实我那个时候真正让我迷惑的是，我根本不知道是现实中的大莱在给我打电话，还是我故事里的大莱在给我打电话，而且我也分不清这两个大莱到底有什么区别。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;大莱说，她要去一趟东北，我说有什么事吗，她说，要去玩，全家都去。我心想四个电话打过来不会是要邀请我一起吧，她接着说，家里的狗&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;没人照顾了。我说，宠物寄养呢？她说，不是很放心。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;于是一周后我开着勋子的大奔前往大莱家养狗。那是她自己买的房子，她毕业就开了个淘宝店，后来越做越好，19年双十一单日做了四百多万营业额，所以财富自由得挺早。她说人生中所有的坏事好事都发生在双十一了。她说的好事肯定是自己淘宝店的成功，我难免觉得，她说的坏事只能指的是和我认识。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;再见面时特别生硬，我想要不要拥抱一下，或者寒暄两句。这也是男人的贱性之一，总以为曾经在一起睡过的两个人再陌生能陌生到哪去。未曾想到我按照她说的楼号上楼的时候，我们就在同一趟电梯，电梯里大概五六个人，我们站在两边角落，居然互相没认出来。直到我们在同一楼层下来，她才开始打量我，我试探着看了一眼，果然是她。我点点头，微笑。大莱又看了一眼，然后转头去开门，说：&amp;ldquo;进来吧。 &amp;rdquo;像是带了一个空调维修工之类的人回家。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;她给我介绍了一下家里的主要功能区，例如冰箱，洗衣机，衣服挂在哪之类的，我抓抓头，说：&amp;ldquo;我睡哪？ &amp;rdquo;她说：&amp;ldquo;你别阴阳怪气的。 &amp;rdquo;我说：&amp;ldquo;我说真的，我睡哪？ &amp;rdquo;大莱说：&amp;ldquo;你睡哪不行啊，我难道还能嫌弃你？ &amp;rdquo;我心里笑了一下，心想终于听到一句人话了。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;然后我就甘心情愿地在那里待了十二天。那是足够漫长的十二天，我躺累了坐着，坐累了就站着。我之前有篇小说，叫《陇塘河下》，就是在那养狗的十二天里写出来的。 &amp;ldquo;确实有一些东西，努力或者坚持，在深夜对天地哭喊，或者在佛龛前跪破了膝盖，都是求而不得的。永远永远，永永远远，求而不得。 &amp;rdquo;写《陇塘河下》里这一段的时候是凌晨四五点。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;我知道我说出来这件事肯定会存在争议&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;那天晚上我在找她说的感冒药的时候，无意中在抽屉里发现了她的相机。我想打开相机看看，又放下，然后躺在床上四五个小时没能睡着，最终还是忍不住打开了。这个相机我并不陌生，她高三暑假的时候买的，大学期间一直带在身边。相机里存有四千多张照片，其中的大多数照片我都从未见过。有她养的狗，还有风景，各种角度的我，还有一些她自己的照片。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;有一张照片是她给我拍的，在学校旁边的茶园里。那是一个夏天的上午，阳光刺眼，照片里的我拿着手机正在拍她。于是我手机保存的那张照片是她端着相机在拍我，她保存的照片是我拿着手机在拍她。这样的照片还有很多，我拿出手机，翻开我自己的云盘相册，还有从前记录的那些文字，多年前模糊、被压缩的回忆慢慢浮现。我视角里的她和她视角里的我，在不同的时空遥相呼应，然后在一个被丢掉的夜晚短暂相遇，重合。我们这样就在彼此的回忆里互为人质，故事以文字、照片两种形式，从我们俩不同的视角重新被讲述。一整夜的时间我几乎把我们的青春又复盘了一遍，又爱了一遍，恨了一遍，分手了一遍。像是穿越小说里的女主拉着男主的手回到了过去，我们在泛黄的记忆里凝视，随着第一滴眼泪滴落，画面被这水滴砸碎。说句矫情的话，我感觉我的青春结束了，就在我对着相机失神的那个夜里。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;所以到底为什么造物主在书写命运的规则的时候，&amp;ldquo;rule 1&amp;rdquo;就是人生绝不可以重来？故事写到这里，寥寥几千字，数十年就在我指尖跳跃而走。这人生未免太过于短暂，残酷。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;21年8月，我结婚。遇到她时我刚刚挣到人生的第一桶金，或者说是第一桶银吧，因为没有&amp;ldquo;金&amp;rdquo;那么多，但是也不少。我买了辆不错的车，过上了不那么紧张的生活。感谢勋子。我们如此迅速地恋爱。那时我真的记得大莱跟我说的话，她说要珍惜下一个爱你的人，在未来。我想她说的未来就是此时此刻。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;次年九月，我的孩子在疫情最严重的时候出生了，他小名叫童童。不久后童童核酸检测阳性，我和老婆一边发着高烧一边陪着他彻夜不眠。不能说几乎崩溃，是彻底崩溃。所以我到现在都特别感恩。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;疫情康复以后童童给我带来的第一个焦虑是，他不会翻身。老话说三翻六坐九爬爬，正常来说三个月就会翻身了，这笨蛋七个月还不会翻身。那天夜里我被他一脚踹在脸上，然后艰难醒来，抱着咿咿呀呀的他哄了一会儿，然后把他放在床上开始冲奶粉。奶粉冲好以后回到床上，发现他居然趴着，我激动得几乎要哭出来，笑了半天，要知道我放下他的时候他是躺着的。我把我的老婆喊醒，童童却再也不愿意表演一次。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;我躺下，看着他咕噜咕噜地干饭，突然想明白了&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;其实他什么都想好了，什么时候翻身什么时候走路，什么时候张嘴叫人，甚至什么时候撒谎什么时候逃学，什么时候总是一头扎进房间脸上不再有任何笑容，更甚至什么时候一言不发远走高飞，仿佛我们之间所有的一切都轻如鸿毛不值一提何足挂齿。我突然明白了。所以也许未来有一天，他脸红脖子粗地跟我对峙，心里还洋洋得意自以为成功气到了我的时候，我心里想的其实是：小王八蛋，你在我怀里咯咯笑的时候我就想到了这天，我早做好准备了，你休想气到我。他看着我平静的笑容，转头一拳砸在卧室门上。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;就在上个月底，也就是半个月前吧，童童学会了走路。他无比神气，当然了，也许是我父爱滤镜太严重。那天我夜里失眠，跑到杂物间去收拾归纳自己的钓具，他居然在半夜突然醒来，然后自己下床，穿着鼓鼓的尿不湿走到我身边，我一回头吓了一大跳。我抱起他，我说：&amp;ldquo;你怎么那么厉害？ &amp;rdquo;他笑了一下，然后在我怀里睡去。我抱着他很久都没有放下。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;我抱着他走到窗边，外面是久违的漫天繁星。我太害怕苍老了，我突然陷入伤感。朋友们，如果你现在十七，十八，十九，我知道很多人跟你说过这句话，但是我还是想啰嗦一句，珍惜你的每一刻，真的。只需要再过二十年，你就将近四十岁了，你会很疲惫，我的朋友。陈奕迅歌里唱&amp;ldquo;从何时开始忌讳空山无人，从何时开始怕遥望星辰&amp;rdquo;。这首歌我有一天单曲循环了两百多遍，我已经迫不及待等到年底刷音乐软件的年度报告了&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;ldquo;那天，你把这首歌单曲循环了两百遍，那天你也很孤独吧。 &amp;rdquo;是的，我也很孤独，就像歌里唱的这样，你会有一天突然发现，自己不再敢脱离人群独自行动，甚至连仰望星辰的勇气都没有了。你害怕看到亘古的宇宙，害怕面对自己的渺小和短暂。你苍老了，你像一棵没人浇的花。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;朋友们，去勇敢，去经历。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;我抱着童童，又无可避免地开始幻想以后，幻想他被人喜欢的时候，或者他喜欢别人的时候。他会如何成长，如何接受人生不可逆转的真相。我真是迫不及待看到这一天，看到他喜欢的姑娘离他远去，他痛苦不已，然后长久地无法忘怀。他日复一日地生活，变得平淡，又像是失去了什么。终于有一天，他打开了电脑，那一天，他坐在显示器前，写下了开始追忆过去的第一句话：&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div
