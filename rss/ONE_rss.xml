We believe that no matter how crowded the literary field is, the &quot;backstage&quot; will always be those writers who are struggling on the road of writing and their inner history. &lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;The speaker&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wang Xiumei,&lt;/strong>;female, from Yantai, A contracted writer with the Shandong Writers Association and vice chairman of the Yantai Writers Association. He has published more than 5 million words of works, and his short and medium stories have appeared in &quot;People&#39;s Literature&quot;, &quot;Contemporary&quot;, &quot;October&quot;, &quot;Novel Monthly&quot;, etc. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xiaofan, &lt;/strong>;freelancer. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xiaofan: &lt;/strong>;Hello, Teacher Wang Xiumei, I am very happy to have such a fate to interview you. The first question is that I would like to ask you to briefly introduce some of your epiphanies about writing. For example, when did you gain some freedom in writing - you can write whatever you want, whatever you want, something like this. I thought of this question while reading this short story (&quot;The History of Island Drift&quot;). I think you have this realization and am very envious of it. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wang Xiumei:&lt;/strong>;Good rice! I have always known you and envied you for entering literature at a very young age with your rich education, strong talent and sharp edge. Therefore, I have a hunch that this is a slightly difficult interview, and I may need to work hard to &quot;deal with it.&quot; In my opinion, all writers who are associated with the words &quot;budding&quot; and &quot;new concept competition&quot; are members of a very special group that cannot be bypassed in the literary history of our time. You share many literary idiosyncrasies that many writers in the traditional sense do not possess, including the &quot;freedom&quot; you mentioned. You control the freedom of personality, thought, writing, and life with ease, and we are very envious. &quot;The History of Island Drift&quot; may indeed be a relatively free novel in terms of text form. My definition of &quot;freedom&quot; of text is probably that it is an equally extreme external form of expression that pushes stories and ideas to the extreme that the writer himself can achieve. &quot;Extreme&quot; includes stories and thoughts, and naturally also includes form. To clarify specifically when I gained this freedom, I think it generally stems from each writer&#39;s understanding of novels. I yearned for this freedom of narrative almost as soon as I entered literature at the beginning of the new century. After several years of writing, I have restrained myself a lot because I am gradually discovering the mysteries of novels. The more I discover, the more cautious I become. After about ten years, I entered into various bold attempts in text form, including every time the father disappeared in the &quot;Father Series&quot;, including &quot;Stories with Similarities and Different Titles&quot;, including almost every scene in the &quot;Father Series&quot;. Some surreal details are embedded in this novel - the reversal of time and space, the disruption of the seasonal sequence, reverse growth, etc. What you said, &quot;You can write whatever you want, whatever you want&quot; is actually not that easy. It was after more than ten years of technical training in novels and reading many excellent novels and literary theories that shocked me. Later, I dared to do it only after I knew that I could &quot;play&quot; the opposing relationships between reality and surreality, norms and freedom, etc. relatively easily. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xiaofan: &lt;/strong>;That’s true. I think this interview can help readers and colleagues learn more about Teacher Wang Xiumei’s writing experience, creative process and the formation of her style. It also allows you to share some writing skills and experiences. For example, do you think a writer who writes in the form of allegory will have any special experiences and scenery? This novel reminds me of the ending of &quot;The Transient Universe&quot;, where two stones have a silent dialogue with profound implications. Are you careful to express your values ​​in a fable? &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wang Xiumei:&lt;/strong>;This question makes me somewhat confused. I thought that after Melville wrote the famous &quot;Moby-Dick&quot;, the many evaluations given to him by critics included the allegorical aspect. Melville himself said in the article that he was afraid that his works would be regarded as &quot;horrible allegories, or worse and more abominable, as disgusting and intolerable satires.&quot; &amp;rdquo;When he wrote this book, he was fanatical about Hawthorne. Later, in a letter to Mrs. Hawthorne, he said that during the writing process, he vaguely felt that the whole book had an allegorical structure, but this did not prove that he I have the intention of writing a fable. In 2020, I spent several months studying &quot;Moby-Dick&quot; and I am deeply aware of Melville&#39;s confusion. I think that most writers do not presuppose &quot;writing in an allegorical way&quot; when they write. It is probably after they are completed that the text strangely takes on the characteristics of an allegory. In fact, if we think that every novelist is a deep &quot;carer&quot; when writing, this situation is not difficult to understand. It is the instinct of writing to express concern for the complex life and world in many aspects, whether explicit or implicit. Where instinct kicks in, reason and design take a back seat. I will definitely express my values, especially when writing a novel with a stronger &quot;fable&quot; flavor such as &quot;The History of Island Drift&quot;, I may pay more attention to the method of expressing my values. In short, effectively and skillfully weaving values ​​into novels tests instinct first, and wisdom and technology second. What I did was nowhere near good enough. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xiaofan: &lt;/strong>;If someone commented that you are a writer with a strong fairy tale temperament, would you agree with this comment? I would like to know how we writers can present deep value thoughts like pain and sadness in some surreal works, and how can we make the text more textured? &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wang Xiumei:&lt;/strong>;There are a number of great writers and works that have had a great influence on me. For example, Kafka&#39;s &quot;Knight of the Barrel&quot;, Calvino&#39;s &quot;The Baron in the Trees&quot;, Yuri. Vinichuk&#39;s &quot;Grandma&#39;s Embroidery&quot;, Lugonnes&#39; &quot;A Butterfly&quot;, Marcel. Aimee&#39;s &quot;Through the Wall&quot;, &quot;Transfiguration&quot; and all his novels, Marquez &quot;The Most Beautiful Drowned Man in the World&quot;, Ilsa. Eichinger&#39;s &quot;Mirror Story&quot;...of course, there are also the great &quot;Don Quixote&quot; and &quot;Strange Stories from a Chinese Studio&quot;. Too much. When I was lecturing at Yantai University a few years ago, I gave a special lecture on &quot;The Fairy Tale Temperament of Outstanding Writers&quot; and listed those writers who had an important influence on me. I think they have a strong fairy tale temperament. If someone comments that I am a writer with a strong fairy tale temperament, I will feel very honored, because all of the above are my teachers. One might intuitively assume that works with a strong sense of reality are more likely to represent pain and sadness. There are many realistic-themed works that also give examples. Because of this, surreal works will be more memorable if they can bring about deep thoughts of sadness. Many of the works I mentioned above are all excellent examples of this. About ten years ago, I read Calvino&#39;s &quot;Memo to the Next Peaceful Age&quot; written in 1985. This is a literary lecture. He talked about several literary viewpoints such as &quot;light&quot;, &quot;quick&quot;, &quot;accurate&quot;, &quot;easy to see&quot;, and &quot;complex&quot;. When talking about &quot;lightness&quot;, he talked about the opposition between lightness and heaviness and gave many examples. Western writers have a common characteristic when discussing literary theory: logical divergence and dense viewpoints. But each sentence can independently illustrate a literary truth. I understand and am fascinated by his pursuit of the ideal of lightness and his pursuit of seeing the world from a different perspective. Even using words like &quot;stone&quot; does not add a sense of heaviness to the poem. He talked about two tendencies, one is to make language like clouds, and the other is to give language a sense of heaviness, density and physical concreteness. Apparently, the former is his taste. This thin little book has shocked and helped me for more than ten years. Until now, whenever I start writing a new novel, the concept of &quot;lightness&quot; will first occupy my mind. Of course, I do not have the ability to fully capture all of Calvino’s insights and wisdom about ease, but I know that even a small harvest is enough to continuously shock my entire writing career. Therefore, &quot;In some surreal works, how should we writers present deep-seated value considerations such as pain and sadness, and how can we make the text more textured?&quot; This question, for me, , thanks to this word: &quot;light and easy&quot;. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xiaofan:&lt;/strong>; Regarding concepts and practices, I like this sentence very much, &quot;Your thinking is your limitation, and your action is your liberation.&quot; &amp;rdquo;Some people understand this sentence as a rule and warning for writers and artists to express their themes when creating. Most people agree that &quot;action is more important than thinking.&quot; I want to ask, what are the most profound themes in your work? Is it appropriate (or obligated) for a writer to address the themes of his work? &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wang Xiumei:&lt;/strong>;Every writer tries to express all the themes that literary works should express. If I had to choose the most profound theme, then I would probably choose &quot;time&quot;. In my opinion, all other themes occur within the theme of time. I have written too many novels that deconstruct and then reshape time. Write about people who travel through different time systems, write about people who are free from time, write about slow time, fast time, and disappearing time. Time is a magnificent magic trick for everyone, and breaking and modifying time may also be mankind&#39;s secret ambition. Therefore, even in those novels that are written step by step, I always subconsciously want to revise a small period of time. Thinking is restriction, action is liberation, I agree with this sentence. For example, I have written a lot of creative talks about time. Every time I write, I feel that I have said too much and have nothing to say, but I always make new discoveries while writing. The depth that literature can reach is unfathomable and extremely mysterious. This kind of depth cannot be reached by thinking in advance. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xiaofan:&lt;/strong>; Then let me ask a relatively serious question. What qualities do you think a writer should have? Can you name a specific writer you admire most? &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wang Xiumei:&lt;/strong>;First of all, a writer must be a lonely person. Second, writers are complex people. Innocence, gloom, contradiction, extreme, sincerity, weirdness, paranoia, sincerity, etc., often coexist in a writer. As a natural person, these contradictory and complex personalities often make him incompatible with the world; but as a writer, they may be his most valuable qualities to become an excellent writer. When we like a certain writer, we always try to find out more about his life and read articles about his creative experience. Probably because of this - we know that they must be different. Calvino is a man who doesn&#39;t like to talk about his life. He once said: &quot;I still belong to the same group of people as Croce, who believe that an author only has value in his works, so I do not provide biographical information.&quot; I&#39;ll tell you what you want to know, but I&#39;ll never tell you the truth. &quot;In the summer of 1985, Calvino fell ill while preparing to give a lecture at Harvard University. The surgeon said that he had never seen any brain structure replicated as exquisitely as Calvino&#39;s. This incident shocked me deeply, and it seemed to prove that some writers are extraordinary people chosen by nature. Tolstoy is a typical example of complex and contradictory character. He gets angry easily and rudely refutes other people&#39;s opinions. Turgenev once said that Tolstoy always liked to look at people like a judge, making them extremely embarrassed. He likes to make caustic remarks, castigate others harshly, and challenge those who, in his opinion, speak of him in a less than respectful manner. Once he planned to fight someone else, but his friends had a lot of trouble getting him to give up this ridiculous duel. If Tolstoy had not been of this character, then perhaps we would never have read &quot;War and Peace.&quot; &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xiaofan: &lt;/strong>;Continuing on this topic, you mentioned Calvino and Tolstoy. I would also like to ask: Do you think educating human beings is one of the writer’s vocation? In other words, what is the vocation of a writer? With the changes of the times, has this &quot;vocation&quot; changed? &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wang Xiumei:&lt;/strong>;There seems to be no doubt about this issue. I mentioned earlier that every writer is a deep &quot;carer&quot; when writing. In this case, his words and sentences have this vocation. However, we have long had a dispute over this issue. One believes that literary works should have an educational function, while the other believes that we should resolutely resist the &quot;functionalization&quot; of literary works and completely return them to art. I think this dispute is a bit narrow-minded. As long as we think about it, any novel expresses the complexity of people and the world, and it naturally has educational properties. There is no writer in the world who does not want to try to give his own suggestions and advice to the world in his works. As times change, the external requirements and forms of &quot;education&quot; will of course be different, but I think that an honest writer will understand how to express his thoughts honestly with words, sentences and stories, and how to express his thoughts honestly. The possibility of changes in the novel caused by the implantation of indoctrination is dealt with intelligently. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xiaofan:&lt;/strong>;&amp;ldquo;The passion for creation is inseparable from reading. &amp;rdquo;If you were to talk about your favorite works, which works would you mention? What part of the work do you value most? Why? ——You can talk about a few other people&#39;s works, or you can talk about some of your own works. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wang Xiumei:&lt;/strong>;There are so many writers and works that I like. If I were to count them, I would have to count at least a hundred of them. There are some that writers collectively like, such as &quot;One Hundred Years of Solitude&quot; by Marquez and other &quot;god-like works&quot;. There are also some that may not be liked by everyone, such as Melville’s Moby-Dick. In order to study it, I spent three months and wrote more than 50,000 words of reading notes. It makes me worship. I love every word of it, every out-of-the-ordinary part. What I talk about the most is &quot;Strange Stories from a Chinese Studio&quot;. Its strangeness is that there is only one such book in the world. I like Maugham&#39;s reading essays better than his novels. As for Calvino, I love his two strange books &quot;Weird Tales&quot; and &quot;The Complete Collection of Cosmic Curiosities&quot;, which are surprises besides the trilogy such as &quot;The Non-Existent Knight&quot;. Some time ago I read Zuo Si&#39;s &quot;San Du Fu&quot; and was amazed by its splendor, magnificence and charm. There are so many good works, and every time I read them, I feel conflicted: on the one hand, I am grateful and worshipful, on the other hand, I am desperate and confused. For example, I especially love many themes in &quot;Strange Stories from a Chinese Studio&quot;: dreams, cause and effect, reincarnation, etc. Perhaps because of its influence, I wrote &quot;Going to Huaihuazhou&quot;. While two strangers were waiting in the waiting room of the train station, they made a temporary decision to buy tickets to Huaihuazhou and travel together. Finally the girl woke up and found that she had had a long dream while waiting for the bus. He told the dream to the strange man next to him, and the man suggested that he should follow the guidance of the dream and really go to Sophora Flower Island. However, at the ticket window, they were told that there was no such station. The difference is that the dreams written by Pu Songling are mostly about separation and reunion, but I wrote an impossible dream. In addition, I still wrote about time in this novel, and about people who use dreams to escape from the current time and space. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xiaofan: &lt;/strong>;Time is one of the most important themes in literature and art. For the &quot;longest&quot; time, most life experiences are boring, uninteresting, or uncreative. But maybe not for writers. Some people say that &quot;inspiration is what angels hide in their hair.&quot; For you, your total creative output is very impressive. I found information that your creative work has nearly 10 million words--so, Teacher Wang , where does most of your creative inspiration come from? How do you get your inspiration? &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wang Xiumei:&lt;/strong>;There is no doubt that life is where creation comes from. Of course, my creative inspiration also comes from life, from the fields where I am active every day. Hrabal once said: &quot;For me, the most important thing is life, life, life.&quot; Observe people&#39;s lives and participate in any kind of life, no matter the cost. &amp;rdquo;He has worked in a variety of jobs throughout his life, including notary office clerk, business school administrator, warehouse manager, railway worker, train dispatcher, insurance company clerk, merchandise salesman, temporary worker in a steel plant, and scrap collection station Packers, theater set workers and walk-on actors to name a few. It was not until 1963, when he was forty-nine, that he published his first collection of short stories, &quot;The Pearl at the Bottom&quot;. For him, those work experiences are where his novels come from. Taking the example of Hrabal easily leads to another problem: in different real lives, many writers only engage in one or two jobs throughout their lives until they retire. They cannot continue to experiment and experience like Hrabal. I think, for me, inspiration may come more from a kind of self-awareness. The little details in life happen every second, just like the storms rolling up the shells on the beach day and night. Each one of them has a unique texture and color. The writer is the one who is constantly observing and picking up shells. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xiaofan: &lt;/strong>;What is the most difficult part of writing for you? ——When I saw the shell, I was not excited and didn’t want to pick it up. You may even feel that those shells are not worth bending over. If this happens, how can these difficulties be overcome? When you can&#39;t write anymore - I think there will always be such a moment. How do you deal with writer&#39;s block in the writing process? What would you do if you were stuck in a writing dilemma where you couldn&#39;t move on, were stuck at a certain point and couldn&#39;t figure out what to write next, or weren&#39;t satisfied with the plot, theme, or characters of the story? &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wang Xiumei:&lt;/strong>;The most difficult part when writing is how to enter the stage of the next work after completing one work. When starting a new novel, I always go through a difficult period of three to five days, not knowing how to start. But I have been writing for more than 20 years, and there are always various ways to survive these three to five days. For example, if you write hard, no matter what happens next, just choose a word to start with. Friends who know me well know this characteristic of mine. And there is waiting. I later discovered that sitting in front of the computer, occasionally getting up and walking around, and then sitting again, this kind of waiting seemed to be undergoing a test arranged by a mysterious force. After the test period, I can naturally write. What I remember most is writing &quot;Father&#39;s Bridge&quot;. At that time, I had no idea in my mind about what to write for the next work. I just knew that I had to write a new work out of writing inertia and self-requirement. There was a yoga mat in the study room. It was not used for exercise, but just for sitting on it and reading occasionally. That night, everything was quiet, and my cell phone was relatively quiet. I walked around, distressed, and then lay flat on my yoga mat. I looked at the skylights, walls, bookcases, and desks on the sloping roof. I felt that from the perspective of lying on the ground, they suddenly became so big and so far away. The space seemed to be rapidly expanding, and the sense of time came one after another. At this time, I suddenly decided that I wanted to look back, pull away from myself, and write about my parents. So I got up and wrote &quot;Father&#39;s Bridge&quot;. &quot;Father&#39;s Bridge&quot; is the beginning of the &quot;Father Series&quot;, and it is also my most satisfying work in this series so far. It has been reprinted many times and was selected into the Novel Society Ranking; and I have adopted it as a novel. The title of the collection can be described as a grand commemoration. Of course, there are situations when you are dissatisfied with the plot, theme or characters of the story during the writing process. It is not difficult to solve this problem. There is only one way: solve it during the advancement of the text. No literary problem can be solved purely by thinking and thinking apart from the writing itself. Only by continuously superimposing and rolling words, sentences, and paragraphs can we find opportunities to solve difficult problems. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xiaofan: &lt;/strong>;Do you have a specific writing habit or method or path that is effective? How do you maintain these habits or methods? &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wang Xiumei: &lt;/strong>;It seems not. My writing is more casual. I envy those teachers and friends who allocate their time in an orderly manner. They set themselves how much to write every day. What to do in the morning, what to do in the afternoon, and what to do in the evening. When to read, when to write. And I have never planned this way in terms of time division. I can read when I want to and write when I want to write. Sometimes I write more, sometimes I write less, sometimes I don’t write a word for several days. How to maintain... Writing for twenty years has become a habitual behavior. If I have to talk about a specific habit, it would be to always have requirements for myself: persist, never stop, and keep writing. This is the only motivation that has sustained me for more than 20 years of writing. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xiaofan: &lt;/strong>;Are you a perfectionist in literary creation? Will you fall into the trap of &quot;excessive&quot; perfectionism? I know that some writers may pursue perfection too much, causing them to procrastinate writing and completing their works. This may be because they are afraid of making mistakes or they are not sure whether their work is perfect. Including the self-doubt part? Some writers may be unable to continue writing because of self-doubt. They may feel that they are not good enough or they may worry that their work will not be accepted. Have you had similar experience? &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wang Xiumei:&lt;/strong>;I am a perfectionist. But not exactly the kind of perfectionist you are referring to. I hope that each of my works will be written in a &quot;sound and clear tone&quot;, like a novel, and I hope it will be the best possible way. But I don’t put off writing for that. In my folder, I haven’t accumulated a single semi-finished product or a backlog of manuscripts in more than 20 years. This may be related to my personal personality. I am the kind of person who either doesn&#39;t do something or does it, but I must finish it. I call myself a &quot;closed-loop personality.&quot; Therefore, I am particularly vigilant about whether the novel I am writing is making mistakes and is very imperfect, so I am &quot;looking around&quot; every word every second. I think every writing that loses control somewhere along the way is a failure. For a long time, I have trained this kind of &quot;vigilant awareness&quot; and will adjust at any time during the writing process, so I have never failed in particular after finishing writing. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xiaofan: &lt;/strong>;If a writer has complicated social affairs, it may have a negative impact on his writing. If a writer is distracted too much, it may affect the quality and progress of his writing. However, some writers try their best to manage their social affairs, such as delegating assistants or seeking professional management services, to better balance their time and energy to stay focused and productive. How do you balance your creative work with other commitments such as teaching, public service, social or family life? &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wang Xiumei:&lt;/strong>;Focus and efficiency are different types. It can be concentration over a longer period of time or concentration over fragmented periods of time. Human beings are social animals and must inevitably embrace life diligently, actively and enthusiastically. When you don’t have a lot of time, you need to train yourself to control fragmented time. The ability to seize and control time varies from person to person. Time is mysterious, every moment is mysterious, and must not be underestimated. I don’t think that things other than writing are burdens. They are not burdens, but living life.我时常告诉自己，我们都应该像赫拉巴尔学习：生活，生活，生活，投入无论哪种生活。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;小饭：&lt;/strong>;是这样的，用一个艺术家朋友的说法，&amp;ldquo;生活最伟大&amp;rdquo;。我记得您曾说&amp;ldquo;电影、戏剧、音乐、绘画，都有各自改造时间的方式，而小说比之于以上艺术门类，在改造时间的手段上更为丰富。 &amp;rdquo;而我一个朋友说打游戏和看电影读小说很像，都是留出一段生命时间给某个创作者，跟着ta的视角走一段路，在ta的感受基础上体验一段旅程。您认可这句话吗？游戏与您提到的艺术门类相提并论，是否让你感觉到很意外？ &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;王秀梅：&lt;/strong>;我认可，也并不觉得意外。实际上我是一个兴趣爱好极为广泛的人。熟悉我的朋友都知道，我是一个好厨师。我还是资深美剧追随者。电影，音乐，虽然不那么精通，也有自己的坚持和口味。我经常做一些手工，比如用各种玉绳和弹力绳编各种小东西，它们让我深深迷醉。我研究各类玉石十多年并有一定的鉴赏力。我的父亲当年不借助任何仪器在大山里找到黄金矿脉，而且可以把一块矿石拿在手里仅凭肉眼就准确估算出含金量。他是一个传奇的人，我想我可能遗传了他在这方面的某些能力。一个兴趣广博的人，可能天然地对很多事物具有包容力，所以我不像别的家长那样仇视孩子玩游戏，当然要给他规定时间。当儿子跟我讲某个游戏世界大赛结果的时候，我也会津津有味地倾听。我知道，开发游戏的那些年轻人，他们也相当努力，那是他们的事业和追求，就像作家把写作当成事业一样。当然，游戏随身携带着它的负面东西，这是另外一个角度的问题，此处不谈。但你朋友说的那种&amp;ldquo;跟着创作者的视角走一段路&amp;rdquo;我很认可，也觉得这个观点很别致，我很喜欢。小说也是这样，读者在跟着我们的视角走过我们设定的这段路。从性质上来说，它们是一样的。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;小饭：&lt;/strong>;最后，您有什么建议或鼓励想要成为作家的年轻人吗？投身写作事业，对现在的年轻人来说会有一个好&amp;ldquo;前程&amp;rdquo;吗？对一个年轻人来说，好的&amp;ldquo;前程&amp;rdquo;里面有一些什么样的内容？ &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;王秀梅：&lt;/strong>;年轻人要做好充分的准备，那就是付出无数的时间和心血，但有可能得不到世俗意义上的&amp;ldquo;前程&amp;rdquo;，还会让自己陷入一些情绪的坑里。焦虑，不平，跌宕起伏。至于精神和理想方面的&amp;ldquo;前程&amp;rdquo;，马尔克斯、托尔斯泰、蒲松龄、李白，毕竟是少数中的少数，年轻人要做好准备做&amp;ldquo;无限多数&amp;rdquo;中的一员。如果不想什么&amp;ldquo;前程&amp;rdquo;，问题就简单多了，那就只余下纯粹的文学的无限奥妙、写作的快乐和快乐的烦恼了。这种前提下的&amp;ldquo;前程&amp;rdquo;，包括太多太多，以我为例，我觉得包括如下：一生中能阅读到那么多令我膜拜的大师，他们改变我，修改我，让我丰富。我留下了一些文字，来这世上走一遭的不仅仅是我的肉体。 &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;责任编辑：梅不谈&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;本文首发于《山东文学》。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;相关推荐&lt;/p>; &lt;hr/>; &lt;table>; &lt;tr>; &lt;td style=&quot;width: 40px;&quot;>; &lt;span>;阅读&lt;/span>; &lt;/td>; &lt;td>; &lt;a href=&quot;/article/6101&quot; data-ajax=&quot;false&quot;>; &lt;div>;后台谈话｜笛安：必须勇敢，勇敢且自由&lt;/div>; &lt;div>;文/ 小饭、笛安&lt;/div>; &lt;/a>; &lt;/td>; &lt;/tr>; &lt;tr>; &lt;td style=&quot;width: 40px;&quot;>; &lt;span>;阅读&lt;/span>; &lt;/td>; &lt;td>; &lt;a href=&quot;/article/6075&quot; data-ajax=&quot;false&quot;>; &lt;div>;后台谈话｜田耳：相对于无意义，我对有意义更为谨慎&lt;/div>; &lt;div>;文/ 小饭、田耳&lt;/div>; &lt;/a>; &lt;/td>; &lt;/tr>; &lt;/table>; &lt;table>; &lt;tr>; &lt;td>; &lt;div style=&quot;text-align:center;padding:5px;&quot; onclick=&quot;OneAPP.openDetail(2,6106)&quot;>;点击可下载ONE一个app&lt;/div>;&lt;/td>; &lt;/tr>; &lt;/table>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 06 Oct 2023 06:25:02 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[VOL.4017]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://m.wufazhuce.com/one/4159]]><description>&lt;div>;6 Oct. 2023&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;main&quot;>; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;http://image.wufazhuce.com/Fjg73G35YzXhhr7CzSZYyryuYHU4&quot; alt=&quot;首页图&quot; />; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;VOL.4017&lt;/span>;摄影| Markus Spiske&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;6&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Oct. 2023&lt;/p>; &lt;div>;&lt;/div>; &lt;p>;越在意的人，越是绝口不提。我选择你，做内心深处的秘密。来日有人剖开这颗心来，里面除了你，什么都没有。&lt;/p>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 06 Oct 2023 06:25:02 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
