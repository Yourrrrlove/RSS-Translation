By late spring, the sentimental atmosphere of farewell has begun to fill the campus. Needless to say, taking graduation photos and having a farewell banquet are all routine operations. After the big dinner with classmates, there was a small dinner in the dormitory, where everyone gathered together to eat hot pot and drink beer. Everything is lively, immersed in the sensory stimulation brought by wine and meat. &lt;strong>;We all know that after graduation, classmates will be scattered all over the world and it will be difficult to see each other again. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The graduation season is &quot;a farewell feast that is publicized in advance&quot;. Various agreed-upon rituals take turns intensifying the melancholy in our hearts. However, after all, they are still young and have infinite longing for the future. &lt;strong>;We attended the banquet non-stop, essentially not to say goodbye, but to give our youth and college career memories to look back on. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;However, many years later, when I think back on the graduation season, where I ate, what I ate, what I drank, and what I said, I don’t remember it at all. , leaving only vague and noisy shadows in my mind. The youthful faces of the classmates were also blurred. The best friend in the same dormitory, who was so good that he wore a pair of pants, also gradually lost contact with him as time went by. The two parties do not live in the same city and have their own social circles, so they both need to make great efforts to cope with their own lives. Naturally, friendship turned into a silent avatar on WeChat. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Strictly speaking, this silent friendship is not parting. After all, there is still the possibility of reunion in the future, such as the 50th anniversary of graduation. &lt;strong>;Life is a process of gathering and breaking up, breaking up and gathering again, and you will meet different people at each stage. &lt;/strong>;Most of the time, we will not realize that the &quot;real parting&quot; is coming, we will only feel that &quot;it was just ordinary at that time&quot;. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;After leaving school, I first went to Beijing and then to Shanghai. Like a person who is not familiar with water, I plunged into the torrent of the times. Submitting resumes, looking for jobs, and running between rental houses and companies every day. The buses and subways in the morning and evening rush hours are like sardine cans, with people crowded together and arms touching arms. Only when I lower my head to scroll through my phone do I feel so free. One day, when I was on my way home from get off work, a message suddenly popped up in the class group. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;L is gone. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Gone? &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;I heard it was suicide. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Is it true or false? &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The students were discussing in a flurry of conversations. L is a bright and cheerful girl who always has a smile on her face. During her four years in college, she got along quite well with her classmates. She also had a smile on her face during her graduation photos, and almost no one noticed her sadness. When she left school, no one believed that they would never see her again. When we left school, we both believed that although we were going in different directions, we would meet again one day in the future. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The river of time flows slowly. L&#39;s departure finally felt like a stone falling to the bottom of the water. The ripples caused gradually subsided. I still go to get off work and get off work, get married and have children, and live my life like the crowd. Sometimes, my mother would call and talk about an old man in the village who had passed away in a homely way. In my impression, the old people are still in good health. When they return home during the New Year, their greetings full of local accents still ring in my ears. From now on, it is impossible to meet again. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Parting naturally requires a ceremony. If you can realize the separation, who wouldn&#39;t want to hold a ceremony with great fanfare. This is to leave a trace in life for yourself and others. It&#39;s just that&lt;strong>;in our long life, we don&#39;t realize or notice most of the partings. &lt;/strong>;By the time we realize it, the real parting has already happened. It was too late for us to hold a farewell ceremony. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;In the vast life, only &quot;this feeling can be remembered&quot;. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;/p>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;Editor in charge: Zhou Ziheng onewenti@wufazhuce.com&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Please see @ONE Studio’s pinned Weibo for information on the call for papers.

They are animals at first. , and later turned into another self. In the process of heading to the city, the contradiction between the two selves becomes increasingly acute and cannot be avoided. The only choice is to return to the village and walk into the same body. &lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h1>;1. The courtyard door is locked&lt;/h1>;&lt;p>;One night many years ago, a look suddenly fell on my face. weight. My parents gathered together at the bedside again and looked at the ten-year-old me for a long time. They didn&#39;t know I was pretending to sleep. From time to time I would talk in my sleep, imagining what a sleeping person should look like, and act out it with all my heart. I deceived them who were unwary. They retreated to the middle of the room, sat down gently on the wooden benches, and continued to talk about those misty words. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;They were discussing my future and were always worried about their kind-hearted but cowardly son. That night, they were not tired. An oil lamp was on for a long time, and the whole house became shaky. That night seemed extremely long, and I felt the time that I had never paid attention to for a long time. They were flowing, and I seemed to be floating on a river I had never met before. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Huer. &amp;rdquo;My father called my nickname, but I remained silent and continued to pretend to sleep. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Many small sounds hidden in life were amplified by silence: the dry wooden cabinet in the house made a loud noise, which made me tremble; a bamboo curtain hung on the door of the house, dividing the night and Some flying insects blocked the courtyard, and some large beetles were banging against the bamboo curtains; a mouse passed through the firewood pile in the courtyard, leaving behind a scratching sound and a piercing scream; the soil outside the village There was a tinkling sound of bells on the road, and the horse&#39;s hooves hitting the road felt like a heavy blow to my head. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;My parents don’t care about these voices that will be ignored if they don’t pay attention. The things they discuss are much bigger than these. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;It must be a different scene in the yard. I guessed that the light of the oil lamp was leaking straight into the yard from the door of the house, and the Jixing Tower on the roof of the tile roof must have been inserted among the stars. On a moonless night, those stars would appear more dense, right? &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;(①Jixing Tower: a porcelain decorative component on the ridge of a tiled house in the author&#39;s village, used to pray for blessings and ward off evil spirits.)&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I can&#39;t remember what it is. It&#39;s the season, maybe it&#39;s a summer night. I continued to listen with my ears pricked up, and the sound of my parents&#39; conversation became quieter and quieter. After a while, I really fell asleep while pretending to be asleep. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;It was another morning when I opened my eyes again. The parents were gone, but the two small wooden benches in the middle of the room seemed to still be warm. The sun shines on me through the window, bathing me in warmth. A new day has arrived, and the whole village is waiting for me. When I walk out of the house, a village has its protagonist. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I got up and walked into the yard. The black dog looked up at me in the yard with a perfunctory look. I was a little unhappy, so I picked up a wooden stick for self-defense and swung it hard. The black dog turned around suddenly, shook his head and sneezed loudly, causing the chickens next to him to jump away in fright. All the animals in the yard are tied to a rope, and one sound will trigger a series of sounds. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;As expected, the courtyard door was locked by the parents again. When they went to work in the fields, they always locked me in my house while I was awake, and some animals that had no time to go out were also locked in their homes. I have a key to the courtyard door. When I want to go out, I need to wait for a person passing by in the alley so that I can throw the key out and ask that person to help open the courtyard door. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;That day was a little unusual. No one walked through the alley all morning. I seemed to hear some footsteps, but they all drifted away. I could only wander around the yard, and the animals followed me around the yard. A leaf fell down, turned over a few times in the air, and landed quietly on a grapevine, making people feel that autumn is coming. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;My parents returned home just before noon. When they opened the courtyard door, they saw a rare scene: a group of animals surrounded me. I was carrying a wooden stick for self-defense. It seemed like their leader was standing there. Be prepared to lead them out of the yard. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The animals can’t wait to get out. Before I could move, the goat ran out of the yard before me and ran to the grassland in the east of the village. The sheep are already familiar with the road and the endless grassland. I followed closely and walked out of the courtyard. Following closely behind me were a dog and a group of chickens... In the blink of an eye, the entire yard became empty. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Huer. &amp;rdquo;My mother called me from behind. I paused deliberately and turned my head, only to see her open mouth. I can’t remember what she said to me again. When I turned around and walked out of the house, I could still feel the gaze on my back lingering for a long time. My father didn’t talk to me. He never took the initiative to ask me. He always pretended to sort out the randomly placed farm tools in the yard. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;After walking out of the house, I said to myself, take two steps. The sheep had run far away, and seemed to have entered the lush grassland to the east of the village. The sheep will not move at will after being immersed in that green patch of grass, which stretches to another village in the distance. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I accidentally saw a flower. When I walked into the grass, I suddenly saw it. It was blown by a gust of wind and nodded towards me. I mistakenly thought it was saying hello to me, so I walked towards it slowly. I don’t know what its scientific name is. The dialect the villagers call it cannot be written in words. Its flowers looked like the sun shining from a distance. I wanted to give it a name, but after thinking about it I decided to forget it. I am still a teenager and the village does not belong to me yet, so naturally it will not be my turn to name a flower. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I sat under the shade of a tree and began to enjoy an idle afternoon, looking towards the village and into the distance. Many little bugs began to crawl on me, treating me like a tree or a mountain. I fell asleep under that tree, and when I woke up, I saw the goat standing in front of me blankly. It had been staring at me for a long time, with an unhappy look on its face. More often than not, it would walk back to the yard alone, leaving me alone under the tree, and what would wake me up would be the last ray of sunshine of the day. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;No one likes walking in the dark. I can always walk back to the village in a panic before the night arrives. I was still underage and needed a yard to hide my body and my wild imagination. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;On another afternoon, I saw a middle-aged man sleeping casually under a tree. That day, I suddenly wanted to know what I looked like in the eyes of a sheep, so I imitated the appearance of a sheep and stood in front of the middle-aged man for a long time. His bicycle was leaning against a tree, and on the back of the bicycle he carried two baskets covered with white cloth. The baskets probably contained medicinal materials to be sold at the market. He might have been riding from a strange village, but he just ran out of energy when he arrived under this tree. Seeing no one around, he fell into a daydream. I saw a short period of time in his life. The sun illuminated half of his body, the shadows of the trees slowly swayed on him, and the grasshopper jumped on his collar and jumped into a piece of grass in an instant. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;For the first time, I observed a stranger for a long time and guessed something about him. He shook his body and went back to sleep. I didn’t want to waste the whole afternoon standing in front of him, so I left him alone under the tree and continued walking towards the wilderness to the east of the village. That afternoon, my head was filled with the shaking shadow of that person. The sun was about to set, and when I turned back to the village, the trees were already empty, and he had already moved on. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The shadow of that middle-aged man has been shaking in my head for many years. His face changes every once in a while, and the memories begin to randomly collage the faces of many people on it. I began to wonder if my younger self had actually experienced that unremarkable afternoon. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I continue to recall, the young father began to stand at the end of a road, scolding the young me under the sky full of smoke. I seemed to have made a serious mistake. I was lowering my head hard and didn&#39;t dare to make a sound. The yard full of apricot flowers gradually fell into dusk, and the surrounding scene could no longer be seen clearly, but the fragrance of the flowers became stronger. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The next day, my annoying father sold my goat and never gave me any work from then on. He liked to lock me in his house all day long. From then on, I had the ability to play two roles, and I fell in love with talking to myself. I would say an insignificant sentence, then take two steps forward, turn around, and imitate the tone of an adult. Pick up the conversation. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;When no one is home, I like to climb on the roof. At sunset, when the footsteps of my parents returning home sounded in the alley, I hurriedly walked down a wooden ladder back to the yard, ran into the house and read loudly the article I had already read. The sound of reading quickly filled the palm-sized yard. . &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;My father pushed open the door of the house and emphasized to me again, saying: &quot;Hu&#39;er, there is no more work for you in the village.&quot; &amp;rdquo;The look seemed to say that the village no longer needs me. I couldn&#39;t carry it on my shoulders or lift it with my hands, and I felt like I had become a redundant person... Recalling this, I stopped writing in my hand. Now, I am sitting in a high-rise building. The bustling city lights outside the window are bright, the streets are full of flowing light, and the people after get off work are hurrying like a group of exhausted sardines. Last week, I went back to my hometown and heard the old people in the village call me &quot;Hu&#39;er&quot;. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;After leaving the village, no one called me &quot;Hu&#39;er&quot; again. &quot;Hu&#39;er&quot; stayed in that village and decided not to grow up. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;h1>;2. Young Tiger&lt;/h1>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Tiger! &quot;&quot; is what the people in the village call me. The moment you left the village with your baggage on your back at the age of eighteen, you left this name to me at the age of ten. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;You walked along the road without looking back at the house where we grew up together. Mother stands at the entrance of the village and looks from afar, letting the wind see you off for her. The wind is an unreliable thing and is good at confusing people. People who walk with the wind can easily go astray and enter unknown dreams. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;As the days passed, I suddenly discovered an incredible fact. I seemed to have stopped growing taller and would always look like ten years old. Then I realized that my life was not real, but just living with you. in a dream. My life is still made up of countless repetitive fragments, which is boring; you have no friends in the city. So, we became close friends. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;After leaving the village, you slowly grew stronger in a city. I have never seen the streets of the city. All my knowledge of the city comes from your narration in dreams. You also feel that life is boring, and you start to suffer from insomnia frequently during the feasting nights. When you wake up every night, you feel strange that the building blocks the wind and the moon is always hiding. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;It is suitable to look far away when you are lonely, but it is easy to break your heart when you look far away. When winter comes, you first think of the appearance of a sycamore tree in the yard that has lost all its leaves; when spring comes, you see your father carrying farm tools from home into the gradually brightening wilderness; you will also see me, watching Come and feed a big goat with us. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Father is also living in your dream, he does not know your existence. For a while, my father noticed something strange and liked to look at me sleeping for a long time at night. He wanted me to grow up quickly, not knowing that you had been out of the village for many years. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Many old people have passed away, many children have been born in the village, and the crops have alternated between green and yellow many times. I have always wanted to tell you about the changes in the village, and I have always wanted to shout out to you. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;How should I call you? I have never been able to come up with a satisfactory title, and I think you are also troubled by the same problem. We have twice as much life experience as others, but we can’t even think of a name for each other. Will we be laughed at by others? &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Last week, you finally returned to our old home. No one knows what you are looking for. The house is dilapidated, the yard is old, and the grass at the base of the wall is up to your knees. You stand in the yard, looking around for a stick from many years ago. You are destined to be disappointed. At this moment, the wooden stick is tightly held in my hand - it is still my weapon of self-defense. With it, the animals in the village will be a little wary of me. They will stop a few steps away from me and look at me cautiously. It&#39;s something important to me that you may not need anymore. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;You stretched out your feet several times before you stepped onto the roof with confidence. You had begun to doubt whether the roof could still bear your weight. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Night fell again, and the whole yard was once again covered in the chirping of insects. I want to find a more secluded place to hide, but where is a more secluded place? You know the places I know, and you know my thoughts. We will inevitably meet on a roof covered with dead leaves. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;At that moment, I walked into your body. After more than thirty years of separation, we finally merged into one body again. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;When an adult has the heart of a child in his body, crying is natural. &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;Editor-in-charge: Mei Butan&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Please see the @ONE studio pinned Weibo for information on the call for papers.
