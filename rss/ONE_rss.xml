PUA and emotional blackmail&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;To be honest, the word PUA has been widely abused in the past two years. When parents often suppress their children, they say they are parent-child PUAs. When their bosses accuse their subordinates, they say they are workplace PUAs. When couples quarrel and refuse to give in, they say they are PUAs who want to control themselves. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;PUA (pick-up artist) does exist, but PUA mostly only uses methods such as pretending to be high-value to attract pie, chatting and flirting, providing positive emotions, and moral kidnapping in short-term relationships, so that they can A speculator who advances a relationship quickly and obtains sexual or financial benefits from it. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;PUAs that can control people to commit suicide by using so-called five-step traps and other PUA magic techniques exist in theory, but in reality, the cases of depression or even suicide that we see are not What PUA does is the result of &lt;strong>;more dangerous, emotional blackmail&lt;/strong>;, or, in other words, it is the result of some people who are accustomed to emotional blackmail in their relationships learning PUA techniques. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;It is difficult to distinguish PUA from emotional blackmail based on behavior alone. The two behaviors are very similar. &lt;strong>;Common behaviors are as follows:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>; If he is unhappy, he will yell at you, say harsh words, or hide&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;to&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;sulk;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>; I&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;have a&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;strongly possessive&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>; desire for you and interfere with your every move;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/strong>; p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Look down on your opinions&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;,&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Belittle your achievements;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Think you&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>; strong>;&lt;strong>;is the&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;culprit that causes all the&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;problems;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;with confidence Intervene in your life;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Ignore and deny your feelings. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;So to distinguish whether a person is a PUA or an emotional blackmailer, you cannot just look at behavior, but you must look at&lt;strong>;motivation and emotional stability in combination with the interaction model. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;A real PUA is an actor, with a clear purpose of profit, and a free and easy mood. Therefore, there are clear demands behind his actions, as long as you satisfy his demands. , he will adjust his behavior as reinforcement, and rarely lose control of his behavior and emotions to the point of hysteria. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;People who engage in emotional blackmail often do not have clear demands behind their actions. They just want to vent their emotions. Even if you try to satisfy his demands, he will not adjust his behavior accordingly, and his emotions will often get out of control. . &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;For this reason, in comparison, emotional blackmail causes greater harm to a partner than PUA. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;PUA’s behavior was self-aware&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;intentional&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;,&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong >;There are traces to follow and the mood is stable; while the behavior of emotional blackmail is an unintentional act that lacks self-&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;knowledge&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;and is unorganized and often emotionally out of control&lt;/strong>; &lt;strong>;. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;PUAs know that they are doing bad things, so they will have a sense of guilt, guilt, and fear, and their behavior will be controlled and they will do things in a measured manner. Moreover, any normal social girl with some social experience can easily see through the crappy scam of PUA. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Although people who suffer from emotional blackmail are objectively hurting their partners, subjectively they firmly believe that they are maintaining the relationship and doing it for the good of their partners. Therefore, it is often easy to lose control and cause injury to themselves or their partners. Even if someone is killed and their partner is hurt, they will not be able to get rid of it easily because they truly feel their &quot;love&quot; for them. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;2. The root of emotional blackmail&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Why do emotionally blackmailed partners have such deformed &quot;love&quot; &amp;rdquo;What about a person’s way? &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;This needs to be explained in conjunction with the typical behavioral patterns of emotional blackmailers. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Emotional blackmailers have nine ways to blackmail their partners: violence, verbal attacks, cynicism, pretending to be stupid, not allowed to cry out, punishment, self-punishment, victim mentality, and false promises&lt; /strong>;&lt;strong>;. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;1. Threat of violence&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;As long as you don’t follow his way, he will develop violent tendencies, such as yelling at you Yelling, smashing things, slamming doors, clenching fists, banging on tables, etc. Although he may not attack you at the moment, his behavior conveys this message to you: &quot;If you do this again next time, I will not be polite to you.&quot; &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;2. Verbal attack&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;He needs to suppress you to demonstrate his power in order to establish a sense of &quot;I am right and you are wrong.&quot; &quot;, so you have to listen to me&quot; relationship. He will frequently accuse you of various things you do, such as &quot;Buy, buy, buy, just know how to buy, sooner or later this family will be ruined by you&quot;, &quot;You actually accepted his gift, what a lewd stinker.&quot; &quot;Bitch&quot;, &quot;If you can&#39;t do this, what use do you think you have?&quot; &amp;rdquo;. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;3. Sarcasm&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Sometimes he will not take the initiative to attack you, but will express his dissatisfaction through a weird attitude and an unhappy face. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;If you take him to your idol&#39;s concert, he will not want to accompany you, so he will constantly pick on your idol and mock the audience for being so excited that they look like idiots. . &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;4. Pretending to be stupid&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In order to avoid being accused by you, he will not admit any facts that are not good for him, or he will tamper with them. In fact, either they accuse you of being petty, such as &quot;I didn&#39;t yell at you. It was you who brought your best friend to our date without permission. I have already forgiven you, but I didn&#39;t expect you to still do it.&quot; It’s hard to get over being so petty and petty by bringing up old things again.” &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;5. Don’t cry out in pain&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;They do not allow you to complain when you are wronged, nor do they allow you to feel sad and uncomfortable, such as &quot;Ouch&quot; , you can’t help but say, then I won’t tell you about your problems in the future, you can fend for yourself.”, “You just can’t listen to criticism from others, you have a glass heart.” &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;6.&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;&amp;nbsp;Punishment&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;After deciding that you &quot;made a mistake&quot;, does he ask you to change? Instead, it requires you to impose self-punishment for your mistake. If your punishment is not strong enough, he will give you more punishment suggestions to make you hurt yourself. For example, &quot;You take ten nude photos for me to make me believe that you will never chat with other people&quot;, &quot;You have to take a sex video with me to make me forgive you.&quot; &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;7.&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;&amp;nbsp;Self-punishment&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;They also punish themselves, but not because they realize they are wrong Just to control you better. For example, &quot;If you don&#39;t agree to get back together with me, I will slit my wrists to show you, and I will post on WeChat to let everyone know that I died because of you.&quot;, &quot;I am taking sleeping pills now, good night, I will still find you in the next life. You&amp;rdquo;. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;8.&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;&amp;nbsp;Victim mentality&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;They will often be in pain and unable to solve their pain, Asking you to address his pain. For example, &quot;It&#39;s really painful that you can&#39;t give me a sense of security. Can you disfigure me to make me feel at ease?&quot; ”, “If it weren’t for you, there would be no need for me to go to the company and suffer this kind of anger! Why don&#39;t you care about me! &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;9.&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;&amp;nbsp;False promises&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In order to ease their emotions, they will give something they cannot Fulfilled promises, that is, giving promises, are not a reflection of their determination to change themselves, but a strategy and a delaying tactic for them to control their partners. For example, &quot;As long as you give me all your money, I promise to delete these women from WeChat immediately&quot;, &quot;As long as you and your parents ask for 600,000 to come up with the down payment, I promise to do it for the rest of my life.&quot; Hello&amp;rdquo;. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The reason why emotional blackmailers have so many motivations and strategies to control others is because their caregivers have controlled them in this way since childhood. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Their caregivers would intimidate their young children by breaking things, which is &lt;strong>;violence&lt;/strong>;;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Their caregivers would say, &amp;ldquo;You are A bad guy, the family business is getting worse and worse as soon as he is born. This is a &lt;strong>;verbal attack&lt;/strong>;;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Their caregivers will say, &quot;Come on, it&#39;s you. If If you can succeed, then all the beggars downstairs will get rich.&quot; This is &lt;strong>;cynicism&lt;/strong>;;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Their caregivers will say, &quot;It&#39;s because you are ignorant, so we Hit you! This is &quot;our love and responsibility&quot;, this is &lt;strong>;acting stupid&lt;/strong>;;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Their caregivers will say, &quot;Just say a few words and you will be like this,&quot; I won’t care about you from now on, I don’t have such a useless child like you.” This is &lt;strong>;Don’t cry out in pain&lt;/strong>;;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Their caregivers will say, “You are today If you don&#39;t copy this text a hundred times, you won&#39;t be allowed to sleep! &amp;rdquo;, this is&lt;strong>;punishment&lt;/strong>;;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Their caregivers will say, &amp;ldquo;If you dare to play games after school again, I will kill myself in front of you.&amp;rdquo;, this is&lt; strong>;Self-punishment&lt;/strong>;;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Their caregivers will say, &quot;If it weren&#39;t for making money for you to study, why would we work so hard?&quot; &amp;rdquo;, this is &lt;strong>;victim mentality&lt;/strong>;;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Their caregivers will say, &quot;As long as you pass the exam this time, I won&#39;t stop you from playing games in the future.&quot; ;, this is&lt;strong>;false promise&lt;/strong>;. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;You may feel that the lines in it are somewhat familiar. Indeed, most of us have actually been hurt by our parents&#39; unintentional emotional blackmail. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;However, the lucky thing for most of us is that either our genes can tolerate bad environments, or our parents will give us a lot of correct love in addition to emotional blackmail, or in addition to being caregivers, There are other elders who really care about us and give us love, so we can get along with our partners in the relationship and learn the correct way to get along with them, with a little bit of the bad habit of emotional blackmail. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The unfortunate thing about people with emotional blackmail is that their genes determine that their personality is easily affected by the environment, and the early environment created by their caregivers is basically only emotional blackmail and rarely true love. , coupled with the lack of care from other elders, they can only use this wrong way of love to hurt others and themselves. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;3. How to deal with emotional blackmailers&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;If you are unfortunate enough to If you encounter a partner who is emotionally blackmailing, you need to focus on self-protection first rather than rescuing the blackmailer. You need to first evaluate whether the relationship has threatened you and whether you can reverse it with your own abilities. A pathological way of getting along. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Here I will provide a simple way to distinguish between high and low levels of emotional blackmail. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;1. Characteristics of a healthy relationship: The other person respects your thoughts and feelings, accepts your family and friends, has confidence in you, and recognizes your abilities&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>; &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;When a relationship has these characteristics, congratulations, you are in a healthy intimate relationship. Even if each other occasionally engages in emotional blackmail, it will not destroy the relationship, just like most people. Everyone&#39;s body is prone to ailments and pains, and sometimes noisy relationships are quite viable, so there&#39;s no need to be too afraid of emotional blackmail, as long as you learn to communicate and get along well, and maintain a long-term relationship. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;2. Emotional existence&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Characteristics of blackmail: the other party cannot accept any rejection from you, hinders your interaction with family and friends, and belittles you thoughts, mocking you in public, checking your&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;private social messages, asking for private photos or videos&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;When a relationship has these characteristics, you need to start to be vigilant, communicate more with family and friends, ask them what they think of the relationship, and try to take anti-blackmail measures (see below for details) ) to carry out self-protection and guide the other party to psychological counseling or emotional counseling. If the self-protection is ineffective and the other party is unwilling to seek counseling, then you have to start thinking about breaking away from the relationship to protect yourself. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;3. Characteristics of serious emotional blackmail: When you point out problems in the relationship, he will humiliate and laugh at you, thinking you are irrational. , lose control of your emotions when encountering something unpleasant, or threaten suicide, physical violence, or threaten with private photos or videos. You are prohibited from contacting others&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;When a relationship has these characteristics, you must take immediate anti-blackmail measures. If the other person is unwilling to cooperate, then don’t hesitate any longer, and don’t say whether you love her or not. Tell your relatives and friends around you and ask them to help you get out of this relationship. If necessary, you may even consider calling the police. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;If you are sure that your partner&#39;s emotional blackmail is within your control, take the following anti-blackmail measures to protect yourself. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;1. Rewrite the &quot;blame-exonerate-blame&quot; script&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Think about it, here is Isn’t it a scene that often appears in your lives? &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;After he came back from work, he found that dinner was not cooked, so he accused you of being incompetent. You were anxious to excuse yourself and said: &quot;I was very tired all day, and I couldn&#39;t take care of so much.&quot; &quot;, and then this sentence becomes the target for the other party to attack you again, &quot;How can you be as tired as me when you are tired? I work hard all day long, but when I get home I don’t even have a bite to eat. I really don’t know why I married you.” &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The daily smoke of gunpowder was thus aroused. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;When many people who please people face an emotionally blackmailing partner, they are always frightened by the negative emotions of the other person, and then they start to explain and apologize. But in fact, the reason why the other person has so many and strong negative emotions is because he is weaker and more afraid than you. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;He is worried that he will lose you and that he cannot take care of himself. Because he is desperate, he needs to pretend to be strong to control you. Therefore, you don&#39;t need to be frightened by his anger. The more angry he is, the weaker he is inside. You will not be hurt by such a weak person. Instead, you have to become a rational adult to guide him. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;When he accuses and attacks you for no reason, don’t rush to excuse yourself. Try to agree with part of what he said, and then calmly discuss with him how to solve it. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;If he accuses you of not cooking, you can respond like this: I really didn’t have time to cook dinner today (agree), let’s go out to a restaurant tonight (resolve), everyone is tired, let’s go and have a meal of. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;As long as you don’t take his attacks seriously and coax him as a coquettish child, you can avoid many conflicts. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;2. Express rejection when he is emotional&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Usually when he yells at you , when he accuses you in a barrage, in the past you might have retorted a few words first, and then cried in front of him when you were really wronged. Such a cooperative attitude will only make him get worse, so please &lt;strong>;pluck up the courage and be righteous. Strictly express your rejection to him. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;I’m not here to listen to you yelling, you can tell me what you want me to do&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;You can’t yell at me, like this It will make me not want to communicate even more&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Even if you tear your throat, it will not help solve the problem&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;We will discuss this again when you calm down. Question, I won’t respond to you now&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;After finishing speaking, go back to your room and lock the door. No matter how he curses or threatens outside, or turns into crying or pleading, nothing will happen. Ignore him until he calms down completely. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;If you are worried that you can&#39;t bear it and want to be completely clean, you can leave home first, go back to your parents&#39; house, or stay at a friend&#39;s house temporarily. During this period, do not answer his calls or reply to him. any news until he expresses serious remorse and takes action. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;3. Strengthen his positive &lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;contribution to you&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p >;&lt;p>;Even a man who seems to be useless like this will occasionally do a few things correctly, and at this time he needs to be rewarded. For example, when you carefully prepare for your anniversary, when you take time out of your busy schedule to spend time with your children, when you read carefully and take notes in order to correct your own problems. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;You can use the following sentences to express your feelings to reinforce his correct behavior:&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;● I really appreciate it when you cook seriously. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;● Thank you for preparing this gift so carefully. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;● I like it when you are in a happy mood and naughty like a child. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;● It’s nice of you to spend time with me. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;● When you said you loved me, I was really happy. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The seemingly powerful emotional blackmailer is actually extremely fragile inside and lacks recognition. Therefore, when he does the right thing, the recognition you give him is not only satisfying his needs, but also Guide him to pay correctly. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;After you take the above anti-blackmail measures, if the other party can respect your need for self-protection and is willing to change his usual emotional consuming behavior pattern for you, then the relationship will develop in the right direction. . &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;If you have taken anti-blackmail measures, but the other party still ignores your thoughts and feelings, and has no sincerity in wanting to solve the problem together, then I advise you to save your life first. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;A bad relationship has a far-reaching impact on a person beyond our imagination. Regardless of whether the other party in the relationship is due to a personality defect, a PUA, or a control mode learned from the family of origin, the emotional blackmailer is a vampire in the relationship. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Either change your response measures to influence the other person, or stick to the bottom line and give up the relationship, and don&#39;t let your life and life become a sacrifice to the vampire. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;You have to remember that you always have control over your feelings and don&#39;t have to be afraid of anyone. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;When you leave anyone, you are still yourself. &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;Editor in charge: Mei Butan onewenti@wufazhuce.com&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For the call for papers information, please see @ONE Studio pinned on Weibo. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Respondent&lt;/p>; &lt;hr/>; &lt;table>; &lt;tr>; &lt;td style=&quot;width: 50px;&quot;>; &lt;img src=&quot;http://image.wufazhuce.com/Fh_rAFN3IDcz2KT6BHHjGoD051Ge &quot; alt=&quot;Hong Sang&quot;>; &lt;/td>; &lt;td>; &lt;div>;Hong Sang&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10px&quot;>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div style=&quot;&quot;>;Psychology Consultant, WeChat public account: Hongsang&lt;/div>; &lt;/td>; &lt;td width=&quot;60px&quot;>; &lt;!-- &lt;span onclick=&quot;OneAPP.openDetail(4, )&quot;>;Follow&lt;/span>; -- >; &lt;/td>; &lt;/tr>; &lt;/table>; &lt;p>;Related recommendations&lt;/p>; &lt;hr/>; &lt;table>; &lt;tr>; &lt;td style=&quot;width: 40px;&quot;>; &lt;span>;Q&amp;A&lt;/span >; &lt;/td>; &lt;td>; &lt;a href=&quot;/question/3979&quot; data-ajax=&quot;false&quot;>; &lt;div>;Have you become a useful adult to the world? &lt;/div>; &lt;div style=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>; &lt;/a>; &lt;/td>; &lt;/tr>; &lt;tr>; &lt;td style=&quot;width: 40px;&quot;>; &lt;span>;Q&amp;A&lt;/span>; &lt; /td>; &lt;td>; &lt;a href=&quot;/question/3975&quot; data-ajax=&quot;false&quot;>; &lt;div>;The Year of Walking: How did &quot;relaxation&quot; become a luxury product? &lt;/div>; &lt;div style=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>; &lt;/a>; &lt;/td>; &lt;/tr>; &lt;/table>; &lt;table>; &lt;tr>; &lt;td>;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:center ;padding:5px;&quot; onclick=&quot;OneAPP.openDetail(4,3980)&quot;>;Click to download ONE app&lt;/div>;&lt;/td>; &lt;/tr>; &lt;/table>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 17 Nov 2023 06:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[漫长的回眸]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://m.wufazhuce.com/article/6165]]><description> &lt;div>;17 Nov. 2023&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;main&quot;>; &lt;div>; &lt;p>;Text/Wool Fox&lt;/p>; &lt;div>; &lt;p>;&lt;div contenteditable=&quot;false&quot;>;&lt;img data-author=&quot;&quot; data-original-src=&quot;http://image.wufazhuce.com/Fob_TgoLFmwZGPbhGWp2WifzzDIu&quot; data-source=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://image.wufazhuce.com/Fob_TgoLFmwZGPbhGWp2WifzzDIu&quot;>;&lt;/div >;&lt;div>;&lt;div style=&quot;font-size:26px;line-height: 1;&quot;>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;His business was cheated and he was forced to sell his house. Hao Shi experienced the ups and downs of his life and realized the various challenges. Kind of bitter and sad. However, what remains after adversity is precisely what is worth cherishing in life. &lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;1&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;My name is Hao Shidai , early this morning, my mother was sitting at the head of my bed, my back to her, and the quilt was tightly covered. My mother asked me how much I owed? I just say, don&#39;t bother. She asked, how much was owed? I say a lot. She got up and walked to the living room to explain something to my wife. I secretly poked my head out from under the quilt and saw only my mother holding a bunch of tissues in her hand and her slightly fat back. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Afterwards, after my mother and my wife finished talking, they stood back in front of the bedroom, woke up with runny nose, and said to sell the house. I replied heavily, &quot;Yeah!&quot; &amp;rdquo;, she left. When I was sure she was gone, I moved out of bed. I was still wearing the clothes I had worn when I went out. It should be said that I haven&#39;t taken them off since last night. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;There are egg pancakes and soy milk on the table in the living room. My wife said that my mother bought them. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I lit a cigarette. In fact, smoking is not allowed at home, but today my wife did not stop me and I smoked naturally, as if after I decided to sell the house, the house no longer belonged to me. The original rules have also lost their binding force. My wife and I said that since we have decided to sell our house, we should hurry up. Several agents at the door went to run around. But when we walked to the parking space, we were dumbfounded. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The parking space is empty and there are no cars. Where is my car? &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;At this time, I believed that the person who made the vehicle mortgage was not fooling me. There was a GPS hidden in the car. They drove the car away like thieves last night. But I didn&#39;t expect it to be so soon, three days overdue... I looked at my wife, a little confused. At the same time, she picked up her cell phone and dialed my mother-in-law&#39;s number. &quot;Mom, if something happens, come here quickly.&quot; &amp;rdquo;My wife just said this coldly on the phone and hung up. She walked straight home and I followed her silently, walking behind her for the first time in my life. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;My mother-in-law came not long after. I have always looked down on her because I always believed that my wife&#39;s single-parent childhood was caused by her indiscretions. Now she stood in front of me, only reaching my chest. But I didn&#39;t dare to look at her. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;How much do you want? &amp;rdquo;The mother-in-law asked calmly. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;One hundred thousand. &amp;rdquo;My wife interjected from the side. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;So, I saw my mother-in-law put down the small bag behind her and took out a plastic bag filled with cards and tied with a rubber band. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Find a place to brush it out. &amp;rdquo;The mother-in-law spoke softly. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I felt like the room was filled with water and I felt a little tight in my chest. I told her to go get the car and pay back the mother (mother-in-law) money when the house is sold. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Us? &amp;rdquo;My wife looked at me suspiciously. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I said it would be more efficient to act separately. I will go to the real estate agency to negotiate the price and list the property, and you will go to the company in the car. After saying that, my wife stared at me for three seconds, but it felt like three hours to me. Seeing that I was resolute, my wife and my mother-in-law left. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;For the first time, my wife has to take care of things at home by herself. This is not about buying groceries and paying utility bills. But I just want to send her away and be quiet at home for a while. When I was alone, I lay down again. My wife is six years younger than me, and they all say six punches. I don’t believe it, but she seems to be really out of luck. The &quot;Haojiamen&quot; group on WeChat has already exploded, and relatives all said they had received debt collection calls from me. They are now claiming that I am gambling. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I thought to myself that my business was similar to gambling. I just bet on an era and believed that the era would favor me, but it did not. Just when I was thinking wildly, the real estate mortgage company called, and I didn&#39;t dare to refuse the call. They told me that I was two weeks overdue and would take measures if I continued. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;After hanging up the phone, I called my mother again and asked if I could get 60,000 yuan first. My mother said that I have borrowed all the money at home in the past six months. I explained to her that the property mortgage had been notarized, and if it was forcibly auctioned by the court, the price would not be known, so I had to pay off this month&#39;s debt first, and I would try to sell the house within a month. My mother just said she would think of a solution. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;By the way, I also learned that the richest uncle in the family has blocked our family. He is an executive of the Shanghai Milk Company. He immediately distanced himself from my nephew, who was suspected of being a gambler. relation. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;But I didn’t have time to blame him. I quickly got up and walked out of the house. On the way out of the community, I looked around like a thief. In the past few days, there were many knocks on the door at home. The collection collectors all had very loud voices, and they could stand at the door and scream non-stop for more than half an hour. People used to say that Shanghainese want to save face, so I would refute others. Many years later, I left a message in the comment section of relevant information on the Internet: Shanghainese may want to save face. For example, I... there was a &quot;Lianjia Real Estate&quot; not far away, and I rushed in I shouted that I wanted to sell the house, and immediately a tall and thin man in a suit came to greet me. He asked me to sit down and brought me a cup of tea. I said directly, &quot;Let&#39;s go look at the house.&quot; &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;As soon as I entered the house, I started to introduce it nonstop. The agent listened politely and did not interrupt me. I just wanted to get a good price. After I talked about everything from the decoration to the details of the house, the agent smiled at me and said that I looked like an agent who leads people to buy houses. I smiled and told him that he had opened his own company to sell products and negotiated prices and sales personally. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The agent said something that extinguished my enthusiasm. He said that the house was at the market price and it was just a subsidy for decoration, up to an additional 50,000 yuan. But this decoration cost more than 300,000 yuan! The agent said he could only do his best. The agent also said that this 100-square-meter house in the outer ring of Shanghai could be sold for more than 3 million if you were patient. I said that I was very anxious now, and the agent rolled his eyes. If it was 2.8 million, he was confident. I waved my hand and said, &quot;List it and try to sell it for 2.9 million.&quot; He shook my hand and said, &quot;Mr. Hao, I will do my best.&quot; &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;When I went out, he handed me a cigarette and asked me if I owed a debt? I pretended to ask him how he knew, and he said that only people in debt would be so anxious. I said I didn&#39;t owe gambling debts, and he comforted me by saying that no one was in a trough, and then he discussed with me, don&#39;t let me find another agent, this house is easy to sell, and let him do this. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I agreed because he just called me Mr. Hao, and this performance must and can only be done by him. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;When it comes to talking, I still like others to call me Mr. Hao. My wife often teases me, when people call you Mr. Hao, it’s like a mistress calling you bed, and you can do anything. Those brands that let me purchase goods are like concubines in the harem calling you the emperor, and the little money you have is given to Yulu. All stained. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;After I finished my errands, I felt hungry. I sat down to eat breakfast, drank the already cold soy milk in one gulp, and after taking another nap, my wife and mother-in-law came back. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;It is noon. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;As soon as my wife came back, she spread out on the sofa. I saw that her nose was very red, so I didn’t know where to start and asked. The mother-in-law said straight away: &quot;Let’s eat first.&quot; &quot;While unpacking the take-out lunch, she explained that the car&#39;s debt had been paid off. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Huh? I sighed and started eating. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;You are not allowed to take a taxi anymore. My wife said this very strongly. She warned me that she would get divorced if the car was gone. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I said: &quot;Since when are you still worried about a car?&quot; &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The wife said: &amp;ldquo;I don’t care. &amp;rdquo;The words were cold. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I shut up. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;While eating, my mother-in-law explained the reason. She could only overdraft 50,000 on her credit card, and the remaining 50,000 was borrowed from her old neighbor. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Old Li Tou is a good man. said my mother-in-law. At this time, a picture of flesh-trading popped up in my mind, and I looked at my mother-in-law again, feeling uncomfortable in my heart. The mother-in-law seemed to understand the confusion in my eyes, and emphasized: &quot;Old Li Tou is such a good person.&quot; &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;After lunch, my mother-in-law cleans the house as a habit. My wife and I have been married for 6 years, and she stays at our house for one day every week, like a home nanny to help clean the house. I still remember that when I got married, I thought my wife’s rental house was too shabby, so I temporarily rented a large house as a place to welcome my wife. That day she called Lao Li Tou to pretend to be my wife&#39;s father and said not to make everyone laugh. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Mom, stop it, why are you sweeping it? &amp;rdquo;I snatched the broom from her hand and threw it into the toilet. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;My mother-in-law wiped the toilet again, told me to stop smoking, and left. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Front feet and rear feet. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;My mother called me and said, &quot;Dai Dai, the money will be transferred to your card now?&quot; &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I said: &amp;ldquo;No, the card has an automatic buckle attached to it, which is not safe. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Mom said: &amp;ldquo;I will send the card over now. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I said: &amp;ldquo;Stop running around here and there, I will get it. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Mom said: &amp;ldquo;Oh, the card password is my birthday. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I said: &amp;ldquo;When is your birthday? &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;My mother paused and replied: &amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;600912. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;After hanging up the phone, I asked my wife to go to my mother’s place to get the money. My wife said why don’t I go by myself. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Wouldn’t it bother you if a debtor came to your door? &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;How can you sell me? Everyone is refreshed. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Who are you selling it to? &amp;rdquo;I was a little angry: &amp;ldquo;Did you sell your mother? &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;As soon as I finished speaking, my wife slammed the door and left. The sound of the door closing made my heart tremble. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;2&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I didn’t expect that the agent could find the agent so quickly Home. The agent smiled at me and told me that houses in this area are easy to sell, and those who want to buy have to queue up. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;At around 7 o&#39;clock in the evening, my wife almost entered the house with the house watchers. She had already paid the 60,000 yuan in arrears to the housing loan company in the afternoon. I breathed a sigh of relief. That night, my wife and I watched the housekeepers walking around the house. A family of five came, two elderly people and a couple. The younger daughter-in-law stayed in the guest bedroom for a long time with her 2-year-old child in her arms, her face filled with joy. With a longing for the future. They were noisy speaking in dialects other than their own, and when they saw the old couple looking at the house like they were shopping for vegetables at the market, they couldn&#39;t help but ask, &quot;If you have any questions, feel free to ask them.&quot; &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The old lady said in bad Shanghainese that she was very satisfied with the room type and the decoration looked new. Needless to say, the price was just that she was worried about the disputes she heard about. Then he added the sentence softly: We are almost from Shanghai. I thought to myself, what does this have to do with me. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The intermediary interjected at this time, saying that other people sold their houses only when their business was in difficulty. After selling and getting money, the dispute was resolved. I responded to the intermediary and said confidently that the dispute was ultimately about money, and anything that could be solved with money was nothing. If you bought the house, I would have money, and the dispute would naturally be gone. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Who is willing to sell such a good house at this price? How can it be so cheap? &amp;rdquo;The agent raised his voice. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Then, the agent winked at me and said we should go out and smoke a cigarette together, so I walked out of the house with him and went outside the building. He told me straight to the point that his psychological price was 2.65 million. Seeing that I was just lowering my head and smoking, the agent said, &quot;Mr. Hao, if there hadn&#39;t been a dispute over your house, I would have given you at least 100,000 more.&quot; &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Is 270 okay? I don&#39;t just have house debt to pay off. &amp;rdquo;I put out the cigarette butt and replied coldly. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;As soon as I finished speaking, the agent trotted into the room, shouting, &quot;It&#39;s all easy, I&#39;ll take care of it.&quot; &quot;I also wanted to enter the room, but I found a man with glasses in a suit and leather shoes beside me. He asked me politely, &quot;Are you Mr. Hao from Room 101, Lane 179?&quot; &amp;rdquo;This man floated in front of me like a ghost at some point, but I guessed that he was here to collect debts. Thinking that there were house watchers inside, I subconsciously blocked the security door of the main building with my body. Question: &quot;I am, what should I say?&quot; &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The guy with glasses said that he was here to collect the money on behalf of Pudong X Bank. He said that I hadn’t paid back the money in four months and couldn’t be contacted by phone. Let’s talk. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Is there someone at home? &amp;rdquo;The boy with glasses glanced through the crack in the door. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Let me tell you straight, &quot;As a house-sitter, I will pay you back when the house is sold.&quot; &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The glasses guy said with a smile, &amp;ldquo;It would be great if there is a solution, but you have to pay back some first, the bank can&#39;t wait any longer. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I cursed and said that if the house was not sold, where would the money come from. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;As soon as I finished speaking, someone from a distance shouted at me: &quot;Hao Shiji, you&#39;re so fucking awesome!&quot; &quot;I followed the voice and saw three rough men, one fat, one tall, and one bald, walking towards me, cursing, &quot;When are you going to pay me back?&quot; &amp;rdquo;When they walked up to me, the glasses guy politely asked them which company they were from? The bald leader lit up a cigarette and asked, &quot;Are we traveling together?&quot; &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The glasses guy took two steps back and said let’s talk first, he was not in a hurry. The bald man started to stand up and warned me to pay back the interest today, 38,000, not a penny less.我担心影响里头看房，索性就豁出去，我盘了遍账，说半年前找你们借钱，我借了10万，让我还13.8万，你们说扣手续费，实际我拿到手只有6万。这半年里面，我也还了6万多了，剩下的就不能缓缓了？ &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;缓个毛。 &amp;rdquo;光头身后的圆肚子打断了我的话，&amp;ldquo;我们做的就是短平快的生意。 &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;说罢，便开始拽我，意思是要去他们公司谈谈。我连忙说这房子卖了就有钱了，再等等，我瞥了下眼睛仔，说不信问他。但这三人似乎还是执意地让我跟他们走。情急之下我便掏出手机，输入110三个数字，说：&amp;ldquo;我不走的，但今天我也没钱！ &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;光头看我很坚决，便问眼睛仔，说这房子是在卖了？眼镜仔装模作样地探了探屋里，说里头有人，看着像。然后，光头看着我举着手机，见我快按下110的号码后，便丢下句：&amp;ldquo;你老卵，明天开始我们会盯着你卖房子的事。 &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;于是，这三个人便离开了。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;我喘了口气，眼镜仔把光头递给他的烟给了我，他说他不抽烟，又安慰我，说没必要怕放高利贷的，这里是上海，不是别的地儿，法治社会，大庭广众之下不敢拿我怎么样。我感觉眼镜仔有点瞧不起那三个人，便笑着说，催债的也有鄙视链？眼镜仔也笑着回道，他是正规军，合法收账，是要讲道理的。但转眼，眼镜男也和我说了相似的话，意思是今天我多少要还点钱进去。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;我只能无奈地再重复一遍，今天没钱。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;大额信用卡不还是涉嫌诈骗的，郝先生，我们这儿有人蹲进去过。 &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;我尽快卖了房子，好伐？你帮忙和银行通融通融。 &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;见我没接他招，眼镜仔又说，&amp;ldquo;郝先生，您的困难我一定会和银行讲的，您放心，能给您争取减免政策肯定给您争取到位。但是，现在银行急，万一起诉做了财产保全，刚好卡在房子交易的档口上，影响了您过户&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;眼镜仔推了推他鼻梁上的眼镜，挑了下眉毛看着我。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;听完这话，我像是蛇被打在了七寸。我突然觉得眼镜仔比那三个人还狠，像块冰一样冷得刺骨。但人家说得确实有道理，这千古阳谋我是破不了了。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;这时，看房的人和中介也一起出来了，那家子人面带微笑，而我老婆也跟在后头，她的扑克脸在夜灯下阴沉得像抹了浓妆。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;郝先生，您不信问他。 &amp;rdquo;眼镜仔指了指恋家的中介。而中介小伙一眼便知眼镜仔来头不小。便赶忙招呼买房的人上了车，见那家子人的两厢小轿车晃晃悠悠开走后，眼镜仔又把刚才的经过耐心地重复了一遍。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;郝总，他说得对，您得想想办法。 &amp;rdquo;中介递了支烟给眼镜仔，眼镜仔推了推手，礼貌地拒绝了。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;没点办法吗？兄弟，帮个忙啊。 &amp;rdquo;眼看局面僵住了，中介小伙倒给我求起了情。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;眼镜仔依旧微笑，说实在没钱，他就回去如实交代，但看上去郝先生欠了不少钱，怕是银行没这耐心&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;怕我卖了房又跑了？ &amp;rdquo;我说。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;眼镜仔笑而不语。中介小伙便劝道让我问亲朋好友应个急。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;这大半年周围人都借了一遍了，我心里清楚早已山穷水尽。我只能默默地转头看向我老婆&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;今天还多少？ &amp;rdquo;这时，我老婆插进话头里来。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;一万二。 &amp;rdquo;眼镜仔立马回道。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;六千，多了没有，不行回去告他，我也不管了。 &amp;rdquo;我老婆拿出银行卡，我一瞅，那是我妈的卡。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;这时，眼镜仔利索地从公文包里掏出台POS机，和我老婆说：&amp;ldquo;那就刷六千，眼门前的业绩肯定要的。 &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;没几下，交易就完成了。我问眼镜仔，这样能顶几天，眼镜仔说他回去和上头求个情，半个月里不给你催款。我说你搞得定？他笑着说，银行早把债务外包给他家机构了，只要能还一些账都好说。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;细水长流嘛。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;中介小伙说买房的今天回去商量下，争取明天定下来。看着眼镜仔和中介远去的背影，我在我老婆面前抬不起头。我老婆告诉我，妈给借了八万。我刚想感叹一句，我老婆便指着我鼻子骂道：&amp;ldquo;你一分也别想动！ &amp;rdquo;接着，只见我老婆往车的方向走去。一时片刻我不知该怎么办？愣在原地只问道：&amp;ldquo;你去哪儿？ &amp;rdquo;我老婆说她住娘家去。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;我心中无奈，夫妻本是同林鸟，大难临头各自飞。可看着她上车，心中又觉得不舍，思来想去，这不是天灾，是我亲手造的孽。又想她要住回娘家那间老破小的出租屋和她妈挤在一张矮床上，胸口就像打了结。顿时，我挪起了脚，走到车前，像个犯错的孩子杵在原地。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;老婆没正眼瞧我，我敲了敲车窗，她摇下车窗不耐烦地说：&amp;ldquo;还要干嘛？ &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;你什么时候回&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;来。 &amp;rdquo;我本想说回家的&amp;ldquo;家&amp;rdquo;字，可这字就像卡在喉咙里的痰，怎么也出不来。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;老婆说：&amp;ldquo;都弄好再说吧。 &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;我说：&amp;ldquo;我晚上收拾下我们的东西，明天给搬到我妈那儿去，省得催债的烦。 &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;老婆说：&amp;ldquo;随便你。 &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;我说：&amp;ldquo;我把事情都弄好，会找个工作好好上班的。 &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;老婆的左脸有些微小的抽动，可仍旧沉默不语。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;我说：&amp;ldquo;那个&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;车子反正在你名下，我不会动什么脑筋，要让你上班挤地铁总归不行的。 &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;老婆说：&amp;ldquo;你明天搬东西没车怎么弄？ &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;我说：&amp;ldquo;我叫个货拉拉，问我妈借一些。 &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;老婆说：&amp;ldquo;随便你。 &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;说罢，她便发动了汽车，我看着车驶离小区，想回屋，但忽然感觉住了六年的房子陌生无比，心里头竟升起了些恐惧。我默默地坐在楼下的阶梯牙子上发呆，开始对未来展开胡思乱想。不稍片刻，我却看到老婆把车又开回来了，我深感诧异。她把车停在我面前，摇下车窗，向我递来五百块钱。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;拿着，别瞎用，出去办事省着点，饭不要不舍得吃，还没到饿肚子的地步。还有啊，别再老问你妈要钱，没用的东西。 &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;长年以来，我家奉行&amp;ldquo;小事女人决定，大事男人定夺&amp;rdquo;。可就在此刻，我拿着五百现金，一时语塞，只傻笑着问老婆：&amp;ldquo;后面怎么办？ &amp;rdquo;我老婆回道，她这几天去外面找合适的房子，找到了便和我讲。然后摇起车窗，又走了。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;我在车后摇着手，大喊：&amp;ldquo;晚上慢点开&amp;rdquo;。声音从来没有这样洪亮，都快成了嘶吼。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;3&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;清早7点不到，我把整理好的衣物叫了辆货拉拉运往我爸妈家。然后带着焦虑的心情在屋里发呆。中介小伙在早上9点打来电话，他说大事已定，我刚舒口气，他接上句&amp;ldquo;但是&amp;rdquo;，我的心又吊了起来。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;中介说：&amp;ldquo;郝总，您的房子还有237万的债务需要先清掉才能过户&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;啊？ &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;我在电话那头急了，我质问中介小伙为啥不早说，我说买房的人钱没准备好还是怎的？我哪里来的钱去先清债？ &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;中介笑着说：&amp;ldquo;郝总，您看您急的，我早就给您安排好了，您先来我门店，我们去走流程。 &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;待我来到中介门店，买房的那家人也来了。小伙和我们解释了一通，我听懂了五分，我大脑中理解出来的样子，就是直接给钱怕我不过户就跑了，所以都得走公账，而且买房的也得贷款，交易的钱都在指定的账户上流动，哪个流程卡了钱就动不了。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;总而言之，我得先把房子里的账清了，中介让我稍安勿躁，先签合同。这些干完，中介小伙便借来辆车，说去垫资方。我一下便反应过来，是啊，可以找人&amp;ldquo;过桥&amp;rdquo;嘛。弄好材料便上了路，我问中介小伙，这垫资方靠谱不？小伙笑笑，说都是熟门熟路的生意。我又担心，问自己的征信烂成那样对方肯做吗？中介小伙说比我更烂的都做过好几单哩。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;垫资方在徐家汇的大楼里，办公区域覆盖了一整个楼层，前台处一群人排着队，只瞧对接的人早已迎在门口，老远就向我俩招手，并笑着递上了依云牌矿泉水。我挤过人群感叹道，&amp;ldquo;你家生意这么好？ &amp;rdquo;，对接人说都是来应聘放贷业务员的。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;对接人看上去30岁不到，梳着大背头，银色的西装很讲究，同样都是穿西装，中介小伙身上那套黑色西服就显得俗不可耐。对接人说叫他小张就行。我们在洽谈室刚坐下，我就着急问：&amp;ldquo;张总，这事儿怎么弄？能做吗？ &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;小张说都是正常流程，他管我要了征信和相关材料去外头兜了一圈，便拿了合同回来开始说明，一个月的期限，垫资费用是2.5个点。 2370000x0.025=59250元，我脑子里一过账，背上开始出汗。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;我说：&amp;ldquo;能少点吗？张总？您知道我卖房也是为了解决困难。 &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;小张说：&amp;ldquo;郝总，您的情况我也知道了，如果不是我们家和恋家方是深度合作关系，您这生意没别家做的。 &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;我说：&amp;ldquo;再少点吧。 &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;小张转过头，不再看我，只回了句：&amp;ldquo;您可以回去考虑下。 &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;事已至此，我也只能答应了。我快速地把合同签完，正当我以为事儿都结束了，小张说要付5000块手续费。我立马火了，说刚才为什么不一起说，小张说是两笔账，垫资费到时候和恋家走账，5000块手续费是另外的账。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;一笔生意两笔账，我追问到底他妈的是什么账！小张说都是正常费用，就差这5000块，没有走不了程序。我再次确定除了手续费外没别的钱后，便拿起电话，准备打给我老婆。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;你帮我和我老婆解释吧&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;我把手机递给中介小伙。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;中介小伙接过手机，待接通后，他便说：&amp;ldquo;姐，是这样的&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;解释一番后，没多久，我老婆便把钱转到了中介微信上。小张立即说，走，现在就去房贷公司还钱。中介小伙让我去楼下等会儿，他还有些事儿和小张沟通。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;我一个人走到大厦之下，思索片刻便知那5000块的门道。我叹了口气，突然想起看过一个纪录片，讲的是鲸落，一鲸落万物生，可我也不是鲸，大概也就是头猪，猪死了，蛇虫鼠蚁也能吃顿饱。这栋楼倒了，还有千千万万幢楼立起来，看着徐家汇繁华的商圈，我突然诗兴大发。但转眼，我又骂了句，拉稀也有屎壳郎候着。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;郝总！ &amp;rdquo;不稍片刻，中介小伙从一辆奔驰车里向我喊道。我上了车，和小张他们前往房抵公司去了。路上开了四十分钟，我都在后排睡觉。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;在房抵公司还账很顺利，这都亏了小张熟练的业务能力。房子上的欠账总算都清了，干干净净，就像一个好些年没洗澡的人，在澡堂里刮走了一身泥。中介小伙说他自己回去，而小张说要去杨浦区办事，我便让小张捎我一下，因为我爸妈也在杨浦。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;或许是心里的大石落了地。我便有了些心情和小张聊天。我说你们家生意真好做，200万每个月兜一遍，一年以后就能生出个60万。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;小张说：&amp;ldquo;听说郝总的生意是给超市供货？ &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;我说：&amp;ldquo;别提了，你知道黑猩猩便利不？ &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;小张说：&amp;ldquo;无人货架，我们楼里之前也放着一个。 &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;我说：&amp;ldquo;他家欠我300万货款呢。 &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;小张说：&amp;ldquo;新闻里说老板卷钱跑路了，那您没起诉他家？ &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;我拍了拍腿说：&amp;ldquo;起诉了啊，我得排队，欠1千万的还有好几个呢。 &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;小张：&amp;ldquo;啊？那他们付款不是一手交钱一手交货?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;我摇了摇头说：&amp;ldquo;都怪我贪大呗，刚做生意头两年，家里有关系，牛奶公司拿点货干批发，别人都是带着钱来拿货的，赚得少但稳；后来想做大，做成供应链，就给大商超大电商供货，他们这个月结上个月的钱，这不&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;我叹了口气。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;小张说：&amp;ldquo;这年头的生意还是短平快比较好。 &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;到了我爸妈家附近，我下了车，我转念一想，马上又拦下了小张的车。我躬下身子弯下腰，堆着笑脸朝车里探头，问：&amp;ldquo;张总，您们公司招人有年龄限制吗？ &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;小张说：&amp;ldquo;40岁以下就行，郝总家有人想找工作？ &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;我说：&amp;ldquo;我自己想找工作，您看&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;小张顿了顿，便加了我微信，给我发了招聘信息和联系人，临走前，他嘱咐说：&amp;ldquo;郝先生，这号码是人事经理的，你就说是我朋友，没问题的。 &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;来到我爸妈家，只见我妈在洗衣服。桌子上摆着红烧肉和番茄炒蛋，还冒着热气，这都是我喜欢吃的菜。她赶忙让我先吃饭，然后又去忙着洗好的衣服晾晒起来。我一看，晾着的衣服都是早上运来的。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;妈妈说：&amp;ldquo;你们洗的衣服一点儿不干净，都是味道，我重新给你们洗一下。 &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;这时，我爸从厕所出来，看到我便问起房子的事儿。我连连回答一切顺利。我爸的眉头也舒展开了。这时，我便问我妈那8万块哪借来的？ &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;妈妈说：&amp;ldquo;问你小舅舅借了6万，怕你万一还有急用，又问你大舅舅借了2万。 &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;这时，我爸从旁边接上话。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;爸爸抱怨道：&amp;ldquo;册那，我兜了一圈兄弟姐妹，屁也没。 &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;这时，我妈笑着说，关键时候还得靠娘家，郝家门一出事没一个顶用。这时我看我爸脸上挂着尴尬，便赶忙说这话也不能这样讲，说到底还是自己的问题，人家不借也是情分家家都有难念的经&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;似乎我爸意识到了什么，连忙问我小单（我老婆）去哪儿了？我说她今天上班。我爸脸上还是露着担心，忙问她晚上住哪儿？我便回答住娘家。我爸听后便站起了身，走向阳台，我看他来回踱了几步，又朝我妈耳语了几句，便回到我面前。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;爸爸说：&amp;ldquo;我和你妈商量过了，我们这间房给你和小单住，我和你妈出去租房子。 &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;我立马放下了碗筷，嘴里念着&amp;ldquo;别别别&amp;rdquo;。我妈又走过来，说这一室一厅的房子他们两个住浪费了，他们出去租个一室户的单间够了。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;你爸和我退休金多，租间一室户笃定的。 &amp;rdquo;我妈一脸轻松地说。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;不过这次，我毅然决然地拒绝了。我毕业那会儿，是我爸妈和大伯父打招呼，安排了工作；我结婚那会儿，是我爸妈置办了婚房又张罗了体面的婚礼；我想做生意，也是爸妈和大伯父商量，弄了点便宜货让我去过老板瘾。回头想想，我却时常和外人说，为什么自己爸妈不是富一代。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;看着我态度如此坚决，我爸妈不再强求。他们只说租的房小点没关系，一定要干净，千万别图便宜，洗澡卫生间都要有，钱不够他们贴点。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;妈妈说：&amp;ldquo;我下午去你大伯父家说个情，让你再回牛奶公司干。 &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;我说：&amp;ldquo;我已经找到工作了，这两天就去上班。 &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;妈妈说：&amp;ldquo;以后要听话。 &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;我说：&amp;ldquo;哦。 &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;吃完午饭我睡了一觉。但很快又被吵醒，我见我妈正在接手机，满脸凝重。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;我预感有什么事儿要发生。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;来电话的是我那房的隔壁邻居，说房子外的窗门都被人泼了漆。我马上反应过来是高利贷干的。光头没唬我，他拿我没法子，但他至少能恶心我，甚至搅黄我卖房的事。我把来龙去脉一五一十地和爸妈交待完，便打算回去处理。但我嘴上强硬，可心里却不知该怎么面对。身体就像撒了谎的小孩，总能看出些扭扭捏捏。我妈不愧是我妈，和天底下所有爱着自己孩子的母亲一样，无论孩子长多大，总能在细小处察觉孩子行动上的胆怯。她抢先一步站在了家门口，拉着我爸，轻松地说没什么好急的。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;这种事情还是大人去弄。 &amp;rdquo;我妈挥着手让我进屋，还叮嘱让我别告诉我老婆。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;我想说一起去，但最终只回了句&amp;ldquo;嗯&amp;rdquo;，就乖乖地进了屋。整个下午我都在忐忑中渡过，期间我总想做点什么来弥补心中的愧疚，想做些家务，但发现家里早就一尘不染，想洗个碗，水槽里也干干净净。我只能把刚才午睡时用过的被子叠得整整齐齐，便又迷茫无措。这时，我突然想到张总发我的招聘微信，我毫不犹豫地去了电话。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;得知张总竟然和电话那头的人事经理提前打过招呼了，我心中一暖。那头说明天带好证件就可以去报道了，培训两周后上岗，培训期没有工资，每天有15块钱饭补。我欣然答应，毕竟每天15块已经是我半年来再次正儿八经地赚到钱了。挂完电话，又给恋家的中介小伙去了微信，让他帮忙看看情况。之后我便像个小孩完成了学校作业，等着父母回家。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;我妈比我预想中更早回来，她一开门就让我帮忙拎东西，只见她手上的塑料袋里装满了菜和肉，一进屋什么也没说就钻进厨房张罗起晚饭。我瞅了瞅门外，问爸呢？我妈说我爸住在那屋了，等会儿烧点饭菜给他送去。我脑子没转过弯来。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;妈妈说：&amp;ldquo;你爸住在那里防止人家来捣乱，等房子过好户就回来。 &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;我脑子实在转不过弯，耳朵嗡嗡地响。我妈看我杵在原地，说那屋又没断水又没断电，家具齐全又宽敞，那张大床比睡自己家还舒服呢。我觉得这话我妈说得有道理，但事情却不是这个理啊，这个理是对着我欠债的事儿吗？欠账的事儿是对着这个理吗？我想着还是回去吧，便急着出门。我妈见状立即喊住了我，略带严肃地说：&amp;ldquo;听话，大人的事让大人解决。 &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;大人的事？但这分明是我的事，可这话终究还是被我咽回了肚里。刚才热血上头，却显得幼稚好笑，内心的胆怯被我妈看得一清二楚，装出来的坚强瞬间决了堤，泪珠子在眼睛里打转。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;此时，我妈转移了话题，问我什么时候去新单位上班？我吸了吸鼻涕，说明天就去。刚说完，我妈擦了擦手，去了卧室，不稍片刻又出来，往我手里塞了一张交通卡，说里面还有一百多块，是爸的，这段时间他用不着；然后又从兜里摸出了200块，说这两天手头紧，过几天退休金发下来再给我点。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;听话，早点睡觉，明天上班精神面貌总要好的呀。 &amp;rdquo;我妈做完饭，让我先吃，然后从里屋拿了一床被子，将沙发整理好，让我晚上睡床上，她自己睡客厅。我直说客厅的沙发睡得舒服自己喜欢睡沙发，我妈便又在被子上盖了层毛毯，说这样晚上睡觉就不会感冒了。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;4&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;第二天我很早就起床了，认真梳洗后便前往新公司报道。新员工培训的间隙，我还是忍不住把我爸住那屋里的事告诉了老婆，我老婆收到消息便在微信里把我骂了一顿，说这么大的事为什么瞒着她。老婆问我培训到几点，我说到下午两点就结束，她便说会请个假下午开车来接我。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;中午吃饭的时候我才明白，15块钱的饭贴其实是给我们一张饭券，拿着它就可以到一楼的合作餐馆打饭。公司有个规定，培训的新人吃饭时必须端着碗吃，所以你会看见饭店里一群身穿西装的人一手端着盛着米饭的碗，挺直着腰板吃着饭，甚是壮观。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;我在这批新人里年龄最大，早上适应了好一会儿才克服了心理上的疙瘩。新人同事都称我老郝，我叫他们小赵小钱，倒还融洽。吃到一半，张总在背后拍了拍我，我吓得赶忙起身，像在军训般站得笔挺。按照公司规定新人看见经理级的要起身讲话，我大声地说：&amp;ldquo;张总，中午好！ &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;张总看着旁边的人事经理，笑着说：&amp;ldquo;别看老郝年龄大，公司发展需要有经验的人啊。 &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;人事经理赶忙接话：&amp;ldquo;老郝吸收得快，不比年轻人差。 &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;张总又对我说：&amp;ldquo;老郝啊，要不是做你那单，我们业务二组这季度就拿不到销冠喽。 &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;我躬下身：&amp;ldquo;张总您这话说得，业务上要向您多学习。 &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;下午两点培训结束，我一出公司门，就看见我老婆已经把车停在外头，我连忙上前，竟然看见车后头坐着丈母娘还有老李头。我钻进副驾驶，我老婆就说赶快去爸那里看看什么情况。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;许久不见老李头，我也不知该怎么谢他借我钱的事。老李头倒是先捅破了窗户纸，说那些钱什么时候方便了再还。我连连说稳定下来后每个月还一些，我丈母娘赶忙插话，说老李头的儿子结婚了，他独身一人，存的那点钱放着也不知道怎么花。而我老婆则告诉我，老李头托朋友帮我们找了间一室户，房租2000不到，就是远了点，在上海宝山区，开车20公里路就到江苏了。但离地铁很近。我连忙说我能早起。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;突然，老李头话锋一转，问：&amp;ldquo;小郝啊，上回几个人来讨债？ &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;我说：&amp;ldquo;三个人。 &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;老李头哈哈大笑道：&amp;ldquo;三只小册佬，三根小卵毛，我一个人就能搞定。 &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;丈母娘用手肘顶了顶老李头，说在孩子面前别老不正经。其实，老李头和我丈母娘都单着，我顿时感觉他们俩还挺般配。不过听说老李头儿子反对他再婚，所以他和我丈母娘拉拉扯扯好多年，至今也只能维持在拉拉扯扯的程度。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;当我们的车快要接近小区门口时，我隐约瞧见有辆警车从小区驶出。我瞬间紧张起来，催促老婆加快速度。我们的车一把钻进了小区里，还没停稳我便冲了下去，老李头紧跟着我身后，嘴里说着：&amp;ldquo;在哪儿在哪儿？ &amp;rdquo;我嘱咐老婆去找停车位，便一路小跑奔向房子。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;我老远就看见房子的窗外泼上了红漆，&amp;ldquo;欠债还钱&amp;rdquo;四个字成了这间屋子新的窗帘。经过门前的路人都会抬头看两眼，露出满是好奇的神情。当我走到楼下，我又看见地上撒着些红色的&amp;ldquo;血点&amp;rdquo;。心中不由焦急，这时，我大脑中突然闪出了三个人打我爸的幻觉，这段画面如此真实，让我挥之不去。霎时，我仿佛吃了整管芥末，眼睛鼻子不听使唤地拧在了一起。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;总楼的防盗门没锁，我抹了把眼泪直往里冲，此时此刻，我听见屋里头传来好多人说话的声音，我心紧得慌，脑袋里直蹿出个想法：谁在里面动我爸，我第一个弄死他。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;当我来到屋子门口，我呆住了。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;二伯，大姑姑、小姑姑、大姑父、小姑父&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;屋里头站满了郝家门的长辈，包括我表哥也在。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;老李头也被这架势唬住了，我赶忙介绍这是我老婆她（准后）爸，随后大家便开始有说有笑。我爸知我已到，便从厕所挤到我面前，我看他袖管高高撸起，正在用湿纸巾擦着手臂上的三道血痕，我赶忙问怎么回事。我二伯说高利贷的来了四个人，不仅泼油漆，还骚扰隔壁邻居，他们说要住在屋里不走了。我爸当然不肯，便和他们争了起来，时间一久没了耐心，就开始动手动脚。还好二伯他们及时赶到，随后陆陆续续其他长辈也来了，当然也报了警&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;事情嘛就过去了。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;我听得一愣一愣。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;二伯说：&amp;ldquo;代代啊，高利贷以后不会来了，都帮你解决了。 &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;我满脸困惑。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;二伯说：&amp;ldquo;都谈好了，给他们两万块，账都清了。 &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;我不敢相信。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;二伯说：&amp;ldquo;我出面问你大伯借的。 &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;大伯这人脾气有点傲，不过得知我不是欠赌债，便借了这钱。我好奇，为什么高利贷就接受了这方案？我二伯说，他们这种人都做的短平快生意，有本事他们去起诉，起诉你懂得呀，一个官司进进出出，最后判下来怎么说也要个小半年。如果里面再有点材料不足什么的，时间就得更久。有这功夫劲，多做几笔生意，好过和你纠缠。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;二伯把借条还给了我，我收下条子便说大伯的钱我一定会还的。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;二伯摇了摇手说：&amp;ldquo;还个屁，他大领导，有的是钱。 &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;我爸蹿出来说，要不是二伯拉着，那个圆肚子的胖子就被他打死了。我二伯的脸笑得通红，直说拉倒吧，他来的时候我爸已经被人家摁进旁边的绿化带里了。而我爸连连叫着，自己滑跤了，给人偷袭了。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;此时，我丈母娘和我老婆也进来了，又过了十分钟不到，我妈也来了，她身后跟着我大舅舅和小舅舅。这下子，好似这屋里发生了天大的喜事，我看着这么大家子人嘻嘻哈哈，瞬间觉得，自己心里头的某些执念也不过是过眼云烟。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;散了时，我爸还是说要住在这屋，一是怕高利贷的人反悔再来惹事，二是把屋子里外都弄干净。我说我也留下陪他，我二伯便在旁嚷着：&amp;ldquo;这事情大人来搞定，你别操心。 &amp;rdquo;而我姑姑们劝我别担心，她们都退休了，反正没事做，会轮流给我爸送饭来，只会让他胖，不会饿着他。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;这两天，人来人往好多人，我的烂事从热闹中开始，但又从热闹中结束。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;后来，房子顺利地卖掉，虽然剩余的钱只够还银行信用卡的账，但一些零散的小贷倒也不难还了。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;张总那儿的工作我干了一个月便离了职，其实我是新人里第一个出单的，当时组长给我派了个客户，说是和我&amp;ldquo;专业对口&amp;rdquo;，我一看资料，嘿，干食品供应的，我以前是同行，这老板在上海干了二十年食品供应链生意，圈内颇有名气，我曾经也略有耳闻。去了客户那儿，很快便谈妥了，这老板要抵押浦东的小别墅，但银行放款比例少，于是他想做高房价，然后多批点。我说多批点那利息就得高啊。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;这年头生意难做了。 &amp;rdquo;这老板抱怨：&amp;ldquo;实体店进货少了，电商他们也不懂。 &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;我说：&amp;ldquo;你是船大难调头啊。 &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;其实，张总公司的资金都是通过吸储而来，所以这都是左口袋进右口袋出的买卖。这单一共放出去700万，我的奖金是什么呢？首先，700万公司规定有2个点手续费，而这两个点手续费我给谈到了3个点，利息也从年化15个点谈到了25个点。这笔放款公司除了利息的收益，又先行赚了21万的手续费，而我就是在手续费里头提了10个点的奖金。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;那天小组直接开了表彰会，我成了新员工的榜样，组长让我说段话以示激励，我想了想，便说：&amp;ldquo;就像我的名字，这是个好时代，大家努力，努力，再努力。 &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;没几天，转念一想，我便辞了职，我老婆说我傻，如果每个月都做出个业绩，日子马上就好起来了。张总也很惋惜，说我在这行颇有潜力。但我只说自己不适合干短平快的活。可能是自己忘不了，去食品老板那儿谈生意的时候，看到他苍老的身躯在偌大的仓库中勉力前行，我仿佛也看见了自己曾经在困苦中孤寂的背影。无法言明的感觉在心头涤荡。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;多年以后，看到新闻说张总所在的公司&amp;ldquo;爆雷了&amp;rdquo;。但那也是后话了。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;我和我老婆搬进了宝山区的一室户，房子还算干净整洁。我在附近的商场里找了份工作&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;在一所教培机构当课程顾问，收入不高，但加我老婆的工资，日子还算凑合。稳定下来后，我便好奇地问我老婆&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;为什么当时对车的态度如此坚持？ &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;我老婆说，她打小爸妈就离了婚，她亲爸对她不管不问，只能跟着妈过着清苦的日子。本以为嫁给我能过上好生活，没几年便给我弄得家道中落。而这车便是一个念想，总觉得好日子还留着个尾巴。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;我说：&amp;ldquo;那每个月油钱也不少。 &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;老婆说：&amp;ldquo;那只能苦些你了。 &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;我说：&amp;ldquo;那必须的。 &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;老婆说：&amp;ldquo;从认识你到现在总是在还债。 &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;我说：&amp;ldquo;这话怎么说？ &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;老婆说：&amp;ldquo;你第一次和我约会开始，好吃好喝好玩的，你他娘的全是刷的信用卡，直到办完婚礼，收上来的大几万礼金都给你还了账。 &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;我回道：&amp;ldquo;羊毛出在羊身上&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;老婆狠狠地捏了我下大腿肉，说：&amp;ldquo;你这老东西不要脸。 &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;尾声&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;那日，我和我老婆去接我爸从老房子出来。我爸开玩笑说终于&amp;ldquo;出狱&amp;rdquo;了。他惋惜着说房子里还剩的几个大家具就这么不要啦？我说现在家里住得小算了，不去想了。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;当我们离开时，老邻居冲出来叫唤道：&amp;ldquo;老郝，钥匙没拔！ &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;一听有人叫&amp;ldquo;老郝&amp;rdquo;，我和我爸同时转过了头。 &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;责任编辑：舟自横&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;征稿信息见@ONE一个工作室置顶微博。
